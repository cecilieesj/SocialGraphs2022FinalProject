'''Ammand the Corsair''' is a supporting character in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise, first appearing in the [[2007]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. He is the Pirate Lord of the Black Sea, and one of the several [[Brethren Court]] members.

==Background==
Ammand is the Pirate Lord of the Black Sea. He speaks in a deep voice and despite being well-groomed, he uses an aggressive behavior to settle disagreements.

===Appearance===
Ammand has a large curled mustache wearing an embroidered headdress on his head. He also wore a gold and brown coat and breeches with a cloak arranged on his shoulders.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
In a plan to consult the pirate lords of the [[Brethren Court]] at Shipwreck Cove to fight against [[Davy Jones]] working for [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], Ammand and the rest of the pirate lords are present with [[Jack Sparrow]] and his crew attending under command by [[Hector Barbossa]] where all the pirate lords hand their pieces of eight to bind [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]] in a plan to fight Davy Jones under command of Lord Cutler Beckett. 

During a plan to fight against Davy Jones and free Calypso, Ammand and the other pirate lords refuse to listen and fight each other in a brawl, believing Calypso is a threat to the Brethren Court. Barbossa, however, stops the fight, clarifying that it was the First Court who imprisoned Calypso, planning to release her. Jack Sparrow takes part in a speech devising a plan to fight against the [[East India Trading Company|EITC]]'s forces while Barbossa summons [[Captain Teague]] who later arrives to deal with the plan.

As Captain Teague arrives, he shows Jack's crew and the Brethren Court the Codex to which all the pirate lords vote for themselves and as [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] plans to fight against the EITC, Ammand and the other pirate lords accept Elizabeth's request in a plan to fight against the EITC. 

Later, when Elizabeth commands all the pirates to raise their flags to prepare for battle, Ammand is present with the pirate lords who also raise their flags to prepare to fight against Davy Jones and the EITC under Elizabeth's command. 

After Davy Jones falls to his death during battle at the maelstrom and Lord Cutler Beckett is defeated for good, Ammand and the other pirate lords celebrate their freedom from the EITC, alongside [[Tai Huang]] and his men and the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' in victory.

Ammand returns in the video game adaptation of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End''. Compared to the film version, Ammand's role is much more significant as he appears more often and becomes a playable character out of the story modes. In the game, Ammand helps Jack Sparrow and his crew through several missions and guides them through certain areas. At one point in the story mode, he becomes playable and helps Jack fend against Davy Jones' men. 

In the game, Jack encounters Ammand and [[Sri Sumbhajee Angria|Sumbhajee]] in Shipwreck City, and convinces them to take part in the Conclave. Ammand initially disagrees at first and heads for his ship, but once he is beaten by Jack in a duel, he quickly changes his mind. Jack ends up saving the two pirates before blowing up, and find "Stupid" Barnaby, who had stolen Sumbhajee's Piece of the Eight. Jack returns the missing object to the pirate, and the crew make their way to the Brethren Court meeting. The pirates come to a hasty compromise, and Jack's crew free Tia Dalma from her human form, leading her to help the pirates fight against Davy Jones.

Ammand returns in the Lego video game version of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies. His role remains pretty much the same as compared to the movies, but is in need of assistance when a statue of himself fails construction, and requires the help of Jack Sparrow and Barbossa. Afterwards, he attends the Brethren Court meeting after finishing he and the other pirate’s quests during the level.

==== ''Day of the Shadow'' ====
Ammand appears in the fifth novel of this series as a major character. When Jack and his crew arrive in France, they are attacked by the Spanish, causing the crew to split three ways. Carolina and Diego manage to hide away on a ship, avoiding Carolina's father in the process. However, an encounter with Ammand leads Diego injured, and the corsair takes over the merchant ship. Once Ammand realizes Carolina is the missing princess, he locks her and Diego away. He mentions to have a predecessor, someone who ruled over the Black Sea before him. 

Carolina notices Ammand holds a vila of Shadow Gold in his sash, and she and Diego eventually take it. Later, she gives Jack Sparrow the vial, and uses it to temporarily cure his Shadow Sickness. After the Shadow Lord is defeated, earlier revealed to be Henry Morgan, Ammand and the other Pirate Lords agree to a truce and go their separate ways., while also reclaiming their stolen territories.

In the opening cavern sequence of this ride, the skeletal corpses of the Brethren Court members can be seen sitting at a table, Ammand being one of them. It is unknown how they died or what they were doing on Treasure Cove which lead to their apparent deaths.

==Trivia==
*In the [[Joe Books]] adaptation of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series, it was originally going to feature Ammand and his castle in a "caper story" showing the final piece of the Weather Gauge stolen from the castle's collection in the seventh issue, followed by the story taking place at Ammand's castle in the planned and eighth issue. However, after the fifth issue, the rest of the issues were cancelled.
