'''Braddock''' is a supporting character in the [[2019]] series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Braddock is very sweet-natured and loves making new friends, such as where she bonded with Grime's former prisoner, [[Sasha Waybright]]. Braddock is also a terrible liar as she got easily nervous and sweated a lot when being questioned by [[General Yunan]]. Braddock also hates when someone goes against their word on a promise where she got angry at Sasha for breaking her promise to her and [[Percy (Amphibia)|Percy]] when she cared more about retrieving Barrel's warhammer than their safety.

===Physical appearance===
Braddock is a female toad with light purple skin. She had violet shaded spots dotted across her cheeks, resembling freckles, and a light yellow underbelly. She also has blonde hair tied back into a bun with a loop of string and wears leather armbands and brown iron armor alike the other toad soldiers. In "[[Barrel's Warhammer]]," Braddock wore red armor with an eye painted on her shoulder pads.
