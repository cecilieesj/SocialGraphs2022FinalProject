'''Tom Lucas''' is the father of the brothers in the band, JONAS, in the [[Disney Channel]] [[Disney Channel Original Series|Original Series]], ''[[Jonas L.A.|Jonas L.A]]''. At times, it seems like he cares more about his job as the boys manager than the boys themselves, and he is constantly trying to make his wife happy, like in the episode ''[[That Ding You Do]]'', where he is seen and heard shouting nice things about women, like they are intelligent and thoughtful. He does not go to LA with his sons, however, he does come for a visit in the second season episode ''Direct to Video''. He is played by John Ducey.
==Notes==
