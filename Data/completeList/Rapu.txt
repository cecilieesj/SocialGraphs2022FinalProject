'''Rapu'''  is the overarching antagonist in ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''. Rapu is the first god killed by [[Gorr the God Butcher]].

====''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''====
He first appeared, when [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] had entered his lush realm and fed upon his celebratory fruits before Rapu demanded to know why he was doing this. Rapu demanded that Gorr and his people worship the gods. Gorr explained that he was the only one left, causing Rapu to mock him and demand him find other followers to worship him. He told Gorr the food wasn't for the planet, but to celebrate his victory over the wielder of All-Black the Necrosword. Rapu became enraged when Gorr tore off his medallion and renounced him, gripping his throat and strangling him slowly. As he was doing this, Rapu did not notice the necrosword float into Gorr's hand until he was impaled through the throat by his former disciple. In his final moments, Rapu told Gorr the sword was a curse, only for him to say otherwise and therefore vowing to kill all the gods before beheading his former deity.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr's]] people live on a planet with no gods but worship sky gods with a similar crown to Rapu; a purple-skinned gold-armored god similar in appearance to him crash-lands on the planet after a battle with Knull and begs Gorr for help, prompting Gorr to murder him out of anger as [[Love (Marvel)|his child]] had died.
