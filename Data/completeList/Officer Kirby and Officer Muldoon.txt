'''Officers Kirby and Muldoon''' are characters from the animated TV series ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. They are police officers who work for [[Sergeant Spinelli]]. The Rescue Rangers often patrol the city on the roof of their police car. Kirby is African-American and buff with a mustache, while Muldoon is a scrawny Caucasian redhead with buckteeth and curly hair, his hat covering his eyes. The two usually haul away the arrested human villains of the episodes in the city, though the Rescue Rangers are their primary source of success. Both Kirby and Muldoon are voiced by [[Peter Cullen]].

However, Kirby and Muldoon are still vulnerable to mishaps while on their patrols or responding to emergencies. In "The Carpetsnaggers", they attempt to pursue a doghouse send airborne by one of Nimnul's flying carpets with the dog still inside, but not only lose sight of it, but crash their cruiser headlong into a fire hydrant, totaling it, causing them to stagger out, fearing how their captain is going to respond to them wrecking their patrol car and the reason for the pursuit that caused the cruiser's crash in the first place. Indeed, the next morning at the precinct, even Sgt. Spinelli is having a good time ribbing Kirby and Muldoon for their little unbelievable pursuit that totaled their squad car, while they are still feeling humiliated after the captain blew up at them, and Spinelli also scolds them over how while they were off trashing one of the department's cruisers, half the city was burglarized in the meantime. Nevertheless, they are given a new cruiser, with which they are able to pursue Nimnul and arrive just after his hidden base and transport van for an Arabic carpet shop is crushed by the large mansion he attempted to rob thanks to the Rescue Rangers, allowing them to arrest Nimnul and take him to jail, along with recovering all the stolen loot from the robberies Nimnul pulled off with his carpets. In "It's a Bird, It's Insane, It's Dale!", after Seymour steals several famous landmarks, making it look like Rubber Bando, AKA Dale, was the guilty party, Kirby and Muldoon are assigned the duty of bringing him in, arriving with several other cruisers to arrest him, but when Kirby tries to blast Dale with a bazooka, Dale reflects the rocket back into Kirby and Muldoon's cruiser, blowing it to pieces, forcing them to call in a officer with a flamethrower to stop him. In "Rest Home Rangers", they are responding to Nimnul's shoplifting of prunes from a grocery store when the employee triggered the alarm, only to get zapped by Nimnul's age-changing ray, reducing Kirby, Muldoon, and their cruiser to an elderly state, resulting in them crashing into the front entrance of the grocery store due to Kirby being unable to understand Muldoon telling him to put on the brakes, though the damage to their worn-out cruiser is minimal due to how slow they were going when they wrecked. They still attempt to pursue Nimnul on foot, but can't due to getting fatigued quickly. Luckily, when they pass the factory where Nimnul broke in earlier, Chip and Dale cause Nimnul to turn several seeds into full-grown trees, alerting Kirby and Muldoon, who decide to investigate. They pull in through the hole Nimnul made in the garage door earlier, unknowingly running over Nimnul's age-changing device, which Gadget had loaded with plums to reverse its effects, setting it off, resulting in the beam ricocheting and hitting Nimnul, Kirby, Muldoon, and their cruiser, restoring them all to normal ages, after which, Kirby and Muldoon arrest Nimnul and take him to jail, with Nimnul requesting no prunes with his breakfast while behind bars.

Despite their bad moments, they still prove their loyalty to the badge when it is needed, such as in "To The Rescue", when they hear Detective Drake's request for backup on the radio and respond, joining their cruiser with Drake's unmarked unit to apprehend Klordane's henchman Percy, who stole the Clucthcoin Ruby Necklace. When they arrive at the construction site where Percy ditched his car, though Kirby asks Drake if he wants them to take over, Drake refuses, assuring his brother officers he's not unfit for duty yet, even with his retirement in a month, ordering them to split up and take the other side while he and Plato enter through the door nearby, warning them to be alert as Percy could hide the ruby before being caught or escapes, all three having their revolvers drawn and at the ready. However, Klordane gets the drop on them and traps Kirby and Muldoon in a corner by dropping a large wood palette behind them, sealing them in. By the time they climb out and get free, thanks to Chip and Dale, Drake and Plato recover the ruby, but Percy escaped. Muldoon, Kirby, Drake, and Plato return to the precinct to secure the ruby until it can be returned to its rightful owners, with Kirby and Muldoon still voicing how impressed they are with Drake and Plato and their efforts to still fight crime as their retirement approaches. However, when Fat Cat causes trouble in the precinct, causing Plato to run across Muldoon and Kirby's desks before Sgt. Spinelli has the SWAT team chase after them and catch them alive after they initially were going to use lethal force, once Fat Cat is cornered, he reveals his deception with framing Drake and Plato for the theft of the ruby and apparently trying to flee the country, as Kirby finds the planted airline tickets and gambling debts in Drake's coat, forcing Muldoon, Kirby, the other officers, and the SWAT team to have to sadly arrest Drake and Plato, disarming Drake of his service revolver, and locking them up until Drake and Plato can be found innocent or guilty of their charges, leaving Kirby, Muldoon, Spinelli, and the rest of the precinct pretty devastated at thinking Drake and Plato have betrayed the badge this close to their retirement. Later, when Klordane launches his master plan with stealing all the gold in the Global Gold Reserve with the support of Nimnul, Kirby and Muldoon are with all the cops investigating the theft before the Rescue Rangers cause the entire building to fall into Klordane's subterranean lair, allowing them to arrest Nimnul and all of Klordane's men, while Klordane escapes, sealing the tunnel behind him before Kirby, Muldoon, or any of the officers can catch up and stop him, only to end up on the desk of the captain thanks to Plato and the Rescue Rangers, confessing to his crimes and thus vindicating Drake and Plato, much to the relief of Kirby, Muldoon, Spinelli, and the rest of the precinct as Klordane's confession proves that Drake and Plato are innocent and can still retire while they carry on Drake and Plato's legacy.

The two appears in the episodes "[[To the Rescue]], "[[Catteries Not Included]]", "[[The Carpetsnaggers]]", "[[Battle of the Bulge]]", "[[Last Train to Cashville]]", "[[A Wolf in Cheap Clothing]]", "[[Seer No Evil]]", "[[The S.S.
