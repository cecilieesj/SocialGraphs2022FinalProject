==Trivia==
*Topolino is a tribute to the Fiat 500 "Topolino" as well as a Disney in-joke: Topolino ("little mouse") is Mickey Mouse's name in Italian.
*She is a (fictional) 1951 Bella Machina Model B ("Bella macchina" is Italian for "Beautiful car"), though she bears a Fiat logo only used on 500 "Topolino"s. She also resembles a 1963 Renault Dauphine.
*According to her die-cast, her license plate reads "FI-26 45N1".
*In non-English versions of ''Cars 2'', Mama Topolino is voiced by [[Wikipedia:Sophia Loren|Sophia Loren]].<ref name="skspec">[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-cars-2-character-stats-tokyo-party-clip-sophia-loren-joins-cast-16423/ ‘Cars 2′ Character Stats, New Tokyo Party Clip and New Still as Sophia Loren Joins International Cast]</ref>
