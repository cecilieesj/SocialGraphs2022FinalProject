====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In [[2023]], a short period after the Blip, Sarah Proctor is in [[Westview]], when she becomes entrapped, as the town and everything within, is transformed, into a black and white, 1950s sitcom. She is assigned the new identity of Dottie Jones. Under this new persona, Sarah is aware of everything that happens, but but has no control, and feels Wanda's pain. When she goes to sleep, she suffers from Wanda's nightmares. As Dottie, she lives with her husband [[Harold Proctor|Phil Jones]]. When Phil started his job, his employer, [[Todd Davis|Mr. Hart]] and [[Sharon Davis|his wife]] were invited to their home, and she had a five course meal prepared, along with a string quartet. After, [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]], and her husband, [[Vision]], move into the neighborhood, rumors begin circulating about the pair, that eventually reach Dottie.

The [[Don't Touch That Dial|second episode]] takes place in the 1960s. One day, Dottie hosts planning committee meeting, along with the other housewives, for a talent show fundraiser, set up for the children of Westview Elementary. Whilst she is in discussion on how the show will be organized, and the history behind it, she finds herself stopping, and draws attention to Wanda and [[Monica Rambeau|Geraldine]], who were talking at the same time. She continues with her speech, when Wanda begins to prematurely clap, and then finds she and Monica talking over her again, and cites her irritation. Once she is finished, she allows the other women to clap, and then silences them. After the meeting is over, she picks Wanda to help her clean up, and Wanda apologizes, if she gave off a bad first impression. Dottie mentions the rumors she has heard, surrounding Wanda and her husband, and admits she doesn't believe that the pair won't cause any harm. Suddenly the radio's music stops, and a [[Jimmy Woo|man]]'s voice can be heard, calling out to Wanda. Dottie fearfully questions, who Wanda really is, when the glass she is holding, suddenly shatters from her hands, creating a bloody cut, in the palm of her hand. Dottie's focus on the Wanda is suddenly lost, and she leaves to clean the blood from her dress. When the time for the talent show arrives, Dottie introduces Wanda and Vision on stage, and watches there comedic magic show. Having been thoroughly entertained by their performance, she declares them the winners, and ushers them onto stage, before they can leave.

By the [[Now in Color|third episode]], the time period has moved on to the 1970s, and is now in color. While at home with her husband, Dottie tries on a pair of earrings, and asks her husband if they make her look fat. Before he can reply, the electricity goes out.

The [[Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision)|seventh episode]] pays homage to the mid-to-late-2000s. While attending her front garden, Wanda exits her home, and gets into a fight with Monica. Dottie, and all those surrounding the area, become frozen, until the confrontation is over, at which point, she continues, as if nothing ever happened.

One day, Dottie's out in town, with [[Isabel Matsueda|Beverly]], when Wanda appears, and her true persona, of Sarah is restored by [[Agatha Harkness]]. Sarah approaches Wanda, who refers to her as Dottie, and Sarah corrects her, on what her real name is. She informs her that she has a daughter who is eight, and proposes that they could be friends with [[Billy Maximoff|Billy]] and [[Tommy Maximoff|Tommy]], if she likes that storyline, or even the school bully. She suggests anything, and pleads with Wanda to let her daughter out of her room, so that she could hold her. Suddenly the true personas of all the towns residents are restored, and they all approach Wanda, alongside Sarah. They all beg to be freed, and Wanda tries to assure the group that she is protecting them, and that they feel at peace, but Sarah replies they feel her pain. They all simultaneously beg her, to release them, and Wanda screams at them to stop, releasing a burst of red [[magic]], and placing them all in a choke. Sarah falls to the ground, unable to breathe, alongside everyone else, and Wanda quickly undoes this. Wanda promises that she will let them go and begins lowering the Hex, surrounding Westview. Sarah and everyone, run to escape, but it is quickly brought back, before she has the chance to leave. A battle ensues in the sky, between Wanda, and Agatha Harkness, and once it's over, the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Before Wanda leaves, she makes her way in town to speak to Monica Rambeau, and Sarah can be seen, amongst the various other townspeople, angrily staring at her, for the suffering she caused.
