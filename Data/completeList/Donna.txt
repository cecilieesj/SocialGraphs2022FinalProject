==History==
In the [[Enchanted Forest]], Donna, along with her husband, [[Stephen (Once Upon a Time|Stephen]], is tricked by [[Jiminy Cricket]]'s parents about an elfin plague. They give them a fake serum as a cure. Unbeknownst to Jiminy, they switched the usual water serum they always use to scam people and give them the potion [[Rumplestiltskin]] had given Jiminy to get rid of his parents. After ingesting the potion, she and Stephen are turned into wooden puppets, which causes their son, [[Geppetto]], much alarm and grief when he sees them.

After the casting of the curse, Donna and Stephen remain as puppets in [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]]'s pawnshop collection.
