'''Prince Freddy''' (full name Prince Frederick I) is the cousin of [[Mayor Baba|Mayor Baba's]] historical counterpart in the Goof History episode "[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]" from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
He is the villainous cousin of [[Mayor Baba|King Richard the Chicken-Hearted]] who usurps the throne from him and takes control of Halfbakedham. He hires [[Pete|Sir Pete]] to help him in his plot to keep [[Goofy|Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees]] from returning the throne to the king.

===Personality===
Prince Freddy is a complainer. He also is egocentric and dictatorial, only thinking of himself and wanting to rule Halfbakedham, even though his cousin is the rightful leader.

===Physical appearance===
Prince Freddy is a short, averagely built anthropomorphic dog with brown hair. He wears a purple and velvet robe bordered with ermine, a gray undershirt, red slippers, and a large crown.

===Role in the series===
He only appears in the Goof History episode "[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]". He is the antagonist of the episode, as he took over the throne from his cousin, [[Mayor Baba|King Richard the Chicken-Hearted]].

==Trivia==
*Prince Freddy's personality is similar to the Chief Inspector's from the episode "[[Inspector Goofy]]". This may be due to the fact that Frank Welker provided both of their voices, basing them off of comedian Joe Besser.
*Prince Freddy's character is a parody of [[Prince John]] from [[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]].
