==Appearance==
Tutan Pharaoh is a tall and obese bearded man dressed in Egyptian Pharaoh clothes.

==Role in the series==
After [[Timon]] eats a scarab beetle known as the Sacred Scarab Beetle, Tutan Pharaoh shows up and tells Timon and [[Pumbaa]] that he's going to imprison them in the pyramid for all eternity due to Timon eating the beetle, which is considered sacrilege. Tutan throws the two in the pyramid, but they later find a way out.

When Timon and Pumbaa accidentally get to Tutan's throne room, Tutan sees them and chases after them. Timon and Pumbaa escape him by riding a camel. As they ride the camel, Timon and Pumbaa see water and they get to it, but it turned out to be a trap and Tutan captures them and throws them into the pyramid once again.

Luckily, Timon and Pumbaa find another way out and slide down the pyramid on a sled.
