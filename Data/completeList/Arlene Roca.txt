'''"Annoying" Arlene Roca''' (portrayed by [[Raini Rodriguez]]) is a classmate of Tripp, who has a major, yet somewhat creepy crush on him. She used to have a cat named Hip Hop and has a turtle named Jazz. She is of Spanish descent, as revealed in the episode "Annoying Arlene" when her rival [[Bianca Ortega]] saying that Spain sent Arlene back, which wasn't the case (because she moved from Spain due to inner ear infection). She appeared in the episodes "Annoying Arlene" and "Cat-Astrophe". Her father, Barry Roca, is a record producer, who Iron Weasel has often attempted (but failed) to get a record deal with.
