'''Summer Penguin''' is a female Muppet penguin featured in the [[2018]] version of ''[[Muppet Babies (2018 series)|Muppet Babies]]''. She is so creative, loves to draw, paint, and dance all at the same time. She is the smallest of the Muppet Babies group and has the biggest heart. Unlike the other main characters, she was created specifically for the 2018 version of the show and has no real life puppet.

==Background==
===Development===
Summer was conceived as a female character to balance out the ''Muppet Babies'' cast. The show's executive producer [[Tom Warburton]] reflects on the creation of Summer:

{{quote|It was me and our art director Chris Moreno sitting in a room just doodling and drawing, and I came up with this little sketch of a lollipop-shaped penguin with a turtleneck. We probably did a hundred different characters trying to figure out who this was going to be, and when we came into [[Disney Junior]] with this penguin and a couple others, they immediately went to the penguin and said, 'That one.' We have that original drawing hanging in the studio now.|Tom Warburton}}
