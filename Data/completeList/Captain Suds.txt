'''Captain Suds''' is a character who was introduced in the [[2012]] [[Pixar]] short, ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]''. He is a toy ship who is one of Bonnie's toys.

==Background==
Captain Suds is a red ship toy with a gray-bearded head (presumably a human) wearing a captain's hat who is one of Bonnie's toys. When pressed, he generates bubbles. Like all the bathtub toys, Suds cannot move when not floating on water. When floating on water, it gives him the ability to move, resulting in a party with the other toys on Bonnie's bathtub.

==Appearances==

===''[[Partysaurus Rex]]''===
Captain Suds is first seen in a fantasy sequence where he approaches [[Chuck E. Duck]] rescuing him from being tipped over and when a gigantic version of [[Rex]] emerges, it turns out that [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] is playing with her bathtub toys all along in the real world. [[Mrs. Anderson|Bonnie's mother]] sees her daughter telling her to have dinner at her grandmother's house instead just as she drains the water from the bathtub, resulting the water to drain. Soon as all the water is drained, the rest of the bathtub toys started lying down due to no water on the tub. Rex then decides to help the bathtub toys by turning on the cold water to come out of the spouter from [[Drips the Whale|Drips]]. It ultimately results in Suds and the rest of the bathtub toys dancing with each other happily thanks to Rex's plans, causing the toys to party in the bathtub - especially with extra soap.

Noticing a drain in the bathtub, Rex tosses a sponge in the shape of a frog on the drain to keep the water running, resulting in Captain Suds and the rest of the toys to continue dancing. Noticing that there is too much water in the bathtub, Rex turns off the lever from the spouter Drips is on, much to Suds and the other toys' worry. However, the water from the shower starts pouring, resulting in Captain Suds and the bathtub toys to overflow. Captain Suds makes no further appearances after that, even during the part where Bonnie's mother is talking to a plumbing service company about Bonnie's bathtub being jammed.
