'''Shepard Quaid''', better known as '''S.Q.''', is a supporting character in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. He is a young boy who is adopted by the villainous [[L.D. Curtain]], yet befriends the series' protagonist [[Reynie Muldoon]].

==Background==

===Personality===
S.Q. is a very nice and cordial young boy who is always seldom seen doing or saying anything negative. He seems rather clueless at times, though this is mostly because he was raised in a rather sheltered environment by Dr. Curtain. It is implied that he is easily manipulated via gaslighting by him in an effort to keep him distant from others. This does not keep S.Q. from being friendly to those around him.

===Physical appearance===
S.Q. is a tall lanky boy with straight hair. He is usually dressed in the colors of the Institute: a yellow shirt and blue pants with yellow shoes.

==Trivia==
*In the original books, '''S.Q. Pedalian''' was a rather dimwitted character whose obliviousness was much more apparent. His name is a reference to "sesquipedalian" as he had large feet.
