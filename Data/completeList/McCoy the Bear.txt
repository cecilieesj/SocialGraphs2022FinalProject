==Appearances==
===''[[Jungle Cubs]]''===
McCoy's first and only appearance in the series was the episode "[[Hulla Baloo]]." McCoy comes to [[Baloo]] and [[King Louie|Louie]]'s aid when the duo are attacked by a hungry cheetah. Soon after, McCoy introduces himself to Baloo and Louie, informing his new friends that he has journeyed down from the mountains in search of food. Baloo and McCoy soon grow a close bond after discovering they share many things in common. Louie soon becomes jealous of McCoy and Baloo's fast friendship. McCoy soon finds himself caught in the middle of his new friends' fight. McCoy soon informs his friends that he never tried to replace Louie. Later, after Baloo and Louie reconcile their differences, the duo are confronted yet again by the same cheetah that attacked them earlier. Baloo and Louie decide to make their final stand confronting the predator. Unknown to Baloo and Louie, McCoy was standing behind them. McCoy intimidates the cheetah by roaring, causing it to flee, much to Baloo and Louie surprise, believing they had scared cheetah away. McCoy soon emerges out of the brush to congratulate his friends for both scaring the cheetah and mending their friendship. McCoy soon parts with his jungle friends to return to the mountains.
