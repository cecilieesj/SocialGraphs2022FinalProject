'''Jason Grey''' is 1/3rd of the popular band knows as Connect 3, bandmate and brother to [[Shane Grey|Shane]] and [[Nate Grey]].

==Personality==
Jason is a skilled guitarist and backing singer for Connect 3, but is shown to be naive and very easily distracted. He goes with the flow most of the time and comes out with random comments in conversations. He is shown to have a fondness for birdhouses, and this a running gag in the first film.

==Appearances==
===''[[Camp Rock]]''===
Near the beginning of the film, Jason and Nate decide that Shane needs to spend the summer at Camp Rock in order to sort out his attitude problem before he costs the whole band their record deal. Before dropping Shane off, Jason asks him to make a birdhouse for him. Shane being Shane, rolls his eyes and leaves, though, throughout the whole film, that pops up into a lot of conversations. Jason never gets that birdhouse.
