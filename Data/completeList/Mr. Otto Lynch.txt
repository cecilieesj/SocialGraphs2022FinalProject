'''Mr. Otto Lynch''' appeared in the second season ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[[What "Sexual" Harris Meant|What 'Sexual' Harris Meant]]", as one of the [[WESAYSO]] board politicians grilling [[Monica DeVertebrae]]. He was performed by [[Allan Trautman]].

Unfortunately, he rarely succeeds in getting his statements across. (He states that the confrontation between Monica and [[Al "Sexual" Harris]] took place ten years before the trial; it was actually on the previous Tuesday.)
