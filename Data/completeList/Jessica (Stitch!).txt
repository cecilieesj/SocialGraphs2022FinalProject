==Role in the series==
She has a crush on [[Hiroman]] and his friends whom she bosses around. Her friends are two close girls named [[Toriko and Makiko]]. She, like [[Penny (Stitch!)|Penny]] from the first two seasons, likes to mock and deride [[Stitch]] and [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]]. She also bears a trait of saying rather dull jokes and puns, often met with silent response. However, unlike [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and Penny, she doesn't seem like such a bad person. There were a couple of times she was shown to be sorry for her actions, such as when she cheated on Yuna on her birthday or when Stitch gave her a sushi roll despite what happened in the past. She was also one of those who fought alongside Stitch against [[Dark End]].
