'''Tristan Wren''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He is a [[Mandalorian]] human and is [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]]'s brother.

==Background==
Tristan Wren, brother of rebel [[Sabine Wren]], is a capable yet conflicted warrior. Along with his clan, he aligned with the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] following the occupation of [[Mandalore]], and blamed his sister for her role in its fall. But after a clash with [[Gar Saxon]] on Krownest, he now stands with his sister in defiance of Imperial tyranny.

==Trivia==
*Sabine having a sibling was an idea the ''Rebels'' producers had since during initial development of the show, but they originally intended for her to have a twin sister called Sacha Wren. They eventually changed her sibling's gender and considered introducing him earlier as The Protector of Concord Dawn, but he was replaced by the new character [[Fenn Rau]].
*Early in development, Tristan's name was Jona Wren.
