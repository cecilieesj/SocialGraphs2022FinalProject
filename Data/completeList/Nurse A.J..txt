==Trivia==
*A.J.'s name tag reads "Nancy" in ''[[Up]]''. According to [[Pete Docter]], this was a deliberate detail, suggesting that he had put on a random tag, conveying the idea he is somewhat untidy, as opposed to his colleague.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2009/11/up_director_pete_docter.html Up Director Pete Docter on His Next Project and Why Pixar Movies End With Chase Scenes]</ref>
