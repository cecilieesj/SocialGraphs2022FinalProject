==Background==
===Personality===
Maddie Flour is a weird kid. She talks in a husky, whispering voice and makes those around her uncomfortable with her presence. Whether she does this on purpose or is inept to social cues is not known, but she does try to be friendly with people. She does seem somewhat self aware as she acknowledges that some people think she is evil when really she wants to use her abilities for good.

However, she is also shown to have an edge, being more than willing to curse somebody if pushed enough. This trait was shown in "[[Cursed!]]", when she fought Barry when it turned out he cursed Anne and Sprig, and in the online game ''Locus Pocus'', where it was suggested that she will curse Anne and Sprig due to having repaired the bakery. The game also revealed that she actually dislikes working at the bakery.

As shown in [[Maddie & Marcy|"Maddie & Marcy"]], Maddie used to play with her younger sisters a lot when she was younger. But she stopped playing with them once she became invested in the magical arts, causing her to neglect her sisters in the process. This would lead to them often causing trouble for her and messing up her spells, and she considers them a nuisance. Even when her new friend [[Marcy Wu|Marcy]] pointed out that she should spend more time with them, Maddie felt that her passion was more important than them and didn't have time to babysit them. However, once Maddie realized the dangers they would put themselves in just to spend time with her, she proves that she cares about them deeply and promised to start spending more time with them. 

===Physical appearance===
She is close in age to Sprig and is roughly the same height as him. She is a light blue frog with a lighter underbelly and has a red tongue. Just like the other frogs, she has 4 fingers and 2 toes. Her hair is a light pink with dark pink spots and bulbous in appearance with a small knot pinned with a clothespin on her head, making it look like a mushroom cap. It covers her right eye, but her visible left eye is big and yellow with a vertical pupil. She wears very little; just a black sack dress with a rope for a belt and is barefoot.

In "[[Maddie & Marcy]]", Maddie is shown what she looked like prior to doing magic. She wore a grungy pale yellow dress with a dirty apron. Her hair was better kept with both of her eyes visible and sported a small purple bow on the side of her hair.

In "[[The Shut-In!]]", Anne creates a human version of Maddie in the imagination of her story "Phone-Mo" named '''Haddie'''. She is a human of average height with pale skin, shock white hair that covers her right eye and black eyeliner. She wears a greyish-purple hoodie with thin dark pink horizontal lines and pink strings and cuffs, a purple checkered skirt, a black belt and dirty black boots. She also has a blue pearl bracelet on her left hand, a dull gold bangle on her right hand, and a noticeable tan band-aid on her right knee.

===Abilities===
* '''Charm casting:''' Maddie is well versed in casting spells, albeit small ones and can create ones on the fly.
* '''Baking:''' Being the daughter of a baker, she herself can bake too.

==Role in the Series==
Maddie Flour is the daughter of Mr. Flour, the Wartwood's baker and has three sisters: Lavenger, Rosemary, and Ginger who she used to play with until she became fascinated into dark magic.

In "[[Hop Luck]]", when [[Anne Boonchuy]] and the Plantars came to get the ingredients on how to make a Pizza, starting with Dough, Mr. Flour told them that if they want the Dough, [[Sprig Plantar]] has married his daughter which they accept. She and her father are later present when Anne and the Plantars were in the cage of shame.

In "[[Cracking Mrs. Croaker]]", Maddie was one of the few individuals to tell Sprig of she thinks of [[Sadie Croaker]]. She described how she loves that the old frog smelling like wet leaves and fungus before her father caught her attention of the buns she'd been baking caught on fire.

In "[[Cursed!]]", Maddie was first seen working at her family's stand and rotated her head backwards to give Anne a greeting smile. Also, because of her engagement to Sprig, things have become awkward between them. When Anne tried to end Sprig's engagement to Maddie, she witnessed and became terrified of Maddie baking bread versions of herself and Sprig. This caused Anne to decide to end the engagement through a letter instead. Once Maddie received the letter, she was shocked to hear Sprig wanting to break up with her and left the market, visibly upset.

The next day, Anne and Sprig get cursed, leaving them to believe Maddie cursed them out of revenge for the engagement breaking off. Maddie later came to the Plantars' house to deliver bread for [[Hop Pop Plantar]] and was angry to see Sprig. However, when Sprig apologized for the way, he broke up with her by having Anne to do it for him, Maddie revealed she ended up being fine with the engagement ending and revealed that the curse on Anne and Sprig was not her doing. While looking for the person who cursed Anne and Sprig, Maddie explained how she learned magic to help people and criticized Sprig for being bothered by her creepy appearance and not seeing who she was on the inside.

They follow a magical trail to a shack belonging to the local candy man, [[Barry (Amphibia)|Barry]] who had cursed Anne and Sprig for accidentally bumping into him and ruining his special moonberries, and though Anne and Sprig apologize, Barry refused to lift the curse. Disgusted that Barry would abuse his magic and curse those who truly don't deserve to be severely punished, Maddie engaged Barry in a magic battle. When she ran out of ammo, she took samples of Anne's feathers and Sprig's hair, mixing them together and then grabbed Barry's remaining curse and turned him into a hairy bird, while returning Anne and Sprig back to normal. Maddie refused to turn Barry back, but ultimately changed her mind in exchange for candy after Sprig convinced her to do so. After returning home, Sprig thanked Maddie for lifting the curse and apologized for ending their engagement where they agreed to just remain as friends.

In "[[Sasha's Angels]]", Maddie was chosen along with Wally, Loggle, Mrs. Croaker, and Toadie by Sasha and Anne to reclaim their latest supplies from the Marauders. During the batlle, she turned [[Barry (Amphibia)|Barry]] back into a chicken.

==Trivia==
* It is possible that Maddie has had some unrequited feelings for Sprig prior to the start of the series. However, since the events of "[[Cursed!]]", this was never delved into any further.
* Maddie's hair supposedly resembles a [[Wikipedia:Cortinarius iodes|spotted cort]] (''Cortinarius iodes''), also known as a viscid violet cort.
* When the episode "[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]" was leaked online, a personal message from Maddie was released asking fans to wait for the official release of the episode or else she would curse the viewer into a "turnip with a giant butt".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Radrappy/status/1389663335344316418|title=Maddie Leak Post|website=Twitter|date=May 4, 2021}}</ref>
