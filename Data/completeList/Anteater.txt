The '''Anteater''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series who makes his first and only appearance in the episode "[[Paraguay Parable]]". 



==Background==
===Physical Description===
The anteater is plump with purple fur. He has black eyes with yellow sclera. He also has dark purple ears, legs, and feet and bushy eyebrows.

===Personality===
The anteater is sluggish. He also suffers from frequent flatulence. He is noticeably obese due to his constant appetite. However, he is quite slothful when it comes to finding his own food. Additionally, he is shown to be very scheming, separating [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] from each other over who was the best bug catcher.

==Appearances==
==="[[Paraguay Parable]]"===
After [[Timon]] caught a special bug and showed it to [[Pumbaa]], the anteater promptly ate it. After praising Timon for being such a good bug catcher, Timon and Pumbaa got into an argument over who could catch bugs better. The anteater used this opportunity to host a competition between the two to see who could collect the most bugs.

However, upon Timon and Pumbaa's return, the anteater "counted" their bugs by eating them. Finally seeing through the anteater's plot, Timon and Pumbaa forced him to regurgitate all the bugs he had eaten.

==Trivia==
*Unlike real anteaters, who have long snouts and separate mouths, the anteater's mouth is located at the end of his snout.
