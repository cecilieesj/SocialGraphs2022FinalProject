==Background==
Dahlia is shown to be a woman who tries to fall in love with Chronos. Trying to fall in love with him, she finds a perfect fit to help her get Chronos' attention throughout the short.

==Appearances==
===''[[Destino]]''===
Dahlia is first seen wandering across a daytime landscape where she gazes upon the Chronos statue, dreaming and longing to find someone to fall in love with. Dancing around numerous statues, it turns out that it is actually a dream. Looking at the shadow of a bell tower behind her which reminds her of the dress from her dream, Dahlia then goes into perfect shape with the dress she is wearing just as the statue of Chronos comes to life.

Dahlia, transformed into a dandelion, arrives towards Chronos and transforms back to her normal form and realizes that she is being separated from Chronos. Dahlia summons a flock of birds to help Chronos find a way out of the ruins just as Chronos leaves to find Dahlia to which he has trouble finding her. Dahlia then appears in front of him just as he embraces with Chronos. At the end of the short, Dahlia is seen in the form of a bell tower shown which was shown during the part where she finds the perfect fit.

==Trivia==
*Dahlia is based on Salvador Dalí, or rather is an extension of him.
*Unusual for a Disney character, Dahlia spends much of the film naked.
