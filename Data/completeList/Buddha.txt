'''Buddha''' is a golden retriever puppy who appears, along with his siblings, in the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' film series]].

==History==
Buddha enjoys long and often extended periods of yoga and meditation. He wears a traditional Buddhist collar and usually ends his sentences with "Namaste." He is the calmest of the Buddies and almost never loses his temper. The only time he did lose it was in ''[[Santa Buddies]]'' when [[Puppy Paws]], using his special magical collar, changed Buddha's symbolic statue into a snowman. His religion is Buddhism, regarding his name, and he always tries to teach his siblings the importance of yoga and meditation. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Sam, a young boy who is a yoga class student.
