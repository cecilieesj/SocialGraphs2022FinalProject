==Appearances==
===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===
In the movie, Towser is a dog who lives at Withermarsh. One night, he receives a message from another dog that 15 puppies have been stolen by Jasper and Horace, Cruella's henchmen. His good friend [[Lucy]] the goose comes by and asks him what's going on, to which Towser tells her the news of [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]] stolen all the way from [[London]]. Lucy then points out that the last puppies which were around there were Nellie's puppies and they are now grown up. Towser decides to send the message to his friend the [[Colonel]] at the barn across the street, to which the Colonel gets the message and decides to check the haunted house [[Hell Hall]], formerly known as the Old DeVil Place, where [[Sergeant Tibbs]] the tabby cat heard puppy barking. The Colonel also gives Towser the word to stand by, to which he believes that maybe the Colonel has found something.

Towser isn't seen throughout the rest of the film after this, but he is mentioned by the [[Danny (101 Dalmatians)|Great Dane]] to [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]. He tells them to contact Towser at Withermarsh, and he will direct them to the Colonel who will take them to their puppies at the DeVil Place.

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
Towser is a very minor character in the series, only speaking a single line of dialogue in the first episode, "[[Home is Where the Bark Is]]", and making a couple of non-speaking cameos after that, such as in "[[Prophet and Loss]]" and "[[Twelve Angry Pups]]".

It is mentioned by [[Cadpig]] that one of the hills on the [[Dearly Farm]] is named after him.
