==Role in the Series==
They get separated when Walter loses his antennae in the episode "Walkie Talkie Time". Without his antennae, Walter hears static instead of Gracie's voice. [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] gives him a check-up, finds his antennae gone and calls her diagnosis 'static-osis', then the gang go outside to find it. [[Hallie]] teams up with [[Lambie]], [[Stuffy]] teams up with [[Chilly]], and Doc teams up with Walter. Walter finds his antennae on the grass from the top of the clinic slide and slides down to it. Doc sticks the antennae to him and finally hears Gracie's voice. She is stuck in the strawberry bushes, so the gang hunt for her in there, with her voice helping them along. Stuffy finds Gracie and untangles her, and she and Walter are reunited. Doc's little brother, [[Donny McStuffins|Donny]], and his friend Henry, come along and try out Walter and Gracie and their spy goggles together.
