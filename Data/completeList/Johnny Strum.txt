'''Johnny Strum''' is a one-shot character from the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]''. He is the primary antagonist from the episode "[[The Ballad of Sweet Strings]]".

==Background==
When Pecos Pug is driving Doc Quackers, [[Ella Cowbelle]], and Abigail back to [[Nice and Friendly Corners]], they hear guitar strumming and the stagecoach stops. Johnny introduces himself and demands that everyone give up their stuff before he will let them pass. When everyone refuses, he mesmerizes them with his singing voice and steals all of their possessions. But he ends up breaking his guitar, and everyone snaps out of their trance.

Johnny escapes to Nice and Friendly Corners and catches sight of [[Sheriff Callie]] playing her guitar, Sweet Strings. When Callie turns away, Johnny swipes Sweet Strings and claims it as his new guitar. [[Deputy Peck]] and [[Toby (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Toby]] try to stop Johnny, but they are no match for his velvety voice, and he mesmerizes them into walking right into the jail cell. With the Deputy and his friend out of the way, Johnny goes on a plundering spree, making off with whatever he chooses while everyone is entranced by his voice.

When Callie returns to Nice and Friendly Corners, everyone tells her of how Johnny used his singing to rob the town. After Callie learns that Johnny took Sweet Strings, she confronts him. Johnny uses his singing again, but Callie covers her ears. Johnny then heads off toward Harmony Hills with Callie and [[Sparky (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Sparky]] chasing after her. Callie becomes aware that Johnny will ambush her with his singing, and she decides to challenge him to a singing duel. Callie ends up beating Johnny by singing about how she loves Sweet Strings and then puts the self-loving singing bandit behind bars. Johnny starts sobbing and crying about being outsung.
