'''Trigger and Nutsy''' are two vultures from the film, ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]'', who formerly served as one of the henchmen of [[Prince John]] during [[King Richard]]'s absence. Then, when King Richard returned, they reformed and took orders from King Richard.

==Appearances==
===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===
Trigger and Nutsy are first seen during Prince John's archery tournament. Trigger mans a pie sales booth, while Nutsy helps the Sheriff cheat during the tournament. During the following battle, Trigger attempts to fight using his crossbow to fire at [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]] while he battles [[Captain Crocodile]], but the arrow ricochets between them and he is forced to duck to avoid it. He is then hit by a well-aimed pie courtesy of [[Maid Marian]], before a soldier-powered tent carrying [[Little John]] picks him and several more pies up (all of which hit Little John in the face). Trigger was eventually dropped off on Captain Crocodile after the tent tramples him during an announcement.

Later, Trigger accompanies the Sheriff as he arrests [[Friar Tuck]]. Trigger in particular assists by pulling down the hood of Friar Tuck, who is engaged in battle with the Sheriff, before being smacked away by the now flailing-blind Friar's swings. The Friar's view blocked, the Sheriff is able to chain up Friar Tuck with little trouble, and Trigger keeps his crossbow aimed at Friar Tuck's back as he is escorted away to be incarcerated with the rest of Nottingham's population arrested for defaulting on taxes. Trigger and Nutsy are later seen assisting the Sheriff in setting up the gallows. Nutsy abruptly decides to test the trap door while the Sheriff is standing on it, resulting in the Sheriff falling down and getting stuck, after which he states he now knows how Nutsy got his name. When Robin Hood, disguised as a blind beggar, comes to get information, he and Nutsy are fooled. Despite Trigger's constant warnings to hush, Nutsy blabs a plan to capture Robin Hood by hanging Friar Tuck. Trigger grows suspicious of how much the "beggar" knows, but the Sheriff blows off his concerns.

Afterward, Trigger and Nutsy assist the Sheriff in guarding the jail. Nutsy functions as a watchman and annoys the Sheriff with his constant announcements. Trigger is shown as (correctly) fearing a jailbreak, prompting the Sheriff to urge him to point his crossbow away from him. Trigger tells him not to worry because "the safety's on Ol' Betsy" while patting the weapon. Unfortunately, he is immediately proven wrong when it fires an arrow and they are forced to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge the projectile as it ricochets everywhere, barely missing them and for this, he gets a bonk on the head from the annoyed Sheriff. Moments later, they hear a noise and investigate. While they believe it to only be Nutsy, it is actually a disguised Robin Hood. Trigger later attempts to raise the alarm, after hearing Little John slam the jail door shut, but is ignored by the annoyed Sheriff. Trigger is warned against further "false alarms", and is ordered to return to his patrol with a boot to the posterior for good measure, causing him to yelp in pain in the process.

Trigger later hears a muffled sound and approaches the Sheriff to tell his suspicions, only to realize that the "Sheriff" is actually Little John in disguise (having subdued the Sheriff). He is immediately subdued by Little John so the prisoners can escape.

Trigger and Nutsy are seen at the end of the film, apparently reformed by [[King Richard]]. They are shown guarding the imprisoned Prince John, [[Sir Hiss]], and the Sheriff. When the newlywed Robin Hood and Maid Marian pass by in their carriage, Nutsy orders Trigger to "present arms" which leads Trigger to accidentally fire his crossbow right into a picture of a heart on the back of the wedding carriage.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Trigger and Nutsy make a few cameos in the ''House of Mouse''. They also appear in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.
