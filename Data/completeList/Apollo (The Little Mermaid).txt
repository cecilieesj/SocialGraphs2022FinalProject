}}'''Apollo''' is a minor character who appears in the television series ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]''. He appeared in the episode [[Heroes]].
==Role in the series==
[[King Triton]], and the other residents from [[Atlantica]] are very happy to know that their hero Apollo is returning home since he was seen as Atlantica's greatest hero and Triton's most trusted sea warrior long before Ariel or her sisters were born. 20 years ago during the Sargasso War where the [[Octopid]]s tried to steal land and crops by driving out the merpeople, Atlantica was in a battle between the Octopids who wielded a trident that was more magically powerful than King Triton's [[Trident (The Little Mermaid)|trident]]; due to [[Ursula]]'s magic. Apollo, in the vines, snuck up on them and broke it, causing the Octopids to flee.

After the story, Apollo appears, he, [[Ariel]], and [[Flounder]] go on an adventure to Valhalla, the land of the heroes, going through several dangerous obstacles, Ariel noticed that he did not speak much, and was inclined to give up, Ariel is courageous and curious, and persuades him to continue, when they got there, with [[Ursula]] watching them on the crystal ball, they are captured by the [[Mervikings]], and Apollo tells Ariel that his victory for the Atlanticans was an accident, they only left after the Vikings discovered that he was the Apollo, and the condition was if he defeated the Sea Dragon, Ursula revives the Octopids and gives them eight magic tridents; but Apollo defeats them with his new dragon. Now Apollo is a real hero.
