'''[[File:Lords_of_Illumination.jpg|thumb]]Lords of Illumination''' are a group of characters in ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''.
==Background==
They first appear in "[[The Box (Wander Over Yonder)|The Box]]" posing as different characters to test Wander not to open the box on the arrival to Glen's House (Which is their house). Sylvia forces them to put something in the box and so they give in and put in a piece of string, a penny, a hard candy and a "Number 1 Grandpa" keychain. After Wander and Sylvia leave, one of them tells one Lord that he didn't know he was a grandpa. He respnds that he never asked him about his personal life.

They were seen again in [[The Gift (Wander Over Yonder)|The Gift]], being given a gift as one of them asks "So, what's in the box"?
