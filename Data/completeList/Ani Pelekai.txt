'''Ani Pelekai''' is [[Lilo Pelekai]]'s daughter and [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s niece seen in ''[[Stitch!]]'' She looks exactly like her mother when she was her age to the point that [[Stitch]] fully believed she was Lilo until her mother appeared. It is unknown who her father is.

==Background==
While [[Stitch]] and [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] are biking to school, Stitch notices a girl on the bus who looks exactly like [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]. He catches up with the bus and crashes into the girl, who immediately recognizes Stitch. They hug and rejoice at the meeting, the girl says that she has long wanted to see Stitch. Then the girl's nanny comes, but they ran away from her and spent time together. During this time, [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] followed them and ordered [[Morpholomew]] to turn into an exact copy of the girl in order to distract and catch Stitch. Then the false Lilo tricks and traps Stitch as [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and [[Reuben]] arrive, but they are defeated by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]] and Yuna. Everyone thought that all this time the girl was a fake Morpholomew, but Stitch is sure that he saw the real Lilo then. Yuna decides that this might be true and rushes to see her with Stitch. Gantu and Reuben then turn Morpholomew into a bound Pleakley who pretended to be a prisoner. The girl and Yuna try to save him, but then Lilo arrives, who believes that her daughter played too much and imagined all the adventures that happened during the day. It turns out that all this time the girl's name was Ani, and her mother was Lilo. Later, Stitch runs to the airport where he sees Lilo and Ani for the last time, but Lilo promises that she will be back.

==Trivia==
*In the anime, when Ani and Stitch are spending time together while enjoying themselves, an instrumental of "[[He Mele No Lilo]]" can be heard playing as the background music.
*Ani's surname is "Pelekai", which is also her mother and aunt's surname.
