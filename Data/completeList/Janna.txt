She served as the Queen of the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] until her death due to old age as her granddaughter [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] becomes the new queen of the Tree of Life.

==Background==

==Role in the Series==
===''[[Journey of Memories]]''===
Queen Janna stands beside [[Rafiki]] as he meets [[Makini]] when she was younger in a flashback during the musical sequence "[[As You Move Forward]]" where Makini's parents take their daughter to see Rafiki.

===''[[The Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|The Tree of Life]]''===
Rani decides to ask Janna what happened as she tells Surak and [[Nirmala]] to comfort over Baliyo. She then tells her that the Lion Guard caused a rockslide blocking off the mountain pass as she explains that the Roar of the Elders has finally returned. She also tells Rani to welcome Kion and his friends to the Tree before they are banished forever from the Tree. Later when Rani talks to her [[Sãhasí|deceased]] [[Ãnanda|parents]], they tell her that one day that Rani will become queen when Janna passes away. The [[Lion Guard]], however, are finally welcomed to the Tree of Life.

===''[[The River of Patience]]''===
When Janna hears that the [[Roar of the Elders]] has returned, she asks Rani to welcome [[Kion]] and his friends, Kion tells Janna that he and [[Ono]] have come to be healed. Seeing that Kion and his friends have the [[Mark of the Guard]] she knows that they are from the [[Pride Lands]]. She asks [[Nirmala]], the healing expert, to take a look at them. Janna explains that while healing Ono will be simple, with his remedy being ready in a few days, Kion's ailments will take both time and patience. Wanting to start right away, Kion is led away by Nirmala to begin his healing. In the meantime, Janna asks Rani to show Kion's friends around.

As the rest of the Lion Guard leaves with Rani, she asks Makini to stay. Janna says that she remembers Makini as a little monkey when she came with her parents. Makini tells Janna that Rafiki started her training to become a Royal Mjuzi. Janna says that Makini will continue her training at the Tree of Life.

Janna shows Makini a painting of [[Askari]] the first Lion Guard leader using the Roar of the Elders for the first time.  Remarking its been a while since she's had a Royal Mjuzi with her, Janna gifts Makini with the Bakora Staff of her former Mjuzi. At that point, Kion and Rani show up in the chamber arguing. Rani angrily accuses Kion of leading an [[Makucha's Army|army of predators]] to the Tree of Life, believing they should never have  allowed him to enter it. Remorseful, Kion apologizes for the trouble he has caused as the Queen notes the predators won't leave now that they've found the Tree of Life.

When Kion offers to let the Guard help, Rani loses her temper, yelling that they can handle it. Janna firmly reprimands Rani, who immediately calms down and apologizes. While Janna appreciates Kion's offer, she agrees with Rani that it's the job of the Night Pride to deal with threats to the Tree of Life, telling Kion he must help himself before he can help others. She advises him to continue his healing, pointing its the reason he came in the first place. Back at the Dirisha, Kion gets frustrated waiting for the log, telling Nirmala he'd finish quicker doing things his way as his scar pains him. Nirmala tells Kion to trust her like Janna advised him to.

===''[[Little Old Ginterbong]]''===
Janna welcomes [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]] to the Tree of Life to be "healed" as she was pretending to be a animal with a hurt leg so she can get info on the Tree of Life. However, it is later figured out that Mama Binturong has been playing dirty tricks on the Night Pride all the time. Janna later also heals Ono's eyes to which she warns the egret that the eyesight will never be strong as before.

Her family, Nirmala, and Kion are with her during her final moments as she asks Baliyo and Surak to support Rani once she takes over, and entrusts the power of the Tree of Life to Nirmala. She also grants Kion the [[Mark of the Night Pride]] as a final gift from her in the hopes he'll choose to stay at the Tree of Life after she passes on. After giving some encouraging words to Rani upon seeing how her heart is breaking over her grandmother being on death's door, once Rani accepts her destiny and promises to make her proud, Janna says her final words before completing her journey through the Circle of Life. Upon dying in her sleep, the Night Pride mourns over Janna. Rani, Baliyo, and Surak are heartbroken over her passing, and Kion comforts Rani during her grief.

Makini tells the other animals outside the Tree of Life the sad news about Janna's passing to which, as a tradition, all the animals will gather for her funeral at the Willows to bid a final farewell to the deceased queen and matriarch of the Night Pride. At the Willows, all the other animals have a funeral for Janna, bidding a farewell to her while the attendees (Baliyo, Surak, Nirmala, [[Anga]], and others) share their condolences to her. Afterwards, Rani becomes the new queen of the Tree of Life as she walks over to her grandmother's grave telling her she is ready to be the new queen.

==Trivia==
*Her name means "paradise" in Arabic and Urdu.
*Not counting her appearance when she was a spirit in the series finale, the only time she was seen alive outside the Tree of Life was in the episode "[[Journey of Memories]]". All of her other appearances featuring her alive before her death in "[[Long Live the Queen]]" featured her staying in the Tree of Life.
*Janna slightly resembles Kion's paternal grandmother [[Sarabi]].
* Upon her death in the episode "[[Long Live the Queen]]", Janna is the second character to die in ''The Lion Guard''. This also makes her the second character to die in a Disney Junior show; the first was [[Ushari]]. Unlike Ushari who died gruesomely, Janna died peacefully.
** In that same episode during the scene where the animals attend Janna's funeral at the Willows, the music played during it is the same music that plays in the Season 1 episode "[[Can't Wait to be Queen]]" where [[Pridelanders|Simba's pride]] attends [[Aminifu]]'s funeral at Kilio Valley.
**Furthermore, the scene where she dies peacefully could be the reason why a warning is shown at the start of the episode, where the warning tells viewers that the aforementioned episode contains scenes that deal with the Circle of Life.
*While it is confirmed that Surak unknown who Janna's first-born child is: It could either be Sãhasí or Ãnanda.
