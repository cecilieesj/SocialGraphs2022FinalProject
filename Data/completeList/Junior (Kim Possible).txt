[[File:Junior_Kim_Possible.png|thumb|183px]]'''Junior'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398732/?ref_=tt_cl_t5</ref> (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]])<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Kim-Possible/Junior/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046033/</ref> is a minor character from the animated [[Disney Channel]] show ''[[Kim Possible]]''. He is a regular in detention at [[Middleton High School]]. He appears to get along well with his other detention mates, [[Vinnie]] and [[Big Mike]].
==History==

Junior doesn't appear to be that intelligent. He looks into the detention room asking if it is the assembly, to which [[Steven Barkin|Mr. Barkin]] tells him to sit down because it is detention. Later, after Vinnie states that [[Dr. Drakken]] is using a Gravatomic Ray, Vinnie mixes up the name and calls it a "gravamatromic" ray. Although, in a Ron-esque moment of insight Junior is the one who states that it is a "tiny explosive device" attached to Kim Possible's nose.
==Appearances==
*"[[Tick-Tick-Tick]]"

==Quotes==
''(Junior is intently staring at Kim Possible)''<br />'''Kim''': What?!<br />
'''Junior''': Never been this close to a cheerleader. Your skin is so smooth and zit-free. Like a baby's bottom.<br />'''Kim''': Eww!

==Trivia==
*Although some fans have suggested from Junior's long wavy blond hair he might be Tara's brother, his comment of never being so close to a cheerleader rules it out.
