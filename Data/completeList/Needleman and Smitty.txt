'''Needleman''' and '''Smitty''' are minor characters in the [[2001]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated filmÂ ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''

==Background==
===Personality===
Both Needleman and Smitty sound dim-witted and idiotic, according to their high-pitched monotone voices.

===Physical appearance===
Needleman is very skinny, has light brown skin, a short tail, a large red nose, and two upward-pointing horns on either side of his head. Smitty has light green skin and four arms and resembles a slug. While wearing his hat, Smitty has his orange fin-like hair over one of his eyes, a hairstyle known as emo.

==Roles in the film==
Needleman and Smitty work on the scare floor as general maintenance and errand monsters at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]] They are silly teenaged employees of the company. Needleman sometimes scolds Smitty for saying something he doesn't like or is just being stupid.

Needleman and Smitty really support Sulley in his race to beat the all-time scare record and have a lot of respect for all the scarers on the floor. They shred the door that Claws Ward has used when a kid he had attempted to scare turned out to be unafraid of him. Next they take out the garbage, almost destroying [[Boo]], who manages to get out before they put the garbage in the crushing machine. Later, they and many other monsters surround [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] cheering for him when [[Celia Mae]] announces he just broke the all-time scare record. They are last seen near the entrance to the factory amongst the other monsters watching [[Henry J. Waternoose III|Mr. Waternoose]] get arrested by the [[Child Detection Agency|CDA]]. 

In one of the film [[outtakes]], Smitty mispronounces Sullivan's name as "Solomon" and Needleman tries to tell him that his name is "Sullivan," but the two begin quarreling as they end up ruining the scene and making matters worse. Another outtake shows the duo about to shred the door that Claws Ward has used; the door shredder chews the door, but then takes the two on a wild ride across the scare floor and knocks over the crew equipment.

Needleman and Smitty also appear in [[Mike Wazowski]]'s company play "[[Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me]]" as [[Randall Boggs]] and [[Fungus]], respectively, to which the crowd boos at them for their evil roles. They sing with the rest of the cast at the play's finale.

==Disney Parks==
Needleman and Smitty appear as walkaround characters at one of the Disney parks, as well as [[Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!]] at the [[Disney California Adventure]].
