|quote = }}'''Surge''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who is a mutant female that is part of the [[X-Men (team)|X-Men]], she appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi. Surge is able to absorb electricity at all times: from static in the air, electrical appliances, outlets, etc. She can't control the absorption, and thus must wear specially designed gauntlets at all times to regulate it. She can discharge the energy through powerful lightning-like blasts or channel it into bursts of superhuman speed. If she takes in too much energy, it causes mental overloads which cause her to speak too fast, scatters her thinking, and worsens her control over the blasts. While she was briefly romantically attracted to [[Thor Odinson|Thor]]'s partner, [[Hikaru Akatsuki]], she later chooses to go to the Xavier Institute with [[Wolverine]], after being offered protection by [[Magneto]].
