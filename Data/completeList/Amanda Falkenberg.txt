|quote = }}'''Amanda Falkenberg''' is [[Zuri Ross|Zuri]]'s teacher at Walden Academy, from the show ''[[Jessie (TV series)|Jessie]]''.
She teaches 3rd grade, at first she does not like Zuri because Zuri makes impolite comments about her and her teaching. Zuri describes her as "the meanest teacher in the world" and Jessie describes her as "not good with kids or adults", as even the class gerbil was spelling "help me" in food pellets.

She does not like Jessie either and calls her "Miss Purkey Pants". But later Jessie lies to her about liking Quidditch and Ms. Folkemburg becomes nice and calls Zuri her "star student", but she also becomes "a level 6 clinger" and invites Jessie to play Quidditch with her, but she does not want to keep being her friend so she pretends to like Quidditch. The next day she tries to confess she does not want to be friends, but Folkemburg tells her she is bad at Quidditch and is going to play with Mr. Eitzel because Zuri set them up so Jessie would not have to suffer.
