'''Prince Wazoo''' is a minor character in the Disney animated series, ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]''. He is a suitor for [[Jasmine|Princess Jasmine]] and attempts to marry her, despite her engagement to [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]].

==Role in the episode==
In "[[Do the Rat Thing]]", Wazoo is first trying to get Jasmine to marry him, despite her repeatedly telling him that she's already engaged to Aladdin. When the prince feels Jasmine's hair, a rat shows up and grabs his nose. Terrified of the rat, Wazoo pulls out a dagger, but Aladdin shows up and removes the rat from Wazoo's nose and the prince thanks Aladdin, revealing his fear of rats.

Wazoo reappears with [[the Sultan]], who says that he's going to show him the marketplace. Everyone goes to the marketplace so Wazoo can buy things for Jasmine, treating Aladdin like a servant, the Prince spends time thinking of what to buy. The prince eventually gets bored and makes Aladdin put him on a camel. He then sees a rat version of Jasmine, whom he mistakes for a real rat.

Come nighttime and everyone is having a feast, but they're waiting for Jasmine to show up. Wazoo sees Jasmine, who is still a rat, again and gets scared. After Jasmine returns to normal, she goes to the palace with the Sultan. When Aladdin and Wazoo see that Jasmine still has a rat tail, the prince realizes that the princess is more of Aladdin's type than his and gives up.

==Trivia==
*The character shares an analogous role to [[Prince Achmed]] from the first ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'' movie. They're both snooty mustachioed suitors of [[Jasmine]] and get their pants ripped off by [[Rajah]]. But in comparison to Achmed, Wazoo appears less hostile to Aladdin and more clumsy.
*Wazoo demonstrates that princes are still courting Jasmine despite her being engaged to Aladdin.
*The name, Wazoo, is slang term for buttocks.
