'''Alador Blight''' is [[Amity Blight|Amity]], [[Emira and Edric Blight|Emira and Edric's]] father who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Alador is a middle-aged man with fair skin, pointy ears, messy brown hair, a faint mustache and goatee, thick eyebrows, and golden eyes. As an inventor, he wears a gray lab coat with a light gray belt, light gray shirt, white pants, and dark gray shoes. Due to working with Abominations, his outfit has pink and purple stains.

==Role in the series==
===Season One===
Alador first appeared alongside his wife as a silhouette in "[[Understanding Willow]]". After Amity accidentally setting [[Willow Park|Willow's]] memories on fire, she and Luz were forced to go into her mind to repair them. They encountered Willow's "inner" self, who wanted to attack Amity. Before she could finish her off, Amity revealed the truth as to why she ended her friendship with her. Her parents did not want her to continue being friends with Willow due to their desire of keeping up their reputation. They arranged for [[Boscha]] and Skara, children of their coworkers, to be her new friends, and threatened to ensure that Willow would never be able to attend [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]] if she did not end her friendship with her.

Alador is seen again in a flashback among the crowd watching [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]]'s witches duel in "[[Young Blood, Old Souls]]".

=== Season Two ===
In "[[Escaping Expulsion]]", Alador and his wife are holding an expo for Blight Industries' new abomiton, only for Amity to botch the demonstration to save a photo of herself and her friends, and he stands by as Odalia has Luz, Willow, and Gus expelled. In exchange for Luz helping out with the next expo, Odalia agrees to let the three back into Hexside. Though Alador agreed with Luz's assessment on the successful demonstration of the abomiton 2.0, Odalia was determined to let it continue to prove how relentless his creation was, even if Luz were to be killed in the process. He eagerly watches as Amity holds her own against his creation, in which she reached a new deal: she would throw the fight in exchange for her friends returned to Hexside unconditionally. With their sales about to tank, Odalia had no choice but to agree. After Odalia tries to go back on her word, he berates his wife and says their daughter's friends give her strength. After the expo, he and his wife are approached by [[Hunter|the Golden Guard]], who hires them to make an abomiton army exclusively for [[Emperor Belos]].

in "[[Reaching Out]]", Alador has Amity go to tryouts for the Emperorâ€™s Coven after she insists on participating in the Bonesburgh Brawl, assigning an abomiton to ensure she made it there safely. He later learned she ditched the tryouts after Luz accidentally triggered the abomiton's alarm, and intervenes before Amity could fight [[Warden Wrath]], even restrained him when Wrath attempted to attack. Before he could round up his children, Amity refused to leave and fled using an invisibility glyph. 

Soon after, Edric fed Wrath an altered Blabber Serum that instead caused him to mutate. Alador initially fought Wrath alongside Harpy Eda but refused Amity's help. As his abomiton was supported by Amity's abomination, he attempted to turn her away again but his daughter declared she was making her own choices from now on. They then combined their abominations, restraining Wrath long enough for Luz and Eda to blanket him with snow and restore him to normal.

As he exchanged curt greetings with Eda, he took note of her harpy form, only to be told to deal with his family issues; Eda also added that she knows of the factory incident with Luz and forewarned she was watching him. Talking to his daughter, he learned that Amity had no interest in joining the Emperor's Coven and becomes aware that his obsession with his abomitons has caused him to become disconnected from his own children to the point that he was unaware that Amity was dating Luz. He then complimented Amity's new hair colour and promised to talk to her mother about her decision. He tries to hug her, but she shakes his hand instead. 

In "[[Clouds on the Horizon]]" he becomes suspicious of the Day of Unity, but Odalia silences him. In frustration, Alador sat on a swing set, where he vented to [[King (The Owl House)|King]], disguised as coven scout, on his frustrations with his wife. After vowing to become a better father, he learns the truth of the Day of Unity from King and believed him. They proceed down to Blight Industries and free Amity and her friends. Alador then attempted to tell Odalia everything King told him only realize from her callous expression that she already knew of Belos' plans yet turned a blind eye. Upon hearing that Belos had promised the Blight family a life of royalty, Alador declared she had crossed the line and turned his abomitons on her only for his wife to snatch the remote from him. In the ensuing fight, Kikimora grabs Hunter and escapes in the new Abomitron; Alador exclaimed that the jetpack actually worked.

As Odalia insisted they carry on as if nothing had happened, Alador proceeded to demolish the entire factory and retook his remote, declaring his official resignation from Blight Industries. His wife was initially about to fight but ultimately chose to leave when she realized she was outnumbered and spitefully promised Alador would receive no severance package; he remarked that the whole confrontation was terrifying. 

As Alador volunteered to aid Amity and her friends rescue Hunter, he then turned to Luz, apologizing for Odalia's harshness against her and promised she would always be welcomed at Blight Manor. However, they soon discovered that Gus had swapped Luz and Hunter's appearances during the fight at her request.

In "[[King's Tide]]", Alador piloted the airship as they made their way to the head of the Titan, during which he briefly argued with Hunter over who could get them there faster. As they are ambushed along the way by the Emperor's Coven, Alador berated himself for making his abomitons too powerful. Managing to survive the crash, he stayed behind to hold off the abomitons as Amity and her friends continue to the head.

==Trivia==
*Alador's name means destiny, luck, and more surprising facts. The name Alador evokes diplomacy, correctness, and confidence.
