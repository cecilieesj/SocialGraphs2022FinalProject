Blade was created by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Blade is a strong and tall man dressed in black clothing. Due to being a dhampir, half-human and half-vampire, he possesses fangs that are often concealed.

Due to Blade's nature as a dhampir, his eyes are hurt by sunlight, which is why he always wears sunglasses.

===Powers/Skills===
Blade has all of vampiric powers and none of the weakness (beyond his eyes being hurt by sunlight, and a thirst for blood). He has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, senses, rapid regeneration, nigh-immortality & immunity to sunlight, wooden stakes, silver, garlic, and holy water. He counters his thirst for blood by consuming animal blood, blood from blood banks, and a serum that is similar enough to blood for him to consume.

==Trivia==
*In the Marvel Comics, Eric Brooks was born with his abilities as a vampire when his mother was attack by a vampire while she was pregnant with him, then she died giving birth to him.
