'''Rocha Vaz''' is a Brazilian Toucan millionaire, he is the father of [[Rosinha]], and [[José Carioca]]'s father-in-law. His first appearance was in the comic strip "Zé Carioca: Como Encontrei Meu Grande Amor" ("Zé Carioca: How I Found My True Love") in 1942, scripted by José Carioca by Hubie Karp, illustrated by Bob Grant and Paul Murry and inks by Dick Moore and Karl Karpé.

==Personality==
Vaz does everything to separate [[José Carioca]] from [[Maria Vaz|Rosinha]], as they are dating. He thinks [[Zé Galo]] would be the ideal boyfriend for her. He always seems ambitious and insightful, keeping a very luxurious and careful life. Because he is a member of the high society, he does not want to develop a friendship with [[José Carioca]] and his friends.
