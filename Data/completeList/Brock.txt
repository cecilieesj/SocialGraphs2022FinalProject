'''Brock''' was the A.V. Kid of [[Third Street School]] before handing over his keys to Lance the Pants because he was moving to Portugal. He was originally chosen to be the A.V. Kid in third grade, although tradition said that one can't be an A.V. Kid until fourth grade. He was probably the best A.V. Kid in Third Street School.
