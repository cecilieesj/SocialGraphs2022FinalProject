'''Norex''' was a [[Skrull]] scientist and refugee who operated as [[Talos]]' second-in-command when they infiltrated Planet C-53 (Earth). After evading [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Norex and Talos arranged an alliance with [[Captain Marvel|Carol Danvers]] and [[Nick Fury]]. Later, he is discovered by [[Yon-Rogg]], who kills him after he extracts information from him about the [[Tesseract]] and the location of [[Mar-Vell]]'s laboratory.

== Appearances ==
=== ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' ===
After holding Soh-Larr hostage with the other [[Skrull]]s, Norex helped Talos extract [[Captain Marvel|Carol Danvers]]'s memories. Unfortunely for the Skrulls , she escapes. Together with his superior, [[Talos]] and 2 other Skrulls infiltrate Earth. Carol gives chase to the skrulls but Talos and Norex escape.

Talos and Norex find Carol with [[Nick Fury]], [[Goose]], [[Maria Rambeau]] and [[Monica Rambeau]] at Maria's house. Upon arriving, Talos goes into the house and Norex disguises himself to look like Maria, tricking Monica into thinking that he was her mother.

The Skrulls and the humans have a negotiation about the Skrulls against the [[Kree]].

Once the negotiation was a success, with Carol regaining her true memories, Norex stays and becoming a decoy by disguising as Carol for the real Carol, Talos, Fury and Maria, as well as Goose to be able to find Mar-Vell’s hidden lab ship at space nearby Earth.

On the next day, Norex (disguise as Carol) is confronted by Yon-Rogg. Yon-Rogg was tricked to believe that he was Carol at the start but he eventually realized that he was actually a skrull. Yon-Rogg takes out his twin pistols and shoots Norex, who falls backwards and trips. Yon-Rogg asks Norex if Carol knew about her true memories and that the Kree and Skrulls are in war and Norex nodded. After seeing Norex nod, Yon-Rogg shoots Norex again, ending the Skrull's life.

His sacrifice was not in vain as the distraction is success, with Carol and his allies manage to get into Mar-Vell’s hidden lab ship.
