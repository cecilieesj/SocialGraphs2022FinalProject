The '''Enchanted Tiki Room Birds''' are the singing birds featured in the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]] attraction [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]. 

== History ==

=== Background ===
The populace of birds includes about eight macaws, twelve toucans, six cockatoos, nine forktails and an assortment of other tropical birds.

The leaders of the Tiki Room are four macaws consisting of [[José]], [[Michael]], [[Pierre]], and [[Fritz]]. Japan's alternate versions have also introduced two new sets of macaw emcees, with [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!|Get the Fever!]] featuring Danno, Scats, Buddy, and Lava (a female) and [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Aloha e Komo Mai]] featuring Hau'oli, Manu, Mahina, and Waha Nui.  There is also a bird of note named [[Rosita]], a member of the [[Showgirl Birds]] group who is absent from the original ride and whose absence is often alluded to.  A bird called [[Juan the Barker Bird|Juan]] appeared as a barker for the Tropical Serenade in the [[Magic Kingdom]], similarly to another talking [[Barker Bird|barker parrot]] in the nearby attraction of [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]].

=== Development History ===
When developing the Enchanted Tiki Room, [[Walt Disney]] originally wanted all of the Tiki Room birds to be real macaws in cages at a restaurant.  For a variety of reasons this plan was opted out but it did inspire the birds in the final attraction.

=== Printed Materials ===

==== [[Disney Kingdoms]] ====
In ''[[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]]'', the birds, and flowers gaining an ability to speak human languages is the result of the magic of the Tiki Room itself and this can extend to any animal that enters the room. A migratory bird who finds herself given speech is soon alienated from the rest of their flock and ends up taking part in a rare ceremony with the Tiki Gods to have it undone, though her recounting of the event just before the magic fully takes away her voice is interrupted by squawks.  The [[Orange Bird]] of the [[Sunshine Tree Terrace]] is affiliated with them in this comic.

==== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ====
In ''[[Tales from Adventureland: The Keymaster's Quest]]'', the birds of the Tiki Room are rare magical breeds known as the '''Akamai''' that are capable of human speech and possess great intelligence for birds. The Tiki Room was built by the [[menehune]] as a safe haven for them and the Jungle Exploration Society has committed to further protecting them through constructing an outdoor security system of animated Tiki God sculptures to frighten away superstitious poachers.
