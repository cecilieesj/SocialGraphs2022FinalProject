'''Razor Fist''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'', played by Florian Munteanu. His codename comes from the blade attached to his arm. He works for the [[Ten Rings]] as one of their main agents.

Razor Fist was created by Doug Moench and Gene Day.

== Trivia ==
*A deleted scene from [[Shang-Chi]] and the Legend of the Ten Rings revealed that Razor Fist's real name is Mattias, and that he was adopted by [[Xu Wenwu|Wenwu]] after Shang-Chi had run away.
*In the comic books, Razor Fist had both hands replaced with simple blades, which made life doing anything apart from hand-to-hand combat nigh-impossible for him without help, which is why the MCU version has a blade in only one hand.
