'''Heidi Weinerman''' is [[Howard Wienerman|Howard]]'s very popular older sister and the host of [[Norrisville High]]’s #1 Me-Cast:Heidi@School! She’s tall, beautiful, popular and on the cutting edge of pretty much everything. She is voiced by [[Cassie Scerbo]].

==Character Description==
Heidi Weinerman is Howard's older sister and the host of Norrisville High’s ''Heidi@School'', where she updates everyone on what's happening at school. Her show includes a [http://www.randycunningham9thgradeninja.wikia.com/wiki/Gossip_Report Gossip Report] where Howard almost revealed Randy's secret identity as the ninja. She seems unable to remember Randy's name and calls him a name that sounds similar to him, such as "Andy" or "Sandy".

===Personality===
She is on the cutting edge of pretty much everything. She apparently likes attention and publicity since she spends most of her time on her show. She does not get along well with her younger brother, Howard, since she was annoyed when he came to ask her for lunch money in "[[Gossip Boy]]" and threatened to embarrass him if he and Randy would ruin the Norrisville High Talent Show in "[[So U Think U Can Stank]]". At first she believed that Howard knew the ninja's identity but got angry at him when he supposedly didn't.

===Appearance===
Heidi is thought to be tall and beautiful. She has medium length orange hair with a red hairclip and blue eyes. Her casual clothes include a beige blouse with a red collar and cuffs. She also wears a red skirt and white stockings with red shoes. She also wears a red hair clip on her right side.

==Relationships==
===[[Howard Weinerman]]===
She does not get along well with her younger brother, Howard, annoyed when he came to ask her for lunch money, and threatened to embarrass him if he and Randy would ruin the Norrisville High Talent Show. At first she believed that Howard knew the Ninja's identity, but got angry at him when he supposedly didn't, saying she knew he hadn't. She is rude and impolite to her brother and likes to challenge and insult him. Both of them enjoy popularity but she is far better at getting and keeping it. She doesn't seem to care about Randy when she's around him and Howard, showing how little she cares about her brother and anything involving him.

===[[Randy Cunningham]]===
Although he says he's known Heidi his whole life, she seems to barely know him and always forgets his name, calling him "Andy", "Sandy", "Mandy", "Tandy" or "Rudy". She doesn't seem to care about him in the least whether he is with or without Howard. She is willing to make use of him, though if it's to her benefit. She uses him as a back up judge when Bash betrays her. Randy explains that his and Howard's escape isn't Heidi's fault, impressing Heidi so much that she thanks him--although, much to Randy's chargin, she still forgets his name. She also gives him credit, albeit messing his name up again, for apologizing to Theresa and giving her flowers in "[[Shloomp! There It Is!]]". However, she is disturbed when Randy--who at the time was NomiRandy--flirts with her.

When Randy is the Ninja, Heidi is very fond of him. She sings a song about him for the Battle of the Bands, and she usually has nothing bad to say about him, unlike his other identity.

===[[Theresa Fowler]]===
While Heidi doesn't interact much with Theresa before "Shloomp! There It Is!", she is affected when [[NomiRandy]] ignores Theresa to flirt with her. When Theresa is stanked, Heidi becomes her target, much to Heidi's horror. She even tells Theresa that she barely knows "Andy," but it only angers Theresa because she said Randy's name wrong. Captured by Thersa, Heidi pleads to her to not hurt her because they're total biffers, although once the Ninja shows up, Heidi tells him to waste her. Since then, Heidi and Theresa can be seen chatting in the backgrounds of "[[Welcome Back Catfish]]", "[[M-M-M-my Bologna]]" and "[[Mastermind of Disastermind]]" suggesting that they might be friends.
