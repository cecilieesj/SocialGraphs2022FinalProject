'''Moon-Boy''' is a Homo habilis child who lives in an alternate universe in Marvel Comics with [[Devil Dinosaur]].  He appears in season 2 of ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode Days of Future Smash: The Dino Era, where he exists in an alternate timeline where Leader made dinosaurs intelligent and [[Hulk]] was fighting Leader in the Mesozoic, the other Agents of S.M.A.S.H. members experience a timeline shift where dinosaurs are intelligent and civilized. During this time, they had to save Moon-Boy from [[Sauron|King Sauron]]'s forces led by General Thunder Lizard Rossasaurus at the time when King Sauron was going to exterminate the primitive humans. With help from El Diablo (an intelligent version of Devil Dinosaur) and Spider-Raptor, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. were able to save Moon-Boy and overthrow King Sauron. Moon-Boy then befriends El Diablo. After Hulk thwarts Leader's plans in the Mesozoic era, the timeline is shifted to another timeline.  He would latter make a short Cameo in [[Avengers Assemble]] season 4 episode Westland as a image on a Wanted Poster and appears again in the next episode The Wastelands, helping out the Avengers while riding his partner Devil Dinosaur.
