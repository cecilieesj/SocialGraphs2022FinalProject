==[[The Great Rift]]==
King Zahbar was the ruler of Mesmaria who was turned into a hawk and continue searching for his wife [[Queen Deluca]] who was curse by the Green Emerald of Khufu, centuries ago with her brothers who escaped from the monster known as [[The Great Rift (character)|The Great Rift]] that would've destroyed Mesmaria into dust.

This went on until Aladdin discovered the chest that she and her brothers are locked up. King Zahbar gets hold of the emerald bringing his queen to life by sunlight as Aladdin and his friends take the chest with the remaining jewels to Agrabah. She transformed King Zahbar into a very, huge and giant hawk to get rid of Aladdin and the gang but by doing as she commanded him to. She travels to Agrabah to get the remaining gems and revive her three brothers by flying unto him in flight. Because Mesmaria was destroyed by The Great Rift, they’ve took over Agrabah. When the Sultan objected and forced Queen Deluca to get out of the palace, he’s turned into a jewel, after she called him an old man. When Jasmine went up against Queen Deluca, she was the next one to be turned into a gem and kicked them out of the palace, tossing them into Abu’s hat to catch it.

The evil queen drew plans to take over the Seven Deserts. However, her brothers did not like the idea of her becoming the most powerful ruler of Agrabah, the siblings start arguing ending up using their magic against each other. This caused the mysterious Great Rift to appear and it is in the form of a transparent, green monster with red eyes, and fangs of a saber-toothed cat. Aladdin discovered and tried to tell that the monster that fed on anger from the Mesmarians as they don’t listen and continue fighting each other, destroying the palace. Aladdin seeks the help of King Zahbar, the only Mesmarian not affected by the emeralds. He tells Aladdin that the emeralds have great magic as well as great anger causing the Great Rift to be disappeared. As a team, Aladdin, Iago, Genie, Carpet and Abu take Queen Deluca’s emerald and destroy it, until the brothers’ emeralds are depowered. After Queen Deluca was no longer evil again, the spell was broken and Sultan and Jasmine has returned to normal again and King Zahbar returns to his human form and the whole gang welcomes them to Agrabah at the end.
