'''Gar Saxon''' is a [[Mandalorian]] super commando who appears in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. During the Clone Wars, he worked for the Shadow Collective led by [[Maul]] until he joined the [[Galactic Empire]] after the collective was dissolved.

==Role in the series==
In his debut "[[Imperial Super Commandos]]", Gar Saxon and his men attacked the Protectors, a Mandalorian clan led by Saxon's rival, [[Fenn Rau]], in the Concord Dawn system. All the Protectors were killed, with the exception of Fenn Rau, who was captured by the Rebels. Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper, accompanied by Fenn, journeyed to Concord Dawn because the lack of communication from the Protector, where Saxon captured [[Ezra Bridger]]. Saxon understood that Ezra was a Rebel. He tried to lie his way out, but Saxon was not an easy fool. He threatened to shoot [[C1-10P|Chopper]] if Ezra continued to deny. Ezra used Force to deflect Saxon's shots on Chopper but that also betrayed him and Saxon understood that he was a Jedi. [[Sabine Wren]] saved Ezra and briefly escaped until Fenn Rau fled with their ship. Bringing the three Rebels together, Saxon recognized Sabine and offered her to join the Empire with her mother. Sabine, Ezra, and Chopper attempted to escape, but Saxon and his men gave chase. Saxon engaged in a fight with the girl until the intervention of Fenn Rau, who had returned after a change of heart.

Later in "[[Legacy of Mandalore]]", Saxon arrived at Krownest where he took the [[Darksaber]] and fought against Sabine, who was armed with Ezra's lightsaber. She succeeded in defeating Saxon and spared him. Saxon tried to shoot her in the back but [[Ursa Wren|Ursa]] shot him right in the heart killing him.

==Trivia==
*Saxon's first named appearance was in the unproduced ''The Clone Wars'' story arc that was later published as the comic book series ''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''.
*Pablo Hidalgo has described Saxon as "the quintessential sellout" willing to serve any master who can advance or secure his own position.
