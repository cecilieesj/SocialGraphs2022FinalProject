'''Karen''' is a character featured in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Connelly]]. She is the artificial intelligence built into Peter's [[Spider-Man]] costume, and she is modeled after [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.]].

Just like them, Karen is polite, friendly and gentle, and acts as a best friend and confidante to Peter, mentoring in his role as Spider-Man and providing him with useful advice for his everyday life. It is Peter himself who comes up with Karen's name, after calling her "Suit Lady" several times.

==Trivia==
*Karen is voiced by [[Jennifer Connelly]], who is married to [[Paul Bettany]], who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S. and plays [[Vision]].
