He is designed to be an ultimate killing monster and has enhanced his body with cybernetics at some point after escaping imprisonment. He appears as a minor antagonist in the second season of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Experiment 000's resemblance was close to a purple version of [[Stitch]]. Originally 100% organic, Experiment 000 is now a cyborg, part machine, part alien. His organic body now black while the rest is mostly metal alloys and reinforced plastic. His form resembles a cross between a type of lizard and koala (and robot). He has a two cyborg arms, three spider-like legs, and half-helmet with a cyclonic-like right eye from some unknown incident. His cyborg arms serve many purposes such as cybernetic wiry rope, laser guns, a forked harpoon and welding tool, and his cyborg eye has zoom functions and improves his aim. In cyborg form, he is missing his nose.

===Powers and abilities===
In his original form, Experiment 000 has all the powers of Stitch. In his cyborg form, his cyborg arms serve many purposes such as cybernetic wiry rope, laser guns, a forked harpoon and welding tool, and his cyborg eye has zoom functions and improves his aim. He can manufacture many weapons such as android minions, spaceships, and a doomsday device (supernova warhead).

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch!]]''===
He was the first experiment created before [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] started assigning numbers to his experiments, though Jumba later refers to him as "Experiment Zero" in his eponymous debut. Jumba was attempting to create the ultimate killer monster, and he was successful. However, his success also resulted in him being unable to control the experiment. Eventually, Jumba was forced to suspended Experiment 000's cell activity and imprison him on an icy planet. Experiment 000 was eventually able to escape and acquired mechanical body parts, making him even more powerful, and became a ruthless warlord with a cyborg army in the galaxy. 

When Experiment 000 targets Hanpipi Nebula, the [[Grand Councilwoman]] contacts [[Stitch]] to help defeat him. Experiment 000 puts up a fight at first, but he was eventually defeated and captured by Stitch. Once restrained, Experiment 000 reveals he has a supernova warhead and then initiates its launch toward the Grand Council's headquarters on [[Planet Turo]], threatening the entire galaxy. Stitch was able to redirect the warhead into a black hole forming nearby, saving everyone. It is unknown where Experiment 000 was taken after his defeat.

==Trivia==
*Cyber is the first experiment to be created by Jumba before he began working with Hämsterviel and numbering his genetic experiments, so Cyber is classified as Experiment 000. However, he is instead referred to as Experiment 0, given that the number is a single digit rather than a whole three-digit.
**Cyber was never referred to by his name and is instead referred to as Zero or Experiment 0.
*Cyber is similar to [[Dark End]] but not different from [[627]] and [[Leroy]], as while the latter pair were unable to be rehabilitated, the former pair were never mentioned to be able to be rehabilitated. Regardless, Cyber and Dark End most likely would be unable to reform, as Cyber proved to be uncontrollable after being created, while Dark End is loyal to [[Delia]].
**Cyber and Dark End also serve as dark versions of [[Stitch]], with Cyber being too difficult to control where he disregarded the notion of family, and Dark End having a low opinion on family and friends. Cyber and Dark End both serve as what Stitch would have become if he had never met [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and been introduced to the meaning of family.
*Due to being imprisoned on an icy planet for countless years, Cyber didn't know that there were experiments created after him, as he was surprised to see Stitch and asked him who he is.
*He is one of the few experiments that are actually villains, along with [[Chopsuey]], 627, Leroy and [[Leroy Clones|his clones]], and Dark End, while all the other experiments were following their primary function.
