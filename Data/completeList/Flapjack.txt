'''Flapjack''' was [[Hunter]]'s red cardinal [[Palisman]] who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Flapjack was inquisitive and free-spirited, as well known to be curious. He was loyal and persistent, initially following Hunter and remaining by his side despite his protests at first. He is intelligent and helpful, as well as caring, especially towards his bonded witch. Always there to guide Hunter in the right direction and helps him befriend [[Willow Park|Willow]] and [[Gus Porter|Gus]]. Flapjack is also shown to be reserved when it comes to his past, avoiding the subject when Hunter asks about it.

===Physical appearance===
Flapjack was a bird-shaped palisman, similar to a northern cardinal, with a scar where his left eye would be. He has red feathers with dark red wingtips, a dark red beak, dark brown feet, and a black face.

==Trivia==
*The term "flapjack" has origins dating back to as early as the beginning of the 16th century. It is formed from the words "flap" and "jack" (an object) to mean the process of baking by flipping and catching, hence it being a synonym for pancake.
**His name was hinted in "Eclipse Lake", but was never mentioned until it was said on-screen by Hunter in "[[Hollow Mind]]".
