'''Saddlesore Swanson''' is a character from [[Disney Parks]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Saddlesore Swanson is a scraggly anthropomorphic turkey from the old romantic days of the American west.  He would be a resident of [[Chickapin Hill]] following its flooding and live amongst its critters.

=== Development History ===
Saddlesore Swanson was created for the attraction [[America Sings]] in [[Tomorrowland]] where he was one of its Old West characters.  When America Sings closed in the 1980s, he was amongst the audio-animatronics moved to the new [[Critter Country]] attraction, [[Splash Mountain]].

As of [[2020]], Splash Mountain has been announced for closure due to its [[Song of the South|history of embellishing racism]].  It is unknown at time of writing what will become of Saddlesore's figure.

== Appearances ==

=== America Sings ===
Saddlesore appeared in the third act of America Sings, themed around the old west.  The turkey had the third musical number in this scene, singing, "''The Old Chisholm Trail''" where he recounted his troubles.

=== Splash Mountain ===
Saddlesore appeared in Splash Mountain albeit with a few design alterations.  He lost his spurs, was given a straw-hat in-favour of his cowboy hat, and had a guitar made from a turtle shell.  He could be found in the subterranean, "Laughin' Place" singing [[Everybody's Got a Laughing Place|''Everybody's got a laughing place'']] along with a [[Singing Geese|singing goose]] and a chicken.
