'''Carlos''' is a blue frog first introduced in [[Muppet Babies (series)|Muppet Babies]].

==Appearances==
Carlos is a frog who visits The playroom in the ''[[Muppet Babies (series)|Muppet Babies]]'' episode "[[Frogs of a Feather]]." As a visitor for the day, [[Fozzie]] takes Carlos under his wing and comes up with some activities to do. He claims that since he knows everything about [[Kermit]], he knows all about frogs and mistakenly assumes Carlos likes all the same things. Carlos sings "[[The Lily Pad Blues]]" as a lament over his new friends' misunderstanding, and "[[What This Frog Likes]]" in response to their attempt to get to know him better.

In the episode "[[Frog Scouts]]," it is revealed that Carlos, along with Kermit and [[Robin the Frog|Robin]], is part of a scout troop of the Frog Scouts lead by [[Mr. Manny]].
