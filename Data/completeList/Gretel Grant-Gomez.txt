== Trivia ==
*Gretel is the first character to be voiced by Meli Povemire, daughter of [[Dan Povenmire]], the creator of ''Hamster & Gretel''. She was cast after being brought in to do scratch work. When the show was picked up, every actor was recast except for Meli.<ref name="Interview" />
*Dan Povenmire confirmed that Gretel has ADHD, making her the first Disney Television Animation protagonist to be confirmed as ADHD,<ref name="Interview">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqMXqZQW6Cg Meli & Dan Povenmire Interview for Hamster & Gretel at Comic-Con]</ref> as opposed to others being implied or ambiguous such as [[Sprig Plantar]], [[Luz Noceda]], and [[Cricket Green]] from ''[[Amphibia]], [[The Owl House]],'' and ''[[Big City Greens]]'', respectively.
*Gretel is similar to Phineas Flynn in many ways:
**Both are constantly upbeat, chipper, and optimistic.
**Both are styled more uniquely than the rest of the cast (Phineas has a big head shaped like a triangle; Gretel has a more round head, broader mouth, and bigger eyes that are oval-shaped with visible pupils).
**Both do most of the talking out of the main duo.
**Both don't have their eyebrows show as much.
*In the original elevator pitch art, Gretel's headband in superhero gear was pink to match her suit, but in the actual show, her headband is blue.
