==Roles in the film==
The two arrive at [[Litwak's Arcade]] and decide to play ''[[Sugar Rush]]'', with Swati at the wheel, playing as [[Vanellope von Schweetz]], and Nafisa rooting her on. Unbeknownst to them, inside the game, [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] has altered the game's race track in order to help his friend Vanellope bring some spontaneity into her life. As Vanellope steers onto Ralph's track, acting independently of the player, Swati tries to regain control of the wheel with Nafisa watching worriedly, leading to a struggle and tug-of-war that ultimately ends with Swati accidentally yanking the wheel out of the console.

When the two girls bring this problem to Mr. Litwak's attention, he attempts to put the wheel back on, but only succeeds in breaking it in half, leading ''Sugar Rush'' to get unplugged and face being thrown away. Mr. Litwak explains to them that he can't order a new one because the company that made Sugar Rush went out of business years ago, so Swati searches the internet for a replacement steering wheel and finds one on [[Ebay|eBay]], which she shows to Mr. Litwak, but he says it's too expensive for him, prompting Ralph and Vanellope to journey into the [[Internet]] in order to raise money for the wheel and save ''Sugar Rush'' from being unplugged. After several misadventures and some help from new friends, they succeed.
