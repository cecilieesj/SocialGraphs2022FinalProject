He is the schoolteacher of [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]] himself at least in one class.

==Background==
Mr. Woolensworth is shown to be doing roll calls whenever his students are present in class. As a teacher, he does not tolerate any student doing inappropriate behavior according to him. In addition, he is shown to be sensitive to anyone who sneaks up on him as it can embarrass him; for instance, he was shocked whenever Abby Mallard snuck up on him. Whenever class begins, he tells his students to do their assignment by translating each word into mutton.

==Role in the film==
Mr. Woolensworth is seen doing a roll call to know if his students are present in class. Later when he knows Chicken Little is absent, he then begins class where he tells the class to translate each page into mutton, which is the sound of bleating like an actual sheep. He is later seen during the end of the film watching Little's movie to which he likes it and later during the credits singing [[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]] where he sings one of the lines with one of his students saying "Baa", still translating as mutton.
