'''Leo''' is the main protagonist of ''[[Little Einsteins]]''. At 6 years old, he (along with [[June]]) is the oldest member of the group and the Little Einsteins' leader. He pilots Rocket, and he is also [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]]'s older brother.

==Background==
===Appearance===
Leo has red spiky hair, large teal glasses, and green eyes. He wears a black short-sleeved t-shirt which has an orange streak, orange cargo shorts with large pockets, white socks, and orange and black sneakers.
===Friends===
His friends are [[June]], [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]] (his sister), [[Quincy]], and [[Rocket (Little Einsteins)|Rocket]]. He also has other friends, but some are not human (for example, one of his friends is a bumblebee from Africa). 

==Disney Parks==
Leo made an appearance as a puppet in [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]] (back when the Little Einsteins segment was part of the show) located in the [[Animation Courtyard]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

Also, he made meet-and-greets with people, just like the other Little Einsteins, except Rocket.

==Trivia==
*He is the only member of the Little Einsteins to wear glasses.
*His skills with the baton include the ability to conduct animals (seen in ''[[Little Einsteins: Our Huge Adventure|Our <s>Big</s> Huge Adventure]]'', where he conducts cows and The Song of the Unicorn).
*His main talent is conducting and his most precious object is his conductor's baton; he never leaves home without it.
*Although he is only six years old, he is tall, in fact, he is taller than Quincy and his little sister Annie (she is the smallest). But June is as tall as him, but although she is tall she is small.
* In "[[Rocket's Firebird Rescue]]", Leo was granted Music Power and may have it permanently.
* In "[[A Galactic Goodnight]]", Leo says that he uses his baton as a nightlight every night, which helps him fall asleep.
* In the episode "[[The Christmas Wish]]", Leo's wish was a new baton head.
* He is the only character on ''Little Einsteins'' revealed to have a full name: Leonardo.
** He prefers his friends to call him Leo.
*He is named after famous conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] (April 18th, 1882 – September 13th, 1977) from the Disney Classic Movie of 1940's called "[[Fantasia]]".
