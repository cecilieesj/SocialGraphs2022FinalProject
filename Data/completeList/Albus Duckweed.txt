'''Albus Duckweed''' is a supporting character in the [[2019]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Albus is a dignified individual who feels that he has a better outlook than most people. He openly voices his opinion on things, mostly food, and openly belittles those he feels do not meet his standards. Despite this, he does have a sense of individuality as he does not like being pampered to or given special treatment and wants to be seen as a normal person like everyone else. He is also shown to be very sociable with people as he often hosts various events such as the Firefly Festival ("[[Dating Season]]") and the mayoral run ("[[Hop-Popular]]").

===Physical appearance===
Albus is a light green newt with a pale green underbelly and four fingered hands. He has a long tail that has darker green spots on it. He has big round pale blue eyes with violet pupils and turquoise hair that is slightly long and tied into a ponytail with a purple ribbon.

He wears black pants, a navy-blue undershirt and a purple waistcoat. He wears a pair of matching purple dress shoes and a black hat.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Lily Pad Thai]]", Albus makes his debut where he criticizes [[Stumpy]] for serving him only fly in his soup, only for [[Anne Boonchuy]] to show up and defend Stumpy and his restaurant. When Albus taunts her, Anne challenges him; give her and Stumpy two days to turn the diner around and Albus will have to give a positive review, if not he will give a negative one and shut down Stumpy's business, which Albus agrees to.

Though Anne and Stumpy are to fix up the restaurant and give it a makeover, a disguised Albus arrived at the newly opened restaurant to check out the huge improvements, but stubbornly decides to give the restaurant a bad review anyhow. This causes Anne and Stumpy to cook up a Kraken and serve it to Albus specifically, but once they bring it to the table, it comes alive and starts attacking everyone. Anne and Stumpy team up by first spraying its eye with lemon juice and then killing it with a meat masher. After the attack, Albus suddenly changes his mind as he found the experience of food trying to eat you as artful and decides to give the restaurant a positive review instead.

In "[[Children of the Spore]]", Albus is shown to be mind-controlled by [[Apothecary Gary]] but is later freed by [[Bessie (Amphibia)|Bessie]] when ate all the mushrooms.

==Trivia==
*Albus uses a message board in Amphibia which is a literal message board due to the fact that computers do not exist, that is until the episode "[[Fort in the Road]]".
*Albus's name is similar to the name "Albus Dumbledore" from the ''Harry Potter'' series.
