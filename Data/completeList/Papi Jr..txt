==Appearances==
===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]''===
Papi Jr. is [[Papi]] and [[Chloe]]'s only son, along with his sisters, [[Lala (Chihuahua)|Lala]], [[Rosa]], [[Ali]], and [[Pep]], which their parents try to keep up with. His father, Papi, tells Papi Jr. and his sisters some incredible tales about the heroic Chihuahua. However, his father embellishes his stories to the point in which Papi Jr. and his sistersÂ end up causing mayhem. Later on, Papi Jr.'s mother, Chloe, along with Papi, [[Delgado]], and [[Pedro (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Pedro]] (Papi's adoptive brother), participate in a dog fashion show so they can win a large cash prize that would save [[Sam Cortez|Sam]] and [[Rachel Ashe|Rachel]]'s family home. 

Eager to help out with Delgado's deep situation concerning his sons, [[Alberto and Antonio]] (whom he had abandoned as puppies at a police station for protection), Papi Jr. and his sisters venture out and find some [[Robbers|bank robbers]] who had stolen a large sum of money. Papi Jr. and his sisters stow away in the money bags, but are later discovered by the robbers. Papi and Chloe, along with Pedro and Delgado, come to the puppies' aid and are able to defeat the bank robbers. Papi scolds Papi Jr. and the kids for running off, but Chloe tells Papi that they did manage to capture the robbers and were trying to save their home, so Papi lets them off lightly. Thanks to the puppies, they were awarded more than enough money to save their house and live happily ever after.

===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3: Viva la Fiesta|Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3]]''===
Papi Jr. appears in ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3'', but his role is much smaller. He accompanies his parents and sisters as they travel to Langham when Sam and Rachel decide to start their own life.
