She is the Royal Seamstress who wants to join the Royal Guard.

==Role in the Series==
In "[[Changing of the Guard]]", when Elena needs a sparring partner that will help fight against attacking pirate ships, a seamstress named Antonia Bello shows up. After noting she has some skill with a sword, Elena asks Antonia to be her sparring partner. Antonia displays impressive skill with a sword. Elena asks her if she ever considered becoming a Royal Guard. Antonia sadly replies she has but can't as women aren't allowed to be Guards. Elena says that that's not true. Antonia replies by asking why there are only men in the Royal Guard. Elena informs Antonia she can sign up and Antonia asks where.

At the harbor, recruits are signing up for Royal Guard training, two of which are an arrogant recruit named Rocco Villalobos and his dimwitted brother Nacho, in which Elena arrives and presents Antonia as a recruit. Contrary to Elena's expectations, [[Gabe Núñez|Gabe]] doesn't mind that she's a girl who wants to join the Royal Guard as her father was Rodrigo Bello, an excellent soldier. For the first challenge, they have to get through an obstacle course. Antonia has trouble but Elena encourages her not to give up. The next day, Antonia kicks Rocco's butt during fencing and outstrips him in the jungle course. Furious, Rocco deliberately lies to the others to trick them into leaving her behind. This causes everyone to fail. Knowing they left her behind, Antonia is prepared to call it quits.

The next day, Elena convinces Antonia to not quit and they head off to join the other recruits. This is fortunate as they are being attacked by pirates. Antonia saves everyone with her impressive skills. Gabe tells Rocco and Nacho they aren't cut out to be Royal Guards as Antonia and the other recruits are welcomed into the Royal Guard.

In "[[Crash Course (Elena of Avalor)|Crash Course]]", after Gabe gains the desire to have his guards learn magic believing they will be more effective with it, she and the other guards seek out help from The Great Bronzino in order to learn magic due to [[Mateo]]'s apparent poor lessons, only to discover Mateo is the better teacher when he shows them how to undo a gingerbread spell on the castle, and they cheer for him.

In "[[The Lightning Warrior]]", she brings [[Victor Delgado|Victor]] and [[Carla Delgado|Carla]] to the trial room.

In "[[To Queen or Not to Queen]]", she is shown in [[Zuzo]]'s alternate reality, and is inspired there by Elena to rise up against [[Chancellor Esteban|King Esteban]].

In "[[Coronation Day]]", she aids Team Avalor in defeating [[Ash Delgado]]'s villainous group, still armed with her tamborita. She dances with [[Ixlan]] at Queen Elena's coronation.
