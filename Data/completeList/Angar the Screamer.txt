He only appears in the episode "[[One of Us]]." Angar developed throat cancer, he underwent an experimental treatment to cure his cancer. The energy that bombarded his vocal chords destroyed the tumors, but changed his voice. Since then, his voice carried the power to put anyone that hears it, even a whisper, into a catatonic state. When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] took notice of this, they registered him in the Gifted Index and decided he was too great a threat to those around him. S.H.I.E.L.D. put a muzzle around his face that prevented him from talking, and imprisoned him in the secret sub-basement of the Brynmore Psychiatric Facility in [[Ohio]].

Angar remained there until [[Calvin Zabo|Cal Zabo]] and his team broke him out to recruit him into their crusade against S.H.I.E.L.D. and its director [[Phil Coulson]]. With his team assembled, Cal took them to Manitowoc, [[Wisconsin]], Director Coulson's home town. Angar stepped into the middle of the local high school's football field, and let out a loud scream, which dropped all of the nearby students (as well as the birds flying overhead) into a catatonic state. Cal had the members of his team hold the students hostage until Coulson turned himself over to them.

When Coulson arrived and walked on to the middle of the field to surrender, it was Angar who confiscated his gun. Cal came onto the field to face Coulson in person, but before anything could happen, another S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Melinda May, also entered the field with Cal's daughter [[Quake|Daisy]] at gunpoint. Cal threatened to put the entire town down, and gave a microphone hooked up to the field's speakers to Angar. Before Angar could make a sound, Cal was whisked away by a Gordon, and Coulson used the distraction to make a surprise attack on Angar. Coulson took back his gun, and incapacitated Angar before he could make a sound. Angar and the rest of Cal's team were then taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.
