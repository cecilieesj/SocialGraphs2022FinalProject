'''Admiral Grimmitz''' is a character from ''[[DuckTales]]''. He is the Navy commander on the aircraft carrier that [[Donald Duck|Donald]] is an enlisted sailor on. He always gets annoyed at Donald's accident-proned stunts, and likes to play with military equipment that makes things "go ka-blooey."

He was voiced by [[Peter Cullen]], and the voice was based on that of John Wayne (much like how he did so with Optimus Prime). His name is based on United States Navy Admiral [[Wikipedia:Chester Nimitz|Chester Nimitz]], who commanded American naval forces in the Pacific during World War II.
