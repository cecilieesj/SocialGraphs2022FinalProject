The '''Jaguar King''' is a jaguar who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. 

==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==
He only appears in "[[Heart of the Jaguar]]". [[Princess Isabel]] makes it to his castle and meets him. She offers to trade the crown jewel for the heart of the jaguar around his neck, but he rejects the offer due to her acting like a meek coward. The Jaguar King decides to keep Elena (who got transformed into a baby jaquin). Isabel tries to escape with Elena, but she shrinks and Elena flies back to the king. The Jaguar King opens a trap door and Isabel drops down.

When tiny Isabel makes it back with restored confidence, she bravely orders him to release Elena and she grows back to normal size. The Jaguar King becomes impressed and reveals he was just testing her to see if she could stand up for herself and her sister. Isabel trades the crown jewel for the heart of the jaguar and passes her test.
