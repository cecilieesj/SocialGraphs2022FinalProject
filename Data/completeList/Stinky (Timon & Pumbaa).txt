==Appearance==
Stinky is a stinkbug (hence his name) with blue skin and black hair with a Beatles hairstyle.

==Role in the series==
Stinky used to be a drummer in a band with three other bugs, but was kicked out because of his smell. He eventually got frozen and was found by [[Pumbaa]] who was going to eat him, but changed his mind when he found out he was a stinkbug and befriended him instead. When Stinky sneezes from catching a cold, Pumbaa leaves to get firewood for the fireplace while Stinky lies on a table.

The three bug band mates later appear, apologize to Stinky, and let him back into the band. Seconds later, [[Timon]] arrives and eats a bug that a spider gives him just as Pumbaa comes back asking where Stinky is, causing Timon to think that the bug he ate was Stinky.

Timon then lies to Pumbaa, saying that a bear had broken into their cabin and took Stinky. Later, when Timon and Pumbaa are about to be eaten by three bears, Stinky is once again kicked out of the band. He ends up sneezing so hard, he falls over and makes a huge snowball, causing the bears to go away and thus saving Timon and Pumbaa. Timon apologizes to Pumbaa for lying to him and becomes Stinky's friend. Stinky then suggests to a hungry Timon and Pumbaa to eat his former band mates.

==Trivia==
*Stinky and his band mates are presumably a parody of {{WikipediaLink|The Beatles}} as they have similar hairstyles to the band and speak with Liverpudlian accents.
*Stinky is probably based on {{WikipediaLink|Ringo Starr}} as they are both drummers in their bands.
