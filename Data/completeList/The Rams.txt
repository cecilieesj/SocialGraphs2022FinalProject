==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
They are a pair of male Dall's sheep (''Ovis dalli dalli'') as their names suggest. Their appearances almost look the same, but their sizes differ. One is a bulky ram with thick horns while the other is a thin ram with thin horns.

==Appearances==
===''[[Brother Bear]]''===
They are first seen butting heads for a nearby ewe. When the bears greet them, one ram shouts, "What do you want?" which winds up being echoed. The rams start telling their own echo to shut up, resulting in a funny, nonstop argument. Koda then adds, "I think their horns are screwed on too tight," as he and Kenai leave to find the Salmon Run themselves. In an end credit scene, at nighttime, the rams finally end their argument as they get tired for good.

===''[[Brother Bear 2]]''===
They are seen standing on a cliff as they watch the Great Spirits race in a brilliant light across the sky to Hokani Falls in the ending to transform the cave painting of Kenai and Nita as children into bears to depict their transformation from humans into bears

==Trivia==
*In the book ''How to Draw Brother Bear'', it is revealed that the rams' names are Cliff and Roc.
*The lines where they tell each other to shut up were coincidentally later used for [[Bucky and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson]] in the [[2016]] film, ''[[Zootopia]]'' and later in ''[[Zootopia+]]''.
