'''Constance Contraire''' is the quartagonist in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. She is a rude and blunt girl who solves her problems with unconventional solutions.

==Background==

===Personality===
Constance is a very rude and inconsiderate girl. She tends to be very blunt about her opinions and does not care what others think of her. She is said to have "unconventional thoughts" and apparently displays some intense rebelliousness, to the point where her previous boarding school avoided giving her a roommate to keep her from having tantrums. Constance seems to hide her feelings behind her stubborn nature, often insulting the other members of the Mysterious Benedict Society despite having concern for their wellbeing. 

She is incredibly smart, though many do not notice due to the fact she prefers to ignore rules; she was shown to be able to pass Benedict's tests despite refusing to answer questions, and she is able to pass Mr. Oshiro's classes with little effort once she is focused and motivated. She also showed this by figuring out Curtain's complex code in one night, as soon as she was away from distracting sounds such as "Kate's finger tapping, Sticky's chewing, and Reynie's breathing." 

===Physical appearance===
Constance is a small girl who has blonde hair done in two braided loops. Unlike the others, she rarely has other variations of her attire is is always wearing a dark pink coat over a yellow dress and dress shoes.

===Abilities===
Constance has a low level of psychic sensitivity, being able to hear the Whisperer directly instead of simply feeling its effects. She also has high intelligence and complex puzzle skills; though she dislikes Morse Code, she was able to decipher several of Benedict's hidden messages almost on her own. 

Constance is proficient in writing poetry, even though it is usually insulting.

==Trivia==
*Each of the four children feature a dominant color of some kind. For Constance, it is the color red/pink.
*In the original book series, Constance is roughly three years old at the beginning of the series and is described as being chubby and having wispy hair. She is also much smaller and is described as looking like a fire hydrant due to her coat. She also constantly needed things explained to her; ironic, seeing as how Mr. Benedict hired her because she was smart.
*While her name sounds French, she speaks with a Russian accent, as her actress is from Russia.
*Her last name, Contraire is based on her contrary opinions and personality.
