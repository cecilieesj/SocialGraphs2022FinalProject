== Role in the films ==
=== ''Old Yeller'' ===
Jumper helps with various work around the Coates' ranch. When [[Travis Coates|Travis]] bids farewell to Jim, when he leaves to sell their steers on a cattle drive, he is seen riding Jumper. Later on while Travis is using him to help plow the cornfield, they see [[Old Yeller (character)|Old Yeller]] chasing a jackrabbit. Once he chases it into the field it spooks Jumper causing him to run. Old Yeller then begins to chase after him, causing him to wreck the fence (still being hooked up to the plow) as Travis is yelling at Old Yeller to leave Jumper alone.

The next day, Travis heads out into the woods with Jumper to go deer hunting and Jumper gets spooked by a flock of bobwhites nesting in a nearby tree, causing him to rear and throw Travis off. Sometime later after getting hog-cut, [[Katie Coates|Katie]] has Travis pull a hair out of Jumper's tail, which she uses to stitch up Old Yeller's injuries, and he helps carry them home to recover. Several days later, Katie, [[Arliss Coates|Arliss]] and [[Lisbeth Searcy|Lisbeth]] are using Jumper to help haul in the corn crop and then sticks to burn the carcass of their cow, Rose, who they had to shoot because she was rabid, and Jumper is shortly seen running away when Old Yeller is fighting a rabid [[The Wolf|wolf]]. Jumper's final scene in the film is near the very end alongside the new horse Jim brought home for Travis.

=== ''Savage Sam'' ===
Jumper is first seen in the cornfield, until Arliss shoos him out. Then later while using him to help with ranch chores, Arliss and Travis see [[Savage Sam (character)|Savage Sam]] fighting with a bobcat and Arliss quickly mounts Jumper as Savage Sam begins to pursue it. Shortly after Travis and Lisbeth find them, a gang of [[Apaches]], who have stolen a whole herd of horses, find and kidnap them. During the stampede, Jumper tries to get away, but is quickly corralled back into the herd by one of the Apaches.

That night, after one of the Apaches feeds the kids horse meat Arliss wonders where Jumper is. Travis thinks he's with the horses, but Arliss doesn't see him and thinks that the Apaches butchered him. Travis thinks that he might have gotten away, but Arliss didn't see him do so (nor did he see him get butchered) and refuses to eat because of him. After Travis and Lisabeth convince him to do so, he begins to talk about how much Jumper helped them and now he's keeping them from starving to death. Later on near the end of the film, after returning home they see that he is alive. Arliss is joyous to see him but also angry with him for being in the cornfield once more. As the film ends he, along with Savage Sam and Arliss, pursue the same bobcat from before.
