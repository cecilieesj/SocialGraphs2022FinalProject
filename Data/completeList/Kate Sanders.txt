'''Katherine "Kate" Sanders''' is the (former) secondary antagonist in the tv series, ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''.

==Biography==
Kate is the most popular girl in [[Lizzie McGuire (character)|Lizzie]]'s school, and is the captain of their school's cheerleading squad. Originally, one of Lizzie and [[Miranda Sanchez|Miranda]]'s best friends, Kate became popular because she got a bra after summer camp was over; as a result of her new-found popularity, Kate becomes Lizzie's enemy. Kate enjoys trying to make Lizzie's life miserable, but Lizzie always manages to outsmart Kate and come out on top. Kate's last name was originally Saunders, but it was eventually changed to Sanders. While Kate was mean to Lizzie in the series, she helps her out and becomes Lizzie's friend again in ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]''. Kate has a cousin named Amy. In the Season 2 episode Party Over Here, Kate shows a slightly self-conscious side. (It also implies that she is lonely too because she gets a call from her mom saying that she would not be home in time for Kate's party.) Even though Kate's popular, she is not ''truly'' happy.

In the episode ''I've Got Rhythmic'', it is shown that Kate fails at rhythmic gymnastics, and gets jealous when she sees that Lizzie is extremely good at it (but later in the episode, Lizzie reveals to her parents that she actually hates rhythmic gymnastics and that the ''only'' thing she likes about it is that she is better at it than Kate). It is rather ironic that Kate would fail at something like that considering she is on the cheerleading squad, and that gymnastics, in general, is a huge component of cheerleading.Â 

It is revealed in ''The Untitled Stan Jansen Project'' that Kate's biggest secret (which she revealed to Claire) was that she got held back in Kindergarten, so she is actually a year older than everyone else in their grade (including Lizzie and her friends).

In ''The Lizzie McGuire Movie'', Kate helps Lizzie in her plan to perform at the International Music Video Awards, and they become friends again.

==Trivia==
*Kate was born in the fall of 1987.
*Unlike Lizzie, Miranda and Gordo, Kate can get away with anything. However the three always end up getting punished.
