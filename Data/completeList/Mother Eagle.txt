|quote = "Where's my Baby Earl?!"}}'''Mother Eagle''' is a minor character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series. She appears in the episode "[[To Kilimanjaro Bird]]". She is voiced by Joycee Katz.

==Background==
===Personality===
When angry, Mother Eagle has a borderline-insane sounding voice. She is sweet to her [[Baby Earl]], but is mean to [[Timon]] because he has stolen her son's bowl of grubs. She can also be overly aggressive, as seen when she was on the verge of possibly killing Timon and [[Pumbaa]] with a club after Baby Earl jumped out of the nest and presumably got scratched.

Despite her aggressive side, Mother Eagle develops respect for Timon and Pumbaa when she sees her son flying and believes the two taught him how to do so. She is willing to repay the duo by letting them share the grubs, which she brought from the lowlands, with Earl.

===Physical Description===
Mother Eagle has the typical black brown feathers of an eagle, but that's where the resemblance to eagles ends. She has crazy-looking eyes, yellow legs and feet too small for her huge upper body, bun hair, and wears an apron. She has gorilla-like arms that bizarrely change into wings the one time she flies.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===
===="[[To Kilimanjaro Bird]]"====
While Timon and Pumbaa visit Mount Kilimanjaro, they stumble upon Baby Earl's feeding dish. Tempted by the tasty bugs in his dish, the two gobble up the remains of the food, leaving Mother Eagle in a fury. When Mother Eagle accuses Timon for stealing Baby Earl's grubs, the meerkat tells her that she needs proof. The adult eagle produces plenty of proof, such as strands of hair, a footprint impression, fingerprints on Earl's bowl, witnesses, Timon's wallet, and a security photo that shows Timon running away with Earl's bowl of grubs, much to his discomfort. In order to keep her from turning them in to the authorities, Timon and Pumbaa volunteer to be Earl's babysitters while she flies to the lowlands to find more grubs. Before she leaves, Mother Eagle threatens to hurt Timon if anything bad happens to her son, such as a single scratch.

Mother Eagle later returns and sees that Baby Earl is not with Timon and Pumbaa. After Pumbaa tells her the truth, she is about to hurt the two, but then sees her son flying. She assumes that Timon and Pumbaa taught Baby Earl how to fly and repays the duo by feeding them some of the grubs she brought from the lowlands.
