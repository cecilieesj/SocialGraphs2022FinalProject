He is the mutant doppelg√§nger of the original [[Globby]] created by [[Di Amara]] when her assistant [[Chris (Big Hero 6)|Chris]] retrieved a sample of Globby's own substance and accelerated its tissue regeneration.
==Background==
When Honey Lemon sought to develop a cure for Globby, Chris broke into [[San Fransokyo Institute of Technology]] and retrieve a sample of Globby's substance. He takes it back to [[Sycorax]], where Liv Amara experimented on it due to the substance's self-regenerating capabilities.

The dark bluish blob became sentient, so Liv and Chris locked it up in one of the holding cells on Sub-level 9. When Chris was attempting to feed it, it quickly got out when the doors was deactivated and merging with one of Liv's experiments within the bio tanks, gaining a single red eye for sight. The Glob escaped and went on a rampage in San Fransokyo.

===Physical Appearance===
Nega-Globby is nearly identical to the original, except is slightly larger than Globby himself and it's gelatinous form is indigo slime, having a single cycloptic red eye.
