'''Danny''' is one of the minor protagonists in Disney's [[2002]] film ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', the sequel to the [[1953]] film ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''. He is [[Edward]] and [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]]'s son, and [[Jane (Peter Pan)|Jane]]'s younger brother.

==Characteristics==
===Personality===
Danny is a very adventurous and fun-loving 4-year-old boy, with a deep faith in Wendy's stories about [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]]. However, his feelings can be easily hurt (as is evident when Jane ridicules his faith in the Peter stories Wendy tells him). He is also an innocent boy (as is made evident of his dislike and fear of war and war devices, such as bomber planes and their bombs).

===Physical appearance===
Danny is slender with dirty blond hair, green eyes, green footie pajamas similar to his Uncle [[Michael Darling|Michael]]'s pink footie pajamas, and a cap similar to Peter Pan's.

==Role in the film==
Danny is first seen in Wendy's arms when she and family are looking at [[Neverland]]. He is also seen with her when [[Edward]] leaves for the war. In his next appearance, he and Wendy head to the bomb shelter and he expresses his fear of the bomber planes and bombs. She makes him feel better, resulting in him believing it's [[Captain Hook]]. Jane and [[Nana II]] arrive and Jane gives him socks as his birthday gift and he's initially not happy with them, but Wendy imagines them as Peter Pan and Captain Hook. She then tells him a story about Peter and when Jane says that she has no time for such activity, he informs her that's she's not fun anymore, even going so far as to mention that she herself had wanted to become the first Lost Girl. He is later taken to the [[Nursery|nursery]] by Jane, but he later argues with her about Peter's existence and sadly runs off. He is next seen with Wendy during the song "[[I'll Try]]", talking about Peter again.

He is also seen in flashbacks when Jane is by herself in Neverland and is thinking of home.

He is next seen near the end and is surprised by Jane's new attitude towards Peter. She then tells him the story of Captain Hook kidnapping her, at which he is fascinated, and she also tells him about [[Tinker Bell]]. He is then seen at the window, seeing Peter for the first time. It is then that Edward returns home from the war and they go to greet him.

==Trivia==
*Danny resembles a palette swap of [[Michael Darling|Michael]], and he resembles [[Jim Jr.]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]''. In addition, both characters share the same voice actor during the early 2000s, Andrew McDonough.
*In the original story, Danny didn't exist because Jane is an only child (at least by the time the epilogue takes place).
*Sometimes, Danny looks like a younger version of Peter Pan.
