'''Baasho''' is a hyena in [[Banagi]]'s hyena pack. He is the prince - [[Banagi]]'s - assistant, and also his tool. In ''King of the Jungle'' [[Banagi]] bites of a section of [[Simba]]'s tail and leads [[Mufasa]] to his doom at the paws of [[Scar]].

==Appearance==
Baasho is a milky brown hyena with darker brown spots, his tail, muzzle, and ears tipped in black. His mane is also a darker brown. At night his eyes are a bright red.

==Personality==
Baasho is so loyal to [[Banagi]] that he doesn't seem to have much a personality that one could call his own. He is rather blank. However, once [[Mufasa]] is dead and [[Scar]] is upon the throne, his loyalty, like his mind, begins to waver.
