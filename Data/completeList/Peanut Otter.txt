|status = Active}}'''Peanut Otter''' is one of the major protagonists from the [[Playhouse Disney]] animated series ''[[PB&J Otter]]''.

He is the only brother of the family. At 8 years old and the eldest of the Otter children, Peanut is smart and can be a bit funny at times, but always loyal. He would normally rather not dance, especially the [[Noodle Dance]], but he ends up doing it anyway, even on some occasions, he would want to dance.

Peanut is best friends with [[Munchy Beaver]] and [[Flick Duck]], and he is into the Mallard Man comic books. He often helps out his sister, [[Jelly Otter|Jelly]], and they hug in some episodes in each season when they want to comfort each other.

==Disney's Hollywood Studios==
The puppet versions of Peanut and Jelly appeared on the Playhouse Disney car during the [[Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade]].
