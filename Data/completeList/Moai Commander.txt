The '''Moai Commander''' is a character from the animated series, ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. He serves as the commander of a group of Moai living in Easter Island.

==Background==
The Moai Commander wears a hat-like structure called a pukao, which makes him unique compared to the other Moai living there. Initially, he and the other Moai block the Lava Lizards to prevent them from escaping. However, after the Lava Lizards grew tired of living in the volcano, Sheldgoose uses his staff to cast a spell on the Moai as the Lava Lizards plan to destroy the Earth, much to his evil plans. After the Lava Lizards continue to cause more havoc and the Moai copy Donald's temper tantrum, they stomp the Lava Lizards out of the island, followed by the Three Caballeros telling the Moai Commander to jump on the Lava Lizards heading to the mainland. After the Lava Lizards retreat and Sheldgoose and Felldrake's plan failed, the Moai Commander and the rest of his squadron return to their posts.

==Role in the series==
In "[[No Man Is an Easter Island]]", [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose]] approach the Moai Commander in his stationary form where Felldrake plans to destroy him, but his attempts fail. After some failed attempts, Sheldgoose devises a plan of doing it his way. As an alternative, Sheldgoose uses his staff to bring the Moai Commander to life to which he explains to him that the other Moai don't take vacations to which Sheldgoose shows the Moai what vacation is to which Sheldgoose puts the Commander and the other Moai under his spell to party ar Easter Island while the [[Lava Lizards]] escape the volcano to cause destruction across the island in a plan to destroy Earth.

Noticing Felldrake at Easter Island, [[Xandra]] arrives and commands the other Moai to stop but they refuse to listen, due to the Moai under Felldrake's spell, so he sends the Three Caballeros for help. Eventually, when Donald Duck arrives and the Moai copy his temper tantrum, they ward the Lava Lizards out of the island, repelling them away, followed by the Caballeros approaching the Moai Commander telling him to do a big splash on the Lava Lizards heading to the mainland, causing the lava trail to harden and the Lava Lizard Queen to fall into the bottom of the ocean where she turns into a lifeless stone form. Having defeated the Lava Lizards with Sheldgoose and Felldrake being foiled, the Moai Commander and the rest of his squad remain on their stationary posts where [[Aracuan Bird|Ari]] gives them a radio to give them the best music to provide for the Moai.

In "[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]", the Moai Commander is summoned via zoom point during the final battle where Xandra summons him to get past Tyrone, the red dragon who was summoned by Sheldgoose during the battle to which Xandra and the Caballeros were able to reach the Summoning Chamber. Later when Felldrake prepares for a new age of darkness, the Moai Commander was sucked back to the zoom point summoned by Xandra, along with the other reinforcements that were summoned during the final battle who were sent to their respective homes during the final battle.
After the battle ends with Felldrake finally defeated, it is likely that the Moai Commander was sent back to Easter Island, his respective home, where he remained in his stationary post once again with the other Moai at Easter Island.

==Trivia==
*He is the only moai to wear a pukao hat. The pukao is a hat-like structure formerly placed on some moai statues in real life.
*Ironically, despite his title of being a commander, each moai constructed is supposed to pay tribute to a deceased chieftain or a very important person.
