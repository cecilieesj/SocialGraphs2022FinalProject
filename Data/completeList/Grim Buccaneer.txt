The '''Grim Buccaneer''' is a minor antagonist from the Disney Junior animated series, ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''. He is voiced by [[Christian Slater]].

==Background==

===Personality===
Grim is very ambitious and self-centered. He is a villain whose primary motivation is power. His main goal is becoming the captain of the Mighty Colossus. He will step on anyone to achieve his goals including his own allies. He is calm and calculating but can lose his temper when things don't go his way. However, he is immensely intelligent, devious, cunning, and scheming. He can think on his feet, deduce correct facts from very little clues, adapt his plans to the situations at hand and devise nearly flawless schemes. Grim's only moment of hesitation is during "The Legion of Pirate Villains", where Captain Colossus confronts him, saying that he once trusted Grim like a son, leading Grim to become somewhat troubled. However, he quickly recovers, believing Captain Colossus was merely trying to trick him.

===Physical appearance===

===Powers and abilities===

* '''Expert Strategist:''' Grim has demonstrated amazing cleverness, as he has shown feats of being able to outsmart enemies multiple times. During his debut, he showed that he was capable of evading capture from Jake and the other pirates despite being greatly out-numbered and over-powered. In "The Legion of Pirate Villains!" he was quick to ally himself with the other villains into forming his legion to not only locate Colossus's legendary treasure but also defeat their common enemy Captain Jake and his crew.
* '''Enhanced Speed, Agility & Reflexes:''' Grim is also very fast and agile, and he possesses good reflexes. He is able to hide into the shadows and can conceal himself quite easily. The only person who can keep up with him is Captain Colossus himself once his strength was restored.
* '''Swordsmanship:''' Grim has demonstrated some swordsmanship abilities. One of his primary weapons is a sword.

==Appearances==

* [[Mystery of the Mighty Colossus]] (First Appearance)
* [[Captain Jake and the Never Land Pirates: The Legion of Pirate Villains]] (Last Appearance)
