==Background==
===Official Description===
Ryker, a 17-year veteran of the Transportation Management Safety Team (TMST), not only lives by the book when it comes to airport accident investigations, he wrote the book.

==Appearances==
===''[[Planes]]''===
At the end of ''Planes'', he is seen in the crowd celebrating [[Dusty Crophopper]]'s victory.

===''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''===
In ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', after a fire was put out at [[Chug]] and [[Dottie (Planes)|Dottie]]'s Fill n' Fly when [[Dusty Crophopper|Dusty]] accidentally clipped the tower while testing his limits with his gearbox damaged, Ryker arrives in [[Propwash Junction]] the next day along with his pitty Kurtz, accusing [[Mayday]] of the accident until Dusty explains what he did. Ryker then figures out that the town has no plans for emergencies, and decides to close the airport down until Mayday hires a second firefighter.

At the end, he re-opens the airport after Dusty comes back to Propwash Junction with the news of being certified by [[Blade Ranger]] as a firefighter.
