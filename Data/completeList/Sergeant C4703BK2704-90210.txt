}}'''Sergeant C4703BK2704-90210''' is a robotic prisoner teleportation officer who appears in the pre-show of the [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[Stitch's Great Escape!]].
He is a re-dressed version of [[S.I.R.]] from [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]. Featured in the pre-show, this animatronic is highly active with visitors, regarding the fact that he directly talks to them and provides directions and safety instructions. His comedic timidness makes the pre-show more welcoming and sets the attraction in a more light-hearted family environment, much opposed to S.I.R. in Alien Encounter.

Sgt. 90210 also makes a cameo in the mobile game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'' as part of the game's representation of Stitch's Great Escape!.
