==History==
Gilroy invites [[Tawni Hart|Tawni]] and [[Sonny]] onto his show, giving them the impression they will have a fun time on their first talk show. It is not until they're backstage, preparing for the show, that they learn that Gilroy is known for twisting the truth and spurring conflict between celebrities in order to make his show interesting. He attempts to trick Tawni and Sonny into dishing on [[Nico Harris|Nico]], [[Grady Mitchell|Grady]], [[Zora Lancaster|Zora]], and each other, but the girls will not talk due to a pact they formed backstage. He is also a fan of hidden cameras (hiding them in different parts of the studio and in Sonny and Tawni's gift baskets), hence him being on the show ''Gotcha!'' to spy on people.

Partway through the show, Gilroy brings [[Chad Dylan Cooper|Chad]] out to join the girls on the show. Gilroy had convinced Chad to appear on his show by giving him the impression that they would be discussing Chad's book, when in reality, Gilroy planned to uncover and reveal the rumored relationship between Chad and Sonny. Gilroy shows a clip of Chad and Sonny on the ''[[Mackenzie Falls]]'' set that was sent into the show by an anonymous cast mate of Chad's.
