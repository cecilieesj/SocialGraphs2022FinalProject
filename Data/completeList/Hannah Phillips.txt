{{Quote|What's wrong, [[Sid Phillips|Sid]]? Don't you want to play with Sally?|Hannah Phillips|Toy Story}}

'''Hannah Phillips''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[1995]] animated film ''[[Toy Story]]''. She is the younger sister of [[Sid Phillips|Sid]]. Despite her brother Sid's antics, she appears to be normal and good-natured. She loves her dolls, although Sid normally ends up stealing and mutilating them one way or another.

==Role in the film==
Hannah is [[Sid Phillips|Sid]]'s younger sister, who appears to be normal, despite her brother’s antics. She loves her dolls, although Sid normally ends up mutilating them in one way or another.

Sid first takes Hannah's Janie Doll after he comes home from [[Pizza Planet]] and asking Hannah if he got something in the mail and she tells Sid that she doesn't know. He swaps its head with Sid's pterodactyl, effectively scaring her. She then reports him to their mother while Sid tries to convince her that she has been lying.

Later, she finds [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] with his arm broken off, having fallen down to the floor and had severed his left arm after trying to fly to a window after realizing that he is only a toy. Thinking this to be just another toy abused by Sid, she borrows him for her tea party along with other two dolls that are headless as they were previously wrecked by her brother. Hannah disguises Buzz as "Mrs. Nesbit" by dressing him in a pink apron and blue hat (similar to [[Mrs. Potato Head]]'s) and plays with him and the pair of dolls (which are later referred to by Buzz as "Marie Antoinette and her little sister"). Intending to get Hannah to leave the scene in order to get Buzz out of her room, [[Woody]] pretends to be her mother by calling for Hannah in her voice. 

Much later, Hannah answers the door, not knowing that Ducky, one of the [[Mutant Toys|mutant toys]], has rung it as part of [[Woody]]'s strategical scheme to save Buzz from Sid. Soon, Sid's dog [[Scud]], who is chasing another mutant toy, the speedy Frog, accidentally rams into her, knocking her down as he exits onto the porch. Annoyed at Scud for his stupidity, Hannah closes the door in Scud's face, locking him out.

When Sid becomes frightened of toys after seeing his own toys come to life in front of his face, Hannah takes revenge on her brother by shoving her new doll Sally (apparently a replacement doll for Janie) into his face and chasing him into his room, thus trying to scare him even more and asking him if he wants to play with the doll.

==Trivia==
*Despite hearing Woody (pretending to be her mother), it is unsure as to whether Hannah knows that toys come to life, much like how her brother did, since she didn’t actually see Woody come to life.
