==Personality==
Willawing and her dragon friends are very friendly and enjoy making friends with new people. Willawing is shown to be very affectionate and can sometimes overdo it to the point where she tickles Sofia's chin and hugs Sir Jaxon very tightly. Her friendliness and affection do not stop her from breathing fire to defend herself.

==Role in the Series==
Willawing makes her debut in the episode, "[[The Tale of the Noble Knight]]". She first appears with the other Dragons of Brazendell when Princess Sofia and Minimus arrive in Brazendell. She later appears again after Sofia rescues Sir Jaxon. Willawing reveals to Sofia that she and the other dragons are friendly. When Sofia reveals she heard about the fires the Dragons were being blamed for, Willawing and Sir Jaxon reveal the truth to her: Sir Oliver provoked them into causing those fires so he could get the King of Brazendell's permission to retrieve the Ice Fire Shield so he could use it to get rid of the Dragons for good and gain glory for himself. Sofia believes them because she saw Sir Oliver do all kinds of despicable behavior earlier and realizes that the knight she is supposed to help get the Shield is Sir Jaxon. When they get to where the Shield is kept they find that Sir Oliver already has it. Together, the Dragons, Jaxon, and Sofia defeat Sir Oliver and get the Shield from him.Â 

==Trivia==
*She is the second character [[Monica Richardson]] has voiced on the show. The first was [[Kamea and Halia|Queen Halia of Hakalo]].
