He is designed to pop popcorn for Jumba's movie night. His one true place is popping popcorn for a movie theater.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Kernel is a tan gourd-shaped experiment with a large opening at the top of his head, black eyes, a red nose, a thin mouth, short ears and a white stomach.

===Powers and abilities===
Kernel can produce popcorn, and pop it out of the opening on his head.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 014 was the fourteenth genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to pop popcorn for Jumba's movie night. 014 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

014 was mentioned in "[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]" when Jumba, under the effects of [[Angel|624]], claimed that she was designed to "pop popcorn for Jumba's movie night," but he was actually stating the purpose of 014.

At some point, 014 was activated, captured, tamed, and named Kernel.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Kernel was seen when [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to check on all of the experiments. Right before she met [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], Lilo was seen in front of the theater, where Kernel was doing his job inside an enclosure.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Kernel, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Kernel participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Though only appearing in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', Kernel was referenced in "[[Angel (episode)|Angel]]". After [[Angel]] turned Jumba evil again, he lied when he stated that Angel was a "harmless early experiment designed to pop popcorn for Jumba's movie night," which is actually Kernel who is an early experiment with that exact function.
*Kernel is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''.
