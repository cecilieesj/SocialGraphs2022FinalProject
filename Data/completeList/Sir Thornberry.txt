'''Sir Thornberry''' is a character from the animated series ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
Sir Thornberry is a [[Gummi Bears|Gummi]] Knight who resides in the Gummi capital of [[Ursalia]].

When the Great Gummies were forced to abandon their home due to the actions of humans, he was left behind as a caretaker. This was just in case the Great Gummies were ever able to return, similarly to the [[Gummi Glen]] Gummies staying behind as caretakers.

By Thornberry's account, he had been guarding the capital for the past 50 years when first meeting the Glen Gummies, though by [[King Gregor]]'s account in "[[The Magnificent Seven Gummies]]", the last alleged sighting of Gummi Bears in [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]] had been about 500 years in the past. No explanation is ever given for the discrepancy. While brave and honorable, Sir Thornberry is quite scatterbrained as a result of having been on his own for so long.

==Appearances==
Sir Thornberry is first introduced in the episode "[[The Road to Ursalia]]". [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]] and [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] travel to Ursalia in hopes of finding a replacement for the Gummi Glen Gummies' copy of the [[Great Book of Gummi]], which had just been destroyed. Sir Thornberry assists Gruffi, though the two must avoid [[Lady Bane]] during her introductory appearance.

In "[[Return to Ursalia]]", Sir Thornberry sends a message to the Gummies asking for their help. A transient group of Gummies, the Barbics, had just arrived, as their previous home was destroyed. The new group is more warrior-minded, and has a deep disdain for humans, so much so that they are looking for an ancient weapon to attack all of humankind with.

While the Barbics' views eventually soften, they note that they are still homeless. However, the good-natured Sir Thornberry offers them a new home in Ursalia, citing the large amount of living space. The Barbics accept, and so Sir Thornberry is no longer alone in Ursalia.

In the episode "[[Thornberry to the Rescue]]", the old Gummi Knight visits Gummi Glen, meets [[Cavin]] for the first time, and accidentally releases the Spinster, a gigantic, hungry spider that was trapped centuries ago by the Great Gummies.

Later episodes that feature Sir Thornberry usually take place in and around Ursalia. These are "[[True Gritty]]", "[[The Rite Stuff]]", and the series' finale "[[King Igthorn|King Igthorn, Part II]]".
