==Personality==

There is also a light located on each of her shoulders and a jetpack on her back.
When driving the Flashcar, she wears a red helmet with white lightning stripes on each side and a white arrow running down the middle. Her face-concealing visor is black, on which a red electronic mouth and eyes are projected.
