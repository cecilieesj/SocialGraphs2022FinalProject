'''Emmett''' is a character on the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[That's So Raven]]''. He is the hall monitor for [[Bayside High School]] and makes his only appearance in "[[The Road to Audition]]". He is portrayed by Shane Haboucha.

==History==
Emmett is the only student at the school uninterested in the possibility Tony the janitor was an undercover agent for Undercover Superstars. He spent the day trying to stop students from singing as he thought it broke the rules, while not realizing they were actually not breaking any rules at all. In the end, he did compliment Raven, as he thought she was the best right before giving her detention for dancing on the tables.
