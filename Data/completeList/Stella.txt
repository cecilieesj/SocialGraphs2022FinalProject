==Role in the film==
Stella is an energetic bloodhound who is first seen at the beginning of the film, given to Charlotte as a puppy from her father, Eli "Big Daddy" La Bouff. Years later, she's seen at the La Bouff masquerade ball in a Roman Centurion costume, climbing onto [[Tiana|Tiana's]] beignet table begging for some beignets. Tiana relents, but gives only one to Stella.

Later, after Tiana and [[Prince Naveen|Naveen]] are transformed into frogs by a curse of the evil [[Dr. Facilier]], they accidentally crash into the party and into Charlotte's dress. Big Daddy orders Stella (who was eating the rest of Tianaâ€™s beignets that fell on the ground when Tiana accidentally crashed into the table during her confrontation with the [[The Fenner Brothers|Fenner Brothers]]) to get the two frogs, resulting in a chaotic chase through the masquerade ball and across a dining table, leading to a huge net where she crashes into a couple wearing a pirate costume and a mermaid costume causing her to collect pieces of their costumes.

As Tiana and Naveen leave with a few balloons, Tiana calls out to Stella who she is to calm her prompting Stella to call out Tiana's name to her in question, much to Tiana's shock. This was when Tiana began to realize that she had gained the ability to talk to animals upon being transformed into a frog.

==Trivia==
*At the beginning of the movie, Charlotte refers to Stella as a 'he'. It's presumed she was corrected off-screen.
*Stella is probably named after the character Stella from ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', something supported by the fact that Big Daddy calls for her by shouting, "Hey, STELLA!!!" like Stanley Kowalski does. Interestingly enough, [[John Goodman]] played the ''Steetcar'' character Harold Mitchell in the 1995 TV Version.
