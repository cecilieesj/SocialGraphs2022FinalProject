At night, Dania meets Tantor's friends, except for [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]]. She then meets Terk but finds Terk's antics to be annoying and obnoxious. The next day, Tantor and Dania are about to go on another date, but Dania tells Tantor to not invite Terk. When Terk finds out that Dania dislikes her and she wants to be alone with Tantor, she tries to break up their relationship but fails. Tantor and Terk have an argument and they break up.

When Tantor finds out about Terk getting captured by [[German Poacher|poachers]], he is about to rescue her, making Dania annoyed. After Terk and Tantor reunite, Dania gives Tantor a second chance to leave Terk and go out with her. Tantor decides to stay with Terk, making Dania angrily leave.
