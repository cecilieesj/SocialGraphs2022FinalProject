Throughout the film he serves as the go to guy for [[Roger Bowman]] and [[J.P.]], usually getting them food or drinks, which end up on him. What he doesn't realize is that it's a distraction for Roger to tell Manager [[George Knox]] about any actual angels he sees and what players to use. Near the end of the film, after [[Ranch Wilder]] exposes Knox's tatics, nearly destroying his career in baseball, David appears at a press conference called by team owner [[Hank Murphy]] for Knox to retract this statement. While at the press conference, the boys' caretaker [[Maggie Nelson]], the boys, and the entire team stand up for Knox with the team saying they won't play for anyone but him. Murphy, touched by their faith and loyalty decides to keep Knox by the team's request and David is seen applauding, showing his loyalty to Knox as well. He later appears at the final game of the season, doing the angel alert signal for [[Mel Clark]].
