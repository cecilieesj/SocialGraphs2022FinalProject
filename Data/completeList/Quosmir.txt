He appears in ''[[Dave the Barbarian]]''.

==Background==
He has "mommy issues" and carries a security blanket known as his "ni-ni lankie". He often experiences short-term memory loss andÂ attention deficit disorder. He was trapped in a coffin for thousands of years. In the present, Dave plays on the bagpipe-like instrument 'The Garglepipes', unknowingly causing the coffin to break and freed Quosmir from his prison.

===Powers and abilities===
He has immense magical powers including flight, superhuman strength, super-speed, and flaming loogies.
