==Background==
Stationed on [[Lothal]], Grint alongside his commander, [[Cumberlayne Aresko]] worked together bringing oppression to the citizens on the planet, often charging them for minor incidents such as speaking freely about the Empire's oppression across the galaxy.

One such incident happened when a merchant was caught selling unregistered food. Aresko had the man arrested, while Myles ate some of his fruit mocking nearby citizens who didn't have the courage to stand up to them. However, the merchant was spared when Grint and Aresko received a false "Code Red" from [[Ezra Bridger]], luring them away so he could help himself to some of the fruit they almost confiscated.
