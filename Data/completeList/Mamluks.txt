==Background==
The Mamluks are the only other inhabitants of Mozenrath's kingdom, the Land of the Black Sand: a desolated and hostile land that was once ruled by an evil sorcerer [[Destane]], who adopted [[Mozenrath]]. At some point, likely when Mozenrath felt that Destane had nothing left to teach him, he killed Destane and turned him into one of his undead Mamluks, before taking over his throne. The Mamluk soldiers have secure control over the Land of the Black Sand, but they are not powerful enough to conquer the other kingdoms that Mozenrath wants to rule.
