The chief of police, who does not take kindly to Teamo taking the police matters into their own hands. He has a daughter named Patience, and a wife. He was a former US Cold War secret agent named Epsilon. A recurring joke with the chief is when he takes a villain away, he'll make a witty line that ends with jail, prison, etc. (e.g.: "Let's go! You and droid boy have Front row seats.... IN JAIL!!!"). He once tried to operate as a costumed superhero himself in the episode "The Cheif's new groove," using the code-name 'Lawman', but made a hash of it since his 'gadgets' consisted of an umbrella and an eggwhisk.
