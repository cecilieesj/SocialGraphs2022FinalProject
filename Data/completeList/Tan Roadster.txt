===Personality===
Tan likes to pick on [[Pete]] about his weight. He also appears to enjoy athletics, as he is a skilled skier and is very healthy. He is interested in strong-willed women, which is why he is attracted to [[Peg]], even going as far as to compete against her own husband for her love, as seen in the episode "[[Gymnauseum]]".

===Physical appearance===
Tan is a bulky anthropomorphic dog with a cleft chin, orange fur, and his hair made into a pompadour. He wears a yellow jacket over an orange snowsuit with dark orange trim, and orange bicep straps. He also wears dark orange boots.

===Role in the series===
Tan's only appearance is in the episode "[[Gymnauseum]]". He offers to go up against [[Pete]] in a skiing race in exchange for [[Peg]]. Peg convinces Pete to join because he needs the exercise. 

==Trivia==
*Tan's name and interest, skiing, may be based off of the expression "skiers tan," used to describe a person's face when it is covered in ski goggle tan lines after prolonged skiing.
