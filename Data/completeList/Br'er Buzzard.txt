==Comics==

In 1946, Disney made the first Br’er Rabbit comics based on ''Song of the South''. Disney added more Uncle Remus characters which did not appear in the movie. Br’er Buzzard appears regularly in the Br’er Rabbit comics. He is a member of the Foul Fellows Club and is often seen with Br’er Fox and Br’er Bear. They usually try to catch Br’er Rabbit but they always fail. Unlike Br'er Fox, Br'er Bear, and the Big Bad Wolf, Br'er Buzzard isn’t trying to catch an animal to eat. He is most often seen stealing and deceiving Br'er Rabbit. In the first few comics, he sometimes succeeds but in the newer comics he always fails.
