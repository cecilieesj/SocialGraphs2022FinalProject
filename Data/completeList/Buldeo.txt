'''Buldeo''' is the secondary antagonist in the early production of ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.

==History==
===Original ''[[The Jungle Book]]''===
[[File:BuldeoSpies.png|thumb|left|Concept art of Buldeo]]Buldeo was a deleted secondary antagonist (also with [[Shere Khan]]) who was dropped from the 1967 film ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. He was meant to have [[Mowgli]] to lead him to a treasure in the ruins where [[King Louie]] lives, but then Shere KhanÂ would show up and kill Buldeo. Mowgli would then kill Shere Khan with Buldeo's gun. Buldeo and Shere Khan were meant to sing a duet ([[The Mighty Hunters]]), but the song, along with Buldeo, were removed due to a dispute between [[Bill Peet]] and [[Walt Disney]] over the initial contents.
