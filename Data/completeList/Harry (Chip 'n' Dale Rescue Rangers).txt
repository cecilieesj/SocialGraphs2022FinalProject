==Role in the series==
After witnessing a robbery, that is apparently carried out by a wolf, draws the attention of the Rescue Rangers. The Rescue Rangers interrogate the wolves in the zoo, where Harry was fast asleep. However, Harry's mate, [[Harriet]], informs the Rescue Rangers that she has noticed her husband acting a little odd.

During the Rescue Rangers stakeout in the zoo, the Rangers watch as Harry, turn into a human. The Rangers follow him on his wild adventures through the city, where Harry's revolting table manners and not having the means to pay for his meal cause the wolf-man to get kicked out of a restaurant. Harry later steals a car and goes a joy ride, meanwhile [[Officer Kirby and Officer Muldoon]] chase the wolf thief from another robbery. During a chase, Harry turns back into a wolf, and the wolf burglar turns into [[Professor Norton Nimnul]]. Kirby and Muldoon capture Harry, mistaking him for the thief. [[Chip and Dale]] trail after Nimnul, and learn that he created a device, the Metamorphisizer, which switches the physical forms of two animals. Nimnul uses this to exchange physical forms with Harry the wolf so he can carry out his robberies.

The other Rangers help Harry escape the pound. They all meet up and through the switching of metamorphisizers among animals in the zoo, Nimnul and the many zoo animals become mixed-up species. The Rangers manage to unscramble all the animals and Nimnul is taken into custody.
