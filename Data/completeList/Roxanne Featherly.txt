==Role in the series==
Roxanne first appears in the pilot episode, "[[Woo-oo!]]", attending a press conference where [[Flintheart Glomgold]] is citing to have found the Jewel of [[Atlantis]]. However, Roxanne and the others quickly turn their attention to [[Scrooge McDuck]] when he arrives with the real jewel. Roxanne then reports on Scrooge and family's return to adventuring and how they will be "solving mysteries and rewriting history."

In "[[JAW$!]]", Roxanne interviews Scrooge on the collateral damage his adventures have on Duckburg. Although Roxanne is initially friendly and promises the interview to be civil, she then bombards Scrooge with antagonistic questions and accusations, and brings in Flintheart as a video guest. Scrooge loses his patience and lectures Roxanne on his integrity that it ruins his interview. Roxanne then tails Scrooge to [[the Money Bin]] following the destruction of a money shark. Mistaking the scattering treasure to be Scrooge donating his wealth, Roxanne reports the treasure is profiting Duckburg and gives positive remarks on him.
