'''Beatrice Stanhope''' is a supporting antagonist of ''[[George of the Jungle]]'' and one of the two main antagonists (alongside [[Lyle Van de Groot]]) in its sequel, ''[[George of the Jungle 2]]''.

As [[Ursula Stanhope|Ursula]]'s highly wealthy mother, Beatrice desperately wants her to marry a rich man, to maintain the status and glamour of her exuberant family. However, after a trip with her fiancé, [[Lyle Van de Groot]], to [[Africa]], Ursula falls madly in love with [[George of the Jungle (character)|George]], a jungle man, which destroys all Beatrice's plans to be part of the new high society, for with Ursula getting married with George, she will become a wild.

==Background==

=== Personality ===
Beatrice is a stubborn, selfish, serious, snobbish, and unpleasant rich woman who sees class before [[Ursula Stanhope|Ursula]]'s happiness. She is really desperate to have Ursula married with [[Lyle Van de Groot|Lyle]] and is every time annoying her daughter and her husband, [[Arthur Stanhope|Arthur]], with this matter.

==Role in the film==
===''[[George of the Jungle]]''===
[[File:Beaimages.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Beatrice at the beginning of the original film]]
Beatrice is Ursula's egotistical mother and a socialite, and immediately disapproves of her choice of George over her former fiancé, Lyle Van de Groot.

Beatrice is [[Ursula Stanhope|Ursula]]'s egotistical mother and a socialite, and immediately disapproves of her choice of [[George of the Jungle (character)|George]] over her former fiancé, [[Lyle Van de Groot]].

Beatrice even threatens to castrate George if he doesn't leave Ursula alone, and tells him to leave [[San Francisco]] and go back to his [[Africa|jungle]]. Next morning, Ursula found out and scolds her for what she did, and confesses that she loves George.

Much to Beatrice's dismay, [[Arthur Stanhope|Arthur]] supports his daughter to go after him. So in the end, Ursula and George are married anyway, and Beatrice is forced to accept it. During the wedding in the jungle, she is still irritated by the situation and is seen dancing with an ape in the ending.

===''[[George of the Jungle 2]]''===
Beatrice returns in the sequel, this time as the main antagonist. She is still not satisfied with Ursula ditching her high class status for George, has presumably divorced Arthur and is scheming with Lyle to get Ursula and [[George Jr.]] back to civilization, steal the deed to Ape Mountain from Ape, and rid themselves of George for good. 

When she first steps foot into the African jungles and reveals her reasoning to the jungle guides, [[N'Dugo, Kip, and Baleto|N'Dugo, Kip and Baleto]], why she does all these aforementioned actions which is because she refused the idea of George Junior growing up in the jungle "an illiterate savage", The three guides, repulsed by that remark, throw Beatrice off the cliff, but she survives, because the narrator remarks, "Sorry, we can't kill Beatrice. If she dies, we have no stories." Upon arriving at George and Ursula's treehouse during George Jr.'s fifth birthday, she gifts both Ursula and George Jr. numerous presents from San Francisco in an attempt to get them to leave for civilization, while also chastising George for his primitive ways of giving presents to his son, and urges George to abandon both Ursula and George Junior so that the two could return back to civilization. 

It is revealed however that Ape is debt-ridden and does not have the deed after all, but George does. Hence, he fly to Las Vegas to help Ape out while Beatrice finds various ways to get Ursula to leave George with the help of both Lyle, Ursula's friends, and a hypnotist named Armando, who succeeds in hypnotizing Ursula to be Lyle's wife. She then takes Ursula and George Jr. back to her home in San Francisco where George eventually rescues them after learning about Lyle’s scheme to destroy the jungle.

In the end, George saves the day, Lyle is pulled out of the story, and Beatrice, after getting kissed by a gorilla, accepts defeat with dignity once more.  After her evil plot and her plan has failed George and Ursula has decided to renew wedding their vows after George give them a speech everyone cheering and Beatrice clapping her hands slowly and very not happy. She then leaves Africa and goes back to San Francisco for good.
