== Background ==

===Personality===
Ally is generally shown to be sweet and kind, often described as a good person or a "goody goody." She's against all forms of rule breaking, even insignificant ones such as coloring outside the lines. She is often portrayed as girly, and sometimes meek.

Ally is often shown not to be into things most teenagers consider fun, such as arcades or horror movies, and enjoys slightly unusual activities, such as cloud watching club. She is some what geeky, but constantly tries to hide it when questioned or accused of it, which generally leads to either disasters or her appearing even more geeky.

Ally has stage fright, and is a time shown not to be the confident in herself. She can also at times be a bit obsessive over simple things, such as trying to get a gold star, as she was the only person who didn't ever get one.

=== Physical Appearance ===
Ally is a pretty teenage girl with large brown eyes, pale skin, and wavy, shoulder-length chestnut hair. She has a small, petite frame and usually wears high-heeled shoes to mask that. In Season 2, Ally added amber highlights to her hair, making it chestnut at the roots and ending in a blonde. By Season 3, Ally's hair has lightened to a medium brown with caramel highlights. It is now curlier and longer, having grown to armpit length.

In Season 1, Ally's clothing style is very bohemian, consisting of delicate dresses with lots of lace and modest colors or floral patterns. She wore vintage jewelry as accessories, such as a single pendant or long beaded necklace. Ally usually wore heeled boots with lace socks. She often layered her outfits with cardigans and dresses.

In Season 2, Ally's style is much more extroverted and a complete change from her previous choices in clothing. Her clothes are more girly, modern, and tight-fitting, with brighter colors. Ally wears a lot of bold tops with neon-colored pants/tights or short, tight skirts. For shoes, she wore colorful wedged sandals. Ally still layers her clothing with loose tops over her dresses and colorful jean jackets/vests over tank tops. Her main accessory usually consists of a gold necklace with her name spelled out, though she also wore more striking necklaces and bracelets.
