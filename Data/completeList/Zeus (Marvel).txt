[[Thor Odinson|Thor]] came to Zeus to asked him for his help in fighting [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] and saving the gods. When Zeus refused, Thor and his allies battled him, ending in Thor impaling him through the chest with his own Thunderbolt, and then stealing the weapon, leaving Zeus for dead. While the Thunderbolt allowed Thor and his allies to defeat Gorr and save the gods of the universe, Zeus was still furious that he had been made a mockery out of in front of his council. As such, he called on [[Hercules (Marvel)|Hercules]] to take his vengeance for him, ordering him to kill Thor as he was nursed back to health.
