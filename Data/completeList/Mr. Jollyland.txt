'''Mr. Jollyland''' is the proprietor of Jollyland. He is voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].

He first appeared in the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' cartoon "[[Roller Coaster Painters]]" where [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]] are hired to paint the Jollyland Amusement Park roller coaster. He added in an incentive: whoever paints the most wins a lifetime pass to Jolly-Land Amusement Park. Most of the cartoon featured Mickey and Donald fighting over the lifetime pass while Goofy ended up winning the pass with his sure-and-steady pace.

He later made cameo appearances in two other ''Mickey Mouse Works'' cartoons "[[Donald on Ice]]" and "[[Mickey's Christmas Chaos]]" where he gives prizes to the Abominable Snowman for being the first prize well-built snowman in the big snowman contest and [[Pluto]]'s doghouse for being the first prize Christmas decorated house.
