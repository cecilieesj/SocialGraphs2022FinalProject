{{Quote|How was the fun-vee?|James Rhodes}}

'''War Machine''' (real name '''James Rhodes''', commonly called '''Rhodey'''), is the tritagonist of the ''Iron Man'' film series and a major protagonist in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films. He is a colonel in the U.S. Air force, a jet pilot and Aerospace engineer. He is a good friend of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], and is the liaison between [[Stark Industries]] and the military in the department of acquisitions. His power comes from his high-tech battle suit known as "War Machine", which grants him extraordinary strength, durability, flight capabilities, and various on-board weaponry.

James Rhodes first appeared in the 2008 film ''Iron Man'', portrayed by [[Terrence Howard]]. From ''Iron Man 2'' onward, however, he was played by [[Don Cheadle]].

War Machine was created by David Michelinie and John Byrne.

==Background==
===Personality===
Rhodes is described as a "soldier with a conscience". He doesn't inherently want to kill, however, if he is attacked, or has no other option he will. Though the toll of which will weigh on his mind. Due to his time in the United States Armed Forces, Rhodes is a distinguished officer in his ranks and committed to his duties; his responsible nature tends to put him in conflict with Tony. Their friendship can also become complicated due to their differing attitudes, especially when Tony shows no respect for the law and the government, which Rhodes tries to balance out between his duties and friendship with Tony.

===Abilities===
*'''Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' Rhodes is extremely skilled in unarmed combat.
*'''Skilled Pilot:''' Rhodes is skilled in piloting most types of aircraft.
*'''Weapons Proficiency:''' Rhodes is extremely skilled in the use of military weaponry; such as small arms.

===Equipment===
Rhodes uses a modified Iron Man armor to become War Machine. The armor allows him to fly and contains various weapons for battle. The armor is more heavily armored and equipped than Stark's. Prior to its weaponization, the armor was sufficient enough to battle the Mark IV armor. The War Machine armor is the only other powerful suit next to the Iron Man armor.
*'''Flight:''' The armor can reach speeds as Mach 3 in moments. It is equipped with non-weapons grade repulsor based flight stabilizers that theoretically reach speeds of Mach 8 similar to the Mark IV's flight stabilizers. It was able to keep up with the Mark VI during the battle over the Stark Expo and catch Iron Man off-guard and tackled him into the Oracle building.
*'''Strength:''' Rhodes in the armor is capable of lifting 30 tons or more due to the fact that it is more heavily armored than Stark's.
*'''Armor System:''' The armor has remote assistance and a holographic HUD, with cellphone and computer connections in the helmet. The armor is powered by a miniature arc reactor and has an on-board generator for emergencies. The scanner systems are capable of scanning the environment, weather conditions, and equipment for information. The armors also have variable control surfaces for active flight control.
*'''Durability:''' The armor is made of a solar-charged carbon-composite-based external plating armor, and has a chest-plate protecting the arc reactor. It can withstand tremendous amounts of punishment, including the Mark IV.
*'''Self-Contained Life-Support System & Environmental Protection:''' The armor can be completely sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater, providing its own life support, and is shielded against radiation.
*'''Repulsors:''' A particle beam weapon in the palm gauntlets. Can repel physical and energy-based attacks.
**'''Unibeam:''' A powerful Repulsor beam.
In addition to the physical capabilities and various weaponry it already possesses, it also utilizes laser-guided munitions. On the right shoulder, there is an M134 7.62mm minigun that can extend or retract in or out of its "cup". On the left shoulder, there is a bunker buster Sidewinder missile. Each wrist supports twin 9mm Claridge Hi-Tec semi-automatic pistols. The 5.56x45mm FN F2000 was ideal for mounting inside of the gauntlets due to the unique way it discharges spent casings out the front. Custom feeds send the rounds directly into the gun, eliminating the standard 30-round magazine.

{{Quote|Iron Patriot is on the job!|James Rhodes|Iron Man 3}}

Shortly after the Chitauri invasion of [[New York City]], Rhodes's War Machine suit was rebranded into the [[Iron Patriot (armor)|Iron Patriot]] by [[A.I.M.]]. Rhodes and Tony were having drinks at a bar whilst discussing the new paint job of the War Machine and the threat of the [[Trevor Slattery|Mandarin]]. However, this discussion was cut short when Tony had an anxiety attack and left in his suit.

Much later after Tony went missing after another Mandarin attack and a third Mandarin broadcast, Rhodes was ordered to a possible broadcast source, only to find villagers. Whilst there, Rhodes was contacted by Tony who asked for his log in details, his log in which Rhodes hesitantly gave to Tony. Later Rhodes followed another possible Mandarin broadcast source only to find another false lead. As the villagers thanked Rhodes, one woman crippled the suit using [[Extremis]].

Rhodes later woke up in the Mandarin's lair as numerous engineers attempted to cut Rhodes out of the suit to no avail. Eventually, [[Aldrich Killian]] came and used his Extremis powers to break Rhodes out. Once out Rhodes punched [[Eric Savin]] and tried to run only to be stopped by Killian's fire breath and Savin rendering him unconscious. Rhodes later woke up to find Tony running through the facility with his newest suit and that Savin had stolen the Iron Patriot suit. Tony then lead Rhodes upstairs to the Mandarin who turned out to be a drunken British actor named [[Trevor Slattery]] just posing as Mandarin for Killian so he could get rich from the supply of the Extremis product. Also that the vice president was involved.

Later, Rhodes and Tony using Trevor's speed boat contacted Vice President Rodriguez and warned him about the threat and the danger to the president whom Rodriguez promised to have Ellis alerted (but was really also working with Killian too). Later Rhodes witnessed Tony saving the President's assistants ejected from the plane by Savin saved by Tony's remote-controlled suit. After this, Rhodes and Tony using just pistols, lead an attack on a dock area where Killian was. After being discovered early, Tony called for his Iron Legion to appear. Rhodes requested one but the suits were only encoded to Tony, forcing Rhodes to go after the president without a suit. Rhodes eventually discovered Ellis trapped in the Patriot suit above an oil tanker and freed him. After recovering his suit, Rhodes flew Ellis out of the area.

Later after Killian was defeated, Rhodes returned to his original duties and witnessed the arrest of Rodriguez. Much later he also witnessed Dr. Wu remove the shrapnel from Tony's chest in surgery, making Tony free to never again worry about heart trouble.

====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
[[File:Rhodey-AOU.jpg|250px|thumb|right]]

Rhodes attended to the party of the Avengers at Avengers Tower. During the party, he told a funny anecdote to Thor and Tony, though the two of them did not amuse. Later at the party, Rhodes told the same story to other guests, who found funny the anecdote. When the party ended, Rhodes unsuccessfully tried to lift [[Mjolnir|Mjølnir]] with Tony Stark using a gauntlet of the War Machine Armor. When a scrapped robot known as [[Ultron]] awakened from Tony's lab and starts to attack the Avengers, Rhodes helps his allies and got knocked out of the window, but safe thanks to the bridge on the floored part of the tower. The next day, Rhodes and others discussed the events of the night before, as Stark revealed that he created Ultron to save the world.

When Nick Fury calls most of the former S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel to help the Avengers against Ultron, Rhodes is summoned and utilizes the War Machine Armor to assist the team in evacuating the civilians from the battle area within the half of Sokovia that Ultron's been set and use it to destroy humanity. During the battle, Rhodes said that if he survived would have a new story to tell.

After Ultron's defeat, Rhodes was recruited along with [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]], [[Vision]], and [[Scarlet Witch]] as new members of the Avengers.

==Trivia==
*In order to play the part of Rhodes, Marvel made Terrence Howard go through extensive military flight training, which Howard enjoyed. However, he never appears flying a jet in the finished film, making all of his training a waste.
*Terrence Howard did not reprise his role in the second film because negotiations had broken down with Marvel. Howard, because he was the first person cast in ''Iron Man'', had received the highest pay out of all the actors in the film, and Marvel had wanted to decrease his pay for the sequel. Howard, however, disagreed, and left the role. Cheadle was quickly contacted to replace Howard, and had only a few hours to accept or decline the role.
*His rank changes from Lt. Col. to just Col. in the films, possibly have gotten a promotion between after the events of ''Iron Man 2'' and before the events of ''Iron Man 3''.
