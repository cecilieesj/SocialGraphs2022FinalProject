==History==
He made his first appearance in "[[Recipe for Adventure]]" where he, along with his minion are on the plane to Bladasmorkia, where Gwumpki was asked to make his famous Yak Burger for the queen. There he manages to kidnap Gwumpki and take him to the Cave of the Orb where he revealed his plan.

It seems that long ago, a wizard created the Orb of Blintz, which dictated that anyone in possession of said orb will be the ruler of Bladasmorkia but after many people attempted to claim the orb, the last king of Bladasmorkia took the orb and placed it in the Cave of the Orb, where no one would ever get the orb again. However, centuries later Moltoc managed to learn the way to get the Orb. Turns out that Gwumpki's recipe for his Yak Burger (told by his minion) is the key to open the cave, because when the King placed the orb in the cave, a spell was cast to prevent it from being opened until it was revealed that it was the secret recipe that will open the Cave.

Moltoc first tried to threaten Gwumpki by burning marshmallows but when Gwumpki served him a burger with the wrong ingredients (which he made on propose), Moltoc became angry until his minion revealed that he captured Huey, Dewey and Louie, giving Moltoc the idea to to threaten to grind the boys into a meat grinder unless Gwumpki agreed to make the real recipe, which he did. This caused the cave to open, allowing Moltoc to get the Orb, but he was defeated by Donald's nephews and lost the Orb, which is now in the treasury of the castle.
