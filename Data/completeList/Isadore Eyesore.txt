'''Isadore Eyesore''' is an eye doctor who aids [[Goofy|Goofy's]] historical counterpart in getting glasses in the Goof History episode "[[Gunfight at the Okie-Doke Corral]]" from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
He tried to help [[Goofy|Mopalong Goofy]] when he noticed he was having problems seeing. However, Mopalong declined at first, but eventually accepted his offer.

===Personality===
Isadore is a kind person who cares about others' well-being. He is also patient, not pushing [[Goofy|Mopalong]] into getting glasses when he intially refused.

===Physical appearance===
Isadore is a short, overweight anthropomorphic dog with brown hair. He wears a green dress coat, a white collared shirt, a light brown vest, green dress pants, dark brown shoes, a black bowler hat with a green band, spectacles, and a black tie.

===Role in the series===
He only appears in the episode, "[[Gunfight at the Okie-Doke Corral]]". He attempts to give [[Goofy|Mopalong Goofy]] glasses when he notices he's having eye problems, but Mopalong stubbornly refuses until later in the episode, when he decides to give glasses a try.

==Trivia==
*Isadore's last name "Eyesore" is a word used to describe an ugly building, but is probably used to reference "sore eyes", since he is an optometrist.
