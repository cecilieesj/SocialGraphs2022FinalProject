==Appearances==
===''[[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue]]''===
[[Rob McGroarty|Rob]]'s Computer and Mouse play a major role in this film. They befriend [[Lampy]] when the Master uses him to shine his light on the screen. Rob was typing his college thesis entitled ''The Hidden Lives of Animals''. He had nearly finished when the electricity briefly went out; however, when Rob attempted to recover his thesis, the screen said: "NO FILE EXISTS." So, the Master and his girlfriend, [[Chris McGroarty|Chris]], decided to call their friend [[Charlie (The Brave Little Toaster)|Charlie]], a computer genius, to help them fix it. Charlie tried to fix the problem, but it was no use. He didn't know what was happening, but he told Rob that there must have been some computer virus.

The night, when [[Wittgenstein]] had gotten his power back, he returned the thesis to Rob's computer, but then gave him the list of animals that were being kidnapped on the truck to Tartarus Laboratories. Later, the next morning, every single page of Rob's thesis was printed, to which the Mouse said that the Master would be so happy, and indeed he was.

===''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''===
Computer and Mouse make a brief appearance in this film. During the "[[Home Again]]" sequence, on the way back from [[Mars]] and toward arriving home on Earth, they are both shown in Lampy and [[Radio]]'s daydream of them accompanying the Master for light and music while he is typing.
