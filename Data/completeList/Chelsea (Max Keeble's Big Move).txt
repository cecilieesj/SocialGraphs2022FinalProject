'''Chelsea''' is [[Jenna]]'s best friend in ''[[Max Keeble's Big Move]]''. 

==Role in the film==
Chelsea is seen walking down the hall at school with Jenna when [[Max Keeble|Max]] approaches them and says, "Hello sweetheart," to Jenna. This causes them to turn around and stand watching as Max is asked where is going by Ms. Dingman. 

Later on, Chelsea and Jenna are seen sitting in a booth at Buddy's, while they and a big group of local kids encourage Max — who is sitting in between them — to chug down milkshakes. The crowd cheers as he downs the last one! He lets out a loud belch and Chelsea and Jenna laugh. Chelsea tells him, "So, you did actually set up that whole 'monkey thing' at the cafeteria?" to which he replies "Well, actually Tad is a chimpanzee." Jenna chimes in impressed saying, "You're so devious!" Max then states, "Well, it's really part of my whole new attitude — what I like to call my 'phat-itude.'" 

Next Chelsea is seen dancing with the group of teens around the table Max and Jenna are dancing on top of. When [[Principal Elliot T. Jindrake|Principal Jindrake]] announces that art, music, P.E., and fun are discontinued, Chelsea turns to Jenna and says with sarcasm, "Great! Your boyfriend, Max Keeble, just got us hosed." Jenna returns the sarcasm in the look she gives to Chelsea, saying, "He's just my paperboy. I never really liked him." When the students crowd Max, [[Troy McGinty]], and [[Dobbs]] after school, Jenna and Chelsea look at each other with as much confusion as the rest of the students when one foreign football student one in English. When Max is victorious, the BFFs approach him to invite him to a party where only ninth graders are invited, to which he declines embarrassing Jenna and they walk off.
