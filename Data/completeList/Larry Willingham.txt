== Skills ==
Larry is a very skilled basketball player and was the former star player of the Timberwolves, but because of his skills, he views himself as a one-man team and is a ball hog.

== Role in the film ==
Larry bullied Josh, referring to him as the "waterboy", due to his position on the team as the manager, and even knocked him down while he was holding up a tackling dummy during a lay-up practice. When engineer [[Arthur Chaney]] took over the team after the former coach, [[Coach Barker|Joe Barker]] was caught pelting Tom Stewart with basketballs when he struggled to catch passes during a game, Larry continued to serve as the team's star player, until Arthur benched him during a game for being a ball hog and replaces him with Josh. Buck left the gym with him, angered with Arthur's decision.

Larry returned as a rival of the Timberwolves championship game, where Tom revealed to Josh that Buck moved the family to Spokane to play on the opposing Warriors team where Larry (or more specifically Buck) wouldn't be stopped from being the star player. Larry and the Warriors were able to take on an early lead, until [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]] returned and helped the Timberwolves catch up. Larry purposely fouled Buddy, who managed to make both free throw shots anyways, and also got Larry back by headbutting him in the groin and stealing the ball from him. The Timberwolves won the championship, with Larry finally congratulating Josh for his game-winning shot, referring to him as the "waterboy" again, but in good nature this time.
