'''C.B. Maroon''' is the twin brother of [[R.K. Maroon]], introduced in the graphic novel ''[[Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom]]'' and featured as a recurring character in the ''[[Roger Rabbit (comic book)|Roger Rabbit]]'' comic book. In the comics, C.B. takes over as head of the Maroon Cartoon Studios due to the death of his brother. He is very identical to his brother, to the point that when [[Roger Rabbit|Roger]] first meets him, he initially thinks that R.K. has come back to life.

Upon being captured by a resurrected disguised master criminal [[Judge Doom]] and his new [[Toon Patrol]], C.B. was impersonated by him into destroying Roger's life, then kill him, as well as other Toons and Eddie, until the real C.B. was found alive and also about to be killed as well, should Doom succeed his plans. Once Doom and his new Toon Patrol were killed by Dip and exposes their identities, the real C.B. reveals himself to the public and announce the grand re-opening of Maroon Cartoon Studios.
