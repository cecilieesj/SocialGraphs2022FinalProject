'''Alexander Hamilton''' is the dramatized version of the real life historical figure, and is the main character of the hit musical [[Hamilton]]. He is best known as one of the founding fathers of The United States of America. He is portrayed by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]].

==Personality==
Hamilton is first shown to be an educated, ambitious and charismatic young man, but his flaws lie in his impulsiveness, his arrogance, and pride which leads him to trouble on many occasions. Throughout the first act, he learns to mature and gains a sense of humility.  He is also incredibly charming gaining a lot of allies.

However throughout the second act he is much older, gaining a sense of wisdom, though his issues of self control and pride are what ultimately lead him to his death.

==Differences from History==
*While the real-life Alexander Hamilton did make some statements criticizing slavery early on into his political-career, the historic Alexander Hamilton was ultimately ambivalent to the cause.  Along with having personally owned several slaves (which were well documented to have been treated horribly), the historic Hamilton married into the Schuyler family who made their fortunes off the transportation of slaves.
*His relationship with the eldest Schuyler sister was heavily exaggerated and at many points outright fabricated by Miranda.
*The play Hamilton's choice of insisting that Hamilton was, an immigrant while technically true has been criticized for being misdirecting double-speak.  Namely in that the play characterizes his immigrant status as being comparable to refugees and persons of color aspiring to make names for themselves in America while Alexander Hamilton's immigrant status was part of a larger ethnic genocide against the indigenous-Americans who his government murdered and stole land from.
