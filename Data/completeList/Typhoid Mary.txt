|quote = }}'''Typhoid Mary '''is a Marvel comics character that appears in ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', played by Alice Eve, and in ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]].

Her real name is '''Mary Walker '''and, similarly to the [[Lizard (Marvel)|Lizard]], her villainous split personality is separate from her gentle, friendly and kind personality. As such, the benevolent Mary Walker transforms into the sinister Typhoid Mary against Walker's will, with the two personas fighting for control.

Typhoid Mary is skilled in several forms of hand-to-hand combat and is an expert swordswoman.

Due to ''Iron Fist'' being cancelled, it remains unknown if she was affected by [[Thanos]]' fingersnap.

Typhoid Mary was created by Ann Nocenti and John Romita Jr.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, she is a [[Mutants|Mutant]] with telekinesis, the ability to control minds and the ability to control fire.
