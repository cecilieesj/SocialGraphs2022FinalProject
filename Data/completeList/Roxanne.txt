'''Roxanne''' is an anthropomorphic female dog and the tritagonist of [[Disneytoon Studios|Disney]]'s animated film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995), where she served as the love interest to [[Max Goof]].

==Background==
Roxanne is a student from Max's high school. She is very beautiful, popular, kind, and friendly, as well as forgiving as shown in the end. Roxanne is best friends with [[Stacey]], the student body president. The film reveals that Max has had a crush on her for quite some time prior to the film's events, though he believes she hasn't noticed him because of him being fabulously unpopular.

In reality, Roxanne is shown to have a shared crush on Max as well, but is rather shy about it. After Max had fallen from the school's bleachers, Roxanne ran over to him, helped him up, and started giggling nervously when he began to stutter nervously at her. When he ran off in embarrassment of his goofy "Ah-hyuck!" laugh, Roxanne was left feeling confused and disappointed that he ran away from her. Later, during Max's performance at the school assembly, Roxanne is revealed to be both ecstatic and flattered by the special attention Max gives to her. When his identity is revealed before the entire school by an annoyed Principal Mazur, she gives a satisfied smile, happy that the unknown performer singer directly to her was the very same boy that she already liked. While in the principal's office, she stares and smiles at him longingly, but is nervous when Stacey motivates her to talk to him.

When Max finally gets to the courage to ask her out, she awkwardly and somewhat nervously accepts his offer, and is completely dejected when he later has to cancel their date. Though, she moves past it when Max convinces her—through a lie—that his reasons for canceling their date are impressive enough. When he later tells the truth and apologizes for lying. When he explains that wanted her to like him, she admits that she had already liked him, and forgives his lie as she believes it was in the right place. She accepts another date from him and is pleasantly surprised when he gives her a peck on the lips. 

Roxanne lives with her [[Roxanne's father|father]], who loves her intimately and is very protective of her. In return, she loves her father dearly, but occasionally needs to rein him in when he becomes too overprotective.

===Physical appearance===
Roxanne is an anthropomorphic, female, teenage humanoid dog with tan-colored skin and a brown nose, a beauty mark, long wavy red hair, thick red eyebrows, and a slim and curvy model.

She wears a short-sleeved teal T-shirt, navy blue jean shorts with a black belt with a round silver buckle, lavender earrings, and white flats.

In Max's dream-turned-nightmare at the beginning of the film, she is seen wearing a long white dress with a small, gold and bronze choker with a heart-shaped charm and a flower on the right side of her hair, and barefooted.

==Appearances==
===''[[A Goofy Movie]]''===
[[File:Roxanne Making a Date with Max.png|thumb|left|250px|Roxanne makes a date with Max.]]
Roxanne first appears in Max's dream, at the beginning of the film. She calls out to Max as he finds himself surrounded by wheat fields at evening sunset, and he finds her sitting atop a column in a large clearing surrounded by the fields. The two spend time together, but as she leans in to kiss him, Roxanne is frightened off when Max is unexpectedly shifted into Goofy, in a manner similar to a werewolf horror movie, while the wheat fields and evening sky around them change to thorn bushes and a stormy overcast to show the dream has become a nightmare. She can only scream in terror at the end just before Max is unable to prevent a Goofy laugh from escaping his throat, at which point Max wakes up in a cold sweat from the nightmare.

Later on, the real Roxanne walks down the street on her way to the school but doesn't notice Max waving to her from nearby (she likely just didn't see him). At school, she helps Max up after he falls from the bleachers when the other students laugh at him and walked off following the song "[[After Today]]". Max tries to say that he is alright, but stutters after he sees it’s her and lets out his "Ah-hyuck!" laugh by accident. Roxanne smiles at him, but Max runs off in embarrassment, to her confusion.

She is later seen in the audience during the school's last day assembly. Like the other students, she grows sleepy while listening to [[Principal Mazur]]'s boring speech about what to do over summer break as a boy named [[Chad]] takes the opportunity to ask her out to Stacey's 'end of school' party, but she presumably rejects him.

Suddenly, Principal Mazur falls through a trap door in the stage floor as a large projection screen rises up behind him and he is cut off mid-sentence over it, and someone dressed like [[Powerline]], a famous rock star, appears on stage, much to everyone's amazement, including an ecstatic Roxanne. As "Powerline" continues his performance with the song "[[Stand Out]]", he leans in towards Roxanne at one point, flattering her, and he is sent soaring into the air via a rope and nearly reaches for Roxanne's outstretched hand before his performance is suddenly cut short as the music slows and stops completely, and he is himself sent reeling right into the hands of the one who interrupted the performance, an annoyed Principal Mazur. The person is then revealed by Principal Mazur to be Max in a disguise, much to the other students' shock. Unknown to Roxanne, Max had staged the entire concert in an attempt to impress her, which worked as she smiled at him.

Roxanne is next seen walking with Stacey to the principal's office to get a paper that the latter needed. At first, Roxanne listens to Stacey talking incessantly about her party until her eyes and attention drift off in the direction of Max, who is sitting in the corner of the office. She smiles at Max without his noticing when Stacey notices this display, she nudges Roxanne to approach and talk to Max. By this point, it is made clear that Roxanne ''does'' like Max and is just as bashful and awkward around him as he is around her. Roxanne tries to get Max's attention by first clearing her throat before tapping his shoulder, which startles him into accidentally knocking her books and papers out of her hands. After a somewhat awkward talk between of them, they are able to better talk as Max asks her to go with him to a party that Stacey is hosting, where everyone will see a live telecast of Powerline in concert in Los Angeles, and Roxanne happily agrees. She is then escorted out of the office by Stacey after she and Max proceed to ramble on in their talk.

Unfortunately for Max, his antics from earlier at the assembly were reported by an enraged Principal Mazur in exaggerated details to his father, causing [[Goofy]] to fear the worst about Max's behavior and decide to take Max on an impromptu father-son road trip.

Later that afternoon, Max goes to Roxanne's house to cancel their date because of Goofy's decision to take him to Lake Destiny. When Max arrives, he meets [[Roxanne's father]] and nearly leaves out of fear before Roxanne appears to stop him and has her father step away. She nervously offers Max a seat on her porch before she notices her father spying and has him leave as she promises that her father will be better behaved when he picks her up for the party. However, Max tries to explain to her how he can't go with her to the party, which leaves Roxanne heartbroken. After she sadly says that she can find another date, Max impulsively lies to her. He tells Roxanne that he and Goofy are going to the Powerline concert in Los Angeles and that Goofy and Powerline know each other personally. He also tells her that they will be on stage with Powerline during the final number. Roxanne is suitably impressed and excitedly tells Max that she will see him on TV and kisses him on the cheek after he claims that he wouldn't cancel their date for anything. As he happily leaves, she wishes him luck at the concert and giggles as she walks inside, to his joy.

Near the end of the film, Roxanne is seen at Stacey's party watching the concert on TV with all the other party guests, but is worried since Max has, so far, not appeared on-stage with Powerline. Stacey tries to reassure her, despite her own anxiety over the situation, and indeed Max and Goofy soon appear on-stage and dance with Powerline, to Roxanne's joy and amazement. Later, she is seen copying Max's dance with Stacey and getting sprayed with Cheddar Whizzy by [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]].

[[File:Roxanne's first kiss.png|thumb|250px|Max kisses Roxanne at the end of the movie.]]
At the end of the film, Max goes back to Roxanne's house to tell her the truth and apologize. Roxanne congratulates him on his appearance at the concert, he is happy, but has to confess his lie to her, as she is somewhat confused and understandably disappointed by him making that up. When Max explains that his actions were meant to get Roxanne to like him, she is surprised by this, but surprises him back by revealing that she had already liked him, ever since the first time she heard his "Ah-hyuck!" laugh. She forgives Max's lie as it was in the right place and offers to get together with him later that night. Max cannot, as he has plans with Goofy, to which she is initially jokingly skeptical until he confirms it true. Instead, he offers to get together with her the next day and Roxanne accepts. When she offers her hand to make it a deal, Max instead pecks Roxanne on the lips, calling back to her own prior kiss given to him. She is surprised by this, but happy, and they both laugh. They then notice Goofy, who is working on his car. The car explodes from the damage it sustained during Goofy's and Max's trip, and Goofy is blown into the air; he falls right through the roof of Roxanne's porch. Max then takes the opportunity to introduce Roxanne to Goofy.

Roxanne does not appear in the sequel ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. It is not known what happened to her between films, but it is possible that she and Max may no longer be together by that film's point since, in the movie, Max is seen giving a flirtatious look to a girl at a clothing store, and then offers another girl the seat next to him in class (but Goofy ends up taking the said seat, leaving the girl to instead sit next to [[Bradley Uppercrust III]] when he offers her the seat next to him) and later accepts an offer from this same girl to dance with her at a nightclub. Both of these girls reappear throughout the film in the background as fans of Max at the College X-Games, cheering him on along with several other girls.

Eventually, Roxanne would evidently return to Max's love life in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Max's Embarrassing Date]]", in which she is a guest and goes on a date with Max at the titular [[House of Mouse (night club)|House of Mouse]] (see below).

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:Max's date.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Roxanne on her date with Max at House of Mouse.]]
Roxanne appears in the episode "[[Max's Embarrassing Date]]", taking place at some point after "[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]". On Max's night off from work,  Roxanne comes to the [[House of Mouse (night club)|House of Mouse]] for a dinner date with him. As Max feared Goofy would embarrass them, he had arranged for Mickey and the other members of the club's staff to keep Goofy too busy to visit Max and Roxanne on their date. Upon her arrival, Roxanne was impressed by the venue and the reserved seating Max had prepared for the two of them. And with the others keeping Goofy distracted, Max's date with Roxanne seemed set to be perfect.

However, things quickly took a turn for the worse as the actions of Mickey and friends proceeded to embarrass Max and Roxanne even worse than Goofy would have, with everyone doting on them when they just want to be left alone with each other. Roxanne tries to make the most of it, but it isn't until Max finally speaks out and Goofy intervenes that the couple is at last allowed to have some privacy, with Roxanne personally thanking Goofy for being their waiter. At the end of their date, Roxanne says that despite all of the commotion and embarrassments, this was the best date she ever had and could not wait to come back again.

At the end of the night, still images of Roxanne and Max are seen in the club's sponsorship ad for ''Sebastian's Guide to Romance'', in which the two (along with [[Ursula]]) are shown reenacting scenes from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
[[File:Roxanne DT.jpg|thumb|250px|Roxanne and Max in Ducktales reboot]]
In the episode "[[Quack Pack!]]", Roxanne makes a cameo appearance in one of Goofy's wallet photographs while showing to [[Donald Duck|Donald]]. In the picture, it shows her standing with Max while dressed in formal wear as though the two were going to a school dance together. While Roxanne looks a bit shy but still very pleased to be with him, Max sweats nervously and hesitates to put his arm around her.

==Printed media==
===''Goofy Gets Goofy''===
Prior to the release of ''A Goofy Movie'', Roxanne briefly appeared in the 1994 Mouse Works funny face book ''[[Goofy Gets Goofy]]'' (which, itself, is an adaptation of the Powerline concert scene from the movie). At the very end of the story, Roxanne is seen with two of Max's friends (who appear to be Bobby and P.J.) watching Max, Goofy, and Powerline dancing together on TV, much to Roxanne's surprise.

===''[[Disney Adventures]]'' comics===
[[File:Roxanne in comics.jpg|thumb|250px|Roxanne in ''Disney Adventures''.]]
After the release of ''A Goofy Movie'', Roxanne appeared in two ''[[Goof Troop]]'' comic strips published in ''[[Disney Adventures]]''. In the first story, "My Hero" (printed in the October [[1995]] issue), Roxanne is seen in class with Max, P.J., and Stacey, in which they watch an old film about a heroic figure who rescues a damsel in distress. Impressed by the hero's actions, Roxanne wishes to herself that she could meet a guy like him, which Max overhears. With assistance from P.J. and Bobby, Max tries to set up potentially dangerous situations from which to save Roxanne as her hero. But, Max instead ends up saving first [[Stacey]] and then Bobby, respectively, in his first two attempts. On his third attempt, Max tries to save Roxanne from a fake python placed in the school's Biology lab, but the sight of a real python in the lab startles him into passing out, leaving it to Roxanne to subdue the snake and be Max's heroine instead.

Roxanne's other appearance in the ''Disney Adventures'' comics was in what was notably the magazine's final ''Goof Troop'' comic, "Gorilla in Our Midst" (in the April [[1997]] issue). In this story, a gorilla named Mr. Kong moves in next door to Goofy and Max. Max and P.J. think that Mr. Kong is a monster, and his constant snoring prevents Max from getting any sleep at night. The next day, when Max shows up late for his movie date with Roxanne and explains his problem to her, Roxanne goes over to Mr. Kong's house and tells him that he needs to stop snoring so loudly. Upon hearing Roxanne tell him this, Mr. Kong politely apologizes for the inconvenience, revealing to Max that he's actually a nice guy and the noises were just from some movies starring him.

===''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]''===
On [[February 12]], [[1997]], Issue #2330 of the French magazine ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' published a special ''Dingo & Max''<ref>"Goofy & Max", the French title of ''A Goofy Movie''</ref> comic which featured Roxanne and others from ''A Goofy Movie''. In this story, titled "Je T'Ayuck" ("I Ayuck You"),<ref>A play on the phrase "Je T'Aime", which is French for "I Love You"</ref> when Max goes to buy a bouquet of roses as a birthday present for Roxanne, he and P.J. are shocked to see Roxanne across the street, kissing another guy and seemingly accepting his offer for her to become the guy's girlfriend. When Max follows the pair to spy on them, he is further mortified to see the couple having their photo taken at the children's photo studio in the mall department store where his dad works, with said photo taken by none other than Goofy himself! That night, Max has a nightmare in which Roxanne runs past Max into the embracing arms of "Jimmy", the other guy from earlier.

The next day, Max learns from P.J. that what he and Max saw the other day was all an act, as Roxanne and "Jimmy" (whose real name is revealed to be Hubert; "Jimmy" is his character's name) are set to perform the lead couple in a surprise school play to be performed in honor of Valentine's Day. Overjoyed that Roxanne really hasn't fallen for another guy, Max's relief is short-lived as he then spots Roxanne crying. Stacey explains that Hubert got sick and won't be able to perform in the play, leaving Roxanne devastated that the play will have to be canceled, after all their hard work. Wanting to make her happy again, Max offers to perform with Roxanne in Hubert's place. Later, the play goes off without a hitch as Max and Roxanne perform onstage before the whole school. In the play's final scene, the two go off-script by using their real names instead of "Jimmy" and "Laetitia", and Roxanne pulls Max into a kiss on the lips before he can finish his final line of "I love you", which Roxanne finishes for him by saying "Me too, Max."

===''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas (graphic novel)|Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''===
Though Roxanne herself does not feature in the direct-to-DVD special ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'', having been replaced by [[Mona]], she is briefly mentioned once in the special's comic book adaptation.

En route to his father's house for Christmas, Max worries about introducing his lady friend Mona to Goofy out of fear that his dad's goofiness might ruin his chances of making Mona his new girlfriend, and hopes to himself that his father will be on his best behavior for Mona, "Not like with Roxanne!"

It has been theorized that Roxanne did not appear because her thick red hair would have been too hard to animate with the CGI animation at the time and with the movie's budget.

==Trivia==
*Since Roxanne appears at the end of the Mouse Works 'funny face' book ''[[Goofy Gets Goofy]]'' (which was published on October 1, 1994), that book would actually be her very first appearance since its release predates that of ''A Goofy Movie'' (April 7, 1995).
**Though, her color scheme in that book differs from her finalized appearance in the movie: Her hair is strawberry-blonde instead of reddish-orange, her shirt is purple instead of teal green, her pants are pink instead of dark blue, and her belt is silver instead of black.
*According to character designer [[Carole Holliday]] in ''[[The Making of A Goofy Movie]]'', when developing the character of Roxanne, director [[Kevin Lima]] wanted "a character who was 13 years old, and spunky and the most popular girl in the school." In the finalized version of the film, however, she is downplayed and these traits aren't quite as apparent:
**In the movie, she behaves less "spunky" and shyer and a little awkward (if adorably so), expressing nervousness and hesitance at times when wanting to talk to Max. However, she does display a bit more spunk in her two ''Goof Troop'' comic strip appearances from ''Disney Adventures'', in which she first fends off a python in "My Hero" and later stands up to the imposing Mr. Kong in "Gorilla in Our Midst".
**Her popularity, meanwhile, is merely implied through her friendship with the very popular student body president Stacey, her being asked out by Chad (a popular older student), and through Max's own sense of social inferiority towards her, believing her to be one who is out of his league and never notices him (unbeknownst to him, this is untrue).
**As for her age, it is unlikely for her to be 13 during the movie's time since it is set at the end of a high school year, and the youngest age a high schooler (specifically, a ninth-grader) can be at the end of a school year in the U.S. is 14 (unless she was gifted enough to have skipped a grade, which the movie gives no evidence to support or deny).
*Also according to Holliday, Roxanne's official production biography for ''A Goofy Movie'' states that her favorite song is "{{WikipediaLink|Roxanne_(The_Police_song)|Roxanne}}" by English rock band {{WikipediaLink|The Police}}, which Holliday notes is ironic considering how innocent a character Roxanne is.<ref name="/Film" />
*According to the demo version of the song [[On the Open Road]], Roxanne was originally named Dolores.
*The most likely reason for why Roxanne (and [[Stacey]]) was absent from the events of ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' was because, like how other members of the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' TV series who were absent from ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (e.g. - [[Peg Pete|Peg]], [[Pistol Pete|Pistol]], [[Waffles]], and [[Chainsaw (Goof Troop)|Chainsaw]]) simply didn't factor enough into that movie's father-son story to warrant an appearance for them. She likewise, simply didn't factor into any of the ''three'' main plots of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'': Goofy's and Max's "father & son at college" story, Max's College X-Games story, and Goofy's "return to college for a degree" story.
*In ''A Goofy Movie'', Roxanne has four fingers like normal, but in ''House of Mouse'', she has five.
*When Roxanne gets excited or nervous, she plays with her hair.
*Although Roxanne's father looks like a bulldog, she doesn't resemble him in any way, therefore she might resemble her mother.
*In the above-described ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' comic, Roxanne sports a different color scheme than the one seen in ''A Goofy Movie'', the two ''Goof Troop'' comics from ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', and ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Her hair is colored bright yellow blonde instead of reddish-orange; her nose is colored pinkish tan instead of brown; her shirt is lime green instead of teal green; her shorts are bright red instead of dark blue; her earrings are likewise bright red instead of either lilac (''A Goofy Movie'' and "My Hero"), dark red ("Gorilla in Our Midst"), or white (''House of Mouse''); her belt buckle is bright yellow instead of gray/silver; and her shoes are black instead of white.
*Also according to that French comic, Roxanne's birthday is in February, on a day that comes both before and very close to (if not specifically on) Valentine's Day.
*On [[July 27]], [[2021]], the [[1996]] French graphic novel adaptation of ''A Goofy Movie'' was fully adapted into English by Fantagraphics. This new English adaptation added in some new pieces of info not found in either the original French version or in the movie itself. In regards to Roxanne, one of the new things added to this translation was Roxanne's full first and last name given as '''Roxanne Rover'''.
