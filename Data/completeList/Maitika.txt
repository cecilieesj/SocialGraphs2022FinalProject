'''Maitika''' is a minor character from ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]''. She is [[Mimi-Siku Cromwell|Mimi Siku]]'s pet tarantula. 

At one point, she escapes from her cage and causes utter chaos until Mimi finds her. He then puts her back in her cage, calling her a "bad girl" and tells her to stay in her cage. 

During the film's climax, she aids Mimi in fighting off a gang of Russian mobsters when Mimi drops her on [[Alexei Jovanovic]]'s back, and she crawls up to the top of his head.
