Her son [[Captain Crandall|Crandall]] addresses her as "'''Earth-Mom'''" due to his belief that he is an alien superhero. She seems oblivious of the fact that her son and his two friends [[Skate Lad|Hector]] and [[Rope Girl|Brenda]] are secretly the superheroes known as Teamo Supremo, but it is shown at the end of the last episode of the series that she has actually been secretly aware of it the whole time, and it is also implied that she knows something about Crandall's hidden superpowers.
