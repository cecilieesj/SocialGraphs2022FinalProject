==History==
Daphne was slightly over-obsessed with Justin but Justin didn't reciprocate his feelings for her, though she didn't notice this. She comes to the Russo Home during Family Game Night. The game goes well until halfway through the games, when Jerry and Theresa fight about Alex cheating, and Daphne is spooked by their aggressive behavior and odd personality causing her to tell Justin to "never bring a girl home!" and then leave.
