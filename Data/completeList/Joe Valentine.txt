'''Joeâ€‹ Valentine''' (voiced by [[Billy West]] in the Nickelodeon series and by Fred Newman in the Disney series): [[Skeeter Valentine|Skeeter]] and Dale's father. Has a tendency to have short-term memory loss. He also has a foul temper, normally trying to count on himself, but he always skips to 10 after getting to 2, and normally turning beet red when angered (Mostly at [[Doug Funnie|Doug]] and Skeeter).

==Trivia==
* Joe may actually have dementia judging by his short temper and short term memory loss.
