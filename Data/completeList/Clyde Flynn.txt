He lives in [[Danville]]'s woods and hosts Camp Phineas and Ferb. He is not a very good bugler, but loves to sing and entertain the children. He often tells stories that he heard in his childhood like Bigfoot and Badbeard. He is not only a story teller, he is a color commentator as stated by Phineas for the roller rink commentary, but rather than adding "color" to the information, he actually said the names of different colors ('''Clyde:''' "Red, green, blue!" Phineas:"Excellent colors, grandpa"). He is the father of [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda Flynn]] and [[Tiana Webber]]. He's also the grandfather of[[ Phineas Flynn]] and [[Candace Flynn]], and step-grandfather of [[Ferb Fletcher]].
