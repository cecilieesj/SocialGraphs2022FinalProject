'''King Arthur''' is an anthropomorphic lion based on the legendary {{WikipediaLink|King Arthur}}. Resembling previous Disney characters such as [[King Richard]] or [[King Leonidas]], he appears in the [[Thanks a Camelot|eleventh episode]] of ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Thanks a Camelot]]", King Arthur is shown to have become immortal after he and his Knights of the Round Table found the Holy Grail of Immortality, and is thus still around in the present day for [[Donald Duck]], [[Panchito Pistoles]], and [[José Carioca]] to meet. [[Xandra]], the Goddess of Adventure, takes the trio to Camelot in the hopes that Arthur will train them to be great heroes and warriors, as he had for the first Three Caballeros centuries ago.

Unfortunately, she out finds that Arthur has since given up on traditional combat training and has now become a pep-talk-giving, catchphrase-spouting, inefficient coach, of whom the Knights of the Round Table are too scared to tell him off. All of a sudden, however, King Arthur finally realizes the error of his ways and treatment to Xandra, the Caballeros, and the Knights of the Round Table, and helps Xandra fight off the dragon accidentally summoned by [[April, May, and June]].

Arthur leads Xandra and the Caballeros to a room where his weapons are at. He then shows hall of weapons where they would get something to fight the dragon to which Panchito, José, and Donald grabs weapons to ready themselves while Xandra brought her bow to help fight the dragon with courage. Suddenly at the throne room where the Grail is at, Tyrone, the red dragon, bursts in and attempts to consume the Grail to which Xandra and the Caballeros arrive and prepare to fight the dragon but are having trouble defeating it just as Xandra asks Arthur to find real help.

Later when the dragon Tyrone corners Arthur, Xandra, and the Caballeros, the Knights of the Round Table, Lancelot, Galahad, Kay, and Bors, decide to help their king alongside Xandra and the Caballeros. Fortunately, April then throws the scroll into the fire, which destroys the dragon. With the dragon destroyed, everyone in Camelot celebrates their victory in defeating the dragon and protecting the Grail. 

Arthur thanks Xandra for showing him how to be a king of action again just like he was with the original Three Caballeros. Arthur then decides to give the classic hero training course worthy of the Three Caballeros to the Knights of the Round Table to which they agree. Arthur then trains the Caballeros like what he did before in the past.

In "[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]", Arthur is summoned via zoom point during the final battle against Sheldgoose where he engages in duel with the Tengu, causing the two to engage in a swordfight. Later when [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] prepares for a new age of darkness, Arthur is sent back to Camelot via zoom point as it is shown that the reinforcements summoned during the final battle are sent back to their respective homes. Even after the final battle has ended, it is likely that Arthur remains in Camelot where he still serves his duty as king.

==Trivia==
*Prior to his proper appearance in "Thanks a Camelot", King Arthur can be briefly seen in the prologue sequence in the first episode, "[[Dope-a Cabana]]".
