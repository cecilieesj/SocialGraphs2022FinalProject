==Background==
===Physical Description===
Rita is a short elderly woman with white hair tied in a bun. She wears a pink (sometimes green) dress and purple glasses. She wears a nurse's attire in the end of the episode.

===Personality===
Rita appears to be cranky, grumpy, and mean. Since she is a librarian, she wants to have peace and quiet. When [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] make some noise at the library, she first kicks them out and then hit the two with a baseball bat.

==Role in the series==
Rita is a grumpy old librarian who appeared in three episodes: "[[Shopping Mauled]]", "[[Library Brouhaha]]", and "[[I Think I Canada]]".

==="[[Shopping Mauled]]"===
Rita made her first appearance in "Shopping Mauled" with a group of other one-off characters.

==="[[Library Brouhaha]]"===
In "Library Brouhaha", Rita is the secondary antagonist and was shown to believe strongly in silence in the library and kicked Timon and Pumbaa out several times when they made a noise trying to catch and eat a bookworm. She also hit a bluebird over the head with her book when the animal started singing on her windowsill. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that she is a nurse when Timon, Pumbaa, and the bookworm get injured and are at a hospital.

==="[[I Think I Canada]]"===
Rita makes her final appearance in "I Think I Canada". She appears when Pumbaa enters the Maze of Challenges. After [[Wolverine (Timon & Pumbaa)|the Wolverine]] tells Pumbaa that the final step is for him to eat the warthog, Pumbaa runs away and the wolverine chases him. While the wolverine chases Pumbaa, he gets caught by all the obstacles including Rita.

==Trivia==
*Her name is a wordplay on the sentence: "Read a book."
