He is designed to use his deceptively small roller to level entire cities. His one true place is paving roads.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Splat is a large green experiment, with two cone-shaped yellow-striped antennae, yellow patches around his eyes, three yellow stripes on his rear legs, and a small roller between his front legs.

===Special Abilities===
Splat can use the small roller between his front legs to level roads and other surfaces.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 519 was the 519th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to level entire cities with his deceptively small roller. 519 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At some point, 519 was activated, captured, tamed, and named Splat.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Splat was seen when [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to check on all of the experiments, and she noticed Splat doing his job for a construction worker.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Splat, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Splat participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Splat is very similar to [[Derrick]] in that they both do construction work.
*Splat and [[Mulch]] are the only known experiments to have a set of rollers as limbs. In Splat's case, they are his front limbs.
