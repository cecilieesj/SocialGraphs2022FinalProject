==Role in the episode==
Juice-Lee is a master fighting fish who lives in Chinatown. [[Fat Cat]] and [[Fat Cat's Gang|his gang]] go to show the Siamese Twins the ruby and he wants to use Juice-Lee for his master plan. Mole is unsure about Juice-Lee's fighting skills and the twins call for a test to see how well Lee is at fighting. Everyone sees that he can attack some piranhas and Fat Cat is satisfied and takes him.

Fat Cat and his gang bring Juice-Lee to a large cargo boat and use him to get rid of the nearby sailors. As the sun rises, Fat Cat sends Lee to punch holes on other boats so that his gang can steal the fish some fishermen captured.

Juice Lee then sees [[Chip and Dale|the two chipmunks]], [[Monterey Jack]], and [[Zipper]] heading to the cargo boat using a ship in a bottle and follows them there. When the gang climbs on an anchor, Lee breaks it in half so Chip and Dale can fall off. He chases the chipmunks until he gets sucked into a pipe. He later flies out of the boat and lands in a glass of water with teeth inside.

==Trivia==
*Juice-Lee was based on and named after the Hong Kong American martial artist actor, [[wikipedia:Bruce Lee|Bruce Lee]].
