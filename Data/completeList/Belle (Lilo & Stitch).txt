===Powers and abilities===
Belle can emit a loud, high-pitched scream to scare people by using her big mouth.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 248 was the 248th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to terrify enemies into submission with an ear-piercing scream. 248 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point, Experiment 248 was possibly activated in a rainstorm and haunted the Ali'i Trail.

One night after 248 had been activated, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and [[Pleakley]] were all hiking the Ali'i Trail to search for the {{WikipediaLink|Nightmarchers|Night Marchers}} (an ancient [[Hawaii]]an legend).

After hiking for half an hour, Stitch detected something with his night vision. He caught a glimpse of 248 inside some bushes and saw a trail of footprints. Stitch then notified Lilo and the others, though Mertle refused to believe it was the Night Marchers.

When it suddenly started to rain, everyone took shelter in a makeshift tent. Lilo, Mertle, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley then told each other scary stories. When Lilo finished telling her story, the group heard 248's shrieks, which were mistaken for that of Night Marchers and scared everyone.

Jumba later recognized the scream as one of his experiments, making Stitch excited and Lilo worried, stating that they have to find 248 before the Night Marchers do. The group went on an experiment search and found 248 standing on a rock. Lilo decided to name her Belle, a nickname relating to the term decibel.

Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley managed to get a hold of Belle, but she soon ran off into a cave to [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who was pretending to be a Night Marcher to get her. However, Belle's piercing screams were too much for Gantu and Mertle (who had talked Gantu into this earlier), and they begged Lilo and the others to take her.

After Jumba sucked Gantu up with a vacuum while mocking his Night Marcher antics, Belle was shortly after taken back [[Lilo's House|home]], where Lilo found her one true place as [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s alarm clock.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Belle, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Belle did not participate in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], instead choosing to retreat with the weaker experiments.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.
