==Appearances==
===Team Mascot===
[[File:WildwingMacotDisney.jpg|thumb|250px|The Wildwing walkaround mascot during Disney's ownership of the team]]Wildwing got his name when a "Name the Mascot" contest was held when the team was being established, with the selected name being chosen for fitting the character well. Besides appearing as a walkaround mascot, a statue of Wildwing was also erected outside the stadium.

When Wildwing makes his appearances, he usually comes down from the rafters onto the ground, though this has occasionally led to some accidents. When Disney sold the team, Wildwing was retained as the team mascot as a result of fan demand and popularity, though his uniform colors would change the same as the rest of the team.

===[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)]]===
Saved by Canard back on Puckworld, Wildwing Flashblade is the leader of the Ducks on and off the ice. At first reluctant to take charge after [[Canard Thunderbeak|Canard]] disappeared, eventually he comes to accept the role of leadership. As a hockey player, he's the goalie, known for his ability to take any kind of beating and still remain standing. Brave like Canard before him, Wildwing is also intelligent and just. He usually plays the straight man to the other ducks and protector to his younger brother [[Nosedive Flashblade|Nosedive]]. Along with the mask of Drake DuCaine, Wildwing uses body armor and a Puck Launcher on his left gauntlet. His jersey number is 00.

Along with the mask of Drake DuCaine, Wildwing uses body armor, a Puck Launcher on his left gauntlet, and an Ice Sheild on his right gauntlet.
