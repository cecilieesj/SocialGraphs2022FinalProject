'''Ernest''' is a nicely-dressed brown bear who plays a fiddle in the Disney theme park attraction, ''[[Country Bear Jamboree]]''.
==Biography==
From 1972's Country Bear Jamboree record album:

''Ernest the Dude is a modern Beau Brummell, the well-dressed bear-about-town. He carries his wardrobe with him wherever he goes, which is difficult (not many motorists will pick up a bear hitchhiker with 17 trunks of clothes). He has 30 coats and 40 slacks (some of which fit), 60 shirts, 47 shoes, 20 hats and a pair and a half of underwear. Each year, when the Ten Best Dressed are announced, Ernest the Dude is there (wondering why he isnâ€™t on the list).''
