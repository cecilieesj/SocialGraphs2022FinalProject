==Role in the series==
Probabilitor is the leader of a group of mythical creatures and revealed to be the greatest wizard in all "mathology", give or take an error of 0.4. He succeeded in capturing [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Ford Pines|Ford]], with some assistance from Hot Elf, an ogre and the griffin. He revealed that wanted to eat their brains so that he could gain their intelligence. He later challenges [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] and [[Stan Pines|Stan]] to a board game of Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons. During the game, the Probabilitor conjures different spells and summons various creatures that the humans fight against, including the Ogre-nado and the Impossibeast. In the end, he loses to Stan and Mabel, and is then whisked back to his home dimension, never to be seen again.

==Trivia==
*Probabilitor's weaknesses are prime statistical anomalies over 37 but not exceeding 51.
*In the '90s during the period that the creators of the game tried to make it "cooler", Probabilitor's name was changed to Probabilitizzle.
