Around 2018, years after the Country Bear Theater was removed from Disneyland's Critter Country, Sammy was put onto a mural for recycling bins near Splash Mountain.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844WrBxlEKE A video] in the Walt Disney World Goat Friends YouTube series is centered around [[Billy the Disney Goat|Billy]] the [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]] goat giving him an existential crisis when suggesting that as a hat on a hat, he should start wearing a hat with a raccoon on it and endlessly stacking more raccoons in hats on top of that for infinity. The video ends with the terrified Sammy retreating back into Henry's hat.
