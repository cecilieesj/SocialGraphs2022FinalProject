== History ==
Dr. Grant Seeker was a scientist working for the [[Dino Institute]] in Diggs County, [[Florida]] during the late-20th/early-21st century. Dr. Seeker worked under the institute's director [[Dr. Helen Marsh]] and managed field studies with the CTX-Time Rovers to study live dinosaurs. As the institute required funds, this also meant that Dr. Seeker headed Time Rover missions used by the institute for tourism.

On one field-study, Seeker's team probed [[Aladar|an iguanodon]] which allowed them to track the dinosaur's location to the late Cretaceous. Due to the proximity of the targeted time to the meteor impact which resulted in the KT-Extinction event, Dr. Marsh indefinitely suspended the mission to retrieve the iguanodon. Dr. Seeker subsequently went behind Dr. Marsh's back and hijacked civilian tourist Time Rover tour to retrieve the iguanodon.

This mission turned to near disaster as the Time Rover was pursued by a ''[[Carnotaurus|Carnotaurus Robustus Floridaensis]]'' amidst the oncoming meteor shower. At last minute, the rover found the iguanodon and brought it back to present day at which point the animal went rampant throughout the Dino Institute. The iguanodon escaped from the facility and went missing with Seeker continuing to keep the event a secret from Dr. Marsh.
