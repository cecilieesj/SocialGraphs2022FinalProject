==History==

=== Background ===
Haunting the legends of the [[Arbori]] tribe, Q’aráq roams the waterways and caverns of Apu Taku, the Roaring Mountain, ferociously lunging at any travelers trespassing on its domain. Because of this, the Arbori have given the creature the title of "Guardian of the Waters" and revere it for its role in protecting the endless flows of water from Apu Taku's peaks.

== Appearances ==

=== [[Adventure Isle (Shanghai Disneyland)|Adventure Isle]] ===
As a mythological creature in the Arbori's pantheon, tribal artwork of <span style="font-weight:normal;line-height:1.5em;">Q’aráq can be seen throughout the land in carvings and cave paintings.</span>

=== Roaring Rapids ===
In the Roaring Rapids attraction, guest rafts flow through the beast's cave, seeing a massive shadow moving along one of the cave walls. After going down a dark drop, the beast is revealed perched on a rock, snapping its massive jaws at the rafts and roaring, though the rafts make a quick escape.

=== [[Soarin'|Soaring Over the Horizon]] ===
<span style="font-weight:normal;line-height:1.5em;"> He also appears amongst the celestial animal spirits in the queue for Soaring Over the Horizon, though in a more mundane crocodilian form.  It also has one of the constellations seen in the observatory.</span>

==Trivia==
*Q'araq resembles a prehistoric crocodile called Kaprosuchus.
*The audio-animatronic of Q'araq is victim to heavy malfunctions and as a result, most of its body is static as it roars while it was designed to lunge its body towards guests.
*Q'araq is similar to the [[Yeti]] from [[Expedition Everest]] in being a territorial giant known by natives at the base of the mountain where it inhabits.  It is also similar in that it is dubious to what extent it is magical and to what it is scientific.
**Both animatronics are also known for consistently malfunctioning.
