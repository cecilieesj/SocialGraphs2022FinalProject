}}'''Dim Long''' (点长 ''Diǎn zhǎng'') is an illegal genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba]], and [[Jumba's Chinese Experiments|the fourth experiment he created]] in [[China]] based on what he learns in ancient Chinese scrolls.

==Background==
Following Jumba's creation of two cliff dragons who had a child together, Jumba created Dim Long, a small dragon Jumba created as a beta-test to perfect the ''qi'' power that ancient creatures used for flight so he could utilize it in future experiments, which he did with his next experiment, the Xiezhi. Unlike the other experiments Jumba created in China, Dim Long does not live in the pocket dimension he created to house them. Instead, he lives with Jumba, [[Stitch]], and [[Pleakley]] at [[Wang Ai Ling|Ai]]'s family home, making him a recurring character in ''[[Stitch & Ai]]''.

==Biology==
===Physical appearance===
Dim Long is a small dragon experiment with orange fur, a dark orange nose, brown stripes on his back, and yellow antlers, his right one of which is apparently permanently broken, is partially miscolored brown, and has a bandage wrapped around the base. The insides of his ears and the fur flaring at the tip of his tail are yellow. His mouth is big for his head with two teeth sticking out from his long jaw, giving him a prominent underbite. He has four tiny limbs with only two digits on each limb. Unlike [[Experiments|traditional experiments]], he has regular eyes with white sclerae and black pupils.

He was temporarily enlarged by Jumba in "Dragon Parade" to replace an accidentally destroyed dragon puppet. He was returned to his original size off-screen by the next episode.

===Special abilities===
Dim Long's only ability is the ability to fly without wings using ''qi'' energy. He is a particularly zippy flier, although he can be a bit out of control.

===Weaknesses===
As he is a very small creature whose only purpose is to prove that it's possible for Jumba to make creatures who can fly without wings, he's physically weak and not capable of combat, although he was able to kick [[Pleakley]] in the face to knock him over.

==Trivia==
*Dim Long is the first and only experiment Jumba created in [[China]] that was created specifically as a beta test creature for another experiment.
*Dim Long is the only regular recurring experiment other than [[Stitch]] in ''[[Stitch & Ai]]''.
*His appearance looks similar to [[Mushu]] from ''[[Mulan]]''.
