==Background==
Lilliput worked at the miniature golf course, "Goony Golf", and was using a strange hat to communicate with and control ants. With his tiny minions, and his trusty shrink ray, he began turning [[St. Canard]]'s monuments into miniature props for his golf course. This is essentially his modus operandi, as well as collecting some cash along the way. He is defeated when he shrinks [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]] down to the size of the germ, and the caped crusader "infects" him.

Apparently, symptoms of Darkwing-itis involve one's face turning green and spotted, and is accompanied by uncontrollable sneezing. See your local doctor immediately, if symptoms worsen into a pervasive urge to wear a cape and speak in obsessive alliteration.

Lilliput appears in the episode "[[Getting Antsy]]", and makes a cameo with the villains who stole the [[S.H.U.S.H.]] Agency List in "In Like Blunt". He later appeared in [[Boom! Studios]] and [[Joe Books]]' revival comics, first as a member of the League of Barely-Remembered Supervillains in "[[Campaign Carnage]]" and later as one of the inmates of St. Canard's new maximum-security prison in "[[Orange is the New Purple]]".

==Trivia==
* His defeat in ''Let's Get Antsy'' is similar to [[Madame Mim]]'s. For after a battle with the hero, the hero is turned into a germ who infects him.
