'''Nadar Kessard''', better known as the '''Health Inspector''', is a minor character of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Ratatouille]]''.

==Background==
The health inspector has no outright hatred for the protagonists, but he is rather just performing the job he was hired to do: inspecting restaurants for cleanliness standards. When the [[Rat Colony|rats]] chase and catch him, they use coils of rope, tie him up and put him in the food closet, along with a later captured [[Chef Skinner]]. In the final scene, [[Remy]] says that there was no way the rats could have kept Skinner nor the health inspector detained indefinitely, and later had to free both of them.

==Role in the film==
[[Chef Skinner|Skinner]] calls the health inspector on a public phone outside [[Gusteau's]] to report a rat infestation. The inspector replies with him coming to check the restaurant in three months time. Skinner protests but the inspector promises a sooner visit if someone else cancels an inspection. When Skinner tries to protest again, the inspector hangs up on him.

On the next day, before [[Remy]] and the other rats start cooking, the inspector comes in the restaurant, dropping his documents at the sight of all the rats. Stunned by what he saw, he runs to his car, with [[Django]] and some other rats covering the entire car while he tries to start it. The car eventually starts and reverses away, but later crashes after [[Colette Tatou|Collette]] returns. Then, the health inspector is seen tied up and being thrown in the food locker (Skinner later landed next to him, who was also imprisoned) by the rats. Near the end of the film, Remy says they could not keep the health inspector, nor Skinner, imprisoned in the food locker forever and were forced to release both of them, which ultimately led to the closure of Gusteau's for health violations.

==Trivia==
*The inspector said that he would come to the restaurant within three months, and if someone cancels one inspection, he will slot [[Chef Skinner|Skinner]] in. However, he comes on the next day, assuming the fact someone cancelled the inspection.
*If he was kept tied up in the food locker along with Skinner, they could have possibly died inside as the room has no ventilation.
*According to ''Ratatouille: The Junior Novelization'', his real name is Nadar Lessard.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=0Cb5XLMggrIC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=ratatouille+nadar+lessard&source=bl&ots=cEV30GX-f_&sig=yCpbWpPhO0t4-7KQcW-aYF5rrk0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QBpgVO7yOJO_sQTqvYKABw&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=ratatouille%20nadar%20lessard&f=false]</ref>
*His car is based on a Smart Fortwo.
*Jamie Oliver's voice was only heard in the theatrical version in the UK; Tony Fucile's voice was retained on DVD/Blu-ray releases.
