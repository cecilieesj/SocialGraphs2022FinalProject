'''April''', '''May''', and '''June''' are [[Daisy Duck]]'s triplet nieces, created by [[Carl Barks]]. They are the female counterparts of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
One can recognize the girls in their modern look: April (Lizzy in Dutch comics) has one ponytail in her hair and wears purple, May (Juultje in Dutch comics) wears a headband, and dresses in pink, and June (Babetje in Dutch comics) has the two pigtails, and wears yellow.

In ''DuckTales'', the three wear identical clothes in the form of a long-sleeved shirt, a darker vest, a large bow on their heads, and a skirt. They can be differentiated with their hairstyles and the color of their clothes; April/Webby has a pixie cut and wears pink with a blue vest, May has a single ponytail and wears yellow, and June has two short pigtails and wears blue. In addition, April/Webby's bow is on the side of her hair, while May and June's rest on the backs of their heads.

==History==
The first appearance of the trio was in the 1952 comic story ''[[Flip Decision]]'' by Carl Barks, in which they can be seen when Daisy is visiting her sister, the nieces' mother, who remained unseen. In the final panel, they appear with [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] as their escorts.

After Barks introduced the girls in ''Flip Decision'', they continued to make rare appearances in Barks's stories, but there were some they did play important roles. Their first appearance after their introduction was in Barks' ''The Double Date'', six years after their debut. The story ''The Beauty Business'', in which the nieces help Donald with his failing beauty salon, marked their final appearance in Barks' comics.

[[File:April May June from dutch comic translated in Finnish.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Redesigned April, May, and June from a Dutch comic translated in Finnish.]]
In [[1998]], the editors of the Dutch 'Donald Duck' weekly magazine decided the three girls should be modernized, and they got permission from the Disney Company to do so. Dutch Duck comic artist Mau Heymans designed a new hairdo and new wardrobe for April, May, and June.

The new hairdo first appeared in the Dutch comic "Nieuwe Coupe". They now don't look the same at all in Dutch stories and don't have the 'girly' occupations anymore they had when Barks created them. In some Danish stories, the new hairdo has been copied. The Dutch comics with the redesigned girls have also been published in other countries. However, they still appear in their old design in several other countries that haven't adopted this redesign yet.

While April, May, and June still appear regularly in comics, their roles are usually quite minor. The exception is the Dutch version of Donald Duck comics, in which they appear quite often. They mostly appear in the Dutch series "Duckies", which focuses on April, May, and June, Huey, Dewey, and Louie and several classmates and teachers, who were designed by Daniel Branca at the request of the Dutch editors.

More recently, April, May, and June make a brief cameo appearance in the four-part crossover conclusion of the [[2011]] ''Darkwing Duck'' and ''DuckTales'' comics ''[[Dangerous Currency]]''. They help the fellow residents of Duckburg beat back the villains and their slime.

==Appearances==
===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:LN(8).png|thumb|200px|The nieces in ''House of Mouse''.]]
The girls' first appearance in animation was a cameo in the ''House of Mouse'' episode "[[Ladies' Night]]", where they take over for Huey, Dewey, and Louie as the club's band.

===''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''===
[[File:Daisy's nieces.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The nieces' first major role in ''Legend of the Three Caballeros''.]]
The triplets appear as recurring protagonists in the series, which marked their first-ever speaking appearance in animation. They loyally support Donald Duck even after their aunt breaks up with him, though they tend to be rather critical and morose. Although they tend to get along very well, May is visibly more condescending and pessimistic compared to her sisters, often expressing doubt in her sisters' plans. They are all sarcastic and have a talent for deception, being able to goad [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] into buying a ring and pretending to be a waiter in a restaurant. They provide support and helpful information to [[Xandra]] and the Caballeros during their quests, via a magic mirror that they found among [[Clinton Coot]]'s antiques. They also attempt to help Xandra with her integration into the modern world, often with mixed results.

In this show, April wears yellow, May wears orange, and June wears purple. This is most likely to contrast with the colors red, blue, and green associated with [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] or the Three Caballeros themselves. Their voices are also slightly differentiated from each other.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
[[File:Webby is Scrooge’s Daughter!.png|thumb|200px|June (left), May (middle), and April/Webby (right) in the series finale of the ''DuckTales'' reboot.]]
In the original ''[[DuckTales]]'', the character [[Webby Vanderquack]] essentially served as a condensed version of April, May, and June. 

Webby was carried over in the reboot, however this time around, April and Webby are retconned to be one and the same, while May and June were made as separate characters. This fact was not revealed until May and June make their official debut in the series finale, ''[[The Last Adventure!]]''. Unlike the other series ''[[House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'', they don't serve as [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]]'s biological nieces.

It is explained that Webby, originally code-named April, was created by [[F.O.W.L.]] using [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s DNA, essentially making her his daughter. Her purpose was to locate an artifact called the [[Papyrus of Binding]], a mystic paper that can make anything written on it come true, which Scrooge had previously written in stating that no one can locate it unless they were his direct descendant. However, she was then rescued as an infant by Beakley when she was still an agent for [[S.H.U.S.H.]] and taken to live with Scrooge as her adopted granddaughter. Later on, May and June were cloned from Webby's DNA in an effort to find the Papyrus, but couldn't. As a result, both were considered "failures" by F.O.W.L., but were given the opportunity to fulfill a purpose by capturing Webby and having her find the Papyrus. This ends up working, thus making May and June completely unnecessary to F.O.W.L.'s future goals. When F.O.W.L. agent [[Black Heron]] is thrown into a recreated version of the [[Ramrod]] that makes anything cease to exist by Bradford Buzzard in front of them, May and June are devastated as they considered her their "mother". Webby learns of her true past and works together with her sisters to take down F.O.W.L. At the end of the series, Scrooge begins to view Webby as a true daughter, while it is implied that [[Donald Duck]] adopts May and June.

==Trivia==
*When [[Don Rosa]] was asked if the mother of April, May, and June could possibly be [[Donna Duck]], who appeared in a few stories before Daisy appeared, he replied that he found it a good idea. Despite this, it is proven to be impossible, as Daisy and Donna were said to have never seen each other before their meeting in [[Al Taliaferro]]'s [[1951]] newspaper strips.
*"[[Ladies' Night]]" shows April (wearing red) as left-handed.
*In Italian comics, they are called Ely, Emy, and Evy. Although the Italian illustrators have not adapted to the new designs of Daisy's nieces, [[Italy]] is one of the very few countries that use the trio frequently.
*The female triples were mistaken as their boyfriends' cousins because they're thought to be the daughters of Donald's brother-in-law who was rumored to be Daisy's brother.
*All three were the reason the character [[Webby Vanderquack]] was created.
