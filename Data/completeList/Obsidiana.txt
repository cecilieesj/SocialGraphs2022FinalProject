'''Obsidiana''' is a character from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]'s ''[[Gargoyles]]''. She is aÂ [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] member of the [[Mayan Clan]]. 

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Obsidiana, like many Mayan gargoyles, has a large crest on her forehead. Her skin coloration is blue and her hair is black. She also has pterodactyl-type wings similar to [[Brooklyn]]'s. Her ear structure is unique among gargoyles seen so far in the series.

==History==
===Past===
[[File:Obsidiana.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Obsidiana and the other three pendant-bearers were away from the pyramid in [[1993]] when someone attacked the clan, smashing the sleeping gargoyles and looting the pyramid. When she and the others returned, they vowed never to leave the pyramid unguarded again.

===Present===
In [[1996]], Cyberbiotics began to encroach on the Mayan Clan's territory, bringing Obsidiana into direct conflict with them. [[Preston Vogel]] hired [[Jackal]] and [[Hyena (Gargoyles)|Hyena]] to remove the gargoyles by any means necessary. When the [[Avalon]] Travelers arrived, Zafiro enlisted their help in defending their territory.

===Future===
In [[2006]], Obsidiana will come to the United States of America, and recovered the [[Mayan Sun Amulet]] from the Manhattan Clan. Obsidiana and [[Zafiro]] will be the biological ancestors of Zafiro II.

== Trivia ==

* Her name is derived from the obsidian pendant she wears.
