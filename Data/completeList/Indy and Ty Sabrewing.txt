==Trivia==
*Indy and Ty are the only gay fathers in the ''DuckTales'' franchise.
**They are also two of the few LGBT characters in this reboot, alongside [[Penumbra]].
**Violet having two dads was originally reported by a visitor to SDCC 2019 on her Twitter account where she recounted a conversation with co-executive producer Frank Angones at the ''Ducktales'' signing. According to her, he confirmed that the show would have LGBT characters and that he was only allowed to say at the time that Violet had two dads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DuckLesbian/status/1152331919633219584|title=Twitter user DuckLesbian on Frank Angones SDCC 2019|website=Twitter|date=July 19, 2019}}</ref> Later, Frank posted an answer to a fan question about Violet's dads on his blog, again confirming that they would make an appearance along with an explanation of the show's attempts at LGBT representation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://suspendersofdisbelief.tumblr.com/post/189053251331/i-know-its-been-said-violet-has-two-dads-will-we|title=Frank's answer on Violet's dads|website=Suspenders of Disbelief|date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>
*Like their daughter, Indigo and Tyrian are both named after shades of purple.
