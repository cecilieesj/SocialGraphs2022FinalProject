She loves them and her mate, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], very much and deeply cares for all of them. She first appears in ''[[Air Bud: World Pup]]'' with her owner, Emma, which is also the same movie in which she gave birth to the puppies, though none of them were given actual names until the first ''[[Air Buddies]]'' movie. Like Buddy, she only appeared in the first two series of ''Air Buddies'', and her owner was Henry in them.
