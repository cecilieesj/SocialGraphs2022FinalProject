He has appeared in only one [[Sonny with a Chance]] episode so far, "The Legend of Candy Face", in which he was Zora's partner in the trust exercise, and his electric manscaping device was broken by Candy Face. It is believed that he is the weird one in ''MacKenzie Falls'' and the male ''MacKenzie Falls ''equivalent of Zora. He was paired with Zora during their trust exercises, meaning he doesn't like her.</p>
