'''Principal Herbert Hickey''' is a recurring character from the animated TV Series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the principal of [[Hazelnut Middle School]] and is a tough disciplinarian with zero tolerance for Pepper Ann's shenanigans.Â Principal Hickey is [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]]'s one true nemesis.

==Background==
Principal Herbert Hickey is the head of faculty at Hazelnut Middle School. While it is not known how he acquired the position, what is known is that he has lived in Hazelnut all his life and was even part of [[Lydia Pearson]]'s graduating class. Being a principal brings him joy, but there is one thing that stands in his way of having the perfect middle school: [[Pepper Ann Pearson]]. Hickey constantly gets a headache from Pepper Ann's various misadventures and schemes and whenever things go awry, she is usually his number one prime suspect; going so far as to outright accuse her without any real evidence.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Hickey is still the principal at the school, but has become severely senile and accuses everyone of somehow working against him, though he makes no effort to combat anyone over it.

===Personality===
Principal Hickey is a very stern and disciplined man who prefers that everyone respect him and his authority. He is not cruel however, but he does have a tendency to issue irrational commands. He gets stressed out often, mostly due to Pepper Ann, and will go to great lengths to try and get what he wants. Hickey is not devoid of any leisure as he is shown to have a jovial side as well, though in the case of [[Nicky Little]], she did not take kindly to it. He is an overall decent man with some very noticeable flaws. 

===Physical appearance===
Principal Hickey is a man of average height with tan skin. He has a tall head with grey frizzy hair and large ears. He has a noticeable mole on his cheek which in close-up has a hair growing from it (which he has a tendency to pick at). He wears a brown suit with oxford shoes, white undershirt and a green tie.

==Trivia==
*This was [[Don Adams]]' final role before passing away in [[2005]].
*Hickey shares many similarities to [[w:c:simpsons:Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] from ''[[w:c:simpsons:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]'' in that both have an authoritarian grasp on the school, yet are completely out of touch with their students and are almost obsessive with trying to have a perfectly running curriculum, despite not even getting that right.
