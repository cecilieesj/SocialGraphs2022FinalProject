==Appearances==
===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''===
They are race of giant purple reptilian birds with fangs that live in the [[Underworld]]. They attack anyone who comes near [[Hades]]' palace and they have numerous bones decorating their nests. Another race of artificial Furies are created by [[Electra (Hercules)|Electra]]'s anger, the differences between the two is that Ealectra's Furies seem less reptilian, wear spiked collars, have mechanical wings and disappear into dust after one hit.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
A furie appears in ''Once Upon a Time'', invocated by the [[Dark One]] [[Emma Swan]] to deliver [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]'s soul to the Underworld. In reality, the creature was only intoxicated in order to test [[The Evil Queen|Regina]]. This version of the creature was a gray humanoid, similar to a ghost with vegetative skin.
