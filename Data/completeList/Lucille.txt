She's upset after finding the vault where the pralines were kept empty and they're now gone, and she tells [[Wayne Liggett|Wayne]] about it. The Tennessee Safety Patrol are brought in to search inside the vault. As she had been keeping a watchful eye on it, she says that she didn't see anybody who could've taken them from there.
