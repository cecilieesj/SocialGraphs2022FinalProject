===Development<!--Include if applicable.--><!--Include if applicable.--><!--Include if applicable.-->===
When Carl Barks was assigned to adapt the Trick or Treat short for ''Donald Duck #26'', he had to extend the short's storyline to fill out a full 32 pages. This primarily involved the addition of new scenes of Witch Hazel's attempts at getting candy from Donald Duck, with Smorgie's role in the story taking up seven of those pages. However, the editors at Dell Comics chose to cut most of Barks' additions to the story out and the Smorgie scenes wouldn't see an official publication until 1986 when the story was completely restored for reprinting in Another Rainbow's Carl Barks Library.

In "Trick or Treat", Smorgie is summoned by Witch Hazel by adding owl feathers and a derby hat (for fashion) to the witch's brew. He uses his intimidating size to try and scare Donald into giving him the candy and his six stretchy arms are capable of surrounding the house and entering through all the windows and the chimney to keep Donald from trying to escape with his candy. Donald eventually relents, but he tricks the ogre into taking one last treat with him: A lit stick of dynamite. The explosion reduces Smorgie down to his hat.

Smorgie has since made cameos in various European comic stories.<noinclude>
