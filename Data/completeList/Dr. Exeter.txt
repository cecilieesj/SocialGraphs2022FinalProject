'''Doctor Tobias J. Exeter''' is a hedgehog professor who serves as the main antagonist of the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' episode "[[Pig-Malion]]".

==Background==
===Personality===
Being a professor, tutor, and presumably a graduate at Hedgehog University, Dr. Exeter is proven to be very intelligent. When Timon's invention, the Lazy Meerkat Bug Scooper 9000, ends in failure, Dr. Exeter figures out what went wrong and reinvents it so that it could spot and catch grubs. At first, Dr. Exeter is nice to Pumbaa due to his obedience. However, he is mean and rude to Timon for procrastinating on his assignments. After Pumbaa succeeds and Timon gets expelled, Exeter reveals his cruel and evil side, as he imprisons Pumbaa in his laboratory.

===Physical appearance===
Exeter is a slender, brown hedgehog with a dark gray mouth. He wears a white shirt which is under his blue suit, gray pants, and black shoes. Additionally, Exeter also wears a gown and thick black glasses.

==Role in the series==
===Backstory===
{{Quote|You know, Pumbaa, my colleagues laughed at my varies. They gave me wedgies in study hall.|Exceter to Pumbaa}}
Exeter was a professor at Hedgehog University. He was often bullied by his colleagues when he was in study hall.

==="[[Pig-Malion]]"===
After Pumbaa fails to catch a bee, Timon builds a bug-catching machine, which goes out of control and explodes, showing that Timon's idea didn't work. Exeter then shows up and explains why Timon's idea didn't work. He builds another bug-catching machine with a satellite dish. When his machine worked, he explains the two about his job as a professor, which makes Pumbaa interested in joining him. Timon is not interested at first until Exeter states that he is afraid to learn. In answer to Exeter's mockery, Timon makes him to give him some assignments to do, which he does so.

The next day, Exeter becomes Timon and Pumbaa's professor. He asks Timon if he's done his homework, which was to write a report. The meerkat tries to make the hedgehog believe that he wrote a report about boots. Exeter is not convinced and forces him to sit down. Pumbaa then reads his report, which is about the New England region of North America. Exeter is impressed by Pumbaa's paper and he gives him three gold stars, while he gives Timon a dunce cap for not doing his work.

The next day, Exeter teaches ballet to the duo. He is impressed by Pumbaa's dance skill while he's not with Timon's, thus giving him another dunce cap. The next day is Timon and Pumbaa's final exam, which is chemistry. Pumbaa passes the exam while Timon fails, leading to Exeter expelling him. While a miserable Timon leaves Pumbaa, Exeter traps the warthog in a cage and sends him to the Dissection labs of Hedgehog University to use his "large brain" for his experiment.

Pumbaa and Exeter are at Exeter's laboratory. The hedgehog tells Pumbaa that he's going to make his brain grow and use it in revenge of his former colleagues for bullying him. Timon shows up, zaps Exeter, and frees Pumbaa. The two try to escape the university, but end up in a control room. Exeter shows up and warns Timon about an atomic generator. Timon pushes the button that makes the whole university explode.
