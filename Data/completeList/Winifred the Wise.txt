==Background==
===Personality===
Cedric's mother is vain and ambitious while doting on her son, encouraging Cedric to pursue his dreams. Cedric seems to get along better with his mother while having a more hostile relationship with his father [[Goodwyn the Great]]. This is likely due to the fact that his mother coddles him, while his father tries to push him in the right direction. His relationship with his father may also be the result of how often Cedric is compared to him and frequently said to not be as good as he was. Both of Cedric's parents seem to exasperate him at times.

==Role in the [[Sofia the First|series]]==
In the episode, "[[Mystic Meadows]]", she was delighted to see her son visit, indicating he had not come by before. During the visit, she tries to see the good side of Cedric's casting while trying to get her husband to stop "helping" Cedric. She comments that Sofia is a good friend to him and, according to her, his only friend making her smile. She is very proud of her son when he wins the conjuring contest and shows her husband that he is a good sorcerer.

She makes her third season appearance in "[[Cedric Be Good]]", where she tries to help her son gain power from the amulet and keep it.  Her advice is helpful, but counter-productive at the same time because of her negative ambitions for her son. In the end, she agrees with her son that giving up the Amulet to Sofia is the right thing to do in order to remove the final curse the amulet had put on him.

==Trivia==
*Like the rest of her family, Winifred's title begins with a letter (W) sharing the same pronunciation as the letter of her first name.
