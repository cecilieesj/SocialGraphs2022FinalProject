|quote = }}'''Gorgon''' is a member of the Inhuman Royal Family. As a result of being exposed to the Terrigen Mist when he was an infant, Gorgon developed hooved feet and a powerful lower body. His legs are so powerful that with a single stomp, he can create shock tremors to disable his opponents.
Gorgon was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Powers and Abilities==
Gorgon is superhumanly strong and with his low center of gravity makes it impossible to move him off his feet. His current strength since undergoing secondary terregenesis has yet to be revealed although he seems to be more brutish in this form than his previous one. The tissues of Gorgon's body are somewhat harder and more resistant to injury than those of a human being.

==Appearances==
===''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''===
{{CharacterStub}}

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
He is among the Inhumans that fell under the mind-control of Maximus the Mad.

===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''===
He is among the Inhumans that were affected by a plague that caused crystals to grow on their bodies. Gorgon appears at the end of the episode where Medusa thanks the Guardians of the Galaxy on Black Bolt's behalf. In the episode "Inhuman Touch," Gorgon and Karnak help land the Milano on Attilan followed by the two of them helping to repair it. Later on, they help the Guardians of the Galaxy when Maximus tricks his way out of his imprisonment.

===''[[Avengers Assemble|Avengers Assemble: Ultron's Revolution]]''===
He appears with Black Bolt, Medusa, Karnak, and Lockjaw when an Inhuman ship carrying Seeker and the Alpha Primitives crashes into the mountains near Maple Falls. During the Avengers' fight with the Inhumans, Captain America engaged Gorgon in a fight as he tries to reason with him even when their fight goes through the Maple Falls Sheriff Department. When Inferno hatches from his Terrigen cocoon, the Avengers and the Inhumans had to work together to stop Inferno. In the episode "The Inhuman Condition," Gorgon is among the Inhumans that are captured by Ultron. He is later freed by the Avengers.
