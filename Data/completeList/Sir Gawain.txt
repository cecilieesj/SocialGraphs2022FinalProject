'''Sir Gawain''' is a character who appears in the series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. He is [[Cavin]]'s grandfather, a retired knight of [[Dunwyn Castle]], and a strong believer in [[Gummi Bears]].

Nothing is known about whether he is Cavin's paternal or maternal grandfather, as neither of the boy's parents are ever shown on-screen, or even mentioned throughout the series.

He is the one who gave Cavin his own good-luck-charm, the [[Gummi Bear Medallion]] that he found as a youth while exploring the Northern Mountains, near [[Ursalia]]. The medallion later lands in the possession of [[Zummi Gummi]], a fact that Cavin initially covers up by falsely admitting to losing the artifact in order to honor his promise to the Gummies to keep their secret.

Sir Gawain later meets the Gummi Bears himself, and becomes aware of the whereabouts of his old medallion, though he remains unaware of his grandson's direct acquaintance with the fabled bears.

==Appearances==
He only has two appearances in the series; once in the second season, and once in the fourth season:
*"[[Over the River and Through the Trolls]]"
*"[[He Who Laughs Last]]"
