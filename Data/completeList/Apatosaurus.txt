==Trivia==
*Apatosaurus shares a lot of similarities with [[Diplodocus]]: they both are sauropods, both eat plants, both are diplodocoids, and both lived in the Jurassic Period of North America.
*Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were once thought to be one and the same. However, examinations of the two in 2015 show that Brontosaurus is, in fact, a separate animal from Apatosaurus, but at the same time is its closest relative in a family of diplodocids called the Apatosaurinae.
*Apatosaurus was able to walk on two legs as a baby (based on footprints) and walked on all fours as it grew into an adult.
*Apatosaurus and other diplodocids were able to move their tails fast enough to break the sound barrier; this is believed to have been a useful defense against predators.
