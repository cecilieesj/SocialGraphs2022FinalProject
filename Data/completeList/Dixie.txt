==Background==
===Personality===
Dixie is a kind, beautiful, and dramatic Saluki. She hates it when she is disrespected and becomes overly dramatic as a result. When Copper replaces her in the band, she becomes extremely jealous and devious. She is friendly with Tod and her entourage, [[Zelda (The Fox and the Hound)|Zelda.]] 

At the beginning of the film she is friendly with her band mates, but gets into an argument with [[Cash]] after he fires her. However, she becomes nice to Cash once again, where they have a relationship and sings the final note of ''We're in Harmony''.

==Role in the film==
Dixie serves as the main antagonist in the sequel and is a vital member of [[Cash]]'s group, the "Singin' Strays". Toward the very beginning of the film, she gets into an argument with Cash after he fires her. She causes chaos after feeling she had been replaced by [[Copper]], whom she tricks into eating peanut butter before he got to sing. After Cash learns this, he tells her that she was through. After speaking to Zelda and later Tod, partly sharing how hurt she is with her fight with Cash, she finds information from [[Tod]] that proves useful to her cause. She then showed a naughty grin.

After convincing Tod to help her, all destruction breaks loose at the fair, causing Copper to be fired from the gang. This causes turmoil in the gang, and they all end up quitting and going their separate ways. Feeling sorry for Copper, she tells him that Tod never meant any real harm and that he just wanted to remain his best friend.

In the end, Dixie and the rest of the gang are reunited and sing at the diner where the talent scout is, allowing them to get their big break performing at the Grand Ole Opry. The characters later listen to them on the radio.
