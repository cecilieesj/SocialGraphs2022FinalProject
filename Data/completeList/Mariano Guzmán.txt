At the preparty of [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]'s gift ceremony, Mariano is seen in La Casa Madrigal, along with Señora. His mother helped him push some of his hair that fell out while he was lovingly eyeing Isabela, who was dancing with some of the townspeople. Mariano is later briefly seen dancing and talking to Isabela at the afterparty.

During the dinner, Mariano shows concern for Mirabel, who was trying to hide [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]]'s vision. However, Mirabel just rushes the proposal, trying not to do anything that seems suspicious. At the moment Mariano tries to propose to Isabela; however everything goes wrong.
