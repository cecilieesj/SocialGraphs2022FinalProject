In "[[Fixing Frobo]]", Polly worked to bring Frobo back online only for him randomly start shooting lasers, damaging the Boonchuys' garage before Anne powered him down. Ignoring Hop Pop's order to cease and desist any further attempts to fix Frobo, Polly started researching on the Internet, eventually consulting the [[Ally and Jess|I.T. Gals]]. Disregarding their advice to power up Frobo in a big space, Polly successfully reactivated Frobo, albeit with his personality reset to factory settings. Failing to recognize Polly, Frobo declared he would attempt to make contact with headquarters and flew into the sky, taking Polly with him. However, his boosters malfunctions mid-flight, causing them both to fall. As Polly tearfully apologized to Frobo, one of her tears fell into his hard drive, causing him to regain his memories. To protect Polly before they hit the ground, Frobo placed her inside the laundry machine she used for his new torso. Only Frobo's head survived the fall intact and Polly and the I.T.

When [[Mr. X (character)|Mr. X]] captured him and the Plantrs, he asked Polly if Frobo was a bomb, only to split oil in his face. After Anne, her parents, and their friends save him and the Plantars, the IT Gals were impressed that Polly got Frobo fix sort of. Frobo later joined the Plantars as they made it through the portal. However, when Anne, the Plantars, and Frobo return, they discovered that King Andrias and his robotic forces have turn most of Amphibia into a barren wasteland.

In "[[Commander Anne]]" after seeing Amphibia become a barren wasteland, Frobo, Anne, and the Plantars head to Wartwood Swamp only to find it in ruins.
