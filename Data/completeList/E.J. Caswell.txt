==Background==
E.J. is a ambitious entrepre-nerd who brings homemade props to auditions. Don’t cross E.J. if you get something he wants — like a starring role, opposite “his” girl Nini. The son of two high-powered corporate lawyers, E.J. is supremely confident but secretly prone to anxiety attacks when anything goes off-plan. A future producer more than an actor, E.J. calls the Steve Jobs biography his “bible” and keeps a copy on his nightstand. Voted “Most likely to report another student for cheating on a test.”<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/high-school-musical-series-development-190058962.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEpXP_lbnaNwG8QwSOThFxg8k0OE-bmzeDvMcxlx_fBuFs7lBfBWMlOep5W75PWLR6Rbn627s3kSCkfhoQdScKl-hwHb3ZxFc1x1ivSTvn0kPwBe9ev0oNfl8VSJZ7fobphr9mASsYW0-opQhxwbFtFEzyLw9Kfczn8Ea5CivSzA]</ref>

===Personality===
E.J. is a very ambitious, talented, smart, popular, athletic, and confident. E.J. never does anything to half-effort. At the beginning of the series E.J. was self-absorbed and expectant. He cares a lot about what other people think of him. After he is exposed for taking Nini’s phone, he starts to lose Instagram followers. E.J. also loves being seen as popular and does so many extracurriculars to maintain his popularity and increase his chances of being accepted to his dream college. He often does "the wrong things for the right reason" as Ashlyn, his cousin, says to Nini after she breaks up with him. What she means by this is that E.J. loves Nini, but he doesn't cope with that very well. He surely wants the best for her nonetheless, though. Towards the end of the first season, E.J. seems more kind and honest. In the Season 1 finale E.J. buys Gina a plane ticket so that she didn't have to miss the show. That is when people finally start seeing him as a good guy when he was all along. E.J. learns to not care as much about being the best and instead tries to develop deeper relationships with the fellow theatre kids. He just wants what's best for everyone and he really tries. Over time he becomes very caring. According to Jamie Porter his mother said that he is very charming.

E.J. also cares deeply about making his parents proud of him, which is another reason he tries so hard at everything he does. E.J. desperately wants to go to Duke because his parents met there and he feels like he needs to be a part of that legacy to not disappoint his parents. That’s why it is such a crushing blow to him when he is rejected by Duke. However, E.J. has learnt not to be too attached to outcomes and to take each day as it comes. At the same time, E.J. wants to succeed on his own merit and doesn’t feel right about attending Duke after his father has to call in favors.
