She is usually seen with medium length black hair (occasionally with short hair) in a ponytail, cream (occasionally dark) colored feathers, black eyes and a yellow beak.

==Background==
Maria (also called Rosita in Italian and Rosinha in Brazil) was originally going to be featured in a series of films in the 1940's under the name of Aurora. The idea never made it past the storyboard process.  Maria Vaz first appeared in  José Carioca comic strip in 1942, scripted by Hubie Karp, illustrated by Bob Grant and Paul Murry and inks by Dick Moore and Karl Karpé.

However, she does show up in a large number of comics done in both Holland and Brazil. It seems Rosinha is one of her more well known names. She seems to be featured often in the [[Zé Carioca (comics)]] as the daughter of [[Rocha Vaz]] who tries to interfere with her's and José's relationship as he does not approve of it. There are times when she has tried to get José to marry her, but he does his best to avoid being tied down.

In ''Histórias Curtas'' #20 (March 2021), published by Culturama, Maria becomes a correspondent for the Uncle Scrooge news channel in Rio de Janeiro
