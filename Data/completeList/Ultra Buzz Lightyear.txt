'''Ultra Buzz Lightyear''' (also called '''Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear''' or '''New Buzz''') is a minor antagonist-turned-supporting character in the [[1999]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. Being a toy, he is essentially like every other [[Buzz Lightyear]] manufactured, as he believes he is a real space ranger, but sporting a new accessory belt. Basically a duplicate of Buzz, he is also voiced by [[Tim Allen]].

==Role in the film==
[[File:Toy-story2-disneyscreencaps.com-5093.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Utility Belt Buzz apprehends Buzz.]]

Ultra Buzz Lightyear first appears in ''Toy Story 2'' in two forms.

The first form appears during the opening sequence, where he is seeing flying in space to the planet that is the location of Zurg's fortress. He fights and fires his way through Zurg-Bots, escapes booby traps set by Zurg in his control room, and almost fell to his doom when crossing a gravitational-like bridge, right before he uses his Anti-Gravity Servo on his utility belt to get to Zurg's source of power. But when he reaches for it, the battery turned out to be a hologram, right before Zurg dramatically appears. Buzz then does a battle with Zurg, who eventually uses his ion blaster to blast the top half of Buzz's body into smithereens; however, the opening sequence is revealed to be only [[Buzz Lightyear: Attack on Zurg|a video game]] that Rex has been playing.

Though not a physical appearance, an image of Ultra Buzz (without the belt) is seen on a game manual Rex reads when the toys arrive in [[Al's Toy Barn]].

Later on, when [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s [[Buzz Lightyear]] discovers an aisle full of new Buzz Lightyear action figures in [[Al's Toy Barn]], he sees "NEW UTILITY BELT!" on a display stand and climbs up to encounter this Buzz Lightyear action figure. When he foolishly attempts to take this Buzz's belt, Ultra Buzz suddenly springs to life, mistaking him for a rogue space ranger and overpowering him in a fight. Ultra Buzz, not knowing he is a toy, subdues Andy's Buzz and takes the latter as his prisoner. Ultra Buzz then utilizes an empty Buzz Lightyear cardboard box as a prison cell. He ties and stuffs Andy's Buzz into the cardboard box as Andy's Buzz tries to convince Ultra Buzz that he is a toy, but he takes no attention. Irritated by Andy's Buzz's "misbehavior," Ultra Buzz isolates Andy's Buzz by placing him on the shelf with the newer Buzz Lightyear toys. Although he has put up Andy's Buzz on display, Ultra Buzz has not placed him on the shelf properly, making escape possible. He, like the original Buzz in the [[Toy Story|previous film]], believes that he is a real space ranger, although he is apparently even more deluded than Andy's Buzz (e.g. when Andy's Buzz has mumbled whether he has been this deluded in an embarrassment of his former behavior).

When [[Barbie|Tour Guide Barbie]] drives the toys into the Buzz Lightyear aisle, [[Hamm]] calls to Ultra Buzz, thinking he is Andy's Buzz. Ultra Buzz turns on his laser as Tour Guide Barbie stops the car. He is at first suspicious of Andy's toys, but when Rex excitedly claims that he knows how to defeat the Evil Emperor Zurg (having read the video game manual), Ultra Buzz considers Rex as his ally and joins the toys on their quest, thinking that they are on a mission to infiltrate Zurg's fortress and defeat the evil Emperor himself. The toys leave the aisle leaving the real Buzz tied up in a box on the shelf, struggling to get out. At the office of the owner of Al's Toy Barn ([[Al McWhiggin]], the same man who has stolen [[Woody]]), Ultra Buzz believes him as a possible agent of Zurg. He tells the toys to get into Al's bag, thinking it might lead him to Zurg. After the toys arrive outside the building that houses Al's Penthouse, Ultra Buzz finds the air vent and navigates the toys through the vent and up the elevator shaft with his grappling hook on his new utility belt, despite Mr. Potato Head growing more suspicious of his cocky attitude ("I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure!"). During the climb, Rex accidentally pushes the toys to the bottom of the line due to his small arms' inability to grip the grapple rope for much longer and causes Ultra Buzz's strength to give out, prompting him to activate his anti-gravity servos (unaware that he is just a toy). Despite protests from the toys, Ultra Buzz lets go of the wall, and the toys land on a rising elevator that takes them up to level 23. He stupidly thinks that his anti-gravity servos are really working, however.

[[File:toy-story2-disneyscreencaps.com-7484.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ultra Buzz and Buzz arguing over who the real Buzz is.]]
Ultra Buzz acts literally when he tells Rex to "use your head," as the toys then use him as a battering ram to break into Al's penthouse. In the ensuing melee that follows, Ultra Buzz and the toys grab Woody and head back for the vent, but Andy's Buzz stops them. In a brief argument between the two Buzz Lightyear toys after Woody asks which one is the real Buzz, Andy's Buzz opens Ultra Buzz's helmet (causing the other Buzz to suffocate under "toxic" air) and proves that he is the Buzz the other toys recognize by flashing Andy's name written on the bottom of his foot; though before this, the toys were willing to accept him when they didn't buy Ultra Buzz's behavior. Ultra Buzz is confused at what he is witnessing after regaining his composure, but is stunned to learn from Andy's Buzz about "Code 546," then walks over to Woody and kneels in front of him, addressing Woody as "Your Majesty."

When the toys head back to the elevator after Al packs Woody and the [[Woody's Roundup|Roundup gang]] into his case and leaves the room, they encounter a Zurg action figure (unknowingly let loose by Andy's Buzz when leaving Al's Toy Barn), whom Ultra Buzz battles. During this fight, Zurg claims that he is Buzz's father. After Rex accidentally knocks Zurg down the elevator shaft with his tail, Ultra Buzz forlornly thinks he has lost his father. After the toys leave the apartment, Andy's Buzz runs into Ultra Buzz one last time when the other Buzz is last seen playing ball with Zurg to form a real father-son bond. He describes Zurg as a "great dad," as Andy's Buzz bids him farewell with a Vulcan salute.

==Utility Belt Features==
*Anti-Gravity Servo - when the button in the center of the belt is pressed, it will light up and make noises, mirroring how it was used in Buzz Lightyear: Attack on Zurg (In the game, it lights up and creates a bubble around Buzz).
*Climbing Magnets - on each side of the belt, protruding handles can be pulled out and magnets will fold out of each. These magnets can be used to scale metal surfaces. In addition, a grappling hook is stored in the back compartment of the belt.

==Trivia==
*When Ultra Buzz fights with Zurg, the latter claims he is the former's father, a word-to-word parody of when [[Darth Vader]] reveals that he is [[Luke Skywalker]]'s father in ''[[Star Wars]]: The Empire Strikes Back''.
*He first appeared in ''[[Buzz Lightyear: Attack on Zurg]]'' in the opening sequence of the movie, before we see the toy version of him later on.
*The scene of [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s [[Buzz Lightyear]] climbing up the display wall to encounter Ultra Buzz Lightyear standing tall is a direct resemblance to the scene of [[Woody]] climbing up Andy's bed to encounter the original Buzz standing tall in [[Toy Story|the first film]].
*The part where Ultra Buzz tackles Woody and yells "Watch Yourself!" in [[Al's Apartment]] mirrors the part when the original Buzz tackles Woody and yells "Watch Yourself!" in Andy's room in [[Toy Story|the previous film]].
*The part where Andy's Buzz opens Ultra Buzz's helmet to make him gasp for air mirrors the part when Woody opens [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s Buzz's helmet in [[Toy Story|the previous film]]. And like the first movie, Woody looks down at a suffocated Buzz embarrassed, but this time the other toys looked the same way as he did.
*Ultra Buzz, realizing that his boosters on his jet pack are not working after he and Andy's other toys tried to escape Al's car, is very similar to the original Buzz realizing that his laser is not working after aiming it at the [[Mutant Toys]] from the [[Toy Story|previous film]].
*Like Andy's Buzz from the first film, Ultra Buzz believes himself to be a real space-ranger, albeit worse this time.
*There is also a [http://pixar.wikia.com/Toy_Story_Signature_Collection Toy Story Collection] version of Ultra Buzz.
*In ''[[Toy Story 2: The Video Game]]'', Ultra Buzz is a boss at Al's Space Land riding a moon buggy. Strangely, however, he doesn't wear the utility belt.
*Code 6404.5, as Ultra Buzz mentions, is actually the California "No-Smoking" Code.
*In the novelization of ''Toy Story 2'', Ultra Buzz is not shown playing catch with [[Emperor Zurg|Zurg]], but instead carrying his lifeless body back to [[Al's Toy Barn]] to rest. The scene was reminiscent of part of the ending to ''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'', where Luke has to drag Vader over to his shuttle due to the latter being mortally wounded trying to save him from Palpatine.
*Like in the video game, Ultra Buzz Lightyear jumps over Zurg while out dodging the blasting of Zurg's fake Ion Blaster, but unlike the video game, Buzz shot Zurg first with his fake laser, even though it only hurt Zurg's eyes instead before they continue battling.
