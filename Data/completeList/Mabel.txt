'''Mabel''' is a minor antagonist in the [[2007]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Ratatouille]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Mabel is an avid fan of Gusteau, as she often watches him on the TV. She also loves cooking, given her large collection of herbs and spices. In addition, she has a fear of rats, and has a trigger-happy personality rooted in her youth, when she participated in the [[France|French]] Resistance against the Nazi occupation in World War II (shown in pictures which can be seen in her house). Age and a lack of any recent practice have numbed her aim, as she wrecks her house far more than the rats ever could, shooting at them and accidentally destroying the ceiling of her house in the process. She also possesses a gas mask and rat spray, which she could have used in the first place instead of her shotgun.

==Role in the film==
Mabel is an old woman who lives on the outskirts of [[Paris]] in a quaint village. [[Remy]], along with the [[Rat Colony|rat colony]], lives there in her attic. Mabel loves to cook, proven by her collection of many different foods, and is always seen watching [[Auguste Gusteau|Gusteau]] on the television. She also owns Gusteau's famous cookbook: "[[Anyone Can Cook]]", which is always left in the kitchen, causing Remy to visit her kitchen regularly. Later, when Mabel sees Remy in her kitchen, she grabs her shotgun and shoots at him while accidentally blowing numerous holes in the ceiling, causing it to crash to the floor, with hundreds of rats falling with it. The rats begin to flee from her home, but Mabel still doesn't leave her infestation to that. She puts on a gas mask and starts spraying a gaseous rat poison at the rats. Remy was her main target because he was the last to escape. She soon gives up after the rats escape in their "rescue boats," and after missing her final shot at Remy, who was floating on her stolen cookbook, she isn't seen for the remainder of the film.

==Trivia==
*Mabel's shotgun strongly resembles a Winchester model 1897 pump shotgun. However, in the comics, it is an over under double barreled shotgun.
**Mabel has been shown to load the gun with shotgun shells. However, it has been shown to be relatively accurate from afar when she destroys a large chunk of a perforated turner Remy uses as an improvised oar. It is possible that it can fire both shot and slugs.
**The shotgun also seems to hold up to 11 rounds (either 11 in the magazine, or 1 in the chamber and 10 in the magazine). However, the gun's real life counterpart could only hold up to 7 (1 in the chamber, 6 in the magazine).
