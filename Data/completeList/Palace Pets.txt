'''Palace Pets''' is a spin-off franchise to the [[Disney Princess]] franchise. The franchise is comprised of a group of royal pets who live with the Disney Princesses. The Palace Pets also have their own world called [[Whisker Haven]], where they go on adventures and befriend other Palace Pets from all of the Princess Kingdoms.

==Description==
Each Palace Pet has been found and adopted by their respective princess. They originated from different types of situations, and always end up being with the princesses. Each of them has a resemblance to her or his respective owner, whether it is in appearance or accessories. The franchise is a departure from the princesses' original animal allies in their respective movies. Each of them are being cared by the Disney Princesses.

The kingdom of [[Whisker Haven]] lies in a secret realm, and can only be accessed by the Palace Pets through magic portals. The Princesses cannot enter Whisker Haven; instead, the Palace Pets are the ones managing the kingdom with the help of Miss Featherbon, the hummingbird fairy of Whisker Haven.

==Web series==
A web series based on the franchise, ''[[Whisker Haven]]'', follows the adventures of the Palace Pets. It is available on Disney Junior's website. Season 1 focuses on Ms. Featherbon, Treasure, Petite (formerly known as Petit), Pumpkin, Sultan, Dreamy (formerly known as Beauty), and Berry with appearances made by Lily, Bibbidy, Sweetie, and the Critterzens. Ms. Featherbon is a newly introduced character; she is a magical hummingbird fairy and the gatekeeper of Whisker Haven. Season 2 introduces several more pets: Taj, Nuzzles, Nyle, Windflower, Pounce, Slipper, Daisy, Fern, Gleam, and Teacup. The pets have different voices than the ones in the app version, as they are mostly voiced by child or teen actors except for Ms. Featherbon. Cameos are made by other Palace Pets, including Blondie, Muffin, Bloom, Booksy, Plumdrop, Olive, and Snowpaws.

==Trivia==
*The franchise resembles a cross between ''My Little Pony'' and ''Littlest Pet Shop'', as both Hasbro toylines are centered around animals.
*To support the franchise, the producers created an app called ''Disney Palace Pets''. The app is free and currently only available in the [[United States|U.S.]] store. It costs money to wake up the Palace Pets who were added to the app in the recent update.
*The Palace Pets can talk, but only to each other.
*Midnight, Matey, Otto, Sultan, Taj, Nyle, Stripes, Pounce, Cubbie, Chai, and Sundrop are the only Palace Pets who are male.
