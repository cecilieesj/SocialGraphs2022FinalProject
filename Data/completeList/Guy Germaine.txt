'''Guy Germaine''' is secondary character in the Mighty Ducks Trilogy. Guy is from St. Paul, [[Minnesota]]. He is a hockey player and plays Forward Position, and wears number 00. He serves as a model player for the Ducks on the ice, and is second only to [[Adam Banks]] in terms of skill. In [[The Mighty Ducks]], he is part of the "Oreo Line" with the Hall Brothers. Guy Germaine also attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in [[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]. After D3, he married Connie Moreau and had three children. Guy is portrayed by Garette Ratliff Henson.

== Playing Style ==
Guy has been shown to be a very skilled player offensively and is consistently on the ice more often than most others on the team. However, like most of the team, he does lack defensive skill, and his smaller size has made him victim to vicious hits by opponents. The greatest example being in the third film where a hit against the boards and glass took him out of the second period. 

==Quotes==
About to kiss Connie but interrupted by Jesse, Charlie, and Averman.
*"I was this close!"

== Trivia ==

* Guy is the one player on the Mighty Ducks that has taken the most injures, the second being [[Lester Averman]].
* Guy re-appears in [[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]].
* One of Guy's children is named after [[Gordon Bombay]].
