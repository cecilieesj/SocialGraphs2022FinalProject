'''Solomon the Great''' is said to be the wisest Dinosaur of them all. He was voiced by [[Michael Dorn]], his body is puppeteered by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Tate Jack Tate] and his face was operated by [[Bruce Lanoil]].

He appeared in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_211:_Switched_at_Birth Switched at Birth]" as a way to settle the custody of [[Baby Sinclair]] and Aubrey Molehill once and for all.

Initially, he wore a robe, looking as if he was going to perform some ancient ritual, but he removed his robe and appeared in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Magicians magician] attire. His plan on settling custody of the babies was to cut them in two halves and give one half to each group of parents.

[[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl Sinclair]] decided that he really wanted Baby back, but the young dinosaur was cut in half anyway. Shortly thereafter, [[Gus Molehill]] came to his senses and decided that he'd rather have Aubrey than half a kid and gave Earl his half of Baby, whereupon Baby was magically restored.

For his grand finale, Solomon got the scientist from [[Absolute Proof Laboratories]] to reveal that there was a mix-up in the lab and that the babies had the correct parents after all.

Solomon also has an assistant named [[Ramona]].
