'''The Robot Butler''' is one of the attractions at the [[Museum of Modern Marvels]] in the [[Donald Duck]] cartoon

''[[Modern Inventions]]''. He is voiced by [[Billy Bletcher]]


==Functions==
His job is to greet the customers who enter the museum and take off the hat of the guests.

==Problems==
The Robot Butler seems compelled to take someone's hat whether they want him to or not. He'll also follow the visitors of the museum around and confiscate any hats he sees someone wearing. Additionally, The Robot Butler seems to become exceedingly infuriated if someone flaunts a hat he/she is wearing in his presence. When he Donald dons a Civil War kerpi (the only hat that was not taken from him during the episode), the Robot Butler's eye turns red in anger, and he proceeds to chase the defiant duck around the museum.
==Hats taken from Donald==

*Donald's classic white sailor's hat.
*A top hat.
*A [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic]] officer hat.
*A baby bonnet.
*A bowler hat.

==Mannerisms==
The Robot Butler appears to be very polite as he answered [[Donald Duck|Donald's]] question of who he was. He also continually refers to Donald as "sir". However, he becomes greatly annoyed when Donald refuses to give up his hat, shoving Donald down to take it. The Robot then thanks Donald. 

== Trivia ==

* The fact that The Robot Butler only has one eye doesn't seem to hinder his optical capabilities to any degree. This could suggest that his single eye possesses nearly 360Â° vision. 
* The Robot Butler appears to have a red battery attached to his back. This is likely his power source.
* This episode proves that Donald is fully prepared for the possibility of having his trademark sailor hat stolen, as he seems to carry around many spare hats on his person at all times.
** Donald's skill in spontaneously producing objects he needs out of nowhere (in a manner like that of a stage magician) is remniscient of his behavior in [[The Band Concert]], where he repeatedly produces a new flute whenever the previous one gets dropped or broken.
* The Robot Butler's almost fanatical compulsion to take hats from museum patrons seems to be an error in his programming, suggesting his inventor never accounted for his behavior in response to the possibility of one refusing to relinquish his/her hat. Alternatively, it could be that The Robot Butler's programming drives him to follow the rules of the museum to the letter, suggesting that he may enforce all museum policies with such relentless commitment.
** If The Robot Butler does indeed take such excessive measures when enforcing the rules of the museum, it could be the reason why Donald is the only one ever seen visiting (as all the other patrons stopped coming to avoid The Robot Butler's extreme tendencies).
