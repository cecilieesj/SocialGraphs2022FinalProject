}}'''Constantin''' is a supporting character in the television series ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''. He is the Dalmatians' next door neighbor.

== Background ==

===Personality===
Constantin craves peace, quiet and dignity, but he is ritually robbed of all three on a daily basis due to his dotty dog neighbours. Constantin enjoys hosting zen parties and yoga sessions for his fellow feline friends and Deepak, his spotty protégé. He lives a minimalist lifestyle in a sharp contrast to his messy neighbours.

===Physical appearance===
Constantin is a cat with blue-grey colored fur. He has thick white eyebrows and white fur going from his muzzle down to his chest and along his stomach.

In Concept art, Constantin would've been a black and white cat but it was unknown if his fur color was changed during production or it would've been his original fur color.
