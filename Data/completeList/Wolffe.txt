'''Commander Wolffe''' (birth number '''CC-3636''') is a [[Clone Troopers|Clone Trooper]] who appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and the show's successor ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He was a Clone commander who fought during the Clone Wars, serving under the command of [[Jedi]] General [[Plo Koon]] as leader of a clone squad named Wolfpack. He served in numerous engagements throughout the war.

He was still alive and active in the fight between the [[Galactic Empire]] and a group of Rebels. When the rebels, led by the Jedi [[Kanan Jarrus]], appeared, Wolffe was at first shocked, but quickly he and [[Gregor]] drew their blasters, firing on the Jedi. Kanan, however, deflected the blasts back, and [[Rex (Star Wars)|Captain Rex]] ordered Wolffe and Gregor to stand down. Because he was suspicious of the Jedi and his comrades, Wolffe reported in to the Empire, allowing them to zone in on the rebels' location. When Kanan and Rex learned of Wolffe's betrayal, they demanded an explanation. Wolffe told them that he simply wanted to help his brothers, and he then assisted them in destroying an Imperial probe droid.
