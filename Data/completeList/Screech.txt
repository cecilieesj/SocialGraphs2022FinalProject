'''Screech''' (real name '''Strig Tyton''') is a character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2018]] animated film'' [[Incredibles 2]]'', who is part of a group of second-rate [[Supers]] who aspire to join the ranks of superheroes.

==Background==
Screech sports big owl-like eyes and he can rotate his head 360 degrees. He can fly, using a pair of wings he made to complete his look, but his real power is a high-pitched screech that can break glass. Sporting the appearance of an owl, Screech fights crime mostly at night, which leaves him tired and less focused during the day.

Screech developed his flight suit while working in a bird rescue center in Montana.

==Role in the film==
Screech, along with Krushauer, He-Lectrix, Brick, and Reflux, is first seen in a meeting mingling with other superheroes at Winston's office where he introduces himself to Elastigirl after to take part of Winston's growing campaign of making Supers legal again. Later after Elastigirl is captured and brainwashed by Evelyn Deavor, Screech and the other Supers break into the Parr family's new home under Evelyn's control and putting the Hypno-goggles on Frozone with Brick catching him. He and the other Supers are later seen fighting against Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack on Winston's ship in which they confront them to remove their Hypno-goggles with help from Elastigirl, Mr. Incredible, and Frozone; Screech is suddenly saved when Dash tackles him while on deck and hits the Hypno-goggles and saving him from Evelyn's control. Later after Evelyn gets arrested, Screech and the other superheroes are last seen reinstating the Supers Relocation Program where all the superheroes regain their legal statuses.
