'''Dr. Bunsen Honeydew''' is a scientist from ''[[The Muppets]] ''who is most frequently seen with his assistant, [[Beaker|Beaker]].

==Background==
Dr. Bunsen Honeydew is the resident scientist on ''The Muppet Show'' and the host of the Muppet Labs sketches. In season one of ''The Muppet Show'', he worked alone, but in season two, his assistant [[Beaker]] was added to the show.

Bunsen is always eager to show off his latest scientific discovery, but his excitement about progress tends to render him short-sighted. Beaker usually ends up being harmed by Dr. Honeydew's inventions, but Bunsen is either unaware or apathetic to Beaker's suffering. Bunsen Honeydew's name comes from the scientific instrument called the Bunsen burner, and the shape of his head, which looks like a honeydew melon.

Bunsen's inventions have included a gorilla detector, exploding clothes, edible paper clips, a banana sharpener, hair-growing tonic, and a machine that can turn gold into cottage cheese.

He has appeared in every Muppet movie, often with a large role contributing to the film's plot. In ''[[w:c:muppet:The Muppet Movie|The Muppet Movie]]'', [[Kermit the Frog]] meets Bunsen and Beaker in an old ghost town, where Honeydew shows off his latest invention, "Insta-Grow Pills", which can temporarily make things grow bigger. Animal takes the entire jar of pills, allowing the Muppets to defeat Doc Hopper.

In ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'', Bunsen and Beaker portray charity workers. In ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]],'' he plays Doctor Livesey while Beaker plays himself. 

In ''Muppets from Space'', Bunsen invents a number of devices for the Muppets to use when they rescue [[Gonzo]].

In ''Muppets Most Wanted,'' Bunsen creates a "magnetic bomb attractor vest" for Beaker early in the film. When Constantine is revealed to be a Kermit impostor at his wedding to Miss Piggy, he reveals that Piggy's wedding ring is a bomb. Bunsen activates the vest, causing the ring to stick to Beaker before exploding.

==Trivia==
* Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's film appearances in ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' and ''Muppets from Space'' are both owned by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], ''It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie'' is owned by [[Universal Studios|NBCUniversal]], and the other Muppet movies are owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] (along with the rest of the Muppet franchise).
