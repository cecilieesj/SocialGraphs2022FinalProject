'''Sãhasí''' is a male lion introduced in season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. Rani and [[Baliyo]]'s deceased father, he makes his debut and only appearance in the episode "[[The Tree of Life]]". He is a male lion who lives on in spirit following his death, alongside his mate [[Ãnanda]].

== Background ==
=== Personality ===
Sãhasí is a kind and understanding lion, who respects his daughter for taking her duties seriously, but also respects Queen Janna for her wisdom as well. He is shown to care for his daughter and has faith in her destiny to become the Lion Queen of the Tree of Life.

=== Appearance ===
Sãhasí, much like all the other of the Night Pride (sans Kion and his Lion Guard) has dark, chocolate-colored fur. In addition to this, he is muscular in a rounded way, (almost resembling [[Mufasa]]), with rounded, black-rimmed ears, and has red eyes, as well as a dark brown nose, both of which pass down to his daughter. His nuzzle is creamy white and his eye-rims are a brownish grey. 

==Role in the series==
===''[[The Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|The Tree of Life]]''===
After [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] tells the [[Night Pride]] about [[Kion]] using the [[Roar of the Elders]] along with the [[Lion Guard]] and they argue about them, she tells them to give her a moment in which [[Surak]] agrees. Rani then walks up a hill to talk to her deceased parents Sãhasí and Ãnanda in the sky to which she needs advice from them telling them that her grandmother Janna wants her to welcome Kion to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] to which Rani is unsure if she should welcome them or not. Sãhasí tells Rani that [[Janna|Queen Janna]] is preparing her daughter to be lead more than the Night Pride by becoming the new queen of the Tree of Life. After talking, Rani then follows the advice of her deceased parents. Eventually, this proves to be fruitful in the end, as Rani and Kion share a close bond and are united as one to rule the Tree of Life.

==Trivia==
*It is unknown as to how Sãhasí and his mate died. Given that Janna (who is clearly older than both Sãhasí and Ãnanda) is still alive by the time Rani's parents are spirits (up until the episode ''[[Long Live the Queen]]''), it's unlikely that they passed away from natural causes like Janna.
