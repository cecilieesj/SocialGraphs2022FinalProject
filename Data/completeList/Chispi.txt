'''Chispi''' is a minor character who appears in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]’s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''. She is a capybara who is part of [[Antonio Madrigal]]'s various pets in his room.

== Background ==
When Antonio first received his gift to communicate with animals, Chispi became one of his animal companions. The capybara thusly acts as the backend of Antonio's menagerie, and is known for chilling out with the rest of Encanto's wildlife in the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal]] family.

== Appearance ==
Chispi has long brown tawny fur and dark brown paws. She has brown eyes, black foot "socks", and small dark brown ears. She lacks a prominent morrillo, indicating she is female. Her nose is big with big nostrils, and on each side of her nose, she has white whiskers.

== Personality ==
She will not be moved, and is swaggy and chill; as seen when [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] is making his sandy but important vision circle and has to go around her.

== Other appearances ==
=== ''Antonio's Amazing Gift'' ===
In this book, Chispi appears on the book cover and several pages. She is often spotted swimming along the river, hanging out with her other capybara relatives and pups, or when she walks alongside [[Parce]] and the other animals when Antonio leaps on a ride through the magical forest.

== Trivia ==
* There was almost going to be an after-credits [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqBUwFNW4cA scene] with a joke in regards to Chispi herself. It would have focused on Chispi sniffing around the house for a spot to do her "business" on, but it was eventually scrapped as the creators wanted to end ''Encanto'' on an emotional note.
* Although some sources say the name "Chispi" means energetic and enthusiastic, Chispi is far from either. Roughly translated, her name means "sparkles," a common name for pets.<ref>https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/chispa</ref>
