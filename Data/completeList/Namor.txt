'''Namor''' is the main antagonist of ''[[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever]]'', played by Tenoch Huerta. He is the king of Talocan, a [[Mutants|mutant]] and Shuri's arch-nemesis. Namor is drawn to the surface by the ramifications of [[Black Panther|T’Challa]]’s decision to reveal the truth of [[Wakanda]] to the world, which puts Talocan in jeopardy.

Namor was created by Bill Everett.

==Trivia==
*Namor was one of the first Marvel characters ever created.
*In the comics and other media, Namor was the ruler of Atlantis, while in the film his homeland was renamed Talocan (named after the Aztec underwater realm of Tlalocan).
