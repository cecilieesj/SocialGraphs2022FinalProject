Some thought that Lane Merrifield is [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rsnail rsnail's] name, and that Billybob was the founder of ''[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin Club Penguin]''. His catchphrase was "Waddle On!", as seen on almost all of his blog posts. He is a retired mod as of October 2012.
