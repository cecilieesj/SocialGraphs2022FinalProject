'''Philip''' is a talking horse who appears in the [[2005]] Disney adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.

==Background==
A member of Aslan's Army, Philip lived under the tyranny of [[Jadis the White Witch]] at the time the Pevensies came to Narnia. When [[Aslan]] arrived, he became Edmund's personal steed whom he uses for training with his brother [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] at Aslan's Camp.

==Role in the film==
When the Pevensies arrive at Narnia at Aslan's Camp, [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] rode on Philip to which he uses him as transportation training with his brother [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] who also rode on his [[Unicorns|unicorn]]. During training, Edmund shouts "Whoa, horsey!" to which the horse replies to him that his name is Philip. Later, it is likely that Philip participated during the final battle against [[Jadis the White Witch]] though it is unlikely what he did during battle.

With the White Witch defeated and the tyranny was broken with the Pevensies being kings and queens of Narnia, Edmund rides on Philip in a plan to catch the White Stag to which the Pevensies are unable to catch it just as the Pevensies return to their own world at the [[Professor Digory Kirke|Professor]]'s house.
