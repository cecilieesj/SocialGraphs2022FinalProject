'''Bombie the Zombie''' is a character from the ''Donald Duck'' and ''Uncle Scrooge'' comics.

==Backstory==
As revealed by Professor Cornelius McCobb, Bombie is not actually dead. Like all "real" zombies, he was a poor man who was bewitched, in Bombie's case by the vengeful African voodoo doctor Foola Zoola, to become his mindless slave. The enchantment also gave Bombie a greatly-expanded lifetime and superhuman strength and resistance to cold, drowning and starving. Still according to Professor McCobb, Bombie is still conscious the whole time, but is unable to reflect that through actions, and can only act following Foola Zoola's orders.

The vengeful Foola Zoola sent Bombie after a young [[Scrooge McDuck]] to give him a bewitched voodoo doll, which contained a poison that would reduce Scrooge to the size of a mouse (which is Foola Zoola's favourite spell). However, since this incident took place many years ago, when Scrooge was a young man, Bombie, because of his voodoo-induced mindlessness, never realized that Scrooge would have aged within the years that he chased him around the world. As such, after seventy years of searching for Scrooge, Bombie ends up in Duckburg, and delivers the doll to Scrooge's nephew, Donald, who looks just like his uncle Scrooge did when he first encountered Bombie.

Bombie made his first appearance in this 1949 story. It opens as Bombie, who has recently been revived as the counter-curse wore off, arrives in [[Duckburg]], still looking for [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Bombie runs into [[Donald Duck]], and thinks he recognizes in him the young Scrooge he has been looking for for seventy years, and gives him the doll, which stings Donald. Learning Bombie's backstory from [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]], Donald leaves for Africa along with [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. As he no longer has a mission to fulfill, Bombie is confused, and tears begin to pour from the old ghoul's pupilless eyes. Whereas Donald is unsympathetic to Bombie, the kids take him into pity and decide to bring him back to Africa with them. Donald eventually uses him as a weapon to get rid of Foola Zoola's voodoo tribe by tying rubber to his feet and sending him bounce around in the village, as the massive zombie knocks down soldier after soldier in his endless bouncings. He is last seen still bouncing by the ducks as they leave Africa, and they comment that even if he bounces for months he'll still be alright, and saying that hopefully, Foola's curse will end one day, and Bombie will be free.

Bombie makes his animated debut in the episode "[[The Richest Duck in the World!]]" as an invincible monster in the form of a curse who chases down the richest person in the world.
