'''Patricia Maria "Trish" De la Rosa''' is the one of the tritagonists of ''[[Austin & Ally]]''. She is a 15-year-old fashionista, who becomes [[Austin Moon|Austin]]'s personal stylist and manager. She's also [[Ally Dawson|Ally]]'s best friend. She's known to wear a lot of weird uniforms because she goes through lots of jobs. She tends to get annoyed with [[Dez Wade|Dez]] often. They are currently frenemies. They have a strong love-hate relationship. 

Trish is the type of person who loves having a loud outfit. She can be a bit bossy and lazy, but always means well and looks out for those close to her. She is a part of Team Austin and manages the group well. Trish can occasionally be selfish, but overall she's a great friend. 

Her jobs are known to frequently change, as she would get fired due to lack of discipline at work; however, she takes her job as being Austin's manager very seriously, as she said that it's the only job she ever liked, in "Managers & Meatballs". Throughout the series, she gets more serious about managing and expands her clients to bigger stars, such as Boynado. She is the wife of [[Chuck McCoy]]. She was portrayed by [[Raini Rodriguez]].

==Personality==
Trish is a fun-loving, lazy, selfish, and sometimes sarcastic girl. She is constantly getting hired and then fired from job after job because she does not apply herself, dislikes work, and is often not there to work, has a lack of effort and responsibility, and uses the items from her jobs for selfish use, and her parents force her to get a job because of irresponsibility. She is Ally's best friend and Austin’s manager. Even though her wild schemes sometimes lead to trouble, she can always count on her friends to help her out of any kind of jam. She likes angry, bitter, and mean people, as shown in Rockers & Writers, Bloggers & Butterflies, and Deejays & Demos.
