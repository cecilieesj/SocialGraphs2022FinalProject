'''D-FIB''' is a character in [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s 2008 animated feature film, [[WALL-E]].

==Appearances==
===''[[WALL-E]]''===
None of these defibrillation robots (except for the reject one) are seen, but their purpose is to revive passengers that have suffered heart attacks. The reject D-FIB appears to have too much charge in her paddles, shown when she shocks a test dummy and sets it on fire. This comes in handy when battling with the [[SECUR-T|SECUR-T bots]]. She is freed from the Repair Ward by [[WALL-E (character)|WALL•E]] and helps fight the SECUR-T bots by frying them with her overcharged paddles.

==Video games==
D-FIB also appears in the ''WALL-E: The Video Game'' where she unlocks security doors (with an image of her) for WALL•E.﻿

==﻿Trivia==
*The reject D-FIB has a broken arm (due to the way it hangs down).
*According to the film and the video game, the only word she says (and can say) is "clear".
*In the Wall-E video game, she is red.
