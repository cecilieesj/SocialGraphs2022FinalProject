The '''Salesman''' is the owner of rather scary books who only appeared in the [[1945]] animated short, ''[[Duck Pimples]]''.

==Role in the short==
Donald has a scary and unpleasant evening, until a shady-looking book Salesman appears at his door. Soon after, he disappears, leaving him with a collection of "whodunnit?" novels. He is not seen again after this scene.

==Other Appearances==
The Salesman also appears in ''[[Mickey's 60th Birthday]]'', where he arrives at Donald's house, to arrest him on the charge of abducting [[Mickey Mouse]], who is under a spell, so others do not recognize him, until he finds his own magic.
