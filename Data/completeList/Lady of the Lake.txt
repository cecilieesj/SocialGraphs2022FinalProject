She is featured in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated series ''[[Gargoyles]]''.

==Background==

*Conjuring a Water Djinn.
*Hydrokinesis: The magical ability to create and control water.

*Hydroportation: Ability to magically teleport over short or long distances via liquid water.

==History==
The enchanted sword Excalibur is in the Lady's keeping; in King Arthur's time, she gave the sword to him, but received it back after his final battle. She was one of the three women who bore the wounded Arthur away to Avalon after the Battle of Camlann, the other two being Nimue and Morgana le Fay. When King Arthur and Griff were brought to New York on their quest for Excalibur, they, accompanied by the Trio and Hudson, encountered the Lady of the Lake in a lake in Central Park. She told Arthur that he must prove himself worthy of Excalibur once again, and tested him by pitting him against a Water Djinn, which he vanquished with the help of the gargoyles. Afterwards, she showed him where the sword lay, in the stone dragon statue in the center of the maze in the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and then she disappeared.Â Shortly thereafter, the Lady of the Lake returned to Avalon for the Gathering.
