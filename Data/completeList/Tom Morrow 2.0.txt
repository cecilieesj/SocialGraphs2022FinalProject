== History ==

=== Background ===
Tom Morrow 2.0 is a robot who served the function of hosting Innoventions within E.P.C.O.T.'s Future World.  It is seemingly the successor to a robot known simply as [[Tom Morrow|Professor Tom Morrow]] who served a similar function in [[Tomorrowland]], where he also served as mayor.  It is unknown what their exact relationship is.  At some point in the 2000s, Tom Morrow 2.0 came under the possession of RoboMart, a subsidiary of the evil alien corporation [[X-S Tech]].

=== Development ===
Tom Morrow 2.0 is an audio-animatronic character inspired by the character of Tom Morrow, here most notably featured in the [[Disneyland]] incarnation of [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]].  The character of Tom Morrow originated however from the original [[Rocket to the Moon]] attraction in Disneyland, originally having been portrayed as a human. He could've also been inspired by TOM, the robot host of competitor Cartoon Network's weekday afternoon action block Toonami.

Tom Morrow 2.0 was removed in the 2007-2008 renovation of Innovations. The robot later made an appearance at the Odyssey Building which also features [[Figment]] from the original [[Journey into Imagination]] ride, and one of the characters from [[Kitchen Kabaret]].
