'''Patty''' is  [[Albert Dontzig|Albert Dontzig']]<nowiki/>s niece. She appeared only once on Hannah Montana, in ''[[Bad Moose Rising]]''. [[Jackson Stewart|Jackson]] struck a bet with [[Miley Stewart|Miley]] that she could not handle a little sister, but to prove to him that she could, Miley watches Patty who gets on her nerves. Finally she admits she can't handle it, but [[Jackson Stewart|Jackson]] drives her to the fashion show anyway.
