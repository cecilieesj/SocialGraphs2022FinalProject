==History==
===''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]''===
The Wrecking Crew attack [[She-Hulk]] in an alley. Even though they put up a fight, She-Hulk manages to defeat them.

===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
The Wrecking Crew was hired by [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], disguised as the [[Leader]], to steal a Gamma Energy Emitter from Stark Industries. The Crew attacked a dock and fought with the New York Police Department and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]]. They were defeated but they served their purpose. They were meant as a distraction for Thor while Loki attacked Asgard with the Frost Giants.

They were sent to the Cube, and after the breakdown they worked for the actual Leader, who took the Cube and created a Gamma dome around it. They guarded the Gamma core and used the Leader's Gamma devices to become monstrous versions of themselves, but [[Black Panther]] deactivated the Gamma core and they were recaptured.Â 

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
The Wrecking Crew faced [[Spider-Man]] and his team and left a lot of colateral damage before escaping. Their plan was to return disguised as members of Damage Control and use the reparations as a cover to rob the nearby bank. They were found and defeated.
