==Role in the films==
===1965 film===
In the original film, Patti lives with her sister, Ingrid, while their parents are away and is dating a surfer boy who does nothing but surf and eat strange sandwiches. She loves her cat, [[D.C.]], and becomes part of a kidnapping investigation when she discovers him wearing a wristwatch with a message that says "Help!" around his neck. She gets FBI agent [[Zeke Kelso]] to investigate and leads to misadventures with her darn cat.

===Remake===
In the 1997 remake, Patti is portrayed as a typical gothic teenager (portrayed by [[Christina Ricci]]) who dresses in nothing but black and her only friend is her cat, D.C. Unlike her 1965 counterpart, she is a lonely teenage girl who lives with her parents who are bright and cheerful much to her dismay.

She becomes part of a kidnapping investigation when she discovers D.C. wearing a wristwatch with a message that says "Help." She hires Agent Zeke Kelso (portrayed by [[Doug E. Doug]]) to investigate.

In the end, she changes her ways, starts dressing in brighter colors, makes new friends, and shows more respect for the town she lives in.
