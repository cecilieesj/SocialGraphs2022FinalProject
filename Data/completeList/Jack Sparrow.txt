{{Quote|When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing, mate. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.|Captain Jack Sparrow to [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]]|Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl}}

'''Captain Jack Sparrow''' is the protagonist of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series, making his debut in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. Drunken, charismatic, and morally gray, Jack is a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. His first love was the sea, his second, his beloved ship the ''[[Black Pearl]]''.

Throughout a series of grand and thrilling adventures, Jack has battled the likes of his [[Treasure of Cortés|cursed]] first-mate [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Hector Barbossa]], his tyrannical ex-employer [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], the legendary sailor [[Davy Jones]], the fearsome pirate [[Blackbeard]], and the ghostly Spaniard [[Captain Salazar]], among others. He has often achieved his goals by forming alliances with more noble and heroic figures, such as [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]], or the ruthless con artist [[Angelica]]. Jack's crew is somewhat interchangeable, with many of his men abandoning ship due to the captain’s treacherous and unorthodox nature, or simply because of his bad luck. The one constant is [[Joshamee Gibbs]], Jack’s longtime friend and loyal first mate.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Jack Sparrow's distinctive look is accentuated by long, dark brown hair and a short goatee beard. Additionally, Jack sometimes wears a faded black tricorn hat. By Jack's later life, his hair is adorned with all manner of beads and trinkets gathered from his travels and adventures all over the world, each one having a story that reminded him of a previous adventure. Jack wears long sea boots and long, hard-wearing linen trousers. A knotted striped-red sash is tied around his waist, where he stows his pistol when not in use. On Jack's back is a long brown coat that he removes when the need arises to either swim or if the air gets too hot. A faded blue waistcoat with a shorter lightly-colored back area and a torn white undershirt make up the rest of the ensemble. A red bandanna is always wrapped around his head, complemented by his piece of eight (a small, ancient Siamese coin woven into Moroccan beads) draped over his forehead. After his piece of eight was destroyed in the ritual to release [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]], Jack replaced it with new trinkets. Jack wears two belts, one to which he attached some odd additions. Beneath the belt, Jack wears a sash.

[[File:Piratebrand.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jack wearing one of his tattoos and a pirate brand.]]
Like most pirates, Jack Sparrow wears four rings, while also wearing a shredded black wristband on his right wrist. Jack has two marks on his right forearm: the distinctive "P" brand marked on pirates by members of the [[East India Trading Company]] (this one in particular administered by [[Cutler Beckett]]) and a tattoo of a sparrow flying across the evening sunset. This is a well-known identifying mark, signifying that the bearer has sailed all of the Seven Seas. Jack's back was also extensively tattooed with a 15th-century poem called the 'Desiderata'.

Perhaps the most fantastic object Jack carries among his "effects" is his Compass. Obtained in barter from [[Tia Dalma]], Jack's compass does not point north, but rather towards the thing that the person holding the compass wants most. Since "the thing you want most in this world" is a fairly loose definition, it has been demonstrated to mean people (i.e.: Elizabeth wanting Jack or Will), objects (such as the ''Black Pearl'' or the Dead Man's Chest), or a place ([[Isla de Muerta|Isle de Muerta]] or [[Shipwreck Cove]], for example).

Jack's pistol remained with him for many years, after it was loaded with a single shot and carried with him to the desert island he was marooned on by Barbossa after being overthrown in a mutiny. Jack escaped, and for the next ten years carried the pistol with him, intent on killing Barbossa with the single bullet he had been left. Thus, Jack could not bring himself to fire his pistol on anyone else; although he drew his pistol on Will Turner in order to end a duel between them, he did not use his shot and was thus ended up captured by the Royal Navy. Jack ultimately got his revenge on Barbossa, shooting him in the heart moments before Will reversed the curse that protected Barbossa. Jack was then free to load his pistol to capacity and continued to use it years after.

{{Quote|You will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!|Jack Sparrow}}
Captain Jack Sparrow's idyllic pirate life capsized after his first mate [[Hector Barbossa]] stole his ship, the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', and marooned Jack on a desert island with a pistol that had a single shot. Jack later escaped and pursued the ''Black Pearl'' ever since. Ten years after Barbossa's mutiny, Jack Sparrow arrives in [[Port Royal]] aboard the sinking ''[[Jolly Mon]]'' to "commandeer" a ship. After encountering two guards, [[Murtogg and Mullroy]], Jack sees [[Elizabeth Swann]] fall and saves her from drowning. Despite rescuing Elizabeth, the daughter of Governor [[Weatherby Swann]], [[James Norrington|Commodore Norrington]] recognizes the notorious pirate and orders his arrest. Jack escapes the marines and hides in a blacksmith's shop, where [[Will Turner]] works as an apprentice. The two confront each other, with Jack having familiarity with Turner. After a sword duel between the two, Jack is knocked unconscious and jailed, to be hanged the next day.

[[File:Jack_grabbed.png|thumb|left|250px|Jack looking at a cursed hand.]]
That night, while Jack stays locked in prison, Port Royal is besieged by the ''Black Pearl''. Captain Barbossa's crew attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping Elizabeth in the process; prior to this, Jack had a brief reunion with two members of his old crew, [[Koehler]] and Twigg, where he discovered a [[Curse of the Aztec Gold|curse]] was real. Having learned this, Jack also knew that there was truth to the stories that Barbossa's crew trying desperately to break the curse that he and the crew are now under after having found the [[Treasure of Cortés]]. The next day, Jack was visited by Will Turner, the young blacksmith who was also Elizabeth's childhood friend. Turner made an accord with Sparrow, to free the pirate on the condition that he aid the blacksmith in finding the ''Black Pearl'' to save Elizabeth. Though he initially refused, Jack agreed after first learning Will's name.

[[File:Jack_and_Will.png|thumb|right|250px|Jack and Will aboard the ''Dauntless''.]]
Stranded with no apparent way to pursue Barbossa, Jack and Will have no choice but to "borrow" a vessel. So they jump aboard the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'', the Royal Navy's fastest ship, and made way for open water. To steal the ''Interceptor'', the two had to trick Commodore Norrington by stealing the ''[[HMS Dauntless]]''. In a gallant attempt to rescue Elizabeth, the duo sailed the ''Interceptor'' to [[Tortuga]], where they recruited a ragtag crew with the help of [[Joshamee Gibbs]]. While talking to Gibbs about the venture, he revealed his personal stake in the mission, the ''Black Pearl'', as well as Will Turner being the "leverage". With the crew assembled, the ''Interceptor'' sailed for [[Isla de Muerta]], where Elizabeth is being taken to, held captive. Along the way, Will learns from Gibbs Jack was once captain of the ''Black Pearl'', when Barbossa, Jack's first mate at the time, mutinied and marooned him on an island. Barbossa gave Jack a pistol with a single shot, intended for suicide. Jack escaped three days later (supposedly by roping a couple of sea turtles) and kept the pistol for the next ten years, saving the bullet to kill Barbossa.

[[File:Jack_Barbossa_Black_Pearl_COTBP.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Barbossa and Jack aboard the ''Black Pearl''.]]
Rowing into Isla de Muerta, Jack and Will spy on Barbossa's crew. The pirates spend the treasure but learn it was cursed, turning them into immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are revealed in moonlight; the curse can be lifted if the coins and each pirate's blood is returned to the chest. Unbeknownst to Will, his father William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner sent a coin to his son, Will, believing the crew should remain cursed. Barbossa had Bootstrap tied to a cannon and thrown overboard, only later to learn his blood was needed to break the curse. Believing Elizabeth is Bootstrap's child, Barbossa anoints the last coin with her blood and drops it into the chest, but the curse remains unbroken. After reaching the island, Will suspected that Jack may betray him and knocks him out before rescuing Elizabeth. They escape to the ''Interceptor'', leaving Jack behind in the mercy of Barbossa's crew. Aboard the ''Black Pearl'', Jack barters with Barbossa until the ''Pearl'' catches up with the ''Interceptor'', in which Barbossa sent Jack to the brig. A battle commenced between the two ships, which ends with Barbossa's crew sinking the ''Interceptor'' and hold the crew as prisoners.

[[File:Fight_on_Isla_de_Muerta_21.png|thumb|250px|Jack and Barbossa fighting.]]
To Jack's dismay, Will reveals he is Bootstrap Bill's son and demands that Elizabeth and the crew be freed. Barbossa agrees but applies another loophole, marooning Elizabeth and Jack on the same island Jack had been left on ten years earlier. Will is taken to Isla de Muerta, where he is to be killed to break the curse. Elizabeth discovers how Jack escaped before: the island was used as a cache by rum runners and Jack bartered passage. By the next day, to Jack's anger, Elizabeth burns the cache of rum to create a signal fire that the HMS ''Dauntless'' spots. Both Elizabeth and Jack were able to persuade Commodore Norrington to sail for Isla de Muerta to save Will Turner. Norrington sets an ambush while Jack persuades Barbossa to form an alliance; he tells him to delay breaking the curse until they have taken Norrington's ship, ''Dauntless''. Jack's plan goes awry when Barbossa orders his undead crew to attack from underwater. Meanwhile, Elizabeth escapes her confinement and sneaks aboard the ''Pearl'' to free Jack's crew, who leave Jack behind and sailed with the ''Pearl'' while Elizabeth heads to the island alone to save Will. Meanwhile, Jack duels with Barbossa and is seemingly killed. However, Barbossa discovers that Jack is immortal just like the other pirates; he had stolen one of the medallions for himself in case such an encounter ever arose. Jack shoots Barbossa with the same pistol he had carried for ten years just as Will drops the last two medallions, stained with his and Jack's blood, into the chest. No longer immortal, Barbossa collapses and dies while the now-mortal pirates aboard the ''Dauntless'' surrender.

Despite the victory, Jack is arrested and sentenced to death. At his scheduled execution in [[Fort Charles]], Will Turner attempts to rescue Jack, but they are both quickly caught. Right at that moment, Elizabeth shows her love for Will before Sparrow escapes by falling off into the [[Port Royal]] harbor. Near the island was the ''Black Pearl'', which Jack swam towards, after which Commodore Norrington allows Jack one day's head start. The crew hauled Jack from the water and, as Sparrow put on his hat, appointed him captain. Taking the helm, Jack looked at his compass while singing "[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]]".

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
[[File:Bill_marks_Jack.png|thumb|left|250px|Jack Sparrow with Bootstrap Bill.]]
A year after the events of the first film, Jack Sparrow begins searching for the [[Dead Man's Chest]] due to his deal with the infamous [[Davy Jones]], made thirteen years earlier, when he had raised the then-sunken ''Black Pearl'' and made Sparrow captain. The Dead Man's Chest contains Jones's [[Heart of Davy Jones|heart]], which Sparrow can use as leverage against Jones and settle his debt, so he escapes a Turkish prison after acquiring a drawing of a [[Key to the Dead Man's Chest|key]], but fails to provide a heading, even with the use of his [[Jack Sparrow's compass|compass]]. Later, in the cellars of the ''Black Pearl'', Jack is reunited with [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], who had joined Davy Jones' crew to escape his fate trapped at the bottom of the ocean. Bootstrap also reminds Jack of the deal he made with Jones to raise the ''Black Pearl'' from the depths, and now he must either serve for one hundred years aboard the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' or be taken by the [[Kraken]] but before leaving, Bootstrap gives Jack the Black Spot and causes Jack to panic and wake up his crew, ordering them to sail for land, having lost his [[Jack Sparrow's hat|hat]] in the process.

[[File:Jack escaping Pall.png|thumb|right|250px|The cannibals chasing Jack.]]
This startling development interrupts the wedding plans of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who once again find themselves thrust into Jack's misadventures by [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the East India Trading Company, arrested them after aiding Jack's escape. While Elizabeth is imprisoned, Beckett sends Will to find Jack's compass in exchange for Letters of Marque which will make Jack a privateer and ensure Will and Elizabeth's pardon. Will ultimately finds the ''Black Pearl'' beached on an island, where he found Jack Sparrow as a god among the Pelegostos, a cannibal tribe, who intend on eating him. Having been imprisoned in bone cages, Will and other surviving crew members escaped to the ''Black Pearl'', followed swiftly by Jack, and are joined by [[Pintel]] and [[Ragetti]] who escaped prison. Jack's crew then visit the voodoo priestess [[Tia Dalma]]. After telling the crew about Davy Jones and his action of locking his heart in the Dead Man's Chest, Tia Dalma discovered that Jack had the Black Spot. Because Jones can only step on land once every ten years, the flamboyant soothsayer gave Jack a [[jar of dirt]] for protection. She then revealed where to find Jones' ship the ''Flying Dutchman''.

[[File:Jack_finds_his_headding.png|thumb|left|250px|Jack finding his heading.]]
Upon finding a shipwreck in an archipelago, Jack Sparrow tricked Will Turner into climbing aboard the shipwreck, claiming it was the ''Flying Dutchman'', only for the real ''Flying Dutchman'' to emerge from the ocean. Will was taken as a captive before Davy Jones himself confronts Jack and demands that Jack pay his debt. Jack argues that he was captain for only two years before he was mutinied by Barbossa, but Jones rejects his argument, stating that he's been calling himself "Captain" Jack Sparrow for the allotted years. The two captains then come to a new deal that Jack would be free if he brings Jones one-hundred souls (99 now that Jones has Will as "faith payment") in three days, in exchange for his own. Sailing to [[Tortuga]], Jack and Gibbs try recruiting new sailors, where he unexpectedly encounters a disgraced James Norrington, who has turned to a drunkard following his resignation and losing his resignation as well as losing his ship and crew whilst chasing Jack through a hurricane off Tripoli. Before departing, they met with Elizabeth, who stowed away on the ''Edinburgh Trader'' merchant ship. Both join the crew of the ''Black Pearl'', with Jack having convinced Elizabeth that she can free Will by finding the Chest. Along the way to the Chest's location, they realize Beckett wanted the Chest as well; both Jack and Gibbs point out if he controls the Chest then he will rule the seas.

[[File:Jack_with_the_heart.png|thumb|right|250px|Jack holding Davy Jones' heart.]]
The ''Black Pearl'' arrived at Isla Cruces, where Jack and Elizabeth pinpoint the exact spot where the Dead Man's Chest was buried with Jack's magic compass. This followed an unexpected appearance by Will Turner, having escaped Jones's ship after stealing the [[key to the Dead Man's Chest|key to the Chest]] from Jones while he slept in his cabin. But a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington. Will wants to stab the heart, thereby killing Jones and giving freedom to his father, whom he now met, from in Jones's service; while Norrington hopes to regain his "life" by delivering the heart to Beckett. Jack fears that if Jones is dead, the Kraken will continue hunting him with no one to stop it. The three fought for the key to their own goals, but Jones' crew also fought Elizabeth, Pintel, and Ragetti. By the end of the fight, Jack has unlocked the chest and hid the heart in the jar of dirt, only for Norrington to secretly steal it and then drew the ''Dutchman'' crew off with the chest, which he gives to them before running away.

[[File:JackvsKraken.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jack facing the Kraken.]]
Climbing aboard the ''Black Pearl'', Jack's crew are confronted by the ''Flying Dutchman''. After Jack makes fun of Jones with his jar of dirt, Jones orders to attack, but the ''Pearl'' is able to outrun the ''Dutchman''. The Kraken is then summoned to trap the ''Black Pearl'', by which point Jack discovers that the heart is missing. Before the Kraken attacks, Jack tries to escape in a longboat, which ends up being the last undamaged longboat after he attacks. But just as he comes near land, Jack is struck with remorse at abandoning his crew and tries to use his compass again. Jack returns to the ''Black Pearl'' as the Kraken continues to destroy the ship. Once there, he helps wound the Kraken's tentacles by shooting a net-full of explosives. With the Kraken delayed, Jack gives the order to abandon ship; when Joshamee Gibbs asks if he is sure that he wants to leave the ''Pearl'' behind to the Kraken, Jack reluctantly replies, "She's only a ship, mate." As the rest of the crew prepare for sail Elizabeth tricks Jack by giving him a passionate kiss while chaining him to the mast to save Will and the crew, having realized that the Kraken only wants him. Though Jack manages to free himself, the Kraken had returned. With no choice left, Captain Jack Sparrow could only place his hat - which was previously lost - once more atop his head and said: "Hello beastie". Drawing his sword, Jack faces the Kraken as he and the ''Pearl'' are dragged down to Davy Jones's Locker.

Later, after Jones discovers his heart is missing and Norrington meets with Beckett, the surviving members of Jack's crew return to Tia Dalma's shack. Will, Elizabeth, Gibbs, Pintel, Ragetti, Marty, and Cotton mourn the loss of Jack. Tia Dalma then asks if they wish to rescue Jack from the locker, to which they agree. Tia Dalma comments they will need a captain who is familiar with the waters. The aforementioned captain appears, revealed to be the resurrected [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]], who asks what has become of "his" ship.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
By this time, [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] has control of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', and its malevolent, vengeful captain, [[Davy Jones]]. To stand together, the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court are called upon to convene at Shipwreck Cove, their only hope to defeat Beckett, who has now taken over the seas. But Captain Jack Sparrow, now trapped in Davy Jones' Locker, must attend the meeting as the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, as he failed to pass his "piece of eight", a pirate lord's identification marker, to a successor. The newly-resurrected Barbossa leads a desperate quest to save Jack, using the [[Mao Kun Map|navigational charts]] belonging to Pirate Lord [[Sao Feng]], which they used to sail to World's End.

[[File:Jack_Barbosa_AWE.jpg|thumb|250px|Captains Jack and Barbossa arguing aboard the ''Black Pearl''.]]
In Davy Jones' Locker, Jack Sparrow has been hallucinating an entire crew of himself, before attempting to drag the ''Black Pearl'', now stuck on a seemingly endless desert. The ''Pearl'' would then be carried by crabs towards a beach where Barbossa and the rescue crew ended up. After a brief reunion, which Jack revealed Elizabeth's part in his death, Jack had no choice but to join in an increasingly shaky alliance with Barbossa, who had the charts that could lead them out, and to convene with the Brethren Court. While trapped in the Locker, Jack saw a deceased [[Weatherby Swann]], who revealed that if someone stabbed Davy Jones' heart, their heart would take its place and they would sail the seas for eternity. Jack Sparrow later solves the riddles in the charts ("Sunrise sets, a flash of green" and "Up is down") that indicates they must capsize the ''Black Pearl'' in order to escape the Locker; at sunset, the ship upturns back into the living world.

[[File:Jack_versus_Feng.png|thumb|left|250px|Sao Feng confronting Jack.]]
After returning to the living world, Jack and Barbossa found the [[Kraken]] washed ashore on an island. While looking for fresh water, the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' is ambushed by Sao Feng's men. Will Turner made a deal with the Chinese pirates, which was to have "Captain Turner" have the ''Pearl'' to free his father, and Turner also said, to Jack's dismay, that it was the only reason he came on the voyage. Jack then asked, "Did no one come to save me just because they missed me?", and was going to stand over with the few crewmen who raised their hands, but Sao Feng said that there was an old friend who wanted to see him before Jack faced the ''[[HMS Endeavor|Endeavour]]'', Cutler Beckett's flagship. Sparrow was escorted aboard and taken to the captain's cabin, where speaks with Beckett himself. Jack tries to make a deal with Beckett, in which Jack promised to lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove, and in exchange Beckett will not hand Sparrow over to Jones. Beckett at first thinks about confiscating Jack's compass to find the Brethren, but Jack Sparrow warns him that the compass points to his most desired thing, and since Beckett's desire is to see Jack dead, all the compass would point to is Jack Sparrow himself. Beckett then decides to kill Jack Sparrow and then use the compass to find the Brethren himself, but Jack convinces Beckett to not kill him because Jack is the only one who could help Beckett draw the pirates out from the nigh-impregnable fortress. Before they could finalize their deal, the ''Black Pearl'' attacks the ''Endeavour''; Feng agreed to help Barbossa in exchange for Elizabeth. Amidst the chaos, Jack Sparrow flees with the ''Pearl'', managing to damage Beckett's ship enough so they wouldn't follow.

On the way to Shipwreck Cove, Jack catches Will leaving a trail for Beckett's ship to follow. The two discuss Davy Jones' heart, where Jack suggests he stab the heart to solve Will's conflicting obligations, both his father and Elizabeth, so he could achieve immortality. Jack then has Will thrown overboard after giving him his compass so Beckett can find Shipwreck Cove. Later, the ''Black Pearl'' arrives at the cove, where Jack and Barbossa joined the other members of the Brethren Court. Among the members was Elizabeth, now a Pirate Lord because of Sao Feng's death, who revealed Beckett and the ''Flying Dutchman'' were on their way. Elizabeth proposed they fight, most of the Lords preferred to stay hidden in the cove, and Barbossa brought up freeing the goddess [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]]; Jack, however, agreed with Elizabeth in the fighting. But Barbossa calls upon [[Captain Teague]], Keeper of the Code, to confirm that only a Pirate King can declare war. Jack then calls for a vote, the first eight Lords vote for themselves, and Jack breaks the stalemate by voting for Elizabeth, who favors a war. After the meeting, Jack briefly speaks with Teague, who shows him his [[Jack Sparrow's Mother|mother's head]]. During a [[parley]], Jack is traded for Will, who accompanied Jones and Beckett after Sparrow sent him overboard, much to Jones' pleasure. Before leaving willingly, Barbossa takes Jack's piece of eight, one of the needed items to free Calypso with. Jack is then taken to the brig of the ''Flying Dutchman'', where he hallucinates again.

[[File:Jack_fighting_Jones_on_the_mast_of_the_Dutchman.png|thumb|right|250px|Jack fighting Davy Jones.]]
By the time the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Flying Dutchman'' face off in battle around a massive maelstrom, created by Calypso, Jack remained in the Dutchman's brig until he set himself free by doing what Will did to free him from Fort Charles prison long ago. Jack then went to the captain's cabin and retrieved the Dead Man's Chest from Mullroy and Murtogg. Going out to the main deck, Jack is accosted by Davy Jones, who had the key to the Chest, which leads to a sword fight. During the fight, Davy Jones broke Jack's sword and threw him to a crewman swinging on a rope, which Jack uses to shoot the Chest out of Jones' hand. The two later continued their duel on deck, where Will tried retrieving the Chest before fighting Bootstrap Bill Turner, who now suffers from dementia. Elizabeth also boards the ''Dutchman'' to fight Davy Jones, while Jack finds the key and unlocks the Chest. Holding Davy Jones' heart, Jack reveals his intention to stab the heart, but Jones mortally wounds Will. As Bootstrap came to his senses and fought Jones, Jack ultimately chooses to save Will by helping him stab the heart; killing Jones and making Will the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Jack and Elizabeth watch Will die before escaping the ''Dutchman'' as it continued sailing down into the maelstrom. Climbing aboard the ''Black Pearl'', Jack ordered the crew to prepare for the attack while Beckett has the ''Endeavour'' move to attack the ''Pearl''. But the ''Dutchman'' resurfaces with Will at the helm, and as the new captain of the now-human crew of the ''Flying Dutchman''. Both the ''Pearl'' and the ''Dutchman'' sail to the ''Endeavour'' and, by Jack's order, fired a full broadside, which ended with Beckett's death.

[[File:AWEJacklooksback.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jack at Tortuga.]]
Because Will Turner is bound aboard the ''Dutchman'', Elizabeth bid Jack, Barbossa and the crew farewell before Will and Elizabeth have one day together. While docked in Tortuga, Jack speaks with Scarlett and Giselle, promising them a ride aboard the ''Black Pearl''. However, while escorting the wenches to the ''Pearl'', Jack finds a dinghy in its place; Barbossa had stolen the ''Pearl'' again, leaving Jack and Gibbs at the docks. Fortunately, Jack anticipated Barbossa's treachery and had already taken out the middle of the map, which Barbossa was going to use to find the [[Fountain of Youth]]. Jack sings [[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]] as he raises his flag, unravels the map, and uses the compass to find a bottle of rum before setting sail to find the Fountain.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]''===
[[File:On_stranger_tides13.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jack Sparrow meeting with King George.]]
After reaching a dead-end in his search for the [[Fountain of Youth]], Captain Jack Sparrow sails to London in an attempt to rescue his first mate, [[Joshamee Gibbs]], who is mistaken for Jack Sparrow himself. During Gibbs' trial, Jack disguises himself as the judge and condemns Gibbs to life in prison. Jack then takes off his disguise before joining Gibbs in the paddy wagon, after having already paid the driver. As the two catch up, Gibbs told of a rumor that Jack Sparrow was looking for a crew in London. They realize it's an impostor, who Jack is intrigued to find as the impostor has a ship. Gibbs and Jack then talk about Jack's quest to find the Fountain of Youth, before the carriage abruptly stops. Opening the doors, Jack and Gibbs are captured by the Royal Guards; the driver was again paid off. While Gibbs was taken away, Jack was brought before [[King George II]], who wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish locate it. Heading the expedition is Jack's old nemesis, Captain [[Hector Barbossa]], now a privateer in service to the Royal Navy after losing his leg and the ''Black Pearl''. Despite being outnumbered, Jack made one of his legendary escapes, while surrounded by guards and a room full of shocked advisors. Fleeing through the streets of London, jumping from carriage to carriage, Jack met with his father, [[Captain Teague]]. At the ''Captain's Daughter'' tavern, having heard that his son was heading to the Fountain, Teague informed Jack of the Profane Ritual. Although Teague advised Jack against setting sail until he knew every detail, he pointed Jack to Scrum, saying they had a ship and were now signing up sailors. Before leaving, Teague warned Jack that the Fountain would "test" him. Jack confronted the imposter, who he discovered to be his former love, [[Angelica]], who heard the Jack had been to the Fountain of Youth. Before they could go on about the subject, they fought off Royal Guards, and, shortly after escaping, Jack was knocked out.

[[File:Jack_Icannamefingersandpointnames.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jack facing [[Blackbeard]].]]
Five days later, Jack woke up and found himself shanghaied aboard the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', the ship of the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard]]. Jack worked as a deckhand with Scrum, who told him about the zombie officers and [[Philip Swift]], the missionary spared by Angelica, the ship's first mate. Meeting each other below deck, Angelica told Jack that she was conning Blackbeard into believing she was his daughter. Jack also learned that Blackbeard lived under a prophesied death in the hands of a one-legged man, predicted by his zombie quartermaster, and sought the Fountain of Youth. Trapped on a ship crewed by zombies, sailing to a place of almost certain death, the rebellion was Jack's only option. Jack brought enough men to start a mutiny, but the revolt was quickly stopped when Blackbeard himself appeared. After confronting the mutineers, by having Jack and his conscripts get caught in its rigging, Blackbeard made an example by unleashing Greek fire upon the Cook. Jack was then brought into Blackbeard's cabin, where Blackbeard said he must reach the Fountain before the prophecy of his death comes true. In turn, Jack then tried to warn Blackbeard that Angelica was not his daughter, but Blackbeard didn't believe him. Angelica entered the cabin as Blackbeard started to torture Jack with a voodoo doll. Blackbeard's manipulation on the doll forced Jack to reconsider helping Blackbeard in his quest.

Later, Angelica walked on the deck where Jack offered her a drink while Scrum played the mandola in the background. Jack and Angelica then dance beneath the moon on the swaying deck of ''Queen Anne's Revenge''. As they danced, Angelica revealed the rules of the Profane Ritual to Jack: water from the Fountain of Youth, a mermaid's tear, and two silver Chalices that once belonged to Ponce de León. The Fountain's water must be drunk from the two Chalices; the person who drinks the water with the mermaid's tear gets all the years of life from the other. To bribe Jack, Angelica shows him a cabinet that has shrunken ships in bottles, including the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Angelica then revealed to Jack that she needs the years for Blackbeard, revealing that she was truly his daughter. Jack tried to warn Angelica that Blackbeard would kill her when he got the chance, but Angelica refused to listen.

[[File:HB_OST_3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jack and Barbossa.]]
The ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' arrives in Whitecap Bay, where Blackbeard's crew try capturing a mermaid but are attacked during the hunt. The battle ended with Jack Sparrow blowing up the remote lighthouse to scare away the mermaids. With the help of Philip Swift, Blackbeard's crew was able to capture one mermaid, who the missionary falls in love with and names [[Syrena]]. The next day, Blackbeard's crew went on a jungle trek, where Blackbeard sends Jack to retrieve the Chalices from Ponce de León's ship, the ''Santiago''. When Jack climbs aboard the vessel, he finds Barbossa waiting inside and discovers that the Spanish are in possession of the Chalices. The two old rivals and ex-captains of the ''Black Pearl'' join forces as they infiltrated the Spanish camp until they were captured and tied to palm trees. It was in their captivity that Barbossa revealed his true agenda: he only wants revenge on Blackbeard for attacking the ''Black Pearl'', which forced Barbossa to sacrifice his own leg to escape. Jack promised that Barbossa would have the chance to defeat Blackbeard, before improvising escape. Jack made a dazzling escape by swinging from palm trees and knocking out some very bewildered Spanish soldiers in the progress. Before leaving, Jack was able to retrieve the Chalices. Jack returns to Blackbeard with the chalices and [[Joshamee Gibbs]], with whom he had reunited while assisting Barbossa. Jack requested for his confiscated magical compass and Gibbs' release; in turn, Jack will give Blackbeard the Chalices. Blackbeard agrees and Jack gave Gibbs the compass while he accompanied Blackbeard's crew to the Fountain.

Finding the cave, despite disbeliefs by Blackbeard and Angelica, Jack read the written words on the Chalices ("Aqua de Vida") which led to the Fountain of Youth. As Jack led Blackbeard's crew through the Fountain's temple, Blackbeard is confronted by Barbossa and his crew. A battle ensues between the crews as Barbossa and Blackbeard fight, while Jack tries retrieving the mermaid's tear from Scrum and Angelica. The Spaniard's soldiers then arrive to destroy the Fountain, believing its power is an abomination against God. Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with his poison-laced sword, which Angelica accidentally cuts herself with while removing it from Blackbeard. While Jack tried finding the Chalices, which the Spaniard threw away, Barbossa claims Blackbeard's [[Sword of Triton|sword]], ship, and crew as payment for his leg before leaving to return to piracy. After finding the Chalices, given to him by the mermaid Syrena, who warned the pirate to not waste her tear, Jack brings the chalices to the wounded Blackbeard and Angelica. Jack tries to convince Blackbeard to let Angelica drink from the one with the tear, to save her, but Blackbeard drinks the Chalice instead and requests his daughter to sacrifice herself; Angelica agrees and drinks. Knowing that the self-serving Blackbeard would sacrifice his daughter, Jack lied about which Chalice contained the tear. The Fountain takes Blackbeard's life, rotting his body into a skeleton.

[[File:JackGibbs_MovieSurfers.png|thumb|right|250px|Jack speaking with Gibbs.]]
On a longboat, where Angelica's hands are bound, Jack rows across the water. Angelica holds him accountable for Blackbeard's death even though Jack retorts that he just did what any father would have done. On a small island, Jack and Angelica admit their love for one another, but Jack maroons Angelica. Rowing away from the island, Angelica tried to shoot him and Jack said "Missed!" Jack later finds Gibbs, who used the compass to locate the shrunken ''Black Pearl'' and is shown to be in possession of all Blackbeard's conquered ships in bottles. Hoping to bring the ''Black Pearl'' to its original size, they walk on the beach. When Gibbs asked about giving up a chance for immortality, Jack answers that immortality is not everything, though admitted that he himself would live forever as the "Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth". The two head off into the sunset, determined to continue living a pirate's life.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===
Jack falls into despair and depression after his searches for treasures continue to fail. He arrives to try to rob Saint Martin's Bank, but he and his crew manage to blunder the robbery, largely thanks to Jack's own incompetence and neglect. With their patience pushed to its collective limit, his crew abandons him. Truly desperate and out of money, Jack decides to trade his compass for a bottle of rum, inadvertently freeing his old enemy, the evil undead ghost [[Captain Salazar|Armando Salazar]] by the Devil's Triangle who now is searching for having his revenge on him. Down on his luck, Jack is later captured by the British Guards and imprisoned in Saint Martin's prison.

Creating a decoy in his cell, Jack grabbed a guard that came to his cell while demanding a sword, but the guard told him he didn't have one, was wanted for treason and was looking for Jack Sparrow before he was released. Jack then told the man that he was the pirate he was searching for, but the man was disappointed as he searched for years only to find out Jack was merely a drunk and pant-less man, even asking if he really was who he said was. Jack turned this around and questioned him on his identity. Jack then discovers the man is Will and Elizabeth's son [[Henry Turner]], becoming surprised his old allies had a child.

After talking a while, Henry requested Jack's help in freeing his father by locating the Trident of Poseidon, but Jack was uninterested to the point of falling asleep. However, Henry caught his attention by mentioning Salazar was resurrected and coming for him. Jack is told that only the trident can help him, so he decides to become allies with Henry and is told he needs to free a woman as well who can lead the way.

The next morning, Jack is sent to be executed while going out. He mistakes a man for his father, but the latter turns out to be his uncle, whom Jack catches up with before Sparrow is dragged away by the guards. He is asked for his selection of execution and foolishly picks to be executed via guillotine, though he regrets his choice after learning he will be decapitated. During the event after bothering the angry mob watching the execution, Jack was to be executed alongside a girl named Carina Smyth, who's been wrongly accused of witchcraft because of her interest in science under the request of Lieutenant Scarfield.

The execution of Jack and Carina, however, failed as Carina kicks the hangman off the platform, disrupting the event as Henry manages to save both of them, and with his crew, Henry, and [[Carina Smyth]]; the crew then fires a cannonball at the guillotine, saving Jack from his demise. Jack takes command of a tiny ship called the ''Dying Gull''. There, they set sail for [[Trident (Hercules)|Poseidon's Trident]] to defeat Salazar and save Will. When the crew discovers they're being pursued by Salazar, they strand Jack, Henry, and Carina on a boat in the middle of the ocean. When Carina spots a nearby island, she decides she wants to swim for it and jumps overboard. Salazar's ship finally catches up to the tiny boat Henry and Jack are on, and Salazar sets his ghost sharks after them. Meanwhile, Carina makes it safely to the island as Jack and Henry fight off the ghost sharks and manage to make it to the island. Salazar's crew chases after them through the water, but they can't walk on land, so Jack and Henry retreat into the safety of the forest on the island they're on. They're then captured by Jack's old acquaintance Pig Kelly, who Jack owes a large debt and attempts to force Jack to marry his disgusting sister as a payoff. In the course of the chaotic wedding ceremony, Jack accidentally ends up saying 'I do," causing the wedding to proceed.

Right as he's about to kiss the bride, Barbossa shows up, and as a wedding gift, dispatches Pig Kelly, freeing Jack from his forced marriage. Though relieved, Jack and Barbossa have a very awkward little reunion as he questions the latter's reason for being present. Barbossa tells him he needs Jack to defeat Salazar as Jack is skeptical since no ship can outrun Salazar's vessel. Barbossa reveals he is now aware Jack has the Black Pearl in a bottle on his person, so he decides to release it by stabbing the bottle with Triton's Sword.

After it grows partially on land, Barbossa takes it from Jack and throws it into the sea where it supposedly sinks, much to Jack's sadness. However, he also soon watches as the Pearl emerges back to its original size and is overjoyed at its return. However, Barbossa holds him at gunpoint as he takes command of the ship once more.

With Barbossa in charge of his vessel, Jack is tied by Barbossa to the mast. While restrained Jack finds out who Carina's last name, he recognizes it from an old acquaintance who was in a relationship with Barbossa and realizes that she is the latter's daughter. He taunts Barbossa with this knowledge as he reveals his past with having to give his daughter up after her mother died. Attempting to blackmail, Jack asked for him to give him back his compass, 400 bottles of rum, and Jack the Monkey (to eat), but fails.

Later, Jack fights with Salazar (who had attacked the ''Black Pearl''), but Salazar wins and tries to kill him but Jack distracts him telling him after spotting the island. Jack escape and save himself but Salazar kidnapped Henry. Jack going to Poseidon's Tomb along with Carina (Jack and Carina are now friends) but are attacked by a Henry posse duty by Salazar, Jack fights with Salazar/Henry but being defeated but survive. Salazar exit from Henry's body and try to kill Jack with the Trident but Jack with the help of Henry break the Trident breaking all curses of the sea making Salazar and his crew back to humans and mortals. Jack, Henry, and Carina are saved by the anchor of the Black Pearl, but Barbossa tells Carina that he is his father and sacrifices himself to save them and killing Salazar. Jack mourns Barbossa's death along with Carina, Henry, the monkey Jack, and the crew. Jack notices Henry watching Carina's sad expression and helps him win her over by giving him her book so he can return it to her.

Jack takes Henry and Carina back to Henry's home, where he uses his telescope and witnesses Will and Elizabeth's reunion, as well as the new union of Henry and Carina. Though content, he hides it by calling their happiness a revolting sight.

Jack is again made the captain of the Black Pearl, and with his crew, sails to his beloved horizon. However, a post-credits scene shows that the destruction of Poseidon's Trident brought back the evil Davy Jones from the dead, and he wants revenge on him, Will and Elizabeth.

====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow]]''====
Before he was even known as "Captain Jack Sparrow", he was simply known as Jack, a teenage stowaway who had a desire for adventure. He sailed aboard the ''[[Barnacle]]'' with a ragtag crew. Known as the fearless crew of the mighty ''Barnacle'', Jack Sparrow's mates had embarked on many adventures, first setting out on the quest for the Sword of Cortés, a weapon with unearthly power. Throughout their quest, the crew of the ''Barnacle'' encountered sea beasts, cursed pirates, and the cunning and vicious merfolk. Jack's later teenage adventures include reuniting with [[Captain Teague]] and searching for more treasures of immeasurable worth.

====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom|The Price of Freedom]]''====
Twenty-five-year-old Jack Sparrow is a clean-cut merchant seaman pursuing a legitimate career as a first mate for the East India Trading Company. He sometimes thinks back to his boyhood pirating days, but he doesn't miss Teague's scrutiny or the constant threat of the noose. Besides, he doesn't have much choice—he broke the Code when he freed a friend who had been accused of rogue piracy, and he can no longer show his face in Shipwreck Cove.

When Jack's ship is attacked by pirates and his captain dies in the altercation, he suddenly finds himself in command. The wily sailor's skillful negotiations with the pirate captain—who turns out to be a woman from his past—result in a favorable outcome that puts Jack in line for an official promotion. After making port in Africa, Jack is summoned by [[Cutler Beckett]], who makes him captain of a ship called the ''[[Black Pearl|Wicked Wench]]''. Beckett gives Jack an assignment. He has heard a legend about a magical island named Zerzura whose labyrinthine bowels are said to contain a glorious treasure. Beckett suspects that one of his house slaves, a girl named Ayisha, is from Zerzura. He asks Jack to take her along on his voyage and seduce her into divulging the island’s whereabouts. In payment for his services, Beckett promises Jack a share of the treasure.

But this task is not as easy as Jack initially believes. Before she agrees to reveal the location of her home, Ayisha insists that Jack take her to the New World to rescue her brother, who has been sold into slavery in the Bahamas. Their voyage is long and arduous, and as they weather a vicious storm and a surprise attack from an old pirate foe, Jack grows to respect and admire Ayisha's bravery. He knows that Beckett intends to enslave her people after robbing them of their treasure, and Jack's moral compass revolts at the idea. It might be possible to deliver Ayisha safely to Zerzura, obtain some of the treasure, and convince Beckett that he never found it.

After freeing a cargo of slaves, Jack was branded as a pirate, while the ''Wench'' was set aflame and sunk. After striking a bargain with [[Davy Jones]], the ghostly captain of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', to resurrect his beloved vessel, Jack had the ''Wench'' renamed the ''Black Pearl'' and began a new life as a pirate.

====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Legends of the Brethren Court|Legends of the Brethren Court]]''====
An army of shadows has been amassed. It's one goal: to destroy the Pirate Lords for their Shadow Master&mdash;an alchemist who has created a special gold that grants him unfathomable power. But the soothsayer, Tia Dalma has other plans for the Lords and cannot allow them to be destroyed. So she calls on the one man who can turn the tide&mdash;Captain Jack Sparrow. Tia Dalma sends Jack on a mission to recover nine pieces of Shadow Gold. She also warned that if he failed, the seas will become the playground of shadows. Jack would take on the Shadow Lord with the help of a new crew, including his first mate, [[Hector Barbossa]], the always-brooding [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Billy Turner]], and a sailor named Jean who Jack has known since they were both kids.

Jack Sparrow's quest leads to Asia where Jack's crew must work with Mistress Ching and Sao Feng to try and stop the Shadow Lord and the East India Trading Company. As the quest continued, Jack Sparrow sailed to meet the Sri Sumbhajee, the Pirate Lord of the Indian Ocean; confronting King Samuel, Pirate Lord of the Atlantic Ocean, with the aid of their former shipmate Gombo, now known as Gentleman Jocard. The search of the Shadow Gold concludes as Jack and his crew were en route to France, where they face a final showdown with the Shadow Lord.

===''[[Kingdom Keepers]]''===
Jack appeared during the first of the Disney Dream's performances but wasn't a Cast Member in costume. He was the genuine pirate of questionable greatness. However, he never once spoke, which was out of character for him, as he usually has at least one comical line or drunken gesture; it is highly possible that he is under [[Maleficent]]'s control like [[Stitch]] once was, given him and his crew tried to kill [[Finn]] with their swords if Dillard hadn't saved Finn. They later took the Keepers hostage below the Walt Disney Theatre and fought and tried to kill them with two Test Track Dummies. They actually succeeded by hurting [[Charlene]], but it didn't kill her as she went to the First Aid.

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Jack_Sparrow_KHII.png|250px|right|Jack Sparrow in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.]]
Jack is a character in the series and serves as a party member found in the world of Port Royal. First appearing in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', his story follows the plot of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'', where he was arrested for piracy on Port Royal while attempting to steal a ship to go after the Black Pearl. But after Barbossa took [[Elizabeth Swann]], [[Will Turner]] reminds Jack of the debt for freeing him, so the two, together with [[Sora]] and friends, hijack the ''HMS Interceptor'' to go after the Black Pearl.

While Sora and friends had to stand guard, though they worry about the two couldn't fight the Heartless, Jack and Will infiltrate the cave on Isla de Muerta, where a ritual is underway with Elizabeth, whose blood Barbossa believes will break the curse. Mistrusting Jack, Will knocks him unconscious. He rescues Elizabeth, and the two escape to the Interceptor, with Jack, captured and tied to the mast on the Black Pearl. After a fierce battle between Sora's friends and the Undead Pirates, the Interceptor crew is captured. After learning Will can break the curse, Barbossa left some [[Heartless]] and kegs of lit gunpowder to leave Sora and friends to their fate. But the heroes managed to overcome the odds and returned to the island and rescued Will.

Jack more than matches the ruthless captain blow for blow. While Jack is momentarily distracted, Barbossa impales him with his sword, believing he is mortally wounded. However, when he stumbles backward into the moonlight, Jack is revealed to be under the curse, having sneaked a coin from the chest to curse himself while Sora and friends dealt with Barbossa's cursed crewmen. Jack and Will lift the curse just after Jack fatally shoots Barbossa with the shot he has carried for ten years. No longer immortal, Barbossa falls onto the ground, dead. Though Will offered his hand to Jack, he took a step back in fear Will might hit him again. Jack's compass was then used to open up new routes with Sora's Keyblade.

On Sora's return trip to Port Royal, they discover that there are still cursed pirates in Port Royal. Jack and his crew journey to Isla de Muerta aboard the ''Interceptor'', saving Will from certain death, and on the way come across a member of Organization XIII, Luxord, who has stolen the chest with the cursed medallions and summons a giant Heartless to fight them. Upon defeat, Luxord calls for parley by throwing out four pieces of treasure to Gambler Nobodies and destroying the Interceptor with the Black Pearls armament.

After landing in the Ship Graveyard, the crew discovers that the curse has come back to Jack. The group hunts down the four stolen medallions, and eventually find them. Back at Port Royal, Luxord is there waiting for them to return the treasure. After it is returned, he summons the Heartless from before who is now under the curse. When they return the medallions, the curse on the Heartless lifts, but Jack's skeleton form remains. Goofy immediately realizes that Jack has been put under the Heartless' spell rather than the gold's curse.

After the Heartless is killed, the curse is lifted for good. The chest is then dumped into the sea to ensure that the curse does not ever resurface. As a reward for his trouble, Jack asks for Sora's Keyblade. Knowing the Keyblade would return to him, Sora agrees to it. When it vanishes back to Sora's hand though, Jack is not surprised. Jack vows to one day get a bloodthirsty crew together and steal the Keyblade. The story ends with Sora, Will, and Elizabeth commenting on Jack being the best pirate in the Spanish Main, as well as the whole ocean.

After the defeat of [[Xemnas]], Will and Elizabeth are shown on the Black Pearl. As Jack sails, the moon comes out and he checks his hand, still remaining human flesh.

Jack's outfit is also an unlockable costume in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Union χ]]''.

Jack returns as an ally in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.

==Trivia==
*Before Johnny Depp was cast, [[Michael Keaton]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Christopher Walken]], and [[Hugh Jackman]] were all considered for the role of Jack Sparrow. The concept of the first film was initially helmed by [[Steven Spielberg]], whose choices for the role were [[Bill Murray]], [[Steve Martin]], or [[Robin Williams]].
*Depp has noted his inspiration for Jack came from [[Wikipedia:The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Keith Richards]] and [[Wikipedia:Pepé Le Pew|Pepé Le Pew]]. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were inspired by [[Wikipedia:Bugs Bunny|Bugs Bunny]] and [[Wikipedia:Groucho Marx|Groucho Marx]].
**As an allusion to his inspiration, Keith Richards would portray Jack's father [[Captain Teague]] in the third and fourth films.
*Jack Sparrow would occasionally use the word "savvy" which was previously used by [[Mickey Mouse]] in ''[[Mickey's Man Friday]]''.
*Jack was mentioned in the ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' episode "[[Operation Mongoose]]".
**[[Captain Hook#Once Upon a Time|Killian Jones]] shares similarities to Jack: Not just because of being a pirate, but they both like rum, both are flirtatious and have a love for treasure.
*Interestingly, all of the first names of the actors who portray/voice Jack Sparrow begin with "J" ('''J'''ohnny Depp, '''J'''ames Arnold Taylor, and '''J'''ared Butler). This trait would later be broken by Anthony De La Torre who plays a younger version of Jack in the flashbacks in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|fifth film]].
*Concept art was made of Jack to appear in the video-game ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]'', but in the final game, his niche is filled in by a Jack Sparrow-esque pirate called [[Black Barty]] who seems to be an analogue for Jack. It is believed this was done for copyright reasons and is enhanced when examining how Barty's enemy, "Blackbeard" has a design nearly identical to Barbossa.
*One deleted running gag from Curse of the Black Pearl would have had Jack lost his nose prior to the events of the film and had it poorly stitched back on. Due to this his nose would have been made to look purple and he would have had a pathological fear of pepper and sneezing.
*On April 20, 2022, during his [[Wikipedia:Depp_v._Heard|defamation trial against ex-wife]] [[Wikipedia:Amber Heard|Amber Heard]], Johnny Depp stated he would not return for a sixth film in the franchise, even if Disney gave him "$300 million and a million alpacas", because of past production issues.<ref>[https://variety.com/2022/film/news/johnny-depp-cross-examination-begins-pirates-of-the-carribbean-6-1235237292/ Johnny Depp: Disney Wanted to Cut Ties on ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ ‘To Be Safe’]</ref><ref>[https://screenrant.com/pirates-caribbean-6-johnny-depp-return-response/ Johnny Depp Says He Would Turn Down Pirates Of The Caribbean 6 Now | ScreenRant]</ref>
