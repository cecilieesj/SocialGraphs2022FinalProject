==Relationships==
===Friends===
====[[Liv Rooney]]====

Liv is Ocean's friend. They first met in Steal-A-Rooney after Maddie set up the friendship between Ocean and Liv. Since then, despite Liv being mad about Maddie helping her find friends, Liv and Ocean have become good friends. In "[[Kang-a-Rooney]]", Liv and Ocean were seen hanging out and talking about the Halloween dance. Ocean was determined to figure out who Liv was dressed up as at the dance, which was a kangaroo. In the end of the episode, Ocean did not figure it out and Liv told her.

====[[Maddie Rooney]]====

Maddie was the one who introduced Ocean to Liv, hoping if they'd become friends. Maddie and Ocean most likely are friends because Maddie previously knew Ocean and Maddie wouldn't have introduced Liv to Ocean if Ocean weren't a nice person. Maddie also says that Ocean has a cool backpack (Steal-A-Rooney).
