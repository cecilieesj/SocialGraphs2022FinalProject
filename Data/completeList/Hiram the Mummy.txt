'''Hiram''' is a mummy from the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode, "[[Throw Mummy from the Train]]". He was the guardian of the tomb of Pharaoh Nutun-Khamun and the key to his diamonds. Somehow, he is able to talk to the Rescue Rangers, despite not being an animal.

== History ==
As Hiram said that they had to bury him alive to allow him to guard the ring of Nutun-Khamun (Notuncommon) in the end of the pharaoh's reign. thousand of years passed and Dr. Crockery and Wexler found the tomb where Hiram was guarding the ring. Hiram overhears the Dr's mistranslation and immediately plans to stop them from taking it, in midnight Hiram discovers the midget Wexler and is outmaneuvered by him giving him a humiliated defeat. 

He meets the Rescue Rangers when Gadget's miscalculated experiment failed and grabs Dale with the ring around him. Monty whacks him in the foot causing him to fall on the baskets. He proves to them he wants the ring back and tells them that he is the rightful guardian of the ring, he then helps them with another of Gadget's miscalculated attempts to remove the ring from Dale. He throws Dale attached to a spear into a gong with no avail. He reveals Wexler as a thief to the Rescue Rangers, only for Wexler to grab Dale and knock him and the rangers into his sarcophagus.  

After escaping the sarcophagus , as Wexler escapes with the ring Hiram then reveals that Crockery mistook diamonds for in realty it is a key to the Pharaoh's demon (the sphinx). worried about the doom of all Egypt, in the morning rids Sandy the Camel with the Rangers to the train that Wexler is on. Once on board he discovers Wexler sleeping in a room with an overzealous Egyptian who mistaken Hiram as a woman. Chip tells him to keep him distracted but with no avail. despite Zipper's attempt to get the ring back for a brief moment, Wexler still managed to get it back.

Hiram even tried to tell Chip and Dale to keep the Ring from the sphinx's forehead, but it was too late. When the Sphinx came to life, Hiram drove one of the tour buses to keep the Sphinx busy, and Gadget's attempt worked this time. 

After the Sphinx is restored and Wexler was punished, Hiram thanked the rangers for not only helping him get the ring back, but also being his friends.
