'''Diplodocus''' is a dinosaur that lived 150-145 million years ago during the late Jurassic period. It was a character in Disney's 1940 film ''[[Fantasia]] ''appearing in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
The Diplodocus is first seen in the film eating with the other herbivorous dinosaurs. When [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] appeared on the scene, like the other dinosaurs, it panics and runs away. After [[Stegosaurus]] is defeated, Diplodocus leaves the valley with the other Dinosaurs. Later, it is seen struggling to find food and water. Its final appearance is when it gets stuck in a tar pit and dies of heat exhaustion.

===''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''===
Two Diplodocus were seen only at the beginning of the movie. They, along with three [[Parasaurolophus]], witness a meteor supposed to cause the extinction of dinosaurs to pass by the Earth as they continue grazing.

==Trivia==
*In real life, Diplodocus lived in the Jurassic Period 150-145 million-years-ago, at the same time as Stegosaurus and Ceratosaurus. Thus, it did not coexist with [[Triceratops]], [[Parasaurolophus]], or [[Tyrannosaurus rex]], all of which lived in the Campanian-Maastrichtian of the Cretaceous Period 80-66 million-years-ago.
