'''Chuck E. Duck''' (also known as '''Ducky'''<ref name=commentary>''Partysaurus Rex'' audio commentary (Blu-ray + Digital formats)</ref>) is a character who was introduced in the [[2012]] [[Pixar]] short, ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]''. He is a rubber duck who is one of Bonnie's toys.

==Background==
Chuck is a rubber duck who is one of Bonnie's toys. He is depicted with the common colors of a rubber duck - yellow body and orange beak. Like all the bathtub toys, Chuck cannot move when not floating on water. When floating on water, it gives him the ability to move, resulting in a party with the other toys on Bonnie's bathtub.

==Appearances==

===''[[Partysaurus Rex]]''===
Chuck is first seen in a fantasy sequence of [[Captain Suds]] where he approaches Ducky and when a gigantic version of [[Rex]] emerges, it turns out that [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] is playing with his bathtub toys all along. [[Mrs. Anderson|Bonnie's mother]] sees her daughter telling her to have dinner at her grandmother's house instead just as she drains the water from the bathtub, resulting the water to drain. Chuck asks Rex that he was less scarier than the last sea monster, which Rex tells him that that his friends call him "Partysaurus Rex". Soon as all the water is drained, the rest of the bathtub toys started lying down due to no water on the tub. Rex then decides to help the bathtub toys by turning on the cold water to come out of the spouter from [[Drips the Whale|Drips]]. It ultimately results in Chuck and the rest of the bathtub toys dancing with each other happily thanks to Rex's plans, causing the toys to party in the bathtub - especially with extra soap.

Notcing a drain on the bathtub, Rex tosses a sponge in the shape of a frog on the drain, which Chuck tells a diver toy that they will overflow. Noticing that there is too much water in the bathtub, Rex turns off the lever from the spouter Drips is on, much to Chuck and the other toys' worry. However, the water from the shower starts pouring, resulting in Chuck and the bathtub toys to overflow. Chuck makes no further appearances after that, even during the part where Bonnie's mother is talking to a plumbing service company about Bonnie's bathtub being jammed.
