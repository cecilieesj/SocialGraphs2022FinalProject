{{Dialogue2|President Loki|WHY THE HELL IS THERE AN ALLIGATOR IN HERE?!|Kid Loki and Classic Loki|He's a [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]]!|attr=[[President Loki]], [[Classic Loki]] and [[Kid Loki]] about Alligator Loki|src=Journey into Mystery}}

'''Alligator Loki''' is a character from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] that appears in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''. He is a [[Variants|Variant]] of [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] that is an alligator. After creating a branched timeline, he was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and sent to [[the Void]].

==Background==
Alligator Loki is a Loki from an alternate reality, in which he was born or turned into an alligator. One day, he ate the neighbor's cat, which created a nexus event that caused the [[Sacred Timeline]] to branch, so he was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and his reality was destroyed. He was then judged for his crimes against the Sacred Timeline and pruned, being sent to [[the Void]].

Alligator Loki first appears during the middle credits scene of the [[The Nexus Event|fourth episode]]. He is being carried by [[Kid Loki]] and accompanied by [[Classic Loki]] and [[Boastful Loki]]. They find the [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Variant of Loki]] that was recently pruned and sent to [[the Void]] by the TVA, and they invite him to join them in order to survive.

{{Dialogue2|Classic Loki|He is overly sensitive like the rest of us.|Loki|Hang on, are you telling me that thing is a Loki too?|Classic Loki|Oh, yes.|Loki|Okay, fine. Willing to accept that.|attr=[[Classic Loki]] and [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] about Alligator Loki|src=Journey into Mystery}}

In the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], Alligator Loki follows the [[Variants|other Lokis]] while they move fast to leave the location, when they are questioned by Loki, who becomes frustrated as he wants to know what is going on. Loki points out that he only remembers being pruned and now he is suddenly surrounded by Variants of himself and an alligator. He states that, for some reason, he does not think that the alligator's presence is weird. The Lokis explain that everything that was pruned by the TVA ends up there and that [[Alioth]], a living tempest that devours energy and matter, makes sure nothing will ever return. Classic Loki states that they are in a shark tank, with Alioth being the shark. This last comment makes Alligator Loki growl, so Classic Loki tells the alligator that there is no such thing as an alligator tank and that the shark metaphor is better. Then, Classic Loki turns to Loki and explains that Alligator Loki and very sensitive like all of them, which surprises Loki as he realizes that the alligator is also a Loki Variant. When Classic Loki confirms this, Loki is still visibly astonished but states that he is willing to accept this fact. When they finish their explanation, Kid Loki, who is the King of the Void, tells them that they should keep moving. Alligator Loki, along with the other Lokis, follow him until they arrive at their hideout, the Loki Palace.

Inside the hideout, Alligator Loki rests in a kids pool and drinks the wine Classic Loki gives him, while the Lokis talk about their stories. When Boastful Loki claims that he killed both [[Iron Man]] and [[Captain America]] before acquiring all six [[Infinity Stones]], Alligator Loki growls at him. Classic Loki explains that the alligator is saying that Boastful Loki is lying. Boastful Loki then states that at least his nexus event was not eating the wrong neighbor's cat like Alligator Loki's. This infuriates the alligator and he jumps on Boastful Loki, trying to bite him. He is stopped by Loki and Classic Loki, as they manage to grab the alligator and throw him back into his pool.

Later, when Loki attempts to leave the hideout to go back to the TVA to find [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]], a female Variant of Loki, an army of Loki Variants led by [[President Loki]] arrives. Boastful Loki reveals that he betrayed them by telling their location to President Loki in order to gain the army of Lokis and overthrow Kid Loki to become the new King of the Void. However, President Loki also betrays Boastful Loki by not letting him have the throne or the army of Loki Variants. Then, the army betrays President Loki, wanting to claim the throne for themselves. Frustrated, President Loki then notices Alligator Loki that is growling at him at the other side of the room and asks why they have an alligator. Kid Loki and Classic Loki reply that the alligator is also a Loki while Alligator Loki attacks President Loki, biting off his hand. Horrified, President Loki screams as the Loki Variants start to fight each other inside the bunker and Kid Loki immediately carries Alligator Loki away from them. Classic Loki then casts illusions that allow him, Loki, Kid Loki and Alligator Loki to escape from the Loki Palace unnoticed. 

Outside, after Loki convinces Classic Loki and Kid Loki to kill Alioth and help him go back to the TVA in order to find Sylvie, they think about a plan as they go watch Alioth from afar and Alligator Loki growls. Loki interprets this as the alligator agreeing with his plan, but Classic Loki tells him that Alligator Loki is actually praying because he thinks that they are all going to die. Right after, Loki reunites with Sylvie, who is accompanied by [[Mobius]], and introduces the other Loki Variants to her. As Sylvie becomes surprised to see an alligator Loki Variant, Loki tells her that it is best not to question it.

{{Dialogue2|Mobius|The [[Time Variance Authority|TVA]] arrested a lot of Lokis, but, no, I don't remember an alligator. I mean, who's to say he's even a Loki [[Variants|Variant]]?|Classic Loki|He is green, isn't he?|Mobius|I don't know. He could be lying. The long con. Of course, that just makes him more likely to be a Loki. It's always the game within the game with you guys, which I respect.|attr=[[Mobius]] and [[Classic Loki]] about Alligator Loki|src=Journey into Mystery}}

Afterwards, Alligator Loki is with Kid Loki and Classic Loki as they sit together with Mobius around a fire. Mobius looks at Alligator Loki and states that the TVA did arrest many Loki Variants, but he does not remember them capturing any Loki that was an alligator. He then questions if Alligator Loki is even a Loki Variant. Classic Loki replies that he should be because he is green, but Mobius tells him that the alligator might be tricking them, although this would make him more likely to be a Loki. The Lokis and Mobius later plan their next actions. Loki decides to stay with Sylvie to face Alioth with her, while Mobius decides to return to the TVA using a [[TemPad]]. Mobius asks if Kid Loki, Classic Loki and Alligator Loki would like to go with him and escape the Void. Kid Loki and Classic Loki reply that they will stay because the Void is their home. Then, Classic Loki and Kid Loki say goodbye to Loki and the others, before walking away as Alligator Loki follows them.
