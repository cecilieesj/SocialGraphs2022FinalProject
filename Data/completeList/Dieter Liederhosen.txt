'''Dieter Liederhosen''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the [[Germany|German]] frenemy of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] in that he aids her, yet sometimes opposes her and her goals.

==Background==
Dieter Liederhosen is a young boy of German descent who attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with [[Pepper Ann Pearson]], [[Milo Kamalani]] and [[Nicky Little]]. It is established that he and his mother, Gerta, arrived in Hazelnut on an "obstetrician exchange program", but had to leave his father behind due to the "Edelweiss Crisis". Dieter somewhat befriended the trio when [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]] was going into labor with [[Moose Pearson|Moose]]. Upon her birth, Dieter indirectly gave her her nickname after noticing a cup of chocolate mousse pudding. His first bite of it would entice his love of American cuisine and international foods. His biggest love is for a cartoon monkey named Klaus the Monocled Monkey who is apparently a national treasure in his homeland.

Dieter spends much of the series being a frenemy of sorts to Pepper Ann and frequently switches back and forth being a supportive ally to the opposition of whatever is at stake. He is mostly interested in trying different foods and it is sometimes implied that he wants to create the ultimate delicacy of some kind based on his own interests. Because of this, he has become incredibly obese, though he does not appear to be bothered by this. At times, he is shown to have access to numerous expensive things, implying that his family is wealthy to a certain degree. A running gag is that girls find him irresistibly attractive, despite his appearance and his own lack of interest. 

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Dieter has lost weight, by conquering his eating habits and mastering isometrics, and has become a successful spokesperson. He apparently is in a constant state of clenching.

===Personality===
Dieter is a relatively good natured young boy who is friendly and sociable. While he comes off as naive and sometimes clueless, he can actually be very observant, though at times he can fail at this as well. When put in a position, he can be very cocky and arrogant and even downright cruel to people, but becomes despondent when he realizes he is wrong or loses. Despite this, he does not mean any harm and can actually be very supportive, but will occasionally also show some cowardice. It is implied that he considered something of a weak link.

===Physical appearance===
Dieter is a short and rotund Caucasian boy. He has short blond spikey hair, similar to Bart Simpson of ''The Simpsons'', and tiny spectacles. He usually wears a white t-shirt with a picture of Klaus' head and green shorts. Additionally, he wears green-turquoise socks and brown sandles. 

==Trivia==
*Dieter is supposedly older than Pepper Ann as he celebrated his thirteenth birthday in "[[Have You Ever Been Unsupervised]]".
*His surname is, of course, a play on the German pant garment [[wikipedia:Lederhosen|lederhosen]].
*Based on the fact that Dieter does not like having a relationship, despite various girls throwing themselves at him, it is possible that he is asexual. However, he did show some admiration towards [[Trinket St. Blair]] at one point.
*He apparently smells like rotting apples.
