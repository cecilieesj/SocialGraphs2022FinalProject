'''Brandon the Singer''' is a recurring character in ''[[Recess]]''. He always sings everything he says. It is so annoying to the other kids that in one episode ("[[The Voice]]") when a bee flew into his mouth and caused his vocal chords to swell, they actually cheered.

Brandon was voiced by Michael Schulman.
