Han's horse's name is Sitron, which we all know is Norwegian for...wait for it...Lemon.|date=September 13, 2013}}</ref> is [[Hans|Prince Hans]]' horse and a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2013]] animated feature film ''[[Frozen]]''. He accompanies Hans to the kingdom of [[Arendelle]] for [[Elsa|Queen Elsa]]'s coronation.

==Physical appearance==
Sitron is a Fjord horse with a round, strong build. Fjords are solidly built, though not as solid as a large draft, they are a draft-type horse. He is dun-colored, and has a mane of black and off-white. He looks similar to [[Anna]]'s horse, though hers is a paler gray color with a white-and-black mane.

==Appearances==
===''[[Frozen]]''===
Sitron first appears when [[Anna]] knocks into him on the docks after "[[For the First Time in Forever]]". After knocking into him, Anna falls into a boat, but [[Hans]] and Sitron keep it from falling into the fjord. Hans dismounts Sitron to help Anna and introduce himself. Upon hearing Anna announce herself as a princess, Hans and Sitron both bow, tipping the boat. Sitron notices this, then pushes the boat back upright, causing Hans and Anna to fall over. Fortunately, the boat lands on water, allowing the two royals to introduce themselves. When the coronation bell rings, Anna leaves as Hans watches, but Sitron removes his hoof off the boat to wave to Anna, causing Hans to fall in the water.

Later in the film, during the capture of [[Elsa]], Sitron serves as Hans' mount to the troops marching to Elsa's [[Elsa's Ice Palace|ice palace]], and accompanies his master back to Arendelle.

Sitron is not seen being sent back to the Southern Isles with Hans after the prince's true villainous nature is exposed, leaving his fate unknown.

===''[[Big Hero 6]]''===
A horse resembling Sitron appears in a painting at Fred's mansion in ''Big Hero 6''.

==Trivia==
*The name Sitron was confirmed for the horse by ''Frozen'' writer [[Jennifer Lee]], who was asked about the horse's name on her Twitter account.<ref name=":0" /> The name was actually based off the name '''Lemon''', given by fans of the film on the blogging website Tumblr, as "sitron" is the Norwegian word for "lemon".
*Sitron is a {{WikipediaLink|Fjord horse}}, which is native to [[Norway]], where the film is set.
*Sitron's name is never mentioned throughout the course of the film.
*It is unknown if Sitron was aware of Hans' true evil nature throughout the film.
