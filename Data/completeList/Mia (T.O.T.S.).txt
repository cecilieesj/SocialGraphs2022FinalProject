*She owns Freddy’s stuffed monkey named Mr. Muffins. She used to own a stuffed bunny named Lady Foo Foo, until it ended up in Genie's crate and fell into a waterfall.
*She tried to make friends with Linus the lion cub, but his roar was so loud that it scared her she most likely ran back to her mother Captain Beakman after this scene.
