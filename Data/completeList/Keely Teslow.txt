'''Keely Teslow''' is [[Phil Diffy|Phil]]'s best friend, who later becomes his girlfriend.

==Personality==
Keely is an easygoing, bubbly, energetic, and smart person, though she can be a bit airheaded at times. At the beginning of the series, she is seen as being part of the popular, and perhaps, snooty crowd, yet she proves to have a sweet personality throughout the course of the series.

She says that she wants to be a cat psychologist when she grows up, yet she secretly dreams of becoming a singer. Stage fright prevents her from pursuing this dream until Phil offers the support and encouragement she needs to gain confidence. Later, she becomes interested in journalism and hopes to become a reporter.
 
==Relationships==
===Phil Diffy===
When they first meet in the pilot of the series, Keely sees him as just a nerd, someone a popular person like her would avoid. Their friendship begins when she goes to him for help with her algebra homework. A few episodes later, she is shocked to find out he's from the future, yet she proves to be trustworthy, much to the relief of the Diffys. Throughout the series, she shares awkward and affectionate moments with Phil, yet it's not until the last episode that they decide to become a couple. 

===[[Tia Deanna Fedichelli]]===
Tia is also part of the popular crowd and Keely's girl best friend. The two of them love shopping and often shop together. Keely misses her when Tia moves away at the end of Season 1.
