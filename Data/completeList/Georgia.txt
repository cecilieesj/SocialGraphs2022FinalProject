==Background==
Georgia is a very minor character so not much is known about her background. She is a friend of Tiana's, but [[Charlotte La Bouff|Charlotte]] remains as Tiana's closest friend. It is unknown how long she and her other friends have known Tiana or how they met. She does show concern for Tiana because she openly expresses her dislike on how much Tiana works and never takes a break.

===Physical appearance===
Georgia is a young woman of African-American heritage. She has a dark brown skin complexion, short dark brown hair, black eyes and she is slender in frame. She wears a magenta-colored lipstick, a magenta dress/shirt, a purple beanie with a flower accent and gold tear drop earrings.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''===
Georgia has a brief role. She appears at the restaurant at which Tiana was previously employed as a waitress. She and Tiana's other four friends offer to take her out dancing. When Tiana refuses in order to make more time to work, she expresses her concern and distaste in that Tiana overwork herself. Tiana says she might join them next time, but it later turns out Tiana has actually never danced. She and her friends are later seen eating at [[Tiana's Palace|Tiana's restaurant]].
