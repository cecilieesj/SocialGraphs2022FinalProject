==Background==
===Personality===
Like the stereotypical jock, Mel is cocky and confident in his ability to woo. He thinks little of [[Lara]]'s feelings and automatically assumes that his good looks and charm will win her over. When confronted, he is quick to anger and even quicker to defend his pride. He also turns out to be quite cowardly, since he escapes from Herman after seeing his ugly form.

===Physical appearance===
Attractive and muscular, Mel is a sturdy-bodied gazelle with a long face, thin legs, and two pronged horns. His pelt is dark brown, and he has an even darker spot on the exact center of his back, although his underbelly and the insides of his ears are paler in contrast. He has stylish, brown hair and wears a blue bow tie.

==Role in the series==
Mel first appears at Lara's birthday party, hidden inside her cake. Though he attempts to woo her, Lara declines his advances. She then sees [[Herman]] with his new handsome appearance, making Mel jealous. Shortly after this, Mel challenges Herman to a duel but escapes from him after he reveals his true ugly form. It's uncertain what became of him afterwards but it's presumed that no one wanted to be friends with him and he became poor and ugly.
