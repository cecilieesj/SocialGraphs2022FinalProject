'''Xyler and Craz''' are two teenage musicians from the fictional movie ''Dream Boy High'', and by extension characters in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''. They are part of [[Mabel Pines]]' imagination, and as such adore her and agree with whatever she has to say.

==Role in the series==
The duo first appear in "[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]", as figments of Mabel's imagination. Just as they stop at a red light in their convertible, they hear the sound of Mabel's voice. They lower their shades as they catch sight of Mabel inside an oversized hamster ball. Mabel rolls away squeaking like a hamster when the light turns green. As their shades drop, they are left amazed at what they have just seen.

Xyler and Craz appear again in the episode "[[Dreamscaperers]]". When [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] enters Stan's mind along with [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] and Mabel, they are confronted by the dream demon Bill Cipher. When Mabel claims that no one can guess what she's thinking, Bill brings Xyler and Craz into existence with a snap of his fingers. The duo joins Soos and the twins in order to stop Cipher from reaching the memory containing Stan's safe combination. When Bill Cipher becomes enraged after being foiled, he creates an area to give nightmares to Mabel, Soos, and the dream boys. When Cipher targets Xyler and Craz, he blasts them into oblivion. Shortly after, though, Mabel manages to revive the duo with a synthesizer and a drum set. The two start playing synthesized music, which Cipher can't stand in the least. As Xyler and Craz start to imagine a portal out of Stan's mind along with Soos and the twins, Cipher stops them. Just before Cipher leaves, he warns the group of [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]]. As Stan starts to awaken, Xyler and Craz bid farewell to Mabel, telling her she will see them in her dreams.

The duo makes a brief appearance in "[[The Golf War]]", during one of Mabel's fantasies. They rush into the department store dressed as paramedics. When [[Pacifica Northwest|Pacifica]] says that she's been ruined, Mabel and Xyler slap a high-five.

Xyler and Craz make their final appearance during the [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]] story arc. When Soos, Dipper, and [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] enter the Prison Bubble and wind up in Mabeland, Xyler and Craz show up to give them a tour of the place (which literally can't be rejected). When questioned about Mabel's whereabouts, the dream boys explain that she's in the highest tower, with a pair of waffle guards at the door. Xyler and Craz later appear in a courtroom as Mabel's lawyers as Dipper is put on trial for breaking the only law that states reality should never be mentioned. When Mabeland starts to become a nightmare and falls apart, Xyler and Craz have wound up in the real world with no recollection of exactly how. After emerging from a pile of confetti, they sit down on a park bench and question about their existence. The cryptogram at the end of the episode (when decoded) reveals that Xyler and Craz now work at a major children's television network, running the legal department. After the effects of Weirdmageddon are lifted, the two disappear from the real world.
