{{Quote|You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty.|[[The Emperor of China|The Emperor]] to [[Li Shang]] about Fa Mulan}}
'''Fa Mulan''' is the titular protagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1998]] animated feature film, ''[[Mulan]]''. She is the strong-willed and tenacious daughter of [[Fa Zhou|a war veteran]], who strives to uphold her family's honor. When her father is called back into battle to defend [[China]] from [[Shan Yu]], Mulan opts to protect him by taking his place under the disguise of a male soldier named '''Ping'''.

Mulan is inspired by the legendary {{WikipediaLink|Hua Mulan}}. She is the eighth official [[Disney Princess]], the only one not to be of royal lineage either by birth or marriage. She is the last Disney Princess to be developed during the [[Disney Renaissance]].

==Background==
Mulan resides in a small Chinese village with [[Fa Zhou|her father]], [[Fa Li|her mother]], and her wisecracking [[Grandmother Fa|grandmother]] (after whom Mulan takes). She also has a dog named [[Little Brother]]. As the standard of the period, Mulan is urged to uphold her family honor by adhering to the status quo set for women of the time. However, she is presented as an outcast. She is clumsy and seeks to finish her household chores by inventing contraptions to do the work in her place (much to the chagrin of her father).

As a member of the Fa family, Mulan is under the protection of the [[Fa Family Ancestors|Fa Family ancestors]] and the family guardians (which are represented by animals of the Chinese zodiac). By the end of the original ''Mulan'', Mulan's personal guardian is that of [[Mushu]], a diminutive dragon.

===Personality===
At the start of the film, Mulan is introduced as a free-spirited outcast. She is a clumsy girl who cannot follow rules, regulations, or traditions. Despite this, she has a warm heart and wants nothing more than to uphold her family's honor while keeping true to herself. Because of her society, however, this is difficult to accomplish and often brings chaos and embarrassment into her life.

The driving force of Mulan's journey is the love she has for her father. When her father is drafted to serve in the Emperor's army to defend China, Mulan steals his orders and reports to the camp in his place to protect him as well as to satisfy her desire to prove her own self-worth. She was seen having difficulties with self-confidence due to society's mistreatment towards her and the pressures of the society into which she was born - particularly in the lives of women. Early in the film, whenever she went against sexism and injustice or simply handled a situation in her own, unique way (such as shouting "Present!" when the matchmaker called her name), Mulan was greeted with anger or some form of annoyance from those around her, thus furthering her socially-awkward attitude.

During her time in camp, Mulan's personality shifts. She proves to be fierce, both physically and mentally, as well as self-reliant, impressionable, and persistent. As she learns the ways of strength and agility, she rises to the top of her class, setting an example for the men surrounding her, and soon earns their respect and friendship. Over time, Mulan gains more confidence, symbolizing her growth, as she becomes more of a mature woman by the film's third act. She can perform successful tactics through quick-thinking and mental observation instead of mere brute strength (something idealized in her camp), eventually saving her fellow soldiers and China on notable occasions. Nevertheless, she retained her humble nature, not once becoming overconfident and boastful, even after becoming a beloved heroine and receiving countless amounts of praise and respect from the very society that continuously opposed her. It wasn't until Mulan returned home and received a loving welcome from her father that she truly emoted her satisfaction over her previous successes, proving her goal, overall, was to uphold her family honor while being true to herself; this being visually and thematically represented by her relationship with her father.

The sequel shows that Mulan's personality, seen during the latter half of the first film, has remained. Mulan is a responsible young woman, seen as a fearless warrior, leader, and beloved role model among her people, both men, and women. Nevertheless, she is also fun-loving and optimistic, especially when seen with Shang, with whom she had developed a strong, romantic relationship by the start of the second film. The sequel also shows her to be rather laid-back, open-minded, and philosophical, believing in the practice of following one's heart.

===Physical appearance===
Mulan is a young tomboy of Chinese origin. She is a natural beauty, with dark brown eyes and straight, black hair that used to be long and waist-length. Later in the film, when she leaves to join the army in disguise, she cuts her hair with [[Fa Zhou|her father]]'s sword into shoulder-length and ties it up in a bun. This helps her blend into the army so that the other soldiers don't know that she's really a woman. In the second film, her hair was grown. Not to its original waist-length, but it's noticeably longer a few inches longer towards her back. In promotional works, her hair is always shown as its original length, down to the waist.

During the two films, Mulan wore a range of outfits, from beautiful Hanfus (Chinese dresses) to her soldier's getup, though her most notable outfits come from the original film; in which her promotional dress comes from, which is a simple Hanfu, which consisted of either a creamy green-yellow dress, with blue overshirt, which has green sleeves and a red band around her waist. She also sports a Kung fu-styled soldier's outfit, as well as her pink matchmaker's Hanfu and her father's armor.

Except when she goes to the matchmaker, Mulan does not wear any makeup or anything to beautify her appearance. Mulan is naturally beautiful nonetheless.

She wears a light blue tank top, short blue shorts, and is barefoot when she sleeps. She wears a dress consisting of a green long-sleeved shirt with olive brims and both a yellow skirt and inside shirt with a low cut neckline, blue wrap, red waistband, and black ballet flats, but also has been seen barefoot as well. To impress the matchmaker, she had her face painted in white, red lips, black hair tied in a loose bun with a red hair ribbon, narrow crimson and pale pink Chinese skirt, pink jacket with long, flowing sleeves, aqua and plum collar, blue wrap with a red ribbon to fasten it, light purple scarf, same color shoes, jade bead necklace, gold dangling earrings, and a special lotus flower hair pick. When she was disguised as "Ping," she has black hair tied in a bun with a teal ribbon to look like a man (when she cuts her long, beautiful hair with her father's sword into a shoulder-length), and dark green soldier armor. In the Martial Arts sequence, she had a cream suit. In the Shan Yu battle, she wore a teal dress consisting of a poet-sleeved blouse, a long olive vest with a crimson collar, a crimson belt, light pink sash, and black shoes.

===Abilities===
Although Mulan possesses no magical or superhuman powers, she has military training courtesy of Shang.

*'''Martial Arts:''' As part of her training, Mulan learned kung fu, eventually becoming proficient in hand-to-hand fighting.
*'''Swordsmanship:''' Mulan honed her skill with her father's sword and became an expert swordswoman, easily holding her own against even the battle-hardened Shan Yu.
*'''Marksmanship:''' Under Shang's tutelage, Mulan developed skill with ranged weaponry, from the bows and arrows to gunpowder cannons.
*'''Horseback riding:''' Even before her time in the army, Mulan is an excellent equestrian, further enhanced by her bond with loyal steed Khan.
*'''Strategist:''' Mulan is also intelligent, cunning, and resourceful, as shown on several occasions, such as when she was first to climb the pole and retrieve an arrow embedded in the top successfully during training. Knowing her unit was vastly outnumbered, she was able to quickly think of using the last cannon to cause an avalanche on the entire Hun army, quite literally stopping them cold, and later lure Shan Yu into Mushu's firing range. When she pulled out her fan, she acted as though she was in shock from having nothing left to fight with, when all along she planned to disarm him with it.

==Appearances==
===''[[Mulan]]''===
[[File:Mulan-disneyscreencaps.com-1528.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mulan in the original film.]]
At the start of the film, Mulan is seen rehearsing her answers for the [[The Matchmaker|Matchmaker]]'s examination (she noted the answers on her arm). Despite running late, Mulan makes it to the Matchmaker, but her time there ends in humiliating failure. Shortly after, the Emperor's counselor, [[Chi-Fu]], arrives in her village to announce that the deadly Huns, led by [[Shan Yu]], have invaded China after breaching the Great Wall, and that one man in every family must serve in the war, being conscripted into the Imperial Army to reinforce the Emperor's troops and defend the Imperial City and other communities from the Huns. Despite her protests, her father agrees to go despite his old age and disabilities. When she tries to argue with him that night for putting his life on the line for honor, Fa Zhou reprimands her and hurts her feelings, causing her to run out and weep on the Stone Dragon statue in the middle of a storm. Knowing her father would die, and knowing what she must do now to prevent it, Mulan secretly goes in his place by posing as a man, cutting her long hair with her father's sword, stealing her father's armor and riding away on her horse, [[Khan]]. That night, her journey to honor has begun. On her way to the army camp, Mulan meets [[Mushu]], a small dragon who claims to be a guardian sent to her by [[Fa Family Ancestors|her ancestors]]. He agrees to help her pass as a soldier.

[[File:Mulan-disneyscreencaps com-4832.jpg|thumb|250px|Mulan, under the guise of Ping, training alongside her fellow soldiers.]]
Though Mulan fails the army training at first, no thanks to having gotten on the bad side of the other recruits, including [[Yao, Ling, and Chien Po]], and Mushu trying to help through trickery, which only serves to anger her superior officer in Captain [[Li Shang]], she uses her intelligence and determination and becomes the first soldier to solve a puzzle set by Shang. This happens just after Shang decided that she had failed the training regiment and was not fit to serve in the Imperial Army since her lack of strength and discipline would be putting her own life and that of her fellow troops in great danger, handing her the reins of her [[Khan|horse]] and telling her to go home, especially after she got on Chi-Fu's bad side when a misfired rocket launched by her destroyed his tent, only reinforcing his belief Shang's troops would be unfit in his eyes to head to the war front. While Mulan could have done that, seeing as she had already ensured her father would not be killed in battle due to his body and old war wounds catching up to him, she attempts the first test with recovering the arrow at the top of a tall pillar again. Upon figuring out how to solve it, she is nearly to the top when the other recruits begin to wake up as dawn breaks. Seeing her efforts, they cheer her on, putting aside their earlier teasing of her, and when Shang comes out to see what is going on, he is shocked and surprised when his arrow lands at his feet, and sees that Mulan was the one who solved his puzzle. With that, he's convinced to give her another chance and allows her back into the regiment. Afterward, she rapidly progresses to become one of the best soldiers in the unit, while also giving the encouragement to the other recruits to improve as well, turning them into respectable soldiers that Shang felt were ready to see combat. She also befriends Yao, Ling, and Chien Po, three fellow soldiers, though she is forced to hide her gender. Through the machinations of Mushu, the soldiers are called to the war front. Meanwhile, after finding that the main Imperial Chinese Army, led by Shang's father [[General Li]], has been completely destroyed by the Huns, with no survivors left standing from either the General's army or the village they had been protecting from Shan Yu and the Huns, Shang leads Mulan and the other soldiers to stop them since their unit was the only defense left standing between Shan Yu and the [[Imperial City]]. Despite the unit being outnumbered after Mushu blows their cover and alerts the Huns to their position, Mulan is able to defeat the Huns by starting an avalanche and burying them by way of the last rocket in the army's munitions. She sustains an injury from Shan Yu, which results in her true gender being revealed. She is spared death, the punishment for a woman joining the army, as Shang's way of repaying the debt from Mulan rescuing him during the avalanche. Mulan is left behind by the army and prepares to return home to face humiliation. However, she discovers that Shan Yu and his five generals have survived the avalanche after it passed and are heading towards the Imperial City.

[[File:Mulan-disneyscreencaps.com-8846.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mulan facing Shan Yu during the final battle.]]
Mulan arrives first and attempts to warn Shang. However, as a woman, she is ignored by him and everyone else (after what happened previously), except for Yao, Ling, and Chien Po, and orders them to keep an eye out for Shan Yu and the surviving Huns. However, when Shan Yu reveals himself and captures the Emperor, Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien Po join her in a rescue attempt. Mulan disguises herself, Yao, Ling, and Chien Po as concubines and take out the Hun guards, allowing Shang to reach Shan Yu and the Emperor. Yao, Ling, and Chien Po escape with the Emperor just in time, but Mulan remains behind after Shang is knocked unconscious by Shan Yu. She reveals herself to the ruthless leader of the Huns as the soldier who took out most of his army, which angers Shan Yu. Shan Yu draws his sword and angrily slashes at her, tearing down portions of the palace in the process. While running from Shan Yu, she plans to kill him using fireworks. While Mushu and Cri-Kee fetch the fireworks, Mulan faces Shan Yu on the roof of the Emperor's palace. She disarms him with a paper fan and uses his own sword to pin him to the roof, allowing Mushu to launch a fireworks rocket at Shan Yu, killing him on impact with a nearby fireworks tower.

Mulan is oppressed by Chi-Fu for the final time when he arrogantly says that she is unworthy of being called a hero or being worth anything as a woman. Mulan is then confronted by the Emperor with her various crimes, having heard about them from Chi-Fu. At the same time, he acknowledges that she saved all of China and bows to her out of respect. His gesture results in all the gathered people bowing as well. The Emperor first offers Mulan a council position, then a job as consul, both of which Mulan respectfully declines, explaining that she'd much rather go back home to her family. The Emperor accepts this and gifts her with his personal crest and Shan Yu's sword. Having changed from a once gawky misfit into an honorable heroine, Mulan returns home and is able to reconcile with her father. The film's end shows Mulan inviting Shang, who had followed Mulan under the guise of returning her helmet, to dinner for he happily accepts. She is last seen thanking Mushu for his guardianship.

===''[[Mulan II]]''===
[[File:Mulan2-disneyscreencaps.com-2490.jpg|thumb|250px|Mulan in ''Mulan II''.]]
One month later, Li Shang, now promoted from Captain to General, proposes to Mulan, and they begin preparing for their wedding. However, the Emperor tasks them both with escorting his three daughters to the neighboring Chinese kingdom of Qui Gong in an attempt to form an alliance. Should the alliance fail, the Mongols would invade China just like the Huns did. Mulan and Shang ask Yao, Ling, and Chien Po to accompany them. Shang and Mulan's relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the couple has differing views on various issues, particularly on the subject of the arranged marriages the princesses are being forced into.

Meanwhile, Mushu is informed that if Mulan marries Shang, he will cease to be a guardian, instead returning to his former job of Gong Ringer. Mushu takes advantage of Mulan and Shang's differences and tries to break them up. However, Mulan soon discovers Mushu's plans when he confesses and tries to reconcile with Shang after voicing her disappointment with Mushu and how she'll never forgive him for his actions.

Before she can talk to Shang, bandits attack the group. Shang and Mulan are able to save the princesses, but are left hanging from a broken bridge. Shang chooses to sacrifice himself, as the bridge can only support one. Mulan tearfully mourns his "death" and refuses to move from the spot she is in until sunrise. Mulan and the princesses continue towards Qui Gong. Seeing that the princesses have fallen in love with Yao, Ling, and Chien Po and believing that Shang is dead, Mulan prepares to offer herself as a bride in their places. However, Shang is revealed to have survived his fall and travels to stop her. Mushu is able to fix things by masquerading as the Golden Dragon of Unity and forces the King to stop the wedding. The joyful princesses are released from their vows, and Shang and Mulan are informally married. They later hold an actual wedding at the Fa family home, although it is unknown how much time has passed since they returned from Qui Gong to the Imperial City.

At the end of the film, it is revealed that Mulan had reconciled with Mushu and has told Shang about Mushu (whom he calls the Golden Dragon of Unity), and that prompts Shang to combine the family temples, allowing Mushu to remain a family guardian, much to the disappointment of Mulan's ancestors.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:Cri-Kee, Mushu and Mulan in the House of Mouse.png|thumb|left|250px|Mulan in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Mulan makes cameos in the ''House of Mouse'' television series and the direct-to-video release ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.

In "[[The Stolen Cartoons]]", she was one of the guests to have endured [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s drastic makeover of the club.

In "[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]", she is seen amongst the crowd of Disney characters seeking [[Jiminy Cricket|Jiminy]]'s attention.

In "[[Ask Von Drake]]", Mulan was seen sitting with her father as [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Ludwig Von Drake]] make a bet to see how smart Von Drake is. Later, Mulan is seen with Mushu and Cri-Kee during the [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|headcount of all the Disney character guests]].

In "[[Salute to Sports]]", Mulan briefly appeared on stage with Donald to give a martial arts demonstration, during which, she kicks with the intent to break a wooden plank - instead, Donald is split in half.

===''[[Sofia the First]]''===
{{Quote|I think you girls are stronger than you know.|Fa Mulan to Sofia, Amber, and Jun.}}
[[File:Princesses-to-the-Rescue-4.png|thumb|250px|Mulan meeting Princess Sofia.]]
Mulan made a guest appearance in the ''Sofia the First'' episode "[[Princesses to the Rescue!]]".

While singing a song called "[[Stronger Than You Know]]", she teaches [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], [[Princess Amber|Amber]], and [[Princess Jun|Jun]] that they are stronger than they know by showing them how to cross over the moving warrior statues with vines and tells them to go on to save their beloved fathers and brothers without her.

Just like [[Ariel]] in "[[The Floating Palace]]", she does not appear in her redesign outfit. Instead, she has her much shorter shoulder-length hair and wears her father's battle armor along with her helmet and a new golden sword.

In "[[Forever Royal]]" when Sofia is battling [[Vor]] inside her [[Amulet of Avalor|amulet]], Mulan appears to Sofia in spirit form along with all the other princesses who were summoned to help Sofia in her prior times of need in, and they encourage her to be brave and strong for they all believe in her.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
{{Quote|Sometimes, your song can't start, until you go someplace... to reflect.|Fa Mulan to [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]].}}
[[File:Merida, Mulan, and Belle prepare to attack Vanellope.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mulan charging at Vanellope in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''.]]
In ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'', Mulan is a netizen resident of [[Oh My Disney]] where she and the other Disney princesses meet and greet their fans. After [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]] glitches into the princesses' dressing room to avoid the [[First Order Stormtroopers]], Mulan is seen talking with [[Merida]]. Upon mistaking Vanellope for a threat, the princesses confront her with various weapons; Mulan arms herself with her father's sword. Vanellope hastily explains that she is also a princess, lowering the defenses of Mulan and the others. Mulan, Merida, [[Anna]] and [[Moana (character)|Moana]] are the only ones who do not ask Vanellope a question to prove what kind of princess she is. She is nevertheless regarded as a princess after [[Rapunzel]] asks if people assume all of Vanellope's problems were solved by a "big, strong man", which Vanellope relates.

[[File:RBTI - Casual Princesses (8).png|thumb|250px|Mulan and Elsa in their comfy clothes.]]
After admiring Vanellope's "gown" the princesses change into more casual outfits to match, courtesy of [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s [[mice]]. Mulan wears a red-and-cream bomber jacket with golden dragons that resemble Mushu with a white top underneath, black jeans, white socks and red-and-white sneakers, and is seen lounging on a beanbag chair. While conversing, the princesses teach Vanellope about the correlation between singing and a princess's dream. Vanellope sings about wanting a steering wheel to fix her video game ''[[Sugar Rush]]'', but her talents are lackluster. Mulan comments that she was a little "pitchy", but explains that sometimes a princess's song can't start until she goes somewhere to reflect. [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]] adds to this by claiming some princesses find their song by finding a form of water and staring at it; Mulan references that [[Reflection|she stares at the horse trough at home]], without enthusiasm.

In the climax of the film, Mulan and the princesses see [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] about to fall to his death from the Google tower and work together to save him. After [[Snow White]] tosses a [[Poisoned Apple]] to [[Belle]] who uses her book as a baseball bat to hit it to Mulan, who then chops it into four slices with her sword to release Belle, [[Ariel]], Cinderella, and [[Tiana]]'s discarded dresses tied to [[Rapunzel]]'s [[Rapunzel's Magic Hair|magic hair]]. After Ralph is saved, the princesses introduce themselves as friends of Vanellope and befriend Ralph as well.

===Other appearances===
In ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', Mulan is featured on a poster in [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s bedroom. Also, a Chinese restaurant called "Mulan Wok" can be seen in the town.

In the animated mini-series ''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]'', Mulan makes a brief non-speaking cameo in the episode "Just One Moon".

Mulan was slated to star in the second installment of the ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales'' series of DVDs with [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]. However, the film was canceled due to poor sales of the first installment.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 5x09 - The Bear King - Photography - Mulan.jpg|thumb|250px|Mulan in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
A live-action version of Mulan is a character of the popular [[ABC]] series ''Once Upon a Time''. She is played by actress [[Jamie Chung]] and holds a major recurring role in the series. Before the Dark Curse was cast, Mulan served in the army of the Emperor of her native land, and she proves herself in battle.

Later Mulan encounters [[Belle]] outside the den of the Yaoguai in her home Empire. Belle lures the creature out of its lair, but it attacks and Belle runs from it. Mulan then fires an arrow at the beast, making it run away. She then goes to Belle but berates her for scaring the beast and ruining her chance of killing the Yaoguai and saving her village. She storms off into the woods, telling Belle that the best way she can help is to stay out of her way. When Belle is later accosted in Mulan's village by her former traveling companions, Mulan attacks and drives them away, saving Belle in the process, but receiving a wound to her leg. When Belle inquires as to why Mulan saved her, Mulan tells her that Belle was able to find the Yaoguai and track it in a matter of hours, while it had taken her months to do so. She asks Belle to help her track the beast, and then Mulan will kill it. Belle agrees. As they go after the Yaoguai, Mulan discovers that her injury to her leg is worse than she thought, and tells Belle that it is up to her to go and defeat the Yaoguai. Belle at first refuses, but after Mulan encourages her takes the sword and goes after the Yaoguai. After turning the Yaoguai back into [[Prince Phillip]], Belle goes to Mulan and introduces the two of them. Belle decides to go back to [[Rumplestiltskin]] and leaves the two of them behind and thus starting their friendship.

Later at some point, Mulan joined Prince Phillip on his journey to find [[Aurora|Princess Aurora]] (played by Sarah Bolger). They were on the journey when [[the Evil Queen]] cast the Dark Curse. However, the area that they were in was spared by the curse merely freezing them in time for 28 years. When [[Emma Swan]] broke the Dark Curse in [[Storybrooke]], they continued their journey.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x01 - Broken - Aurora, Phillip and Mulan.png|thumb|left|250px|Mulan with [[Prince Phillip]] and [[Aurora]].]]
Mulan is present when Phillip awakens Aurora with True Love's Kiss, but the reunion is cut short when a [[Wraith (Once Upon a Time)|Wraith]] appears in the palace. Phillip fights the creature, yet is unwillingly marked by the gold medallion it wore. Mulan explains that the Wraith sucks the souls of its victims. Upon realizing this, Phillip goes to sacrifice himself leaving Mulan and Aurora behind. Mulan figures out what he's up to and goes to stop him, but is followed by Aurora. The two women confront each other with Aurora stating that Mulan has feelings for him as well. Mulan simply denies this, stating although she and Phillip fought side-by-side together many times, she has no romantic feelings for him. The two discover Phillip and his soul is sucked by the Wraith in front of Mulan and Aurora. The women carry Phillip's seemingly dead body back to the palace where Aurora slept. It is there Mulan explains to Aurora what happened while she slept. They hear a noise and find Emma Swan and her biological mother [[Snow White|Mary Margaret Blanchard]] under a pile of rubble. Thinking that they were the reason for the Wraith's appearance she and Aurora take them as prisoners to a safe haven where the survivors of the curse are gathered.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x02 - We Are Both - Mulan, Emma and Mary Margaret.png|thumb|250px]]
Emma and Mary Margaret are thrown into the pit. Mulan is seen talking to Aurora about [[Lancelot]] and then Aurora tells Mulan that she does not trust Emma and Mary Margaret. Mulan warns Aurora not to confuse vengeance with justice. Later, she is seen giving Emma and Mary Margaret weapons for their journey to The Castle. In the woods, Mulan tells the two women that they will make a camp and that they need to get fire and water. When Mary Margaret makes a fire, Aurora attacks her and the two start arguing. Mulan appears and tells Mary Margaret to not talk to Aurora like that and that she will deal with Aurora. Emma appears and fires a gun to try to protect Mary Margaret but has instead summoned ogres. The group splits up and Mary Margaret saves Emma from an ogre. Later on, Mulan tells Aurora to keep up and that it is her own fault that she is not dressed for the woods as she was told to stay in the safe haven. Emma takes pity on Aurora and gives her her jacket. When the group arrives at the castle, Mulan informs Mary Margaret that she and Aurora will keep guard at the gate. The two later go into the castle to rescue Mary Margaret and Emma from [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]], who was disguised as Lancelot. Mulan tells the others that she cannot believe she was fooled by the shapeshifter and is not sure about what to tell the survivors once they got back. Mary Margaret tells her that she should tell them the truth, that Lancelot died a heroic death. Mulan then suggests Mary Margaret becomes the new leader. Mary Margaret says that she appreciates it but cannot as she has to get home to Storybrooke with Emma and Mulan and Aurora agree to help the two.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x05 - The Doctor - Emma, Mulan, Aurora and Mary Margaret.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
When the four women return to their camp, Mulan is horrified to see that all of her fellow residents were killed, seemingly by Cora ripping everyone's hearts from their bodies. Aurora discovers [[Captain Hook]] beneath a pile of bodies, and Hook attempts to deceive the four of them by stating he survived Cora's attack on the camp by hiding under some dead bodies. Mulan is not buying his story and ties Hook to a tree with Emma's help and begins to walk away with the women. Hook then reveals his true identity as a shocked Mary Margaret pulls his hook out of his satchel. He states that he was working with Cora, but will now join forces with Emma and her team. Emma then cuts him free. He leads them to a giant beanstalk stretching up into the sky, with Mulan pointing a sword at his back, stating that there is a magical compass at the top, but first, they must deal with the giant. At the base of the beanstalk, Mulan insists that she should be the one to climb the beanstalk, stating she is the most experienced warrior of the four women. However, Emma overrules her but takes her aside before climbing the beanstalk. She asks Mulan about the strength of her sword, and Mulan states that it is the strongest sword in the land. Emma then asks Mulan that if she is not back in 10 hours, if Mulan will cut the beanstalk down and make sure that Mary Margaret gets back to Storybrooke. Mulan agrees and then provides Emma with ground poppy in order to knock the Giant unconscious. After Emma and Hook set off, Mulan then draws a line in the sand and sticks a stick in the sand at the end, saying to the other two women it is a way to keep track of the watches each of them should have. When it reaches ten hours, Mulan takes her sword and deals a heavy blow to the beanstalk. She is then tackled by an infuriated Mary Margaret who demands to know what she is doing. Mulan states that it is her daughter's wish. Just then, Emma jumps off the beanstalk, so Mulan does not need to cut the beanstalk down.

In the [[Enchanted Forest]], Mulan is present when Aurora awakens from her dream. Before she can talk to Aurora, zombies attack the encampment, and Mulan runs off with Aurora in another direction, leaving Mary Margaret and Emma behind to face the zombies. Mulan and Aurora encounter more zombies in the forest, and when Mulan is tackled by one, the other two manage to grab Aurora and get away with her. Mulan beheads the zombie she is being rushed by and then encounters Emma and Mary Margaret and informs them that the zombies got away with Aurora. Mary Margaret then states that she must be put back to sleep in order to contact [[Henry Mills|Henry]], and Mulan reluctantly tells them that in order to do that, they need more Ground Poppy Dust. She tells them that there is a little poppy growing nearby, and from that, she can create the dust needed. As they are hacking their way through the forest with Mulan leading, a raven swoops onto Mary Margaret's shoulder. It communicates to her that if the magical compass is not given to Cora by sundown, then something will happen to Aurora. Immediately Mulan demands the compass from Emma, and when Emma does not give it freely moves to physically take it from her. Emma and Mary Margaret convince her to allow them till sundown to contact Henry and come up with a plan. If that does not work, then they will give the compass to Mulan so she can rescue Aurora. Mulan reluctantly agrees and leads them to the poppy, where she cuts it and crushes it with her dagger. She then blows the powder into Mary Margaret's face, putting her to sleep. When Mary Margaret wakes up, she and Emma discover that Mulan has taken the compass and run. Mulan is then shown running through the forest, but is stopped when Mary Margaret fires an arrow at her to halt her in her tracks. Mulan turns to face them and a distraught Mary Margaret demands the compass. When Mulan refuses, she tackles Mulan and pulls an arrow out of her quiver and presses it against Mulan's neck. Mulan still refuses to give them the compass, saying that they will have to kill her first. Mary Margaret raises the arrow just as Aurora comes around a tree and tells Mary Margaret to stop. Aurora then tells them all that occurred and asks what they are going to do next. Mulan asks if she is okay before they follow Mary Margaret and Emma.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x09 - Queen of Hearts - Aurora and Mulan.jpg|thumb|250px]]
As the group arrives at Rumplestiltskin's cell in the ruins of the palace, Mulan uses her torch to search the cell for any sign of the squid ink. After Aurora finds Rumplestiltskin's note, Mulan finds a small empty glass vial, although it may have contained ink at one point. They are then entrapped in the cell by Cora and Hook, and Cora reveals that she has Aurora's heart in her possession. After Cora and Hook leave, Mulan apologizes to Aurora for allowing Cora to get her heart. Soon after, Mary Margaret uses the squid ink in the note written by Rumplestiltskin to open the cell and allows the group to escape. At Aurora's insistence that she cannot be trusted due to Cora holding her heart, Mulan reluctantly ties her to the remnants of the jail cell. At Lake Nostros, the group arrives to find Hook and Cora about to jump through the portal to Storybrooke. Mulan, Emma, and Mary Margaret immediately attack. Mulan can battle Cora using her sword and can deflect her magic with the blade. As Mulan moves to attack Cora, Cora vanishes in a puff of smoke, and Aurora's heart nearly falls into the portal when Hook reaches out and grabs it, tossing it to Mulan. After Emma knocks Hook out, Mary Margaret tells Mulan to go and give Aurora back her heart. Mulan gives Mary Margaret her sword, saying it will deflect Cora's magic before running back to the palace ruins. She is able to put Aurora's heart back in her chest. Aurora then tells Mulan that Cora told her that Phillip may be able to be revived, and the two friends set off to recover his soul.

At some point in their quest, though through unknown means, they managed to recover Phillip's soul and revived him. The three later appear in the season finale, where they find [[Neal Cassidy]] unconscious on the beach outside the Enchanted Forest. They take him back to the palace and tend to his injuries as Mulan keeps a close watch on the stranger. Upon awakening, she asks who he is, to which the man responds with his name, Neal. Her companions, Aurora and Prince Phillip, rush over to inspect the stranger. Hastily, Aurora helps to bring water to him while Neal wonders where this is. She tells him he is in their kingdom, and further questioning prompts Prince Phillip to tell Neal they are in the Enchanted Forest. Shocked, Neal murmurs he is back, which causes Aurora to think he's a native of this land, but Mulan points out his clothes are foreign and similar to Emma and Mary Margaret's. At the mention of Emma's name, Neal realizes they are acquainted with her as well, and tries to explain he needs to save Emma from harm. In attempting to move from the bier, Neal struggles to sit up as his wound is not yet completely healed, but despite that, he is set on finding out if Emma and Henry are alright. Aurora queries if Neal is Henry's father, and goes on to fill him in on how she once met Henry in the Netherworld. She mentions having harnessed the power to walk the dream world and find others like her, and it's possible to find Henry. Neal asks if she can find Emma to let her know he is alive.

Assuming a laying spot on the bier, Aurora attempts to find Emma or Henry in the dream world. While Prince Phillip watches over her, Mulan and Neal wait at the sidelines and converse. Mulan learns Neal assumed death was imminent after falling into the portal, and from focusing his thoughts on the Enchanted Forest, that's how he ended up here. Curious about the other world, Storybrooke, she asks what it's like there. Neal starts off by saying people of that land believe the Enchanted Forest inhabitants to be fictional and exemplifies it with the ''Mulan'' animated film. Confused, she inquires what a film is, but the exchange is interrupted by Aurora's awakening.

Crestfallen, Aurora notifies Neal she was unable to make contact. However, Neal recalls his father always had plans and could have left something behind if he ever returned to the Enchanted Forest. He hopes to find such an item and use it to get to Emma and Henry by traveling to his father's castle. Prince Phillip raises the question of who his father is, and Neal admits it's Rumplestiltskin.

Mulan and Neal go on foot towards the castle. Wishing to learn more about Neal's relationship with Emma, she asks why Emma never mentioned him before. Neal confesses he broke Emma's heart by letting her go to fulfill the breaking of the Dark Curse, and after it was finished, fear of rejection kept him from coming back to her. Mulan remarks that his belief in love wasn't strong enough to overcome rejection, which Neal says is the greatest regret of his life.

Through a brief search, Neal finds his father's old cane, which he uses to reveal a hidden door in the castle. From within, Neal discovers a crystal ball. Reluctantly, he agrees magic is the only thing that can help him now and attempts to get the ball to activate by touching it, which causes no change. Mulan suggests thinking about how he feels about Emma, and that will guide him to see her.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 3x03 - Quite a Common Fairy - Mulan and Aurora.png|thumb|left|250px|Mulan and Aurora.]]
Afterward, Neal devised a plan to get to Neverland: he will use Robin Hood's son, Roland, to lure the shadow to the castle while they and Mulan lie and wait. After it appears to have failed, their plan works, and the shadow arrived for Roland. Robin managed to hold on to his son long enough for Neal to grab the shadow, and Mulan managed to force it to back off and fly back to Neverland, successfully taking Neal with it. Later, Robin Hood thanks Mulan for her help and offers her to join his band of Merry Men. Mulan appreciates the offer but urgently has to talk to someone first before it's too late. Knowingly, Robin Hood believes she means a loved one, though she smiles and replies only time will tell. She rushes to the palace to approach Aurora. After making sure they are alone, Mulan announces that she has news to share. Coincidentally, so does Aurora, who excitedly confirms she and Prince Phillip are expecting their first child. Mulan reacts with shock but quickly congratulates her. Recovering from her stupor, Mulan changes her mind about what she wanted to say and hastily states her intent to join Robin Hood's band of Merry Men. Leaving abruptly, Mulan turns to walk away with a saddened expression on her face. Later that night, Mulan arrives at the Merry Men's campsite and is greeted by Robin Hood, unaware that he's the man with the lion tattoo that Tinkerbell tried to have Regina meet back in the Enchanted Forest.

Sometimes later, Mulan became a bodyguard for hire, though it is unclear whether she is still a part of Robin's Merry Men. On one of her duty, she was assigned to protect [[King Fergus]]' daughter, [[Merida]], for Clan [[DunBroch]]'s upcoming war with the Northern Invaders. However, she's actually tasked by Fergus to keep Merida from going into battle with him. By the time they arrived at the battlefield, the clan, and the invaders were already fighting each other. They spotted a knight coming towards Fergus with a sword, but despite Merida's effort to stop him, Fergus was killed.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 5x09 - The Bear King - Merida and Mulan.jpg|thumb|250px|Mulan and Merida facing Zelena and Arthur.]]
Two years later, old turmoils have taken its toll on Mulan, leaving her cold and callous. She now works to collect money debts from people for her employer, until Merida found and ask her for help. Returning to the site of the old battlefield, the two had found a piece of cloak from the knight who killed Fergus. However, before they can continue their investigation, they were confronted by [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]] and [[Arthur Pendragon|King Arthur]]. During her search in the old witch's hut, Mulan encounters a wolf inside. Right away, she knows the wolf's identity, and after knocking over a nearby cauldron, the smoke engulfed it and revert it back to none other than [[Little Red Riding Hood|Ruby]]. With her help, Mulan and Merida found out that Arthur is the knight who killed Fergus. As Merida faces off against Arthur, Mulan and Ruby battle Zelena. After defeating the two, Mulan and Ruby stopped by Fergus' grave to bid Merida farewell. Though Mulan admits that she is too late admit her feelings for her lost love, she is still not over it. So Ruby encourages her to join her to find other werewolves like her as a way to heal from past wounds, which she accepts.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 5x18 - Ruby Slippers - Ruby, Mulan and Dorothy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mulan with Ruby and Dorothy on their way to Oz.]]
Together with Ruby, Mulan aided her friend in her journey to find her pack. Their search took them into the woods near [[Land of Oz|Oz]], which Ruby is familiar with, and where they encountered [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and her dog [[Toto]]. After they informed Dorothy of where they're heading, the three spotted a green cyclone, which Dorothy realized that Zelena has returned. Zelena holds Toto hostage and demands the silver slippers from the three to reunite with her daughter, in exchange for Toto's safety. To save Toto, Mulan creates a concoction that can put Zelena to sleep, but she needs poppies to complete the brew, which Ruby and Dorothy managed to acquire while having just escaped a pursuit from a couple of Zelena's flying monkeys. After completing the brew, Mulan gives it to Dorothy. As Dorothy retires to her tent to rest for the night, Ruby confides with Mulan about Dorothy's reaction at seeing her turning into a wolf. At first, Ruby worried about Dorothy's rejection, until Mulan encourages her not to hold back, as she doesn't want Ruby to make the same mistake she made.

Later, Mulan and the munchkins from Oz found Dorothy placed under a sleeping curse by Zelena. They stand vigil until Ruby returns. Using the silver slippers, Ruby and Mary Margaret were transported from the Underworld to Oz, where the former managed to save Dorothy with true love's kiss, waking her up and breaking the curse. After admitting their feelings for each other, Ruby and Dorothy seal their blossoming romance with a kiss as Mulan, Mary Margaret, and the Munchkins happily look on.

[[File:Mulan (2020 film) (8).png|thumb|250px|Liu Yifei as Mulan.]]
{{Quote|Loyal, brave, and true. It is my duty to protect my family.|Mulan risking her life to protect her family}}
Liu Yifei portrays Mulan in a live-action adaptation of the Disney animated film. In this version of the film, which is closer to the original legend, the character is known as Hua Mulan. Much like the original film, Mulan is a young woman who runs away from her home in order to serve the Chinese army. She uses the alias Hua Jun while pretending to be a boy and is the first soldier to carry two buckets of water up a mountain without spilling any. She exposes herself when in battle she had to take off her armor, to properly use her chi powers.

In this version, Mulan has a younger sister named [[Hua Xiu]]. She also has a strong chi within her unlike her animated counterpart who is just an ordinary girl.

In the village at the Imperial City, Mulan, as a little girl, chases a chicken back to its coop across the village, accidentally breaking a wing from a phoenix statue. After successfully doing so, she notices her father Hua Zhou staring at her for the mess she did in the village. At home, Hua Xiu helps Mulan take care of her hair. Hua Li then asks her husband Hua Zhou to know about the Matchmaker who would help her find a good husband. Outside, Hua Zhou and her daughter are repairing the broken statue of the phoenix. He asks his daughter why the phoenix sits at the shrine entrance, to which he explains that the phoenix is the emissary for their ancestors. Hua Zhou then tells the myth of the phoenix to his daughter, to which he explains to Mulan that the phoenix can still protect her even when the wing of the statue of herself is broken. Zhou asks him that chi is for warriors, not daughter, telling her it is time for her to hide her gift away. He then asks Mulan to bring honor to the family to make her family proud.

Mulan rides her horse Black Wind, passing by two rabbits following her back to the Imperial City to return home just as her mother Hua Li explains that the Matchmaker has found a promising match for her. Upon meeting the Matchmaker who would help find a promising match for her, the meeting was not successful as it was caused by a spider rejecting her to cause dishonor to her family. Later, the Hua family receives messages from the Chancellor at the Imperial City that the Rourans have invaded China, explaining that every man must contribute to the fight. Mulan then disguises herself as a man to help fight against the Rourans.

As Mulan talks to her father about the phoenix, he explains that the phoenix has followed him to battle and that she will protect him when he goes to battle. Hua Zhou also explains that to face her fears, she must be courageous to honor her family. Hua Zhou leaves just as Mulan looks at his sword, reading the inscription translating as "Loyal, brave, true". To conquer her fear and help prepare for battle, Mulan studies it just before leaving, just as Hua Zhou tells the ancestors to send in the phoenix to protect her during battle.

Far away from the Imperial City, the phoenix arrives to help protect Mulan from danger. Mulan (disguised as "Hua Jun") arrives in an army camp, where she encounters Commander Tung, who tells Mulan that there is no fighting tolerated at the camp. He then asks Mulan to know who she is, to which Mulan explains that she is "Hua Jun, son of Hua Zhou". The next day, Mulan trains with the other soldiers being commanded by Sergeant Qiang. After a tough training, Mulan later showers herself at a lake to clean herself, just as Chen Honghui talks with her about him being equal to her in fighting against the Rourans. The next day, Sergeant Qiang arrives and tells Mulan to report to Commander Tung, who explains that Hua Zhou, her father, is a great warrior who focused on his chi and masters it carefully just as Mulan learns the power of chi. During training, Mulan and the rest of the warriors follow what the inscription on Hua Zhou's sword says in order to fight against the Rouran army and later confesses with Commander Tung about three virtues she should have.

Later, when the Rourans arrive, Mulan participates in the battle against Böri Khan and his Rouran army just as she rides on Black Wind during battle to which far away from the Rourans, the witch Xianniang arrives and confronts and engages in battle and attacks her while the Imperial soldiers continue fighting the Rourans in the battlefield. Seeing the inscription on Hua Zhou's sword and removing the projectile Xianniang threw at her, she then sees the phoenix far from her, and upon reading the inscription again, Mulan rides on Black Wind and decides to return to the army (though removing her "Hua Jun" disguise armor) just as she arrives at the battlefield to which during battle, a Rouran throws a spear at her just as Mulan uses the power of chi to counter the attack which lands back at the Rouran. She then notices the Imperial army attacked by Xianniang, who transformed into thousands of blackbirds, attacking the Emperor's army and planning to help her army. Mulan fires an arrow at a Rouran soldier just as the Rourans prepare to attack. One of the Rourans fires a flaming boulder at the snowy peaks, causing an avalanche to engulf the Rourans just as Mulan escorts Qiang, Honghui, and the rest of the army out of the avalanche's path.

Mulan survives the avalanche, while Commander Tung tells Sergeant Qiang that the enemy was defeated. Hua Mulan tells Qiang and Tung to forgive him, but they found out that "Hua Jun" was actually Mulan in disguise. After finding out that "Hua Jun" was actually Mulan in disguise, Mulan ends up receiving penalties for breaking Qiang's rule, as she is banished from the army. Mulan, alone, remembers what Xianniang explained to her that she can never return home for disgracing someone, just as Mulan faces her. Xianniang explains to Mulan to merge the path with her just as she explains that Böri Khan has survived the avalanche and has taken over the Imperial City, to which Mulan must stop him before the Emperor falls. Mulan rides on Black Wind to return to alert Commander Tung that Böri Khan has survived the avalanche and has started attacking the Imperial City. Mulan convinces Tung to believe in her, even though she was banished from the army to which they refused to believe in her at first but ended gaining faith upon trusting Mulan's warning just as the army decides to follow Mulan to the Imperial City to find Böri Khan and stop him from killing the Emperor.

During the ambush, Mulan fights against a couple of Rourans along with the Imperial army. Just as she closes the door so no Rourans can burst into the palace, Mulan tries to ask the Emperor about a warning she told, only to find Xianniang on his throne. As Xianniang transforms into a falcon, Mulan chases her as the Imperial army continues fighting against the Rourans. Arriving at the guards' post where Böri Khan is, Mulan notices Xianniang dying at the hands of the Rouran leader. Mulan engages in a duel with Böri Khan, but loses the sword she is using into molten lava. The phoenix then guides Mulan to fight against him in a duel, while Mulan cuts a rope for Böri Khan to fall off a platform. While Mulan frees the Emperor, Böri Khan has survived and prepares to fire an arrow at her, but the Emperor catches it as he and Mulan work together to throw the arrow back at Böri Khan, killing him.

With the Rourans defeated and their leader dead, the Imperial City celebrates the victory of the Imperial army against the Rourans as an esteemed guest talks to the Emperor, introducing Hua Mulan to him. The Emperor praises her for her heroism for saving his life from Böri Khan and saving the Imperial City from danger. Mulan then pledges an oath to be loyal, brave, and true just as she returns to her family in devotion.

Mulan meets Chen Honghui, who hasn't bid his farewell to Mulan yet, just as Mulan bids Honghui a farewell before leaving for her family. She rides on Black Wind again to return to her family's home, just as she reunites with her family once again together. Mulan then forgives her father for stealing his horse Black Wind, his sword, and his armor, just as she explains to her father that she lost the sword during battle. As the Imperial army arrives, Mulan is presented with a new sword for saving the dynasty from the Rourans for bringing honor to her ancestors, her village, and her family. Mulan receives the sword with the inscription reading "loyal, brave, and true" followed by "devotion to the family" written on it just as Mulan has brought honor to her family for saving China for her bravery, just as she is praised by everyone who Mulan met for bringing honor to them.

===Redesign===
[[File:Mulan.16.png|right|250px]]
Mulan received multiple changes in her late [[2012]] redesign.

Mulan's face was elongated very slightly and is no longer as rounded as it used to be. The epicanthic folds by her eyes have also been sharpened a bit to give them a more narrow appearance. Her body type was also changed to a more hourglass shape from her original androgynous figure in the film.

Mulan wears an elaborate, bejeweled gold hair clip, and her now waist-length hair is long and flowing. The material used in her Hanfu dress is metallic-looking in appearance and texture and still sports the same color as her old appearance. In early redesigns, her dress is more reddish with sparkles. Much of her black hair is loose and down instead of having the hair clip.

Her face and the other visible parts of her skin appear to be whitened with powder, with her cheeks touched with rouge and her lips painted red, somewhat resembling a more traditional Chinese bride.

Other early redesigns included her dress being bright gold and dark red instead of green, blue, and yellow.

===[[Palace Pets]]===
Mulan's Palace Pets are Blossom, Lychee, Plumdrop, Alora, Snowpaws, and Chai.

==Differences from the source material==
*Fa Mulan is based on the character Hua Mulan from the Chinese legend. Much like [[Arthur Pendragon]] and [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]], the legend has been immortalized in several poems and ballads, and doesn't have a single author. The Disney animated film made some changes to the legend.
*Mulan's surname is spelled using the Mandarin pronunciation for "花", which is "Hua". Disney uses the spelling for the Cantonese pronunciation. Thought in different forms of the poem, her last name has been changed but 'Hua' is the most popular. The live action version uses the Hua surname.
*In the Ming dynasty play ''Mulan Joins the Army'' and the Qing dynasty novel ''Fierce and Filial'', she takes the name of her aged father "Hua Hu".<ref>[https://mulanbook.com/pages/ming/mulan_joins_the_army_xu_wei Mulan Joins the Army by Xu Wei]</ref> In the Qing dynasty novel ''Biography of Extraordinary Mulan'', she goes by "Mulan" while masquerading as a man.<ref>[https://mulanbook.com/pages/qing/biography_of_extraordinary_mulan Biography of Extraordinary Mulan]</ref>
*According to the Ming dynasty play ''Mulan Joins the Army'', Mulan had a young sister named Munan and a younger brother named Hua Fang (nicknamed Yaoer).<ref>[https://mulanbook.com/pages/overview/questions_about_mulans_legend_and_history Questions about Mulan’s Legend and History, Answered]</ref> Mulan does have a younger sister in the live action version.
*Mulan was already well versed in archery, swordsmanship, spearmanship, bojutsu, martial arts, and various other forms of hand-to-hand combat; being taught the increasingly numerous and highly useful trades of self-defense from her father.
*In the Qing dynasty novel ''Fierce and Filial'', she left home to battle in the Wei army at the age of seventeen, and returned home twelve years later at the age of twenty-nine.<ref>[https://mulanbook.com/pages/qing/fierce_and_filial Fierce and Filial by Zhang Shaoxian]</ref>
*Mulan gained high merit in her twelve years of fighting as a woman but refused any reward and advisory jobs working for the Emperor that would make her and family prosperously wealthy and rich beyond her dreams. She had desired to return home to take care of her dear father whom she had not seen in twelve long years.
*Hua Mulan had no sense of awkwardness and fits seamlessly into society whether she is a feminine woman or disguised as a masculine man.
*Mulan actually liked wearing makeup and wearing feminine hairstyles and opted to wear them after returning home from war.
*Mulan's identity as a woman was never revealed while in service. Shortly after returning home, her fellow warrior comrades who had served with her came to visit. Though they were stunned to see an extremely beautiful woman instead, and then learned the truth about their good friend and general, they praised her for all she had done for them.
*Mulan was asked to be a concubine/lover to the Emperor in the Qing dynasty novel ''Romance of Sui and Tang'', but she denied this offer and instead took her own life before she was charged.

==Trivia==
*Mulan is the only [[Disney Princess]] to be of East Asian descent.
*Her pink bridal outfit is very often confused for a ''kimono'' (Japanese), but is actually the Chinese garment ''hanfu''.
*Mulan is the first Disney Princess to technically not be royalty―she wasn't born a princess nor did she marry a prince.
*Mulan is the last Disney Princess to be introduced in the 20th century.
*Mulan spends most of the time in her training uniform, her battle armor, or her blue infiltration dress, while in the merchandise, she is shown mostly in her "normal" dress or her pink matchmaker dress.
*Mulan is the second Disney Princess to have both parents alive and present during the entire film, the first being [[Aurora]] in [[1959]] and the third being [[Rapunzel]] in [[2010]], [[Merida]] being the fourth in [[2012]], and [[Moana (character)|Moana]] being the fifth in [[2016]].
*Mulan means "magnolia blossom" in Chinese. It could also mean "wood orchid".
*While her name is "Fa Mulan" in the Disney film, in the actual Chinese legend her name is "Hua Mulan", though they are both pronounced similarly (Fa being Cantonese). Her name is "Hua Mulan" in the live action version.
*In the Chinese dub, when giving her fake name to ''Li Shang'', she states her full name is Hua Ping. ''Hua Ping'' translates directly as ''Flower Vase'', and is modern Chinese slang for a feminine gay man. This is adapted into the Chinese dub so that when ''Ping'' is introduced, the others think he is a feminine gay man, and use that as the basis as to why 'he' tries, and fails, to be manly.
*Mulan is depicted holding some objects as if she were left-handed, but is seen using the sword in her right hand, so she may be ambidextrous.
*Originally, the screenwriters planned to have Mulan join the army to get out of her society. Though the way she feels about society is still present in the film, it is not made to be the main point. She seemed selfish and unlikable that way, so screenwriters stuck to the traditional way of her saving her father.
*[[Tia Carrere]], who later voiced [[Nani Pelekai]] in ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', was considered for the role of Mulan. In fact, Lea Salonga (her singing voice) was considered, but her voice wasn't low enough for Ping before [[Ming-Na Wen]] was found.
*Mulan was featured in the 100th issue of ''[[Disney Adventures Magazine]]''.
*When Mulan disguises herself as a man, her eyelashes and double eyelid disappear and her eyebrows grow thicker, but when she dresses feminine, her eyelashes grow back, her double eyelid comes in again, but her eyebrows remain thick.
*In the original film, Mulan cut her hair to disguise as a man before heading off into the army. This is despite the fact as Chinese men usually kept their hair long just like the long-haired Chinese women back in Ancient China when the original film took place.
*Mulan touches her hair a lot because animators noticed that Ming-Na Wen did.
*Mulan is, by far, the Disney character (hero or villain) with the highest body count ever. The production team had drawn 2,000 Hun soldiers during the Huns' attack sequence, along with 2,000 more horses. Only six Huns survived to the avalanche and only one of them (Shan Yu) is killed later. This makes Mulan's final body count to 3,994 (Shan Yu is killed by Mushu, rather than Mulan, and not a single horse survived).
*Mimi Chan did the motion capture for Mulan's martial arts moves.
*In the Disney Princess line-up and dolls, Mulan is often shown as being more tanned than the others besides Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Tiana. However, in the new [[2013]] type line-up and their merchandise, Mulan is shown as the palest one, when it should have been [[Snow White]].
*In the Special Edition DVD audio commentary, it is said that though [[Mark Henn]] is her animator, [[Chris Sanders]] ([[Little Brother]]'s animator, who later created and voiced [[Stitch]]) was the one who mastered her quirky personality.
*Mulan is often noted in an audio commentary that she uses her mind to solve problems and with the learning at the camp can use a combination of strength and intelligence.
*In the deleted part of "[[Reflection]]", Mulan says, "they want a docile lamb, no one knows who I am," which is true throughout the first film and sometimes between scenes of Qui Gong and Mulan's marriage in the second film, she claims to have told Li Shang everything.
*The recoloring of Mulan's redesign may be due to the fact that red and gold were often considered by the Chinese as the colors of communism or because in ancient China, the royal color was gold and red was the color of luck and prosperity.
*All of Mulan's dresses in the first film had a blue bodice and a red sash.
*Mulan sings a remix of another song in the play, ''Mulan Jr.'' called "Written in Stone". She also sings a remix of "Keep 'Em Guessing".
*On the cover of ''Mulan II'', Mushu is holding a ring (probably an engagement ring), but it is never seen in the film nor given to Mulan, possibly due to Chinese marriage traditions.
*Her side of the yin and yang necklace is the yang side, associated with masculinity.
*Although Mulan cuts her hair, it remains long in the [[Disney Princess]] merchandise.
*Mulan is shown in several deleted scenes in which one she is daydreaming of how she wants to demonstrate her adventurous/tomboyish spirit.
*Mulan's curtain has white ducks or swans on it.
*Mulan, Moana, and [[Raya]] are the only princesses not to have celebrities pose as them for the [[Disney Dream Portrait Series]].
*Ironically enough, Mulan's voice actress, Ming-Na Wen, made a cameo appearance in the 2020 remake of the film where she portrays an esteemed guest introducing Mulan to the Emperor which is seen at the end of the film, making Wen the only actress from the original 1998 film to participate in the remake, though as a different character.
