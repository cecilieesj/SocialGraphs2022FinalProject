'''Dad''' is a character who appears in the [[2018]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated short, ''[[Bao]]''.

==Background==
Dad lives in Toronto, Canada with his wife Mom. Being a worker, he is shown to have a watch to use time management correctly as well as a briefcase which he uses to take for work. Whenever he checks his watch and notices he is late, he punctually leaves his family's house to get to work.

Later when he notices his wife crying as the whole sequence turns out to be a dream, Dad introduces his real son to Mom telling him to talk to his mother to which as the two reconcile with each other, Dad happily watches his son being taught how to make dumplings just like what Mom does.

==Role in the short==
Dad is first seen at the beginning of the short where he is seen watching TV while his wife gives him a basket of dumplings for his lunch. As he begins eating lunch, he realizes that he has to go to work so he takes his briefcase with him just as his wife continues to finish her lunch only for the last dumpling she is about to eat to come to life.

Later, Dad sees his wife crying with no son to take care of as the sequence between Mom and Dumpling's relationship was just a dream in which Dad tells his wife that her son is there to meet her. As the mother's real son arrives, he tells him to talk to her to know where he went. Later after Mom happily reunites with her real son, Dad happily watches the real son, his mother, and his fiancée make dumplings together

During the epilogue, a family portrait of Dad, his wife, his son, and his son's fiancée is depicted during the credits.

==Trivia==
*As evidenced by the production crew, Dad is indeed his name and not just an alias.<ref>"Making ''Bao''" featurette (''[[Pixar animated shorts compilation videos|Pixar Short Films Collection: Volume 3]]'', 2018, Blu-ray).</ref>
*As the short contains references to Canada due to its setting, Dad is seen wearing a maple leaf sweater, which is a symbol seen on the Canadian flag during the scene where Dad tells his wife that her son is there.
