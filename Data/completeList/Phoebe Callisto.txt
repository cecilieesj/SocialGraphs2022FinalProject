'''Captain Phoebe Callisto''' is one of the main characters who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series, ''[[Miles from Tomorrowland]]''. She is the captain of the [[Stellosphere]] and the mother of [[Miles Callisto|Miles]] and [[Loretta Callisto|Loretta]].

==Background==
===Official Disney Bio===
:''Captain Callisto is also Captain Mom and runs the ship with a warm heart, high standards, and a take-charge personality. A born leader, Phoebe sets a great example and encourages her family on every mission.''

Being both a captain and a mother, she runs the [[Stellosphere]] with a warm heart and is a born leader to the family. She is encouraging and supportive of both her kids and is always ready for action. According to the family, Phoebe is known to be very competitive in all kinds of sports and activities. She's faster than her husband, a champion in both quantum ball and Naxos martial arts, and a sharpshooter at vaporizing space junk. She can perform acrobatic skills when needed

Whenever Miles and Loretta have any fallouts, she knows exactly how to get through to them and help them reconcile all by themselves. However, like all mothers, she is known on rare occasions to be protective whenever her kids are in dangerous situations.
