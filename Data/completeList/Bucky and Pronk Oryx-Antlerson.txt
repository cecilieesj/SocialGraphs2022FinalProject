==Background==
To be added.

== Appearances ==

=== [[Zootopia]] ===
Bucky and Pronk are seen briefly when Judy is shown to her apartment, quickly revealing themselves to be loud, obnoxious, and argumentative next-door neighbors. Later, when Judy is back in her apartment after a rough first day at work and [[Bonnie and Stu Hopps|her parents]] call, Bucky and Pronk overhear the conversation through the thin walls and offer some gruff commentary. Pronk rudely tells Judy to turn off the "depressing music" while Bucky is more sympathetic, stating that he needs to lay off because she "feels like a failure." The two then proceed to yell at each other to shut up. When Judy tells herself that tomorrow is another day, Pronk tells her that tomorrow may be worse.

==Trivia==
*The voice actors for Bucky and Pronk are the directors of the film ''Zootopia''.
*The relationship between the two characters was initially unclear to viewers. It was eventually confirmed that the two were a married couple by [[Jared Bush]], the voice of Pronk.<ref>{{Cite web|website = Twitter|format = Tweet|author = Bush, Jared|date = November 29, 2016|accessdate = December 4, 2016|url = https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/803836679425556480|title = @tommyjoeavery They are a gay married couple. But they don't yell at each other because they're gay, they yell because they're real. ;)}}</ref>
**They are the first LGBT characters in the Disney Animated Canon. Disney now has LGBT characters in all of their major branches ([[Pixar]] has [[Specter]] and [[Greg (Out)|Greg]], the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has [[Valkyrie]] and [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], and ''[[Star Wars]]'' has Moff Mors and [[Aphra]]).
**Bucky's voice actor, [[Byron Howard]], is openly gay in real life.
*Their first names are references to articodactyls, an order of quadrupedal mammals. "Bucky" derives from the English word "Buck", a term that refers to male deer while "Pronk" comes from the English word "pronking", which refers to the action when an antelope (especially a springbok) leaps into the air when excited.
