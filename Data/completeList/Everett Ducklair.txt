||nationality = Planet Corona}}'''Everett Ducklair''' is a character from the [[PKNA]] comic book.

Everett was an inventor who became rich thanks to his inventions, but his mind was so creative that even when he wanted to create simple and mundane machines, he always ended turning them into powerful weapons, to his own chagrin. Everett decided to sell all his belongings (including Ducklair Tower) and retired to a monastery in Tibet.

Everett briefly returns to Duckburg to help [[The Duck Avenger]] and [[Uno]] against [[Due]].
