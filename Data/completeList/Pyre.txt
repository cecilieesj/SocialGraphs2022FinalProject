'''Commander Pyre''' is a [[Stormtroopers|stormtrooper]] commander of the [[First Order]] who appears as the main antagonist of the animated series ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]''. He wears a gold-plated armor and commands a unit of stormtroopers.

==Roles in the series==
During his debut, Pyre was sent to the ''Colossus'' along with several stormtroopers in search of two young fugitives, Kel and Eila, who had escaped the destruction of their village on the planet Tehar. He and his troops eventually cornered the two children in the engineering room, where Kel declared that he and his sister would rather die than be captured before apparently leaping to their deaths. Afterwards, Pyre reported to Phasma that his mission was complete, as the children were "no more". Unbeknownst to Pyre, Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, his friend Neeku Vozo, and the Chelidae engineering staff had faked Kel and Eila's deaths.

Later, Captain Doza messaged Pyre and asked to make arrangements. The First Order officer replied that he would arrive in person to discuss it.

Pyre returned to the ''Colossus'', where he met with Doza to discuss sanctions that would allow the First Order to garrison an occupational force on the station to protect them from the pirates, which had secretly been hired by the First Order so that Doza would let them take over the Colossus. When asked how many troopers would be stationed, Pyre assured Doza that there would be enough to stave off any further threats and that his men were more than capable of eliminating them. Doza then inquired to how long the occupation would last, to which Pyre replied that it was difficult to map out a timeline, citing that pirates can be unpredictable. The meeting concluded when Doza said he would need time to review the sanctions before coming to a decision. Pyre advised him not to too take long, for he was expecting an answer soon, then was escorted off the station.

Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to win Doza's favor, Pyre decided to have the pirates kidnap Torra and only give her back once Doza relinquished the platform to the First Order. This plan ended with the First Order betraying Gorr's pirates and returning Torra to him, which convinced Doza that the First Order was on his side. As such, he allowed the First Order to leave a garrison of stormtroopers on the platform.

Following Kaz's rescue of Aunt Z and Hype Fazon, he returned to Jarek Yeager's repair shop, where he found Yeager, Neeku, and Tam being held at gunpoint by Pyre and his troopers. Pyre then told Kaz that he was under arrest for conspiring against the First Order.

After Pyre and First Order Security Bureau agent [[Tierny]] manipulated Tam into defecting to the First Order, the Colossus left Castilon, prompting a galaxy-wide search by the First Order. After it was learned that the Colossus had briefly docked on the planet Aeos Prime, Pyre and Tierny brought a fleet of Star Destroyers to the Aeos system and orbitally bombarded Aeos Prime, killing the planet’s entire population as revenge for helping the Resistance even though the Colossus had since left.

Angered by their failure to find the Colossus, Supreme Leader [[Kylo Ren]] contacted Pyre and Tierny and warned them that if they failed him again, he would force them to kill each other.

The massacre of the Aeosians finally convinced Tam to leave the First Order and rejoin Kaz. However, she, Kaz, and Yeager were all caught by Pyre aboard his personal Star Destroyer. After escaping, Kaz attempted to duel Pyre with laser axes in the ship’s burning hangar. However, he was pinned down by a piece of debris as Pyre approached him with the axe. As Pyre activated the axe and prepared to decapitate Kaz, CB-23 grabbed the axe with a grappling hook, distracting Pyre. He hit CB-23 with the axe, severely damaging her and deactivating her. This allowed Kaz enough time to grab his laser axe and hit Pyre in the head, knocking him unconscious. Shortly afterwards, Pyre’s capital ship was destroyed by the Resistance, killing him.
