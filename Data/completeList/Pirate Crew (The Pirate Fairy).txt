The '''Pirate Crew''' are a group of minor characters from the ''[[Disney Fairies]]'' film, ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''. There are five members, excluding [[Captain Hook|James]] and [[Zarina]], in total.

==Crew members==
===Oppenheimer===
He is a short and skinny pirate with an eye patch. He works as a cook for the crew. While cooking, he talks to the portrait of his mother, who looks a lot like him, in the ticking of his [[Alarm Clock|mother's clock]]. His "weapons" are his cooking utensils. During ''The Frigate that Flies'', he said that he'll take the mummies from Egypt. He was the pirate assigned to keep an eye on [[Tinker Bell]] and her friends and got defeated by [[Rosetta]]'s baby crocodile, later to be known as [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|Tick-Tock]]. During the final battle with the fairies, he lost his mother's clock when the baby crocodile shallow it and then got bitten on the leg, falling overboard. He was last seen being abandoned by his captain along with his shipmates. What happened to him since then is currently unknown. He was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] along with Port.

===Bonito===
He is a muscular Spanish pirate. His weapon is a giant sword. During ''The Frigate that Flies'', he said that he'll steal Paris' treasures including the Mona Lisa. He reveals that he loves the life of the pirate but added that he hates rats upon seeing some rats pass by. He was the first pirate to fall overboard during the final battle with the fairies. He, along with his shipmates, was last seen abandoned by his captain. What happened to him since then is currently unknown. He was voiced by Carlos Ponce.
===Port===
He is the red-haired, obese pirate with a peg leg. His weapon is a sword. During ''The Frigate that Flies'', he said that he and the crew will take the crown and its jewels from London. He falls overboard along with his shipmates and was last seen abandoned by James the captain. What happened to him since then is currently unknown. He was voiced by Jim Cummings along with Oppenheimer.
===Starboard===
He is the tall, skinny pirate. His weapon is an ax with a long handle although he occasionally carries a sword. During ''The Frigate that Flies'', he said that he'll rob the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. He fell overboard along with his shipmates and was last seen abandoned by James. What happened to him after that is currently unknown. He was voiced by Mick Wingert.

===Yang===
He is a tough Chinese pirate who serves as the Captian's second-in-command and the ship's driver when the captain is busy. His weapons are two swords. He is the only pirate to question why they take orders from "some fairy" (foreshadowing them actually using Zarina as means to an end) before Zarina proved her point. He, with the rest of the crew, fell overboard and was last seen abandoned by their captain, James. What happened to him after that is currently unknown. He was voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].
