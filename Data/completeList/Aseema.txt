'''Shaman Aseema''' is a character from the former [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] attraction, [[Rivers of Light]].

==History==
===Background===
Shaman Aseema is one of the two shamans featured in the former [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] attraction, [[Rivers of Light]] alongside Shaman [[Aditya]]. Throughout the show, she is seen on the Water Lantern Sailboat alongside Acolyte Ambu where her boat represents the element of water. Like the rest of the performers featured in the Rivers of Light show, Aseema does not speak and instead communicates through nonverbal gestures throughout the show.

===Development History===
As of [[September 29]], [[2018]] due to budget costs, Shaman Aseema and the rest of the live performers were removed from the nighttime show permanently. Despite the removal of the performers of the attraction, the remaining elements from the Rivers of Light attraction were retained prior to its closure in 2020.

==Role in the attraction==
Shaman Aseema and Acolyte [[Ambu]] are introduced in the beginning of the show to which during the show, the narrator tells the audience about the elements of water and light harmoniously reuniting to create the wonders of life where the spirits of the animals reunite with each other in harmony to represent the wonders of all living creatures in the attraction to which as the show begins, Aseema plays her flute with her acolyte drumming just as the Parade of the Animal Spirit Guides begins.

In Act III, Aseema summons the great horned owl and sea turtle spirits while conducting the lotuses just as the figures of the turtle and owls dance amongst them while the storytellers provide percussion just before Act IV begins with Ketu summoning the tiger spirit during the show to explore the different realms of the Animal Spirits. 

Later in Act V, Shaman Aseema summons the owl spirit to explore the snowy region of Alaska while Aditya observes the tundra animals reunited with each other in harmony with [[Ketu]] followed by a reprise of "[[We Are One (Rivers of Light song)|We Are One]]", in which the storytellers call in the aurora borealis to reunite all the animal spirits together just as the Animal Spirit Guides return to their lantern barges just before the sequence loops to the Temple Lotus sequence to bring in the grand finale reprise of "We Are One".
