Purrgil are gentle creatures that inhale Clouzon-36 gas to breathe in space and travel through hyperspace. This supposedly inspired space travelers in ancient times to travel through hyperspace as well. Though harmless, Purrgil are often seen as menaces and are often shot at on sight due to their accidental crashing into starships. This has led many, like [[Hera Syndulla]], to view them as dangerous.

A large swarm of Purrgil was encountered by the crew of the Ghost during their expedition to find fuel for the Rebel fleet. Hera immediately suggested attacking hem, but Kanan suggested otherwise and promptly ordered her to follow them, which led them to the fuel stores of the Mining Guild. The Miners Guild fired upon them to keep the creatures away from the Clouzon-36 gas they were harvesting, but the Ghost's crew attacked the facility, distracting the miners so that the Purrgil could harvest the gas. When Hera prepared to blow up the gas so that the Galactic Empire couldn't use it, [[Ezra Bridger]], who used the Force to bond with the Purrgil, realized they needed the gas to survive, and promptly had Hera and the Purrgil destroy the Mining Guild's base instead. With the Clouzon-36 now available to the Purrgil for future use, the Purrgil departed peacefully, and jumped into hyperspace, to the amazement of the crew of the Ghost. 

Ezra would later summon the Purrgil when he and the rebels would liberate [[Lothal]]. The Purrgil decimated the fleet of Grand Admiral [[Thrawn]] crashing into the ships with devastating effect, and on Ezra's command, used their tentacles to grab ahold of Thrawn's star destroyer and entrapped Thrawn in their grasp. Ezra then commanded the Purrgil to jump into hyperspace, taking the ship, Thrawn and Ezra into the unknown.
