'''Stitches''' is a supervillain, the sidekick/adopted father of [[Gwen Grayson]], and the secondary antagonist in ''[[Sky High]]''.

==Background==
Stitches was once the Hero support for [[Gwen Grayson|Royal Pain]]. However, she was defeated by [[the Commander]] when he used her own weapon against her. She survived though, as the laser turned her into a baby. Royal Pain was given the new name of Gwen Grayson, and was later raised by Stitches.

==Role in the film==
Years later, while adopting a more serious persona under his true identity, Stitches participates in his mistress' plan to destroy Sky High out of her spurned rage. When the Commander falls for their ruse and takes home a giant eye allowing them to monitor him and confirm the Pacifier's whereabouts, Stitches gloats, annoying Royal Pain, who strangles him.

As he loads the de-aged staff and students into the school bus, he is caught by Ron Wilson and is knocked out with a punch. He joins Royal Pain and the other villains in the detention room afterwards. (In the outtakes after Gwen expresses her dismay of going through puberty twice, Stitches tries to console her, saying "Daddy's going to make it all better." Only to be choked by Gwen; a recurrent running gag shown through their early scenes in the film.)

At the end, it is revealed that Stitches and the others are in prison. Stitches is seen looking extremely miserable while his boss is begging to be put in solitary confinement.
