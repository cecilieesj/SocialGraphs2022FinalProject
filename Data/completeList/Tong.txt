'''Tong''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]’s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''. Described as a formidable giant, Tong was the last surviving member of [[Kumandra]]’s [[Spine]] Land, after humanity was desolated by the [[Druun]]. Among the casualties were his family, including his infant daughter. In the aftermath, Tong became the sole guardian of Spine’s Dragon Gem piece, and joined forces with [[Raya]] to save the world with the help of the last dragon, [[Sisu]].

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Underneath his huge, gruff, and fierce exterior, Tong is really a lonely woodsman with a soft spot for little ones. Equal parts severity and softness, he is truly a gentle giant.''

==Role in the film==
Arriving at the Land of Spine, [[Raya]] and [[Sisu]] get caught in a sack where the two find themselves at Tong's hut to which Tong explains to the two that it has been a while that he saw someone passing by his shelter. As Sisu believes that Tong is lonely, he denies, explaining that he was born and bred to do only one thing: to conquer his fear and to face off his enemies with courage. Just as he explains to the two that it will take up to two weeks to clean up what he plans to do to them (even though it's apparent he doesn't actually have a plan), he is foiled by Tuk Tuk, Noi, and the three Ongis who tie him up to a post.

Upon looking at a group of Spine soldiers petrified by the [[Druun]], Tong shares his story of his warriors battling the Druun before they were petrified just before Raya plans to stall Namaari's plan. As Raya asks him for his name, the lone warrior of Spine introduces himself as Tong to which he pleads to him to help them by escorting her companions out of the village while she distracts Namaari, to which she agrees. Tong escorts the rest of Raya's companions across the forest as Raya engages in a duel against Namaari, but just as they're about to leave, Sisu notices that Raya is in trouble and reveals her true dragon form to rush in and save her, after which they all leave together while Namaari watches in stunned silence, having never seen a live dragon before,

On their way to Fang, Tong agrees to be a part of the group's mission to save Kumandra since like everyone else, he wishes to be reunited with his family, as well as bring his people back, Sisu devises a plan to Raya to get the last Dragon Gem Piece from Fang, but no one else is swilling to go along with it since it involves trusting Namaari to just hand it over by explaining their plight. In response to this, Sisu takes Raya to where her brothers and sisters are frozen as statues explains the situation when she was entrusted with the other's pieces, which they infused with their magic, and which allowed her to vanquish the Druun, even if it meant the rest of them were turned to stone. She explains that when her brothers and sisters put their faith in her, it empowered her beyond anything that she could have imagined, and the same could also happen to Namaari as a plan to save Kumandra, which convinces Raya, and by extension, the others, to at least try her plan.

Upon arriving at Fang, Tong argues with Boun about the ingredients placed in the soup Raya's father made to which Raya adds jsut the right balance of ingredients to make it taste better and tells her friends about how she learned to make it that way from her father made for her before his petrification. Tong then explains to Raya that the baby's name is Noi after which the conversation is disrupted upon seeing a flare in the sky. The next day, Tong and the rest of Raya's friends meet up with Namaari, but due to feeling conflicted between her duty to her people and cooperating with them to help defeat the Druun, she pulls out a crossbow and nervously threatens them to give her their gem pieces, which causes everyone else to angrily claim they shouldn't have trusted her. Sisu tries to calm her down, but when Raya takes out her whipsword to stop her when she sees her finger on the trigger, she accidently fires an arrow at Sisu that hits and kills her. With Sisu gone, Tong and the rest of Raya's friends react to what happened and Namaari did to her just before the Druun arrive at Kumandra again. However, while Raya tries to confront Namaari in a rage, the rest of them witness the citizens of Fang being attacked by the Druun due to all the water drying up as a result of Sisu dying. Therefore, Boun leads them in evacuating as many citizens to safety as possible, and eventually, both Raya and Namaari join them as well after snapping out of their anger.  However, the Druun eventually begin to surround and trap their group. While this happens, Raya remembers how trust allowed Sisu to save the world. To the others' surprise, she then urges them to unite and reassemble the gem, showing her faith in Namaari by handing over her gem piece and allowing the Druun to turn her into stone. Boun, Tong, Noi and the ongis then solemnly follow suit, and Namaari reassembles the gem before the Druun petrify her as well.

With all the pieces of the Dragon Gem reunited, the Druun are wiped away by a resulting shockwave, and Tong is revived alongside everyone in Kumandra by a magical rainstorm that follows. This time, the dragons are also revived, and they, in turn, quickly revive Sisu. Like everyone else, Tong returns to his respective kingdom, Spine and reunites with his people. Later, Tong visits the kingdom of Heart with everyone else in rejoice and to formally join together as one nation again.
