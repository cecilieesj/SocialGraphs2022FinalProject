'''Kiko Tanaka''' is a character in the [[Disney+]] Original series ''[[Baymax!]].'' She is an elder who overcomes her discomfort of swimming with the help of her new friend [[Baymax]].

==Background==

===Personality===
Kiko, at first glance, is a grumpy elderly woman who rarely interacts with anyone and appears to be easily annoyed at things. However, she is later revealed to have a soft emotional center and at one point enjoyed her life, even though she feels that she may not have taken full advantage of it. Following help from Baymax, she becomes a much more determined and helpful woman who displays high confidence and is even willing to sacrifice herself for others as seen when she prepared to protect herself against Baymax and Sofia from the warehouse detonation.

{{quote|Kiko is a bit of a curmudgeon... She doesn't want to interact with anybody. Like a lot of people who find themselves alone later in life—or at any point in life—she's really shut down emotionally. But as she gets enmeshed in this battle with Baymax to escape his help, she finds herself reluctantly starting to reconnect to the world.|Cirocco Dunlap<ref>https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/documents/baymax_production_brief_final_06-27-22_fcb25aa9.pdf</ref>}}

===Physical appearance===
Kiko is a short, stocky elderly woman of Japanese descent who has her black-grey hair done up in a bun. She usually wears a turquoise polo shirt, beige shorts and grey casuals; sometimes accompanied by a straw sun hat. When she dons her ninjutsu gear, she wears a blue headband with a white lily on it, matching blue wrist bands, and a brown belt with pink slippers stapled on to emulate pockets one of which has a stapler gun. 

===Abilities===
Despite her appearance, Kiko is very agile, especially after taking up swimming again. She is apparently well gifted in ninjutsu and can handle sharp objects very well as throwing projectiles.

==Trivia==
*Due to her hearing, she misremembers Baymax's name as "Borax", a type of cleaning product.
*She shares some similarities with [[Carl Fredricksen]] from ''[[Up]]'' in that both are elderly characters who have lost someone close to them and are aided by younger characters who help them enjoy life.
