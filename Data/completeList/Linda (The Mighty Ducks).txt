Linda is a student at [[Eden Hall Academy]] and [[Charlie Conway]]'s love interest in [[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]. She is played by Margot Finley.

== Biography ==
Linda is first seen at Eden Hall asking for petitions to change the name of the [[Eden Hall Warriors|Varsity Warriors]] as she considered the name demeaning. Charlie was one of the people she asked. When Charlie insisted that the name was not that bad, Linda believed that he was a Warrior "jock". Saying that they stick together and walked away from Charlie leaving him flustered.

Linda is next seen trying to get a seat at a table in the lunchroom but is unable to get the seat she wants because one of the cheerleaders lets her know that that it is a "warrior cheerleaders table". Linda left the table calling the cheerleader who bullied her an "airhead." A few moments later, when Charlie, [[Fulton Reed|Fulton]] and [[Russ Tyler|Russ]] play a prank on the Warriors with Horse manure, the manure accidentally lands on the cheerleaders table, causing the girls to leave in fear and disgust with Linda remarking "Thanks for not letting me sit there!"

Charlie meets up with Linda at the bus stop while they are waiting. Despite Linda's initial opinion of Charlie, when they talk more, she discovers he is not the guy he assumed he was. Charlie invites Linda to his hockey game against the Blakewood Bears. Linda however, gets put off by Charlie's unsportsman-like conduct, and the teams embarrassing tie 9 – 9.

When Charlie decides to come back to Eden Hall after leaving previously, Linda is pleased to see him return, having been relieved that he was alright. She also defends Charlie in front of Rick Riley and the other Varsity Warriors.

Linda later on attended the final game of the Ducks vs. the Warriors and cheered on Charlie and the Ducks. When [[Gordon Bombay|Bombay]] revealed that the team name of Eden Hall was changed to the Eden Hall Ducks, Linda was ecstatic and went down to thank Charlie. The two then shared a kiss, and Charlie left to celebrate his victory with his team.

== Trivia ==

However, they could still be together since both actors may not appear.
* Linda could be considered the main female lead in the film, since she is Charlie’s love interest, and Charlie is the protagonist of D3: The Mighty Ducks.
