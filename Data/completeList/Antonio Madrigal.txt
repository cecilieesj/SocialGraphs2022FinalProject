{{Quote|Uh-huh, uh-huh, I understand you.|Antonio realizing his gift.}}
'''Antonio Madrigal''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''. He is the youngest son of [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Félix Madrigal]], and the younger brother of [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] and [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]]. Antonio is the youngest member of [[The Madrigals]] and is gifted with the power to communicate with animals (having a special bond with [[Parce]], [[Pico]], and [[Chispi]]).

== Background ==
Born into the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal family]], Antonio is the youngest member of the family. Antonio is the youngest son of [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]], and the younger brother of [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] and [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]]. In addition to being the nephew of [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] and [[Agustín Madrigal|Agustín]], Antonio is also the cousin of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]], and [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]]. Being too young and not having a gift yet, his [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]] never put expectations or pressures on Antonio's shoulders like other members of the family. Also due to being the youngest member of The Madrigals and being born after his uncle left the family, Antonio was never able to meet Bruno and thus has no memory of him.

Prior to his gift ceremony, he lives in the nursery with Mirabel due to his cousin never receiving a magical gift. Antonio greatly admires Mirabel to the point of considering her a big sister. What makes Antonio unique amongst the Madrigal family is his ability to talk to and understand non-human animals, among which are capybaras (one named [[Chispi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/EncantoMovie/status/1466089723886145542|title=Chispi's Name|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 1, 2021|access-date=December 27, 2021}}</ref>), toucans (with [[Pico]] among them), hummingbirds, coatis, a tapir, and a jaguar named [[Parce]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1475104728476381184|title=Parce's Name|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 26, 2021|access-date=December 27, 2021}}</ref> all of whom assist Antonio. He is capable of keeping other animals under control and in safe condition, such as reminding Parce not to eat the rats, as they can help him.

===Official Description===
:''Antonio is Mirabel’s youngest cousin who has a sweet relationship with her, with Mirabel being a big sister to him.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/w/news/2021/09/10/encanto-character-details/|title=“Encanto” Character Details Revealed|website=LaughingPlace|last=Newsdesk|first=Disney|date=September 10, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

:''The youngest of the Madrigal family, Antonio is shy with a huge heart. He has a special connection to Mirabel, relying on her for comfort and courage, especially on an important day when his cousin finds him nervously hiding under his bed.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/meet-the-characters-of-encanto/|title=“Encanto” Character Details Revealed|website=D23|last=Team|first=D23|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

===Development===
How with the rest of the Madrigal family, Antonio was designed to reflect "family archetypes that are immediately relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-11-29/encanto-explained-disney-colombia-consultants|title=‘Encanto’ is Disney’s first Latino musical. How the filmmakers got Colombia right|website=LATimes|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=November 24, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> As in the final production, the studio created Antonio from the start as the youngest of his family in order to show how most of the Madrigals receive their magical gifts. Other elements that did not change during the creation process were Antonio's sweet but very shy personality and his magical gift of communicating with animals. To create his appearance, the studio explored many different facial features and hair tones for Antonio while for his clothing they wanted it to be colorful and incorporates the animals he can communicate with. 

Antonio's voice actor, Ravi-Cabot Conyers, described his character : ''"Antonio’s gift is talking to animals and communicating with them. And they can communicate with him. And he’s kind of an introvert… but he also has a really big heart. I also think that he can communicate with all different sorts of people."''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vitalthrills.com/encanto-movie/|title=Encanto Movie Cast & Crew on the New Disney Film|website=VitalThrills|last=Busch|first=Jenna|date=November 8, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

===Personality===
As the youngest member in his family, Antonio is very sweet and innocent. He loves his family so much and is willing to do anything to help them, such as he willingly offered his ostracized uncle, [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] (whom he had no memory of and just met), to use his room so he can have a vision in order for him and Mirabel to figure out how to save their family's magic. Antonio shares a close relationship with his older cousin, Mirabel where he looks up to her for comfort and wishes she had a magical gift, knowing how hard it must be for her to be the only child in their family to not have any magical abilities. It is this profound empathy for his cousin that earns him the trust of Bruno's rats who inform Antonio of his uncle and cousin's whereabouts and predicament.

Antonio is also a very shy individual and has trouble being around other people, except for his family. He gets stage fright very easily and prefers to interact only with his family and animal friends. Yet, when members of his family get nervous, Antonio would go to help them, such as when he gave Bruno his stuffed jaguar doll to calm his nerves before he did his vision and escorted Mirabel to the newly-built Casa Madrigal so she can put a new doorknob on the front door.

===Physical appearance===
Antonio is a 5-year-old boy with dark skin, curly black hair, and dark brown eyes. He wears a long-sleeved yellow and light orange striped shirt with an orange sleeveless vest over it, along with a red scarf. He has brown jeans and dark beige and orange shoes. Symbolizing his gift, Antonio's vest has some animals sewn on it. During his gift ceremony, following the tradition, he wears white clothes similar to his normal ones, but with a white vest instead of a scarf.

===Powers and abilities===
Antonio has the power to communicate with animals. Because of this, he has a lot of animals in his room, from capybaras to toucans to hummingbirds, coati, a tapir, and even a jaguar.

Antonio cannot ''control'' the animals he talks to; this is strictly based on the bonds of trust and closeness he builds with them that allows him to rely on them for help and companionship, as well as to discourage undesirable behavior, such as when he warned Parce from eating his uncle Bruno's rats.

==Appearances==
===''[[Encanto]]''===
Antonio first appeared accompanying his family to the village as they get ready to celebrate his fifth birthday and gift ceremony. Later, before the beginning of the ceremony, he hid underneath Mirabel's bed in her room, anxious that his gift ceremony would also fail like hers. However, Mirabel was able to encourage him to come out of hiding. Antonio was then wished good luck by his family and his parents tell him that they'll be waiting for him at his door. When the gift ceremony starts, Antonio became too anxious to go forward. He held out his hand to Mirabel, since he wanted her to accompany him, but the latter initially refused, knowing that Alma will disapprove of it. However, he desperately whispered that he needs her so that he wouldn't be scared and Mirabel reluctantly takes his hand. The other Madrigals were then stunned upon seeing that Antonio wants Mirabel to accompany him. After climbing up the stairs, he swore to use his gift to help the community by Alma and upon putting his hand on the doorknob of his door, a toucan suddenly landed on his arm and he immediately understood it and when the bird asked him if all of his friends could come, Antonio happily agreed.

Upon entering his magic door, he was astonished upon seeing that his new room is a big and beautiful jungle with a big tree. A jaguar then suddenly came in and gave Antonio a ride on his back. After that, he and the rest of the family, sans Mirabel, had a group picture.

Antonio found out from the rats that Bruno was living in the walls of Casita. Upon hearing Bruno and Mirabel's conversation, he offers his room to substitute for Bruno's. After the house crumbled and the family's magic faded, Antonio helped rebuild the house. Like his gift ceremony, he walks Mirabel up the pathway and hands over the doorknob with Mirabel's initial on it and witnessed her placing it on the front door, which reignited the magic. He rides Parce around Casita before taking a picture with his family.

=== ''Antonio's Amazing Gift'' ===

== Disney Parks ==
Antonio appears as an [[It's a Small World]] doll in the 2022 finale of the [[Main Street Electrical Parade]] alongside Mirabel and Pico.

== Relationships ==
*'''[[Mirabel Madrigal]]:''' Antonio is the closest to Mirabel, as he looks up to her and sees her more as a sister than his cousin. As the two of them do not have magical gifts at the start of the film, this allows Mirabel and Antonio to form a close bond between them. It was this bond that they share that makes Mirabel realize there may be hope for her place in the family. Unlike others in the family, Antonio did not seem to assume the worst of Mirabel for being in Bruno's catastrophic vision. At the end of the movie, like with his gift ceremony, Antonio walked with Mirabel up the pathway and even gave her the new doorknob for Casita.
*'''[[Dolores Madrigal]]:''' Dolores is Antonio's older sister and before his gift ceremony, she is shown being very supportive of him and excited for him, giving him a pep talk, and Dolores is overall very happy when Antonio gets his gift. During reconstruction, Antonio is shown working with her and their father.
*'''[[Camilo Madrigal]]:''' Camilo is Antonio's older brother. He helps Dolores give him a pep talk before his gift ceremony, and he even transforms into a small version of him and Antonio's father Félix to get Antonio to laugh.
*'''[[Bruno Madrigal]]:''' Bruno is Antonio's maternal uncle by blood. Since Bruno left the family five years before he was born, Antonio, even more so than Mirabel and Camilo, knew nothing about his uncle other than the taboo on his name. Though his opinion of Bruno beforehand was unknown, Antonio learns more of him when he, at some point after acquiring his gift, talks to Bruno's rats who tell him of Bruno's hiding in the Casita's walls. From the rats, Antonio is able to recognize his uncle as a kind soul, and offers him and Mirabel to use his room for a vision. In their brief time, Antonio sees Bruno as a friend, likely in part due to their shared affinity with animals. Empathizing with Bruno's anxieties, Antonio gives him his stuffed jaguar to help calm his nerves. When Bruno finally returns to the family and is embraced by his sisters, Antonio is happy for him, while also affirming him to his brother, who had a misleading perception of their uncle.
*'''Animals:''' ''Coming soon!''

==Trivia==
*Antonio's birthday is on May 21st, coinciding with [[Wikipedia:Afro-Colombian Day|Afro-Colombian Day]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1505222674322132992|title=Antonio's birthday|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=March 19, 2022|access-date=March 19, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1504942335104192512|title=Meaningful Birthdays|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=March 18, 2022|access-date=March 18, 2022}}</ref>, meaning the film's events take place from there.
*His name is a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great Saint Anthony the Great], the Patron Saint of Animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1481055766434004993|title=Antonio's name|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 11, 2022|access-date=January 11, 2022}}</ref>
*In real life, it is illegal to keep exotic animals such as  jaguars, toucans, and other types of exotic animals like the ones that Antonio has as pets, as it is considered illegal trade. Capybaras, though, are allowed as pets in some states and countries, since they are not endangered species.
*In the movie posters, Antonio is seen wearing a vest with animal patterns sewn on it, but he is seen wearing it in only one scene. Presumably because this vest represents his gift, and he doesn't receive it until later on in the film.
* Antonio's main outfit is actually a colorful version of his gift ceremony costume, which he starts out with in the film due to not receiving a gift yet.<ref>[[The Art of Encanto]]</ref>
*Antonio is left-handed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimators/status/1582066567239458817|title=Antonio Left-Handed|website=Twitter|date= October 17, 2022|access-date=October 17, 2022}}</ref>
*Antonio's favorite snack is nailed rice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1581969905712173057|title=Antonio's Favorite Snack|website=Twitter|date=October 17, 2022|access-date=October 20, 2022}}</ref>
