}}'''Tasha Davenport''' is the mother of [[Leo Dooley]], and wife to inventor [[Donald Davenport]] in the show ''[[Lab Rats]]''.

==Background==
Tasha is Donald's wife, Leo's mother and Adam, Bree and Chase's step-mother. A news reporter, she's shown to have met Donald in an online dating service and seems to enjoy a happy marriage with him, despite the chaos that's now present in her life. She and Leo understand each other fully and seem hold a lot of the same traits in personality. She can be smothering and intrusive at times and seems to hold a bit of a competitive streak. Still she's sassy, opinionated, loving and enthusiastic. She treats the trio as her own kids and gives Bree the motherly advice when needed in boy troubles or other problems. As shown, she is not a big fan of the 4G world and gets tired of it quite a lot. She doesn't quite like Eddie due to random comments and teasing of her, also annoyance. She doesn't want Leo watching Pig Zombies or drinking any gas or fizzy drinks because it makes him all jumpy.
