'''Nedward "Ned" Diggety''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the high school cousin of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] who loves cheese and always seems to be eating it around the house.

==Background==
Ned Diggety lives in the same duplex as [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]], his cousin. All he does throughout the day is watch TV and eat cheese, his favorite pastime. Throughout the series, he mainly serves to show the dysfunctional extended family of Pepper Ann and for a quick cutaway gag. He did get some focus in "[[License to Drive]]" where Pepper Ann served on him hand and foot in the hopes that he will get a ride from him in his "new set of wheels". To her disappointment, they were literal wheels for his bicycle. Ned found the mix-up amusing and offered Pepper Ann a ride to school nonetheless.

Ned and his family are absent in "[[The Finale]]", though based on his personality, it would not be surprising if he still lived in the other half of the duplex.

===Personality===
Ned is a very laid back character who does not have a care in the world to the point that nothing seems to interest him. It appears that he is not very intelligent as he was unable to follow simple instructions in "[[Thanksgiving Dad]]" and chased after cheese like a mouse in "[[Crush and Burn]]". However in "License to Drive", he is shown to be rather advantageous and smarter than he lets on; allowing Pepper Ann to kiss up to him so that he could get what he wants. He does genuinely care for his family though and even tried to empathize with his cousin; knowing full well what she was thinking despite never having experienced anything like it himself.

===Physical appearance===
Ned is a tall gawky Caucasian boy who wears a green and orange hat that slunks over his eyes. He wears a teal shirt and a light brown coat over it, light grey jeans and white sneakers with blue lightning bolts on them.

==Trivia==
*Ned's full name, Nedward, is clearly meant to be a gag on the fact that Ned is usually short for Edward.
*Ned has only ever had one major role. Every other appearance has usually been background roles and no dialogue. This could be due to the writers not being able to find a way to incorporate him into the series more.
