}}The '''Mother Bird''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney|Disney]]'s [[1951]] film,Â ''[[Alice in Wonderland]].''
==Role in the film==
After eating a mushroom piece given to her by the [[Caterpillar]], [[Alice]] grew to immense size and her head crashed up into the mother bird's nest. Accusing her of being a serpent, the mother bird attacked Alice and she quickly acted to shrink herself with another mushroom piece. As she did, the bird managed to grab her eggs and make sure they're safe before getting one last good look at where Alice was.

==Trivia==
*The mother bird's animation was later reused for that of the Toucan's in ''[[Goliath II]]''.
*In one Alice in Wonderland comic, when the mother bird came to tell the Dodo (who was with Alice) about what was going on in the [[Tulgey Wood]], she hardly seemed to mind Alice (if she even noticed her at all), possibly due to her size.
