==Appearances==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
After delivering the Sonic Disruptor to Klaw he gets annoyed by The Wasp and fights her, but he ends up defeated by her. He was later taken to The Big House, without knowledge of The Big House he tried to escape the vicinity but Ant-Man prevented him from escaping realizing what The Big House really is. In his holding cell he is itching to escape but then he calms down when the Mad Thinker told him about the four supervillain prisons on the planet and that a system shutdown would free them soon.

When the breakout happens Whirlwind escaped The Big House and knocked some S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents out along the way. He later found Ant-Man. He provoked him by hurting the Wasp. He then punched him to a ledge and grabbed hold of him. As Griffin tried to attack Ant-Man he shrinked himself and attacked Whirlwind instead.

Once being taken in to 42 for yet another crime, the power started flickering on and off. Later, giant bugs started to attack 42 and where controlled by a villain called Annihilus. He, along with other villains, helped Captain America, Ms. Marvel, and Thor take down the bugs. But ended up getting killed by the Bugs, although he may have survived.

In the episode "Doomed", he was mentioned as having been previously beaten by Spider-Man. Later in "Me Time", Whirlwind appears in the episode's opening. Hired by Doctor Octopus, Whirlwind causes havoc in town until Spider-Man fights him. Spider-Man defeats Whirlwind by webbing off his helmet and knocking him out with it. Spider-Man, due to becoming dizzy in the tornado, throws up in the helmet and that Nick Fury might want to have the helmet washed before returning it to Whirlwind. Norman Osborn later watches footage of Spider-Man's fight with Whirlwind.

In the episode "Spectrums", Whirlwind plots to rob a Roxxon laboratory, Whirlwind is confronted by Ant-Man wanting the technology back, leading to Whirlwind attacking. With unlikely help from Black Widow and Hawkeye, Ant-Man manages to grow in size and defeat Whirlwind and then takes Whirlwind's technology back.
