==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'' ====
Sara Wolfe was present in Kamar-Taj when [[Wong]] ordered it to become fortified. She then witnessed [[Scarlet Witch]]'s arrival and her confrontation with [[Doctor Strange]] in the sky. When Scarlet Witch began destroying the barrier surrounding Kamar-Taj, Sara used the cannons to blast her. Angered, Scarlet Witch destroyed the cannons, which knocked Sara out in the process. Sara located Wong and Scarlet Witch in one of Kamar-Taj’s courtyards. When she approached Wong, he was surprised she was still alive. As they watched Scarlet Witch engage in dreamwalking, Wong told her she needed to free him so he could destroy the Darkhold. She told him that it couldn’t be him and instead took a dagger herself and stabbed the Darkhold. This action caused her to instantly be burned to death. As she burnt to a crisp, she let out a single tear.

==Trivia==
