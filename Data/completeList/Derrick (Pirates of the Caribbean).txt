'''Derrick''' is a character who appears in the [[2011]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''.

==Background==
Prior to his death, Derrick served as one of the crewmen who was recruited by Jack Sparrow to seek the Fountain of Youth. Derrick felt proud of himself after being recruited by Captain Jack to join him on his quest.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===
After a fugitive [[Jack Sparrow]] finds himself in the Captain's Daughter pub and escapes from a group of [[Redcoats]] pursuing the captain, Derrick and a number of sailors signed to sail with Jack. Having been recruited by Jack, Derrick felt proud of Jack and asked who would buy a drink for him.

Onboard the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Derrick served as the ship's deckhands where he would work with a shanghaied Jack Sparrow. Derrick felt dissatisfied when sailing with [[Angelica]] and her [[Blackbeard's Zombie Officers|undead crewmen]] and participated during mutiny at the ''Revenge''. Jack's crew survived the mutiny until [[Blackbeard]] arrives and after explaining that he noticed a mutiny aboard the ship, Derrick and the rest of the human crew were hung; however, Derrick and the rest of the crewmen were let down, noticing the Cook being punished by Blackbeard to which the punished crewman suddenly becomes a zombie.

Arriving at [[Whitecap Bay]], Derrick and some of the crewmen of the ''Revenge'' were sent out to find a mermaid for Blackbeard to bring for the ritual and having attracted a mermaid, it is found out that this plan was a trap. The mermaids began attacking and destroyed the boat where Derrick was at, to which Derrick had a gruesome demise while being drowned and eaten by mermaids.

==Video game appearances==

In the non-canonical video game, Derrick appears as a playable character in the video game adaptation of the film. Unlike in the film, Derrick survives the mermaid attack and also arrives at the Fountain of Youth, along with the rest of the crew of the ''Queen Anne's Revenge''.
