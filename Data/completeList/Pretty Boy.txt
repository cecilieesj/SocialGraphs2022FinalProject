In the movie, he stays at home with Spot and Jolly while Leonard and his mom are on vacation. After spot leaves to see Dr. Ivan Krank, he and Jolly cover for him. Later, they find out that Dr. Krank turns animals into mutants and go to save Spot. After hitching a ride on a plane, hitch a ride with a biker gang, and getting lost in Cuba, they get to Florida by a garbage truck and find Leonard and they find out about what happened to Spot.
