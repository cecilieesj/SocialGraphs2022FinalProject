'''Mr. Anderson''' is [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]'s father and a supporting character in the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.

==Role in the film==
Mr. Anderson first appears telling Bonnie about her first day at school. When she asks him if she can bring [[Jessie]] to school, he explains to her that toys never go to school. Just as Bonnie conquers her fear of her first day at school, he and his wife take her to school. After Bonnie finishes her first day, she shows her created toy [[Forky]] to her parents to which her father is proud of her being brave of finishing her orientation day at school. Bonnie's parents tell her that school does not start until another week to which Bonnie's family go on a road trip. As Bonnie's family goes on a road trip, Bonnie's toys try to keep Forky from living in trash cans until Bonnie's family goes on a road trip in the Grand Basin.

Arriving at the Grand Basin near the carnival, Forky is separated from Bonnie during [[Woody]]'s plan to find [[Bo Peep]] and reunite her with his gang while Bonnie has a hard time finding him. While trying to look for Forky, Bonnie's father then explains to her daughter to look harder in the RV in order to find Forky before they leave to which the toys plan to put Bonnie's family in trouble in order to find Forky; Jessie manages to pop one of the RV's tires using a nail, causing Bonnie's father to have a hard time finding a spare tire. Just as Bonnie's family leaves for the Tri-County Area with a spare tire replacing the flat one, Bonnie's family prepares to drive back to the Tri-County Area. The toys distract Bonnie's father to drive his back into the [[Second Chance Antiques]] to get Bonnie's backpack as well as back to the [[The Carnival|carnival]], to get into trouble with the sheriff of the Grand Basin area.

Meanwhile, Bonnie's family talks with the sheriff of the Grand Basin just as the sheriff clears out their accusations for troubles across the Grand Basin which is the reason why Bonnie was looking for Forky. Just as Woody bids a farewell to Bonnie's toys and Woody and Bo Peep reunite together to help lost toys in the carnival find new owners, Bonnie's family drives back to the Tri-County Area to return back home.
