'''Le Sewer and Ratatouille''' are [[Maltese de Sade|Maltese de Sade's]] idiotic French gang members from the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode "[[Le Purrfect Crime]]."

Le Sewer (a.k.a. M'sieur Le Sewer) is a French weasel thief and Ratatouille is a French rat thief and a talented painter. Something that can be viewed as kind of odd is when Ratatouille comments on his hatred of rodents. Le Sewer remarks that he is a rodent himself. Ratatouille disagrees and proudly states that he is not a rodent but an artist.

==Trivia==
*Le Sewer is a parody referring to the sewers.
*Ratatouille was named after [[Ratatouille (food)|a French recipe]]. It is also, coincidentally, the title of a Pixar film.
