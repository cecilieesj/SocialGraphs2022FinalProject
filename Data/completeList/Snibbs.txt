'''Snibbs''' is the French butler of [[Mayor Baba|Mayor Baba's]] historical counterpart from the episode "[[Sherlock Goof]]", from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
He greeted [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]] when he arrived at [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald's]] house to exterminate the rats that were infesting it. He ended up injuring himself, so Sir Reginald let him take the day off.

===Personality===
Snibbs is disapproving of anyone he deems lower than himself, initally refusing to allow [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]] into [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald's]] home because he didn't think he was a real ratcatcher (probably due to Sherlock's goofy behavior). He tends to exhibit patronizing behavior and acts suavely.

===Physical appearance===
Snibbs is tall, skinny anthropomorphic dog with black hair. He wears a black tuxedo.

===Role in the series===
He only appears in the episode, "[[Sherlock Goof]]". The epynomous main character ends up letting himself into [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald's]] lodging after Snibbs injures himself.

==Trivia==
*Snibbs' voice actor Rob Paulsen uses the exact same voice for other French characters that appear in Goof Troop.
