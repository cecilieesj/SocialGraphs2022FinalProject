==Background==
===Development===
[[File:Rachel_concept_art.jpg|thumb|left]]
Rachel was created by [[Eric Goldberg]], in which was inspired by his youngest daughter. Rachel's real-life sister Jenny was the model for a character in Rachel's scenes, the girl with blue hair that can perform all the actions that Rachel can not. At the time the segment was being produced, the real Jenny had blue hair.<ref name="AWM">"''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''" on [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.09/4.09pages/solomonrhapsody2.php3 ''Animation World Magazine'']</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia 2000]]''===
Rachel first appears walking out of an upper class apartment building with her parents and [[Nasty Nanny]]. Her parents leave for work and Rachel, albeit reluctantly, goes off to her various classes with her nanny.

In these various classes (which include ballet, art, gymnastics, singing, swimming, tennis and piano), Rachel seems to not excel in any of them, much to the annoyance of her teachers. During her violin lesson, Rachel sadly stares out the window holding her toy ball and wishes that she could be with her parents.

Towards the end of the segment, Nasty Nanny gets Rachel back into her coat and hat to go off to her next class. Rachel struggles, refusing to go, and accidentally drops her ball out of the window. As she rushes outside to grab it, her parents look out of the windows of the buildings they work in and panic when they see their daughter about to run into moving traffic. The parents save Rachel just as she gets the ball back.

At the end of the segment, Rachel is shown happily spending time with her parents and getting a piggyback ride from her dad.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
She also makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Goofy's Menu Magic]]".

==Trivia==
*While not explicitly stated in the film, it's highly likely that Rachel and her parents are wealthy: aside that her parents seem to have stable jobs during the Great Depression, Rachel is able to attend many classes (which they would likely not spend money for if they were financially struggling) and their first scene depicts them leaving an upper class apartment building, which may be their home.
