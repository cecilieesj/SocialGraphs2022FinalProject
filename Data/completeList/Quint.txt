==Background==
===Personality===
[[File:Yc4.png|thumb|left|250px|Cusco Quint.]]
Though his occupation does vary throughout the series, Quint is typically arrogant and conceited, with a conflated ego. He is exceptionally manipulative and sly, and likes to trick others into doing his bidding. He will go so far as to pretend that he is someone's friend, only to betray them and steal from them, as shown in "[[Klondike Con]]", where Quint begins as a courteous man helping Timon and Pumbaa, with Timon not gaining his trust, helping them get gold. When Timon and Pumbaa have the sack of gold with them as they are falling off a cliff, Quint says to throw the gold to him to help them get back up. Timon, still in distrust, declines his offer. However, Pumbaa reminds Timon all the good things Quint had done for them, so Timon decides to throw the bag to Quint so he could save them. At that moment, from "Courteous Quint", he turns into "Claim Jumper Quint" and steals the gold from Timon and Pumbaa. In other cases, he will simply use his superior strength and force of personality to bully others into serving him.

Despite Quint's devious tendencies, he sometimes acts as a simple workman. For instance, in "[[Truth or Zaire]]", Timon and Pumbaa believe that he is a hunter who wants to kill them, but he is actually a wildlife photographer who merely wants a photograph of them to sell to magazines. Even so, he tends to get in Timon and Pumbaa's way, intentionally or not. Other times, in the defense of his business or occupation, he will get into scrapes with Timon and Pumbaa because of their failure to comply with regulations or rules, as shown in "[[Palm Beached]]" and "[[Going Over-Boar'd]]".

===Physical appearance===
Quint is a tall and beefy man with black hair and a usually shaven face. His nose is often pink, but in certain episodes of Season 3 ("[[Escape from Newark]]" for example) as well as certain comics, it is the same color as the rest of his body. Quint's outfit differs depending on his occupation or role; for instance, he wears a black mask while working as a criminal, a white toga while working as a Roman official, etc.

==Role in series==
Quint appears throughout the series. He makes his first appearance in the episode "[[Yukon Con]]" and his last appearance in the episode "[[Ready, Aim, Fire]]".

[[File:Carlos and Consuelo Quint.png|thumb|250px|Carlos and Consuelo Quint.]]
As his role varies in every episode he appears in, Quint has different first names that are related to what his jobs are. For example, in "[[Yukon Con]]", he appears as Kusko Quint (a con artist who tricks Timon into stealing Pumbaa's gold so that he can have it), in "[[Palm Beached]]", he appears as Concierge Quint (a hotel manager who keeps throwing Timon and Pumbaa out of a hotel) and he appears as Captain Quint in "[[Ocean Commotion]]" and "[[Going Over-Boar'd]]".

In the episode "[[The Pain in Spain]]", two Quints are seen together. This can prove that there is more than one of him.

==Trivia==
*Excluding Simba's appearances in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', Quint is the only human to have met and had a confrontation with [[Simba]] (and vice versa), as seen in "[[Rome Alone]]".
*Quint's appearance and clothes as "Courteous Quint" in "[[Klondike Con]]" are a parody of America's 16th president, Abraham Lincoln a.k.a. Honest Abe including the hat and beard.
*Quint also has a habit of giving himself "nicknames", usually in relation to his jobs/roles in the various episodes he appears in. Ex. "Criminal Quint" as a robber, "Congo Quint" as a photographer, etc.
*Quint makes a cameo in the comic ''[[Go Fish!]]''
*Quint is very similar to [[Norman (Marsupilami)|Norman]] from ''[[Marsupilami (TV series)|Marsupilami]]'', as they both have varying roles with different first names relating to their jobs, they both have shaven faces, and they both serve as frequent antagonists, making them the archenemies of the heroes.
**He is similar as well to some villains in animation such as [[Pete|Peg-Leg Pete]], [[wikipedia:Yosemite Sam|Yosemite Sam]] from ''[[wikipedia:Looney Tunes|Looney Tunes]]'', The Red Guy from ''[[wikipedia:Cow and Chicken|Cow and Chicken]]'', or Rancid Rabbit from ''[[wikipedia:CatDog|CatDog]]'', being villains who have different occupations, or disguised as different characters (in the case of the first three), and likes to torture the main characters.
