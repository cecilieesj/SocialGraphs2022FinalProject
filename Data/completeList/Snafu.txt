He is designed to discombobulate enemy plans by any possible means; he will also thwart any attempt to capture him, and thus can only be caught by accident.

==Background==
===Personality===
Snafu is a mischievous, cunning, and conniving experiment. This is proven when he turned all of [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]'s plans to save the imprisoned experiments in [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]] against them, and also sabotaged [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]'s plans to turn all the remaining experiments from good to bad by swapping the tape of [[Angel]]'s song with Gantu's karaoke tape. However, his desire to foil plans seems to come from his programming, and he is initially unable to distinguish friend and foe.

Snafu seems to be somewhat sadistic, as he laughs every time he manages to foil a plan. Since he was programmed to sabotage enemy plans by any possible means, he is very resourceful, with even Jumba acknowledging that he can only be caught by accident. The only thing Snafu hates the most is having his own sabotage backfire on him. However, after Stitch revealed his love to Angel, Snafu became touched while shedding tears and changed his heart.

===Physical appearance===
Snafu is a small dark-green cephalopod-like experiment with a roughly reptilian face and white eyes. He has small limbs and a tail, black markings on his back, and six telescoping prehensile tentacles on his large dome head.

===Powers and abilities===
Snafu is a master at foiling any and all complex plans. He is also highly elusive due to his plan-foiling skills, and can only be captured or defeated by accident. He often uses his tentacles for mobility or gripping objects. His eyes can serve as magnifying lenses and has an incredible ability to tamper with machines.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 120 was the 120th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to foil any and all enemy plans at whatever cost. 120 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 120's pod was found by Jumba and kept in a shoebox under his bed.

[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] discovered 120's pod in the shoebox under [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s bed when she was searching around his room for any unactivated experiments to use in a rescue mission to free [[Stitch]]'s cousins on [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]]. However, Jumba took 120's pod from Lilo and revealed its design. 

Jumba warned Lilo not to use 120, as he was the worst experiment to activate when making complex rescue missions. Just then, [[Pleakley]] foolishly came in with a hose and sprayed water everywhere, which got 120's pod wet, activating the experiment. 120 ripped up the blueprints for Lilo and Stitch's rescue mission and then escaped through the pet flap.

120 remained near the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]], where he cleverly spied on Lilo, Stitch, and the experiments' plans for the rescue mission and sabotaged their obstacle course, which put a damper on things.

120 later foiled [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]'s plan to revert all of the rehabilitated experiments to evil by swapping the tape of [[Angel]]'s song with Gantu's karaoke tape. When the tape was played by [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] driving a stolen ice cream truck, everyone on Kauai became awestruck and laughed in amusement, thinking it was a prank, much to Gantu's embarrassment.

When Lilo, Stitch, and the experiments launched a rescue mission on the ship, 120 tricked [[Sample]] into imitating the ship's alarm to alert Gantu. 120 then rewired the ship's prison, causing it to trap Lilo and the rescue team.

However, 120, named Snafu, did not count on the prison trapping him as well. Though after hearing Stitch confess his love for Angel, Snafu cried because it really touched his heart, causing him to turn from bad to good.

Fortunately, Snafu was freed by Angel and Stitch, who also freed Lilo and the other captive experiments in their containment orbs. Snafu then foiled Gantu before the latter could recapture the experiments and escaped the ship with Lilo, the rescue team, and the released experiments.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Snafu, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Snafu participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down, due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.
