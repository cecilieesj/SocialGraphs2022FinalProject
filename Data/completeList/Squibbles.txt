'''Squibbles''' is a toy pet and [[Stuffy]]'s pet in ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. Squibbles was lost by his owner in a park but latched onto Stuffy. Stuffy was initially annoyed by Squibbles and considered him a pest, as he kept following him around and clinging onto his tail. Eventually, however, Stuffy became attached to Squibbles in return and adopted him as his pet.
