'''Imara''' is a character featured in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. She is a former member of the [[Outsiders]] and currently the strongest in the [[Lion Guard]] under [[Vitani]].

==Background==
Imara was originally born a Pridelander sometime during the reign of [[Scar]]. During his reign Imara, along with multiple other lionesses, were very loyal to Scar and supported his rule. For this reason, she along with all the other lions who supported Scar were exiled to the Outlands, by his nephew [[Simba]], after he defeated Scar in the battle for Pride Rock.

As a member of the [[Outsiders]], Imara was originally an enemy of Simba’s pride and the Pridelands, taking part in the plans of the Outsiders’ leader [[Zira]] to overthrow and assassinate Simba. However, during the events of ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', she and the other Outsiders (sans Zira, who refused, and [[Nuka]], who had already died) were persuaded by Kovu and Kiara to stop the fight and switch over to Simba’s side. Sometime after the reunion of the two prides, Kovu’s sister and the former second-in-command of the Outsiders Vitani, recruited Imara along with fellow former Outsiders Kasi, Tazama, and Shabaha, to become members of her Lion Guard (since Kion’s Lion Guard was away at the Tree of Life at the time). Due to her incredible strength, Imara was chosen as the strongest member of Vitani’s Lion Guard.

==Personality==
Imara is not only a lioness with great physical strength but also great inner strength as well. Like the rest of Vitani’s Lion Guard she is a fierce, but also brave and dutiful warrior committed to protecting the Pride Lands. She constantly challenges herself in order to both prove and improve her strength. This was shown when she challenged Beshte to push a rock with an elephant on it to the finish line, despite being fully aware that hippos are naturally much stronger than lions. This not only shows her confidence in her strength but also her extreme desire to challenge herself in order to prove how strong she is and to become stronger. This may also show a slight sign of over-confidence in her though. She can also be very stubborn as she, like her teammates, refused to step down from the Lion Guard even though Kion and his friends had the mark of guard, and had been the guard long before they were.

Despite this, she means well, and her attempts to challenge herself seem to not only be out of a desire to improve her skills but also to help her friends who she desperately wishes to support and be strong for. This shows that Imara is a strong-willed, brave, noble, and supportive friend to her teammates and warrior committed to fighting for her new home.

==Role in the series==
Imara appears in the series finale, "[[Return to the Pride Lands]]".

As Kion and his team are heading back to the Pride Lands, the group realizes that Vitani has formed her own Lion Guard where Imara was introduced. Vitani at first did not recognize Kion at first because of the scar on his face and being surrounded by an army of Outlanders. As Kion and Vitani's team clash into each other, Kovu and Kiara arrive towards the feud and stop the fight so that Vitani is able to recognize Kion while Zira has completed her journey through the Circle of Life.

The next day, Imara and the other members of Vitani's team spend the morning in the Lair of the Lion Guard just as Kion and Vitani clash into each other and after [[Azaad]] rescues [[Thurston]], he tells both groups to know whose Lion Guard is the best. During the challenge focusing on the Strongest position, Beshte challenges Imara to know who is best by pushing the rock into first place. During the competition between Beshte and Imara, Ma Tembo tells Beshte to avoid getting sunburn to which Imara progresses farther than Beshte to which she wins against him. After a tough battle, Kion lets Vitani's team win. When Kion releases the Roar, Imara and the rest of Vitani's Guard win the battle against Kion just as all the Pridelanders celebrate just as Vitani is now marked as the new protector of the Pride Lands just as Vitani and the rest of her Lion Guard spend their new lives as new protectors of the Pride Lands.

==Trivia==
* Imara is the first strongest lioness to be a member of the Lion Guard.
