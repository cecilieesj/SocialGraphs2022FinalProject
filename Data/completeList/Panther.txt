==Biography==
The Panther appears at the beginning of the episode, chasing after Timon and Pumbaa for unknown reasons, trying to eat them. Even though they manage to get rid of him for a while, he returns and continues his pursuit after them. They end up escaping into the hollow tree. Timon and Pumbaa initially want to escape by climbing the tree and jumping from bough to bough. However panther predicted this and chopped down all trees in their area with chainsaw. When they later try to escape, panther catches them and is about to chase them again so they decide to wait until the panther relents. While being trapped inside tree, Timon and Pumbaa try to entertain themselves in an attempt to forget their hunger. Days become months, and months become years, and still, Timon and Pumbaa refuse to venture out of the tree.

Finally, in 2090, after Pumbaa almost ate Timon, they decide that they will die as friends. They venture out of the tree and tell panther that they are ready to be killed and eaten. However, panther grown too old and tells them that he can only eat mush and drink prune juice. He also informs them, however, that he still can chase them, so they race off into sunset and the panther pursues them on his wheelchair.
