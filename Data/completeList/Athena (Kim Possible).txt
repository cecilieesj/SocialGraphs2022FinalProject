'''Athena''' is a character in the [[2019]] live-action Disney Channel Original television film, ''[[Kim Possible (film)|Kim Possible]]''. She is an advanced android built by [[Dr. Drakken]], formerly designed to get close to Kim Possible in order to steal her "spark", until she turned when Kim saved her from being destroyed after Drakken no longer had any use for her.

==Role in the film==
''"A new high school student Kim and Ron befriend who ironically also happens to be the ultimate Kim Possible fan. Her dream comes true when she finds herself tagging along on important missions and joining in on all of the action and adventure."''

==Trivia==
*The outfit Athena wears resembles Kim Possible's Season 4 outfit from the TV series.
*She is just like [[Bebe]] the Android that Dr. Drakken made to be perfect in the animated series.
**She is also similar to [[Eric (Kim Possible)|Eric]] from ''[[Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama|So the Drama]]''. Both are androids created by Dr. Drakken with a human appearance with the sole purpose of infiltrating Kim's life. Unlike Eric, who has no redeeming change of character or remorse for his actions, Athena ends up turning a leaf and becoming a genuine friend and teammate to Kim.
