== Physical appearance==
Wilbur is a Caucasian teen boy with short brown hair and green eyes. He wore a white shirt under a chef's, cook's, or baker's matching, buttoned jacket, blue pants, and white shoes.

== Background ==
He is an aspiring chef and baker. As seen in [[A Dark Score Evened]], Wilbur is on his way to class carrying a box of tiramasu when he encounters [[Rochelle (Fillmore!)|Rochelle]]. Fearing that she was up to no good, Wilbur begs her not to do anything to his tiramasu, since he spent the previous, whole night making it. Rochelle denies trying to do something to the pastry, saying that he just presumed she would, then asks if he thinks she is a monster. Hesitatingly, he nods and she becomes offended. Just as she is about to respond in unkind and threatens to destroy his tiramasu with kung-fu, [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] arrive just in time to stop her. After Fillmore threatens to use the same on her, Rochelle eases up and leaves Wilbur and his tiramasu alone. Wilbur thanks them and apprehensive that Rochelle might bother him again, he asks the Safety Patrollers to accompany him on his way to his home class.

In the midst of an interrogation with another bullied victim, [[Becca Embarcadero]], it is interrupted by someone in a ninja outfit, who causes a scene in the cafeteria by having [[Fiona Ashbury]] and her models splattered with grape jam. Fillmore and Ingrid gain on the mystery suspect into the school's kitchen. The suspect manages not to run into Wilbur, who pleads for no harm done to him and offers his tiramasu. Fillmore, Ingrid, and the suspect then continue outside.

After discovering messages left behind as a calling card once some sabotages were committed and Rochelle winds up being a bullied victim herself, Fillmore and Ingrid find Wilbur in the kitchen and tell him about what happened. They considere him to be at least a person of interest, if not an official suspect, and see him to determine whether he had anything to do with those or not. Wilbur says he wishes he could sympathize with Rochelle, but that wouldn't be true and that since she had it coming, maybe now she learned her lesson. Considering that Wilbur is a bullied victim, Fillmore tells him he had a motive for wanting to get vengeance. Wilbur replies that he also has an alibi, Becca, who Fillmore and Ingrid interrogate again next.

Coming to the conclusion that [[Stella Valenzia]] is the most likely suspect and saboteur, they find and chase after her when she wouldn't spill the whereabouts of the other victims. Following her into the Converted Center Control Room, they see that she didn't act alone. She, Wilbur, Becca, and fourth bullied victim, [[Grover Brady]], are all in on it. Subsequently meeting one another while in detention one Saturday, they decided to band together to give all bullies a taste of their own medicine and they hold Horace hostage, restraining him in a rolling chair. Before Wilbur is about to damage the control panel by dumping a pot of gumbo onto it, Fillmore induces him and the others to have second thoughts about it, because there are alternatives and better approaches to go about settling problems with bullies. He tells them they're better than that and they begin to reconsider. Not long after, Fillmore and Wilbur are featured on the front page of the X Middle School Examiner, with the former arresting the latter, as the latter and the three others are revealed to do detention time again.
