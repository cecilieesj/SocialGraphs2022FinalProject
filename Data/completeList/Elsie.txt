==History==
She is a golden-yellow tabby cat who associates with her fellow pet companion, [[Harry (Stanley)|Harry]], with whom she sings the theme for "[[The Great Big Book of Everything (song)|The Great Big Book of Everything]]" in every episode. She is shown to have more common sense than Harry, and is often annoyed by his antics. Despite this, the two get along with each other very well and often work together in sync.

==Trivia==
*It is stated in "[[Spelling Bee Situation]]" that Elsie weighs 10 pounds (a quarter of the amount of honey a beehive needs), whereas in "[[Under the Umbrella Bird]]", she is 18 inches long, excluding the length of her own tail.
