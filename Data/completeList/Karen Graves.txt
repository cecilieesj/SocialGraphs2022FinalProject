'''Karen Graves''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2013]] animated film, ''[[Monsters University]]''. She was [[Mike Wazowski]]'s teacher when he was young. She is a pink slug-like monster with brown twisted horns. She is voiced by [[Bonnie Hunt]].

==Role in the film==
Karen's only appearance is at the very beginning of the film, when she tells her students to put themselves in pairs before entering [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]]. Mike is unable to find someone, and has to go with Karen as his pair. Sometime later, when Mike enters [[Frank McCay]]'s door, Karen calls him and tries to get him out. When both McCay and Mike return to the factory unharmed, Karen demanded to know what Mike had to say for himself for such a dangerous stunt. She isn't seen again for the rest of the film.
