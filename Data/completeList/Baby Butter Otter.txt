Though she speaks a little bit, she is kind and friendly in every way. She can often be seen carrying a bottle. If there's one thing Butter loves to do, it's giggle. She does never really speak in full sentences, but her speech is fully advanced for her age. She likes to play with [[Scootch Raccoon]], who is only a bit older than her.

She's mostly happy and quickly joins a dance and often spins around on her bottom during dances. Butter is also pretty smart for someone her age, as she has found Mrs. Snootie's jewelry and convinced some fireflies to help her family find their way through the thick fog.

==Trivia==
*Butter's voice actress, Gina Marie Tortorici, could not read at the time, and therefore needed help with her lines. (It was revealed in a [[Disney Channel]] "Behind the Ears" interstitial that Jenelle Brook Slack, the voice of [[Jelly Otter|Jelly]], helped her with it by whispering Butter's lines to her and having her repeat it.)
