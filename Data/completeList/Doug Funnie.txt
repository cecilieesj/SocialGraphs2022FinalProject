He was 11 years old in the Nickelodeon series and 12 in the Disney series.

He was originally voiced by [[Billy West]], who reprised his role for bumpers and commercials.

==Personality==
[[File:O-DOUG-570.jpg|thumb|250px|The evolution of Doug's design]]
Doug is an extremely short-tempered, easily angered, and imaginative young boy who is often the target of being easily provoked or having a practical joke played on him. He is known for having strong moral values and always knows to do the right thing. He also is famous for his wild imagination, and often has various fantasy sequences in the series.

Doug has many friends, and his best friend is Skeeter Valentine. He met Skeeter on the day he moved to Bluffington, and they've been the best of friends since then.

When Doug first arrived in Bluffington, he fell in love with Patti Mayonnaise, one of the girls in his town. They have been best friends since they met, with Doug having a crush on her. By the end of the show, Patti tells Doug how she feels about him and decides to go on a "date-date" with him. Aside from Patti, Connie Benge has had a small crush on him in the Nickelodeon series, and asked him to go to the dance with her, with him trying to make up a story for her to say no.

Doug was a usual target for the school bully, Roger Klotz, to pick on. Roger would usually play practical jokes on him and call him names. Later on, Roger stops being as mean to Doug, and they become friends. Doug also considers Guy Grahm a rival for his love for Patti, however Guy does not notice this.

Doug's biggest flaws are pride and jealousy. His pride can usually cause him to deny anybody is better than him at anything such as Skeeter being genius and his pride can bring out the worst in him.

==Alter-Egos==

During Doug's many fantasy sequences, he took on the personality of many characters. The most famous one in the series was Quailman, which was a superhero that was just Doug wearing his usual outfit, but with a red "Q" on his sweatervest, a belt on his head, and briefs on the outside of his pants. Unlike most superheroes he often tried to fight without using physical force. Quailman is also a parody of Superman.

Another alter-ego of Doug was Smash Adams, a parody of James Bond. Adams was already a movie character in Bluffington, so Doug's fantasies were just him taking on the role. When Doug played Smash Adams, he usually had his hair slicked back, wore a white (or on some occasions, black) tuxedo, and spoke with a British accent.

Doug's third alter-ego was Race Canyon, a parody of [[Indiana Jones]]. Canyon only appeared four times in the series, with only one of the episodes being from the Disney series.

==Theme Parks==
Doug appeared in the stage show ''Doug Live!'' which lasted from January [[1999]] until May 2001 at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|the Disney-MGM Studios]]. Doug also appeared as a walkaround character at the Disney-MGM Studios around the time. Since [[2001]], he has been retired, but may make an appearance on a rare occasion, usually if another cast member is delayed. To date, he and Patti are the only characters from any show featured on One Saturday Morning to have appeared at the Disney parks.

An earlier costumed version of Doug has appeared at Nickelodeon Studios (which was in Universal Studios Florida until Nickelodeon Studios' closing in 2005) for special events from 1991 to 1995, when Nickelodeon still owned most of the rights to the show. As such, Doug was dressed in his Nickelodeon attire in Disney parks.

==Trivia==
*Doug is left-handed.
*Doug's favorite food is Banana Pudding.
*While he does appear bald, he has been mentioned to have hair in some episodes, suggesting that his near-bald appearance is just for artistic purposes.
*Doug is the only character in all the show's episodes due to the fact he's the protagonist and narrates all the episodes.
*Despite being bought out by Disney, Doug appeared (through redubbed animation with Billy West reprising the role) in a Nonstop Nicktoons Weekend bumper with [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]] in November 1996. He, along with Porkchop, Skeeter, and Patti, later appeared in Nickelodeon's "[[w:c:nickelodeon:Our House|Our House]]" music video for Super Bowl 50 in [[2016]], almost twenty years after the premiere of ''Disney's Doug''.
*Billy West (the original voice actor for Doug) was supposed to reprise his role in the Disney series, but declined to do it, so that is when Thomas McHugh stepped in. West did, however, reprise the role for the above-mentioned Nonstop Nicktoons Weekend bumper, and later in Toon Disney bumpers and promos in the 2000s.
*In the Japanese dub, he is voiced by veteran voice-actress Masako Nozawa, a.k.a. Son Goku and his sons (Son Gohan and Son Goten). Nozawa also voiced [[Timon's Mother]] in ''The Lion King 1 1/2''.
*In the Nickelodeon series, Doug wore a white short-sleeved shirt and brown shorts with red sneakers, but in the Disney version, Doug wore a white long-sleeved shirt and brown long pants with blue-gray sneakers.
*An earlier costumed version of Doug appeared at Universal Orlando Resort from 1991-1995.
*Doug and Porkchop appear as a cameo in the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' film on a billboard advertising "Funnie & Porkchop" law firm ("Your injury is not Funnie"). Oddly, the picture of them used was [[w:c:nickelodeon:File:Doug and Porkchop.png|stock art from the Nickelodeon series]].
