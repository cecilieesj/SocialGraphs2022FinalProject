'''Lamar Abudabe''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is a student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] who is occasionally friends with [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and the love interest of [[Constance Goldman]].

==Background==
Lamar Abudabe is a student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]]. Not much is known about him, but there are minor hints in various episodes. In "[[Miss Moose]]", he is shown to admire [[Moose Pearson]] for her sportsmanship, but was embarrassed when [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] corrected him after he called her her little brother. In "[[A Kosher Christmas]]", he chose to represent Ramadan, implying that he celebrates the holiday. In "[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Milo]]", he was chosen to be a judge at the Dental Hygeine-A-Palooza Poster Contest due to his perfect dental hygiene, implying that he is a healthily conscious young man.

He finally made a more prominent appearance in "[[Considering Constance]]" where it is revealed that he has a soft spot for [[Constance Goldman]] whom he would share a brief exchange with when they passed through the hallway. Constance finally asks him out, partially thanks to Pepper Ann, but also from her own gumption, and he happily accepts. He is even drawn to her more confident personality. By the end, it is implied that the two have officially become a couple.

Lamar only makes a non-speaking cameo in "[[The Finale]]", which takes place in an alternate [[2013]], where he is attending the middle school reunion. When Pepper Ann reunites with Constance, Lamar is seen standing behind Pepper Ann and reacts upon seeing her, implying that he still likes her.

===Personality===
Lamar is a very nice student and probably the only "normal" character on the show. He is shown to be very humble, especially when he realizes that he made the mistake of thinking that Moose was a boy and is slightly apologetic. He is also easily impressed with other people's talents and supports those who display them.

===Physical appearance===
Lamar is a tall, slender African American boy with a shaved head and purple glasses. He wears an orange shirt with basketball on it, purple shorts, white socks and black shoes with red soles.

==Trivia==
*Based on Lamar picking Ramadan, it is possible that he is Muslim.
*His last name is pronounced by Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
