'''Rainbow Unicorn''' is a minor character in the [[2015]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Inside Out]]''.

==Background==
Rainbow Unicorn is an actress and works at [[Dream Productions]]. She has starred in a dream sequence titled ''Fairy Dream Adventure, Part 7''. [[Joy]] loves Rainbow Unicorn in this production.

==Appearances==
===''[[Inside Out]]''===
Rainbow Unicorn is first seen when Joy, [[Sadness]], and [[Bing Bong]] sneak into Dream Productions so they could get an opportunity to see her in person; however, Joy is too captivated by the unicorn to even properly introduce herself. Later on, when Joy and Sadness attempt to wake up a sleeping [[Riley Andersen|Riley]] by infiltrating one of her dreams, Rainbow Unicorn accidentally appears on camera as she tries to sneak off with a plateful of cupcakes and other snacks. Some time later, she is seen onstage performing a dance number; however, the audience doesn't seem to be impressed at all. Her performance is then violently interrupted when [[Jangles]] bursts into the soundstage and causes mayhem.

==Trivia==
*Several of the boxes next to Rainbow Unicorn are marked "wigs", which may suggest her impressive hairdo is not as natural as it seems.
*She is the second [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] character to be a unicorn after [[Buttercup]] from ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.
