He is a student at [[Echo Creek Academy]] and [[Star Butterfly]]'s crush.

==Background==
===Personality===
Oskar displays mannerisms and typical behavior of a dropout student with very few prospects. He gets lost in his own little world and pays very little attention to the people or situations around him. Most of the time, he simply plays his keytar all day long, making up songs that seem to be based around his personal life. Despite all this, Oskar is a very friendly and relaxed person who has nothing, but nice things to say to his fellow classmates at [[Echo Creek Academy]]. Underneath his passive exterior, hides a sage-like wisdom and support that he is willing to give to others. He is shown to be absent minded as despite the fact that he has known [[Marco Diaz]] for quite sometime, he fails to remember his name and calls him "Mango".

===Physical appearance===
Oskar is a teenage boy of average height with tan-brown skin and longish brown hair that, in the first season, falls over his eyes. At the end of season two, he gets an undercut and by season four, he retains this hairstyle, though his sides have grown back slightly. When his eyes are visible, they are large and green; appearing slightly effeminate. Strangely, he has fangs which no one acknowledges. His usual attire consists of a brown t-shirt, red ascot, what appear to be torn grey shorts, and purple boots.

==Role in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]]==
===Season One===
Oskar makes his debut appearance as an extra in "[[Match Maker]]", before making his proper debut in "[[Cheer Up Star]]", where he is seen making some irritating music. When [[Star Butterfly]] first sees him, she falls head over heels in love with him and secretly gives him her number. Star spends the rest of the day waiting for him to call, but he does not until she is in the middle of a fight against [[Ludo]] and his minions. Later, he is once again vied after by Star, this time unintentionally, when she undergoes Mewberty, in the [[Mewberty|episode of the same name]]. Just like with everyone else, he does not seem to mind the strange supernatural things that happen in town.

===Season Two===
In "[[Girls' Day Out]]", Oskar reveals he has several keytars in the trunk of his car in case of emergency. However, he does not remember which of his keytars have batteries in them. In "[[Star on Wheels]]", he reveals that he pretty much lives in his car and keeps junk, food, and clothes in there. This was hinted at in the first season where he sings about how he hates listening to his mom and his mom's boyfriend; implying that he does not have a happy home life, despite his upbeat attitude. In "[[Starcrushed]]", he reveals to Star he dropped out of school to pursue his music. He was not aware until this episode that Star had magical powers and a wand and offers to be her "Mango" and that he would like to hang out with her over the summer, though he never gets the chance to.

===Season Four===
After being completely absent in season three, Oskar returns in "[[Britta's Tacos]]" where it is revealed that he decide to get a job at the titular food stand, along with Sensei Bradley; implying that he has matured slightly, though he still acts like a goof. He is very serious about his job, but fails to ban [[Janna Ordonia]] from the premises after getting easily duped by her after she simply denies that that is who she is. In "[[Mama Star]]", he offers his help to Star, Marco, Janna and [[Tom Lucitor]] by allowing them to use his car to traverse the magic realm; very happy to have helped his friends. He briefly appears at the end of "[[Cleaved]]" where the actions of Star and her friends resulted in Britta's Tacos sinking into an oil pit; essentially leaving him and Bradley jobless.

==Trivia==
*Despite the fact that Oskar plays his keytar right handed, he uses a left handed keytar.
*Oskar never seems to learn that Star has a crush on him, not that it matters, as she gets over him really quickly.
