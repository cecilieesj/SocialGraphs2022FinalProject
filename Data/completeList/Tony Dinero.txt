'''Tony Dinero''' is a wildly stereotyped Italian pet store owner and (apparently) opera lover in the [[1933]] animated short, ''[[The Pet Store]]''.

==Role in the short==
Tony Dinero enlists [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] to watch the shop while he's away at lunch. Unfortunately [[Beppo the Gorilla]] escapes from his cage and uses [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] as Fay Wray in a King Kong imitation.

==Trivia==
* According to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXZHQPyUf6U a segment of] [[Toon Disney]] [[Toonections]], Tony Dinero was stated to be the same person as [[Tony and Joe|Tony]] from [[Lady and the Tramp|''Lady and the Tramp'']].
