'''Transitron''' is a character who appears in the [[2013]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated special, ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''. He is a toy robot whom [[Jessie]] encounters at the [[Sleep Well]] motel.

==Background==
Transitron is a large toy robot whom Jessie finds at the Sleep Well motel. As a robot, he is capable of transforming into a vehicle for transportation. Not only he is capable of forming into one vehicle, but can also separate himself into smaller vehicles to escape. Transitron's vehicle form not only consists of one vehicle but also four vehicles when doing so.

When Jessie first met him, she explains to him that she was just trying to free him. However, realizing that the workers might return, she then requests Transitron to seal the box to avoid making the transport workers notice that the box is unprepared for transportation delivery.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''===
While sneaking past [[Mr. Jones]] after trying to be brave of herself in freeing the toys while discussing with [[Combat Carl]], [[Jessie]] opens a box where Transitron emerges. After opening the box, Transitron faces Jessie who explains to him that she was trying to save her. When Jessie decides to be sealed in the box Transitron was found. She then asks Transitron to seal her in the box and put the box on top of the other box, to which Jessie risks herself as Transitron puts the tape on the box to make sure the workers find out that the box is sealed. Upon seeing a female worker passing by, Transitron escapes which indicates that the workers are coming to put him in the box again. Jessie manages to free herself from the box, though.

During the credits, Transitron's separate vehicle forms are seen escaping with the other toys   as commanded by Combat Carl while Pez Cat tells the other toys that the transport has arrived into the Ship It transport truck.

===Other appearances===
A mock commercial shown in the [[2014]] ''Toy Story of Terror!'' DVD/Blu-ray release features a vintage-style toy commercial featuring Transitron fighting a kaiju in a metropolis to imagine if Transitron were depicted in a commercial from the dedade he originated at. In it, Transitron's operator commands him to destroy the kaiju destroying the metropolis to which the monster was destroyed successfully. The voices in this "commercial" are provided by Pixar animator, Dice Tsutsumi while the kaiju here in that same "commercial" is played by A.J. Riebli III.

==Trivia==
*Transitron's design pays homage to Japanese robot toys transforming into vehicles, which is known as ''Transformers''.
*Transitron's designer, Grant Alexander, is a fan of robots, where the production team made sure the toy is designed to be an accurate representation of toys from [[1984]].
*Dice Tsutsumi, who did the voices and played the operator in the mock Transitron commercial, also played the sushi chef Daisu Tsashimi from ''[[Cars 2]]''.
