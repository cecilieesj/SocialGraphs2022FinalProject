He is merely a memory being watched by [[Mrs. Andersen's Emotions|Mrs. Andersen's emotions]], who are attracted to him.



==Role in the film==
The pilot's first appearance throughout the film is during tne part after [[Mr. Andersen|Riley's father]] scolds [[Riley Andersen|his daughter]] for yelling at him and later when [[Mrs. Andersen's Emotions|Riley's mother's emotions]] are seen watching the Brazilian helicopter pilot in which the emotions are attracted to him. During the credits, it is shown that Riley's teacher has the same memory as her mother's, which represents her dreams of summer vacation after feeling disappointed by her students.

==Trivia==
*His only lines are "Come. Fly with me, ''gatinha''!". "Gatinha" is Brazilian Portuguese slang for a cute young girl/woman, but it is also Portuguese for a female kitten.
*In the Brazilian Portuguese dub of ''Inside Out'', he is referred to as the "Carioca Helicopter Pilot". "Carioca" means someone or something from the state of Rio de Janeiro.
*The joy emotion of Riley's teacher saying "Then it's off to the Bahamas with '''you know who'''" is a Harry Potter reference of Voldemort (You-Know-Who) Read more at: <nowiki>https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=949&t=36699</nowiki>
