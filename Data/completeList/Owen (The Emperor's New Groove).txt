==Background==
Owen, Pacha's next door neighbor, was going to appear in the early version for ''The Emperor's New Groove''. However, the character was removed from the film (along with Pacha's Father) and the scene got scrapped because it didn't seem to be working. However, on The Emperor's New Groove DVD, the scene where he found the MAK-4 while he was digging a hole for a tetherball court and throwing a party for Kuzco as a llama with Pacha's family is in the deleted scenes.
