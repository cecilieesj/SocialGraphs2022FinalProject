{{Quote|I was thinking of my [[Mirabel Madrigal|daughter!]]|Agustín standing up to [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]]}}
'''Agustín Madrigal''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s  [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''. He is the husband of [[Julieta Madrigal]] and father of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]], and [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]]. Having married into the family, Agustín has no magical gift of his own like Mirabel. However, his accident-prone tendencies allow his wife to continuously refine her healing magic.

==Background==
Agustín's life before joining the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal family]] is unknown other than that his biological family still lives in [[Encanto (location)|Encanto]]. Due to being accident-prone, Agustín often needed to be healed quickly and that led him to meet the community healer [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], whose magical gift was to heal people through her cooking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468685743098716160|title=Agustín's info|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref> Unlike how she quickly accepted [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]] as part in the Madrigals, [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]] never got along with Agustín and was skeptical that he would fall in love with her daughter since Agustín was not Abuela's first choice to marry Julieta, besides judged him harshly for his clumsiness. But Julieta loved Agustín so much that the two eventually married and he became part of the Madrigal family.<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 28, 2021|first=Jared|last=Bush|title=Agustin & Julieta|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1475710339551428610|website=Twitter}}</ref> 

Years later, Agustín and Julieta they had three daughters ([[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] and [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]]) together. In addition to becoming the brother-in-law of Félix, [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]], and [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]], is also the uncle of [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]], [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]], and [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]. At present, Agustín still does not get along with his mother-in-law because she does not approve of Agustín being married to Julieta and cannot understand why her daughter chose him, trying to exclude Agustín from much of the family's affairs and making him feel excluded like Mirabel.

===Official Description===
:''Agustín is somewhat a fish out of water, having married into the magical family. Awkward and accident-prone, he always has the best intentions, especially when it comes to his daughters.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/meet-the-characters-of-encanto/|title=“Encanto” Character Details Revealed|website=D23|last=Team|first=D23|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

:''Agustín is an accident-prone person. He may be a slightly awkward fish out of water who married into the Madrigal family, but he is the perfect husband to Julieta, who has to heal his injuries.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2021/09/30/how-the-magical-casita-in-encanto-is-a-new-kind-of-disney-castle/|title=How the Magical Casita in ‘Encanto’ is a New Kind of Disney Castle|website=The Nerds Of Color|last=Lee|first=Michael|date=September 9, 2021|access-date=December 18, 2021}}</ref >

===Development===
As with the rest of the Madrigal family, Agustín was designed to reflect "family archetypes that are immediately relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-11-29/encanto-explained-disney-colombia-consultants|title=‘Encanto’ is Disney’s first Latino musical. How the filmmakers got Colombia right|website=LATimes|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=November 24, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> Of all the characters in the film, Agustín was the one who underwent the most changes and designs before reaching his final version. The studio initially, in addition to creating Agustín as the protagonist, was also to be the head patriarch of the Madrigal family and the one who built Casa Madrigal. However, this was changed due to a field guide on Colombia telling the studio that the local communities are matriarchal and the studio wanted the story to feature women, which led to the creation of Alma as the matriarch and Mirabel as the protagonist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/encanto-hero-change-helped-story/|title=Why Encanto’s Big Hero Change Helped The Story|website=Screen Rant|last=Bradley|first=Bil|date=May 7, 2022|access-date=May 7, 2022}}</ref> During the creation process, Agustín in other concepts originally had a messier hairstyle and sported a long mustache. Similar to the final product, Agustín looked like a "city man", coming from "somewhere similar to Bogotá", being well-put-together and wearing a suit. This makes him a "fish out of the water" in the Encanto.<ref>[[The Art of Encanto]]</ref>

===Personality===
Having married into the family, Agustín has no magical gift of his own, and understands what it is like not to feel as though he belongs in the family. He tries his best to comfort his youngest daughter, Mirabel, due to her being the only Madrigal child (who was born in the family) without a magical gift. When he discovered [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]]'s vision of Mirabel and their family home being destroyed, Agustín grew concerned about what would happen to the family and tried to keep it a secret, with the well-being of his youngest daughter being the only thing in his mind as he wanted to protect Mirabel from any shame brought upon her by their family and community. 

Agustín shares a close relationship with his wife, Julieta, where the two support each other and do their best to look after Mirabel whenever she is upset or facing issues over not having a magical gift. Agustín is also aware of how [[Alma Madrigal|Alma]] treats Mirabel and is not afraid to stand up to his mother-in-law when she confronts him over keeping Bruno's vision a secret, saying that he was thinking about his daughter. This stems from how Agustín and Alma never got along and that she did not approve of him marrying her daughter, Julieta. All in all, Agustín loves all of his family members and is willing to protect them, despite his clumsiness.

===Physical appearance===
Agustín is a tall and slender Latino man who wears glasses, a white suit, and a blue vest and tie. He also has slick gray-and-black hair, a pencil-thin mustache, and brown eyes. Parts of Agustín's clothes symbolize his daughters - a flower on his vest for Isabela, one sock with dumbbells for Luisa, and the other sock in the style of Mirabel’s embroidery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468628565163855873|title=Agustín's Outfit|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Encanto]]''===
Agustín first appears with his family as they start their day and walk into the village. During "[[The Family Madrigal]]," Agustín and his brother-in-law, [[Félix Madrigal]] are introduced by Mirabel where Agustín shares a kiss with Julieta before he gets stung by a swarm of bees after dropping his axe into a beehive when attempting to chop wood.
