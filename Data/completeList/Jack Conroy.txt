Jack Conroy arrives in Alaska from San Francisco to look for his deceased father's mining claim. Conroy meets a musher named Alex Larson and Clarence "Skunker" Thurston, Conroy's father's buddy, who reluctantly agrees to guide Jack to his father's claim in the Yukon. When Jack encounters White Fang who has been cruelly treated by his owner, Beauty Smith, he rescues the canine from the jaws of death during a fight with a fierce bulldog named Cherokee. Aided by Alex, Jack nurses White Fang back to health, and the animal becomes a close companion to the men.
