==History==
===Background===
Dewey Todd was a [[Bellhops|bellhop]] who worked at the [[The Hollywood Tower Hotel|Hollywood Tower Hotel]] during the late-1930s.  In [[1939]] on Halloween night, Dewey was operating the elevator for four of the hotel guests:  [[Sally Shine]], [[Emeline Partridge]], [[Carolyn Crosson]] and [[Gilbert London]].  Tragedy struck however when a bolt of paranormal lightning struck the hotel's elevator shaft and caused the five people to be dropped down and killed.

Following this, the five victims were spirited away and trapped in the supernatural [[The 5th Dimension|5th dimension]] and bound to the hotel as ghosts.  In the 1990s, the hotel reopened and Dewey's ghost (along with the others) had encounters with new potential victims of the hotel.
==Appearances==
===The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror===
Dewey Todd is seen in the pre-show video for the Tower of Terror in the library.  His ghost is later seen in the hallway of the attraction, hithering guests deeper into the hotel.  Additionally, his likeness can be found in the 5th dimension scene.  At the end of the attraction, Dewey and the other ghosts bid guests farewell as they exit the Twilight Zone.

Dewey is sometimes identified as being the voice of the Hollywood Tower Hotel employee giving the safety-spiel.  This is likely due to his identification as the bellhop who ran the elevators and the voice being dissembodied (with Dewey being a ghost).

==Other Appearances==
===[[Tower of Terror (film)]]===
The son of hotel magnate Dewey Todd, Sr., '''Dewey Jr. '''worked as a lowly bellhop at the Hollywood Tower Hotel prior to and during the events of the film. Being clumsy and sloppy, he often bumped into people and thus earned the ire of Gilbert, whom he has a rather lukewarm relationship with. Guilt-ridden, he blamed himself for the Halloween incident, later vowing to his grandson that he will "do something right", as he wasn't able to perform his duties properly as a porter and elevator operator when he was alive, let alone manage the hotel.

Dewey was also initially indifferent if not outright hostile towards Buzzy and Anna. At first, he and the other ghosts warded them off the hotel, wary of any intruders attempting to disturb them. He later lashed out at Buzzy for selfishly profiting from their deaths, bitterly comparing himself and the others to "zoo animals" should they be featured in the newspaper, but had a change of heart and jubilantly expressed his optimism when Buzzy and Anna promised to help bring closure to their fates.

=== Pendragon (book series) ===
Dewey Todd is a minor character in ''The Never War,'' the third book of the ''Pendragon'' series by [[D.J. Machale|D.J. MacHale]]. He works as a bellhop and elevator operator at [[The Manhattan Tower Hotel]]. He is shown to have trouble with his job on occasion, and it's implied that he only has a job because his father owns the hotel. Dewey is also mentioned in ''The Pilgrims of Rayne,'' the eighth book of the same series, to have been reported missing after lighting struck The Hollywood Tower Hotel.

==Notes==
*Dewey is probably the only bellhop in the Tower of Terror who is not consistently portrayed as being malevolent, particularly in the film.
*In Behind-The-Scenes Video, for the making of; Tower Of Terror's Pre-Show, Dewey is shown wearing a Blue Bellhop Attire, rather than the Burgundy Suit which he wears in the Film as well as other Bellhops in the Attraction. This was likely so it would come out on the Black & White Video of the Twilight Zone Episode.
