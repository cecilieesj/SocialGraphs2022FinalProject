}}'''Ed Grant''' is a character of ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''. He is partners with [[Hulk]].

==Biography==
Ed wins an invitation to see the first showing of Stark Enterprises' DISKs, small devices to imprison villains in a codified form. After [[Loki Laufeyson]] captures [[Avengers|the Avengers]] and other heroes in DISKs, Ed and other four kids are affected by a defective bio-code that allows them to briefly summon the heroes from the DISKs via a D-Smash. Ed's bio-code allows him to D-Smash Power heroes like Hulk.

Ed is a superhero fan with a lot of knowledge about heroes and villains. His favourite is [[Captain America]].

==Trivia==
* Ed's name is a reference to [[Edward Norton]], who played the Hulk in the film ''The Incredible Hulk''.
