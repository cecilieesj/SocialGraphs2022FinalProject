'''Ephraim and Mira Bridger''' are posthumous characters in the [[Disney XD]] animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. They are the parents of [[Ezra Bridger]].

==Background==
Ephraim and Mira had a son, [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]], who was born on the day that the [[Galactic Empire]] was founded. After the Empire took control of their home world of [[Lothal]], a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, Ephraim and Mira became revolutionaries, sending out underground broadcasts that spoke out against the Empire's activities on their planet. They were supported by Lothal's governor, [[Ryder Azadi]]. As a result of their activities, the Empire sent Stormtroopers after Ephraim and Mira, and the soldiers took them away to be imprisoned on the charge of treason.

*'''Ephraim:''' Ephraim was opposed to the rule of the Galactic Empire on Lothal and spoke out against them, at the cost of his own freedom. Even while imprisoned, he and Mira continued to fight for others, up until the point that their lives were lost in ensuring other prisoners could escape from Imperial captivity.
*'''Mira:''' Mira was an outspoken opponent of the Empire's rule of Lothal, leading to her arrest and imprisonment with her husband. Even in prison, however, she and her husband continued to stand up for other people, up until the point that they were killed in the prison revolt that they led so others could gain their freedom.
