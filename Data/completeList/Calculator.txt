The '''Calculator''' is one of the major characters from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''.

==Role in the film==
He is a calculator who lives with [[Toaster]] and the other appliances belonging to [[Rob McGroarty|Rob]] (the Master). He spends most of his time living in the junk drawer with the [[Hearing Aid]] (whom he apparently doesn't get along with), and is often taken out every [[April 14]] to assist Rob with his taxes.

Sometime later, when the Master's son [[Robbie McGroarty|Robbie]] (the Little Master) gets abducted, the Calculator manages to use the Hearing Aid's readout to determine where the Little Master had been sent. The Calculator then assists Toaster and his companions on their mission to travel to [[Mars]] and rescue Robbie.

The Calculator navigates Toaster and the gang to Mars with the use of heavy duty coordinates downloaded through Compy and into him by [[Wittgenstein]].

After rescuing Robbie, the Calculator returns to Earth with everyone else, including the Hearing Aid's [[Supreme Commander|long-lost twin brother]] and [[Tinselina]], and during the "[[Home Again]]" sequence, he is seen in the junk drawer playing poker with the two Hearing Aids.
