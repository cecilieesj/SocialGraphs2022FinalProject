==Trivia==
*If you walk Flare, log off, and log back on, unlike other puffles, you will still be walking him.

*Despite being a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Puffle black puffle], you cannot play ''[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Cart_Surfer Cart Surfer]'' with him.

*Certain people have mistook Flare's wielding mask as a hat.

*As of November 2010, there is a Flare power card in Card-Jitsu. When a penguin plays it, the delta coat and the delta fedora appear on them, and then the elite spy phone appears in their hand. The penguin then calls Flare who blows a ring of fire in the air and hops through it onto the opponents head.

*Flare used to be a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Bait_item bait item] before the EPF, so if you used a cheat program to get him in your inventory, you will be banned.
*Flare debuts in Who Framed Roger Rabbit only in a wallpaper for reference Flare
