{{Quote|I am evil! Have I made myself clear?!|Shego}}

'''Shego''' is the secondary antagonist, and occasional anti-hero, from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Kim Possible]]''. She frequently fights [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] (Kim's primary combatant and most dangerous opponent). Under contract as his sidekick, [[Dr. Drakken]] is her usual employer, although she has occasionally worked with other villains. Just like Drakken, she reformed herself at the end of the series.
==Background==
Shego has four brothers, [[Hego]], [[Mego]], and the [[Wego Twins]]. When Shego and her brothers were young, they were struck by a rainbow "comet" while in their family treehouse, granting them superpowers. Shortly thereafter, they formed [[Team Go]], a crime-fighting family in the mold of a classic superhero team. Together, they took on the responsibility of defending Go City from the forces of evil. However, according to Hego, the more Shego fought villainy, the more she liked it. Shego herself mentioned that her main reason for leaving was that she became fed up with her brothers' incompetence (so it could have been one reason or the other, or more likely, both).

After she quit the team, she found employment with [[Dr. Drakken]] because he supposedly pays well. Between the time that Shego left Team Go and her first encounter with Kim Possible, she had eleven countries swear out warrants for her arrest. It was revealed in "[[Stop Team Go]]" that Shego was a college graduate with an unspecified degree in Child Development, allowing her to become a substitute teacher in [[Middleton High School|Middleton High]] after she turned good due to Jack Hench's Attitudinator, a device that makes good guys evil and vice versa.

===Physical appearance===
Shego has an athletic and slender yet curvaceous build and her skin has a pale faintly green look. She has arched eyebrows, long thick black hair, and slanted, forest green eyes. She always wears green and black clothing. Her normal attire is a green and black jumpsuit.

===Talents and skills===

*'''Energy Manipulation:''' Shego is endowed with a superpower: the ability to generate bright green-colored glowing energy with her hands. This energy can be used to heat or melt anything she touches or fired as a directed energy attack ranging from near-laser-like precision to a destructively concussive blast. However, the blasts are non-fatal to living things as whenever she hits someone with them, they only knock them back. Originally, Disney described Shego's bright green flames as being purely concussive in nature, although in later episodes, she was shown using her flames to burn or melt things. These powers were first stated by the show's official Disney website as being generated by her gloves making them a weapon rather than a superpower. However, this fact was retroactively changed during the second season, when these abilities were revealed to be a true superpower resulting from exposure to the rainbow-hued comet which also empowered her four brothers. Of course, the official website was run by a different team from the creators, so the canonicity of any details was suspect and prone to change by the show's creative team.
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' In addition to her bright green glowing energy blasts, Shego appears to possess great durability that allows her to survive situations of calamitous destruction that would've probably killed other characters. In the Season 3 Finale, ''So the Drama'', she was kicked into a live electrical signal tower, electrocuting her before collapsing on top of her. She came out of the incident with only slightly torn clothes, a kick mark, and frazzled hair.
*'''Stealth Tactics:''' Shego is an expert in all kinds of fields, with infiltration and sabotage as her specialties.
*'''Martial Arts:''' Possessing extensive martial arts skills. Her impressive fitness and agility, her abilities rival the skills of her nemesis, [[Kim Possible]]. Even her physical fighting attributes are a match with Kim but they were no match for her in her battle suit.
*'''Expert Pilot:''' She also seems to be an expert pilot, having been seen piloting Drakken's flying car on several occasions as well as a jet plane in ''So the Drama'', and the Go plane in "[[Go Team Go]]".
*'''Teaching Skills:''' In "[[Stop Team Go]]", it is revealed that Shego has a degree in child development. It does not say how she got it or if she went to school for it.

=== Personality ===
Shego is fearless, sarcastic, tough and condescending towards almost everyone in her life. She's smart, and is sensible when things go sour. She has many times sarcastically remarked on how Dr. Drakken's scheme will inevitably end in failure, either by his own hand or by Kim Possible. Despite this, Shego goes along with the scheme to do whatever she can to make it work, showing that she has a sense of loyalty towards those she works for, even if common sense would say to give it up. Shego has a hard time accepting if Drakken's scheme, in all its absurdity, would work in any way. Yet she often gains some free entertainment from it.

Shego is also temperamental. She is rather quick to anger, though she does have the composure to keep herself restrained when someone pushes her buttons. But whenever someone pushes her beyond her breaking point, she enters into a fury.

Although evil, Shego occasionally has some reservations. For instance, she seems to despise hurting animals or anyone who can't fight back. This comes from the fact that she has a sense of personal honor; she objected Dr. Drakken and Motor Ed from stealing a wheelchair from a crippled boy, and she refuses to harm children. On the animal side, she wondered what happened to the fish when she and Drakken emptied the Great Lakes, and when Ron dropped her into an alligator pit, she didn't fight them at all. She also tends not to waste her time against others she deems are beneath her.

==Relationships==
Shego is a mercenary for hire, most often shown to be in the employment of [[Dr. Drakken]], although on occasion she has worked with and for other villains. Most notable is her partnership with Se√±or Senior Junior, for whom she was hired to instruct in the ways of villainy in the episode "[[Two to Tutor]]" and of whom she is shown to be unusually tolerant. Shego does not appear capable of love, kindness, or compassion, and viciously punishes Drakken after he suggests she is "going soft."

===[[Dr. Drakken]]===
[[File:Partners (1).png|thumb|left|250px|Shego with Dr. Drakken.]]
Shego's relationship with Dr. Drakken borders on bizarre. Early on in the series, she is shown to be more respectful toward the mad scientist, however, as time goes on, she seems to take an increasingly dominant role in the partnership, going as far as to bully her "boss" into abiding her wishes. She is often hypercritical of Drakken's plans and openly mocks his decisions, seemingly tolerating Drakken's antics for the 'mocking-gold' his schemes grant her.

The two have demonstrated a certain amount of deranged fondness for the other, as Drakken even refers to her in "[[Go Team Go]]" as a member of his "evil family."

Although Drakken is smarter than Shego, when it comes to science, Shego is in many ways smarter than Drakken in other areas of life.

===Family===
Her relationship with her brothers is less than stellar. It was not seen how well she gets along with her youngest brothers, the [[Wego Twins|Wegos]], but she shows open disdain for her two other brothers, [[Mego]] and [[Hego]]. She apparently used to get along well enough with them to be part of [[Team Go]], however, Hego claimed that the more Shego fought villainy the more she liked it.

===[[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]===
[[File:So The Drama (32).png|thumb|left|250px|Shego fighting Kim.]]
Most of Shego and Kim's confrontations result in hand-to-hand combat. She constantly taunts Kim about her lack of fashion sense or whatever else she can think of, though Kim usually taunts her back in the same manner. She also taunts Kim about her youth, addressing her by childish nicknames such as "Kimmie," "Princess," "Cupcake," and "Pumpkin."

Even though Shego is Kim's rival, Shego seems to have a certain degree of fondness and respect for her foe. For instance, she has openly declared that she and she alone will defeat her, thus she is willing to save Kim's life if someone else is about to take her out. They even became close, though temporary, friends, in "Stop Team Go". In that episode, upon reverting to her evil self, Shego seemed to reminisce over their friendship. On some level, Shego and Kim share a mutual respect for each other stemming from their rivalry.

=== [[Ron Stoppable]] ===
Shego confronts Ron almost every time when Kim is around. Unlike Kim, Shego most often tends to ignore Ron, and like Drakken, doesn't call him by his name, rather as "the sidekick". Shego seems to not bother with Ron due to his bumbling personality, though at times she does remark on how he and Kim together actually make an effective team. 

When Ron single-handedly defeated Warhok and Warmonga with Mystical Monkey Power, Shego was astonished and commented how "the sidekick stepped up, monkey-style."

=== Warmonga ===
Warmonga earned Shego's contempt, when she appeared out of nowhere and replaced her as Drakken's sidekick. It grew even worse, when Warmonga refused to mock Drakken despite his apparent buffoonery. Finally, she gladly made Warmonga her enemy, when she nearly defeated Kim Possible, and cited she will be the one to defeat her. During their second encounter, they remembered each other clearly, sharing an equal contempt to one another.

===Professional===
Throughout the course of the series, Shego has teamed up with several villains, both with and without Dr. Drakken: [[Se√±or Senior, Junior|Se√±or Senior Jr.]] and [[Se√±or Senior, Senior|Se√±or Senior Sr.]], [[Duff Killigan]], [[DNAmy]], [[Motor Ed]], [[Hank Perkins]], [[Frugal Lucre]], and in ''[[A Sitch in Time]]'', [[Monkey Fist]].

Out of the other villains she has worked with, only Se√±or Senior Jr. has earned Shego's respect. Junior's father originally hired Shego to tutor him in villainy. After a rough start, Shego eventually found that Junior is actually a good listener and they grew rather close as a mentor and student. They teamed up once more for Senior's birthday, still showing a clear respect for each other.

Although Shego prefers to work as a hired hand, she is the only villain in the series to actually succeed in taking over the world, with assistance from a magical time monkey and careful planning and support from her future self. In the possible future world, known simply as The Future, Shego is known as The Supreme One.

===Romantic===
Throughout the series, Shego has demonstrated a habit of picking up muscular males with deep tans at resorts. She briefly showed interest in Martin Smarty, although this had more to do with him being one of the five wealthiest men on the planet than an emotional connection. During her time as Miss Go, she had shown an interest in Steve Barkin. Neither of these relationships held her interest for long, although she seemed somewhat touched when Barkin visited her at the lair until he started singing for her. In the series finale, it is strongly hinted that she eventually entered into a romantic relationship with Drakken, but there's no actual confirmation if that really happened.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Although not being a meetable character, Shego appeared in the now-defunct [[Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure]], at the [[Mexico Pavilion]] along with [[Dr. Drakken]].

==Trivia==
*Her real name, along with those of her brothers, was never revealed. However, "Shego" means "One With Fire", which is very suitable for her.
**Her last name is indeed "Go," as revealed in [[Stop Team Go]]. During the brief time she was good, Shego taught at Middleton as Miss Go.
***Interestingly, when she carves a heart into Dr. Drakken's lair in [[Emotion Sickness]] under the effects of the Moodulator, her initials are "SG," hinting at her last name as Go before the events of Stop Team Go.
*Shego has been arrested at least once prior to [[Tick-Tick-Tick]], with her booking number was "11734".
*Before her origin was explained, fans speculated that she wasn't really human and was a she-predator.
*Shego is much more evil than her employer [[Dr. Drakken]]. When Drakken tried out [[Jack Hench]]'s evil detector, all of his concentration barely rated "playground bully," whereas Shego pegged the meter with a single touch.
**In one future, Shego conquers the world using time travel, becoming The Supreme One.
**However, Shego's evil is nothing compared to Ron's when the Attitudinator swapped his goodness with Drakken's evil.
***As evil Ron created a device to negate her powers, Shego has a fear of Ron's dark side as he is WAY more competent as a villain than Drakken.
**Ironically, despite her significantly higher evil personality, Shego also seems, to some degree, to have a moral compass, as demonstrated in ''Steal Wheels, A Very Possible Christmas, Kimitation Nation, October 31st, Mother's Day'' and ''The Big Job'', for example. While Dr. Drakken seems eager to steal Felix's optimized wheelchair, Shego opposes the idea, questioning whether Drakken would really stoop low enough to steal from a handicapped teen, although she still went along with it when Drakken reminded her that they're evil. While on Christmas vacation, she offers to pay a resort attendant with her credit card, only to find that Drakken fully paid for her vacation, for which she expresses gratitude towards him. When Drakken proposes the idea of cloning her, Shego presents to him her contract in which under it forbids any use of her DNA and she refuses to breach her contract. When Kim lied to her parents and Ron, Shego expresses disbelief and disappointment in her for not telling the truth to her parents and best friend. When Drakken accidentally leaves his mother behind on the train, Shego expresses great concern for her well-being in addition to never expressing her true nature towards her. When Se√±or Senior Jr. breaks Shego out of prison to help him commit a series of crimes in honor of his father's birthday, she expresses gratitude towards him.
*Shego appears in only one episode without Dr. Drakken: "[[Adventures in Rufus-Sitting]]".
**As mentioned in her debut, Shego is a criminal for hire; she works for Drakken consecutively because he pays her. As Drakken would have no interest in the chip Rufus swallowed, Shego likely took a job from someone else.
*She is Kim's most regularly fought villain.
*An action figure of Shego was available at McDonald's.
*On several occasions, she was seen doing something which could be described as "filing her nails" were she not wearing gloves.
**This is most likely Shego's way of saying she is bored or doesn't care.
**It may be possible her gloves truly do have claws on them and she's sharpening them.
*Shego has cried twice during the series, but each time she was not herself: In "Emotion Sickness", she was under the control of the Moodulator, and in ''Stop Team Go'' she was under the effects of the Reverse Polarizer.
*Shego has been known to be virtually fearless. The only times she displayed fear was in the Seniors' alligator pit. She also feared Evil Ron, who had the technology to render her powers useless, when he threatened to dump her into a shark tank if she did not submit.
*Her favorite color is likely green because virtually everything she has ever worn throughout the series had an ample degree of green in it, especially her signature outfit.
**This is further explained when she took over the world and forced her subjects to wear outfits of green and black based on her signature outfit.
*Shego and Mego are the only members of Team Go who have pouches on their ankles. A few exceptions would be when there are a few frame errors in "[[Stop Team Go]]", where one of the Wegos has one too.
*Miss Go, the "good Shego," and Steve Barkin's short-lived relationship may have stemmed back to their voice actors previously working together in ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' where Nicole Sullivan voiced [[Mira Nova]], and [[Patrick Warburton]] as the title character.
*In the episode "Car Trouble," it is revealed that Shego owns, or at least has gotten, (probably via stealing) a large gun that is capable of shooting out a lethal and highly corrosive purple acid or slime that can dissolve everything it touches.
*Although it is not outright pinpointed exactly, it has been confirmed that Shego is in her early 20s.
*The trademark energy that Shego is known for is probably radioactively-based due to the glow she and her brothers can produce when using their respective powers.
*Shego is apparently very flexible as she once kicked one of Drakken's synthodrones in the respirator when it seized her in a bear hug from behind.
*Her pallid skin tone complexion is a very light yellow, although it appears different in different tones when in darker aspects of light.
*Shego has been shown to have the ability to use her powers without her gloves.
*Shego calls Kim by her childhood nicknames like Pumpkin, Cupcake, Kimmie, and Princess.
*She has worn 3 2-color swimsuits throughout the whole series.
