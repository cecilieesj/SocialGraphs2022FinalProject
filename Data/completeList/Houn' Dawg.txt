==Background==
His first comic appearance was in "It's Music?", released in [[1964]], along with his owner, Hard Haid Moe. In the comic, Fethry Duck tapes Moe's song to participate in folkloric festival. In the 1960's and 1970's, he was frequently used in Disney Studios comics, along with his owner. However, he and Moe would eventually disappear from North American and European stories, but became popular in Brazil, where they even had their own title (Urtig√£o) from 1987 to 1994. In Italy, their appearances have become more frequent during the 2000's (decade) and they have gained a small Italian figurine.
