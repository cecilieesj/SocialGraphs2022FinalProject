'''Boma''' is a cape buffalo who makes his first and only appearance in ''[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures|A Tale of Two Brothers]]''[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures|.]] He selfishly hogs a water hole during a drought.

==Appearances==
===[[A Tale of Two Brothers]]===
Boma was first mentioned when [[Ahadi]] had been told by a leopard that Boma and his herd drank up the only water source left in the [[Pride Lands]] and they won't let other animals near it. He was then part of Taka's plan to get [[Mufasa]] in trouble with his dad. When Mufasa came to the final water hole in the Pride Lands, Boma asks him what he wants. Mufasa asked Boma to share the waterhole with the other Pridelanders until the rains will come. Boma wasn't sure on this idea of sharing, but then Taka came up from behind him and roars. Boma wants to know what he's doing and Taka told him that he's enforcing the Lion King's orders and if he doesn't listen to Mufasa, he shall face him in a fight. Boma angrily complains how Ahadi send his sons to hunt him down. He accused Mufasa of deciding to fight him. Mufasa denies this, but Boma doesn't listen to him and chased him. Rafiki urges Mufasa to run off and they ran away with Boma after them.

Rafiki begins to slow down on his running, but Mufasa picks him up and carries him on his back. As they were running, Rafiki saw a log in the distance. Mufasa became confident and jumps to it easily. Boma misses the jump and fell into the ravine. Mufasa told Boma that he himself fell into the ravine once. Boma roared at Mufasa for revenge, but Mufasa told him that they don't need to fight because they're brothers in the circle of life. Boma ignored him and continues to insult him and say that the other cape buffalos will get Taka. Mufasa confusingly watched out into the distance and saw Taka laughing and rolling on the ground. Just then, three cape buffaloes from Boma's herd came out from the grass and begin chasing Taka and attacking him carelessly.

Later on, an elephant was asked by [[Ahadi]] to get Boma out of the ravine.

===[[How True, Zazu?]]===
Boma made another appearance in this book where he and other animals were asked to stop the invasion of the ants in the Pride Lands. Boma and Pembe gives a massive push and send the ants off the falls.
