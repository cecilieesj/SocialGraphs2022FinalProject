'''Nathaniel Pietro "Nate" Barton''' is a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character that appears in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', played by Jaiden Stafford and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', played by Cade Woodward.

Cooper Barton is the youngest son of [[Hawkeye|Clint Barton/Hawkeye]] and [[Laura Barton]]. He's the sibling of [[Cooper Barton|Cooper]] and [[Lila Barton]]. His first name is the masculine form of Natasha, after [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow]], while his middle name is a homage to [[Quicksilver|Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver]].

He lives at the Barton Family Farm with her family. Nathaniel and his family are not in any government files, which is why the Barton Family Farm is used by [[Avengers|the Avengers]] as a place to hide and lay low.

In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Nathaniel and his family have a  picnic outside their house with Nathaniel playing baseball with Cooper. Nathaniel, alongside half of all life in the universe, later died at the hands of an [[Infinity Gauntlet]]-wielding Thanos; but was restored to life 5 years later, when the [[Hulk]] used the [[Infinity Stones]] that him and the Avengers retrieved from alternate timelines, to undo [[Thanos]]' work.

==Trivia==
*In the Ultimate Marvel comics, Clint and Laura Barton's younger son is named Lewis Barton where he is their middle child. Lewis, along with his mother and siblings were murdered by Black Widow.
*As of ''Avengers: Endgame'', Barton is now named after two people who have sacrificed themselves for his father.
*Nathaniel is the youngest individual in the MCU to know sign language.
