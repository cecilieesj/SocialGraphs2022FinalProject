==History==
He is a former student in [[Justin Russo|Justin's]] delinquent class and the most seen out of the other students. Felix caught the [[Captain Jim Bob Sherwood|Captain Jim Bob]] submarine out of [[Mason Greyback|Mason's]] mouth. He usually leads the delinquents in cheers. He helped [[Alex Russo|Alex]] and Justin out of a terrible fate. Occasionally, he picks up Justin when they are both leaving somewhere. Felix finds Alex cute. He was the only one to be able to take the wand out of the plasma ball making him the "chosen one."

Felix lives on the same 13th floor with Alex and [[Harper Finkle|Harper]] in "[[Wizards of Apartment 13B]]" and loses his wand in "[[Get Along, Little Zombie]]", where Dexter (which is [[Gorog]] the King of Darkness in disguise) comes up the elevator and reveals that he took it, then he convinces Felix to come to the dark side. He later does Gorog's bidding until he was freed. Also, it is seen he has a crush on Alex, as he kind of flirts with her. Felix is portrayed by Frank Pacheco.
