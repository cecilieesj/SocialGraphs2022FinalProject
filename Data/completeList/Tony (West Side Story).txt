'''Tony''' is one of the two main protagonists in ''[[West Side Story]]''. He is a young man from [[New York City]] who has been trying to start fresh after serving time in prison and hopes for a better future.

==Background==
===Personality===
Tony is implied to have had a terrible past before incarceration straightened him out by making him more humble and reserved. He is concerned with keeping on the straight and narrow and tries to avoid conflict. Upon meeting [[María Vasquez|María]], he begins to take bigger chances with trying to meet her despite the threat of her brother [[Bernardo Vasquez|Bernardo]] and the [[Jets]] finding out about his tryst. His whole life gets turned around for the best as he begins to devote the rest of his life to being with the girl he loves, both figuratively and literally.

==Trivia==
*Prior to [[Ansel Elgort]] portraying Tony, he was played by seven actors. When the original Broadway show opened back in [[1957]], Tony was portrayed by Larry Kert and then by Don McKay when the show opened on the West End the year after. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, Richard Beymer portrayed him with his singing dubbed over by Jimmy Bryant. In the [[1980]] Broadway revival, he was played by Ken Marshall, Matt Cavenaugh in the [[2009]] revival, and then by Isaac Cole Powell in the [[2020]] revival.
