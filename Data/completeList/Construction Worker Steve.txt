==Appearances==
===''[[Up]]''===
Steve is a construction worker, working with the person who drives the dump truck that collided with Carl's precious mailbox. After the truck collides and topples with the mailbox that Carl made with his wife, [[Carl Fredricksen|Carl]] becomes aghast, and becoming even more appalled when Steve tries to help fix the mailbox. Carl impulsively tries to shove the worker with his walking cane but instead hits him, giving him a bloody injury on his forehead.

Everyone stops, including the cars, and almost everyone comes to Steve. Carl is shocked for what he did, and hides in his house with his detached mailbox. When he peeks out of the window, the boss of the construction site is looking at him. Carl soon goes to court, and is thereafter deemed a "public menace" for assault. This incident is used to put pressure on Carl and make him leave his house. However, Carl leaves ''with'' his house anyways.
