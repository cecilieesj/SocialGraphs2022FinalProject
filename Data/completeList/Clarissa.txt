==Background==
Clarissa Corgi is the snobbish neighbor who likes to spy on "the annoying gang of trouble." Together with her owner Hugo, she makes life difficult for her neighbors. The puppies will never see balls or chew toys that end up on her side of the fence again.

===Personality===
Clarissa is a snobby, self-centered dog who has the mentality of an elitist "proper British" aristocrat. She is condescending towards those who are not of her social status, referring to them as "ruff-raff" (a play on the derogatory human term "riffraff").

===Physical appearance===
Clarissa is a short and stout Corgi with tan-and-beige fur, a black nose, brown eyelids and large ears. She wears a burgundy collar with white pearls in it.

==Role in the series==
[[File:Clarissa Corgi.png|thumb|150px]]
Clarissa first appeared in the episode "[[Dog's Best Friend (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dog's Best Friend]]", bossing around her human to satisfy her needs, with [[Dylan]] wondering if taking care of a human is a great idea based on how easy Clarissa's life is with Hugo.

In the short "[[Ransom Pups]]", she annoyed [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]] with her terrible singing and had a rubber chicken squeak toy thrown at her. Clarissa then decides to mutilate the toy and sends one of its legs back to Dolly. She then proceeds to roast it over a barbecue grill when Dolly tries to get it back, which creates an ever escalating back and forth of threats and acts of spite between the two. Dolly threatens to cut up a topiary of Clarissa with hedge clippers, then Clarissa ties the squeak toy to a set of balloons and gets it dipped in honey after shooting it down, which attracts some angry bees to it. Dolly continues to destroy her topiary statue each time she damages her toy until she threatens to bulldoze it. Clarissa finally gives up Dolly's rubber chicken, but reveals she has kept the other leg out of spite, leading to the two charging at each other and then getting stuck in a honey pot after the collision. The two are then forced to hear Hugo's horrible singing while bees threaten to sting them.

In the episode "[[Who The Dog Do You Think You Are?]]", her first speaking role, she spies on the Dalmatians and learns that Dylan might be royalty due to his resemblance to the Prince of Dalmatia portrait in their house. She then schemes of a way to become royalty herself by being Dylan's "royal consulate", banishing his siblings from the house and tricking Dylan into signing a marriage certificate and made duplicates of the certificate knowing Dolly would try to stop the wedding. She soon learns, however, that the Prince of Dalmatia is not a Dalmatian, meaning she was going to marry a commoner. She freaks out and quickly shreds the certificates, breaking off the engagement and imploring her minions that they must never speak of this again as she exits the house. She then finds out the Prince of Dalmatia painting is a cheap portrait sold by a human street art vendor while walking in London.

In the episode "[[Winter Funderland]]", Clarissa, Prunella and Arabella go check out the winter party in the Dalmatians' house and Clarissa immediately starts complaining, especially about the lack of fondue and the entertainment. When the temperature gets too cold they leave with [[Dizzy & Dee Dee]] asking if they can join them, but Clarissa refuses on the basis that they are "ruff-raff." She gets her comeuppance later when Dawkins and Dolly clear out the gallons of water in the house by draining it into Clarissa's water pipe system. While she is trying to enjoy some fondue prepared by Hugo with her cohorts and mocking Dolly's party some more, a massive buildup in the water pipe causes it to burst sending her flying and presses her against the ceiling as the water shoots out like a geyser.

In the episode "[[May Contain Nuts]]", she laughs at Sid's constant failed attempts at getting to the nuts in her backyard. Later when Sid convinces Dolly to leap on the feeder and she breaks it after getting on top of it, Clarissa yaps that there is an intruder in her yard repeatedly.

In the episode "[[Poetry Scam]]", [[Diesel]]'s cone picks up her voice as she says, "Who do those Dalmatians think they are? Probably not even purebred."

In the episode "[[The De Vil Wears Puppies]]", she sees [[Cruella De Vil]] kidnapping the Dalmatian family, and realizes that Hugo has ordered Cruella to get rid of them and turn them into a fur coat. Feeling guilty, she says, "I may despise Dalmatians, but no human treats any dog like that!" She finally gets revenge by barking at Cruella and chasing her [[Cruella's car|car]] to save the Dalmatians. Later, Pearl, Dylan and Dolly come to the rescue, but Dolly sees Clarissa on the car's back door trying to save their family. After Cruella has been defeated and sent back to jail, Clarissa realizes she was wrong about the Dalmatians, so she forgives them and the bus comes to send them home safe and sound.

==Notes==
*According to concept art, Clarissa and her entourage of Arabella & Prunella are collectively known as the Chelsea Gang.
