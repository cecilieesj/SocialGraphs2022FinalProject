'''Hitashi''' is a character in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is a snow monkey part of [[Yuki]]'s troop.

==Background==
Hitashi is shown to be kind and friendly to his family. However, he doesn't speak much.

==Role in the series==
===''[[The Accidental Avalanche]]''===
Hitashi is first seen bathing in a hot spring with his family when [[Makini]] is devising a plan to ask the snow monkeys to know a shortcut to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. When [[Anga]] plans to ask them, he and his family notice Anga approaching due to their sensitivity to large birds. Hitashi and his family throw snowballs at Anga, thinking she is a threat; Anga yells at the snow monkeys to stop, but they refuse to as she retreats.

Hitashi and his family notice [[Kion]] doing a disadvantageous plan to go through the mountain, caused by the venom affecting his temper, just as the snow monkeys run in terror just as the Guard rescues them from the avalanche caused by Kion (the hot springs the snow monkeys were bathing at is also covered during the avalanche). Kion then tells the frightened snow monkeys about Anga being gentle to them to which they agree to calm down. Kion then apologized to them for causing the avalanche across the snowy mountain to which the monkeys accept Kion's apology as there are other hot springs across the snowy mountain area to which Hitashi's mate [[Yuki]] tells the Guard to find hot springs safe for the snow monkeys to which the Guard agrees to help the snow monkeys find a new home without trees.

Just as the snow monkeys follow Anga to their new hot springs their leader Yuki requested, they end up bathing at the new hot springs bigger than their old one. Just as Hitashi and his family witness flying squirrels bothering the snow monkeys, Bunga tells one of them named "Tafu" to stop bothering the snow monkeys to which Tafu agrees. However, the Guard only notices the snow monkeys have left due to them in fright.

Anga then sees Hitashi and his family in fright as they all fall deeper in the snow. [[Bunga]] then accidentally falls into the snow where the snow monkeys fell at just as [[Fuli]] asks Anga to lift them out of the hole to which Anga refuses at first. Just as Anga plans to tell the snow monkeys not to panic while she rescues them and Bunga, Hitashi and his family accept Anga's trust that she will rescue them. Anga, however, manages to rescue Hitashi's family from the hole just as Yuki praises her for her help. Just as Anga agrees to find a new home for the snow monkeys, Kion's team ends up having fun with the snow monkeys in their new home.

==Trivia==
*"Hitashi" means "soak" in Japanese.
**Interestingly, Hitashi's voice actor [[Andrew Kishino]] is of Japanese descent; snow monkeys are also native to [[Japan]] in real life.
