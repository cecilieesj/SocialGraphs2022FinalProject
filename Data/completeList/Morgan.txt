'''Morgan''' is a character from ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]'' and student at [[Norrisville High]] who made her debut in "[[So U Think U Can Stank]]". She is the leader of the [[Dancing Fish]] and is the team's only member to not be [[Stank|stanked]]. She also makes brief cameos in "[[Viva El Nomicon]]" and "[[Monster Drill]]", in which she had a non-speaking role in the former.

==Personality==
Morgan rarely shows emotion, only slightly smiling whenever she's dancing or watching others dance. She's sassy, cold, and seems bored most of the time, even admitting it--right after the Ninja showed up--in "Monster Drill". Not even being referee for the [[Wave Slayers]] competition excites her. In "Escape from Detention Island", she gets detention for "shaking her booty in a no booty shaking area", but she doesn't seem to be guilty and instead is annoyed.

Never taking things lightly, she is annoyed that her dancing team starts crying when Howard sends them off the stage in "So U Think U Can Stank", and finds it ridiculous that a skeleton is teaching Home Economics class in "Nukid on the Block". Also open for revenge, especially after being sent out before they actually performed, she makes fun of Howard when he and Randy have to act for the talent show.

==Physical Appearance==
Morgan has Red Violet hair tied in a side right ponytail with blue scrunchie, Dark Green eyes she has green patch on her right cheek and her lip is red lipslick. She wearing her black crop top, blue bolero jacket. On her wrist she has Two pair of light red wristband each on her wrist. Blue jean with rolled on the left, brown belt and dark blue sneakers.
