'''Sofia''' is a character in the [[Disney+]] original series ''[[Baymax!]].'' She is a Hispanic 12-year-old girl who learns to accept menstruation as a normal thing for a girl her age thanks to [[Baymax]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Sofia is an exuberant and confident 12-year-old who has faith in her own abilities. However, like any other girl, she is shy about her body going through changes. This implies that her confidence stems from her trying to hide her insecurities and her fears of growing up. It is through Baymax's intervention that she learns to embrace all aspects of herself big and small.
