==Appearances==
===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
Misty first appeared in the episode, "[[Season of the Sea Witch]]" after the climactic battle between [[The Sea Witch|the sea witch]] and the [[Pirate Princess]]. The witch gets the upper hand and prepares to blast the Pirate Princess right before [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew arrive with the [[Rainbow Wand| rainbow wand]]. Quickly [[Izzy]] throws the rainbow wand over to The Pirate Princess and the latter finally blasts the Sea Witch, transforming her into the beautiful Misty the Wonderful Witch.

Misty reappears in the episode, "''[[Cap'n Croak!]]''," Bones believes he has turned [[Captain Hook]] into a frog, but [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew aren't very certain this is the case and knew if anyone on [[Neverland]] that could help with magic, it would be Misty. The pirates reached Misty's cottage and inform her of their dilemma. Misty tries to revert the spell but nothing happens. Suddenly the frog leaps off with [[Mr. Smee]], [[Sharky and Bones|Sharky, and Bones]] chasing after the frog before Misty could inform them that the frog was not Captain Hook. Misty used her magic to locate the real Hook for Jake and his crew could rescue him.

Misty returns in the episode, "[[Misty's Magical Mix-Up!]]," Jake and his crew pay a visit to Misty's cottage. While entertaining the young pirates, Misty accidentally triggers the Shadow Wand, reverting Misty back into the evil Sea Witch, who plans to turn the Pirate Princess into a gold statue once again. The Sea Witch proves much more powerful thanks to the Shadow Wand, but teamwork by Jake and his team helping the Pirate Princess sees the Shadow Wand destroyed. The Sea Witch, now powerless due to the destruction of her Shadow Wand, confesses the reason she wanted to turn the princess to gold is that she refused to be her friend when they were children, claiming the cruel pranks she played on the princess were jokes only to make her laugh. The Pirate Princess forgives the Sea Witch for her actions and becomes friends once again, transforming the witch back into Misty the Wonderful Witch.

Misty makes a nonspeaking cameo in the episode, ''[[Smee-erella]]'' attending [[Red Jessica]]'s pirate convention. She could be seen conversing with [[Captain Flynn]]. Later, the duo is seen dancing during the pirate waltz.

In the episode, "[[The Never Land Coconut Cook-Off]]", Misty was a contestant in the Coconut Cook-Off. Captain Hook uses Misty's magical recipe book to cheat in the cook-off accidentally conjuring up a giant soufflé monster that kidnaps Izzy and carries her to [[Belch Mountain]]. Fortunately, Jake, Cubby, and Skully along with Misty follow them to save her. They use Izzy's popcorn machine to create a loud noise to pop the soufflé monster, this works and Izzy wins the Coconut Cook-Off.

Misty reappears in the episode, "[[Witch Hook]]". After Captain Hook transforms into a witch after coming into contact with the sea witch's magic mirror and using his newfound power to turn Jake into a coward, Jake and his crew ask Misty to revert the spell, but Hook's magic proves too powerful for Misty. However Misty knew that the waters of Wash Away Falls could break the spell.
