'''Jean Pierre''' (known as '''J.P.''') is a stork and a character in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[T.O.T.S.]]''. He is a T.O.T.S. baby deliverer who speaks in a French accent.

==Background==
===Personality===
J.P. is very egotistical and always thinks of himself as top deliverer. He loves to look at his hair every chance he gets. He looks down on Pip and Freddy as baby deliverers because they aren't storks. J.P. has shown his softer side. J.P. also believed winning was more important than anything else, until the annual Easter Egg hunt, when he gave away his win to Pip and Freddy, who cared more about Percy the Peacock than winning.

It was later shown that J.P. also prioritized flying over taking care of a baby. After discovering he had never passed his Baby Skills test, Captain Beakman was forced to demote him to Junior Flier until he passed the test. With the help of Pip and Freddy, and admitting he didn't pass the test by himself, he figured out how to make a baby happy on his own. He then earned back his rank of Super Duper Flier.

In Season Two, J.P. becomes a "proud papa" by adopting a very mischievous puppy named Lucky. On T.O.T.S. picture day he wanted his son Lucky to match him perfectly, but realized later it was more important to make his son happy rather than being picture perfect.

===Physical Appearance===
J.P. is a stork with a long reddish beak. He has black hair with a bon. J.P. wears his T.O.T.S. uniform, which is a blue shirt with white buttons.
