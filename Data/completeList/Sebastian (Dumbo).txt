'''Sebastian''' is one of the main characters in Disney's [[1985]]-[[1987|87]] television series ''[[Dumbo's Circus]]''.

==Personality==
Sebastian isÂ an alley cat who is usually reduced to janitorial duties and likes to nap any chance he gets. He sometimes tricks others (usually [[Q.T.]]) to do his own work, but sometimes his tricks backfire on him.

Sebastian was with Dumbo and Lionel when they first started out. According to him, his mother asked [[Mrs. Jumbo]] if Dumbo would watch over him.

Among the only ones who consider Sebastian a friend and can actually tolerate him are Q.T. and Matilda Dinkum.

During the side show segments of the series, Sebastian has a ventriloquist dummy called Sly with him. According to Sebastian, Sly seems to work on his own. But with others like Lionel, Sly appears to work like a real ventriloquist dummy. Their act usually ends with a frustrated Sebastian putting Sly away in his box, with Sly protesting against it.
