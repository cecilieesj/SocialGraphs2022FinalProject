}}'''Weasel''', also known in some stories as '''Scuttle''', is an antagonist in the Disney comic book series, and the right-hand man of [[Pete]].

Slightly stupid and dull, this character has the appearance of an anthropomorphic weasel (actually more like a dachshund), with a long snout which has a shaggy beard that hides his mouth.

Weasel was created by [[Paul Murry]] to keep Pete with some partner to talk to, but who allowed Pete to remain as the boss (unlike [[Sylvester Shyster]] or [[Eli Squinch]]).
