'''Nana Possible''' was a recurring character from the animated television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''. She was the mother of [[Dr. James Possible|Dr. Possible]] and [[Slim Possible]], mother-in-law of Dr. Ann Possible, and paternal grandmother of [[Kim Possible]], [[Jim & Tim Possible|Jim and Tim]], and [[Joss Possible]]. Her real name was never mentioned.

==Background==
Much like her granddaughter, she had excellent martial arts skills, having trained in "Pang Lang Quan Kung Fu" in a Shaolin Monastery, to a level of mastery that surpassed even her granddaughter's martial art skills.

She always called Kim by her given name of Kimberly and never shortens it. She also believed at first that Kim's "saving the world" is just a phase and will grow out of it, little knowing that Kim's saving the world is actually a lifestyle. She also refused to see that Kim is now a teenager, and always dressed her in sweaters as she thinks Kim's habit of exposing her midriff isn't a good idea.

When Nana wanted to ignore something, she would turn her hearing aid off, such as when Kim tried to justify her being a hero.

At first, Kim felt that this was because her grandmother was behind the times and didn't understand her. It wasn't until [[Dr. Drakken]] pitted them against each other through a mind-control signal in the hearing aids of all of Miami's senior citizens that Kim learned the truth.

It then became apparent that Nana's objections came from the fact that she knew how dangerous such a lifestyle could be and that even grandparents would like something better for their grandchildren. She may have also seen a little too much of herself in her granddaughter (which she had known all along because she had been Kim's age once). But it wasn't until Nana could see that Kim was more than capable of holding her own that she generally became more accepting.

==Appearances==
===''[[Kim Possible]]''===
Nana Possible first appeared in "[[The Golden Years]]" when Kim and her family came to visit her at the Florida Retirement Home. Kim tries to skirt Nana's old fashioned over-protectiveness while she unravelling Drakken's latest plot during her visit. Nana fell under Drakken's mind control when he accidentally patched into on the frequencies of hearing aids. His original plan was to control the minds of teens through MP3 players. Kim came to Nana's rescue, and once free of mind control she fought alongside her granddaughter and came to terms with accepting the life she had chosen.

Nana Possible made other appearances in "[[A Very Possible Christmas]]" where she celebrated Christmas with the family and attended Kim's graduation in the [[Graduation|episode of the same name]].

===[[Kim Possible (film)|''Kim Possible'' (film)]]===
In the live-action movie, Nana Possible is less old than her animated counterpart and has red hair like her granddaughter instead of gray. Instead of living in a retirement home, she lives in a house that has a secret dojo arena. Like the original character, Nana maintains the same traits, such as being a skilled martial artist.<ref name="Oh My Disney">{{Cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/news/2018/05/25/live-action-kim-possible-cast/?cmp=smc%7C1556153468|title=6 New Actors Join the Cast of the Live-Action Kim Possible Movie|website=Oh My Disney|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>[[:File:Kim Possible - Interviews On The Shego Green Carpet|Kim Possible - Interviews On The Shego Green Carpet]]</ref>

Nana first appears when a troubled Kim comes to visit her. She teaches her how to fight with a bo staff, and tries to help her come to terms with her problems adjusting in school and her rivalry with her new friend, [[Athena (Kim Possible)|Athena]] (who was at the time working for Dr. Drakken in his latest scheme against Kim). When she was presumably kidnapped by [[Dr. Drakken]] and [[Shego]], Nana and Ann accompany Kim and Ron on a rescue mission and save Athena.

==Trivia==
*Although close captioning and pronunciation have her Kung Fu Style as "'''P'''ang Lang Quan", it is most likely "'''T'''ang Lang Quan", or Northern Praying Mantis Styleâ€”literally ''Praying Mantis Fist".''
*She is the only character to call Kim by her first and middle name.
