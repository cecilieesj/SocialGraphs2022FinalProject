'''Puff''' is the pet poodle of [[Suga Mama]] on ''[[The Proud Family]]''. [[BeBe & CeCe Proud]] enjoy playing with Puff. Unfortunately, they don't realize that Puff is a living animal who has feelings and pain receptors. Suga Mama goes hysterical if he is missing. Since Suga Mama can't see very well, he is a seeing-eye dog of sorts. [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] is shown to dislike Puff, but Oscar did help when Puff got lost.
