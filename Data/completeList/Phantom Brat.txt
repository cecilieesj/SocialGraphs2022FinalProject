[[File:Blot2.gif|thumb|124px|The Phantom Blot's daughter]]'''Phantom Brat''' is the unofficial name of the [[Phantom Blot|Phantom Blot]]'s daughter, who only appeared in a couple of comics. It is unknown if "Phantom Brat" was her actual name, since it was shown in quotation marks in the back of a comic book issue. An innocent character, she looks much like her father, but her hood is wavy, giving the impression of a ponytail, with a big pink bow. All of her toys wear masks similar to hers.

Apparently she was going to be a regular character, but this did not happen. This may be because writer's felt The Phantom Blot's character was too softened in the presence of his daughter.

Her only appearances were in the last panel of "The Big Fall" in Mickey Mouse Adventures #7, and in "A Phantom Blot Bedtime Story" in #8. Last she was seen, she was put in the care of [[Mrs. Fragmuffin]].
