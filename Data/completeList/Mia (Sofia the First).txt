'''Mia''' is a bluebird in the 2013 [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Sofia the First]].''

==Background==
===Personality===
Helpful and kind, Mia is a bit of a birdbrain, misunderstanding figures of speech and taking them literally. For example, in the episode [[Just One of the Princes|"Just One of the Princes"]], when Robin gave Sofia advice by saying "An early bird catches the worm", Mia takes it literally and asks what Sofia needs a worm for.

Even so, she can have a witty comeback to say, often toward [[Clover]].

===Physical Appearance===
Like her friend [[Robin (Sofia the First)|Robin]], Mia also has an orange beak, but instead she has blue and white feathers.
