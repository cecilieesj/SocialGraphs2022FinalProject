|personality = Funny, poor sense of humor|shorts = [[Chibi Tiny Tales]]}}'''Benny''' is a minor character in the [[Halloweentown (series)|''Halloweentown'' series]] (except for ''[[Halloweentown High]]''). He is a skeleton taxi driver who has a habit to make jokes. In ''[[Return to Halloweentown]]'', it was revealed that his full name is '''Benjamin C. Deadman'''. He took a liking to being called Benny after [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]] called him it when she traveled back in time to the founding of [[Halloweentown (place)|Halloweentown]]. According to Marnie, Benny has a rather poor sense of humor; his jokes are usual skeleton-related, but no one actually finds them funny, though they laugh to be kind.

[[Kalabar]] temporarily corrupted him, so he could kidnap the Piper children to be used as ransom to ensure [[Aggie Cromwell]] did not interfere with his plans. However, [[Sophie Piper|Sophie]] sicced a dog on him, forcing Benny to flee. He was later freed of Kalabar's influence and bid farewell to the Pipers when they returned home to the mortal world.

Under the Grey Spell, Benny becomes a human that is all skin and bones. After being reverted to normal by [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]], he said "Talk about going on a crash diet!" This could imply he crashes a lot (on purpose) or he was referencing the fact he turned back into a skeleton.

In ''[[Return to Halloweentown]]'', Benny served as Marnie and Dylan's lift to their new home at [[Witch University]]. He mentioned the 1000 year anniversary of Halloweentown to them, wishing them a pleasant time. A past version of himself gave Marnie a lift to Cromwell Castle after she "predicted" that he will become a taxi driver in the future.

==Trivia==
*The letters of Benny's full name are in alphabetical order (B,C,D).
*He makes an appearance in all the movies that actually feature Halloweentown itself; he did not appear only in ''[[Halloweentown High]]''.
*He is possibly as old, or older than, Agatha Cromwell and Professor Periwinkle.
*Since he has been around for centuries, he considers everyone a kid.
