'''Attila''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2010]] animated feature film, ''[[Tangled]]''. Along with [[Vladimir]], he is one of the [[Pub Thugs]]' muscle, and wears a large metal helmet that covers his entire face. He has a tattoo of a cupcake on his right upper arm, alluding to his love of baking and his dream of opening a bakery.

==Appearances==
===''[[Tangled]]''===
Attila is first seen at the Snuggly Duckling and participates in the brawl over which thug turns in Flynn Rider. Soon after, Attila and the other thugs are inspired by Rapunzel to reveal their dreams. He shows Rapunzel his talent for baking during the song. Later on, Attila helps Flynn escape prison by hitting the Captain of the Guards with a frying pan. He is last seen watching Flynn escape with Maximus the horse.

===''[[Tangled Ever After]]''===
In ''Tangled Ever After'', he's briefly seen in the crowd of Rapunzel and Eugene's wedding.

===''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''===
Attila is seen in [[Corona Castle]] during Eugene's verse of "[[Life After Happily Ever After]]". He, along with most of the main thugs, appears to have become one of Eugene's closest companions outside of Rapunzel and Maximus. During the scene, Attila is shown shaving his helmet as if it were a beard.

===''[[Tangled: The Series]]''===
In "[[What the Hair?!]]", Attila is seen tending to the bar when Eugene visits the pub to confide in the thugs. When Big Nose arrives shortly afterward, Attila sarcastically calls him "lover boy", and groans at the idea of hearing more of his gushing about his lady-friend Assunta.

In the short "[[Prison Bake]]", Attila recalls a time before he met Rapunzel, in which his fellow Pub Thugs were arrested and sent to the dungeon. Depressed, Attila lamented on what to do, until eventually deciding that he'll save them using his best talent: baking. After creating an arsenal made of baked goods, Attila bypasses the castle guards and infiltrate the dungeon. Before he can rescue his friends, however, he is confronted by his rival, Ludvig the local baker. The two adversaries battle, but Attila ultimately wins the fight when Ludvig tastes his breadstick and determines it's too sweet, unintentionally enraging Attila. He then uses his latest baked creation — the "coo-key" — to free the other thugs.

In "[[Under Raps]]", Attila briefly appears during the opening, sobbing into a handkerchief into a response to hearing Big Nose's love story.

Atilla opens his own bakery in "[[One Angry Princess]]" and is then later accused of destroying [[Monty (Tangled)|Monty's]] sweet shop. He is almost exiled from the kingdom, only for [[Rapunzel]] to prove his innocence.

In "[[Big Brothers of Corona]]", Big Nose notes that business has slowed at the Snuggly Duckling since Attila partnered with Monty. At the end of the episode, however, [[Lance Strongbow|Lance]] becomes the pub's new chef.

==Trivia==
*Attila's original voice actor, [[Byron Howard]], was also a co-director on ''Tangled''.
*Despite gaining a new job at Uncle Monty's shoppe, later episodes released after "One Angry Princess" still show Attila working at the Snuggly Duckling's bar.
*Attila wears a helmet for two reasons: He is "repugnant" underneath and also, he is incredibly shy.
