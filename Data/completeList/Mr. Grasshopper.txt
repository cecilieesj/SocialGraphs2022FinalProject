==Personality==
Mr. Grasshopper is a giant talking grasshopper. He was once an ordinary grasshopper before he and the other bugs were magically turned life-size. He is like a grandfather figure to [[James Henry Trotter]]. He dresses and speaks like a highly sophisticated and obsequious gentleman, as he also wears a monocle. He is quite tall and can jump real high and fly. His long legs give him enhanced speed and strength. The others often look to him for answers, but [[Mr. Centipede]] does not care for him, which leads to the two constantly argue until they eventually became friends. He is skilled in playing the violin.

==Appearances==
===''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''===
He first appears when a transformed James comes inside their hiding place. When Centipede cuts the [[Giant Peach|peach]] loose and it falls in the ocean, James thinks of capturing seagulls to use them to make the peach fly. Grasshopper shows an interest in what [[New York City]] offers and lends a helping hand throughout the journey. When they get attacked by a [[Robot Shark|robot shark]], its torpedoes break the strings supporting the seagulls, and Mr. Grasshopper takes James on his back and flies up to retrieve them. When a couple of shark torpedoes are fired at James and Grasshopper, [[Mrs. Ladybug]] flies up and whacks the shark torpedoes away with her pocketbook.

Later, when Centipede accidentally steers the peach of course to the [[North Pole]], Grasshopper furiously confronts him about it and gets the other bugs to turn on him. When Centipede challenges him, Grasshopper sternly kicks him in the face, knocking him out. He sarcastically points out that they only need to determine their coordinates and use triangulation to get to New York. Unfortunately, he then points out that there's no hope since they don't have a compass (mostly because although they simply need to go south, a compass is required to determine which direction *is* south). He later feels remorseful when Centipede jumps into the frozen lake, thinking he committed pesticide because of what he did to him. When Centipede returns with one, he and Grasshopper make up, and the two become good friends.

Before arriving in New York and to make up for what he did to Mr. Centipede earlier, Mr. Grasshopper relieves him of his post by bringing him a chair and blanket and plays the violin in solace, but James hears and was pleased to listen, after learning it was Grasshopper all along. They are later attacked by the [[Rhino (James and the Giant Peach)|Rhino]], and he and the other bugs are separated from James during the attack, but later reunite with James, who had by then transformed back into his normal form. They also help get rid of James's cruel aunts, [[Aunt Spiker|Spiker]], and [[Aunt Sponge|Sponge]]. [[Miss Spider]] binds them in her string and Mr. Grasshopper spins them around with his feet, making the string cover them completely. After the kids eat the peach, the bugs make it's core home for them and James and becomes a grandfather figure to James.

In the credits, a newspaper headline shows Mr. Grasshopper as a professional violinist, playing in concerts around the city.

==Trivia==
*In the book, he used his limbs to make the sound of a violin, instead of actually playing one.
*The way Mr. Grasshopper let James ride on his back to retrieve the seagulls is inspired by the birthday candle.
