Milo distracted Pamela while [[Oscar Fishtooth|Oscar]] untied Bea ("[[Hooray for Hamsterwood]]"). Pamela reappeared when she decided to visit Milo in Freshwater. She and Milo were talking to each other on the computer, when she told Milo she's coming to visit Milo. Milo took all the water from the tanks so Pamela won't find out that Milo's a fish.
