Abnor is first seen getting out of a cart from a caravan. [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] mistakes him for Abis Mal and tackles him, until he realizes he is not his enemy. Abnor later runs into Abis, who talks him into changing history and making him become Sultan of [[Agrabah]]. At night, Abnor and Abis kidnap [[Hamed]] and throw him in an hourglass-shaped portal. The two then make Hamed's people, [[Abu]], and [[Iago]] work for them. When they see that Aladdin and Hamed are back, Abnor fights with Abis for the hourglass. Aladdin takes the glass from them and they tackle him, making the glass break and create a giant portal that sucks them into it, where a battle ensues. Later, [[Genie]] takes them out and Hamed and his people are about to find Agrabah. Abnor is excited about his idea, but everyone glares at him. He then suggests that he will live in the desert as an outcast and runs away.
