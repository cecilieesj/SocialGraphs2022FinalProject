[[Minnie Mouse]] first mentions to [[Mickey Mouse]] that she got him "private finishing school lessons", and later presents Mickey to Wadsworth, as the door was already open to let him in, also saying he will be Mickey's instructor. When he walks in, Mickey timidly says hi to him, and offers him a handshake, but Wadsworth instead holds up his pinkie, in the delight of his pleasure to say "charmed" then wipes his hands with a cloth of wipe, then Minnie wishes Mickey toodaloo and slams the door shut. After that, Wadsworth looks at Mickey, then when more knocks at the door happen, Wadsworth opens the door, but it turned out to be just [[Goofy]] and [[Donald Duck]] wanting to invite Mickey to land a whopper at the fishing banks, but since they got other plans to do, he declined and slammed the door in their faces. Then Wadsworth pulls Mickey by the ear to a room where he can teach him new things and baby steps of being a gentleman.

Mickey's first test is given as a eye test if he can see the letters attached to the billboard, but he responds "how now, brown cow" instead. Then, he is given a tea-sipping test as Wadsworth shows him how to drink tea the correct way, but Mickey Mouse manages to poke his eye instead. Then finally, Wadsworth gives him a swap decide guess test where Mickey has to guess the right-sized fork to eat a salad with, but he manages to pick all wrong, with Wadsworth having to whip his hand with a fly smacker every time he got the answer wrong. After all the training, he throws Mickey's iconic red shorts and yellow shoes in a trashcan, but Mickey almost wanted to pout and whimper about it, even though he didn't and instead hid his nakedness with his hands.

After the change shift, the camera is minorly cut to Minnie vacuuming her house. Then Wadsworth suddenly calls to her "ahem, presenting... Michel Francois Mouse" while he pulls the curtains, a tuxedo Mickey Mouse appears, after the gentleman Mickey says, "how do you do", Minnie is delighted about it and is impressed about Mickey's fancy gentleman stance. After that, Wadsworth says "you'll get my bill" to assure Minnie that he will pay her well, and he leaves the house, done with his job for the day.

== Trivia ==

* He is obviously named after the American psychologist {{WikipediaLink|Edward Thorndike}}, as he studies behavioral instincts just like him.
* He seems to wipe his gloves with a wipe. This gives an impression to the cleanliness trope of {{WikipediaLink|Clean hands}}, and also deals with several gentleman wiping their hands to remove dust, dirt, or mud away from troubles.
* Wadsworth's design is eventually recycled, in which the original design was originally given to a character called Howdini, who appeared in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode, "[[Disappearing Act]]".
