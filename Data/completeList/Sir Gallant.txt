'''Sir Gallant''' is a character from the [[Disney Afternoon]] show ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. He appears in the episode "[[A Knight to Remember (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|A Knight to Remember]]".

==Background==
Sir Gallant was an elderly [[Gummi Bears|Gummi]] knight who was ordered by the Great Gummies to dismantle the [[Doomsday Clock]], a device created by [[Zorlock and Grot|Zorlock]] that could cause total destruction.

However, he passed away before his quest was complete, and would not be allowed to rest until his spirit could aid a living Gummi knight to continue the quest.

One day [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] comes across his tombstone. As Cubbi had previously been commissioned an official Gummi knight in "[[The Knights of Gummadoon]]", Sir Gallant's spirit is released, with only Cubbi bring able to see the ghost.

Cubbi is aided by an amulet, given to Gallant by the Great Gummies, which serves as a compass that glows brighter the closer they get to the Doomsday Clock.

Along their journey, Cubbi is also taught important lessons of knighthood by Sir Gallant, such as not using [[Gummiberry Juice]] until the point of true need, or that being a knight is not just thrill-seeking.

Cubbi helps Sir Gallant in his quest, and Sir Gallant's ghost is finally able to rest, leaving Cubbi with the amulet compass as proof that their quest really happened.
