'''Dorothy''' is a supporting character in ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''.

==Background==
She is the mother of [[Sylvia]] and [[Bill, Phil & Gil]]. She is seen as grumpy and antagonist towards Sylvia when she and Wander come for a visit by having her do all the work around the house. But it was revealed that Dorothy was only mad because Sylvia came back to escape from her problems from [[Lord Dominator]]. She shows Sylvia a room she kept all the articles and wanted posters of Sylvia and Wander's success. She says that she is wicked proud of her and that her father would've been too. Dorothy reminds her that she is fierce at harassing Lord Hater and points out that that there's a bigger jerk threatening the galaxy. So she gives her a choice of dealing with Dominator or stay home and deal with Dorothy but whatever she chooses, it wasn't going to be easy. So Sylvia chooses to take care of the Galaxy and Dorothy says she'll take care of the dishes as they both reconcile their relationship.

==Appearances==
* "[[The Family Reunion]]" (first appearance)

==Trivia==
* She shares the same first name with Bea Arthur's character on ''The Golden Girls''. In addition, Sylvia's species is a Zbornak, which is the heroine's last name, bringing the reference to a logical conclusion.
** Sylvia calls Dorothy "Ma", like how Dorothy calls her mother Sophia.
