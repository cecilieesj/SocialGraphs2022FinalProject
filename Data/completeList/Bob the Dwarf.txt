'''Bob the Dwarf''' is one of the secondary antagonists in the [[2022]] [[Disney+]] film ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. He is a motion-capture dwarf that gives off an unsettling vibe due to his unnaturally human appearance.

==Background==
===Personality===
Bob is a laid-back cartoon character who nevertheless takes his job under Sweet Pete very seriously. However, he can be something of a goofball and is not that bright. He is apparently oblivious to how people see him, in that he does not look like he can see them back himself.

===Physical appearance===
Bob resembles a typical dwarf (who bares a resemblance to his voice actor [[Seth Rogen]]) and has a long light brown beard with ring ties and a headband. His outfit consists of a typical Dwarven armor that his mostly brown in color with some gold buttons and wrist straps. He carries a great axe with him; a typical weapon for a dwarf.

===Weapons===
Bob's only weapon is a great axe that he is very efficient at using. However, when it comes to taking on the likes of [[Chip and Dale]], it is apparent that he is out of practice.

==Trivia==
*As his appearance implies, he is meant to be a satire at a string of films that [[Robert Zemeckis]] directed in the early 2000s wherein he utilized motion capture technology. While groundbreaking, they were harshly criticized due to the unnatural way the human characters looked; with the sensation dubbed "the Uncanny Valley".
*The scene where Bob encounters [[Pumbaa]] from [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake of ''The Lion King'']], [[w:c:kungfupanda:Mantis|Mantis]] from the ''Kung Fu Panda'' franchise, and [[w:c:dreamworks:B.O.B.|B.O.B.]] from the ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' franchise is a reference to the fact they all share the same voice actor, Seth Rogen.
*He is the very first villain to ever be voiced by Seth Rogen.
*During one scene in the movie Bob makes a bold claim that [[Jack Skellington]] has a charity that he embezzles money from and that "Everybody knows it". whether this is true in the movie's universe or a fake rumor made up by Bob is debatable though it should be noted that the movie doesn't follow the Disney lore rules all too well so such a claim should be taken with a very fine grain of salt.
