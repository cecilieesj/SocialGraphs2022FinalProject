==Background==

===Personality===
Sydney is outgoing and likes to stand out. She also always lives life to the fullest. Being a teenager, Sydney can be self-absorbed and defiant towards her father, doing things wild and crazy just because he tells her no or just to prove him wrong. Many of these can be from dying her hair to sneaking out to a concert. However, these acts tend to backfire as it tends to prove her wrong or makes her experience guilt. Essentially, she is just like her father when he was a kid and that is why both of them grew up as rebellious teenagers.

Sydney is a girl with brunette hair and brown eyes. She is an average height for a girl her age.
