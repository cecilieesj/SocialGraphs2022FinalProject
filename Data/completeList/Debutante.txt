'''Debutante''' is [[Camille Leon]]'s pet hairless Sphynx cat in the ''[[Kim Possible]]'' franchise.

==Background==
Wherever Camille goes, Debutante is almost always with her, usually carried inside her purse. Debutante was extremely loyal, though wanting to be close to her mistress gave away Camille's disguises more than once. Debutante seems to be one of Camille's major sources of true happiness. When accidentally separated from each other, both grew very depressed and lonely.

Debutante also has an obsession with Rufus, though not because she likes to chase rodents like most cats, but because she has a huge crush on Rufus, but he is utterly repulsed by her.

Debutante may be a reference to the hairless Sphinx that Ron was certain was evil.
