Rick Mason is an old acquaintance [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff]] with a talent of acquiring things. In 2016, when she went on the run from [[Thaddeus Ross|Secretary Ross]] for breaking the Sokovia Accords, Natasha turned to Mason who provided her a remote cabin in Norway to lay low in. After reuniting with her sister [[Yelena Belova]] and deciding to go after the Red Room, Natasha requested Mason to obtain them an aircraft, but all he was able to provide was a rundown Mi-8 helicopter, as Natasha's funds were running dry and his own abilities were restricted by Ross going after his other clients in an attempt to get to Romanoff. Two weeks later, after Natasha's mission was already over, Mason was finally able to deliver to her a proper [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Quinjet. Natasha decided to use it to locate her friends, who were currently also in trouble and on the run.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Rick Mason, also known as The Agent, was a mercenary who became a highly covert operative and free-lance agent, who specialized in the non-lethal handling of superhumans. He is also the son of [[Tinkerer|Phineas Mason]].
