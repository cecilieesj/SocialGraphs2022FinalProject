'''Dark Elves''' are an ancient race of corrupted beings from the obscure world of Svartalfheim ruled by [[Malekith the Accursed]]. They are enemies to the [[Asgardians]] and the tertiary antagonists in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.

==Background==
===Powers and Abilities===
Dark elves possess gifted intellects, as well as superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Some Dark Elves, like Malekith, can use faire magic do shapeshift, teleport, project energy blasts, and so on. The Dark Elves possessed some of the most technologically advanced ships, meaning that their technology rivaled and possibly surpassed Asgardian technology to some extent. Along with their Dark Magic and technology, they possessed longevity and could possibly live for 5,000 years like Asgardians. They also possessed hibernation technology. Their armory was made of laser blasters, Black Hole Grenades, swords, and Kurse Stones. Many Dark Elves like Algrim are sometimes called upon to use the Kurse Stone and make the ultimate sacrifice of becoming a Kursed. Once transformed into the Kursed, they are basically a Dark Elf Super Soldier of Darkness, their strength, speed, durability, stamina, and endurance are enhanced by Dark Magic. However, the cost of using the Kurse Stone leads to certain death sometime after transformation when darkness overtakes them.

Long before the birth of light, there was darkness, and from that darkness came the Dark Elves. Their leader, Malekith desired to return the Universe to a state of eternal darkness, using a weapon of infinite destruction called the Aether. When they were about to achieve its objective, but the Asgardian troops came to Svartalfheim and defeated the Dark Elves. In a desperate attempt, Malekith sacrificed his own people to defeat the Asgardian troops. As the [[Aether]] could not destroyed, the King Bor ordered to hide where no one would find them ever.

Thousands of years later, [[Jane Foster]] found the Aether, which caused the awakening of the Dark Elves. Malekith gave a mission to Algrim, to be the last kursed. Back in Asgard, the attack began when Algrim freed all prisoners of Asgard, except one, Loki. The Dark Elves are withdrawn from Asgard without having obtaining the Aether. Thor devises a plan to make Dark Elves don't attack Asgard once again, then Thor and Loki takes Jane to Svartalfheim.

Malekith takes advantage and get the Aether, Thor tries to destroys it but the Infinity Stone regenerates and is absorbed by Malekith. Later, Malekith with his army arrives to Earth, where they could disperse the Aether to the nine realms and destroy the universe. The Dark Elves were killed in battle along with his cruel leader, Malekith.
