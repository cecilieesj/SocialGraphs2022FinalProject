==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
"Oliver "Ollie" Osnick is a very intelligent kid of [http://marvel.wikia.com/Boston Boston],[http://marvel.wikia.com/Massachusetts Massachusetts], who is huge fan of [http://marvel.wikia.com/Peter_Parker_(Earth-TRN123) Spider-Man] and superheroes stuff.

[[File:Steelspider2.png|thumb|left|Ollie Osnick]]At some point, he was able to convince the Mayor to call Spider-Man to became Boston's official vigilante, building for him a lair, gadgets, and vehicles. He intended to became his loyal sidekick, '''Webbie''', but Spider-Man denied him this, fearing for Ollie to be in danger, because of his lack of powers.

Ollie quickly grew in anger for Spider-Man. He freed a few days later three low-range costumed criminals captured by the Webslinger, enhanced them with his tech, and led them in a team dubbed the [http://marvel.wikia.com/Boston_Terroriers_(Earth-TRN123) Boston Terroriers] against Spider-Man.

He finally captured his idol, he revealed himself, and Spider-Man apologize but accidentally revealed the fact that [http://marvel.wikia.com/John_Jonah_Jameson_(Earth-TRN123) J.J. Jameson] offered 10 millions dollars for his unmasking, leading the three criminals to attack them. With knowledge from Oliver, Spider-Man uses the knowledge from Oliver about where the shut-off switches for the armors are. As Steel Spider helps Spider-Man to fight Plymouth Rocket, Salem's Witch, and Smash Adams, they work to get the shut-off switch on the armors. Afterwards, Steel Spider decides to become the superhero of Boston while Spider-Man heads back to New York.
