Off."}}'''Dr. Kozak''' is the main antagonist of the [[2006]] Disney live-action remake of ''[[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]''. He is the former chief executive of the Grant and Strictland corporation, later becoming its temporary president.

==Role in the film==
Dr. Kozak and the whole corporation were being charged because of unauthorized mutations with animal genes. He kidnapped a bearded collie from Tibet who is believed to be 300 years old, trying to use the dogs genes to develop a potion of immortality.

The dog escapes the lab and Kozak orders his goons to find him. His many attempts to capture "Shaggy" (the dog's name given by the Douglas family) resulted in the "accidental" capture of [[Dave Douglas]], who was bitten by Shaggy and became a dog himself. Kozak's team finds the real dog and takes him back to the lab.

Hidden in the laboratory, Dave witnesses Dr. Kozak injecting company president Lance Strictland with a drug that will paralyze him for several months, giving Kozak enough time to usurp control of the company. After viewing security cameras, Kozak and his minions realize that somehow Dave became an exact copy of Khyi Yang Po. Kozak orders his goons to go to Dave's house to "pay him a visit."

Dave is taken to the lab to be euthanized, but Kozak has a court summons, and must deal with Dave later. Right before he leaves, Kozak mocks Dave in his dog form, who bites him on the finger in retaliation. He then begins to exhibit the same issues Dave had at the beginning of his adventure; Dave had successfully transferred the gene sequence into Kozak.

Dave, with the help of the dog-mutated animals, manages to escape as a human and races to the courthouse in his car with the dog-mutated animals. He calls his family, tells them to meet him at the courthouse with clothes and the dog. He gets caught in a traffic jam and changes into a dog to get to the courthouse in time, where his family is waiting for him.

In the courtroom, Dave calls Kozak back to the stand and tries to get him to admit what he has done, but Kozak manages to hide his secret. Not before, Dave mocks Kozak by implying he was working under Strictland's shadow, and angers him. They begin growling at each another, and the judge, exasperated by Dave's canine behavior, orders the bailiff to remove him. Just as the judge is about to dismiss the case, Dave, thinking fast, throws Kozak a nightstick like a common stick, alerting his dog senses to get it, thus causing him to grow a tail, to the judge and everyone in the courtroom's shock and Dave's amusement. Because of this, Kozak is immediately arrested soon afterward. As he is being taken away by the bailiff, Kozak swears vengeance on Dave before asking the bailiff are they going outside.

Kozak is eventually arrested for his crimes and the company is returned to Strictland.

==Trivia==
*Ironically, Robert Downey Jr. would later play an animal lover as the title character in the [[2020]] adaptation of ''Dolittle''.
*His role is the same as [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]: Both owned big enterprises, Both are expert in the fields of Science (Technology for Stark, Genetics for Kozak), Both are sometimes faced against a court who tried to restrain him.
