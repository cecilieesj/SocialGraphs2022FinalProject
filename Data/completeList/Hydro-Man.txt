}}'''Hydro-Man''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]] that appears in [[Spider-Man: Far From Home |''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' ]] as a member of [[the Elementals]].

Hydro-Man was created by Dennis O'Neil, Al Migrom, Jim Mooney and John Romita Jr.

==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
When Spider-Man, Kid Arachnid, Iron Spider, and Scarlet Spider answer a distress signal at an abandoned mall in Queens, they find a vacuum-sealed room where Hydro-Man is being held. Hydro-Man claimed that [[Nick Fury]] was keeping him in this hideout for his own protection, and they decide to bring him to the [[Triskelion]]. However, when Iron Spider looks up Hydro-Man's criminal record and found out that he is a villain, Hydro-Man sheds his charade and attacks the group, causing Iron Spider to do an emergency landing in the Queens neighborhood where Aunt May resides. In order to combat Hydro-Man, Spider-Man, Kid Arachnid, Iron Spider, and Scarlet Spider had to use freeze webs until they ran out. As a final plan, Spider-Man has his fellow spiders throw their web cartridges into Hydro-Man, which caused the released webbing to absorb Hydro-Man. Back at the Triskelion, Spider-Man receives word that the jet carrying Hydro-Man back to his prison got intercepted. This causes Spider-Man to suspect that [[Doctor Octopus]] was behind it and now has a possible candidate for the Sinister Six. This was confirmed in "The New Sinister 6" Pt. 1 where Hydro-Man appears as a member of Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six. He is shown sporting a new outfit (similar to the second outfit from the comics). During the attack on the Triskelion, [[Cloak and Dagger (Marvel)|Cloak]] uses his abilities to send Hydro-Man to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Hydro-Man returns where he causes a tidal wave on the Triskelion and then forms a waterspout around it.

=== ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' ===
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hydro-Man is reimagined as a robotic monster created by [[Mysterio]], who is controllingÂ the Elementals to appear to the public as a hero and successor to the late [[Iron Man]]. It attacks Venice, Italy, where Peter Parker and his classmates are having a vacation. Though Peter tries to ward it off, Mysterio eventually arrives and defeats it.

== Trivia ==
* In ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'', Flash mentions a BuzzFeed article that claims that Hydro-Man was a sailor named Morris Bench who acquired water-based superpowers. This is in line with his comic book origins.
