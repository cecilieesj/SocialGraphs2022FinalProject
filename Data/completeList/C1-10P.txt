'''C1-10P''' (also known as '''Chopper''') is a major character of the [[Disney XD]] series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He's a mixed part astromech droid belonging to [[Hera Syndulla]].

==Background==
Chopper is made of most spare parts from other droids and does not care about other living beings like most other droids, but when push comes to shove, he will usually come through to save the day.

===Personality===
Chopper is sarcastic and cranky. Unlike other astromechs such as [[R2-D2]], Chopper does not care about being loved by the organics he worked with and seemed to dislike other astromechs. While he is always bad-tempered, stubborn, and irritable, Chopper does have the crew's best interests in mind and would always help them during a problem.

Chopper also has a mischievous and sadistic streak which causes him to sometimes endanger his fellow crew members on the Ghost. On one occasion, he nearly caused the death of Ezra by knocking him off the Ghost in mid-air. Despite the incident, he showed no remorse and continued tossing jugs at him.

Despite his cantankerousness Chopper is also capable of showing affection when it suited him, Chopper has shown little respect for his fellow shipmates. When asked to do something, Chopper would often do it his own way and slowly at that. He is extremely belligerent and rude and liked to play pranks on the crew, mostly [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios|Zeb]].

Despite his grumpy disposition and sociopathic behavior, Chopper is very loyal and, in his own unique way, cares for his crew mates.

==Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===
Chopper played a mostly minor role in the series. It is revealed during his interactions with [[Cham Syndulla]] and [[AP-5]] that Chopper was a co-pilot on a [[Y-Wing]] during the Clone Wars. After the Y-Wing crashed, Chopper was rescued from the wreckage by a young [[Hera Syndulla]]. After Hera decided to join the Rebel Network, he left Ryloth with his master.

===''[[Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything]]''===
Chopper is featured as a special guest in the ''Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything'' episode, "[[The Has-Been's Back]]".

===''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]''===
Chopper is seen with a teenage [[Hera Syndulla]] as they spy on an Imperial compound on [[Ryloth]].

==Relationships==
===[[Hera Syndulla]]===
Hera became Chopper's mistress after she rescued him from a crashed Y-Wing. Cham later complained that Hera paid more attention to Chopper than him. When Hera left Ryloth, he went with her. Hera cares for Choppy during her adventures.

===[[Garazeb Orrelios]]===
Chopper and Zeb have a mutual dislike for each other. Zeb has a distaste for Chopper's lazy, selfish nature, his lack of respect, constant pranks and the fact that he has put Ghost crew lives in danger more than once. However, he still acknowledges Chopper's work for the Ghost crew, as shown when he complimented Chopper on going undercover to find where Kanan was being held by the Imperials. Zeb and Chopper do have a tendency to work together where they rescued Ezra and Sabine from two [[Inquisitorius|Inquistors]] and working with [[AP-5]] to stopping an E-XD-series infiltrator droid from reporting the rebel base to Empire by getting it to explode at an Imperial star destroyer.

===[[AP-5]]===
Chopper met AP-5 after he accidentally got separated from the Ghost crew he stole an ambulatory strut. Rather report Chopper to his Imperial superiors, AP-5 shared war stories with Chopper when he revealed he was a war hero. AP-5 expressed how lucky Chopper was to have some one like [[Hera Syndulla]] rescue him from a crashed Y-Wing. Chopper developed a friendship with AP-5 and removed his restraining bolt to give him the will to defy his superiors. When AP-5 revealed the Yosat system was now under Imperial control, Chopper trusted AP-5 and warned his friends to change their course in finding a new base on [[Atollon]]. After AP-5 was shot twice by the ship's captain, Chopper was sad to see his friend get shut down, but he decided to use his new ambulatory strut to repair AP-5. When AP-5 was repaired, he was at first shocked by Chopper's selfless before he berated him for committing the "illogical act." Despite this, Chopper and AP-5  continue to remain friends.
