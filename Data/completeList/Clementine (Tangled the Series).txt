==Background==
Clementine appears alongside the Separatists of Saporia in "[[Rapunzel's Return]]". When the king and queen had their memories erased by her, they lay siege to Corona and forced its citizens to mine for crystals. After Varian's plan to erase all the memories with the Quirineon failed, Clementine suggested that they would use it to reduce Corona to ashes. When Rapunzel and Varian prevented it from happening, the Separatists are sent to jail.
