'''P.J. Pete''' is the son of [[Pete]]. He first appeared in the [[1942]] short ''[[Bellboy Donald]]'' as '''Pete Junior'''. He was later reinvented for the [[1992]] animated series ''[[Goof Troop]]'', as the best friend of [[Max Goof]]. P.J. is warm-hearted and friendly, but his passive nature makes him a frequent pawn in the schemes of his domineering father.

==Background==
In all of his appearances from ''Goof Troop'' onward, P.J. is [[Max Goof]]'s best friend. Like Max, P.J. ages throughout each of his appearances, going from middle school to high school and finally to college. P.J. is shown to be nervous, insecure, and shy, often fearing punishment from his father Pete. His relationship with his father is consistently shown to be based on fear and control as a stark contrast to the much more loving relationship between Max and Goofy, with him often calling his father "Sir".

Though he is not usually the one to come up with ideas, P.J. is also shown to be helpful, polite, sensitive, honest, and hard-working, and is usually the one to consider potential consequences. He enjoys casual sports like bike-riding and skateboarding, as well as playing video games and watching television, but holds a disinterest in certain contact sports like football<ref>In the ''Goof Troop'' episode "[[Pistolgeist]]", Pete claims that P.J. "hates football."</ref> and, on at least one occasion, baseball.<ref>The ''Goof Troop'' episode "[[Take Me Out of the Ball Game (Goof Troop)|Take Me Out of the Ball Game]]" was all about how much P.J. and Max have absolutely zero interest in baseball, with P.J. claiming to be "no good at sports", while other episodes such as "[[Forever Goof|Good Neighbor Goof]]", "[[Max-imum Protection]]", "[[Goodbye Mr. Goofy]]", and "[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]" featured P.J. as either willing/wanting to play baseball or at least in possession of baseball equipment that he did use.</ref> 

Physically, he is strong and tough, capable of performing lots of manual labor - a fact regularly exploited by his lazier father. Thus, he often endures various tasks from his father, who forces him into activities that are much more stereotypically 'manly' compared to some of the less macho activities he enjoys like reading/writing poetry. Like his father, he is physically built but less bulky. Due to the contrast between their personalities, he also has a far more genial appearance to his face. Throughout the series and movies, he becomes increasingly larger in size but does not actually become fatter.

P.J. is the complete opposite of his father behavior-wise. He often displays fears of his father, of spending time with him, and of disobeying or disappointing him. Sadly, Pete seems to interpret these fears instead as signs of respect and admiration, oblivious to the actual displeasure that said fears often bring P.J. When compared to the much healthier relationship between Max and Goofy, it is evident that Pete is rather domineering towards P.J.:

{{Quote|'''Max:''' "Awww, Peej, fishin' with your dad. What could be more fun?"<br>'''P.J.''': "Eating glass. You got any idea what fishin' with him is like?"|P.J. and Max|Slightly Dinghy}}
{{Quote|Oh man, my dad is going to smash me like a '''bug'''.|P.J.|A Goofy Movie}}

Nevertheless, P.J. does have enough wits to see through many of his father's schemes and often aids those (particularly his mother, Peg) who try to teach Pete a lesson about exploiting and using others for his own gain. And despite all of their differences, P.J. and Pete do love each other deep down and have been there for each other in their times of need.<ref>Examples:<br>"[[Axed by Addition]]" - Pete is overcome with grief when he believes P.J. to be terminally ill and goes out of his way to do whatever he can for his son in what he believes to be P.J.'s final moments.<br>"[[From Air to Eternity]]" - P.J. openly tells his father that his loves him whilst he is attached to a large balloon, and when he's swept away into the air by said balloon, Pete becomes desperate to save his son's life despite his own chronic fear of heights.</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Bellboy Donald]]''===
[[File:PJ_Bellboy_Donald.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Pete Junior's original design, as seen in ''Bellboy Donald''.]]
Pete Junior first appears as the main antagonist in this [[Donald Duck]] cartoon as a naughty little kid.

Pete Junior's characterization is far more similar to Pete than his modern incarnation; he is just as obnoxious and disrespectful as [[Pete|his father]] (who ironically, is portrayed as a gentleman in this cartoon).

He continuously harasses Donald and his father has no idea about the situation, but at the end after pushing the duck too far, Donald gets his revenge by spanking him rapidly.

===''[[Goof Troop]]''===
In ''Goof Troop'', P.J. is 11-years old<ref>"[[And Baby Makes Three]]"</ref> and lives next door to [[Goofy]] and [[Max Goof|Max]]. Throughout the series, P.J.'s relationship with his father Pete is clearly based on control, with P.J. often being manipulated into doing thankless chores and criticized over minor failings. It is far more frequent for P.J. to be shown to fear his father than to love him, mainly due to the pressure he gets from Pete. On the other hand, P.J. frequently plays a supporting role in seeing that his father receives his righteous comeuppance (usually carried out by his mother) for many of his schemes, and even honestly tries to make him proud at times.

In the [[Forever Goof|first episode]], P.J. gloomily tells Max that he is not allowed to play with anything in his room because they are all collector's items bought by Pete. In the second, Pete forbids him from playing with Max. In [[And Baby Makes Three|one episode]], P.J. is shown counting down the days until he can leave home. In [[To Heir is Human|another]], Pete actually pretends he is seriously ill to manipulate P.J. into doing his job just to get a few days off work. In all of these cases, however, things turn out for the better for P.J. in the end as either his father relents on his strictness or circumstances orchestrated by others end up freeing P.J. from these absurd conditions.

Conversely, in a rare case of Pete being both a supportive and proud father, "[[From Air to Eternity]]" reveals that P.J. and Pete both share a fear of heights. Both father and son at first try to hide their respective fears from one another, so as to not disappoint each other. Pete even pretends that he, his father, and his grandfather all partook in extraordinary feats at high heights just to impress P.J., when these exploits were actually exaggerations as all three men were equally scared of heights. Nevertheless, P.J. admires his dad so much that he decides to impress him with his own death-defying acts of heroism. 

In actuality, P.J.'s heroics are virtual stunts he performs in a video game tournament, which Pete initially mistakes for ''real'' stunts and thus expresses genuine pride in his son. But when the two eventually come clean of their respective fears, they are at first disappointed in each another's half-truths, but after P.J. is swept into danger by a ''real'' airborne stunt, Pete risks his life to save his son and the two reconcile, accepting each other for their shared fear of heights. In "[[Puppy Love (Goof Troop)|Puppy Love]]", Pete actually tries to help his son impress his crush, although his attempts end up making things worse. 

P.J. is usually seen hanging out with Max, and at [[Goodbye Mr. Goofy|one point]], P.J. states that Max is the only friend that he has ever had. P.J. is usually talked into assisting with Max's own schemes, but does prove himself to be brave whenever Max or even his father really need him.

===''[[A Goofy Movie]]''===
[[File:PJ in A Goofy Movie.png|thumb|200px|P.J. in ''A Goofy Movie''.]]
P.J. is now in high school, and helps Max to try and impress a girl named [[Roxanne]] by videotaping Max dance to "[[Stand Out]]", a new song by the rock star known as [[Powerline]]. Though, P.J. is nervous throughout, since the thought of his dad finding out that he took his dad's video camera without permission terrifies him. While leaving the principal's office after they are caught, he drones, "My dad is going to smash me like a bug."

After school is let out, he is seen more confidently jumping onto Max's shoulders, congratulating him on earning a date with Roxanne and inciting all the students to chant Max's name. Later, he briefly reappears when Max and Goofy are camping in the woods. He is cleaning the floor of Pete's RV with a floor-buffer, singing and dancing to Powerline's song. Max is shown to envy P.J. as he gets to travel in Pete's luxurious RV, but P.J. tells Max that ''he'' is the lucky one since everyone in town has heard that Max will be on stage with Powerline. Max reveals to P.J. that it was a lie he told to impress Roxanne and has not yet told Goofy about it.

Pete and P.J. meet up with Goofy and Max once again when they later stop off at a motel. During this time, Max confides in P.J. that he has changed Goofy's road map to guide them to Los Angeles. Their discussion is overheard by Pete, who tells Goofy. P.J. later makes a final, very brief appearance when Max is on stage at the concert, cleaning the RV again while watching Max on TV.

===''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''===
[[File:Exgoofy-disneyscreencaps.com-4023.jpg|thumb|left|250px|P.J. with his love interest, Beret Girl, in ''An Extremely Goofy Movie''.]]
By the start of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'', P.J. is a high school graduate bound for college. He gains more size, being almost as big as Pete and almost as tall as Goofy. P.J. is seen prominently throughout the movie, sharing a dorm with Max and Bobby, as well as being on their team for the College X-Games. He, Max and Bobby travel to [[Unnamed college|college]] in Bobby's van. When they arrive, they are followed by [[Bradley Uppercrust III]]—leader of the [[The Gammas|Gamma Mu Mu]] fraternity and reigning College X-Games 'king'--to a cafe called the Bean Scene, with an offer for Max to join the Gammas, but not P.J. and Bobby, which Max declines. When [[Tank]], Bradley's right-hand man. threatens Bobby, P.J. defends him with a biscotti. When he hears the full name of Bradley's fraternity, he remarks "Moo, Moo?! Who'd want to join a heard of cows?!" As punishment for this remark, he is given a wedgie by Tank. The confrontation is soon put to an end by the [[Beret Girl]].

Later, P.J. meets her again at a disco club, at which point his personality takes on a whole new level. After speaking poetically to her about how fat people are looked down upon (to the surprise of both Max and Bobby) she asks him to dance. After this, he and the Beret Girl become closer, with P.J. gaining newfound confidence and taking on the role of a beatnik, his casual clothes even changing from a blue T-shirt and green shorts to a black turtle neck, black trousers, and a beret.

He and his team try out and compete in the College X-Games against the Gammas, in which his best event is shown to be bike riding. When his team makes it to the finals, however, P.J. is abruptly removed from participating in the last race by Bradley, who had secretly strapped rockets to P.J. boots that Bradley activates to blast P.J. out of the arena before the race can begin. As a result, Goofy ends up taking P.J.'s place in the race. P.J. is last seen at the very end of the film reading poetry to the Beret Girl, the two having presumably become a couple.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
[[File:Pj DT.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
After being absent for 20 years, in the episode "[[Quack Pack!]]", P.J. makes a cameo appearance in one of Goofy's wallet photographs as a cotton candy vendor at an amusement park. As Goofy recounts the story of the photo to [[Donald Duck]], Goofy mentions that he had gotten stuck at the top of a roller coaster's loop-de-loop and had to be caught by Max, who swung him into P.J.'s cotton candy stand to give Goofy a soft landing, much to P.J.'s surprise.

==Printed media==
===Books===
With the release of ''[[Goof Troop]]'' in [[1992]], P.J. began to appear more frequently in printed media, such as in books and comic strips. His first book appearance was in the 1992 Little Golden Book ''[[Great Egg-Spectations|Goof Troop: Great Egg-Spectations]]'', adapted from [[Great Egg-Spectations|the episode of the same name]]. Like in the episode, P.J. helps Max to hide a newborn dinosaur named [[Bubbles (Goof Troop)|Bubbles]] from Pete. But once Bubbles grows too big and causes trouble for Pete, he chases after Bubbles through town. P.J., Max, and Goofy rescue Bubbles from Pete with help from Bubbles' Mama.

P.J. next appeared in the Little Golden Book ''[[Goin' Gold-Fishing|Goof Troop: Goin' Gold-Fishing]]'', adapted from the episode "[[Slightly Dinghy]]". Like in the episode, P.J. nervously assists Max in trying to find a lost sunken treasure out at sea while their fathers are busy fishing. However, a stubborn little fish named Tiny Tuna gets in their way and uses a "Sharkmarine" to attack the group aboard Pete's boat. Though everyone survives, P.J. continues to nervously follow Max as the latter runs off with another big idea.

P.J. also appeared in the two stories featured in the [[1993]] ''[[Goof Troop: Junior Graphic Novel]]'', adapted from the first two ''Goof Troop'' comic strips ever published in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' (see below), "The Power of Positive Goofing" and "Pavlov's Goof". In the first story, P.J. tries to help Max overcome his fear of embarrassing himself at the upcoming Fitness Fun Day event. He coaches Max on getting into shape, supports him in boosting his self-confidence, and times him on an obstacle coarse. When the big day arrives, P.J. is said to have won an arm-wresting event with his father. He then warns Goofy and Max about how difficult the Tilting Tile Floor is, but Pete convinces Goofy otherwise. After the Goofs impress everyone by their dancing on it, P.J. and his family soon join them for some fun on the Tilting Tile Floor. In the second story, P.J.'s role is much smaller since the story is mainly about Pete. P.J. and Max trick Pistol into thinking that she has hypnotized them with a new toy of hers before revealing their joke. The three then leave to go shopping with Peg while Pete and Goofy stay home to do yard work.

With the release of ''A Goofy Movie'' in [[1995]], P.J. continued to appear in books based on his appearance in that movie. Specifically, P.J. appeared on the last page of the [[1994]] Mouse Works book ''[[Goofy Gets Goofy]]'', which is an adaptation of the [[Powerline]] concert scene from ''A Goofy Movie''. Though, in contrast to the movie, wherein P.J. was with his father at the time, the book instead shows P.J. to be with [[Roxanne]] and [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]] as the three are amazed to see Max and Goofy dancing on TV with Powerline at his concert.

''A Goofy Movie'' also spawned a number of other book adaptations, all of which P.J. appeared in. These include the 1995 novelization of the film published by Scholastic, the [[1996]] French novelization of the film (titled ''Dingo et Max'')<ref name="Dingo et Max">Meaning "Goofy & Max", with "Dingo" being Goofy's French name.</ref> published by Disney Hachette, at least three different 1996 French ''Dingo et Max'' storybook adaptations also published by Disney Hachette, a Danish storybook adaptation (titled ''Fedtmule og Søn'')<ref>Meaning "Goofy & Son", with "Fedtmule" being Goofy's Danish name.</ref> published by Egmont Books in 1996, a German storybook adaptation (titled ''Der Goofy Film'')<ref>Meaning "The Goofy Film".</ref> published by Franz Schneider Verlag GmbH in 1996, and more.

===Comics===
====''[[Disney Adventures]]''====
From 1992 to 1997, ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine published a total of thirty comic strips based on the ''Goof Troop'' animated series. Of these thirty, P.J. appeared in twenty-three comics, second only to Max in total appearances. Like in the TV series, P.J. played a mostly secondary role as Max's sidekick and partner-in-fun, going along with his big ideas.

In these comic stories, P.J. helps Max to overcome his nervousness about Fitness Fun Day ("The Power of Positive Goofing"), has a misadventure involving a dancing pig ("Hamming It Up!"), uses [[Chainsaw (Goof Troop)|Chainsaw]] as physical evidence for why he doesn't have his homework to turn in ("No Excuse is a Better Excuse"), delivers an impromptu oral creative writing project to his teacher ("Excuses, Excuses!"), helps Max to cope with a miserable school day on [[April 1]] ("Everybody Makes Mistakes") gets to meet both the popular TV superhero character Rad Rat ("Automania, Part 1" and "Automania, Part 2") and teen sensation Taffy 2 Sweet ("Max's Makeover, Part One" and "Max's Make Over, Part Two"), acquires his own pet goldfish ("A Fishy Tale") tries to buy a birthday present for Max ("Toy Tussle"), and more.

P.J. also appeared in the two ''Goof Troop'' comics created specifically to tie into ''A Goofy Movie''. In "My Hero", when Max decides that he wants to save Roxanne from some perilous danger and be her hero, P.J. suggests that Max stage some danger from which he is to save her. P.J. comes up with three different scenarios from which Max is to save Roxanne. However, P.J. goofs up the first attempt, resulting Max saving Stacey instead, while the second and third attempts simply backfire, with Max saving Bobby in the second and Roxanne saving Max in the third.

In "Gorilla in Our Midst", Max and Goofy get a new neighbor in the form of a gorilla named Mr. Kong. When Goofy has P.J. and Max help Mr. Kong to move into his house, Mr. Kong apparently tries to stomp on them (he was actually crushing a spider) and then roars at them when they offer him some cookies (he was actually sneezing due to food allergies). P.J. and Max later hear loud noises and screams coming from his house (these are actually sounds from horror movies Mr. Kong was watching). This leads the boys into thinking that Mr. Kong is a ferocious monster, not knowing that he is truly a nice guy. And at school, P.J. sees that Max has been losing so much sleep over Mr. Kong's loud snoring that he forgets his movie date with Roxanne. As Max runs off in a panic, P.J. jokes "It sounds like you're afraid of Roxanne more than Mr. Kong!"

====''[[The Disney Afternoon (comic book)|The Disney Afternoon]]''====
P.J. also appeared in two of the five ''Goof Troop'' comic strips published in ''[[The Disney Afternoon (comic book)|The Disney Afternoon]]''. In "Dog Days", P.J. and Max are inspired to bury a time capsule whose contents they hope will be worth a lot of money in five years. However, when digging in the back yard to bury their time capsule, they find an old statue of an Egyptian dog buried in the ground. Believing the statue to be ancient, they try to sell it to an antique store, but accidentally damage some items and are kicked out of the store.

They then decide to hold an auction for the statue at Goofy's house, where they nearly earn four million and ten dollars for the statue before Goofy suddenly reveals that the statue actually isn't an ancient artifact. Rather, it's a sign prop from an old hot dog restaurant. P.J. and Max are dismayed over the loss of over four million dollars until an old couple offers to buy the statue from them for a healthy sum. P.J. and Max use the money to pay back the antique store and buy themselves a couple of fancy new remote-controlled toy cars.

In "Woolly Bully", P.J., Max, and Pistol are taken out west to the Woolly Bully Dude Ranch by Pete and Goofy. While Max and P.J. run around pretending to be a cowboy and a bull, respectively, Pistol wants to ride the ranch's main attraction, El Loco the bull. When Goofy tries to stop her, he accidentally set El Loco free of his pen. El Loco runs wild and Max accidentally ropes him by the horns. P.J. then grabs onto Max and the two are sent flying by El Loco and crash-land at the feet of Pete. The boys later see Pistol befriend El Loco and ride him successfully.

====''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]''====
From 1993 to 1995, P.J. appeared in all nine ''La Bande à Dingo''<ref>The French title of ''Goof Troop'', meaning, "The Dingo Band"</ref> comic strips published in ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]''. Since most of these comics focused more on Pete and/or Goofy, P.J. played a more supporting role in each one, mostly just playing with Max. In three stories, Goofy would tell both P.J. and Max about the adventurous exploits of some of his ancestors (much like the TV show's five "Goof History" episodes), which P.J. would find to be fascinating stories.

In the 2221st issue, published on January 11, 1995, P.J. (along with the ''Goof Troop'' incarnations of Pete and Peg) made a surprising appearance outside of ''La Bande à Dingo'' on the final page of a special ''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip published in that issue. Titled "Cent Ans de Cinéma" (meaning "One Hundred Years of Cinema"), this story featured [[Mickey Mouse]] and Goofy hosting a live broadcast of a special documentary that commemorates the 100th anniversary of cinema. At the end of the presentation, it is shown that P.J., Pete, and Peg were watching the live broadcast of this documentary on their home TV set together as a family. The conclusion of the documentary then inspires Pete to treat P.J. and Peg to an evening at the movies, to which P.J. accidentally brings with him the TV remote from home.

On [[February 12]], [[1997]], Issue #2330 published a special ''Dingo & Max''<ref name="Dingo et Max"/> comic that featured characters from ''A Goofy Movie''. In this story, P.J. accompanies Max to a flower shop when Max tells him that tomorrow is Roxanne's birthday. As Max tries to buy a bouquet of roses for Roxanne, he and P.J. then spot Roxanne across the street kissing another guy. P.J. tries to cheer Max up, stating that there are other girls out there for Max. He then warns Max not to make himself go crazy over the situation, which Max denies. But after P.J. heads home, Max does follow after Roxanne and "Jimmy" to spy on the pair.

The next day at school, P.J. tells the heartbroken Max that what they saw the other day was all just an act. Roxanne and "Jimmy" (whose real name is Hubert) are to be the lead couple of a surprise school play to be performed in honor of Valentine's Day, and that the two were just rehearsing when P.J. and Max saw them together. Overjoyed that Roxanne hasn't fallen for another guy, Max then sees her crying. Hubert suddenly got sick, which means the play will have to be canceled. Wanting to cheer Roxanne up, Max volunteers to take Hubert's place in the play. Later, while Max and Roxanne perform onstage, P.J. cheers Max on while in the audience, much to the ire of [[Nerdy kids|the play's writer]].

====''La Bande à Dingo: Le Visiteur De L'Extra-Temps''====
In this 44-page French-original graphic novel (whose title translates to "The Visitor From Another Time") published in May [[1993]] by Dargaud as #10 in the Disney Club collection, P.J. plays a semi-important role in this story. He is first seen in the front yard hopping around on a pogo stick that makes dinosaur footprints when an earthquake suddenly hits Spoonerville. A news report on TV reveals that the quake was caused by a landslide that occurred at a local quarry in the Bellevue area of town. Wanting a closer look, P.J. and Max sneak out and head over to the quarry on their bike and skateboard, respectively. When they are spotted by a police officer, they are forced to return home but Max's skateboard goes missing. As he and P.J. look for it, they soon spot somebody riding on it going downhill. P.J. and Max give chase on P.J.'s bike and are shocked to find that Max's skateboard was being ridden by a baby dinosaur!

The next morning, Max sneaks "Baby Dino" over to P.J.'s house, hiding him inside Pete's garage. P.J. worries that they won't be able to get Dino out of the garage since his dad is right outside and is talking to Goofy about a new car he just got, stating that his father can go on talking about cars for hours. Wishing that Dino could speak and tell them about itself, the boys soon get an answer when Baby Dino suddenly knocks over some potted plants and uses their dirt to sculpt a scale model of the Dragon's Bay located west of town. Deducing that Baby Dino needs to go there, Max and P.J. devise a plan to get themselves over there.

Preparing a makeshift ramp, P.J. lets Max and Dino use his giant skateboard to ride out of the garage just as Pete and Goofy open its door. Likewise, P.J. rides after them on his bike. At that same moment, a U.S. Army contingent led by General Boxer and General Terrier pulls up to Pete's house and sees Max take off with the baby dinosaur; they had come looking for dinosaurs after a footprint had been found at the site of the landslide the previous night. Spotting Max with the dinosaur, the Army gives chase and pursues after P.J. and Max through the downtown area of Spoonerville. Pete, Goofy, Peg, Pistol, and others also follow after them as well.

At Dragon's Bay, P.J., Max, and Dino are soon met by all of their pursuers, as well as a surprise appearance by a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex emerging from the waters of the bay. But then, from out of the T-Rex's head pops out movie director Steve Splitscreen, revealing that both dinosaurs are actually mechanical. The next morning, P.J. and everyone involved in the previous day's ordeal meet with the mayor at City Hall. Steve Splitscreen explains that he allowed P.J. and Max to find Baby Dino in order to test the realism of his new technology, and apologizes for the panic caused by his carelessness.

A week later, Goofy entertains Max and P.J. by making some dinosaur-shaped shadow puppets outside of Pete's house.

====Other comics====
In July [[1996]], ''A Goofy Movie'' was adapted into a 44-page graphic novel published in France by Club Dargaud as part of ''Les Classiques du Dessin Animé en Bande Dessinée'' ("The Animated Classics in Comic Book form") collection, in which P.J. appeared in the same role that he played in the movie. The first 14 pages of this ''Dingo et Max''<ref name="Dingo et Max"/> graphic novel were later translated into English and released in pocket size as ''A Goofy Movie Mini-Comic'', which was included as a pack-in bundle with the movie's UK VHS release on [[June 2]], [[1997]]. In these first 14 pages, P.J. goes through the same events of the movie up to when Max asks Roxanne to go with him to Stacey's party, ending on a cliffhanger to get people to watch the movie to find out what happens next. On [[July 27]], [[2021]], all 44 pages were fully adapted into English by Fantagraphics in Volume 1 of ''The Disney Afternoon Adventures''. 

In July of [[2011]], P.J. (in his ''Goof Troop'' design), Max, and Pistol all made a cameo appearance in the pages of ''[[Darkwing Duck (comic book)#Boom.21 Studios|Darkwing Duck]]'' issue #14 "Cat-Tastrophe" published by [[Boom! Studios]] as part of the story arc ''[[Campaign Carnage]]''. In this story, P.J., Max, and Pistol are all seen in the background as fellow classmates of [[Gosalyn Mallard]] at her prep school in [[St. Canard]]. The three are shown in a flashback describing the backstory of Cat-Tankerous, [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck's]] latest new adversary. However, when this story was later reprinted by [[Joe Books]] as part of ''[[Darkwing Duck: The Definitively Dangerous Edition]]'' in [[2015]], Cat-Tankerous's backstory was rewritten and the cameo appearance of P.J., Max, and Pistol was omitted and replaced by completely new story content, making their cameo appearance in this comic no longer canon.

P.J. appears as only a non-playable character in the 1993 ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' video game for the Super Nintendo. While out at sea on a fishing trip, P.J. and Pete are kidnapped by pirates, who mistook Pete for their long lost captain, the pirate king [[Keelhaul Pete]]. Likewise, they mistook P.J. for a cabin boy. For a time, the pirates actually treat Pete and P.J. well, serving them food and treating them like royalty. But when the real Pirate King actually returns, he sentences Pete and P.J. to be eaten by a nasty alligator. Thankfully, Goofy and Max had also been out at sea on their own fishing trip when the original kidnapping had occurred. The Goofs pursued the pirates to Spoonerville Island and fought their way across the island to reach the pirate's ship. The two battle and defeat Keelhaul Pete, rescuing P.J. and Pete.

P.J. also appears in the ''Goof Troop'' LCD game made by [[Tiger Electronics]], in which he ''is'' playable, along with Max. In this game, P.J. and Max skateboard through the streets to collect recyclables in order to raise enough money to buy tickets to a concert (as was the case in the episode "[[Maximum Insecurity]]").

==﻿Trivia ==
[[file:947466.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The family seen in "[[Father's Weekend]]" often mistaken to be Pete's family, and the son is mistaken for Pete Junior.]]
*Max and P.J. share some unique traits among Disney characters who are affiliated with the ''Mickey Mouse'' Universe: both debut in the animated shorts with a different look, are sons instead of nephews and we see them grow up and become adults over the course of their appearances.
*In the [[1953]] ''Goofy'' cartoon short "[[Father's Weekend]]", there is a brief cameo of a visiting family consisting of a father, a mother, and a son. Due to the father having a hefty physique and a rather large jawline, this man is often mistaken for [[Pete]] and, in turn, the son is mistaken for Pete Junior. However, a closer inspection of this man reveals him to be an anthropomorphic dog person with a snout just like Goofy's, which Pete traditionally does not have. As a result, this would make the father and son not to be exactly like them.
[[File:Disney_Afternoon_issue_6_page_27_panel_1_P.J._PETE.png|thumb|right|250px|P.J.'s last name given to be "Pete", in the ''Goof Troop'' comic strip "Dog Days" from ''[[The Disney Afternoon (comic book)|The Disney Afternoon]]'' issue #6.]]
*P.J.'s full name "Peter Pete Jr." was never officially given in ''Goof Troop'' or its related media. The name stems from the logic of how his primary moniker of "P.J." is short for "Pete Junior" (as this is confirmed in both "[[Queasy Rider]]" and "[[Lethal Goofin']]") while his father Pete has, on multiple occasions, been formally addressed as "Peter" by his wife/P.J.'s mother Peg. P.J.'s surname being "Pete" was confirmed in the ''Goof Troop'' comic strip "Dog Days" (published in the sixth issue of ''[[The Disney Afternoon (comic book)|The Disney Afternoon]]'' comic book series on [[April]] [[1995]]) in which he was referred to as "P.J. Pete".
*His name was also given as "P.J. Pete" at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo 2015]] ''A Goofy Movie'' 20th Anniversary Reunion Panel.
*The ''[[Bonkers]]'' character Bullfinch, a toon bird who sings "[[The Rubber Room Song]]" as a member of the Bully Boys, dresses in the same pink turtleneck sweater and blue long-sleeved shirt that P.J. wears in ''Goof Troop''.
*P.J. makes a brief appearance (albeit, unnamed) in the Mouse Works funny face book ''[[Goofy Gets Goofy]]'', which was published prior to ''A Goofy Movie'' on October 1, 1994. The book is an adaptation of the movie's Powerline concert scene, in which P.J. (in contrast to his depiction in the actual movie, in which he was with his dad, Pete, in their RV) is seen alongside Roxanne and another one of Max's friends (who appears to be Bobby) watching Max, Goofy, and Powerline dancing together on TV, much to P.J.'s surprise.
**Though, his color scheme in that book differs from his finalized appearance in the movie: His fur is brown instead of black, his baseball cap is red instead of pink, his shirt is light blue instead of medium violet-blue, his pants are red instead of dark violet-blue, his shoes are black instead of red, and he wears very noticeable white socks instead of wearing no visible socks.
