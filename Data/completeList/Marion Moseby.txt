==Background==
He was the manager of the Boston [[Tipton Hotel]] and later the manager of the [[S.S. Tipton]] who is probably the most annoyed by [[Zack Martin|Zack]] and [[Cody Martin|Cody]]'s schemes. He also encourages [[London Tipton|London]] and always prepares the hotel when Mr. Tipton or someone famous arrives at the Tipton Hotel. He also tries his best to manage the hotel.

He also started out as a bellboy in his early years. He was 41 since "[[Mom and Dad on Deck]]" when it was his birthday. He tends to have a crush on the people he works with such as [[Carey Martin]] and [[Emma Tutweiller]]. Mr. Moseby lives in an apartment and his older brother, Spencer, and grandmother have appeared in the series. Spencer was once poor and took advantage of Mr. Moseby, and Mr. Moseby dislikes his older brother very much. Marion Moseby's catchphrase is 'Good luck with that'. He also hires the best he can get. He is addicted to a computer game which he plays with Zack, and once had to attend a meeting for other gaming addicts.

He is always teased by his short height, the running gag appears more frequently in ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'' than ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'', such as Zack teasing that when Mr. Blanket made a 2-foot tall doll figure of Mr. Moseby, Zack said, "Hey Look! Yours' is life-size!" ("[[The Defiant Ones]]").

===Personality===
Being the hotel's former manager, Moseby was obsessive about keeping it in order. He is usually uptight in a Basil Fawlty-like way, bossy and prone to hysterical fits when things go wrong. He has shown feelings for the teacher at Seven Seas High, Emma Tutweiller. In a few episodes, they are actually together, but these romantic stages end quickly and restart again soon. You could say that they have an on-again/off-again relationship, but it is clear that both have romantic feelings for each other. They become engaged in the series finale.

==History==
===Origin===
Marion Moseby was born in Boston. Moseby has a sister named Lilly, and an elder (but shorter) brother named Spencer, he also has a younger half-brother named Dwight Howard who is much taller than he is.

===Early Life===
[[File:The Suite Life of Zack & Cody - Mr. Moseby.jpg|thumb|left]]
He met Ash Tyler in [[1982]], with whom he spent two years on the road as a competitive hand slap team. But on the night of the International Handslap Championship another man named Derek Jupiter asked Ash Tyler to join the band Iron Weasel. So Moseby was left without a partner and lost the competition.

Moseby studied at the University of Hotelery Studies. After finishing his schooling in [[1987]] he begins working in the Tipton as a bellboy (as revealed in [[The Ghost of Suite 613]]). At the time he actually had a head of hair unlike how he usually appears in every other episode of the entire series, as he had an afro-like style. In [[1994]], he became a waiter in the hotel's dining service, as shown by the photographs behind his office's desk.

===''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''===
In the year [[2001]], Mr. Tipton promoted Marion to the position of manager, when Esteban came to the United States. He once lost his job because of being fired by the hotel inspector, Ilsa, ("[[Hotel Inspector]]") but came back days after. He is very stressed when it comes to Zack & Cody, especially since the day they came to the Tipton, which he likes to call "the end of happiness". In [[2007]], his niece came to the Tipton to be more responsible.

===''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]''===
In the final months of [[2008]], Mr. Tipton gave Moseby the job of becoming the new manager of the S.S. Tipton.

Moseby was stuck on the island Zack, Cody, Bailey, Woody, and London were stuck on with Emma ([[Lost at Sea]]). It is unknown how he got back on the ship, though nobody seemed to mind that he was gone.

In another episode he won the Tour de France, but was beaten up for not technically being entered. ([[Breakup in Paris]])

Mr. Moseby dances with Emma at the Seven Seas School Dance. ([[So You Think You Can Date?]]) and in [[The Play's the Thing]], Mr. Moseby, and Ms. Tutweiller officially become a couple, as they cuddle during Cody's play and then sneak off.

In [[Graduation on Deck]], Mr. Moseby proposes to Ms. Tutweiller and she says yes. Marion and Emma head off to start a new life together.

Mr. Moseby appears in "[[Karate Kid-tastrophe]]". Despite having stood up to Mr. Tipton, Mr. Moseby apparently was not fired. Four years later, Mr. Moseby now works at the [[New York City]] Tipton Hotel. All seems well for the longtime Tipton employee until he runs into a "familiar face". However, that "face" is actually [[Jessie Prescott]], who resembles Bailey Pickett from the [[S.S. Tipton]]. After noticing the resemblance, he called Cody on the phone to relay that observation only to regret it when Cody expresses an interest in coming to see for himself.
