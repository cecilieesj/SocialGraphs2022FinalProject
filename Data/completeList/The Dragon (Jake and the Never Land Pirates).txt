The '''Dragon''' is a minor antagonist from the ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'' special episode "[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Jake Saves Bucky|Jake Saves Bucky]]". The [[Dragons|dragon]] lives on the active volcano-covered island known as the [[Island of Bell]] guarding the path to the legendary golden bell. He is known to hate visitors and will attack any and all who will invade the island.





==Role in the series==
After [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew sneak aboard the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] with help from [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], they retrieve the other half of the pirate code scroll from a sleeping [[Captain Hook]]. They learn that if they can retrieve the golden bell, [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] would be theirs once more. The only thing standing in the sea pups' way was the feared fire-breathing dragon. After flying to the Island of Bell, the dragon appears to challenge the pirates. Jake and Peter distract the dragon, allowing [[Izzy]] and [[Skully]] to retrieve the golden bell.. The dragon is last seen constantly chasing after his own tail in the maze-like caves, whilst Jake and his crew regroup to steal the bell, and save Bucky from Captain Hook.

In the Season 4 episode, [[Tales of Captain Buzzard]], the dragon re-appears and traps [[Captain Buzzard Bones|Captain Buzzard]], Hook, [[Mr. Smee|Smee]], [[Sharky and Bones|Sharky, and Bones]] in a cave. Eventually Captain Jake and his crew rescue them, and with the help of Izzy's [[Pixie Dust]], the dragon is sent flying, presumably back to the Island of Bell.

== Trivia ==

* Whilst the dragon doesn't make any appearances in between the episodes, ''Jake Saves Bucky'' and ''Tales of Captain Buzzard,'' his character model was used for [[Captain Flynn]]'s dragon companion, Belchy, who appears in the episode, ''[[Cubby's Tall Tale]]''.
* Despite being called a dragon he actually resembles a Wyvern, the key difference has been that a wyvern has two legs, whereas a dragon has four. However, this distinction is not commonly observed in the heraldry of other European countries, where two-legged dragon-like creatures being called dragons is entirely acceptable.
