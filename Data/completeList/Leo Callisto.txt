==Background==
===Official Disney Bio===
:''Miles' dad is an awesome inventor, pilot, and former pro-surfer. He's laid back and utterly cool, even when flying through space junk. A passionate engineer, he's never afraid to try something new in his workshop.''

Leo Callisto is the best dad that Miles and Loretta could have. He's loving, kind, patient, and always sorts out Miles and Loretta's problems if they disagree about what activity they want to do. For example, Loretta wants to do exo-flexing and Miles wants to play quantum kick. What Leo does is turn the room off until they agree who will do their activity first.

Leo used to be great at surfing on the waves at the Zuma Whirlpool. His son seems to have picked up his skills.Â
