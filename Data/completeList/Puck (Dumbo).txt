'''Puck the Organ Grinder''' (or simply '''Puck''') is the circus' musician in the [[2019]] ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|remake of Dumbo]]''. Besides being a performer in the sideshow section, he also serves as [[Rongo the Strongo|Rongo]]'s fellow musician, using an accordion.

==Role in the film==
Puck first appears looking at [[Holt Farrier]] who is happy to see him return, only for him to lose contact with Holt. After a reminder from [[Max Medici]], Puck and the other workers continue building the tent. The next day, Puck and the other circus performers gaze upon [[Dumbo (character)|Jumbo Junior]], recently born to [[Mrs. Jumbo]] in awe. That night, Puck then recites "Hamlet" while a monkey holds a skull at the sideshow area and plays the tambourine alongside Rongo who plays the drums. Later after Mrs. Jumbo rampages across the tent, Puck and the other survivors escape from it.

Later, Puck plays an accordion alongside [[Pramesh Singh]] who plays a flute while [[Miss Atlantis]] sings "[[Baby Mine]]" just as Dumbo reunites with Mrs. Jumbo in confinement. The next day, Puck and the other performers sadly gaze upon Mrs. Jumbo being taken away just as Dumbo is sent to perform in the clown act, no longer included in the elephant one.

Furthermore, Puck and the other performers travel to an amusement park in [[Arkansas]] called Dreamland attraction as Dumbo's act was a success. After it is found out that Vandevere Enterprises has fired all the performers, Holt, his children, [[Joe Farrier|Joe]] and [[Milly Farrier|Milly]], and the performers plan to rescue Dumbo by releasing him into the wild alongside his Mrs Jumbo. Puck plays an important role in arriving at [[Nightmare Island]] which he and the other performers barge into by tricking one of the guards just as the performers take the transport vehicle with Mrs. Jumbo inside just before the park owner, [[V.A. Vandevere]], and his guards try to stop the circus troupe. Later, Puck, Joe, Milly, and the rest of the performers spend their last moments with Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo before they get released into the wild.

When the circus is re-established as Medici Family Circus, Puck joins Miss Atlantis reciting Shakespearean poems underwater.

==Trivia==
*Puck is likely named after the character in "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
*Was created solely for the remake and has no animated counterpart.
