===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
Ching instilled a strict code of conduct among her crew: no stealing from villagers, no deserting, and no taking women as prisoners. Failure to follow these rules would result in death by decapitation.

Ching was one of the [[Brethren Court|Nine Pirate Lords]], and although she voted for herself just like all the rest, she openly supported fighting the [[East India Trading Company]] once [[Elizabeth Swann]] became the Pirate King. She fought both the East India Trading Company and [[Davy Jones]]' crewmen, and she celebrated among everyone else once the battle was over and [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] is defeated for good.

She engaged the villainous [[Eduardo Villanueva|Captain Villanueva]] in battle, since Villanueva was keeping [[Jack Sparrow]] from attending the Brethen Court.

Mistress Ching and several members of the Brethren Court appear during the opening of the ride as skeletal corpses. The characters remain around a table, and it is unknown how they died. 

==Trivia==
*''Mistress'' Ching is based on the historic ''Madame'' Ching AKA Ching Shih (1775-1844). The historic Ching is renowned for being the single most successful pirate in recorded history; having commanded an enormous fleet of hundreds of ships and tens of thousands of men, dwarfing the navy fleets of several countries. She was an expert swordswoman, a brilliant businesswoman, and a skilled strategist.
**The Pirates of the Caribbean films are set decades before the historic Ching Shih would have been born with Mistress Ching's character in practice serving as an easter-egg.
**Older drafts for the film would have included famous pirates such as [[Blackbeard]], [[Anne Bonny]], Calico Jack Rackham and possibly [[Captain Hook]]. While these were scrapped, Ching's reference remains.
**Ching being found working at a brothel in the video-game could be an allusion to how the historic Madame Ching was originally a prostitute who came into ownership of her own brothels.
