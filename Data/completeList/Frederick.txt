== History ==

=== Before the First Curse ===
Frederick is the true love of [[Abigail]], and the two are engaged to be married. Frederick is accidentally turned into a gold statue by [[King Midas]] while he is defending him from robbers. After several years and many unsuccessful attempts to break the curse by Princess Abigail, [[The Prince|Prince Charming]] offers to help her undo the curse.
Prince Charming gets water from Lake Nostos, which was rumored to have magical properties, and pours it over Frederick's head, undoing the Golden Touch. After Frederick returns to flesh, he is confused and a joyful Abigail explains what happened. Frederick thanks Prince Charming for saving him.

=== During the First Curse ===
During the Curse, Jim is the gym teacher at Storybrooke elementary school. He and [[Abigail|Kathryn Nolan]] bump into each other the day she goes to confront [[Snow White|Mary Margaret]] very publicly about her affair with her husband but do not have any further interaction. Later, he is driving away from Storybrooke where he finds Kathryn's crashed car near the town border. He looks inside, sees Kathryn missing from the driver's seat and that she is nowhere to be found.

=== After the First Curse ===
After the breaking of the curse, Jim reunites with his true love, Kathryn, and they are now living together in her house.

Frederick, along with the rest of the Storybrooke residents, is sent home to the [[Enchanted Forest]] after the Dark Curse is reset by [[Peter Pan (character)|Pan]].

=== During the Second Curse ===
Due to the [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]]'s memory potion, once the curse was cast, everyone who was cursed back into Storybrooke lost their memory of their last year in the [[Enchanted Forest]].

=== After the Second Curse ===
[[Ingrid|Ingrid the Snow Queen]] casts the spell of Shattered Sight over [[Storybrooke]], making nearly all of its residents (including Frederick) turn dark.

[[Maleficent]] casts the Sleeping Curse all over [[Storybrooke]] so that everyone goes to sleep (including Frederick), unless they've been under the sleeping curse before.
