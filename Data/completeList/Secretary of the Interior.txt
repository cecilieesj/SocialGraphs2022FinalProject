However, Dusty joins on the conversation between [[Harvey and Winnie]] instead. The Secretary is later present attending a ceremony about a commemorative plaque to which Pulaski warns Cad about the wildfire increasing at Piston Peak to which he refuses to listen to him and Jammer, much to his corrupt behavior.
