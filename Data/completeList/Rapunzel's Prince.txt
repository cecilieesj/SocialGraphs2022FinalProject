'''Rapunzel's Prince''' is one of the six tritagonists from the film, ''[[Into the Woods]]''. He is loosely based on the Prince from the tale ''Rapunzel''.

==Background==
Rapunzel's Prince is a dashing and eager young man who courts [[Rapunzel (Into the Woods)|Rapunzel]]. He is the younger of the two royal brothers. He is handsome, charming, brave, and kind-hearted, but also impulsive. He also gets along well with his brother, greeting him warmly and teasing him about a girl running away from him. 

Quite the opposite of his older, thrill-seeking [[Cinderella's Prince|brother]], he genuinely cares for Rapunzel and remains faithful to her. Even after being blinded by the [[Witch (Into the Woods)|Witch]], he doggedly continues to search for his beloved, and defends her from the Witch. 

==''[[Into the Woods]]''==
While riding through the kingdom, he hears beautiful singing coming from a tower with no doors or stairs. He watches from afar as the young woman inside is greeted by her adopted mother. As the Witch calls out Rapunzel's name and climbs her hair, the young prince becomes smitten. 

Rapunzel's Prince later meets up with his older brother and listens to his story about a beautiful girl who ran away from the ball. The younger prince responds with his own story about the maiden in the tower with the longest yellow hair he had ever seen. The elder brother teases Rapunzel's Prince over Rapunzel's name. In response, the younger brother expresses doubt that a woman would run away from the elder brother. The two of them sing "Agony," dramatically posing and splashing around the stream. At one point, Cinderella's Prince rips his shirt open, and Rapunzel's Prince, not wanting to be outdone, quickly unbuttons his own. The two of them vow to marry the women they long for.

Rapunzel's Prince goes to visit Rapunzel in her tower, sharing a kiss with her before leaving. He leaps out the window and tries to swing down to safety on Rapunzel's hair, but ends up hitting the wall outside. He lowers himself to the ground and assures Rapunzel that he is okay, then rides off. The Witch, who was watching nearby, casts a spell that causes a large mass of bramble bushes to grow in front of the prince. This spooks the horse he was riding, sending him flying forward into the brambles, which stab into his eyes.

Despite being blind, he searches for Rapunzel. Eventually, he reunites with her in a dense swamp deep within the woods. Seeing his injured eyes, Rapunzel holds him and cries. Her tears fall onto his eyes and restore his sight. He kisses Rapunzel and says he likes her new hair.

After he regains his sight, he takes Rapunzel home to the castle, and marries her the same day his brother marries Cinderella. When the giant shakes up the castle, Rapunzel runs away and her prince runs after her. He eventually finds her with the Witch at the ruined tower. The Witch tries to zap the prince with magic when Rapunzel refuses to leave with her. He says that the Witch is the one who blinded him. Rapunzel also blames the witch for trapping her in a tower all of her life and then banishing her to a swamp. Rapunzel then tells her prince to take her far away from the witch. He then takes off on his horse with her into the distance. It is unknown what happened to them after that.
