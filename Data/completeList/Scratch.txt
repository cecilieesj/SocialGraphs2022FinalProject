Although he has the appearance of a [[Stitch]]-like [[Experiments|genetic experiment]], he isn't one at all; he is actually a "morph creature" capable of materializing and transforming objects, as well as changing his own appearance.

Scratch was created from Stitch's DNA by a tetrahedron-shaped device called a Tetra-Tab that was sent by the Jaboodies. One of the features was used when Stitch wished for a brother. Once inside the app, the device sampled Stitch's DNA which allowed the alien to assume the identity known as Scratch in order to help coerce Stitch into activating his destructive programming.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Scratch is similar in appearance to [[Stitch]], but with pale green fur, tiger stripes, curved antennae, and bigger, pointier spines. Both of his ears have more notches than Stitch's.

===Powers and abilities===
Scratch possesses the power of telekinesis. He can use his antennae to shoot a green ray that can materialize anything his mind thinks of. He can also instantly repair what has been broken and transform machinery. As a morph creature, Scratch can alter his appearance at will.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch & Ai]]''===
Scratch first appeared in the episode "Brothers". [[Stitch]] and [[Wang Ai Ling|Ai]] both wished for a brother, so they touched a prism that [[Pleakley]] found, and it instantly created Ling and Scratch. Stitch, Ai, Ling, and Scratch all had fun playing games and enjoyed each other's company. [[Meiying]] and her friends showed up, and Ai introduced Scratch and Ling. Ai suggested they play a game of double Dutch, and Meiying agreed. It is revealed that Scratch is actually an alien capable of morphing his appearance. The Jaboodies had sent Scratch to help activate Stitch's metamorphosis code in his programming in order to use Stitch in their war against the Woolagongs.
