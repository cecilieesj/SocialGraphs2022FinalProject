'''Chuck Pearson''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the father of [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] and [[Moose Pearson]] and the ex-husband of [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]]. Despite being divorced, he still plays a big part in his two daughters' lives and tries to be as helpful as possible.

==Background==
Chuck Pearson is a British zeppelin pilot who met the traveling Lilly Family and fell in love with the eldest daughter [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]]. They entered a relationship before getting married and had two daughters [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] and [[Moose Pearson|Moose]]. He missed the latter's birth due to the nature of his job and sometime afterwards, he and Lydia divorced. A very young Pepper Ann tried to bring them back together, but ultimately learned to deal with it. Since then, Chuck never missed an opportunity to visit his daughters and maintains a strong friendship with Lydia.

Chuck started to visit more often in Pepper Ann's tween-years and would take the her and Moose on various outings. He would remind her eldest daughter that even though they do not live together anymore, he still loves her and would never forget about her. At one point, Pepper Ann set him up with a woman named Sarah (pronounced Ser-ah "like the song") because she felt that he would be lonely seeing Lydia dating someone else, but this turned out to be a non-issue as he cared more about his daughter's happiness.

Chuck is absent in "[[The Finale]]", though it can be assumed that he still is involved in Pepper Ann and Moose's lives.

===Personality===
Chuck is, in Pepper Ann's eyes, the ideal father figure. He is very caring and supportive and always has positive words to leave. He is very intelligent and can tell when something is bothering Pepper Ann, though admittedly he can be quite confused with how she chose to go about with dealing with the issue. He is very good at maintaining relationships as there is no bad blood between him and Lydia and he clearly cares for her as she is technically family. While he can sometimes find Pepper Ann's shenanigans outrageous like everyone else, he loves his family unconditionally.

===Physical appearance===
Chuck is a Caucasian man of average height with short amber hair, a dark unibrow and a noticeable cleft in his chin. He usually wears a dark green shirt, dark blue jacket, brown dress pants and belt and dark brown shoes.

==Trivia==
*A running gag throughout the first two seasons is that his face is never shown. Starting with the season two finale "[[That's My Dad]]", the series begins to show his face, possibly because the staff wanted to use him more often and it would have been difficult to do this with his face covered the whole time.
