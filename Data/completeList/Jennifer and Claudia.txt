'''Jennifer and Claudia''' are two beautiful blonde twin girls on ''[[The Replacements]]''. They are normally seen with [[Sierra McCool]]. The girls make their first (non-speaking) appearance in "[[The Jerky Girls]]" and their last appearance in "[[R2: A Tale of Two Rileys]]".

==Physical Appearance==
Jennifer has wavy hair in a ponytail. She wears pink hoop earrings, a periwinkle dress, and purple shoes. Starting with season 2, she wears a purple belt and stud earrings. Claudia has shorter hair than Jennifer. She wears an aqua green dress with a pink flower in the center, and blue shoes.

==Trivia==
*In the first season episodes "[[The Insecurity Guard]]" and "[[Carnie Dearest]]", a common gag was for the two girls to be commenting on what they are wearing (which are actually identical to each other), when Todd lands in a mud puddle next to them, ruining their clothes. ("The Insecurity Guard" also marked their first speaking appearance, although Jennifer had two brief lines in the previous episode "[[CindeRiley]]".)
*The show never actually reveals whether or not they are sisters (let alone twins), but this fact is hinted, based on the gag above.
*Jennifer wears earrings, while Claudia does not.
*Both of the girls wear socks with their shoes.
*Jennifer was voiced by Lauren Tom, while Claudia was voiced by Erica Hubbard for season 1 and Tempestt Bledsoe for season 2. (Jennifer spoke less in season 2, than she did in season 1.)
*Coincidentally, the name "Claudia" was also used for one of the names for [[the Bimbettes]] from ''Beauty and the Beast'', who similar to Jennifer and Claudia, were also a set of identical blonde sisters (in their case, triplets).
*Both Jennifer and Claudia like being with Sierra the same way [[W:c:camplazlo: Chip and Skip|Chip and Skip]] like being with [[W:c:camplazlo:Edward Platypus|Edward Platypus]] from [[W:c:camplazlo:Camp Lazlo|Camp Lazlo]].
