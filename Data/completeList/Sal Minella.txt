'''Sal Minella''' is a monkey Muppet who serves as the flunky, bodyguard and all-purpose assistant to [[Johnny Fiama]]. Sal is devoted to [[Johnny Fiama]], though some of his ideas to promote Johnny's career are a bit harebrained.

The puppet used for Sal originated as a generic, unclothed monkey, performing a solo line in the song "[[Shiver My Timbers]]" from ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''. In that appearance, he was performed by [[Jerry Nelson]].

The monkey was subsequently refitted with a vest and tie and made his debut as Sal Minella in ''{{WikipediaLink|Muppets Tonight}}''.

[[Brian Henson]] left the Muppets in [[2005]], a year after the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] purchase, and Sal was reduced to background roles before being quietly retired along with Johnny.

In [[2020]], it was revealed that both the Johnny and Sal puppets had been rebuilt. They made their return in the [[2021]] [[Disney+]] film, ''[[Muppets Haunted Mansion]]'', with Brian Henson reprising his role for the first time in 16 years.

==Trivia==
*Sal Minella's film appearance in Muppets from Space is owned by Sony Pictures, It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie is owned by NBCUniversal, and the other Muppet movies are owned by Disney (along with the rest of the Muppet franchise).
