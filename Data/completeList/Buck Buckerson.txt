'''Buck Buckerson''' is a minor former antagonist of the animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. He is a monster truck rally champion and [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]'s main competitor in "[[It's a Mud, Mud, Mud, Mud World]]."

==History==
When [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] needed to learn how to parallel park, [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] built a mud track in their backyard for her to practice, bringing Buck along with them to challenge her. At the end, Candace won the parallel parking challenge after Buck made the same mistake as she did during her first attempt, in spite of his driving skills. Phineas and Ferb let Buck have the rally after they used it ("[[It's a Mud, Mud, Mud, Mud World]]").
