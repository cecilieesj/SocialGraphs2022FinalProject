While the situation seems completely against them, a SHIELD jet flies over, unleashing Man-Thing in the form of a green liquid mass that disintegrates any ghoul it comes into contact with.

However, Man-Thing and the rest of the Commandos are betrayed by [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] to take the cursed Ankh for himself. As N'Kantu escapes to New York now overflowing with the Ankh's power, Spider-Man gets Man-Thing to travel through the sewers, absorbing enough sewage so that he can grow to titanic size and hold off N-Kantu long enough for the other heroes to get the Ankh off N'Kantu.
