Ashlyn is the daughter of Dennis and Debbie Caswell. She is [[E.J. Caswell]]'s cousin. Ashlyn is currently a student at [[East High School]]. Ashlyn was a sophomore at [[East High School]] in Season 1 and Season 2. In Season 1, Ashlyn was casted as [[Ms. Darbus]] in [[East High School]]'s fall production ''[[High School Musical]]''.

==Background==
Ashlyn is brash and gutsy, Ashlyn’s mouthy attitude covers “new kid” self-doubt. A slightly woo-woo horoscope reader, she’s finding her place in the school hierarchy. Or trying to. (It helps that her cousin E.J. is a senior.) Worships Sara Bareilles and is an aspiring songwriter on the sly. Can’t wait till she’s old enough to vote, and she’ll march and protest in the meantime. Whether she’s cast in the musical or not, she’s got her eye on student council. Her most-used app is Headspace, for meditation (and because of her crush on the disembodied Buddha voice). Voted “Most likely to read your palm.”<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/high-school-musical-series-development-190058962.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy]</ref>

===Personality===
Ashlyn is an extremely kind, determined and level headed person who does not let her nerves get in her way.
