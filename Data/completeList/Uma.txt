{{Quote|The world will know my name!|Uma}}

'''Uma''' is the main antagonist who appears in the sequel ''[[Descendants 2]] ''and the secondary antagonist turned deuteragonist/anti-hero in ''[[Descendants 3]]''. She is the daughter of [[Ursula]].

Uma commands a crew of pirates, who are kept in line by her first mate Harry Hook. While never made official, Uma has become the ''de facto'' leader of the Isle of the Lost since Maleficent was defeated.

==Background==
Years ago, on the [[Isle of the Lost]], [[Mal]] wasn't just friends with Mad Maddy; she also teamed up with the daughter of the [[Ursula|Sea Witch]], Uma for all kinds of mischief. However, an attempt to prank the especially mean [[Cruella De Vil]] leads Mal to seemingly fall off the docks and into the water. Uma laughs at her instead of saving her, only for Mal to surprise her and dump a bucket of shrimp on Uma in return. No matter how much Uma tried to wash her hair, the disgusting smell never left her hair. Mal then got everyone to call Uma the name Shrimpy.

===Personality===
Despite being cruel and ruthless, Uma does care about her gang as she had an opportunity to attack Mal from behind, but gave it up to help Harry when he asked her for help.

===Physical appearance===
Uma has a slender figure, brown skin, dark brown eyes and black eyebrows, and long braided aqua hair. She wears her [[Ursula's Necklace|mother's necklace]] around her neck and is dressed in a turquoise leather jacket with epaulets, that is slightly military looking to represent her leadership and strength as a captain. Uma also wears a purple mesh shirt under her military jacket, a belt along with a turquoise fringed skirt, brown distressed boots, turquoise nail polish, and a black tricorn hat. As a giant cecaelia, she has aqua colored tentacles.

===Powers and abilities===
Being the daughter of [[Ursula]], Uma inherited the following powers:
*'''Sea Magic''': Like her mother, Uma is able to manipulate magic from the sea, with the power given to her by the necklace.
** '''Spell Casting:''' Uma possesses the power to cast spells. She places Ben under a love spell using Mal's Spell Book.
** '''Potion Making:''' Uma possesses the ability to concoct potions, and elixirs that have supernatural effects.

==Appearances==
===''[[Descendants 2]]''===
Uma is first seen as her crew, including Harry Hook, and Gil are watching a broadcast in the fish and chips shop on the Isle of the Lost of Mal and Ben's press conference. Uma and her best friend, Harry Hook, mock her through the broadcast calling her a poser and a traitor before the rest of the crew (with some "encouragement" from Uma) join in the mockery with some even throwing their trays of food at the TV. Harry and Uma furiously envy themselves, and grind against Mal who she believes left them in the dirt, and turned her back on evil before Gil brings up her past. Having had enough of living in Mal's shadow, Uma decides to attempt an invasion of Auradon before she and her crew launch into a song about her plans to take over the kingdom (What's My Name). The little celebration is then interrupted by Ursula, Uma's mother who orders her to shut up and finish the dishes in the kitchen. Uma promises her crew that as soon as she sees an opportunity to take over Auradon, she will take it, and that her name will be remembered before throwing Gil out for calling her Shrimpy.

After Uma learns that Mal is back on the Isle, she kidnapped Ben and held him hostage, ordering for Mal to come to the fish and chips shop to get him. She challenged Mal to an arm wrestling match and distracts Mal so she can win. She tells her she wants the Fairy Godmother's wand in exchange for Ben tomorrow or she will never see him again.

King Ben has been kidnapped by Uma and her gang of pirates; they demand the Fairy Godmother's wand in exchange for releasing him. The VKs create a dummy wand to exchange for Ben. Uma has a heartfelt discussion with Ben to which they discuss the condition of the Isle and how his duties as king extended beyond just Auradon. When they arrive, Uma and her crew break into song (It's Goin' Down), delighted at the idea of finally escaping the Isle. Mal's group likewise sing that they should peacefully give Ben up. Ben, thinking the wand is real, tries getting Uma and Mal to abandon the deal, only to be mocked for his kindness by Uma. Before taking the wand, however, Uma wanted to see if the wand was real and told Mal to cast a spell. Mal fakes a spell to make Dude talk, not because of the wand but because of Mal's truth gummy he ate meant for Carlos earlier and she bought it. When the exchange was done however, Uma then quickly realized the wand was a forgery and snapped it in two, furiously screaming that Mal does not get to win every time and the two parties break out into a sword fight but the VKs eventually escape, unknown to them that Mal left her spell book behind.

Uma used Mal's spell book to enchant Ben to "fall in love with her" and bring her to the Cotillion. However the spell was broken when Mal kissed Ben, infuriating Uma (again). She jumped off the ship and turned into a giant octopus and Mal turns into a huge purple dragon, just like their mothers. They were about to fight when Ben intervened and talked it out of them. Uma, without a word, gave Ben back the ring he gave her and gave one last look at all of them before swimming away into the ocean.

At the end of the credits, Uma came back up to the surface to look at Auradon, later facing the audience assuring them that it was not the end of the story, just like Mal did in the first movie.

===''[[Descendants 3]]''===
Uma poses a threat to Auradon as Mal and Ben prepare for VK Day. She doesn't make an appearance until the VKs and Celia are confronted by Harry and Gil after leaving the Isle, and Harry accidentally causes Mal to drop the ember into the sea. Uma appears as a giant cecaelia and catches the ember with one of her tentacles, snidely asking Mal if she dropped it. She then proceeds to transform into a human and appears on the broken bridge, ember in hand. She explains how she was searching for a hole in the barrier to liberate all the Isle's inhabitants, and telling her crew how good Auradon has it. Uma finds it humorous that an AK poses as a threat and uses the ember to bargain with Mal: she helps them in exchange for releasing all the villain kids. Mal agrees (albeit under duress). However Uma keeps the ember to ensure Mal's cooperation, much to the latter's anger. When Evie suggests they try to get along, Uma and her team are incredulous to the request.

The VKs and Uma's team arrive in Auradon to find everyone either asleep or turned to stone. Harry and Jay get into a scuffle and Uma and Mal are forced to put a stop to it. Uma suggests they check the school to look for Audrey and Celia goes with them, but Mal says they should go to the castle. Mal and Uma get into yet another argument over authority until Evie puts a stop to it.

They start looking for Ben in the castle and Uma notices claw marks and the destruction of a painting, arousing fear. The group enter a gallery where Uma pridefully asks Mal whether the latter was nervous about Uma being on the loose. Mal fires back by wondering aloud how fried octopus tastes, and Evie has to stop the bickering. When Uma and Mal start disagreeing over where to look for Audrey, Harry alerts them that Audrey has enchanted the knights. Then they are forced to battle on the same side (Night Falls).

After defeating the knights Mal and Uma go to their respective groups to celebrate their victory, and Evie once again tries to get them to get along. The latter attempts an icebreaker to which Uma scoffs at. Mal gives them the plan, to which Uma states was her original idea.

Uma and Celia go to Audrey's dorm to search for anything regarding the latter's whereabouts. Uma finds Audrey's diary and jokes about how Mal ruined the former's life. She tells Mal and Evie that Audrey likes to hang out at Fairy Cottage, but not without taking a jab at Mal. She then wonders how anyone who had a bed like Audrey's could be unhappy.

Mal, Evie, Uma and Celia go to Evie's Cottage where they find Dizzy, Squirmy, Squeaky, and Doug sound asleep. Uma tells Evie to wake up Doug with a true love's kiss. (One Kiss). Later, Uma and Celia are eating Jane's birthday cake when Mal commends Uma on her idea to check the dorms. Uma asks her if she failed to find an insult in the statement, to which Mal declines. Mal then apologizes for the Shrimpy incident and for making fun of her, and Uma says they could've run the Isle together. However, their talk is cut short when Audrey magically traps them all inside the house. Uma and Mal combine their magic together to break the spell. Uma then jokes how her necklace likes Mal before Celia alerts them that the boys have arrived.

Uma embraces Gil and Harry, and Ben tells her that he knew she'd be part of the "solution". The group then comes up with a plan to find Audrey and Fairy Godmother. Uma and Harry go with Ben, Celia, Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos to Fairy Cottage, but all they find is a terrorized Chad Charming. Uma then asks Mal if they could finally put their differences aside, but Mal tells the group that she lied and no more villain kids would leave the Isle. Uma becomes angered at the deception and states trusting Mal was a mistake. She watches as Celia confronts Mal in tears, who takes the ember from Mal and tosses it into water out of anger, neutralizing its powers. Uma knows her necklace could power it up again, but she said “Bummer.” She and Harry leave the group.

Mal catches up with her later and pleads for Uma to help, but Uma, still upset, tells her to fix the problem she created and proceeds to leave. However, Uma and Harry come back upon witnessing Mal in her dragon state, who had summoned it upon realizing Audrey was holding Celia captive. Uma changes her mind and helps Mal, realizing that turning her back on Mal wasn't right and that Mal can't stop Audrey without the ember. Uma uses her necklace and the powers of both her and Mal power up the ember once more. When Mal defeats Audrey, Uma and Harry celebrate in triumph.

With Audrey on the verge of death, Mal proposes that Hades wake her up and he'd do it for the former since he was her father. Uma requests that she return to the Isle, as someone needed to protect it in case of danger. Harry affirms his support as well. Celia also asks if she could go with them, and Uma is proud of this. Before they leave, Mal tells Uma that they would have made good friends. Uma also accepts Mal's apology for lying, realizing that Mal cares about both Auradon and the Isle and that she was trying to do the right thing and protect both places.

During Mal and Ben's engagement party, they permanently lift up the barrier separating Auradon from the Isle. Uma exclaims proudly that this was her plan before joyfully breaking into song. (Break This Down). The VKs are courteously welcomed into Auradon by the AKs and they celebrate this.
