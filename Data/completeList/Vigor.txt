==Appearances==
===''[[Tangled]]''===
Vigor was intended to appear in the film ''[[Tangled]]'' in a scene that most likely was meant to occur sometime after the [[The Snuggly Duckling|Snuggly Duckling]] scene. Directors [[Nathan Greno]] and [[Byron Howard]] did not offer much context on how the scene was conceived or why they chose to remove it.

After leaving the Snuggly Duckling by a fortune teller caravan, they are entertained by the owner Madame Canardist, or rather a prototype version of her, who reveals Vigor who is wearing a rather anachronistic tuxedo and top hat. After Canardist changes his attire to a more traditional fortune teller costume he proceeds to "read" [[Flynn Rider]]'s face and reveals that he will attain "untold wealth and beauty", but have it "slip through [his] grasp as [he reaches] the end of [his] rope", most likely referring to his death by [[Mother Gothel]] and revival by [[Rapunzel]].

Vigor next reads Rapunzel's face and is shocked by what he senses. He pulls out a box and a key to reveal a Russian stacking doll with a flower inside (there is something "special inside" of her), a candle (she will find answers where the flames burn eternal), a comb brush (a familiar face will arrive in the nick of time), a small domino mask (remove the mask to reveal the truth) and a small boat on wheels with a red cloaked figure in it (a figure in red will keep Rapunzel from her "destiny").

Not yet finished, Vigor dumps small pieces of gold on the table and begins forming a shape. While clearly forming the Sun Crest of [[Corona]], he is unable to finish it due to Flynn/Eugene getting spotted by [[Maximus]] and the soldiers who in response knocks over the table and drags Rapunzel away from learning the truth.

===''[[Tangled: The Series|Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure]]''===
Vigor makes his first proper appearance in the television spin-off ''[[Tangled: The Series|Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure]]'' in the self-titled episode "[[Vigor the Visionary]]". The set up is almost identical to how he was to be introduced in the film albeit in only a diaper and turban. His predictions are more benign as he, or rather Madame Canardist, gives Rapunzel a card reading, "If you see someone fall pick them up". He is later kidnapped by [[Angry and Red]] due to having given them a fortune reading, "Follow the leaf to find your tree", interpreting this as meaning Angry's family they "borrowed" Vigor to help lead the way.

Vigor travels with the four, offering very little on his journey. Ultimately, the prediction he gave to Rapunzel turns out to be true as she uses her hair to catch Eugene after he fell from a cliff. Angry realizes that Vigor's fortune was most likely referring to Red due to her being the only family she has. Vigor is returned to Madame Canardist, having changed very little between the start of his journey and the end.

He reappears in "[[Curses! (Tangled)|Curses!]]" where he takes on a slightly more antagonistic role, cursing Rapunzel after he takes her telescope back from them without paying them. He does not appear again until near the end and give Eugene a unusually out of character look before returning to Madame Canardist.

In "[[Lost and Found (Tangled)|Lost and Found]]", he appears again to show Rapunzel and Eugene the way to the fourth and final piece of the scroll inside a labyrinth. It was then revealed that [[Lord Demanitus]]' spirit emerged within Vigor, waiting for the right moment to show himself and guide them to use the scroll and its information for the right reasons.

In "[[Plus Est En Vous]]", a flashback reveals Vigor was owned by Lord Demanitus one thousand years before the engineer sealed his spirit into the monkey.

==Trivia==
*Despite the removal of the character in the movie ''Tangled'', Vigor has been illustrated in the credits during "[[Something That I Want]]" song.
*Vigor was around during Demanitus' time, meaning he is at least 1000 years old.
