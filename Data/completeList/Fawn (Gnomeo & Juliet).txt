'''Fawn''' is a deer statue, an ally of the Red Gnomes, [[Tybalt]]'s best friend and a supporting character in the 2011 film ''[[Gnomeo & Juliet]].''

He is voiced by [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

==Role in film==
He was first seen noticing that Tybalt was choking on a snail and helped him get it out. He later came to the lawn mower race between Tybalt and Gnomeo. When the rule against cheating was announced, he replied, "No cheating? Hey, that's not fair!" After the race, he told Tybalt that he's "the greatest by fair."

Later that night, he was playing a card game with the small red gnomes. He loses with the common theme of ''Spider-Man'' films. When the spotlights went on because of Benny's paint can, he tried to get to Gnomeo, but failed. He was with Tybalt when they bumped into Juliet and asked her if she had seen Gnomeo, to which she replied that she had not.

The next morning, he helped washed off the blue paint off of Tybalt's wishing well and asks why would anyone do this to Tybalt, with the small red gnomes replying, "Because nobody likes him." Fawn asks Tybalt what they're going to do in response to the Blues, and Tybalt answering that they'll "find their weak spot" and do "lots and lots of damage." They are implied to have destroyed the blue garden's most prized plant. Fawn was later fanning Tybalt when an alert about a Blue was called. Later, after Tybalt sees Benny go out into the alley, Fawn asks Tybalt what they're going to do, with him replying that they're going to "have a smashing time."

Fawn watched as Tybalt sliced off Benny's hat and fought Gnomeo. When Tybalt ran into a wall and get smashed to pieces, he mourned Tybalt's death for a moment before he and the small red gnomes angerly attacked Gnomeo, sending him to the road. Fawn later fought in a war between the red and blue gnomes. Feeling guilty for all that had happened, Fawn and the other gnomes made up and ended the feud. He was relieved when he saw Gnomeo and Juliet alive and well. He later witnessed Gnomeo and Juliet's wedding along with Tybalt, who was glued back together and reformed. In the same scene, he danced with Tybalt and assisted him when his limbs began to fall off.
