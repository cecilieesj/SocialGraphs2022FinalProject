'''Owen Lars''' is the son of moisture farmer [[w:c:starwars:Cliegg Lars|Cliegg Lars]] and the step-brother of [[Anakin Skywalker]]. He married [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]], and after his father's death, he inherited his job as a moisture farmer. In 19 BBY, Beru convinced Owen to adopt Anakin's son, [[Luke Skywalker]], as Anakin had turned to the dark side and become the infamous [[Darth Vader]].

Many years later, he bought [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] from [[Jawas]]. He met his demise along with Beru, being killed by the Empire's [[Stormtroopers]] who were led to their home, before Luke could save them.

==Background==
===Personality===
Owen was a kind and caring individual, but he was also gruff and strict, which often created tension between him and his step-nephew, [[Luke Skywalker]], and which often forced his wife, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]] to mediate between the two, Owen bore great disdain towards the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], as he believed that [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] had warped his step-brother, [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s mind into leaving Shmi alone on [[Tatooine]], an act he considered to be unimaginable. Owen felt that Obi-Wan was personally responsible for the deaths of Shmi and Anakin and, that the Jedi Master's actions had ripped his family apart.

Despite his dislike of the Jedi and Kenobi in particular, Owen did have honor, refusing to turn Kenobi in when several Sith [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] came looking for him. Despite this, he stressed that he did it for his family, not for Kenobi. 

When Obi-Wan left Luke under Owen's reluctant protection as an infant, he told the Jedi Master to stay away from them, fearing that Obi-Wan would create similar consequences with his step-nephew in the future; to keep Luke from following in Anakin's footsteps, Owen lied to the latter about his Jedi heritage, claiming that his father was simply a navigator on a spice freighter. When Luke desired to leave Tatooine, Owen found it difficult to ignore his gruff, protective nature, which had become habitual over the years and, tried to come up with excuses to keep Luke from leaving Tatooine. Owen failed to realize that he was running out of excuses and, that it was inevitable that Luke would discover the truth about his Jedi heritage.

==Film Appearances==
===''Attack of the Clones''===
Owen meets his step-brother, [[Anakin Skywalker]], and his girlfriend, [[Padme Amidala]].

===''Revenge of the Sith''===
In the final act, an infant Luke is sent to live with his step-uncle Owen and his wife, Beru on [[Tatooine]]. After they received their infant nephew from Anakin's former Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Owen and Beru looked at the binary sunset together with the Luke in their arms, vowing to keep him safe from the newly formed [[Galactic Empire]].

===''A New Hope''===
Nineteen years after adopting Luke, Owen bought [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] from [[Jawas]]. Along with Beru, he met his demise from the Empire's [[Stormtroopers]] who were led to their home and, was killed before Luke could return home and save them.

==Television==
===''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]''===
In the first episode, Owen and his wife Beru were raising Anakin's son Luke. One day, he discovers that Obi-Wan had left a toy T-16 Skyhopper for Luke, only to return it to Obi-wan and told him to stay away from Luke. The two got into an argument until [[Reva Sevander|the Third Sister]] arrived to demand to know the location of any Jedi, Reva threatens Owen, but Owen refused to say anything. After the [[Inquisitorius]] took off, Obi-Wan thank him for not giving him away, only to tell him, he wasn't doing it for him.

==Trivia==
*In the original scripts for ''Return of the Jedi'', Owen was revealed to be [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan]]'s brother. This is also mentioned in the [[W:c:starwars:Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (novel)|''Return of the Jedi'' novelization]]. This was later retconned in ''Attack of the Clones'' and in all other media that he is Anakin's step-brother.
