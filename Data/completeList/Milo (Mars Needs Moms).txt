He is portrayed by [[Seth Green]], who could physically embody the movements of a child, but because Green's voice was too mature, it got removed and replaced by that of an actual child actor, newcomer [[Seth Dusky]].

==Background==
Milo is a 9-year-old American boy who has an argument with his mother after she sets him chores to complete over the summer when he wants it to be fun. After Milo breaks his mother's "No broccoli, no TV" rule by feeding it to the cat (who then pukes) and attempting to watch TV when he was supposed to eat it, he gets sent to bed early as punishment. Milo instead bounces on the bed and, exasperated, wish his life would be easier without her, thus making her very sad and upset. His "wish" comes true as the Martians come and steal his mother so she can raise their young. In order to rescue his mother, he boards the Martians' spaceship. He eventually meets up with [[Gribble]], who himself lost his mother to the Martians.

After Gribble's reluctance, they eventually decide to rescue Milo's mother before sunrise. They team up with [[Ki]], and together are able to stop the rule of the Supervisor over the Martians and save his mother. Milo and his mother return home, where he now completes his chores much to the surprise of his father.

==Role in the [[Mars Needs Moms|film]]==
Milo is introduced as a boy who is persuaded by his mother to take out the trash as well as doing his responsibilities around his household. Milo then talks to his father telling him that his flight is likely canceled at the airport just his mother talks to him. During dinner time, Milo refuses to finish eating his broccoli just as she warns him that he won't be allowed to watch until he eats broccoli. As Milo feeds his cat Cujo some broccoli which poisons him, his mother becomes very angry with him for lying to her just as she sends him to bed as punishment with no TV. During a heated argument, Milo goes as far to say that he wish that he had no mother at all, breaking her heart. Suddenly, Cujo walks up to a sulking Milo who plans to apologize to his mother for lying and disobeying her, and hurting her feelings with his hurtful statement, but he notices a Martian spaceship abducting her which was a warning that Milo's "wish" that would come true later on. Milo attempts to protest to Martians abducting her but they ignore his empty protests just as Milo finds himself inside a rocket.

As the rocket blasts off into Outer Space, Milo finds himself in Mars where all the inhabitants around him are Martians. Milo ends up in the Martians' chamber where he finds himself to look for anyone to help him albeit with low gravity. He suddenly hears Gribble telling him to jump down a nearby chute just as two Martians prepare to kill him with their laser blasters just as Milo finds himself in a pile of rubbish. Confusing the nearby Martians around him for zombies, he prepares to fight until he decides that he wants to find his mother to which he describes what his mother does to him like feeding, washing his clothes, and other chores she does at one with her at home until Gribble takes him away from the Martians using a robot named Two-Cat to rescue him from being attacked. He then encounters another human named Gribble who introduces himself to him. He explains to Gribble that he is planning to find his mother to which he calls the belt he gives to Milo the "Gribblemeister 3000" to help him withstand low gravity. Gribble then tells Milo to look at the footage of how he escaped from the Martians. Looking at the footage, Gribble gives Milo a translator to understand what the Martians are saying to which it is found out that Martians trying to catch Milo are arguing during the chase, leaving them distracted.

Gribble then takes Milo to another room for Milo himself where he introduces the creature inside the room as Wingnut just as Gribble and Milo become friends. The conversation, however, is interrupted as Milo finds out what the Supervisor is doing to his mother. Telling Gribble about this, he explains to him about that Martians are born popping out of fragile ground every 25 years and the Martians have bad treatment to their own babies and all the Martians taking control of the chamber are females followed by the Martians building Nanny-bots to raise them. Gribble then shows footage of Milo and his mother's moments at Earth before Milo's mother was abducted just as Gribble explains that the hobbies the Martians do are order and discipline to which Milo tells Gribble about what the Martians will do to his mother.

Gribble explains to Milo that whenever the Martians abduct a human mother with a memory extraction machine, it takes out the discipline of her and put it into Nanny-bots and all the memories from a mother are extracted and put into each Nanny-bot during sunrise. This causes Milo to be upset about this and causes him to make a plan to save her to which Gribble refuses just as he gives him a Martian wristwatch which shows the bars that give out the countdown to sunrise, explaining that Milo has about less than seven hours left before sunrise to save his mother. Gribble then devises a plan to disguise Milo as a Martian to avoid getting spotted by them.

Disguised as a Martian, Gribble explains to Milo that the SISS (Supervisor's Secret Security) is a group of Martians in black uniforms patrolling the Martians' chamber under tyranny of the Supervisor while Milo sets off the enter the chamber just as Gribble tells Two-Cat that Milo should be safe. Inside the chamber, Milo finds himself where he notices many Martian agents marching across the chamber just as Gribble explains the one in charge of the chamber is the Supervisor, describing her as a tyrannical leader who controls everything in her chamber. Milo then approaches another tower known as the Citadel where his mother is at just as Gribble watches over Milo planning to continue his plan.

Milo then tries to get pass the security gate but Gribble manages to help Milo on his mission. Milo then follows two guards to which Gribble manages to trap them as Milo continues his plan to find his mother. Escaping from them, Milo is confused to know which way is the area where his mother is at. Milo, however, loses contact with Gribble while in a dark area known as the Citadel. Inside it, Milo encounters a nearby Martian girl named Ki who manages to save him from falling off. Nervous with her, Milo tries to escape from her, only for Ki to explain to him what powers he has. Explaining how she learned human language, Ki explains that she was working at an administration block while the Supervisor was viewing some Earth documents along with her assistant elder where she was copying the language the humans say on Earth fluently while watching a sitcom TV show.

After talking to Milo, he explains to Ki about saving his mother to which Ki explained that she overheard Milo planning not to have a mother at all to which his plan of not having his mother taking care of him was wrong. Milo explains to Ki that his mother is kind, takes him to Disneyland, and other things she does kindly to her son. Just as the conversation stops, Ki notices Milo escaping via chute to and ends up in junk piles again. Arriving at the area, Milo only has five and a half hours left before sunrise. Milo then finds canister with a message preventing Martians from entering his room in which inside is a red sneaker and a shirt with an image of Gribble and his late mother. Milo then finds Two-Cat just as he plans to find Gribble who is captured by the Martians just as the Supervisor summons her SISS soldiers to shoot him down, but the plan is disrupted when Milo arrives at the Martians' chamber to save Gribble from being shot down. Enraged, the Supervisor summons a group of Martian soldiers to stop Milo from escaping while she forces Ki to shoot them but she refuses and gives the weapon to Milo instead much to her anger. Milo then uses a blaster he received from Ki just as Milo uses it to make a hatch in order to escape alongside Gribble while avoiding the Martian soldiers. Escaping from the guards, the two end up in the junk pile area again. Suddenly, he and Gribble encounter Wingnut in front of a group of male Martians (the ones Milo encountered when he arrived at the area). The celebration is disrupted as the SISS soldiers arrive and prepare to kill them. Fortunately, Milo and Gribble end up at a translucent cavern while Milo checks that he only has three and a half hours left before sunrise. Milo and a Gribble plan on building a whole new lair to which they argue briefly. Milo then shows the t-shirt of a young Gribble and his mother to him to which he shows a tragic flashback of the Martians taking his mother. After telling Milo the flashback, Gribble then plans to team up with him to get Milo's mother back alongside with Ki who agrees to help the two alongside Two-Cat. At the cavern, Milo shows the prophecy of a true Martian family and the true meaning of love to which Ki explains that the Supervisor always had a tradition of Martians being raised by machines.

Leaving the cavern, Milo, Ki, Gribble, and Two-Cat arrive at the Citadel just as Ki devises a plan to get in there without getting spotted by the guards. Ki then devises a plan to Milo, Gribble, and Two-Cat take out the guards, disable the surveillance cameras, sneak through the jail, and get to the silo. To avoid getting arrested by the guards, Ki manages to take out the guards to rescue Milo and Gribble while Gribble disables the surveillance cameras. Milo then devises a plan to Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat explaining that Milo should find his mother while the other three find the spaceship. Having rescued Wingnut (who is shown to have survived) from his prison cell, he joins Milo's group alongside the other male Martians who are also rescued.

Milo's gang then escapes the prison area and end up in the rocket ship area just as Milo finds a ladder reaching up to the surface just as Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat enter the rocket ship to rescue his mother before sunrise noticing that Milo doesn't have a lot of time before sunrise to rescue his mother. Milo and Gribble arrive at the spot where she is at just as Milo tries to rescue her from a dangerous fate while Ki activates the launch system. Milo manages to save his mother, disrupting the plan which causes the Supervisor's plan to fail.

Milo manages to rescue her by putting on an air helmet on her while the Supervisor arrives and prepares to terminate Milo who disrupted her plan to terminate his mother. Milo tells his mother to go home until Gribble finds another oxygen helmet for her just as he and Milo put the helmet on her, just as Milo's mother thanks her son for saving her. Milo apologizes to his mom for his earlier words and they reconcile. Attempting to escape, the Supervisor attempts to stop the gang from escaping. Ki manages to stop her from killing her friends, telling the SISS that the Supervisor betrayed all the Martians showing her the prophecy of a true Martian family on the mural in the translucent cavern area, causing her to be arrested for her tyranny and betrayal.

As Milo arrives back on Earth, he then rejoices with his friends he encountered on Mars just as Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat leave for Mars. Back at home, Milo is reunited with his father just as he takes out the trash using a galactic blaster, leaving out with a sheepish chuckle. During the credits, Milo watches NASA's discovery of Martians in Mars online via laptop.
