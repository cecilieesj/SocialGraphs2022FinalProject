==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
As [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]] arrives in [[Underland]], the Tweedle Boys, alongside the [[Mallymkun|Dormouse]], [[Nivins McTwisp]], and [[Uilleam|the Dodo]] approach her where they do not recognize Alice during her arrival at Underland, to which they take her to [[Absolem]]. After talking with Absolem, Tweedledee and Tweedledum stare upon the [[Oraculum]], to which Absolem tells the group to show the group Frabjous Day, to which when the Tweedles read, they explain that this is the time where Alice is to slay the [[Jabberwocky (2010)|Jabberwocky]]. Later while strolling across the garden, the [[Bandersnatch]], alongside the [[Armored Cards]] and [[the Jub Jub Bird]] chase after Alice's friends to which the Jub Jub Bird captures the Tweedles to take them to the [[Red Queen]]'s castle as the Tweedles are discussing which direction to take upon looking at a nearby sign.

Furthermore, the Tweedles work for the Red Queen and when Alice arrives, the two approach her to which Alice secretly tells them not to say what the Red Queen had done to both of them to which the Red Queen sends them to leave the throne. After talking with the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]], Alice encounters Tweedledee and Tweedledum in the corridor to which she asks them where the [[Nivins McTwisp|the White Rabbit]] is at to which Alice follows the Tweedles across the corridor in the Red Queen's castle and approach the Dormouse and the White Rabbit in a plan to rescue the Hatter. Later when the [[Chessur|Cheshire Cat]] rescues the Hatter from execution, the Hatter tells all the people working for the Red Queen that she has betrayed all the people working for her as slaves to which they all listen to what the Hatter says, causing the Tweedles alongside the other servants to celebrate their freedom, much to the Red Queen's fury as she releases the Jub Jub Bird to attack.

Later, the Tweedles arrives at the White Queen's castle to which the Tweedles look at a picture of Alice preparing to slay the Jabberwocky. The Tweedles later participate during battle against the Red Queen fighting against the Armored Cards to which the battle ends when Alice slays the Jabberwocky, causing the Armored Cards to arrest the Red Queen and the Knave of Hearts for her lies and betrayal. Later, the Tweedles see Alice preparing to leave Underland as a farewell.

===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===
The Tweedle Boys return in this film where Alice returns back to Underland during a conversation with the White Queen in Underland where it is explained that Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter, is in risk of dying. When Alice returns and reports the sad news about the Hatter, the Tweedles and the rest of Alice's friends react in worry and fear that they would lose their best friend if he dies. Alice is then tasked to travel back in time to find the Hatter's missing family and save his life before he dies to which Alice and her friends travel to Time's Castle to help save the Hatter who is in the risk of dying by using a Chronosphere to travel to the past Horunvendush Day event and save the Hatter's family from death before it is too late, just as Alice's friends wish her good luck in helping save the Hatter.

As the lapse in Underland becomes disastrous due to Alice taking the Chronosphere, Thackery and the rest of Alice's friends react in shock due to Alice taking the Chronosphere from the Grand Clock of All Time as the White Queen hopes Alice returns in time.

Past versions of the Tweedles appear amongst the crowd during the Toomalie Day event where they and the rest of the crowd felt worried about the failed coronation of Iracebeth. Toddler versions of the Tweedles appear in the past Fell Day event where they play around a snowman of one of the Tweedles as they become distracted upon seeing Chessur playing tag with Bayard just as the two break the spoon and umbrella used for arms on their snowman.

In the present, the Tweedles and the rest of Alice's friends are gathered near Tarrant lying in his bed gazing at the Hatter who is in the risk of dying just as they and the rest of Alice's friends mournfully leave as the Hatter's hair becomes completely white. Alice manages to save the Hatter from dying when she talks about his missing family still alive just as the Hatter happily wakes up.

After the Hatter is brought back to life and Alice makes a plan to find his missing family, the Tweedles and the rest of Alice's friends arrive at the Red Queen's castle to find the Hatter's family to make him feel happy. Upon arriving, they end up getting jailed by the Red Queen in a jail made of vegetables, much to the Red Queen's notorious plans. Ultimately, a vegetable woman frees them from the jail cell, freeing Alice and her friends in a plan to return to take Time back to his castle and retrieve the Chronosphere to save Underland before it perishes. The Tweedle Boys and the rest of Alice's friends end up getting engulfed by time rust along with everyone in Underland. With the Chronosphere back in place, the Tweedles are brought back to life along with everyone caught in time rust. Alice then leaves Underland just as the Tweedles watch Alice returning to the real world alongside the rest of Alice's friends.
