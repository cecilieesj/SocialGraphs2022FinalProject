'''Darius''' is a recurring character in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Darius is very posh and takes pride in his appearance. He hates getting dirty to the point where he would care more about someone getting him dirty than any actual crimes they may have committed. He is also rather rude, even towards his allies, as shown when he called Eberwolf "mutt" after they crawled over him.

He is highly critical of Abomatons and thinks [[Alador and Odalia Blight|Alador Blight]] is a hack, despite the latter being in his coven, a sentiment Alador returns in kind.

However, he also has a softer side. While he is prideful of his position, he is also one to appreciate those who make friends and don't dedicate their entire lives to their job, as he believed [[Hunter]] did. After realizing Hunter wasn't as he thought he was, he was willing to keep Flapjack a secret from the [[Emperor Belos]], as well as provide a scroll for the boy to allow him access to Penstagram. He was also willing to take unwilling recruits back home instead of to coven training after they were scouted.

===Physical appearance===
Darius is a tall, muscular man with dark brown skin, bright green eyes, and purple hair. He has an amorphous hair bun with an abomination's eye, and similarly amorphous sideburns and a goatee. Using abomination magic, Darius can change his form to become a large abomination with multiple eyes all over his body.

He wears a dark purple chest plate with a gold collar and pointed shoulders, light purple pants, white mid-length gloves, and white-heeled boots with purple toes. He also wears a pink side cape.

In "[[Hunting Palismen]]", he wore a white cape with the Abomination Coven sigil on the neck over his current outfit.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Magic:''' Like all witches, his connection to magic comes from a sac of magic bile attached to his heart. Having earned the rank of coven leader, he is undoubtedly very powerful.
**'''Abomination magic:''' As leader of the Abomination Coven, Darius is the most skilled when it comes to conjuring Abominations as well as using their goo to perform powerful magic, such as teleportation.
