}}'''Quinn''' is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. He is portrayed by guest star Ben Hollingsworth, and does not have a [[Storybrooke]] counterpart.

== History ==
Quinn is a member of [[Anita Lucas|Anita]]'s wolf pack. One night, he secretly follows [[Little Red Riding Hood|Red]] and [[Snow White]] through the forest when they are being chased by the Queen's men. While Red is at a stream, he runs and steals her red cloak. She chases and finds him about to burn her cloak. She begs him not to, and he reveals that he knows what she truly is and he can help her. He leads her underground to a secret room and introduces her to Anita, her mother.
Some time later, Snow White is captured and brought into the wolf den after wandering around the area looking for Red. Red convinces the pack Snow White is not dangerous and is her friend. She confesses to Snow White she is going to stay with her family, the rest of the wolves. As they are saying goodbye, [[The Evil Queen]]'s men burst into the den and try to force their way to Snow White. While the wolves are fighting them, Quinn is killed by an arrow to the heart. Anita blames Snow White for Quinn's sudden death, and attempts to kill her as well. In the midst of Red protecting Snow White, Anita becomes impaled and dies.
