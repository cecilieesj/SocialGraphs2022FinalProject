The '''Prairie Dog Trio''' are a group of background characters from the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]''. In every episode, they recap the current events, appearing during the plot twist, the climax and the ending through song.

==Trivia==
*Though they usually wear their farming type outfits, there are some occasions where this isn't the case. For example, in the episode "[[Here Comes the Sun (episode)|Here Comes the Sun]]", they wore night shirts, night caps and a nightgown during the night sequences. And they wear winter clothing during the episodes where it snows.
*Sometimes other characters on the show interact with them. In the episode "[[Bandit Toby]]", [[Kit Cactus]] swiped the banjo from one of them. In "[[The Ballad of Sweet Strings]]", [[Johnny Strum]] made off with their instruments after mesmerizing them with his voice.
*Since they usually appear to add musical commentary to each episode, they could be considered the "Greek chorus" of the show.
