'''Maria''' is a minor supporting character in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated series, ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.

==Background==

===Personality===
Maria always looks rather annoyed or put off by something, possibly because she has [[Thaddeus Bile|Thaddeus "Phlegm" Bile]] as her jokester she needs to assist. Based on the fact that she asked "What did you do this time?", it can be implied that she has had to put up with him for a while. Nevertheless, she takes her job very seriously.

===Physical appearance===
Maria is an average sized violet colored monster whose body is shaped like an upside down candy corn. She has skinny arms and legs and has purple toes and nails. She wears pink lipstick, has big round brown eyes with long stick-like lashes and has a tall fin on her head. Her eye lids have a faint blue eyeshadow on them.

==Trivia==
*Maria shares her voice actress, [[Alanna Ubach]], with the character [[Cutter]].
