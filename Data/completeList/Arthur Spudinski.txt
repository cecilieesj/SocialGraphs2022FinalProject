'''Arthur Patrick "Spud" Spudinski'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/characters/spud.htm</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0070641/?ref_=tt_cl_t2</ref> is one of the main characters of the [[Disney]] animated series ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
[[File:Spudinski1.jpg|thumb|250px|Spud as he appears in Season One.]][[File:Spudinski2.jpg|thumb|250px|Spud as he appears in Season Two.]]
Spud is the best friend of [[Jake Long|Jake]] and [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]]. He is extremely loyal, and will do anything to help them. Although seemingly slow-witted, he often comes up with intelligent things to say at random times, much like the [[Scarecrow (Wizard of Oz)|Scarecrow]] in ''The Wizard of Oz.'' He's actually a genius but tries to hide it<ref>[[A Befuddled Mind]]</ref> in order to live an easier and carefree life. Spud has a tremendous fear of clowns that started when he was five years old.<ref>[[Half Baked]]</ref> He also has an obsession with mermaids and dreams of becoming a "merman".<ref>[[Homecoming]]</ref>

===Abilities===
In Season 1, Spud doesn't appear to be particularly smart and often spends his time goofing around and making a fool of himself. It's only at the beginning of Season 2 that Spud shows a very comprehensive technological knowledge. He owns a laptop computer that sports surveillance capabilities and other advanced functions.

Spud used his computer to decode the encryption in the [[The Huntsclan|Huntsclan]] teleportation system, allowing his friends and him to intercept the teleportation of [[Huntsboys 88 and 89|Huntsboys Numbers 88 and 89]] (the same episode shows Spud's father as an uptight intellectual whom Spud resents, perhaps explaining his current "slacker" attitude).<ref>[[The Academy]]</ref> He once developed a global-positioning device to track his cheerleader crush, [[Stacey Wintergrin|Stacey]].<ref>[[Bring It On (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Bring it On]]</ref>

It is revealed that Spud is, in fact, a genius, and scored a perfect mark on a government-issued standardized test, which was a first for [[Millard Fillmore Middle School]]. Despite this, Spud generally prefers not to use his genius IQ, as he fears that upon the discovery of his intelligence, the ensuing pressure would not allow him to enjoy his life.<ref>[[A Befuddled Mind]]</ref>

Throughout the series, there have been several hints that Spud may possess a magical background. Spud mentioned that his great-grandfather used to be a magician, albeit apparently not a very good one. During the talent show in which he does a magician act in honor of his relative, Spud unknowingly uses a magical incantation thought to have been lost for centuries to seal a Djinn away; it is, in fact, the catch-phrase his 'super gramps' taught him when he was younger.<ref>[[The Talented Mr. Long]]</ref>

The Gorgon sisters remark about how Spud is the spitting image of the warrior Perseus, who originally sealed them away. However, this might be entirely due to the Spartacus costume for the Fighting Trojans mascot he was wearing at the time and does not necessarily mean he is related to the ancient hero.<ref>[[Bring It On (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Bring it On]]</ref>

Spud also mentions his family's tales of a mermaid city in the East River.<ref>[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]</ref>

It is interesting to note that Spud himself appears to have a relation with magic that may hint to a magical background. For example, he has displayed mastery with the use of two magical wands while battling Pandarus<ref>[[A Befuddled Mind]]</ref> without any instructions or training beforehand, though he had trouble remembering what the spells would do. Spud once maximized the smell of onion, using a powerful voice, to defeat one of the giant bugs in the principal's room that [[Sigmund Brock]] sent.<ref>[[The Rotwood Files]]</ref> He also gains magical frog-like powers in one episode,<ref>[[Shaggy Frog]]</ref> although he goes back to being human with no magical abilities at all in the end.

==Relationships==
===[[Jake Long]]===
Jake and Spud are like brothers. Both care about each other's well being, which is demonstrated multiple times. Spud wants to be a dragon-like Jake and is jealous of his dragon abilities and sometimes they argue, but not seriously. After all, everyone argues with their friends. But in the end, they both know they need each other to help protect the magical world.

===[[Trixie Carter]]===
Spud and Trixie are very good and firm friends. They know each other very well and are a solid team together. However, at this stage of their relationship, friendship is all they are. The mistaken prospect of their predicted marriage truly upset them,<ref>[[Body Guard Duty]]</ref> and they later reconfirmed there was nothing ''deeper'' to their mutual feelings toward each other.<ref>[[Homecoming]]</ref>

===[[Stacey Wintergrin]]===
[[File:Spud and Stacey.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Other than this, Spud later shows an obsession toward a cheerleader named [[Stacey Wintergrin]]. His fixation on her is so great that he even goes as far as to create a global positioning device to track her. He develops several plans and ploys in order to win her love but is constantly rejected by her no matter what he does to attract her attention.

However, Stacey finally develops feelings for Spud, though Spud thinks it's because of the deal he made with the Gorgon [[Fury Gorgon|Fury]].<ref>[[Furious Jealousy]]</ref> It is soon revealed that Spud did, in fact, win over her heart on his own and that magic had nothing to do with it. They seem to start dating at this point, though Stacey insists they cannot be seen together, or else her reputation would be ruined.

Spud later became Stacey's graduation partner.<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref> From this it is believed that they are most likely officially dating and that their relationship has become more public.
