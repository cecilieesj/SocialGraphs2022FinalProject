}}'''El Toro''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series.

==Background==
===Personality===
El Toro is known to be the bravest bull in all of Spain. Naturally, he also has a quick temper when he gets agitated.

===Physical Description===
El Toro has the typical appearance of a Spanish fighting bull: black skin, brown mouth, and two horns on his head. Earlier, he was very obese and bald.

==Role in the series==
==="[[The Pain in Spain]]"===
When [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] look at a billboard about El Toro, Timon tells his friend that he is three times as brave as he is. He dresses up like a matador and makes Pumbaa dress up like a bull, so that he can show Pumbaa what he would do if he were fighting against El Toro. While Pumbaa is running after poking himself on cacti, [[Quint|Carlos and Consuelo Quint]] mistake him for an actual bull and capture him so that he can replace El Toro. But, El Toro to leave without a fight, so he later returns and starts to fight Timon. When Timon and Pumbaa are at the stadium about to get attacked by El Toro, the two save themselves by putting the bull in a toilet.

==="[[The Running of the Bullies]]"===
In this episode, Timon and Pumbaa are once again in Spain and while they're on their vacation, Timon starts to agitate El Toro. When the running of the bulls begins, El Toro is not running with the other bulls because he is not done dealing with Timon. After the two argue, El Toro chases Timon all through Spain, with Pumbaa being unhappy about his vacation being ruined. The warthog later has enough with the fight between Timon and El Toro, who both somehow resolve their conflict and become friends. However, Pumbaa can't take it anymore, so he chases the two all the way to the gate where the three met earlier. Timon and El Toro later sit together at a beach, while Pumbaa is going berserk and then snarls viciously at the viewers.
