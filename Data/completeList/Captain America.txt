{{Quote|I can do this all day.|Steve Rogers|wikipedia:Captain America: The First Avenger}}

'''Captain America''' (real name '''Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers''') is a superhero from [[Marvel Comics]]. He made his debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in the [[2011]] film, ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', and is the eponymous protagonist of the ''Captain America'' films, and a featured character in the ''Avengers'' films.

Captain America is a super-soldier from World War II who was frozen in ice for 70 years and then resumed his heroic duties. An idealistic American hero, Captain America advocates for freedom and justice as the leader and one of the founding members of the superhero team known as the [[Avengers]]. After the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', Steve became a fugitive from the authorities, known as '''Nomad'''. However, five years after the Infinity War, Captain America rejoins the Avengers to undo the [[Thanos]]'s snap by traveling back in time to collect the [[Infinity Stones]]. They were successful in undoing the snap and managed to defeat an alternate version of Thanos and his armies. 

In the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Captain America travelled back in time to return all of the Infinity Stones to their proper places, but instead of returning to the present, Steve stayed in an alternative timeline in the past so he could live out the rest of his life with the woman he loves, [[Peggy Carter]]. He then returned to the present in the original timeline as an elderly man and named [[Sam Wilson]] his successor by giving him [[Captain America's Shield|his shield]].

Captain America was created by [[Jack Kirby]] and Joe Simon.

==Background==
===Personality===
Captain America is the purest of heart. He is defined by his strong courage, patriotism, and righteousness. He is even worthy to wield Mjölnir. Steve has always had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse no matter one's power and having compassion for the innocent. Despite being transformed into a perfect human by the Super Soldier Serum, he maintained his original spirit and character. Since his reawakening, Steve was saddened by losing so much from his time but still retains the same values he had since the 1940s. Due to his famed past exploits and his continued works to save the world, Rogers is generally respected by many; even if he doesn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds.

What separates Steve from the other Avengers is his humanity and morality. Steve is an extremely dedicated person. Despite being physically weak and small, and rejected many times due to his frail health, he still tried to enlist in the Army during World War II. Steve tried to be of service in whatever way he was allowed; even when his talents were wasted when he was ordered to inspire the American soldiers and support the American war effort by starring in U.S. propaganda. When he heard that the 107th battalion, including Bucky, was captured in a nearby HYDRA facility, Steve disobeyed his superior's orders and went behind enemy lines in a seeming suicide mission and rescued them. Steve finds the courage to defend the weak and innocent, not hesitating to stand up to corrupt bureaucrats or powerful beings like Loki. A true hero, Steve will even sacrifice himself to protect others.
Steve is not afraid to do what's right for the greater good and make the tough choices, even if it might be costly to him personally. As a soldier and an Avenger, Steve knows full well that war has its casualties and some of his dearest friends or even himself may need to make the ultimate sacrifice. Steve once had to tell Natasha Romanoff to close the Chitauri portal, despite Stark not being out yet. Steve was also willing to fight his best friend Bucky Barnes when the latter was preventing Steve from saving over three million innocent lives. Despite this, Steve will always prioritize civilian lives; for example, Steve would not abandon Novi Grad until all of its citizens were evacuated, even when Ultron was planning on smashing the city to the ground to create more damage to Earth.

As seen during World War II and the Chitauri Invasion, Steve has demonstrated impressive charisma and leadership skills. He is able to command respect from his fellow Avengers and the undying loyalty of his Howling Commandos. Steve's extraordinary ability to not only inspire the nobility in others but also assess combat situations and come up with effective strategies made his fellow Avengers recognize him as the leader of their team. During the Chitauri attack on New York, Steve focused on directing civilian authorities in order to keep the citizens safe and off the streets while the rest of the Avengers focused their efforts on taking out the Chitauri's military assets.

Even when outnumbered by the forces of HYDRA within S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was able to get Wilson, Hill, Romanoff, and even Fury, along with the loyal agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight back against HYDRA and stop Project Insight from being achieved. As a result, Steve dealt HYDRA their first devastating blow in decades, since he fought against them in World War II.

Steve's uncompromising sense of morality and selflessness sometimes puts him at odds with Tony Stark, who is more comfortable with a gray morality to protect people. This has led to several moments of bickering, arguments, and almost physical fights over the direction of the Avengers in how to protect people. However, despite their differences, they both respect each other, work well together, and have even formed a friendship.

Steve's sense of duty exceeds his personal feelings, however, his sense of loyalty is difficult to surpass. After realizing the Winter Soldier was his long thought to be dead best friend Bucky, he only fought him to disable HYDRA's Helicarriers. However, once the Helicarriers were destroyed, he immediately stopped fighting the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reason with him and help him remember their friendship.

Since being defrosted by S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was lost in a world he no longer knew. America had changed; though technology had greatly advanced, humane morals were constantly being compromised in favor of political expediency. To make matters worse, most of the people he loved from his past were gone or greatly aged. Even while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Steve still had no real life outside of being a soldier. Steve did not know how to belong and strives to uphold his code of honor in this new complicated world. Although he eventually met both Peggy and Bucky, Steve was still a "man out of time". However, after the battle against Ultron, Steve finally realized that he was no longer the man he was before he was frozen. Hence, Steve decided to focus his life on just helping people, taking a permanent role as the leader of the second incarnation of the Avengers.

===Powers and abilities===
====Powers====
*'''Artificially Enhanced Physiology:''' The [[Super Soldier Serum]] (SSS) metabolized and enhanced Steve's physical and mental attributes to the peak of human efficiency. He possesses enhanced intelligence, strength, speed, senses, durability, agility, stamina, dexterity and reflexes, as well as accelerated healing factor. As a result of the Super Soldier serum, he was transformed from a frail young man into a "perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning. The SSS is definite, meaning if he decided to live an unhealthy lifestyle, none of his enhanced abilities would weaken and maintains an overall healthy lifestyle including a regular exercise regimen and a balanced diet.
**'''Enhanced Strength:''' Steve's physical strength is enhanced to considerable superhuman levels. In Captain America: Civil War, he was able to exert his strength to stop a moving helicopter with one hand.
**'''Enhanced Speed:''' Steve's speed is enhanced to the levels that are greater than any Olympic class runners in the world. While jogging, he ran for 13 miles in 30 minutes as stated by Sam Wilson, resulting his warm-up speed at approximated 28&nbsp;mph (which is as fast as Usain Bolt's top speed). In Avengers: Infinity War, he was able to run at near equal speeds with Black Panther who can run as fast as a zebra while running towards the Outriders.
**'''Enhanced Stamina:''' Steve's body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-producing chemicals in his muscles, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity. He can exert himself at peak capacity for a hour without any rest and before showing any signs of fatigue.
**'''Enhanced Agility:''' Steve's agility is greater than that of an Olympic gold medalist. He can coordinate his body with balance, flexibility, and dexterity. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, he was able to leap from his apartment building to the next building at longer distance.
**'''Enhanced Reflexes:''' Steve's reflexes is beyond the limits of the Olympic-level athletes. He can dodge gunfire even in point blank range from multiple gunners at the same time.
**'''Enhanced Durability:''' Steve's bones and muscles are denser and harder than normal, to the highest human potential, which makes him very durable compared to a normal human. He withstand getting punched by Winter Soldier's bionic arm multiple times.
**'''Enhanced Healing Factor:''' Steve's healing speed and efficiency is at the highest limits of human potential, which means he can heal faster than any normal human. The white blood cells (WBCs) and the SSS in his body are efficient enough to fight off any microbe, foreign body, and others from his body keeping him healthy and immune to most if not all infections, diseases, and disorders, also Steve cannot become intoxicated by alcohol, drugs, or impurities in the air and is immune to terrestrial diseases. He is also highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus, due to this accelerated healing factor of his; Steve has extensively healthy perfect cells.
**'''Enhanced Intelligence:''' After been injected with the Super Soldier Serum, Steve's intelligence is enhanced. He can rapidly come up with the most effective strategies and tactics to defeat his enemies; this is one of the reasons why he is such a great tactician and leader.
***'''Enhanced Senses:''' Steve's senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are enhanced to the peak of human potential. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, he was able to track the sweat tipping from a man's face showing signs of danger.
***'''Enhanced Memory''': Steve's powers of memory are enhanced to an extraordinary degree. For instance, during his raid on the Red Skull's installation, Steve was able to completely memorize a detailed map of Hydra installations with only a few seconds study. Furthermore, he was then able to exactly reproduce it for his superiors.
**'''Enhanced Longevity:''' Since been injected with the Super Soldier Serum; Steve's aging has nearly completely stopped, due to rapid regeneration of extensively healthy perfect cells. ''Avengers: Endgame'' shows the limits of this longevity, as Steve returned to the original 2023, from living around 70 years in an alternate timeline since 1949, looking like a very old man.

====Abilities====
[[File:Cap-batroc.jpg|thumb|250px|Cap fighting Batroc.]]
*'''Master Hand-To-Hand Combatant/Martial Artist:''' Steve is highly experienced in hand-to-hand combat. He mastered several forms of unarmed combat disciplines and well versed in American boxing, kickboxing, Judo, Wushu, Jujitsu, and few other martial arts. While the majority of the instructors' curricula were simplified for training the Allied Forces, it is possible that they trained Steve in the more complex techniques because his body was already developed for them, his enhanced powers of memory allowed him to learn quickly, and because the majority of his combat knowledge (including his gymnastic-based techniques) was already established prior to his awakening by the Avengers. As a result, Steve is one of the best fighters in the world, rivaled only by his best friend, Winter Soldier and Black Panther.
*'''Master Shield Fighter:''' Steve's years of training and experience with his unique shield, as well as its physical properties, allow him to accomplish amazing feats with the item. Aside from bashing foes and blocking incoming attacks, he is able to throw it with nearly perfect aim. Steve can hit multiple targets with the same throw by means of ricochet, and could even achieve a boomerang-like return effect, allowing him to strike enemies from behind or retrieve the shield without objects to ricochet from.
*'''Master Tactician:''' Steve is an accomplished tactician. He had been widely considered one of, if not the greatest, tacticians on the planet, both on and off the battlefield. He is able to formulate battle strategies and his brilliant tactical sense allows him to alter any strategy to fit the changing need of the situation.
*'''Advanced Military Operator:''' Steve is well-versed in all Armed force disciplines including intelligence gathering, escape arts, assassination, demolition, survival tactics, hunting, swimming, mountaineering, march or drill skills, map making, map reading, and decoding cipher and other secret code messages, reading and making woodcraft signs and other secret code languages, disguising, interrogation, computers, explosives, communication systems, vehicles, and electronic appliances used in armed forces.
*'''Master Acrobat:''' Steve's years of training and experience have made him an expert acrobat, gymnast, and aerialist.
*'''Professional Sketch Artist:''' Steve has a great artistic skill that he developed from childhood.
*'''Expert Marksman:''' Steve can throw most projectile weaponry with great aim and is well-versed in the use of firearms, though he prefers not to use them.
*'''Weapons Proficiency:''' Steve does not typically utilize weapons other than his shield, but in desperate situations, he wields additional weapons to ensure victory. He is proficient in wielding swords, daggers, throwing knives, staffs, sticks, tonfa, axes, maces, clubs, and even firearms.
*'''Bilingual:''' Steve is capable of fluently speaking English and French. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, he communicate with George Batroc while speaking French.
*'''Expert Driver/Pilot:''' Steve is proficient in driving cars, motorcycles, trucks, jets, tankers, helicopters, motorboats, submarines, and some types of trains and utility vehicles.
*'''Stealth:''' Steve was able to sneak around the HYDRA base where Bucky was held and was able to sneak around the Helicarrier, regardless of the surveillance.

===Equipment===
*'''Captain America uniform:''' As Captain America, Steve wears a water and fire retardant costume, which is made of kevlar, nomex, and lightweight titanium. The suit also offers a medium level of resistance to electric shocks and force impacts i.e., falls from 30 meters height and cannot be pierced by normal conventional sharp edged materials like sharp wood, glass, iron, copper, and aluminum. The suit also gives some resistance to high temperatures. He carries a voice-operated, wireless communicator in his left ear, which has its frequencies blocked making it highly difficult to trace its call.
*'''Utility Belt:''' Steve wears a utility belt containing mission-specific equipment such as a first aid kit (containing tweezers, antiseptic gel-coated bandages, bone and muscle pain reliever spray cans, and antidotes for some toxins) and others.
*'''Avengers Identicard:''' Steve holds an Avengers Identicard that identifies him as a member of the Avengers and grants him the associated privileges.
[[File:Captain America Shield.png|right|170x170px]]
*'''[[Captain America's Shield]]:''' Rogers' primary weapon is his concave disk shield. The shield is about 2.5 feet in diameter, weighing 12 pounds painted in its familiar red-white-and-blue pattern with a five-pointed star design in its center, constructed by Howard Stark and made from Vibranium. The vibranium composition allows the shield to absorb and reflect kinetic energy from impacts, therefore, making it nigh-indestructible. Nearly every kind of human weaponry cannot even dent it, as bullets normally bounce off it. The shield is also strong enough to combat magic and mystical weapons, such as Thor's hammer Mjølnir. It also withstood Iron Man's repulsers, deflecting them in a coordinated team attack. The shield's shape makes it a superb throwing weapon. It can cut through the air with minimal wind resistance. It is also able to bounce off solid objects, such as walls and floors, when struck on its edge and can be ricocheted off of multiple surfaces. It also makes a formidable and devastating hand-held weapon. Combined with Rogers' strength and combat skills, it enables him to plow through virtually any opponent. The vibranium in the shield also enables Rogers to withstand great falls and devastating blows that he couldn't otherwise. At the end of the Avengers Civil War, Rogers surrendered the shield to Tony Stark acknowledging that Howard Stark had made it and he had proven unworthy of it. However, its durability was finally put to the limit when fighting Thanos; after repeated strikes from the titan's double-blade, combined with Thanos's immense strength, eventually broke it in half.

===Former Equipment===
*'''Wakandan Shields:''' In Avengers: Infinity War, Rogers was given two-handed shields in Wakanda, capable of collapsing to be smaller and used as gauntlets for punching. The shield's points are incredibly sharp, creating an offensive weapon, being able to pierce the skin of Outriders. He used them to go against Thanos himself, even managing to strike him three times in quick succession.

[[File:Captain-America-The-First-Avenger_(3).jpg|thumb|250px|Steve post-transformation.]]
In the 1940's, Steve Rogers is seen as a small and visibly frail young adult with many health problems who attends the funeral of his mother with his best friend [[Bucky Barnes]]. Bucky offers Steve to stay with him at his home. When Steve thanks him for this but declines, Bucky replies with "I'm with you until the end of the line".

Steve tries to enlist in the war but is turned down due to poor health. Despite the fact that it was illegal to lie on enlistment forms, he kept lying about where he was from on each of the five tries. Later on, when he watches a movie, there is an advertisement about helping out in the war, and a thuggish man in the movie theater is annoyed by the commercial. Steve tells him to show some respect, and this becomes his one-way ticket to being assaulted. He is dragged into the back alley behind the theater and is bullied, only for his friend Bucky to arrive and save him, then invites him to a double date. When asked where they are going, Bucky replies "to the future". 

Steve and Bucky attend [[Howard Stark]]'s expo with their dates and Bucky prepares to go off to war. However, Steve spends the whole date distracted and decides to enlist in the military again. Bucky sees it but does not stop him. Before Bucky goes away with the two ladies, Steve asks him to not win the war without him. This conversation is overheard by Dr. [[Abraham Erskine]], who goes in to see Steve. After talking with him, Dr. Erskine approves Steve and offers a chance to join the army by being a candidate for "Project Rebirth", which Steve accepts. 

Steve goes to train in Camp Lehigh, where he meets [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Peggy Carter]], who he instantly falls for. During his training, he is often being bullied by another stronger soldier. But despite being the weaker of the group, he is shown to be the one to think outside the box, as shown when the others are unable to climb up and get the flag, Steve simply dismantles the pole, and grabs the flag. He is also shown to be the bravest and the most selfless, for when the colonel throws a dummy grenade, Steve is willing to sacrifice himself to muffle the explosion. For these reasons, he is chosen to the Project Rebirth. 

Executing the experiment, Steve is then injected with Erskine's super soldier formula, and exposed to "vita-rays". The desired results are achieved, transforming him into a taller, muscular, peak-of-human-performance Steve Rogers. Unfortunately, a [[HYDRA]] spy is present during the demonstration and kills Dr. Erskine. Steve chases the spy, only to have him crunch a pill and die. However, despite his outstanding performance after the transformation, the Colonel does not allow him to join in on the war. Instead, Steve is sent to star in propaganda films to raise money for war bonds under the alias "Captain America".

After a few movies and tours, he is sent to pick up the spirits of soldiers in the field. The soldiers are a tough audience and request the singing girls. Steve then goes backstage and doodles on how he feels. Agent Carter shows up and explains that those soldiers are all that is left of the 107th. Steve remembers that Bucky is in the 107th, and wonders what happened to him. He finds out that Bucky was likely captured, and decides free him and the other prisoners. Agent Carter decides to help him get behind enemy lines with a plane. He successfully frees some of the prisoners and discovers that Bucky was taken somewhere else.

He later finds Bucky strapped to a table in a trance. The two friends reunite and Steve tells Bucky everything that happened. While escaping, he comes across the [[Red Skull]] and realizes he was the one who tried Erskine's formula first. However, Red Skull gets away. Meanwhile, back at the camp, the Colonel decides to deem Steve Rogers dead, but before he can sign the papers, the rescued prisoners march into camp. Bucky enthusiastically yells "Let's hear it for Captain America!" and everyone cheers. Steve is then finally accepted into the army, and he points out all the HYDRA bases on a map. The Colonel tells him that he is going to be the one to wipe them out. Captain America then recruits his crew, "The Howling Commandos", and he and Peggy arrange to go on a dance date after the war. Steve asks Howard Stark to make his uniform similar to his performance one. Howard also creates Captain America's signature [[Captain America's Shield|shield]], made out of [[vibranium]]. 

[[File:Steve-HYDRA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captain America captured by HYDRA.]]
Captain America, Bucky, and the Howling Commandos proceed to take out all of HYDRA bases. One day, they find out that Red Skull's lead scientist is going to be transported on a train, and they go on a mission to capture him. While Steve and Bucky await to ride the train, they reminisce about the time at Coney Island. However, due to an unfortunate series of events, Bucky falls off of the train and down the valley to his apparent death. The mission is, however, a success and they capture Dr. Zola. After an interrogation by the Colonel, they discover where Red Skull is. 

Captain America then infiltrates Red Skull's fort. However, Red Skull escapes into a plane and begins to take off. Peggy and Steve share a kiss before he leaves and manages to sneak onto the plane. While there he fights HYDRA enforcers and takes on the Skull himself. During the fight, Red Skull takes the Tessaract but it beams him off to somewhere else, leaving Steve to think he is dead. Captain America then takes control of the plane, however, he soon realizes there are bombs on board so contacts Howard and Peggy to tell them the situation.

[[File:Capsicle-Avengers.jpg|thumb|250px|Captain America encased in ice.]]
Captain America then takes the controls. He contacts Peggy and they have one last conversation. Peggy tries to get him a safe landing site and tries to reassure Steve he will be okay. But Steve tells her though that he's too close and that he's going too fast, so he has to crash-land into the water, choosing to sacrifice himself to stop the bombs from reaching America. Steve crashes into the ice while he and Peggy arrange a date for the dance. When the Valkyrie crash-lands into the ice, which buries and preserves him.

Seventy years later, in 2011, a Russian oil team finds the frozen ship and Captain America inside it. Steve is defrosted and wakes up in a simulated 1940's style room, an environment to try and ease him into what is happening. Whilst an agent tries to keep Steve calm, but he realizes something is off after hearing a game from the 1940's on the radio which is reporting "live", due to the fact that he had attended the game and demands to know where he is. Steve sees agents and breaks out of the building to find himself in modern day New York City. However, he is eventually stopped by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nick Fury]], who explains to Steve that they found in the ice and defrosted him, saying he was "asleep for almost seventy years." Startled, Steve looks around the city and when Fury asks if he will be okay, Steve replies "Yeah, it's just... I had a date."

{{Quote|I hope I'm the right man for the job.|Steve Rogers in ''The Avengers''}}
[[File:Fury-offer-Rogers_mission.jpg|thumb|250px|Fury gives Rogers a mission.]]
A week after being defrosted, Steve Rogers found himself lost in a world that has moved on without him and found it very difficult to adjust to this modern world. Nick Fury approached him with a mission to save the world. Fury informed him that the Asgardian mischief-god known as [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] had stolen the [[Tesseract]] and intended to use it to conquer and rule the Earth. Rogers wasn't thrilled to learn that HYDRA's secret weapon and power source had found its way into this era.

Rogers met with [[Agent Coulson]], a loyal Captain America fanboy, [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff]], and [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], the scientist who attempted to recreate the super-soldier serum but instead created the [[Hulk]]. Rogers was given a new uniform and sent to Stuttgart, Germany, where Loki had been sighted. Captain America arrived just in time to battle Loki, but found outmatched and had to be rescued by [[Anthony Stark|Iron Man/Tony Stark]], the son of Howard Stark. While traveling back to the Helicarrier, [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] emerged in an attempt to take Loki back to [[Asgard]], only to end up in a fight with Stark, which Rogers himself broke up. Rogers protected himself from a blow by Thor's mystical hammer [[Mjolnir]] with his unbreakable shield, ending the fight and forming a truce with the thunder-god.

Back at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, Stark and Rogers felt a potentially violent friction between the two of them and Rogers found himself taking up a leadership position. Rogers was angered by the discovery that S.H.I.E.L.D. had plans to use the energy of the Tesseract to build weapons as a deterrent against extraterrestrials. As [[Avengers|the Avengers]] became argumentative over how to confront the imprisoned Loki and the differences between them, the Helicarrier was attacked. Rogers helped Stark restart a failed engine.

The death of Agent Coulson during Loki's escape and the learning of the [[Avengers Initiative]] led Rogers and Stark to make the decision of ending the Avengers association with S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America led the Avengers against the [[Chitauri]] invasion of New York and arrested Loki, who had been hindered by the Hulk. Rogers and the other Avengers greeted Thor farewell as he took Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, and knew that the Avengers would form again when this level of a catastrophe was to occur again. Rogers rode off on his motorcycle to discover the modern world he was now a part of.

After the cataclysmic events in New York with The Avengers team, Steve is living a quiet life in Washington, D.C., struggling to adjust to his new life.

Cap is first seen running alongside Sam Wilson and adding The Troublemna soundtrack to the list of things he missed out on.

[[File:Cap TWS-3.png|thumb|250px|Cap about to start his mission on the Lemurian Star.]]
Cap, alongside Black Widow and a STRIKE unit, stop the hijacking of the Lemurian Star by [[Batroc]] and his terrorist unit. Cap gets appalled about Widow being more concerned about data recovery than the lives at stake. This causes Steve to later have an argument with Nick Fury about security versus freedom.

During his free time, Steve visits museums for remembrance about the old days and visits Peggy, who seems to have developed Alzheimer. He also befriends [[Sam Wilson]].

Nick Fury, after escaping an attempt on his life, goes to Steve's apartment to warn him about what he has found out, but he is killed by a sniper before he can tell anything. When Rogers talks about it with [[Alexander Pierce]], the latter reveals that seemingly Fury hired Batroc to steal and sell confidential info. After Cap leaves, Pierce orders him to be arrested as he seems to be holding on info about Fury's death.

Steve defeats the unit sent to capture him, led by [[Crossbones|Agent Rumlow]] and becomes a fugitive.

[[File:Rogers_Romanoff-TWS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cap and Widow on the run.]]
Steve gets Black Widow's help to investigate the truth under Fury's assassination. They find an old S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters where [[Arnim Zola]] is, now turned into a computer program. Zola reveals that the world is so chaotic now that people will give up their freedom in exchange for safety, which will allow [[HYDRA]] to take over. Then they are hit by a S.H.I.E.L.D. airstrike, but Cap saves Natasha and himself by opening a hatch and covering with his shield.

Steve and Natasha go to Sam's house to get a place to hide. After deducing that [[Agent Jasper Sitwell]] is also part of HYDRA, they interrogate him and he tells them Zola's algorithm is a program to choose the biggest threats to HYDRA as targets, like [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], or Cap himself, then the targets will be terminated by Helicarriers.

When Steve, Sam, and Natasha carry Sitwell in a car, the last one is killed by an assassin who then goes after Black Widow while Cap and Falcon face other HYDRA goons. The assassin shoots Widow in the shoulder, but Rogers fights him, and after unmasking him during the fight, finds out that he's his former friend [[Bucky Barnes]], with no memory of his past. Bucky escapes, and Rumlow arrives with a unit to arrest Cap and his allies.

Rogers and company are rescued by [[Maria Hill]] and brought to Nick Fury, who faked his death. Cap leads the way to reveal to every remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that S.H.I.E.L.D. is under HYDRA control, but Rumlow manages to launch the Helicarriers. Cap and Falcon manage to disable the Alpha and Bravo helicarriers, but they are intercepted by Barnes in the Charlie Helicarrier. Barnes breaks Falcon's flight harness and Sam must parachute away. On the deck, Cap fights Barnes with reluctance until he manages to disable the Charlie Helicarrier, despite being shot. As the Charlie Helicarrier was being destroyed, Cap managed to remind Barnes who he is before passing out into the water. Barnes brought him to shore, and Cap woke up in the hospital.

====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
After the destruction of Project Insight, the Avengers were officially reassembled with Iron Man's financing and Captain America's leadership. The Avengers arrived in Sokovia to take down the last known base of HYDRA and retrieve Loki's scepter. Captain America led the Avengers during the final battle against HYDRA, Rogers thanks to its super-strength was able to defeat several HYDRA soldiers. During the battle, Rogers was attacked by Pietro Maximoff; he was surprised because he had never seen anyone so fast. He also was attacked by Wanda Maximoff before capturing Baron Strucker. With the battle won, Rogers ordered [[Black Widow]] lull [[Hulk]]. When they returned to [[Avengers Tower]], Maria Hill informed him who were the two people who attacked him in Sokovia.

Days later, Rogers attended the party in honor of the victory over HYDRA. He talked to Sam Wilson about possible clues of the whereabouts of Bucky Barnes and also encouraged Bruce Banner to express his feelings to Romanoff. When the party ended, he was one of the Avengers who unsuccessfully tried to lift Thor's Mjolnir. Suddenly, an [[Ultron]] arrived and described the Avengers as killers and then proceeded to attack them by Iron Legion. Captain America destroy the last Legionary with Barton's help. The next day, the group met and discussed the events of the night before.

After learning the next destination of [[Ultron]], the Avengers went to Salvage Yard to try to stop him. When they arrived at Klaw's ship, Rogers advised Maximoff twin that they had time to leave Ultron, which Wanda sarcastically replied that they would. This encounter led to a fight between the two teams, the Avengers and Ultron's team. During the fight, Scarlet Witch used her powers in Captain America, who could see had been his life with Peggy if he had not been frozen for nearly seventy years. With the team beaten by the unsuccessful mission, [[Hawkeye]] took them to a place where they could relax and then out to fight. Upon arrival, he introduces his wife and children to his friends; Hawkeye explained that he asked Fury not to disclose this information to protect his family from possible threats. While the team was talking, Rogers noticed that Thor left the room and asked where he was going; the God of Thunder replied that he would seek answers to his vision. Days later, he was present when Nick Fury encouraged them to stand up and fight against [[Ultron]].

Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton went to Seoul, South Korea to steal the synthetic body from Ultron, while Stark and Banner waited in the tower in order to destroy Ultron's new body. Although Barton believed he was no match for Ultron, Captain America fought on equal terms to Ultron. When Ultron was preparing to kill him, he was saved by [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver]], Ultron who decided to leave after learning his real plans. After saving the civilians, Wanda asked him if he destroyed the synthetic body, which he replied that they sent it to Stark to destroy it. She then informed him that Stark sought to use the synthetic body to repair what he had done. When they arrived to Avengers Tower, they discovered that Banner and Stark began uploading J.A.R.V.I.S.' mind into the body. This incident led to a fight between [[Iron Man]] and Captain America. Suddenly, Thor arrived and used his Mjolnir to give life to synthetic Android. Rogers asked why he gave birth to the creature, which Thor replied that Stark had a reason since Android was the only one able to defeat Ultron. Minutes later, he witnessed how Vision was worthy to lift [[Mjolnir]].

Captain America went to Sokovia with his fellow Avengers, including the new members of the team: Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Vision. He fought fiercely against Sentries, while Iron Man and Thor looked for a way that the city doesn't hit against Earth. When Iron Man informed him that they should destroy the city to save Earth, Rogers told Stark would not leave anyone in the city. He was happy when Nick Fury came with the Helicarrier as they would be able to save civilians. Later, Rogers with his teammates protected the core from [[Ultron]] and his Sentries. He witnessed when Quicksilver used his body as a shield to protect Hawkeye and a Sokovian child. Having saved every civilian, he and the other Avengers escaped from the city to allow Thor and Iron Man destroy it before colliding against Earth.

After Ultron's defeat, Thor and Iron Man Avengers went to New Facility to bid him farewell as they leave the Avengers to return to Asgard and have a normal life respectively. He and Black Widow led the training of New Avengers which consisted of Vision, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and War Machine.

Steve joins Thor and Iron Man in their fight against Thanos. During the fight, Steve lifts [[Mjolnir]], proving his worthiness (which was suspected by Thor years ago).

After Thanos summons his army of Chitauri, Outriders, and the Black Order, Rogers is the only hero left standing before the resurrected heroes arrive to join him in the fight against Thanos. After Thanos and his army are wiped out by Iron Man, Steve watches Stark die from using the stones. He subsequently attends the funeral of his fallen friend.

After completing his mission, he retires from being a superhero and travels back in time to the 40s to live a peaceful life with Peggy Carter. He stays there at least until Peggy's death in 2016, creating an alternate timeline in the multiverse in the process. Rogers then returns to the mainstream timeline as an old man, in which he gives his shield to Sam in the present day, and dubs him the new Captain America.

==Relationships==
===[[Bucky Barnes|James "Bucky" Barnes/Winter Soldier]]===
Bucky is Steve's childhood best friend. He often came to Rogers' rescue when the latter got into fights when they were younger. They later served together in the United States military during World War ll. During the war, Bucky fell from a train and was presumed dead, only to come back as the Winter Soldier, and have to fight his best friend. After regaining his memories of Steve, they would later fight together in opposition to the Sokovia Accords. Steve protected Bucky and defended him from the anyone who wanted to imprison him or cause him harm and, in return, Bucky trusted Steve. 

Eventually, Steve takes Bucky to Wakanda to have the Winter Soldier program removed from his mind. Two years later, when they reunite again, they fight together against Thanos. Bucky ends up being one of those casualties when Thanos snaps his fingers to erase 50% of the life in universe, and Steve seems distraught upon watching his friend turning to ash. When everyone is brought back to live 5 years later, Bucky supports Steve when he decides to go back in time to live a life with longtime love [[Peggy Carter]], and also approves his decision to give Captain America's shield to Sam after he came back to the original timeline as an old man.

Steve supporting and believing in Bucky is shown to mean a lot to him and, 6 months following Steve's retirement, Bucky struggles without Steve being around him. When Sam gives Steve's shield to the museum and then [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]] is announced as the new Captain America, Bucky is really upset that his friend is being replaced by someone he did not choose. He later explains to Sam that he is worried that if Steve was wrong about Sam, it could mean that he was also wrong about believing in him.

===[[Iron Man|Tony Stark/Iron Man]]===
Tony is Steve's ally and friend. Despite their vast differences in personality, they clearly respect each other, eventually forming a close friendship, even though they argue quite a lot.

Their friendship is broken during the events of [[Captain America: Civil War]], where they both have opposing views of the Sokovia Accords, a set of laws that would have the Avengers overseen by the United Nations. Steve and half of the Avengers refuse to sign the Accords, while Tony and the other half sign due to the collateral damage they caused in Sokovia. The Accords are signed at a United Nations meeting which is bombed, and security footage indicates that the culprit is Bucky. Tony is ordered by Secretary Ross to arrest Steve and his team, but fails after a long fight in an airport in Berlin. When Tony learns that Bucky was framed for the bombing, he strikes a truce with Steve and Bucky and meets them in an old HYDRA base to look for answers. Baron Zemo, the real culprit of the bombing, plays back footage that reveals that Bucky was the one who killed Tony’s parents while brainwashed. Steve reveals that he knew this, enraging Tony to the point that he tries to kill them both. He succeeds in ripping off Bucky’s metal arm before Steve disables his Iron Man armor. Tony hatefully tells Steve that he does not deserve his shield, as it was made by Tony’s father. Steve responds by leaving the shield with Tony before departing with Bucky. 

Steve sends a letter of apology for everything that happened, telling Stark that if he ever needs his help, he'll be there, showing Steve's regret of their fight. Tony, while still upset with Steve, forgives him enough to ignore Ross’s demand to help stop Steve from breaking his friends out of the Raft.

When Thanos’s army invades Earth in search of the Infinity Stones, Tony hesitates (and ultimately declines) to call Steve for help. When Tony returns to Earth at the beginning of ''Avengers: Endgame'', he blames Steve for Thanos’s victory because the Avengers were scattered. 

Five years later, when Tony and Steve are given the opportunity to reverse the Snap, they finally set aside their differences, with Tony returning the shield to Steve as a gesture of goodwill. They, along with Thor, personally confront Thanos together when he attacks the Avengers Compound in a final bid to steal back the Infinity Stones. Steve is immensely sad when Tony sacrifices his life to destroy Thanos’s army and attends his funeral.

===[[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow]]===
Natasha is Steve's close friend and teammate, becoming friends on their job as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Natasha even tries to set Steve up on dates at one point. Despite siding with Tony Stark over the Sokovia Accords, Natasha allows Steve and Bucky Barnes to escape upon seeing the destruction the battle between the Avengers causes. As a result, she becomes a fugitive like them, eventually assisting in breaking their teammates out of the Raft.

===[[Sam Wilson]]===
Sam becomes Steve's friend while they run together, and later recruited as an Avenger. Sam is loyal to Steve, helping Rogers with anything he needs. Steve trusts Sam enough to eventually pass the Captain America shield to him after retiring.

===[[Peggy Carter]]===
Peggy was Steve's superior in the military and eventually became his love interest. Peggy showed great amounts of faith in Steve over the course of World War ll and even kissed near the end. When Steve is forced to crash-land into the ice and presumed dead, Peggy is devastated. Upon awakening, Steve is both happy and saddened when he visits Peggy in her old age, and expresses regret at not having the chance to be with her. She eventually dies of old age and Steve is crushed at her death. He attends her funeral, crying while he helps carry her casket down to the altar.

After the events with Thanos, he decides to retire from superhero work, so when he travels back in time to return the Infinity Stones, he stays in the 40s to live a peaceful life alongside Peggy, and they finally are seen dancing together.

==Trivia==
*In ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', Steve Rogers wears a variation of the Commander Rogers costume from the comics that Steve wore during his time as a secret black-ops agent in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before returning to his traditional uniform.
*According to the guidebooks of Marvel Cinematic Universe, MCU Captain America/Steve Rogers is based on the comics version of [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Steven_Rogers_(Earth-616) his 616 mainstream counterpart].
*In ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', Steve Rogers wore a classic costume similar to what he wore in his first appearance in 1941.
*Captain America is the first superhero in-universe to have his own comic featured in his movie. In this case, it was ''Captain America #1'', his very first appearance in comics. The comic book's cover is iconic for its [[Jack Kirby]]-drawn image of the titular hero punching Adolf Hitler in the jaw.
**This scene would be referenced in the movie ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' as Steve would go on tours across the US to do a play encouraging citizens to buy War Bonds only to have an actor playing Hitler try to sneak up behind him and would get "punched" by Steve. When he goes to rescue soldiers from the Hydra Base and they question if he knows what he's doing, he jokingly mentions to the soldiers that he's "knocked out Hitler over 200 times".
**The comic also appears briefly in ''Iron Man 2'' inside Howard Stark's archives.
***The real comic book was made nine months before the tragic events of Pearl Harbor and the USA joining in the fight with the Allied Nations in WWII.
*Captain America's [[Captain America's Shield|shield]] can be seen in both ''Iron Man'' and ''Iron Man 2'' on Tony Stark's workbench.
*The comic book version of Captain America's shield is most commonly said to be a mixture of Vibranium and Adamantium. Vibranium = the shield's ability to absorb vibrations; Adamantium = the shield's (near) invincibility. However, because Adamantium is part of the X-Men/Wolverine mythos, which film rights are owned by Twentieth Century Fox, the Adamantium part had to be left out of this version.
*In ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', which is set in 2014, Steve is revealed to be 95 years old.
*Before Chris Evans was cast as Captain America, Sam Worthington and [[Will Smith]] were in early talks for the role of Captain America. Later on, [[Garrett Hedlund]], [[Channing Tatum]], [[Scott Porter]], Mike Vogel, [[Sebastian Stan]], Wilson Bethel, [[John Krasinski]], Michael Cassidy, Chace Crawford, and Jensen Ackles were on the final shortlist for the role. Kellan Lutz, [[Ryan Phillippe]], and Alexander Skarsgård carried out auditions in case Evans wasn't going to do the role. Sebastian Stan would later be cast as Bucky Barnes in the film and Alexander Skarsgård's father, Stellan Skarsgård, was previously in the film, ''Thor'' as Erik Selvig.
*As of 2020, Captain America has appeared in the most Marvel Cinematic Universe Films, with a count of eleven. A possible exception is [[Stan Lee]], however, it is possible he is playing different characters in each of his appearances.
*He hates swearing, though he swears in some movies. Notably in ''Avengers: Endgame'', after the Snap, the situation has made him forgo this ethic.
*''[[w:c:marvelcinematicuniverse:Captain America: The First Avenger|Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' was the final Paramount Pictures film produced with Marvel Studios before Disney acquired the rights to the MCU.
*Steve's infamous quote "On your left" is said twice in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' - when he is running aside Sam Wilson/Falcon and when Steve is in hospital. The quote would then come back in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', when [[Sam Wilson|Sam/Falcon]] would say it to Steve as him and all the dusted Avengers come through the portals to the final battle against [[Thanos]].
*Wyatt Russell auditioned to play Steve Rogers until Chris Evans was cast. Russell went on to portray [[U.S. Agent|John Walker/U.S. Agent]] in ''[[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]]'', who was the new Captain America for a short time.
