==Appearances==
===''[[Three Orphan Kittens]] ''===
In the first film, they were locked into a bag and abandoned in the middle of winter. They enter a nearby house through an open basement window, and get up to mischief. The nurse catches them, and as she is about to toss them out in the cold, a little girl (who lives in the house) stops her and adopts the three kittens. In spring, they still get up to mischief, this time in the garden.

===''[[More Kittens]]''===
In the second film, the three kittens once again get into trouble, tormented by a turtle and a bluebird. This time, they find a friend and protector in Toliver the St. Bernard.

==Trivia==
*They possess traits similar to other cats in Disney films.
**They are like [[Duchess]], [[Marie]], [[Berlioz]], and [[Toulouse]] because they were abandoned without scruple.
**[[Dinah]], because, like her, they are ordinary cats.
**[[Si and Am]], because they cause trouble in a house which is not theirs (however, they do it because they are curious, while the Siamese are vicious).
**[[Oliver]], because they entered a house which is not theirs to be adopted by a little girl.
