{{Quote|'Til the Pride Lands end, Lion Guard defend!|The Lion Guard's catchphrase}}

The '''Lion Guard''' are a team of animals whose duty is to protect the [[Pride Lands]] and the Circle of Life. The Lion Guard was led by [[Kion]] and his friends until they decided to return to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] and join the [[Night Pride]]. The Lion Guard is currently led by [[Vitani]] and her Guard. Their meeting place is the [[Lair of the Lion Guard]].

==Background==
The Lion Guard is a group tasked with the job of defending the Pride Lands from danger, and is traditionally led by the second born child of the Lion King. The leader is bestowed with the [[Roar of the Elders]], which helps them in battle.

The first Lion Guard were led by a lion named [[Askari]], the second born son of one of the previous Lion Kings, Askari and his Lion Guard were also responsible for forging peace between lions and elephants in the Pride Lands.

Each member of the Lion Guard has a title, depending on their personalities, physical or mystical attributes; the leader is always the fiercest while the other members are the bravest, fastest, strongest, and keenest of sight. All members are bestowed a marking upon their shoulder in the shape of a lion's head. Prior to Kion's Lion Guard, previous Lion Guards consisted of only lions.

[[Scar|Askari II]] led the Lion Guard before Kion, initially, he was responsible with his duties as the leader of the Lion Guard and never abused the Roar of the Elders, but after Askari got bitten by a [[Strange Cobra|cobra]], the venom in his body started to corrupt him to the point that he allowed the power of the roar to go to his head, causing him to become irresponsible with his duties and abusive of his powers. He then decided to overthrow his older brother, [[Mufasa]], and take his place as the ruler of the Pride Lands. He wanted his Lion Guard to help him, but they refused. In rage, Askari murdered them with the roar, but by using the power for evil, he lost it completely.

Many years later, Kion, the second born child of [[Simba]] and [[Nala]] and Scar's great-nephew, inherits the power of the Roar of the Elders and he becomes the new leader of the new Lion Guard. Kion recruits his friends, [[Bunga]] (the Bravest), [[Ono]] (the Keenest of sight), [[Beshte]] (the Strongest), and [[Fuli]] (the Fastest), to be part of the new Lion Guard despite the fact they are not lions.

After being informed by [[Kiara]], Simba confronts his son for his decision, (incorrectly) believing that he wasn't taking his new responsibility seriously. However, after Kion and his friends defeat [[Janja]] and save [[Kiara]] from a stampede, Simba realizes he was wrong about Kion's decision and warmly welcomes the new Lion Guard.

Years later, Kion recruits [[Anga]] into his Lion Guard to become Keenest of Sight, after Ono begins to lose his eyesight and becomes the Smartest. Following the battle of [[Pride Rock]], Kion and his friends leave the Pride Lands and journey to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] to heal Kion's scar and Ono's sight. In their absence, [[Vitani]] and four other [[Outsiders|Outsider]] Lionesses formed a new Lion Guard to protect the Pride Lands, following the events of ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]''. When Kion and his friends return, they challenge Vitani and her Lion Guard to determine which group is better. It was up to Kion and Vitani to break up the tie, but Kion decides that Vitani and her group are worthy of becoming the new Lion Guard, and bestows Vitani with the [[Mark of the Guard]] and the Roar while Kion, and his friends decide to join the Night Pride and become protectors of the Tree of Life.
