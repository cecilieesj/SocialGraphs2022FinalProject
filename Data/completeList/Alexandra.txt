'''Alexandra''' is a character that appears in ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.

==Role in the [[Once Upon a Time|series]]==
==="[[The Price of Gold]]"===
Because of the curse, [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] gains a new life as Ashley, who falsely remembers her boyfriend, [[Prince Charming|Sean]], spurning her on his [[The King (Cinderella)|father]]'s orders. With few options, she signs adoption papers for her child to [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]]. For 28 years, Ashley remains pregnant until [[Emma Swan]] arrives in [[Storybrooke]], to which the curse begins to weaken and time starts to move forward. Emma, drawing from her own experience of having a child at a young age, convinces Ashley to seize control of her own future. Deciding to keep her child, Ashley steals the adoption papers and attempts to drive to [[Boston]]. On the way there, she has contractions, and later gives birth at the hospital. To prevent Mr. Gold from taking away Ashley's child, Emma agrees to owe him a future favor. Regretting his past actions, Sean reconciles with Ashley at the hospital, where he gifts their daughter a pair of shoes.

==="[[Skin Deep]]"===
One morning, Ashley bring Alexandra to the diner. As she talks to Emma and [[Snow White|Mary Margaret]] about how uneasy it is to be a mom, Granny holds Alexandra for her. Later that night, Sean proposes to Ashley, who happily agrees to marry him.
