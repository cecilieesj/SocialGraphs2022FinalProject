==Background==
===Physical appearance===
She has dark blue hair, appears to be African and has brown eyes, and wears a light green shirt, green scarf, and purple pants.

==Trivia==
*Chloe is one of the first openly lesbian characters in a Disney series and the first named female Disney character to be in a same-sex relationship.
*While Chloe and her voice actress [[Jessica Paré]] are both French, Chloe is clearly dark skinned, possibly of some African descent, while Paré is white. This was before all animated television shows took a stance on casting more ethnic appropriate actors in roles.
