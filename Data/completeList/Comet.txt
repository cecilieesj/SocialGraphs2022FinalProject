He is seen in all three of the ''[[The Santa Clause|Santa Clause]]'' films, serving as Santa's personal transport to and from the [[North Pole]] whenever he isn't delivering presents in the sleigh. 

In the first film, while he is shown to understand human speech, he only communicates in grunts and snorts. This changes in the second and third films, where he instead speaks in human-like gibberish that only Santa is able to understand. In both, he is voiced by [[Bob Bergen]].

== Appearances ==
===''[[The Santa Clause]]''===
Comet is first seen on [[Scott Calvin]]'s roof after the previous [[Santa Claus|Santa]] fell. Initially, he and Scott did not get along, as he growls and passes gas at him during their first meeting. By the next Christmas, Comet has come to like Scott and has even made a rope for him to use to save himself in case he falls off a roof.

=== ''[[The Santa Clause 2]] '' ===
Comet flies Scott down to [[Chicago]] to visit [[Charlie Calvin|Charlie]] after he starts having problems at school. While visiting with his mother, [[Laura Miller|Laura]] and stepfather, [[Neil Miller|Neil]], Comet stays in the backyard. When Scott is hanging some Christmas lights on the house, Comet tells him they are not straight. He is delighted when [[Lucy Miller|Lucy]] comes to see him and feeds him chocolate, which he is not allowed to have, as Santa mentions he tends to overeat. He gives Scott a look after he lies to Lucy about being Santa.

Later on, as Scott is trying to return to the [[North Pole]] because of the [[Toy Santa]] taking over the workshop, he goes out to the backyard to retrieve Comet, only to find that he has eaten too many sweets and become too bloated to move. When Scott asks him if he ate all the chocolate, he attempts to blame it on a squirrel. Scott tries moving him with no success, and Comet can't get up to fly himself and take Scott and [[Curtis (Santa Clause)|Curtis]] back to the [[North Pole]]. This necessitates they to find an alternate method of return from the Tooth Fairy. Comet stays in the backyard until Christmas Eve when Scott comes to retrieve him after defeating the Toy Santa. As he is still unfit to fly the sleigh, Chet takes his place during the toy delivery, and he rests on the back of the sleigh throughout the journey.

=== ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'' ===
Comet appears briefly in the film as he and Chet take Scott to see his family, and are chastised for their farting. He is later seen taking Scott back to the North Pole with [[Carol Newman-Calvin]]'s parents, [[Bud and Sylvia Newman]], Lucy, Neil, Charlie, and Laura.

== Trivia ==
*Comet was portrayed by a radio-controlled animatronic for all up-close scenes, and occasionally by a real reindeer in wide shots. He was computer-animated in most of the flying sequences. 
*Comet has a notoriously bad flatulence habit, which crops up in all three films; first when Scott meets him on the roof in ''[[The Santa Clause]]'', then several times in ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'' after stuffing himself with chocolate, and again in ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'' as he brings Scott down to his family home.
*Comet likes [[Charlie Calvin|Charlie]] and vice versa.
