'''Dr. Elliot Coleye''' is the main antagonist and the head of SETI in Disney's ''[[My Favorite Martian]]''.
==Role in the film==
At the end of the film, Coleye attempts to shoot [[Martin (My Favorite Martian)|Martin]] with his gun, but a SETI official named Armitan, actually Martin's old friend, [[Neenert]], in disguise, saves him by destroying Coleye's gun and tossing him wildly in the air. Eventually, he tries to stop Martin and Neenert from taking off, but it was too late because they fly back to [[Mars]].

Eventually, Coleye consumes the piece of nerplex left by Neenert and he is turned into an alien too. While laughing at this, he accidentally swallows it, which presumably leaves him permanently in his transformation (at least for seven years if the myth about gum is to be believed). He then ends up getting caught by his own organization and gets tranquillized off screen.

== Trivia ==
* His name is a pun on the bacteria E. coli, or [[wikipedia:Escherichia coli|Escherichia coli]], a notorious bacteria that causes severe illness in the lower intestines.
