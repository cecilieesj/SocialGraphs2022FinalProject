She is the future daughter of [[Hulk]] and [[Betty Ross]], and also has a twin brother named [[Thad Ross]], to which they call themselves the Gamma Twins.

==Personality==
Betts is kind of hotheaded just like her brother and grandfather, she likes doing things on her own and she hates it when somebody messes her up on a mission.

==Powers and Abilities==
She possesses superhuman physical abilities as a result of inheriting gamma irradiated DNA. She has considerable muscle and bone mass which grants high levels of superhuman strength. Since she is probably Red Hulk's granddaughter she can probably heat up like him.

== Trivia ==
* While Betts has never appeared in any Marvel comics, she's likely an homage to Betty Ross' Red She-Hulk identity.
