He is a pink flamingo who is separated from the [[Snooty Flamingos|other flamingos]] due to his love of yo-yos.

==Personality==
Unlike the rest of the flamingos, Yo-Yo is free-spirited and just wants to have fun.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia 2000]]''===
As the short starts with the flamingos waking up and walking across the water, Yo Yo was left behind playing with his yo-yo. The other flamingos find him and stop his playing and make him practice alongside them. Yo Yo (upset) joins in the practice; although he was practicing with them he managed to play with his yo-yo too hence his name. The snooty flamingos catch him and a chase began until he sees them spinning on a branch where he spins his toy to copy the flamingos until they chase him again.

Trying to escape, Yo Yo managed to get them stuck in a log so that he can continue using his toy. While they were stuck, Yo Yo plays with his toy while the other flamingos rise from the water and push him underwater as they throw his yo-yo into a tall tree. Soon as the other flamingos feel satisfied that they got rid of his toy and the flamingo not acting like them. Yo Yo then rises from the water and ties the other flamingos up with yo-yo strings, which is revealed that he has hundreds of yo-yos. He then prevails as the segment ends.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Yo Yo Flamingo made several cameo appearances in the animated series ''House of Mouse''. Yo Yo's most notable appearance is in "[[Not So Goofy]]", where Goofy slips around the club passing Yo Yo, making him tie himself up. He also made an appearance in "[[The Three Caballeros (House of Mouse)|The Three Caballeros]]", sitting next to [[Clara Cluck]].

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
