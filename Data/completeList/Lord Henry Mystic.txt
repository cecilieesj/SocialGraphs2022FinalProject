==Background==
A member of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]], Henry Mystic was a very well-travelled globetrotter. While on an expedition in Papua New Guinea, he came across a young monkey trapped in the web of a giant spider. After rescuing him, he adopted the monkey as his pet, naming him Albert after a beloved uncle. Ever since, the two have travelled together and discovered many artifacts and treasures around the world. Mystic would also build a new home and adventure base in the New Guinea jungle, which he would call [[Mystic Point]]. His house, known as Mystic Manor, would open its doors to the public as a museum in 1896.

To help manage his 7000 artifact collection, he has also enlisted the help of his grandnephew James among others. In 1909, Mystic and Albert acquired a mysterious enchanted music box while traveling in Bali said to bring inanimate objects to life when opened. Though he did not see what had occurred, Albert's opening of the music box nearly threw his collection in disarray, though the chaos that ensued was undone upon the box being closed.

==Other Appearances==

===Printed materials===

====[[Tales from the Haunted Mansion]]====
Henry Mystic is briefly mentioned in the third ''Tales from the Haunted Mansion'' book as a collecting rival of Colonel Tusk. Tusk justifies his exploitation of [[The Mummy|the mummy]] and his tomb by saying that if he didn't do it, a rival such as Lord Henry Mystic would.

==Trivia==
*Henry Mystic and Albert were originally to be depicted in a more realistic fashion, keeping with [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s [[Tower of Terror (Tokyo DisneySea)| Tower of Terror]]. However, in an effort to make the attraction more appealing to families, the two characters were rendered in more of an animated style.
*Despite being portrayed as a benevolent adventurer in contrast to vilified characters, such as Harrison Hightower III, Barnabas T. Bullion, and Prof. Garrett Reed, Mystic is often explicitly identified as having commit the same actions of colonialism, colonial theft, and grave-robbing as the two; often in the same manner. This includes having grave-robbed in Egypt, desecrated mummy remains, privately owning a museum of looted and pillaged cultural artifacts, and his having colonized Papua New Guinea to create Mystic Point.
**This amorality is potentially referenced in ''Tales from the Haunted Mansion'' where Colonel Tusk references Lord Henry Mystic as a grave-robber who exploits the dead.
