==Appearances==
===''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''===
Jewel was one of the original [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]] in the [[1996]] movie, and the second to be referred to by name. Her name comes from how the spots around her neck resemble a jeweled necklace. She and her siblings were kidnapped by [[Jasper and Horace]] for [[Cruella De Vil]] and brought to [[Hell Hall|De Vil Manor]] to be made into a fur coat. With the help of her family, she escapes Cruella along with her siblings.
