'''Organization XIII''' (XIII機関 ''Jūsan Kikan''; lit. "XIII Order") is a group of thirteen powerful [[Nobodies]] who seek to reclaim their hearts and become whole again. They are the antagonists of ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', and all are playable in the game ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', which happens after [[Roxas]]'s birth.

==Background==
[[File:AnsemApprentices.png|250px|thumb|The six founders of Organization XIII<br>From left to right: Ienzo, Even, Terra-Xehanort, Braig, Aeleus, and Dilan]]
Organization XIII was formed by a group of scientists working under [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Ansem the Wise|Ansem the Wise]]. The head of this group was Ansem's apprentice, [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Terra-Xehanort|Terra-Xehanort]] (under the pseudonym Xehanort at the time), with the others being [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Xigbar/Braig|Braig]], [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Xaldin/Dilan|Dilan]], [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Vexen/Even|Even]], [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Lexaeus/Aeleus|Aeleus]], and [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Zexion/Ienzo|Ienzo]]. Ansem the Wise began initiating tests about the human [[heart]] with the hopes of recovering Xehanort's lost memories. At the urging of Ienzo, he constructed a massive laboratory under the castle. However, Ansem the Wise soon ceased his experiments, for he feared that going too deep would have grave repercussions.

However, the six apprentices continued the experiments on countless subjects, discovering the [[Heartless]] as a result. Eventually, the six apprentices surrendered to the darkness, creating a Heartless and Nobody for each apprentice. The six Nobodies then banished Ansem to a [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Realm of Nothingness|Realm of Nothingness]], and went on to form Organization XIII, with other members joining in the future.

The Organization yearns to discover the secrets of the heart and fill the empty void inside themselves by gathering hearts to form [[Kingdom Hearts]] so they can become full beings again. However, the real objective, known only to Xehanort's Nobody, Xemnas, is to use the members as vessels to become 13 replicas of the real [[Xehanort]]. Each member is aware of their lack of emotions, and many of them pretend to have emotions, for example, Saïx's enraged battle style and Larxene's giggling and winking. Despite this, most of the members begin demonstrating true emotions as time goes on while some members are remarkably disloyal to Xemnas and much of their stories revolve around key betrayals or attempted coups. This made many of the members unfit for becoming Xehanort clones.

===Uniform===
[[File:Kingdom Hearts - Organization XIII Cloak.png|116px|right|thumb|The Black Coat]]
Each member in the Organization dons the same uniform, regardless of whether they are male or female. The uniform consists of a [[Black coat|single black leather hooded coat]]. It is plainly adorned with a silver zipper and seemingly pointless silver beaded pull strings for the hood that form a semi-circle in the middle. Each member wears their zippers at differing points.

Not much is known about the undergarments of the Organization. It is known, however, that they all wear [[wikipedia:hakama|hakama]]-esque black pants and knee-high silver trimmed boots, with the exceptions of Roxas, who wears sneakers of the same color, and Larxene and Xion, who wear a more feminized version of the boots with heels. In addition to this, they all wear black leather gloves of some unknown length, as they disappear under bell-shaped sleeves. Some members have different looking coats, for example, Axel, whose sleeves are tight around his wrists. Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the hems of each cloak are each slightly different, as well as the shoulder pads (such as those of Demyx and Xigbar, which seem to be slightly pointed).

The reason that Organization XIII wears black cloaks is that Xehanort once wore one. As Xemnas regained his memories, he remembered the black cloak that was worn by Master Xehanort and incorporated the cloak into Organization XIII.

===Rank===
Ranks within the Organization have little to nothing to do with power. While Xehanort's Nobody, known as Xemnas, is the strongest as well as the leader, the rest are assigned by order of seniority. Thus, their numbered rank is based on the order they joined and not necessarily representative of their status and power. Until ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'' the total number of members, like its name suggests, was thirteen.

===Name===
[[File:KH358-2 Roxas' name.png|thumb|250px|Roxas undergoes the naming ceremony.]]

All of the members have an "X" that appears within each of their names. As revealed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], the director of the game, by removing the "X", the remaining letters form an anagram of the members' original names from when they were humans. For instance, "Roxas" is an anagram of "Sora", and "Xemnas" is an anagram of "Ansem". Xemnas's true name is Xehanort; his name is an anagram of 'no heart' or 'another' with an X added. Xion, being an artificial Replica, had no original name. The name "Xion" came from her label as Replica No.i of the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Replica Project|Replica Project]].

The reason for the placement of the "X" in the naming process of a new Organization XIII member has to do with Master Xehanort's fascination with the legendary [[X-blade]]. As Xemnas regained memories of Master Xehanort's past, he remembered the χ-blade and incorporated the "X" into Organization XIII.


===Members===
There were initially thirteen members (fourteen with the inclusion of Xion), but by the time of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', the actions of Sora, Axel, Riku, and the Riku Replica, in addition to the departure of Roxas, reduced the Organization's roster to eight, which were then slain by Sora one-by-one (with the exception of Axel) until only Xemnas remained. Ultimately, Xemnas fell at the hands of Sora and Riku.

<tabber>
Xemnas=
{{Main|Xemnas}}
|-|Xigbar=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Xigbar/Braig|Xigbar]]''' is the Nobody of Braig and Rank II within the Organization. Xigbar went down defending the Organization's headquarters from Sora, [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], disappearing into Darkness after his defeat. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', though he was "destroyed", Xigbar is now revived (alongside Xemnas, Saïx, and the heartless [[Ansem]]) to serve as a member of the new Organization. Later, it is revealed that Xigbar's real identity is [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Luxu|Luxu]], one of the apprentices of the [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Master of Masters|Master of Masters]].
|-|Xaldin=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Xaldin/Dilan|Xaldin]]''' is the Nobody of Dilan and Rank III within the Organization. He was on a mission to turn the [[Beast]] into a Heartless and gain control of his powerful Nobody. By the combined efforts of Sora, Beast, and their friends, Xaldin was defeated and he disappeared into darkness and wind. With Xaldin destroyed, Dilan was revived.
|-|Vexen=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Vexen/Even|Vexen]]''' is the Nobody of Even and Rank IV within the Organization. Vexen opposed Marluxia's plot to overthrow the Organization and Marluxia wanted him eliminated. Vexen was then incinerated by Axel as a way to gain Marluxia's trust, allowing Even to be revived.
|-|Lexaeus=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Lexaeus/Aeleus|Lexaeus]]''' is the Nobody of Aeleus and Rank V within the Organization. Lexaeus met his end while trying to make [[Riku]] use the Darkness inside him and disappeared into Darkness, reviving Aeleus from him.
|-|Zexion=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Zexion/Ienzo|Zexion]]''' is the Nobody of Ienzo and is Rank VI within the Organization. Zexion was stationed at [[Castle Oblivion]] during an attempted coup by Marluxia. Axel wanted no evidence of his actions in Castle Oblivion, so when Zexion was extremely weary from his battle with the real [[Riku]], Axel had the [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Riku Replica|Riku Replica]] absorb Zexion. He disappeared into gaseous Darkness while engulfed in the Replica's energy. After Zexion was destroyed, Ienzo was revived.
|-|Saïx=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Saïx/Isa|Saïx]]''' is the Nobody of Isa and is Rank VII within the Organization. Saïx was defeated by Sora, [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], but is eventually revived to serve in the new Organization alongside two other original Organization members, Xigbar and Xemnas. After Saïx being defeated again, Isa was revived.
|-|Axel=
'''[[Lea|Axel]]''' is the Nobody of [[Lea]] and is Rank VIII within the Organization. Axel was eliminated in a sacrificial attack to save Sora from an army of [[Nobodies|Dusks]]. Similar to a fire, he seemed to "burn out" into Darkness, resembling ashes. Lea was revived soon after and retained his memories of Axel.
|-|Demyx=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Demyx|Demyx]]''' is Rank IX within the Organization. Demyx was a participant in the Battle of 1000 Heartless. He confronted Sora and company just for the sake of battling in the war. He disappeared into Darkness and appeared to have boiled up and evaporated, but later was revived by the real Organization.
|-|Luxord=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Luxord|Luxord]]''' is Rank X within the Organization. He captured Donald, Goofy, Riku, and Kairi, forcing Sora into one of Luxord's "games." Sora was able to beat him by "winning the game" and slashing through his shield of cards. He disappeared into gaseous Darkness. Later he was revived as a member of the real Organization. After being defeated by Sora again, his Nobody vanished and he became his complete self again.
|-|Marluxia=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Marluxia/Lauriam|Marluxia]]''' is the Nobody of Lauriam and is Rank XI within the Organization. Marluxia staged a coup within the Organization using Sora as his catalyst. However, when that failed, he sought to destroy the boy instead. He eventually merges with his Nobody underling to defeat Sora, but the expense depletes him of energy and he is beaten. He disappeared attempting to grab Sora in gaseous Darkness in a flurry of flower petals. He was later revived as a member of the real Organization, but then was defeated by Sora again. Just before disappearing again, he genuinely smiles to Sora and thanks him as he seems to have recovered the memories of his former self. When his Nobody was destroyed, he became Lauriam again.
|-|Larxene=
'''[[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Larxene/Elrena|Larxene]]''' is the Nobody of Elrena and is Rank XII within the Organization. Defeated by Sora, [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]]. She was part of the coup with Marluxia. Larxene set off on a mission to kill Sora after her plan fell apart. She would have succeeded, but an attempt to save Sora by [[Naminé]], Donald, and Goofy gave him the strength to fight back, and Larxene eventually met her end. She later was revived as a member of the real Organization, but then was defeated by Sora again. Just before vanishing, Larxene tells Sora her real reason to help the Organization and she implies that everything she did was just to be with Marluxia. When her Nobody was destroyed, she became Elrena again.

====Real Organization XIII====
The {{nihongo|'''real Organization XIII'''|真のXIII機関|Shin no Jūsan Kikan}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''thirteen seekers of darkness'''|13人の闇の探求者|Jūsannin no Yami no Tankyūsha}} is a group consisting of thirteen different incarnations of [[Xehanort]] that debuts in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''. It was created by Xehanort in case the first Organization had ever failed in its true purpose - to have each of the Nobody members host a fragment of Master Xehanort's heart, turning them into clones of Xehanort. Because of the original's failure from the members' treason and independence, Master Xehanort had arranged for Young Xehanort to be sent by [[Ansem, Seeker of Darkness]] to travel to different periods of time and gather different individuals to become part of the new Organization. For the members and incarnations to coexist in the present, Xehanort had revived the replica project to provide blank vessels for the hearts of the past, and inevitably, as the hosts for his own heart. Twelve of the Organization's seats were successfully filled and Master Xehanort was revived. When the group tries to make Sora its thirteenth member, however, the boy is rescued by Riku and his friends, forcing the group to retreat to their proper times. Eventually [[Xion]] was chosen to serve the spot as their thirteenth member.

The thirteen members of the real Organization XIII are:
*'''I. Master Xehanort'''
*'''II. Ansem, Seeker of Darkness'''
*'''III. Xemnas'''
*'''IV. Xigbar'''
*'''V. Luxord'''
*'''VI. Larxene'''
*'''VII. Marluxia'''
*'''VIII. Saïx'''
*'''IX. Terra-Xehanort'''
*'''X. Dark Riku'''
*'''XI. Vanitas'''
*'''XII. Young Xehanort'''
*'''XIII. Xion''' (defected)

In addition, two former members, '''Vexen''' and '''Demyx''', were brought back as reserve members of the organization. However, their roles were limited to the outside of Xehanort's primary objective: Vexen was brought back to continue the Replica project and Demyx as a last-minute alternative. The two have since deserted the organization and joined/re-joined the residents of Radiant Garden. Vexen was once again restored as Even. What happened to Demyx is currently unknown.

==Appearances==
===''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]''===
The Organization makes their first appearance in the series (apart from Xemnas' appearance in ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix''). The neophytes - [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Marluxia/Lauriam|Marluxia]] and [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Larxene/Elrena|Larxene]] - tried to take control of the Organization by using [[Sora]] as their puppet, while the senior members - Zexion, Lexaeus, and Vexen, tried to oppose them by using the darkness in Riku. However, all of them, save Axel, were eliminated.
===''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''===
Only eight members (Xemnas, Axel, Demyx, Xaldin, Xigbar, Luxord, Saïx, and Roxas) of the Organization remained at the beginning of ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Sora and his friends took every single remaining member down so that Sora and his friends could save Kairi. In the end, Organization XIII is ultimately destroyed when Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]''===
The story largely focuses on Roxas's time as a member of the Organization XIII, and thus, all the members are present here. This and ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' are the only installments to date where the fourteenth member, Xion, is ever mentioned.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]''===
While Dilan, Even, Aeleus, Ienzo, Isa, and Lea appear in the game in minor roles, Braig serves as a major player in Xehanort's ruthless ambitions, acquiring his signature scars and eyepatch following a battle against Terra. Of Ansem's apprentices, Braig plays the largest role overall in the story until the appearance of Xehanort. Axel, Roxas, and Xion also appear in the game's secret ending.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''===
[[File:True Organization XIII.png|right|250px|thumb|The six known members of the True Organization XIII]]
Following the Organization's defeat, Dilan, Even, Aeleus, Ienzo, and Lea are revived, though the other members' original selves are not shown. However, the threat of Organization XIII turns out to be far from over, as Sora learns through his confrontations with [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Young Xehanort|Young Xehanort]], Xemnas, and Xigbar that the true purpose of Organization XIII was to create an Organization of thirteen different incarnations of Xehanort himself, though this plan initially failed due to the members' unforeseen independence. Under the leadership of the newly reformed Master Xehanort, the new Organization XIII is formed by Master Xehanort himself, Young Xehanort, Xemnas, Xigbar (who claims to already be "half-Xehanort"), Ansem, Saïx, and six other hooded figures. Master Xehanort almost succeeds in making Sora into the final vessel for the Organization, but Riku, Mickey, Lea, Donald, and Goofy succeed in saving Sora and driving Master Xehanort to retreat. In the game's secret ending, [[Yen Sid]] implies that Master Xehanort has successfully formed his new Organization XIII.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''===
[[File:Thirteen Seekers and Two Reserve Members of Darkness.png|thumb|The Thirteen Seekers and Two Reserves of Darkness.|250px]]
The Real Organization XIII reappears in the game as the main antagonists. The other six members were revealed to be Marluxia, Larxene, Luxord, Dark Riku, Vanitas and Terra-Xehanort, in addition Vexen and Demyx were brought back to serve as reserve members. Saix recruits Vexen back in order to continue the replica program in order to give the time traveling members replica bodies for Young Xehanort to put his and others hearts in in order to remain anchored in the present, one of them was used to reconstruct Xion as their  thirteenth member in place of Sora. Secretly however, Saix and Vexen would use this ploy to plot for their atonement as Vexen has become a reserve member he recruits the other reserve member Demyx to assist in this plot to deliver a replica body to Ienzo to reconstruct Roxas's heart. 
 
Through their travels through various worlds, Sora Donald and Goofy confront various members of Organization; Marluxia and Larxene are tasked with overwatching the Seven New Hearts, should the Seven Guardians of Light fail complete their ranks, Young Xehanort and Dark Riku were encountered to conduct various heart related experiments in order to recreate Xion as their final member. Meanwhile Luxord and Xigbar attempt to find the black box located in the worlds. During a meeting with Marluxia, Larxene, Demyx and Luxord, Xemnas appears to them and reveals they were brought back as members  due to their past as keyblade wielders from the age of fairy tales despite Marluxia and Larxene's treason back in Castle Oblivion during the time of the original organization and Demyx's laziness in regard to the Organization's goals.

Once the Guardians of Light and the Thirteen Seekers of Darkness have assembled their ranks, the two groups confront each other in the Keyblade Graveyard. One by one the members of the thirteen seekers of darkness would fall; Luxord hands Sora a wild card that could turn the tables, Marluxia thanks Sora for helping reclaim his identity of his former self, Larxene reveals she wasn't too keen on becoming a vessel for Xehanort and tells Sora she was only along for the ride with someone who she does not disclose too, Xigbar reveals he only joined Xehanort so he claim his keyblade and cryptically disappears in order to fulfill his true goal, Dark Riku's heart is destroyed by the Riku Replica where it was revealed the former wasn't the real Riku when he was possessed by Ansem but the past self of the Replica who leaves his replica body behind. Vanitas is destroyed when he accepts his fate as Ventus's darkness and Terra manages to reclaim his body back from Xehanort, Xion defects when Saix jogs her memories and Roxas reappears to help fight Xemnas and Saix, Xemnas then abducts Kairi, Saix is then defeated who revealed his jealousy of Roxas and Xion to Lea before reconciling with him and disappearing, Sora, Riku and Mickey would then confront Xemnas, Ansem and Young Xehanort and defeat them; Ansem recognizes Riku's strength over darkness and encourages him and Sora to move on, Xemnas reveals that he took the original Organization XIII for granted, Young Xehanort merely mocks and laughs at Sora about his fate misusing the power of waking to save everyone but it cut off mid-sentence as he fades away leaving only Master Xehanort remaining. 

Once the other twelve have been defeated a key that served as a physical representation of a dark piece of the shattered χ-blade. Master Xehanort brings out Kairi and shatters her provoking Sora, Riku and Mickey into attacking him thus creating the thirteenth key and used it to open Kingdom Hearts, however with some quick thinking the guardians managed to trap Xehanort in time containing him in Scala ad Caelum. After battling the replica Xehanorts recreated from the defeated members, Xehanort eventually retreats to the roof of the cathedral on top of the town however despite using the power of Kingdom Hearts he is ultimately defeated for the last time. Once the other guardians arrive, the heart of his old friend Eraquas emerges from Terra, convincing him to surrender the keyblade to Sora, Xehanort concedes and hands it over to him, Xehanort begins to die afterwards but is caught by Eraqus and the two ascend to Kingdom Hearts in the afterlife, with that the Real Organization XIII is officially dissolved. 
==Trivia==
*Xemnas and Roxas are the only members shown wearing something other than the Organization's signature Black Cloak: in Xemnas's case, he had [[Keyblade|a suit of armor]] and a modified black-and-white cloak; in Roxas's case, he wore a casual outfit.
*Roxas and Xemnas are the only Organization members whose weapons are not designed after the Nobody sigil.
*At least eight of the Organization members were citizens of Radiant Garden, and Sora released his heart, creating Roxas, within the Hollow Bastion.
*Five of the Organization members (Xigbar, Luxord, Demyx, Marluxia and Larxene) were from the age of fairy tales, during the period of the Keyblade War.
*The second Organization initially did not have Vexen, Demyx and Xion in their ranks; only after their forced retreat did Saix decide upon adding Xion and having Vexen refine the replicas for the hearts of those from the past. Secretly he planned on having Vexen and Demyx work against Master Xehanort.
