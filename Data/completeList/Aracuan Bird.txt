The '''Aracuan Bird''' (pronounced ''AIR-uh-kwan'') is a wacky [[South America]]n bird of an undetermined species who appears in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated feature films ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' and ''[[Melody Time]]''.

==Background==
The Aracuan Bird is an odd species of tropical bird (even described in the film Donald was watching that first revealed it to him as "one of the most eccentric birds ever seen") that got its personalized first name from a song that it sings. It has the power to do the impossible (this includes, but is not limited to, simple cartoon antics like reaching out of a film reel image to shake someone's hand). It is aforesaid to exist seen everywhere, most notably South America.

===Voice===

Today [[Frank Welker]] provides his wacky, high-pitched, speedy voice, but without the use of the distinctive 'Aracuan bird song'.

In ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'', [[Dee Bradley Baker]] provides the bird's wacky, high-pitched, speedy voice, even using the distinctive "Aracuan bird song", hence marking the first time the song is used again in 70 years.

The Aracuan does not speak, but only gives out vocal effects, except for in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' when he speaks while disguised as someone, but never as himself or in his natural voice.

===Physical appearance===
