}}'''Bradley Nicholson''' is a character in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'' that holds a strong grudge against [[Milo Murphy]].

He is a student at Jefferson County Middle School and is in the same class as [[Milo Murphy]], [[Melissa Chase]] and [[Zack Underwood]]. He acts as Milo's rival and is jealous of the attention he gets whenever something disastrous happens to him, due to Milo being jinxed.

== Personality ==
Bradley often has his doubts when it comes to Milo, and the trail of destruction he leaves behind. He constantly attempts to persuade Melissa into staying away from Milo.

In ''[[The Undergrounders]]'' he is jealous of Milo and the attention he gets. He also appears to have a slight crush on Melissa, though he attempts to play it cool.

''[[We're Going to the Zoo]]'' reveals that he has a somewhat malicious streak, as shown when he deliberately teased a giraffe by offering it carrots and then withholding them.

== Physical Appearance ==
Bradley is fair-skinned. He has jet black hair with the longer part on one side and wears glasses.

He wears a gray and white plaid shirt with two pockets, dark gray pants and gray sneakers. He also owns a burgundy colored bookbag.

When they arrive in class, Bradley believes that he will win the bet as the bell is about to ring and Milo and Zack are nowhere to be seen.

==Trivia==
*Bradley is voiced by [[Vincent Martella]], who previously voiced [[Phineas Flynn]] in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. Coincidentally, both ''Phineas and Ferb'' and ''Milo Murphy's Law'' take place in the same universe.
**Ironically, Bradley is the opposite of Phineas - while Phineas is an optimist, Bradley is more of a pessimist.
*In a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ak4i9HZ27o promo] on ''Disney XD Africa''<nowiki/>'s ''YouTube'' channel, it states that Bradley feels he is the perfect soulmate for Melissa.
*Despite his cold attitude toward Milo, he was seen dancing to him and his band in ''School Dance''.
*Much like [[Elliot Decker]], his antagonistic relationship with Milo is one-sided on his part.
*In early concepts, Bradley would have served as the total antithesis of Milo. While Milo was unlucky, but happy all the time, Bradley was going to be incredibly lucky, but miserable about it.
