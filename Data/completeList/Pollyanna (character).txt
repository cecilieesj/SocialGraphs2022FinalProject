==Biography==
Pollyanna was born to two missionaries. When she was 12, her parents passed away and she went to live with her [[Polly Harrington|Aunt Polly]] in Harrington, where her optimistic views change several of the townsfolk's lives for the better.

She was forbidden from attending a local festival, so she snuck out when she tries to re-enter her room by climbing the tree outside the window she falls, causing her to become paralyzed from the legs down. She and Aunt Polly leave Harrington with [[Dr. Edmond Chilton]] for an operation in Baltimore, which will correct her injury.
