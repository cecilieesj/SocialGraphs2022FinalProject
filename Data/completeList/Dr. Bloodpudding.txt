==History==
He was first seen entering [[Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated]] with the [[Giant Floating Baby Head]] to see [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] when his foot was broken, meaning he probably cares about him, at least enough to see if he was okay ("[[The Bully Code]]").

Later that summer he attended the press meeting of [[L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.]], and doubted any press would show up, which turned out to be the case. He was also slightly disapproving of the group's being called L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. He and the rest of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. went to a local dance competition, where all the press were. However, he was soon kicked off the show for his bad dancing and crushed by falling debris from [[Perry the Platypus]] ("[[Nerdy Dancin']]"). He made 2 other appearances one in Season 3 and one in Season 2 episodes "[[Robot Rodeo]]" and "[[Bullseye!]]" He in [[Robot Rodeo]] competing in it when the agents are freed they fight him and other members and destroy the inators. In [[Bullseye!]] he was in the opening song and voting for the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N Leader. He reappears in [[Phineas and Ferb Save Summer]].
