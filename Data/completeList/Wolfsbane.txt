'''Wolfsbane''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'', played by Maisie Williams. She is a Scottish [[Mutants|mutant]] with the ability to transform into a werewolf.

Wolfsbane was created by Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod.

==Background==
Rahne Sinclair grew up in [[Scotland]] where she lived in a religiously strict village. She would have moments of running through the woods as if she were a feral beast. Later, she would discover that she is a Mutant and had the power to transform into a wolf, essentially meaning she had lycanthropy. Rahne would tell a priest, Reverend Craig, about these excursions and he would claim that the Devil had possessed her and brutally punish her; eventually branding a 'W' on her back and accuse her of being a witch. Rahne fled her village until she was found by Dr. [[Cecilia Reyes]] and placed in her care at an abandoned hospital.

Rahne would travel through the air vents to beat her boredom and spy on the various happenings. She would even escape out into the courtyard to enjoy the weather that could be viewed from Dr. Reyes' force field. Eventually, Rahne found a friend in [[Mirage (Marvel)|Danielle Moonstar]] and proceeded to show her around the facility and share her discoveries with her. These excursions resulted in the two of them falling in love and becoming a couple to escape the dreary reality of their prison.

Rahne soon found herself protecting Dani from Dr. Reyes when she tried to kill her to please her superiors at Essex Corporation. Reyes was killed by the entity known as Demon Bear and Rahne jumped into action defending her loved one alongside her fellow Mutants. After Dani defeated Demon Bear, Rahne was free to pursue Dani and leave the hospital with her new friends.

=== Abilities ===
* '''Lycanthropy''': Rahne's main power is the ability to transform into a wolf; essentially making her a werewolf. She can become a full wolf or retain her human appearance and adopt wolf features such as sharp teeth and claws.
* '''Enhanced agility''': Rahne has displayed some slightly above average agility, even when not transformed. She was able to climb freely through air vents while her friends had difficulty.

== Trivia ==
* In the comics, Wolfsbane's sexuality was, for the most part, heterosexual. She entered a relationship with an [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] named Hrimhari and even had his children. While she was close with Danielle Moonstar, the two were nothing more than friends.
**Wolfsbane and Danielle are the fourth and fifth LGBT characters in the X-Men Cinematic Universe, the first three being [[Deadpool]], Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio.
* Wolfsbane's creator, Bob McLeod, was unhappy that the character did not possess spiky red hair like in the comics, though he did like Maisie Williams' performance.
