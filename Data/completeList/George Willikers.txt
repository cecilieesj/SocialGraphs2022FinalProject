'''George Willikers''' is a character from [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]. Originally a minor off-screen character in the 2013 queue updates for the Magic Kingdom version, he was turned into the main antagonist of [[Disney Kingdoms: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]].
==Background==
G. Willikers was the task-master and foreman of the [[Big Thunder Mining Company]] during the 1880s.  He was a considerably apathetic and selfish man who would do just about everything in the name of greed and keeping those around him below his status.

== Appearances ==

=== Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ===
Through scattered details found in the headquarters of the Big Thunder Mining Company that serves as the queue for the Magic Kingdom's version of the attraction, G. Willikers is established as the foreman of the mining operations. With this rank comes much better pay then the other workers and in telegrams and memos, it can be seen that he is a strict taskmaster.

== Other Appearances ==

=== Disney Kingdoms ===
In the Disney Kingdoms book, Willikers has been keeping his boss [[Barnabas T. Bullion]] in the dark of just how bad safety conditions have gotten, with his main priorities being getting as much gold out of the [[Big Thunder Mountain|mountain]] as possible, no matter how many workers' lives it costs.
