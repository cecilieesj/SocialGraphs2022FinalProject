'''Ajak''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character, who  appears in ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'', played by [[Salma Hayek]].

Ajak was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Background==
Ajak is in charge of supervising the Eternals. She’s the leader of the team, and it is her responsibility to make sure that their mision accomplished and that they don't misbehave. As the wise and spiritual leader of the group, Ajak holds a crucial power and task that the other Eternals don’t; she controls the information, as she is the only one with the ability to talk to Arishem the Judge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/who-are-the-eternals-according-to-salma-hayek|title=Who Are the Eternals According to Salma Hayek|website=Marvel|date=[[October 11]], [[2021]]}}</ref>

===Personality===
Ajak was beloved by her fellow Eternals for her leadership, spirituality, and maternal instincts. She cared for her fellow Eternals and did not use her powers to aid humans, believing it to be dangerous to interfere with their affairs.

Though in the beginning she was loyal to the Celestials and their mission to destroy planets to cause the births of new Celestials, Ajak grew to love and cherish humans after her team's disbandment. When the Avengers successfully resurrected the universe's population after it was wiped out by [[Thanos]], Ajak's affection for humans reached its apex and seeing humans' capacity for good caused her to break her centuries long loyalty to the Celestials and save mankind from the Emergence, all while knowing that rebelling against the Celestials would mean death.

==Trivia==
*Ajak is amongst the characters, in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], to be depicted as female, whilst originally having a male [[Marvel Comics|comic]] counterpart.
**Other characters include; [[Jeri Hogarth]], the [[Ancient One]], [[Ghost]], [[Mar-Vell]], [[Morgan Stark]], [[Makkari]], [[Gabriella Rosetti]] and [[Karli Morgenthau]].
