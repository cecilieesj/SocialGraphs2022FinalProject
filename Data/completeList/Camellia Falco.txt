'''Camellia Falco''' is the host character for the [[Soarin' (attraction)|Soaring: Fantastic Flight]] attraction at [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s [[Mediterranean Harbor]] area.

==Background==
Born in 1801, Camellia Falco was the daughter of Cellino and Giuliana Falco, founders of the Museum of Fantastic Flight, which she inherited in 1850, and she would be the first woman inducted into the Society of Explorers and Adventurers in 1851. She would participate in S.E.A.'s tradition of displaying expedition paddles at the Tropical Hideaway, with hers coming from an 1831 trip down the Zambezi River.

Avidly interested in advancing human flight, she was a hot air balloon traveler and would also develop the Dream Flyer, a glider inspired by the designs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Dying in 1875, her spirit would linger in the halls of the Museum of Fantastic Flight and during a special retrospective of her life held in 1901, her spirit would invite visitors to take a flight of fancy aboard the Dream Flyers.

== Appearances ==

=== Soaring: Fantastic Flight ===
Camellia's ghost appears in the queue for this attraction, arranging guests to ride on her Dream Flyers.  Portraits and other references to her can be found throughout the queue as-well.

=== [[The Tropical Hideaway]] ===
She was first referenced on one of the S.E.A. member paddles featured at [[Disneyland]]'s Tropical Hideaway.  This paddle commemorating her 1831 river-journey on the Zambezi River.

== Trivia ==

*Camellia assumes the role of [[Patrick (Soarin')|Patrick]] from the original Soarin' attractions.
*Camellia is similar to the character of [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] as they are both women who were members of the society and more focused on technological innovation and sciences than they were colonial theft or colonization.
