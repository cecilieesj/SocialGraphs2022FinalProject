'''Bill the Lizard''' is a minor character who first appeared in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1951]] animated feature film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''.

A variant of the character later appeared as one of [[Ratigan|Professor Ratigan]]'s thugs in Disney's [[1986]] animated feature film, ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''===
Bill is first seen walking with a ladder. He was eventually asked by the [[Dodo]] and the [[White Rabbit]] to get rid of the monster inside the White Rabbit's house. It was actually [[Alice]] who had grown large because of a cookie that she ate, and Bill refuses at first. When Bill is forced down the chimney by the Dodo, the smoke causes Alice to sneeze sending him blasting off into the sky. What became of him afterward is unknown, as he is not seen again for the rest of the film.

===''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''===
Bill appears as one of [[Ratigan|Professor Ratigan]]'s henchmen. He is first seen with the rest of the thugs and singing about Ratigan in the song "[[The World's Greatest Criminal Mind]]". He then watches sadly as his friend Bartholomew gets fed to Ratigan's cat [[Felicia]] for calling Ratigan a rat. When [[Basil of Baker Street|Basil]] and his assistant [[David Q. Dawson|Dr. Dawson]] show up at Ratigan's lair, Bill along with the other thugs laugh at Basil and tie him and Dawson up. When the thugs tie up the real Mouse Queen and use the robotic queen to fool the crowd, Bill gives notes to [[Mr. Flaversham|Flaversham]] on what to say into the speaker of the robot mouse. When Basil, Dawson, and [[Olivia Flaversham|Olivia]] show up at the palace, they tie up Bill and the other thugs and the Queen has them arrested.

===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===

===Other appearances===
At the beginning of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', when [[Eddie Valiant]] looks outside the window before [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] appears, Bill can be spotted helping someone out with a ladder.

The AJAX lizard delivery man in the [[Mickey Mouse Works|''Mickey Mouse Works'']] cartoon "[[Mickey's Airplane Kit]]" resembles Bill.

In ''[[House of Mouse]]'', Bill can be spotted with the [[Dodo]] during the opening theme.

==Trivia==
*Bill also appears as one of [[Ratigan|Professor Ratigan]]'s henchmen in ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''. He is never called Bill in the movie, but his appearance and clothes (and Cockney accent) are identical to that of Bill in ''Alice in Wonderland''. The only difference in his appearance is that he does not wear his black coat in ''The Great Mouse Detective'', whereas in ''Alice in Wonderland'', he does.
*There is a character in the [[ABC]] show ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]'' called "Lizard", which is a reference to Bill.
