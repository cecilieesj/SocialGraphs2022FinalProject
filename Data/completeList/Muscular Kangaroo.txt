The '''Muscular Kangaroo''' is a character of the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode, "[[Outback at Ya!]]".

==Background==
As the kangaroo's name implies, it is an anthropomorphic muscular kangaroo containing a joey in its pouch. Within the kangaroo's pouch is an anthropomorphic joey (voiced by Tim Wright) that talks to Mickey about using the boomerang wisely; otherwise, incorrect use of the boomerang can lead to consequences. Mickey learns how to use the boomerang wisely to prevent something terrible happening like undoing the mistake he did to the people earlier by using it precisely to undo the consequences he did earlier.

==Role in the series==
When [[Mickey Mouse]] attempts to use a boomerang across the Australian outback, the muscular kangaroo appears next to him, just as the kangaroo's joey tells him that a boomerang journey ends in his hands, telling him to use the boomerang wisely before something terrible happens. Rather than listening to the joey's advice, Mickey tosses the boomerang all across Australia, taking objects from many citizens, resulting in an angry mob chasing Mickey all across Australia. Feeling sad that the boomerang has done something terrible, the kangaroo appears again next to Mickey with the joey telling him that a boomerang's journey begins and ends in his hands. Planning to end the journey, Mickey decides to undo the terrible things he did by accident thanks to the joey's advice.

==Trivia==
*The muscular kangaroo is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Roger (kangaroo)|Roger the Kangaroo]], who became an internet meme for his muscular physique.
*The muscular kangaroo is most likely a female kangaroo, as only females have pouches in real life.
