'''Magik''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'', played by [[Anya Taylor-Joy]]. She is [[Colossus (X-Men)|Colossus]]' sister, and her nature as a [[Mutants|mutant]] gives her access to magic, which she uses to great effect, as she is an expert sorceress.

Magik was created by Len Wein, Dave Cockrum, Chris Claremont, and Sal Buscema.

==Background==
Illyana Rasputin hails from [[Russia]]; growing up with her older brother [[Colossus (X-Men)|Peter]]. One day, the two were separated and Illyana found herself sold into child slavery. Her only mode of escape was drawing. Her Mutant powers manifested and she discovered that she could magically create portals to another realm called "limbo" as well as create a powerful weapon for herself called the Soulsword. Illyana would flee into limbo to escape her captors, which just so happened to be horrifying creatures called the Smile Men. Eventually, Illyana ended up in a new prison; a hospital run by Dr. [[Cecilia Reyes]].

Illyana became more distant from the rest and was particularly hurtful towards [[Mirage (Marvel)|Danielle Moonstar]]; calling her names such as "[[Pocahontas]]" and "Standing Rock". They eventually came to blows with Illyana retreating to her childhood comfort; a small hand puppet of a purple dragon named Lockheed. She slowly began to respect Dani due to her just as toughened exterior and began to appreciate her comrades more.

Illyana was soon attacked by the Smile Men who came after her and Sam Guthrie. With his encouragement, she overcame her fear of her torturous past and unlocked her potential to go after the dreaded [[Demon Bear]] with a real life version of Lockheed. When told that the entity was magic, she responded "So am I" and took it on. After Dani defeated Demon Bear, Illyana accepted her friends as her surrogate family and left the hospital with them.

===Abilities and weapons===
*'''Magical''' '''Teleportation''': Illyana can teleport by means of opening portals to another dimension simply called "limbo". This appears to only be temporary as they drop her back off into the real world.
*'''Mystic armor''': Illyana can summon a small armor plate on her shoulder for protection.
*'''Soulsword''': Illyana can summon a weapon that can slice through just about anything.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Magik joined the New Mutants at a much later time as she was not an original member. She replaces Xi'an Coy Manh / Karma, a Vietnamese girl who could control other people's minds.
