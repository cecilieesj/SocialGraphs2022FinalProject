One morning, Aamir's [[Yusuf Khan|father]] interrupts him, mid-prayer, warning that he'll starve to death if he doesn't stop praying for long enough, and Aamir, in-response, asks God to forgive him. [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] comes down, to get ready for her upcoming driving test, and her brother reminds her to say "Bismillah", before she begins.

Later that day, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] hands Aamir a box to place in the attic, before he unpacks the groceries. He questions why Kamala can't do it, and Muneeba reminds him they will be running errands for his upcoming wedding. Before they leave, Aamir warns Kamala not to mess the errands up.

That evening, Aamir arrives and greets his family, only to find them in the middle of a tense exhange. Kamala is refused permission by her parents to go to AvengerCon, and take part in a [[Captain Marvel]] cosplay costume. She brings her brother forward, and argues that if Aamir had asked, he would be allowed. Aamir heads to Kamala's room, after she angrily storms away from her parents, with a cup of tea to comfort her. He admires her boldness in asking, though criticises her method in doing so. Kamala complains that all her mother does, is say no to her, so Aamir promises to talk them, on her behalf. As he leaves, he asks whether he should keep the light on, teasing Kamala about her fear of [[djinn]]. She snaps back that she isn't twelve, but he throws her giant stuffed sloth towards her, which suggests otherwise, and wishes her a good night. Aamir goes on to talk to his parents, and they eventually agree she can go, on the conditions that their father drive her and escort her, and she wears a costume of their mothers making.

A few days later, the family later are having dinner together, and Aamir informs Muneeba that he'll be going to visit his fiance, [[Tyesha Hillman|Tyesha]] that evening.

Aamir attends mosque, when [[Sheikh Abdullah]] is forced to stop in the middle of his lecture, to ask two of the girls to stop talking. Kamala apologises, and epxresses that her lack of concentration is caused by the partition that seperates them, to Aamir's embarrassment.

Aamir and Tyesha later arrive in a restaaunt, where they spot Kamala with a boy. She claims he's their cousin, to Aamir's confusion, and the boy, [[Kamran]], affirms that he's Uncle Choudhury's nephew. Aamir questions why he has a British accent, seeing as how Uncle Choudhury is from Pakistan, and Kamran claims he was doing a bit, because hes a fan of ''The Great British Bake off''.  Aamir laughs this off, and as Tyesha scurries them away, Aamir recalls remembering him, looking at obscene things on the intertnet, and calls him "Haram-Dot-Kamran".

At home, Tyehsa is invited for dinner, and the family talk about Aamir's past, and reference how he worked at Hot Topic and had a goth phase. The conversation soon moves to their larger family, and Aamir listens in, as Yusuf reveals to Tyesha that Muneeba's family moved to Karachi after the Partition of India, when the British left the colonies in shambles, and a civil war broke out. Aamir comments that every Pakistani family has a partition story, none of which are good. When Muneeba leaves the table to clear up, Aamir further listens, as Yusuf talks about Muneeba's family history. He and Kamala give each other a look, having heard the story before, as Yusuf reveals to Tyesha, that during the Partition, Muneeba's mother, [[Sana Ali|Sana]] got seperated from her family, just as the last train leaving the city was set to go, but miraculousy returned on the train, with Aamir chiming in, that she returned just before the train pulled out of the station. Yusuf continues on, and states that Sana claimed to have followed a trail of stars, which lead her back to her [[Hasan|father]], while her [[Aisha|mother]] was among those who disappeared. Kamala suddenly faints while at the table, and he and the others surround her until she comes to. Believing its the evi eye, Aamir begins to recite a prayer.

On Eid, Aamir discusses Bon Jovi with his father. Muneeba admits that  she may never have met Yusuf, if it wasn't for ''Slippery When Wet'', and Aamir expresses his disgust. The bell rings and Tyesh aarrive to greet him. He questions how she'd feel if their first wedding dance was to "Livin On A Prayer", and she replies she'd prefer it over, "You Give Love a Bad Name".

They arrive at the festival and meet up with [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] who is also in attendance. Bruno wonders if his attire is too bright, and Aamir comments it is. He and Tyesha admire the setup of the event, and greet a friend.

The day of Aamir and Tyesha’s mehndi party arrives. As per tradition, a pair of the groom’s shoes are meant to be hidden, but Aamir finds that they've all been taken, to the amusement of the party guests.

On his wedding day, Aamir gets jitters, and begins fretting about only having $723.49 in his savings accounts. His father tells him not to worry, and advises him that when faced between fear and love, a man should choose love. He expresses his admiration in the courage Aamir displays, by being his authentic self, and getting ready to commit to Tyesha as her husband, having ultimately chosen family. Aamir and Tyesha are married by Sheikh Abdullah, and a party is held at venue. Aamir and his family take part in celebrations, including participating in a dance. Following this, the fire alarm is triggered, and the partygoers are forced to exit the building. Aamir makes sure to take the money, before he leaves.

Aamir and his family wait outside, for Kamala, but are unable to locate her. [[Damage Control]] storm the building, and arrest a [[Clandestines|group]], that Kamala was seen with, during the wedding. They eventually return to home, where Kamala joins them, much later, but she is unable to provide any answers.
