|status=Active|parents=LaVerne (mother)|alias=Animals (by Pepe)}}'''Animal''' is a wild and frenzied monster Muppet who loves to play the drums. He serves as the drummer for [[The Muppets (group)|the Muppets]]' resident rock and roll band [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]].
A crazed percussionist, Animal has three styles of music ― loud, louder and deafening. He speaks in a guttural shout, often repeating a few simple phrases, such as "BEAT DRUMS! BEAT DRUMS!" or "WO-MAN!" or "DRUM DRUM!" In relatively calmer moods, he is capable of more coherent conversation, but these instances are infrequent.
==Appearances==
===Muppet appearances===
Animal first appeared in the 1975 pilot, ''[[w:c:muppet:The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence|The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence]]'', chained up in a basement, when he wasn't onstage performing with the Electric Mayhem. He later became a main character on ''The Muppet Show'' and his unrestrained style has made him popular with young people for decades.

Animal's wild attitude can be compared to [[w:c:muppet:Cookie Monster|Cookie Monster]]. In ''[[w:c:muppet:A Muppet Family Christmas|A Muppet Family Christmas]]'', after observing Cookie Monster eating all of [[Janice|Janice's]] cookies in his signature manner, Animal comments, "That my kind of fella!"

Animal's family life is generally non-existent, and outside of the band, the ''Muppet Show'' troupe and women in general, he has no other relationships. A significant exception is depicted in the book ''The Case of the Missing Mother'', which reveals the existence of Animal's [[w:c:muppet:Mother|mother]], [[community:c:muppet:LaVerne|LaVerne]]. LaVerne is also a drummer and it's implied that percussion skills are a family trait.

Three of the other members of the Electric Mayhem were created by Muppet designer [[w:c:muppet:Michael K. Frith|Michael K. Frith]] and the sketches reproduced in the 1981 book ''[[w:c:muppet:Of Muppets and Men (book)|Of Muppets and Men]]'' show that they were based on famous musicians. [[Dr. Teeth]] is a cross between [[w:c:muppet:Dr. John|Dr. John]] and [[Elton John]]; [[w:c:muppet:Sgt. Floyd Pepper|Sgt. Floyd Pepper]] is based on [[w:c:muppet:The Beatles|the Beatles]]' ''Sgt. Pepper'' album and the original concept for [[w:c:muppet:Janice|Janice]] was a skinny, long-haired male character based on [[w:c:muppet:Mick Jagger|Mick Jagger]]. Animal, on the other hand, was designed by [[Jim Henson]] and the rough sketch (also seen in ''Of Muppets and Men'') doesn't appear to be related to any real musician.

However, it's not surprising that Animal is often compared with famous drummers ― as [[w:c:muppet:Buddy Rich|Buddy Rich]] said in [[w:c:muppet:Episode 522: Buddy Rich|his ''Muppet Show'' episode]], "All drummers are animals." Animal himself considers Rich one of his musical influences, along with Gene Krupa, Keith Moon of The Who and Ginger Baker of Cream and Blind Faith.

===''[[Disney Infinity]]''===
Animal makes a cameo in ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' as a townsperson. In the 3DS version, he will change all the adventure spaces into Power Adventure.

==Trivia==
*Guest stars on ''The Muppet Show'' could request to appear in a scene with their favorite Muppet. Miss Piggy was the most requested, with Animal as a close second.
* His film appearances in ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' and ''Muppets from Space'' are both owned by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], ''It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie'' is owned by [[Universal Studios|NBCUniversal]], the other Muppet movies are owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] (along with the rest of the Muppet franchise).
*The 2018 "Muppet Babies" reboot confirms that Animal is a monster.
