'''Angela Moore''' was [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]]'s first and only long term girlfriend and [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]]'s best friend.

==Personality==
Angela was portrayed as practical, sentimental, intelligent, and compassionate. She was shown to look at problems in a well thought out point of view and usually tried to keep her own emotions aside, something she evidently learned from her father, whom she's very close to. She was shown to have a witty, teasing and sarcastic sense of humor and was one of the more mature members of the group of friends, at times more mature than Topanga.

She was also shown to be a greatly supportive person and often strived to make her friends meet their full potential. Angela was often passionate about people and was shown to have an affinity for the arts, especially poetry.

==History==
===Early life===
Not much is known about Angela before she was introduced. We do know that her mother had abandoned her and her father sometime before she was twelve, which scarred her emotionally.

===Season 5===
She first appears in episode ''Boy Meets Real World'' sitting next to [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] in [[Mr. Feeny]]'s class, but there are no interaction between the two seen on screen. There is only one scene, where she questions the legitimacy of [[Cory Matthews|Cory]]'s film originality.

In the next episode ''I Love You, Donna Karan'' we find out that [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] and Angela have gone out for two weeks, and he has now ended the relationship due to his 2-week rule. Later on, [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] falls in love with the girl who owns a purse where he discovers by the contents of the purse that they had a lot in common. In an effort to meet the girl of his dreams, he waits by the jukebox at Chubbies for her to find her lost purse. Moments later her boyfriend comes down the stairs and they hug. [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] is heartbroken. We see at the end that the things contained in the bag actually belonged to Angela, which she borrowed from Beth.

During ''Chasing Angela'', [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] finally confronts Angela with his feelings for her after his initial fear, while later [[Cory Matthews|Cory]] sets them up on a fancy date at Bareli's. After witnessing [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]] and [[Cory Matthews|Cory]] make up after arguing, they agreed that they both wanted what [[Cory Matthews|Cory]] and [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]] had. They have been going out off and on ever since.

===Season 6===
They break up and remain as friends during ''Ain't College Great?'' because [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]]'s insists that they should meet new people. Although later we find out that [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] actually still (secretly) has feelings for Angela, and also that she is still in love with him. In ''Poetic License: An Ode to Holden Caulfield'', [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] lied about the date he had written his poem for Angela, which was read by [[Cory Matthews|Cory]] once [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]]'s leaves (unable to go through with it) to assure her that they were both still friends. [[Cory Matthews|Cory]] makes numerous attempts to bring them back together, and accidentally spills the secret Angela only shared with him in ''Friendly Persuasion'' (where she admits that she wanted [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] to believe the feeling [of meeting new people] was mutual, and she was still in love with him) as he presumed [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]] had spoken about it with Angela; who also shared a secret with [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]], as she figured out that he lied about the date he had written poem in his journal due to it being birthday gift.

===Season 7===
They officially reconcile by ''Angela's Men'' by way of Angela's father. We learn that Angela did not want to hurt [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] because she might leave him like her mother did to her father. Sgt. Moore helps her realize that she won't because she is in love, therefore giving her the will to finally say 'I Love You' to Shawn.

In ''Angela's Ashes'' before the series finale, Sgt. Moore offers Angela the chance to stay with him for a year in Europe. [[Cory Matthews|Cory]] initially tells [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] not to ask her to stay (giving an example of him asking [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]] to not go to Yale) to only tell [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] later that he failed by not fighting for his woman and giving her a chance to go to Europe. Toward the end of the episode, [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] questions Angela's father's right to take her away from her friends and life at Pennbrook. In attempt to counter his selfishness, Shawn asks him if he would still like him if he were to ask Angela to marry him. After uncomfortable laughter, Sgt. Moore informs him if he thinks he can handle that responsibility, he'll let him be the most important man in her life. When Angela enters her dorm room where they had been packing her belongings, [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] takes her into the corner to ask her something. Because Angela cuts him off by thanking him for understanding that spending time with her father was important to her, he declines, and we never find out what the question was. It is not far fetched to believe it may have been a proposal.

During her goodbyes to [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]], [[Cory Matthews|Cory]], [[Jack Hunter|Jack]], [[Eric Matthews|Eric]] and [[Rachel McGuire|Rachel]], Angela and [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]] hug each other before she goes; though insisting that they should never say 'goodbye' Shawn does so under his breath as she leaves. It's not sure what happened to Shawn and Angela's relationship after the series ended. Angela probably came back to Shawn, as she promised, and married him. We can only hope.
