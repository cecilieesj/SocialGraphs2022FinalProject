'''Ronald''' "'''Ron'''" '''Wilson''' is a minor character in ''[[Sky High]]''.

==Role in the film==
Ron is one of the [[Sky High School]] bus drivers and pilots. Ron is the son of two superheroes, but does not have any powers himself. Despite this, he feels a great sense of pride in merely driving the "superheroes of tomorrow" to school.

He helps to save Sky High by preventing [[Royal Pain]]'s henchman from escaping with the superhero babies, claiming he is the only one authorized to transport superheroes. He is the rare case of a person born to two supers who inherits no powers. However, he later falls into toxic waste and gains superpowers. He uses the power to grow to a gigantic size to fight off giant robots for the mayor.
