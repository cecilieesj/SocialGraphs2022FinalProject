'''Heng Heng''' is a character in the third season of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.

==Background==
Despite herself as a panda and her interests in bamboo, Heng Heng usually didn't know when to compromise ever since she clashed with a lemur named Kely. During the dispute between her and Kely, the [[Lion Guard]] takes her and Kely to [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] to alternate shifts between her and Kely.

==Role in the series==

Aside from her cameo appearances in "[[The River of Patience]]" and "[[Little Old Ginterbong]]", Heng Heng plays an important role in the episode "[[The Lake of Reflection]]" where she argues with [[Kely]] and [[Kely's Troop|his lemurs]] about bamboo. As the Lion Guard looks at their dispute, Heng Heng introduces herself to the Guard, telling them that pandas like her have a specific requirement when is the right time to eat. The dispute between her and Kely is interrupted as the Lion Guard (this time only with Bunga, Fuli, Ono, Beshte, and Anga) takes her to [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Queen Rani]] to solve the problem. Just as the Guard, Heng Heng, and the lemurs approach Rani, she gives the panda and the lemurs about shifting routines in the bamboo forest as a compromise to which the lemurs and pandas share the bamboo first. Heng Heng takes the lemurs to the bamboo forest.

In "[[Triumph of the Roar]]", Heng Heng is one of the victims under attack by [[Makucha's Army]]. Fortunately, [[Kion]], who mastered the power of the [[Roar of the Elders]], manages to save her alongside the other animals from a gruesome fate.

==Trivia==
