'''Miss Atlantis''' is the circus' resident mermaid who spends much of her time isolated in a tank in the [[2019]] remake of ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''.

==Background==
===Behind the scenes===
Sharon Rooney was cast to portray Miss Atlantis. "When you first see Miss Atlantis, she's not the happiest member of the circus family," she says. "She's on her own quite a lot and keeps herself apart, like a sad little fish. But as the story grows, so does she, and she starts to come into her own and become part of the family."

Rooney was tapped to sing the iconic song "[[Baby Mine]]" in the film. "It's such a powerful moment," she says. "Separating a new mom from her baby is just so awful, and I think the troupe all feel it in their hearts. We made up a backstory for Miss Atlantis â€” I think as an actress, it's really important to know why she's singing what she's singing. It's such a powerful song."

Miss Atlantis' costume consisted of more than 100 overlapping scales, which were hand stitched. Alternating rows of black and turquoise, they were constructed from three to four layers of fabric with sequin borders to give each scale a reflective quality.

==Role in the film==
Miss Atlantis is introduced as one of the circus performers who is billed as one of the world's only living mermaid where she and the other performers help build the tent. They later gaze upon the birth of [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] in awe. Throughout the film, she is one of the performers who appears in the freak show section. Later after the circus tent collapses due to [[Mrs. Jumbo]]'s rampage across it, she later sings "[[Baby Mine]]" by a campfire, as all the other performers share their condolences after the incident.

Furthermore, Miss Atlantis and the other performers travel to an amusement park in [[Arkansas]] called Dreamland as Dumbo's act was a success. After it is found out that Vandevere Enterprises has fired all the performers, [[Holt Farrier]], his children, [[Joe Farrier|Joe]] and [[Milly Farrier|Milly]], and the performers plan to rescue Dumbo by releasing back into the wild him alongside Mrs. Jumbo. Miss Atlantis plays an important role in arriving at [[Nightmare Island]] by diving into the water pretending to be a mermaid wanting freedom, outsmarting the guards trying to stop her while the other performers barge in and take the transport vehicle with Mrs. Jumbo inside just before the park owner, [[V.A. Vandevere]], and his guards try to stop the circus troupe. Later, Miss Atlantis, Joe, Milly, and the rest of the circus performers spend their last moments with Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo before they get released into the wild.

Later when the circus is re-established as the Medici Family Circus, Miss Atlantis remains her duty as a circus performer just as [[Ringmaster|Max Medici]] describes her as the Shakespearean-reciting mermaid alongside [[Puck (Dumbo)|Puck]].

==Trivia==
*Her last name is a reference to a legendary island which sunk to the bottom of the sea in mythology.
