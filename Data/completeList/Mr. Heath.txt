== Role in the Film ==
After Leland realizes that [[Henry Casey]] is about to go back to [[Lily Joseph]]'s village to help her find the caribou, he orders Mr. Heath to assassinate Henry. As he tries to shoot Henry, his mule blocks the way and he flees.

When the time of the hunting came, Henry, with White Fang and Peter goes to the forest. Lily grabs her bow and secretly slips into the forest to join Henry hunt. As Henry, Lily and White Fang arrive at their destination, they realize that the path is blocking the caribou. They went back and, they accidentally fell into a hole, which led them to the mining area. They quietly walked and hide from the miners. There was a guard guarding, and he suddenly heard a sound. He wandered what was there and Lily shouted, and Henry hit him. They get the dynamite that will open the path that blocks the animals. Then they saw Leland and Mr. Heath. Henry shot him, and Leland ordered his miners to catch him. Henry and Lily ran. Henry saw an exit, but Lilly was caught by the miners, and Lily let Henry go. Then Henry saw White Fang. He guards him from Reverend Leland Drury's men while he plants the dynamite to the path. The path exploded!! The animals were free.

Leland orders Mr. Heath to get Lily. Henry and White Fang ran, and they saw Lilly with Leland. White Fang jumped and attacked Leland, while Henry jumped in order to save Lilly. Henry untied Lilly, and when the screw combining the horses and the thing Reverend Leland Drury and Lilly riding on was removed, it separated it and the thing Lilly and Henry was riding on fell into a cliff then they both jumped off.
