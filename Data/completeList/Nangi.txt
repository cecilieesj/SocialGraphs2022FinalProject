'''Nangi''' is a minor character in the 2016 [[Disney]] feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''. She is [[Mr. Otterton]]'s notable yoga instructor at the [[Mystic Springs Oasis]].

== Background ==

=== Physical appearance ===
Nangi is an Indian elephant with dusty-gray skin and blue eyes. She has stubby tusks, as well as purple eyeshadow and mehndi tattoos on her stomach and trunk. She wears nothing aside from a gold beaded bracelet on her wrist.

=== Personality ===
Nangi appears to be very dismissive, apathetic, and disagreeable, especially in her conversation with [[Yax]], [[Judy Hopps]], and [[Nick Wilde]]. She speaks in a way which seems to suggest that she does not care about what is going on around her. Whether or not she could actually remember anything about Mr. Otterton, she stated that she didn't, suggesting that she simply was disinterested in the conversation.

== Role in the film ==
Nangi is at the Mystic Springs Oasis teaching yoga when she is approached by Yax, as well as Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, asking for information regarding missing otter Emmitt Otterton, who frequented the establishment and was instructed in yoga by her.

Either by choice or by genuine forgetfulness, Nangi states that she has no recollection of Emmitt, nor any details regarding his most recent visit to the Oasis, allowing Yax to unwittingly reveal all of the information Judy and Nick need.

With the information obtained and the duo able to follow the lead - including the license plate number of the car Emmitt was last seen getting into - Judy and Nick leave Nangi and Yax to their business.

== Video games ==

=== ''[[Disney Crossy Road]]'' ===
Nangi can be obtained as a playable character if you complete daily missions.

== Trivia ==
* In Hindi and Urdu, Nangi means "naked female". It even hints someone who is a generous individual.
*Nangi is designed after her voice actress, [[Gita Reddy|Gita Reddy.]]
* Nangi was originally going to be male according to early concept art.<ref>https://zootopia.fandom.com/wiki/File:Nangi_Concept_Art.jpeg</ref>
** Every book based on ''Zootopia'' spells "Nangi" as ''"''Nanga''"'' because the latter means "naked male", and several of the books incorrectly identify her as male.
* In the comic ''Judy Hopps and the Missing Jumbo-Pop'', Nangi has brown skin instead of grey. Either she spends too much time in the mud or because the creators decided to tweak her color palette.
*The snowflake-like tattoo on her stomach and over her belly button somewhat resembles the snowflakes from ''[[Frozen]].''
*Yax said that he wishes he had a steel â€œmind" like Nangi's. This is a reference to the fact that elephants, in real life, have excellent memories. Even though Nangi seems to be the bare opposite.
*Almost every trailer and TV spot showed Nangi saying "All the way down!" at her yoga class (to the level of Trailer Joke Decay). She never utters this line in the final movie.
