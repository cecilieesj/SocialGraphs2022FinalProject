Two distinct units appear briefly in the film. They are neutral characters because they do not actually work against [[WALL-E (character)|the protagonist]] or help him.

Garbage truck bots are gray colored hovering truck shaped robots with two camera eyes. They have black and yellow warning stripes on their hull.

==Role in the film==
The first garbage truck robot appears when [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] was chasing the MVR-AÂ transport bot that was taking [[EVE]] and [[GO-4]] away. WALL-E spots the garbage truck robot dumping garbage to a trash chute near him. When the second time garbage truck robot appears it is seen by EVE when it dumps trash to a trash chute that is connected to captains quarter. When the garbage truck robot leaves EVE flies through the same chute and brings the plant to the [[Captain B. McCrea|captain]].

==Trivia==
*The two garbage truck bots that appear in the movie are clearly two separate units because their colouring is slightly different. The alignment of a large yellow line that stretches across the robot's hull is a bit different on the two bots.
