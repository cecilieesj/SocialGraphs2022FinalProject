'''Sofia the Seagull''' is a supporting character who appears in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2022]] [[Pinocchio (2022 film)|remake of ''Pinocchio'']]. She is a talking seagull whom [[Jiminy Cricket]] encounters while trying to help give Pinocchio a good conscience.

==Background==
===Personality===
Sofia is a very friendly seagull. She is shown to be extremely supportive of Jiminy when it comes to Pinocchio in danger like when [[Honest John]] and [[Gideon]] take him to [[Stromboli]]'s puppet theater. In spite of this, she is also shown to be helpful to [[Geppetto]] like when it comes to Pinocchio who is taken to [[Pleasure Island]] by [[the Coachman]], which leads [[Geppetto]] to help find Pinocchio and make sure he is safe. Though she shows a good support to Pinocchio and Jiminy, she is shown to be fearful of [[Monstro]] when he emerges from the ocean and attempts to eat her.

===Physical appearance===
Sofia mostly has a plumage of white feathers on her body resembling a typical seagull - specifically resembling any species of seagull part of the ''Larus'' genus. She also a plumage of light gray feathers on her wings, a yellow beak, a pair of yellow feet. She also has a pair of light blue eyes.

==Role in the film==
Sofia first appears when she flies on a signage of [[Geppetto's Workshop]] after [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] sets out for school while [[Geppetto]] gives her food from the trashcan for her breakfast. Suddenly when [[Jiminy Cricket]] overhears Geppetto that he sent Pinocchio to school, he suddenly exits Geppetto's Workshop and sees Sofia outside the shop while eating her breakfast which she confuses Jiminy for her prey. However, it turns out that Sofia dislikes eating crickets like Jiminy and instead eats scraps left over by Geppetto where Jiminy introduces himself to Sofia which she introduces herself to Jiminy.

Jiminy explains to Sofia that he is Pinocchio's conscience, asking her to take him to the school. She then replies to Jiminy who overslept last night and before she can continue talking, Jiminy tells Sofia that Pinocchio is running around the streets without a conscience, asking her about the troubles he will receive without one, which Sofia replies to him that he wouldn't want a situation like that on her conscience which she agrees to help Jiminy get to Pinocchio to help him stay out of trouble. As Sofia is carrying Jiminy using her beak, Jiminy sees Pinocchio walking alongside [[Honest John]] singing the musical number "[[Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee]]" while walking alongside [[Gideon]] which Jiminy halts the two from taking Pinocchio to [[Stromboli]]'s puppet theater.

Later that night, Sofia approaches Geppetto who is looking for Pinocchio all across the village with [[Figaro]] and [[Cleo]] assisting him just as Sofia hands out a poster of [[Pleasure Island]] to him, where he thinks Pinocchio is taken to this amusement park, which Sofia agrees, leading Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo a clue to find Pinocchio and take him back home to make sure he is safe. Later, when Pinocchio and Jiminy manage to escape from Pleasure Island to Geppetto's Workshop, the two find Sofia outside Geppetto's shop where Jiminy finds out that Geppetto sold all of his clocks Sofia then reveals Geppetto has sailed out to sea via sailboat which he used to get to Pleasure Island to find Pinocchio and reunite with him, discussing that the clocks meant everything to him, much to the two's sadness. Pinocchio asks Sofia if Geppetto sold his clocks to find him, which Sofia agrees, explaining that he means more to him than his clocks, leading Pinocchio, Jiminy, and Sofia to find Geppetto on his boat where he sold all of his clocks to find him.

At the beach, Jiminy discusses with Pinocchio that Geppetto left his workshop about two hours ago and headed south, agreeing to airlift them to help find him, which Sofia intervenes with Jiminy, explaining that she'll only airlift Jiminy, not Pinocchio, due to his size. Pinocchio then discusses to Jiminy and Sofia while devising a plan to find Geppetto which Sofia agrees to help Pinocchio and Jiminy to help find Geppetto.

Suddenly, Sofia holds on a rope tight for Jiminy and Pinocchio to hold on rope for the two while Sofia flies to search for a boat only to find water. While flying, Sofia alerts the two that she saw a boat where Geppetto would be at and as Pinocchio, Jiminy, and Sofia are approaching the boat, Geppetto suddenly sees the three approaching him just as Geppetto is happy to see his son back. Sofia continues flying towards the boat while Pinocchio recaps the events of what he experienced before he was separated from Geppetto just as he is happy that he will return home with him. However, [[Monstro]] emerges from the ocean and swallows Pinocchio, Jiminy, Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo inside just as Sofia is almost swallowed by the sea monster. Soon as Monstro emerges from the ocean, Sofia suddenly retreats in fear, escaping from him. Jiminy then dismounts out of Sofia's back to help him find a way inside Monstro and help him find Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Cleo inside Monstro while Sofia escapes from Monstro. She makes no further appearances after that, even after Pinocchio happily reunites with Geppetto after escaping from Monstro.

==Trivia==
*Sofia only talks in situations where Jiminy or Pinocchio is next to her. In situations where she approaches Geppetto, her dialogues only go through seagull squawks.
*It is unknown if Sofia is aware of [[Honest John]], [[Gideon]], [[Stromboli]], or [[the Coachman]] as she has neither interacted with one of them.
*Sofia was created exclusively for the [[2022]] [[Pinocchio (2022 film)|remake of ''Pinocchio'']] and does not appear in the original [[1940]] [[Pinocchio (film)|animated film]], but does have a counterpart in the original {{WikipediaLink|Carlo Collodi}} book in the form of the giant pidgeon that carries Geppetto to the beach when he decides to look for Pinocchio oversea, then later finds Pinocchio and takes him to the beach, where Geppetto just took off on his boat.
*Sofia is the only seagull who appears in the remake; no other seagulls from the original 1940 film appear in the remake aside from Sofia.
**In the original film, there were multiple seagulls attacking Jiminy on his way to find Pinocchio who is inside Monstro where they were antagonistic and tried to eat Jiminy, unlike Sofia from the remake who shows a friendly personality to Jiminy.
