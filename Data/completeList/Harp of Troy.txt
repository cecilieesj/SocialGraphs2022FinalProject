The '''Harp of Troy''' (known in the 2017 series as the '''Harp of Mervana''') is a magical harp featured in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[Raiders of the Lost Harp]]", and in the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' episode "[[The Lost Harp of Mervana!]]".

==Appearance==
In the 1987 series, she is a small hand-held harp shaped like a beautiful female duck with white feathers, golden hair, and a pink toga.

In the 2017 series, she is a full-sized harp shaped like a beautiful female duck with brown feathers, purple-pink hair, and a rose-red toga.

==Personality==
In the 2017 series, she is a sassy and tough-but-fair voice of reason. She believes it is very important for people to hear the truth, even hard truths, and deal with the problems of the real world.

==History==
[[Scrooge McDuck]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews]] discover the harp inside a giant stone chest held by a stone Minotaur. They ship her all the way back home to [[Duckburg]]. Scrooge uses her to detect whenever someone is lying. However, [[Magica De Spell]] wants her, and disguises herself as Helen of Troy in an attempt to get her hands on her.

However, once the harp is removed from the box she is in, the Minotaur awakens, angry that someone has taken what is rightfully his. He follows them all the way back to [[Duckburg]], unwilling to stop until he gets his hands on her again. Submarine torpedoes and aircraft missiles seem to do no damage to him, as he seems to be protected by some sort of magic. At the end of the episode, Scrooge sadly gives the Harp back to the Minotaur.

The Harp was voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]. In the 2017 series, she is voiced by Retta.

In the 2017 series, her "lie detector" song goes off when [[Betina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] says she's not keeping any secrets from [[Webby]], indicating that Beakley is indeed lying to Webby.

In the episode "[[Escape from the ImpossiBin!]]", [[F.O.W.L.]] steals the Harp.

==Abilities==
Whenever someone tell a lie in her presence, she sings, "No-no-no-no! You're fibbing, fibbing, fibbing!"
