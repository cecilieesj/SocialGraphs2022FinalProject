Upon arriving at the [[White Rabbit's House]], [[Alice]] would've encountered the monkey and attempted to start up a conversation with him, only to be completely ignored. Presently, the [[White Rabbit]] came riding up on a high-wheeled bicycle and crashed into the monkey, sending him flying into a vegetable frame. Upon hearing his [[White Rabbit|master]] fret over his glasses, which broke when the bicycle hit the ground, the monkey would have stood up, helped the [[White Rabbit]] into a wheelbarrow and proceeded to wheel it toward the [[White Rabbit's House|house]].
