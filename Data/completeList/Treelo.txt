==Role in the series==
As a lemur, Treelo loves swinging from vines and other things and is very energetic. He loves feathers and has a collection of them. He also knows how to wiggle his ears. Treelo speaks in a unique trilling manner that sometimes becomes incoherent, especially when he gets excited. This sort of babbling is sometimes referred to on closed-captioning as "Treeloese."

Treelo seems to be just a bit younger than the other residents of [[the Big Blue House]]. He lives there when he's not playing outside. He apparently grew up there too and was raised by [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]], as Bear has memories of taking care of him when he was just a baby.

Treelo enjoys listening to music on the radio and dancing to it. If Treelo sees a radio, he will generally want to turn it on and play music.
