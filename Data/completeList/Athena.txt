'''Athena''' is the [[Olympian Gods|Olympian Goddess]] of wisdom and warfare from Disney's [[1997]] animated feature film, ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]'' and [[Hercules (TV series)|its television series]]. She has been locked in an eternal rivalry with her brother [[Ares]] for eons and both siblings usually scheme to have the other be made a fool of. She is the smarter of the two but nevertheless is known to play pranks on him.

==Appearances==
===''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''===
In the film, she has a very minor role in which she only appears in minor cameos.

At the beginning of the film, she is present for the party celebrating the arrival of [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] and [[Hera]]'s newborn child [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]. Athena is the one who swats the thunderbolt thrown by Hercules. Athena, along with the other gods, was sent to find Hercules, but it was too late as the baby had already been turned into a mortal and was adopted by a mortal family. Eighteen years later, when Hades frees the Titans to attack Mount Olympus, Athena joins the battle against the Titans, she is seen imprisoned with the other gods after they lost against [[Hades]] and the [[Titans]]. Luckily she and the other gods are freed by Hercules.

===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===
In "[[Hercules and the Secret Weapon]]", when Athena is informed that Hephaestus made a secret weapon for Ares, Athena instructs Hercules to steal the secret weapon from Ares. Athena arrives to claim the Armageddon bow, but then a fight starts between Ares and Athena until Hercules interrupts them and throws the bow into the hand of [[Cupid]], the God of Passion.

In "[[Hercules and the Assassin]]", Athena spots her brother, Ares, talking to humans and suspects he's meddling in Athenian affairs. And when she sees Hercules fighting Clion, she offers him any weapon to fight with. He chooses a junior javelin, much to her confusion. After Hercules has won she cheers, "Athens is number one!"

In "[[Hercules and the River Styx]]" and "Hercules and the Pool Party", Athena is one of the deities who ends up having her memory wiped clean after bathing in the Pool of Lethe at Hades' Pool Party.

In "[[Hercules and the Owl of Athens]]", Athena shaves Ares' dogs of war as a childish prank and he seeks revenge by threatening to do the same to her owl, [[Ibid]]. When she bestows it to Hercules for safekeeping, Ares sends his sons to reclaim it. When she and Hercules team up to get Ibid back, Fear and Terror capture her and Ares, needing Hercules to save them.
