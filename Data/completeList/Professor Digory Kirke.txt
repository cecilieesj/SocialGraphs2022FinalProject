'''Professor Digory Kirke''' is a character who appears in the [[2005]] Disney/[[Walden Media]] adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. He serves as the owner of his country home with Mrs. Macready being the strict housekeeper of his property in his country home just as Macready tells him that he is to avoid being bothered upon entering the house.

==Role in the film==
When the Pevensies enter the Professor's house, Mrs. Macready gives them a couple rules to which one of them is not to disturb the professor. [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] runs into the Professor after  [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] hurts her feelings, to which the Professor tells Mrs. Macready to take care of Lucy. The Professor then tells [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] and [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] that the two have upset the internal balance of his housekeeper to which Susan explains that it was Lucy who upset the balance while telling her about finding the mystical place of Narnia inside the wardrobe. During a game of cricket the following morning, Edmund hits the ball which accidentally breaks a stained glass window of a coat of arms inside the Professor's house (also knocking down a suit of armor inside), which breaks the Professor's house rules inside causing Mrs. Macready to hear the commotion inside to which the Pevensies manage to escape from Macready before being punished.

As the Pevensies leave Narnia at the end of the film, the Professor hears their commotion and curiously asks the four to know what they were doing in the wardrobe to which Peter tells the Professor that he wouldn't believe upon sharing his experience in Narnia with the Pevensies just as the Professor throws the ball Peter used during a game of cricket, reminding him of the moment before he and the other Pevensies entered Narnia. During the mid-credits scene, the Professor approaches Lucy who tells her that he wouldn't enter if he were Lucy to which the Professor tells Lucy to keep her eyes open the next time she looks into the wardrobe.
