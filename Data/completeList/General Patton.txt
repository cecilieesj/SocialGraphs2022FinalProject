'''General Patton''' is the general of [[Ace London]] on ''[[TaleSpin]]''. He appears in the episode "[[Mach One for the Gipper]]".

==Appearances==
General Patton first appears in his base by the communication towers pacing back and fourth waiting for Ace London who is to bring a secret engine. The doctor who is with him asks him where Ace London is, and he replies to relax. Then Ace London contacts them on the radio, relaying the info that he got the cargo, and that he's clear to land. After landing, Ace's fellow pilots open the cargo. However the cargo is full of pickles instead of the engine, and General Patton inquires about who was responsible for loading the wrong cargo. Ace replies that it was [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]], and Patton orders him to find Baloo and arrest him. And he does so.

When Baloo and [[Wildcat]] arrive at the base using the secret engine after evading [[Don Karnage]] and his [[Air Pirates]] who were also after the engine, General Patton prepares to arrest them, but then the echo of Baloo and Wildcat's voices in midair reveals that they succeeded in breaking the sound barrier, an achievement that makes them instantly famous.

Ace arrives, shrieking that he is the famous one, not Baloo, who stole the engine. Baloo then angrily explains that he is merely a lowly cargo pilot and he’s not a thief. Ace's fellow pilots then realize their mistake and inform Ace that Baloo is right, and that Ace loaded the wrong crate. And then when Baloo tried to give back Ace was shooting at him.

General Patton is furious at Ace for shooting at civilians, mishandling top-secret property, and aiding Don Karnage and his pirates in almost stealing the engine and lying to General Patton doesn’t make it any better . He goes on to congratulate and thank Baloo for testing the engine, and asks Baloo if there's anything the military can do for him. He replies that he needs to continue delivering pickles, but that the [[Sea Duck]] was damaged during the escape while dealing with Don Karnage and his pirates.

Patton winks and says that he knows the perfect man for the job: Ace London, who is now demoted to cargo pilot for his actions, while the military will repair the Sea Duck for free.
