'''Mr. Huggles''' the door mouse is [[Will Vandom]]'s pet in the W.I.T.C.H comic.

==Comic Series==

Mr. Huggles first appeared in the issue "The Twelve Portals". He didn't last as long in the book series as he did in the cartoon. He was eventually run over by a car.

==Animated Series==
He was a gift to Will from [[Matt Olsen]], but Will's mother forces Will to give Mr. Huggles to [[Irma Lair]]. Irma eventually hands him over to [[Hay Lin]]. Unfortunatly, Mr. Huggles escapes from his cage and creates chaos in "The Silver Dragon". Thanks to that, Hay Lin gives Mr. Huggles to [[Taranee Cook]], but Taranee's father has an allergy to fur. Taranee gives Mr. Huggles to [[Cornelia Hale]]. However, [[Lillian Hale]] frees Mr. Huggles so he can meet [[Napoleon]], but both pets end up making chaos. Cornelia gives Mr. Huggles to [[Elyon Brown]], but Mr. Huggles escapes again and is finally returned to Matt.

Mr. Huggles was eventually turned into Khor, the Destroyer by [[Nerissa Crossnic]]. Khor was the first of Nerissa's Four [[Knights of Destruction]] to be created. Transformed into a hulking, muscled humanoid, he feeds on anger. Even in this form, Mr. Huggles still has the qualities of a loyal pet. In the Knights of Destruction's final battle with the Guardians he is freed from Nerissa's control and reverts to his original dormouse form.

In "[[U is for Undivided]]", Mr. Huggles absorbs some of Lillian's power as the Heart of Earth, and becomes a Regent of Earth alongside [[Matt Olsen]] and [[Napoleon]].

==Trivia==
* Taranee recognizes Mr. Huggles as the species Muscardinus Avellanarius, or the common Hazel Door Mouse, found primarily in Europe.
