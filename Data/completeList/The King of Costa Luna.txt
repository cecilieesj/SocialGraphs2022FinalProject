== Background ==
The King of Costa Luna was the father of Princess Rosalinda and the husband of Queen Sophia. He was the ruler of Costa Luna as its king until his death sometimes prior to the events of the movie. He is mentioned by his wife and daughter. Not much is known about him except that he was most likely a humble king when Rosalinda said, "''My mother told me that my father never called himself ' a king'. For our people, he was 'a father, brother, and friend''' ". He is only seen in a picture inside Queen Sophia/Rosalinda's necklace.

== Trivia ==
Based on Rosalinda's first surname (which is usually the father's surname according to Spanish naming customs), his surname is Montoya.
