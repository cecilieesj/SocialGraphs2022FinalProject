'''Kayla''' is a minor character in the [[2020]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Onward]]''.

==Background==
Not much of Kayla's personality is known aside from being a customer at the [[Manticore's Tavern]].

==Role in the film==
Kayla is one of the customers at the [[Manticore's Tavern]]. However, due to [[Corey the Manticore]] upset about herself about being a warrior, she sets the tavern on fire, causing her and all the other survivors to evacuate. Kayla is seen taken to leave the tavern on fire, leaving the kid's menu she is doing behind.

Fortunately, [[Ian Lightfoot|Ian]] and [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]] escaped the tavern with the only surviving clue which is the kid's menu done by Kayla to help the brothers find the [[Phoenix Gem]] at [[Raven's Point]]. Kayla is later seen at the end of the film where the tavern once again is reopened where a customer's birthday is being celebrated with some other kids with Corey cutting a slice of cake for the kids.
