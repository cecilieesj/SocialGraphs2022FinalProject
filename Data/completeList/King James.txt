He later appears in the [[1998]] sequel, ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]].'' 

==Background==
Based partially on the historical figure of the same name, King James I is the ruler of England, Scotland (as James VI), and Ireland, his wife, and consort is [[Queen Anne]]. He is a tall man with a brown beard and a fancy crown and clothing. He also has an unknown named dog.

===Personality===
In the first film, he is merely mentioned, with his likeness appearing in a painting brought by the settlers.

In the second film, his character is fleshed out. In stark contrast to his historical counterpart, James is portrayed as a well-meaning, but narrow-minded ruler, which allows him to easily get led astray more than once by his close friend [[Governor Ratcliffe]], no matter how ridiculous or unlikely Ratcliffe's claims are. He also seems to have primitive views on the Native Americans, as he initially believes them to be mere savages as Ratcliffe did, and is very easily manipulated by Ratcliffe into orchestrating events that lead him to lock Pocahontas away and declare war on the Powhatan people. By the end of the film, however, he is shown the error of his ways and finally places Ratcliffe under arrest for his crimes.

==Appearances ==
===''[[Pocahontas]]''===
King James didn't appear in the first film but was mentioned by Ratcliffe in the film. Ratcliffe wishes to find gold and bringing it back to England. According to Ratcliffe, this will allow him to become successful and famous, and so gain the favor of the king. Ratcliffe later claims the New World and its riches in King James' name and has the settlement named Jamestown in the King's honor. During the song "[[Mine, Mine, Mine]]" Ratcliffe reveals that when he returns with the gold, he believes King James will reward Ratcliffe by Lording him. During the song, [[Wiggins]] brings Ratcliffe a portrait of King James, which Ratcliffe sticks his head through the picture, tearing it, while proclaiming his plan to make certain all the gold remains his.

===''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]''===
King James made his first appearance in the sequel. After returning to England, Governor Ratcliffe is brought before the King to answer for his crimes in Jamestown (for shooting one of his own men, nearly starting an unnecessary war, almost needlessly costing many lives, etc.). Ratcliffe lies and frames [[John Smith]] (the man he shot by accident and a key figure in his downfall and disgrace) for his crimes. King James, largely out of his friendship with Ratcliffe, believes him, and orders Smith to be arrested for treason, with the caveat that he is to be taken alive (most likely so that he could question Smith and get his side of the story). He also sends [[John Rolfe]] to Jamestown, with the intention of bringing back the [[Chief Powhatan |Indian Chief]]. The meeting will determine whether King James declares war on the Native Americans.

Later, Ratcliffe appears before the King, announcing that John Smith had died in an accident while being apprehended, despite Ratcliffe's attempts to save him. Unknown to the King, this is a lie, as Ratcliffe had purposefully pushed Smith off a roof into a canal (most likely to prevent Smith from possibly unraveling his lies). Ratcliffe attempts to convince King James to immediately go to war with the Native Americans, but Queen Anne insists that they must wait for Rolfe and the Indian Chief. King James, after taking into consideration his wife's and Ratcliffe's words, compromises: Ratcliffe may prepare the Armada, but they will wait for Rolfe and the Chief.

Rolfe later returns with the Chief's daughter, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]. He insists that the king should meet her, as she is both civilized and intelligent. On the advice of Ratcliffe, King James orders Rolfe to bring Pocahontas to an upcoming ball. If Pocahontas can make a good impression, the armada will not sail. At the ball, King James is initially impressed by Pocahontas, but when Pocahontas calls him and his people barbaric for torturing a bear during a bear-baiting (after King James accused her of the same thing for defending the bear), he, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, orders her and her bodyguard [[Uttamatomakkin]] imprisoned for treason, and declares war on her people. According to rumor, King James intended to have Pocahontas beheaded the next dawn.

Later, King James and Queen Anne are preparing to have court, when Pocahontas, Uttamatomakkin, John Rolfe, and a disguised John Smith burst into the room. The King attempts to have Pocahontas arrested, but Uttamatomakkin disables the guards and Queen Anne urges her husband to listen to the girl. Pocahontas tells the King that if he insists on war, her people will fight to the last warrior and there’s nothing to be gained, but much to be lost for everyone. She is corroborated by John Smith, who chooses to reveal himself, thus unraveling Ratcliffe's treachery, much to the King's utter shock. As the members of court begin to argue loudly over this revelation, Pocahontas urges King James that he must to listen to the voice within him, as only it can guide him to the right path. The King asks Pocahontas why she continues to speak out when so many doubt her, even when it could mean her life; Pocahontas replies that because, unlike Ratcliffe, she speaks only the truth.

The King, now realizing how foolish he was to believe Ratcliffe's lies and manipulations, silences his courtiers and gives Pocahontas, John Smith, and John Rolfe permission to stop Ratcliffe. After being defeated, Ratcliffe is confronted by King James and his guards. Unaware he gave them permission to do so, Ratcliffe attempts to tell the King that Pocohantas and her friends have sabotaged and the armada but this time, King James refuses to believe him and has his guards arrest him for his treachery and lies. King James pardons Pocahontas and Smith as an apology for his foolish mistakes and dispenses rewards for them and Rolfe. He grants Pocahontas  peace with her people, John Smith his own ship to sail the world with, and John Rolfe a promotion to Lord Advisor to the Royal Court. Rolfe turns down his reward, instead choosing to return to Virginia, as he has fallen in love with Pocahontas.

== Trivia ==

* Despite briefly showing hostility to John Smith, as well as Pocahontas and John Rolfe and the rest of the Native American Indians, King James isn't really considered to be an antagonist; he's briefly misled into that due to Governor Ratcliffe being the true mastermind of the whole movie.
