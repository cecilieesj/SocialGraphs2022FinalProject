She was first referenced in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', and made her debut in the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[WandaVision]]''.

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
While discussing ways to defeat the [[Avengers]], [[Ultron]] brings up the death of [[Quicksilver|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]]'s parents, having seen the records. Pietro gives detail, by talking about how a missile landed in their home, and when the first shell hit, two floors below, it made a large hole in the floor, with their parents falling in. Wanda reveals that the missile was produced by Stark.

====''[[WandaVision]]''====
Iryna is first mentioned in the [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]]. While discussing [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]], [[Jimmy Woo|Jimmy]] gives a quick brief on her history, and mentions that she was born in [[Sokovia]] in [[1989]], to Iryna and [[Olek Maximoff]], both killed during an air raid when Maximoff and her twin brother, [[Quicksilver|Pietro]], were ten.

Iryna is featured in the [[Previously On|eighth episode]] of the series. After [[Agatha Harkness|Agatha]] captures Wanda, she forces her to relive her most traumatic memories, and starts with the day her parents died. One night, while Iryna is doing housework, Olek returns from work. She opens the his work trunk and finds that he hasn't sold as many DVD's as she thought he would. He ensures her that he'll sell them tomorrow, and gives her a hug. Pietro arrives, informing his parents that the only rule of TV night is that they try to practice English, and Iryna corrects herself, stating they just wanted to get rid of the last little bit of Sokovian. Wanda arrives, and when she doesn't see the DVD she wants to watch within the trunk, Olek goes to retrieve it for her, while Iryna playfully covers Wanda's eyes. Her happy demeanor quickly fades, as she passes the window with the sound of gunshots, and men fighting. Olek picks out ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', and Iryna recites a synopsis of an episode, while using the term "Shenanigan". Pietro questions what that word means, and Wanda describes it to him, with Iryna giving an example. She asks Olek to start the show for them, and they begin watching. Wanda turns to her parents, while sitting on the floor, and Iryna gives her an air kiss from the couch. In the middle of the show, a missile lands in their house, destroying it, and killing Iryna and Olek.
