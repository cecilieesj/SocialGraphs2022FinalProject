Janice served as a minor character in the original Muppet movies, as well as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''. She later received more attention in the [[ABC]] television program ''[[The Muppets (TV series)|the muppets]]'', and got the attention of [[Sam the Eagle (Muppets)|Sam the Eagle]], who found himself falling in love with her during the first season.

==Background==

===History===
Janice is the lead guitar player in the [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem|Electric Mayhem]] on ''The Muppet Show''. She also portrays Nurse Janice in Veterinarian's Hospital and appears in various other sketches, frequently as a chorus member. She is occasionally seen in [[The Muppet Orchestra|the orchestra]] during the fourth and fifth seasons of the show. She has a very close relationship with the Electric Mayhem's bass player, [[Floyd Pepper]] (although, in the first season of ''The Muppet Show'', she was involved with [[Zoot]]).

In addition to the guitar, Janice has also played the tambourine with the Mayhem and the trumpet, trombone or banjo with the orchestra. In personality, Janice is generally laid-back, noted for her Valley girl "Fer sure" and "Rully" dialogue and behavior (such as tanning herself in ''The Great Muppet Caper''). Twice in the Muppet movies, when caught short during a loud and confusing group discussion, Janice has inadvertently revealed her attitudes towards nudity. In ''The Great Muppet Caper'', she's interrupted while justifying a willingness to walk along the beach naked to her mother, while in ''[[w:c:muppets:The Muppets Take Manhattan|The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', she claims that she doesn't pose naked, "even if it is artistic." Janice also has an affinity for baking, at least during the holidays: in ''A Muppet Family Christmas'', she makes Christmas cookies that are eaten by Cookie Monster, while she brings cupcakes to the party in ''[[A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa]]''. She lists [[Tina Turner]] and Joan Jett among her musical influences and Weezer and OK Go as some of her favorite current bands.

===Personality===
Janice is a hippie who likes to play and perform instruments, most noticeably the guitar. She is also very sweet and kind and likes to give her opinions on such matters, including animal rights and nature in general. 

Based on her personality and hints through [[ABC|ABC's]] ''[[The Muppets (TV series)|the muppets]]'', Janice is most likely either a vegan or vegetarian, and talks about how mean people can be to animals.

===Physical appearance===
Janice's outfit changes from time-to-time, but is usually seen wearing tank tops, jean jackets and pants, boots or sandals,and jewelry of some kind. Janice also has tan skin and blonde hair, while also having pink/red lipstick and purple/blue eyeshadow. Janice is also one of the few Muppets to have a visual uvula that dangles from the back of her throat.

===Creation and performance===
Janice was originally performed by [[Fran Brill]] in 1975 and in the first set of Muppet Meeting Films. [[W:c:muppet:Eren Ozker|Eren Ozker]] performed Janice in the first season of ''The Muppet Show''. [[w:c:muppet:Richard Hunt|Richard Hunt]] took over the character in season two and gave Janice her familiar Valley girl voice and attitude.

Michael Frith's original sketch of the character indicates that she was intended to be a male character, a take-off on Mick Jagger's emaciated frame. Her name is probably a reference to Janis Joplin. However, in her final form, as built by Bonnie Erickson, she bears very little resemblance to either Jagger or Joplin.
