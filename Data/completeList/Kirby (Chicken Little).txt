==Background==
Kirby is a small alien with three eyes. Ever since Chicken Little, Abby, Runt, and Fish first encounter him, he was frightened at first. When the group catches up with Kirby, the aliens notice that they started planning on an invasion after thinking Kirby is being kidnapped by Earthlings. When an alien invasion arrives at Oakey Oaks, Kirby is the only survivor on Earth who does not feel frightened because it is revealed that his parents are looking for him. Chicken Little and his father reunited him with his parents, to which his mother happily reunites with him, just as she stops her husband Melvin from destroying the two, believing the two are threatening to him to which Melvin's wife denies that they are not hurting him. 

==Role in the film==

Kirby first appears in an alien crib, floating while he is sleeping, but his eyes, arms, and legs were not visible, but when he wakes up, his eye sticks out and frightened [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]] and his best friends. After Chicken Little escapes from the spaceship, Kirby makes his decisions by following them, at the city, [[Runt of the Litter|Runt]] screamed while he thinks he was attacked by Kirby holding on his head, so Chicken Little and his others help look for his family. While during the war of the world, Kirby finds his family inside of a spaceship.

Later when Chicken Little and Buck Cluck are abducted by aliens, Kirby's father [[Melvin]] was not understanding when he thought Chicken Little and his father [[Buck Cluck]] had violated the intergalactic law 90210, so he was about to kill them with all his powerful strong machine weapons, but Kirby convinces everything to his father and with his mother [[Tina]] as well. They finally release them and it was misunderstanding, so things begin to be much better again and Kirby and his family leave Earth.

Kirby appears again during the credits dancing to [[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]].

==Trivia==
*Kirby is the only ''Chicken Little'' character to be voiced by juvenile actors. His vocal sounds were performed by three children.
*Oddly, Kirby remains unnamed in the film's book adaptations. 
*He might be named after Kirby from the titular video game franchise of the same name.
