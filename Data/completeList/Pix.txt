He is designed to take bad pictures of people. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her "cats".

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Pix is a blue experiment that looks like a cross between a mouse and a camera. He has light green patches around his black eyes, a light blue patch running down from his chin to his stomach, and light blue insides of his ears. Most unusually, he has a camera lens-like nose, two arms with three legs similar to a tripod.

===Powers and abilities===
True to his name, Pix can take pictures of people through a camera lens in his nose, as well as develop them like a Polaroid, with the pictures coming out of his mouth. However, the people in the photos actually look more horrifying than in real life.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 214 was the 214th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to take pictures of people in which they look awful. 214 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s yard, 214's pod being one of them.

At an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 214's pod for an apricot and washed it, activating the experiment. However, as 214 was not a very evil or destructive experiment, he was able to live a peaceful life with her, due to the latter seeing the former as a mere stray cat who needed a home.

When [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] discovered that Mrs. Hasagawa kept several experiments as pets, they thought they were a danger to her and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], decided to capture them all. While Pleakley was backing away from [[Manners|Experiment 358]], he bumped into 214, who then proceeded to take his picture. 214 then stuck out his tongue, revealing the developed photo. Pleakley was at first surprised that he looked bad in the picture, with cracked skin and a bloodshot eye, but Jumba then explained that 214 was designed to take bad pictures of people. Stitch then slammed a container over 214, capturing him.

214 and the other experiments were about to be taken away, but were returned to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. 214 was then named Pix.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Pix, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Pix participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did. However, it is presumed that he wouldn't have been able to be very effective, due to the fact that his powers are deemed useless.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. 

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Pix made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Frenchfry]], [[Squeak]], [[Tickle-Tummy]], and [[Houdini]] after [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] kicked them out for being considered useless. It is shown that Pix can use his abilities to distort his photos like a funhouse mirror. He made a second appearance, along with [[Boomer (Lilo & Stitch)|Boomer]], [[Slushy]], [[Blowhard]], [[Kixx]], and [[Slugger]], when [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and [[Stitch]] visited [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

==Trivia==
*In his initial appearance, Pix has light reflections in his eyes as typical of most experiments, although they only appeared when he was up close. By default, Pix's eyes are devoid of any detail.
*Pix was activated off-screen.
*Pix, [[Shrink]], and [[Thresher]] are the only known tripedal experiments.
*In one episode of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, Pix was kicked out by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] for being considered useless. Ironically, in another episode, Pix was actually seen battling [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and company.
