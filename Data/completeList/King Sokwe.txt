He makes his debut in the episode, "[[The Lost Gorillas]]".



== Role in the Series ==
King Sokwe sends his two sons, [[Majinuni and Hafifu|Majinuni&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hafifu]] out to the [[Pride Lands]], to deliver a message to King [[Simba]] as to whether or not he still agrees to a peace treaty between them. However, they forget his message, and the [[Lion Guard]] have to escort them home.

When they arrive back home in Theluji Mountains, Sokwe is seemingly furious with his children for forgetting the message, forgetting their way home from the Pride Lands and for needing the Lion Guard's help in getting back home. He asks his children if they know what it means in a stern voice, and they respond that they do. With a look of austerity, King Sokwe turns around and grabs two small piles of snow with each hand. He turns to his children, exclaims 'Kuishi Ni Kucheka' and dumps each mound of snow on their heads, laughing. Hafifu and Majinuni are relieved, and start to laugh with him.

King Sokwe explains to them that [[Kion]] has told him how he was saved by them, and that he is proud of them both. He goes on to say that they are true gorilla princes. Kion then reminds him that they still need to give a message to his father, and King Sokwe laughs. He notices that [[Bunga]] has a souvenir, a snowball. Kion asks if it's going to be a problem, and King Sokwe states that it isn't. In fact, he claims it to be 'perfect'.

When Kion arrives home, he explains what happened to his father. He hesitates to give him the message at first but, when he does, Bunga throws the snowball onto Simba's head. Simba begins to laugh, stating that nobody delivers a peace message quite like King Sokwe.
