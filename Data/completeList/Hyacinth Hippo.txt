}}'''Hyacinth Hippo''' is a character from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1940]] movie ''[[Fantasia]]''. She is a hippopotamus who appears in the segment ''[[Dance of the Hours]]''. She represents the hours of noon day.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
Hyacinth Hippo is the lead of the dancers of the daytime and symbolizes Laura Adorno of the opera. This is deduced by the fact that she is wooed by [[Ben Ali Gator]] (who symbolizes Enzo Grimaldo) and by her deep sleep, as in the opera Laura also is sent into a deep sleep.

===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===
She makes a couple of cameo appearances in the film. Her only line is "Oh, excuse me," when she passed [[Eddie Valiant]]. When she sat on a bench to have lunch, it broke due to her sheer mass, sending a person already sitting on it flying up into the atmosphere, but several people helped her up. She, along with half of the ''Fantasia'' cast and [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], are on loan to Maroon Cartoons from Disney. She later has a cameo appearance during the final scene with other [[Toon]]s.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
She makes cameo appearances in the series. She had a few appearances specifically in the episode "[[Ladies' Night]]" where she acts as the club's temporary bouncer and whenever [[Mortimer Mouse]] arrives, she jumps on him, which is the episode's running gag.

===''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''===
Hyacinth and her hippo friends were part of [[Daisy Duck]]'s skating act in the segment "Bells on Ice".

===Cameos===
Hyacinth made a cameo in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode "[[Cartoon Cornered]]".

In ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', Hyacinth was seen sitting next to [[Lady]] and [[Tramp]] during the film's final scene as a silhouette in the theater.

A Hyacinth Hippo statue can be seen in the museum in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]] Season 3 episode, ''[[Louie's Eleven!]]'' where Louie plans to crash Glamour's party so the Three Caballeros can perform.

Hyacinth Hippo will make a cameo in an upcoming short of ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]''.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Hyacinth hippo.jpg|thumb|250px|Hyacinth Hippo at [[Walt Disney World]].]]Hyacinth Hippo appears in various parades as a walkaround character. This version of her is bright pink with red smooching lips and wears a silvery-blue tutu, a matching bow on her head, and light blue ballet slippers.

===[[Disneyland Resort]]===
Hyacinth's likeness can be seen at the [[Disneyland Hotel]]'s ''Fantasia'' shop.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
She made an appearance in the Christmas show, ''[[Twas the Night Before Christmas]]'' which was located in the [[Magic Kingdom]], but has recently been retired. Currently, a poster of Hyacinth can be seen in the Storybook Circus area, also in the Magic Kingdom.

A topiary was also created for use during the Flower and Garden Festival at [[Epcot]], while statues of her can be seen at the [[Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf]] course.

In the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] version of ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', Hyacinth can be seen during the bubble montage.

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===
Hyacinth's biggest role in the parks would have to be in Disneyland Paris' Toon Circus where she performed trapeze acts she was certainly the biggest star.

===[[Disney Cruise Line]]===
Hyacinth can be seen in the [[Disney Magic]] cruise ship's Magical Porthole.
