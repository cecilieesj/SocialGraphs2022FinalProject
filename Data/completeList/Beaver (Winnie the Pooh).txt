}}'''Beaver''' is a minor character from Disney ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]''.

==Role in the series==
Beaver lives in a dam near the Poohsticks Bridge in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]]. He is a relatively new character, introduced in the first season of ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]''. Beaver is often compared to [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] from ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' series, as they are both hard-working rodents and are quite similar in appearance and personality. However, while Gopher is a little bit short-tempered, Beaver is clearly more easygoing.

==Trivia==
*Work is the only thing Beaver does.
*He is very similar to [[Mr. Busy]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.
