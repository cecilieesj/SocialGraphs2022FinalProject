'''Filbrick Elmer Pines'''<ref name="Ep212">{{Cite episode|212}}</ref><ref name="FEP">{{Cite web |url=https://partners.disney.com/shmeb-you-unlocked/book-8|title=Shmeb You Unlocked: Book 8|accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}</ref> is a minor character in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''. He is the father of [[Stan Pines|Stan]], [[Ford Pines|Ford]], and Shermie Pines.

== Role in the series ==
In "[[Dreamscaperers/Gideon Rises|Dreamscaperers]]", Filbrick appears in Stan's memories. It was revealed that Filbrick forced a young Stan into boxing lessons, hoping it would help him build a stronger character. Though Stan believed it was done simply because his father disliked him, he later grew to appreciate it as it taught Stan how to stand up for himself.

In "[[A Tale of Two Stans]]", a flashback depicts Filbrick during Stan and Ford's childhood. When his sons are teenagers, Stan accidentally damages Ford's perpetual motion machine, destroying his twin's chances of getting admitted into West Coast Tech. After learning this, Filbrick angrily disowns Stan for ruining the family's chances for a better future. He throws Stan out of the house, telling him he could only return when he'd earned the fortune he costed them.
