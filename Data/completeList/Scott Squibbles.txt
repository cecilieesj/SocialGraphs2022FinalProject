He is a five-eyed jelly-like monster. A student at [[Monsters University (institution)|Monsters University]], he is a member of the [[Oozma Kappa]] fraternity. According to director Dan Scanlon, he is an "18-year-old college student who doesn’t know what he wants to be."<ref>[http://pixartimes.com/2013/02/12/new-monsters-university-characters-revealed-sean-hayes-and-charlie-day-join-cast/ New ‘Monsters University’ Characters Revealed, Sean Hayes and Charlie Day Join Cast]</ref>
==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Scott Squibbles gives new meaning to the term 'undeclared.' A sophomore whose dream of becoming a Scarer was squashed in his first year at Monsters University, 'Squishy' is a bit of a wide-eyed wanderer—small, sweet, naïve and quiet—who, not surprisingly, still lives with his doting mother. But with a little help from his Oozma Kappa brothers, Squishy begins to realize he’s more than just that shy monster in the corner.''<ref>[http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/monsters-university-character-posters/ New Character Posters – Meet the Monsters of Monsters University]</ref>

===Development===
According to Dan Scanlon, Squishy was created to show a student even smaller than Mike being able to be scary, to emphasize that scariness isn't "about your size, necessarily, or even the way you look...it was a thing you either had or you didn't. An intangible quality."<ref name="empire">[http://www.empireonline.com/features/monsters-university-newcomers-guide/p4 The Beginner's Guide To Monsters University's Newcomers - Scott “Squishy” Squibbles (Peter Sohn)]</ref> Squishy had to be a simple "unmolded ball of clay" that was easily overlooked, that "People shouldn’t be noticing him a lot. He should be boring-looking. He should actually be a bad design of a character, the worst background character that was never supposed to be seen in the foreground."<ref name="empire" />

In early versions, artists based him on simple gels and candies. His final appearance takes the texture and appearance of Mochi candy.<ref name="denofgeek">[http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/monsters-university/26234/the-inspirations-for-monsters-university%E2%80%99s-characters The inspirations for Monsters University’s characters]</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters University]]''===
Squishy is constantly overlooked and often moves without being noticed by anyone. Because of this, his interventions keep freaking out [[Mike Wazowski]], who forgets his presence all the time. He soon learns to use this to his advantage: in the "Avoid the Parent" leg of the [[Scare Games]], he gets the OK flag unnoticed and brings victory to his team, and he catches a good score in the final "Simulate Scare" event by mysteriously changing position, freaking out the child dummy.

At the [[Roar Omega Roar|ROR]] party, Squishy discovers himself a more wild personality, dancing like crazy with the [[Python Nu Kappa]] sisters.

During the end credits of the film, Scott was given a card indicating he now is a Scarer at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]], using the name Scott "Scary" Squibbles.

===''[[Party Central]]''===
Squishy re-appeared in the short film ''Party Central'' along with the rest of the Oozma Kappa crew.
