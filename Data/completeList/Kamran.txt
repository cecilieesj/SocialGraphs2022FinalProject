==Background==
Kamran is born to a human man, and [[Najma]], a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]]. Najma seeks to find a way to return back to her home dimension, alongside her fellow group, the Clandestines, consisting of Najma, [[Fariha]], [[Aadam]], and [[Saleem]], all of whom, Kamran becomes familiar with. Najma and Kamran move around frequently, for the first seventeen years of his life. When the Clandestines senses the presence of Noor in [[New Jersey]], within [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]], Kamran and his mother relocate there, in hopes that they can use Kamala and the [[bangle]] she possesses, to assist them in opening the gateway to the Noor Dimension.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
After [[Najma]] closed the Veil of Noor which lead to the [[Noor Dimension]], some fiber of its energy came through, and found its way into Kamran, granting him powers. His powers appear in the form of a blue crystalline energy.

*'''Noor Manipulation''': As a [[Djinn]]-Human hybrid, Kamran gained the ability to control the Noor present within himself. While all Djinn possess this ability, their powers are subdued, outside of the Noor Dimension. Kamran's mixed ancestry allows him to use Noor to its full potential, on Earth.
**'''Constructs Creation''': The ability to project energy constructs. When Kamran first gained his powers, he involuntarily created a construct, which surrounded his hand. When a drone flown by from [[Damage Control]] arrived to spy on his whereabouts, Kamran was able to fire an offensive construct towards it.
***'''Light Generation''': Kamran's powers emit a purple light, while being used. The light generated, is dependent on the size of the construct that he produces.
**'''Noor Burst''': The ability to release a surge of energy from ones self. During his confrontation with Damage Control, Kamran released a burst of energy that emitted from his body, that pushed those in close proximity, further back.

====Abilities====
*'''Combatant''': Kamran is show to be capable of maintaining a physical fight. He fought against Saleem, and used a chained weapon, to assist him in his brawl, which he kept control over.
*'''Athelticism''': Kamran has displayed acrobatic feats with his body. At Zoe Zimmer's party, he flipped into the pool from a high distance, and while he was detained at the D.O.D.C. Supermax Prison, he was able to take ahold of one of the guards via his legs, while he was handcuffed, and his arms were inert.

====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Kamran enrolls in Coles Academy High School. While walking down the hallway, he bumps into a girl, and she apologizes, though Kamran tells her not to worry. He passes by [[Zoe Zimmer]], who is discussing with her fellow classmates an event in which she was rescued by a superhero at AvengerCon, and invites him to a party, she's hosting on Friday. Kamran accepts the offer and thanks her.

Kamran arrives, and gets the attention of those attending, when he flips from a roof, into Zoe's back pool. He walks towards [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], who is standing on his shirt, and she apologizes. [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] comments how he must've hurt himself, but Kamran adds he didn't feel a thing, and introduces himself. The crowd are suddenly alerted by the incoming arrival of the police, following the sound of sirens, and the partygoers begin to scatter. In the midst of the panic, Kamran offers to drive some of them away, in his uncle's car. Kamala, Bruno, [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]], [[Paul (Ms. Marvel)|Paul]], and [[Miguel]] all get in, and Kamala sits next to him. He offers to let her drive it sometime, but when Bruno comments she failed her test, Kamran tries comforting her by sharing that he failed his test the first time too. Swet Shop Boys begins playing on the stereo, and he Kamala bond over their similar taste in music, and proceed to discuss Bollywood movies. They eventually arrive at Circle Q, where he drops everyone off, and he gives Kamala his phone, in case she ever wants to participate in any driving lessons for the future.

Kamala accepts Kamran's offer, and the pair ride off after school. Then stop at a restaurant, to continue their discussion regarding Bollywood movies, and actor, Shah Rukh Khan, when the conversation moves onto their mothers. Kamala refers to hers as "ammi", before quickly correcting herself to "mom", but Kamran assures her that she doesn't need to translate for him. They talk about how his mother has a crush on [[Kingo]], which he expresses his concern over, and admits he doesn't understand half his mothers interests. Kamala notes the close bond they share, and Kamran reveals that he and his mother moved around together a lot. Kamala suddenly covers her face with a menu, and reveals the she just saw her brother and his fiancee, and fears his reaction, in seeing the two together. He assures her they'll probably leave soon, but [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] arrives inside and spots the two of them together. Kamala claims he is their cousin, which Kamran plays along with, pretending to be an Uncle Chouhury's nephew. Aamir questions his British accent, and Kamran states he was just playing a part, as he's a fan of ''The Great British Bake Off''. Aamir's fiancee, Tyesha greets him, though looks unconvinced at their claims, and tries to scurry off Aamir elsewhere. Aamir believes he remembers Kamran from a childhood memory, and the group say their goodbyes.

When Kamala is targeted by the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]], Kamran drives to her whereabouts, and offers an escape. They head off, and Kamran introduces Kamala, to his mother, [[Najma]], who is sitting in the back.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Clandestines.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
They drive to [[Aadam]]'s house, where Najma explains her history with Kamala's great-grandmother, Aisha. Kamala makes a comment on their youthful looks, considering Najma's story took place in the 1940s, and [[Saleem]] points out Kamran is only seventeen. Kamala shares relief and Najma agrees with Kamran, after he previously mentioned to her, that Kamala was adorable. Kamran denies he made the statement, and the other [[Clandestines]] begin to tease him, over his apparent crush.

When Kamala learns that the Clandestines need her to act as the key in helping them return back to the [[Noor Dimension]], she texts Kamran to inform him that while she wants to help, it could be dangerous. He assures her that they'll figure it out and to focus on her brother’s wedding. Najma later gets a hold of Kamran's phone, and finds his texts with Kamala. Najma questions why he didn't tell her, and Kamran explains to his mother that Kamala simply needs more time, as it may be dangerous. Najma however, was already aware of the risk, to Kamran's surprise, and she decides she must force Kamala into helping them.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Kamran and Najma.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Kamran arrives at the wedding venue, to warn Kamala that the Clandestines are on their way, and willing to kill everyone. When they arrive, Kamala pulls the fire alarm, forcing the guests to exit, and Kamran pleads with his mother to stop, but she cautions him to keep out of her way. A clash ensues between Kamala and the Clandestines, and Bruno, whom Kamran incorrectly refers to as "Brian" is injured. Saleem walks in his direction, but Bruno blocks him, and the pair battle, as Kamran fights with his chained weapon, against Saleem's whip. Saleem gets the better of Kamran and the pair fall through the glass railing, onto the ground, where Kamran is left unconscious. When he comes to, Damage Control sweep the building, and arrest Kamran, alongside his family. 

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x04 - Seeing Red - Photography - Kamran Handcuffed.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The Clandestines are taken into the D.O.D.C. Supermax Prison. They are handcuffed to a railing and follow the guards ahead, with Kamran at the forefront. Kamran shoots a look at one of them, and he electrocutes Kamran with a prod. Najma swears at him, and the guard in turn punches her in the face. Kamran, in response, swings his legs up and wraps them around the guards neck, choking him out, and another guard fires an energy pulse, in his direction, which briefly knocks him out. Najma breaks free from her restrains, and undoes Kamran's shackles, causing him to fall to the ground. He quickly comes to, and is supported by Saleem, as they look for an exit. Najma calls for them to leave Kamran behind, following his betrayal, and he watches, as they move forward without him. 

Kamran finds an escape from the prison without his family by side. He changes out of his issued uniforms, and finds himself in an alleyway, when he is struck by a surge of light. His eyes begin to glow blue, and he collapses to the ground, while his fist begins to glow.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x05 - Time and Again - Kamran Target.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
With nowhere else to turn, Kamran heads to Circle Q, to meet Bruno, whom he incorrectly refers to "Brian" again. Kamran is lead to his room, and tries to awkwardly make small talk by commenting on a poster with a science joke, Bruno has. He observes another poster of Nicola Tesla, and questions if he's into cars too, and Bruno sarcastically comments on the two never having hung out before. Kamran asks to restart with him and reintroduces himself, holding out his hand. Bruno gives his name, much to Kamran's embarrassment, as he'd been referring to him as "Brian" since they met, and apologizes. Bruno offers him a place, to sleep, so they can figure what their next move is, but Kamran is insistent on staying, so Najma can locate him. Kamran questions why Najma would return as she abandoned him. Bruno shares that his parents are absentees and he won't leave Kamran to fend for himself against Damage Control. A drone hovers outside the window and Kamran warns Bruno he's been followed. He holds out his arms, and emits a blast from his hand, which fires against the drone. In response, the drone fires a missile into Circle Q, causing it to explode.
