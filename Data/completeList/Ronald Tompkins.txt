'''Ronald "Ron" Tompkins''' (a.k.a. '''Ron the Manager''') is the main antagonist of the [[2013]] [[Pixar]] TV special ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''===
Ron is the manager of the [[Sleep Well]] motel. He has an anxious personality, with a tendency to laugh nervously. He loves iguanas, as evidenced by his eBid username, iguanaluvr75, and the fact that he owns one. He steals toys and other objects from his customers using his pet iguana [[Mr. Jones]] to take them, and sells them on the Internet for money. When [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], [[Jessie]], [[Mr. Pricklepants]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], [[Rex]], and [[Trixie]] were captured, he also had several other toys in his possession. Ron was thrilled to get high winning bids for Woody and Jessie, and proceeded to pack them up for shipment. However, they both escaped, and Jessie exposed his scheme to [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] and her [[Mrs. Anderson|mother]], who became so furious at him that she threatened to call the police when she caught him with the toys in his cupboard, despite Ron objecting otherwise.

During the credits, two policemen arrived. Ron panicked and told them he wasn't the manager, and snuck out the back door to try to steal the patrol car, but failed when he crashed the car into the sign, causing it to land on the car roof. Ron bailed out of the car and ran, as an officer simply alerted the dispatch that they "got a runner."

===Deleted Scenes===
The team thought it was important to explain Ron's motivation to steal, but all scenes pertaining to this were finally cut. These would have revealed Ron was "raising money" to get a dream boat from Bob's Boatyard, his neighbor. The sales of Woody and Jessie finally bring him enough money, and he immediately goes on to order the boat. In an alternate ending, it is towed to Ron precisely as he is arrested. Upon seeing this, the driver freaks out and drives backwards in a hurry, and accidentally gets the boat smashed to pieces by a passing truck, much to Ron's dismay.<ref>[http://www.disneymoviesanywhere.com/discover/pixar-toy-story-terror-extras-deleted-scenes "Toy Story of Terror: Deleted Scenes" on Disney Movies Anywhere]</ref>

==Trivia==
*Ron is similar to [[Al McWhiggin]] from ''[[Toy Story 2]],'' in the manner that both stole toys to attempt to sell them.
*It was never revealed if Ron was arrested for stealing. Though it's most likely he would be, given to his guilt as he attempted to run away from the officers.
*Ron has a cup that reads: "Here Comes Trouble", hinting that he is the villain.
