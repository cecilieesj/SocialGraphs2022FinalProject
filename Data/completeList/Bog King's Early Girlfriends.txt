Griselda tries to set Bog up on a date with a purple female fly while he is trying to find the antidote to cure Dawn's obsession with him. She shyly waves at him and Bog frustratingly rejects her, not wanting to deal with anymore of his mother's fix ups, causing her to cry. In the mid-credits scene, Roland falls in love with her after getting sprayed with the love potion and she reciprocates the feelings by buzzing excitedly. The two emerge from the chasm, staring into each other's eyes. Roland’s minions express disgust at them, but he tells her to ignore them and affirms his "love" for her by telling her that she is beautiful to him. She sighs lovingly at having found the man of her dreams. The two share a passionate kiss and become a couple.
