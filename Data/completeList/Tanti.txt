[[File:Tanti.jpg|thumb]]'''Tanti''' is a young boy who appeared in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]].

He lives in the marketplace with his mother and sister. He also has a strong relationship with [[Jasmine]] as she's almost like a second mother to him. In the episode "[[Do the Rat Thing]]", she gives him, his mother and sister a watermelon when she was a rat.

Tanti had a much larger role in "[[The Ethereal]]". A wagon he and his mother were pulling fell over and Aladdin and his friends fixed it. Jasmine looked at a hankerchief saying it was very nice. Tanti said that he made it with his mother and Jasmine says that she would love to buy it and gives him a bag of coins. She later sacrifices her life to save him from a crashing building. When she's brought back to life, Tanti gives her a great big hug.
