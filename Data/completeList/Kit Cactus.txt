Kit Cactus is similar in appearance to [[Toby (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Toby]]. The difference is that Kit is a lighter shade of green, wears a black hat with a red band, and, as a bandit, has a rude attitude. He used his appearance to fool the townsfolk of [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] and frame Toby for the crimes he pulled off. But when Kit ended up running into Toby, [[Sheriff Callie|Callie]] and [[Deputy Peck|Peck]] tried a "spot the impostor" test to find out who the real Toby was. Finally, Toby performed the popcorn trick he had shown Peck earlier, proving he was the real Toby, and Callie arrested Kit.
