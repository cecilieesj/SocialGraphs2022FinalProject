'''Talluah''' is a minor antagonist in ''[[Teacher's Pet]]''. She is [[Crosby Strickler|Principal Strickler]]'s cat. She is one of the very few people that know Spot can talk and is [[Spot Helperman/Scott Leadready II|Scott Leadready II]]. When she is around Scott, she acts all hyper and hissy and tries to tell others he is a dog but they just cannot see the obvious.

==Personality==
When Strickler is around, she acts all sweet and playful, but when it comes to Scott, [[Leonard Helperman|Leonard]], and [[Pretty Boy]] she is evil and hyper. The most notable episodes that she talks are "[[Tallulahpalooza]]" and "[[Saving Mr. Jolly]]". She also knows that Scott is a dog and always tries to get people to notice as well. On most occasions, Tallulah has tried to eat Pretty Boy.
