==Trivia==
*He is the only villain of the TV-series to permanently die as well on-screen.
*NOS-4-A2 turning Ty Parsec into a Wirewolf is based on how Vampires, in particular Dracula, were tied to werewolf transformations due to Bram Stoker's novel depicting Dracula as being directly responsible for the existence of werewolf stories.
