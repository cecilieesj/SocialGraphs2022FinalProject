'''Hercules Panhellenios''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character. He is an Olympian and the protector of Greece.

This version of the mythological Hercules was created byÂ [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], Allen Bellman, and Charles Nicholas.

==Background==
===Powers and Abilities===
Hercules possesses the typical powers of an Olympian god, including superhuman strength, durability, speed, reflexes, stamina, and endurance. He is the strongest of the Olympians, being capable of feats such as lifting and hurling a giant sequoia tree, smashing rocks to powder,sealing an entire cliff around an opponent with his bare hands. His super-strong legs allow him to run at speeds of over 100 mph, and leap over a hundred feet into the air. He can withstand blows from Thor, and possesses a complete resistance to bullets.

Hercules is highly skilled in archery, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling and Pankration, and in combat occasionally wields an adamantine mace - stated and shown to be the equal of Thor's own mystical hammer [[Mjolnir]] - forged by the Greek god Hephaestus. As an Olympian, he is resistant to all earthly diseases, possesses a healing factor, immortality, and also has some immunity to magic. However, his strength can be taken by significant Olympian magic, such as that of Zeus.

==Appearances==
===''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''===
Besides Hercules' mythological history and being the protector of Greece, he is shown to have a history with [[Hulk]], always mispronounces Charon's name (which annoys Charon), and causes more problems than he can solve while sporting a big ego. It was stated that the last time Hulk was invited by Hercules, they ended up fighting a Chimera.

The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. travel to [[ancient Greece]] and team up with Hercules to stop Pluto from turning everyone on Earth to stone after he had stolen the Shield of Minerva.
