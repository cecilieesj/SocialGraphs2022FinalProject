Puerto Rico is a Carribean island located to the northeast of the Carribean sea and the south of Florida. Pre-colonization, it was inhabited by the native Taino people, but soon they were displaced by colonizers who lived there, as well as African slaves. Post 1968 it became a part of America after the Spanish American war. Since the 29th century, Puerto Rico underwent an industrial revolution and became a more developed country. Puerto Rico is Spanish for "rich port". Puerto Ricans often call the island ''Borinquén'', a derivation of ''Borikén'', its indigenous Taíno name, which means "Land of the Valiant Lord", and it is also known as the "the island of enchantment"
