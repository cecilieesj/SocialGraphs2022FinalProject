'''Ngendei''', the Earth-Balancer, is one of the Tiki Gods in the pre-show of [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
He has a very gloomy personality as despite his title of "Earth-Balancer", he just feels he's only hanging on for the ride and is the continual victim of [[Pele]]'s torments.

== Appearances ==

=== The Enchanted Tiki Room ===
Ngendei's tiki statue rocks on the Earth as a result of Pele's torments while speaking to guests in the Tiki Room's pre-show. When Pele begins her introduction, Ngendei explains that according to legends, Ngendei himself balances the Earth, but to his sadness, he is just hanging on to his life. After this, [[Tangaroa-Ru]] begins her introduction.

The sign next to Ngendei himself reads:
<poem>
''A legend comes from the tropic sea''
''It may be true for fantasy''
'''Tis said when Pele shakes the lands''
''Ngendei rocks and rolls upon his hands''
</poem>

=== [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai]] ===
In [[Tokyo Disneyland]] when the attraction was updated as Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai, a "Lost Dog" flyer with an image of [[Stitch]] missing, signed by [[Lilo]], was placed on Ngendei.

=== [[Trader Sam's]] ===
Pele, Ngendei, [[Koro]] and [[Rongo]] all decorate the bar-taps in these bars and have glowing eyes.
