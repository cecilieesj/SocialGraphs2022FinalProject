==Description==
Toshiaki is over-achieving and mega-competitive. He is 12-years old. He delights in beating Victor at his own game and like a power-hungry mad scientist, Toshiaki will stop at nothing to win the top prize in the school’s science fair—even if it means stealing Victor’s ideas to do it.

==Trivia==

*In the film, when Toshiaki revives his deceased pet turtle, Shelley, it mutates and grows to a horrific size. In this state, Shelley closely resembles popular Japanese [[wikipedia:Kaiju|Kaiju]] monster [[wikipedia:Gamera|Gamera]]. Additionally, the scene in which Shelley crushes a police car with its foot is a reference to the teaser trailer for the [[wikipedia:Godzilla (1998_film)|1998 ''Godzilla'' movie]], an American reboot of the popular [[wikipedia:Godzilla|Japanese ''Kaiju'' franchise]]. All of this is given further significance by the fact that Toshiaki is Japanese.
*Toshiaki can be interpreted as a dark twist on the various child characters of Godzilla and Gamera films from the late 60s and early 70s, who often had a fondness for monsters and a deeper understanding of them compared to the adults. Gamera himself was billed as the "Friend of All Children" and protected them from other kaiju, so Shelley turning on Toshiaki is a possible subversion of that relationship.
*Toshiaki is a 12-year old boy. He is younger than Nassor.
