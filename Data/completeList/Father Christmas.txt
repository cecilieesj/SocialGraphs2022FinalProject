==Background==
Father Christmas was the gift-bearing figure in the World of [[Narnia]] who came to good creatures in Narnia the night before Christmas. It is unknown where he lived. However, similar to Earth's Father Christmas, he could have lived in the far north.

During the Long Winter, Christmas never came, and the [[Jadis the White Witch|White Witch]]'s power kept Father Christmas out of Narnia. The first appearance of Father Christmas in 100 years was the first definite sign that [[Aslan]] was on the move and the power of the Long Winter was dissolving. Father Christmas wore a red robe with a hood and fur lining. He drove a sledge with brown reindeer and sported a white beard, round stomach, and had a cheery presence.

===List of gifts he gave===
*Mrs. Beaver: A new sewing machine and a completed dam with a sluice-gate.
*[[Peter Pevensie]] - His sword, Rhindon, and a shield.
*[[Susan Pevensie]] - [[Susan's Bow]] and arrows, and [[Susan's Horn|Susan's horn]].
*[[Lucy Pevensie]] - A [[Lucy's Cordial|magical healing cordial]] and a small dagger.
*A group of Talking Beasts - A warm meal of delicious food.

==Role in the film==
As the Pevensies and the beavers hide upon hearing a sleigh of reindeer being pulled, the Pevensies thought it was the Jadis, to which it is found out that it is actually Father Christmas. Upon approaching Father Christmas, he happily gives the Pevensies their gifts, explaining to them that the gifts he gave them are not toys but rather special gifts to help them on their adventures in Narnia. As the Pevensies thank him for their gifts, Father Christmas then leaves by boarding his sleigh of reindeer as it is found out that the winter has come to an end across Narnia just as he bids the Pevensies a farewell.

==Video game appearances==
===[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)|''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (video game)]]===
Despite not appearing in the [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)|console versions of the video game adaptation of the film]], the Pevensies receive gifts from Father Christmas whenever the player finishes the Frozen Lake level as revealed via in-game message upon completion for the first time, just like in the film and the original story.

He does appear briefly throughout the game where he gives the Pevensies gifts in the handheld versions of the game, just like he did in the film in "Chapter 10: Crossing the Frozen Lake".
