A '''Telmarine''' was any inhabitant of the Calormene colony, Telmar, in the [[Narnia|Narnian World]]. In Disney media, Telmarines were featured in the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Walden Media]] adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]''.

==Background==
The name "Telmarine" can also be used to describe anything from, like, or relating to Telmar, its people, or its culture. In addition to that, the term "'''Telmarine-Narnian'''" also came about to refer to the Telmarine-native humans occupying the Kingdom of Narnia after the Telmarine Conquest in Narnian-year 1998.

===Origins===
The Telmarines are based on the characters of the same name from C.S. Lewis' fantasy novel, ''Prince Caspian'', the second published entry of the ''Narnia'' book series where they were inhabitants from a faraway kingdom known as "Telmar" before they invaded the Narnian world.

Yet in the Disney/Walden Media adaptation of ''Prince Caspian'', the Telmarine soldiers are depicted to have Mediterranean influences - specifically inserted with [[Italy|Italian]] or [[Spain|Spanish]] accents, hinting that they are inspired by historical Spanish conquistadors, judging by the attire they wear.

==Role in the film==
The Telmarines that conquered Narnia were actually humans from Earth. On Earth, a group of pirates found an island with a cave that had an entrance to Narnian world. The pirates found the land of Telmar uninhabited, the original colony of Calormenes having been turned into dumb beasts by [[Aslan]] for their behavior and destroyed each other. The Telmarines prospered for years until a famine struck their land. Caspian the Conqueror (Caspian I) was sent from Telmar to seek out new lands for his king. Upon arriving in the small northern country of [[Narnia]], he found few men to fight. He found animals, talking beasts, and trees that could move and talk. After taking over the land, the Telmarines drove most of the animals into hiding as the men were scared of them, believing they were demons in animal form.

The free peoples of Narnia remained in hiding for 305 years. Around that time, [[Caspian X]], the son of the usurped Caspian the ninth, was forced to flee his home in his Uncle [[Miraz]]'s castle due to his Aunt, Queen Pruniprismia, giving birth to a son, making Caspian a hindrance to his uncle. He made an alliance with the beasts of Narnia, saying they would win back everything that was rightfully theirs. Also, the Pevensie children returned to Narnia and helped Caspian defeat his uncle in combat, freeing Narnia to once more be happy and free. Caspian was crowned king of Narnia after the defeat of his uncle's army.

After the fall of their dynasty, messengers were sent to all the Telamrines in Narnia, saying they could choose to stay or leave for a new home. A number of Telmarines stayed in Narnia while the rest chose to leave for Earth through a door that [[Aslan]] made for them.

==Video game appearances==
