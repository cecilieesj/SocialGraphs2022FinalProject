'''Triton''' is a minor character from the Disney animated series ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. He is the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]]. 

==Personality==
Triton is a somewhat hyperactive and energetic youth who has a deep admiration for his cousin Hercules and he takes greater pride in being his cousin than in being a God. When he was seemingly rejected by Hercules he showed great pain, showing how much he holds his cousin in regard. He is also brave and determined but tends to get in over his head.

==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==
In "[[Hercules and the Son of Poseidon]]", Triton begs his father [[Poseidon]] to allow him to go to [[Prometheus Academy]] with his cousin [[Hercules]]. Triton acts like Hercules did on his first day of school (he stands up to [[Adonis]]). Hercules is feeling embarrassed by his cousin and accidentally hurts his feelings. To get revenge on Hercules, Triton steals his dad's trident and uses it to humiliate Hercules and impress kids at school. While doing this he accidentally unleashes a sea serpent, and it attacks the school. Hercules and Triton work together to stop the serpent, and Poseidon and his wife Amphitrite arrive to get the trident back. Poseidon wants to punish his son for stealing from him and almost letting a monster destroy the school, but [[Amphitrite]] says that people make mistakes and that's how we learn from it, thus both boys are off the hook.
