'''Jin Lee''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s  [[2022]] animated feature film ''[[Turning Red]]''. He is [[Mei Lee|Mei]]'s soft-but-stoic father, who is aware of his daughter's weird abilities. 

==Background==
===Personality===
Jin is a quiet man, a steady presence in his family. He is a hard worker who wishes only for a simple life of small pleasures: cooking for his family, gardening, and sneaking the occasional Timbit. He is a necessary balance to Ming, his strong-willed wife, as he is there to keep her grounded. Though he is not as close to their daughter Meilin as Ming is, he nonetheless loves Mei very much. He can switch between offering words of wisdom and funny dad jokes.
When Mei's powers activate, Jin's quiet life is thrown into chaos. While Ming is very averse to Mei's ancestral gift, Jin is a bit more patient with the strange phenomenon and tries his best to help his daughter through it.

Having witnessed his wife go through the Panda transformation before, Jin somewhat agreed with his wife and relatives that Mei should go through the sealing ritual. But after seeing footage of Mei with her friends, where Mei was able to be herself thanks to the panda transformation giving her the confidence to do so, Jin understood and remembered that Mei was growing up and becoming her own person, something his wife had forgotten, and encouraged Mei to choose for herself what she wanted while giving her some needed advice and wisdom regarding how people change as they grow, gaining new sides of themselves, and that some sides can be messy. But the point of growing up wasn't to get rid of those messy sides by pushing it away, but to make room for them and learn to live with them, so that one can find peace within themselves. He tells her that she can erase the footage if she wants, but seeing that side of her (her panda form) makes him laugh.

===Physical Appearance===
Jin is an average height, adult, Asian man with light skin, and brown eyes. He also wears glasses, just like his daughter, [[Mei Lee|Mei]]. He is typically seen in a light collared shirt and jeans. When cooking, he adopts a blue and red apron.

==Trivia==
*He is secretly a 4★Town fan, as shown when he dances to their songs in the basement during the post-credits scene.
*Jin is represented by bland beige colors. At first glance, this would represent his lack of action or control, as his wife is more dominant, as well as his somewhat conservative demeanor. However, this also references his safe and comforting side, as he finally manages to tell Mei exactly what she needs to hear when she finally decides to keep the panda power.
*Jin shares the same surname as his voice actor, Orion Lee.
