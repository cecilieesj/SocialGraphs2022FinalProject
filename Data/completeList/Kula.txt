'''Kula''' is a cape buffalo who appeared in ''[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures]].''

== Appearance ==
Kula is a powerfully built animal with a brown pelt and large horns.

== Information ==
Kula first appears when Simba tries to play a prank on him. Kula is very serious and tells Simba to stop being so foolish. The buffalo does, however, get scared by Simba, thanks to Nala's idea for Simba to run up to the buffalo with mud and leaves over his face.
