'''Howard the Duck''' is an anthropomorphic talking duck who originated from [[Marvel Comics]].

Howard the Duck was created by {{WikipediaLink|Steve Gerber}} and {{WikipediaLink|Val Mayerik}}.

== History ==

=== Comics ===
Howard the Duck was an inhabitant of an alternate Earth known as Duck-world in-which the dominant species was that of humanoid ducks. His life would be suddenly changed when he was abducted by the demon ''Thog the Nether-Spawn'' and dropped into the everglades of [[Florida]].

Stuck on Earth, Howard became friends with and allies to [[Man-Thing]], the protector of the well of realities which hold the gateway to the multiverse. Attempting to get home, Howard would be tagged along for several misadventures in-which he'd fight demons, aliens and super-villains. He would become considered something of a superhero thanks to his proficiency in the martial-art of ''quack-fu''.

Being stuck on Earth he'd go through profound existentialism and become a private-investigator. He'd also begin dating a human model named Beverly Switzler and go on continued adventures with Man-Thing.

==Appearances==

=== Marvel Cinematic Universe ===

====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''====

====''[[What If...?]]''====
Howard the Duck first appears in the episode ''[[What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?]]'', where he is part of the Tivan Collection, like in the Sacred Timeline. While T'Challa tries to search for the Embers of Genesis in the collection, he runs into Howard who seems to have an in-depth knowledge about the collection's layout, leading to T'Challa freeing him and asking Howard to give him the tour. Howard, however, gets distracted by a bar and is more content to spend his time drinking, as T'Challa continues searching.

In the episode ''[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]'', Howard comes to Earth to join Thor's party. Jane expresses her intent on making first contact with Thor, to which Darcy Lewis replies how half the Vegas strip has already done so, and suggests making first contact with Howard, calling him a "loser". Howard retorts how Darcy's comment is big talk coming from a brunette. As Thor & Jane bond, Howard & Darcy  decide to get some nachos together, before having a Vegas wedding that evening. Later, when [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] drop Jane & Darcy back in Vegas, after Thor's confrontation with [[Captain Marvel]], Howard quips how Darcy (or as he calls her, "Mrs. The Duck") has come waddling back to him. Darcy is not in the mood to argue with him at that time, though.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!]]''===
Howard the Duck can be seen in the background as part of The Collector's collection during the pre-show, before entering the Collector's office. Howard is fairly well represented in merchandise for the attraction despite only having briefly appeared.

==Trivia==
*In early comics, Howard was initially depicted as not wearing pants. Due to this, he greatly resembled [[Donald Duck]]. Ironically, when Howard was launched, his resemblance to Donald caused Disney to file a lawsuit against Marvel for copyright infringement until Howard was given a redesign depicting him wearing pants in the comics as part of the settlement, although this was before Disney purchased Marvel.
*Howard the Duck is notable as being one of the few characters to be used by both Marvel and [[Lucasfilm]] prior to both companies being bought by Disney.
*In the film ''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]'', Howard is parodied as ''[[Howard the Truck]]''.
*In August 2014, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn]] said, "It's possible Howard could reappear as more of a character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But if people think that’s going to lead to a Howard the Duck movie, that’s probably not going to happen in the next four years. Who knows after that?".
*The episode ''[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]'' is the first time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that Howard is referred to by name.
*Howard also starred in his own newspaper strip (that even ended up on TV).
*Howard's famous run for president began in the letters pages of his comic.
*Howard's early stories contained some not-so-subtle drug references.
*Kiss's debut in comics was in Howard the Duck #12.
*Disney was involved with 'Howard' even before it bought Marvel.
*He hasn't been just a duck.
*Howard led to one of Marvel's most famous creator-owned disputes.
*Steve Gerber created talking duck characters for other companies too.
