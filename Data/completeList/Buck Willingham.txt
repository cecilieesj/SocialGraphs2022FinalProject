== Role in the film ==
Buck was telling the audience to see how Larry made the basket, and he was surprised to see that [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]] did so.

The new coach, [[Arthur Chaney]], didn't allow Larry to showboat like [[Coach Barker|Joe Barker]] did, and soon benched him, which made Buck upset. He wanted to know why Arthur was doing this, who told him that Larry was playing like a one-man team, with Buck replying that he was the team. Not being able to take criticism, he told Larry that they were leaving and forced him to leave the Timberwolves and moved the entire family to Spokane just so Larry could play for the Warriors. He was upset that they lost the championship.
