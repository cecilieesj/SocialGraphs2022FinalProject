The '''Prison Dog''' is a character from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', originating in the original theme park attractions in which he is seen holding keys in his mouth near some imprisoned pirates, who attempt to lure the animal closer to no apparent avail.

==History==

===Background===

====[[Disney Parks]]====
The Prison Dog was a domesticated dog which was found in the Castillo del Morro fortress of [[Isla Tesoro]]. The dog was left with the keys to the cells in the fortress prison. When the island was raided by the [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|crew]] of the [[Wicked Wench]], the fortress was one of the buildings set on fire with its piratical prisoners desperately attempting to lure the dog to their cell to escape.

====Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)====
In the films, the dog was a prison dog in the [[Fort Charles]] prison of [[Port Royal]] in [[Jamaica]]. It would come to be dog-napped by [[Pintel]] and [[Ragetti]] before it was abandoned on Isla de [[Pelegostos]]. Later on, it would come into the ownership of Captain [[Edward Teague]], being used to hold the keys for the [[Pirata Codex|Pirate's Code]].

===Development History===
Because the films were based on the original Disney Parks attraction, the scene is recreated in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', and the dog makes further appearances in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' due to the dog being a popular character in the original attraction.

==Appearances==

===Oceaneer Lab===
Artwork of the dog by [[Marc Davis]] is hung in the [[RV Oceaneer Lab]] as part of [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]]'s collection.

===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===
In each version of the attraction, the dog is seen near three pirates attempting to get his attention to free them.

Due to the success of the attraction at [[Disneyland]], the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]] where it still features the prison scene still with the dog.

===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure|Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===
The scene where guests pass through the caverns scene with three pirates and the prison dog was redesigned where the dog and the prisoners appear, but are shown as dead skeletons. The whistling audio from the original attraction plays during this vignette.

==Film appearances==

====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''====
The prison dog is the keeper of the keys to the jail in [[Port Royal]], he carries the keys in his mouth, the prisoners vainly trying to get the keys.

After the raid on the town under attack by the ''Black Pearl'', Jack tries to get the keys from the dog and almost does, but when other pirates come into the jail, he gets scared and runs off.

====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''====
The dog appears again in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' with Pintel and Ragetti after they have escaped prison and are headed for Pelegosto to search for the [[Black Pearl]]. He was named "Poochie" by Pintel until he was left on Pelegosto. Later, he was chased by cannibals. In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that the dog becomes the chief of the Pelegosto tribe.

====''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''====
In ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', the dog is the keeper of the Pirata Codex keys on [[Shipwreck Cove|Shipwreck Island]]. Captain Teague explains the dog's presence by saying, "Sea turtles, mate," a reference to Jack Sparrow's tale of his own escape from being marooned.

==Other Appearances==

===Printed Materials===

====The Price of Freedom====
In this movie-continuity book, the dog was the pet of Captain Teague long before the events of the first film when Jack Sparrow was a teenager. Jack had the duty of feeding the dog, in doing so giving the dog a taste for rum. When Jack's friend Christophe-Julien de Rapièr was accused of going rogue from the brethren, Jack and his ally Esmeralda stole the dog's keys to free him and escape Shipwreck Island.

====The Ghost Gallery====
In the Ghost Gallery storyline created to explain the backstory of [[the Haunted Mansion]], the prison dog was mentioned as part of the unofficial history. In this story, the prison dog was the ancestor of the [[Hellhound]] in the Haunted Mansion which was the pet of [[Master Gracey]] which itself was the grandfather of the [[Caretaker]]'s Dog. The prison dog was also explained to be the ancestor of the ''Fort [[Mark Twain|Sam Clemens]]'' scene of [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island|Tom Sawyer's Island]], and the dog [[Rover (Carousel of Progress)|Rover]] from [[Carousel of Progress]].

===Video Games===

====''[[Aladdin (video game)|Aladdin]]''====
The dog makes cameo as a background character in the "Sultan's Dungeon" level.

====[[Disney Crossy Road]]====
The dog is a playable character within this mobile-game.

====[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]====
The dog appears in the dungeons of Puerto Dorado (here a pirate haven frequented by [[Blackbeard]]) where starving prisoners try to pry its key from its jaw. The player tosses food to the prisoners before their guide [[Black Barty]] makes a comment about having run afoul of the dog before and how it would never give up its keys.

====Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life====
The dog first appears in this game, keeping the keys for the jail-cell that Jack Sparrow is kept in. The dog can also be purchased as a pet at the Pirate Emporium.

==Trivia==
*In ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' in one scene where Jack Sparrow is sent to prison, he says an allusion to the original ride saying that the "dog is never going to move".
