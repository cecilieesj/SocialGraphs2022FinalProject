==Background==
===Personality===
As [[Merlin]]'s arch-enemy, Morgana is an evil egocentric enchantress who is very powerful and desires nothing more than to defeat the famous wizard himself.

She lives in a fortress, guarded by imps and magical centaur statues. She also has hundreds of mirrors in her home because her favorite thing to do is admiring herself. She also seems to have problems with following directions in her spellbook.

===Physical appearance===
Morgana is a slender middle age woman, and has long, wavy, black hair with gray streaks. She has dark indigo eyes with lavender eyeshadow, and crimson lips. Morgana wears a dark violet robe with fluffy sleeve cuffs. She has red high heels and sometimes wears a matching long red scarf. Around her neck, Morgana wears a long pearl necklace that connects with a medallion attached to her chest. The medallion features a picture of a female figure in the center.

==Trivia==
*Morgana is inspired by the actual arch-enemy of Merlin in the Arthurian legend, {{WikipediaLink|Morgan le Fay}}.
