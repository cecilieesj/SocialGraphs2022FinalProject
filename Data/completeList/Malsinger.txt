'''Malsinger''' is a minor character and villainous sorcerer from the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[If I Were You]]".

==Role in the series==
Malsinger is first seen creating fire in a chimney of [[Drekmore Castle]] to warm himself up.

To satisfy [[Duke Igthorn]]'s needs, he offers him the Star of Lucklomond; a powerful gem staff which enables a person to switch his mind with that of another, effectively switching bodies. As part of a demonstration, Duke Igthorn and [[Toadwart]] switch minds and bodies, and back again; much to Igthorn's delight, joy, and excitement.

Duke Igthorn pays Malsinger, who takes the precaution of checking whether the money coins are fake or not. Satisfied with results, Malsinger transforms himself into an eagle and flies out of Drekmore Castle, and is never seen throughout the rest of the series.
