'''Dick Tracy, Jr.''', formerly known as '''the Kid''', is both [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]]'s adopted son and sidekick at the end, and the minor protagonist from Disney/Touchstone's 1990 film ''[[Dick Tracy]]''.

==Personality==
Unlike most children, he behaves as a street kid and keeps his life a mystery from others (i.e. Dick Tracy and [[Tess Trueheart-Tracy|Tess Trueheart]]) He has spirit in him and whenever Dick goes on a mission, he secretly follows along by clinging to the back of a car he's in. Before he met Dick, he was a skilled thief and had an antagonistic view on adults.  He only steals so that [[Steve The Tramp]] would give him food and shelter, but when the latter hits him for not giving him enough loot and Dick rescues him, beating and arresting Steve in the process, he slowly develops into becoming a better person. He's capable of thinking on his feet when escaping or rescuing others and has shown to have a massive appetite for food due to his poor upbringing. After Dick rescues him, he develops the utmost respect for him, which causes him to try to follow Dick along in his adventures and rescuing him from a boiler room explosion. The respect goes as far as him naming himself after Dick, when he receives an honorary detective Badge and Certificate and is told to pick a name when he wants it permanent.  He also has a fondness for Tess even after he stated he didn't like women and even tries to encourage her relationship with Dick. 

==Role in the film==
Dick Tracy, Jr.'s origin story was essentially the same as in the comic strip, though the story line with Hank and Mary Steele was not addressed. He was a witness to the massacre at the Seventh Street Garage, but escaped without being caught. He saved Dick from a death-trap set by [[Big Boy Caprice]], [[Flattop Jones]], and [[Itchy]] and was made an honorary detective. He eventually revealed to Dick that he had chosen the name "Dick Tracy Jr." while Dick was in jail after being framed for murder.
