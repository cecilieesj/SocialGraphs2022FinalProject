Except she tends to mix up her spells, elixirs and wands, miss-fire magic, rush through spells and mix up magical words. Many times this leads to adventures for the people of Fairy-tale Forest. For example, when the Bears wanted to move a sofa from one room to another, she accidentally shrunk [[Goldie (Goldie & Bear)|Goldie]] and [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]] before shrinking the sofa. She also lost her wand once, making Goldie and Bear have to return it, and leading the latter to become a "furry godmother" when Bear gave himself wings.
