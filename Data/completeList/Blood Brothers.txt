[[File:Blood_Brothers.png|thumb|250px]]The '''Blood Brothers''' are a team of aliens that has taken on many of the Marvel superheroes. They were a alien wrestling team before becoming galactic criminals for hire. In ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'', they were hired by [[Red Skull]] to put a Gamma device that transformed most of the Avengers into Hulks. According to them, most of the people they hit do not come up.

In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', the Blood Brothers appear in the episode "Lyin' Eyes" where they were both voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. This version can join and split apart into one body and both of them can feel each other's pain. The Blood Brothers were first encountered in their single body as a bouncer for a crooked auction house on [[Knowhere]]. When [[Drax the Destroyer]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]] try to get into the auction house under aliases, the Blood Brothers checked the list which told them to terminate on sight. Upon splitting apart, the Blood Brothers fought Drax the Destroyer and Rocket Raccoon where the two of them took advantage of the Blood Brothers' weakness to defeat them. Upon Drax the Destroyer and Rocket Raccoon being defeated by Mantis and Ebony Maw of the Black Order in the sinus cavity of Knowhere, the two of them had the Blood Brothers drop Drax the Destroyer and Rocket Raccoon on another planet. Once there, the Blood Brothers threw Drax the Destroyer and Rocket Raccoon into the quicksand. Before leaving the planet, the Blood Brothers told them not to struggle in the quicksand.
