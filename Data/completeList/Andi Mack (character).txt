== Biography ==
Andi Mack was born by a teen mom, Bex, but was raised by her grandparents, Ham and Celia as their own after Bex left home. Andi was raised under the impression that Ham and Celia were her parents and that Bex was her cool older sister who traveled the world and would visit home every few years with different gifts from her adventures for Andi. Despite Bex being away so often, Andi loved her and looked up to her.

Bex admitted that she had made a lot of mistakes since Andi was born and showed Andi a picture of her and baby Andi in the hospital bed after birth. She revealed that she is not Andi's sister. She's her mother. This changed everything in Andi's world and now she has to adjust to accepting the fact that her sister is actually her mother. Along the way, Andi learns that sometimes the unexpected is what makes life great.

She also finds solace by tapping into her creativity in her backyard hideaway, the Andi Shack.

==== Shhh! ====
Since finding out the secret, things have only been harder for Andi. In addition to trying to adjust to the new status and figure out who her dad is, Andi has also been struggling through the intense tension between Bex and Celia. On one hand, Celia is too strict and overprotective and doesn't want to let go of Andi; while on the other hand, Bex is too carefree and doesn't act like a mother. This puts Andi in a tough position as she is often forced to choose which one of them to follow. It becomes evident when Bex encourages Andi to watch a horror movie against Celia's will. This causes Andi to get detention the following day for sleeping in class.

She is disappointed to find that the text was from Amber to prove to Jonah that Andi is in love with Jonah. Andi refuses to confirm that she likes Jonah.

Andi leads the protest along with Buffy and Cyrus but they're quickly summoned into the principal's office. The principal threatens to suspend them if they don't change.

She only liked it for Jonah. But now after the protest, she feels liberated. She feels like she can go for what she wants without having to make her life revolve around Jonah. Jonah apologizes but Andi tells her it's not his fault. It was her fault for misleading him by doing anything he asked instead of standing up for herself.

Andi reads about how a clothing company called Mint Chip throws away expensive clothes they can't sell instead of giving them away for free. She and her friends dive into Mint Chip's dumpsters to take the clothes and give them away for free. Because they don't have permission to do so, Andi and her friends are arrested for giving away clothes they don't own. They're given 20 hours of community service.

==== One Girl's Trash ====
While picking trash as part of their community service'','' Andi realizes that she could use the trash for some of her arts and crafts. Later in school, Andi is shocked to learn that students in her class don't really know her. Instead, all they see is a bunch of Asian stereotypes. This angers Andi, pushing her to do something big to make a statement. It inspires Andi to build a collage masterpiece using important items from major events in her life to show people who she really is. She puts the huge collage on display at school with the caption, "Trashing Stereotypes: Do You See Me Now?" To Andi's surprise, the art piece gets so much attention and praise from a lot of people, including her teachers and Bex.

==== Arts and Inhumanities ====
Bex is so impressed with Andi's masterpiece that she wants her to apply for an art school to help nurture her art talent. She sends Andi a link to Shadyside Academy of Visual Arts (SAVA) but Andi is overwhelmed by the application since it is designed for people with formal art instructors. To settle the argument between Bex and Andi, Bowie asks them to visit the school to see it for themselves before deciding whether or not Andi should apply. After visiting the SAVA campus, Andi loves the school so much and decides that's where she wants to go.

==== Something to Talk A-Boot ====
Andi completes the SAVA application but gets cold feet about submitting it. She doesn't want to tell anyone about the application because she's afraid she might not make it. She asks Jonah for advice on whether she should do something if she's afraid of failing. Jonah tells her not to do it, and Andi agrees. However, Andi reopens the laptop only to realize that she sent it by mistake. She receives an acknowledgement card from SAVA but decides to keep a secret so that she doesn't disappoint anyone if she doesn't get in.

==== A Moving Day ====
Bex tells Andi, Bowie and CeCe that she's won a meal with a famous chef and wants to take them with her. After a long drive and an exhausting walk up the mountain, Andi is surprised to find out that Bex was actually taking them to her surprise wedding. Andi is thrilled to finally have her parents married. While celebrating, Andi gets a phone call and a voicemail from SAVA regarding her application. She listens to the call and doesn't appear to look to happy but Bex and Bowie surpise her and hug her not telling them if she did or didn't get into SAVA.

==== We Were Here ====
Cece is leaving town so Bex and Andi decide to throw another party. They find so many different supplies from their first party and decide to reuse them. Bowie then comes in to pull Bex aside and show her a letter from SAVA to Andi. The party is alive and everyone is dancing and having fun, then someone in an inflatable dinosaur costume comes down the stairs and starts dancing, winning over the crowd. Everyone assumes it's Andi again, but it's not her. So they assume it's Jonah, but he shows up behind them meaning it's not him either. The person in the costume finishes dancing and reveals that the person inside is Cece. She says she had to come back because she forgot something: how much she wanted to go to one their parties.

Andi and her friends and family then sing ''Born This Way.''

Jonah then comes outside and then says he has something for her which worries her that it might be one of his weird presents he used to get her. He says that it's not a present but its the Bracelet. Which they both thought he lost. He asks her what she's gonna do with it. She says that she'll bury it, but he says he wants to keep it since he's always liked it. She puts it on his his wrist. She then says that she wonders what would've happened if they'd met when they were older. He says that someday they ''will'' be older and she smiles.

The Good Hair Crew, and Bex and Bowie are all sitting by the fire passing and Andi shows them a picture of her, Buffy and Cyrus when they first met in second grade. She shows them Andi Shack which is completely empty. She says that she doesn't need a shack because she needs a studio because she got in to SAVA! Bex asks when did she get in. Andi says that the phone call she got in the middle of their wedding was letting her know that she got in and they'll send her the acceptance letter. Buffy and Cyrus are sad that she'll be leaving them but they're still happy for her.

Bowie says that Andi Shack was outstanding and Bex chimes in saying that a lot of life happened in there. This then leads to flashbacks from the time Andi discovered Bex was her mother, Andi and her friends inside Andi Shack thinking Bex has a secret baby, Bowie and Andi thinking of proposing ideas the first time, Jonah leaving for his frisbee camp and Andi finding out Cece was in Andi Shack, to Bowie thanking Andi for throwing him a party and her calling him "Dad" for the first time.

Bex and Bowie hug Andi saying how proud they are of her, and they go to clean up after the party. This leaves all 4 friends outside. Cyrus says they should cherish this moment because it's probably the last moment they'll be together, which Andi rebuttals saying that no matter where they are or where they go, they'll always be in each others' lives. They all picture themselves in the future. Andi being a famous artist, Buffy being a coach in the WNBA (or NBA), Cyrus being a screenwriter, and Jonah being a rockstar. Andi then asks Jonah to take a picture of the three of them in the same position as the photo from when they were little. He takes it and gives it to her. Buffy then says that tonight was big. Cyrus then says some words from Winnie the Pooh "You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think." They then all engage in a group hug saying the party was great (in Buffy's words), life-changing (in Cyrus's words), and he missed some stuff (in Jonah's words). Andi then asks if they can all meet at The Spoon the next day. They agree and each give her a hug

She then takes the two photos of her friends and pins them side by side in Andi Shack and turns off the lights and goes back inside.
