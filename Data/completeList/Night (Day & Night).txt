==Background==
Night, as his name implies, is a 2D-animated cartoon character with a nighttime background inside him. When he first met Day, he did not get along with him because he was different. Until Night found a solution of what other things happen at night, he finally gets along with him to which it is found out that he is identical to day. When happy, Night emits fireworks inside him to signify his joy.

==Appearances==
===''[[Day & Night]]''===
Night is introduced as a cartoon character with a computer-animated nighttime background inside him as his name suggests. During his first encounter with Day, Night is first seen sleeping with sheep leaping over the fence inside him. Disturbed, Night clashes with his daytime counterpart in disgust until later, he finds a solution of what it is like at nighttime. For instance, during the casino part, Night finds out that lights shine at a casino during nighttime. As he and Day discover many fascinating events in each other, the two realize that they are both identical to each other just as Night receives a daytime background inside his own body.

==Trivia==
*There are certain cameos and references to other Disney/Pixar media inside Night's background:
**The sheep leaping over the fence during the scene where Night is sleeping make the same sound effects [[Billy, Goat, and Gruff|Bo Peep's sheep]] make from ''[[Toy Story: Animated StoryBook]]''.
**The wolf inside him is actually a reused model of [[Alpha]], one of Muntz's dogs from the [[2009]] animated Pixar film, ''[[Up]]''.
**At one point when Night shows a drive-in movie scene, the movie played is actually a clip from ''[[The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour]]'' TV series from the Disney animated film, ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''. Also, some of the cars at the drive-in movie in this same scene are actually reused models from the Pixar film, ''[[Cars]]''.
