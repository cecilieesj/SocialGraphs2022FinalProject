{{Quote|Yes, Akela?|Rama|The Jungle Book}}

'''Rama''' is a minor character in Disney's 1967 film ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. He is a member of the [[Seeonee wolf pack]] who served as [[Mowgli]]'s former adoptive father.

==Background==
Rama is a member of a wolf pack that [[Bagheera]] is aquatinted with. At the beginning of the film, he and his mate [[Raksha]] had recently had a litter of pups. Due to his short appearance, his personality is not well developed. However, he treats [[Mowgli]] as his own adopted son and cares deeply for the boy's safety.

==Role in the film==
As narrated by [[Bagheera]], the newborn Mowgli is taken to Rama and his mate in the hopes that they would care for the baby. While Raksha is immediately enamored, and Rama accepts the boy, helping her to raise him for 10 years.

When [[Shere Khan]] returns to the wolves' part of the jungle, Rama is present at a meeting meant to determine Mowgli's future. As Shere Khan has sworn to kill Mowgli and all who protected him, the wolf pack elders decide to send Mowgli away, as even the pack would not be strong enough to face Shere Khan.

Rama complains in Mowgli's favor, stating that the boy is like his own son and thus is entitled to the pack's protection. Rama also states Mowgli would likely not survive alone in the jungle. However, [[Bagheera]] volunteers to take Mowgli to a [[Man Village]] he knows of. Rama watches as Bagheera heads off.

==Trivia==
*In the book, Rama was a name of a water buffalo and this character's name was just "Father Wolf".
*His named after a Hindu Deity Rama, an avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu.
*Similiar to King Louie, Rama doesn't appear in the 2003 sequel alongside the wolves, and his occupation as Mowgli's adoptive father is taken over by the [[Ranjan's Father|Village Leader]].
