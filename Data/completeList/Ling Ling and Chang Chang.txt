'''Ling Ling and Chang Chang''' are a pair of zoo [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Cavemen humans] in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_102:_The_Mating_Dance The Mating Dance]." Ling Ling was played by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jeff_Chayette?action=edit&redlink=1 Jeff Chayette] and Chang Chang was played by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Perry_Anzilotti Perry Anzilotti].

Attempts to mate the pair have failed continually. It is feared that Ling Ling is barren and Chang Chang is sent to [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mel_Luster%27s_Mating_Dance_Academy Mel Luster's Mating Dance Academy] as a last resort.

Referencing real-world problems with panda mating, the joke lies in the fact that Ling Ling and Chang Chang are both bearded males.

They are named after Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, two pandas who were given to the [[United States]] of America as gifts from [[China]] in [[1972]].
