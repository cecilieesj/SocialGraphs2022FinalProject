'''Clyde Cosgrove''' is a character in the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode, "[[The Luck Stops Here]]".

==Personality==
Clyde Cosgrove is a kind, caring, friendly, and humble inventor with a need for good luck and a goal to win a prize at the Kitchen Appliance Convention.

==Role==
Clyde Cosgrove is first seen tossing coins in a park pond for good luck, finding things that will bring him good luck, and avoiding bad luck.

After a few accidents, Cosgrove returns home to his apartment (with [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]] inside his briefcase). When testing out his inventions, they all seem to fail even with the help of his pet "good luck kitty cat", [[Kismet]].

After noticing Gadget with one of his inventions, he tries to stop her until he notices one of them fixed and working fine. Therefore, he considers her a lucky mouse and decides to keep her for more help and luck; much to Kismet's jealousy and anger, since she is actually the reason his inventions have been failing due to sabotage.

A few moments later, after returning from the same park earlier with no four-leaf clover he found earlier for good luck, Cosgrove continues fixing the [[Meal-O-Matic]] for the Kitchen Appliance Convention and suffering threats of losing his job from his boss, [[Mr. Gribbish]].

Despite the machine not being ready yet, it is taken to the convention and Cosgrove struggles to finish completing it, despite his boss' continuous threats.

When Cosgrove sees Kismet trying to attack and eat Gadget, he finishes up his invention in a jiffy and sets it to seize Kismet. The machine shaves Kismet's fur off, thus, forcing her to flee and never to be seen or heard from again. It is at this point that Cosgrove realizes that all he needed was a better reason to be successful.

With the machine working perfectly, the impressed judges proclaim Cosgrove the winner and he is finally awarded the Golden Beater Award.
