'''Frank and Dave''' are two Subconscious Guards in the [[2015]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Inside Out]]''. They are two policeman-like Mind Workers who are in faction in front of [[Subconscious]]' massive door. Frank has hair and no mustache while Dave is bald and has a mustache. Frank is voiced by [[Dave Goelz]] and Dave is voiced by [[Frank Oz]].

==Role in the film==
When [[Joy]] and [[Sadness]] attempt to enter Subconscious, in order to save [[Bing Bong]] and the [[Core Memory Orbs|Core Memories]], Frank and Dave are busy arguing as one of them claims the other has his hat, to which the latter answers that the hat reads "my hat" and that it is therefore his. This doesn't stop them from noticing Joy and Sadness sneaking behind and they imprison the two Emotions.

Later, they are seen arguing again, as both claim that the "my hat" inscription is written in their own handwriting. However, they are stopped short in their discussion when the door of Subconscious is suddenly smashed to pieces and gives way to [[Jangles the Clown]], [[Riley Andersen|Riley]]'s worst fear.

==Trivia==
*Their names and voice actors are ironic, in that they are reversed with each other.
*Goelz and Oz are two iconic [[The Muppets (franchise)|Muppet]] performers, and the recording session was the first time the two had worked on a project together in 16 years.
