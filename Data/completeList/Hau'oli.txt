'''Hau'oli''' is a character who was featured in the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]".

==History==
===Background===
Hau'oli serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the Japan-exclusive incarnation of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, he and the other emcee birds try to investigate the case of something weird going on in the Tiki Room attraction. After the culprit behind the mess is revealed to be [[Stitch]], Hau'oli and the other emcee birds scold Stitch for disrupting the show to which Stitch then apologizes to them for doing pranks in the Tiki Room. After Stitch accepts to perform in the show after promising not to do anymore pranks, Hau'oli then performs with Stitch with the other emcee birds who then participate with him during the end of the show.

===Development History===
After [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]] closed in early [[2008]], the hosts from this incarnation of the attraction, Danno, Lava, Scats, and Buddy, are replaced by four new unique bird hosts: Hau'oli, Manu, Mahina, and Waha Nui when the attraction opened on summer 2008 where the incarnation features a storyline different from the one in the original incarnation.

==Role in the attraction==
Hau'oli and the other four emcee birds are introduced singing the musical number "[[Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride]]" to which during the song, the lights go out just as the four emcee birds look at the strange graffiti on the wall whom Waha Nui thinks it is the Big Kahuna who is behind the mess. Manu warns the other emcee birds that if they make the Big Kahuna angry, the Tiki Room would be in trouble just as Mahina explains to him that the writing on the wall says "Aloha e komo mai" to which Hau'oli explains that this writing is the title of their next musical number to which Mahina explains to the other emcee birds that the tiki gods must be knowing about this song just as the musical number "Aloha, E Komo Mai" begins where Hau'oli. After the song, Hau'oli and Mahina listen to Manu who tells Waha Nui to not upset the Big Kahuna just as Waha Nui plans to play the next musical number "[[Hawaiian War Chant]]". As the [[Orchids]] begin their next musical number, Hau'oli suddenly notices Stitch disrupting the show much to his worry as Manu warns Hau'oli, Mahina, and Waha Nui to not upset the Big Kahuna in which Waha Nui plans to cancel the musical number to which the song suddenly ends.

As the emcee birds are discussing about the Big Kahuna, Hau'oli reacts to a very loud foghorn sound effect heard inside the Tiki Room as Manu then plans on giving out the next musical number "[[On the Beach at Waikiki]]" with the [[Showgirl Birds|Winged Wahines]] performing their part. Noticing the plastic blue ears on their heads, Hau'oli and the other emcee birds notice the Winged Wahines planning on not finishing the song until the culrpit behind the mess is gone as the Winged Wahines leave off for Waikiki in disgust to which the song ends.

After the song, the culprit behind the trouble is revealed to be [[Stitch]] who was playing pranks throughout the show just as Hau'oli and the other emcee birds worriedly notice this and it is revealed that the "Big Kahuna" is actually Stitch doing pranks. Hau'oli and the other emcee birds scold Stitch for causing trouble in the show. Worried that being punished in the Tiki Room is no fun for him, Stitch then promises not to do anymore pranks in the show just as the emcee birds accept Stitch's promise to which a reprise of "Aloha, E Komo Mai" begins. Hau'oli then sings with the other emcee birds during the reprise while singing with Stitch accepted in the show. As the song pauses, Stitch is accepted to be in the show promising not to do pranks anymore just as Hau'oli and the inhabitants of the Tiki Room sing with Stitch accepted to perform with the entire Tiki Room cast (except for the Winged Wahines who left during the show) just as they sing along happy about being in Stitch's ohana. As the show ends, Hau'oli and the other emcee birds bid a farewell to the guests as  he and the other emcee birds discuss that the "Big Kahuna" does not exist and it is actually Stitch the whole time throughout the show.
