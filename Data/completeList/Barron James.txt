'''Barron "Barry" James''' is a great break-dancer, and is best friends with [[Sander Loya|Sander]] and also very good friends with [[Caitlyn Gellar]]. We can see that he thinks singer [[Lola Scott]] is very pretty. We first see him come up on stage at the first day behind De La Duke with Sander and rap a song about Camp Rock; obviously very confident and funny. He also raps and sings at Final Jam with Sander and Ella.
