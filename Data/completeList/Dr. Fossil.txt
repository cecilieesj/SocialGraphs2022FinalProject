==Background==
Dr. Fossil was once a paleontologist who worked at the Natural History Museum in [[St. Canard]]. Due to his love of prehistoric creatures, he turned himself into a pterosaur (possibly a Pteranodon) using a Retro-Evolution Gun. Before long, he turned a number of others into dinosaurs. His ultimate plan was to give dinosaurs another chance to rule the world.

==Trivia==
His voice is based off [[Woody Allen]]'s.
