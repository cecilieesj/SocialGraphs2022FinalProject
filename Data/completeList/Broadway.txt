'''Broadway''' is a character from the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated television series, ''[[Gargoyles]]''. He is one of the rookery trio, the other two being [[Brooklyn]] and [[Lexington]], as well as a member of the [[Manhattan Clan]] and a survivor of the [[Wyvern Clan]].

==Background==
===Physical Description===
Broadway is an obese, heavyset [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] with teal skin and forest green webbing in his wings. He wears a dark blue loincloth held up by a black belt and, unlike the other gargoyles, he has fin-like ears.

===Personality ===
Broadway is happy-go-lucky and enjoys eating when he's hungry, which is always. He tries to lighten the mood of his clan when they are depressed and finds the bright side of things. He falls in love with [[Angela]] over the course of the series. He, along with Brooklyn and Lexington, is reminiscent of ''[[wikipedia:The Three Stooges|The Three Stooges]]''.

One time while visiting [[Elisa Maza|Elisa]], Broadway found her gun and imitated gunslingers that he had seen in a detective film, but accidentally shot and wounded Elisa in the process. Although she survived, Broadway has since developed a deep dislike of guns and took it upon himself to destroy any firearm he found.

Broadway's enjoyment of eating coupled with his love for movies, particularly detective films, led to him partnering up with Elisa on a few rare occasions. He also learned to enjoy reading after a confrontation with [[Macbeth]] and the scrolls of Merlin. Out of all the gargoyles, Broadway (after [[Goliath]]) seems to have the closest friendship with Elisa.

===History===
At the start of the show Broadway, along with the rest of his clan, lived in Scotland and protected the kingdom of Avalon.

One night after saving the kingdom. He and [[Brooklyn|three]] [[Lexington|other]] [[Bronx|gargoyles]] were unfairly harassed by a paranoid mother in the courtyard, and despite their efforts to appease, they are forced to frighten their harassers to defend themselves. Their leader Goliath subsequently reprimands them for threatening the humans and orders them to remain in their nesting caverns where the clan's eggs are resting.

This saved the four gargoyles' lives when Vikings came later that day and smashed all the gargoyle statues. When Goliath came back, he informed them what happened and they went after the Vikings.

When they arrive, Magus is enraged that the gargoyles' arrival may have caused the princess' death at the Vikings' hands, and so he casts a curse on them which can only be broken when the castle rises above the clouds.

A thousand years later, in 1994, opportunistic billionaire David Xanatos claims the long-abandoned Castle Wyvern and has it reconstructed at the top of his skyscraper in New York City, along with the sleeping gargoyles.

In the episode "[[Deadly Force]]" he went and saw a western movie he loved. After the movie, he went to Elisa's, saw her gun, and played it with, accidentally shooting Elisa. She survived, but Broadway has hated guns ever since.

When he first met [[Angela]], he competed against [[Brooklyn]] and [[Lexington]] for her affection, Angela chose him.

===Future Tense===
In the "[[Future Tense]]" illusion, Broadway was blind, having lost his eyes in the resistance against [[David Xanatos|Xanatos]]. He eventually died after an attack by the [[Thailog]] Shock Troops.

==Trivia==
*His name is derived from the road in Manhattan.
*His human form is the only form that is shown to include hair.
*He is very similar to [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'', [[Rolly]] from the ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'' franchise, [[Circus Bugs#Heimlich|Heimlich]] from ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', and [[Budderball]] from the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' series]], as all five love food and have gluttonous appetites.
*Broadway was originally planned to be a girl.
*Broadway's ears have a near resemblance to gills.
*His voice actor, Bill Fagerbakke, is best known for voicing the character [[w:c:spongebob:Patrick Star|Patrick Star]] in the {{WikipediaLink|Nickelodeon}} animated television series, ''{{WikipediaLink|SpongeBob SquarePants}}''.
*In the "Big O" epsidoe: "Roger the Wanderer", statues that resembled Broadway and Brooklyn can seen on one of the buildings.
