He was introduced as a semi-regular in the second season, beginning with "[[How to Pick Up Girls]]". In the sitcom tradition of the Fonz and Eddie Haskell, Spike continually mooched food and referred to [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] as "Mr. S." His nickname for Robbie was "Scooter."

Spike's notable accomplishments include serving with the Pangaean army during the pistachio conflict, demonstrating how to hot-wire a car at the [[Bob LaBrea High School]] talent show, getting Robbie into (and out of) the Scavengers gang and introducing Robbie to swamp music.
