'''Waylon and Floyd '''are characters and members of the "Singin' Strays" from Disney's [[2006]] film, ''[[The Fox and the Hound 2]]'', midquel to the [[1981]] film, ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.

==Role in the film==
Waylon and Floyd are twin bloodhounds in [[Cash]]'s gang, the "Singin' Strays." When the gang experiences tension due to [[Dixie]]'s plans gone awry, and [[Copper]]'s banishment from the group, the entire band falls apart and each go their separate ways.

However, all is made right in the end, and Waylon and Floyd, as well as all the other strays, join together to sing once more.
