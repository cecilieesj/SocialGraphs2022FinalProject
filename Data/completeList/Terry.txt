'''Terry''' is an antagonist in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[2020]] animated feature film, ''[[Soul]]''. She<ref name = "Newshub"/><ref name = "Rachel House Youtube"/> is an accountant whose job is to count souls who go to [[The Great Beyond (location)|The Great Beyond]].

==Background==
===Official Description===
''Terry is a peculiar extension of the team of The Great Before, charged with the singular duty of keeping track of the entrants to The Great Beyond. Each [[Jerry (Soul)|Jerry]] does their best to tolerate Terry, whose obsession with The Count can be burdensome—especially when it's off. So, when [[Joe Gardner]] takes a detour to [[The Great Before]], Terry is determined to make things right.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pixar.com/soul|title=Disney Pixar Soul|website=pixar.com}}</ref> 

===Personality===
Terry is a very hard-working and perfectionist accountant. She isn't really evil, the only reason why she pursues Joe is because she notices that her soul count is off, and intended to correct it, thus showing that she is only trying to do her job.

Terry's job is to count souls that go from the Great Before to the Great Beyond. However, she hits a snag when newcomer [[Joe Gardner]] abandons the pathway in order to try and make it back to the Land of the Living. Obsessed with her quota, Terry convinces the [[Jerry (Soul)|Jerries]] to let her venture outside her jurisdiction to the Land of the Living to try and find Joe and bring him back. She eventually manages to find Joe and [[22]], and is awarded (by request) a trophy for her duties. However, the sudden calamitous arrival of the lost soul of 22 (with Joe in close pursuit) prompts Jerry to revoke the trophy. Later in the film, Terry is seen easily distracted by a Jerry, who quickly resets the accounting in order to avoid a repeat of the same affair.

==Role in the film==
Terry first appears talking with Counselor Jerry E, explaining that a soul is missing in the Great Before. She then enters the Great Before and alerts Counselor Jerry A that the soul counter is insufficient, explaining to her that 151,000 souls enter the Great Beyond every day while explaining that her job as an accountant helps Terry keep track of souls that enter. All five Counselor Jerries appear in front of Terry using her soul counter to know how many souls are in the Great Beyond. Jerry A asks Terry to figure out the problem in counting souls, to which Terry decides to follow the Counselors' task. Terry then enters the Soul Record Storage to look into the files to fix the problem. Terry then continues looking into the files to know if she can find Joe Gardner, to which she continues planning to find him and return him to the Great Before.

Terry then approaches Jerry A and B explaining to them that she is looking for Joe Gardner on Earth, to which she plans to go to Earth to find him, much to the Counselors' warning about people in the real world. Terry arrives in the real world at the hospital's monitor, where she plans to look for Joe undetected. She then opens a portal for Joe to fall in only to find out that she caught Paul instead, sending Paul back to the real world just as he ends up being frightened by her upon looking at Terry on a bag of potato chips telling him to stay away from possessed foods. Terry then camouflages herself as Piet Mondrian's style on a sign advertising the Modern Art Exhibit at the New York Museum just as she creates a portal to capture Joe and send him back to the Great Before. She successfully captures Joe and 22 to send the two back to the Great Before to which upon bringing them back, Jerries A, B, D, and E appear next to Terry just as Jerry B congratulates Terry for bringing Joe back to the Great Before just as Jerry B sends Joe and 22 back to Earth to which 22 refuses just as Terry hops into the Great Beyond.

At the You Seminar, Jerry B gives Terry a trophy as a request from her just five other Counselor Jerries applaud her to which the ceremony is disrupted when 22 (as a lost soul) bursts through just as the Counselors notice this (also causing Jerry B to give the trophy back to himself). After apologizing for turning 22 back into a normal soul and telling her to adapt her life on Earth, Terry uses her abacus in the Great Beyond as Jerry B tells her to look at Joe returning to Earth as requested by Joe Gardner.

After the end credits, she appears and tells the audience to go home, breaking the fourth wall.

==Trivia==
*Terry has the appearance of an elderly lady with a hair bun. 
*The only person to encounter Terry was [[Paul (Soul)|Paul]], when she accidentally grabbed him instead of Joe.
*Terry has often been mistaken for a male by viewers due to her androgynous sounding voice and unisex name.
*The post-credits scene in which Terry tells the audience to go home may be a reference to the 1986 film ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off''.
**The post-credit scene also has a bittersweet edge, since the film's theatrical release was severely undermined by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The film's premiere on [[Disney+]] meant that most first-time viewers watched the film from home.
