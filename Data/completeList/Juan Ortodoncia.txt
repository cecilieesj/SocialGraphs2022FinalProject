'''Juan Ortodoncia''' is a character who appears in the [[2017]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]''.

==Background==
When Juan is being scanned to cross the marigold bridge and he is accepted by the Departures Agent, he kindly gives her a complement after she found out that his photo is placed on the dentist's ''ofrenda''.

==Role in the film==
Juan briefly appears during the scene where [[Miguel Rivera]] and [[Dante]] arrive at the [[Land of the Dead]]'s departure area where the Departures Agent scans him to know if his photo is on his ''ofrenda'' before passing. Being scanned successfully due to his photo placed on the dentist's ''ofrenda'', Juan is accepted and allowed to cross the bridge before sunrise to which Juan thanks her for allowing him to cross. Juan then leaves, followed by [[Héctor|Héctor Rivera]] disguised as Frida Kahlo passing through. He is not seen again afterwards.

==Trivia==
*Juan Ortodoncia is one of [[John Ratzenberger]]'s least recognizable roles, due to him saying only one line. Therefore, he has the shortest line of all the roles Ratzenberger has played, with only one word of dialogue, making it Ratzenberger's smallest role in a Pixar film to date.
*"Juan Ortodoncia" translates as "John Orthodontics" in Spanish.
*According to the audio commentary during the scene where Juan Ortodoncia is being scanned by the computer screen before he can cross the bridge, the screen showing the results of Juan's photo placed on his ''ofrenda'' at the dentist's office is actually [[Philip Sherman]]'s [[Philip Sherman's Dentist Office|office]] from Disney/Pixar's 2003 animated feature film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.<ref>''Coco'' Audio Commentary (''Coco'' Blu-ray / Digital releases, 2018)</ref>
