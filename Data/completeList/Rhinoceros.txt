The '''rhinoceros''' is an extremely mad nemesis to [[Goofy]] in the [[1945]] animated short, ''[[African Diary]]''.

==Role in the Short==
After run-ins with various animals while camping for the night and taking his morning plunge (ruined by a hippopotamus that takes all the water with him when exiting the pool), Goofy sets off in search of the black rhinoceros. Unfortunately for Goofy, the rhinoceros is prepared to encounter him, thanks to a [[Titbird]] resting on his horn, and charges after him. Goofy tries his shot against the rhino, but the animal is too much for Goofy. He evidently leaves Africa, fleeing from the rhinoceros, so other hunters can shoot it.
