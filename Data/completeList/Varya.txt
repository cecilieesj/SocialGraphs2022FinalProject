'''Varya''' is a female tiger who appears in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.

==Personality==
Varya is a calm and respectful tiger. She cares deeply for her cubs.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Long Live the Queen]]", Varya first appears when she's cornered with [[Feliks, Pasha, and Polina|her cubs]] by [[Makucha's Army]] on her way to the Tree of Life. She tells her cubs to head for the Tree of Life while she handles [[Makucha]], but [[Chuluun]] pursues them. Varya is soon overpowered by both Makucha and [[Ora]]. However, the [[Lion Guard]] and the [[Night Pride]] show up and defeat them causing them to retreat to stop provoking the tigress. Upon stopping the villains and bringing her cubs to safety, Varya introduces herself as she heard the Tree of Life is a great place to raise her cubs as she plans to see Queen Janna. Soon as [[Kion]] takes [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] to see Queen [[Janna]], the rest of the Guard reunites her with her cubs.

After Queen Janna's funeral, Varya arrives at the Willows looking for her missing cubs as [[Bunga]] decides to find them as they pounce on the honey badger. Upon taking Varya to the Tree, Rani and [[Makini]] arrive towards her cubs to which their mother apologizes to Rani for getting in to which Varya tells her she is the queen.

At the taiga when Rani escorts the tigers to their home, they encounter some territorial musk deer who are unsure if tigers should live in the taiga to which Rani explains that only if the tigers would respect the Circle of Life to which Kiril, the leader of the musk deer, accepts the tigers to be welcomed as Rani prepares to be the new queen. Varya and her three cubs later attend the coronation of Rani.

Rani helps Varya and her family find a new home at the Tree of Life after they get attacked by Makucha's Army. When the lead musk deer Kiril is unsure if Varya and her family should live with them, Rani promises to him that only if the tigers respect the Circle of Life to which she explains to him that Varya came here seeking safety for her cubs to which she shouldn't be kicked out for disrespecting the Circle of Life to which the lead musk deer accepts the tigers to be welcomed.

===Enemies===
====[[Makucha's Army]]====

Varya hates Makcuha's Army, since they attacked her and her cubs before they could reach the Tree of Life to which the Lion Guard and the Night Pride are able to defeat them.

==Trivia==
*Varya and her three cubs are the only animals outside the Tree of Life who never hear about Janna's death. Therefore, she and the other cubs are not seen attending Janna's funeral since Varya was looking for her cubs.
*"Varya" means "form" in Hindi.
*Varya is most likely an Amur tiger (or Siberian tiger) due to the habitat she lives at while encountering some musk deer.
