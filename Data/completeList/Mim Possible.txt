[[File:ImagesCATAB0I6.jpg|thumb|250px|Miriam "Mim" Possible with Jonathan "Jon" Stoppable.]]'''Miriam "Mim" Possible''' was supposedly a great-great aunt of [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] who appeared in the ''[[Kim Possible]]'' episode "[[Rewriting History]]". She was accused of stealing a machine made by [[Professor Demens]], supposed ancestor of [[Professor Dementor]].

==Notes==
*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after Kim and Ron wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Mim was "real".
