She was created by [[Romano Scarpa]]. According to Scarpa, she completed her secondary education at a boarding school, so she is possibly around 18 years old. Dickie is smart and resourceful, but can be a little air-headed. She loves pop music, modern dance and fashion.

Her first appearance was in the Italian story "Arriva Paperetta Yè-Yè" (published in the US as "The Miner's Granddaughter" in IDW's Uncle Scrooge #18). In this story, Goldie drops Dickie off because she cannot take care of her anymore, so she asks [[Scrooge McDuck]] to do it for her. But in later stories with her, she lives in her own house.

There are some Brazilian Disney comics with her as the protagonist, where she's part of a group of friends composed of Beckett (the [[Aracuan Bird]] of the movie [[The Three Caballeros]]) and original characters Neptunia (a short owl), Olympia (a tall crane) and Walter (a handsome pelican). Dickie and her four close friends possibly are studying journalism at some university of [[Duckburg]], because of her clear connection to the reporter career, which was shown in various comic stories. Despite these spin-off stories taking place in Duckburg, they do not include appearances of other characters from the ''Donald Duck''-themed comic books or animation.

Despite the character's success in Brazil, she stopped being used by Italian authors who considered her too tied to a '60s teenager social context that does not exist anymore (the term "Yeye" in her original name indicate a type of music very popular in Italy in the '60s). To keep using the character, she was still used in some ''Donald Duck''-themed takes on classic literature. Recently, Dickie has resurfaced in Italian Disney comics as a reporter, occasionally seen working in the ''County Conscience'', Scrooge's younger brother [[Gideon McDuck]]'s newspaper.

==Animated appearance==
Dickie's only animated appearance was in the '80s in the opening sequence of the kid show ''Topolino Show'', animated by her creator Romano Scarpa.

*Although it wasn't explicitly stated whether they were related, Dickie always seems to call Scrooge her "grandpa".
*Dickie's parents were never shown or mentioned by name.
