'''Raine Whispers''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''. They are the Head Witch of the Bard Coven, as well as the leader of a rebellion against the Emperor's rule.

==Background==
===Personality and traits===
Raine is known to be a shy person. They get stage fright and get nervous when making public speeches. However, they're not afraid to stand up for what they believe in, even if it means risking their own life. They disapprove of [[Emperor Belos]] forcing witches to join covens and stealing magic, which was why they worked hard to become a Coven Head and find people who wanted to change things, starting the small rebellion known as the Bards Against the Throne (aka the BATs). Before, they never could overcome their fears until they met [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]], who encouraged them to face their fears. The two had known each other since they were students at [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]]. They even dated for a while, until Raine decided to break up on the day they joined the Bard Coven, due to Eda's tendency to push people away.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Magic:''' Like all witches, their connection to magic comes from a sac of magic bile attached to their heart. Having earned the rank of coven leader, they are undoubtedly very powerful.
**'''Bard magic:'''  As the leader of the Bard Coven, Raine is allowed to use music magic to manipulate the world around them. This allows them to nullify spells from other witches, make things levitate and take control of any people who can hear their music. Raine is also noted to be an exceptionally talented Bard, as they have managed to rise to the rank of Head Witch by skill alone.
*** '''Violin Playing:''' Raine is a skilled violinist and uses their violin to cast their Bard spells. They can use their violin to cast cutting shockwaves.
*** '''Instrument Summoning:''' Raine can also summon and dispel musical instruments at will. While they primarily use a violin, they can also summon different instruments such as a lute.
