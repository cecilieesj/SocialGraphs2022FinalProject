'''Coco Caliente''', also known as the '''Sinister Stylist''', is the main antagonist of the ''[[Teamo Supremo]]'' [[The Sinister Stylist!|episode with the same name]].

==Background==
Several years prior to the events of the episode, Coco Caliente showed up at the Annual State Award Show with a hairdo from a sci-fi TV show. To make matters worse, TV funnyman Mauricio was her co-host for the evening, and he let loose with his zingers. The constant laughter from the audience left Coco humiliated. Coco swore she would get back at everyone. Assuming the identity of the "Sinister Stylist", she gathered a group of rejects from beauty school and vowed to give everyone else in the state a bad hairdo.
