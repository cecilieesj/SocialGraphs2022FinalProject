Yori Nakajima is the father of RJ. His son goes abroad while working for a consulting company, and is mysteriously killed, to Yori's despair. A shrine is built for RJ in his memory. Years later, Yori meets [[Bucky Barnes]], and the two develop a friendship.

While outside, Yori catches his neighbor, Unique, throwing his garbage, into Yori's bin. Unique questions why they can't share, and the two begin bickering, when Bucky intervenes, questioning why he didn't come for their arranged lunch. Bucky prevents Yori from getting into a physical altercation, and Yori heads home, when Bucky insists that he'll pay for lunch. Yori accepts his offer, on the condition that he doesn't talk. At the restaurant, Yori shows Bucky a list of names from the obituary, pointing out no one past ninety made it. He observes Bucky looking at [[Leah (Marvel)|Leah]] the waitress. Yori advises him to ask her out, and proposes the date on his behalf, to Bucky's embarrassment. He finds some green mochi, placed in front of his table, causing him to tear up, as he remembers his son. He tells Bucky that red bean mochi were RJ's favorite, and gives him details of his death. He expresses the sadness he feels, in never knowing what really happened to him. The next evening, Bucky arrives at Yori's home. He questions how the date went, and Bucky replies that it was good. He gives him money, for lunch from the previous day and leaves.

==Trivia==
*Based on the shrine Yori set up for RJ, he appears to be a Buddhist.
