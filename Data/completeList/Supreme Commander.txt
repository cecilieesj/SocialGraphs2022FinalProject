The '''Supreme Commander''' is the primary antagonist of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]'', later reformed.

==Role in the film==
The Supreme Commander is actually the [[Hearing Aid]]'s long-lost twin brother in a smaller icebox within a giant icebox, which is his suit. His "disguise" is bigger than all the other appliances, and he uses it to rule [[Mars]], which he once moved to. He is only Supreme Commander due to electing himself as such and being inside a giant refrigerator that is his assistant.

He (secretly) despises human beings due to their abusive nature. He also states that the [[Wonder Luxe Appliances]] (his henchmen) were built just to fall apart, making them obsolete. However, a gentle touch from [[Robbie McGroarty|Robbie]] (the Little Master), causes him to turn inexplicably pink and smile at the child, as it made him remember something about humans in which they are not all bad, but he then reverts to his original color and pushes Robbie aside.

However, he secretly reforms after the election between him and [[Toaster]] for Supreme Commander and reveals himself to be the Hearing Aid's long-lost twin brother. After being reunited with the Hearing Aid, the ex-Supreme Commander travels back to Earth with [[Tinselina]], Toaster, and everyone else, but not before deactivating [[the Missile]] which was set to destroy Earth when he was formerly in charge before being convinced by Toaster to deactivate it, and they were both later rescued.

During the "[[Home Again]]" sequence, the ex-Supreme Commander is seen in the junk drawer playing poker with his twin brother and the [[Calculator]].

==Trivia==
*The film strongly implies that the Supreme Commander came to hate humans after he was acquired by a [[Nazis|Nazi]] scientist; after the Supreme Commander talks to his twin brother, he says that after [[Albert Einstein]] left his house in a hurry, he was later found by the "notorious Doctor Von Gaigefonken" who was always listening to "talks about bombs, missiles, and warheads."
