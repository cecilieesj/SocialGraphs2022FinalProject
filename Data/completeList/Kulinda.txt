===''[[Ono and the Egg]]''===
Kulinda is seen caring for her egg, excitingly waiting for it to hatch. Then, she sees Mpishi fly overhead and begins to worry for her young one's safety. Shortly afterward she sees Ono flying after the hawk, cheering him on as he goes. Witnessing the young egret's bravery, Kulinda knew Ono would be perfect to watch her hatchling while she fixes up her nest so she leaves her egg in Ono's nest. As she continued building her nest, the sticks Kulinda was carrying blew out of her claws due to the approaching storm, and she goes searching for more.

Kulinda returns to her nest to find Bunga eating insects she had collected, but she tells the honey badger that the nest is already taken. She then sees the rest of the Lion Guard. Kion asks her why she left her egg in Ono's nest, and she explains that her nest wasn't done yet but she is now ready for her egg. Later, she begins to panic that something might be wrong with her egg but, the Lion Guard assures her that the egg is safe.

When the Guard makes back to Ono's nest, Kulinda discovers that her egg has hatched and her baby is gone. She lets out a cry which leads her baby right to her, upon seeing her chick the two perform the family dance; but as soon as the two are reunited the baby goes running off to check another bug straight toward a river.

Kulinda flies off with Ono to save her but her baby is grabbed by Mpishi and the two fly after her with Mwoga joining in. With Ono's quick thinking they were able to stop the hawk and save her chick, as a special way to thank the young egret Kulinda names her chick after him calling her Ona. When Ono says that he is going to miss her, Kulinda affirms that he can visit them anytime as they consider Ono as a family member but he does come back she reminds Ono that he has to do the hamerkop family dance to which she does Ona and Ono as the Lion Guard watches with pleasure.
