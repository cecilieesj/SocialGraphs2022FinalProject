'''Zipper''' is a little fly character from the animated series ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. A running gag in the series is that he is often mistaken for an alien whenever he gets big or switches bodies with a human.

Zipper is introduced together with [[Monterey Jack]] in the five-part origin story "[[To the Rescue]]".

==Background==
===Personality===
Zipper is a brave, friendly, tough, spunky, and loyal fly. He is shown to be very close best friends with [[Monterey Jack]] most of the time.

==Role in the series==
Zipper spent much of his life traveling the world with Monterey Jack. They are best friends. He joins the [[Rescue Rangers]] after Monterey's home is destroyed by [[Fat Cat]], in an event that gives Monterey a grudge against him that is strangely not brought up again anytime later in the series.

Zipper is the only member of the Rangers that doesn't speak, other than to making squeaky bird-like chirps. He is the smallest of the Rangers and laughs similar to the non-Disney character Woody Woodpecker.

Despite the smallest of the group, Zipper serves as a big help to them. He can be quick to anger, often forcing others to keep him out of trouble. He hates seeing his friends in trouble. He is often seen traveling with Monterey Jack and sharing his opinions, facts, ideas, and inexplicably, his pain. Whenever Monterey suffers cheese attacks, Zipper proves to be tougher on him while talking him down. His special talent is mostly flight and lock-picking.

===[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'']]===
After the end of the ''Rescue Rangers'' series, the team disbands and Zipper married Gadget, becoming father to numerous housefly-mouse hybrid offspring. The two then settled down into a quieter life, with Gadget working at an auto shop and Zipper working as a stay-at-home father. Both were later recruited by Dale to rescue Chip and Monty, and after they reunite and end the reign of the uncanny valley gang the five begin to make the best of their newfound stardom.

Corey Burton reprised his role as Zipper during flashback on-set scenes. In the off-set scenes, he is voiced by Dennis Haysbert, and speaks in a much clearer and more intelligible manner.
===Other appearances===
*[[Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'' impersonated Zipper several times in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|TV series spin-off of the same name]].
*Zipper also had a cameo in ''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks]]''.
