'''Bjornson the Cheesemonger''' is a minor character in the [[2022]] [[Disney+]] film ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. He is an uncanny human chef puppet that speaks with a Swedish-Italian-Scandinavian like accent and sells cheeses at his glorious kitchen.

== Background ==

=== Personality ===
Bjornson was a friendly, trusting human chef who sells various types of cheeses such as Muensters, Goudas, and Bries. Until [[Chip and Dale]] told him to give them "Stinky cheeses", his good guy side swapped to his bad guy side, as he thought things like that are offensive, prone to the lowering of his eyebrows and disappointment.

=== Physical appearance ===
Bjornson is a human chef with a white chef's hat on that covers most of his head. He sports a brown moustache and eyebrows, has big and shiny white eyes with black circles in the middle, and most of his hair is visible and sticking out through the sides of his ears. He also has a big poker nose with a slight chin. And he wears a white shirt with a black bib apron clasped on, along with a yellow-red tie strapped around his neck.

== Role in the film ==
When Chip and Dale visit the charming Main Street, Dale reveals as a cover for some of the nastiest cartoon characters in the game. Their crimes include stolen security numbers and muppet fights, but it's Bjornson that Chip and Dale need, as he's responsible for [[Monterey Jack]]'s intense cheese addiction. He's extremely devoted to his cheese shop, and when Chip and Dale first encounter him, he's singing a lovely ditty about his stinky, gooey cheeses.

His friendly disposition vanishes immediately when Chip inquires about whether he has any stinky cheese. He responds "You cops?". Bjornson asks, revealing that he's far more than just a humble cheesemonger, shedding his friendly persona for a much tougher reality. He gets people hooked on stinky, tantalizing cheese. He plays an important role in getting Chip and Dale into seeing the leader of the Valley Gang. But then kicks Chip and Dale out of his kitchen when he had enough of them and then loads them up in his cheese-van to direct them to Sweet Pete, where Chip and Dale stay in for a couple of minutes. When Bjornson managed to arrive to Bob the Dwarf’s lair, he then leads them the way to there. He opens the mail slot to see If Bob is coming to assist Chip and Dale, and tells them “Good luck, Dummies” and walks away. 

It's currently unknown what happens to Bjornson afterwards, but he is seen at ''Fuzzy Fights'' scenario during the credits, meaning that he was not arrested following the imprisonment of [[Peter Pan (character)|Sweet Pete]], [[Bob the Dwarf|his]] [[Jimmy the Polar Bear|cohorts]] and [[Captain Putty]].

== Trivia ==
*He is clearly based on [[The Swedish Chef]] from ''[[The Muppets (franchise)|The Muppets]]''. As complete with the camera deliberately obscuring his legs as if an actual puppeteer is performing him.
*As typical with puppet characters, you never see the bottom of his torso and [[Chip and Dale]] never acknowledge it.
*He has a crack in his ceiling that attracts lots of citizens through it.
