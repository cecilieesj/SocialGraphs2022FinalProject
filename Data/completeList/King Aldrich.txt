'''King Aldrich Leviathan ''' is a posthumous pivotal antagonist in the series ''[[Amphibia]]''. He was the father of [[King Andrias]]. 

== Background ==
King Aldrich ruled [[Amphibia]] over 1,000 years ago; he was a ruthless selfish tyrant determined to continue his family's work of conquering other worlds. 

One day, young Andrias was approached by his father, King Aldrich, who was not fond of his son's friendship with the frog [[Leif]] and the toad [[Barrel]], claiming that "friendship doesn't last", as well as tells him that he should not rely on his friends as they will ask for favors and shows him the [[The Core|Core]], which houses the memories of their ancestors, and explains the importance of the [[Calamity Box]].

After Leif steals the box, the Core tells him of an olm prophecy, saying the music box will one day return, and in turn, Aldrich tells Andrias when it does, he can finally redeem himself and will continue with the invasion of Earth. 

At some point before passing away, his mind was assimilated into the Core so he could live forever. Aldrich's personality is revealed to have surfaced within the Core, which is partially controlling [[Marcy Wu]].

When Marcy appeared in a Library, Aldrich appear to her and wanted to welcome her to the Core's intersection as the first human to join their ranks. Marcy was confused of what was the Core and how she ended up in the Core as her memories were a bit fuzzy, but Aldrich told he it didn't matter. He introduced her to a fantasy world based on her memories from her favorite video games and books, even giving her fantasy versions of Anne and Sasha. However, this was all part of his plan to distract her and assimilated her into the Core. When Marcy ultimately rejected the fantasy, Aldrich condemned her to a black void but Marcy's faith in her friends ultimately won out as [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] severed the Core's connection to the castle and freed Marcy.

During the final battle, Aldrich called out to Andrias through his crown, promising him immortality in the Core. Instead, a repentant Andrias ordered his frobots to aid the heroes against the Core. Aldrich berated his son for his betrayal only for Andrias to slowly crush his crown in his hand, declaring he should've stood up to his father long ago. Aldrich's consciousness was obliterated by Anne using the power all of all three gemstones.

== Trivia ==
* Aldrich's voice can be heard at the end of the third season's trailer.
