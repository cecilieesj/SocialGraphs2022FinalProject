'''Baron Von Sheldgoose''' is the secondary antagonist of ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''.

==Background ==
Baron Von Sheldgoose is the wealthy president of the New Quackmore Institute and takes great pride in his wealth and status and maintaining a certain decorum. When [[Donald Duck]] arrives to claim his great-grandfather's inheritance, he mistakenly arrives at Sheldgoose's mansion and immediately gets on his bad side. When Sheldgoose sees the Caballeros trying to hold a yard sale of all the artifacts within the cabana, he is initially furious, but sees an opportunity to claim some of the magical items that [[Clinton Coot]] held and offers to buy the whole thing for a million dollars. In the end, they reject his offer, but not before he bought a ring belonging to his ancestor: the dark sorcerer Felldrake Sheldgoose. The ring opens a secret room in his mansion holding Felldrake's magic staff that he was imprisoned in, who offers to share his dark powers with his descendant.

== Powers and abilities==

* '''[[Dark Magic]]''': When holding the Felldrake’s Staff, Baron possess a variety of his ancestor's dark magic. He later gained his own in the season 1 final so he can stall for more time for Felldrake to regain his strength. Abilities his dark magic included were blasting powerful energy beams, turning people into other animals, and opening purple-colored portals that come from “Zoompoints” that summon all of his evil allies (this, however, caused Xandra to summon their allies from Zoompoints as well). After Felldrake’s defeat, Baron seemed lost all of these abilities.

== Trivia==

*Von Sheldgoose physically resembles [[Gladstone Gander]]'s father Goosetave Gander.
