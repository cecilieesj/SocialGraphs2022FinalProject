'''Chemistro''' is a supervillain from [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel Comics]], and a member of the Masters of Evil.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
During the Vault breakout, Chemistro tried to recover his equipment, but was punched in the face by [[Hawkeye]], another prisoner.

When the Masters of Evil stole and guarded the Norn Stones, Chemistro was one of their new recruits and faced Hawkeye, now a member of the [[Avengers]]. Chemistro wanted revenge on Hawkeye, who annoyed him by not remembering him and confusing him with other villains like [[Trapster|Paste Pot Pete]].

When [[Enchantress (Marvel)|Enchantress]] decided to dispose of the Masters of Evil, she turned Chemistro into gold with his own gun. He seemingly is still alive.
