==Appearances==

===''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''===
The bucks are only seen once in the film. They are seen doing their annual run out in the meadow. Two of the bucks are seen using their antlers in a fight for one of the does out on the meadow ([[Aunt Ena|Faline's mother]] and [[Bambi's mother]] both already have mates). The bucks stop when [[the Great Prince of the Forest]] walks out on the meadow. The last time you see them is when [[Man]] is trying to hunt them after their run when they're eating.

===''[[Bambi II]]''===
The bucks are only seen using their antlers to fight and then when doing their annual run, joined by [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], [[Ronno]], and the Great Prince.

==Trivia==
*In the first film, the bucks had two-pointed antlers, whilst in the second film, they had three-pointed ones. This was presumably because of their appearance in the second film takes place a few months after their appearance in the first film.
*In some Tanya Cookies Videos, the Young Bucks are the only characters in media, animation, and video to be featured in Tanya Cookies. They make a brief cameo appearance in Tokelauan Island Earthquake. They had been voted as their second place to vote in the Young Bucks episode.
*There is also a tag team in Ring of Honor & New Japan Pro Wrestling called "The Young Bucks", which consists of Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson.
