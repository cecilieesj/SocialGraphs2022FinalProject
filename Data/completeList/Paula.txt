'''Paula''' is a minor character and antagonist in ''[[Dog With a Blog]]''. She is portrayed by Allison Bills.

==History==
Not much is known about but she is a mother.

At the park, when [[Bennett James|Bennett]] and [[Ellen Jennings|Ellen]] are teaching [[Chloe James|Chloe]] to drive a toy car, they accidentally bumped with her baby in his carriage. She yelled at Chloe but Bennett and Ellen said don't yell her and she's their moment, so she thought it was a good idea to yell at parents instead of her.

==Appearances==
===Season One===
*[[The Fast and the Furriest]]

==Trivia==
*The way Bennett and Ellen bumped into Paula is similar to how they unknowingly first met in "[[The Fast and the Furriest]]".
