==Background==
Woozles are an odd race resembling weasels (hence the name similarity) and their main objective is to steal all the honey possible. It is currently unknown if Woozles are bad or good creatures (like [[Heffalumps|Hefflalumps]]) by [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] and his friends. In ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', Woozles are seen and often mentioned by [[Tigger]] throughout the series. The only known woozles to physically appear in any Winnie the Pooh related media are a villainous thief named [[Stan Woozle and Heff Heffalump|Stan]], and a giant named [[Wooster]]. While Stan fulfills the original idea that woozles are usually evil thieves who have much in common with honey-snatching heffalumps, Wooster proves they can be turned good, depending on the woozle's personality and how they are treated by others.

In  ''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'', while Pooh fell fast asleep, he has a nightmare about the Heffalumps and Woozles surrounding him to steal his precious honey. They also had the ability to transform like the heffalumps do, like a bandleader woozle transforming its nose into a fife with a horn end, a white Woozle who briefly turns into a square, and a small heffalump transforming into a tall skinny woozle.

In ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]'', [[Darby]], Tigger, Pooh and the others leave out treats for some Woozles, although no Woozles are seen or come. However, at the end of the episode, all the treats are gone and presumably eaten by the Woozles (so they could be nice or gentle creatures). If ''The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' and ''My Friends Tigger & Pooh'' are both meant to fall within the same continuing storyline within the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' universe, this could mean that much like humans in real life, some choose to make good decisions (like Wooster), and others choose to make bad decisions (like Stan).
