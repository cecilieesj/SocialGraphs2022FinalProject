'''Narcissus''' is a character in ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]'' and the [[1998]] [[Hercules (TV series)|TV series]]. He is considered as a God. However, in actual Greek mythology, Narcissus was a man who was very handsome. Due to not loving a nymph (nature spirit) called Echo, Narcissus was made to look at a reflection of himself, and fall in love with himself. He could not look away, so eventually he died.

The [[Olympian Gods]] took pity on him and turned Narcissus into a flower known as the Narcissus and god of the vanity and son of Cephissus the river god and Liriope naiad nymph. In the [[1997]] film, he is portrayed as an Olympian god with white hair and purple skin.
