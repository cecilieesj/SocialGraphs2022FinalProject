The '''Flamingos''' are birds who appeared in the [[1951]] [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. They have been used as croquet mallets by the [[Queen of Hearts]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
The Flamingos first appeared when they were being put inside the croquet bag for the Queen of Hearts and [[Alice]] to use. The Queen of Hearts uses the green flamingo to help cheat her way through, but Alice has trouble with the pink flamingo because it constantly tickles, embarrasses and wrestles with her. Alice's irate disappointment was predictable when her shot was missed after a wild swing on the pink hedgehog as it got hit into a tree. The [[Cheshire Cat]] then showed up and decided to make the Queen of Hearts angry. The flamingos were never seen again in the film after he used the green one the Queen of Hearts was using to pull over her skirt and make her land on her head.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
The green flamingo (used by the Queen of Hearts) was seen in a couple of ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episodes. In these episodes, it was colored yellow with an orange beak and legs while the hedgehog was colored orange. In "[[Thanks to Minnie]]", [[Goofy]] told the flamingo about [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]]'s secret about [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], then it passes it on to the Queen of Hearts who hit the hedgehog so it can pass it on to [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]. It was also used by the Queen of Hearts when [[Mortimer Mouse]] distracted her in "[[Goofy's Valentine Date]]" and can be seen in the background in "[[The Mouse Who Came to Dinner]]".

===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===
The flamingos are once again used in the ''Alice in Wonderland'' attraction game, only this time the flamingos are identical to the pink one Alice used in the original film.
