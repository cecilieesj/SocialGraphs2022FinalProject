'''Old Yeller''' is the title character of the [[Old Yeller|film of the same name]]. He is a Labrador Retriever and a hero.

==Role in the film==
At first, Old Yeller causes trouble such as scaring the Coates' mule, [[Jumper]], and stealing food from them, which angers him deeply. However, after he saves  [[Travis Coates|Travis]]'s younger brother, [[Arliss Coates|Arliss]], from a mother bear, Travis changes his mind and grows fond of him. They become good friends and work together to keep the farm in order and safe. However, one night, when a rabid [[The Wolf|wolf]] attacks, Old Yeller is bitten during the fight and gets rabies as a result. Travis is distraught about this, and reluctantly has to shoot him. Afterwards, he makes a grave for him and buries him in it. Then he starts raising his son, [[Savage Sam (character)|Savage Sam]], planning to make him be just like his father.

==Trivia==
*When Old Yeller was rabid, his growls and snarls were really recycled sound effects from [[Tramp]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', when he was fighting the [[The Rat|rat]].
*The growls heard during Old Yeller's fight with the wolf would later be reused in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' during [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]'s fight against [[Jasper and Horace]], and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' when [[Copper]] was fighting the [[The Bear|bear]].
*Old Yeller's barks would later be reused for [[Chief]] from ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'', [[Nikki]] from ''[[Nikki, Wild Dog of the North]]'', and [[Toby (The Great Mouse Detective)|Toby]] from ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.
*In the book, Old Yeller is a Blackmouth Cur, while in the film, he is a Mastador (Labrador Retriever/English Mastiff mix).
*In the book, Old Yeller has a bobtail, while in the film, he has a long one.
