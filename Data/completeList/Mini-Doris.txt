'''Mini-Doris''' is a major antagonist in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''===
Mini-Doris is a small remote controlled helping hat created by [[DOR-15]] to assist the [[Michael "Goob" Yagoobian|Bowler Hat Guy]] in traveling through the house while she stayed in the time machine. She has the ability to control a creature's mind when it is put on. She took control of Frankie and [[Tiny (Meet the Robinsons)|Tiny the Tyrannosaurus]]. She is defeated when Wilbur shoots her off Tiny's head with Gaston's Meatball Cannon. [[Frankie (Meet the Robinsons)|Frankie]] and the other frogs then grab her and throw her, scared, into the trunk of a car. Afterwards, Bowler Hat Guy comments that she now "sleeps with the fishes," indicating that she was destroyed by the frogs. In any case, she was erased from existence when [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] erased DOR-15.

==Trivia==
*She is very similar to [[DOR-15|Doris]], the [[Michael "Goob" Yagoobian|Bowler Hat Guy]]'s (former) Helper Hat. They are both black-colored hats with a red eye, and are both outright psychotic and very evil. The only difference is that Doris is also the boss of Mini-Doris.
