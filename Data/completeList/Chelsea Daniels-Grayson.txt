She is [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]'s best female friend during her stay at [[Bayside High School]] and later moves in with her in ''[[Raven's Home]]. ''She is portrayed by [[Anneliese van der Pol]].
==Background==

===Personality===
Chelsea was always nearly portrayed as either absent-minded or a bit air-headed, not understanding the most simple, obvious things. Though she can be absent-minded, she deeply cares about her friends and would never let them down. She is very pretty, down-to-earth and an environmentalist.

Despite her aforementioned air-headedness, she is very gifted in other areas. She is great with animals and works in a dog groomer, where the owner said she was the best groomer they had. She also has great leadership skills, taking charge of several protests and is president of her school's greenery preservation club. She is also a teenage prodigy in arts. In early episodes, she was fairly intelligent, but this was dropped to give her more personality.

Chelsea is the opposite of her "fashionista" friend [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]. She enjoys nature and loves camping (she's even able to find edible foods and fungus out in the woods). She's also very spiritual in contrast to the "materialistic" [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]. She can sometimes be found meditating or doing things for 'spiritual' health, though this sometimes leads to trouble as she caused her friends to argue over a goat, and in a vision, turned herself and Raven into cows.

She also likes to make jokes, which only she would laugh at. Despite her apparent lack of common sense and intelligence, she has a few surprises up her sleeve—such as occasionally knowing certain "smart" things, which usually tends to surprise everyone else.

=== ''[[Raven's Home]]'' ===
Set years after the original, Chelsea is now a divorced single mother to a son named [[Levi]]. Her ex-husband is a man named Garrett, but they got divorced after Garrett had an affair with a female federal agent (who later has him arrested for tax fraud and sent to prison). Chelsea and Levi end up moving in with Raven, who, like Chelsea, is now a divorced single mother (but to boy-girl fraternal twins named Booker and Nia, the former of whom inherited Raven's psychic abilities).
