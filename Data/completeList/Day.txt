==Background==
Day, as his name implies, is a 2D-animated cartoon character with a daytime background inside him. When he met first Night, he did not get along with him because he was different. Until Night found a solution of what other things happen at night, he finally gets along with him to which it is found out that he is identical to Night. When happy, Day emits a rainbow inside him to signify his joy.

==Appearances==
===''[[Day & Night]]''===
Day is introduced as a cartoon character with a computer-animated daytime background inside him as his name suggests. As he goes out for a happy walk in the world around him, he encounters another cartoon character with a nighttime background. Angrily waking him up, the two clash into each other in disgust until Night finds a solution of what is like at nighttime, such as a casino having night lights during nighttime. As he and Night discover many fascinating events in each other, the two realize they are identical each other just as Day receives a nighttime background inside his own body.

==Trivia==
*During Day's argument with Night during the part where Night punches him and tries to knock him down like a tree being chopped down, the lumberjack inside Day's view is actually a cameo of [[Construction Foreman Tom|Tom]], a character from the [[2009]] Pixar animated film, ''[[Up]]''.
