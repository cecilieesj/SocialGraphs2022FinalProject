==History==

He is a regular in detention at [[Middleton High School]]. He appears to get along well with his other detention mates, [[Big Mike]] and [[Junior (Kim Possible)|Junior]].

Vinnie seems to be rather intelligent and in tune with the social norms. He correctly identified [[Dr. Drakken|Dr. Drakken's]] ray as Gravatomic and when Junior states that Kim Possible has a zit, he states that, "Cheerleaders don't get zits."
