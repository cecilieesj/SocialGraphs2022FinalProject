Detective '''Mercedes "Misty" Knight '''is a superheroine from [[Marvel Comics]]. She is commonly an ally of street-level superheroes, notably [[Power Man]]. She appears as a central character in the Netflix TV series [[Luke Cage (TV series)|''Luke Cage'']] and a supporting character in the subsequent miniseries [[The Defenders (TV series)|''The Defenders'']].

She is a police officer investigating the gangs of Harlem lead by [[Cottonmouth]]. As a police officer, she is also able to carefully recreate and reconstruct the crime scene to deduce how the crime took place and find the suspect. After losing her arm in the line of duty, she received a cybernetic arm to continue her job.
==Powers and Abilities==
*'''Master Detective:''' Misty Knight is a highly skilled and highly ranked detective. She is capable of reconstructing a crime scene in her mind simply looking at the photos taken at the scene; judging by Rafael Scarfe's remarks, Knight getting lost in her reconstructions is a common occurrence. She is also able to notice details that other detectives miss, such as [[Luke Cage]] being unharmed despite having bullet holes in his shirt.
