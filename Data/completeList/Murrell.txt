[[File:Murrell.png|thumb|The Remains of Murrell]]'''Murrell''' is the deceased pirate in ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.
==History==
Not much was known about him, but he has treasure chest full of gold. He hid the treasure in the abandoned house somewhere in the middle of the dark forest, made a map to show where the treasure is, put the map in a box with his name on it and hid it in Vic Murrell's coffin. He hid in the forest cave when the army came to get him. However, he got lost in the cave and slowly died.

Murrel's map was kept hidden until [[Injun Joe]], Muff Potter and Dr. Robinson found it in Vic Murrell's coffin at the graveyard. His skeletal remains was suddenly found by Tom and Becky when they accidentally got caved in, and then chased by Injun Joe.
