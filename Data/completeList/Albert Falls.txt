'''Dr. Albert Falls''' is an off-screen character from the [[Jungle Cruise]] attraction at the Disney theme parks. He was first visualized in the [[Skipper Canteen]] restaurant.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Doctor Albert Falls was a scientist, theologian and explorer known for his ability to navigate the remote waters of the rivers of the world and his sense of humor. Among his discoveries were a Sunken Cambodian Temple known to some as the "Shir Lee Temple" on June 5, 1888 and most notably, [[Schweitzer Falls]] and the "backside of water" on August 12, 1891.  He had a wife in fellow-adventurer Victoria Marie Falls with him he had a son named Albert Falls, Jr..

In 1911, he would establish the [[Jungle Navigation Company]], a shipping company he had hoped would improve the way cargo moved up and down remote jungle rivers around the world for his fellow explorers and adventurers. The headquarters of the JNC would also serve as his home, where he would entertain members of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]] in a hidden meeting room located in his library. In fact, he was also a virtuoso pipe organist, known as a Bach interpreter of unique perception and being one of the pioneers of modern historical performance on the pipe organ. 

When his granddaughter Alberta Falls turned eight, she was sent to live with him, as her father recognized an adventurous spirit in her that would not be content with him traveling on the lecture circuit. Albert and his Skippers would become a second family to her.  In [[1927]], Albert mysteriously disappeared and Alberta would become the new president of the Jungle Navigation Company, starting the first "Jungle Cruise" tours in [[1931]].

=== Development History ===
Albert Falls was first mentioned in the attraction as a joke: The discoverer and namesake of Schweitzer Falls, the true namesake being Nobel Prize winner [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer Albert Schweitzer]. When the Jungle Cruise's backstory was expanded in [[2015]] for the [[Skipper Canteen]], it was decided that he be turned into an actual character and the Jungle Navigation Company's founder.  When the Skipper Canteen first opened, the portrait of him in the waiting area was not quite ready. A placeholder painting was hung on the wall instead, a portrait of a former [[New Jersey]] state governor.

== Appearances ==

===[[Adventure Trading Company]]===
The Adventure Trading Company game's "The Daily Gnus" newsletter mentioned him as an honoured recipient of the Elephant Juju in 1903 for his discovery of Schweitzer Falls among other discoveries.

=== [[Club 33]] ===
In the menus for the Tiki Takeover event was a 1940 train-ticket for the Missouri Pacific Railway which documented Dr. Falls as travelling from Chicago to Anaheim.

=== Bengal Barbecue ===
A portrait of Dr. Falls can be seen within a photograph hung within this dining area.  The portrait is in the possession of the characters of Charlie Allnut and Rose Sayer from the [[1945]] film The African Queen.  While being non-Disney, this film was one of the inspirations behind the Jungle Cruise.

=== The Jungle Cruise ===
The doctor is mentioned on the attraction when passing by Schweitzer Falls at which point the skipper identifies the water-feature as having been named for the famous Dr. Albert Falls.

=== Magic of Disney Animation ===
This area of ''Disney's Hollywood Studios'' featured a section themed to [[Minnie Mouse]]'s Hollywood dressing room.  One of the posters was for a film titled, "The Jungle Cruise" which starred herself and Mickey.  On the poster was a crate behind [[Trader Sam]] which had, "Dr. Albert Falls" written on it.

=== Skipper Canteen ===
Books written by him featured in the Skipper Canteen's library include "A Small Village With A Large Heart" and "Rockefeller, Hippo, Pet, Family".

=== [[Trader Sam's]] ===
A bronze bust of Dr. Albert Falls is on a shelf in Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar at the Disneyland Hotel.

=== [[The Tropical Hideaway]] ===
Dr. Falls is one of the SEA members that have contributed to [[The Tropical Hideaway]]'s wall of expedition paddles, with his coming from a 1903 trip on the Mbei River in Gabon.

== Other Appearances ==

The Jungle Navigation Company also appears as [[Frank Wolff]]'s company.

== Trivia ==

*Falls dresses in a pith helmet, an item which is considered to be a signature icon of European colonialism.
