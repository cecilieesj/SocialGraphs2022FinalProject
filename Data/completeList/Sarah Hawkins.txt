'''Sarah Hawkins''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2002]] animated feature film, ''[[Treasure Planet]]''. She is the single mother of [[Jim Hawkins]] and owner of the [[Benbow Inn]]. She is seemingly the only one to work there besides her son, serving all the patrons herself at the beginning of the film.

==Role in the film==
When Jim is brought in by robo-cops, she goes and tells them it will not happen again, scolding him at the same time with the use of her tone of voice. She then tries to convince him to not "throw away his entire future". Later on, she is seen cleaning up the Benbow Inn and confiding in her best friend, Dr. Delbert Doppler, saying that ever since Jim's dad left, he'd never recovered and that he was constantly in trouble and failing in school despite being extremely smart (having built his first solar surfer when he was eight). After this, Sarah is next seen sitting in a chair before Jim brings in dying Billy Bones.

After this, she is pulled up the stairs of the Benbow by Delbert when pirates attack the inn and are taken to Delbert's mansion as the inn is burned down. Here Delbert and Jim try to comfort her, and then when Jim says he's going to go to Treasure Planet, Sarah immediately objects to the idea because it's dangerous. When she tries to get Delbert on her side, he is less than help but ends up helping convince Sarah that they'll be alright before the scene transitions to the spaceport. She later appears in Jim's memories during the song I'm Still Here, to which she is seen holding Jim as a little boy and looking out the window of the Benbow Inn and later seen crying when her husband leaves her and Jim. Sarah isn't seen again until the end, where she is seen first hugging Jim at the spaceport, then at the Benbow's opening, and lastly at the celebration, where she dances with Jim and claps with the music.

==Trivia==
*Sarah's voice actor Laurie Metcalf is also the voice of Andy's Mom [[Jennifer Davis]], in the ''[[Toy Story]]'' film series.
