'''Chunk''' is an orange muscular rock monster toy who appears in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2010]] animated film ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' as one of the tertiary antagonists. He was one of [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s henchmen.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Chunk is a rock-like toy from [[Sunnyside Daycare]]. He has protective shoulder spikes, poseable oversized limbs, and fists ready to smash anyone who gets in his way. He also has a hidden head spike which when pressed down switches his facial expression from friendly to fierce.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Chunk is first seen shaking hands with [[Jessie]] and welcoming [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys to [[Sunnyside Daycare|Sunnyside]]. He is later seen gambling with Lotso's gang inside a vending machine (their secret hideout) and helps Lotso and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] (after he is switched to "Demo" mode) imprison Andy's toys. When he and [[Sparks]] are putting Jessie in a cell later in the film, she kicks them both in the face. Chunk is eventually convinced of Lotso's evil by [[Woody]] and [[Ken Carson|Ken]], and reforms.

In the ending credits, when Sunnyside is turned from a prison into a paradise by [[Barbie]] and [[Ken Carson|Ken]] (who are now the new leaders of Sunnyside after Lotso's defeat), Chunk is shown handling a rough playtime with the toddlers in the [[Caterpillar Room]] as a tag-team with [[Twitch (Toy Story)|Twitch]], later switching places with Twitch so Chunk can rest.

==Trivia==
*Chunk appears to be based on the short-lived Rock Lords toyline from the 1980s.
*[[Jack Angel]], who provided the voice of Chunk, also voiced Rocky Gibraltar and Mr. Shark in the [[Toy Story|first film]].
*Although one of the strongest toys on Lotso's team, he's also the stupidest. When commenting on [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]]'s gullibility during the gambling scene, he tries to say, "He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer," but either he doesn't know what a drawer is or he forgot, instead of saying, "the place where they keep the knives," causing [[Sparks]] to reply, "Neither are you, Chunk!"
