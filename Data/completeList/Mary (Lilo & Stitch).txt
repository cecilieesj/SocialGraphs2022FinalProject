She is designed to be the bouncer for Jumba's [[Galaxy Defense Industries|lab]] and hip-check unwanted guests.

==Appearances==

===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===
Experiment 455 was the 455th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to be the bouncer for Jumba's [[Galaxy Defense Industries|lab]]. 455 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 455's pod landing in a sugar bowl by a [[Kiki's Coffee Hut|coffee shack]].

Later, a woman mistook 455's pod for a sugar cube and dropped it into her coffee, activating the experiment.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
At an unknown point after this, Experiment 455 was presumably captured and named Mary.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Mary was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but she is 536 instead of 455.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Mary, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Mary participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what she did.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Mary can be seen in the audience bouncing. This proves that she rather bounces than walks.

==Trivia==
*Before her name was revealed, most fans thought 455 was male, but 455 is actually female.
*Mary is one of only two 4-series experiments that have their image, name, number, and function confirmed, the other being [[Huggo]]. Interestingly, both debuted in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''.
*Mary seems to always be smiling, but she can be quite vicious as seen in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*Mary's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is red.
*Mary is one of the few experiments to not have her one true place revealed.
*She is also one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''.
*According to [[Jess Winfield]], Jumba briefly considered giving Mary the number "086" as a little joke on Quelte Quan, as to "86" someone means to remove them from the premises, but the number was already taken by [[Clink]].<ref name="WinfieldTVTome">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 17, 2004}}</ref>
