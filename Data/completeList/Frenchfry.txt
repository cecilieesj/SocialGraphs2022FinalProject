He is designed to be Jumba's personal chef and prepare delectable, irresistible meals, but had a flaw in his programming that caused him to remove all nutrition from his cooking, while those who ate his food would bloat up rapidly, after which he would eat them. If the victim managed to escape, the bloating would wear off after 24 hours. His one true place is running a healthy French fry hut and making delicious low-fat food, but his actions have promoted him to a restaurant chef.

==Background==
===Personality===
Frenchfry initially enjoyed causing chaos through his gourmet cooking. Ironically, however, this was not his intentional programming when he was instead to simply be [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s personal chef. He enjoys making food and being complimented for it, appearing friendly and helpful. However, he is actually sneaky and conniving, as he plans on eating the people he feeds by constantly bombarding them with food, even when they try to restrain themselves, knowing they can't resist his food. After being captured by [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and enjoying her oatmeal, he decides to eat healthily and no longer has the desire to eat people, but still retains his love of cooking. He tends to speak [[France|French]] with a heavy accent.

===Physical appearance===
Frenchfry is a small, gray, mustached experiment with four arms with three fingers on each hand, black eyes, a red round nose, short ears, and a spatula for a tail. He has a white bulbous forehead resembling a chef's hat and white markings around his eyes, stomach, tail, and head.

===Powers and abilities===
Frenchfry is a talented chef who can move at lightning speeds and whip up massive meals in seconds, and anything he makes is irresistible and delectable. His foods take up no apparent space in the eater's stomach, regardless of how much, and he originally removed all nutrition from his meals, therefore causing consumers to bloat vastly in size, whom he originally ate once properly fattened. According to Jumba when Frenchfry was his personal chef, the consumer can bloat up to a size of a spaceship. Frenchfry can also morph into a miniature tornado and is skilled with any and every cooking utensil, which he can turn into a weapon.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 062 was the 62nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to be Jumba's personal chef, but instead made unhealthy food that quickly made people fat and overweight, then ate the fattened victims. Presumably, when the food fattened Jumba up to a massive enough size, 062 tried to eat him, but Jumba was able to deactivate him in time. 062 and the other first 624 experiments were later smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 062's pod was found by Jumba and kept hidden away.

After [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] began restricting [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]'s diet to healthy food, she told [[Pleakley]] to feed them the nutritious meals she left in the freezer before heading to work. However, Lilo, Stitch, and Pleakley defied Nani and found 062's pod in a drawer while searching [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s room for a stash of junk food.

When Lilo and Stitch discovered what 062 was created to do, they activated the latter and asked him to make them junk food. 062, named Frenchfry by Lilo, complied but secretly designed the food to fatten Lilo, Stitch, and Pleakley up while being irresistibly delicious, which would culminate in him eating them.

After a while, Lilo grew suspicious of their abnormal bloating, so she and Stitch tried to learn a little more about Frenchfry on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]], although none of its data was helpful to them whatsoever. Frenchfry then distracted the two with a tray of doughnuts, fattening them up even more.

[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] managed to capture Frenchfry at one point by using a "trog call" to lure him out of the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]]. However, after taking a beating from a bloated Lilo and Stitch, Gantu proclaimed that it was his birthday (although he denied this earlier when [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] mentioned it). Frenchfry then made Gantu a cake that he devoured, which fattened him up and caused him to flee in shock.

While Frenchfry continued to make Lilo, Stitch, and Pleakley more bloating food, Lilo called Jumba at a public event to find out more about the chef experiment. However, Jumba just barely finished revealing Frenchfry's true intentions when the latter cut the phone line with a pair of pliers.

Lilo and Stitch finally became so bloated from all the unhealthy food that Frenchfry restrained them and attempted to eat them. Before he could do so, Nani, having heard from Jumba while at work, promptly arrived home and battled and defeated Frenchfry, eventually trapping him under Lilo's wading pool.

The next morning, Lilo and Stitch (back to their trim selves) discovered that Frenchfry had taken a liking to Nani's oatmeal, which Lilo and Stitch initially refused to eat until Nani cleverly enticed them. Thus, they agreed to feed him oatmeal, and in return, he vowed to make healthy meals and not try to eat people.

Frenchfry shortly after found his one true place running a healthy French fry hut, where he made delicious low-fat food.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Frenchfry was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Frenchfry was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 558 instead of 062.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Frenchfry was seen early in the movie giving [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] some low-fat French fries as she was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Frenchfry, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Frenchfry participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by transfixing and hitting Leroys with his spatula.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Frenchfry made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Squeak]], [[Pix]], [[Tickle-Tummy]], and [[Houdini]] after [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] kicked them out for being considered useless. It is shown that Frenchfry's junk food causes people to inflate like balloons, rather than gain weight. Unlike his appearance in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]], he doesn't appear to be motivated to eat others. He is also more easily convinced to make just low-calorie food that won't cause inflation. He then shortly after gets hired at a restaurant to work as a chef. He also appeared in the specials, ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'' and ''Stitch! Perfect Memory''.

==Trivia==
*Frenchfry having been designed to feed and fatten his victims so he can eat them is based on [[Witch (Babes in the Woods)|the witch]] from the fairy tale ''{{WikipediaLink|Hansel and Gretel}}''.
*Frenchfry is one of the few known experiments whose powers Stitch is vulnerable to.
*Frenchfry is one of only four known experiments that wears a hat, the other three being [[Slick]], [[Squeak]], and [[Derrick]]. However, Frenchfry's "hat" appears to be a part of his head, while Slick is wearing a true hat that he can remove, and it is presumed Squeak can take off his hat since he appears with a fresh hat in [[Leroy & Stitch|the TV film finale]] after an earlier incident with the Evil-liminator, while it is unknown if Derrick can remove his hat or not.
*Frenchfry can speak fluent [[France|French]] (roughly a mixture between Parisian and Cajun), despite the fact that Jumba had never been to Earth until after Stitch was created.
**He and [[Carmen]] are the only two known experiments who natively speak an Earth-based language other than English, with him being the only known Francophone (French-speaking) experiment. That said, he can also speak fluent English, as he says "More?" and "Yeah!" in [[Frenchfry (episode)|his debut episode]], and speaks a few more English lines in his anime debut in the English dub of ''[[Stitch!]]''.
*He is also one of the six known experiments to be rehabilitated by someone other than Lilo and Stitch, the other five being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], and [[Snooty]].
**Frenchfry, in particular, was rehabilitated by Nani. He is also is the first and only known experiment that Nani caught.
*Frenchfry's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is white.
*Frenchfry is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''.
*According to [[Jess Winfield]], Frenchfry was originally going to be named "Lardo" at one point.<ref name="WinfieldTVTome">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 14, 2004}}</ref> His original name, "Lardo", is named after a kind of processed meat made out of pork backfat cured with spices such as peppercorns, oregano, garlic, or star anise — and aged anywhere from a couple of months to several years.
