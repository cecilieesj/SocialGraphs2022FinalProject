'''Grandmother''' is one of the wisest and most benevolent of the Children of Oberon. She is one of the major characters in the ''[[Gargoyles]]'' episode "[[Heritage]]".

==Background==
Grandmother spends most of her time in the mortal realm in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in the Haida settlement on Queen Florence Island, where she serves as an advisor to the humans there, and particularly to the chieftain. Whenever [[Raven (Gargoyles)|Raven]] appears to take over the island, Grandmother will advise the chieftain to climb to the top of the trickster's volcano and rout him in battle. She also sees to it that the Haida shall not forget their ancient customs.

Grandmother found herself faced with particular difficulties in dealing with [[Natsilane]], who was a total skeptic about Raven and other matters magical. In the hopes of convincing him that legendary creatures existed, Grandmother transformed into a sea monster, then a thunderbird, in the hopes that he would catch a glimpse of one of them and believe (she had to act as subtly as she did due to [[Oberon]]'s law). However, Natsilane did not see her in either attempt.

Grandmother met up with [[Goliath]] and Angela, who misinterpreted her intentions and fought against her, due to Raven tricking them into believing that Grandmother was an evil sorceress. In the end, however, Grandmother did succeed, with the help of the gargoyles and Elisa, in convincing Natsilane to fulfill his duty. After Raven was defeated in combat, Grandmother restored health to Queen Florence Island.
