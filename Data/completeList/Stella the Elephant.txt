'''Stella the African Elephant''' is one of the deuteragonists of the 2020 [[Disney +]] film ''[[The One and Only Ivan]]''. She has lived in the circus for years and served as a comfort to all the animals—especially [[Ivan the Gorilla|Ivan]].

==Background==
Stella knows that she won't be around forever, and she's trying to think of what needs to be understood for the next generation. She watches a new, young elephant come in, [[Ruby the Baby Elephant|Ruby]] when she was at that time in her life when she knows that she won't have long, but she hopes the little elephant will have a life very different from hers.

Stella tells her niece a story that she got caught in a hole because of that Ruby felt interested upon hearing it, and [[Bob the Dog|Bob]] was quite curious about Stella's stories and she had a good hearted spirit. However, the following day when her leg is aging because of Mack, she told Ivan where to look at Ruby and she took care of her and she peacefully passes away. The death of Stella had an impact across the Big Top Mall causing a big sorrow to the performing animals, including Julia, Bob, and Mack.

===Personality===
Stella was pretty kind and very soft-spoken and she had a good hearted spirit with the performances but with [[Snickers]] she had a wonderful performance and she was a good friend to [[Ivan the Gorilla|Ivan]]. She was very sweet and much appreciated when she hanged out with him.

==Appearances==
===''[[The One and Only Ivan]]''===
As Stella was in the circus, she could have performed Snickers a trick and loved a good performance. She look pretty nice to her and she just said to her. She was doing her tricks as well as her throughout performance. That night, Stella talks to Ivan to know if he loves the moon to which Ivan tells him that he prefers the sun more. Ivan chats with Stella about if she remembers the circus had three shows a day with only standing room to which Stella does remember, much to Ivan's concern that the circus wants an angry gorilla.

The next day, [[Bob the Dog|Bob]] tells Stella and the other the circus animals that a new animal is arriving at the Big Top Mall, to which the new arrival at the circus is Ruby, an elephant calf just as Ruby is accepted into Stella's enclosure. During circus performance, Stella takes her niece Ruby during the show as Ruby is headlined as one of the circus' main attractions as the audience happily gazes upon Ruby. Later, Julia arrives at Stella's enclosure and asks her to know how big the crowds are, to which Julia notices Stella's swollen foot just as Mack and Julia's father George take care of the elephant in her enclosure, just as Stella begins to rest to heal her swollen foot. Later, Stella happily praises Ruby for her performance at the circus to which Stella tells Ruby about her life at the wilds of Africa before she was taken to the Big Top Mall. Throughout the story, Stella explains that she was stuck in very deep mud to which a little girl manages to rescue her from sinking. As Bob arrives, Stella tells him that not all humans are bad. Stella continues explaining to Ruby that there are safe places in environments where animals can roam free just before going to sleep.

The next day, Mack and George notice Stella still with her swollen foot just as Mack calls the vet to take care of Stella, leaving Ruby to perform in solo at the circus. As Stella cannot perform due to her swollen foot, Ivan helps Stella conquer her fear of performing in solo. Stella feels proud that Ruby walked into the circus in solo. After Ivan shares his story with Ruby at night, Stella asks him to take care of her niece in a safe place as a promise just before Stella passes away peacefully. All the performing animals mourn the death of Stella, including Bob, Julia, and Mack, the Big Top Mall's ringmaster who is reading a newspaper headlining an article of Stella's passing as the Big Top Mall mourns the loss of Stella just as he pins the article on the board just before leaving his office. Life for Ruby has become challenging ever since Stella's passing.
