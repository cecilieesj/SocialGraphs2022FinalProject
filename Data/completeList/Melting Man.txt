==Background==
The Melting Man is a slender humanlike monster who lives in Halloween Town with the various other residents living there.

==Appearances==

===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===
The Melting Man was introduced during the musical number "[[This is Halloween]]" where he emerges from a sewer grate after the [[Harlequin Demon]] and [[Wolfman]] are introduced at where the two sing their parts followed by the Melting Man saying "...and slimy green" just before the Wolfman sings his part followed by the [[Big Witch and Little Witch]] appearing together onscreen. Later, the Melting Man and the other citizens of Halloween Town are gathered to watch the Halloween celebration where [[Jack Skellington]] transforms from his pumpkin-headed scarecrow form to his skeleton form to which as Jack is introduced, the Melting Man and the other citizens of [[Halloween Town]] applaud Jack for a Halloween celebration. He then appears with the other citizens attending the town meeting during the "[[Town Meeting Song]]" sequence where he and the other citizens are seen watching Jack's presentation of what he saw at [[Christmas Town]] and as Jack passes by him, he touches him briefly just as he passes by [[Behemoth]] in his seat. After the meeting, the Melting Man and the other citizens applaud for Jack's presentation.

Furthermore, the Melting Man takes part during the "[[Making Christmas]]" sequence along with the other citizens of Halloween Town where he delivers a roadkill turtle to Jack as one of the presents for his plans which Jack denies, explaining to him that the turtle won't make a good gift and that he should try again for a better present.

Later, the Melting Man and the other citizens of Halloween Town watch Jack and his sleigh of [[Skeletal Reindeer]] via well where he delivers Halloween-themed Christmas presents to the children in the real world only to for Jack to be shot down by military units. After Jack has been shot down, the Melting Man and the other citizens mourn after Jack has been shot down by the military after the [[Mayor of Halloween Town]] realizes that the Christmas plan was a bad idea. Although he makes no further appearances after that, Jack, however, returns to Halloween Town where the citizens celebrate his return after defeating [[Oogie Boogie]] and rescuing [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)]] to help save Christmas.
