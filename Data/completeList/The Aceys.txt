'''The Aceys''' are supporting characters in the [[Disney Channel]] movies ''[[Zombies (film)|Zombies]]'', ''[[Zombies 2]]'', and ''[[Zombies 3]]''. They are a trio of cheerleaders that act as underlings to [[Bucky Buchanan]], but later become supportive of [[Zed Necrodopolis]] and [[Addison Wells]].

==Background==

===Personalities===
Collectively, the Aceys are preppy, upbeat and almost cult-like. In the first ''[[Zombies (film)|Zombies]]'' they had unquestionable loyalty towards [[Bucky Buchanan]] and were willing to follow his every word, though this was done to a fault as they were unable to follow up on Bucky's faulty planning. Since then, they have become slightly more independent, yet still loyal to Bucky. They occasionally start to question Bucky's logic and planning, but never abandon him. In the third film, they reveal to Bucky that they accept him as their friend regardless of what or who he is, resulting in earning his respect more.

===Members===
====Lacey====
Lacey is a Caucasian blond haired girl. She is depicted as the stereotypical dumb blond and is ditzy and misunderstands Bucky's instructions. Following the events of the first ''Zombies'', she starts to hang out with Addison more. In a deleted scene, her name before changing was Jenny.

Lacey is portrayed by Emilia McCarthy.

====Stacey====
Stacey is an African-American girl with long curly hair. She is highly competitive and appears to be more intelligent than the other two Aceys. Following the events of the first ''Zombies'', she starts to hang out with Addison more.

Stacey is portrayed by Jasmine Renee Thomas.

====Tracey====
Tracey is a South-Asian boy with tall black hair. He is the more sycophantic of the Aceys and hangs onto Bucky's every word. He is only in the first ''Zombies'' and does not appear in the sequels, possibly because he graduated.

Tracey is portrayed by Mickeey Nguyen.

====Jacey====
Jacey, or Kevin, is an African-American boy. As a new addition to the Aceys, he is not as confident as the others, as evidenced by Bucky renaming him, but appears to be more open minded than the other Aceys.

Jacey is portrayed by Noah Zulfikar.
