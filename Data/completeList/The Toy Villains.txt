'''The Toy Villains''' are a trio of villains who appear in ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' episode "[[How Much is That Rabbit in the Window]]".

==Background==
The first toy is a bear who is similar to [[Winnie the Pooh]].Â He has a blue bowler hat with a black line on it, a red vest, and a blue and yellow striped tie. It is also revealed that his name is Ted. The second is a pink pig who is similar to [[Piglet]]. He has a pink shirt. Some people say that his name is Pinky. The third is a tiger who is similar to [[Tigger]]. He has a dark green sweatshirt, a blue cap, and a broken tail with a bandage wrapped around it. It is also revealed that his name is Vacuum Head.

They make various attempts to get sold instead of [[Rabbit]], who somehow ended up at the toy shop. When Rabbit is eventually bought back by [[Christopher Robin]], the former tells them to keep the tag (which they had ripped after fighting over it) until they become good, and that someone will eventually buy them someday.
