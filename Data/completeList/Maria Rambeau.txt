'''Maria Rambeau '''is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appears in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''. portrayed by [[Lashana Lynch]]. Maria is an Air Force lieutenant and the best friend of [[Captain Marvel]], and the mother of [[Monica Rambeau]].

An alternate version of the character, originating from Earth-838, becomes [[Captain Marvel (Earth-838)|Captain Marvel]], and is featured in ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.

==Personality==
Maria was a brave and headstrong woman with a love of flying, becoming a great pilot like her best friend, [[Captain Marvel|Carol Danvers]]. Maria also had a loving relationship with her daughter, Monica as she raised her on her own without having to marry someone. Although Maria did not believe the existence of aliens at first, she accepted their existence when encountering [[Skrulls]] and helped in the fight against the [[Kree]]. Like Carol, Maria disliked being looked down by others because of her gender and hated being called "young lady." Maria also had a compassionate side where she comforted Carol after the former discovered she had been deceived by the Kree for years, giving Carol the inspiration to always be the strong, independent woman she has always been.

Years after helping Carol in saving the Skrulls, Maria decided to create an organization known as [[S.W.O.R.D.]] to help protect Earth from extraterrestrial threats and kept having a close relationship with Monica as she grew up. When Monica disappeared from the Snap, Maria was optimistic that her daughter would be revived one day; a wish that came true sometime after Maria died of cancer. 

==Appearances==
===''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''===
Maria was the best friend of Carol, and her colleague at the United States Air Force. She lived in [[Louisiana]], with her younger daughter, [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] Because of Carol's strained relationship with her own family, Maria and Carol were close. One day, during one of their missions, Carol goes missing and is presumed dead. Six years pass, and Carol comes into contact with Maria, unaware of her own identity, or who Maria is. Maria is shocked  to see her best friend alive, and Carol explains, she is warrior alien from another planet, in an intergalactic war with shapeshifting aliens, known as [[skrulls]].

===''[[WandaVision]]''===
Maria is revealed in the episode "[[We Interrupt This Program]]" to have founded [[S.W.O.R.D.]] to monitor threats in space. Prior to the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Maria developed cancer and, with Monica at her side, visited a hospital at Louisiana to remove her cancer. However, when [[Thanos]] snapped his fingers and killed off half of the universe, Monica disintegrated into dust before Maria's eyes. Over the next two years, Maria's cancer came back and she eventually died, while believing that Monica would return.

When [[Hulk]] resurrects the fallen during the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Monica resurrects at the hospital and learns of Maria's passing.

==Trivia==
*Maria's codename "Photon" is the name Monica uses as her superhero name in the Marvel comics.
*Like [[Nick Fury]], Maria becomes the director of an organization to help protect the world.
*Maria shares similarities with a character named Marina Renner who is also a single mother and a close friend to Carol Danvers.
