'''Tiffany''' is a character featured on ''[[That's So Raven]]''. She is portrayed by Jodi Shilling.

Tiffany is [[Donna Cabonna|Donna]]'s "personal assistant", and [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]'s primary nemesis in the fourth season. Ever since their first meeting, Tiffany and Raven do not like each other. On Raven's first day working for Donna (in the episode "[[Dues and Don'ts]]"), Tiffany lies to Raven by telling her that Donna Cabonna's office belongs to Raven. They are constantly "competing" to be Donna's favorite assistant.
