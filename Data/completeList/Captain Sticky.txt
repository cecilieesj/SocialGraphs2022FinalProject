'''Captain Sticky''' is the leader of the kindergarteners in ''[[Recess]]''.

==Appearance==

Captain Sticky is a short, slender kindergarten student. He has dark brown hair and wears face paint. He often wears a yellow paper crown on his head and a brown loincloth.

==Personality==

Being the leader of the kindergarteners, Sticky is the one who leads the others in their antics. Like the other kindergarteners, he is hyper and loud, and often chases after the other kids. Despite this, he is on good terms with [[TJ Detweiler|T.J. Detweiler]] and his friends. He was entered in the Kindergarten Derby by [[the Ashleys]].



He remains the leader of the kindergärtners until ''[[Recess: All Growed Down]]'', where he passes his leadership duties to Hector for standing up to Chief Sticky, a new kindergartener who took over.

==Trivia==



*He is the kindergarteners' equivalent of [[King Bob]].
*His real name has never been revealed in the series. He got his nickname from T.J. in "[[The Legend of Big Kid|The Legend of the Big Kid]]" after he's shown eating candy and wiping his hand on himself.

*Although he and the other kindergärtners should have been in first grade in ''[[Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade]]'', he's still shown in kindergarten, with Hector and Tubby in first grade.

*In ''[[Recess: All Growed Down]]'', he lost his title to a new kindergartener named Stinky, but then gave his title to Hector.

*He seems adventurous.
