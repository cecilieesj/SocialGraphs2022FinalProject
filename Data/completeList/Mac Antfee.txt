'''Mac Antfee''' is a minor antagonist featured in the [[Disney XD]] series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''. He was the Norrisville Ninja during the 80s, the former instructor of Ninja Camp, and is currently a motivational speaker. He has an obese companion whose belly is used as a gong.

==History==
When Antfee became the Norrisville Ninja during the 1980s, he was probably heroic and courageous, like most others. But after being the Ninja for more than four years, he started to become aggressive and uncaring and began neglecting his sacred duties. This was evidenced in "[[Stank'd to the Future]]", where Antfee imprisoned [[Dickie]] in a freezer (instead of removing the [[Stank]] possessing him) just so he could have fun at the prom.

Sometime prior to the events of the episode "[[Ninja Camp]]", the [[NinjaNomicon]] removed Antfee from his status as the Ninja, confiscating the [[Ninja Mask]] and the suit along with it. Antfee was incensed at this, and vowed to someday reclaim the mask so he could "kick every butt in Norrisville". Since Antfee exited the book without being mind-wiped, the memories of his time as the Ninja left him crazed and corrupt. Before long, he established his own dojo and training facility so he could recruit his own army and get back at those he believed had ruined his life.

As a teacher, he was very ambitious, conceited, and determined, always aiming to be the best, and considering those who helped other people to be "losers" and "nicewads". Antfee showed no mercy to anyone and would convince his fellow students that he was the one true Norrisville Ninja. Antfee even trained his followers to have a hatred for the Ninja and help reclaim the Ninja Mask in order for him to become unstoppable and wreak vengeance. Antfee's desire for the mask was so extreme, he would even resort to threatening ways (such as holding the Ninja's friend hostage) in order to get his hands on it.

In "[[Enter the Nomicon]] he become as a motivational speaker at [[Norrisville High]].

==Personality==
Becoming the Ninja in the early [[1980]]'s (or possibly the late 1970's, since he graduated in 1985, but was the Ninja for five or six years), Mac was probably similar to most ninjas, courageous and heroic. However, after being the Ninja longer than four years, the usual time, he began to turn into an uncaring, aggressive ninja. This is shown in the first mention of Mac in "Stank'd to the Future", when he was not fulfilling his ninja duty of helping a stanked student because he preferred to have fun at the prom of 1985 instead. Sometime afterwards, as shown in "Ninja Camp," the NinjaNomicon condemned him and prevented him from remaining as the Ninja, taking away the mask. Furious, Mac vowed to get the Ninja Mask back and kick every butt in Norrisville for revenge. Because he never got mind-wiped, the memory of the power of the Ninja Suit corrupted Mac, making him crazy and villainous. He is very ambitious and determined, always desiring to be the best, and thinking people who help others are losers and "nicewads." Randy called him out on "selfish ninja-ing," implying that he disliked him.

Mac Antfee disliked Randy in turn, because according to Mac, Randy did not have the ruthless attitude and skills of a Ninja. Conceited, aggressive, and uncaring, Mac showed no mercy to anyone, and attempted to convince anyone who passed through his training that the Ninja should be destroyed in order to obtain the mask and revenge on the Nomicon. His desire for the mask was so extreme that he would do dark deeds to obtain it, such as holding Howard over a waterfall and threatening to drop him if the Ninja didn't hand over the mask.

After letting go of Howard, he escaped, but vowed to return again and defeat the Ninja. Because he has past experience as the Ninja, Mac knows that fighting him is a bad idea, and built a metal cage that is ninja-proof. Randy, however, tricked him into thinking he had escaped by using a smokebomb and hiding on the ceiling so that he'd open the cage. He has an obese follower that he uses as a "man-gong" by striking him with a foam hand on a stick.

When a good guy, as seen in "Enter the Nomicon", Mac is actually very friendly and caring, wanting to inspire people with his "You-Splosion". Thankful to Man-Gong, and forgiving to Randy and Howard, Mac truly seems to be a changed man, but he still struggles to keep his insane, power-hungry personality back. Once Randy completely mind-wipes him, Mac is permanently nice, suggesting to Man-Gong that they go feed an orphanage, and happily waving good-bye to Randy and Howard.

==Trivia==
*His name shows a lot of similarity with the name of Anti-Virus scanner [[wikipedia:McAfee VirusScan|McAfee]].
*Mac Antfee appears briefly in "Stank'd to the Future" when the Nomicon is explaining to Randy about Dickie.
*He is revealed to be the Ninja of 1985.
*According to himself in "Enter the Nomicon", Mac was the Ninja for six years, an unusual amount of time for a student to be the Ninja.
*Since he says to Randy, "There's no shame in losing to the Class of 85, because we rock!" he almost certainly graduated in that year. He would, at any rate, presumably have to be at least a junior to attend the 1985 Prom. Assuming that he remained the Ninja for two extra years because he had to repeat one or more grades in high school, he probably entered Norrisville High in late [[1979]].
*He is an expy of John Kreese from ''The Karate Kid''.
*He is also similar to Rex from ''Napoleon Dynamite''.
*He did find out that Randy is the ninja in "Enter the Nomicon", but he forgets it after being mind-wiped.
*He might have known McFist, who also went to Norrisville High in 1985, but their relationship is unknown.
*As of "Enter the Nomicon," Mac Antfee is now permanently good.
*He is seen briefly in "Swampy Seconds" in an Ace card when the Nomicon warns Randy that "if he abuses his ninja powers, he will lose them."
*He is the first villain in the whole series to reform.
*His sword, which he used in "Ninja Camp," seems to be a replica of the Ninja's.
**Also, the book he used for the Mac Antfee Loyalty Oath has a similar design to the NinjaNomicon's.
