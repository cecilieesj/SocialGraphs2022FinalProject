Redfeather was dropped from the film for two reasons--the death of his intended voice actor, [[John Candy]], and the decision to have the film's animal characters be mute. He was ultimately replaced by [[Meeko]].

At [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], Redfeather makes an appearance with Meeko and [[Flit]] in the ''Drawn to Animation'' presentation at [[The Magic of Disney Animation]] to help demonstrate the process of character creation. When the host mentions the decision to bring in Meeko and that the turkey "became an entree", he gets transformed into a turkey dinner and Meeko starts chasing him.

== Trivia ==

* Had Redfeather been kept in the film, he would have been the second character in a Disney animated feature voiced by [[John Candy]]. He had previously voiced [[Wilbur (The Rescuers)|Wilbur]] in ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', which, like ''Pocahontas'', was co-directed by [[Mike Gabriel]].
