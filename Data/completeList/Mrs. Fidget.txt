==Role in the Series==
She is a strict parent who has high expectations of her son, as shown when she calls Wendell by his full name just before she appears, and who highly disapproves of her son's spoiled nature and how it makes him a brat and an ingrate as shown when she tells her son, "Wendell, you get what you get and you don't get upset." For Wendell's birthday, she gave her son a magic lute, which he dismissed as a poor gift and tried to use to get what he wanted: Flying horses.

She first appears when Wendell is about to hex the Royal Kids of [[Enchancia]] after [[Jasper]] destroyed the lute. She zaps his wand out of his hand and after Sofia confirms he has been bothering her and her older siblings, demands an explanation. After Wendell blurts out he was trying to get presents, she looks in the cage, sees all the flying horses, and realizes her son has been abusing the lute's magic to steal as many flying horses he could. When he explains why he did that, she tells him off and demands he makes a sincere apology to the Royal Kids for his thievery. After he has done so, she grounds Wendell for his atrocious behavior and confiscates his flying carpet. She also denies him dessert for one week, bans him from crystal ball gazing for two weeks, and to top everything off, she makes him spend the remainder of the day cleaning out the cauldrons. Mrs. Fidget is last seen taking Wendell home in disgust.

==Personality==
Mrs. Fidget is a strict parent who has high expectations of Wendell and disapproves of her son's spoiled nature. She is also a firm believer in personal responsibility and doesn't enjoy being unappreciated for the things she tries to do for her son. She is also shown to have superb deductive prowess.
