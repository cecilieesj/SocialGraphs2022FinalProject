}}The '''Fashionistas''' are characters from the animated television series ''[[Kim Possible]]''. They made their first appearance in the episode "[[Fashion Victim (Kim Possible)|Fashion Victim]]".

==History==
A trio of fashion-obsessed crooks, Chino (the male), Espadrille (female with short, black hair), and Hoodie (female in the hood), are collectively known as the Fashionistas. They operate an organization dubbed "The Fashion Underground," based in Milan, [[Italy]], in which they obtain various new fashion designs, make cheap imitations of them, and sell the counterfeits around the world, thus throwing the fashion world into chaos.

In chronological order, their first appearance is in "Fashion Victim," where they hire fellow fashion lover [[Camille Leon]] to steal [[Club Banana]]'s newest designs. Camille, however, also takes the opportunity to get her personal revenge on [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] in the process, which turns out to be their undoing when Kim turns the tables by posing as Camille and infiltrating their organization.

In "[[Clothes Minded (Kim Possible)|Clothes Minded]]", Kim and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] visit the villainous trio in prison in hopes of convincing them to design Kim's new mission outfit. They design the new clothes for her, but refuse to give up the outfit when Kim's turns down a trade, the design for their freedom. Although they refuse to give Kim the design, Rufus remembers it well enough to get it down on paper for Monique to study and create.

==Personalities==
The Fashionistas are portrayed as villains who have skilled fighter instincts (unlike Camille Leon) and a modern look. We see Chino's high skill at basketball in prison, Espadrille's love of purses, and that Hoodie is the most serious member of the group and can hold her own in a fight against Kim.

The Fashionistas are more concerned at making millions and destroying the fashion market than dominating the world. To that extent, they often hire criminals (like Camille) to aid in their fashion-focused schemes.

==Trivia==
*In the episode "Fashion Victim," when Monique is fighting Espadrille, before the camera focuses on the press, Kim looks exactly like Camille. When the camera comes back, though, she looks normal again.
