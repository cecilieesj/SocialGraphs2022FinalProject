'''Miles''' is a main character of [[Disney Channel Original Movie|Disney Channel's Original Movie]] ''[[Avalon High]]''.  He is the reincarnation of [[Merlin]].

==Role in the Film==
Miles is known for claiming that he considers himself better than others, but has been accused of hiding his insecurities his sarcasm by Allie.

Miles first met Allie when she transferred to Avalon High and became involved in a prophesied re-staging of Arthurian legend. Miles befriends Allie despite his initial protests that she should stay away from him in order to become popular. The same day they met, he had a psychic flash of Allie during a track meet, needing to tie her shoes. Miles was often bullied by [[Marco Campbell]], stepbrother of [[William Wagner]]. Eventually Allie came to believe Marco was the reincarnation of Mordred and determined to kill Arthur (Will), Miles believed she was correct.

Miles experiences more visions and becomes better friends with Allie. On the night of the football game Miles and Allie attend in an attempt to protect Will as the prophesied eclipse and meteor shower take place. At half time, Will disappears from the game. Miles and Allie go in search and for the first time, Miles uses his psychic power at will to find him.

Going to the school theater, they find an injured Marco outside and Will inside the theater. Mr. Moore then arrives and reveals that he is really Mordred and that Marco was actually a member of the Order of the Bear who was sworn to protect Arthur, and had been trying to gain Mr. Moore's trust. Mr. Moore (Mordred) then attacks the group. Allie grabs a prop sword to stop Mr. Moore, but it transforms into Excalibur, revealing that she is the real reincarnation of King Arthur, much to Miles and Mr. Moore's surprise. Mr. Moore and Allie duel in an alternate reality, where Miles (now revealed to be Merlin) is also present and helps her during the fighting. With the help of Merlin, Allie defeats Mordred.

Back in the theater, Miles and the others are able to escape and Mr. Moore is detained.

== Personality ==
Miles is snarky and slightly proud/arrogant (depending on how you look at it). Though he shuns society, he doesn't truly like being so different, as is evident when he says: "I'm already enough of a nerd Allie, the last thing I need is something else making me different."
