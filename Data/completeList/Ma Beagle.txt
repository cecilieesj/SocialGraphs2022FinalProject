'''Ma Beagle''' is a recurring antagonist from ''[[DuckTales]]''. She is the mother of the [[Beagle Boys|Beagle Boy]] criminals and the matriarch of the gang.

==Biography==
Ma Beagle always bails out her sons by providing cakes or other goods with means of breaking out of prison hidden inside. She's far more competent than her children, but even then tends to fail because [[Scrooge McDuck]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews]] always find a way to outwit the Beagle Boys.

An interesting note regarding Ma Beagle is that whenever she appeared in the first season, she was often the only Beagle to escape successfully. This trait notably seems to disappear in the later seasons. In the second season premiere, "[[Time is Money]]", it is implied that she was eventually arrested; when [[Big Time Beagle|Big Time]] disguises himself as an elderly woman, [[Burger Beagle|Burger]] initially mistakes him for Ma, saying "She must've broke out of jail!" Additionally, two episodes in the show's later seasons, "[[The Bride Wore Stripes]]" and "[[New Gizmo-Kids on the Block]]", end with Ma Beagle being arrested and going to jail.
