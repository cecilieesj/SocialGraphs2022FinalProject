He is the leader of the [[Frost Empire]], an organization set on conquering the galaxy using much of the TTA's routes and equipment.

==Background==

===Personality===
S'Leet is comparatively petty compared to the average villain, but unlike [[Gadfly Garnett]] is not motivated purely by greed. Comparatively, he is very pragmatic and practical, often taking the initiative to ensure that his enemies can't retaliate against him if he can help it. He is also strict with his underlings, and tolerates their foolishness to a bare minimum. However, although he bemoans their antics, he does care for them mainly due to their extreme loyalty and will take the necessary measures to save them, even if he dreads what some of them entail.
===Physical appearance===
Especially compared to his underlings, {{PAGENAME}} is much taller and slender, giving him a much more humanoid figure than [[Blizzbert and Flurrbo]] alike. His skin is icy blue with his head having protrusions resembling snow in the form of hair (both on his head and his face). He wears dark blue clothing, mainly a long cloak, and a dark blue questcom-like device on his right forearm.
===Powers and abilities===
S'Leet has the ability to turn his body into a flurry of snowflakes, allowing him to travel much faster than normal and to fit through tight openings.
==Appearances==
{{PAGENAME}} made his first appearance in the episode ''[[The Pluto Rescue]]'', where he uses a gravity generator to give Pluto more planet-like levels of gravity to make it the new base for the Frost Empire. Unfortunately for S'Leet, the Callisto children were with their aunt, [[Frida Liang]], exploring Pluto at the time, and were soon able to uncover and stop his plot. He and his underlings were later arrested by the end of the episode, but later escaped custody.
