'''Boscha''' is a character in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
Boscha is a potions student who attends [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] with [[Amity Blight]], [[Willow Park]], and [[Gus Porter]]. She is a typical teenage girl who is mean to those she looks down upon and is the bossy ringleader of her friends. She is often seen hanging out with her friends or reviewing/updating her Penstagram account. She is the captain of the school grudgby team, and is overly proud of her abilities. Despite being "friends" with Amity, Amity actually dislikes Boscha and the others because they are cruel, and because her parents forced her to be friends with people like Boscha and Skara because they are from upper-class, rich families, unlike Amity's former friend Willow, who wasn't the most skilled witch. When Amity isn't around, Boscha is the leader of the clique.

===Physical appearance===
Boscha has a slender figure with pink skin, light grey eyes, and violet hair tied back in a bun. Like most witches on the Boiling Isles, she has pointy ears but also has a third eye on her forehead. When attending school, Boscha wears a gray tunic with a dark gray belt, hoodie, and boots. As part of the Potions track, the color of her sleeves and leggings are yellow.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Magic:''' Boscha is a powerful magic user for a girl of her age. Like all witches, her connection comes from a sac of magic bile attached to her heart. She can cast the [[Spell Circle]] to cast spells. Occasionally she uses her magic to bully or show dominance.
*'''Staff:''' Boscha originally wanted her own palisman instead of adopting a "hand-me-down". However, she was approached by crab palisman named Maya, drawn by her ambition to play professional grudgby. Despite what she said before, she accepted Maya as her palisman.

==Role in the [[The Owl House|series]]==
===Season One===
Boscha is considered a top tier student at [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] and was part of [[Amity Blight]]'s social clique. Having a high opinion of herself, she is not afraid of belittling and putting down others she deems unworthy of being a witch. Over time, she begins to see her social status getting threatened, in part, due to the human [[Luz Noceda]]'s influence. She learns that she along with other "weaker" students [[Willow Park]] and [[Gus Porter]], perform a rather elaborate ceremony that involved uprooting the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] and making it walk. Furthermore, she is challenged by [[King (The Owl House)|King]], who had swapped bodies with Luz, to a race that resulted in her clubhouse getting destroyed and her body getting switched with a guard and one of her fellow classmates. Her friendship with Amity quickly fell apart with Boscha getting mocked by her once close friend for still acting childish and being a bully towards others. Boscha faces off against Luz, Amity and Willow in a grudgby match, a sport that she is the captain of, and wins, but loses the respect of her teammates when Willow showed better sportsmanship.

===Season Two===
Boscha is present when [[Odalia Blight]], Amity's mother called Luz, Amity, Gus, and Amity to [[Principal Bump]]'s office. She is later seen getting her own Palisman named Maya due to her long goal being wanting to play personal grudgby. When Luz failed to get her own palisman, she even asks her if she can do magic in the human realm. Boscha is present when Luz was filming a video for her mother. Additionally, she begins to lose her hold on the school; with Luz and Amity outright ignoring her as she attempts to get their undivided attention. It is unknown what happen to Boscha when Hexside decided to join the rebellion to stop the Day of Unity.

==Relationships==
===[[Amity Blight]]===

[[File:Wing It Like Witches (5).png|thumb|250px|Boscha gets put in her place by Amity.]]
As revealed in "[[Understanding Willow]]", Boscha became friends with Amity purely out of the latter's parents' insistence, most likely to retain some social status. Due to this, it is heavily assumed that their friendship was mostly artificial and based on how they "needed" to be perceived by those around them. Boscha seemed to genuinely enjoy her time with Amity as they made fun of other students, but she slowly began to become more dominant while Amity slowly became more entranced with Luz's social circle. Boscha began to notice that Amity had changed since the events of "[[Enchanting Grom Fright]]", telling Luz that Amity had "gone soft", but actually seemed happy to take her place as "boss". By "[[Wing It Like Witches]]", Boscha had officially cut off her friendship with Amity, claiming that her social life was destroyed because of how Luz affected her. Boscha also seems to resent Amity's relationship with Luz in "[[Any Sport in a Storm]]". As they walked away, holding hands and ignoring Boscha, she yelled out to them they are not cute.

===[[Luz Noceda|Luz]], [[Willow Park|Willow]], [[Gus Porter|Gus]], and [[King (The Owl House)|King]]===
Boscha sees Luz as a stain on her social life and sees everyone associated with her as peons. Much like others who do not understand Luz's background or history, she feels threatened by how her ways have affected those around her, specifically the "order" that has been kept since before she arrived. Her other target to torment is Willow, who she would jeer with Amity by calling her "Half-A-Witch-Willow". When Willow's status began to rise and she became more sociable, Boscha did everything she could to retain her place on top, unaware that it was painting a bad light on herself. While not directly stated, she also views Gus in the same fashion as Willow and Luz. Boscha also indirectly despises King who had made a mockery of her in "[[Once Upon a Swap]]". Though ironically, she was a huge fan of his novel in "[[Sense and Insensitivity]]".

===Hexside classmates and faculty===
Boscha's main goal is pleasing her school of which she is clearly passionate about. She has a good repertoire with the adults of the school who do not mind her more radical decisions. She has a clutch on her classmates and has her own social circle consisting of Skara, Cat and Amelia, all of whom were friends through Amity. Since Amity abandoned them for Luz, Boscha has been close with her friends, though based on how Amity was friends with her through force, it is possible that the same might be said for the others.

==Trivia==
*Boscha is most likely named after Hieronymus Bosch, a painter whose works inspired the show's art style.
*Her eyebrows have a tendency to disappear and reappear. This is possibly an artistic choice on the part of the animators as it usually happens based on her emotional state.
