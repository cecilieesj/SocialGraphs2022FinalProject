==Background==
They are a group of lemurs. They like to eat bamboo. However, when they meet up with [[Heng Heng]], they argue over who get to eat a single bamboo stand. The Lion Guard show up and take them to [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] who settles the issue by ordering that Heng Heng and Kely's troop take turns.

Each lemur seen in Kely's troop is a gentle lemur (aka bamboo lemur). Each of them are slender with orange and gray fur with brown eyes.

==Role in the series==
==="[[The Lake of Reflection]]"===
Kely's troop plays an important role in this episode. As the Lion Guard (this time only with [[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Ono]], [[Beshte]], and [[Anga]]) goes on patrol, the group overhears Kely's lemur troop arguing with a panda named Heng Heng. As the Guard looks at the dispute, Kely introduces himself to the group, telling about what Heng Heng is doing with the lemurs' routine. The dispute between the panda and the lemur troop is interrupted as the Guard takes the group to Rani to solve the problem. Just as the Guard, the lemurs, and Henge Heng approach her, she gives the quarreling animals about shifting routines as a compromise - the lemurs get to do their routine first and the pandas do their routine next. After accepting the compromise Rani gives them, Heng Heng takes the lemurs back to the bamboo forest with the problem solved.

==="[[Triumph of the Roar]]"===
The lemurs of Kely's troop are one of the victims during an ambush caused by [[Makucha's Army]]. Fortunately, [[Kion]] who practiced controlling the [[Roar of the Elders]], manages to save Kely and the rest of the lemurs from a gruesome demise.
