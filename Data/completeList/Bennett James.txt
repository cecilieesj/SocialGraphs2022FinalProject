He is a child psychologist for a living and thought of adding a dog to the family, which came along [[Stan Mordecai James|Stan]]. He is not a very strict parent, but can sometimes surprise you in a lot of ways—which is not a good thing.

==Personality==
Bennett is the father of the Jennings/James family. He is a big-time child psychologist who has written several books, however, he is kind of a goof ball. He always thinks he knows the best way to handle everything, and comes up with some pretty unusual ways to deal with family issues. He always thinks of [[Chloe James|Chloe]] as a princess, himself as a king, and Ellen as a queen.

==Character History==
===Season 1===
In "[[Stan of the House]]", Bennett got the kids a dog because they were not bonding very well. Stan introduced him as "Bennett James. A little full of himself. Sniffs his butt. Not impressed". He later chewed the kids out for not taking care of Stan properly after he ran away.

In "[[The Fast and the Furriest]]", Bennett brought [[Tyler James|Tyler]] home with his learners permit. He then gave Tyler a driving lesson, but was extremely strict and gave him too much coaching.
