'''Maybe''' is a character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2018]] animated feature film, ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''. He is the longstanding and long-suffering assistant of [[Yesss]].

==Background==
Maybe works alongside Yesss for the video sharing website [[BuzzzTube]]. He is charged with keeping track of what's trending and what isn't. True to his name, he has an indecisive personality.

===Physical appearance===
Maybe is a tall, slender netizen with lavender skin, a pointed nose that curls upward, neatly-styled purple hair, and magenta glasses. Unlike Yesss, who has five fingers, he has only four fingers. Maybe is well-dressed, wearing a white short-sleeved button down shirt with purple rectangles, a purple bow tie, magenta pants and vest with triangular patterns, and dark dress shoes. 

==Role in the film==
Maybe first appears when Yesss shows him the videos found on BuzzzTube where she disagrees on the videos delivered. When Ralph and Vanellope enter Yesss' office, she encourages Maybe to send the two out of her office. Instead of trying to send the two out, Maybe shows Yesss the video with 1.3 million hearts of Ralph in the Slaughter Race video game area in which Vanellope explains that Shank was the one who made the video to help the two earn money for a replacement of the steering wheel for Sugar Rush at Litwak's Arcade. When Ralph wants to be popular in the videos shown in BuzzzTube, Maybe shows Yesss the trending videos in BuzzzTube where Ralph decides to participate to earn more money. He later appears riding on a jet-like web browser while Yesss tells Ralph not to worry about Vanellope being sat next to Maybe while Ralph decides to continue the viral video plan as he and Vanellope leave while Yesss takes Vanellope to another site called "[[Oh My Disney]]". He is never seen again afterwards.
