While attempting to teach Anastasia and Drizella how to sing, LeFoof would've become infuriated, because the barnyard animals would've begun to raise a racket and make horrible noises, which he'd have thought the girls were making fun of him. By the time [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] came in with the ball invitation, LeFoof would've stormed out in a rage.
