== Appearances ==

=== Disney Kingdoms ===
In [[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]], Fritz's temper ends up setting several events into motion. Clashing with Jose's out of control ego leads to his attempts at a solo career and the eventual break-up of the band. Additionally, when intern Chip's attempt at subbing for Jose results in disaster, Fritz fires him and the human ends up trying to start his own Tiki island resort.

Eventually, he and the others come together to help rescue Michael, resulting in the band's reformation.
