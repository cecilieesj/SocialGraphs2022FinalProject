'''Aadam''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character, who appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. He made his debut in the [[Destined|third episode]] of the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'', and is portrayed by Ali Alsaleh.

Aadam is a member of the [[Clandestines]]. He is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]], who was exiled to Earth, and has been searching a way to return home, ever since. He and the other members of the group sought [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]], who possessed the key in their returning home, in the form of her [[bangle]]. When she initially refused to help them, she was pursued by Aadam, and the other Clandestines, but they were arrested by Damage Control. The group broke out, where they followed Kamala back to Karachi, and he was ultimately killed, in a battle with [[Red Dagger]].

Aadam is based on Adam Destine, who was created by Alan Davis.

==Background==
Aadam is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]]. He, [[Najma]], [[Aisha]], [[Fariha]], and [[Saleem]], are collectively known as the [[Clandestines]]. Unknown circumstances lead to their exile. On Earth, they were left in a weakened state, and unable to access Noor to its full extent.

He and the other Clandestines learn from a man in a temple that they need to find two bangles, which will allow them to return back to their home dimension.

In British Occupied India, 1942, Aadam goes on look out, while the other members of the group search the ruins of an old underground cave. During their search, the group finds one of the [[bangle|bangles]], but Aadam is forced to call upon Fariha and Saleem, when the British arrive, to stop the group, by setting the cave on fire.

The Clandestines manage to escape from the Army's grasp, but are unable to locate Aisha, who disappeared with the bangle. They continue to go on the run.

At some point, Najma has a son, with a human, whom she names [[Kamran]]. Kamran joins their ranks, and Aadam becomes acquainted with him.

When [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]] puts on the bangle, she unlocks her access to Noor, and Aadam and the other Clandestines are able to sense her, discovering that Aisha had kin, of this world.

===Powers===
*'''Noor Manipulation''': As a [[Djinn]], Aadam has the power to manipulate Noor, also known as light, contained within all Djinns. Outside of her home dimension however, he is unable to access it to its full potential.
**'''Noor Sensing''': Aadam is able to sense the Noor within others. When [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]] puts on a [[bangle]] that activates her powers, Aadam becomes aware of her presence, and is able to locate her. Once he broke out of the D.O.D.C. Supermax Prison, Aadam was able to track her whereabouts in Karachi, Pakistan.
**'''Longevity''': The Noor within Aadam slows down his aging, and keeps her from growing old at a regular rate.
**'''Super Strength''': Aadam observes strength which goes beyond normal capabilities. While attempting to punch Kamala, he misses her, and hits the ground instead, leaving a cracked dent in place. He also swung his mace with such force, that it managed to break through a wall.

===Weapons===
**'''Mace''': Aadam possesses a pendant attached to his chain, which can transform into a mace. It is his primary weapon, in line of attack.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Clandestines.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
[[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] arrives in Aadam's home, after [[Najma]] and [[Kamran]], rescue her from the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]]. Kamala then learns from Najma, the shared Clandestines brief history with her grandmother, before she disappeared. Aadam arrives in the room, singing along to a video, and [[Fariha]] comments on how he picks the stupidest parts of humanity to obsess over, which offends him. Kamala observes their youthful appearances, after noting they’ve been around for many years, and Aadam points out that Kamran is only seventeen. Najma reveals that Kamran thinks Kamala is adorable, and Aadam comments on how awkward it must be for him, as he and the others begin to tease him over his apparent crush.

Days later, Aadam learns from Najma that Kamala is having doubts in helping them return home. He and the [[Clandestines]] arrive at the venue where Kamala is, to force her in helping them.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Clandestines Ready to Attack.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Aadam follows Kamala into the kitchen, and punches out a staff member, as he walks towards her. He aims a punch in her direction, but she dodges his attack, and escapes the group’s sights. He and the others, roam through the kitchen, waiting for her to come out. Aadam walks down and taps the pendant on his necklace, which transforms into mace. When Najma bangs a pan against some pots, Kamala is startled by the noise, and creates a light shield, altering the group to her presence, and Aadam swings his weapon at her, sending her crashing through a wall, into the main hall. Aadam uses his mace to further destroy the wall, as he walks through to capture her. They collectively attack Kamala, but she blocks their strikes with her shield. She removes a tablecloth, and throws it over Aadam, and tries to escape, before hurtling onto a table. Kamala creates a giant elongated arm, and knocks back Aadam and the others, as she tries to leave with [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]]. Aadam blocking their way, and the other Clandestines join him, to surround the pair. Suddenly, Damage Control sweeps the building, and an agent knocks out Aadam, with the hilt of his weapon. The organization proceeds to arrest the Clandestines.

The Clandestines are escorted into the D.O.D.C. Supermax Prison, where they are taken into custody. They are handcuffed to the railing, and walk in line, by the lead of the guards. A scuffle between the guards and the other Clandestines ensues, resulting in the guards being rendered unconscious. Aadam and the others become free themselves from the restraints and exit the prison, but leave Kamran behind, on Najma's orders.

The group track Kamala in Karachi, Pakistan, and arrive in pursuit of her. They break into the headquarters, of the [[Order of the Red Daggers]], through the glass ceiling. Adam briefly battles the [[Red Dagger]], but he escapes through the entrance, which [[Waleed]] barricades. Aadam attempts to break through the glass wall separating them and gives several strikes, but Waleed pushes him away.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Clandestine Chase Kamala.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Aadam and the Clandestines follow Kamala, Waleed and Red Dagger, as their fight spills onto the streets. As they get into an auto rickshaw to escape, Aadam and Fariha commandeer an incoming truck, and chase after them. Aadam drives the vehicles, recklessly passing through the street, and crashing into several things on the side. He manages to turn the rickshaw onto its side, causing it to propel against the trucks speed. He keeps further driving ahead, and Kamala creates a construct on the road, in the form of a upward slide, which the trucks drives into, toppling it over.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x04 - Seeing Red - Aadam and Fariha Strike.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Aadam and Fariha exit the truck and follow Kamala and the Red Dagger into a closed courtyard, full of laundry, hung on clothing lines. They burst through the clothes, and Aadam attempts to strike down Red Dagger with his mace. Red Dagger drops him onto the ground, and he delivers a blow with his weapon, onto Red Dagger's chest. Kamala grabs onto Aadam's shoulders and jumps over, flipping him against the ground. Aadam recovers and resumes his attacks on Red Dagger, but his opponent cuts the clothes lines, rendering him unable to see. In the midst of the chaos, Red Dagger strikes Aadam in the back, killing him.

==Trivia==
*Aadam appears to be a fan of [[Zoe Zimmer]]'s video content.
