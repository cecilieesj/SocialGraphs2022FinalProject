'''Professor Zachaias Fleeber''' is a character from the ''[[Sofia the First]]''Â episode "[[Her Royal Spyness]]". He is voiced by [[Chris Parnell]].

==Role in the Series==
Professor Fleeber is considered the world's top expert on sealians. However, as he reveals to [[Princess Amber]] and [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]], everything he wrote about sealians is based on stories he heard from sailors who sailed through the Stormy Triangle. When he found out that nobody had actually seen a sealian, he sailed to the Stormy Triangle to find some sealians and learn about them.

Professor Fleeber makes his debut appearance in "[[Her Royal Spyness]]". He first appears when Princess Sofia and Princess Amber arrive on his island. The two girls tell him that their mother was lured away by a sealian and he agrees to help them find her. When he spots some sealians, he supports Sofia's decision to follow them. Suddenly, a storm starts blowing and blows the girls into a ship where they find their mother. Fleeber gets on board and reveals to a frightened Sofia and Amber that the "sealian" is really a human. Suddenly, the sealians from earlier arrive and lead them out of the storm. Fleeber meets the other sealians, who agree to let him learn about them.
