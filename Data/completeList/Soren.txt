===''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''===
During the Kree-Skrull War, she hid in [[Mar-Vell]]'s Laboratory with her daughter and other Skrull refugees. To be found in 1995 by [[Talos]], [[Captain Marvel|Carol Danvers]], [[Nick Fury]], and [[Maria Rambeau]]. She was temporarily brought to [[New Orleans]], Earth with her family. Soon after, Danvers took them and the other refugees to a safe planet away from the [[Kree]].

===''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''===
Both Soren and Talos were contacted by Nick Fury and possibly [[Maria Hill]] to take their place for a time while they were out for unknown reasons, with Soren impersonating Maria. During this time, she and her husband were fooled by [[Mysterio]], who pretended to be a interdimensional hero who fought [[The Elementals]].

==Trivia==
*Sharon Blynn was uncredited for her appearance in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.
*[[Cobie Smulders]] revealed in an interview with ''{{WPS|The Hollywood Reporter}}'' that she went through the entire production of ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' under the impression that she was playing the real [[Maria Hill]]. The fact that Hill was Soren in disguise was revealed to her by [[Kevin Feige]] a week before the film's release. The footage of her and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the car just prior to the reveal was shot for another scene that ended up getting cut.
