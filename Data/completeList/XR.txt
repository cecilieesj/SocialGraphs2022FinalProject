His name stands for "experimental ranger." He was introduced in the movie ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]'' when he was built by the [[Little Green Men|LGM's]] as a possible partner for [[Buzz Lightyear]] because being a robot, he could be rebuilt if destroyed.

==Background==
XR originally had a very absent personality and was only programmed to learn from Buzz. On his first mission with Buzz, to try to protect the LGMs' Unimind from [[Emperor Zurg|Zurg]], he was destroyed by [[Warp Darkmatter]]. He was rebuilt by the LGMs, but since Zurg captured the Unimind, the LGMs' ability to rebuild him was inhibited, resulting in XR being rebuilt with a very human personality.

XR considers [[Commander Nebula]] to be his father because Commander Nebula unknowingly signed the papers to authorize XR's construction. XR constantly calls Commander Nebula "Dad", which annoys Nebula considerably.

XR has an "older brother" named [[XL]], who was a failed forerunner model to XR. XL escaped Star Command and rebuilt himself using stolen parts and was a reoccurring villain throughout the series. XL, towards the end of the series, returned from evil and became good by turning on [[NOS-4-A2]], the energy vampire. He was then employed at Star Command where he became an office managing robot.

XR has a taste for the high life. As a result he enjoys money, partying, dancing, beautiful women, and anything luxurious.
