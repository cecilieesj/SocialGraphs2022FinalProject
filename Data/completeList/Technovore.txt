Later A.I.M. used Technovore to take revenge on [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. When A.I.M. released Technovore in [[Stark Industries]], it went after Tony's arc reactor in his body and fought both Tony and [[Maria Hill]]. After War Machine was used by James, Technovore went after him. When Technovore dragged War Machine to the arc reactor, Iron Man in the Mark IX armor used Technovore to consume the energy of the reactor and to deactivate the bombs as well. Technovore then exploded due to consuming too much energy.
