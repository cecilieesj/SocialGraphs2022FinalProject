She's the royal advisor's daughter, who has extensive knowledge about Kinkow's history.
==Personality==
Mikayla's sassy, bossy, strong, and self-confident. She also seems to have great skill at hand to hand combat. She promised to have the kings stay away from trouble. She first appeared celebrating the return of the twin kings. She then shows a tour of the castle to them. Ever since the first episode the twin kings liked her. Boomer thinks she's pretty but Brady has a big crush on her and has shown it in every episode. She is also the best trained security member on the island, other than her father, Mason, and is left in charge whenever he must leave. In "Big Kings On Campus" she said to Brady and Tristan that she got a scar on her neck from tackling a crocodile. Mason, the hero of Kinkow, is Mikayla's father. She likes King Brady, despite being confused about what really feels. She kisses him in The Evil King.

She has superpowers, like super-strength, super-speed, and she can talk like a dolphin. She also can sneeze out a gallon of snot in a second.

==History==
Mikayla first met Brady and Boomer when they first entered the castle. She showed them to their room, Brady almost said she was beautiful, but said the pool table was beautiful. Mikayla said they had to read a book and left. She talked to Mason outside of the castle, when Lanny planned on how to get rid of Brady and Boomer.

On the day of the Surf Contest, a light shined on Brady, causing him to jump on his brother's back, then Mikayla found out that two of Hibachi's friends were helping Hibachi cheat. While Mikayla knocked Hibachi's friends out, Mason turn Brady and Boomer's accidental actions in a motive for applause of everyone.

Mikayla tried to get her dad to put her in charge, when Brady and Boomer flirted with mermaids. Her father decided to put Roger in charge, which angered her, but she proved her abilities were outclassed by Roger's. Mikayla advised Brady and Boomer to stay away from the mermaids, but the two ignored her orders and the mermaids took over the castle. The mermaids proceeded to turn Mikayla into a mermaid. She was turned back to normal when the twins learned that to turn a mermaid back to normal all you need is to spray them with salt water.

==Quotes==
*"And now we have a king called 'Boomer.'" 
*(After talking to Roger) "We need girl guards."
*"Oh, my dad's going to freak."
*"Watch me do my thing."
*"Leave at once or face the consequences."
*"So, uh, when they threw toast at you this morning, was the toaster attached?"
