'''Chris Taylor''' is a character in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''. He is partners with [[Captain America]].

==Biography==
Chris wins an invitation to see the first showing of Stark Enterprises' DISKs, small devices to imprison villains in a codified form. After [[Loki Laufeyson]] captures [[Avengers|the Avengers]] and other heroes in DISKs, Chris and other four kids are affected by a defective bio-code that allows them to briefly summon the heroes from the DISKs via a D-Smash. Chris's bio-code allows him to D-Smash Fight heroes like Cap.

Chris is a rebellious teenager, and has trouble dealing with the more rule-abiding Captain America. On the other hand, Chris reminds Cap to his deceased sidekick Bucky.
