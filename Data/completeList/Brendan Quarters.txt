'''Brendan Quarters''' is [[Margot Yale]]'s husband.

==History==
Brendan Quarters was born in [[1962]].[http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=7651] Like Margot, Brendan has encountered the [[Gargoyles (creatures)|gargoyles]] many times, alongside her, and appears to be fairly scared of them. His occupation is currently unknown. [http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=5303] He is frequently subjected to Margot's sharp tongue and seems to be quite the henpecked sort.

Brendan may not be as hostile towards gargoyles as his wife. When [[Thailog]] stabbed [[Goliath]] during the Halloween Masque at the [[Eyrie Building]], Brendan, who was costumed as a gargoyle, witnessed the battle and alerted Dr. Sato that somebody needed medical help. ''("Bash")'' [http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/comment/archive/index.php?archive_date=2007-07-23]

Like his wife, Brendan is a protestant Christian. [http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=5322]
