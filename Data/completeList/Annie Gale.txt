She had a love affair with [[Oz|Oscar Diggs]] in the past, but it is clear the both of them are still fond of each other. Much like her [[Land of Oz|Oz]] counterpart, [[Glinda the Good Witch of the South|Glinda]], she encourages him to realize the goodness in himself.

==Appearances==
===''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''===
After his disastrous show, Oscar is told by Frank that a certain lady-friend has come calling, he sees Annie and welcomes her into his caravan for tea. She him that she watched the show and was sorry for what happened. She then explains that a local man named John Gale has asked for her hand in marriage, but she wants Oscar's advice on what she should do. He halfheartedly tells her that John is a good man and she should accept his proposal. Nonetheless, she tells him that she knows he is capable of both goodness and the greatness he has always dreamed of, he must only embrace it.

Annie later marries John and becomes the mother of [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]. John is the brother of [[Uncle Henry]] .

*Annie serves as counterpart to Glinda, as Frank was with [[Finley]] and the girl in the wheelchair is with [[China Girl]].
*Given that Dorothy is commonly depicted as an orphan at the time of her adventures in Oz, it is unknown if Annie or John will appear in any sequel.
*Annie wears a gingham dress, a pattern famously associated with Dorothy.
