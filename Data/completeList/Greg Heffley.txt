{{Quote|Okay, first of all, let me get something straight: This is a journal, not a diary.|Greg Heffley}}
'''Gregory "Greg" Heffley''' is the titular protagonist of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' and its upcoming [[2022]] [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules|sequel]]. He is the kid who dreams of becoming rich and famous, but he was stuck in middle school with morons surrounding him. He has a best friend named Rowley Jefferson.

== Background==
===Personality ===
Greg has a high opinion of himself. As he says at the beginning of the movie, as well as the books, he believes that he is surrounded by stupid people and that one day he will achieve greatness. He can be neurotic and sometimes nervous over certain things that may not be a big deal for adults, but is absolutely paramount for other kids. Greg can sometimes come off as being bossy or controlling, but is an overall good kid who is usually ends up doing the right thing. He cares deeply for his best friend, Rowley and goes out of his way to protect him from harm, unaware of the fact that he fits in just fine with their current middle school situation. Greg is a down-to-earth kid who still enjoys the typical things that all little kids his age likes.

===Physical appearance===
Greg has a wire thin frame and a round bulbous head with a small tuft of hair that resembles a waterspout. His clothing consists of a plain white shirt, black shorts, and white sneakers.

==Trivia==
* Greg has been portrayed by two actors prior in live action. First by [[Zachary Gordon]] (2010-2012) and then by Jason Drucker (2017).
