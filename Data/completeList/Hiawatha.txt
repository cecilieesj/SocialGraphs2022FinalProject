==Appearances==
===''[[Little Hiawatha]]''===
Hiawatha is first seen rowing in his canoe across the canoes across the falls of Minneha'ha. Encountering a bluebird and a robin, Hiawatha prepares to fire his arrow but the animals tell them not to hurt them. Upon passing through a whirlpool, Hiawatha arrives on a stop and falls on water where the raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, and other woodland creatures laugh at him. Approaching the animals, Hiawatha tries to fire his arrow at them but they end up running away. Hiawatha sees strange animal tracks to which he sees a grasshopper he is about to hunt. Hiawatha attempts to take him down but the grasshopper fools him and later chases a small rabbit to which he surrounds him as he attempts to take him down but instead shoos him away in which the rabbit is reunited to his family due to his big heart, as he spares the innocent rabbit.

Upon sparing the rabbit, Hiawatha breaks his arrow as the animals cheer for him that he will not harm any other animal he encounters. He accidentally encounters a bear cub alongside an adult bear which suddenly chases him across the woods while three beavers notice that Hiawatha is in danger sounding the alarm to the woodland creatures. As Hiawatha is being chased, the raccoons, beavers, opossums, and the other animals manage to save him from the bear. He then returns to his canoe as the animals bid a farewell to him.
