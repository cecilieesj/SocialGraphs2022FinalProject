The '''Karasu Tengu''' (simply referred to as the '''Tengu''') is a character in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. 

==Background==
The Tengu is shown to be a very dangerous samurai bird yokai that is capable of controlling the weather and (like other yokai) slaying ghosts. He is shown to guard the exit to the Gateway to the Land of the Living attempting to prevent intruders from crossing, much to [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]]'s evil plans in trying to summon him.

Because the Tengu is a powerful fighter, he is capable of using his katana to send in special attacks; for instance, when his katana is struck by lightning, he can use it to send lightning to the ground to create formations of rocks to attack his enemies. Another sword attack the Tengu uses is when he creates a tornado to capture his enemies. Despite him being a powerful fighter, he became sensitive when he noticed [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], [[José Carioca]], and [[Donald Duck]] who are trying to defeat him.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Mt. Fuji Whiz]]" when Panchito, José, and Donald are trying to return to the real world, Sheldgoose summons the Tengu to stop the Caballeros from escaping. As the Tengu arrives, he blocks the path to prevent the Caballeros from escaping, where he prepares to attack the Caballeros. When José is devising a plan to Donald and Panchito in a plan to defeat the Tengu, he noticed that Panchito disappeared due to the fact that he ended up in Clinton Coot's cabana where [[April, May, and June]] are trying to rescue him from the spirit world. Without Panchito assisting them, the Tengu performs a lightning attack to ambush José and Donald as well performing a tornado attack, trapping Donald and José in his special attack.

Later, the Karasu Tengu then corners Donald and José as he threatens to kill them with his katana, but Panchito appears in front of him due to the fact that [[Humphrey the Bear]] in Clinton's cabana helped finish Panchito's unfinished business. Panchito inflates himself as the Tengu becomes confused upon looking at Panchito's size, as well as Donald and José who do the same thing to which the two repel him. José, Panchito, and Donald work together in fighting the Tengu to which José gives him the final blow to send the Tengu flying in midair, causing the Tengu to be struck by lightning, defeating him.

In "[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]", the Tengu is summoned during the final battle in a plan to stop the Caballeros and Xandra from heading to the Summoning Chamber. As the Tengu blocks their path, Xandra manages to summon [[King Arthur (Legend of the Three Caballeros)|King Arthur]] to help the four on their way to which Arthur engages in a swordfight with the Tengu. When Felldrake prepares for a new age of darkness, the Tengu and the rest of the other reinforcements are sent back to their respective homes. Even after the final battle has ended, it is possible that the Tengu was sent back to the Underworld during the final battle.

==Trivia==
*Though [[Clinton Coot]] describes the Karasu Tengu as a samurai falcon, the word "Karasu" means "crow" in Japanese - though the Tengu depicted in the series resembles a crow, despite being described as a falcon by Coot himself.
**His voice does include falcon calls.
*Prior to his proper appearance in "Mt. Fuji Whiz", the Tengu can be briefly seen with King Arthur in the prologue sequence in the first episode, "[[Dope-a Cabana]]".
**Ironicly, they both appear together face to face in "Sheldgoose Square Dance".
