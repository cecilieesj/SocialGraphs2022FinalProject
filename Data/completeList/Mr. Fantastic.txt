==Appearances==

===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===

====''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''====
Reed Richards is a founding member of the Illuminati, a collective of the most powerful and intellectual superheroes alive on Earth-838, a universe outside of the prime MCU reality (Earth-616).

When Doctor Strange of Earth-616 is arrested and brought forth before the Illuminati for risk of incursion, Richards shrugged aside Strange's warnings about the Scarlet Witch. He insisted that the greatest threat to the universe remained to be Doctor Strange of Earth-838, as he had caused an incursion while searching for a quick method to defeat Thanos. But when the Scarlet Witch of Earth-616 invaded the facility, Richards attempted to reason with her, noting of his own children that he loved. He only resorted to combat after witnessing her kill Black Bolt, but Richards was quickly shredded up and disposed of.

*''To be added''

===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
Reed first appears helping [[Hank Pym|Henry Pym]] analyze Princess Ravonna, seeking a way to save her.

When the Avengers [[Iron Man]] and [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] come to visit at the Baxter Building, [[Doctor Doom]] kidnaps Sue and Wasp. The [[Avengers]] and Fantastic Four go to Latveria to rescue them, and after a fight Doom just lets them go. What Reed and the others don't know is that Doom has discovered Sue isn't the real one, but a [[Skrull]] imposter.

Reed and the rest of the Fantastic Four almost fell victims of the Skrull Sue imposter, but [[Invisible Woman|the real Sue]] somehow saves them.

Some time later, he was part of the Avengers' expanded team against [[Galactus]].
