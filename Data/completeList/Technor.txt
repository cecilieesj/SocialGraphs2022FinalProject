'''Technor''' is a recurring villain from ''[[Teamo Supremo]]''. He is a robot in the likeness of a computer monitor, built by [[Mr. Paulson]] to be a computerized therapist for a universal health-care plan. However, when the plan was cancelled, Technor went rogue and turned into a power-hungry tyrant.

Technor controls his large mech, the Magnabody, which he uses to drain power from any source. However, when detached from the Magnabody, his main method of transportation is the flying therapist's couch on which he sits. Technor's weakness is that he can be powered down if he grabs cables for a power source that is then shut off, or if the "off" switch in his Magnabody is pulled.
