'''The Cave Family''' is a family of Neanderthal characters who adopted [[Spot (The Good Dinosaur)|Spot]] in the [[2015]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''. The family consists of a father, mother, sister, and brother.

==Role in the film==
The father was first seen howling at Spot and [[Arlo]] and wanted to get a closer look but Arlo takes Spot away. Later, he appears again towards the end of the film, this time bringing his wife, son, and daughter and embrace Spot and want to adopt him. Spot reluctantly agrees and tries to go with Arlo, but with a heavy heart, Arlo pushes Spot toward the family and draws a circle around Spot and the Cave Family; symbolizing "family". With heavy hearts, Spot and Arlo say goodbye and Spot goes off with his new family walking on two legs for the first time. Spot and Arlo howl at each other one last time and he and his family disappear over a hill.
