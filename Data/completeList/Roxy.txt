==Background==
===Personality===
Despite her large and intimidating appearance, she is actually gentle and friendly. She is clumsy, emotional, caring, and thoughtful. She tucked one of the [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]] into bed in one episode to help Dylan.

Dolly's BFF number one, Roxy may be a super-slobbery Rottweiler on the outside, but she is 100% girly-girl on the inside. Sweet-natured, overly emotional, and loyal, she believes Dolly can do no wrong and willingly follows her into any and all scrapes. With a bad case of "only dog" syndrome, Roxy just adores hanging with Dolly and her furry, fun-loving fame.

===Physical appearance===
Roxy is a gigantic black-and-tan Rottweiler with small ears, a gray nose, and a toothy mouth. She has black eyes and wears a hot pink collar with a peace sign as a tag on it.
