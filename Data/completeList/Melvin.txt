'''Melvin''' is an alien who is [[Kirby (Chicken Little)|Kirby]]'s father and [[Tina]]'s husband, and the secondary antagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2005]] animated feature film, ''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''.

==Background==
At first, Melvin is shown to be loud and bad-tempered using his big voice to yell at anyone who takes away Kirby. He even threatened to kill Chicken Little and his father for child theft to which the two did not intentionally harm him. However, when his wife Tina arrives, she tells him that Chicken Little and his father Buck Cluck are not harming him.

==Role in the film==
When his son goes missing, he and his wife start looking for him, causing a massive invasion on [[Oakey Oaks]] and creating chaos. When Chicken Little and his father Buck are abducted, Melvin prepares to obliterate them in which his wife Tina with her being reunited with Kirby tells her husband to cancel his obliteration plan as well as turning off his big voice. Later when Oakey Oaks is being restored, he apologizes to the inhabitants of Oakey Oaks for the invasion.

==Trivia==
*At one point, Melvin wears a [[Mickey Mouse]] watch; however, Mickey shown on his watch has three eyes.
