|quote = "Mossy loves the wondrous glow of star stones."}}'''Mossy''' is a swamp monster who appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[Buttercup Amber]]", voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. For years, her existence was only known to be a legend until she was discovered by [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and her Buttercup Troop. She ended up scaring the Buttercups into a chase and they got stuck in a bog, with only Sofia and Amber to save them. The two princesses soon found out she was very friendly and with her help, they managed to rescue the rest of the troop. Then afterward, Mossy showed the Buttercups the way to the star stones.

==Trivia==
*Mossy, from the waist up, shares some references to the [[Spring Sprite]] from ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'''s segment, [[The Firebird Suite]].
*Mossy's dialogue is very similar to that of [[Gurgi]]'s from ''[[The Black Cauldron]].''
