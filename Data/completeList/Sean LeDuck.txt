[[File:Sean_LeDuck.jpg|thumb|163px]]'''Sean LeDuck''' is a minor character in [[PKNA]]. He is an actor in the Channel 00 soap opera 'Anxieties', who replaces the disappeared [[Brad Van Beck]] as the main character Perceval.

In [[PKNA 0: Evronians]], [[Donald]] is watching 'Anxieties' and finds Van Beck has been replaced by LeDuck. When LeDuck goes to writer Sam Plot's house, he finds Sam turned into a [[Coolflames|Coolflame]], and [[Evronians]] who explain that they abducted Brad Van Beck as an experiment to see if the actors of 'Anxieties' can work as a catalyzer of the viewers' emotions. Then they turn LeDuck into a Coolflame too. [[The Duck Avenger]], who has been closely following LeDuck, finds that the Evronians will gather the energy of the whole 'Anxieties' cast during Sam's party.

Sean is not seen at the 'Anxieties' party at Ducklair Tower, but a brief flashback in issue 15 shows him there.

Issue 15 is mostly about the 'Anxieties' cast. Sean LeDuck (unexplainably back to normal, though there's a short mention by [[Zoster]] about him being just partly coolflamed) is shown somewhat clueless, never noticing when other cast members enter on scene and frequently arguing with [[Paperilla Starry]] during the filming of the episodes. After the cast is abducted by the Evronians to discover the soap opera's mechanism to generate emotions in the audience, LeDuck acts as unfazed as the others until the cast is reunited with Brad Van Beck, at which point they get into an unending argument about who deserves to be Perceval. After the Evronians are defeated by The Duck Avenger, filming of 'Anxieties' resumes with both actors playing long-lost twins, both named Perceval.

Sean LeDuck makes a brief appearance in the backup story of issue #39 when he and the cast of 'Anxieties' compete with Channel 00's news department in a basketball game for charity. He is the only 'Anxieties' cast member who actually appears in the story.
