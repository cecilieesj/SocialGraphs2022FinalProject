'''Matteo Silva''' is a main character in the [[Disney Channel]] television series ''[[Bunk'd]]'' portrayed by [[Raphael Alejandro]].

==Personality==
Matteo is a cautious kid who would rather not be at [[Camp Kikiwaka]] and finds danger in any situation. As an extreme germaphobe and hypochondriac, he is always worried about getting infected or sick. Despite being shown as very intelligent, Matteo has a fairly low self-esteem but tries to convince himself that he is indeed cool.

==Physical Appearance==
Matteo is skinny and very short, which sometimes embarrasses him. Despite his Hispanic origin, he appears Caucasian with long black hair and fair skin. He wears large glasses and usually dresses in a collared, tucked-in shirt with a belt.

==Trivia==
* His character was originally named Kyle Frame but changed for unknown reasons to Matteo Silva.
* He can be seen as a super smart person like [[Ravi Ross]] after taking precautions and coming out of his comfort zone thanks to his campers.
* Matteo is originally from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] with a strong fascination for dinosaurs, science, and math.
* He is one of only five characters who know that the Kikiwaka exists along with Ravi, Tiffany, Destiny and Finn.
* Matteo's fascination for dinosaurs is inspired by the actor who portrays him, [[Raphael Alejandro]], and his dreams of becoming an paleontologist.
