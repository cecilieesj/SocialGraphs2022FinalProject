'''Frida Kahlo''' is a character in the [[2017]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]'' and the [[2002]] [[Miramax Films|Miramax]] live action feature film ''Frida''. She is based on the renowned [[Wikipedia:Frida Kahlo|Mexican artist of the same name]] and is depicted much as she was in life, particularly in her artwork.

==Role in the film==
While visiting the arts district of the [[Land of the Dead]], [[Miguel Rivera]] runs into Frida after [[Dante]] chases after her monkey alebrije. She takes an interest in Dante, believing the dog to be a spirit guide as the Xoloitzcuintle is considered a special being, though decides that he might just be an ordinary dog after seeing him choke on his own foot. Frida shows Miguel that she is busy working on a performance that is scheduled for [[Ernesto de la Cruz]]'s concert, but is having a hard time trying to find the right tone of the act. Miguel suggests some elements she can add in, to which Frida finds insightful, and compliments the boy's talents as Miguel explains he hopes to become a musician; sympathizing with his dream, Frida encourages Miguel to follow this. She also expresses annoyance at de la Cruz since he never comes to rehearsals, instead hosting a lavish party.

Later on, Miguel and his family enlist Frida to help them sneak into Ernesto's concert so they can recover [[Héctor]]'s photo that Ernesto had taken. During her opening act, Frida helps the family by hiding them among her dancers, thus giving them access to backstage. She wishes Miguel luck as he goes, receiving a heartfelt thanks in return.

==Trivia==
*A running gag throughout the film involves [[Héctor]] disguising himself as Frida in order to get past security, including crossing the marigold bridge, getting into Ernesto's party, and (shared with Miguel and the rest of the deceased Rivera family members) making it backstage of Ernesto's concert. Apparently, according to a security officer whom Hector offs with a warning, it is illegal in the Land of the Dead to falsify Frida's famous unibrow.
*While Frida Kahlo is usually remembered for her distinctive unibrow, in real life, she would indeed pluck her hairs in her youth. She soon adopted her unibrow stating, "I will not restrict my self-expression in order to fit your idea of what a woman should look like."
