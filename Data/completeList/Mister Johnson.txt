'''Mister Johnson''' is a character from the defunct attraction ''[[Mission to Mars]]''.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Mr. Johnson was a scientist who lived in the futuristic society of [[Tomorrowland (location)|Tomorrowland]].  Johnson worked as ground-control director for the ''[[Moonliner]]'' rocket of ''Moonliner Flight Systems'' which was used for transport to the planet [[Mars]] via, "Hyperspace penetration".  At-least one of these flights nearly turned to disaster when the rocket nearly crashed into ''Olympus Mons''.  Johnson was likely affiliated with [[Tom Morrow|Professor Tom Morrow]], a prominent Tomorrowland figure who had previously worked in Johnson's position during the Moonliner's flights to the moon.

By around the 2000s, the Moonliner was considered to be an antique and the events of the missions to Mars were questioned as potential hoaxes.  Around this time, Mister Johnson was employed by the [[Tomorrowland Transit Authority]] to observe Tomorrowland's weather and traffic in the ''Sky View Hovercraft-1''.  Johnson might have also worked for Tomorrowland's space-station ''[[Starport Seven-Five]]'' as he was posted in a control tower there with some authority.

=== Development history ===
Mister Johnson was created from the audio-animatronic of the ''[[Rocket to the Moon]]'' character Tom Morrow and served the same role as Morrow.  Johnson's audio-animatronic was later used for the robot character [[S.I.R.]] in ''[[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]''.

== Appearances ==

=== Mission to Mars ===
Mister Johnson was the missions flight director for this attraction.  He appeared as an audio-animatronic character within the attraction's pre-show.  Throughout the flight to the moon, he could be heard relaying messages to guests for their missions.

=== [[Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover]] ===
While passing through [[Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom)|Space Mountain]], an announcer can be heard saying, "Paging Mr. Morrowâ€”Mr. Tom Morrow. Please contact Mr. Johnson in the control tower to confirm your flight to the moon".  This seemingly references Johnson working for  ''Starport Seven-Five''.  Removed audio had Johnson as an agent of the Tomorrowland Transit Authority with the dialogue, "Hi there Tomorrowland travelers, this is Mr. Johnson in Sky View Hovercraft-1 bringing you the latest Tomorrowland Transit report. As usual, everything is perfect on [[Autopia|Tomorrowland's super highways]]. Back to you at TTA Central".

== Trivia ==

* Sometimes, Mission to Mars has been referenced with Tom Morrow in the place of Johnson.
**A book by Tom Morrow in the [[Skipper Canteen]] is titled, ''Mission to the Red Planet'', referencing Mission to Mars where Morrow was replaced by Johnson.
**In the queue for [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]] was a posting from the Tomorrowland Interplanetary Convention Centre advertising, "Mission to Mars: History or Hoax", a lecture by Professor Tom Morrow through the [[The League of Planets|League of Planets]].
* The Tomorrowland super highway which Johnson used to reference is another name for the Tomorrowland Speedway.
