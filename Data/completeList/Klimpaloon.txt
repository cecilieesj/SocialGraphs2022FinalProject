|quote = "NANG!"}}The '''Klimpaloon''' is a magical, old-timey bathing suit that lives in the [[Himalayas]]. To be more specific, a mountain range on the Tibet/[[Nepal]] border and makes a distinct call of "nang-nang-nang-nang." Klimpaloon appears twice. The first time is when [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]], [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] and the gang crash into the Himalayas right after Phineas told [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] about him (stating Klimpaloon as being a "magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas"). Klimpaloon then walks by, saying, "nang-nang-nang-nang." Phineas comments that Candace thought he made it up. His second appearance is when Candace is grieving, thinking she lost her brothers and their friends. Klimpaloon, making his distinctive call, walks up behind her. She snaps that he's not helping, and he backs away, sadly "nang"-ing.
