==Background==
Cloak and Camo are described as top secret camouflaging chameleons. Due to their ability to camouflage, they can turn invisible to avoid getting spotted or seen by predators. For instance, to avoid getting caught by the wildebeests for escaping, Cloak, Camo, and the other chameleons make [[Nigel (The Wild)|Nigel]] "levitate" without walking. Despite this, they and the other chameleons are shown to be sensitive to intense volcanic gas.

==Role in the film==
Cloak and Camo serve as [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]]'s "instincts" and use their chameleon camouflage to guide Samson and [[Benny (The Wild)|Benny]] to the wildebeests' lair where they hold [[Ryan]], [[Bridget]], and [[Larry (The Wild)|Larry]] prisoner with Nigel, whom they believe to be a god. They form an arrow camouflaging themselves on a branch and whisper softly, "Follow your instincts." Samson actually believes it's his "instincts" and follows the colors and voices, though Benny is doubtful. He then admits that his mother drank pool water when she was pregnant with him as they continue to follow the colors and voices of the chameleons.

Arriving at the wildebeests' hideout, Samson chooses to go in there immediately to save his son and friends, but Benny prefers that they come up with a plan first. The two then hear someone say, "Don't listen to the rat." Furious, Benny continues to overhear the bickering voices and discovers the camouflaged chameleons who were quarreling about their mission and then let themselves be discovered, scaring off the other chameleons who helped them in the mission.

Benny grabs the two chameleons and Samson asks them why they brought him there, to which Cloak unwittingly starts blurting everything out to Samson and Benny, with Camo sticking his tongue in Cloak's face to slap him every time he does so. Cloak then orders the other chameleons to hang on to Benny and shows his secret camouflage while continuing to argue with Camo, which gives Samson an idea to enter the wildebeests' territory.

While Nigel talks to the wildebeests, Samson becomes camouflaged with Cloak, Camo, and all the other chameleons on him, and they lift Nigel high in the air, causing [[Kazar]] and all the other wildebeests to believe that it's magic, allowing the heroes to escape. However, when they come in contact with the erupting volcanic gas, the camouflage is removed and the chameleons are forced to flee.

At the end of the film, when all the animals have escaped the cave with the erupting volcano (except Kazar who was crushed to death), Cloak and Camo are last seen on the boat arguing again while they steer the helm as they return to the [[New York City|New York]] [[Central Park Zoo]], with Larry dancing with the chameleons in his "camouflage" suit with the other animals.

They are also seen in the credits dancing alongside the other characters.

==Trivia==
*Their names are a reference to camouflage, an ability that chameleons use to confuse their predators.
