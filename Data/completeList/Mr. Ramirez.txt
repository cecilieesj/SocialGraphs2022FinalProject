'''Mr. Ramirez''' is the estranged father of [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]] and and a unseen minor character in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

== History ==
He doesn't appear but is mentioned in "[[Blendin's Game]]", Soos hasn't seen him since he was four-years old and never comes to any of his son's birthdays and instead sends him a postcard every year saying he'll be there next year. Soos didn't feel like being at a surprise party for him. Due to the years of estrangement and empty promises from his father, Soos came to hate his celebrating his birthday. 

When [[Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines]] travel back in time and learn the reasoning for Soos hating his birthday, they decide to agree to [[Blendin Blandin|Blendin's]] challenge in "Globnar" (gladiatorial time combat), in order to win and give Soos the Time Wish rewarded to Globnar victors. The Pines twins had believed that Soos would use the Time Wish to see his father again (or have him involved in his life). However, after learning the risks Dipper and Mabel took to make him happy, Soos uses the Time Wish to have the twins cleaned up from the dirt they picked up from Globnar, and a slice of "infinite pizza," acknowledging the twins as family and presumably disowning his father.

In "[[Weirdmageddon|Weirdmageddon Part 2: Escape from Reality]]", while in [[Mabelland|Mabeland]], Soos meets an imaginary figure named Ernesto who he idealized to be his dad, however the only reason why was since Soos has seen has his father in so long and doesn't know what he really looks like.
