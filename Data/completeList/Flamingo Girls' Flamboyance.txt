==Background==
They are a flock of greater flamingos as their name suggests. They like spending time at the sea they call "Flamingo Beach". However, much to their chagrin towards [[Kion]], they dislike it when their moments at sea are interrupted with the Lion Guard trying to keep Kion away from the flamingos. After Kion apologizes to the flamingos for his temper, all the flamingos accept Kion's apology when Fuli and Azaad help Kion control his temper by giving him Tuliza.

==Role in the series==
==="[[The Race to Tuliza]]"===
When the Lion Guard decides to relax at the sea while [[Fuli]] goes to get some Tuliza for [[Kion]], a flock of flamingos arrive and start to party. When [[Ono]] tries talk to them telling the to keep the noise down, two of the [[Flamingo Girls]] arrive and tell Ono that they're on migration. They explain that every year, they stop to migrate at the beach they call "Flamingo Beach". As the flamingos dance at sea, [[Makini]] takes Kion away to a safe place from the flamingos as they dance the musical number "[[Flamingo Dance Party]]", much to their disturbance towards Kion.

When Kion's friends plan to keep the noise level down, [[Anga]] tells the flamingos to stop, but they refuse to listen, just as the flamingo girls try to copy Anga's movements much to her feeling serious and worried about Kion being disturbed as the flamingos continue to dance at the sea. The plan to stop the flamingos from waking up Kion was unsuccessful; the flamingo girls notice Kion in front of them as the flamingos attempt to touch him. Kion, however, wakes up in rage and prepares to use the Roar of the Elders to blast away the flamingos disturbing his nap; this, however, is prevented when Anga sees Fuli and [[Azaad]] with Tuliza for Kion.

When Fuli and Azaad arrive at Flamingo Beach to give Tuliza to Kion, the Tuliza the cheetahs gave to Kion helped calm his temper. Kion then apologizes to the flamingos for his rudeness to which the flamingo girls accept his apology as a misunderstanding. As Kion's team plans to head for the Tree of Life, he tells the Guard to leave the flamingos alone so they can spend more time at sea.

==Trivia==
*It is not known if any of the flamingos migrating to Flamingo Beach came from the [[Pride Lands]], as their actual home is never mentioned.
