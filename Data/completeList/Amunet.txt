'''Amunet''' is a minor character from the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' reboot who first appears in the episode "[[The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!]]".

==Role in the series==
In "[[The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!]]", Amunet is a "living mummy", or at least dresses herself as one, as the de facto leader of an Egyptian civilization living in an underground city beneath the pyramids of the pharaoh [[Toth-Ra]]. Like the rest of the living mummies, Amunet is the latest in the line of Toth-Ra's followers who dress as mummies in honor of Toth-Ra and their ancestors. She initially followed the perceived orders of their pharaoh without question to the point she rebuked the idea of uprising and ignoring the drawbacks of living underground in favor of Toth-Ra's benefits to a mortified [[Scrooge McDuck]]. But upon being introduced to a burrito by [[Launchpad McQuack]], Amunet is enthralled and agrees to help rise against Toth-Ra.

However, Amunet is reluctant towards fighting Toth-Ra directly and admits that she and her people would likely surrender, believing the pharaoh to possesses supernatural powers, which [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey]] finds to be preposterous. Fortunately, Launchpad provides the motivation for the mummies to enter the pyramid and confront Toth-Ra, whom they discover is nothing more than a puppet operated by his guard [[Sabaf]]. However, a curse revives Toth-Ra into an undead monster and he overwhelms his former followers with supernatural magic. When Launchpad is injured in the fight, Amunet finds the courage to rally her people against their subjugation. Together with the McDucks, the mummies incapacitate Toth-Ra and return him to rest. Amunet and the mummies subsequently leave the pyramid; Amunet briefly has difficulty adjusting to sunlight so she is given a pair of sunglasses. Following their adventure, the mummies celebrate with burritos, during which Amunet gifts Launchpad Toth-Ra's khopesh and Scrooge a burrito that he enjoys, much to his surprise.

She reappears briefly in the season two finale "[[Moonvasion!]]", with [[Dijon|D'jinn]] to fight the Moonlanders in an attempt to find recruits to join the battle and stop Lunaris from destroying Earth.

==Trivia==
*The name Amunet is Egyptian for "hidden one". It is a feminine version of Amun, a sun god of Egypt often associated with Ra as Amun Ra.
