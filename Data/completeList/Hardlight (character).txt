'''Hardlight''' is a villain in ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''. His real name is '''Ian''', who works as a scientist at [[Krei Tech Industries]]. His specialty is force field engineering.

==Background==
[[File:Ian_bh6.png|thumb|left|150px|Ian.]]
Like most of [[Alistair Krei|Krei]]'s workers and employees, Ian is mistreated and neglected by Krei, the latter pressuring him to keep up with the work for his company and causing Ian to feel undervalued. Ian is an experienced player of the online fighting game, ''Mind Smith II Turbo'' under the username "Hardlight". Eventually, Ian figured out how to combine his force field research with the mechanics of the game to creating solid light-constructs he could manipulate, which contributed to the creation of his supervillain alter-ego.

==Role in the series==
Ian first appears the episode, "[[Hardlight]]". Ian was first seen at [[Krei Tech Industries]] working on the Buddy Guards for the SFPD to hunt down the branded fugitive Big Hero 6. Ian interjects trying to inform Krei of the Buddy Guard project, but he is cut off when Krei shoves him back in the elevator.

In the evening, Ian now dressed in his suit, emerges from the crowd in plain sight right as Honey Lemon, Wasabi, Go Go and Fred were driving home from [[Frederickson Candy Co.]] and begins unleashing his constructs to menace the innocent bystanders. [[Chief Cruz]] shows up with the SFPD, releasing Buddy Guards to dispatch his constructs before demanding his surrender. Introducing himself as Hardlight, he states that he was looking to challenge Big Hero 6, dismissing the police as NPCs (non-player characters). He then announced his intent to steal the biggest diamond at San Fransokyo Museum as a means of conveying his challenge to Big Hero 6 through Cruz.

Hardlight returns with chibi versions of Big Hero 6 made from his forcefield tech. The designs are inspired by [[Karmi]]'s webtoon of Big Hero 6 fan-fiction.
