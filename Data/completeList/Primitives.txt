'''Primitives''', officially known as '''Primitive Inhumans''', are supporting antagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.

They are an artificial offspring of [[Inhumans]] created by the kidnapped Dr. [[Holden Radcliffe]] under [[Hive]]'s coercion. Hive forced Doctor Radcliffe to create the Absolution Virus containing: Hive's Parasites (to sway the primitives under his mind control), Terrigen Mist from the Afterlife Terrigen Crystals, and Kree Blood from the Kree Reapers and Daisy "Skye" Johnson. The virus' sole purpose was to trigger Terrigenesis in regular humans and convert them into Hive-infected Inhumans, however the chemical mixture of gaseous virus converted them into artifical Hive-infected Inhumans called Primitives.
