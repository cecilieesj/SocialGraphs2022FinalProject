'''Bobby Ray Stewart''' (played by Billy Ray Cyrus) is the identical brother of [[Robby Ray Stewart]], the younger brother of [[Uncle Earl]], and uncle of [[Miley Stewart|Miley]] and [[Jackson Stewart|Jackson]] whose cousin [[Luann Stewart]] is also identical to her and is Bobby Ray's daughter. He is only seen at the end of "[[Torn Between Two Hannahs]]" when Robby finds out about Luann locking Miley up in her (Hannah's) closet. He is seen to wear stereotypical cowboy clothes and hat and he has a strong Tennessee accent. At the end of Torn Between Two Hannahs, [[Albert Dontzig|Mr. Dontzig]] comes in when Bobby Ray and Robby Ray are talking and gets freaked out about it as he hates the Stewarts.
