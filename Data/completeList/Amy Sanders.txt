'''Amy Sanders''' is [[Kate Sanders|Kate]]'s eighteen-year-old cousin. She is in a band, and is very irresponsible. She is practically an older version of Kate, but only far more self-centered and immature.

==History==
Kate and Amy seem to have a rocky relationship, as shown in the episode "Party Over Here". 

She invited only her own friends to her cousin's birthday party who then proceeded to deliberately break stuff in a Kate's house. She also ignored Kate's request for a chocolate birthday cake because she herself liked strawberry, and she didn't even know that it was Kate's birthday. When she ''does'' find out, she only briefly wishes Kate a happy birthday before returning to the party. 

Kate is also shown to be a lot nicer and mature than Amy, despite Amy being older than Kate.

Amy also appeared in "Clue-Less" and "Xtreme Xmas".

==Appearances==
===Season 2===
*Party Over Here

==Trivia==
