'''Donnie Dion''' is one of the new characters in ''[[High School Musical 3]]''. He is [[Jimmy Zara]]'s best friend, as they are seen jumping through the halls of East High together. He is the the ball boy for the Wildcats. It is implied that he is a freshman. His free-spirited and happy go-lucky attitude are sometimes annoying to other people. Most would say he will be the new 'Chad' for the Wildcats as his friend Jimmie will be the new 'Troy'. Both had showed that they respected the older players and in turn they were given their lockers.
