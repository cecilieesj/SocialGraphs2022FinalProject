==Appearances==

===''[[Fantasia]]''===
Elephanchine first appears along with her elephant troupe, while [[Hyacinth Hippo]] is sleeping. She and the other elephants dance and blow some bubbles along with her who notices a fish in one of them; after a while, a huge wind blows them away. Elephanchine and the other elephants appear in the finale when the [[Alligators]] chase the [[Hippos]], [[Ostriches]], and the Elephants themselves around and fall in love with each other.

==Trivia==
*Elephanchine's nameÂ was never revealed in the movie.
*Her name is most likely a parody of ballet choreographer George Balanchine.
