'''Convor''' (plural: '''Convorees''') is a small species of owl-like bird native to several planets throughout the galaxy. It seemed to have an unknown strong connection with [[the Force]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===
A convor appeared in the conclusion of the episode "[[The Mystery of Chopper Base]]", when [[Ahsoka Tano]] says to [[Ezra Bridger]] that the Force becomes more mysterious as one learns more about it.

Another convor appears in "[[Twilight of the Apprentice]]" at the conclusion of [[Darth Vader]] and Ahsoka Tano, watching Darth Vader limp away from the destroyed Sith Temple on [[Malachor]] before flying away, which pans to the image of Ahsoka entering the ruined temple.

A third convor appears when [[Kanan Jarrus]] meets with the [[The Bendu|Bendu]]. As it perched happily atop the Bendu's spiky armor, it is likely that the bird is affiliated with this physical embodiment of the Force.

==Trivia==
*The convor was named after Dave Filoni's wife, Anne Convery.
*When questioned during an interview about its appearances in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', Dave Filoni indicated that the creature's appearance had a deeper meaning, stating: "In some ways, I could say that it's a messenger, it's an observer. It is definitely something. And I would suggest – I would rather have fans debate – but I would suggest to say that whatever that thing is an avatar of has actually appeared in the animated ''Star Wars'' universe before. So decrypt from there. Have a fun summer!".
