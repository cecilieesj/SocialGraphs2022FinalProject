'''Violet Sabrewing''' is a supporting character in the  ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' reboot. She is a hummingbird named after her species - Violet Sabrewing.

==Background==
===Origin===
She used to believe that magic was not a thing and only believed in books and logic. When the Shadow War occurred, she later became very interested in learning about magic and the Shadow Realm.

===Personality===
Violet is a smart and fun girl. She likes to review books at the library. She is not the most emotive, IE her monotone voice due to her stoic nature.
