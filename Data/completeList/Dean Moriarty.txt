'''Peter "Dean" Moriarty''' is [[Alex Russo|Alex]]'s main love interest in Season 2. At first, [[Harper Finkle|Harper]] didn't seem to like him because he had no set bedtime, was a bad boy, roams the halls of the school without a pass, and sells fake tattoos in the boy's bathroom (one of which Harper later purchased).

Dean discovered Alex's crush on him when Alex announced it to the school in "[[Graphic Novel]]". They later went on their second date and skipped their first because Alex believed first dates are 'sappy'. In "[[Saving WizTech|Saving WizTech: Part 1]]", Dean kept giving Alex the projects he'd made in wood shop but didn't realize she didn't like them. So, he later made her a card out of wood that wasn't a project. He referred to her as 'Russo' and himself as 'Moriarty' until this episode. Before he had a chance to give Alex the card, [[Ronald Longcape Jr.]] used ''Piggly, Wiggly, get in the Jiggly'' to lock him up in a block of gelatin and stole his card, which was later discovered by the [[Professor Crumbs|headmaster of WizTech]] and therefore, returning it to Alex.

It also shows Alex admitting she is in love with Dean at the end of "[[Saving WizTech|Saving WizTech: Part 2]]". Dean appears to be raised by his uncle, as he says in "[[Racing]]", "my uncle raised me with manners". He seems to really like Alex, wanting to make a good first impression with her parents, and showering her with gifts. In "[[Alex's Brother, Maximan]]", Dean mentions about his 'mama' making salad and nachos like Alex did. Dean moved away prior to the events of "[[Wizards vs. Vampires: Dream Date|Dream Date]]". In "Dream Date", Alex appeared in Dean's dreams and is controlling him, Dean comes and does not act the way he did in Alex's dreams and they broke up. Alex went in Dean's dream and Dean revealed he took it so easily so he could not have his heart broken. Alex also lets Dean do whatever he wanted to in his dreams. He seems to think Abe Lincoln is a decent wingman.

He can often be seen hanging around the school with his posse, Joey, and several others, who seem to like talking about how 'ripped' he is.

Dean is often found on the road going by his alter ego, Neal Cassady. He later returns in the Season 4 episode, "[[Journey to the Center of Mason]]".
