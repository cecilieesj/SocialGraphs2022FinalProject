'''Thalia Flint''' is a supporting character in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated series, ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.

==Background==

===Personality===
From her first appearance, Thalia appeared to be very indifferent to many of the happenings at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]] She outright disliked being anywhere near her mother's place of work, but would put up with it to please her. She is a very good judge of character, however, and tells it like it is. While she is not completely devoid of humor, it does take some effort to get her to crack a smile. Later, she does open up and admires people who are honest with her and develops an appreciation for the company and the people in it.

===Physical appearance===
Thalia, in some ways, resembles a tiny version of her mother. She is purple in color, with lighter purple lines going across her body and has the same unusual eyestalks with the small green bat-like flaps behind them. She lacks her mother's overbite and nostrils, instead bearing a flat face, though she still has tiny sharp teeth. She has arms with four fingered hands, but instead of having a snake body, she has a small planted bottom with four toe like appendages. Just like Ms. Flint, however, she apparently slides around.

==Trivia==
*Thalia is voiced by [[Hadley Gannaway]], the daughter of series developer [[Bobs Gannaway]].
*After Hadley played young Anna in [[Frozen II|''Frozen II'']], she's also played Thalia in this show.
**The only monster that Thalia seems friendly with is Otis. This is most likely because Otis is voiced by Bobs.
