'''Bobbi Baba''' was a female Muppet sheep. She was originally going to be part of the main cast in the [[2018]] version of ''[[Muppet Babies (2018 series)|Muppet Babies]]''. However, her character was replaced by a penguin named [[Summer Penguin|Summer]].

According to her character description:
"The new Muppet on the block. Bobbi is feminine, exceptionally artistic (she can draw, paint, draw a painting, paint a drawing, sing, dance - she does it all). She's intelligent, well-spoken and well-read for a 6-year-old. She's a sheep-out-of-water in our dysfunctional family. And is leery of [[Miss Piggy]]'s leery eyes (Piggy might be a TAAAAAD threatened by Bobbi). One of the good ones. Bobbi talks in sheep-ease, 'I'm baaaaahbi, I hope I'm not baaaathering you...' Especially when she's nervous."
