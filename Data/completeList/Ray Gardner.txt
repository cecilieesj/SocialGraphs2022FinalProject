'''Ray Gardner''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2020]] animated feature film, ''[[Soul]]''. He is the father of [[Joe Gardner]].

==Trivia==
*In the movie it’s hinted that he is dead, since he’s only seen in flashbacks, however in ''[[Pixar Popcorn]]'' it’s revealed that he is alive. It would be possible that this takes place before the film or just non-canon.
*It’s possible he has some sort of disease that leaves Libba to take care of him.
