Cindy Moon is a student at Midtown School of Science and Technology who is in [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s class and is a member of the school's decathlon team. She showed concern when her teammate Peter Parker said that he wouldn't be participating in the academic decathlon in [[Washington, D.C.]], but he ended up going with them anyway. However, he ultimately didn't participate for he disappeared before the decathlon started. Their team still won, so Cindy went to celebrate with her team by going to the Washington Monument. A shocking explosion trapped them inside the monument's elevator, but luckily, [[New York]] hero Spider-Man was there to save them.
===''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''===
The following year, Cindy was on a school bus for a field trip when an alien spaceship appeared over the city. After half of all life got disintegrated by [[Thanos]], she graduated Midtown School of Science and Technologyby in 2024.
