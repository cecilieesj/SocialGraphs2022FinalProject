==Trivia==
*Maya currently lives in [[Sticky Webb]]’s old house before he moved to Japan with his father.
*Maya, along with KG, are the third and fourth characters in Disney animation to have two fathers, after [[Violet Sabrewing]] in ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' and [[Willow Park]] in ''[[The Owl House]]'', and the first African-Americans to do so. They are also the first human characters to have homosexual parents, due to Violet being a bird and Willow being a witch.
*The majority of the books Maya reads in the series are real-life books themed around anti-racism.
*It is implied the reason she acts distantly and is mistrustful of other humans is because she and her brother were bullied at a young age for having gay dads, as well as for being adopted.
*In "[[Get In]]", Maya reveals that she is a Virgo and she just turned 14.
