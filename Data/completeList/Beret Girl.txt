|partner=[[P.J.]] (boyfriend)}}The '''Beret Girl''' is a supporting character and the love interest of [[P.J.]] from the film ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Little is really learned about the Beret Girl. SheÂ is a very beautiful and mysterious young woman. She is very poetic, regularly performing at the Bean Scene (a coffee shop on the campus where [[Max Goof|Max]], [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]] and [[P.J.]] go to college). She is also, however, a kind individual, who is not afraid to stand up for herself or her friends (for example when she retorted angrily to [[Bradley Uppercrust III|Bradley]] after he insulted her). She also shows strong feelings for P.J., and becomes his love interest in the film.

===Physical appearance===
The Beret Girl is tall and thin, very beautiful, sporting an hourglass figure. She appears to be an anthropomorphized cat or dog, similar to Max, PJ and the gang. She has long maroon hair, green eyes with light purple eyeshadow, a small black nose, and big lips with dark red lipstick. Clothing wise, she dresses like a beatnik; Sporting a black beret (hence her moniker), turtleneck, pants and shoes, all colored black. Her makeup and her hair covering her left eye are similar to [[Jessica Rabbit]]'s face from [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]].

==Role in the film==
She is first seen when she performed at the Bean Scene, a coffee shop where Max, P.J., and Bobby hang out. She performed poetically to the crowd of customers, who are all fans of her. After her performance, both Bobby and P.J. begin to harbor a secret crush on her.

She is later seen again in the coffee shop when Max and Bradley start to get into an altercation. The latter insults her in front of everyone, which she retorts angrily to by poetically insulting him back, referring to him as "the eyelash in her eye" and snapping rhythmically (with the other customers who join in) to make him irritated. This gets to him, and he yells at them to knock it off. He makes a deal with Max before leaving, and she praises Max for standing up for himself and her.

She appears again at the nightclub, where she is amazed by P.J., who speaks poetically about how fat people are looked down upon in society. This impresses her, and she and P.J. dance together (this marks the start of their relationship and P.J's newfound confidence).

She is last seen with P.J. at the end of the film when Goofy graduates and heads home with Sylvia. She also appears in the end credits, dancing along with the rest of the main cast.
