'''Mzingo''' is a male white-backed vulture and the tertiary antagonist of the [[2015]] TV film, ''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]'' and a recurring antagonist its [[2016]] follow-up series ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is one of [[Janja]]'s affiliates and the leader of a [[Mzingo's Parliament|flock of vultures]] that resides in the [[Outlands]].
==Background==
===Personality===
Mzingo is opportunistic and sneaky, as seen when he eavesdrops on Kion as he speaks about the Lion Guard. He shares a desire with the hyenas to eat at his leisure, no matter the effect on the Circle of Life, and cares nothing for the other animals of the Pride Lands. He has a dry and sarcastic demeanor, and he speaks with a sense of eloquence. Mzingo is also shown to be a pyromaniac who resorts to lighting fires. Despite how devious Mzingo is, he is quite dignified. He is more sophisticated than his hyena allies since his vultures work under the rules of a typical parliament, with almost every decision being presented as a motion to be voted on. However, he is also willing to dismiss parliamentary procedure if there is a good opportunity.

After Scar's defeat, Mzingo and his parliament are shown to be very respectful toward Jasiri's leadership and appear much happier living in the Outlands under her rule. He also shows no ill will toward the Lion Guard despite their previous amnesty toward each other. He also worked well with Ono when fighting Vitani and her Lion Guard, and found his keen insight admirable

===Physical appearance===
Mzingo is rather large for a vulture, nearly reaching Janja's shoulder in height. His feathers are colored a very dark blue, though his underside and wings are tipped with lighter blue, and he has a white ring of feathers around his neck. His head and neck are pink, and a blue crest rises from the back of his head in a swept-back spike. His eyes are black, and his beak is tipped with red.

==Role in the series==
===''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]''===
Mzingo overhears that [[Kion]] is assembling a [[Lion Guard]], and returns to the Outlands and reports this news to Janja, who declares that he and his clan will strike the [[Pride Lands]] that night, and sings "[[Tonight We Strike]]", which Mzingo joins in with.

Mzingo accompanies Janja and his clan when they attack the Pride Lands and cause a gazelle stampede which Kion's older sister [[Kiara]] gets caught in. However, Kion and his Lion Guard come to Kiara's rescue by getting the gazelles away from her and chase the hyenas away (with Kion using the [[Roar of the Elders]] against Janja), whilst Mzingo is defeated by The Lion Guard's keenest of sight member [[Ono]], who knocks him into a bush.

They almost succeed until they Makini hangs onto the gourd and Ono removes it from her staff.
