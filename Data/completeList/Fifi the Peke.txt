'''Flapper "Fifi"''' is a character who appeared in some shorts. She is the love interest of [[Pluto]], and [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]]'s pet along with [[Figaro]]. 

==Background==
===Personality===

In [[Mickey Mouse (TV series)]] and [[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]], Fifi is more aggressive and mischievous but is still friendly and playful towards those who gain her affection.

==History==
===1933-1950===
[[File:19210.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fifi in her first appearance, ''[[Puppy Love]].'']]Fifi first appeared, in the [[1933]] Mickey Mouse cartoon ''[[Puppy Love]]'' as [[Minnie Mouse]]'s pet dog and [[Pluto]]'s love interest. A year later, Fifi would return in ''[[The Dognapper]]'' ([[1934]]), where she is taken by dognapper [[Pete|Pegleg Pete]], being the first time Fifi had appeared without Pluto. Two years later, Fifi would appear for time in color, in cameo appearance in ''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]'' ([[1936]]), being the first time she had appeared without Minnie.

[[File:Tumblr nokrg0mwUd1r3jmn6o1 1280.png|thumb|right|250px|Fifi in ''[[Pluto's Quin-puplets]].'']]In [[1937]], Pluto was given his own series of solo-starring cartoons, starting with ''[[Pluto's Quin-puplets]]'', where Fifi and Pluto have [[Pluto's Quin-puplets (characters)|quin-puplets]]. Two years later, she would return, in ''[[Society Dog Show]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Surprise Party]]'' ([[1939]]), as Minnie's pet dog again. Eight years later, she would return in ''[[Pluto's Blue Note]]'' ([[1947]]), being the only time Fifi was alongside [[Dinah the Dachshund]], Pluto's other love interest.

===1950-present===
Fifi disappeared from animation, after being replaced with [[Figaro]]
as Minnie's pet and [[Dinah the Dachshund]] as Pluto's love interest, but appeared in the line of merchandise called ''[[Minnie 'n Me]]'' as Minnie's dog. Later, she would be redesigned, now with an orange coat with cream muzzle, belly and paws. She has brown ears and tail, a black nose, white eyes and a green lace around her neck. The design was continued to be used in video games such, as [[Disney Crossy Road]], story books and more.

She made her triumphant return in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short ''[[You, Me and Fifi]]'' in her classic design. In ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]'', she would reappear in the  design she had used in merchandise.

They both see the pillow, and they both begin fighting over the pillow. The pillow then gets ripped in half, and Fifi falls out of the window, and is now hanging on a flagpole. Mickey panics and jumps over the window to save her. Fifi can't hold on any longer, as her teeth lose their grip and Fifi starts to fall. But Mickey grabs Fifi's left front paw, telling her he will never let her go.
