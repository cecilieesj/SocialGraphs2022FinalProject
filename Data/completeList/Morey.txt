'''Morey''' is a minor character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series. He serves as one of the elite members of Davy Jones' crew and as with other crew members, he is shown with the characteristics of sea creatures - specifically a moray eel.

==Background==

===Personality===
Morey serves as Davy Jones' elite crewman of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''. He is shown to be one of the deadliest and most ruthless crewmen leaving no survivors. What makes him unique is his ability to stretch his head, just like moray eels in real life that are able to lunge out of their holes. In spite of this, he can also use his head to hide in his hole to avoid getting hit during battle due to his characteristics of a moray eel.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Morey has characteristics of sea creatures - his head taking in the form of a moray eel (as his name implies).

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
By order of the EITC, Morey and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''.

Later during battle at the maelstrom, Morey and the other crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men while [[Jack Sparrow]] fights against [[Davy Jones]]. While fighting, Morey prepares to eat [[Hector Barbossa]] during battle as he threatens to eat him, but he dodges his attacks and strikes him using his sword by severing his head and impaling him, defeating him while Jack Sparrow continues fighting against Davy Jones. It is unknown if Morey survived the battle or not.

==Video game appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|At World's End]]''===
Morey serves as the third boss in the video game adaptation of the film, under the name "Electric Arm", appearing in the "Pearl vs. Dutchman" level. Here, he serves as one of the three elite crew members of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', along with Cannon Arm and the Quartermaster of the ''Dutchman''. [[Will Turner]] manages to defeat him, though during the events of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''.

==Trivia==
*Early concept showed Morey as a dangerous, female crew member.
**If this concept was used in the final version of the film, Morey would be the only female member of the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman''.
*In the "Cursed Crew" featurette shown in Disc 2 of the 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD and in Disc 2 of the Blu-ray release of ''At World's End'', creature designer Crash McCreery mistakenly referred to Morey having characteristics of a sea slug.
