'''Giselle''' is a character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Background==
Giselle lived in [[Tortuga]] during the Age of Piracy. She and [[Scarlett]] were believed to be prostitutes.

Giselle has blonde hair and was typically seen wearing a yellow dress. She had a history with [[Jack Sparrow]], but developed animosity towards him which Jack's casual relationship with Scarlett did nothing to ease.

Upon seeing him and Scarlett together in [[Tortuga]], Giselle slapped [[Jack Sparrow|Jack]] across the face; echoing a slap Jack had moments before received from the similarly-irate Scarlett.

Despite the divide between them, Scarlett and Giselle were often seen in each other's company in Tortuga. When [[Will Turner|William Turner]] searched for Jack Sparrow, the two claimed they had not seen Sparrow for a month, and asked if he could give him a message from them.

Jack was ultimately reunited with both Scarlett and Giselle following his rescue from Davy Jones' Locker and the end of the Battle of Calypso's maelstrom, and was again greeted with a slap after admitting he loved neither of them. Giselle and Scarlett departed in the company of [[Joshamee Gibbs]], while Jack set off on his quest for the [[Fountain of Youth]].

==Trivia==
*The name "Giselle" was chosen as a "classic-sounding Brit name that matched [[Scarlett]]."
