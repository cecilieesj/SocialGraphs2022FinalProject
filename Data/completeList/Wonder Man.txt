'''Wonder Man''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character. He will make his [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] debut as the eponymous protagonist of ''[[Wonder Man (TV series)|Wonder Man]]'', portrayed by [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]].

Wonder Man was created by [[Stan Lee]], Dick Ayers, Don Heck and Chic Stone.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
At the beginning of "[[Everything is Wonderful]]", it was shown that Tony Stark had bought Simon's company, but it was so until Tony revealed that he can save it since it "wasn't going to survive" meaning that Simon's company is going bankrupt.

Simon, however, is unaware of this and is angry and frustrated. Feeling powerless, he turns to his brother Eric who brings him to [[A.I.M.]], he is confronted by [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.C.]] who has the A.I.M. units turn him into Wonder Man. He ends up fighting Iron Man while Ant-Man tries to reason with him. When Wonder Man starts to destabilize, Iron Man tries to get him to his buildings Arc Reactor, but it is too late as Wonder Man fully destabilizes and disappears, which makes Tony feel very sad and disappointed when all that he wanted was to work with him. After the Avengers left, Enchantress re-assembled Wonder Man and recruited him for the Master of Evil in exchange to remain alive.

With no choice, he agreed. He was with them fighting the Avengers below the Avengers Mansion which ends with their defeat. When tasked by Zemo to guard the Norn Stone in a graveyard, he was reasoned with by Black Panther about his purpose. Convinced, he left the graveyard as the Dark Elves emerged from the ground. In Acts of Vengeance, he is seen being hunted along with the other Masters of Evil. He, Baron Zemo, and Abomination appear at the mansion for help. Black Panther convinced him to leave Zemo's side and that Tony Stark found a cure for his condition. Near the end of the episode, Wonder Man is teleported away when he stops Enchantress from using a Norn stone by destroying it and redeeming himself. His fate beyond that is unknown.

===''[[M.O.D.O.K. (TV series)|M.O.D.O.K.]]''===
Wonder Man is a "pending Avenger, underwear model and lover of [M.O.D.O.K.'s] wife" who serves as a pseudo antagonist to M.O.D.O.K. He begins to date his ex-wife [[Jodie Tarleton]] after having a chance encounter with her at a book store. Unbeknownst to him, Jodie begins to take advantage of Wonder Man; using him to get publicity for her book ''Jodify Your Life''. Upon him realizing this, he becomes heartbroken and breaks up with her; adding that she is just like her husband.

== Trivia ==
* Nathan Fillion filmed a cameo role as Simon Williams for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', but his scenes were ultimately not used in the final cut.
* In ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', Wonder Man is an enemy of the Avengers, in the comics he was a member of the team.
