'''Jordan''' is a character who appeared in the [[Disney Channel]] animated short series, ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]]''. She is the daughter of the [[Genie]].

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Jordan has a slender figure, and unlike her [[Genie|father]], she has a fair skin color rather than blue. She has light blue eyes and long, dark purple hair with violet highlights tied in a high ponytail. Under her right eyebrow, she has two dot markings and faint blue eye shadow.

Jordan's wardrobe includes harem pants, similar to her father's, a top decorated in jewelry and wears a golden jacket on top. Around her waist she wears a violet waistband and wears black suede high heel ankle boots with golden heels. Her jewelry includes four golden bracelets worn on her left wrist, a golden necklace that resembles [[Jasmine|Princess Jasmine's]], and wears a golden head chain that is centered with a sapphire.

===Powers and Abilities===
Like her father, Jordan can grant wishes to anyone who rubs her lamp. The wishes made can be granted without her knowing, control or consent. Aside from this ability, she can also magically change someone else's outfits when they are in her lamp, signifying that she can manipulate anything inside it to her heart's content.
