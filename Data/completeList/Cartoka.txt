== Personality ==
*Cartoka, like his sister Carly, lives only for speed and racing. They are both constantly looking for ways to make their race car, the Flashcar, faster, even if it means traveling to other worlds and stealing parts from other vehicles.

== Motive & Abilities ==

=== Motive ===
*Cartoka's main motive is to give his sister Carly the best possible race car.

=== Powers & Abilities ===

* '''Super Speed''': Even without a vehicle, Cartoka is much faster than a regular human.
* '''Engineering''': Cartoka is an excellent mechanic, and thus the one responsible for maintaining and upgrading the Flashcar. He can use parts of any vehicle to modify the Flashcar.

== Physical appearance ==
*Cartoka is humanoid in appearance, but with blue skin and an orange stripe across his face resembling a bandana, two bucked teeth, three fingers on his hands, and pointed ears. He has red eyes and black hair with purple at the tips. He wears a black racing jumpsuit with red trims going down the sides of his arms and legs and around his waist (where a white trim sits atop) and chest (where a pink star-shaped logo is placed) and red boots with yellow markings and padding and lights located on each side and his knees. There is also a light located on each of his shoulders and a jetpack behind his back.

When in the Flashcar, he wears a black, white, and purple helmet with an attached microphone and a black face-concealing visor, on which a blue-colored electronic mouth and eyes are projected. He also wears a technological armband on his right lower arm.
