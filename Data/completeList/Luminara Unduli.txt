'''Luminara Unduli''' is a Mirialan [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] and one of the main characters who appeared in the prequel film trilogy of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe.

==Background==
===Personality===
Luminara is very calm, physically disciplined, level-headed, and patient, as she rarely loses her temper. She is confident in her abilities, however, her confidence eventually increased to the point of arrogance and overconfidence, which resulted in her almost losing her life while fighting [[Asajj Ventress]]. Despite of these traits, she showed gratitude to her comrades and allies alike, as seen when Luminara was grateful to [[Ahsoka Tano]] for saving her from Asajj, and told Ahsoka she owed her life to her. She was one of the few Jedi to easily connect with her companions, and she complemented them during battle.

Luminara greatly cares for her former apprentice, Barriss Offee, but also maintains a very professional relationship with her. Keeping in mind the Jedi sense of detachment, Luminara was prepared to let go of Barriss in the event of her possible death.

As a Jedi, Luminara is highly intelligent and wise. Despite her serious demeanor, she has a sense of humor, as she stifled a snort of laughter at [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s "simple logic", during the Second Battle of Geonosis.

===Physical appearance===
Luminara has a slim, petite body with olive green skin, cobalt blue eyes, small eyebrows, and black fingernails and lips (lighter on the upper lip). She also has traditional Mirialan diamond tattoos on her chin and purple diamond tattoos on knuckles. Perhaps her most distinctive feature is her large folded headdress which she constantly wears, hiding her grey hair from view. 

Her usual garb consist of both a tight-fitting black long-sleeved top and textured skirt with three layers of a horizontal trim near the bottom, a complex two-piece belt above the waist with two round, silver plate-like fasteners, an intricate-patterned belt tabbard, brown trousers and Jedi boots, gauntlets, and shin guards. She wears a green, brown and black patterned cloak over her outfit, and beneath it is an under vest held on with a silver decorative broach.

Later, Luminara arrived with [[Mace Windu]]'s strike team to [[Geonosis]] in an attempt to rescue [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padm√© Amidala]]. Eventually they were all surrounded, but were saved thanks to [[Yoda]] and the Clone Army. She was made a senior general in the Clone Wars due to her wisdom, range of abilities, her political and tactical knowledge and leadership experience.
