'''Hercule Poirot''' is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of Agatha Christie's novels. He is a Belgian detective who appears in the [[2017]] live-action film ''Murder on the Orient Express'' and its [[2022]] sequel ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. As one of Christie's most famous and long-running characters, Poirot has appeared in more than 50 short stories published from [[Pre-1922#1920|1920]] to [[1975]].

==Appearance==
Poirot's name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time: Marie Belloc Lowndes' Hercule Popeau and Frank Howel Evans' Monsieur Poiret, a retired Belgian police officer living in [[London]].

A more obvious influence on the early Poirot stories is that of Arthur Conan Doyle. In ''An Autobiography'', Christie states, "I was still writing in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] tradition – eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a Lestrade-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp". For his part, Conan Doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s C. Auguste Dupin and his anonymous narrator, and basing his character Sherlock Holmes on Joseph Bell, who in his use of "ratiocination" prefigured Poirot's reliance on his "little grey cells".

Poirot also bears a striking resemblance to A. E. W. Mason's fictional detective Inspector Hanaud of the French Sûreté, who first appeared in the 1910 novel ''At the Villa Rose'' and predates the first Poirot novel by 10 years.

Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. Belgium's occupation by [[Germany]] during World War I provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be available to solve mysteries at an English country house. At the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the Belgians, since the invasion of their country had constituted Britain's ''casus belli'' for entering World War I, and British wartime propaganda emphasized the "Rape of Belgium".
