'''Miss Nanny''' is a supporting character from the revival of ''[[Muppet Babies (2018 series)|Muppet Babies]]''. She is the caretaker of the Muppet children at her daycare. Like her mother from the original series, her head is never seen.

==Background==
===Personality===
Miss Nanny is shown to be a sweet, down to earth woman with a good sense of humor. She pays attention to each of the Muppet Babies, and helps them with their problems. She is also very accepting of their personalities and quirks.

Miss Nanny loves making treats for the Muppets as well, and enjoys watching them put on shows.

Miss Nanny revealed in "[[The Great Muppet Sport-A-Thon]]" that she used to be a gymnast when she was younger. And as shown in "[[Frogs of a Feather]]" and "[[Upside-Down Day]]", Miss Nanny can do imitations of certain animals.

===Physical appearance===
While her head and face are never seen, Miss Nanny is shown to be a slender woman with fair skin and short hair. She wears a pink-hooded sweatshirt over a dark purple dress with matching ballet flats, and green tights with different patterns depending on the episode.

==Trivia==
*Miss Nanny's tights always have a pattern that corresponds to the theme of each episode. For example, in the episode "[[Sir Kermit the Brave]]", her tights featured dragons.
*Her tights changing patterns is similar to ''The Magic School Bus'', in which Miss Frizzle's clothing changes in every episode depending on the episode's topic.
*Unlike the original iteration of the nanny in the original series, she is always referred to as ''Miss'' Nanny. She also appears to be much younger than the nanny in the original series.
*Miss Nanny in the original series (made before Disney's purchase in [[2004]]) was voiced by Barbara Billingsley, whose performance as the aforementioned character gained her an achievement for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series. Billingsley retired from acting in [[2007]] and later passed away in [[2010]].
