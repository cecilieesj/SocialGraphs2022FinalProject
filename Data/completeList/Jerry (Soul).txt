'''Counselor Jerry''', or '''Jerries''', are collectively the supporting characters in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[2020]] animated feature film, ''[[Soul]]''. They are the entirety of the universe condensed into forms humans can comprehend. Their true names are unknown, but they call themselves Jerry.

==Background==
Jerries are a manifestation of dynamic energies, appearing in a comprehensible form, albeit abstract. The Jerries counsel and guide new souls and enlist mentors from the Great Beyond to be paired with soulmates. They interact with newborn and deceased souls, however not those currently living on earth.

===Personality===
Jerry is the entirety of the universe condensed into a form humans can comprehend. Jerry has as many forms as it needs or wishes for managing every soul in existence before they are sent to Earth. They have a counterpart, [[Terry]], who seems to be in charge of souls after death.

Most of the Jerrys show to be optimistic, helpful but most important kind to every soul no matter what, this was shown when they try to help a lost 22, and when they give Joe Gardner another chance to live.

Even do they work in the area of inspiration, they rarely get inspired, this happens because they probably know everything that exists in the universe and then being surprised can be difficult.

===Physical Appearance===
Jerry can change their forms fluidly and constantly. They usually appear as two-dimensional abstract humanoids in shades of translucent purple. They can grow limbs and change size and shape constantly.

===Abilities===
Because they are transcendent beings, they possess different abilities that souls don't have (except for shapeshifting).

They can shape-shift and change their form at their will to any possible situation (hiding from people, carrying souls, etc).

They also can open portals to almost every part of the universe (Earth, The Great Beyond, The Great Before, etc.), however it is unknown if they can go across the great beyond portal and come back.

===Official Description===
''The Counselors at The Great Before—there are a number of them—are all known as Jerry. Cheery, optimistic and (mostly) all-knowing, the ubiquitous Counselors run The You Seminar very much like camp counselors, wrangling dozens of new human souls, awarding them unique personalities and helping them find their spark and graduate to Earth. Each Jerry is a unique expression of the universe itself—employing patience, good cheer and passive-aggressive tendencies in different measures. But all maintain boundless enthusiasm for their metaphysical charges.''

==Appearances==
===''[[Soul]]''===
After Joe Gardner finds himself in the Great Before, he encounters Counselor Jerry A telling the new souls to give Joe some room by calming them down. She then introduces herself to Joe as Jerry explains to Joe that she is the coming together of all quantized field of the universe. She explains to Joe that the place he is at is known as the Great Before, now rebranded as the You Seminar. Jerry A then takes Joe back to the new souls playing with him. Meanwhile, Jerry E talks to Terry explaining to her that there is a soul missing in the Great Before. Jerry A then sends a group of new souls to their destination the Excitable Pavilion just as Joe curiously explains to Jerry A that this is the place where personalities come from, to which she agrees that this is the place he explains to her. He then asks her to know how souls get to Earth to which she explains that new souls use the Earth portal whenever they receive a complete personality just as Jerry A notices Joe trying to use the Earth portal to get back to Earth only to find himself in the Great Beyond numerous times after too many futile attempts.

Jerry A brings Jerry D who is looking for a lost mentor to which she thanks the other Jerry. Jerry A then feels appreciated that Joe is enjoying mentoring just as Jerry D directs Joe to another Jerry in the shape of a building. Terry then enters the Great Before and warns Jerry A that the soul counter is insufficient just as she explains to the Counselor that 151,000 souls enter the Great Beyond every day while explaining that her job as an accountant helps Terry keep track of souls that enter. All five Counselor Jerries appear in front of Terry using her soul counter to know how many souls are in the Great Beyond. Jerry A asks Terry to figure out the problem in counting souls to which Terry decides to follow the Counselors' task. As Terry goes to her office, she encounters Jerry D greeting her again to which Terry tells her that she has no time to talk to her as she looks into various documents to finish her assignment.

Jerry C then talks to an audience of new souls in a video inside the Jerry shaped like an auditorium where the Counselor explains that all new souls in the Great Before receive unique personalities. He then explains to the audience that in order to fill their missing spot on their badge each soul has on their body, new souls must find their spark at the Hall of Everything or the Hall of You so that souls can return to Earth. After the video, Jerry B then appears on stage and tells the audience about his favorite part of the program: matching mentors with their soul mates. The Counselor explains that the first mentor during the program is Maria Martinez, just as Jerry B then explains to the audience that Maria was a rare disease specialist from the University of Mexico, just as he congratulates her while giving Maria her matching soul. Joe (wearing Dr. Börgensson's name tag) walks on stage and is matched with [[22|Soul #22]], but notices 22 is not present on stage. Jerry B then tells Soul #22 to come out immediately to which she refuses to. Jerry B explains that Soul #22 has been at the Great Before for quite some time with some mentors like Gandhi, [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Mother Teresa just as he brings Soul #22 on stage. Jerry B then allows 22 to go with Joe, to which the two find themselves in a room full of Dr. Börgensson's memories.

Jerry B appears again telling 22 that her time is up, allowing her and Joe to return to the Great Beyond to which when 22 wants to experience breakdancing, the Counselor Jerry allows the two to get more time finding their spark in order to return to Earth.

Jerry A and B notice Terry who holds a file where she tells them that Joe Gardner is missing and is at the real world just as she plans to get Joe back to the Great Before to which the Counselors explain that she should avoid being seen by anyone in the real world. After Terry brings Joe and 22 back to the Great Before, the four Jerries congratulate Terry for finding Joe just as Jerry B plans to send Joe and 22 back to Earth. Joe then talks to Jerry B to know who 22's spark is to which Joe explains that playing the piano is his spark, to which he explains to Joe that a spark isn't a soul's purpose, explaining to him that Joe's mentors and passions are his purpose and meanings and life just before Jerry B leaves away. During a ceremony with Terry inside the Jerry-shaped auditorium, Jerry B gives Terry a trophy as a request from her just as an audience of Jerries applaud her. Terry tells the other Jerrys that she is ectastic for the award she deserved, to which the ceremony is disrupted when 22 (as a lost soul) breaks through as Jerry B retains the trophy and decides to keep it for himself just as Joe tries to go after 22. 22 then bursts out of the Jerry-shaped auditorium just as he becomes uncomfortable upon feeling 22 bursting through him as Joe tries to stop her just as he also notices Joe going after her. Four Counselor Jerries surround 22 to calm her just as Joe decides to apologize to her for being rude, convincing her to find her spark.

After 22 finally reaches her purpose, Joe finds himself at the Great Beyond. Jerry A appears in front of Joe just as she allows Joe to give him one more chance to return back to Earth so that Joe can continue finding his spark while Jerry B tells Terry using an abacus to notice Joe returning to Earth just as Jerry A finally sends Joe back to Earth.

===''[[22 vs. Earth]]''===
Jerry A and B are first seen directing new souls to Earth just as the two approach Neptune for completing his Earth Pass just as the two Counselors direct him and the fellow soul to Earth. As part of 22's plan for some new souls to obey her plan on not going to Earth, 22 catches one of the souls being directed by Jerry A without being noticed by the Counselor. Jerry A and B then stare at 22 who believe she is making new friends just as D-pac, one of the souls following 22, receives a liar badge and completes her Earth Pass, followed by Moonbeam earning his much to Jerry B's notice to what Moonbeam did to him. After Macaroni receives her Earth Pass and 22 tosses her to Earth for failing her plan to follow 22's plan, Jerry A and B begin to hope that 22 would sometime go to Earth and achieve her spark like all the new souls were doing in the You Seminar.
