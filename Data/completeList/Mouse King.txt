The '''Mouse King''' is a minor character featured in the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. He appeared in the episode "[[Team Tiny]]".

The Mouse King resided inside the walls of the Bear Family house. He was rumored by [[Brian (Goldie and Bear)|Brian]] big, sneaky, and scary. He lived in a makeshift throne room full of objects he had collected over the years. Of course, the only reason he gathered things was because he longed for something to be proud of. [[Mama Bear]]'s ring was his latest addition, but after Goldie, Bear and their tiny friends had a discussion with him, the Mouse King gives the ring back, telling about how he never realized how much it meant to her.
