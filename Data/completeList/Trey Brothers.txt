==History==
He guest starred on ''[[So Random!]]'', to the delight of [[Tawni Hart|Tawni]] and Sonny, who were both fans. [[Sonny]], at first, pretends not to care about Trey, but later on reveals that she is a huge fan of his. Sonny wanted to show him one of her songs, but Tawni stole her song and presented it to Trey as her own. She got a taste of her own medicine when Trey stole the song from ''her''. He also stolen [[ Nico Harris|Nico]]'s hat, [[Grady Mitchell|Grady]]'s jacket, and [[Chad Dylan Cooper|Chad]]'s b-bangs and f-fangs. Nico and Grady trapped him in a box so that Sonny could talk with him, but he kept interrupting her, calling her a "dabbler" over and over to try to make her feel inferior. Sonny knocked on the box, accidentally making him disappear and replaced by Tawni. He later showed up at the very end of the episode to return Chad's fangs and bangs, but not before stealing the "Dylan" part of Chad's name, his limo, and his catchphrase, "Peace out, suckers." Chad is angry and chases after him to reclaim his limo.
