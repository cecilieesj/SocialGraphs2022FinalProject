'''Mayor Baba''' is the mayor of [[Spoonerville]] from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] 1992-1993 animated series, ''[[Goof Troop]].''
==Background==
He appears in various episodes hosting events, making promotions, and other mayor-type jobs. He has two historical counterparts that appear in the episodes "[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]" and "[[Sherlock Goof]]". Additionally, he has two more historical counterparts that share his name and appear in the episodes "[[The Ungoofables]]" and "[[Gunfight at the Okie-Doke Corral]]".

===Personality===
Mayor Baba is a nice man who always means well. He is very competent and appreciates honesty.

===Physical appearance===
Mayor Baba's appearance differs between each episode.

In "[[Inspector Goofy]]", he is an overweight anthropomorphic dog with black fur. He wears a light brown dress jacket, a dark brown vest, a light tan collared shirt, brown dress pants, dark brown dress shoes, a dark brown string tie, and a brown top hat with a white band.

In "[[Tub Be or Not Tub Be]]", he is still overweight, but he has gray fur instead of black. Also, he wears a navy blue jacket instead of a light brown one, a red vest instead of dark brown, blue pants instead of brown, black shoes instead of brown, a black string tie instead of dark brown, and a blue hat with a red band instead of a brown hat with a white band. However, his shirt is the same.

In the episode "[[In Goof We Trust]]", his appearance is largely the same as his previous one, but with a lighter blue jacket, a darker vest, a yellow shirt, lighter blue pants, a pink string tie, and a darker hat band. He also carries a walking stick.

However, in the episode "[[Window Pains]]", he has a completely different appearance that bears no similarity to his prior designs. He is slim, wears a black dress jacket, white collared shirt, hot pink tie, gray pinstripe pants, white gloves, and glasses. His shoes are the same.

===Role in the series===
In "[[Inspector Goofy]]", Mayor Baba nominates [[Goofy]] as the chief inspector after firing the old one for being lazy. However, after Goofy threatens to shut down City Hall, the mayor changes his mind.

In "[[Tub Be or Not Tub Be]]", he hosts the tub race, which [[Pete]] supposedly wins. However, the mayor notices a jet engine from behind Pete's tub while examining the photo. This prompts Pete to award Goofy the first place prize in order to maintain his "Honest Pete" racing name.

In the episode "[[In Goof We Trust]]", the mayor honors Goofy with the "Most Honest Man" award. However, Pete uses a hypnotizing helmet to convince Goofy to work for him. Under the effects of the helmet, Goofy steals the mayor's car. Furious, the mayor confronts Pete, who claims he was simply washing the car.

In "[[Window Pains]]", the mayor publicly announces [[Peg]] as City Hall's official window washer, but Pete protests that an election should have been held, prompting the mayor to agree to hire the one of them who washes windows the best.

==Trivia==
*He is never actually referred to by name in the series. His name comes from the fact that two of his historical counterparts—those from "[[The Ungoofables]]" and "[[Gunfight at the Okie-Doke Corral]]"—are both named "Mayor Baba". It stands to reason that the present-day mayor would also share this name just as Goofy and Pete share their names with several of their own historical counterparts (e.g. - Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees, Sir Pete, Mopalong Goofy, Pecos Pete, Chief Pete).
*In "[[Window Pains]]", a different animation model is used for the mayor, one used in many other episodes for a background resident of Spoonerville most commonly seen in civilian crowd shots. Whether this was on purpose or by accident is not known.
*In "[[A Goof of the People]]", Goofy is elected mayor of [[Spoonerville]]. Mayor Baba is never seen nor mentioned.
