{{Quote|How dare you! All of you- standing around, deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won!|Princess Jasmine|Aladdin (film)}}
'''Princess Jasmine''' is the deuteragonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1992]] animated feature film, ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''. She is the independent and rebellious princess of [[Agrabah]], a Middle Eastern kingdom ruled by her father, the [[Sultan]]. As the future Sultana, Jasmine has a strong sense of obligation to her kingdom. Because of outdated laws, however, she was forbidden to go beyond the [[The Sultan's Palace|palace]] walls and was forced to follow unjust practices. Refusing to be treated like a sheltered object, Jasmine desperately aspires to diverge from her societal confines, to live a life where she is free to make her own choices.

Jasmine is loosely based on the character of Princess Badroulbadour from the ''Aladdin'' fairy tale featured in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' storybook collection. She is also the sixth official member of the [[Disney Princess]] line-up, and the first to be of non-Caucasian descent.

==Background==
Jasmine is the daughter of the [[Sultan]] of [[Agrabah]] and his [[Jasmine's Mother|late wife]], residing in the kingdom's lavished [[The Sultan's Palace|palace]] alongside her father and loyal pet tiger, [[Rajah]], whom she found several years before the events of the film. She believed him to be a spiritual gift from her mother, who would tell her stories about the "star tiger" named Rajah.<ref>Disney. ''Tales from Agrabah''. Chapter Book, 1995. Print.</ref> It is revealed in the book ''Tales from Agrabah'' that, whenever Jasmine would long for her mother, she would sit on her balcony and stargaze for a period of time.

Because of her status as a princess, Jasmine was unfortunately forbidden to ever leave the palace walls, spending her life sheltered within the confines of the royal home. She often felt suffocated by the laws of her kingdom, which restricted her from socializing with her subjects and forced her to constantly meeting suitors to possibly arrange marriages. This situation ultimately prevented Jasmine from making any connections, as she had never had any true friends (aside from Rajah), and left her with the desire to see the world and experience life outside of being a sheltered princess, which would eventually result in meeting Aladdin.

===Official Description===
:''Jasmine is a dreamer who loves her pet tiger, Rajah. She's free-spirited, confident, and kind. When she meets Aladdin, she discovers the wonders she's often imagined outside the palace walls.''

===Development===
Loosely inspired by the ''Aladdin'' folk tale, [[Howard Ashman]]'s [[1988]] treatment for an animated adaptation of ''Aladdin'' included a shallow, spoiled, and materialistic princess named Jasmine, whose "brattiness" served as comic relief in the story. Her personality was fleshed out in the song "[[Call Me A Princess]]", in which she arrogantly flaunts her royal status. There was also another female character, a tomboyish street urchin named Abbi, who joined Aladdin on his quest to rescue the princess. At the end of Ashman's treatment, Aladdin is offered the princess' hand in marriage, but he ultimately refuses in favor of his true love, Abbi. However, as development on an ''Aladdin'' film furthered at the studio, Ashman's screenplay saw major revisions. The Abbi character was cut, while Jasmine was given a larger role as Aladdin's love interest. Furthermore, Jasmine's "spoiled brat" persona was scrapped in favor of a character that was more endearing and sympathetic.<ref name="howard">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/music/2014/04/aladdin-in-our-collections-and-now-on-broadway/|title=Aladdin: In Our Collections and Now on Broadway!|date=April 1, 2014}}</ref>

In [[Linda Woolverton]]'s screenplay, the relationship between Aladdin and Jasmine served as a driving force of the narrative, slowly replacing Aladdin's desire to [[Proud of Your Boy|make his mother proud]] (as was the case in Ashman's treatment). Woolverton also gave the princess a human handmaiden for a friend. Although [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] enjoyed the love story blossoming between Aladdin and Jasmine, they believed Woolverton's script featured too many human characters and seemed better suited for a live-action format as a consequence. They sought to remedy the issue by adding characters that were "animation-friendly", thus, the handmaiden was replaced with a [[Rajah|pet tiger]].<ref name="treatment">{{Cite web|url=https://www.howardashman.com/blog/john-musker-question-countdown-number-9|title=John Musker Question Countdown - Number 9}}</ref>

Even with Musker and Clements on board to direct, there was still work to be done with the story. While observing preliminary sketches of Aladdin and Jasmine (the former of whom was portrayed as a young boy, while Jasmine was a young woman), [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] believed that a love story between the two would be seen as unrealistic, as a woman of Jasmine's age and beauty would never fall for a juvenile like Aladdin. Screenwriters [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] called for an aged up and redesigned Aladdin, while also expanding Jasmine's character to be "stronger".<ref name="ted">{{Cite web|url=content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,158290,00.html|title=Aladdin's Magic|date=June 24, 2001}}</ref>

===Personality===
{{Quote|You're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.|Genie to Aladdin, about Jasmine}}
Jasmine is introduced as feisty and no-nonsense, with zero tolerance for anyone who dares to belittle her. She initially rejected her role as a princess because of the unethical requirements that come with the role, including being forced to remain within the palace at all times, forced to marry for political gain rather than love, and treated as a tool rather than her own person. After gaining her independence by the end of ''Aladdin'', Jasmine is shown to be very much a ruler of Agrabah alongside her father, instead of merely sitting around on the sidelines. She takes part in most political disputes and garners an amount of respect equal to her father.

Strong-willed and defiant, Jasmine is not afraid to speak her mind, nor will she hesitate to stand up for what she believes is right. Her open resentment towards Agrabah's outdated laws, and her belief that people should be judged solely by their character rather than their background, shows that she is progressive. This mentality allowed her to see the goodness in Aladdin, despite his background as a street urchin. In "[[Garden of Evil]]", she was able to see the humanity in the plant creature [[Arbutus]], whereas others assumed that he was a soulless monster.

However, Jasmine's attitude often put her at odds with her father and other members of the elite, who were content with sticking to the status quo and expressed frustration with her refusal to do the same. She has been something of an outcast amongst royalty as a result, so she developed a standoffish nature and sometimes acts incredibly stubborn as a defense mechanism. More comically, releasing Rajah on those who annoy her is another defense mechanism for which she has become infamous.

While the movie focuses on Jasmine's goal to achieve individuality, the television series explores her outstanding devotion to her kingdom and people. In "[[Bad Mood Rising]]", Jasmine explains that she rules under the philosophy that, "A princess knows the needs of the people outweigh her own". Following that belief, she risked her life for Agrabah on numerous occasions: In the original ''Aladdin'', despite not being a fighter yet, she was quick to aid Aladdin in the final battle against sorcerer [[Jafar]] by grabbing hold of the latter's snake staff. When her kingdom was terrorized in "[[Armored and Dangerous]]", she leaped into battle, with only Carpet by her side, to defend her people from [[Dominus Tusk]]'s wrath. In "[[The Ethereal]]", she sacrificed her life to save a child's life, which in turn saved Agrabah from destruction at the hands of the Ethereal. In ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', Jasmine attempts to contribute to Agrabah in ways that don't include flaunting her status as a princess - such as volunteering in schools or hospitals.

Being aware of her sex appeal and its effect on others, Jasmine is notorious for flaunting her assets to gain the trust of her enemies, only to betray and/or humiliate them when the time is right. A prominent example of this occurred when Jafar took over Agrabah; when Aladdin tried to steal back the lamp, she took advantage of Jafar's lust for her by pretending to be madly in love with him to cover for Aladdin. Another example is when Aladdin (under the alias of Prince Ali) appeared on her balcony in an attempt to woo her; she used her sex appeal and flirting gestures to make Aladdin think he was making progress, only to shatter his hope and embarrass him.

Despite her cunning, Jasmine can sometimes be too fussy and act without thinking things through. She was willing to leave the palace without knowing the difference in customs between royalty and commoners; this is shown by her donating an apple to a child and being confused when the vendor demanded that she pay for it. In "[[Do the Rat Thing]]", she took offense when Aladdin declared that she didn't know what it's like to be a "street rat", despite the fact that he was right.

===Physical appearance===
Jasmine was animated and designed by [[Mark Henn]], her facial structure is modeled after his sister, Beth Henn. She is a very beautiful, slender young girl of average height with a hourglass figure. She has olive skin, high cheekbones, brown eyes with full eyelashes, and straight, lush hair reaching her thighs.

Jasmine's casual outfit was designed to be simple, resembling that of Arabian Harem women. She wears a sky blue (later turquoise) crop top that reveals her midriff and navel with sewn-in off-the-shoulder straps, matching puffy pants with a light-blue V-shaped waistline and golden, curled shoes. Her hair is worn in a ponytail in two sections with matching teal bands and ending in a small swirl with this outfit. She wears a turquoise headband which is centered with a sapphire with a gold border adorned into it. She also dons two large golden earrings completely covering her ears and a matching necklace.

For formal occasions, such as the announcement of her engagement, Jasmine wears a purple dress. Opposite of her casual wear, this dress covers most of her body like a normal gown, with the fabric reigning down from her shoulders to her feet. The top half of the dress is strapless, and the lower half consists of a belt piece (centered with a sapphire) and a transparent pink veil that flows down, just below her calves. She also wears a headband with a similar royal blue jewel, while her hair is tied in a ponytail similar to the one associated with her casual outfit, though the bands are purple instead of blue.

When disguising herself as a commoner on the streets of Agrabah, Jasmine wears a brown abaya, with a matching hijab. The outfit would later become casual for her outings in the marketplace, as seen in her later appearances. In ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', Jafar used this outfit and her usual palace clothes as his main disguised forms.

When Jafar takes control of Agrabah for a short while, he makes Jasmine wear red harem pants with a matching bandeau bikini top, both made of silk, with several golden accessories, such as a snake armlet on her right arm and triangular, gold earrings. Her hair is also tied in a high ponytail, with a golden seemingly metallic band. Jafar later creates a gold tiara for Jasmine from her shackles when he decides to make her his queen.

During the finale, Jasmine wears a violet strapless tube top, with matching pants consisting of linings around the waist that come full circle and end with a blue, encrusted jewel. Her shoulders are covered by a transparent, blue veil that reaches down to her waist. The outfit is completed by purple bands to tie into her ponytail and the gold earrings she has with her casual outfit.

When she has a discussion with Aladdin about Iago's presence, Jasmine wears another formal outfit; her cropped tube top is now lavender with pink trim and long sleeves, her lavender harem pants gain a matching short greave with a pink trim adorned with a sapphire at the center and brown curled shoes. Her hair clips and headband are adorned with a sapphire at the center are lavender to match her outfit, and she wears a gold necklace on her neck and different dangling earrings on both of her ears.

In ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', Jasmine incorporates both of her outfits in the previous films. She wears a pink long-sleeved tube top with white collared sleeves on each side, pink harem pants with white trim, and brown curled shoes. She wears a pink hat instead of a headband and retains her gold necklace and earrings from her first casual outfit. Her hair clips are also pink to match her outfit.

Jasmine's other outfit is identical to her first casual outfit but is pink with gold trim. She wears a dark pink and light purple Arabian jacket with a gold trim beneath it. Her headband is gold and has a ruby gem in the center, and she maintains her gold accessories.

Jasmine's initial appearance and at the end of the film (where she is finally married to Aladdin, and they set off on their honeymoon) is a simple white Arabian wedding dress with a gold trim adorned with an amethyst gem on the chest and a gold sparkle designs at her dress skirt. Her hair is loose with lavender flowers on each side adorned and a long white wedding veil.

===Abilities===
*'''Intuitive Aptitude:''' Jasmine is quite intuitive and intelligent, has described herself as a fast learner. After one demonstration from Aladdin, she was able to pole vault across a rooftop. Jasmine has been able to manipulate foes and read people for their true intentions, such as Prince Achmed, Jafar, [[Mirage]] or even [[Chaos]], showing an ability to uncover lies and secrets. This is prominently seen during her night with "Prince Ali" when she suspected that he is the same boy that she met in the marketplace. After spending more time together, she tricks him into confirming her suspicions, proving that she is smart enough to outsmart a street-wise street rat.
*'''Animal Empathy:''' With her kind-hearted nature, Jasmine has shown a remarkable affinity to most animals she encounters. Most noticeably is the massive Rajah, who is undeniably loyal to her and acts more akin to a house pet with her. Other animals, such as Iago in their adventures together and even random fishes, tend to take a liking to her.
*'''Multilingual:''' As an aspiring queen, Jasmine can speak several unspecified languages, as it was briefly mentioned in ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams''.
*'''Skill Hand-to-Hand Combatant:''' As seen in the television series, as well as Aladdin and the King of Thieves, Jasmine eventually garnered skills in combat, being able to hold her own in battle against thieves and other antagonists. She is rather unmerciful in battle, as seen in "[[The Secret of Dagger Rock]]", "[[The Great Rift]]" and "[[The Vapor Chase]]" In the episode "[[A Sultan Worth His Salt]]", Jasmine is shown to be skilled in the use of weaponry for combat. Her skills are arguably best showcased in "[[Forget Me Lots]]", where she (under magical amnesia) easily battled and nearly defeated Aladdin, as well as numbers of other characters. Both that episode and "[[The Wind Jackals of Mozenrath]]" feature a whip as her personal weapon of choice, with which she displays exceptional skill in an offense, defense, and even non-combat ingenuity.
*'''Physical Strength:''' Despite her appearance, Jasmine has impressive physical strength, as she could push a large statue in Aladdin and the King of Thieves, and a boulder in "My Fair Aladdin" and beat a thug with a punch in Aladdin and the King of Thieves.
*'''Horse Riding:''' In ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales'', Jasmine notes that she has been riding horses since before she could even walk.

==Appearances==
===''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''===
[[File:Aladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-1398.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine and Rajah in ''Aladdin''.]]
Jasmine is the daughter of the Sultan of Agrabah. By law, Jasmine must be married to a prince by her next birthday, which is in three more days. The Sultan is angered and frustrated when she rejects the various suitors that approach her - even going as far as to allow Rajah to attack them. She is unwilling to marry any of the princes her father suggests, as she proclaims that ''if'' she decides to marry, it will be for love rather than for wealth, power, and tradition. She also alludes that suitors see her as a mere prize to be won, a man's possession, rather than their equal lover. Jasmine continues with the distress that she's never had any friends nor has even been outside the palace walls, believing she should be allowed the chance to experience life before being forced into marriage. Though the Sultan shows sympathy, he explains that he simply wants to ensure that Jasmine is provided for after he passes, though this is not enough to sway Jasmine's opinions.

[[File:Beggar Jasmine.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine, under the guise of a commoner.]]
To escape her plight, Jasmine runs away from home while disguised as a peasant, doing so in the dead of night, despite an attempt by Rajah to stop her from sneaking out out of concern for her. Having never been outside the palace before, she inadvertently gets into trouble when she gives an apple to a young boy without paying for it. Before the merchant can punish her by amputating her hand, a street urchin named [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] quickly intervenes and saves her by claiming that Jasmine is his mentally-ill sister. Jasmine plays along, pretending that she believes [[Abu]] to be the Sultan and that a camel is her doctor. Aladdin leads Jasmine to his home, where they talk and continuously connect. Aladdin reveals his wish to escape the struggles of being a "street rat", while Jasmine wishes for freedom. They both come to realize they have a lot in common by feeling "trapped" in the life they were born into. Jasmine and Aladdin begin to develop romantic feelings for each other and lean to share a kiss, but the royal guards led by [[Razoul]] suddenly arrive. They try to escape but are surrounded, eventually leading to Aladdin's arrest. Jasmine reveals herself to the guards as the princess and demands that they release Aladdin. Razoul explains he can't as his orders come from [[Jafar]], not Jasmine's father, and must be taken up with him to secure Aladdin's release.

When Jasmine angrily confronts Jafar upon returning to the palace, the latter claims that Aladdin was charged with kidnapping the princess. Jasmine explains that she wasn't kidnapped, but willingly ran away, only for Jafar to lie, declaring that Aladdin cannot be released on account that his sentence has already been carried out: death by beheading, meaning he's been executed. Shaken, a saddened and furious Jasmine leaves the room and mourns the loss of her only friend, feeling responsible for his death and didn't even know his name. Upon noticing his daughter's depressed state, the Sultan comforts Jasmine and learns the story of Aladdin and her outing. Jafar is promptly chastised over the matter, but Jasmine still holds a grudge against the Vizier, swearing to "get rid of him" once she becomes queen. Unbeknownst to Jasmine, Aladdin is alive and was sent to the [[Cave of Wonders]] to retrieve a lamp by orders of a disguised Jafar. Aladdin ends up trapped within the cave during the mission, with the lamp, and subsequently, releases a [[Genie]] and becomes his master.

[[File:Aladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-6964.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine experiencing a life of freedom for the first time during "[[A Whole New World]]".]]
After Aladdin's wish to become a prince is granted by the Genie, he parades through the streets of Agrabah under the guise of 'Prince Ali Ababwa'. She initially believes him to be just another arrogant suitor and shows no interest in him. After hearing 'Prince Ali' speak to the Sultan about his intentions to "win Jasmine," she becomes disgusted with Ali's suggestion that she is only a prize and refuses to meet with him, telling off Ali, her father, and Jafar before storming back to her room. That night, Ali visits Jasmine on her balcony and makes an unsuccessful attempt to woo her, prompting the frustrated Jasmine to tell him to jump off the balcony. Ali complies and surprises her with a [[Magic Carpet]]. Jasmine finally begins to warm up to Ali upon seeing that he is actually interested in getting to know her when he expressed she is right that she should be free to make her own choice as a person, but immediately deduces that Ali is the boy from the marketplace when he asks her if she trusts him. Confident in her theory, Jasmine accepts Ali's proposal to go for a Magic Carpet ride - in during which, the two fall in love. After the carpet takes the two to watch some fireworks in China, Jasmine tricks Ali into revealing the truth. She is, at first, angered with his lies, feeling demeaned, but Ali claims that he sometimes dresses up as a commoner to "escape the pressures of palace life," which she relates to, softening her attitude and prompting her to forgive him. Meanwhile, Jasmine is then taken back to the palace, where she and Ali share their first kiss, cementing their romantic relationship.

[[File:Aladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-7823.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine and Ali's engagement is announced to the Sultan.]]
In her bedroom, Jasmine blissfully contemplates her growing affections for Ali, just when her father arrives and claims to have chosen a husband for her: Jafar. A disgusted Jasmine refuses, telling her father that she's chosen Ali, though Jafar claims, "Prince Ali left". Just then, Ali arrives and accuses Jafar of attempted murder. Jafar scoffs at the accusations, and the Sultan suspiciously agrees, much to Jasmine's confusion. Prince Ali suddenly grabs [[Jafar's Snake Staff]] and destroys it. He then reveals that Jafar has been controlling the Sultan with it. With Jafar revealed to be a traitor, he is confronted by Jasmine, Ali, the Sultan, and the guards, though he manages to escape. The Sultan was initially distraught at the situation, but he quickly perks up upon realizing that Jasmine has finally chosen her suitor in Ali. The Sultan gives the couple his blessings and informs them that they will be married as soon as possible, also revealing that Ali will then become the next Sultan once they are wed. Unknown to either the Sultan or Jasmine, however, Ali was disturbed by the news, feeling undeserving of such power, and Jasmine's love.

[[File:Aladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-8488.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine refuses to bow to Sultan Jafar.]]
The following day, the Sultan announces Ali and Jasmine's engagement in front of the palace. Jasmine is delighted to have her engagement announced, as she is happy to have found someone who truly loves her. She watches from behind the curtains as her father gives his speech and soon takes note of Ali's arrival by preparing him to make his appearance to the crowd. Just then, Jafar arrives and takes control of the kingdom, having stolen control of the lamp. Though her father cowers in fear, Jasmine refuses to obey Jafar's commands as Sultan, prompting him to use his next wish to become the most powerful sorcerer in the world. He then uses his new abilities to forcefully have the two former rulers bow to him. Once Ali rushes in to protect Jasmine, Jafar sadistically reveals the supposed Prince as a fraud. Aladdin struggles to explain the truth to a confused Jasmine, having made an attempt to do so earlier, but Jafar separates the two, sending Aladdin to freeze to death at the ends of the Earth, while Jasmine and the Sultan are left to suffer his wrath in a dystopian Agrabah.

[[File:Aladdin-disneyscreencaps.com-9051.jpg.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Using her own wit and cunning, Jasmine distracts Jafar.]]
In the palace, Jasmine has been relegated to serve as Jafar's chained slave. She is forced to watch her father be tortured by Iago, but Jafar eventually adheres to her plea to spare him. While admiring Jasmine's beauty, Jafar proposes to have the princess become his queen. She hotly refuses, soaking the tyrant with a glass of wine and angering him to the point of near physical abuse. Instead, Jafar decides to use his final wish to have Jasmine fall desperately in love with him, much to her horror. The Genie tries to explain that his magic cannot be used to make people fall in love, but the impatient Jafar refuses to listen, confronting his slave.

Meanwhile, Jasmine spots Aladdin in the distance, alive and plotting to steal back the lamp. To help him do so, Jasmine manipulates Jafar into believing she's fallen madly in love with him and seductively keeps his attention away from the lurking Aladdin. Iago notices this and tries to alert Jafar, but Abu stops him. When their scuffle briefly grabs Jafar's attention, Jasmine, out of desperation, turns him back to her with a kiss, which shocks and disgusts Aladdin, Abu, and even Iago. Once Jasmine and Jafar break the kiss, the latter spots Aladdin's reflection in Jasmine's tiara and immediately attacks.

[[File:Aladdin-9956.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine and Aladdin officially get together.]]
A battle follows, and as Aladdin and Jafar confront one another, Jasmine defends her lover and attacks Jafar, only to be quickly overpowered by him. She gets back on her feet and goes for the lamp, only to be imprisoned in a giant hourglass by Jafar. With sand slowly filling the glass, Jafar uses Jasmine's oncoming death to distract Aladdin, who simultaneously tries to retrieve the lamp and save Jasmine. Aladdin ultimately manages to defeat Jafar by tricking him into using his last wish to become a genie and imprisoning him within his own lamp, thus saving the kingdom and freeing Jasmine and the Sultan. With peace restored, Aladdin apologizes for his lies, though Jasmine ultimately forgives him as she knows why he did it, lamenting the fact that they can't be together because of the law. The Genie, however, urges Aladdin to use his last wish to regain his princely status. Aladdin declines this, however, and instead uses the final wish to set Genie free. Believing Aladdin has proven his worth by saving the kingdom, despite not being a prince, the Sultan decides to abolish the law, declaring the princess is free to marry whomever she deems worthy. Jasmine immediately chooses Aladdin, showing that she truly loves him. After seeing the Genie off, a celebration is held in Jasmine and Aladdin's honor.

===''[[The Return of Jafar]]''===
[[File:JasmineinTheReturnofJafar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine in ''The Return of Jafar''.]]
In the first direct-to-video sequel, ''The Return of Jafar'', Jasmine begins to question her choice in Aladdin, wondering if he was trustworthy enough after defending Iago, Jafar's former pet parrot who had terrorized her father. She quickly gets over these questions with Iago's help, when he reminds her of how much she loves Aladdin, and using reverse psychology and calling her bluff in the song "Forget About Love".

Jasmine apologizes to Iago soon after when he suggests Aladdin and the Sultan go for a carpet ride together (which is, in fact, a trap), and her kindness almost prompts Iago into a confession, but Jafar scares him into silence before Iago can say anything further.

She is later captured by Jafar, who magically impersonates her in an attempt to have Aladdin killed off by framing him for the Sultan's murder and having him executed by Razoul via beheading. It seems to be primarily her disappointment and anger at Iago for double crossing Aladdin, which finally prompts him to help free Genie, much to her and her father's surprise and realization that he's still on their side and is fully counting on him. Jasmine accepts Iago as a friend after he rescued everyone and showed full trust by clearing him and explaining to Aladdin what he did for them, and after he helps defeat Jafar for good. At the end of the film, Jasmine goes with Aladdin to see the world.

===''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin: The Series]]''===
[[File:TV Series Jasmine.png|thumb|250px|Jasmine in the ''Aladdin'' TV series.]]
In the series, Jasmine aids Aladdin, Abu, Carpet, Iago, and the Genie in their adventures, often proving herself to be a valuable aid in their adventures and not just a damsel in distress. She is shown to have excellent fighting skills, possibly learned by adventuring with Aladdin. She also has several episodes (including "[[Garden of Evil]]", "[[Forget Me Lots]]", "[[Do the Rat Thing]]", "[[The Secret of Dagger Rock]]", and "[[SandSwitch]]") in which her personality, skill, and intelligence are focused on.

Of all the members of the group, Jasmine has made the most daring sacrifices often giving up her freedom to save her loved ones or even complete strangers. She once commented on this in the episode "[[Bad Mood Rising]]", telling Aladdin "I was raised a princess, Aladdin, and a princess knows, the needs of the people out-weighs her own." A good example would be in "[[The Ethereal]]" when she sacrificed herself to save a boy named [[Tanti]], convincing said envoy into calling off her attack on Agrabah and reviving Jasmine. However, when scorned or threatened, Jasmine can become quite enraged at her offender, including Aladdin.

The series also focuses on Aladdin and Jasmine's growing romantic relationship. The two are currently engaged and continue to let their relationship grow and develop as they become closer and their love grows stronger before they are ready for marriage. Aladdin and Jasmine are best friends throughout the series and often serve as each other's confidantes whenever the other is troubled or uncertain. However, they aren't without their own issues as the couple also deals with regular problems such as arguments between them. Jasmine often finds herself annoyed with Aladdin for his occasional ego or when Aladdin is mad at Jasmine for her stubbornness and at times refusal to listen, but they both accept each other's flaws and work through their problems together.

Both Aladdin and Jasmine continue to grow significantly with each other by their side, but they often find their love tested and having to face a few obstacles that threaten to keep them apart. Jasmine often finds herself facing off against romantic rivals, from the former street rat turned sand witch [[Sadira]], to the wicked sea sorceress [[Saleen]], who both try to steal Aladdin away from her and attempt to break off their relationship. The attempts are foiled, however, as Aladdin and Jasmine have proven time and again that they only love each other and no one else. Aladdin and Jasmine's love is shown and proven to be incredibly strong on various occasions where they both are willing to do whatever it takes to protect each other whenever they see the other in times of danger. Examples include when Jasmine was turned into a humanoid snake creature by [[Mirage (Aladdin)|Mirage]] in attempts to destroy their love and tried to convince Jasmine, Aladdin only loved her for her beauty. Mirage's plot almost succeeded since due to their now different species, Jasmine could no longer be with Aladdin. However, Aladdin willingly gives up his humanity and becomes one himself just so he could be with Jasmine forever, proving Aladdin truly loves Jasmine for who she is and not just simply for her beauty.

Jasmine appears in almost every episode of the TV series, with the exceptions of "[[Much Abu About Something]]", "[[Never Say Nefir]]", "[[Air Feather Friends]]", "[[Some Enchanted Genie]]", "[[Rain of Terror]]", "[[Opposites Detract]]", "[[Caught by the Tale]]" (albeit mentioned only), "[[Beast or Famine]]", "[[The Animal Kingdom]]", "[[The Sands of Fate]]", "[[The Citadel]]", "[[Snowman is an Island]]", "[[In the Heat of the Fright]]" (in actual person, albeit Mirage is disguised as her), "[[The Seven Faces of Genie]]", "[[A Clockwork Hero]]", "[[Sea No Evil]]", "[[Smells Like Trouble]]", "[[The Love Bug (Aladdin)|The Love Bug]]", "[[Genie Hunt]]", "[[The Lost Ones]]", "[[Shark Treatment]]", "[[The Lost City of the Sun]]" and "[[The Book of Khartoum]]" (albeit mentioned only).

===''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''===
[[File:Kingofthieves153.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine in her wedding dress, as seen in ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves''.]]
Finally, in the third direct-to-video movie ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'', she and Aladdin are finally about to be wed, when their wedding is interrupted by the Forty Thieves. During the fight, Jasmine personally knocks one of the thieves out cold with a single punch, before angrily telling him, "That was for ruining my wedding!" After learning what they were after, Aladdin finds out from the Oracle that his father, [[Cassim]], is still alive. Jasmine convinces him to seek out his father, and that their wedding can be delayed a little longer.

While he is away, Jasmine grows worried and Genie cheers her up by dressing her in bridal outfits (And comically posing as many iconic celebrities and movie characters, one of which [[Robin Williams]] himself played the role of). When Aladdin returns with Cassim, she and the Sultan take an immediate liking to him. However, he later tries to steal the Oracle, and is put in prison; Aladdin helps him escape but comes back to face his punishment. Jasmine and the Genie convince the Sultan that he helped his father out of love. At that moment, Iago (who was with Cassim) returns, telling them that Cassim has been captured by Sa'luk and the remaining Thieves.

Jasmine goes with Aladdin to rescue his father, and afterward, they return for their wedding, which Cassim attends from the shadows. They ride on Carpet, waving goodbye to the Merchant from the first film and Iago and Cassim as they ride off. The two then kiss passionately.

===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]''===
Jasmine appears in the ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]'' crossover episode, "[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]", alongside Aladdin, Carpet, Genie, and Abu; In which Hades and Jafar team up with each other to destroy their respective enemies ([[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and Aladdin). This episode is stated to take place after ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves''; when [[Philoctetes|Phil]] comes on to the beautiful princess, she abruptly brushes him off, telling him: "I'm married."

===''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''===
[[File:Enchantedtales 723.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine in ''Disney Princess Tales: Follow Your Dreams''.]]
Jasmine appears alongside Iago, Abu, and Carpet in the ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', the "More than a Peacock Princess" segment. In the segment, Jasmine is tired of her life as a princess and wishes for more responsibility. After speaking with her father, Jasmine is given a job as an assistant teacher (which they call "Royal Assistant Educator") at the Royal Academy alongside her cousin [[Sharma]]. After Sharma runs out of the school in distress, Jasmine decides to teach the class on her own.

Though Jasmine is thrilled at first, she becomes frustrated with her disruptive pupils. They do chaotic things such as throw books, chase Jasmine around with a snake, and draw on walls. She tries to use Rajah to scare the kids, but it backfires; the kids just chase the two of them up a tree. Jasmine decides to give up, but later that night, she is advised by her lady-in-waiting, [[Aneesa]], to persevere and be patient; as then she will be able to do anything she wants and sets her mind to. The next day, the Sultan's prized but aggressive horse named [[Sahara]] is missing from the stables. Jasmine decides to go on a search for the horse in order to prevent her friend, [[Hakeem]], from getting fired. Using her intelligence she and [[Iago]] are able to find out [[Abu]] was the one that let Sahara go. She recruits Aneesa to stall the Sultan from going to see his horse.

After tracking down Sahara at an oasis in the desert, she attempts to tame the horse from the first time and sings the song "I've Got My Eyes on You" in order to soothe him. After many hours, she finally tames him, making her the only person to ever do so besides her mother. Jasmine is able to return the horse to the palace. She later goes back to the school, and the students are far more respectful because they are impressed that Jasmine tamed Sahara. She then successfully teaches the class.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:LN(19).png|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine with Ariel in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Jasmine makes numerous cameo appearances in the series, ''[[House of Mouse]]'', often seen in crowd shots and sitting with one or more of her co-stars.

In "[[Ladies' Night]]", Jasmine comments to [[Ariel]] on [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]]'s dance of seven veils by saying "She looks like a cow." This is her only speaking appearance.

She was also seen at the beginning of "[[Goofy's Valentine Date]]" kissing Aladdin.

In "[[Pete's House of Villains]]", Jafar was put in charge of greeting guests after [[Pete]] took control of the club and used his position to ban each character from ''Aladdin'', aside from Jasmine, for lustful reasons.

In ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'', she and Aladdin were singing alongside the other guests while being trapped inside the club.

===''[[Sofia the First]]''===
{{Quote|Where'd she come from?<br>I don't know. Gosh, but she's here!|Amber and Sofia having no idea how Jasmine came.}}
[[File:Sofia-the-first-two-to-tangu-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine as she appears in ''Sofia the First''.]]
Jasmine is the second Disney Princess to meet Sofia, the first being [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]. She makes a guest appearance in the episode "[[Two to Tangu]]". She appears in her new design. Jasmine helps [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and [[Princess Amber|Amber]] tame a wild flying carpet by teaching them not to be afraid and sings a song called "[[The Ride Of Your Lives|The Ride of Our Lives]]" with them.

Interestingly, while Jasmine sports her redesigned look, her original ponytail hairstyle that was sectioned into two (instead of the new regular-looking ponytail) is retained.

In "[[Forever Royal]]" when Sofia is battling [[Vor]] inside her amulet, Jasmine appears to Sofia in spirit form along with all the other princesses who have been summoned to help Sofia in her times of need in prior episodes, and they encourage her to be brave and strong for they all believe in her.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
{{Quote|We're friends of [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]].|Jasmine meeting [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]].}}
[[File:Ralph Breaks the Internet 133.png|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine with Vanellope, Snow White, Ariel, Elsa and Cinderella in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''.]]
In ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'', a netizen version of Jasmine appears as a resident of [[Oh My Disney]], where she works as a cast member alongside other members of the Disney Princess line-up. Jasmine is first seen on the site's floor, greeting net users as [[Vanellope von Schweetz]] looks on. Shortly afterward, Vanellope, on the run from [[First Order Stormtroopers]], infiltrates the princesses' backstage room via glitching, where Jasmine is seen sitting atop the Magic Carpet while admiring Aladdin's flower to her. Upon noticing Vanellope, Jasmine, along with the princesses, leaps into action and prepares to attack under the presumption that she is a threat; Jasmine arming herself with Genie's lamp and holding it like a gun. Vanellope gets them to stand down and explains that she's also a princess, prompting [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]] to inquire what kind of princess Vanellope is. When [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] asks if animals talk to Vanellope, Jasmine can be seen snuggling Rajah. Jasmine later asks if Vanellope has "daddy issues", referencing her complicated relationship with her father, the Sultan. When Vanellope retorts that she doesn't even have a mom, Jasmine relates, along with [[Belle]], [[Ariel]], Cinderella, [[Snow White]], Pocahontas, [[Elsa]], and [[Anna]].

[[File:RBTI - Casual Princesses (5).png|thumb|250px|Jasmine in her comfy clothes.]]
Eventually, it is agreed that Vanellope truly is a Princess (when she relates everyone believes her problems were solved when "a big, strong man" entered the picture). Shortly after, the princesses come to admire Vanellope's casual modern clothes, prompting Cinderella to have her [[mice]] sew similar attire for the rest of the princesses. Jasmine wears a turquoise headband with gold borderlines, a black tank top under a turquoise tank top with a graphic of Genie's hand holding up three fingers and the word "Wishes" in the same font and color as Genie's applause sign (a reference to genies' rule of granting three wishes), blue yoga pants, white socks, and turquoise sneakers. While lounging, Jasmine can be seen snuggling with Rajah. Ariel tries to express her fondness for her casual wear through song, but Vanellope cuts her off in confusion. A perplexed Jasmine explains that Ariel was singing which, according to [[Tiana]], is what occurs whenever a princess expresses her dreams and desires.

During the climax, the princesses evacuate Oh My Disney during the virus crisis, and are present when [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]] is plummeting to his doom. After [[Moana (character)|Moana]] and Ariel use the [[ocean]] to create a towering spiral of water, Jasmine flies Elsa to the top with Carpet, from where Elsa is able to freeze the water and create a slide to catch Ralph. Ariel later joins them atop Carpet and signals Pocahontas to summon the "colors of the wind", which is used to further guide Ralph, in Snow White's dress and attached to a parachute made from four of the other princesses' dresses to safety. After Ralph is secured, Jasmine introduces them as friends of Vanellope, and Elsa states that any friend of Vanellope is a friend of theirs, befriending Ralph as a result.

===Other appearances===
As part of the promotional campaign for the film ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', Jasmine and Aladdin appeared in a parody trailer, during the famous "A Whole New World" scene, where they're encountered by [[Stitch]] (riding his space cruiser), in the middle of the song. The little alien flirts with Jasmine, resulting in the two riding off on the cruiser, leaving a baffled Aladdin to scorn "Hey! Get your own movie..."

In ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', silhouettes of Jasmine and Aladdin are seen flying into the theater on Carpet to watch the film with a cast of other Disney characters during the ending.

An emoticon version of Jasmine appeared in the ''Aladdin'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Jasmine appears in the fairy tale drama series' sixth season along with Aladdin and Jafar. She is played by Karen David and made her first appearance in the [[Strange Case|fourth episode]] of the sixth season.

After her kingdom is taken over by her father's new adviser, Jafar, a sorcerer who delivers brutal justice and has taken control of her father by putting him in a childlike state, Jasmine learns of Aladdin, also known as the 'diamond in the rough' - capable of defeating Jafar.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x05 - Street Rats - Jasmine in Sandglass.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine in trapped within an hourglass by Jafar.]]
After catching him stealing goods, she hires him into helping her defeat Jafar by threatening to have him arrested if he chooses otherwise. She leads him to a desert where the Cave of Wonders is located, so they can find a jewel which she claims is capable of helping them triumph against Jafar. They converse while venturing through the landscape, and she berates Aladdin for his obsession with gold. He in return scolds her for only helping the city when she has put into danger herself, though she argues that she is at least trying now. The two reach the cave, only to find it is locked, but Aladdin is able to open them, having remembered a story from ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves''. The two walked in and Jasmine finds a diamond balanced on top of a sword. She attempts to pick it up, but Aladdin warns her that it may be booby-trapped and tries to remove it himself carefully. He is unable to do so however and triggers a trap, causing the pair to panic as the cave begins to shake. Jasmine is shielded by Aladdin who blasts a column which is about to fall on them, with his newly found [[magic]]. She reveals that to him that the jewel wasn't the diamond in the rough, but it is Aladdin himself, and he will be able to defeat Jafar. She gifts him with a [[Golden Scarab Beetle|golden scarab]], to remind him of the belief she has in him before departing. Returning to the palace, she finds her hypnotized father playing with a toy castle. She is met by Jafar who traps her within a giant hourglass, and she is almost killed until Aladdin arrives, freeing her and the Sultan from Jafar's control and driving him off. The two later talk while in the market and Aladdin offers her to journey with him, so they can fight Jafar together and see the world, though she decides against it, choosing to help her kingdom first, and the two-part ways.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x15 - A Wondrous Place - Ariel and Jasmine.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine and [[Ariel]] meet.]]
As the capital is still under threat by Jafar despite the Sultan regaining power, Jasmine walks in on her father attempting to sway several princes with the Crown Jewel of Agrabah, a dowry gift he promises to whoever marries his daughter. When she bluntly declares that there will be no engagement, the Sultan sympathizes with her wish to marry for love, however, he tries to persuade her to do her duty because they need a prince with an army to protect their land from Jafar. Jasmine insists what they need is a hero such as Aladdin, to which Jafar strolls in, implying that Aladdin has already been broken from too many battles and no prince can ever match up to him. Jasmine and her father are shaken by Jafar's display of power when he morphs one of the princes into a staff, and are left with fewer choices after he demands Jasmine's hand in marriage by sundown, or he'll destroy Agrabah forever. Later, at the local market, Jasmine sees a hooded thief whom she believes is Aladdin and follows along as "he" is pursued by a vendor for stealing. Instead, she discovers the thief is a girl, [[Ariel]], whose true form reverts to that of a mermaid after the vendor takes the girl's necklace. Upset at hearing the man call Ariel a monster, Jasmine flicks a coin at him to make up for the stolen item before coldly telling him to get out her sight.

She learns that Ariel is visiting Agrabah to look for the man she loves, [[Prince Eric]], and decides to help her find him, so she herself can possibly gain help from Eric's army to defeat Jafar. As the women ride on the magic carpet in search of Eric, Ariel spots her prince's caravan flag through a spyglass. Ariel is worried Eric will reject her since they only met once at a ball, but Jasmine believes the connection she and Eric have is true love and tells her not to pass up on the opportunity, or she may regret it. Despite Ariel's happy reunion with Eric, the man reveals himself to be Jafar in disguise and presses Jasmine again to accept his offer before sundown. As time runs out, Ariel shows Jasmine a powder she stole from Jafar, which is the same kind the sorcerer earlier to turn a prince into a staff, and encourages her to be brave and use it on Jafar. However, Jafar teleports Ariel back to the sea, leaving Jasmine to face him alone. Jasmine grudgingly agrees to marry him to save Agrabah and gives him the ring, but Jafar admits he never intended to marry her and rule Agrabah (for he is despised), and instead, he wanted the ring to break the protection it holds over Agrabah. She watches, powerless, as Jafar takes Agrabah away, not knowing he has trapped it inside the ring.

Left with no other way to restore Agrabah, Jasmine somehow learns Aladdin is also missing, and she uses unknown means to travel to the [[Land of Untold Stories]] to find him. However, [[Mr. Hyde]] forces Jasmine and the other residents to [[Storybrooke]] so their stories can play out.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x04 - Strange Case - Shirin.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine in Storybrooke.]]
Deciding to find a job, Jasmine ends up takes a place in Storybrooke Elementary School, becoming the new teaching aide for [[Snow White]]. She runs into her while searching for the classroom, and she introduces herself as Shirin, careful to keep her identity a secret. After Snow introduced herself. Jasmine immediately recognizes her by her reputation. When Snow finds that her class' exam grades are lower than expected, Jasmine advises changing her teaching methods, as she is no longer the same person who taught them, having been cursed. She explains her point through telling Snow a story of her history, about a princess who never embraced the hero she could become - though is still careful to make sure that she keeps her doesn't expose herself. That evening, as the day is over, Snow gives Jasmine an apple and asks whether the Princess in her land had fixed things, to which Jasmine replies she didn't. After leaving, she meets with the Oracle who is aware of her identity, and the two vow to find Aladdin together.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x05 - Street Rats - Jasmine Interrogated.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine under interrogation.]]
In the forest Jasmine encounters the Oracle who has been poisoned by the [[Evil Regina|Evil Queen]]. She is spotted by [[Emma Swan|Emma]] and flees, though she is quickly caught and arrested. While under interrogation, she pleads innocence but refuses to tell her identity in fear of Hyde learning and using it against her, but Emma assures her by revealing that he is dead, prompting Jasmine to divulge who she is and her quest to find Aladdin. She is taken to the Blanchard Loft, where Emma's friends and family try without success to locate Aladdin. While there, she learns, from a disguised [[The Evil Queen|Evil Queen]], Emma's fate as the Savior, and all Saviors to an extension: death. This leads her to believe that Aladdin is dead. Despairing at the fact that she brought Aladdin to this fate, she is comforted by Henry, who reveals he also did the same with his mother by bringing her to break the curse. Regina creates a potion capable of locating him, and they are brought to a crypt. They find a skeleton which Jasmine identifies as Aladdin after seeing it with the golden scarab she gifted him, and leaves in despair. Later while outside, she is met by Aladdin who reveals himself to be alive, and the two embrace in a hug. She tells him of Agrabah's state and how they need a Savior, leading him to confesses he no longer is one.

While in Granny's Diner, Jasmine tries to get Aladdin to help save Agrabah, though he was unwilling to listen, now that he is no longer the Savior. However, after talking with Emma, he reconsiders and offers his help to Jasmine, who reveals that they are unable to return as Agrabah disappeared.

The two are later approached by [[Belle]] and [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]], who try to recruit Aladdin into stealing a wand from [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]]'s pawnshop. Insistent on finding Agrabah, she tells him not to involve himself, though Zelena is quick to point out to Jasmine that Aladdin brought the Shears of Destiny to Storybrooke, leading to the Dark One obtaining them and refers to Aladdin as her boyfriend, much to the pair's embarrassment. Later that night, Aladdin informs Jasmine that he was able to obtain the Genie's lamp while breaking into the pawnshop, though he notifies her the Genie himself isn't inside, having been freed, but is still hopeful that whatever is inside will be enough to help them.

During a discussion on the class' improved grades, Snow notices Jasmine's distressed behavior. She confesses to Snow that she has found a Genie Lamp, but is uncertain on what the price will cost to find Agrabah. Snow, in turn, encourages her to be the hero she was meant to be. Later in the Blanchard Loft, Jasmine rubs the Lamp, only to find a pair of cuffs release themselves rather than the Genie (who was freed). Aladdin decides to become the new Genie of the Lamp, and despite Jasmine's protests, she watches as he places the cuffs on his wrists, and turns himself into the new Genie.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x10 - Wish You Were Here - Kidnapped Jasmine.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine held hostage by the [[Evil Regina|Evil Queen]].]]
At night while in Granny's Diner, the Evil Queen holds Jasmine hostage and takes control of the lamp in her possession. Her plea for help attracts Emma, [[The Prince|David]], and [[Captain Hook|Hook]]. Tied up and bound in a chair, Jasmine looks on helplessly as the Queen threatens Emma, and when she attempts to attack, the Queen magically chokes Jasmine, causing Emma to yield lest Jasmine be killed. After the Queen uses Aladdin to grant Emma's wish of having never been the Savior, Jasmine stops the arguing between David and Hook. Regina decides to face her evil half with a plan to get Emma back, but David, wanting to stop the Queen from doing any more damage, grows impatient waiting and asks Jasmine and Hook to meet him at the sheriff's station in an hour to work out a way to retrieve the lamp. When David doesn't show up, they rush to the mayor's office with Henry. Jasmine goes to Aladdin and reclaims the lamp, while Hook forces the Queen to stop strangulating David. Following the Queen's departure, Jasmine and Aladdin regroup with the heroes at the loft. Jasmine advises that David can use a wish to break his and Snow's sleeping curse, but David declines out of fear of the wish backfiring as his first one did and offers the lamp to her instead, believing she will be much wiser with it. Jasmine sympathizes with his worries and understands the risks if she uses a wish, however, she is determined to find Agrabah no matter what the cost is. As the lamp's new owner, she uses her first wish to take her and Aladdin to Agrabah.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x15 - A Wondrous Place - Aladdin and Jasmine Kiss.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jasmine and Aladdin kiss.]]
With Jasmine's first wish granted, she and Aladdin are taken to the Enchanted Forest, with the Crown Jewel of Agrabah containing Agrabah appearing in Jasmine's pocket, although neither notices this. After days of searching for Agrabah, Aladdin suspects the wish didn't work and suggests giving up, so she can make a new home in Storybrooke. Jasmine is drawn in when Aladdin implies they can be together too, but she soon rebuffs him and walks off. Aladdin frustratedly asks her how often she is ''almost'' going to kiss him and then questions what she is so afraid of, which Jasmine denies and instead accuses him of having an inflated ego. When Aladdin tries to convince her otherwise, Jasmine pulls away, causing the ring to drop from her pocket. Recognizing it as the crown jewel of Agrabah, Jasmine theorizes that the wish gave her the ring to remind her of how she failed her people. She spots a rowboat and decides to get rid of the lamp. With Aladdin rowing out to sea, Jasmine urges him to go a little further before she wishes him free and dumps the lamp so it can't hurt anyone ever again. However, a Kraken attacks, forcing them to fend it off with the oars. Hook, surfacing from the Nautilus, allows them to come aboard, though he is upset that they chased off the Kraken whose blood he needed for a portal home. When Hook asks who took Agrabah from them, Jasmine admits it was Jafar and that she is too scared to face him again after he took everything from her. With Captain Nemo's harpoon, which can find those with vengeful hearts, Hook proposes using it to track down Jafar to locate Agrabah and have the sorcerer take him back to Storybrooke.

Later, Jasmine relates to Hook's struggle over having the person he loves not knowing how he truly feels by confessing that she feels she doesn't deserve Aladdin's love given her failure to protect Agrabah. When the Nautilus begins flooding with water, Jasmine uses a wish to take all of them to a nearby Hangman's Island, where she, Aladdin, and Hook part ways from Nemo's crew before finding Ariel, who possesses the lamp housing Jafar. Confident that she can defeat Jafar with three heroes by her side, Jasmine summons Jafar, but this allows the sorcerer to break his genie curse. After Jafar knocks out Aladdin, Ariel, and Hook, Jasmine learns from him about Agrabah's whereabouts and fights back by hurling powder on him, which turns the sorcerer into a staff. Rather than use her last wish to either restore Agrabah or free Aladdin, she kisses Aladdin to evoke the power of true love, causing Agrabah's revival and the undoing of Aladdin's genie curse.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 6x21 - The Final Battle Part 1 - Aladdin and Jasmine.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Later, when Emma, the Savior, loses her belief in magic, Agrabah is destroyed. Jasmine, Aladdin, and some other people of Agrabah are able to escape in time through one of the [[Mad Hatter]]'s hats and are reunited with [[The Evil Queen|Regina]], Snow White, David, Hook, and [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]]. As the Enchanted Forest begins collapsing because of Emma's fading belief and the machinations of the malevolent [[Black Fairy]], Regina teleports everyone out of the hat and to her palace, where she works on finding a way back to [[Storybrooke]]. After David and Hook leave to seek out a magic bean, Snow suddenly senses that her husband is in danger and Jasmine offers her magic carpet to track him down. The two princesses find the fallen Beanstalk and move the debris to see who is trapped underneath, however, much to Snow's disappointment, it is Hook and not David. Hook, still groggy from having fallen off the beanstalk, humorously greets Snow by calling her "mummy". Jasmine reacts with confusion to this, to which a sheepish Snow alludes to Hook now being her son-in-law since he married Emma. Hook shows them the bean and offers to help search for David, but Snow directs him to get the bean back to Regina so that they can help Emma. As such, Jasmine and Hook fly back to the palace on the magic carpet, unfortunately, by this time, the bean's magic is gone. Snow and David return, revealing that the depletion of the Enchanted Forest will soon reach the palace as well, so everyone, including Jasmine, rushes to the center of the palace while Regina's reformed evil half holds the storm off with her magic to buy them enough time for Regina to rejuvenate the bean. Everyone prepares to be wiped out of existence as Regina's magic fails, but suddenly, everything goes still, in part to Emma regaining a small bit of her belief, which leaves the survivors on a small chunk of the palace surrounded by nothingness.

When the Black Fairy is killed by her son Mr. Gold, the Dark Curse ends, causing those trapped on the remnants of Regina's palace to be transported back to their homes. Jasmine and Aladdin are returned to Agrabah. Sometime after the forces of good win the final battle, the couple stand together on a balcony as they smile and look out towards their kingdom.

Years later, when Regina casts a lighter version of the Dark Curse and combines all the magical realms including Agrabah, Jasmine and Aladdin presumably now reside in the United Realms.

===[[Aladdin (2019 film)|''Aladdin'' (2019)]]===
[[File: Aladdin 2019 (68).png|thumb|left|250px|Naomi Scott as Jasmine in the 2019 remake.]]
Jasmine appears in the [[2019]] live-action adaptation, portrayed by [[Naomi Scott]]. This version of Jasmine is featured with a slight change of character: this incarnation is motivated to become a good ruler for Agrabah after her father, which doesn't sit well in her male-driven society. Jasmine also has a female friend in the handmaiden [[Dalia]], in whom Jasmine regularly confides. In this iteration, Jasmine is forbidden to leave the palace by orders of her overprotective father but does so regularly by posing as Dalia. The reason for her confinement is the mysterious murder of her mother, which left the Sultan fearing for their daughter's life. During one of her outings, she meets Aladdin, sparking their eventual romance. Jasmine is also given a solo, titled "[[Speechless]]", which focuses on her refusal to remain silent or be controlled by others.

When Genie tells Aladdin that he cannot let someone instantly fall in love with another, Aladdin tells him to turn him into a prince so that he can get Jasmine's attention, especially during the musical number "Prince Ali". Aladdin then attempts to get her attention during a party but fails to. Aladdin finally gets her attention when he tells her to trust him to ride on Carpet, which takes him and Jasmine across the world around the couple during the musical number "A Whole New World". In that scene, the moment where Jasmine takes off Aladdin's turban to find out that "Prince Ali" is actually Aladdin in the marketplace was omitted. Constantly, Aladdin feels upset about himself that he should stop pretending to be a prince from another country to tell Jasmine the truth. When Prince Ali is later revealed to be Aladdin himself, Jafar sends almost everyone in the palace to the dungeon while he sends Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet to a frozen wasteland, except for Jasmine, Dalia, and the Sultan who remain in the palace.

Meanwhile, in the palace, a priest tells Jasmine to know if she wants Jafar to be her husband by marrying him in which she refuses to and takes the lamp to escape the forced marriage, causing Jafar to be enraged; Aladdin notices this as Jasmine escapes with Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet. Enraged, Jafar transforms Iago into the size of a roc to get the lamp back to his master while the priest retreats, to which Iago shrinks back to his normal self after the Sultan tackles him to stop his plan from destroying the kingdom. Aladdin and Jasmine also witness Jafar's rage bringing a powerful storm to destroy Agrabah in which, during the battle, Jasmine and the remaining survivors in the palace are captured while the Jafar uses his final wish to become a powerful genie. Soon after, Jafar and Iago are both defeated due to the Genie's warning that a genie without an owner gets trapped back inside its lamp. Aladdin apologizes for lying to Jasmine. Meanwhile, after Aladdin used his final wish to the Genie to set him free, he and Jasmine marry together as she finally finds a prince to marry (this was not in the animated version as in the original, they both sing a reprise of "A Whole New World" which was omitted in the remake). Jasmine is later seen dancing with everyone in the palace during a "Friend Like Me" reprise.

===''[[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]''===
Jasmine, joined by Aladdin and several of her fellow Disney Princesses in Cinderella, Tiana, Moana, and Rapunzel, along with Anna and Elsa, rode on the ''Disney Wish'' float captained by Minnie with her crew of Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n' Dale in the 2021 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, with special guest [[Jordan Fisher]] on board to sing "Together We Set Sail" when the float reached Herald Square on 34th Street while backed up by additional Cast Members or Macy's volunteers who danced and perfomed in front of the float during the song. During the procession from the starting line on Central Park West, the song played on the float's loudspeakers as Jasmine and her fellow Disney characters waved to the crowd, adding that little bit of Disney magic to the parade to put smiles on all the parade guests as the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its mutations were still a threat at the time.

Jasmine is set to return to ride on the float again for the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Aladdin will be joining her like last year, along with Mickey, Minnie, Rapunzel, Flynn, Tiana, Moana, and Cinderella, but joining them this year will be Mulan, Raya, Mirabel Madrigal, Cinderella and Tiana's husbands, Prince Charming and Prince Naveen, and Marvel superheroes Spider-Man and Black Panther.

[[File:Jasmine and Rajah Tales From Agrabah.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A young Jasmine with her newly adopted tiger cub, Rajah.]]
The chapter book ''Tales of Agrabah'' chronicles aspects of Jasmine's childhood and her life before meeting Aladdin. The first chapter, ''A Gift from the Stars'', shows how Jasmine came to meet and eventually adopt Rajah. The chapter also delves into Jasmine's relationship with her deceased mother.

The second chapter, ''It's a Small World After All'', shows that Jasmine has held the desire to see the world since childhood. To grant her wish in honor of her birthday, the Sultan creates a replica of the marketplace within the confines of the palace, which is enough to satisfy an appreciative Jasmine.

In the fifth chapter, ''That Magical Feeling'', the law that forces Jasmine to marry by a certain age comes into effect for the first time, as the princess preps to meet her first potential suitor.

The final chapter, ''A Whole New World'', is a direct retelling of how Jasmine and Aladdin first met after the former escaped the confines of the palace for the first time.

===''[[Kilala Princess]]''===
[[File:Kilala Princess - Jasmine.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine in ''Kilala Princess''.]]
While on their way back from their trip, Jasmine and Aladdin's trip is cut short by the sudden arrivals of [[Kilala Reno|Kilala]], [[Sylphy]], and [[Rei]]. Unable to carry five people at the same time, they are forced to walk back to Agrabah. Upon arriving in the city, the guards of Agrabah are informed to arrest Aladdin and the trio for kidnapping the princess. The girls make their escape while the boys hold off the guards. While helping [[Sylphy]], Jasmine accidentally falls off the roof and gets captured by the trio's enemy, [[Valdou]]. After a long struggle for Aladdin's magic lamp, Kilala uses it to wish for knowledge of Jasmine's location. They find the princess unharmed. They take her back to the palace, and Jasmine tells her father, the Sultan, about her new friends. The Sultan gives Kilala a giant diamond as a token of friendship, but she later gives it back. Jasmine then trades it with a flower that she received from Aladdin as her token of friendship. It later turns into an amethyst. Jasmine is last seen witnessing Kilala receive her magic gem: an emerald.

==Video games==
===''[[Aladdin (video game)|Aladdin]]''===
The game follows the plot of the movie. Jasmine appears in cut scenes and must be rescued from Jafar in the final level. At the end of the game, she and Aladdin fly by on the magic carpet. They kiss as the credits scroll.

===''[[Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge]]''===

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Jasmine KHII.png|left|200px]]
Jasmine appears in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' video games and is also one of the [[Princesses of Heart]]. This means she has a pure heart of light, and when her heart is gathered and placed alongside the other seven Princesses of Heart, the gateway to the legendary Kingdom Hearts is opened. The evil sorceress [[Maleficent]] and a team of Disney Villains team up to do just that. Among them is Jafar, and through the power of darkness given to him by Maleficent, he's able to dominate Agrabah and begins a hunt for Jasmine. She manages to elude him by hiding in Agrabah's streets until found by [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], who cover her escape while they confront Jafar, who simply summons several Heartless to deal with them while he goes after Jasmine. By the time Sora returns to Agrabah with Aladdin, Jafar has found her and is confronted by them outside the palace gates. Aladdin attempts to save her by using Genie and his second wish to carry her to safety, but Iago steals the lamp and gives it to Jafar, making him Genie's new master, and causing Jasmine to fall back down into a disguised Pot Spider Heartless. Jafar then sics the Pot Centipede on Aladdin and Sora to cover his escape, where Jasmine can be heard calling for help from one of the various Pot Spiders attacking them or making up the Pot Centipede's body, but once the Pot Centipede is slain, Jasmine is nowhere to be found, having been taken by Jafar as he seeks out Agrabah's Keyhole, located deep within the Cave of Wonders. Jafar faces Aladdin and Sora first with his magic and Genie, then after wishing for his genie powers, in his genie form, but is defeated and imprisoned in his lamp. While Aladdin and Sora have their final showdown with Jafar, Jasmine, waiting for their return as she watched from above, is captured and taken to Hollow Bastion by Maleficent's underling [[Riku]]. Aladdin is prevented from coming with Sora to find her due to needing to protect the world order and not meddle in the affairs of other worlds.

Sora and friends travel to [[Hollow Bastion]], and after the villains are defeated and the keyhole is closed, Jasmine is freed and remains in the dark castle alongside the other princesses to protect the realm with their combined power.

At the end, when Sora finally defeats the [[Ansem, Seeker of Darkness|primary threat]], Jasmine and the other princesses return home and are last seen kissing Aladdin in his house.

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', Jasmine is kidnapped by Jafar, who wishes to marry the princess to seize control of the throne, but is thwarted upon Sora's arrival.

Jasmine returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' where she tells Sora, Donald, and Goofy of her worry. Aladdin has been retreating into the city streets and seems to be tumbling into a depression since Genie and Carpet left Agrabah for some time, though he claims nothing's wrong. Not only that, Iago and Jafar return, though the parrot merely wishes to reform, whilst Jafar seeks revenge. In the end, due to Iago's efforts, Jafar is defeated and peace is restored. Jasmine and the others then happily welcome him into the palace.

Jasmine also plays minor roles in ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded]]'' as well as ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]''.

===''[[Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey]]''===
Jasmine's world is visited by the heroine. At this time, mirages are appearing all over Agrabah so Jasmine and Abu team up with the heroine to set things right.

===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===
Jasmine appears as an unlocked meet-and-greet character near Aladdin's Oasis in [[Adventureland (Disneyland)|Adventureland]]. She is first approached when the player delivers some dates to her as a gift from Aladdin. Before that, she doesn't appear until first fulfilling Aladdin's request to spawn Genie after getting the magic wand from [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and doing favors for both Genie and Aladdin to help out Jasmine as well after receiving the blaster from [[Buzz Lightyear]]. Upon first meeting her, Jasmine asks the player if they can locate and return her lost bracelets (which can be found in the ''[[Jungle Cruise]]'' mini-game, also the location for the first task from [[Baloo]]). After the bracelets are recovered, Jasmine asks if the player can help her practice her dancing for the upcoming royal feast and even provides royal garments for the player to wear.

===''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]''===
Jasmine appears in the game as one of the playable characters, this is unlocked with 10 tokens and her friend Rajah always accompanies her in battle, the most notable is that her victory pose is not present in the film nor does Rajah have a pose of victory.

===''[[Disney Infinity (series)|Disney Infinity]]''===
[[File:Jasmine Disney Infinity.png|right|120px]]
Jasmine is a playable character in the series, making her debut appearance in the Toy Box mode of ''[[Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition]]''. Her figure was released on [[February 3]], [[2015]], both individually, and as part of the "Aladdin Toy Pack", which was a bundle set that contained both the Jasmine figure and the previously released Aladdin figure.

Jasmine's melee attack consists of punches and kicks that do a fairly minimal amount of damage, while her long-range attack, "Shooting the Breeze", is more powerful, shooting out a magic carpet that creates sandstorms in its path. Using "Royal Decree", Jasmine can break an enemy's block. The "Street Mouse" skill adds an additional attack to Jasmine's ground combo attack.

Jasmine's special ability is "Windstorm", which is activated after collecting a certain amount of purple power-orbs. Once she does so, Jasmine can summon a sandstorm with the help of Carpet, which lifts enemies and causes damage to them in the process.

===''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]''===
Jasmine travels to the Kingdom to help Aladdin plan a party for Genie's return to Agrabah. While making preparations, she senses a mysterious presence lurking about, which eventually reveals itself to be [[Jafar]], now freed from the lamp. After Genie tracks down the villain's whereabouts, Jasmine volunteers to infiltrate the area alone to uncover Jafar's plot. She learns that he plans to unleash a curse throughout the kingdom. Fortunately, she, [[Aladdin]], [[Abu]], [[Genie]], and [[Carpet]] are able to defeat him before it's too late. Following Jafar's defeat, Jasmine is taken on a romantic date through the Kingdom by Aladdin.

==[[Aladdin (Musical)|Musical]]==
[[File:Princess Jasmine on Aladdin the Broadway Musical 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Courtney Reed as Jasmine in the ''Aladdin'' musical adaptation.]]
Jasmine appears in the musical adaptation of the film, playing a role identical to that of the original film. Stage actress Courtney Reed originated the role of Jasmine in the pre-Broadway show in Toronto and carried over the role once the show was taken to the Broadway stage.

Though her role is similar to that of the film, there are a few significant differences to Jasmine's character. For instance, along with "A Whole New World", Jasmine performs several additional musical numbers, including "[[These Palace Walls]]", "[[A Million Miles Away]]" (another duet with Aladdin), and "[[Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim]]".

Additionally, during the climax, Jafar's first wish was notably different and related to Jasmine. As opposed to wishing he was the ruler of Agrabah, Jafar's first wish was to make Jasmine his prisoner. However, in the movie, his ''final'' wish was initially to make Jasmine fall in love with him instead, using his newfound sorcery to transform Jasmine's blue bedlah outfit into a red slave-girl outfit first.

Aside from these factors, generally, Jasmine's role in the stage musical remains pretty much the same.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Jasmine new look.jpg|thumb|250px|Jasmine posing for a photo at one of the Disney Parks, showcasing her new look.]]

Jasmine appeared in the former, Broadway-style musical [[Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular]], at [[Disney's California Adventure]] park with her own song, "[[To Be Free]]". In [[World of Color]] at the same park, Jasmine makes a notable appearance during ''Aladdin''<nowiki/>'s sequence. She and Aladdin sing "A Whole New World", as well as its reprise.

For meet-and-greets, Jasmine can be found in [[Adventureland (Disneyland)|Adventureland]] and at Royal Hall at the [[Disneyland]] park.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
In the [[Magic Kingdom]], Jasmine has her own spell card known as "Jasmine's Magic Carpet Tassels of Fury" in the [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]. In the same park, she makes a brief appearance in the final sequence of [[Celebrate the Magic]].

In [[Mickey's PhilharMagic]], Jasmine appears alongside Aladdin and Iago. In the show, [[Donald Duck]] enters the world of ''Aladdin'' in search of [[Mickey Mouse]]'s [[Sorcerer Hat|sorcerer hat]]. When Donald enters the world of Aladdin, Jasmine and Aladdin are in the middle of singing "A Whole New World". After the song, Jasmine kindly gives Donald the hat back.

For meet-and-greets, Jasmine makes appearances near [[The Magic Carpets of Aladdin]] attraction in the Magic Kingdom's [[Adventureland (Magic Kingdom)|Adventureland]]. A portrait of Jasmine can also be seen in the [[Princess Pavilion|Princess Fairytale Hall]]. Jasmine also makes appearances at the [[Morocco Pavilion]] in [[Epcot]]'s [[World Showcase]]. Due to her redesigned appearance, she is one of the few Disney Princesses that does not have a winter version of her attire to wear during the colder months.

Jasmine is seen in the water projectors with Aladdin in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] version of [[Fantasmic!]] during the princess-themed medley. Jasmine also appears riding either Steamboat Willie or the [[Mark Twain Riverboat]] in the finale.

===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===
In the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] version of Fantasmic!, Jasmine appears during the finale alongside Prince Ali. For meet-and-greets, Jasmine can usually be found at the [[Arabian Coast]] in the same park.

Jasmine also makes a cameo appearance during the finale of [[Once Upon a Time (Tokyo Disneyland)|Once Upon a Time]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. She and Aladdin also appear on the ''Aladdin''-themed floats in the [[Happiness is Here Parade|Happiness is Here]] parade and [[Main Street Electrical Parade|Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights]].

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===
In [[Adventureland (Disneyland Paris)|Adventureland]], Jasmine appears in both the "Prince Ali"-inspired window and the final window featured in the walkthrough attraction [[Le Passage Enchanté d'Aladdin]]. In [[Fantasyland (Disneyland Paris)|Fantasyland]], she holds a mask while entering The Starlit Princess Waltz at the 25th Anniversary. Princesses hold fans and switch them and dance with Aladdin and princes.

===[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]===

==[[Disney Princess]]==
===Redesign===
[[File:Jazmín.21.png|right|180px]]
Jasmine's late [[2012]] redesign had multiple changes. Her hair is much more curled with a very noticeable stray strand sticking out and is now in a ponytail instead of being sectioned into two like before.

Her earrings are now golden bangles instead of the previous solid, triangular earrings that covered her ears. Other jewelry includes two sapphire brooches - one on her chest and the other over her navel.

Jasmine's bedlah outfit is now teal instead of light blue and has received noticeable pale aquamarine organza shoulders for the bandeau-style off-shoulder top she wears, while the billowed pants now have a matching overskirt, with designs of fleur-de-lys covering much of them, making the entire outfit resemble a dress.

In the early redesigns, her top is one-shouldered instead of her redesigned top with organza shoulders.

Her 2021 'Ultimate Princess Celebration' redesign reverted back largely to her pre-2012 appearance.

===[[Palace Pets]]===
Jasmine's Palace Pets are Sultan, Lapis, Taj, Nyle, Stripes, Nola, and Sandstorm.

==Differences from the source material==
Jasmine is loosely based on Princess Badroulbadour (Arabic بدر البدور, Badr al-budūr, "full moon of full moons") featured in the story of "Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp" from ''1001 Arabian Nights''.
*In the original fairy tale of Aladdin, the princess' name was Badroulbadour.
*In the original fairy tale, Badroulbadour was a classical type of princess.
*The original character was from an autonomous Muslim society in western China since the setting of the Aladdin story is set there.
*The vizier was not interested in marrying the princess; rather, she was engaged to his son.
*Badroulbadour gets married to Aladdin in the middle of the story, not at the end. The African magician wishes to take everything Aladdin had wished for, and this also works on his marriage to the princess.
*Both Aladdin and Badroulbadour live happily ever after and Aladdin succeeds the sultan after his death and reigns for many years leaving behind him a long line of kings.

==Trivia==
*"Jasmine" is a Persian name for a beautiful [[Wikipedia:Jasmine|flower]] that Persians call "yas" or "yasamin".
*Contrary to popular belief, Jasmine's age has never been confirmed or even referenced in any of the ''Aladdin'' movies, television series, or other spinoff projects. In the original film, the Sultan declares that Jasmine must be married "by her '''''next''''' birthday", but never specifies how old she will become on said birthday.
**An early story concept for the original film had the Sultan saying, "Jasmine, the law says you must be married by your sixteenth birthday.", which would have made her fifteen years old. This concept was scrapped when Jeffrey Katzenberg became worried about sending the wrong message regarding the idea that fifteen year old girls can get married. Thus, the line was changed to "married to a prince by your next birthday.", leaving Jasmine's age unknown.<ref>Culhane, John (August 15, 1993). ''Disney's Aladdin The Making Of An Animated Film.'' Disney Editions. ISBN 978-1-56282-757-1.</ref>
**Actress [[Linda Larkin]] was 20 years old when she landed the role of Jasmine in [[1990]].
*In ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales'', Jasmine notes that she can name every one of the 40 thieves.
*The concept of Jasmine escaping the palace was partially inspired by Princess Ann's identical actions in the [[1953]] film ''{{WikipediaLink|Roman Holiday}}''.<ref name="com" />
*Jasmine's wedding dress in ''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' was modeled after her mother's wedding dress.<ref>Disney. ''Jasmine's Royal Wedding''. Storybook, 2015. Print.</ref>
*One of the Disney Princess magazines has a story about two of Jasmine's cousins named Farah and Nadine. Whether they are considered canon is unknown.<ref>http://d-princesses.livejournal.com/938819.html</ref>
*Jasmine is the first Disney Princess to be the deuteragonist, rather than the protagonist/titular character.
*Producer Amy Pell was particularly fond of Jasmine's role as an independent woman when compared to pre-Renaissance Princesses.<ref name="com" />
*Jasmine has been a ground-breaking character for being the first non-white Disney Princess.
*Jasmine is the only named female character in the 1992 film ''Aladdin'', this is because she is the only significant female character in the 1992 film.
*Jasmine has a recurring theme in the movie, which can be found as "Jasmine Runs Away" on the [[Aladdin (soundtrack)|''Aladdin'' soundtrack]]. The melody for Jasmine's theme would later be used as the template for a full song titled "[[To Be Free]]", which appears as a solo for Jasmine in ''[[Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular]]''.
**Jasmine's theme was inspired by "Scheherazade Suite" by Rimsky-Korosakov.<ref name="fact">''Aladdin'', Platinum Edition DVD: Pop-Up Fun Facts</ref>
*When casting Jasmine, the filmmakers strived to find an actress whose voice differentiated from that of previous Disney heroines.<ref name="com">''Aladdin'', Platinum Edition DVD: Audio commentary</ref>
**According to the filmmaker's notes on the Special Edition DVD, Linda Larkin was asked repeatedly to lower her voice to play Jasmine.<ref name="fact" />
**Following her initial audition, it took nine months for Larkin to officially receive the role of Princess Jasmine.<ref name="fact" />
*Larkin once boasted having to say the best line in the movie: "It's all so magical!" It is explained that this line is what helped her understand the character of Jasmine.<ref name="fact" />
*Jasmine was the first Disney Princess to be voiced by two actresses, Linda Larkin providing her speaking voice, and [[Lea Salonga]] providing her singing voice.
*In an extended version of the Disney Princess scene in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' shown at the [[2017]] [[D23]] Expo, it was revealed that the internet counterpart of Jasmine was allergic to cats and required an inhaler. While this part of the scene did not appear in the actual film, a 13-doll pack that featured Vanellope and the Princesses in their comfy clothes did give Jasmine's doll an inhaler accessory.
*Although the exact date is not clear, Jasmine's birthday is in late January or early February. This is because when Aladdin and Jasmine fly on the magic carpet, Chinese New Year is being celebrated. This holiday can fall anywhere from January 21 to February 20.
