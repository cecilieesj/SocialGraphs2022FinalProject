Spencer Smythe is the father of [[Alistair Smythe]] and a former teacher at Midtown High. He went with a group from Midtown High on a field trip to Oscorp Tower.

Later, Spencer hired [[Scorpion]] to steal vibranium. Then, he framed [[Harry Osborn]] for sabotaging a machine at a lecture at Midtown High which caused Harry to be suspended from Horizon High for an investigation.

The investigation proved that Spencer was the one who sabotaged the machine and was fired, which lead Harry to return to Horizon High, which he declined later on.

The now unemployed Spencer tried to apply for work at Osborn Academy, but was rejected. He later teams up with [[Jackal (Marvel)|Raymond Warren]] to collect genetically enhanced spiders. But as he was leaving, he bumps into [[Miles Morales]] and ends up losing one of the spiders from Oscorp. Then, he sees a video of a new Spider-Man (Miles after being bitten). Spencer then goes after Spider-Man in a giant robot. However, his son shows up also in a giant robot to do the same. After the battle, the other Spider-Man defeats Spencer and sends him to jail where he finds Raymond Warren sitting in a cell. Spencer asks how got back into prison to which Raymond answered that he had no idea what he was talking about.
