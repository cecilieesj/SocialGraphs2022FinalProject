==Appearances==
===''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''===
In ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', they are first seen in the lineup of traffic entering [[Piston Peak National Park]]. Winnie comments that the scenery is like how she remembers it. Harvey, who was carrying pairs of tires on his roof, asks Winnie how many she brought, only for her to respond that Harvey had spoiled it.

Later, they come to the grand reopening party of [[Cad Spinner]]'s Grand Fusel Lodge. They explain to [[Dusty Crophopper]] and [[Lil' Dipper]] that they are celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary by going to the spot of the park where they had their first kiss. Upon hearing Harvey say that there was a bridge and waterfall, Dusty tells them that the spot is Augerin Canyon near Upper Whitewall Falls. Dipper decides to let Harvey and Winnie join her, Dusty, [[Windlifter]], and [[Maru]] for a drink outside, where they have a talk, which Harvey suggests to Dusty that his firefighting job should be his second career to racing.

After the firefighters put out a fire at the park's exit the next day, they hear from Patch that Harvey and Winnie are trapped on Whitewall Falls' bridge set on fire. Dusty rushes to the scene and does a vertical climb up the waterfall at his maximum speed to scoop water into his pontoons. As the bridge starts to collapse, [[Blade Ranger]] arrives and holds Harvey and Winnie away from the edge as Dusty pours water onto the flames, enabling Harvey and Winnie to drive to safety as well as causing Dusty's gearbox to give out after redlining, making him crash in the forest.

After Dusty returns to [[Propwash Junction]] with a new gearbox from the firefighting team along with being certified as a firefighter, Harvey and Winnie attend an aerial show starring the colleagues from Piston Peak.
