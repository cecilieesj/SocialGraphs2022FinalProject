== Personality ==
Indie is a smart, nice and friendly girl who puts up with any challenges. She seems to try an get her own way in life, and sometimes, that is just not the case. Around her family, she acts childish (at times), and this causes lack of trust from her parents. Indie also tries to act tough, when she tries to prove something to someone.
