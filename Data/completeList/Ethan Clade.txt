'''Ethan Clade''' is a character from the upcoming [[2022]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Strange World]]''. He is Searcher's 16-year-old son who longs for adventure beyond his father's farm while also navigating a school crush.

==Background==
===Official Description===
{{Quote|Ethan Clade is a typical teenager who rolls his eyes when his parents smooch, lights up when his friends visit and gets completely tongue-tied when his crush, Diazo, is around. The 16-year-old longs for the kind of adventure that echoes that of the grandfather he's never met, so when his dad heads off on a crucial mission aboard the airship Venture—Ethan stows away... He certainly embraces his father and can feel the love that Searcher has for him, but something is missing for him in the quiet farm life he's living.|Roy Conli describing Ethan<ref>[https://whatsondisneyplus.com/strange-world-inside-scoop-on-the-characters-environments/ Strange World: Inside Scoop On The Characters & Environments]</ref>}}

==Trivia==
*Ethan will be the first gay protagonist in a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film.<ref name="StrangeWorldGay">[https://wdwnt.com/2022/06/strange-world-to-feature-first-openly-gay-teen-romance-in-disney-film/ ‘Strange World’ To Feature First Openly Gay Teen Romance in Disney Animated Film]</ref>
**His voice actor, [[Jaboukie Young-White]], is openly gay in real life.
**While Disney had LGBTQ+ characters in the past, Ethan is the third Disney protagonist who is openly LGBTQ+, the first two being [[Luz Noceda]] and [[Amity Blight]] from ''[[The Owl House]]''. Past LGBTQ+ Disney characters were either not openly LGBTQ+, or not protagonists.
