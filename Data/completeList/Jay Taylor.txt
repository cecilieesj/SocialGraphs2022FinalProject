==Role in the film==
Jay and Ice are first seen stealing Max's shoes when Max says he does not have cash or bud for them. Jay is later seen stealing candy from trick-or-treaters with Ice when they encounter Max once again. This time, they ask him about his costume which happens to be a "Little Leaguer" as referred by Max's sister, [[Dani Dennison|Dani]]. They then try to force her to pay a toll in order to pass them, but Max steps in by giving them his candy.

Later at 3am, Ice and Jay are trying to think of some other activity to do (due to most of the Halloween activities having ended at this hour) when they encounter the [[Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]], who abduct them and lock them up in cages hanging from the ceiling in [[The Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|their cottage]] in response to Jay referring them as "ugly chicks", which offends them, with the [[Sarah Sanderson|Sarah]] tormenting Jay by spinning his cage, causing him to get sick. Later, when Max and Allison arrive to rescue Dani, whom the sisters have abducted, Ice and Jay beg to be saved, to which Max responds by taking back his shoes from Ice and leaving them in their cages as payback for their bullying.

After the Sanderson sisters disappear off the face of the Earth at dawn, Jay and Ice, still in their cages, are singing songs including "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" to fill in time before any citizen of Salem will find and release them from their imprisonment. Their fates are left unknown by the end of the film; it can be presumed they were eventually rescued by another Salem resident.
