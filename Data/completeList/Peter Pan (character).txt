{{Quote|Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives! I'll fight ya man to man, with one hand behind my back!|Peter Pan to [[Captain Hook]]|Peter Pan (film)}}
'''Peter Pan''' is the titular protagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1953]] [[Peter Pan (film)|animated feature film of the same name]]. Peter travels from the enchanted isle of [[Neverland]] all the way to [[London]] just to hear [[Wendy Darling]] spin tales about him and his adventures. While his ego may seem inflated at times, even his arch-nemesis [[Captain Hook]] knows that Peter's no ordinary boy. He can fly without wings and match Hook's cutlass with nothing more than a dagger. He is also the undisputed leader of the [[Lost Boys]] and allows no breaks in the ranks. Time makes little difference to him; when you never grow up, life is nothing but fun, whimsy, and adventure.

==Background==
Peter Pan is a young boy who lives on the island of [[Neverland]]. He has a fairy called [[Tinker Bell]], who is his best friend and sidekick. He is the current leader of the [[Lost Boys]]. He spends most days going on adventures and battling the notorious pirate [[Captain Hook]].

An earlier story idea involved Peter's birth and how he came to be. When he was an infant, fairies entered his home and took him away to Neverland. When Peter returned, he discovered another baby in his mother's bed. Feeling rejected and forgotten, Peter left and returned to Neverland - now his home. Eventually, Peter met Tinker Bell and gathered a group of younger kids and created the Lost Boys. The idea was dropped early in production as [[Walt Disney]] believed that how Peter came to be was another story.

===Personality===
{{Quote|He flies without wings. His shadow leads a merry little life of its own. Face-to-face with the terrible Captain Hook, Peter dispatches that pirate with jaunty ease. Peter is at home with mermaids and understands their language. He is twelve years old forever simply because he refuses to grow up beyond that comfortable age. Most remarkable of all, he knows where Never Land is and how to get there.|[[Walt Disney]]}}
Peter Pan is incredibly adventurous and daring. His favorite activities include battling pirates, engaging in friendly wars with the Indians, and listening to Wendy's stories of his adventures. Being a young boy, Peter can be rather impractical and conceited at times, but when it comes to rescue his friends, he is far more mature than any adult can be. He is respected and loved by nearly every inhabitant of Never Land, with the exception of Captain Hook (and his crew), who despises Peter for cutting off his left hand and feeding it to Tick-Tock the Crocodile during their first battle. Ever since, Peter and Hook have been at each other's throats constantly, battling in the hope that one would finally "walk the plank." One of the many things Peter discards is adulthood. This drove him to create a team of kids who also desire to stay young who he deems the Lost Boys. One can say Peter stands as a father figure for the group as well. Peter's most trusted companion is Tinker Bell. Even though they have a close best friend relationship, it is obvious Tink has strong feelings for Peter. Whether or not he is actually aware is currently unknown, although, in the first film, when Tink was close to death, Peter stated: "Don't you understand, Tink, you mean more to me than anything in the world!"

Despite being heroic and charming, Pan can be quite cocky, and being an immortal child somewhat, he can also be quite immature, and as such, he enjoys goofing off, listening to stories, playing "pretend", and parties with his friends. Peter's youthful nature symbolizes his place in childhood wonder. Even so, Peter can also be very adult. By the end of the film, despite proclaiming his hatred for adulthood with great intensity, Peter eventually comes to put his more childlike nature aside for the sake of protecting Tinker Bell, Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys. With this, he brings himself to serve as a more adult figure, by risking his life for the sake of his loved ones, and selflessly escorting Wendy and her brothers home to London, despite his desire to have them stay.

This directly ties into his dynamic with Captain Hook who, despite Peter developing into a child with an adult mindset, is very much an adult with a more childish mindset, being loud, overly commanding, dependent on others, and prone to tantrums.

===Physical appearance===
Many of Walt Disney's envisioned characters went through an evolution of designs, and Peter Pan is no exception. Most model sheets depicted Peter as a small little boy but soon later changed into more of a fairytale-like creature. Finally, Peter was given the look of a nearly teenaged boy. He has fair skin, rosy cheeks, short red hair, thick red eyebrows, brown eyes, and pointy elf-like ears. His outfit resembles an elf's attire, consisting of a green short-sleeved tunic with a collar and a long V-cut neckline down to his heart, olive tights, and sienna-colored moccasin shoes. He wears a green Robin Hood-like hat (called a bycocket) with a red feather situated on the left-hand side, and has a brown belt around his waist which usually holds his dagger.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Flight:''' Peter's most unique trait is his ability to fly without any physical methods, he uses this to gain the advantage on those who cannot.
*'''Semi-Immortality:''' Peter cannot die of old age, but it is never stated whether or not he can survive death.
**'''Eternal Youth:''' Peter cannot age due to living in [[Neverland]] which his claims suggest that it prevents people from aging.
*'''Dagger-Fighting:''' Peter is very skilled with his trusty dagger, able to wield it with such skill he can fight a master swordsman, like his nemesis [[Captain Hook]], and hold his own. However, Peter often fights while flying, which gives him an edge; when he fights Hook without flying, he is almost killed.
*'''Voice Mimicry:''' Peter has an uncanny talent for impersonating others' voices, as he does when he imitates Hook and tries to trick Mr. Smee into taking Tiger Lily back to her people. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', he imitates Smee to lure out Hook, and in both cases, Smee and Hook are fooled.

[[File:Peter-pan-disneyscreencaps.com-2191.jpg|thumb|249x249px|Peter Pan in the original film|alt=|left]]
Peter first appears returning to [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]]'s home to retrieve his shadow (bringing [[Tinker Bell]] in tow), but accidentally wakes up Wendy, [[John Darling|John]], and [[Michael Darling|Michael]] in the process while he is chasing it. After Wendy sews it back on, they begin to talk, during which time Wendy reveals she does not want to grow up. Peter then decides to take Wendy and her brothers to Never Land so she will never have to grow up, and for Wendy to be a mother of the [[Lost Boys]]. Once they arrive, they are attacked by Captain Hook, who assaults them with his cannon. While he distracts the [[Pirate Crew (Peter Pan)|pirates]], Peter orders Tinker Bell to take the Darlings to safety, only to find that Tinker Bell had attempted to have the Lost Boys kill his new friend Wendy (by telling them that Pan told her Wendy was a terrible "Wendy bird" and that they were ordered to shoot her down). Peter swoops in just in time to save Wendy, and after chastising the boys, learns that Tinker Bell was the mastermind and they had been tricked. Peter angrily tells Tink she is banished permanently, though Wendy pleads him not to be that harsh. He tells her she can come back within a week, but Tink is already gone, still believing she can never return to Peter's side. After this, Peter takes Wendy to see the [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]] of [[Mermaid Lagoon (Neverland)|Mermaid Lagoon]]. While there, they spy Captain Hook and his right-hand man, [[Mr. Smee]], with the Indian princess [[Tiger Lily]] as a captive, rowing toward [[Skull Rock]], where they plan to interrogate her.

Peter and Wendy investigate and find that Hook is planning to learn the location of Peter's hideout. Peter then fakes Hook's voice toward Smee to convince him to free the Princess, and Peter is able to rescue Tiger Lily. Although Smee proves to be gullible, Hook catches Peter and they begin a bout of swordplay. Ultimately, Peter's ability to fly gives him the upper hand, and he escapes with Tiger Lily and Wendy. For his bravery, Peter is rewarded by Tiger Lily's father the [[Indian Chief]], who crowns Peter "Little Flying Eagle", thus making him another chief of the Indians. Peter then returns home with the Darlings and the Lost Boys. Peter realizes Wendy is ready to return home and, even worse for Peter, the Lost Boys wish to have a real mother and return home with Wendy. Peter tells them once they grow up, they can never return. Peter really does not worry knowing they will return eventually. Unbeknownst to Peter, however, his friends are actually kidnapped by Hook and his crew the moment they exit [[Hangman's Tree]].

Peter is then a victim of Hook's newest scheme: Hook plants a [[Bomb (Peter Pan)|bomb]] in Peter's home while he and Tinker Bell are inside it. While Peter has truly survived and unharmed, Tinker Bell is fatally injured and Hangman's Tree has been destroyed. While she tells Peter that Hook has Wendy and the boys and that he needs to save them, he refuses to leave her and begs her to stay alive, saying that he loves her more than anything. Together, Peter and Tinker Bell fly over to The ''[[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]]'' ship to battle the pirates. After the pirates are done with, Peter takes on Hook alone atop the ship. As Hook is about to strike Peter in the back while he is off guard letting out a triumphant crow, Wendy quickly warns him, having Peter fly out of the way and leaving Hook to plummet into the sea where he is chased away by the [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]]. The Lost Boys, Michael, John, Tinker Bell, and Wendy all celebrate Pan's victory. Peter commands Tink to cover the ship in [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] so that he may drop Wendy and her brothers off home to London.

===''[[Return to Never Land]]''===
[[File:Peterpan2-disneyscreencaps.com-4404.jpg|thumb|250px|Peter in ''Return to Never Land''.]]
Peter and Tinker Bell are out and about in Never Land and pay Hook a little visit, only to discover Hook has a girl being held captive, who the Captain claims to be Wendy. Pan becomes serious and battles the Captain to rescue his friend. After Hook is defeated, he frees the girl, but instead of reuniting with Wendy, he meets her daughter [[Jane (Peter Pan)|Jane]], who unlike Wendy is rather practical.

He takes the newcomer to his hideout and introduces her to the Lost Boys. The boys begin to surround her, asking to play all sorts of games and activities, which causes Jane to lose her temper and storm off. Peter and Tinker Bell follow her and witness her collecting supplies and boarding them on a raft. After the failed attempt to ride off home, Peter informs her that the only way to go home is to fly. He takes her on a lesson, and oblivious to Peter, Captain Hook is spying on them and plans to use Jane's desires to get home against his enemies. Jane's first take-off fails. Peter finds her beloved notepad and begins playing rugby with it. It is accidentally eaten by Cubby, causing Jane to yet again go into a complete rage to the point where she declares that she does not believe in fairies, and storm away for good. Jane's non-belief causes Tinker Bell to become ill.

The only way to save Tink is to have Jane believe again in magic. The friends set off to find her, but she finds them instead. She suggests playing treasure hunt (as part of Hook's plan to retrieve his treasure in exchange for giving her a ride home), to which Peter agrees. She finds the treasure, but she changes her mind about Hook, but Tootles finds their communication whistle and unknowingly alerts Hook. Peter angrily calls Jane a traitor and warns her that Tink's light is going out. Jane rushes there while Peter and the boys are captured and taken to Hook's ship.

Peter, being strapped to an anchor, is about to walk the plank until Jane arrives with Tinker Bell fully charged. She frees Peter and the Lost Boys until Hook traps her by the neck with his hook. Peter returns the favor and cuts Hook loose falling through the ship and sinking with it until he and his crew are chased by the [[Octopus (Peter Pan)|octopus]]. Peter personally escorts Jane back to London with the Lost Boys. Peter and Tink reunite with the now grown-up Wendy. Originally upset at the fact that Wendy has changed by growing up, Peter happily accepts it after Wendy assures him that even though she has grown up, she has not really changed and still believes in him. After the reunion, Peter and Tink watch Wendy and her children happily greet Jane's [[Edward|father]] as he returns from war, and they then fly back to Never Land.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:PeterPanHouseofMouse.png|thumb|left|250px|Peter in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Peter makes numerous appearances in the television series ''House of Mouse''.

Peter's most notable appearance is in the episode "[[Donald Wants to Fly]]". Peter and the Lost Boys are a band that was scheduled to perform at the club that night and are late for the show. [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] sends [[Iago]] to find them. While Mickey is gone, [[Donald Duck|Donald]] spends the night trying to fly. After Peter finally arrives, he teaches Donald how to fly, with the help of pixie dust. At the end of the show, he asks Mickey and [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] to visit him in Never Land and that he had managed to make a cabana for them at Mermaid Lagoon.

In the episode "[[Super Goof (House of Mouse)|Super Goof]]", he is seen with Tink at a table watching [[Super Goof]] fly, during which he commented out of jealousy "So, he can fly, he can fly, he can fly! Who can't?"

Peter also appears in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.

===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
[[File:PeterPanJake.png|thumb|250px|Peter as he appears in ''Jake and the Never Land Pirates''.]]
While Peter does not make any appearances in the first season of the series, he is mentioned several times by [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]], his crew and even Captain Hook. Following the events of the film, Peter and Tinker Bell have gone off to explore the world outside of Never Land and left Jake and his crew to keep Captain Hook at bay. Some of the episodes revolve around a message sent to Jake by Peter to complete a task. In the episode "[[The Key to Skull Rock]]", a silhouette in the form of stars are seen in the night sky shaped just like Peter.

For the Halloween episode "[[Trick or Treasure!|Trick or Treasure]]", Jake dresses as Peter, while at the end of the Christmas episode "[[It's a Winter Never Land!]]", Peter leaves gifts and a Forever tree, and a snowflake with his silhouette is seen flowing through the icy night sky as well as an echoed laugh from Peter.

Peter makes an appearance in the season 1 finale special, ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Peter Pan Returns|Peter Pan Returns]]''. In the special, Peter returns to Never Land to recruit Jake, [[Izzy]], [[Cubby]], and [[Skully]] to find his shadow, who escaped to Never Land. Without his shadow, Peter is plunged into a depressive state, unable to fly, causing more problems for the heroes and giving a plus to the revenge-seeking Captain Hook, who manages to capture the shadow, and attempts to use it as leverage to capture and exile Pan from Never Land. Eventually, Peter and the shadow are rejoined and leave Never Land once again to explore new parts of the world. However, Peter promises that he will be back soon.

Peter returns once again in the special ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Jake Saves Bucky|Jake Saves Bucky]]'' when the pirates lose their ship [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] to Captain Hook in a race against The Jolly Roger. Jake and the crew call Peter for help and the flying boy is able to learn that Jake and his crew can win Bucky back if they battle the Mighty Dragon and retrieve the legendary golden bell. The heroes do so, and Bucky is saved and Peter leaves once again to continue exploring the world.

Peter reappears once again in the special ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Rescue|Never Land Rescue]]'' under the disguise of the mysterious figure known as "The Guardian." Who explains that only the pirate who truly believes in himself can save Never Land from vanishing completely, Jake must break off from the rest of his crew and go alone on a mission to save the [[Forever Tree]], the source of magic throughout all of Never Land. 

In ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Battle for the Book|Battle for the Book]]'', Peter sends Jake and his crew to help his old friends, Wendy, John, and Michael, after Captain Hook attacks them and steals their storybook. Later on, Peter joins his friends in the battle for Wendy's storybook and for the memories and stories of Never Land.

Peter reappears in the episode "[[Jake's Awesome Surprise]]". He attends Jake's birthday celebration with Tinker Bell and the rest of the pirate teams' Never Land friends. He gives Jake fifteen birthday-themed gold doubloons as a present.

Peter and Tinker Bell both reappear in the episode "[[Peter Pan's 100 Treasures!]]", where it has Captain Jake and the other Never Land captains compete in a scavenger hunt.

Peter and his shadow both reappear in the episode "[[Pirate Fools Day!]]". Peter tries to calm his mischievous shadow who manages to slip away by warping Pan within a hammock inside Hangman's Tree. Peter later reappears in the episode coming to Jake and his crews' aid defending his shadow from the wicked shadow pirate Shade. Pan last appears in the episode as he greets Hook and his crew on the Jolly Roger and points out the Tick-Tock Croc on deck. Hook refuses to be tricked by Pan, believing it to be the cardboard cutout croc Sharky and Bones used on their prank on him earlier in the episode. Hook attempts to toss it overboard until he realizes it's the real crocodile and is chased across the deck of the ship. Smee, Sharky, and Bones wish Peter a happy Pirate Fools Day from the safety of the ship's mass before Pan leaves.

Peter is primarily the focus in the final episode, [[Captain Hook's Last Stand!]]. In the episode, the pirates celebrate Peter's official homecoming from the lands beyond the Never Sea (not counting his visits throughout the series). When showing his treasures to his mates, he unveils a powerful artifact: The Doom Stone, a cursed relic that can turn whoever uses it into stone, along with the user's targets. Unfortunately, Captain Hook devises yet another plot to get revenge on Peter Pan. He steals the Doom Stone and turns Peter into stone, (whilst turning himself into a darker, destructive, more powerful version of himself). Luckily, Peter is freed from his stone prison after being kissed by Wendy and is once again free to explore and defend Never Land, now with the help of the pirate boy-turned legend, Captain Jake.

[[File:Mean Dean.png|left|250px|Peter Pan as Sweet Pete in ''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers''.]]
Peter Pan, or more specifically the toon actor who played the character in the 1953 film, appears as the film's main villain, '''Sweet Pete'''. his film career was dashed when "The Boy Who Never Grew Up" hit puberty and he lost all professional film opportunities (contradicting all of his later appearances detailed above and below). After making a mock buster of his own film, Sweet Pete began his own bootleg film operation to regain some control in his life and became a Los Angeles crime boss. As the head of the Valley Gang, comprised of various "uncanny valley" CGI toons, Sweet Pete's various front businesses and his ties to crooked police officials allowed him to thrive in the underworld. Many toons, including [[Monterey Jack]] and [[Flounder]], found themselves deep in debt to the Valley Gang, resulting in them being kidnapped and forcibly altered into legally distinct bootleg versions of themselves for overseas mock buster film production. In the film's climax, the machine used to alter Toons and mix and match them is turned on Pete, transforming him into a chimeric monster. After a chase through the mock buster film studios, Chip and Dale manage to capture Sweet Pete and he and the rest of the Valley Gang are arrested. During the film credits, Sweet Pete is seen in his cell bound in a straitjacket on a hand truck with a muzzle on his face. A documentary about his rise and fall is also shown in a theater.

===Other appearances===
Peter makes a cameo appearance at the end of ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', calling the Lost Boys to their theater seats with his rooster crow.

===Live-action appearances===
====''[[Once Upon a Time]]''====
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 3x05 - Good Form - Photography - Peter Pan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Robbie Kay as the villainous Peter Pan.]]
Peter Pan appears as a major character in the first half of the third season of the [[ABC]] fairy tale drama series ''Once Upon a Time''. Here, however, he appears as a ruthless villain as opposed to the benevolent persona commonly seen in various Disney-related media. He is portrayed by Robbie Kay.

Peter Pan's real identity was Malcolm, the father of [[Rumplestiltskin]], separated spouse of the [[Black Fairy]] (formerly Fiona), the grandfather of [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]] and [[Gideon (Once Upon a Time)|Gideon]], and the paternal great-grandfather of [[Henry Mills]] and one of the great-great-grandfathers of [[Lucy (Once Upon a Time)|Lucy]]. Malcolm originally left his son in the care of two spinners, who gave Rumplestiltskin a magical bean to create a portal to leave his careless father. Using the magic bean, Malcolm and Rumplestiltskin traveled to [[Neverland]], a place which Malcolm envisioned in his dreams. Upon arrival, Malcolm discovered he could not fly like in his dreams, and the [[Peter Pan's Shadow|Shadow]] told him this is because he did not belong on the island as it was only for children. Realizing that he could not be a child as he was a father, Malcolm forced Rumplestiltskin to be taken home by the Shadow. Malcolm transformed into his younger self, adopting the name of Peter Pan (which he named himself after Rumplestiltskin's doll). The Shadow informed Pan that his youth is limited, and he will die when the hourglass of [[Skull Rock]] is complete.

Sometime later, Pan visits [[Hamelin]] in the [[Enchanted Forest]] to expand what would later become the [[Lost Boys]], a band of fearful followers who listen to Pan's every command and is in search for Henry, the son of [[Emma Swan]] and his great-grandson.

The Shadow arrives with a boy named Baelfire (who, unbeknownst to him, is his grandson). Wendy Darling then arrives in order to save him, but Pan decides to keep her prisoner and blackmails [[John Darling|John]] and [[Michael Darling]] to help him with his tasks, in exchange for their sister Wendy's life.

When the heroes arrive on Neverland in search of Henry, Pan appears to him as a fugitive boy pretending to escape from the Lost Boys. He "befriends" Henry who is also attempting to escape upon arriving in Neverland, following his kidnap from [[Storybrooke]]. He later reveals his true identity and tells Henry he possesses "the heart of the truest believer," which he now owns. Pan plots to sacrifice Henry to gain his youth as his time as a young boy begins to fade away. However, Emma, along with a team of heroes (being [[Snow White]], [[The Prince|Prince Charming]], Rumplestiltskin, [[The Evil Queen|Queen Regina]], and [[Captain Hook]]) comes to retrieve the boy.

The battle between the parties last for days, and eventually, they retrieve Henry and return to their home in the real world, known as Storybrooke, with Pan imprisoned. Pan, however, managed to switch his body with Henry's. Once they arrived in Storybrooke, Pan (in Henry's body) orders the Shadow to kill [[Blue Fairy|Mother Superior]] after reading Henry's book. He then steals the original curse from Regina that created Storybrooke, planning to enact it to turn the town into "The New Neverland." Emma soon finds out Henry is not who he seems, and the heroes are able to find out the truth, eventually switching the two bodies back. His plot is successful, though before it takes place, Gold manages to find a way to defeat his father by sacrificing himself with the [[Dark One's Dagger|Dark One's dagger]], thus ending his reign. Before Malcolm died, he reverted to his real form and identity just as Rumple was stabbing him.

He returned in the second half of the fifth season when the heroes (led by his son) arrived in the [[Underworld]] to rescue Hook. Upon their arrival, Pan immediately approaches Gold and offers him a deal - one of Gold's current allies would stay behind, and Pan would return in his place. At this point, Gold refuses, and Pan hands over the Ale of Seonaidh, the means Emma later uses to contact Hook.

However, after [[Hades]] backs Gold into corner Gold forms a partnership with Pan, and the two sorcerers kidnap Hades's true love [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West]]. Then the malevolent father-and-son pair offer Hades a counterproposal - he tears up the contract (which stated that Gold owed Hades his second-born child, Gideon) and then he would get the witch. But after Hades tears up the contract that gives him claim of his second grandson, Pan attempts to steal Zelena's heart, hoping to use it to return to life. This attempt is prevented by the timely arrival of Emma, who rescues Zelena. Pan questioned why his illegitimate granddaughter-in-law would be helping the king of death, and Emma pointed out that Hades promised to help them get them home. Gold then warned her that she had picked the wrong side, but Emma then questions why the Dark One was still there since he had already gotten what he wanted. Seeing her point, Gold responded by abandoning his father. Outnumbered, Pan is also forced to retreat.

Later, Pan tracks his son down and hands him Pandora's box, which he says Gold could use to more easily transport his wife [[Belle]] (who is under a sleeping curse, provided by Zelena) to Storybrooke. As a price of this gift, Gold was to steal a heart and give it to Pan, allowing the deceased man-child to return to life. However, the Dark One betrayed his father and instead inserted him with not the heart of [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]], but a sample of water from the River of Lost Souls and damned him for eternity. As Pan faded, Gold reiterated the statement he gave his father the first time he killed him: "Villains don't get happy endings." Peter Pan was obliterated while his pleased son bid him a cold farewell.

In the final season, an alternate version of the character appears near the finale, having been trapped by his son.

Once the captain is defeated, they go to the Big Ben Clock Tower, where Sora seals the keyhole and Peter sends Tinker Bell to accompany Sora on his journey, making her a summon ally.

Peter Pan returns to help defeat the mysterious [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Phantom|Phantom]] that attacks the Clock Tower after the completion of the Final Keyhole in [[Hollow Bastion]].

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', Peter Pan appears as a figment of Sora's memories. He tries to save Wendy from Captain Hook, in which he succeeds.

Peter Pan returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as a [[summon]] after Sora obtains the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Feather Charm|Feather Charm]]. The Feather Charm is only obtainable during the second visit to [[Port Royal]] after defeating the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Grim Reaper|Grim Reaper]] [[Heartless]] for the first time.

Peter Pan returns ten years before ''Kingdom Hearts'' in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]''. He encounters [[Terra]] on Skull Rock, where Terra attacks him, Captain Hook having tricked him into believing Peter Pan had stolen his treasure. They continue until the Lost Boys appear and clear up the misunderstanding. [[Unversed]] then attack, but Terra fights them off. Later, Peter comes into contact with Ventus, who has just defeated Hook in battle and who leaves a wooden keyblade in Peter's treasure chest so that they may remember them. Later on, Peter meets Aqua, who finds their treasure map. Peter makes Aqua the leader of the group to find their treasure, which Hook has stolen again. When Aqua finds the wooden keyblade Peter tells her that Ven left it there.

During the end credits, Peter is shown having stolen Hook's hat after recovering their treasure.

== Relationships ==

=== Tinker Bell ===
Tinker Bell is Peter Pan’s best friend and sidekick. The two have been inseparable ever since they met. Tinker Bell would often join Peter on many adventures and both of them value each other deeply. However, Peter does sometimes get annoyed with Tink, especially when she’s jealous, which often leads her to either refusing to help or even attempting to get rid of those she dislikes through murderous ways. Tinker Bell has very strong feelings for Peter, which makes her easily jealous of any girl who likes him. This is best shown when Peter is mad at Tinker Bell for nearly killing his friend, Wendy. Despite their setbacks, Peter still loves Tink as a friend and dislikes seeing her in danger. He would often risk his life to save Tinker Bell when she needs it.

=== Wendy Darling ===
Peter is very fond of Wendy because of the stories she tells, which are mainly about Peter and his adventures. He is fascinated by Wendy’s stories of him that he would often visit her to listen. When Peter learns that Wendy has to grow up, he was willing to take her to Neverland to become a mother to the Lost Boys and to tell stories. While it may seem that Peter is only interested in Wendy’s storytelling, he really values her as a true friend and appreciates Wendy’s way of helping people believe in him through her stories. In turn, Wendy has feelings for Peter, who doesn’t reciprocate them due to his young age preventing him from having a full understanding of love. Wendy would eventually outgrow her feelings for Peter as she became older and married Edward.

=== Captain Hook ===
Captain Hook has been Peter’s longtime arch-nemesis since the day he cut off Hook’s hand and fed it to the Crocodile during their first fight. Hook has loathed Peter ever since and the two would forever be stuck in a never-ending battle to decide who finally “walks the plank”. Despite being a boy and wielding only a dagger, Peter often bests Hook in many battles and enjoys playing pranks on him and the other pirates. 

=== John Darling ===
Peter didn’t have much interactions with John nor has a strong relationship with him like Wendy. He originally didn’t plan to bring John to Neverland, but agrees at Wendy’s request. Their friendship would slowly grow overtime and Peter would eventually appoint John to lead the Lost Boys in his absence.

=== Michael Darling ===
Like John, Peter doesn’t have a strong relationship with Michael. He only brought Michael to Neverland at Wendy’s request, but the two barely interacted with each other to have a strong friendship. However, Michael still admires Peter as a hero.

=== Lost Boys ===
Peter Pan is the leader of the Lost Boys, who look up to him. The group would often play games, have mock wars with the Indians, or mess with the pirates. Being the leader, Peter looks after the Lost Boys and dislikes when they’re in danger. He always makes sure that the Lost Boys remain safe and stay out of trouble.

=== Mr. Smee ===
Peter doesn’t see Smee as a threat like Captain Hook and the other pirates. Due to his clumsy and innocent nature, Smee easily gets along with Peter when Hook isn’t around. Otherwise, Peter would still be pranking him like the other pirates.

=== Tiger Lily ===
Despite not having much interactions with each other, Peter and Tiger Lily are shown to have a very strong friendship, which lead Captain Hook to believe that Tiger Lily knew the location of Peter’s hideout. Like many other women on the island, Tiger Lily has feelings for Peter and even gave him an Eskimo (nose kiss) in return for saving her life.

=== Indians ===
Peter is on good terms with the Neverland Natives. He often engages in mock wars with them, to see who would capture the other first before turning them loose for a new round. The Indian Chief is especially grateful to Peter for saving his daughter, Tiger Lily, and has made him a chief.

=== Mermaids ===
Peter would often visit the mermaids of Mermaid Lagoon to share stories of himself to them. Similar to Tinker Bell, the mermaids also have feelings for Peter and would attempt to drown any girl they believe love Peter, out of jealousy.

=== Jane ===
When they first met, Peter originally believed that Wendy’s daughter Jane, wanted to follow her mother’s footsteps. Their friendship was originally rough and not off to a good start when Peter realized that Jane is practical and doesn’t believe in him. Despite this difficulty, Peter was still willing to help Jane get home. Overtime, both Peter and Jane would bond as he helped teach her to become a Lost Boy. Their friendship took a toll when Jane betrayed Peter and allowed Captain Hook to kidnap him. Peter eventually forgives Jane after she saves Tink and the boys, and learns to believe.

=== Jake ===
Before leaving to explore the lands beyond the Never Sea, Peter recruited his own team of pirates to watch over Neverland in his absence. He left most of the responsibility to pirate leader Jake and believed in his great potential. He also gifted Jake a wooden sword that was carved from the Forever Tree. As such, the two share a very close friendship.

=== Izzy ===
Izzy is another pirate that Peter recruited to protect Neverland in his absence. He would also entrust her with a bag of pixie dust to use only for emergencies.

=== Cubby ===
Cubby is another pirate that Peter recruited to protect Neverland in his absence. He would also entrust him with a map to help navigate around the island.

=== Skully ===
Jake, Izzy, and Cubby’s pet parrot, Skully, looks up to Peter Pan greatly.

==Trivia==
*Peter Pan, in the Disney movie, is one of the few adaptations of the J.M. Barrie play where he is played by a male actor. In most versions, he is played by a female actress to resemble the pre-pubescent vocal styles and build of a young boy.
*Peter Pan was once considered to be voiced by a woman following the tradition of being portrayed by one in the original stage play. Among the considerations was that of Mary Martin, who later went on to portray the character the following year in the successful Broadway musical adaptation of the story.
**[[Anne Boonchuy]] can be seen wearing a Peter Pan costume during a play in the ''[[Amphibia]]'' episode "[[The First Temple]]".
*In Neverland, people never grow up. It is never confirmed how long Peter has been on the island or his actual age. It could be possible that Peter is hundreds or thousands of years old.
*J.M. Barrie had two inspirations for Peter Pan's name. The first is the mischievous Greek God, Pan. Peter's other namesake was Peter Llewelyn-Davies, who was one of the sons of his friend Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies. Peter and his brothers were the basis for Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.
*Peter Pan was nominated for AFI's 100 Years...100 Hero and Villain list, one of three animated heroes and one of four Disney heroes, along with [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] and [[Belle]]. Unfortunately, none of them made the cut.
*Not counting Mr. and Mrs. Darling, Peter Pan, ironically enough, is the only main character in the film who does not sing. He does, however, sing for the first time in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' in the episode "[[Donald Wants to Fly]]", and also sings in ''[[Return to Never Land]]''.
*In an early draft of the [[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]] film, Peter Pan was originally featured in the film and was going to show how Tinker Bell met him. The draft and its film production eventually got scrapped due to budget constraints within [[Disneytoon Studios|DisneyToon Studios]] and the film being deemed “virtually unwatchable.”
*For ''Once Upon a Time'', his casting call, using the codename "Rufio," describes him as "in his teens, and is a mischievous and devious Lost Boy". Like Hansel from Oz in s7, who masquerade as Jack, Peter Pan was not originally Pan but a different original character masquerading another character.
*Some of the promotional material for ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' had Pan listed as '''Mean Dean'''.
*The ''Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers'' film marks the second time Pan has been portrayed as a villain after ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. The version in the film is a middle aged Pan rather than a teenage/child version.
