== Biography ==
Ken first appears in ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'' as part of the [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)]] team. In the first match-up against [[Iceland]], he attempts to use one of his figure skating moves to get the puck into the goal but is brutally knocked down by the bigger players, thus making Coach Bombay irritated by the lack of effort Ken made. After taking what he has learned from [[Russ Tyler|Russ Tyler's]] LA Street Hockey Team and standing up against an Iceland team member twice his size, Ken became dubbed by [[Fulton Reed|Fulton]] and [[Dean Portman|Portman]] as "Little Bash Brother". He later attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''. Ken was picked on by the varsity team, who stole his lunch every day and distributed the contents of it amongst themselves. Later in the film, he begs Russ to teach him the tricks of talking smack to other team members but fails miserably when he delivers ones that are too long. He is portrayed by Justin Wong.

Ken Wu reappeared in [[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]] episode "[[Spirit of the Ducks]]". Notably, during the meet up with some of his teammates and [[Gordon Bombay]] at Twin City Slice, he did not mention what he had done since his time on the Ducks. When Fulton reminisced about getting in fights, Ken said they could still get into one and used his old fighting style. Like the rest of his friends, he was put off by Gordon's attitude towards them.

He attended the gala with his friends. When [[Evan Morrow]] told Ken and the others that Gordon was not invited to the gala, he and the other Ducks picked him up in a limo (which they drove onto the Ice Palace's ice) and took him to the gala. Once there, the old Ducks stopped a speech by Stephanie about how the true recipient of the rewards should be Gordon Bombay.

He is seen later on playing a hockey game with the Don't Bothers at the Ice Palace. Most notably, when everyone questioned whether he still had his figure skating skills, Ken showed off some great moves, proving that he had not lost his skills. He then tried to teach the Don't Bothers some of his moves.
== Playing Style ==
Ken uses his small size and figure skating experience to his advantage when playing offense. His skills are used to maneuver around opposing defenses and trick goaltenders. However, because of his small size, he is more vulnerable to bigger defenders if caught.
