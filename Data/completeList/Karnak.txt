'''Karnak''' is a member of the Inhuman race, one of those who form the Inhuman Royal Family, he has the ability to find the weak point in any person, plan, or object. Thus, he is usually used as the planner by the Inhumans. He also serves as a priest and philosopher to the Inhumans.
Karnak was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Powers and Abilities==
Karnak has enhanced strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as a result of his genetically superior Inhuman physiology. Unlike most Inhumans, he does not have superhuman powers as a result of exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, as he was never exposed to the Mist. Instead, Karnak has the extrasensory ability (achieved through meditation and intensive training) to perceive stress points, fracture planes, or weaknesses in objects or persons. He has complete voluntary control of most of his autonomic bodily functions. All striking surfaces of his body are extremely toughened. He is capable of shattering substances up to and including mild steel and rendering superhuman opponents unconscious by striking them.
