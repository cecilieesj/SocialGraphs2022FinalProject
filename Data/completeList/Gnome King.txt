|quote = }}The '''Gnome King''' is the main antagonist of ''[[The 7D]]'' episode "[[Jollyball Anyone?]]". He is also the ruler of an unnamed kingdom inhabited by just gnomes. During a royal meeting with [[Queen Delightful]] he trash talked her, and then the two made a bet over an upcoming game of jollyball. If the Gnome King wins, he would rule Jollywood and take over Delightful's castle. If Queen Delightful wins, she would get a stick of Gnomeberry Bubble gum from that king.
