== Background==
Gina is a polished pro with an Equity card and the unwavering belief that the drama teacher made a HUGE mistake not casting her as a lead. Gina is an entitled princess, but her ambition pales in comparison with her stage mother’s. Gina worries that she peaked in 6th grade, when she starred in a Canadian tour of ANNIE. Posts Instagram videos of her singing that go viral — and makes Nini seriously start to doubt her own talent. Voted “Most likely to push you down a flight of stairs.”<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/high-school-musical-series-development-190058962.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEpXP_lbnaNwG8QwSOThFxg8k0OE-bmzeDvMcxlx_fBuFs7lBfBWMlOep5W75PWLR6Rbn627s3kSCkfhoQdScKl-hwHb3ZxFc1x1ivSTvn0kPwBe9ev0oNfl8VSJZ7fobphr9mASsYW0-opQhxwbFtFEzyLw9Kfczn8Ea5CivSzA]</ref>

===Personality===
Gina Porter in the series is seen as a passionate student and, in general, person. This is especially emphasized for the most part of Season One's beginning half, when she is set upon claiming the role of Gabriella Montez. She radiates an aura of absolute confidence in both herself and her abilities, as seen in the manner in which she dances during the musical auditions. Other than that, she is charismatic, competitive and ambitious; furthermore, she seeks and strives for excellence. Although her character is commonly misinterpreted and misunderstood, Gina Porter is more than meets the eye. Later in the series, she is revealed to have layers in her personality, that being so because of her past. Gina's mom is an employee for F.E.M.A., which means she is forced to move multiple times, and she has been for the past six years. Because of this, she is emotionally reserved and does not allow just anyone in. However, it is seen that Ricky Bowen has become the first (known) exception thus far in the series. Concerning her hobbies that do not include the performing arts, Gina bakes, knits and does many more, thanks to her constant use of YouTube. Towards the end of Season One, she is seen as being more accepting — of her role as Taylor — and is portrayed as having built a firm relationship/friendship with the drama club. Overall, Gina Porter can be described through the famous saying, "Do not judge a book by its cover." In Most Likely To, her friend [[E.J. Caswell]] tells her that she is one of the bravest people he knows. 

=== Physical appearance===
Gina has brown eyes, naturally curly black hair and medium tan skin. In Season 1, Gina almost always had her hair up in either a ponytail or a bun. In Season 2, Gina started having her hair down more often.

Although he has no idea about the details, E.J. is sure about one thing: he is to be her date to their upcoming homecoming dance. In Homecoming, they both attend it together, where they have their photos taken. Later in that same episode, Gina pours her punch on him after they are seen in a heated argument. She ends up leaving alongside Ricky Bowen. Again, E.J. does not know, but Gina has abandoned their plans, which the former confronts her about. Due to Terri's (Gina's mom) job as a F.E.M.A. employee, she moves away from Salt Lake City and East High School.

In Second Chances they both plan to go on a date that EJ ends up calling off due to a misunderstanding from Gina's older brother Jamie Porter who tells E.J. that he is glad that Gina has him as a big brother figure in her life which makes him second guessing everything. E.J. distanced himself from Gina at the afterparty at Salt Lake Slices by sitting across the room from Gina next to Ricky Bowen. Right before E.J. heads out his cousin Ashlyn comforts E.J. and he tells her that he thinks Gina sees him as a big brother figure due to what Gina's older brother Jamie Porter told him. Then Ashlyn goes up to Gina and tells her about her most recent conversation with E.J. before he left the after party. Gina looks at Ashlyn very confused why E.J. would think that she sees him as a older brother figure. Gina chases after E.J. as he is heading out to his car and tells him that he got "bad intel" which causes E.J. to turn around.

This friendship was halted by the jealousy of Nini, who got back together with Ricky during Act 2. In the begging of Season 2 the Ricky and Gina's relationship was quite awkward, with Gina still having a crush on him. In the later half when Ricky breaks up with his girlfriend they barley interact. Ricky doesn't even mention trying to reach out to Gina showing that he has no interest in her. But it could be because of their conversation during The Quinceañero and how she ignored him in Yes, And....
