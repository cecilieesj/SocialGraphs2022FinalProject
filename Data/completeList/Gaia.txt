'''Gaia''' (also known as '''Mother Earth''') is the ancient earth goddess and mother of the [[Titans]]. She appeared in the ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]'' animated series episode "[[Hercules and the Prince of Thrace]]".

==Trivia==
*In the original myths, Gaia was not simply the mother of Disney's version of the Titans: she was also the mother of [[Kronos]] and the twelve original Titans. Kronos' children in these myths ([[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]], [[Hera]], [[Demeter]], and [[Hestia]]) were among her grandchildren. She was also related to many of the gods through Zeus.
*She and Uranus were mentioned in the Norwegian language version of ''The Gospel Truth I.'' The lyric goes, "En gang i fordums tid, vår unge jord var ennå i sjokk. For Uranos' og Gaias tolv titaner gikk amok!" ("Once upon a time, our young earth was still in shock. For the twelve titans of Uranus and Gaia went mad!")
