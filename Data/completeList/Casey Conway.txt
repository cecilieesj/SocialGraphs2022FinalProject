'''Casey Conway''' is the mother of [[Charlie Conway]], a minor protagonist in the Mighty Ducks trilogy and [[Gordon Bombay]]'s love interest in the [[The Mighty Ducks|first film]]. She is played by Heidi Kling.

==Biography==

====Early Years====
Casey is the single mother of Charlie and is over-protective of him after she apparently separated from her husband. It is not revealed what exaclty happened between her and her ex. She told Charlie that she and him left her husband, but nothing is revealed more.

====''The Mighty Ducks''====
She is first seen when she is waving down Bombay's limo after it is driving on the ice with the District 5 team. She angrily pulls Bombay aside and scolds him for putting her son’s life in danger. Her frustration with Gordon got a bit worse when Bombay attempted to make Charlie cheat to win a hockey game. Gordon however, apologized to both her and Charlie, which caused both her and Charlie to invite him for dinner.

Over time, she began to harbor feelings for Bombay as she saw how much he got along with her son. Her and Gordon even went on a small date at the Winter Parade where they revealed their feelings to each other. Casey was later present at the final game of the Ducks vs. the Hawks to support her son. When Charlie scored the final goal, she joined the team in celebrating and gave Gordon a kiss.

Later, when Gordon was about to leave to join the Minnesota Waves, she gives him a goodbye kiss (much to Charlie’s shock) and Gordon promises he will call her once he gets to the Hotel he is staying at.

====''D2: The Mighty Ducks''====
Casey doesn't appear in the movie, but she is mentioned by [[Jan (The Mighty Ducks)|Jan]] that she had re-married, giving Charlie a stepfather. Which did not sit well with Charlie as he was still fond of Bombay, so Charlie spent a lot of time at [[Hans' Sport Shop]].

====''D3: The Mighty Ducks''====
Casey re-appears in before the ducks were inducted into [[Eden Hall Academy|Eden Hall]]. She had learned from Gordon that he had intended to take a job in the Goodwill games committee. She encouraged him to tell Charlie about this himself. She later, drops Charlie off at the alley where Fulton practices so he can go to the school with Fulton.

Casey attends the Ducks game against the Bears, where she is put off by Charlie’s temper during the game, and scolds him after the game. When Charlie tries to shift the blame to [[Ted Orion|Coach Orion]], Casey says that his attitude needs to change and that he felt the same way about Gordon Bombay when he was younger.

When Charlie visits his mother at her job, she is seen crying and she reveals that Hans has passed away. She attends Hans's funeral along with the rest of the Ducks and Bombay. She is also present when Bombay presents his case to have the Ducks scholarships re-instated to Eden Hall.

In the final game of the Ducks vs. the Warriors, she is seen being appalled at the [[Eden Hall Warriors|Warriors]] dirty tactics against her sons team.

When the Ducks win, she tells Charlie that she is proud of him and tells him to go and celebrate his victory.

==Trivia==
*Despite them breaking up before the events of ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'', there are scenes that imply that Casey and Gordon still have feelings for each other:
**They are seen together in the beginning
**Casey smiles at Gordon when he addresses the Eden Hall board.
**Casey had no problem with Gordon going to Charlie's room to wake him up.
**Despite Jan saying that she re-married in the second film, her spouse is not seen or mentioned in the third. This could be because she divorced him because of her feelings for Gordon.
*Casey has similarities to Lucille LaRusso from The Karate Kid (1984):
**Both are single-mothers who want the best for their sons.
**Both only appear in the first and third films of their franchise, and are only mentioned in the second.
**Both drive a car that is old and broken down.
*[[Alex Morrow]]'s character from ''[[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]]'' might've been partly inspired by Casey's.
