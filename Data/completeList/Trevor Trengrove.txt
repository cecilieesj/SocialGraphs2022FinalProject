==Background==
Twenty years prior to the start of the series, Trevor Trengrove was a student at the [[San Fransokyo Institute of Technology]], where he worked closely with his lab partner, [[Wendy Wower]], under the guidance of their professor, [[Professor Granville|Granville]]. Wendy created a thesis that was considered a breakthrough for artificial intelligence. Before word could get out, however, Trengrove claimed the thesis as his own, and went on to achieve fame and fortune as S.F.I.T.'s most famous alumni. Wendy, meanwhile, would fade into obscurity and be seen as something of a laughing stock. The truth behind Trevor's wrongdoings were stored in a drive, of which he became extremely protective over.

==Role in the series==
At some point, the crime boss [[Yama (Big Hero 6)|Yama]] got hold of Trevor's drive, and used it to blackmail the scientist into working for him. As ordered, Trevor held a workshop for San Fransokyo Tech students, in search of young physics, chemistry and engineering students that could help modify Yama's robot, Mega Yama. In order to keep [[Hiro Hamada]] from interfering with Yama's plot, Trevor banned any students under sixteen from his workshop.

Trevor eventually came down to three students: [[Go Go Tomago]], [[Honey Lemon]] and [[Wasabi]]. Although the three found Trevor's behavior to be a tad suspicious, they never caught on, and were successful in updating Yama's bot to be a powerful killing machineâ€”unknowingly. Suddenly, Hiro arrives under the assumption that Trevor was in danger at the hands of Yama, only to quickly learn that Trevor was working for Yama. Honey Lemon and Wasabi confront Trevor, but he explains the alliance was built on blackmail.

[[Big Hero 6 (team)|Big Hero 6]] are able to defeat Yama, retrieve the drive, and return it to Trevor. Having had a change of heart, however, Trevor confesses what he had done to Wendy, and gives the drive to her. He then expresses his desire to share the truth with the world, thus allowing Wendy to finally receive the credit she deserves.

== Trivia ==
* Trengrove has his own sports drink brand with the name Jumper Cable, which tasted awful, according to Go Go, whom claims that it's like drinking "dumpster juice".
