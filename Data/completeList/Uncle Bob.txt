==Trivia==
*His full name is an homage to American Civil War hero, General Robert E. Lee.
*According to the French ''Goof Troop'' (''La Bande Ã  Dingo'') comic story "A Vos Souhaits!" ("Bless You!"), published in [[Le Journal de Mickey]] issue 2151 in [[1993]], Uncle Bob is apparently married. In that story, Pete looks for an old top hat in the bottom drawer of his dresser. Once he finds it, he refers to the hat as "The top hat from Uncle Bob's wedding!" ("Le chapeau haut de forme du marriage de L'oncle Bob!").
