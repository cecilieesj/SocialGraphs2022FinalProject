Earlier in his debut, he puts a cigarette in a fellow sportcaster's coffee mug and he's also shown to drink on the job.

==Role in the film==
Ranch and [[George Knox]] have hated each other since their days as baseball players, when Ranch rammed George's knee with his cleets' nails, ending his days as a player. After a game, Ranch interviews George. While they are arguing, George punches Ranch as payback, giving him a black eye, over which he tends to press assault charges.

Later, [[J.P.]] accidentally reveals to Ranch that [[Roger Bowman]] has the ability to see angels and that George has been winning through the advice Roger gave him. Hoping to destroy George's career permanently, Ranch informs the press of this, and [[Hank Murphy]] threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to [[Maggie Nelson]] about his special ability, and at a press conference, they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Hank allows him to remain as Angels' manager, much to Ranch's anger.

Hank later fires Ranch because of his denigration of the team, and he was forever banned from a career in baseball.
