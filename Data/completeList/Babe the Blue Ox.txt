==Appearances==
===''[[Paul Bunyan]]''===
During the Winter of the Blue Snow, Paul rescues Babe after hearing him moo for help. Striking an immediate friendship, they journey west through the snowfields. The tracks they left behind would end up becoming the 10,000 Lakes that gave Minnesota its nickname. Other feats the two accomplished included logging throughout the Dakotas, carving the Missouri River to send logs downstream, creating Pike's Peak to serve as a lookout, created the Grand Tetons through their playful wrestling, and created Yellowstone Falls to clean up. Eventually, when losing a logging contest to a new electric sawing machine lead to their superhuman feats falling out of fashion, the two would travel far north to the wilds of Alaska, with the Northern Lights being the result of their play disrupting the aurora borealis.
