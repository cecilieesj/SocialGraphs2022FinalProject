}}'''Brian''' is a mouse that lives in the wall of Bear Family house. He considered himself to have bad luck; in truth, he cannot see very well without glasses. He is the grandson of a famous clock repaired Hickory Dickory Dock. He is able to repair the Grandpa Bear's clock. Now he is living inside the clock. Brian later appeared in "[[Team Tiny]]", when Goldie and Bear teamed up with him, [[Vern]], and [[Itsy]] to retrieve [[Mama Bear]]'s ring from the Mouse King.
