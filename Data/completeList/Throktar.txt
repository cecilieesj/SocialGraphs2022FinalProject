'''King Throktar''' is the proper ruler of [[Udrogoth]]. He is the husband of Queen [[Glimia]] and the father of [[Dave Barbarian|Dave]], [[Candy Barbarian|Candy]], and [[Fang Barbarian|Fang]].

He is away fighting evil all around the world, all though he can communicate with his children via uncle [[Oswidge]]'s crystal ball, which seems to operate like a telephone.

He gets called occasionally while he is in a terrible situation.

He is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].
