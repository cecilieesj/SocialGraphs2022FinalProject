'''Tex Ranger'''<ref>Page 5 of ''[[America Sings (soundtrack)|America Sings]]'' soundtrack book</ref> is a character at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
Tex Ranger is an anthropomorphic cowboy dog. In the "Heading West" sequence of the attraction, he would sing the song "[[Home on the Range (song)|Home on the Range]]". He wears a red scarf, a white cowboy hat, and is shown to be using a guitar, just like cowboys in media. According to the ''America Sings'' soundtrack book, it is implied that he is playing a lullaby for the desert animals while singing the aforementioned song.

===Development History===
The Tex Ranger character was created for the [[America Sings]] attraction at [[Disneyland]] in the [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] section where he was placed in the "Heading West" sequence where he sings the song, "[[Home on the Range (song)|Home on the Range]]", which opened on [[June 29]], [[1974]]. However, America Sings closed on [[April 10]], [[1988]] in order to retheme the attraction to [[Innoventions]], with Tex Ranger and most of the animatronics moved to [[Splash Mountain]] at the [[Critter Country (Disneyland)|Critter Country]] section, which opened on [[July 17]], [[1989]].

As of [[2020]] due to Splash Mountain being completely reimagined into a [[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|theme inspired by]] ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' in order to remove references to ''[[Song of the South]]'', it is currently unknown of what will replace Tex's animatronic in the rethemed version of the attraction.

==Appearances==

===[[America Sings]]===
Tex Ranger was featured during the former attraction's second act, "Heading West" where he is seen holding a guitar and singing the musical number, "[[Home on the Range (song)|Home on the Range]]" in front of a group of desert animals. Amongst the animals listening to his song are an owl, a rattlesnake, a roadrunner, a tortoise, and two rodents (presumably prairie dogs) that are quietly observing Tex's singing. As he sings throughout the sequence, coyotes are heard howling in the background just before the song loops into the attraction's third act, "Gay Nineties".

===[[Splash Mountain]]===
In the California version of Splash Mountain, Tex can be seen at the end of the attraction, singing the musical number "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" along with a whole chorus of animals welcoming [[Br'er Rabbit]] in his home at the [[Briar Patch]] after escaping from [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Bear]].

In the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version, a dog animatronic identical to Tex Ranger was placed during the "[[How Do You Do?]]" sequence where he is seen performing with a harmonica-playing raccoon and a porcupine using a short stump as a drum.

==Trivia==
*Tex Ranger is most likely named after the late real-life cowboy and singer, [[Wikipedia:Tex Ritter|Tex Ritter]]. Notably enough, Ritter died on [[January 2]], [[1974]], five months before America Sings opened at Disneyland.
