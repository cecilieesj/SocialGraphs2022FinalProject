{{Q|Those are sea lions, they're natural predators. They could pounce at any moment.|[[Marlin]] to [[Nemo]]}}
'''Fluke and Rudder''' are two sea lions in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Finding Dory]]''. A running gag is when [[Gerald]] comes up on their rock, both of them bark, "Off! Off! Off!" at him to prevent other seals/sea lions from sitting on their rock.

==Appearances==

===''[[Finding Dory]]''===
Fluke and Rudder first appear when [[Marlin]] and [[Nemo]] accidentally wake them up from their nap on their rock. When the clownfish family asks them about the [[Marine Life Institute|Institute]], they tell them that it is a fish hospital, while describing their experiences there (Fluke with a nasal parasite, and Rudder having anemia). Their discussion is interrupted by the arrival of [[Gerald]], whom they shoo off. The sea lions help the clownfish get in the Institute by calling their loon friend, [[Becky (Finding Nemo)|Becky]], to fly them in there. When Marlin mentions that he and Nemo need water, they trick Gerald into giving up his pail by inviting him on their rock before promptly kicking and shooing him off.

They next appear near the end as they watch the excitement of [[Dory]] saving her friends by vacating their rock (which is promptly taken over by Gerald) and despite not helping Dory, they are showered with fish (even being hit by a large one).

They last appear after the end credits where they are sleeping again on their rock, briefly shooing off Gerald again when he attempts to gain entry on the rock. They witness the [[Tank Gang]] being taken by the humans before resuming their nap, unknowingly being stalked by Gerald, who gives a devious laugh.

===''[[Marine Life Interviews]]''===
Fluke and Rudder appear in this short film where they comment on Dory about her encounters with the residents of the Marine Life Institute, along with Destiny, Bailey, and Hank.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
In [[Disney California Adventure]], Fluke and Rudder can be seen in a Finding Dory-inspired billboard at [[Pixar Pier]] telling visitors to keep Pixar Pier clean, along with some [[Otters|sea otters]], [[Gerald]], and Dory.

==Trivia==
*In the early stages of the sequel, [[Idris Elba]] and [[Dominic West]] were originally going to portray the villainous Dr. Mobster and a shark hunter Jinx respectively, but they were scrapped and changed into sea lions instead.
*[[Andrew Stanton]] admitted that he casted Elba and West because he wanted to have a reunion between the two co-stars of ''[[wikipedia:The Wire|The Wire]]''.
*Fluke and Rudder's recurring lines: "Off! Off! Off!" when shooing away Gerald is similar to the [[Seagulls (Finding Nemo)|Seagulls]] cawing, "Mine! Mine! Mine!" in ''[[Finding Nemo]]''. It also bears similarities to actual sea lions barking.
*Fluke is Idris Elba's third role for a Disney film released in [[2016]] (and the third of a talking animal role), the first two being [[Chief Bogo]] from ''[[Zootopia]]'' and [[Shere Khan]] from the [[2016]] adaptation of  ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.
*They are never named in the film.
