'''Stanley "Caveman" Yelnats IV''' is the protagonist of the [[2003]] live-action film, ''[[Holes]]''.

== Background ==
"Stanley" is "Yelnats" spelled backwards, and because of this, many members of the Yelnats family have been named Stanley, including Stanley's [[Stanley Yelnats III|father]] and [[Stanley Yelnats II|grandfather]]. Stanley is a good-hearted teenager born to a luckless family who have been cursed for years. He is a very responsible, nice, caring teenager. It is revealed that he cares about [[Hector Zeroni|Zero]]. He is the luckiest of the Yelnats descendants.

==Appearances==
===''[[Holes]]''===
After being tried and 'proven' guilty of stealing [[Clyde Livingston|Clyde "Sweetfeet" Livingston's]] shoes, he was sent to [[Camp Green Lake]], a detention camp in [[Texas]] run by [[Warden Walker]]. It is revealed that he cares about [[Hector Zeroni|Zero]]. Ironically, it was Yelnats' acceptance of Zero that lifted the curse on his family and led to the proof that he was innocent.

== Trivia ==
* Stanley was Shia LaBeouf's film debut.
* His last name is his first name backwards.
* He broke the Yelnats Curse by carrying Hector Zeroni — the descendant of Madame Zeroni, the spellcaster — up to [[God's Thumb]], giving him the water from the stream and singing the pig lullaby.
