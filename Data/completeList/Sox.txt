'''Sox''' is a robotic cat and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]]'s personal companion and the tritagonist in the [[2022]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Lightyear]]''.

==Background==
Sox was a gift from [[Alisha Hawthorne|Alisha]] when Buzz returned four years later during his first hyperspeed test flight. He is programmed to provide personal and emotional support for Buzz, and is equipped with a number of accessories needed to assist him, such as tranquilizers, blowtorch, headlights, and the ability to override computer systems by plugging his tail into a computer socket (it is also used for his charging complement).

Despite being an intelligent robot and able to talk, Sox still behaves like a real cat, rubbing against people's legs, purring when he gets affection, and getting distracted by laser points.

===Physical appearance===
Sox resembles a ginger and white robot cat with green eyes and wears a blue collar with his name engraved on a tag.

==Trivia==
*Sox's name is a play on the word "socks", which is a human everyday object, most likely to him after as a name for socks the cat, as it is a popular domestic cat name among cat owners. However, in Australian origin, the name Sox means "Saviour".
*When Sox greets Buzz, he says his lines that are similar to [[Baymax]] from [[Big Hero 6]] which are, "Hello, I am Baymax. Your personal healthcare companion".
*A sticker of Sox was seen on [[Miriam Mendelsohn]]'s skateboard in ''[[Turning Red]]''.
*In an early version of ''Lightyear'', Sox was originally going to look and act way more cat-like (according to concept art) in which he would look more true-to-the-word to real life ginger cats; in addition he also had no collar, had yellow eyes, and his body and tail had stripes. According to storyboard artist Dean Heezen, some additional cat-like things Sox could’ve done was stretch, stand on hind legs, ambush, and itch. He would’ve also coughed up hairballs, and he also would’ve had retractable claws and actual fangs. He even had tapidum lucidum, aka Night Vision (an animal's way of seeing in the dark) whenever Buzz or if any of the Junior Zap Patrol shone a bright light on him.<ref>https://pixarpost.com/2022/04/lightyear-film-facts.html</ref>
