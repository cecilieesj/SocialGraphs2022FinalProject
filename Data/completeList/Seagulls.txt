{{Quote|Oh, would you just shut up?! You're rats with wings!|[[Nigel (Finding Nemo)|Nigel]] to the seagulls}}

'''Seagulls''' are antagonists of the [[2003]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.

==Appearances==
{{Quote|Mine!|The seagulls' only word}}

===''[[Finding Nemo]]''===
In the film, they are portrayed as greedy, single-minded eating machines who only shout one word: "Mine!"

They are first seen cawing "Mine!" while [[Nigel (Finding Nemo)|Nigel]] has a crab in his wing that he is going to eat. However, much to his irritation, he ends up relieving the crab when he overhears from his fellow pelicans that [[Nemo]]'s father, [[Marlin]], is trying to search for his son, although the crab manages to escape from the seagulls.

Later, in the harbor of Sydney, the Seagulls surround Nigel, Marlin, and [[Dory]] while trying to escape from Nigel. Marlin and Dory thinks the pelican is going to eat them, but when Nigel tells them that he knows where Nemo is, Marlin flips in excitement, and the seagulls rush forward to capture the fish. Nigel scoops up them in his beak and flies away while they are being chased by the seagulls. They pursue after Nigel until their beaks crash into a sail of one of the sailboats.

Sometime later, Dory threatens to feed a crab to the seagulls when he does not want to tell them where Marlin went. The fearful crab then tells them where Marlin is and Dory frees him just moments before he gets eaten by the gulls.

===''[[Finding Dory]]''===
A similar flock of seagulls briefly appears during the climax of the film, still saying "Mine! Mine! Mine!", when Dory and [[Hank]] steal the Cleveland Aquarium truck by scaring off the truck drivers.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
===[[Disneyland]]===
Three of the seagulls appear on top of a buoy as animatronics in the [[Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage]] lagoon. They periodically flap their wings and say "Mine! Mine! Mine!"

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
Three of the seagulls reside on the rocks outside the entrance to [[The Seas with Nemo & Friends]] at [[Epcot]]. Like their Disneyland counterparts, they periodically flap their wings and say "Mine! Mine! Mine!"

At [[Finding Nemo - The Musical]] in [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], they do not actually appear in the show itself, but they do appear in the bubbles flanking the stage after the show ends to say "Bye! Bye! Bye!"

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===
Two of the seagulls sit on top of a billboard in the loading area of [[Crush's Coaster]] at the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]]. Like their American cousins, they periodically say "Mine! Mine! Mine!"

==Trivia==
*The seagulls' design is based on Feathers McGraw, the antagonist penguin from the ''[[wikipedia:Wallace and Gromit|Wallace and Gromit]]'' short "The Wrong Trousers".
*A different flock of seagulls resembling the ones from the first film makes an appearance near the end of ''[[Finding Dory]]'' when Dory and [[Hank]] drive the truck containing the quarantined fish into the ocean. Like the other flock, all they say is "Mine! Mine! Mine!"
*In the Polish dub of the movie, the Seagulls say, "Daj! Daj! Daj!" (pronounced like the English word "die"), which actually means "Give" in English.
*Some seagulls also make a cameo appearance in ''[[LEGO The Incredibles]]'' throughout the level "Above Parr". In this game, they are shown as regular LEGO seagulls, but still say, "Mine! Mine! Mine!"
*Similar to the seagulls in the film, seagulls in real life are also known for being a very opportunistic bird that will approach people trying to obtain their food in urban locations. They can also be aggressive when trying to obtain food, so in some places feeding these birds is not only discouraged, but also illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shorelocalnews.com/on-jersey-shore-beaches-opportunistic-seagulls-get-the-last-laugh/|website=Shore Local|title=On Jersey Shore Beaches, Opportunistic Seagulls Get the Last Laugh|date=[[June 13]], [[2019]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savecoastalwildlife.org/save-coastal-wildlife-blog/2020/2/17/have-we-all-missed-the-point-about-seagulls|title=Have we all missed the point about seagulls?|website=Save Coastal Wildlife|date=[[February 17]], [[2020]]}}</ref>
