'''Luna''' is a character on the children's television series ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''. She is the moon and a close friend of [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]] who usually can tell what he is thinking, sometimes to the point of speaking in unison with him. Due to her age, she is also very wise.

==Role in the series==
At the end of every episode, [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]] goes up to the attic, or sometimes to the [[Otter Pond]], to talk with Luna about the day's events. Their conversations always end with them singing "[[Goodbye Song|The Goodbye Song]]" before she leaves to light up the night sky. On a few occasions, other characters talk with Luna and accompany her and Bear in "The Goodbye Song".

In the fourth season, Luna has a more yellow coloring.

==Trivia==
* Luna is also the word for "moon" in Spanish and Italian.
* Luna appears in every episode.
