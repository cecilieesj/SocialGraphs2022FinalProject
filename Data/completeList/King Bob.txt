}}'''Robert "King Bob"'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046887/</ref> is the unibrow king of the Third Street School playground from ''[[Recess]]''. He has a very demanding and impatient personality, yet he is an honest and fair ruler. His best friends are Jordan and Jerome, his advisers. He is also friends withÂ [[T.J. Detweiler]] and invited him to a roast in [[Prince Randall]]. Even though he is at least two years older than T.J. and the gang, he has been seen in the fourth graders' class before. He was voiced by [[Lane Toran]].
==Background==
===Personality===
[[File:King Bob.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
Bob has a demanding, overbearing, impatient, but at times, an honorable personality. He also has knowledge of many of the rules of the playground as well as the unwritten student code of honor. On the few times he is pranked, he obsesses over pranking back the perpetrator, going so far as to abandon his duties for some time.

During the episode "[[Pharaoh Bob]]" we learned a little about Bob's introspective side. Realizing the children of the playground had already forgotten their previous monarchs, Bob began to obsess over his legacy. His attempts to write his memoirs lend further weight to this.

===Physical appearance===
He is typically depicted in a white and blue number 8 jersey, white and red wristbands, a blue lined red cape, blue jeans, and a hockey stick in his hand. He has black hair and a rather neat unibrow that he is never seen without, even after his haircut in "[[Bad Hair Day (Recess)|Bad Hair Day]]". His most notable piece of clothing is his yellow crown-shaped hockey or football helmet with a brown B on its front. In Recess: School's Out it is revealed that he has graduated from 6th grade and will be leaving 3rd Street School to attend Middle School, naming [[King Freddie II|
Freddy]] as his successor.
