'''Glowfish''' is a small-time antagonist who appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'' television series.

He appears in the episode "[[Red (episode)|Red]]". Seems like whoever does the hiring in [[King Triton]]'s palace doesn't do a great job screening possible employees because in the episode, Glowfish is seen to be working as a treasurer for the Atlantican king, when what he really wants is to have the treasure all for himself.
