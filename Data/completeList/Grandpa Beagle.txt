He first appeared in the [[Carl Barks]] stories ''The Fantastic River Race'' (as Blackheart Beagle) and ''The Money Well'' (as Grandpa Beagle).

==History==
[[File:Bb2.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|The older generation of Beagle Boys in Barks' ''The Fantastic River Race''.]]
In Scrooge's flashback in ''The Fantastic River Race'', Blackheart Beagle looks very similar to his children and his present-day grandkids, albeit with a long, twirly mustache, a black and blue uniform, and sailor hat. In ''[[The Money Well]]'', Grandpa Beagle appears as an elderly Beagle Boy with the number 186-802.

Grandpa Beagle was used again in [[1962]] by Rodolfo Cimino, as the Beagle Boys' leader, in the comic ''Zio Paperone caporale d'assalto''. In Italian stories, Grandpa Beagle has the word "Grazia" instead of a prison number, indicating that he may have been pardoned, though he is often seen in (or escaping from) prison. Sometimes he is portrayed in the same physical shape as his grandkids, sometimes thinner, and sometimes he's thin when all the Beagle Boys are shown as such.

Whereas Blackheart and Grandpa Beagle were two separate characters in the works of their creator Carl Barks, they were the same person in [[Don Rosa]]’s work. Under Rosa, Blackheart is Scrooge’s oldest nemesis, and one of the greatest villains in [[Duckburg]], even capable to assemble an alliance of [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s enemies in the 1997 story ''[[A Little Something Special]]''.

==Trivia==
*Just like [[John D. Rockerduck]], Grandpa Beagle was used only once by his creator, [[Carl Barks]], but became popular in Italian comics.
*Barks did not intend for Blackheart Beagle from ''The Fantastic River Race'' and Grandpa Beagle from ''The Money Well'' to be one and the same character when creating the characters. For unknown reasons, [[Don Rosa]] depicted them as the same character in ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''.
*In some European productions, such as his character profile poster in the German ''[[Micky Maus Magazin]]'', Grandpa Beagle was said to be the Beagle Boys' father rather than their grandfather.
*Brazilian writers depict him as a respected semi-retired crook who sometimes gives advice to the Beagle Boys.
*In the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|2017 DuckTales continuity]], a Character named [[Grandpappy Beagle]] is presumably based on Grandpa Beagle who also shares the same nickname as him in the comics.
