== Background ==
Annesa assists Jasmine in her daily activities. She is first seen helping prepare a bath for Jasmine.

Jasmine is seen speaking to her about her stressful day teaching at the Royal Academy, having to deal with the unruly children, and her want to quit. Aneesa offers her the advice of treating the kids how she treated Jasmine when she was a young girl, and to never give up. Jasmine goes on to ask if she was really that bad. Aneesa goes on to light-heartedly confirm that she was an "absolute nightmare". She then tucks Jasmine into bed.

When [[Sahara]] goes missing Jasmine asks for Aneesa for help to distract the Sultan from going to see Sahara. She is successful and Jasmine returns with Sahara on time.

== Trivia ==
* Given how Jasmine's biological mother passed away when Jasmine was very young, it can be assumed that Aneesa has acted as a motherly figure to Jasmine since her mother passed away.
