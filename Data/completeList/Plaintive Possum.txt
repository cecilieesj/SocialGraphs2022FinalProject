The '''Plaintive Possum''' is a character featured in the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
As her name implies, the Plaintive Possum is a mother opossum who says a "tender complaint sung from the heart", expressing her own sorrow about her life being stressed out, stressing herself about her overworked routine where she sings "I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again" hoping that she were a single mother again to help her overcome the challenges of being stressed.

===Development History===
The Plaintive Possum character was created for the defunct [[America Sings]]  attraction at [[Disneyland]] in the [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] section where she was placed in the "Going South" sequence, which opened on [[June 29]], [[1974]]. However, America Sings closed on [[April 10]], [[1988]] in order to retheme the attraction to [[Innoventions]], with the plaintive possum and most of the animatronics moved to [[Splash Mountain]] at the [[Critter Country (Disneyland)|Critter Country]] section, which opened on [[July 17]], [[1989]] while the three baby opossums hanging upside-down during the former attraction's first act were redressed as female opossums wearing bows and thin tutus named "[[Pansy, Poppy, and Petunia]]" respectively. However, the two opossum joeys (specifically the ones standing next to their mother) are the only ones who keep their original designs from the original incarnation of the attraction.

As of [[2020]], Splash Mountain at the Disneyland Park is announced for closure in order to retheme the attraction into a [[The Princess and the Frog|''Princess and the Frog'']]-[[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|themed attraction]] in order to remove references to ''[[Song of the South]]'', due to outdated cultural depictions from the film itself which the attraction is based on. Therefore, it is currently unknown of what will replace the plaintive possum's animatronic in the rethemed version of the Disneyland version of Splash Mountain.

==Appearances==
===[[America Sings]]===
The Plaintive Possum appears during the first act's musical number "I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again" where she sings "I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again", expressing herself about her overworked, stressful life about her desires to be a single mother again while five animatronic baby opossums are displayed next to her which are her children. After singing, the sequence loops to the "Down in the Valley" musical number.

===[[Splash Mountain]]===
Found only in the Disneyland version of Splash Mountain, the Plaintive Possum is seen during the end of the Laughing Place sequence worried about [[Br'er Rabbit]]'s encounter with [[Br'er Fox]] fearing that Br'er Fox will eat him, followed by a mother rabbit and her children sad about Br'er Rabbit about to become Br'er Fox's meal. Originally they sang "[[Sooner or Later (Song of the South)|Sooner or Later]]" when the attraction first opened, the song itself was eventually replaced by "[[Burrow's Lament]]" where the song itself has an ominous-sounding score about Br'er Rabbit being held hostage by Br'er Fox who is about to cook Br'er Rabbit into rabbit stew. After the last drop, the next scene where Br'er Rabbit is seen is during the "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" sequence where he happily returns home after successfully having managed to escape from Br'er Fox with the latter being caught by [[Br'er Gator]].

==Trivia==
*In the [[Disneyland]] version of [[Splash Mountain]], the Plaintive Possum wears a different maid outfit different from the one in the America Sings incarnation of the attraction closely resembling the colors of the clothes that [[Miss Possum]] wears in ''[[Song of the South]]'' which Splash Mountain is based on.
