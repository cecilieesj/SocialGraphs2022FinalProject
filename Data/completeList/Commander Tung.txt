'''Commander Tung''' is a character in the [[2020]] live-action [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Mulan (2020 film)|Mulan]]''. He is the mentor and teacher to Mulan who leads the Imperial Regiment.

==Trivia==

* He is one of the several brand-new characters created for the live-action film.
*He once fought together with [[Fa Zhou|Hua Zhou]] in the past.
* Both [[Chen Honghui]] and Commander Tung are loosely based on [[Li Shang]], [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]]'s love interest in the [[Mulan|original animated film]]. While the latter resembles Li Shang appearance-wise yet different in terms of personality, the former fulfills his character basis's position as Mulan's lover in the remake.
**According to producer Jason Reed, the decision to omit Shang from the movie was partially inspired by the #MeToo movement, under the belief that having the commanding officer of an army serve as a "sexual love interest" was inappropriate. Instead, Shang’s role was split into two new characters; one is Commander Tung, the General and a mentor figure to Mulan. The other is Honghui, one of Milan’s army peers who eventually becomes her love interest. This decision was met with notable controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindamaleh/2020/02/28/disney-blames-metoo-for-li-shangs-absence-from-mulan-in-new-controversy/#37acd4a55965|title=Disney Blames #MeToo For Li Shang’s Absence From ‘Mulan’ In New Controversy|website=Forbes|last=Maleh|first=Linda|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>
