'''Boomer Parker '''(portrayed by [[Doc Shaw]]) is [[Brady Parker|Brady]]'s twin and inherited his mom's skin color.

==Personality==
Boomer is very caring but is sometimes very selfish because he was ready to pack up and leave Kinkow Island immediately. He always hits on girls, but strangely doesn't really seem to have crush on Mikayla, possibly due to knowing that Brady harbors feelings towards her. He considers himself to be very good-looking and may not be very smart. He believed himself to be a good singer in the episode "Tone Deaf Jam" thinking he had "The Chimes", later it turning out that Brady had "The Chimes". Boomer is he most historical of the twins, in boooooo-mer episode he repeatedly makes fun of Brady and repeats "Ghost party".

Boomer is the most confident, he is always hitting on the girls and doesn't care what he looks like in the process.
