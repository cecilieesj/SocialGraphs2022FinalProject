'''Dr. Frakes''' is a character in the [[2019]] animated series, ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Dr. Frakes is a genius but quite unethical, fame-hungry and wacko scientist. She owns an educational center for children as she hopes they admire her and her experiments. Frakes is also very egotistical and would commit immoral unethical means in the pursuit of science, where she decided to dissect the Plantars, despite them being harmless in nature. 

===Physical appearance===
Dr. Frakes is an elderly woman with messy hair and yellow sunglasses, some missing teeth and a lab coat.

==Role in the series==
She is the founder of Dr. Frakes' Brainasium. During the night when [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] and [[Marcy Wu|Marcy]] got teleported into [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] by the [[Calamity Box]], it also triggered the devices used by Frakes and her assistant [[Terri (Amphibia)|Terri]] which the portal created by the device almost sucked them into Amphibia though only sucked Frakes' Skip Man she was listening to which would be found by Curator Ponds and later got to Anne's hands. One day Anne the Plantars arrive Dr. Frakes' children's museum to pick up on a lead that could lead them back to Amphibia .

While there, the group poses as reporters interested in her real studies, not just the kids' experiments. After some bartering they are let in, where Dr. Frakes explains that only recently did her studies lunge forward when an energy event opened a portal in her equipment, and we see the flashback of Anne, Sasha, and Marcy opening the Calamity Box and being sucked into Amphibia, but also at Frakes' lab, where a Skip-Man was sucked into the energy field.

Dr. Frakes explains that she can keep the portal open for a short time, but the magnetic interference doesn't allow her to get any clean images of it.

The group thinks they see Amphibia in the images and try to take a look, so Dr. Frakes opens up the portal but when it collapses, creates such an energy burst that it knocks off the disguises on the Plantars, revealing their true frog identity to the doctor.

Chaos ensues as Dr. Frakes now has proof of the other worlds the portal can access and tries to kidnap the Plantars and dissect them. Terri, her assistant, thinks this is wrong and teams up with Anne to help the Plantars at the cost of her job.

Anne and Terri managed to save the Plantars, but Dr. Frakes chased after them with a buzzsaw in attempt to dissect them. Luckily Anne threw her Cicada Cookies at her which cause all the kids to attack her in order to get the cookies. 

The gang eventually escapes, and Terri takes them all home, suggesting that she will help them build a portal with everything she learned while working for Dr. Frakes.
