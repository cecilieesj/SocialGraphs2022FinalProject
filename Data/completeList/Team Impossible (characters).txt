'''Team Impossible''' is a team featured on ''[[Kim Possible]]''. Team Impossible are: Dash DaMont, Crash Cranston, and Burn Berman.

==History==
They were the world's premier team of high-danger operatives, regularly being hired to carry out dangerous missions for a fee, until a request for their aid was accidentally sent to [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]'s newly-established web site as a result of a typo. As a result, Kim began her own heroic career, attracting more attention and interest from the public, at least partially due to how, unlike Team Impossible, she didn't charge money for her missions. Team Impossible (consisting of Burn Berman, Crash Cranston, and Dash DaMont) was content for a while to let her have some fun, presumably expecting her to either burn out or be critically wounded at some point. However, it eventually went on for too long and cut their profits to nearly nothing, prompting Team Impossible to finally confront her and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] about it and take matters into their own hands.

Having failed to convince Kim and Ron to "retire", Team Impossible instead chose a more indirect method of rendering Kim ineffective. Tracking down every member of the "favor network" (people who Kim and Ron had helped on previous missions who would subsequently give them lifts to their next missions), Team Impossible relocated every person willing to give Kim and Ron rides to their headquarters, giving them an indefinite (and all-expenses-paid) "vacation" until Kim and the rest of her team were ultimately forced to quit--Team Impossible even went so far as to send a virus to crash Wade's computer system when he tried tracking them.

Fortunately, Kim and Ron were able to track them down by sending a fake request for their assistance to Team Impossible's web site, allowing them to travel directly to the base, followed by Wade who left his room for the first time since Kim and Ron have known him. Wade traps the men in a laser security grid just like during Kim and Ron's first mission, and Team Impossible were completely stumped on what to do. Kim, on the other hand, was able to save them, herself, Wade, Ron and Rufus just as flawlessly as she had saved Mr. Paisley and Mr. McHenry, making Team Impossible look like amateurs.

Afterwards, Team Impossible realized two things:
*1.) "It was actually ''possible'' that Team '''Im'''possible could've been fried."
*2.) The idea of a high school cheerleader (and her team) saving the world didn't seem so silly to them now.
Later, while at Bueno Nacho, [[Team Possible]] convinces Team Impossible to go "nonprofit" by joining Global Justice. Though Team Impossible were hesitant to take the offer, a subtle threat from Wade gets them to quickly consentâ€”which Burn informs his teammates has some tax benefits. Subsequently, Kim enlists Burn's help in helping her father with his taxes. They have not been reported in activity since then.

Prior to their appearance in the show, they were mentioned in the "Past" segment of ''[[Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time]]''. [[Mr. McHenry]] suggests using Team Impossible to help them turn off the lasers since this is what they trained for. He then went to access their website; however as he was forced to use his toe, Mr. McHenry mistyped when he did this, typing in Kim's website rather than Team Impossible's.
