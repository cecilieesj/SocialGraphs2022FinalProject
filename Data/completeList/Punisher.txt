The '''Punisher''' (real name '''Frank Castle, Sr.''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who is a brutal and ruthless vigilante who stops at nothing on his war on crime.

Punisher was created by Gerry Conway, John Romita Sr., Frank Giacoia, Dave Hunt, and Ross Andru.

==Background==
===Personality===
Frank is a man who sees the world in pure black and white terms and believes that the only way to keep the streets safe is to kill dangerous criminals (Murderers, pedophiles, rapists, psychs, sadists, terrorists, poachers, drug dealers, mob bosses and drug lords etc) so they don't harm innocents again. However despite this he doesn’t kill thieves or bank robbers unless they murder someone. When his wife, son, and daughter were murdered, a devastated Frank turned into a violent almost sociopathic individual, determined to kill every single criminal who had a hand in his family's death. When dealing with criminals, he is brutal, cold, and efficient.

Despite this though, Frank greatly values the lives of innocents, and will do his absolute best to make sure that civilians are not harmed, as shown when he went to the hospital looking for Grotto and made sure not to harm any patients or doctors or Karen Page. Frank upholds an honor code of "One Shot, One Kill", getting the job done as quickly as possible, whilst trying to avoid any collateral damage. He also avoided killing Daredevil, and when presented with the chance to kill him, Frank simply resorted to knocking him out.

Despite his cold and ruthless demeanor, beneath it all, Frank is a man who strongly and deeply misses his beloved family, and wishes only to make up for what he sees as his inability to protect them. Frank also appears to believe in returning favors, since him helping Daredevil defeat the Hand ninjas can be seen as him repaying the vigilante for rescuing him from torture at the hands of the Kitchen Irish. One positive trait is that he can make pleasant conversation with people he trusts and is fond of, showing that despite his brutal and ruthlessness nature, he still has a heart and soul of a human being.
