'''Bullseye''' (real name '''Benjamin''' "'''Dex'''" '''Poindexter''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', played by Wilson Bethel.

He is a hitman, mercenary, and assassin that often allies with the top crime bosses of the criminal underworld. Not only is he a remarkable marksman, but in his hands, anything is a weapon, and he almost never misses, hence his supervillain codename.

[[Kingpin]] had him incriminate [[Daredevil]], and for a considerable amount of time Bullseye acts as both Kingpin's main enforcer and Kingpin's inside man on the FBI. In the end, Daredevil manages to defeat Bullseye.

Bullseye's supervillain costume resembles that of Daredevil, helping him sully Daredevil's reputation.

Due to the show being cancelled, it is unknown if he was affected by [[Thanos]]' fingersnap.

Bullseye was created by Marv Wolfman, Klaus Janson and Bob Brown.
