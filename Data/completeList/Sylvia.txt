'''Sylvia''' is [[Wander]]'s loyal and bullish steed and the deuteragonist in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Sylvia is Wander's best friend, trusty steed and devoted defender.''

===Personality===
Sylvia is obviously tough-as-nails and serious when it comes to dealing with bad guys, especially Lord Hater and his watchdogs. She sometimes get annoyed with Wander when he messes up their plans by being helpful to others or making her do something that is not her style. But deep down, she's Wander's biggest fan, always there for him whenever he heads into trouble or danger and cares very deeply about him. This caring is extremely shown in "[[The Pet]]" where she cries when she believes that Wander was killed by the spider-like creature (but what she saw was really the remains of a teddy bear Wander gave to "Captain Tim") and mourns deeply for him as she leaves, until she sees him alive and well and rushes back to rescue him. Afterwards she gives Wander a hug and smiles, clearly relieved that her best friend is all right.

===Physical appearance===
Sylvia bears blue scales, has a long neck, stubby arms, big expressive eyes, and large two toed feet. While her pupils are typically black, in "The Stray", she is shown to have blue irises. She has a black rein wrapped around her muzzle and a big floppy tuft of red hair jutting upward from her head, matching the tuft of fur on the tip of her tail.

==Songs Sylvia has sung==
===Season 1===
*[[Your Happy Birthday Song]]
*[[Inside Your Mind]]

===Season 2===
*That's How We'll Get Her
*Let's All Go Meet Dominator
*You're the Greatest

===Promotional===
*Later Hater
*Disney XD 2014 Summer Anthem

==Trivia==
*In an early render clip of the show back at Comic-Con 2012, Sylvia was shown with a pink mane, but in the show her fur color is blue.
*Sylvia's species is a "Zbornak," so named as a nod to Bea Arthur's character in The Golden Girls (Dorothy Zbornak)
*She dances like Snoopy of "Peanuts" fame in "The Greatest".
*Sylvia is the second Disney Heroine to have triplet brothers, the first being [[Merida]] from "[[Brave]]".
