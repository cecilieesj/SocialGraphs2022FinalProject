'''Wilbur''' is a Wombeast who lives in the Horrid Hills. On the outside, he looks scary and vicious, but on the inside, he's a clumsy and yet lonely critter who has no family and loves apples. He appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[Great Aunt-Venture]]".

==Role in the series==
[[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and [[Aunt Tilly]] first met Wilbur on unfriendly terms when he came out of nowhere and stole the apples they'd picked for an apple pie. Using the Locus Pocus Map, Sofia and Aunt Tilly find him in the Horrid Hills. Sofia's magical [[Amulet of Avalor|Amulet]] allows her to convince Wilbur to give back their apples and understand that he's all alone with no family. After befriending Wilbur, Sofia and Aunt Tilly secretly invite him to their family dinner, and they have some of Aunt Tilly's special apple pie.
