Humaira attends the Eid Al-Adha festival, held by their local mosque and is amongst the company of her friends, who [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]] dubs the "Illumin-Aunties", a group of women who are in the know all regarding local business and affairs. [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] joins the group in conversation, and when the evening arrives she inquires about her great-grandmother, Aisha, to the fellow aunties. Zara mentions her family knew her, and Humaira adds that many people did. When they mention the shame she brought to her family, Kamala asks for further explanation, and Humaira mentions that her father referred to Aisha as a snake who put a curse on everything she touched. Zara talks of a possible affair, and Humaira adds on she was rumored to have had multiple affairs, alongside a secret family. [[Auntie Ruby|Ruby]] states that she heard that Aisha killed a man during the Partition, to Humaira's shock. In the midst of their conversation, Humaira and the others are alerted to the screams of a young boy, and find that he is hanging by a curtain attached to a rail, from the window of the mosque tower. She and the others in attendance, rush in the young boy's direction. A young masked heroine, dubbed "Night Light" appears and Humaira witnesses her create energy platforms in the air, and walk in young [[Hameed]]'s direction. He falls before she can reach him, but the she creates a construct in the middle of the air, which the boy lands on. The heroine runs over to him, causing Haumaira and the others to cheer, at his rescue. She and the others celebrates his safety, but before he can climb off the platform and onto the roof, it shatters, and Humaira looks in horror, as the boy falls onto the hood of a car, with his impact slightly broken by constructs that Night Light created.
