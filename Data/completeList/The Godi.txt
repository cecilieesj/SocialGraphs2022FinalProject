==Role in the Film==
The Godi didn't trust [[Professor Ivarsson]], [[Sir Anthony Ross]] or his son [[Donald Ross]]. To protect Astragard, he wanted them killed immediately but they escaped from the burning at the stake, so the Godi setted up a search party to kill them. He shot a flaming arrow at the Hyperion where the gang were but they escaped and the burning [[Hyperion Airship| Hyperion]] crashed down on the Godi, killing him.
