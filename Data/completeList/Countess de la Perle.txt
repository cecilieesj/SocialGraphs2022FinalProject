The '''Countess de la Perle''' is an offscreen character that [[Lumiere]] and [[Cogsworth]] alluded to in Issue 11 of the [[Marvel Comics]] serial for Disney's [[Beauty and the Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beauty and the Beast]].

==Background==
At an unknown point prior to the [[Enchantress]]' curse on [[Beast|the Prince]], the Countess de la Perle paid a visit to [[Beast's Castle|the castle]] for dinner. She ate seconds of everything, although when she was preparing to eat Lumiere's bisque de homard à la citronnelle, her giving a deep breath resulted in her pearls exploding violently outward, landing in the soup. Lumiere then immediately took the soup and replaced it with another to save the countess from an embarrassing incident, and then had the pearls returned by Lumiere who worked on repairing it all night, with the countess expressing thanks to him and saying he was the best maître d' in France. However, Cogsworth claimed he was the one who did Lumiere's actions when Lumiere recounted the event, and also inferred that it was actually rubies instead of pearls..

==Trivia==
*The Countess de la Perle was a character who briefly appeared in a flashback in Issue 11, as an indication of what castle life was like prior to the curse.
*The Countess de la Perle's name is a pun on the fact that she frequently wore pearls.
