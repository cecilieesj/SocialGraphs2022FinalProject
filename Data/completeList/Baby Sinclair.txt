'''Baby Sinclair''' is one of the main characters of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[1991]]-[[1994]] television series, ''[[Dinosaurs]]''.

==Background==
As a hand puppet creation and the smallest member of the show's core regular cast, the character was performed by [[Kevin Clash]], with the eyes operated by [[John Kennedy]] and the arms by [[Terri Hardin]] (replaced by [[Julianne Buescher]] for the final season). [[Kevin Clash]]'s voice for Baby Sinclair at times resembled a more gleefully destructive version of [[w:c:muppet:Elmo|Elmo]] from ''[[wikipedia:Sesame Street|Sesame Street]]''.

==Role in the [[Dinosaurs|series]]==
Baby Sinclair is the youngest member of the Sinclair family in the television series ''Dinosaurs''.

Newly hatched in the premiere episode, "[[The Mighty Megalosaurus]]", Baby Sinclair is precocious, if bratty, greedy, spoiled, ruthless, selfish, nosy, violent, and whiny child. His catchphrases include "I'm the baby, gotta love me!" and "Not the mama!". The latter is often uttered to his father, [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl Sinclair]], whom the baby repeatedly batters with a frying pan and generally disdains, especially in the early episodes. Despite this, he does genuinely love his father and they form a slightly warmer relationship over time. The baby's relationship with his mother, [[Frances Sinclair|Fran Sinclair]], is more stable and mutually affectionate, but the dinosaur child's wisecracks are also aimed at siblings, [[Robert Mark Sinclair|Robbie]] and [[Charlene Sinclair|Charlene]]. [[Ethyl Phillips|Grandmother Ethyl]] often reads to the child, the pair both rejoicing in Earl's many blunders. Also, Baby Sinclair is quite intelligent, being able to speak and spell at a very young age, still, however being unable to learn hardly anything valuable through every episode, just like his father. Never formally named until near the end of the second season, the infant Sinclair is briefly named "Aaah Aagh I'm Dying You Idiot", the result of the then-[[The Chief Elder|Chief Elder]] keeling over during the official christening. By the episode's end, he is legally named "Baby Sinclair".

The episode, "[[Out of the Frying Pan]]", featured an adult version of Baby Sinclair (voiced by [[Jason Alexander]]) on a talk show when Fran starts having a nightmare about Baby Sinclair's future education and realizes the mistake she has made.

Baby Sinclair celebrates his first birthday in "[[Switched at Birth (Dinosaurs episode)|Switched at Birth]]". He celebrates his second birthday in "[[Terrible Twos]]", where he enters a stage called the "terrible twos", causing him to display demonic behavior during the year that he is 2-years-old. The Sinclairs finally get him back to normal by tricking Baby into thinking he is 3-years-old.

Baby Sinclair was also the most heavily-marketed of the show's characters, appearing in assorted toys, Happy Meal prizes, and the music video, "[[I'm the Baby (Gotta Love Me)]]". He was featured on the box art of most ''Dinosaurs'' video releases and he was the only character to appear outside of the series, serving as a co-host on the special, ''[[For Our Children]]''.

==Trivia==
*Baby Sinclair was featured in the promotion for ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''.
