'''Wynnchel and Duncan''' are minor antagonists in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2012]] animated feature film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''. They are two doughnut security officers that served as [[King Candy]]'s henchmen during his reign over ''[[Sugar Rush]]''.

==Background==
Wynnchel and Duncan are non-playable characters from the [[Litwak's Arcade]] video game ''[[Sugar Rush]]''. They are programmed to act as security guards to [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Princess Vanellope von Schweetz]]. When ''Sugar Rush'' was hijacked by [[King Candy|Turbo]], Wynnchel and Duncan were reprogrammed to serve as King Candy's subordinates. With no recollection of their past or Vanellope's status as their princess, the duo were fiercely loyal to King Candy and his goal to keep Vanellope from racing on account of being a "glitch".

To carry out King Candy's orders, Wynnchel and Duncan were equipped with numerous weapons and resources that could be used against rabble-rousers (such as TASERs, batons, and the Devil Dogs). Rather than go-karts, the doughnuts operated on mopeds modeled after the [[Royal Racer]].

Despite King Candy's trust in them, however, they are rather pathetic at their job, and often fail their tasks due to their incompetence and weak-will. They are also quite cowardly and pretentious; when [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]] first appeared on the racetrack covered in taffy, Wynnchel and Duncan cowered in fear, until Ralph inadvertently trapped himself in a giant cupcake. Wynnchel and Duncan then proceeded to pompously attack him. While they are not particularly villainous, they are malicious in that they enjoy inflicting pain onto others, making them borderline ruthless and corrupt.

===Official Description===
:''Wynnchel and Duncan are [[King Candy]]'s muscle, ensuring order in the [[Sugar Rush]] community. Just don't make 'em mad or their frosting might melt.''

<tabber>Wynnchel=
'''Wynnchel''' (voiced by [[Adam Carolla]]) is a tall and slender, brown éclair. His uniform consists of a police hat and sunglasses, black belt and boots and a golden star.

Wynnchel seems to have the higher rank of the duo, as he does most of the talking and orders Duncan around repeatedly. He has a sarcastic and somewhat churlish personality. Despite his negative traits, he is loyal and respectful toward his sovereign. When interacting with both King Candy and [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]] directly, Wynnchel removed his headwear, a universal sign of respect. When he asked Vanellope a question near the end of the film, he began with, "Pardon me for asking...", showing he can be courteous despite his short temper.
|-|Duncan=
'''Duncan''' (voiced by [[Horatio Sanz]]) is a short, stocky brown doughnut with white frosting and sprinkles for a mustache. His uniform consists of a police hat and sunglasses, black belt and boots and a golden star badge. He speaks with a thuggish Brooklyn-esque accent.

Compared to Wynnchel, Duncan is somewhat docile, flimsy and submissive. When tasked with a mission by King Candy, Duncan would often look to Wynnchel for guidance rather than acting immediately. Because of his lower ranking, he is sometimes given the brunt of the work between the two, such as when he was tasked with ripping Ralph from a giant cupcake. Like Wynnchel, Duncan genuinely cares for his sovereign (as seen when King Candy was glazed) but he is somewhat less cordial, as he spoke casually with Vanellope even after discovering that she is their princess.

When [[Vanellope von Schweetz]], a young girl who was banned from racing in ''Sugar Rush'' because she's a glitch, weasels her way into the Random Roster Race, Wynnchel and Duncan are called forth to arrest her, but a taffy monster interferes and scares the donuts away. The distraction allows Vanellope to escape, while the taffy monster gets itself stuck in a giant cupcake, allowing Wynnchel and Duncan to capture it and take it to King Candy. There, the monster is revealed to be Wreck-It Ralph, who was looking for his medal that Vanellope stole. King Candy tells him that it's impossible to retrieve his medal because she deposited it in the codes along with the other gold coins, which now allows her to race. Wynnchel and Duncan are then ordered to escort Ralph out of ''Sugar Rush'', but Ralph escapes and searches for racers to win back his medal.

Later on, Wynnchel, Duncan, and King Candy head to the kart factory where Vanellope and Ralph have broken in to make a kart. On their motorcycles, Wynnchel and Duncan chase Ralph and Vanellope down, but they lose them. King Candy orders the duo to continue searching, but after a while, Wynnchel and Duncan return to the castle to inform the king that they've failed and King Candy ordered them to leave.

During the climax, Duncan can be spotted escaping ''Sugar Rush'' during the [[Cy-Bugs|Cy-Bug]] invasion caused by Ralph accidentally bringing a Cy-Bug from ''Hero's Duty'' into ''Sugar Rush''. Thanks to Ralph, the Cy-Bugs were defeated, as was King Candy, who turned out to be a rogue video game character who dominated ''Sugar Rush'', dethroning Vanellope who is the game's true ruler. Fortunately, Vanellope is revealed to be the "Princess of ''Sugar Rush''", but decides to make herself president instead. Wynnchel and Duncan then gladly return to Vanellope's side as her security guards.

Wynnchel and Duncan have a final appearance during the end-credits sequence; apparently participating in game-jumping adventures like the lead characters, the duo is glimpsed running from Cyril the Zombie (with a few more zombies) chasing them.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
Wynnchel and Duncan return in the sequel. When ''Sugar Rush'' gets unplugged, they rush to [[Game Central Station]]—trampling over the [[Surge Protector]] as they do—where they're reduced to sobbing messes at the loss of their home.

===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===
Wynnchel and Duncan make an appearance in the film as members of [[Toontown]]'s police department.

==Printed material==
===''The Donut Kart''===
In this comic, Wynnchel and Duncan find that their mopeds are unable to keep up with the speed of the [[Sugar Rush Racers|racers]]' karts. This makes it difficult to maintain the law, as the racers take advantage of the problem by breaking the speed limit. Wynnchel and Duncan consult President Vanellope for help, who takes the two to the kart bakery factory to create a massive new vehicle. Wynnchel and Duncan use this monstrous vehicle to "scare the racers straight".

==Trivia==
*The names "Wynnchel" and "Duncan" are both puns for the '''Winchell's''' and '''Dunkin'<nowiki/>''' chains of donut shops.
**Additionally, Wynchel is an éclair, which is more common in the western US, while Duncan is a "sugar ring", which is more popular in the eastern US.
*Wynnchel and Duncan are also a joke on the connection of policemen's affinity with donuts, as well as being stereotypes of corrupt police officers.
*There are a few very brief scenes in the film where the duo's eyes are visible.
*Their badges read "To heat and serve", a play-on "To protect and serve".
