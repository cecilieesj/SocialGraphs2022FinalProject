After Kion uses the [[Roar of the Elders]]  on [[Baliyo]], Rani forbids him and his friends from entering the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. But after speaking with Queen [[Janna]] and the spirits of her parents, Rani agrees to welcome the [[Lion Guard]] to the Tree of Life.

Later, Makucha and the others come back again and the Night Pride fights them. During the battle, Baliyo gets bitten by Ora, making him unable to fight. Luckily, Kion arrives in time to help.  Rani then sends Surak to make sure Ora leaves the Tree of Life while she and Kion go to stop the rest of the predator's.  Together with the rest of the Lion Guard, they are able to drive them away from the Tree of Life.

Afterwards, Mama Binturong attacks Bunga and [[Binga]] just as Surak and the Night Pride notice the ambush.

Soon, as Queen Janna dies of old age after telling Rani that the Night Pride will help Rani protect the Tree in the future, Surak, Kion, the Night Pride, and the rest of the animals mourn for her death.

The groups eventually fend off the villains. Afterwards, Kion offers to have the Lion Guard patrol the Tree of Life during the day so the Night Pride can rest. Mama Binturong, unbeknownst to the group, spies on the conversation.

When Ullu warns the Lion Guard and the Night Pride about Makucha's Army ambushing the Tree, the two groups fight off the villains thanks to Kion's leadership.

==="[[Triumph of the Roar]]"===
When Makucha's Army arrives at the Tree of Life with Ullu asleep (due to her being a nocturnal owl), Surak and the Night Pride plan to confront them only for the Lion Guard to help them defeat them.

When Ullu warns the Night Pride about the ambush, they rush to the Tree of Life to warn Rani about this only for them to be trapped by a giant rock blocking the Tree (caused by Ora and the Komodo dragons) just as the army attacks the animals of the Tree of Life. After mastering the roar, Kion, Bunga, and Rani arrive to stop them. Kion uses the Roar to defeat Makucha and the rest of his army and destroy the rock blocking the Tree to rescue the Night Pride.

==="[[Return to the Pride Lands]]"===
After letting go of the Roar and handing it over to the new Lion Guard's leader [[Vitani]], (which grants him full mastery of the Roar in the process) Kion asks the Guard if they would like to switch to being protectors of the Tree of Life. They all agree and head back to the tree. With all of Kion's family and friends watching him, Kion becomes Rani's new king.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====[[Janna]]====

Surak is Janna's youngest son. He was very saddened when his mother ended her journey in the Circle of Life.

====[[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]]====

Rani is Surak's niece, leader, and eventually his queen after the passing of Janna. He follows her lead without question and always offers sound counsel and support.

====[[Baliyo]]====

Baliyo is Surak's nephew and tries to keep Baliyo from acting rash. They are close and fight well together in their duty to protect the Tree of Life. Upon the passing of Janna, Surak comforted his nephew as they shared in their mourning.

====[[Kion]]====
Initially, Surak thought Kion and his Lion Guard were hostile animals attacking the Tree of Life, though Surak was intrigued by Kion's Roar, correctly suspecting it to be the Roar of the Elders. After Janna requested Rani to bring the visitors to her, Surak was surprised by how the Lion Guard cleared the mountain passage but didn't venture any closer.

Surak came to respect Kion and see him as a fierce warrior and a worthy leader, especially after Kion banished  Makucha's Army from the Tree of Life using his newfound mastery over the Roar. It wasn't long after that Kion would join Surak's family as his nephew-in-law by Kion's marriage to Rani, making him Surak's king.

===Friends===
====[[Nirmala]]====

Nirmala and Surak are often seen together and fight side by side in their duty to protect the Tree of Life.

====[[Ullu]]====

Surak and Uluu are good friends. Ullu works together with the Night Pride.

====[[Bunga]], [[Fuli]], [[Beshte]], [[Ono]], and [[Anga]]====

Surak becomes good friends with all of the members of the Lion Guard. They soon all join the Night Pride when Kion becomes his nieces mate.

====[[Makini]]====

Makini and Surak are good friends.

===Enemies===
====[[Makucha's Army]]====
Surak hates Makucha's Army since they tried to eat the animals in the Tree of Life.

==Trivia==
* It's possible that [[Nirmala]] and Surak could be mates, but unconfirmed.
* Though Surak is the uncle of Baliyo and Rani, they never call him "Uncle Surak."
* Surak is a foil to [[Scar]]. Unlike him, Surak is a loving and supportive uncle to Rani and Baliyo (and quite possibly had a healthy sibling relationship with his older sibling). He harbors no hateful envy towards Rani for her role as the next ruler of the Tree of Life as well as no desire for the title himself, content with his role in the Circle of Life.
