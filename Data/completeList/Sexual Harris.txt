{{Quote||explaining how he got his nickname}}

'''Al "Sexual" Harris''' is the lascivious field foreman in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_213:_What_%22Sexual%22_Harris_Meant What "Sexual Harris" Meant]".

Al invented innuendo, much to the dismay of [[Monica DeVertebrae]], whom he fired for rejecting his advances and refusing to date him. The case results in the "Sexual Harris" hearings before the [[WESAYSO]] board of executives.

He was voiced by [[Jason Alexander]] with [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Tate Jack Tate] puppeteering the body andÂ [[Bruce Lanoil]] manipulating the face.
