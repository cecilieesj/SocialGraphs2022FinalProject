The '''Etch A Sketch''' (or simply known as '''Etch''') is a character from the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]] introduced in the first ''[[Toy Story]]'' film. It is a magic art screen pad based on the toy of the same name who was one of Andy's toys.

==Background==
Etch is an anthropomorphic Etch A Sketch serving as one of Andy's toys. As it is a sentient screen pad, it is able to draw pictures very quickly such as portraits of [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Woody]], or [[Al McWhiggin]], and even semi-complicated maps. Etch is only able to move around by waddling unlike other toys who walk normally. It is often seen on Andy's toy box but on rare occasions, it can be seen on top of Andy's bookshelf.

==Appearances==

===''[[Toy Story]]''===
Etch is first seen when [[Woody]] interacts with it for the first time and when Woody tells it to draw, Etch draws a picture of a gun on its screen very quickly and after Etch draws it, Woody describes it having the "fastest knobs in the west", even though [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s [[Mrs. Davis|mother]] wanted to have their party early before they move to a new house. Later when [[Hamm]] alerts the other toys about the birthday guests arriving, Etch and every other toy except Woody scattered around and reached the window to see the gifts the guests are holding. Later, Etch watches in amazement when [[Buzz Lightyear]] was introduced to the rest of Andy's toys where they observe Buzz's actions.

Later, Woody saw Etch doing a drawing for Buzz just as he shook it to erase the drawing and then threw it inside. After Woody is troubled by the rest of Andy's toys for accidentally knocking Buzz off the window, [[Mr. Potato Head]] had Etch draw an image of a hangman noose which possibly proves that Etch was one of the many toys who confronted Woody who saw him being guilty of knocking Buzz off the window. Though Etch made infrequent appearances throughout the film, it was seen being packed away with the rest of the toys along with [[RC]], [[Sarge]], and the [[Green Army Men]]. However, when Woody attempted to save Buzz with RC, Etch attacked him, along with the other toys as they attempt to throw Woody out of the truck after thinking that Woody is an enemy to RC by knocking him out of the van. Later at the end of the film When Woody and Buzz reunite with Andy, Etch is seen celebrating Christmas with the rest of the other toys listening to Sarge about Andy's Christmas presents.

===''[[Toy Story 2]]''===
Etch first appears in the film where it helps Woody find his hat along with the rest of Andy's toys. During a yard sale started by the Davis family, Etch and the rest of the toys reacted in fear that they would be sold. After Woody was taken away by [[Al McWhiggin]], Wtch helped Buzz, Hamk, and the other toys draw an image of Al to give the toys a clue to help find Woody and rescue him, revealing that he is the one who works for [[Al's Toy Barn]]. Etch was later seen watching TV while [[Rex]] is changing through many TV channels to find Al's Toy Barn, the location where Woody was kidnapped, and then Etch drew a map of how to get there, leading the toys to find a way to get to the store

After the toys returned to Andy's home from their mission to find Woody, they were waiting for Woody to return home and the toys used Etch to welcome Andy back home. Etch was later seen listening with the other toys with [[Wheezy]] singing "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]" at the end of the film.

===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Etch only appears during flashbacks at the beginning of the film in one of Andy's home videos. It was then revealed that Etch was sold during the events between the second and third film along with [[Wheezy]] and [[Bo Peep]].

===[[Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin|Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters]]===
In the [[Disneyland]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] versions of the queue, Etch is seen during a demonstration sequence of Buzz Lightyear telling guests a plan to board on a spaceship and help defeat the Evil [[Emperor Zurg]] on a mission. As Buzz narrates a strategy to help defeat Zurg in battle, Etch draws various images relating to what Buzz is saying to help guests team up with Buzz and defeat Zurg just before guests board on their vehicles to help Buzz fight against Zurg.

==Trivia==
*It is unconfirmed if the Etch A Sketch seen in the ''Toy Story'' franchise is a 1960s or 1970s version of the toy.
