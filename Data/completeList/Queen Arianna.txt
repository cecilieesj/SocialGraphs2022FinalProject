'''Queen Arianna''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2010]] animated feature film, ''[[Tangled]]'' and a supporting character in its [[Tangled: The Series|spin-off series]]. She is the mother of [[Rapunzel]], the wife of [[King Frederic]], and the queen of [[Corona]].

==Background==
{{Quote|Rapunzel, before I met your father, I was so much like you. I had no idea what I was supposed to do in this world. So I went out and found my own way.|Arianna to Rapunzel}}
Arianna was the first born daughter of the previous King of Corona and older sister of [[Willow]]. At a young age, she was very much like her daughter in that she felt lost in the world and longed to find her calling. During this time, she lived her life as an adventurer, exploring remote continents, besting violent storms, and helping local villagers restore their worn homes. Also her and her sister Willow competed in the Contest of the Crowns and won. Eventually, she became Queen of Corona and would marry Frederic, who became King Consort of Corona.

===Personality===
In ''Tangled'', Arianna is shown to love her daughter and her husband dearly: when Rapunzel is born, she smiles adoringly, cuddling and picking her up. She mourns on the day of the lantern festival, as Frederic gently touches her face when she cries. She is also shown to be very accepting, immediately welcoming [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] into the royal family upon realizing he was partially responsible for her daughter's return.

Arianna's personality is slightly expanded in ''Tangled: Before Ever After'', where her loving and supportive nature is emphasized by her way of raising Rapunzel — especially compared to her husband. Unlike the paranoid Frederic, who fears for Rapunzel's safety nearly every waking moment, Arianna simply relishes having a complete family once more. She also sympathizes with Rapunzel's longing to learn more about the world and herself and encourages her to do just that. Gentle and soft-spoken, Arianna quickly established herself as someone Rapunzel can confide in during times of uncertainty.

Regarding Rapunzel and Frederic's somewhat strained relationship, Arianna advises Frederic to lower his defenses and trust that their daughter will prevail as a wise ruler when her time comes. She openly believes that teenagers are a rather complex age group that requires patience and understanding from the parent to properly develop; this would explain why her methods of raising Rapunzel are considerably less controversial compared to her husband, even though they both love their daughter immensely.

It is shown later that she and Rapunzel have developed a deep mother-daughter bond. In "[[Fitzherbert P.I.]], Arianna gave motherly wisdom about how Rapunzel should best portray herself in her royal portrait, explaining that people aren't defined by what they can do, but by who they are and the people they love; in response, Rapunzel painted the portrait, herself, which depicted the princess with her mother.

===Physical appearance===
Arianna bears a striking resemblance to her daughter; near-identical, bright green eyes with similar facial features. She, along with Frederic, also shares Rapunzel's brown hair (after it was cut). Arianna's hair almost reaches her waist. It is parted in the same way as Rapunzel's is, and the upper layer is tied back neatly in a sort of updo.

==Appearances==
===''[[Tangled]]''===
[[File:QueenOfCorona.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Queen Arianna with baby Rapunzel in ''Tangled''.]]
Arianna is more involved in the movie, even though she does not have a speaking role like her spouse, Frederic. She contracted an unknown illness while heavily pregnant with Rapunzel, and she was going to die, along with her child, from the illness. The guards, however, found the magical golden flower that, through a traditional medicinal method such as extracting a plant's essence by boiling it in water, fully healed her, which also successfully helped with the birth of Rapunzel. Mother Gothel snuck into the castle not long afterward to kidnap Rapunzel, who held the healing powers of the flower she believed were rightfully hers.

As a loving mother, Arianna along with the King was devastated to have her baby taken away to the point where the anniversary of Rapunzel's disappearance drove her to tears even eighteen years later. She and the King continued to hold the [[Lanterns|lantern]] festival to call their daughter home and were just as emotionally shaken as the day she disappeared. Arianna did not return to the scene until a guard came to report Rapunzel's return. Although she was not able to immediately recognise and embrace Rapunzel as her long-lost daughter upon first sight, Arianna's maternal instinct and striking resemblance to Rapunzel brought the family together immediately. As she, her husband, and Rapunzel sank to the ground in a powerful embrace, Arianna silently extended her hand to [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] in speechless gratitude. As he took it, she pulled him in to join them. She was last seen smiling and hugging Rapunzel and Frederic towards the end of the movie.

===''[[Tangled Ever After]]''===
Arianna has a brief appearance in ''[[Tangled Ever After]]''. In [[Maximus]]' dream sequence after he loses the rings, Arianna exclaims from the audience that the rings were her grandmother's. She also appears at the end, alongside Frederic, giving Maximus and [[Pascal]] a surprised look that they were both dirty and messy, and also smiling happily as her daughter is married.

===''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''===
[[File:Tangled-Before-Ever-After-100.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Queen Arianna in ''Tangled: Before Ever After''.]]
Arianna appears in the short film which takes place 6 months after the events of the original film. Arianna and Fredric are preparing for Rapunzel's upcoming coronation as a princess. After Rapunzel's golden hair returns, Arianna and Fredric want to have breakfast with their daughter to spend time with her. After not getting the chance, Arianna gives Rapunzel a journal that says "Plus en Vous", which means "there is more in you". On the day of Rapunzel's coronation, Arianna and the rest of Corona are under attack from [[Lady Caine]] and her minions. Queen Arianna and Fredric are almost taken away until Rapunzel, Eugene and others fight against Lady Caine, with Rapunzel using her returned golden hair.
====Season One ====
Arianna makes multiple appearances in the TV series, although she usually plays fairly minor roles. When focused upon, however, it is shown that Arianna is just as delighted as her husband to have Rapunzel in her life again, but not in a manner that has made her overprotective. Instead, she supports her daughter in all endeavors and looks to make up for the eighteen years worth of lost time by spending time with Rapunzel whenever she can. She trusts that her daughter can make her own choices and believes in her ability to accomplish her goals.

In "[[The Way of the Willow]]", it is revealed that Arianna has a younger sister named Wilhelmina (nicknamed "Willow"), who visits Corona in honor of her sister's birthday—despite having missed the previous six. Unfortunately, Willow's visit had cut into Arianna and Rapunzel's planned date to watch a meteor shower, which Arianna looked forward to as a chance to have some long-awaited quality time with her daughter. Tidbits on Arianna's past were also hinted at throughout the episode, such as the fact that — during her childhood — she had a somewhat crippling eagerness to impress those around her, which would result in her taking any dare that Willow threw her way; Arianna was notably embarrassed by this when Willow brought it up.

In the season one finale, Arianna tried to reason with her husband about him locking Rapunzel up in her bedroom tower was too extreme. When she couldn't change his mind, she visited her daughter and reminded her that her father was doing this because he cared.

Later she is kidnapped by [[Varian]], to use as bait to lure Rapunzel to [[Old Corona]], to cooperate in an attempt to free his father from the amber. Though visibly scared, she still attempted to get through to Varian and help him, urging him to not do this. Later when Varian caused the rocks near her to start growing amber, she remained calm and freed herself before the amber could encase her. A short time later she witnessed her daughter use the connection she had with the rocks to stop Varian once and for all.

==== Season Two====
In the second season, Arianna remains absent alongside Frederic since they continue to rule Corona while Rapunzel is on her journey to follow the Black Rocks that will lead her to her destiny.

[[File:Happiness Is... (11).jpg|right|250px|thumb|Rapunzel reunited with an illusion of Queen Arianna.]] 
In "[[Happiness Is...]]", Arianna makes a non-speaking role as she is one of the illusions Rapunzel sees when she begins to feel homesick and misses Corona along with her family and friends. Eventually, after Rapunzel manages to overcome and destroy the idol's power, she comes to terms with her homesickness and sends a letter back home to her parents who witness its arrival.

In "[[Rapunzeltopia]]", Arianna appears in Rapunzel's dreamworld as she relives her coronation weekend, but with alternate events to convince Rapunzel not to return to the real world. During the royal banquet, Arianna and Frederic watch with excitement and anticipation when Eugene proposes to Rapunzel for the first time and happily embrace each other when Rapunzel accepts. Arianna later goes to Rapunzel's room to give her the journal, but unlike the first time, Arianna assures Rapunzel that she doesn't have to worry about anything ever again and encourages her to be satisfied with the way things are.

====Season Three====
[[File:Rapunzel's Return (43).jpg|thumb|250px|Rapunzel reunited with an amnesiac Frederic and Arianna.|left]]
In the third season, Rapunzel and her friends return to Corona after learning the kingdom is in danger. In "[[Rapunzel's Return]]", Rapunzel is reunited with her parents but is shocked to learn they don't recognise her. Rapunzel discovers Varian and [[Andrew (Tangled)|Andrew]] have teamed up and manage to take control of the kingdom by using [[Separatists of Saporia|Saporian]] magic to erase Arianna and Frederic's memories, causing them to believe Varian is their trusted advisor. They are later taken to the outskirts of Corona to watch as Andrew and the Saporians destroy the kingdom but are successfully rescued by Eugene and Lance. In the aftermath, Rapunzel is appointed as acting Queen of Corona until her parents' memories return.

In "[[Beginnings]]", Arianna and Frederic appear in a flashback two years prior during the days when Rapunzel and Cassandra first became friends. Together, they inform Rapunzel of the upcoming Contest of Crowns in which princesses from the Seven Kingdoms come together to compete. They witness Rapunzel and Cassandra's participation and remain supportive of Rapunzel's efforts throughout the competition. It's also shown in the earlier days, Arianna and Frederic were still getting used to Eugene's presence within the castle and were unhappy whenever he spoke of his former past. However, Arianna was shown to be slightly more welcoming, compared to Frederic.

[[File:The King and Queen of Hearts (4).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rapunzel attempts to help her parents regain their memories.]]
In "[[The King and Queen of Hearts]]", Arianna and Frederic's memories remain lost despite Varian's efforts to undo the effects of the Saporian's magic memory wand. Rapunzel is determined to help her parents by reminding them of their love for each other during the Day of Hearts celebration since they proclaimed their love and wrote their names in [[King Herz Der Sonne's Journal|King Herz Der Sonne's journal]]. However, Arianna and Frederic's amnesia prevents them from remembering why they even love each other. Due to their strong differences with Arianna seeking adventure and excitement in her life and Frederic only caring about his egg collection, Arianna believes it's best if they spend some time apart to figure out their feelings. Refusing to give up and determined to get her parents back together, Rapunzel plans a romantic date to make her parents fall in love again with the help of her friends. Rapunzel brings Arianna out into the forest to go riding together, but secretly brings her to Frederic to set their date into motion.

[[File:The King and Queen of Hearts (9).jpg|left|250px|thumb|Arianna and Frederic go horseback riding.]]
Throughout Arianna and Frederic's date, Arianna expresses her strong adventurous spirit and shows off her talents for horseback riding, but unfortunately, Frederic is not and falls off while riding Maximus, unable to keep pace with her. They later go to [[The Snuggly Duckling|the Snuggly Duckling]], but Frederic bores Arianna with his love for eggs and soon a brawl occurs with Arianna joining them and fighting against [[Vladimir]]. Finally, during a romantic boat ride together, Arianna and Frederic's love once again begins to blossom as they express their wish to remember more of Rapunzel and acknowledge each other's positive qualities in their daughter. Frederic and Arianna almost kiss, until their moment is interrupted upon the arrival of [[King Trevor]]. It's revealed in the past, Trevor and Frederic were also rivals for Arianna's love until she chose Frederic, causing Trevor to remain obsessed for years. However, upon learning of their recent amnesia, Trevor intends to take advantage of their memory loss to win Arianna's affections for himself once and for all and invites her to go sea serpent watching the following day which she gladly accepts.

[[File:The King and Queen of Hearts (31).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Arianna saves Frederic.]]
The next day during their outing together, Trevor presents Arianna with a rare sea crystal and asks her to become his queen, believing they are a better match than her and Frederic. However, Arianna expresses her love for Frederic, finding him fascinating, but Trevor intends to win her heart through a grand romantic gesture and reveals he has in his possession Herz Der Sonne's journal and asks her to sign it with him. Arianna tries to refuse Trevor's affections until they notice Rapunzel and the group following them. Trevor sends out his "Navy Seals" to attack Rapunzel and the group, but seeing her daughter in danger, Arianna knocks out Trevor and goes to rescue Rapunzel. Arianna arrives in time to rescue the group and quickly dives into the water to save Frederic since he cannot swim. However, they find themselves captured by the sea serpent. Believing this is the end, Arianna and Frederic declare their love and kiss until they are rescued by Rapunzel before the creature can devour them.

[[File:The King and Queen of Hearts (20).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Frederic and Arianna embrace Rapunzel as their memories finally start to return.]]
Frederic ultimately saves the day when he realizes the sea serpent was after Trevor's sea crystal which is revealed to actually be the serpent's unhatched egg. Arianna embraces Frederic, impressed by his bravery in facing the sea serpent. Rapunzel and the group return to shore, but unfortunately, Herz Der Sonne's journal was destroyed, saddening Rapunzel since it contained precious memories for her parents. However, Arianna assures Rapunzel they can make new memories and is happy they are all safe and together. Inspired, Rapunzel creates a new Book of Hearts to symbolize the start of making new memories. Rapunzel and Eugene are the first to sign their names in the new book, and through their love, Arianna and Frederic's memories finally begin to slowly return.

Later, Arianna is among the citizens of Corona who surprise Eugene for his 26th birthday in "[[Cassandra's Revenge]]". She and Frederic are also shown to have become acquainted with Eugene's father, [[King Edmund]]. However, the surprise birthday is cut short when Cassandra arrives and demands Rapunzel to give her [[the Graphtic Scroll]]. Arianna and Frederic later witness the creation of [[Cassandra's Stronghold|Cassandra's fortress]].

In "[[Flynnposter]]", Arianna and Frederic meet with the Captain of the Guards who reveals his decision to retire, due to his unwillingness to once again battle Cassandra. Understanding and respecting his decision, Arianna and Frederic accept his retirement and show gratitude for his service to the crown. The Captain also announces his decision to appoint Eugene as his replacement which is greatly supported and encouraged by everyone.

In "[[Plus Est En Vous]]", after Cassandra has managed to conquer Corona, Rapunzel and Arianna visit the spot where the [[Sundrop Flower]] originally resided. Arianna begins to advise Rapunzel by revealing a previous fight between her and Willow in their youth, encouraging Rapunzel not to give her and to remind her that only she can get through to Cassandra. Arianna and Rapunzel return to the Snuggly Duckling and rally the others for a battle to retake Corona.

After charging into the castle, the citizens of Corona build a portal that was once used by Lord Demanitus to banish Zhan Tiri to the Lost Realm in the throne room; however, after the portal is assembled, Arianna is among the citizens of Corona who are accidentally sucked in through the portal to the realm, where she transforms into a rabbit. She and the others remain stuck until they are rescued by Quirin. Seconds later, the portal is crushed by debris from Zhan Tiri transforming into a demon, prompting Arianna to order everyone to evacuate the throne room. Arianna and Frederic then join the battle against Zhan Tiri, proclaiming that it's their fight as well, but Zhan Tiri encages Arianna, Frederic, and the others in Yellow Rocks and then chants the [[Healing Incantation|Decay Incantation]] to weaken everyone and plunge the kingdom into darkness. Following Zhan Tiri's defeat at the hands of Rapunzel and a redeemed Cassandra, Rapunzel chants the Healing Incantation to revive everyone, including her parents.

At the end of the series, Arianna is seen celebrating the true happily ever after alongside Frederic, Rapunzel, and Eugene.

== Trivia==
*Arianna was originally going to be voiced by [[Ashley Judd]] in ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]'', but this was changed later on.
*Queen Arianna's given name was from executive producer, [[Chris Sonnenburg]]'s, daughter, Arianna.<ref name="Tumblr">{{Cite web|url=http://forever-tangledup.tumblr.com/post/158747478762/look-at-these-adorable-tangled-the-series-fun|title=ForeverTangledUp Post|website=Tumblr|date=March 23. 2017}}</ref>
*Concept art of Queen Arianna inspired Cassandra from Tangled: The Series.
*In the original fairy tale of which ''Tangled'' is based on, Rapunzel's parents (who weren't royalty) lived next door to the witch and often admired how large her garden was. While Rapunzel's mother was pregnant Rapunzel's father snuck into the garden, stole some of the vegetables growing, and got caught. The witch let him go in exchange for the baby he and his wife were having. They're never seen after that.
*Queen Arianna and King Frederic do not speak in the 2010 film. This makes Arianna and Fredric the first parents of a Disney Princess to appear as silent characters.
