}}The '''Shark-Dermanator''' is a creature featured in the [[Disney XD]] series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''. This shark-like creature is one of [[Willem Viceroy]]'s earliest creations. Because its skin is so dry and flaky, it resides in [[Lake LaRusso]] to stay moisturized.

==Role in the series==
The Shark-Dermanator first appears in the episode "[[Flume-Igation]]". When [[Randy Cunningham]] destroys the McFlume water slide, the lake drains and the creature's skin dries up. Irritated by the constant itching of its dry skin, the Shark-Dermanator goes on a rampage through [[Norrisville]]. Randy uses the Robo-Ape life guard to plug the hole in the water slide, then sends the monster down the slide and back into the refilled lake.

The creature makes a minor appearance in "[[Debbie Meddle]]", where it grabs the Assassin Bot in its jaws.
