|quote = "Someone has asked what is new!"}}'''Mustafa''' is a waiter in ''[[Ratatouille]]''. In the film, a critic asks him who made the delicious soup (it was actually [[Remy]] who made it but [[Alfredo Linguini|Linguini]] got the credit). He is voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]].

==Role in the film==
Mustafa easily gets nervous when dealing with demanding customers and critics, trying his best to please them. When the customers ask if [[Alfredo Linguini|Linguini]] has anything new, Mustafa panics and tells the kitchen crew of the request. [[Chef Skinner]] is shocked to learn from Mustafa that the customers want food specifically from Linguini, so he, out of spite, deceives Linguini into cooking one of Gusteau's failed recipes. Fortunately, Remy improves it and Mustafa returns greatly excited. The customers love the food and now all want the same dish.

After Linguini discovers that he is Gusteau's son, he becomes head chef and fires Skinner. Mustafa, similar everybody else, likes this change of leadership, and gleefully participates in the burning down of all of the frozen foods that were going to be distributed in Gusteau's name. When [[Anton Ego]] arrives to test Linguini, Mustafa again gets nervous and finds himself at Ego's mercy, unable to understand the nature of Ego's dinner request. Ego gives up and insists that Linguini "hit him with his best shot."

Mustafa later discovers, along with everybody else, that Linguini is not the chef, but that [[Remy]] is. When Linguini suggests that they follow Remy instead, Mustafa believes that Linguini has gone nuts and leaves with the whole staff. It is unknown what he has moved on to since.

==Trivia==
* He is one of the least recognizable of [[John Ratzenberger]]'s roles due to being voiced in a French accent.
