==Biography==
From 1972's Country Bear Jamboree record album:

''Trixie is an old trouper, a veteran performer. There is nary a sourdough or grubstaker who doesnâ€™t recall her singing and dancing in the rip-roaring music halls of the western frontier. She has been known variously as The Calgary Charmer, Alaska Allurer, Vancouver Vamp, Bewitcher of British Columbia, and Tacoma Temptress. As did so many folks with good sense, she visited Florida and decided to stay. She is now known as The Tampa Temptation. She spends her spare hours thumbing through the pages of her scrapbook and is planning to write a book, "I Bearly Remember".''

In the Country Bears 2002 film, she is the bands keyboard player and was in a relationship with Tennesse O'Neal. When the band broke up she and Tennesse went off together. Tennessee says she met a a Rich Millionaire Real Estate panda and ran off with him but what really happened was he broke up with her. She ended up a lounge singer at a motel. She reunites with Tennesse and after singing a duet with him they rekindle their relationship.
