'''Wendy'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0399248/</ref> is a minor antagonist of [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]'s popular animated television series, ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.

In the episode, when Jeremy suggests to Candace that she take the job opening at [[Mr. Slushy Franchise|Mr. Slushy Burger]] so they can work side-by-side, Wendy suddenly steps in, offering to apply for the job, much to Candace's annoyance. But since there's only one opening, the manager suggests they compete to see who is a better choice for the job. For their first task, the two of them are supposed to dress some hot dogs with ketchup and mustard. But Candace and Wendy end up turning their contest into a food fight with both of them throwing the food dressing at each other, which results in both of them losing the job opening.

Interestingly, at the beginning of "[[Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)]]", Wendy is among the people Candace tries to call, asking to hang out; Candace mentions there that they shared a seat on the bus to the planetarium.

==Physical Appearance==
Wendy has short black hair that is kept back by a purple headband. She wears a purple dress over a shirt with a lighter shade of purple. Her dress shares similarity to Isabella's.   

==Relationships==
===Candace Flynn===
[[File:Showdown at the Slushy Dawg.jpg|thumb|250px|Wendy and Candace prepare to battle for the job position.]]
Candace was her opponent for the job position. But, as mentioned above, they did once sit together on the ride to the planetarium. Both are sort of having a 50-50 relationship with each other as friends.

In "[[Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)]]", Candace calls up a friend named Wendy. Whether or not she is the same girl cannot be determined, as Candace couldn't get a hold of her.

==Appearances==
*"[[Unfair Science Fair]]" (First appearance)
*"[[Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)]]" (Mentioned only)
*"[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]" (Cameo)
*"[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]" (Cameo)

==Trivia==
*[[Brenda Song]], who voices Wendy, and [[Ashley Tisdale]], who voices Candace, both starred together in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' where they both played each others best friend''.''
**In the ''Suite Life'' episode, "[[Nugget of History]]," [[London Tipton]] (Song) tries to get a job at the Cluck Bucket fast food restaurant where [[Maddie Fitzpatrick]] (Tisdale) already works. The resulting mess that Maddie and London left at the Cluck Bucket strongly resembles the disaster that Candace and Wendy brought to the Mr. Slushy Burger.
*Her name was not mentioned in the episode, but she was named in the end credits.
*Wendy resembles her voice actress Brenda Song since they both have dark skin and black hair.
*Brenda Song plays a similar character in ''Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior'', In this case, this character is probably based on Wendy, since they resemble each other, are competitive, and have the same first name.
