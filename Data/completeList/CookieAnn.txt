==Background==
===Story===
====[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]====
As Duffy was about to eat his cotton candy, he saw a mountain of waffles heading toward him! "Ahhh!" The waffles and his cotton candy flew through the air.

Cookie, the girl, caught his treat. ''Sniff, sniff'' "I have an idea! Try a cotton candy waffle sandwich!"

Duffy wasn't sure. "Is it...good?" "My nose knows!" "Wow, this is yummy!" Cookie was happy to share a new recipe with a new friend.

====Tokyo DisneySea====
Duffy first met CookieAnn when he was enjoying some delicious cotton candy. He accidentally bumped into her as she was carrying a huge stack of waffles, and all their treats flew into the air! Luckily, CookieAnn caught them, and turned the ingredients into a cotton candy waffle sandwich. The accident turned out to be a recipe for friendship!
