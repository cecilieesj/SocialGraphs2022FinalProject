'''Cotton''' is a character who appears in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]].

==Background==
Cotton was a pirate who operated in the Caribbean during the Age of Piracy, most notably during the mid-18th century. Little is known about his early life. Prior to joining the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', Cotton had his tongue cut out, due to an encounter with Mungard. He subsequently trained his loyal parrot to speak for him -- though how he achieved such a feat, as a mute, remains unknown. It's unknown what happened to him since ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'' but his parrot can be seen in the bottle where the Black Pearl was trapped at in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===
Cotton first appears in a motley crew where [[Jack Sparrow]] talks to him, but receives no response. [[Joshamee Gibbs]] explains that the reason why he is unable to talk is because his tongue was cut, so he had his pet parrot talk to him. Jack and the motley crew board the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'' and while onboard, Cotton and the other crewmen sailed during a storm until the crew arrives at [[Isla de Muerta]], where Jack Sparrow and [[Will Turner]] explored alone. During a battle between the ''Interceptor'' and the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', Cotton loaded cannons with everything of what is inside the ship to fight back against the ''Pearl''. Cotton survived the fight, but was later taken prisoner with the other crewmen. [[Elizabeth Swann]] managed to rescue him and the motley crew, but they refuse to help rescue Jack. However, the motley crew rescues Jack from the gallows.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
Years later, Jack ordered the motley crew to seek for land and avoid the [[Kraken]] summoned under command of [[Davy Jones]] by looking for land. The ''Pearl'' arrived at [[Pelegostos]] where the crew members of the ''Pearl'' were in bony cages, to which Cotton and several other crew members escape from the cannibalistic tribe with help from Will Turner. Furthermore, Cotton's parrot returned to his master as the motley crew escaped from Pelegostos with help from [[Pintel and Ragetti]].

Onboard the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', Cotton joined Jack's quest to find the Dead Man's Chest where the crew received advice from [[Tia Dalma]] in her shack and an offer from Davy Jones. Jack then arrived at [[Tortuga]] to settle the debt from Davy Jones in order to complete the offer, which lead to a battle with [[James Norrington]] who joined the crew. After surviving Isla Cruces, Cotton participates during battle against the Kraken to which Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, making Cotton one of the few survivors of the ''Pearl''.

Back with Tia Dalma, Cotton's parrot tells his master to go to World's End by finding Jack Sparrow and returning him from Davy Jones' Locker.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Cotton and the rest of Jack's crew arrive at Singapore, planning to steal the [[Mao Kun Map]] and acquire a ship and a crew. As Cotton's parrot remained with Tia Dalma on the streets of Singapore, Cotton and the other crew arrived at [[Sao Feng]]'s bath house. After taking out a boiler room attendant and tying up one of his assistants, Cotton controlled the steam controls. Later, a large group of EITC soldiers arrived and prepared to attack under orders of [[Ian Mercer]]. The crew manages to escape the ambush as the group boards a new ship, the ''Hai Peng''.

On board the ''Hai Peng'', Cotton and the crew reach World's End where he and the rest of the crew arrive at Davy Jones' Locker, where the ''Pearl'' was on a mountaintop carried by Tia Dalma's crabs and the crew finally reunites with Jack Sparrow who resumes his position as the captain. Finally reuniting with Jack and escaping from Davy Jones' Locker, the crew arrives on an island where the crew found out that the Kraken is already dead. During a mutiny on the island, Cotton was held hostage to which Sao Feng saw the ''Empress'' from a distance to which he, Tai Huang, and his men arrive on the ship. When Jack questioned when anyone came rescue him, Cotton raised his hand to which he agreed of what Jack questioned. He later attended the meeting at the Brethren Court with other members of Jack's crew.

When the EITC's ships arrive, Cotton's parrot flies away discovered the size of the fleet. He later participated in battle at the maelstrom where Cotton remained on the ''Pearl'', sailing past the ship. During battle, Cotton fought against some of Davy Jones' crewmen to which Cotton took the helm, but crashed onto the other ship. Cotton, however, survived, along with his parrot who reunited back to his master after Davy Jones was defeated. With Davy Jones defeated, the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Flying Dutchman'' Fire their cannons against the ''HMS Endeavour'', destroying the ship to which Cotton and the rest of the pirates celebrate their freedom from the EITC. Cotton later remained as a crewman, this time under Barbossa's command.

==Stranger's Tide==
Though he doesn't appear, Barbossa mention that the Black Pearl and almost everyone was said to have went down, but it's later reveal that the Pearl was placed in a bottle and his parrot is shown to be alive as well. It is unknown he was killed when the Pearl was attack before being shrunk or he survived.

==Trivia==
*Cotton speaks in the short film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Tales of the Code: Wedlocked|Tales of the Code: Wedlocked]]''. This short shows part of an encounter he has with Mungard, played by Christopher Rocha, in which Mungard shoots the pirate code when trying to shoot the Auctioneer and says he'll have the tongue of anyone who mentions him doing so. Cotton says "Mum's the word", but it can be inferred that he spoke about it and that is how he lost his tongue.
**This was the only known time Cotton has spoken.
*Cotton was originally gone to return in "[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]" where he was along with the [[Queen Anne's Revenge]] Crew who survived the attack on the of the [[Black Pearl]]. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbu5kwava6ar600/PotC5_Dead_Man_Tell_No_Tales_8.pdf?dl=0]
