}}'''Baby Cavenpuss '''is a character that was intended to be used in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, [[Milo Murphy's Law]]. It would have been voiced by [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] .

==Intended role==
He was originally going to be the result of [[Cavenpuss]] being shocked into laying an egg. He would have stayed with his father on the Octalians ship while [[Melissa]], [[Zack]], [[Cavendish]], [[Vinnie Dakota|&nbsp;Dakota]], [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doof]], [[Perry]], [[Loab]], and [[Diogee]]. He would later appear with Cavenpuss scaring the rest of the Octalians.
