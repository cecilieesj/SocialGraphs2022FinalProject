'''Professor Parenthesis''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' television episode "[[O.W.C.A. Files]]". He is an evil flea scientist bent on taking over O.W.C.A. with his own army of Mecha-Fleas to take control of all of O.W.C.A.'s agents to do his bidding for him. Unlike most evil-doers who are dealt with by the agents, he is clearly a more intelligent and dangerous villain, always putting on a few tricks up his sleeve.

He has a habit of mispronouncing words by putting emphasis on the wrong syllables.

==Physical appearance==
In his usual human appearance, Parenthesis has tan skin, blue eyes, and light yellow hair pointing upon his forehead. His head resembles that of a round bracket, hence his name. He wears a white lab coat with two light-green shoulder pads, green shorts, and pink slippers.

However, this appearance was nothing more than an android to conceal his true appearance: that of a tiny blue four-armed flea wearing a white shirt and pink slippers. Parenthesis' android is also capable of procuring four mechanical tentacles as back-up weapons and a giant LCD screen to show his true face to his enemies.
