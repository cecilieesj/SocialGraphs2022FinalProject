'''Steelbeak''' is a recurring antagonist from ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''. He is a member of the villainous organization [[F.O.W.L.]]

Steelbeak serves as the secondary antagonist, right behind [[Negaduck]]. He is the headlining antagonist under F.O.W.L. as a chief agent.

==Personality==
Steelbeak a is suave, smooth-talking, sarcastic, calm, collected, and very sharply dressed rooster. He is basically based on a 1920s gangster and Jaws from the ''{{WikipediaLink|James Bond}}'' series due to both having metallic teeth/beak which they use as weapons to cut through anything. He is seldom seen angered but has been seen to throw tantrums when his plans start to fail. Due to his high rank in the organization, F.O.W.L. Command allows him to do as he wishes and constantly back him regardless of any circumstances. Once when he wondered if he should disobey F.O.W.L Command, his mirror reflection reminds him of the fate of a previous F.O.W.L. Chief Agent who also disobeyed orders and who got put into six trash compactors.

==Appearances==
===''[[Darkwing Duck]]''===
He appears in numerous episodes of the series as a recurring antagonist.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
[[File:Steelbeak confident.png|left|thumb|250px|Steelbeak in the ''DuckTales'' reboot.]]
Steelbeak appears in the 2017 ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' series. Once again a F.O.W.L. agent, this version is depicted as significantly less intelligent than in ''Darkwing Duck'', yet still just as arrogant. He first appears at the end of "[[Moonvasion!]]" when the members of F.O.W.L. have a meeting after the invasion to focus their plans on taking out [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his family.

Steelbeak returns as the main antagonist of the episode "[[Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!]]". He works alongside [[Black Heron]] in a secret lair built under Funso's Fun Zone (since they thought Scrooge would never set foot in it) as she schemes to use a reversed intelligence ray to reduce [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s intelligence to zero. When Scrooge actually does enter the establishment to meet with his family, Steelbeak is ordered to get rid of them without arousing suspicion. However, he instead kidnaps Launchpad and [[Dewey]], much to Black Heron's dismay. Black Heron eventually reverses the intelligence ray, but Steelbeak, fed up with being treated like an inferior, betrays her by using it on her before plotting to use it on the entirety of [[Duckburg]] so that no one will ever mock his stupidity again. With the help of the [[Rescue Rangers]], Launchpad and Dewey break out of containment, but Steelbeak kidnaps Dewey and shoots Launchpad with the ray, accidentally making Launchpad intelligent. Launchpad pursues Steelbeak to a lighthouse, where Steelbeak prepares to use the modified ray on the city and battles him before the Rescue Rangers come along and help Launchpad subdue Steelbeak. Later, F.O.W.L. retrieves Steelbeak and reverts Black Heron's intelligence to normal.

While Steelbeak doesn't appear in the episode "[[Escape from the ImpossiBin!]]", he is mentioned by Darkwing Duck, revealing the he stole the Solego circuit plans for F.O.W.L.

In "[[The Split Sword of Swanstantine!]]", he is shown facing off against Huey Duck and [[Lena Sabrewing]] to gain the blade of Swanstantine. Only to lose the battle when Huey found his inner strength in controlling his emotions. He ends up retreating with the rest of F.O.W.L. but still found success in the mission by obtaining a single feather from one of the ducks. 

It is unknown what happened to Steelbeak and the other remaining F.O.W.L. agents following Bradford's defeat at the end of the series.

===Comics===
In the many ''Darkwing Duck'' comic stories that were published in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', Steelbeak made several appearances, including in the magazine's very first ''Darkwing'' story, "Let's Get Fiscal!"

In the 2010 ''Darkwing Duck'' comic series by [[Boom! Studios]], Steelbeak allies with Darkwing when he discovers that FOWL is intending to awaken the monstrous Duckthulu, rebelling against his employers. It is revealed to be a trap, as he and his superiors use Darkwing Duck as a sacrifice.

===Video games===
In both of the ''Darkwing Duck'' video games, Steelbeak appears as the final boss.

==Trivia==
*Steelbeak is similar to the James Bond villain Jaws. Both have metal in their mouths which can break through anything.
*Steelbeak is similar to the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Hammerhead]]. They are both dressed like 1920's gangsters and have replaced a part of their head with metallic prosthetics.
*His voice and speech pattern in ''Darkwing Duck'' are quite similar to the character [[Erol]] from the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode "[[Love is a Many Splintered Thing]]", who was also voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].
*It is also possible that his design was inspired by ''Looney Tunes'' character Foghorn Leghorn.
*Steelbeak is the only character to serve as a F.O.W.L. member in both ''Darkwing Duck'' and ''DuckTales''.
