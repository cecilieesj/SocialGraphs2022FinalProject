'''Toy Duck''' or '''Zombie Duck''' is the toy duck seen in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''.

==Appearances==

===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===
The Toy Duck was made during the ¨[[Making Christmas]]¨ sequence to be one of [[Jack Skellington]]'s macabre [[Christmas]]  presents. The duck was created by the [[Vampires]] of [[Halloween Town]], singing with them as they finished painting him.

Jack Skellington gives him and a [[Vampire Teddy|vampire teddy bear]] to a pair of children when he gives presents to the little kids in the real world. After Jack left, they came to life and chased the children all the way to their parents' room. Near the end of the movie, [[Santa Claus]] comes and replaces the toy duck with a toy boat. He does the same with the other toys that Jack delivered.

==Other Appearances==

===[[Disney Crossy Road]]===
The toy duck is a playable character in this mobile-app based game.

===[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]===
In both versions of Haunted Mansion Holiday, you can see him in the attic scene along with other scary toys Jack delivered in the movie. He also appears in one of the portraits in the stretching room.

==Trivia==
*The Toy Duck shares a resemblance to [[Donald Duck]] as shown by the pajamas of the kid who received the toy
*From 2001-2002, the duck toy appeared in the exit crypt of the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]] along with Jack's other scary toys before they were moved to the attic scene.
