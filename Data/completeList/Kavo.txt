'''Kavo''' is the large classroom bully who [[Kuzco]] makes fun of because of the way he speaks. He easily becomes angry. Oddly, he is a member of the Kuzco Academy musical club.

==Appearance==
{{Stubsection}}

==Personality==
{{Stubsection}}Despite his hulking demeanor, Kavo actually has a soft heart underneath it and only beats up those who make fun of him, especially Kuzco. That being said, he does have a malicious side, seeing as how he mocked Kuzco for being scared, forced him to go into Micchu’s tomb and lied that he bailed.
