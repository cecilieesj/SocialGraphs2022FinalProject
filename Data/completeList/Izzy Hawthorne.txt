'''Izzy Hawthorne''' is the deuteragonist in the [[2022]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Lightyear]]''.

==Background==
Izzy is [[Alisha Hawthorne|Alisha]]'s super motivated granddaughter eighty-nine years later in the future who leads the Junior Zap Patrol, a volunteer team of self-motivated cadets training to become protectors of the nascent society that has taken shape on the planet. Izzy dreams of becoming a Space Ranger like her grandmother, but that is easier said than done due to her fear of Space (which she eventually overcame).

===Physical appearance===
Izzy is a young black woman who bares a striking resembles to her grandmother. She has dark curly hair tied back in two buns, and has gold brown eyes. She wears a gold brown armored suit with the number "42" labelled on her right shoulder pad. At some point in the film, she bears her grandmother's Space Ranger suit.
