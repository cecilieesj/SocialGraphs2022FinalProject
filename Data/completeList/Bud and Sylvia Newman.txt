== Role in the film ==
Bud and Sylvia were mentioned in the second film, where  Carol stated that her parents were always telling her to Santa Claus did not exist. It was also implied that they had a tumultuous marriage because Carol said the only time they werenâ€™t arguing was during Christmas.

The pair are invited to the [[North Pole]] after Carol expresses that she misses them since she became Mrs. Claus. [[Scott Calvin|Scott]] arrives in [[Chicago]] with the [[Sandman (The Santa Clause)|Sandman]] (under the nickname of "Sandy") to take them to the North Pole. After they begin arguing, the Sandman uses his magic to put them to sleep, and make the trip back easier.

Due to the "Secret of Santa", Bud and Sylvia are under the impression that they have arrived in [[Canada]], rather than the North Pole. They are unaware of Scott and Carol's true identities, and simply believe Scott to be a toymaker.

After arriving, Bud and Sylvia meet [[Jack Frost]], whom they are told is an actor portraying him in their winter show. The pair also eventually learn that they were wrong about Santa Claus not existing when it turns out their son-in-law Scott is Santa and they are amazed by this news. They also become grandparents when Carol gives birth to her son.
