'''Tseebo''' is an Imperial [[Rodians|Rodian]], who appears in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episodes "[[Empire Day]]" and "[[Gathering Forces]]".

==Background==
Tseebo was a close friend to Ezra's parents, [[Ephraim and Mira Bridger]] but their small fight against the Empire worried him a lot. Concerned for their son's safety, he insisted that what they were doing was a great risk for both of them as the Empire was capable of doing such terrible things to people who tried to commit treason but Mira and Ephraim were not afraid to stand up for what they believed in or for their son's freedom. When the Empire came for Mira and Ephraim, Tseebo tried to help them but he was afraid to do so and as a result, they were captured and taken away while their son Ezra was left on the streets. Ashamed for not being able to save them, he went to work for the Imperial Information Office and was implanted with a Borg Construct Aj^6 device, sacrificing his personality for productivity. While working at the office, he searched for information on what happened to Mira and Ephraim Bridger so he could tell Ezra. He found what he was looking for but at the same time accidentally downloaded half of the Empire's secrets into his cybernetic implants. Schematics on new [[TIE Fighter]]s and Walkers, schedules for Trooper tactics and strategies and a five year plan for Lothal and every other world in the outer rim.

In the episode "[[Empire Day]]", Tseebo fled the office but soon became a wanted man with the Empire looking for him and had the entire planet on lock down, preventing any chance of him getting off [[Lothal]]. He went into hiding at Ezra's old home where he was found by Ezra, [[Kanan Jarrus|Kanan]] and [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]]. When they had a look at what he was carrying in his circuitry, the Rebels attempted to smuggle him off Lothal but it would not be easy with the Empire pursuing them.

In "[[Gathering Forces]]", Tseebo briefly regained his senses and when he recognized Ezra, he revealed to him knowledge of what happened on the day his parents were taken away. He struggled to tell Ezra but all he could say was he failed to help them and hoped Ezra would forgive him before his circuitry came back online. Unable to understand, Ezra refused to forgive him and didn't want to know anymore, mainly because he was afraid of what the truth maybe. However through the force Ezra told Tseebo he was forgiven while on Fort Anaxes and was delivered into safe custody with [[Ahsoka Tano|Fulcrum]]. Before leaving he passed on to Hera what he discovered about Ezra's parents.

==Trivia==
*The Borg Construct Aj^6 device that Tseebo wears is similar to what Lobot wore in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.
*Peter MacNicol who provided his voice, also performed several voice roles for Disney, such as [[Fenwick]] from ''[[Recess: School's Out]]'' and a character known as Major from ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]''.
