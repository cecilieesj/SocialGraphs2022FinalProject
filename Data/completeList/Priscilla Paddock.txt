'''Priscilla "the Killa" Paddock''' is a minor character from ''[[Amphibia]]''.

== Background ==

=== Personality ===
At first glance, Priscilla seemed extremely rude, arrogant, and self-centered, and loves winning at the Cart Smash Rally due to being its champion and competing it in for twenty years. Priscilla also showed some overconfidence as she won the Cart Smash Rally and did not worry at the injuries she sustained. However, underneath her rough exterior, Priscilla does have a good heart and cares very deeply about her daughter and late mother.

Priscilla also takes losing very well where she humbly congratulated [[Anne Boonchuy]] for winning the Cart Smash Rally and her late mother's teapot, despite being sad over not receiving her mother's last memento until Anne selflessly gave the teapot to her, something which Priscilla was grateful for. Priscilla was even willing to get hurt in order to protect others as she had decided to use her injured tail in order to prevent her cart from running over [[Polly Plantar]], despite her daughter's objections not to use her tail.

=== Appearance ===
Priscilla is a tall, muscular female pink newt with a light pink underbelly and short, white cropped hair. She wears grey armor and bandages wrapped on her hands and tail. She also has various scars across her body from her years of being a champion at the Cart Smash Rally. Priscilla wears a belt with a butterfly buckle on it.

== Role in the series ==
In "[[A Day at the Aquarium]]", she and Pearl are seen sitting on bench when Anne ran to go join up with the Plantars.

In "[[All In (Amphibia)|All In]]", Priscilla and Pearl are among the Wartwood resistance fighting against Andrias' forces as the [[Newtopia Castle]] appears in the sky.
