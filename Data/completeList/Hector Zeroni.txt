'''Hector Zeroni''' (or '''Zero''' for short) is the deuteragonist in the [[2003]] live-action film, ''[[Holes]]''. He was from the D-tent.
Hector's great-great-great-grandmother, [[Madame Zeroni]], was a one-legged gypsy. She was the woman who placed a curse on [[Stanley Yelnats IV|Stanley Yelnats]]' family because Stanley's great-great grandfather [[Elya Yelnats|Elya]] did not fulfill his end of the bargain with her.

== Background ==

Hector grew up living in many different places, having no real home. His mother abandoned him at the park one day for unknown reasons and never came back. At the end of the book/film, Hector is  reunited with his mother and it is revealed she had been looking for him as well.

==Trivia==

* If Zero didn't steal Clyde's shoes and threw them over Stanley's head, Stanley would never be sent to Camp Green Lake where they would meet each other and it would eventually break the Yelnats curse.
