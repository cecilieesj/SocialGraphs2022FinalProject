'''Jacobo Jacobo'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0163019/</ref> (pronounced ha-co-bo) is a character on ''[[The Replacements]]''. He is [[Todd Daring]]'s best friend who is of Mexican descent (though his shirt has the colors of the flag of Spain). He has a funny looking mouth. He loves mystery books and has a secret talent for singing. He also has a crush on Agent K, and is always trying to win her affections, even after he started dating [[Tasumi]] (though by the end of the episode "Irreplaceable", he finally does come to realize K is too old for him).
