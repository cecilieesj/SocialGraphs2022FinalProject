'''Yon-Rogg''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that is the main antagonist of ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''. He is the [[Kree]] commander of Starforce, being the direct threat to Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers and her mission. He is a ruthless conqueror answering to the [[Supreme Intelligence]], dedicating to genocide and conquering other races for the glory of the [[Kree]] empire. When he and the rest of the Kree target the [[Skrull]], it sets a chain of events that leads to [[Captain Marvel]] rebelling against him and using her powers as a protector of the innocent.

Yon-Rogg was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Gene Colan. 

==Trivia==
*[[Keanu Reeves]] was the initial choice, but was unable to take the role due to scheduling conflicts with ''John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.
