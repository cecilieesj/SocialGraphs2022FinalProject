He is [[Fagin (Oliver Twist)|Fagin]]'s lieutenant, a thief, and [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]'s best friend.

==Role in the film==
Dodger is first seen catching an orphan named [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]] trying to steal an apple from a market in London. Dodger stops Oliver from committing the theft and pretends to take him away when in fact, he simply intends to make a proper thief out of him since he, himself, is a master of thievery and to avoid him getting caught by the police. So, he decides to take Oliver to meet his fatherly mentor, [[Fagin (Oliver Twist)|Fagin]] at their hideout after introducing himself to Oliver as Jack Dawkins, better known as "The Artful Dodger" or simply "Dodger" in order to provide him with food and shelter and probably a way to reach Governor's Square; Oliver's point of destination when he learns that Oliver is an orphan.
