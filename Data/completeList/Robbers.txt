The '''Robbers''' are the main antagonists of ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]''.

==Role in the film==
They manage to rob the bank that is owned by [[Mr. Kroop]]. When [[Papi]] and [[Chloe]]'s puppies get in the bags of money to grab some, the robbers zip up the bags and leave, dognapping the puppies in the process. When [[Delgado]] learns where their hideout is, he, Papi, Chloe, and [[Pedro (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Pedro]] set off to the bread factory.

At the bread factory, the robbers eventually find out that they accidentally took the puppies with them. After Papi and the other dogs arrive and help defeat the robbers by getting them covered in bread dough, the police come and arrest them, despite their claims that they are really bread manufacturers.
