'''Clyde''', also known as '''Experiment 150''', is an illegal [[Experiments|genetic experiment]] created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to be an expert in theft and evasion. He has advanced lingual skills, enabling him to easily communicate with his partner-in-crime, [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], whom he is programmed to be drawn to. His one true place was originally in Kokaua Town Prison, but he was paroled in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]". After that, it is unknown where his one true place currently is.

==Background==
===Personality===
Clyde is a {{WikipediaLink|Kleptomania|kleptomaniac}}. However, this doesn't stop him from being quite a helpful friend to others, such as [[Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] (after he was reformed), as seen in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]". Jumba programmed him to be drawn to his partner-in-crime, Bonnie. Clyde can be considered the brawn of the duo, as he behaves in the manner of a clueless, dim-witted sidekick, although he is not outright stupid, just less intelligent than his partner.

He doesn't say much, despite being able to speak fluently, and what he does is usually dictated by Bonnie. He also has a tendency to doubt or question her well thought-out plans or schemes, and is often inclined to argue over her tactics. He sometimes acts indecisively and is usually reluctant to follow most of Bonnie's orders, despite being equally thievish.

He and Bonnie are also seen to be hoarders as well as thieves.

===Physical appearance===
Clyde is a large, yellowish-brown bear-like experiment with a roundly built body and a round face with a wide mouth; in contrast to this, his face has a small black nose, little-pointed ears, little stubby antennae, black eyes, and a lantern chin. In place of a proper left hand, he has a sort of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] army knife-like gun on a robotic metal arm from the elbow down that contains a variety of weapons and tools, although he has been shown to have a metal hand on it as well.

===Powers and abilities===
Clyde's large size and muscular build grant him superhuman strength and durability. In addition, his robotic left arm contains a variety of tools and weapons, such as a saw, drill, or even a robotic hand, to help him break into places he wants to rob. He can also speak fluently with a Brooklyn accent. His connection to Bonnie is programmed into his DNA.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 150 was the 150th genetic experiment created by Jumba with [[Jacques von Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to work with Experiment 149 to steal many belongings and evade arrest. 150 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

149 and 150's pods eventually made their way into a supply of doughnut holes at [[Kiki's Coffee Hut]].

[[Officer Kahiko]], who was off duty, bought a bag containing two dozen doughnut holes at the coffee shack. He then took out 149 and 150's pods and (mistaking them for a new flavor) dipped both pods in his coffee, activating the two experiments, which proceeded to strip Kahiko and hijack his police car. 150 was then seen wearing Kahiko's shirt for most of the [[Bonnie & Clyde|episode]].

The criminal duo next made a vain attempt to break into [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], but were forced to flee the scene when [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who had been notified of their activation, caught them in the act.

149 and 150 went on to cause countless robberies throughout the island until they were tracked back to their hideout by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], who had gone AWOL after being grounded by [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] earlier. After the four got acquainted, 149 told 150 her plan to encourage Lilo and Stitch's unruly behavior so that they would eventually show the two experiments how to break into Gantu's ship.

At first, Lilo and Stitch's naughty behavior posed as a distraction for 149 and 150 (named Bonnie and Clyde) while they stole from numerous places.

The following night, Bonnie and Clyde managed to convince Lilo and Stitch to help them successfully break into Gantu's ship. However, before the four could steal anything, they were ambushed and captured in containment orbs by Gantu. Lilo and Stitch were able to break out, though, and the four made a narrow escape.

When the outlaw experiments discovered that the police had found and secured their hideout, Bonnie convinced Lilo and Stitch to allow her and Clyde to take cover in the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]].

Bonnie and Clyde attempted to hide in Lilo's laundry, but were discovered by [[Pleakley]] while the latter was taking out the laundry, prompting the two robbers to tie him and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] up, unclothe them, and strip the house of everything. Jumba and Pleakley were later freed, and then let Lilo and Stitch use [[the Red One]] to chase down Bonnie and Clyde.

While the two thieves were fleeing to their new hideout in [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s [[X-Buggy|dune buggy]] – along with all of the Pelekais' other possessions in tow – they were attacked by Gantu in his [[Manta Shuttle|shuttle]], but saved by Lilo and Stitch, whom Bonnie and Clyde took back to their new hideout: the pre-robbed coffee shack.

However, Lilo and Stitch suddenly revealed their true colors: to re-infiltrate Bonnie and Clyde's hideout in order to capture them. When Stitch pointed a [[Net Cannon|net cannon]] at the two crooks, Bonnie and Clyde attempted to escape out a window that was locked, but were blasted into a net by Stitch, handed over to Officer Kahiko, and sent to Kokaua Town Prison.

In "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]", Clyde was one of the experiments in [[Pleakley]]'s E.A.R.W.A.X. group, alongside Bonnie. When [[Fibber]] used his lie-detecting ability to prove that Bonnie was not as intelligent as she claimed, nor was Clyde at fault for getting them arrested, the duo got into a fight, which ended when Pleakley convinced Bonnie and Clyde to attempt hugging therapy on each other.

In "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", Bonnie and Clyde were officially paroled, thus allowing them to join Lilo and Stitch on a mission to rescue Gantu's captive experiments. They assisted by opening a passage in Gantu's ship so Stitch and the others could break inside.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Bonnie and Clyde, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Bonnie and Clyde participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], with Clyde taking on at least six Leroys at one time.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Bonnie and Clyde made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where they escaped from Galactic Prison and traveled to the [[Izayoi Island|island]] in order to continue their primary function: theft. Because of this, they could be considered "incompletely rehabilitated". They have also revealed that they've tried to be good, but their programming interferes with it. Thus, it is unknown if they have truly turned good.

==Trivia==
*Clyde is Experiment 150. However, in [[Bonnie & Clyde|his debut]], his [[Experiment Pods|pod]] is labeled 350, most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].
**He is also called 350 in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime and its English dub. 
**Additionally, he is called 350 in the [[Spain|Castilian Spanish]] dub of ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''.
*Clyde is named after the bank robber, {{WikipediaLink|Bonnie and Clyde|Clyde Barrow}}.
*He speaks fluently like [[Reuben]], but with a Brooklyn accent, much like the real Clyde.
**He is also one of the few known experiments that can speak fluently.
**Additionally, he is shown to be less talkative than his partner, Bonnie.
*Clyde's pod color is purple.
*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Clyde as: "Experiment 150. Primary function: Theft and evasion."
*In "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]", Clyde was seen at Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group along with Bonnie, but they were put in jail by Officer Kahiko.
**However, this episode was confirmed by [[Jess Winfield]] to take place chronologically after "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", considering the fact that [[Nosy]] and [[Fibber]] are also present in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group.<ref name="WinfieldTVTome">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website={{WikipediaLink|TV.com|TV Tome}}|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 13, 2004}}</ref>
