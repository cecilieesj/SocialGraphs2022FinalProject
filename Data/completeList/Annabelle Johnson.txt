'''Annabelle Johnson''' is a minor character of the popular animated TV show, ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. She is [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]]'s long-lost cousin and niece of [[Mrs. Johnson]].

==Personal life==
Annabelle is a young businesswoman, who wants to buy the [[Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated]] building. She has either a husband, fiancé, or boyfriend with whom she was looking for a new home. After Candace carries her to the Johnson's family meeting by her pair of boots that make the wearer extraordinarily fast, it is revealed that Annabelle is a long-lost member of Johnson family. It is implied that she dropped an anvil on her head while working, which caused amnesia. She was recognized by [[Hildegard Johnson]], because of her birthmark (a letter "J") ("[[Run, Candace, Run]]"). It is unknown if she decided to stay together with or break up with/divorce her husband/fiancé/boyfriend after she regained her memory of being a Johnson. It is mentioned that her favorite year is 1973. She could have been born in that year. 

==Physical appearance==
Annabelle has square glasses and short, brown hair. She has a light-blue dress with a lighter belt. She has dark-blue high heels which match her earrings.

==Personality and traits==
Annabelle is a very quirky woman. She loves the 1980s style, gargoyles (etc.) which was the reason she wanted to buy [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz]]'s apartment. She is also very enthusiastic. This is shown when she makes remarks about how 'perfect' Doofenshmirtz's apartment is.

She mentioned that she has had a job of hanging anvils and she regrets it later on ("[[Run, Candace, Run]]").
