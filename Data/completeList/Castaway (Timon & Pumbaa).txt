===Personality===
The castaway has a controlling personality, doing whatever possible to trick [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] into letting him eat them. He skillfully confused them into believing anything he said. He is also creative, coming up with a tour guide disguise to persuade them they were on a tour of the island. Furthermore, he was nearly able to cook them before they realized what was happening.

While flying his jet plane one day, the castaway crashed into a desert island outside Manhattan. Some time later, [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] found themselves on the island. Initially, the castaway tried to eat them by using their befuddlement to his advantage.
