'''Angela''' is a character from both Image Comics and [[Marvel Comics]] who appeared in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. She is an Asgardian warrior and sister of [[Thor Odinson]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''===
She accompanies Thor into attending a statue unveiling on Spartax that depicted the years of peace Spartax had with Asgard. Angela gets into a brief swordfight with Gamora. Later on, she faces Gamora again when the Guardians of the Galaxy end up in Asgard. In the episode "Asgard War Part One: Lightning Strikes," Angela accompanies Thor in the war against Spartax. In the episode "Asgard War Part Two: Rescue Me," Angela accompanies Thor and the Destroyer Armor into assisting the Guardians of the Galaxy into rescuing Star-Lord from Thanos.

==Trivia==
*Angela's status as an Asgardian is a recent retcon brought by the character being purchased by Marvel Comics. As she was originally envisioned, she is an angel from Heaven who is a reluctant ally and sometimes enemy of the demonic anti-hero Spawn.
*Angela is the first character featured in a Disney-owned Marvel TV show who originated from a different comic company than Marvel.
**Angela is also the first character in a Disney TV show intended for families who was previously featured in a non-Disney TV show meant for an adult audience.
