==Role in the film==
Viking 1 is a satellite who was built by {{WikipediaLink|NASA}} and sent to [[Mars]], and like the real Viking 1, he became famous for becoming the first spacecraft to successfully land on Mars and perform his mission.

He is known to be very proud of himself, but is also occasionally cranky, especially after breaking down and realizing it was planned that way when his mission was over, remain on Mars for all eternity. The only company he has ever had is an ACAM Christmas angel named [[Tinselina]] who was put inside him by an unknown kid at NASA and talks about nothing but Christmas.

At the near end of the film, he is seen saying goodbye to Tinselina, as she has been invited to return to Earth by [[Toaster]] and the others.

==Trivia==
*Viking 1 was {{WikipediaLink|DeForest Kelley}}'s only voice role and final role in a Disney animated film before he died of stomach cancer a year later in June 11, 1999.
