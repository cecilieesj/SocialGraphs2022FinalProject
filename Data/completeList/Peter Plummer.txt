==Role in the film==
Peter is first seen with his mother, [[Julie Plummer|Julie]], holding him as she comes to the door to welcome [[Shane Wolfe]]. She puts him down after she introduces Shane to [[Zoe Plummer|Zoe]] and [[Seth Plummer|Seth]]. He is later seen holding Seth's hand and his own hand in his mouth as Julie kisses him good-bye. He is seen again standing in the fish tank and throwing Cheerios which fill his Pull-Up which he pees in. He then says, I peed my Pull-Up," and Helga mutters, "Thank you, Peter," after he throws Cheerios on her face, which upsets [[Tyler Plummer|Tyler]]. He is briefly seen in bed while Helga sings the "Peter Panda Dance" for him.

Peter is seen the next morning at the table at breakfast, and when [[Lulu Plummer|Lulu]] finishes copying Shane, he poops in his pull up.He is seen again in the bathroom being a ghost with a blanket on his head, which annoys Lulu. Then he pees in his Pull-Up, the graphics on it fade, and Shane comes in, telling him to stop and places him on the toilet with his Pull-Up on. He shakes his head when Shane tells him if he has seen the ghost that Lulu was talking about. He is seen again in Seth's arms. At one point Tyler poops in his diaper so everybody runs, including Peter.

Peter is seen the next morning. He pulls the tablecloth off the table between Tyler's cries. He is then seen in the toddler carrier, his booster seat, at school, and at the supermarket where Lulu's troop, the Fireflies, hold a cookie stand. Later, Shane realizes that he has left him at Woody Woodchuck's and goes back there to get him. But Shane pulls him out of the ball pit buck-naked. He is briefly seen standing in the car while watching Zoe drive. That night, Seth tells Shane to do the "Peter Panda Dance" so Peter will stop crying and writes the lyrics down for him. He tucks Peter in and gives it a go. He is then seen in his room, after Shane puts Tyler to bed. He does the "Peter Panda Dance" for him, properly like he practiced. Afterward, he says goodnight to Peter who replies, "Goodnight, Daddy." Shane doesn't think he is Peter's real father, but he says goodnight to him. Later that night Peter has to use the bathroom so he runs quickly to it holding onto his Pull-Up while it is up. Then he pulls it down and uses the potty after which he pulls it up and goes back to bed. The next night he pees in it up so he grabs a new one and puts it on. He briefly appears in the supermarket when Shane sees the Fireflies beating the Bear Troop.

Peter is later seen when Zoe and Seth bring Peter and Tyler to their room when their North Korean neighbors, [[Mr. & Mrs. Chun]], break in. Then they come out and desperately hug Shane. Peter reappears when they welcome Julie home. Later, Mr. Chun puts Peter and Tyler in the playpen and Seth, Zoe, and Lulu bound up together on the floor, but when Zoe says, "Now, Peter!", he squirts his juice drink in Mr. Chun's face.
