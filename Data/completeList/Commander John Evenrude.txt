'''Commander John Evenrude''' is a character from ''[[A Pirate's Adventure: Treasures of the Seven Seas]]'' in the [[Magic Kingdom]] of [[Walt Disney World]].

==History==

===Background===
John Evenrude was a commander in the British Royal Navy during the 18th century. Evenrude would be given the job of hunting down the infamous pirate-captain [[Jack Sparrow]] only for Evenrude to show his greedy and corrupt side. Evenrude sent letters to Sparrow promising to delay the navy's attack on him in-return for a jewel known as the Treasure of the Indian Ocean.

Sparrow and his crew would betray Evenrude however, channeling the mystic powers of the jewel while leaving its curse to be inflicted upon John. This transformed John into an undead skeleton and left him at the bottom of a tropical river with him declaring that he would seek vengeance on Jack.
