==Personality==
Oskar and Kick have a mutual hatred for each other, although in "Dog Gone" they do show respect and liking for each other, and brothers from a different mother like bond however this is short-lived at the end of the episode.

Oskar was the main antagonist of the episode "Morning Rush!" Kick's "dog ate my homework" excuse is no longer valid and must complete two months full of homework in one night. When Oskar actually eats his first copy, he must now do two months' worth of homework questions in less than 6 minutes, or he will fail the class with Oskar still in pursuit.

Kick and Gunther endure the freezing cold of a frozen MellowBrook in the episode "Snowpocalypse!" Oskar attempts to attack them as they made their way to the the Food 'n' Fix, and find Wade to tow the bus out of the gully. Meanwhile, Kick and Gunther hike up a mountain, and head through town during a blizzard. Just as they are about to give up, Wade finds them, and they conspire a plan Using Oskar as a motor, they manage to tow everyone back to the school, just in time for it to end.

In the episode "Detained" Principal Henry, tired of Kick's mayhem and havoc in the school calls Ms. Chicarelli out of retirement. Kick, [[Gunther Magnuson|Gunther]], Mouth, and [[Ronaldo]] get detention due to Oskar actions by Chicarelli.

In the episode "K-Nein" after being rescued by a dog called Jazzy and later growing attached to her after she defeated him from both Oskar and [[Brad Buttowski|Brad]]'s attack.

In the episode"Dude, Where's My Wade?" Wade goes missing and the safety inspector's appointment at the Food 'n' Fix, Kick and Gunther follow a series of clues to track him down before the inspector shuts down their favorite convenience store. Oskar was one of the causes of Wade disappearance swiping Wade's foot-bag causing to chase the dog all over MellowBrook, however Oskar does return the toy just in time safety inspector who also adores the game.

==Trivia==
*In the episode"Pool Daze", it's revealed that Oskar is at least 10 in human years (about 70 in dog years) however Oskar appears as a puppy in the janitor flashback when he was a child attending MellowBrook high school under Ms. Chicarelli reign in the episode"Detained", considerably making Oskar older than 10.
