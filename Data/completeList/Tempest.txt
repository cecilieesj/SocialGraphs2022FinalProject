==Background==
===Personality===
Tempest comes off as a strict and harsh girl with a mean temper. This is due to the strict upbringing she was given by her mother, who abhors any acts that might seem feminine or weak (such as cooking or smiling). However her father attempts to encourage her to express herself and even sent her to [[Prometheus Academy]] to be among normal kids. During her time at the academy, she has learned to express herself in her own way and she even developed a somewhat rough friendship with [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]].

==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==
Tempest is a classmate of Hercules and his friends at Prometheus Academy and often find herself working together with Hercules during several misadventures whenever they come upon a crisis. Although originally seeing Hercules as an annoyance and nuisance, Tempest comes to gradually care about Hercules and see him as a friend. Tempest is also one of the few girls Hercules has a crush on during his high school years, before he met and fell in love with [[Megara|Meg]]. However, Tempest shows no signs of reciprocating Hercules' feelings.

In "[[Hercules and the Assassin]]", Hercules meets Tempest, an Amazon Warrior Princess and quickly finds himself smitten with her, but is advised by Icarus and Cassandra that he does not have a chance with her due to her strict and hot tempered amazonian personality. Hercules attempts to impress her with his spear skills and borrows one of Phil's to show off. However, it unfortunately falls in the hands of [[Clion|Minister Clion]] who uses it to frame Phil for the attempted assassin of Pericles. When Tempest learns of Phil's wrongful imprisonment, she decides to find the real assassin to prove his innocence and works together alongside Hercules. After saving the day, Tempest has become impressed with Hercules and agrees to have lunch with him.

In "[[Hercules and the Techno Greeks]]", Tempest strives to show off her skills as a Amazon Warrior Princess, but is angered, feelings her skills are being wasted and isnâ€™t living up to her expectations, especially after reading and presenting a poet she wrote in class.

In order to put her skills to better use, Tempest applies for the job as protector for the city of Abacus Valley, home to the Techno Greeks and is soon hired, ready to defend it during another attack by the local centaurs. However, Tempest arrives too late to find that Hercules has already defeated them. Tempest is greatly angered, but only becomes further infuriated when she is replaced by Hercules as the city's new protector, causing her to storm off in a huff. Tempest seeks revenge against Hercules. However, when she finds herself in a local centaur tavern, the local gang of trouble making centaurs attempt to kick her out, until she quickly defeats their boss and as a result becomes their new leader.
