'''Gus Porter''' is a recurring character who appears in the [[2020]] [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''. He is a young witch and one of [[Luz Noceda|Luz's]] friends on [[The Boiling Isles]].

==Background==
Gus is an Illusion student who attends [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] alongside [[Willow Park]] and [[Luz Noceda]], who are both friends. He also happens to be somewhat of an expert on human culture, and is the President of the Human Appreciation Society at his school. However, his knowledge on humans is often inaccurate. For example, he believed humans had gills and wore braces to make them magnetic. Gus is in a few grades higher above his friends.

=== Personality ===
Gus is an enthusiastic youth who loves showing off his capabilities and share his ideas. He can be slightly belligerent and a little unfocused, but knows what is important to him. He is constantly seeking approval from his peers, implying that he is slightly self conscientious. In "[[Agony of a Witch]]" he uses the Oracle Sphere to see what the best version of himself is and is satisfyingly told that he is "always [his] best self".

===Physical appearance===
Gus is slightly shorter than Willow and Luz with dark skin and dark brown hair with lighter shades. Like all the witches and Wizards on the boiling isles, he has pointy ears. When attending school, Gus wears a gray tunic with a dark gray belt, hoodie, and boots. As part of the Illusion track, the color of his sleeves and leggings are light blue.

In season two, Gus undergoes witch puberty. He is now roughly the same height as Willow, and his features are noticeably sharper, including his hair.

In season three, Gus is wearing a black and teal baseball shirt with a stylized tree on the front, a black leather jacket, and blue pants. He's also wearing at least three watches on his wrists.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Magic:''' Gus is adept in magic, and Like all witches and wizards, he gets his magic from a sack of magic bile attached to his heart.
**'''Illusion magic:''' As an illusion student, Gus specializes in casting illusion based magic.
*'''Staff:''' During Palisman Pairing Day, Gus adopted a chameleon palisman named Emmiline.

==Role in the [[The Owl House|series]]==
===Season One===
[[File:I Was a Teenage Abomination 21.png|left|thumb|250px|Gus and Willow with their new friend Luz.]]
Gus Porter is a prodigy on the illusion track who was "moved up a couple grades". Due to this, he frequently creates illusions of himself to attend his classes while he moves freely around [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]]. He is friends with the slightly older [[Willow Park]] due to them sharing a similar status of them being outcasts (Willow because of her introverted personality and Gus for being younger than his peers). One day at school, Willow shows up with the human [[Luz Noceda]]. This greatly impresses Gus who just so happens to be obsessed with human culture and the president of the Human Appreciation Society (H.A.S.). Gus helps Luz and Willow out when [[Amity Blight]] attempts to expose them and get them in trouble while also learning what a high five is.

Gus begins to become close with Luz and he and Willow begin to go on various adventures with her. He learns more about Willow and her past with Amity. While Luz comments that Willow is a great witch, Gus concurs; glad that he is there for support for her two friends. While at a H.A.S. meeting, Gus is challenged by a boy named Mattholomule for the presidency of the club. Knowing that he is a phony and not wanting to lose his presidency of the club, Gus decides to bring Luz to school to show him up; not informing her that she has been banned from the school. After getting caught in another dangerous adventure, which had them ending up in the detention room full of monsters, Gus willingly gave up his presidency so that Luz could still get accepted into Hexside after [[Eda Clawthorne]] went out of her way to help her get into the school.
[[File:Agony of a Witch (47).png|thumb|250px|Gus gets approval from his own illusion.]]
Gus was thrilled to having Luz attend Hexside as this meant him and Willow could be closer to her. He slowly begins to admire and appreciate the people from the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] itself. He at first was at odds with [[King (The Owl House)|King]] when he attempts to steal Luz away from him and Willow out of jealousy, but by the end of their adventure, Gus becomes good friends with him and even gives him some emotional support when he realizes that he has stage fright. He also begins to admire Eda as just like Luz, he things she is amazing and a great witch, and also finds [[Hooty]] somewhat humorous, though he quickly gets tired of him. Gus helps Luz with trying to cure and rescue Eda from her curse. While they initially fail with trying to steal an old relic, Gus and Willow help Luz afterwards by convincing numerous spectators that executing Eda is wrong.

===Season Two===
In "[[Escaping Expulsion]]", upon reuniting with Luz at Hexside, she noted that Gus' voice had deepened as a result of witch puberty. Subsequently, Gus, Luz and Willow are expelled from Hexside by Amity's parents and after several failed attempts to return, crow phone sent by their father drag them back home to be grounded. Amity later recruited Gus and Willow to rescue Luz from her parents' weapon demonstration. 

In  "[[Hunting Palismen]]", Gus gains his own Palisman, which takes the form of a blue chameleon. While his father wants him to become a master illusionist, Gus considers that too easy, so he declares that he wants to become the Boiling Isles' ambassador to the Human Realm and to reestablish contact with the giraffes.

In "[[Eda's Requiem]]", Gus stood silently with his father while commenting on the Gland Prix.

==Relationships==
===[[Luz Noceda]]===
[[File:Hooty's Moving Hassle (57).png|thumb|250px|Gus performing magic with Luz and Willow.]]
Gus sees Luz as the most fascinating person to have ever set foot on the Boiling Isles, mostly because she is a human. While he occasionally views her as a specimen to examine, he does see her as a genuine friend. His obliviousness of human culture is seen as adorable by Luz. Gus will occasionally get on her nerves, but always manages to get back onto her good side. He is willing to stand up for her and as seen in "[[Something Ventured, Someone Framed]]" when he took the blame for destroying the detention room; losing his place in the Human Appreciation Society.

===[[Willow Park]]===
Gus has known Willow for quite some time and both bond over their mutual designation of being outcasts. He holds a special sibling-like relationship with her and defends her from the usual insults that she receives. It is slightly implied that Gus holds her in high regard as when Luz told Willow that she is the greatest witch she knows before apologizing to a present Gus, he tells her "I know what I'm about".

===[[Mattholomule]]===
[[File:Gustholomule.webp|thumb|210x210px|Gus being unsure of Mattholomule.]]
Though Gus welcomed Mattholomule to the H.A.S. with open arms, he quickly began to despise him because of his attitude, and when he challenges for his spot as club president and outs his friend, Luz to the school guards.

===[[Hunter]]===
Gus first met Hunter in "[[Any Sport in a Storm]]". Unlike Willow, he didn't seem too fond of the Golden Guard at first and encouraged him to not mess up Willow's efforts to form a flyer derby team. After Hunter almost handed him and the Emerald Entrails to Belos, Gus grew wary of him, especially when he a disheveled and outcasted Hunter taking refuge in Hexside. However, after the former Golden Guard saves him from Head Illusionist Adrian, Gus begins to grow closer to him, even helping him pull out of a panic attack. When they find Willow in the labyrinth illusion, Hunter saves Gus from the trap, though they get separated thanks to Adrian and a few Coven Scouts. Hunter soon wakes up, and after getting on the school's side, rushes to the gymnasium without hesitation to save his friend from Adrian.

===Owl House Inhabitants===
[[File:Understanding Willow (125).png|thumb|250px|Gus does a piece on Hooty.]]
Collectively, Gus finds the people within the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]] amusing. Much like Luz, he apparently admires [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] for her notoriety and understands why Luz looks up to her so much. He feels similarly about King, though in "[[Really Small Problems]]", he was upset with him when he attempted to remove him and Willow so that he can have Luz to himself. However, by the end, he and Willow make amends and start to consider him one of their friends. In "[[Understanding Willow]]", Gus found [[Hooty]] more interesting than either Eda or King, but by the end of the episode sees that he is annoying and unfocused.
