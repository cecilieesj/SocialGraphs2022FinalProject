'''Makini''' is a female mandrill who appears in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. She is [[Rafiki]]'s young apprentice, set to succeed him as Royal Mjuzi of the [[Pride Lands]] once [[Kiara]] becomes queen.

This same brown fur collars her neck. Atop her head is a slightly lighter yet still dark brown fur. Her hands, feet, and muzzle are pink. Her face is grey which rims around the eyes, with blue stripes settling just underneath. On her nose and reaching toward her forehead is a large magenta 'stripe', which ends just before her eyebrows. Her eyes are olive green. Her teeth, whilst petite, are sharp.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====[[Fikiri]] and [[Kitendo]]====
Makini has had a very close relationship with her parents ever since she was born. They play together a lot on Makini's first trip to the Tree of Life. When Kion becomes king of the Tree of Life, Fikiri and Kitendo are proud of Makini because she is now a Royal Mjuzi, and she hugs her parents.

===Friends===
====[[Rafiki]]====
They have first met at the Tree of Life because the Great Lions of the Past tell him that Makini would be the next Royal Mjuzi for the Pride Lands (though in Season 3 she becomes Royal Mjuzi of the Tree of Life instead of the Pride Lands). Rafiki acts as a teacher for Makini. He teaches her how to be a good Royal Mjuzi. As Makini learns more and more about the Royal Mjuzi's responsibilities, Rafiki grows more proud of her. Rafiki lets Makini go to the Tree of Life with the Lion Guard and is proud to see her as a Royal Mjuzi when Kion becomes king of the Tree of Life.

====[[Kion]]====
Kion and Makini first met after Kion was talking to Mufasa at the beginning of the dry season. They later work together on many missions, such as getting the volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. The mandrill even comes with him to the Tree of Life. Unfortunately, because Kion was scarred by Ushari, he has been hostile toward her on their way to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. Despite this they are still very close friends. In fact, Makini even becomes Kion's Royal Mjuzi when he marries Rani and becomes king of the Tree of Life.

====[[Fuli]]====
Of all of the members of Kion's Lion Guard, Makini admires Fuli the most because she is the first female to ever join the Lion Guard. Even though Fuli gets annoyed with Makini at times, she still values her as a close friend. One day, when they take a tour to the Back Lands with Kongwe, Fuli stands up for her when Makucha attacks her.

====[[Kiara]]====
Makini admires Kiara a lot. She was originally going to be Kiara's Royal Mjuzi (if Makini still lived in the Pride Lands, she would have become Kiara and [[Kovu]]'s Royal Mjuzi). Makini and Kiara look for water in the middle of the Pride Lands. Makini tries to help Kiara when they are attacked by [[Janja's Clan|hyenas]], but could not.

====[[Ono]]====
Makini and Ono's relationship really develops for the better in [[Marsh of Mystery]] when both of them get lost because Makini chased some marsh lights. Ono is initially upset with Makini because she got them lost, but once they learn to work together, they get out of the underground caves of the Marsh. Also, on the way to the Tree of Life, Makini protects Ono whenever he is in dangers, such as when Makucha attacked their friends.

====[[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]]====
Makini was interested for Rafiki to tell her about how Timon and Pumbaa brought Christmas to the Pride Lands. Makini also watches the Ukumbusho performance with Timon and Pumbaa. She later asks them to put on a show for her Mpando Mpaya to cheer all of the Pride landers up and they agree to do so. Makini then presumably watches Timon and Pumbaa perform [[Tujiinue]] in Mizimu Grove.

==== [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] ====
When Makini comes to the Tree of Life she continues her Royal Mjuzi training. After Queen Janna completes her journey through the Circle of Life, Makini becomes Rani's Royal Mjuzi. In "[[Journey to the Pride Lands]]" she tells Kion that she needs to stay with Rani.

=== Acquaintances ===

==== [[Baliyo]], [[Surak]] and [[Nirmala]] ====
Makini is on good terms with the rest of the [[Night Pride]].

==== [[Janna]] ====
When Makini was little she comes to the Tree of Life to meet Rafiki. Janna is their in the background and watches her. When she comes to the Tree of Life in "[[The River of Patience]]" Janna says that she remembers Makini. She even continues her Royal Mjuzi training.

[[Kongwe]]

Makini and Kongwe are on good terms. Makini helps bring Kongwe to Pride Rock.

===Enemies===
====[[Ushari]]====
Ushari asks Makini if there is a way to talk to Scar. This tricks Makini into asking Rafiki about the bad lions of the past, such as Scar. When Ushari listens to Makini and Rafiki's conversation about a way to talk to the villainous lions of the past, such as Scar, Ushari overhears that a bakora staff and a scheme to make Kion use the Roar of the Elders in anger would revive Scar. Ushari later attempts to kill Makini and her friends before they can cure Simba from the scorpion sting.

====[[Scar]]====
Makini is scared of Scar because of all the bad things he has done, such as killing Mufasa and destroying the Pride Lands. When Scar orders his army to kill her and her friends before they can cure Simba from the scorpion sting, Makini comments that Scar has a lot of friends (in this case, they would be his minions, not his friends). Makini sees Scar again in a fire at Mizimu Grove.

====[[Makucha]]====
In "[[The Wisdom of Kongwe]]", Makucha attacks her and Kongwe when they first met. Fuli stands up for them and Makucha runs away. Makucha attempts to attack her again when she and the Lion Guard are passing through his territory in the Back Lands.

In "[[The Harmattan]]", Makucha later kidnaps Makini to attempts to get her to guide him to the Tree of Life during the Harmattan, so that he can eat rare animals. Makucha then swears vengeance on the mandrill and her friends.

In "[[The Triumph of the Roar]]", Makucha and Ora later trap her, Nirmala, Surak, and Baliyo in the Tree of Life until Kion frees them with the Roar of the Elders.

==Trivia==
*Makini was first seen in early January 2017, on a French sticker album due for release in March 2017. The image of Makini was removed before release, but several months later, the same image was used on a bucket in Poland. On June 27th 2017, a plush toy of Makini was released, despite her lack of appearances in the show itself. This makes Makini the first character in the series to have merchandise available ahead of her official debut.
*Makini means "calm", "quietly," or "careful" in Swahili, though ironically she is the exact opposite and is rather energetic and talkative.
*She is one of the few guest characters with a major role in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' (she is a major character in Season 2, Scar is the main antagonist of that season). The others [[Jasiri]], [[Makuu]], [[Scar]], and [[Ushari]] (Makuu was a major antagonist of Season 1 and Ushari is a major villain in Season 2).
*A running gag in the series is that Makini repeatedly loses her bakora staff: either broken, or in fire.
*Unlike Rafiki, Makini’s appearance is close to resembling a mandrill in real life; her tail, especially, is an actual mandrill’s tail design.
*In Season 3, she becomes the Royal Mjuzi to King Kion and Queen Rani.
