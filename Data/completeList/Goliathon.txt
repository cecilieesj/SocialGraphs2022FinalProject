The '''Goliathon''' is a character who appears in the [[2014]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated special, ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''. He is an enormous Erythosuchus that is part of the fictional Battlesaurs toy line.

==Background==
The Goliathon is a six-legged Erythosuchus which was used during the Arena of Woe during a tough battle at the arena. Seen below the Goliathon's right ear is a red button which opens the Goliathon's mouth to which during the battle, [[Trixie]] attempts to open the Goliathon's mouth but the Goliathon prevents her from opening him to rescue her friends.

===Development===
While developing the Goliathon character, early sketches were designed prior to keeping his design staying true to his early design in the final version of the short.

In the deleted scene "S.O.S.", the sequence would have focused on [[Woody]] and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] riding Goliathon to escape the Arena of Woe while trying to signal [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] who is playing video games to which for the final cut, the sequence was replaced with Reptillus and Trixie's story arc for the final version of the animated special. <ref>Deleted Scene "Battlesaurs Christmas" (''Toy Story That Time Forgot'' Blu-ray Disc; 2015).</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''===
During battle at the Arena of Woe, [[the Cleric]] summons the Goliathon during the battle being carried by two Battlesaur Brutes to which while arriving at the Arena, Ray-Gon presses the button on the Goliathon where he ferociously roars and leaps onto the arena platform where he swallows [[Woody]] and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] during the battle. Noticing Woody and Buzz being swallowed by the Goliathon, Trixie attempts to hit the button to rescue her friends but the Goliathon blocks her attack to which when Trixie finds herself flipped over where the Battlesaurs see Bonnie's name on [[Trixie]] to which Trixie escapes the arena while being chased by [[Reptillus Maximus]]. The Goliathon suddenly leaves the arena following Trixie's escape.

The Goliathon then appears during the scene where he approaches the Cleric at the Triassic Tower where Rex, who is being controlled by the Cleric who is using the controls for the Supplicator, opens the Goliathon's mouth to get Woody and Buzz out of the giant reptilian, followed by [[Angel Kitty]] being deployed by the Goliathon where Woody, Buzz, and Angel Kitty are held hostage by the Battlesaurs while being sent to the Pit. However, the plan throw Woody, Buzz, and Angel Kitty into the fan was disrupted due to the fact that [[Mason]] and [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] arrive at the Battleopolis area while playing with Reptillus due to the fact that the Battlesaurs (including the rest of the toys) froze when Mason and Bonnie arrived at the spot. During playtime, Bonnie uses the Goliathon as a racing vehicle with Ray-Gon placed on top of him followed by Buzz, Fauntleroy, and one of the Cleric's acolytes being held by the Goliathon's mouth.

During the credits, the Goliathon is briefly seen in the playroom (albeit inanimate) by a reformed Reptillus while exploring quietly across the playroom.

===Other appearances===
The Goliathon also appears briefly in the fake opening of the ''Battlesaurs'' "cartoon" which is found as a bonus feature in the [[2015]] Blu-ray and Digital releases of ''Toy Story That Time Forgot''. In it, he is seen emerging from the ground toward the end of the "intro" where he is seen firing a very powerful beam just before looping to Reptillus standing on the ''Battlesaurs'' title.
