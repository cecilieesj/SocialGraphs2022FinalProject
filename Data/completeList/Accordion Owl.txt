The '''Accordion Owl''' is a character featured in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[1951]] animated feature film,  ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. It is one of the creatures that [[Alice]] encounters at [[Tulgey Wood]].

==Background==
As its name implies, the Accordion Owl is a red owl that can stretch its own neck due to its accordion-like neck and whenever it stretches its neck, it not only hoots but also makes accordion sounds. It has a plumage of red feathers and a pair of pale yellow eyes with black pupils in it.

===Origins===
The Accordion Owl has no existing counterpart from the original ''Alice in Wonderland'' story by Lewis Carroll and is completely unrelated to the Owl from the Caucus Race sequence.

==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
When [[Alice]] is exploring [[Tulgey Wood]], she encounters the Accordion Owl after encountering the [[Cage Bird]] where the Accordion Owl is seen sitting on an oak tree. It is then seen hooting and stretching its accordion-like neck as it flies across Tulgey Wood. Upon seeing it, the Accordion Owl flies over Alice to which she crouches to avoid getting hit just as Alice comments, "Oh, it's so nice if something would make sense for a change." It later appears again during the "[[Very Good Advice]]" musical sequence where it is seen amongst the other creatures of Tulgey Wood observing Alice who is feeling distressed of returning back home. The Accordion Owl then disappears along with the other creatures when it and the other creatures see Alice's sadness. It never appears again after that.

===[[Alice in Wonderland (attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]]===
The Accordion Owl is one of the creatures encountered during the Tulgey Wood sequence in the [[Disneyland]] ride where it is seen stretching its accordion neck. Film audio of the Accordion Owl's hooting and accordion noise can be heard when guests pass through the Owl just before the vehicles pass by a family of [[Horn Ducks]].

===[[Alice's Curious Labyrinth]]===
In the [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]] attraction, the Accordion Owl is seen in the first section of a maze consisting a section that represents Tulgey Wood. Although the dialogues of the characters in this attraction are entirely spoken in French, reused film audio of the Accordion Owl's hooting and accordion noise from the original English language can be heard when guests pass through the Owl during the maze sequence.

==Trivia==
*The Accordion Owl is one of the few creatures seen during the "Very Good Advice" musical number that does not have tears coming out of its eyes upon seeing Alice feeling distressed.
