However, he can sometimes jump to conflusions such as when he believed that Phil was responsible for the attempted assassination of Athens leader, Pericles and refuses to look any further into the investigation, showing his stubborness.

Although Phil was proven innocent, he still continued to show open hostility toward both Phil and Hercules. However, after properly getting to know them and after witnessing the young hero's bravery, he isn't afraid to admit when he is wrong. Chipacles apologises for his prior behavior, admitting he misjudged both Phil and Hercules and acknowledges the good work they did. Chipacles also shows respect to his superiors, especially his teacher, Mentor and showed a more emotional side when he was taken and was determinded to save him and get justice after Hecate stole his toughness.
