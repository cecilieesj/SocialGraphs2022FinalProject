'''Eric Koenig''' is a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent in Marvel's ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.

==Background information==
Eric Koenig is introduced in "[[Providence]]" as the caretaker of the secret S.H.I.E.L.D. base Providence. He is pleased to meet [[Phil Coulson|Agent Coulson]] who has become a legend among the higher-level agents after the events of the Battle of New York. He tells the agents that [[Nick Fury|Director Fury]] is dead, but tells Coulson in confidence that Fury is still alive.

In "[[The Only Light in the Darkness]]", Koenig will not allow Coulson's team to leave Providence base until he has tested the reliability of the members. He puts them all through an orientation involving a lie-detector which he designed to examine 96 variables. He notices fluctuations in [[Grant Ward]]'s test and points a gun at him. Ward lies his way to passing the test. After Coulson, [[Jemma Simmons|Simmons]], [[Leo Fitz|Fitz]], and [[Antoine Triplett|Triplett]] leave, Eric is left with Ward and [[Skye]]. When he is alone with Ward, the HYDRA agent kills him and hides his body in a supply closet.

In "[[Nothing Personal]]" his corpse is found by Simmons.

In "[[Beginning of the End]]", it is revealed that Billy Koenig, who is identical to Eric, and is there to help Coulson, the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Trivia==
* In the comics, Eric Koenig was a member of Nazi Youth Group during World War II. Later, he abandoned this organization to join the [[Howling Commandos]]. After the war, Koenig was one of the Howlers that joined Nick Fury in forming S.H.I.E.L.D..
