Mickey and Minnie decide to take a vacation on a luxury cruise ship, and Erica wants them to relax. But after hearing that they have V.I.P. experience, she decides to torture them for fun.
==Personality==
Erica is very excitable. At first she seems like a normal, calm cruise director that wants her guests to relax. But when Mickey and Minnie mention the "VIP Experience", she gets really excited and goes nuts trying to get them to enjoy the ship.

==Role in ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''==
Erica is the cruise director for the ship Mickey and Minnie go on. She tells them to relax and to let the ship's staff do everything for them. But after hearing that Mickey and Minnie have the VIP experience, she gets all excited, and presses a button, sending the two flying into all sorts of activities, to which they're confused and scared. Eventually, the two hide from her and she appears in their hiding spot, sending them gliding into the sky. She then sends up fireworks, accidentally knocking the two down off the ship onto a private island. She is not seen again.
