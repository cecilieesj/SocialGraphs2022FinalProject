'''Fizz''' is a character from ''[[Get Ed]]''. She is very smart and being most handy when it comes to technology, planning, and building new equipment for the Dojo. Her quick thinking saves the crew constantly. Her vehicle is a flying scooter. Her symbol is "The Builder".

Fizz is the one on the right where the Get Ed sign is.

She is the second youngest of the Dojo kids, being older than Ed but younger than the rest.

She acts like kind of an insecure but responsible big-sister-figure to Ed.

She is considered a midget and is quite small for her age, considering the fact that she's in her teens. Which frustrates her a lot.
==Trivia==
*She is voiced by Bailey Stocker
