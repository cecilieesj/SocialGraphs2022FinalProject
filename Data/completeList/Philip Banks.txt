When [[Gordon Bombay]] learns that the star player for the Hawks, Adam Banks, actually resides in the Ducks' district boundaries and threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks but Philip didn't like the idea becasue he rather not let Adam play for Bombay's team. Philip and Ducksworth makes a deal with Reilly about the Hawks keeping Banks, however, Bombay refuses since it would be against fair-play, which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service.
