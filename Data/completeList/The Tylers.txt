[[File:The_Tyler's.jpg|thumb|The Tylers]]'''The Tylers''' are the little brothers of [[the Ashleys]].

They are all great friends and were once [[Randall Weems|Randall's]] snitches in the episode "[[League of Randalls]]" which was their one and only major appearance. They did not appear in any other episodes. They all have investments and all seems to be successful. They also have little sisters named [[The Brittany's|Brittany]].

Like their older sisters, they have a catchphrase called â€œNotorious!", which they will say in unison. Their appearance is similar to that of the Ashleys.
