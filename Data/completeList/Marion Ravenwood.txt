'''Marion Jones''' (formerly '''Williams''', née '''Ravenwood''') is [[Indiana Jones]]' love interest. She first appeared in the [[1981]] film ''{{WikipediaLink|Raiders of the Lost Ark}}''. Played by Karen Allen, she enters the story when Indy visits her in Nepal, needing her help. Specifically, he needs an artifact in her possession, originally obtained by her father, archaeologist Professor Abner Ravenwood (Jones' mentor), in order to locate the Ark of the Covenant.

After 27 years of absence (21 years in the films' internal chronology), the character returned in ''{{WikipediaLink|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull}}'', where she was once again played by Allen. There, she helps Indiana bring the Crystal Skulls to Akator and protect the treasure of the Interdimensional Beings from the hands of Irina Spalko and Mac Michael. The adventure rekindles their romance, and they marry at the end of the movie.
