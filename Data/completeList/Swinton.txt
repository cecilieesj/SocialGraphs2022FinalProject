==Background==
===Development===

In earlier drafts of the movie, Swinton was the mayor of [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] and the film's main antagonist. She led the conspiracy involving predators mysteriously disappearing, as she harbored a secret hatred towards that portion of Zootopia's population. She was portrayed as a calculated and highly intelligent leader, while animatics also imply her to be fairly vain.

Having a pig serve as the film's villain was partially inspired by the filmmakers' research; they discovered that pigs are amongst the most intelligent animals, which would make sense for a character leading a villainous operation while simultaneously fooling their people. The mayor was initially conceived as a pig not just to fit her intelligence, but also so that her appearance (a pink and soft animal) could be easily juxtaposed with her murderous, cold-blooded nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/05/zootopia-mayor-originally-female-pig/85243742/|title='Zootopia' mayor was originally a woman — and a pig

Eventually, Swinton's role as Zootopia's mayor was scrapped in favor of the generally well-intentioned [[Mayor Lionheart]]. The switch from Swinton to Lionheart was based on the common conception that lions are "king of the jungle", making it seem logical to cast a lion as the leader of an all-animal city. Bellwether, meanwhile, was given Swinton's role as the main antagonist whose plans stemmed from a hatred of carnivores. Lionheart also became Bellwether's primary target.

==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==
According to directors [[Byron Howard]] and [[Rich Moore]], Swinton remained in the final version of the movie, but was reworked to appear in a cameo role as a police warden watching over the arrested Bellwether during the [[Gazelle]] concert end credits.
