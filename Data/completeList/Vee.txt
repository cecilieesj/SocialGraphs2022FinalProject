'''Vee''' (also known as '''Number 5''') is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''. She is a basilisk who came to the human realm and took Luz's place.

==Background==
===Personality===
Vee is shown to be rather insecure about her identity as a basilisk and is fearful and wary of strangers. However, she became more comfortable after shapeshifting into an impostor of Luz. She then started living with Camila, easily deceiving her and others into thinking she was the real Luz for months. As the impostor, Vee is shown to be laid-back, opportunistic, and more toned down compared to the real Luz. She dislikes confrontation heavily, and when put under pressure or in troublesome situations, Vee can be left petrified for an extended period of time.

During her time in the human realm, Vee adapted quickly to human culture. She learnt cooking with Camila, studied Spanish, and familiarized herself with human devices.

===Powers and abilities===
Like all Basilisks, Vee has the ability to extract magic, which gives her powers, such as the ability to shapeshift.

==Role in the Series==
===Background===
Vee was part of a batch of basilisks that were brought back from extinction by [[Emperor Belos]] in order to study their ability to extract magic from living beings. Labeled as subject Number 5, Vee was put through various experiments where she was forced to extract magic from living creatures until they were completely drained, which she heavily detested doing. Eventually, she and a few other basilisks became fed up with the inhumane tests and escaped. However, it was only a matter of time before the Emperor recaptured them. On the day [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] came to the Boiling Isles, Vee went through the same [[Portal (The Owl House)|Portal]] to escape. Upon arrival, she met Luz's mother, [[Camila Noceda]]. She took on Luz's form to hide her true appearance. She never intended to stay with Camila, but she quickly grew close to her. She showed her the only kindness she had ever known all her life. Since then, she has been living with Camila, pretending to be Luz.

===Season Two===
By "[[Yesterday's Lie]]", her secret was exposed when Luz managed to regain contact with the Human realm. Despite Camila knowing the truth, she still managed to see was not a nasty creature, but an innocent child seeking a place of belonging. After saving her from a witch obsessed curator, Camila welcomed Vee to continue living with her, which she happily accepted.

==Trivia==
*Prior to her name being revealed, fans gave her the nickname "Creepy Luz". The name derived from an interview with [[Sarah-Nicole Robles]], the voice actor of them and the real Luz, when she described voicing "Creepy Luz" as her favorite moment in the studio.
**The description led fans to believe that the term referred to the existence of Luz's doppelgänger, until [[Dana Terrace]] clarified that this was a joke response to the line "''Maybe I'll meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman''" from "[[The First Day]]". In the same post, she acknowledged (though did not necessarily confirm) the possibility of the doppelgänger theory.
*Vee's name being derived from "Number 5", "V" in Roman numerals, seems to be an homage to ''V for Vendetta'', in which the main character is an escaped test subject turned terrorist who calls himself "V", with the later revelation that it's not actually a letter, but the Roman numeral on her cell, room number five.
*She is the second basilisk to appear in the show, followed by The Inspector from "[[The First Day]]".
**Unlike the Inspector, however, Vee is kind and doesn't want to harm others. Even though it is a basilisk's nature to drain magic while the harming the one they take it from.
**According to European bestiaries and legends, a basilisk is a legendary reptile reputed to be a serpent king, who can cause death with a single glance.
