The '''Wheelers''' are antagonists in the 1985 film, ''[[Return to Oz]]''. They are a group of bizarre, human-like beings with wheels for hands and feet who served Princess Mombi until her demise. They are lead by the [[Lead Wheeler]], who appears to fear Mombi the most. 

Although they serve as relatively minor characters in ''Return to Oz'', their cultural impact in the real-world remains significant, and are regarded as some of the more horrific and scariest characters to ever appear in a Disney film.
