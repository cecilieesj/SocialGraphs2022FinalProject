==Role in [[102 Dalmatians|the film]]==
Digger is first seen at the animal shelter with [[Drooler]], [[Chomp]], and [[Waddlesworth]]. When [[Kevin Shepherd|Kevin]] is introducing [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] to the dogs at Second Chance, he claims that Digger is banned from every park in [[London]] as a menace to roses. He is later seen with ''The Gang ''as they help rescue the puppies from [[Cruella De Vil]]. With the [[Dalmatian Puppies]]Dalmatian puppies squirting colored icing on her as a baked cake, Digger uses the rainbow sprinkles to add insult to injury. He is not seen throughout the rest of the film. Presumably, he finds a new home.

==Trivia==
*Digger was created solely for ''102 Dalmatians'' and has no animated counterpart.
