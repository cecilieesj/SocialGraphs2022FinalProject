==Personality==
Persephone is curious and flirtatious with [[Sparky (Frankenweenie)|Sparky]] and fiercely loyal to [[Elsa Van Helsing|Elsa]], her owner. When Persephone and Sparky first meet in the backyard, the attraction is instantaneous and electrifying.
==Physical appearance==
Persephone is a perfectly groomed black poodle with an enormously large poof of hair on her head. When she got electified by Sparky, her hair turned frizzy and gained a white lightning-shaped streak.
==Role in the film==
Persephone and Sparky first met when his ball rolled into her backyard. As he tried to get it out, he noticed Persephone trotting around inside the backyard. As Sparky sat down in his backyard, sad that he lost the ball, Persephone rolls the ball back into his yard.
