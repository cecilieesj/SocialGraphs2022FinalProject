'''Dang Hu''' is a minor antagonist in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''. She served as the elderly chieftess of [[Talon (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Talon]] in [[Kumandra]], during the [[Druun]] calamity. Cunning and villainous, Dang Hu used the Drunn to advance her power and assert her authority over her enemies.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Dang Hu is an elderly Asian woman who wears the purple and pink color scheme clothing of her Kumandra tribe, Talon.

===Personality===
At first glance, Dang Hu seems like a harmless old woman and does not seem like a threat. However, it is a mask to hide her true self to outsiders who come to Talon. Dang Hu is very manipulative as she gained Sisu's trust by coming to her rescue from angry civilians when the water dragon naively tried to buy gifts for credit. Dang Hu even managed a trick Sisu by offering her help, but wasn't until she took Sisu to the outskirts of her village where the Druun lurked that Dang Hu revealed her true colors as a cold and ruthless individual.

Dang Hu was also extremely greedy as she desired to collect the other pieces of the [[Dragon Gem]] and keep it to herself. She was willing to go through any lengths to get what she wanted where she threatened to have Sisu be petrified by the Druun, showing Dang Hu has no concern over others' well-being. Dang Hu even mocked Sisu for easily trusting her and showed no remorse in hurting the dragon's feelings, showing how completely heartless and cruel Dang Hu was.

==Role in the film==
Five years later, after the Druun's release and the destruction of the Dragon Gem, Dang Hu became the chieftess of [[Talon (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Talon]] after [[Dang Hai]] had been petrified by the Druun.
