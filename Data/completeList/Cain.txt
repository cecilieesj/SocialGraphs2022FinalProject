==Role in the series==
Cain is the alpha wolf of an elite wolf pack in the episode "[[The Coming of the Wolves]]". [[Akela]] and his mate, [[Leah]], were once part of Cain's pack. At one point, however, Cain reveals that he has had feelings for Leah and wanted her all to himself, but she rejects him. Akela and Leah then decide to leave the pack. When Cain and his pack give chase in an attempt to kill the two wolf traitors, Akela and Leah manage to escape and seek refuge in the [[Ancient Ruins|lair]] without knowing it belongs to the cubs. After [[Colonel Hathi|Hathi]] panics at the sight of the two wolves and flees, Akela and Leah laugh awkwardly and decide to rest where they are.

Sometime later, the cubs have a falling-out with Akela and Leah, who both eventually decide to leave. However, when Cain and his pack arrive at the lair and plan to attack, Akela and the cubs all stand up to him. Akela and Cain then engage in a brutal fight over Leah. In the aftermath, Akela defeats Cain and then orders him to leave the cubs' lair and never return. Cain picks himself up and reluctantly does so.
