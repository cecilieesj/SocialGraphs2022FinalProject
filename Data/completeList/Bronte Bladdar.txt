'''Bronte Bladdar''', or simply '''Ms. Bladdar''', is a recurring character from the animated TV Series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is the unenthusiastic teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] who does not seem to like her job all that much.

==Background==
Bronte Bladdar is the English teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]], or rather she is supposed to be, but due to the mysterious constant absence of the art teacher Ms. Ford, Bladdar usually finds herself doing her job, seemingly against her will. She does not seem to care much about [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] and her friends and usually takes part in events simply so that she can get away from teaching such as in "[[Quiz Bowl]]" where she drove them out of town for a competition. However, she did take part in the strike in the episode "[[Strike it or Not]]", showing that she does at least care about being compensated. In that same episode, she claimed that she became a teacher because she was "looking for a man"; revealing that she is single.

Bladdar is absent in "[[The Finale]]", implying that at some point after Pepper Ann graduated, she finally left her teaching position.

===Personality===
Bladdar is completely aloof and in a constant state of boredom. She shows little concern for the things happening around her and could quite possibly be the only truly sane character on the show. She was the only person completely immune to [[Milo Kamalani]]'s horrendous artwork in "[[The Environ-Mentals]]", though she was still annoyed at it, and is at least confident enough to know that the kids can handle themselves without her around. She seems to give off a cool vibe as whenever she is onscreen, the music plays a cool rhythm.

===Physical appearance===
Bladdar is a tall Caucasian woman black hair that drips over her, vaguely resembling ink, brown glasses where the lenses cover her eyes and red lipstick. She wears a white shirt, a maroon button up shirt above it, blue jeans and yellow shoes.

==Trivia==
*Her personality and appearance is similar to that of Jane Lane from ''Daria''.
