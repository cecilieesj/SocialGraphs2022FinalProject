==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
Following a massive battle between the Martins and the Coys, Henry tries to hunt for something but saw a figure thinking it was a hillbilly or an animal until Henry noticed that it was Grace Martin who was trying to attract him. Instead of using his rifle against her, Henry falls in love with Grace and just as she looks at him, he finally falls in love with her much to the other Martins and the Coys ire. 

Ultimately, he and Grace dance together in a hoedown and get married to which they continued their married lives. However Henry and Grace sometimes have martial spats which lead to fighting, this pleases the rest of the Coys and Martins who are glad their feud lives on in some way.

== Notes ==
* Though the two are described as fighting, Henry is only seen shielding himself from Grace's blows.
