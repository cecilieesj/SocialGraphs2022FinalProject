'''Marci McFist'''Â is a supporting character in ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.

==Personality==
Marci is sweet and kind, deeply loving her husband and her son. However, she is overprotective of her son, always spoiling him and never noticing or believing that Bash is a troublemaker. She also knows that McFist is evil, but she isn't bothered by it and even loves it when he gets thrilled at finding a way to defeat the Ninja. She seems to always get what she wants, like the biggest tree for the McFist Industries Christmas party in "[[Silent Punch, Deadly Punch]]", McFist helping Bash with his science project in "[[Attack of the Killer Potatoes]]", and McFist and Viceroy giving Bash pranks to use on his fellow classmates in "[[Pranks for Nothing]]". While usually calm in comparison to her husband, Marci gets frustated at McFist for not calling out for someone to help Bash in "[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]", and she is so angry at McFist attempting to destroy her son that apparently, she is even angrier at him than the Sorcerer is at him for failing in "[[Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja]]".

==Appearance==
===Everyday===
Marci is tall and blonde hair, blue eyes, and a beauty mark under her left eye. She wears a light blue dress with a dark gray collar, buttons, and a belt, and she wears dark gray high heels. She also has a golden bracelet on her right wrist.

==Role in the series==
She is [[Hannibal McFist]]'s loving wife and [[Bash Johnson]]'s mother. She is supportive of her husband destroying [[Randy Cunningham|the ninja]], though she is blissfully unaware that her son is the biggest bully in school even when she and Hannibal are often called in by [[Principal Slimovitz]].

==Relationships==
===[[Hannibal McFist]]===
Marci dearly loves her husband. She often takes advantage of him by having him get her things she wants, which he usually agrees to do. Sometimes, she encourages the often reluctant McFist to hang out with her son or give him things. If McFist mistreats or endangers her son, though, she calls him out for it or gets very angry, like in "[[Best Buds]]", where she tells McFist that he and Bash to have to win the Best Buds competition or else the two have to go on a camping trip. When he comes home late with Viceroy from PJ's, Marci also appears to be displeased with him in "[[McFreaks]]". Marci accepts and supports McFist's ambition to destroy the Ninja, and she even keeps it a secret from Bash. In "[[McOne Armed and Dangerous]]", along with Viceroy, she desperately tries to warns McFist that his microphone is on while he threatens the Ninja. McFist might be evil, but she truly cares for him and isn't bothered by it at all, even thinking's he cute when he can't wait to defeat the Ninja in "[[House of 1,000 Boogers]]".

===[[Bash Johnson]]===
Everyone else, including McFist, knows that Bash is a bully and a jerk, but Marci doesn't notice and can't believe that her son would do anything wrong. Marci is always spoiling Bash, in part by persuading McFist to give him what he wants and helping him with school work. Not wanting Bash to know that McFist is after the Ninja, Marci seems to keep it a secret from him, like in "McOne Armed and Dangerous", where she covers his ears from the accusations that McFist is a villain.

===[[Randy Cunningham]]/Norrisville Ninja===
Marci has only met Randy (when he's not the Ninja) in "House of 1,000 Boogers", suggesting that he and Howard go play the McFissue. In "When Howie Met Randy" it's revealed that Randy and Howard attending in a daycare center attended by Marci before she married McFist. As for Randy as the Ninja, Marci is okay with McFist trying to destroy him, but thanks him for saving her from the rampaging Robo-Apes in "[[Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes]]".

==Trivia==
*Marci has a bit of a Canadian or Upper Midwestern American accent, although it's unknown if it means she's Canadian or from one of the North-Central American states such as Minnesota or Wisconsin, don'tcha know?
**Marci's landing in a barrel of cheese in "[[When Howie Met Randy]]" may be an oblique reference to Wisconsin, whose inhabitants are known as "cheeseheads."
*Marci is the only mother of a character who has appeared in the show (unlike Bucky's mom, who has only been heard).
**She is also one of the few wives to appear in the show.
*She has gotten angry at McFist twice so far. The first time was in "Bash Johnson: 11th Grade Ninja" (although it is indicated by McFist and not actually shown) and the second time was "Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes" when Hannibal refrains from asking anyone to save Bash.
*Marci is one of the few people in Norrisville who knows McFist is evil besides Viceroy, Randy, and Howard.
*Even though Bash has seen while not put together that McFist is out to get the Ninja, Marci tries to hide the truth by covering Bash's ears when the Ninja reveals McFist's true nature.
*Despite Marci's being McFist's wife, neither of them our ever seen wearing wedding rings
*Bash is actually McFist's stepson; Marci's first husband has still never been seen or heard.
