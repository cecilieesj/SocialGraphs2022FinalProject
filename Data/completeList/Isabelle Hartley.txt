'''Isabelle Hartley''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appeared in the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episodes "[[Shadows]]" and "[[One Door Closes]]". She was sent by [[Robert Gonzales]] to steal [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s intel.

==Trivia==
*Isabelle Hartley appeared in ''Dark Avengers'' #11. In the comics, she is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and former girlfriend of [[Victoria Hand]] who also appeared in the series. Neither directly addresses their relationship, though it has been confirmed, due to the writers' fear of facing backlash for killing off two LGBT+ characters.
