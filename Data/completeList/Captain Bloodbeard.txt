==Background==
===Personality===
Bloodbeard appears to be grumpy, greedy, and rude to his crew. He later softens up when the three old ladies from the other ship get on his ship to stop him from making [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] walk the plank.

===Physical Description===
Captain Bloodbeard is a tall pirate with a black hat with a large pink feather at the top, an eye patch, orange beard, a red coat, a white shirt, brown pants, and white socks. Like every pirate captain, he has a hook that replaces one hand and a peg leg that replaces one leg.

==Role in the series==
When an employment asks Timon and Pumbaa what job they would like to have, Pumbaa says that he would like to be a pirate. Timon reluctantly takes Pumbaa's suggestion. When Timon and Pumbaa are on a pirate ship, Captain Bloodbeard appears and makes his pirate crew and Pumbaa work and has Timon be his parrot.

After Bloodbeard throws all the other pirates off the ship, he makes Pumbaa raise the pirate flag, which the warthog puts a smiley face on in place of a skeleton. When Bloodbeard is about to throw Pumbaa off the ship, he sees another ship with three old ladies with treasure and wants to steal it. Pumbaa refuses to do so and he decides to mess things up when Bloodbeard gives him orders.

After Bloodbeard has had enough of Timon and Pumbaa disobeying him, he chases the two, captures them, and makes them walk the plank. The three old ladies get on his ship and stop him. While the women pamper Timon and Pumbaa, Bloodbeard is now playing the parrot.
