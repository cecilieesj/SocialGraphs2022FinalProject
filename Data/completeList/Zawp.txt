He is designed to annoy people with his loud snoring. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her "cats."

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 077 was the 77th genetic experiment created by Jumba with [[Jacques von Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to annoy people by snoring loudly. 077 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s yard, 077's pod being one of them.

At an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 077's pod for an apricot and washed it, activating the experiment. However, as 077 was not a very evil or destructive experiment, he was able to live a peaceful life with her, due to the latter seeing the former as a mere stray cat who needed a home, though he frequently snored loudly.

When [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] discovered that Mrs. Hasagawa kept several experiments as pets, they thought they were a danger to her and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], decided to capture them all. 077's capture was easy, as Lilo simply woke the sleeping experiment up and led him into a container, where he continued napping.

077 and the other experiments were about to be taken away, but were returned to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. 077 was then named Zawp.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Zawp was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 547 instead of 077.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Zawp, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Zawp participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Zawp was activated off-screen.
*In "[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]", Zawp erroneously appeared with Gantu's other captive experiments, but he was already living with Mrs. Hasagawa, and Lilo and Stitch discovered him while Gantu was asleep.
*Zawp is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
