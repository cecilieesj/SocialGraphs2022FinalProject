==History==
===Before the Third Curse===
After [[Emma Swan|Emma]] and her allies arrive in Camelot, a ball is held in their honor, where Henry develops a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet.

After getting to know each other, Violet brings Henry to her family's stables. After Henry asks if she can take him riding, she takes him outside to meet her horse, Nicodemus.

Later, as Violet is brushing Nicodemus, Henry asks how she got the horse. Violet explains that her mother gave Nicodemus to her, but passed away soon after. Henry tells her about losing his father as well, allowing them to share a moment. Later, after she returns from getting Nicodemus' saddle ready, she finds a note from Henry asking her to meet him at Granny's Diner. Before she can leave however, Emma approaches Violet asking if she can keep a secret. As Emma needs a tear from a broken heart to free Merlin from the tree, she rips Violet's heart from her chest, promising to return it once Violet breaks Henry's heart. Under the control of Emma, Violet meets Henry that night at the diner. When Henry mentions a date, Violet asks if he is courting her, and after he confirms this, Violet states she does not feel the same way, saying that she prefers to be friends, after Henry suspects that her father told her to stay away from him.

===After the Third Curse===
When the third Dark Curse is cast by Hook, Violet arrives in Storybrooke alongside her father and other residents of Camelot. On the night of her arrival, Violet comes across a jukebox in Granny's, unsure of what it is. Henry approaches, and puts money in to play a song for her. Violet gets an odd feeling she had heard the song before, unaware that she had heard it six weeks prior in Camelot, as her memories had been erased by the Curse. Because of this, she also does not remember meeting Henry at the ball, and introduces herself to him again.

Emma, regretful about what she did to Henry in Camelot, purposely lets Nicodemus loose, allowing Henry to be violet's hero by saving the horse. Later, Henry persuades her to attend the town party to briefly forget about her worries. She declines, and Henry promises to help find the horse. She later attends the party with her father, but is still sad about the horse. Suddenly, Henry enters the town square with Nicodemus, making Violet very happy. As her father leaves to take Nicodemus to the stables, Violet thanks Henry, and gives him a kiss on the cheek.

Violet and Henry eventually broke up and he ended up falling in love with [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] who he would go on and marry. Nothing was known about Violet following her break up with Henry.
