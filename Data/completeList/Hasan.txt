{{Quote|What you seek, is seeking you|Hasan to [[Aisha]]|Time and Again}}
'''Hasan''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. He was first mentioned in the [[Crushed (Ms. Marvel)|second episode]] of the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'' and made his only appearance in the [[Time and Again|fifth episode]] episode of the series. He is portrayed by starring cast member, Fawad Khan.

Hasan is the father of [[Sana Ali]] and the husband of [[Aisha]]. He lived in British Occupied India, but was forced out of his home, during the Partition, due the discrimination he and his family faced, being Muslim. Hasan learns of his wife’s mystic nature and she is lost to him among the masses, while migrating. He briefly loses Sana too, until a trail of stars, lead her back to him. The pair resettle in Karachi, in what would eventually become, Pakistan.

Hasan is based on the character '''Kareem''', who was originally created by writer, G. Willow Wilson, and artists, Takeshi Miyazawa & Adrian Alphona.

==Background==
Hasan lives in a village in British Occupied India, and is born to a Muslim family. Tensions rise, with the presence of the British, and encouragement of a two-state solution is introduced. Hasan lives in the cottage his father built him, and begins growing roses in his garden, which he sells. At some point, he injures his leg, and takes an old branch, which he uses as a walking stick.

In 1942, Hasan protests for the end of British rule in India, and calls for unity between Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs. The British Soldiers arrive and put an end to Hasan’s speech, ordering him and those listening to disperse.

Hasan heads to his rose garden, and finds [[Aisha|a woman]] sleeping. He pokes her with his stick, and she threatens to break his leg. He laughs it off and points to his leg which is already broken. He offers her his help, but she refuses, and he informs her that he has food and a place to rest in his cottage, should she change her mind.

Later that evening, the woman arrives, and Hasan offers her a plate of food. He questions who she is, but the woman eats in silence. Hasan asks what brought her to them, and she gives admiration for his roses. He recites his favorite poem, which he thought of, upon seeing her sleeping in his garden, "When the soul lies down in that grass. The world is too full to talk about. What you seek is seeking you...". She reveals her name is Aisha. He gives her the meaning as “she who lives”, and compliments it, for its beauty. He introduces himself as Hasan, and the pair continues talking.

Time eventually passes, and Hasan and Aisha fall in love and get married. Aisha becomes expectant with Hasan’s child.
One day while Hasan is tending to his garden, Aisha offers Hasan an actual walking stick in exchange of the old wooden branch he currently uses. He comments on the irony, as she threatened to initially break his leg when they first met. She thanks him for making a home for her, and Hasan lays his hands on her pregnant stomach.

Aisha eventually gives birth, and Hasan becomes father to a girl, whom they name [[Sana Ali|Sana]].

One day, Aisha sings to her daughter, and Hasan remarks that Sana looks at her mother, as though she were magical.

A few more years pass and religious unrest continues sweeping across the nation. Uncertainty and fear have spread across the country and turned to bloodshed. Hasan begins facing further discrimination, and his family’s businesses are boycotted.

One night, [[Rohan]] arrives with an offering of milk and vegetables for Hasan and his family. Hasan snaps and ask that Rohan keep his charity. Rohan calls him out for always calling for unity, while currently playing into the hands of British. Hasan argues that unlike him, his family isn’t suffering as a result of being Muslim. When Rohan leaves, Hasan notes his wife’s shocked expression, when he she opens the door. He later observes her talking to an [[Najma|unknown woman]], outside their home.

With the riots spreading, Aisha decides they must leave. Hasan is heartbroken at the prospect of leaving everything they built together, but Sana assures him that so long as they have each other, they can build a new home, and recites the poem he read to her.

The family head to the station, but Hasan struggles to keep up with his injuries. Hasan questions who the mysterious woman is, that Aisha was talking to, the night before. She sits him down, and showcases her [[bangle]], and recalls how he always referred to her as magical. The bangle extends, and an inscription materializes, before his eyes. The bangle begins to glow, before returning back to its original state. Hasan questions why Aisha has chosen now to tell him. She shares that she suspected Hasan knew she was running from something, but Hasan tells her he didn’t persist on any answers, because he didn’t care what her reasons were, and that she chose them. Aisha tells her husband that she’s still choosing them, and has him promise that Sana will board the train safety. Hasan assures her nothing will happen.

The pair makes their way through the crowds, when Aisha turns back and alerts Hasan that Sana isn’t safe. She hands him their daughter, and asks he fulfill his promise, as she moves away from him, and into the masses. Hasan calls out for his wife, but can’t seem to locate her. Hasan makes his way to the train, but loses sight of Sana, who has also left his side, in search for her mother. He continuously calls out for his daughter and turns back to search for her, but his injuries halt his efforts. He looks through the hordes of people, when he sees Sana, being lead to him by fragments of light, resembling stars. Hasan believes this to be the work of Aisha, and grabs hold of his daughter, so they can board the train together.

The pair now separated from Aisha, resettle in Karachi, Pakistan together. Hasan eventually tells his daughter that Aisha was a [[Djinn]]. Various rumors also begin circulating around Aisha, which includes her being cursed, her infidelity, having a secret family and being a murder, all of which plague Hasan's family for generations.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Hasan was originally called Kareem. The change was likely due to another character in the series ([[Red Dagger]]), sharing the same name.
