{{Quote|Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!|[[Captain Hook]]|Peter Pan (film)}}
The '''Pirate Crew''' are [[Captain Hook]]'s henchmen in the [[1953]] film, ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.
==Members==
<tabber>
Mr. Smee=
[[File:Smee.png|150px|left]]'''[[Mr. Smee]]''' is Captain Hook's loyal first mate, though his bumbling behavior often prevents him from being much help. Contrast to his megalomaniacal captain, Smee is soft-spoken and genial. He nevertheless enjoys piracy, and longs to abandon Neverland in favor of returning to a life of plunder along the seven seas.
|-|Turk=
[[File:June912.gif|150px|left]]'''Turk''' a member of Captain Hook's pirate crew, this fat mustachioed pirate carrying a razor-sharp sabre was (at some point after 2001) transported to Wasteland, where he served under the Animatronic Hook. When most of the Tortooga Pirates were taken over by the Pirate Conversion Machine and turned into monsters, Turk, along with several other pirates, escaped Tortooga and tried to make a new life for themselves in Ventureland, finally letting go of their thuggish ways. In Ventureland, Turk met the love of his life, Henrietta, which finished turning him around.
|-|Black Murphy=
[[File:June910.gif|150px|left]]'''Black Murphy''' is a fearsome two-timing scoundrel. Murphy's weapon of choice is a dagger often clenched between his teeth. Murphy is among the members of Hook's crew who particularly resent being stuck in Neverland and wishes they'd return to ordinary plunder and pillage.
|-|Mullins=
[[File:Mira73.gif|150px|left]]'''Mullins''' Mullins is as unpleasant and murderous a character as the rest of his shipmates.
|-|Bill Jukes=
[[File:Mira74.gif|150px|left]]'''Bill Jukes''' is older than most other crew members, but don't let his peg-leg and shortness fool you — he is far from the least dangerous pirate aboard.
|-|Starkey=
[[File:June916.gif|150px|left]]
'''Starkey''' is best-known for his habit of fighting with two blades at a time (a sword and a dagger). Fearsome in battle, Mr. Starkey is however quite a superstitious man, and at least at first he was hesitant to fight the apparently-supernatural Peter Pan.
|-|Wibbles=
[[File:June915.gif|150px|left]]'''Wibbles''' is as unpleasant and murderous a character as the rest of his shipmates, known for using a sword and gun simultaneously.
|-|Mr. Tattoo=
[[File:Peterpan-disneyscreencaps-6996.jpg|150px|left]]Mr. Tattoo is a heavily tattooed man was taken by Hook as an example of his special offer of giving new crew-members a free tattoo when he was trying to entice the Darling children and the Lost Boys to join him.
|-|Skylights=
[[File:Peterpan-disneyscreencaps-2265.jpg|150px|left]]'''Skylights''' was unusually philosophical about the pirate condition, conscious that it was a thrilling but often quite short kind of life. This he conveyed through endless discordant singing, which so got on the nerves of the Captain that Skylights' lyrics were prematurely validated by an annoyed Hook shooting Skylights stone-dead to stop the singing already.
|-|Mr. Chef=
[[File:Chef.png|150px|left]]'''Mr. Chef''' worked as a chef on the Jolly Roger. He was rarely ever seen out of the ship's kitchens. It is unknown if he still works for Captain Hook, or if he was fired or killed or reformed.
|-|Sharky=
[[File:124722 SHARKY.jpg|150px|left]]'''Sharky''' is nonetheless loyal to Captain Hook and eagerly obeys him to the best of his abilities. Much of Sharky's past hadn't been revealed until season four of the series, where it is revealed he is the last member of the Dark-Shark Clan a tribe of ninja like warriors task with guarding Never Land from a monstrous shark like creature known as the Shudder thought to be trying to destroy Never Land. It's currently unknown why Sharky despite his origin and background serves under Captain Hook.
|-|Bones=
[[File:124722 BONES.jpg|150px|left]]'''Bones''' is nonetheless loyal to Captain Hook and eagerly obeys him as best as he can. While he does have his moments when he prefers to play music over following Hook's command, as seen in the episode "Escape from Belch Mountain", when Hook entrusts the Jolly Roger to both Sharky and Bones, who quickly begin playing a catchy musical number once Hook is gone, which accidentally reveals Hook's plot to Jake and his crew, who over hear hiding near by. Bones is definitely considered the dimmest of Hook's crew, but over the course of the series, has rare moments of intelligence.
|-|The Parrot=
[[File:Hook'sparrot.png|150px|left]]'''[[The Parrot]]''' is the pet of [[Captain Hook]]. The Parrot's appearance may have been similar to [[José Carioca]], except he had a peg leg.

==Appearances==
===''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''===
The crew is first seen on their ship, the [[Jolly Roger]], in [[Neverland]], singing "[[A Pirate's Life (Is a Wonderful Life)]]". Although they served under Captain Hook, it is implied that they grew bored of him, because they spent their time in the aforementioned song throwing swords at a crudely drawn picture labeled "Captain" that was drawn on the cabin door. When [[Mr. Smee|Smee]], the first mate, comes out of the cabin, he wishes them a good morning, but they grab him by the shirt and tell him that there's nothing good about the morning because they're stuck on Neverland. Wishing to give up the quest for [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], they bully Smee into trying to convince Captain Hook to leave Neverland. One of them is then shown in the rigging with an accordion, singing (rather badly) until an annoyed Captain Hook offhandedly shoots him with a flintlock pistol for interrupting his concentration.

Later on, when Peter Pan, [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]], [[John Darling|John]], and [[Michael Darling|Michael]] return to Neverland, one of the crew spots them and Hook orders the crew to shoot the cannons at them. The crew tries to shoot at them, knowing that the sooner Peter dies, the sooner they all get to leave Neverland. Luckily, they manage to escape. Later on, after Captain Hook has an encounter with Peter Pan, he manages to capture his fairy friend, [[Tinker Bell]] and tricks her into telling him where his hideout, [[Hangman's Tree]], is and then he locks her up in a lantern and takes the crew with him to Hangman's Tree with a [[Bomb (Peter Pan)|bomb]] wrapped as a present for Peter from Wendy. When Hook, Smee, and the crew arrive there, they hear Wendy singing "[[Your Mother and Mine]]". Here, the crew, among with Smee, is shown to be visibly sad, implying that they lost their mothers at an early age and it was this that drove them to become pirates. When Wendy, John, Michael, and the [[Lost Boys]] come out to return home, they are captured by the crew, who take them back to the ship while Hook and Smee stay behind to put the bomb inside for Peter.

On the ship, the crew sings to the children about joining them or walking the plank. Wendy tells Captain Hook that they will never join them. They tie the boys up, take Wendy to the plank, and make her walk to the end and fell down to the sea. Captain Hook listen for the splash, but no sound comes. Unbeknownst to the crew, Peter saved Wendy just in time before she landed in the water, for he survived the bomb thanks to Tinker Bell going to his rescue upon escaping from the lantern upon learning of it. Still mad at his crew who were fearfully believed that the ship was bewitched, Captain Hook then throws one of them, Starkey, into the sea. He then learns that Peter is still alive. Then he and Peter start the sword fight. Peter released the boys to join the battle. Captain Hook order his crew to get them. John told the Lost Boys to fire the crew with their weapons, but the crew is ready to climb to the net to battle them. Tinker Bell gets Peter to tell him they are in trouble. Using his dagger, he flies to the net to cut the rope and the crew falls down to the rowboat with Smee and head to the sea. They're  then rowing the boat away from Neverland while Captain Hook was swimming away by his nemesis, the [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]].

===''[[Return to Never Land]]''===
[[File:Peterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-2156.jpg|thumb|250px|Pirate Crew in ''Return to Neverland'']]In ''Return to Neverland'', the crew still listens to Captain Hook and actually come with him to [[London]] to kidnap Wendy. However, they accidentally kidnap her daughter, [[Jane (Peter Pan)|Jane]], (perhaps because they were not aware of the change of time since time has virtually stopped in Neverland). They follow Captain Hook's orders to the letter, as they join him in searching for Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. They also join him in the search of his treasure chest and the fight against Jane and the Lost Boys. Near the end of the film, the crew (along with Captain Hook and Smee) is chased away by the [[Octopus (Peter Pan)|octopus]] (who imagines them all to be different kinds of fish).

===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
{{main|Sharky and Bones}}

=== [[The Pirate Fairy|Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy]]===
Several members of Captain Hook's pirate crew appear in this film as secondary characters. Given names and speaking parts, this movie is functionally a prequel for the pirates prior to the events of Peter Pan. Several members of the crew are recognizable, despite the switch to 3D animation, post-Return to Neverland. The only notable difference is the number of crewmates and their noticeable youth.

Aside from Tinker Bell herself, this is the first occurrence of Disney characters making the jump from 2-to-3-D animation. Following this, [[Ralph Breaks the Internet]] also incorporated previously 2-D characters.

===Other appearances===
In ''[[House of Mouse]]'', the crew appears in a cameo with Captain Hook and Mr. Smee. They sing "[[It's Our House Now]]" with the Disney villains in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
The crew appears in the second season on the show, in flashbacks concerning Captain Hook. One is when he meets [[Milah]], [[Rumplestiltskin]]'s ex-wife loses his hand by facing the [[Rumplestiltskin|crocodile]] and the other is when he meets [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]] at Neverland.

==Video games ==
===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', Smee is on the boat in Ventus' story of the game and he calls out to the crew to fire cannonballs at Ventus and Peter. The part of the crew in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' is played by numerous [[Heartless]] instead of the original characters, presumably having been disposed of once Hook joined [[Maleficent]]'s alliance.

===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===
The crew's Wasteland counterparts once lived in Tortooga until Captain Hook was forcibly converted into a [[Beetleworx]] at Skull Island and many of them were captured and converted as well. Smee and a few others, including Damien Salt and Scurvy Pat, escaped to Venture Land and have been trying to settle in there.

===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===
The crew is seen during the ''Peter Pan's Flight'' mini-game. They are first seen holding Cubby hostage in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of Peter Pan. When he and the player arrive, however, Captain Hook orders his crew to attack. They do so by blasting cannons at both Peter and the player. By reflecting the cannonballs, the player is able to defeat the crew and go after Captain Hook.

=== [[Disney Sorcerer's Arena|''Disney Sorcerer's Arena'']] ===
Turk / Damien Salt, named in-game as '''Jolly Roger Pirate''' or '''Jolly Roger Crew''', appears as both a basic Oceanic Villain enemy and summonable teammate in ''Disney Sorcerer's Arena.'' Jolly Roger Pirates appear several times throughout the game's campaigns as enemies, having a Basic attack using his sabre, and two Special abilities: A muscle flex which grants a targeted teammate Offense Up and Crit Chance Up, and a jaunty dance which gives the Jolly Roger Pirate a Taunt, forcing opponents to target them. One of Smee's Special abilities, "All Hands on Deck!", has him summon a Jolly Roger Pirate onto his team, with the same Basic and Specials as before. Smee can summon multiple Jolly Roger Pirates throughout a match, and when playing in Club Conquest, can summon up to 3 Jolly Roger Pirates at once.

==Trivia==
*Although the crew is implied to dislike Captain Hook's obsession to kill Peter Pan and their wish to leave Neverland to sail for treasure again in the original film, the sequel doesn't depict the crew complaining about Captain Hook's attempts to kill Peter and even enjoy aiding him on his plot to kidnap Peter and the Lost Boys despite still fearing Captain Hook, like most Disney henchmen fearing their boss (except for the [[villagers]] and [[Gaston's Buddies|Gaston's four stooges]], who show no fear to Gaston in the original ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', but not the [[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|live action remake]]). Thus, one can assume that after finding the treasure, the crew may have started to appreciate Captain Hook more than before and that maybe they grew to hate Peter over the years given his constant attacks on them.
**Another possibility is that they may be loyal to Captain Hook because he took them under his wing to teach them how to be pirates and that maybe Hook promised them to return to loot ships once they got rid of Peter Pan. In the deleted song "[[I'll Give You One Guess]]" from the second film, Jukes mentions that he was just a kid when Hook took him in and showed him a sailor's life, and Turk and Starkey then follow saying that Peter evaded them for so long and that now that they will get rid of him they will sail out to rob and plunder. As the song was deleted, however, the canon status of these statements is up for debate.
*Starkey, the crew member Captain Hook threw overboard, was his first mate and butler in the original novel, while Smee was the boatswain. Interestingly, in the original novel, he and Smee were the only two pirates to survive.
*The only pirate member names that were confirmed were Wibbles, Bill Jukes, Black Murphy, Mullins, Turk, Starkey, Skylights, and Damien Salt. It is unknown if all of the unnamed pirate crew members will have confirmed names from the play and/or novel.
*Mullins and 4 unnamed pirates are the only pirates who have patches on their right eye.
*It is unknown if Mullins's right eye was either damaged or not.
*The only pirate that died was Skylights, who played the accordion on top of Captain Hook's ship (much to the latter's annoyance that he shoots Skylights down).
*Jukes, the peglegged pirate in the Disney version, was described as a pirate with tattoos in the original novel. Also during the final battle in the play and novel, when he was given orders by Hook to fetch the cat o nine tails for the children, Jukes was either the first or second pirate to be killed by Peter.
*It is revealed that there are various members part of Hook's crew as shown in scenes along with the others.
*While the pirates tried to pursue John, Michael, and the lost boys, an unnamed one eye pink shirt pirate can be scene climbing along with Wibbles, Jukes, Turk, and the rest of the pirates (offscreen) and would later fall, along with all of the other pirates of the crew after Peter cuts the rope.
*The rest of the crew does not appear in "Jake and the Neverland Pirates", which presumably took place after Peter Pan.
*It could be implied that one eye pink shirt pirate is his twin brother since most of them look alike, both of them have a patch on their right eye.
*Many of the pirates are likely descended from other foreign countries as presumed by some of their accents and mannerisms: Turk appears to be Indian, Arabian, or even Moroccan, Black Murphy seems to be French or Canadian, Skylights seems to be Italian, Wibbles seems to be Swedish, Mullins appears to be German, and Jukes seems to be Scottish or Irish.
*As shown in "[[Your Mother and Mine]]", it could be implied that some of the pirates in the crew (as well as Mr. Smee) lost their mothers at a young age and/or missed them so dearly.
