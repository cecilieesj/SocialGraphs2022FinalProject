'''Francis "KG" Leibowitz-Jenkins''' is a new character in the [[Disney+]] Original Series ''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]]''. He is the adopted son of an interracial gay married couple Barry and Randall Leibowitz-Jenkins and twin brother of [[Maya Leibowitz-Jenkins]].

==Background==

===Personality===
KG is a ''big gamer''; in fact, itâ€™s rare to see him without his console in hand. Unlike Maya, he instantly becomes part of the popular in-crowd at school because of his nonchalant persona and never-ending usage of the word "sheeeesh."<ref>[https://d23.com/meet-the-new-characters-of-the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder/ Meet the New Characters of The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]</ref> Unlike his sister Maya, he was cool with Penny when they first met.

===Physical appearance===
KG is a young African-American boy of average height with brown dreads that are dyed orange on the tips. He always wears a blue backwards cap, a purple and white hoodie with a grey t-shirt sticking out from underneath. Dark blue denim jeans and white, grey and purple sneakers. He is always seen carrying what resembles a yellow PSP.

===Abilities===
KG is shown to be technologically gifted. Aside from his love of games, he is shown to also be smart at tinkering with technology such as his drones.

==Trivia==
*The system that KG uses has a uncanny resemblance to the original [[Wikipedia:Game Boy Advance|GameBoy Advance]].
*In "[[Get In]]", Maya reveals that she is a Virgo and she just turned 14. This would most likely mean that KG is a Virgo as well.
*The character acts a pseudo replacement for [[Sticky Webb]] as both have a strong love for technology and show a slight interest in Penny. Additionally, Dijonay is obsessed with him the same way she was obsessed with Sticky.
*KG, along with Maya, are the third and fourth characters in Disney animation to have two fathers, after [[Violet Sabrewing]] in ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' and [[Willow Park]] in ''[[The Owl House]]'', and the first African-Americans to do so. They are also the first human characters to have homosexual parents, due to Violet being a bird and Willow being a witch.
*In "[[Home School]]", KG is revealed to be a fan of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' franchise.
