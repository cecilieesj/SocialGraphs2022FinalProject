'''The Devil'''Â is one of the residents of [[Halloween Town]] in the film, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''.

==Background==
===Physical Description===
The Devil is a red-skinned person with horns, black pointy beard, a horny tail, and wearing a black robe.
===Personality===
He often acts sneaky and always speaks in a sinister tone. However, like most of the residents of Halloween Town, he loves to sing and may just be a monster doing his job rather than the actual Devil. He also finds the Pox disease to be delightful.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===
The Devil joined in with the citizens of the Halloween Town while they sing "[[This is Halloween]]" song. As [[Jack Skellington]] talks to the residents about Christmas, he's with the residents as he sees the present and says it was a "pox" rather than saying "box".

While everybody's making a Halloween-version of Christmas gifts during the song "[[Making Christmas]]", he works with Corpse Dad and Wolfman to create the scary-version of a teddy bear Scary Teddy. However, it turns out that the Christmas plan done by the Citizens of Halloween Town was a bad idea.

During the end of the film when Jack Skellington is shown to have survived, the Devil, holding a lantern, happily rejoiced with Jack back in Halloween Town. While he and the other citizens celebrate Jack's return, the citizens suddenly see snow falling on Halloween Town, thanks to Jack who rescued Santa from Oogie Boogie in order to save Christmas.
