In Greek mythology, Boreas is depicted as being very strong, with a violent temper to match. He is the eldest of the four ''Anemoi'' (wind gods), and brother of Eurus, Notus and Zephyrus, the gods of the east, south and west winds.

==Background==
===Power and Abilities===
As a god, Boreas possesses the natural powers and abilities of an Olympian god such as immortality, omnipresence, vast strength, and the potential to do magic such as the ability to shape-shift, to teleport, and to manifest objects. As the God of the North Wind, he controls the wind, and transforms himself into wind or a powerful tornado when angered.

==Appearances==
===''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Animated Series]]''===
===="[[Hercules and the Spartan Experience]]"====
Adonis is drafted into the Spartan ROTC, and begs Hercules to save him. Boreas, who has a long-running feud with Ares, attempts to disrupt the proceedings. At the end of the episode Hercules traps him inside a giant metal pipe.

===="[[Hercules and the Tiff on Olympus]]"====
Boreas is only seen from behind very briefly when the Gods call a meeting.

==Trivia==
*His appearance in the series differs greatly from that of the original mythology. Boreas was frequently shown as a winged old man with shaggy hair and beard, holding a conch shell and wearing a billowing cloak. Aside from the cloak, he lacked all the other features. His Roman name is Aquilo.
*Boreas is the eldest of the four Anemoi (wind gods). None of the others appear in the animated series.
*In the mythology, Boreas fell in love with an Athenian princess called Orithyia. She did not appear in the series.
