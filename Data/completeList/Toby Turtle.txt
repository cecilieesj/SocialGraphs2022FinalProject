'''Toby Turtle''' is an anthropomorphic turtle in Disney's 1973 animated feature film, ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''. He is [[Skippy (Robin Hood)|Skippy]]'s, [[Sis]]'s, and [[Tagalong]]'s friend.

==Personality==
Toby is a fairly minor character. He is seen to be fairly cautious and cowardly but is usually convinced by Skippy and Sis to join in their fun. Toby is usually seen wearing black spectacles and a brown boat-like hat.

==Appearances==
===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===
In the movie, Toby is a turtle and a friend of Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong. He accompanies them to shoot Skippy's new bow and arrow. He is later seen at the archery tournament, where his father is one of the contestants. When Toby's father take his shot, Toby yells "Yay, Dad!" in support. Like the rest of the town, he is imprisoned for failure to pay taxes, but escapes after Robin Hood starts a jailbreak. At the end of the film, he is at the wedding of [[Robin Hood (character) |Robin Hood]] and [[Maid Marian]]. He notices Skippy joining the couple on their carriage, and asks why Skippy is going with them.
