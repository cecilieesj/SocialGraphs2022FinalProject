'''Miss Holly''' is a character from the ''[[Prep & Landing]]'' series. She is [[Santa Claus|Santa]]'s assistant and secretary.

==Background==
===Official Bio===
Miss Holly is the current Executive Assistant to the Big Guy. She started as a clerk in the North Pole Post Office, and then worked as a junior assistant under Mrs. Tannenbaum, Santa’s former Executive Assistant. When Mrs. Tannenbaum moved on to Toy Design, Miss Holly assumed the role.

'''Likes:''' Miss Holly likes the new calendar software update for her data pad, which allows her to schedule meetings up to thirty years in advance.

Miss Holly loves her subscription to <u>''L'Elf''</u> fashion magazine, and harbors dreams of one day being the editor in chief.

'''Dislikes:''' Although seemingly unapproachable due to her fashionable appearance and strict demeanor, Miss Holly longs for a more active social life, hopeful that someone will ask her to this year's Christmas party.

'''Random Fact:''' Miss Holly always finds herself in need of a fresh mug of Fun Nog every Thursday at 10:30. Coincidentally, that is the same time that Brett, the rugged Fun Nog Cooler Service Elf, is delivering a fresh supply on his broad shoulders. Miss Holly's mother thinks she can do better.
