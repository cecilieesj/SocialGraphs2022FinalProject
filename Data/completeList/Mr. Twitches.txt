He has a rather sour temperament and enjoys chasing fairies in ''[[Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue]]''.

==Role in the film==
He attacked [[Tinker Bell]] the first time he saw her, but then Lizzy put him outside. After being outside, when he came in her appeared to be very angry. He severely impeded the attempt to rescue Tinker Bell from [[Lizzy Griffiths|Lizzy]] until [[Fawn]] and [[Rosetta]] sedated him with catnip.

==Trivia==
*His tri-colored coat is atypical of male cats (in the real world, calico coats require two X chromosomes; males are only "calico" in the case of chimeraism). Perhaps in Tink's world, the fairies painted him wrong as a kitten.
