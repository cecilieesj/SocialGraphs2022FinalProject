'''Trolls''' appear as recurring antagonists in Disney's ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', and are largely based on the more mischievous incarnations of the fairy tale monsters.

==History==
===''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''===
In the Gummi Bears universe, trolls are thieves by nature, and most of their appearances have them trying to steal valuable items of some sort from the citizens of [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]], but being foiled by the titular [[Gummi Bears]]. For their first appearance, the Trolls are depicted multicolored, while all later appearances have them share a toxic green complexion. 

Their leader, Clutch, is the smartest of the bunch, and often uses his pod shooter to scar his victims. He commandeers a larger gang of trolls, but is mostly seen with his two main lackeys, Nip (red nose, first apearing yellow-orange-faced) and Tuck (purple hair, part of the group from their second appearance on).

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Trolls are creatures known to be thieves, that appear in ''Once Upon a Time'', native to the [[Enchanted Forest]]. Before the first curse, a group of them made a deal with [[Snow White]], buying several stolen jewels from her. When Snow returned to the troll bridge under which they lived in order to revert the deal and retrieve the jewels to their rightful owner, Prince Charming, the head troll become suspicious that they were being set up and got aggressive, engaging in a fight with the prince, and ultimately being transformed into a bug by Snow White.
