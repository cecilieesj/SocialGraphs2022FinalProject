'''Kiburi''' is a crocodile who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is a former member of [[Makuu's Float]], the founder and current leader of [[Kiburi's Float|his own float in the Outlands]].

==Background==
===Appearance===
Kiburi is a long, sleek crocodile with large, sharp teeth and patterns emerging from under his tail along with two dark green spots under his chin.

===Personality===
Like Makuu at first, Kiburi is an arrogant crocodile who believes that violence is the solution to every problem and who dislikes the notions of shares and compromise. Also, like Makuu at first, Kiburi is shown to believe that crocodiles deserve the biggest and most fish-filled water holes in the [[Pride Lands]]. This belief is strong in him to the point where he is greedy to the point of being power-hungry. Unlike Makuu, Kiburi is shown to be ambitious, yet arrogant to the point where he fails to think things through as shown when he challenged Makuu to a mashindano and was willing to cheat by attempting to assassinate [[Simba]] to take over the Pride Lands only to have both of his plans backfire, resulting in him being banished. After Scar is defeated and Jasiri is assigned to rule over the Outlands, Kiburi accepts this, but claims that he and his float can fend for themselves.

===Abilities===
*'''Animal Strength:''' Kiburi is shown to be nearly as strong compared to Makuu but when he was pinned down he was unable to get back up.
*'''Skilled Combatant:''' Kiburi's fighting skills are good but to Makuu he will need more then he shown to be defeated.
*'''Intellect:''' Kiburi seems to be more intelligent then his float, but not as intelligent as Makuu, and has very little common sense whatsoever.

==Role in the Series==
Kiburi makes a cameo appearance in "[[The Rise of Scar|The Lion Guard: The Rise of Scar]]", following his float to their hibernation cave while being watched over by the [[Lion Guard]] to make sure no one disturbs them from sleeping.

Kiburi makes his debut in "[[Let Sleeping Crocs Lie]]", as an antagonist. He first appears after the Lion Guard accidentally wakes him and the other crocodiles up from their hibernation. Kiburi is furious that they've been woken up during the Dry Season due to the lack of water and threatens to eat [[Ono]] when he finds out Ono is the reason their hibernation ended early. Makuu is reasonable and stops him, telling him he'll speak to Simba about finding them some water. Dissatisfied with this, Kiburi mutinies and leads the float to attack watering holes all over the Pride Lands. As the Lion Guard stops their transgression, Makuu appears with Simba and chastises him for disobeying him when he knew he was finding a solution with Simba, who tells them they've been given their own watering hole. Kiburi isn't satisfied with the watering hole and challenges Makuu to a mashindano. A cobra named [[Ushari]] tells him if he kills Simba, he rules both the float and the Pride Lands. He sends his followers to kill Simba while he fights Makuu. However, Kiburi failed to think things through: the Lion Guard foil his attempt to kill Simba and Makuu defeats him in the mashindano. Simba banishes Kiburi and his followers from the Pride Lands forever. Kiburi reorganizes his followers into his own float and leads them to [[the Outlands]] where Ushari leads them to his master; [[Scar]].

In "[[The Little Guy (The Lion Guard)|The Little Guy]]", after concocting a plan, [[Njano]] speaks to Kiburi about [[Hodari]], someone who was turned down by Makuu and now wishes to join his float instead. When Hodari appears, Kiburi is shocked to see that he's a gecko, and not a crocodile. He goes along with the plan, though tells Hodari that he still needs to pass a test. Hodari already knows about the Traditional Crocodile Initiation Spar, and Kiburi calls forth [[Tamka]] to challenge him. Just before they engage in combat, Kiburi orders Tamka to let him win. He does as commanded, and Hodari is overjoyed to be confirmed as a member of Kiburi's float. His new leader then leads his float to the Pride Lands.

At that moment, Ono spots Kiburi's float marching through the Pride Lands, and the Lion Guard rushes to stop them. Once there, the Lion Guard is met by Kiburi, who claims to simply be visiting. He then introduces the team to his float's newest member, Hodari. He attempts to use Hodari's friendship with the Lion Guard to his advantage, but [[Kion]] is adamant about Kiburi's banishment and commands the float to return to the Outlands. Kiburi reluctantly gives in, and the float leaves the Pride Lands.

Back in the Outlands, Kiburi devises a new plan to attack Makuu and seize control of his float. He questions Hodari on Makuu's battle tactics, and Hodari happily shares some of his moves, inadvertently revealing that Makuu is injured and not able to engage in combat. This inspires Kiburi to invade the Pride Lands and defeat Makuu once and for all.

Meanwhile, the Lion Guard tries to warn Makuu that Kiburi is lurking in the Pride Lands, but Makuu insists that his float can care for itself. Kion submits to Makuu's request and leads his team away from the float, unaware that Kiburi is watching from the shadows. The moment the Lion Guard departs, he and his float attack Makuu, using Hodari's lessons to evade their attacks and seize an effortless victory. Hodari tries to remind Kiburi that he cannot be leader without calling for a mashindano, but Kiburi ignores the gecko and continues to mercilessly beat Makuu.

Ono spots the attack, and Kion leads his team into battle. Kiburi pins down Makuu, and Tamka overcomes Kion, preventing him from helping Makuu. Hodari senses the danger and tells [[Beshte]] to carry him closer to the fight, as he has an idea. Beshte does as he is told, and Hodari comes close enough to leap onto Kiburi's snout, distracting him. He then yells for Makuu to use the Wide Tailspin move, which Makuu does, knocking Kiburi into the mud and freeing Makuu from his prone position. With Kiburi's float incapacitated, Kion uses the [[Roar of the Elders]] to banish them back to the Outlands, effectively saving Makuu and his float.

In "[[The Scorpion's Sting]]", Scar plots with his [[Army of Scar|army]] in the Outlands to defeat both Simba and the Lion Guard. He explains to his followers that he will be using [[Sumu]] the scorpion to take down Simba. At [[Pride Rock]], the [[Pride Animals]] sing "[[Good King Simba]]" in honor of the Kumbuka celebration. However, in the midst of the festivities, Sumu stings Simba's tail and then banks a hasty retreat as Simba collapses to the ground.

Back in the Outlands, Scar gets word of Sumu's success and directs his army to intercept them. The plan works, with Kiburi, [[Reirei]], [[Janja]], and their respective clans slowing down the Lion Guard's progress through the Outlands. At last, the Lion Guard reaches the inner volcano, where Makini places a pinch of the cure, ash, in her gourd.

As the team turns to leave, Scar calls his army forward, and they corner the Lion Guard at the edge of the lava. With no option left, Kion uses the Roar carefully to blow away Scar's army, and the Lion Guard makes a quick escape.

In "[[The Kilio Valley Fire]]", the Lion Guard struggles to put out a widespread brush fire. The Lion Guard spreads out, accepting help from several of [[Ma Tembo]]'s herd members, while Ma Tembo leads the rest of the herd out of the valley. However, she is cornered among the flames by Janja, Reirei, Kiburi, and their respective followers.

Ono overhears Janja's cackling and reports what he's heard to Kion, who suspects Scar of causing the trouble. He then orders his team to protect the elephants, leaving Kilio Valley to the mercy of the fire.

Later in Kilio Valley, the fire dies down as the Army of Scar celebrates their victory. They begin to bicker among themselves, arguing over who had performed the best, when Scar suddenly arises from a still-burning ember and orders the army to remain in Kilio Valley. He then reveals that he plans to take over the Pride Lands piece by piece.

Janja attempts to appoint himself leader of the army, but Kiburi, [[Mzingo]], and Reirei protest vehemently. The villains then begin singing "[[I'm Gonna Run This Dump]]", When they look over to Kiburi, he stoically says that he doesn't sing. They continue their fighting on who will run "the dump we all hate."

In "[[Undercover Kinyonga]]", Kiburi and his float are mentioned to be still living in Kilio Valley with the jackals by Ono.

In "[[The Zebra Mastermind]]", Kiburi is mentioned by his cronies, [[Tamka]] and [[Nduli]].

In "[[The Hyena Resistance]]", After hearing that The Hyena Resistance is ruining Scar's plans he orders his army to take them down. However, the Lion Guard comes to rescue them. Kion uses his roar to blow Outlanders away.

In "[[Beshte and the Beast]]", Kiburi's Float helps the Army of Scar fight [[Basi's Pod]] and the Lion Guard. However they get stopped by [[Shujaa]].

In "[[Pride Landers Unite!]]", Scar orders his army to take over Makuu's Watering Hole. However they get stopped by the Pride Landers.

In "[[The Fall of Mizimu Grove]]", Scar orders his army to take over Mizimu Grove. They get stopped by Kion.

In "[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]", Scar orders his army to set Pride Rock on fire. The next day Scar's army helps fight the Pride Landers. When Scar gets defeated [[Jasiri]] becomes in charge of the Outlands. Kiburi says that no one tells them what to do, but nonetheless agrees to surrender and has laid low since, possibly no longer a threat.

==Relationships==

===Friends===
====[[Tamka]]====
Tamka and Kiburi are good friends. Tamka does whatever Kiburi tells him to. Tamka takes down Kion when he pinned Kiburi in "[[The Little Guy]]." In "[[The Zebra Mastermind]]" Tamka wasn't invited to the big meeting since he's not smart along with Nduli.

====[[Nduli]]====
Nduli and Kiburi are good friends. Nduli does whatever Kiburi tells him to. In "[[The Zebra Mastermind]]" Nduli wasn't invited to the big meeting since he's not smart along with Tamka.

====[[Scar]]====
After being told by Ushari that if he killed Simba he could rule the Pride Lands, Kiburi and his crocs attempted to do so but failed and were exiled and forced to move into the Outlands where they met Scar and ever since then have been his minions. Kiburi despite obeying every command of Scar's (unless he does not understand it) almost always fails to please him, which often makes him angry. He is just as power hungry like his boss and is always confident that he can win any fight which is what leads to his downfall but despite this, Scar still uses Kiburi in his plans, who one day hopes the Pride Lands will be theirs for taking. After Scar is destroyed by Kion, Kiburi refuses to submit to Jasiri, the new ruler of the Outlands, claiming he and his float can fend for themselves, likely suggesting that he has left the days of being the soldier of Scar behind him.

====[[Ushari]]====
After being told by Ushari that if he killed Simba he could rule the Pride Lands, Kiburi and his crocs attempted to do so but failed and were exiled and forced to move into the Outlands where Kiburi nearly killed Ushari in anger, but was then was introduced to Scar by him and so far the two seem to be doing alright. Kiburi takes part in the attempted murder of Janja and his clan, as well as the war against them and the Pride Lands, before being defeated and residing in the Outlands under Jasiri's rule. It's assumed that after Ushari was killed, Kiburi abandoned his alliance with the cobra to fend for himself.

====[[Reirei]]====
Kiburi and Reirei both work together for Scar to fight the Lion Guard.

==Acquaintances==
====[[Goigoi]]====
Kiburi and Goigoi are on good terms. They both work together for Scar to fight the Lion Guard.

====[[Shupavu]]====
Kiburi and Shupavu are on good terms. They both work together for Scar to fight the Lion Guard.

====[[Mzingo's Parliament]]====
Kiburi and Mzingo's Parliament are on good terms. They both work together for Scar to fight the Lion Guard. Until Jasiri became in charge of the Outlands.

==Enemies==
====[[Makuu]]====
[[File:2017-09-04-06 25 01.png|250px|right]]
Kiburi was a member of Makuu's Float, until the Guard accidentally woke him and the rest of the float up, which caused him to disobey his leaders' orders and go and search for his own water. When he thinks that the spot Makuu picked was horrible and after being told to leave if he doesn't like it, he instead calls for a Mashindano to become the new leader but unfortunately, was unable to defeat Makuu.

That same night, he planned on murdering Simba, so he could also become king but after the Guard foiled his plan, he was banished from a disgusted Makuu's float, not only for losing the fight but for trying to kill Simba, who banishes them for the act.

When he returned to the Pride Lands for the first time, he took advantage of the fact that Makuu was hurt and nearly killed him, but was defeated eventually, showing how much he desires revenge against his former leader.

====[[Kion]]====
Kiburi has come to detest Kion, who has almost always ruined his plans to rule over the Pride Lands in some way. After leaving the Pride Lands, Kiburi's hatred towards Kion and his Guard have deepened.

Since Kion is very confrontational, Kiburi finds it difficult to get past the cub. He is also aware of Kion's power and will do his best to avoid coming into contact with it but still wishes for revenge. It can be assumed that Kiburi still dislikes Kion, though not to a dangerous and murderous extent, even after he is put under Jasiri's custody.

====[[Simba]]====
It can be reasonably indicated that Kiburi was the only animal in the Pride Lands that Simba trusted the least. Simba, while willing to trust Makuu due to him still developing to be a better leader, did give the same faith to Kiburi, who visibly questioned his authority.

After being told by Ushari that if he killed the king he could rule the Pride Lands, Kiburi planned for his three minions to kill him while he fought Makuu. After the Lion Guard spoiled his evil plot, Simba became enraged. Not long after the plan was foiled, Kiburi lost the Mashindano, and, with Makuu's permission, Simba banished Kiburi and his followers for trying to murder him, not wishing to give any second chances.

====[[Hodari]]====
Kiburi only used the gecko so he could defeat Makuu, not seeing him as anything other than a means to an end. Since Hodari was unaware of his true intentions, he reveals to the crocodile that Makuu is hurt and all of his new crocodile moves. Kiburi later uses this to his advantage and attacks his former float. When Hodari tries to remind Kiburi of the crocodile way, Kiburi reveals his true colors and shows just how little he cares about the gecko by tail swiping him into a tree. Later, Kiburi is annoyed by Hodari, who assists Makuu in defeating him.

====[[Janja]]====
[[File:Call-of-the-guard-v2_(4).png|250px|right]]
When Kiburi first met Janja, he agreed to join him because Scar convinced him and his float to join their side. However, when they start working together, they argue frequently because Kiburi finds the hyena to be incompetent. Janja eventually turns on Kiburi and his float because they along with the rest of Scar's Army betrayed them.

====[[Jasiri]]====
Jasiri has trapped Kiburi and his float from taking over the Pride Lands before, but Kiburi and his float eventually find out and attempt to attack Jasiri and [[Jasiri's Clan|her clan]] along with [[Janja's Clan]] of hyenas and [[Reirei's Pack]] of jackals. When Scar's army is defeated, Kiburi swears vengeance on Jasiri's clan because of his loyalty to Scar. When Scar is defeated, Kiburi doesn't care that Jasiri is in charge and presumably leaves the Outlands as he is not seen in [[Return to the Pride Lands]].

==Trivia==
* Kiburi is one of the three secondary antagonists in The Lion Guard.
* Kiburi means “Arrogance” or “Pride” in Swahili. It is fitting due to him being more arrogant than Makuu was to the point of recklessness.
* Kiburi is basically Makuu without his better qualities and pragmatism and how he might have been if he stayed selfish and uncompromising, him effectively replacing the reformed Makuu as the show's crocodile villain.
* As shown in the episodes [[The Little Guy (The Lion Guard)|''The Little Guy'']] and [[The Kilio Valley Fire|''The Kilio Valley Fire'']], Kiburi doesn't like singing (which is ironic considering the fact that he’s voiced by a well-known singer/rapper).
