Growing up in Wakanda, N'Jobu was loyal to his country and was devoted to his family, especially his older brother. However, during his time in Oakland, California, N'Jobu started to question his country's isolationism where he saw how people of African descent were faced with such levels of racism unlike his people in Wakanda. As a result, N'Jobu became an extremist, seeing as how he not only betrayed Wakanda to fund a war against the world at large, feeling that to be the only way to liberate people of African descent, whom he sees as his people but also willing to eventually subdue all countries and rule as a benevolent dictator. Due to his training as a War Dog, he is cautious and slow to trust but is willing to put his life on the line for people who he has indeed come to trust. However, N'Jobu still loved his family, especially his son and older brother. When he met his grown up son in the Ancestral Plane, N'Jobu blamed himself and his actions due to them causing his son, [[Erik Killmonger|N'Jadaka]] to become the monster he grew up to be.
