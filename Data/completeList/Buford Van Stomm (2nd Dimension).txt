}}'''Buford Van Stomm''' is a bully and the 2nd Dimension counterpart of [[Buford Van Stomm]] in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. Formerly part of [[the Resistance]], he now rebels independently against the reign of [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension)|Heinz Doofenshmirtz]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''===
Buford meets [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas-1]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb-1]] after saving them and their 2nd Dimension counterparts from a patrolling Norm bot. He escorts the four to [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro (2nd Dimension)|Isabella]]'s house, and they all fall down a chute leading them to the Resistance headquarters, where they are captured by Isabella and the [[Firestorm Girls]]. Buford's presence gets Isabella to release the five. He is later present when [[Candace Flynn||Candace-1]] accidentally arrives in the 2nd Dimension via a portal created by [[Baljeet Tjinder (2nd Dimension)|Dr. Baljeet]].

He later accompanies [[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)|Candace]], Isabella, Phineas-1, Ferb-1, and Candace-1 aboard mine carts leading to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated to save a captured [[Perry|Perry-1]]; during the trip, he expresses his desire to get into the snack-bar machines there and acquire some nachos. He then realizes that Phineas and Ferb secretly stowed away despite Candace's orders for them to stay behind at the headquarters. Buford then joins Phineas-1, Ferb-1, Candace-1, and Isabella to DEI, where they are nearly captured by Doofenshmirtz and [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz-1]], but they all manage to escape with Perry-1. During the resultant chase by the Norm-bots, Candace is forced to separate the mine cart containing the 1st Dimension characters from the rest. At first, Buford seems to show concern for them, but it is revealed that he is just hurt because he won't be getting the snack-bar nachos anymore.

When Phineas, Ferb, and [[Jeremy Johnson (2nd Dimension)|Jeremy]] rescue a captured Candace, he appears in Candace's former cell, holding nachos delightedly.

He is among those who congratulate the 1st Dimension characters for their help in defeating Doofenshmirtz and leading about his arrest
