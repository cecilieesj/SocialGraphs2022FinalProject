'''Daredevil''' is [[Brom Bones]]' pet horse in ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (the second half of the [[1949]] film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'').
==Role in the film==
Daredevil first appears giving [[Brom Bones|Brom]] a ride into town and jumping over the Sleepy Hollow boys who are sitting half-asleep around a picnic table. He then stops in front of a man sleeping atop a beer barrel at whom he neighs This wakes up the man who leaps into the air with a startled scream, kicks the barrel out from under his feet and onto its side so that when he lands, it is on solid ground. Daredevil then watches as Brom leaps onto the barrel and rolls it over to the table, serving the boys and himself some beer. As Brom does this, Daredevil as well as a few of the neighborhood dogs lick their lips in unison as they want to taste the beer too. At this, Brom breaks open the top of the barrel with one mighty blow of his large fist and sets it down in front of Daredevil and the dogs so they can drink. Daredevil appears a few days later, once again giving Brom a ride into town where he and his master see the boys trying to assist  [[Katrina Van Tassel|Katrina]] with her groceries. As they glare angrily at the boys and scare them away, Katrina comes out but is unimpressed when they bow to her and offer her a ride home. A little later, when she accepts [[Ichabod Crane|Ichabod]]'s offer to walk her home they become jealous and Daredevil runs through mud, splattering it on Ichabod. As Brom picks up Katrina and her groceries on to his back, Daredevil takes off for her house. However, when they arrive Ichabod jumps in front of them causing a big cloud of dust which he walks out of with Katrina. After the dust disappears Brom is seen holding Katrina's groceries but his horse has mysteriously disappeared and doesn't appear throughout the rest of the film.

==Trivia==

*Some have speculated that [[The Headless Horseman]] is [[Brom Bones]] in disguise due to their similar physiques, and have further speculated that The Headless Horseman's Horse is Daredevil.  However, this is unlikely to be true for the following reasons:
**Unlike Daredevil, the Horseman's Horse has a white stripe of fur from its forehead to its muzzle (though it is worth mentioning that this white stripe is not visible in every shot).
**Daredevil has rounded, dark eyes, while the Horseman's Horse has deep, red eyes.
**Daredevil is charcoal-grey with an ashy grey mane while both the Horseman's Horse's coat and mane are dark black.
*In Washington Irving's original ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]'' (the story [[:en:The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow|Disney's adaptation]] was based upon), Brom's horse is named Daredevil and Ichabod's horse is named Gunpowder.  However, according to "The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters" by Jon Grant, Brom's horse is named Gunpowder in the Disney version. To avoid confusion, this article refers to Brom's horse as Daredevil and Ichabod's horse as Gunpowder.
