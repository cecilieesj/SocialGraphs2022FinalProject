==Background==
===Official Description===
{{Quote|Meridian Clade expertly pilots the crop duster that helps [the Clades'] pando crops thrive. She's the kind of person who finds the fun in any situation, and she adores her husband and son... Meridian loves flying, and their farm is her life and livelihood just as much as it's Searcher's... Strong, observant and just plain cool, Meridian is an unexpected-but-invaluable addition to the Clade family expedition having chased down the Venture after realizing that Ethan sneaked aboard.|Lissa Treiman describing Meridian<ref>[https://whatsondisneyplus.com/strange-world-inside-scoop-on-the-characters-environments/ Strange World: Inside Scoop On The Characters & Environments]</ref>}}
