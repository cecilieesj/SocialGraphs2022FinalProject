'''Freddie Facilier''' is a character who appears in the animated short series, ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]]''. She is the daughter of [[Dr. Facilier]].

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Freddie is a slender dark-skinned girl with greeny yellow eyes, amaranth pink lips, and long black hair with light gray highlights tied in pigtails. She has four dot markings on each cheek and has two violet streaks across her right eyebrow.

Dressed in a similar style to her father's, Freddie wears on the left side of her head a small amaranth purple top hat with blue feathers, a scarlet dress with puffy short sleeves, and an amaranth purple waistcoat with gold lining and buttons with red and green feathers on the left side collar. She wears fading purple tights with face patterns that resemble Shadow Demons (loa) and wears black and white wedge heel shoes that resemble her own fathers. For jewelry, she wears two golden vine bracelets around her wrists and a flowe- like medallion around her neck.

==Role in the [[Descendants: Wicked World|Series]]==
Freddie first appears in the episode "[[Voodoo? You Do]]" when she finds Mal, Evie, Audrey, and Ben in her father's shop where she makes herself known to Audrey when she is admiring a necklace in the shop. She tells her that it was alright if she was stealing it as it is what they do there. Mal and Evie recognize her from growing up on the Isle of the Lost with her and know that she is not to be trusted.

Following her meeting with the Descendants, she was transported, along with Mal and her friends, inside [[Jordan (Descendants)|Jordan's]] lamp after Mal made a second wish. Realizing she was in [[Auradon]], she used her sly charm to convince Ben into inviting her to attend [[Auradon Prep]], much to Audrey's shock and Mal's concern. In her first days at Auradon Prep, she had a difficult start adapting to Auradon's non-rotten ways, but had no trouble getting used to eating their delicious food, and was accepted little by little. Later on, she became CJ Hook's accomplice when she crashed the party, but after that failed, she was converted into a good person of change.

==Printed media==
===''[[Return to the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel]]''===
Freddie has settled down at Auradon and is often seen hanging out with Ally and Jordan. When Jay, Evie, Mal, and Carlos receive anonymous messages urging them to return to the Isle of the Lost, Mal asks her if she has received any, which she denies. Once back on the island, they realize that Freddie was the one who wrote and delivered the messages to help Yen Sid and his group of Anti-Heroes contact the VKs and warn them to come back to the Isle.
