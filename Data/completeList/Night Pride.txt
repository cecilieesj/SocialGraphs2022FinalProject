{{Quote|With strength and respect, Night Pride protect!|The Night Pride's catchphrase}}

The '''Night Pride''' is a group of animals led by [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] and [[Kion]]. They appear in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' as sworn protectors of the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. Originally, it was a group of lions led by Rani until Kion and his friends became members of the Night Pride in [[Return to the Pride Lands]], and as of now, Kion and Rani are married and not only lead the Night Pride but rule the Tree of Life together as King and Queen as well.

==Background==
The Night Pride are the protectors of the Tree of Life, Each donned with a mark similar to the [[Mark of the Guard]] that the [[Lion Guard]] members have. The [[Mark of the Night Pride]] is a tree that resembles a lion's face that is visible on the right side of their shoulders.

Their duty is to protect the Tree of Life and all who live there and who seek refuge from those who would cause them harm. And just like the Lion Guard, they also defend the Circle of Life.

==Role in the series==
===[[The Tree of Life (episode)|''The Tree of Life'']]===
The Night Pride, led by Rani, arrives to the spot where [[Ullu]] saw the Lion Guard earlier only to notice the mountain pass is blocked by the rockslide caused by Bunga. Rani asks Surak to know who the voices outside are to which Surak explains that they are strangers as he tells Rani that they are powerful than the Night Pride to cause the mountainside to collapse. Rani asks Nirmala to know if she noticed the Guard to which she asks her to take it slow by talking to the Guard. Upon hearing Kion clearing away the rockslide, Baliyo decides to find out what is happening. Upon overhearing Kion about getting to the Tree of Life, Baliyo decides to take on the Lion Guard as the rest of the Night Pride decides to fend them off, thinking Kion and his members are threats. As the Night Pride attacks the Guard, Fuli tells Beshte to hold back the Night Pride while telling [[Makini]] and Ono to work together to rescue Bunga and clear the rockslide.

Soon as Rani tries to attack Fuli, she tells the lioness that it is a misunderstanding to which she refuses to listen. Bunga, trapped in a rockslide, sees the Lion Guard fighting against the Night Pride while Makini and Ono are clearing away the rocks from the rockslide. Kion then uses the [[Roar of the Elders]] against Baliyo to know which lion is stronger than him. Soon as the Night Pride notices this, Rani confronts Kion for his actions against Baliyo. Rani then warns Kion that his actions are more powerful than words to which Fuli tells her that the Guard is not harming anyone. Kion asks Rani to know they need help at the Tree of Life but she refuses to let the Guard in the Tree of Life due to Kion's actions. Soon as the Night Pride returns to the Tree of Life, the Guard decides to remove the rocks from the rockslide trapping Bunga inside as a plan to get to the Tree of Life as Beshte explains that the Lion Guard should be welcomed to the Tree instead of being fought as he thinks the Night Pride was defending their home. Meanwhile at the Tree of Life, Janna tells Rani to welcome Kion and his friends to the Tree of Life before they leave and never return. Outside, Baliyo offers the Night Pride to talk to the Lion Guard as she and Rani discuss the situation about the Guard. As Surak and Nirmala tells Baliyo to relax, Rani decides to talk to her deceased parents. Rani then talks to [[Sãhasí]] and [[Ãnanda]] to know how good is she. She talks to them that her grandmother Janna wants her daughter welcome the Lion Guard to the Tree of Life and is unsure if she should welcome them to the Tree to which her parents tells her that one day when Queen Janna passes away, she will become queen as well. After talking to her parents, Rani decides to follow the advice from her deceased parents as the Night Pride decides to talk to the Lion Guard.

Arriving to the Guard, Kion apologizes to Rani for using the roar against Baliyo as he tells her to tell Ono to complete his journey to the Tree of Life as he was not affiliated in fighting against the Night Pride as his eyes need to be healed. Rani accepts Kion and Ono to go to the Tree of Life so they can be healed as she welcomes the Guard to the Tree of Life. She and the Night Pride take the Guard to the Tree of Life.

===''[[The River of Patience]]''===
The Night Pride introduces the Lion Guard to the Tree of Life, a place where all animals must respect the Circle of Life. Janna then tells Nirmala to know if the healing will begin to which she decides to begin the remedy now to which Nirmala plans to take Kion to be healed. Janna then tells Rani that Baliyo and Surak can handle the Night Pride's duties as she tells her that Rani must do the duties her grandmother cannot perform anymore. Rani decides to do Janna's task while Janna tells Makini to stay to which she remembers Makini was little when she and her parents arrived to meet Rafiki. Makini also tells her that the Tree of Life is the spot where she would be a Royal Mjuzi someday. Makini then decides to continue the training of being a Royal Mjuzi.

Elsewhere outside the Tree of Life, Nirmala takes Kion to a river known as Dirisha, the River of Patience. However, when [[Makucha's Army]] arrives at the Mountain Pass leading to the Tree of Life, [[Makucha]] prepares to get inside the Tree of Life. However, the Night Pride arrives and prepares for battle against them. As the Night Pride fights against Makucha, [[Chuluun]], and [[Ora]], Kion stays at Dirisha where he is waiting patiently as Fuli told Kion that Ullu warned to Rani about Makucha's army planning to eat the rare animals in the Tree of Life. The Night Pride continues fighting against Makucha and his army as they are able to fend them off from reaching the Tree of Life. The Lion Guard then arrives to the Night Pride only to notice that the Night Pride defeated the predators to which Rani explains that defending the Tree of Life is the Night Pride's job and they are good at it.

Meanwhile, Rani arrives to the Night Pride to which Surak found out that Makucha, Chuluun, and Ora are back as the Night Pride continue their duty to protect the Tree of Life. At the entrance to the Tree of Life, Makucha plans to taking revenge against the Night Pride as Ora, the big Komodo dragon, plans on doing it his way by biting every animal he sees. During battle, Kion then notices the Night Pride fending off the predators with Baliyo injured by Ora's venom. Getting the flower, Kion decides to help the Night Pride by taking Baliyo's place. After stopping Chuluun before she kills him, Baliyo tells Kion to use the Roar of the Elders against the predators to which Makucha and Chuluun decide to go to the other side of the Tree of Life. Rani escorts Surak to find and defeat Ora while telling Nirmala to bring Baliyo to safety. Rani then tells Kion to stop Makucha and Chuluun from reaching the ridge by following Nirmala's path. At the ridge, he and Rani confront Makucha and Chuluun to which they are able to knock them off the ridge.

The Night Pride overhears [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]] crying for help pretending to be an injured animal, to which the group "defends" her from Makucha, Chuluun, and Ora. This is due to Mama Binturong's plan to trick the Night Pride into letting her into the Tree of Life by finding their weaknesses due to her plan to take revenge against Bunga. The group then takes Mama Binturong to the Tree of Life to be "healed"; however, it is found out that Mama Binturong has been playing dirty tricks on the Lion Guard, the Night Pride, and the other animals the whole time as she is working for Makucha's army. With Mama Binturong defeated by Bunga and [[Binga]] using their stench abilities to defeat her, Rani thanks Ono for figuring out Mama Binturong's true form to which as she thanks him for helping the Night Pride to which he is still helpful even though his position of the Lion Guard is the Smartest as Ono feels satisfied of himself even though his eyesight will never be as strong as it once was.

Arriving at the Tree, Kion and the Night Pride arrive towards Janna to which Kion tells Makini to know how well is she doing. It is then revealed that Janna would like to see Kion's healing to be completed before she passes away. The Night Pride then spends their last moments with Queen Janna before she completes the Circle of Life. Rani is the last to spend time with her to which she explains that it is time for her to be the new queen of the Tree of Life as Janna completes her Circle of Life while Rani decides to do the task just as Janna dies of old age.
