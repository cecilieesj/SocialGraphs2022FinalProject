'''Arnie the Alligator''' made his debut in ''[[The Muppet Movie]],'' where he scared away [[Bernie the Agent]], who was just helping [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] to rethink his destiny. In this appearance, Arnie was a realistic-looking animatronic alligator puppet.

In ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Kermit%27s_Swamp_Years Kermit's Swamp Years]'', Arnie appeared in Muppet form, as performed by [[John Kennedy]]. He served as a kind of bodyguard and elder mentor to Kermit and his young friends [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Croaker Croaker] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Goggles Goggles]. The puppet used for Arnie here was one of a couple of alligator puppets originally built for ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''.

''Kermit's Swamp Years'' gave a brief explanation as to why Arnie tried to attack Bernie in ''The Muppet Movie'': it is explained that Arnie has several misconceptions about humans and views them with suspicion.
==Trivia==
* Arnie the Alligator's film appearance in Kermit's Swamp Years is owned by Sony Pictures.
