She and the baker decided to split up but then she meets Cinderella's prince and he kisses her, despite her hesitations. Shortly afterwards, the giant comes nearby and she falls off a cliff.

She last appears as a spirit, urging her mourning husband to find a way through his grief for the sake of their son.
