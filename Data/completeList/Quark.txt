'''Quark''' is the Szalinskis' dog ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier Jack Russell Terrier]) and one of the main protagonists from the [[1989]] film, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', [[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid|its sequel]], and [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show|its television series]].

==Role in the film==
Quark appears in the 1989 film, getting their mail and bringing it in the house. He is later seen hearing the now shrunken kids whistling and tries to go and help them, but is chased away by Spike, the Thompsons' cat. He also accidentally messes up one of [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]]'s attempts to find them. He is later seen at the end, finding and bringing them inside along the way, overcoming his fear of Spike. He manages to save [[Nick Szalinski|Nick]] from being eaten from Wayne by biting Wayne's ankle. When they are returned to normal size, he celebrates Thanksgiving with them and is seen eating an enlarged dog treat. 

Quark returns in the 1992 film [[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]. Like its predecessor, he is one of the film's major characters.

===''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show]]''===
Quark regularly appeared on the show. Originally, he was portrayed as a border collie. However, in the episode "[[Honey, it's Quarkzilla]]", he mutates into a giant creature, after having eaten some mutant tomatoes created by Wayne. After being returned to normal, he becomes a completely different breed of dog.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
Quark appears in ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]]'' with his biggest part being the finale where he is accidentally blown up by Wayne's [[Szalinzki's Shrinking Machine 2.0|new shrinking machine]] and sneezes on the guests. At the ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: Movie Set Adventure]]'', his nose appears in a corner of the complex sniffing and occasionally sneezing on guests.
