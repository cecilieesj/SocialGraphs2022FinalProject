He is designed to use his alluring charm to get the enemy to take him back to their headquarters, where, 48 hours after his activation, he emits a foul odor that makes the location inhospitable. His one true place is on [[Plorgonar]] ([[Pleakley]]'s home planet), where, unlike most places in the galaxy, his stench is considered a rare and valuable perfume.

==Background==
===Personality===
Due to his disarming cuteness, Mr. Stenchy gains very much attention from humans and most alien species. He also appears to act as cute as he looks, being very loving and friendly towards anyone who gives him affection. However, he is shown to be somewhat wary, such as when [[Stitch]] mistreated him and then later attempted to rescue him.

===Physical appearance===
Mr. Stenchy is a small, irresistibly cute light pink experiment with a big head with big blue eyes, two puffy antennae, a small tuft of hair and a small body with little arms and little feet with fuchsia toes.

===Powers and abilities===
Mr. Stenchy appears disarmingly cute to everyone except other experiments, but then emits an extremely noxious, foul odor 48 hours after he is activated, which makes 40 square miles of an area uninhabitable for decades.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 254 was the 254th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his cuteness to smitten Jumba's enemies into taking him back to their headquarters, where 254 would emit a noxious stench that would make 40 square miles of the area uninhabitable for decades. 254 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 254 was activated.

An estimated twelve hours after his activation, 254 was captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] and taken back to the [[Lilo's House|house]], but not before being pursued by a persistent [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].

Lilo fell for 254's cuteness and decided to keep the newly-christened Mr. Stenchy, despite [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s warnings of the experiment's inevitable stench. Stitch, however, became jealous of Mr. Stenchy and was immune to the latter's charm. He even relentlessly bullied and tormented Mr. Stenchy.

Later, Lilo began taking Mr. Stenchy to [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]'s tea parties in an attempt for the former to be accepted into their group. Of course, Mertle and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] had also fallen for Mr. Stenchy's cuteness after Lilo first introduced him to them.

When Stitch was left home alone with Mr. Stenchy, the latter made a vain attempt to befriend Stitch, not wanting them to be enemies. However, he ignored Mr. Stenchy's efforts and ended up locking the pint-sized experiment in the pantry. Gantu later attacked the house, but Stitch, having two shoulder devils, goaded Gantu into taking Mr. Stenchy so that the former would be rid of them both.

However, back at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu also fell for Mr. Stenchy's charm before he could teleport the latter to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]. This made [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] envious like Stitch, though Gantu took little notice. As he kept pampering Mr. Stenchy, Reuben grew increasingly jealous and became quite annoyed.

Thus, Gantu grew attached to Mr. Stenchy until Lilo and the others broke into the ship to save Stitch's cousin. Due to Stitch abandoning him earlier, Mr. Stenchy chose Gantu. However, the diminutive experiment then began to emit his stench, forcing Gantu to hand the former over. Although Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and Gantu were all repulsed by Mr. Stenchy's stink, [[Pleakley]] was surprisingly appealed to it, even claiming the odor to be a rare and valuable perfume.

After being rescued, Mr. Stenchy was sent to [[Plorgonar]] in a rocket, where he could be loved in spite of his fetid smell, as it was considered appealing on Pleakley's home planet. Upon landing, the rocket opened its hatch, and Mr. Stenchy was discovered by an alien couple who had smelled his "delicious aroma". They immediately fell in love with Mr. Stenchy, as he smelled just like their "first date", much to his joy.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Mr. Stenchy inexplicably reappeared back on Earth and not producing his noxious odor, suggesting it eventually wears off after a while.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Mr. Stenchy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Mr. Stenchy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did. However, in one scene, Mr. Stenchy can be seen around some of the Leroys just before they started to shut down.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Mr. Stenchy has appeared twice in the ''Stitch!'' anime. In the first appearance, he was seen at the very end when he fell in love with [[Skunkuna]], and it is revealed that a mixture of Mr. Stenchy and Skunkuna's aroma oddly enough creates an air freshener. In the second appearance, [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] mass-produced clones of Mr. Stenchy and [[Mrs. Sickly]] and sold them to many children across [[Japan]] and the rest of the world. This is when it is revealed that if the emissions from these two mix, the chemical reaction will cause a cataclysmic explosion capable of destroying the planetary body they inhabit. This leads to [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]], [[Pleakley]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], Hämsterviel, and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] on a hunt to round up the clones of Mr. Stenchy and Mrs. Sickly in order to save the world's Christmas.

==Trivia==
*Mr. Stenchy was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.
**In the Experiment Finder game, Mr. Stenchy's one true place can be inside an alley filled with garbage cans, where people won't distinguish his smell from other foul smells.
*Mr. Stenchy was activated off-screen.
*Mr. Stenchy is one of the rare experiments to have sclerae and pupils instead of solid black eyes, the others being [[Mrs. Sickly]], [[Skip]], [[Clink]], [[Nosox]], and [[Bragg]].
*Stitch and Reuben were unmoved by Mr. Stenchy's cuteness, as Jumba pointed out that other experiments are immune to Mr. Stenchy's charm.
*It is revealed that Pleakley's alien species is the only species which finds Mr. Stenchy's stink appealing. This is because their antenna, which also functions similar to a nose, functions somewhat differently when it comes to scents, allowing them to ignore or appreciate odors which humans and most aliens would consider noxious and horrible, as Pleakley and the Plorgonarian couple who found Mr. Stenchy were delighted by his odor, whereas Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and Gantu were repulsed by it.
*Mr. Stenchy is one of the only known experiments whose one true place is not on Earth.
*In ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', Mr. Stenchy inexplicably returned to Earth from Plorgonar, though it is possible he was simply visiting the planet. Also, he did not produce his stink, suggesting it wears off after a while or he has learned how to control it.
*Mr. Stenchy's head, antennae, and ears appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab]]''.
*In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, Mr. Stenchy has a wife named Mrs. Sickly.
