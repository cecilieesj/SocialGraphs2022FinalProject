'''Priscilla Tripletoe''' is one of the sloths working in DMV ([[Department of Mammal Vehicles]]), along with [[Flash]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2016]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''.

==Background==
===Development===
Priscilla is voiced by [[Kristen Bell]], who also voices [[Anna]] in ''[[Frozen]]''. This is because when casting director [[Jamie Sparer Roberts]] watched an interview with Kristen, she explained her love of sloths and how she had a meltdown of joy about getting to meet a sloth for her birthday. They asked her if she would do two words of dialogue if it was a sloth, and she answered in two to three minutes, "Yes." Roberts jokes, "It was the quickest deal ever made in [[Hollywood]]."

At one point during development, she was married to [[Flash]].<ref name="Jared tweet"/>

==Role in the film==
During [[Judy Hopps]] and [[Nick Wilde]]'s visit to the Zootopia DMV, they enlist Flash's help in tracking down a vehicle. However, while Flash is inputting the vehicle's license plate, Nick distracts Flash with a joke, much to Judy's dismay. Flash then retells the joke to Priscilla, angering Judy even further.

During the time of [[Gazelle]]'s performance, Priscilla and Flash are seen ''literally'' slow dancing as they hold paws.

== Trivia ==
* In the Brazilian dub of ''[[Zootopia]]'', Priscilla was renamed to "Preguiscilla", which is a mix between the words "Preguiça" ("sloth" in Brazilian Portuguese) and "Priscilla".
* In the Latin American Spanish dub of Zootopia, Priscilla's was changed to "Perezila", a play between the words "Perezozo" (which is the Spanish word for "sloth") and her original name.
