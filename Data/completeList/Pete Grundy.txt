'''Pete Grundy''' (or simply '''Mr. Grundy''') is a character who appears in the [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film, ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]''.
 
==Background==
Mr. Grundy serves as the storekeeper of Grundy's Mercantile Store. He is shown to be kind to people who enter his store. However, when it comes to [[Danny (So Dear to My Heart)|Danny]]'s bad reputation, he feels furious of the damage caused by [[Jeremiah Kincaid|Jeremiah]]'s pet sheep like when he caused damage to the mercantile store's screen door, prompting Jeremiah to help fix the screen door with help from [[Uncle Hiram]].

In spite of Danny's mischievousness, Grundy also shows a kind personality to Jeremiah who is planning to buy a sack of sassafras to feed Danny to help him get ready for the county fair where he gives him a task of harvesting honey from a cottonwood tree where a beehive is at where he compensates Jeremiah with enough money for the sassafras.
 
==Role in the film==
Mr. Grundy is first seen exiting his store to witness Dan Patch, the champion horse, arriving at Fulton Corners amongst the many townspeople approaching him while [[Jeremiah Kincaid]] curiously observes the horse. Later when a grown-up [[Danny (So Dear to My Heart)|Danny]] runs across the town, he starts causing a big mess across Grundy's Mercantile Store with Mr. Grundy upset for the damage caused by Jeremiah's pet sheep, warning Jeremiah that if he ever brings his pet sheep into his store, he will take him away, showing Jeremiah the damage caused by Danny.

Furthermore, Jeremiah brings a sack of sassafras to Grundy's Mercantile Store, showing it to Mr. Grundy and the sack weighs 18 pounds and the total cost for this sack is $2.14, which Jeremiah is unable to afford for the cost. Grundy then offers Jeremiah to help him collect honey from a bee tree far away from the town at a swamp. Jeremiah manages to return to the Mercantile Store to deliver the honey which Mr. Grundy asked him for. Having delivered the honey, Jeremiah receives a lot of money for a good deed, which Jeremiah feels excited about feeding Danny the sassafras for saving a lot of money for him. After facing a boy saying something hurtful about him and his lamb in winning the ribbon which Jeremiah fights him back, Mr. Grundy then decides to teach the boy a lesson.

Grundy is last seen at the end of the film when Danny, who was ranked as the Champion Ram Lamb of the Pike County Fair, arrives where he gathers the whole town for a celebration at his mercantile store with Danny who is recently ranked as the Champion Ram Lamb of the Pike County Fair when Jeremiah and his family return to the town of Fulton Corners.
