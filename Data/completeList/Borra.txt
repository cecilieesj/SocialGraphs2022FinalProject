==Background==
===Personality===
Angry, wreckless, but also willing to admit when he's wrong. Borra is one of the leaders of the [[Dark Fey]], a band of winged creatures exiled from the human world, who help nurse [[Maleficent]] back to health. He is an advocate for war in order to not have the Dark Fey go extinct.

==Appearances==
===''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]''===
Borra first meets Maleficent when she is rescued by Conall. He, as the warlike fairy who favors open conflict with humans, is seen in the cavern trying to persuade the other fairies that they need to attack first. Otherwise, they will be driven to extinction by human oppression, which is what forced them into hiding in the first place. Later, he and the rest of fey folk find out that Maleficent is also the last descendant from the Phoenix, an ancient and powerful Dark Fey ancestor. Because Maleficent's magic is so powerful, Borra (along with [[Conall]]) believe she is instrumental in ending the conflict with humans, either by peace or war. Following Conall's injury, Borra aggressively sends in a war to fight against Ulstead to prove that they are stronger than humans who keep harming the Dark Fey.

As Borra and the fey are all fighting against [[Queen Ingrith]]’s forces, [[Prince Phillip]] stops him, but spares his life, as he doesn’t want any bloodshed. Thus, he stops the Queen when she is trying to escape after throwing off the roof of the castle. Later when Maleficent reforms and gets along with Aurora, Borra also stops fighting alongside the other Fey and the soldiers as Ingrith is transformed into a goat for her crimes. Borra later attends the wedding between Phillip and Aurora and the reunion between the Moors and Ulstead.
