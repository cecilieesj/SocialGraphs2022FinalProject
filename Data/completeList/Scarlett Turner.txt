==Personality==
As a sea captain she travels a lot. While she enjoys adventure, her job does keep her away from her family, which makes her daughter miss her at times.

Despite her business, she doesn't completely neglect her husband and daughter and frequently sends them mail. After her debut episode she visited her family more often.
