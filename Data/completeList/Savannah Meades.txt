Savannah is one of the students at Nonsuch Middle School who is considered as the "Popular Girl". She has a B-Bot with a cat design like many of the residents of Nonsuch who have B-Bots with a unique design. However, during an incident where the B-Bots start causing a havoc across the Nonsuch Middle School, a creature made out of B-Bots "devours" and "deploys" Savannah where she is descended down just as she feels humiliated throughout the incident with the video harassing her being viral. Even though she was humiliated during the climax of the film, she and the other students of Nonsuch later approach [[Barney Pudowski|Barney]] who has asthma while at the woods while being carried by [[Ron]]. However, thanks to Barney who has recovered and later entered the cloud storage area of Bubble, he was able to insert Ron's original code and transfer it to the rest of the B-Bots, which includes the video humiliating Savannah being deleted permanently with the B-Bots' data being overwritten by Ron's code. Thanks to this, Savannah even praised Barney for changing the world by transferring Ron's data to the existing B-Bots.

In the middle act, when the B-Bots go out of control, she livestreams herself in the school, until she falls into the B-Bot monster, which makes the video go viral. later, [[Ron]] crashes her vlog and shows him the real meaning of a B-Bot.

In the end act, her and Barney become friends again.
