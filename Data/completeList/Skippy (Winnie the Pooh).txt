'''Skippy''' is [[Christopher Robin]]'s neighbor's dog. He is a sheepdog who only appeared in Season 4 of ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. Some believe he first appeared in "[[A Pooh Day Afternoon]]", which marked his first appearance, but in "[[Sorry, Wrong Slusher]]", a sheepdog like Skippy appears nameless, so this might be the actual first appearance of him. He'll only obey Christopher Robin whenever he hears the sound of a horn, or when [[Tigger]] imitates the horn's sound by yelling, "SQUANKY!". His vocal effects are performed by [[Jim Cummings]].
