'''Cody Griffin''' is the main protagonist of the [[1999]] [[Disney Channel Original Movie]], ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]''. He was born a merman and one day, when his mother was swimming, a fisherman (Big John Wheatley) started chasing her, so she left Cody in a basket on a nearby boat while she ran the ship ashore. When she returned to him, the ship was docked and a couple had found Cody, and taken him to shore. The Griffins went to the police, but no one came for Cody, so they adopted him.
