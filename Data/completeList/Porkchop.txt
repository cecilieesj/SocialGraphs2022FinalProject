==Appearances==
===''[[Disney's Doug]]''===
Porkchop has been Doug's dog and best friend since he was only a year old, receiving him as a gift for Christmas. Since then, Porkchop has always been at Doug's side, supporting him whenever he was sad and keeping him entertained.

Despite being a dog who can't talk, Porkchop behaves very much like a human, and can walk on two legs just like the other pets and animals in the show. His actions also hint that he is very sarcastic, usually showing such reactions when Doug starts to drift off into his own little world. He is often seen listening to his walkman, which Doug gave him for Christmas, in the same year that Porkchop gave Doug his journal.

==Trivia==
*While Porkchop is most likely a Bull Terrier, early drawings show him to be a Dalmatian.
*He is similar to Snoopy from ''Peanuts''.
*Porkchop has a cameo in an episode of ''Pinky Dinky Doo''. He can be seen in a cage in the pet store along with [[Harry (Stanley)|Harry]], [[Elsie]], and [[Stinky]]. Harry and Elsie were from [[Stanley]], another Disney show. All these shows were created by [[Jim Jinkins]], so they had cameo appearances. [[Dennis (Stanley)|Dennis]] from ''[[Stanley (TV series)|Stanley]]'' has a cameo as well. 
*Porkchop makes a cameo as Quaildog on a comic book in an episode of ''[[PB&J Otter]]''.
* Doug and Porkchop appear as a cameo in the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' film on a billboard advertising "Funnie & Porkchop" law firm ("Your injury is not Funnie")
