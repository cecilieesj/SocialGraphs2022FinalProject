==Role in the series==
Archenemy of [[Derek Blunt]], Phineas Sharp was an evil, twisted vulture (literally) who wanted revenge on both Blunt and [[S.H.U.S.H.]] for an earlier humiliating defeat. He stole the master list of S.H.U.S.H. agents, so that he could lure Blunt to his island resort in the Salad Sea, hoping to make the elder agent's erstwhile retirement "permanent".

Having the list of S.H.U.S.H. agents, Phineas planned on auctioning off the list to the highest bidder and cornering the China tea market. To achieve this, Phineas invited villains to his island resort. His scheme was foiled by [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] and Blunt, who switched the real list with a grocery list taken from Horatio. To the end of this scene, Phineas Sharp was last seen being threatened with a pounding by [[Hammerhead Hannigan]], the buyer of the agents list.

Phineas' only other appearance was a cameo in "[[Orange is the New Purple]]", the opening arc for [[Joe Books]]' short-lived ''[[Darkwing Duck (comic book)|Darkwing Duck]]'' revival comic.

==Trivia==
*Among those villains invited to the island, several characters of other series made cameo appearances.
*[[Ammonia Pine]], [[Steelbeak]], [[Hammerhead Hannigan]], [[Anna Matronic]],Â and [[Lilliput (Darkwing Duck)|Lilliput]] also appeared in the episode.
