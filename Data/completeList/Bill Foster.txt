'''Bill Foster''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who made his [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] debut as an antagonist in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''. He is played by [[Laurence Fishburne]]. He is a brilliant scientist and a partner to [[Hank Pym]] who exposed himself to [[Pym Particles]] in order to fight crime and the forces of evil as the superhero '''Goliath'''. As his codename indicates, Foster prefers to grow rather than shrink, being able to grow into a 30 ft. giant. Foster's scientific breakthroughs with Pym Particles are known to the world at large. He also adopted [[Ghost|Ava Starr]].
Bill Foster was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Don Heck.
