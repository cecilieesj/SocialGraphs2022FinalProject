He is hired by [[Winston Deavor]] to design [[Helen Parr]]’s new Elastigirl costume as Winston assists Helen’s return as a fulltime superheroine.

[[Edna Mode]] despises Galbaki, considering him to be an inferior costume designer. After [[Bob Parr]] mentions Galbaki’s costume, Edna becomes furious. She later declares that she will officially be “Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and [[Frozone]]’s exclusive designer throughout the known universe and until the end of time.”

Near the end of the movie, Elastigirl's supersuit made by Galbaki rips off on her shoulder after a few days of use, prompting her to use her old supersuit made by Edna.
