'''Brandy Harrington''', simply known as "'''Brandy'''", is one of the main characters of ''[[Brandy & Mr. Whiskers]]''. Brandy is an anthropomorphic mixed breed dog and talks in a valley girl-accent. She is 14 years old which is 78 in dog years according to an issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Brandy prefers to make the most out of any situation and she attempts to improve her own standing by mistreating and abusing the kindness of her friends, though she does care for her friends very much. However, she is always on the lookout for escape opportunities. She has idiotic ideas and is prone to act like a drama queen, and can be more annoying than Whiskers at times. She can be a little of a valley girl. Brandy thinks she is a spaniel with a pedigree, but in the episode "Pedigree, Schmedigree", it is revealed that she is an unspecified mixed breed from a puppy mill.

===Physical appearance===
Brandy has blonde colored dog ears,  darker blonde fur and blue eyes. She also has a little black nose on her short snout. She usually wears a pink short-sleeved midriff shirt which exposes her belly button. She also wears red jeans and purple platform sandals. She sometimes wears a pink and black polka dot bikini. On occasion she wears a red swimsuit and sometimes a black swimsuit. She also wears a black collar around her neck with a silver tag on it which almost looks like a whistle.

==Role in the series==
===Early life===
Brandy was raised by a very wealthy family and is considered a spoiled brat and a valley girl. She lived in a mansion in Palm Beach, [[Florida]] with the Harrington family and sleeps in her dog cage with her name "Brandy" encrusted on the side of the cage written in rhinestone.
She has lived in luxury over the years, that is until then, while on her way to a spa for the first time in an aircraft's cargo room, she comes across [[Mr. Whiskers]]. Mr. Whiskers, is a 7-year-old white lope-eared hyperactive rabbit with unbearable odor who has not had any friends during his lifetime. He is very obnoxious and loud, most creatures try to avoid his existence. Oddly enough, Brandy is a true friend, despite his crazy shenanigans. She often has good advice to give Mr. Whiskers as well as some bad ones followed by insults that hurt his feelings.

===Into the Amazon Rainforest===
[[File:Brandyemrwhiskers6ib.png|thumb|250px|Brandy and Mr. Whiskers in the jungle.]]
She first comes across Whiskers in the first episode of ''[[Brandy & Mr. Whiskers]]'', "Mr. Whiskers' First Friend." Whiskers grows very fond of Brandy and comes to like her. When she asks him to "Find her some light", he accidentally opens the cargo room's Emergency Escape Hatch which sends them both out of the aircraft and into the Amazon Rainforest. Brandy desperately wanted to get back home (after Whiskers destroyed the cell phone she got in one of the suitcases which fell out of the aircraft along with them). Then [[Gaspar Le'Gecko]], a very scheming gecko with a French accent, decides to make a deal with Brandy. To give her a map in exchange for Mr. Whiskers (to have him for dinner). Brandy then agrees and decides to use the map to find her way out of the Amazon.

While walking to take the route back home, Brandy goes on a guilt trip and begins seeing faces of Whiskers telling her she would not possibly let Gaspar eat him. Brandy then turns around and goes to rescue Mr Whiskers. Just as Whiskers is in the pot, ready to be cooked reading out recipe instructions, Brandy walks in with [[Lola Boa]] (a snake she met while in a tree, when Whiskers chased her away). They both rescue Whiskers. She and Whiskers build themselves a treehouse with bunk beds made from lingerie worn by a hippopotamus.

==Relationships==
===[[Mr. Whiskers]]===
[[File:BrandyAndMrWhiskers.jpg|thumb|250px|Best friends.]]
Mr. Whiskers is Brandy's former enemy, frenemy, friend and eventually best friend. Brandy met him on an aircraft in a cargo room. When she asked him to find her some light, he accidentally opened the Emergency Escape Hatch, which caused them both to end up in the Amazon Rainforest. When Brandy desperately wanted to get home, Whiskers broke the cellphone she found in one of the suitcases. When they both landed up in a tree, they met Lola Boa, and Whiskers, who once had a bad experience with snakes, rudely yelled at Lola, which caused her to cry and slither away. Brandy, exasperated with Whiskers, then made a deal with Gaspar Le Gecko and got a map out of the Amazon Rainforest for Whiskers. While Whiskers was in the pot ready to be cooked, Brandy and Lola came to rescue him. Brandy often describes him like everyone else does, silly, gross, sloppy and overall annoying, while he personally thinks of Brandy as his best friend.

===[[Lola Boa]]===
Lola is Brandy's friend--her closest friend outside of Whiskers. They first met when Brandy was sitting up in a tree with Whiskers, to which Lola offered her help. Whiskers then rudely yelled at her, and she slithered off crying and feeling insulted. Brandy asked for her help when Whiskers was taken away by Gaspar Le Gecko, which Lola gladly did. She and Brandy arrived when Whiskers was in the boiling pot ready to be cooked, and they rescued him in time. She and Whiskers soon became friends afterwards.

===[[Cheryl and Meryl]]===
Cheryl and Meryl are cute, twin toucan sisters who hold a grudge against each other. They are also Brandy's friends. They fight a lot, and their fights often lead to catastrophes for Mr. Whiskers and Brandy.

===[[Margo]]===
Margo is a stick-bug who hangs out with Brandy. She is above Brandy in the social chain of the Amazon Rainforest. When Brandy first arrived in the Amazon, Margo helped her out by giving her inside information on where the popular people hang out, though Margo believes Brandy should not hang out with Mr. Whiskers.

== Love interests ==
'''Wolfie''': Wolfie is a wild dog with whom Brandy briefly fell in love in the episode "[[Wolfie: Prince of the Jungle]]".

'''Arturo''': Arturo is a male ocelot, with whom Brandy briefly fell in love in [[A Bunny On My Back]], despite Whiskers's distrust of him, and he turned to be right, as Arturo only wanted to lure Brandy out to eat her with his family.

'''Melvin''': Melvin is a male deer with whom Brandy fell in love and tried to impress him by whitening her teeth to improve her smile, however Melvin was a bit uncomfortable with it and told her he was getting interested on her because she talked to him rather that by her teeth, however they eventually broke up as Brandy in another episode referred to him as her ex-boyfriend and he was seen with a female deer.

'''Tito''': Tito is a monkey who was a Samba dancer and teacher, which got the interest of both Brandy and [[Margo]], however only Brandy manages to get a date with Tito, where he agreed to give her dance lessons at his home, but she was unable to attend because it started to rain and after several failed attempts to go to Tito's house in the rain and after almost taking off the roof of her treehouse, Brandy decides to stay home until the rain stops, however Whiskers gives her a letter from Tito saying that he had to cancel their dance lessons because he went to take care of his sick mother, much to Brandy's anger as she walked in the rain for nothing. In a later episode, it's confirmed that they broke up as Tito is seen with a female monkey and Brandy refers to him as another of her ex-boyfriends.

'''Whiskers''': In the final episode Mr. Whiskers makes a list of things he would like to do before he falls asleep for 50 years, and one of them is to kiss a pretty girl. In the end, he admits that the list was an excuse to spend time with Brandy. Brandy gives him his wish before he sleeps, as a good friend.[[File:Brandy kiss whiskers.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Brandy after she fulfills Whiskers' one last wish.]]
