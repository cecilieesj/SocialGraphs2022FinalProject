==Background==
===Personality===
Tammy is notably strong-willed and exhibits a certain naivety consistent with her depiction as a teenager. She has a simultaneous overconfidence in her own abilities and a craving for approval and acceptance from her perceived hero figure ([[Chip and Dale|Chip]]), and rival Gadget, partly out of her dream of one day joining the Rescue Rangers.

===Appearance===
Tammy is a teenage squirrel of indeterminate species. She has long red hair kept in a single braid, blue eyes, and a long voluminous fluffy tail typical of tree-dwelling squirrels. Her clothes consist of a pair of blue jeans, a pink long-sleeved button-down shirt with oversize tails that are never tucked in, and a pink arch-type bow worn on her head.

==Role==
Tammy appears in one episode, "Adventures in Squirrelsitting". Tammy and her family first encounter the Rescue Rangers when they accidentally crash straight through the front door of the family's home, as a result of a mishap while attempting to retrieve the Maltese Mouse (a small artifact apparently of some value) from [[Fat Cat]], who has stolen it. Tammy and her sister Bink are used as hostages by Fat Cat to force the Rangers to return the Maltese Mouse to him. As a result of Chip's rescue efforts, Tammy develops a romantic crush on him, complicating the situation.

After the initial hostage crisis is resolved, the Rescue Rangers are roped into babysitting Tammy and Bink overnight. During this time, feeling rebuffed in her romantic advances towards Chip, Tammy attempts to prove herself by sneaking away from Ranger headquarters with Bink, in an idealistic but ill-fated attempt to retrieve the Maltese Mouse on her own.

The Rescue Rangers attempt to enter Fat Cat's casino in disguise, but are discovered and captured. In the resultant struggle that forms the climax of the episode, Tammy and Bink end up playing a significant role in the Rescue Rangers' ultimate escape and successful recovery of the Maltese Mouse.
