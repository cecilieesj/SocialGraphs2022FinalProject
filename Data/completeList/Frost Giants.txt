The '''Frost Giants''' are enemies of the [[Asgardians]]. They live in the realm of Jotunheim.

This version of the mythological Frost Giants was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Appearances==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
The Frost Giants are mentioned by Thor as they exterminated the [[Malekith|Malekith the accursed]] and his fellow [[Dark Elves]].

The Frost Giants first appear laying siege on Asgard, led by [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], but they are stopped by [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] returning from his battle against the [[Wrecking Crew]] on Earth. After defeating the Frost Giants and Loki, Thor and [[Odin Borson|Odin]] get into an argument due to Thor being busy on Earth instead of protecting Asgard. They don't know that Loki was also behind the Wrecking Crew's attack as part of a manipulative scheme to cause a schism between Thor and Odin.

When [[Avengers|the Avengers]] fight the [[Masters of Evil]] and destroy the Norn Stones, [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] and [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] find themselves transported to Jotunheim. Hank faces the Frost Giants to protect the unconscious Jan, but they use the Casket of Ancient Winters against him. Luckily, the size-shifting heroes are saved by [[Sif]], Brunhilda and the valkyries.

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
When Loki turns Thor into a frog, the Frost Giants are his henchmen, but they are defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and his team with new weapons given by Eitri, the Dwarf king.
