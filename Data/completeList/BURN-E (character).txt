}}'''BURN-E''' (which stands for "'''Basic Utility Repair Nano Engineer'''") is a welder robot who is seen briefly in the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'', when [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] and [[EVE]] fly around the [[Axiom]] starliner and re-enter the ship through a door, locking him outside. BURN-E is then seen banging his fists against the door, ultimately realizing that he has been locked out.

BURN-E is also the titular character of a [[BURN-E|parallel spin-off short]] from the film. This short was produced at the same time as the movie, and was directed by the feature film's lead animator, [[Angus MacLane]] (who also supplied BURN-E's voice). The short is included as a bonus feature on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of ''WALL-E'' and has since been aired on TV as well. ''BURN-E'' features music composed and conducted by J.A.C. Redford, who was also the orchestrator on ''WALL-E''.

==Trivia==
*BURN-E is Pixar’s second titular character of the short film, the first one being [[Geri]] from ''[[Geri's Game]]''.
*His face was designed to look like a welder's mask.
*He appeared twice during the credits. He first appeared helping some humans build a building. He was later shown welding near the 8-bit part of the credits.
*In the DVD extras, it says that he is reassigned to the Lido Deck on S'mores Night.
*In ''[[LEGO The Incredibles]]'', when the player solves the train dock puzzle in the level "Return to [[Nomanisan Island]]", a LEGO version of BURN-E will come out from the empty monorail tunnel, look around, and wave to the player before going back in.
*In ''[[Lightyear]]'', a statue of BURN-E can be seen in [[Commander Burnside]]'s office during the mid-credits scene.
