'''Parroting Pedro''' is a minor character from the [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]''. He appeared in the episode "[[Parroting Pedro]]".

Pedro first came to [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] by a stagecoach driven by Pecos Pug. [[Deputy Peck]] volunteered to greet Pedro, since [[Sheriff Callie|Callie]] was helping Mr. Dillo with new shoes for [[Sparky (Sheriff Callie's Wild West)|Sparky]]. When Pedro got off, he sought to make new friends in this new town. Deputy Peck was the first person Pedro met, and when Peck stated the rules, Pedro took the last one too literally and started repeating whatever Peck did and said. Everyone laughed at Pedro's imitations, but Peck got fed up with it to the point that he decided to lock Pedro in jail. Callie explained to Pedro about silly Peck felt. When Toby said that Peck went to Echo Canyon, he, Callie, and Pedro followed the trail. When Pedro called out into the canyon, his voice echoed back, which taught him precisely how upset Peck had been. Pedro felt bad about having messed up with trying to befriend anybody. Then Peck showed up and decided to make up with Pedro.
