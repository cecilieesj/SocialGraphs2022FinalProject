|voice = [[Paul Frees]]}}'''Herman the Bootle Beetle''' is the assistant of Professor [[Ludwig Von Drake]]. He appears in with the professor in several episodes of [[Walt Disney anthology series|''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'']], including "[[The Hunting Instinct]]'''"''', "[[Three Tall Tales]]", "[[Music for Everybody]]" and "[[The Truth About Mother Goose (Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color episode)|The Truth About Mother Goose]]". Herman is also alluded to in a ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]'' promo seen at the end of the original version of "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!]]".

Given that the only voice credit in his appearances with Von Drake is [[Paul Frees]], it can be assumed that Frees voiced Herman as well.
==Background==
In ''The Truth About Mother Goose'', it is established that Herman and the professor have been friends since childhood. He is shown to be a firm believer in fairy tales, which annoys Von Drake. He also frequently says things that annoy the professor, but despite it all, Von Drake cares for his well-being.
