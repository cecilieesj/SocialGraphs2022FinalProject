'''Yuki''' is a female [[Wikipedia:Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] who appears in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. She serves as the leader of a troop of snow monkeys in the frigid mountain area.

==Background==
===Personality===
Yuki is described as the matriarch of her snow monkey troop being very friendly to the Lion Guard. Like the rest of her troop, Yuki is very sensitive to birds of prey as they are predators to snow monkeys. However, when she and the rest of her family met Anga, she misunderstood her as a hostile predator.

==Role in the series==

===''[[The Accidental Avalanche]]''===
Yuki is first seen along with the rest of her family bathing in the hot springs, frightening her children Kimyo and Nabasu when the Lion Guard attempts to ask them for help to get to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. When Anga attempts to ask them, they end up defending themselves to which her mate Hitashi throws a snowball at her, even though Anga was not acting hostile to them. When Kion uses the Roar of the Elders to go through the snowy mountain, Yuki then notices Kion's roar going to help the gang go through the mountain which then causes an avalanche. Yuki and the other snow monkeys witness it as they escape from it. Yuki then hides behind a rock to protect herself from the avalanche as Kion saves her from it. He then explains to Yuki to know if the snow monkeys are all right to which Yuki says she is along with her children and her mate are safe from the avalanche.

After witnessing Anga again, Yuki tells her troop to stay safe to which Kion tells the snow monkeys that Anga is a gentle eagle to which Yuki tells the Guard to tell Anga to stop staring at the monkeys since Ono explains that snow monkeys are sensitive to eagles staring at them. Yuki feels worried that Kion could not save the snow monkeys' home even though the Lion Guard saved them to which Kion explains that he ''actually'' caused the avalanche due to him not controlling the Roar of the Elders properly as he apologizes to her troop that he didn't mean to cause the avalanche. Accepting the apology, Kimyo, Yuki's daughter, explains that there are other hot springs in the mountain. Kion tells the snow monkey troop to know what they want to which their matriarch Yuki explains that they want a new home to which she sings a song about finding a new home for the snow monkeys.

The Lion Guard agrees to help bring the snow monkeys to find new hot springs but before they can go, Yuki and the other snow monkeys tell them that the new home must have no trees as the trees can have birds of prey nesting there. Ono then thinks snow monkeys love trees to which their matriarch explains that unlike other monkeys, snow monkeys dislike trees as the trees can be home to large birds that eat snow monkeys. Anga then plans to search for hot springs the snow monkeys prefer as Kion escorts the snow monkeys to find a new home.

Arriving at the new home, Yuki and the other snow monkeys are satisfied with their new home albeit with a lot of trees surrounding the springs (despite its big size) as they end up adapting to live in the new springs. As Yuki and her family notice flying creatures attacking the springs, Anga then explains that the flying creatures gliding around are not birds but rather flying squirrels; Kion then explains to one of them named Tafu who then tells the flying squirrels to stop bothering the snow monkeys as they leave to rest while Kion tells the snow monkeys to relax. Realizing that the snow monkeys have retreated after witnessing the flying squirrels, Anga witnesses Yuki and her family disappearing as the Lion Guard plans to find them in the area where they fell into behind one of the trees. Makini then tells Ono's warning to Bunga and Yuki's troop not to move too much as they can fall deeper to which they are still safe. Fuli then tells Anga to rescue Bunga and the rest of Yuki's troop underground without touching the walls and letting them move since moving can make the hole deeper.

Anga manages to rescue the snow monkey troop and Bunga as Yuki explains to her that she is the first bird of prey that does not attack the snow monkey family. When Yuki plans to go back to the place with trees, Kion suggests Fuli that Anga should find a better home for the snow monkeys where the trees are far away from the springs as Yuki and the snow monkeys enjoy the new home Anga searched for them.

==Relationships==
===Family===

====Hitashi, Kimyo, and Nabsu====
Yuki is in good conditions with the rest of her snow monkey troop.

====Kion, Bunga, Fuli, Ono, Beshte, and Makini====
Yuki and the rest of her family are in good terms with the rest of the Lion Guard and Makini. They even worked together to rescue the snow monkeys who fell into a hole.

====[[Anga]]====
At first, Yuki and her family thought Anga was trying to eat them to which it is then explained that snow monkeys are sensitive to being stared at. However, Yuki praises Anga for rescuing her after falling into a hole.
