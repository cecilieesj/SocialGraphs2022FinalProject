They were once the owners of the [[Dusk 2 Dawn]] convenience store who died and haunted the place after death. [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] had an encounter with them when Wendy's friends and them partied there overnight.

==Background==
When they were alive, Ma and Pa ran and owned the Dusk 2 Dawn store. However, they had problems with the antics of teenagers who were reportedly a scourge on their store. After Pa and Ma tried to ban teenagers, they then retaliated with their new-age rap music, which was so "shocking and hateful" to Pa and Ma that they were both stricken down with double heart attacks, killing them both. Thus, they hate teenagers and haunt the Dusk 2 Dawn for any teenager who dares trespass it.

===Personality===
As ghosts, Pa and Ma have a deep hatred of teenagers. They were quite vengeful and hostile to Dipper and party at first, but their anger diminished when they found out Dipper was "technically not a teen", which made Ma and Pa act a lot nicer and sweeter. When they were alive, Pa and Ma's behavior was closer to the passive one they displayed towards Dipper.

===Physical appearance===
Pa and Ma are both slightly overweight senior citizens. They both wear glasses and still have their uniforms on from when they were alive. Pa wears an apron with his name tag on it, and Ma wears a shirt with a skirt and a coat with her name tag on it. If they get angry enough, they can catch themselves on fire.

===Powers and abilities===
Pa and Ma can physically control objects and people within their store, to the point where they can change a person's form, or bring inanimate objects to life. Pa has shown the ability to light himself on fire, grow in muscular mass, and conjure things up.

==Role in the [[Gravity Falls|series]]==
During their stay in Gravity Falls, Dipper and Mabel join Wendy and her friends on an outing to the defunct Dusk 2 Dawn. The presence of teenagers sparks Pa and Ma's anger, causing them to use their ghostly powers to give the teens ironic punishments, and speak through a possessed [[Mabel Pines]]. The couple only stops when Dipper reveals that he is not a teen, and allow them to leave in return for Dipper performing the Lamby Lamby Dance.

In "[[A Tale of Two Stans]]", a living Pa and Ma appear back when they still attended the store. While attending to [[Stan Pines]], Ma mistakes Stan for the [[Ford Pines|owner]] of the [[The Mystery Shack|old shack]], inspiring Stan to masquerade as Ford and create the Mystery Shack.

==Trivia==
*Their last names were revealed in a role playing game, PinesQuest.
