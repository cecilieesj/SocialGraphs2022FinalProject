==Background ==
===Development===
====The 1930s ====

In the 1930s, story treatment for [[Alice in Wonderland|the film]] the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle would've been on the shore where [[Alice]], [[Dodo|the Dodo]], and his followers washed up and taken part in the Caucus Race.

====The 1940s====
The two were still present in some near-final drafts made in the late 40s. While it is unknown where and when [[Alice]] would have encountered them, two songs were penned for the Mock Turtle at this point: [[Beautiful Soup]] in which he sang about some soup he made to the tune of "The Blue Danube" and "Lobster Quadrille" in which the Mock Turtle musically recited the poem of the same name while dancing with [[Alice]], some lobsters, some oysters, and some baby turtles.   

==Appearances==
===''Jell-O'' commercial===
In the 1950s Jell-O commercial that they appeared in, the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle sat with [[Alice]] on the beach where the Mock Turtle expressed his discontent at having never studied cooking in school because it meant he would not be able to entertain with food. Alice then explained that he could simply entertain with Jell-O because it looked beautiful and he wouldn't have to cook it. At this realization, the Mock Turtle said he'd have a Jell-O party the next day, the invitation for which Alice and the Gryphon gratefully accepted.   

==Trivia==
*In the Little Golden Book of Alice in Wonderland, a cow-headed turtle creature (possibly the Mock Turtle) was among the creatures that appeared in the Pool of Tears.
*In the [[2010]] adaptation of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle make non-physical appearances. The [[Red Queen]] has a mural depicting the Gryphon fighting against the [[Jabberwocky (2010)|Jabberwocky]]. Unlike in most depictions (including the classic Disney incarnation), this depiction has no wings. Although not seen in physical form nor mentioned by any of the characters, it is likely that the Jabberwocky was the one who destroyed the Gryphon. Also, the Mock Turtle is seen in a picture during the scene where the [[Knave of Hearts]] enters the room where the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]] is making hats.
