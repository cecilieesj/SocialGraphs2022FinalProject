==Biography==
District Attorney Fletcher was a candidate for Mayor who was having difficulty dealing with [[Dick Tracy|Dick Tracy's]] aggressive pursuit of [[Big Boy Caprice]]. Fletcher threatened Tracy and [[Chief Brandon]] that he would be forced to take Tracy off duty, or possibly prosecute him, as well as removing the Chief from duty.

It was later revealed that Fletcher was on Big Boy's payroll and had falsified evidence in order to secure Big Boy's release from jail. Fletcher was lured into a trap where he was shot and killed by [[The Blank|the Blank]], who was disguised as Tracy. This was part of an agreement that the Blank had made with Big Boy to remove Tracy as an obstacle to Big Boy's plans. The Blank and 88 Keyes framed Tracy for Fletcher's murder. This resulted in Tracy being arrested and imprisoned (temporarily), allowing Big Boy's criminal endeavors to flourish.
== Notes ==
*According to Max Allan Collins, the character's name - though shared by Tracy artist Rick Fletcher (who had drawn the ''Dick Tracy'' comic strip from 1977 to 1983) - was a coincidence and not intended as a tribute to that particular member of the creative team.
*As a high-level member of the local political establishment, secretly working for Big Boy, Fletcher resembles Boss Jim Herrod, a highly-respected former City official who was running Big Boy's Outfit while the latter was in prison. 
*Some readers have observed that Fletcher's appearance is reminiscent of Mr. Bribery, with his round eyeglasses, slicked back hair and cigarette holder.
