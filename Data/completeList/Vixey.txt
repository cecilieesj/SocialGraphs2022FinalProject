{{Quote|Tod, I... I just know you're gonna love the forest. Listen. Come on. Let me show you around.|Vixey, to Tod}}
'''Vixey''' is the tritagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1981]] animated feature film, ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''. She is a vixen who [[Tod]] falls in love with after being released into the wild. She is much more used to the forest, so it makes sense that she is a step ahead of Tod. When she says, "I think six would be just right", it seems to imply that she is talking about the number of cubs she would like to have, but Tod is confused and has no idea what she is talking about.

==Role in the film==
When [[Big Mama]] is looking for [[Tod]], she finds a female fox of Tod's age named Vixey, who is clearly good friends with her. After Big Mama and Vixey find Tod, Vixey remarks that he looks downhearted, and Big Mama tells her that "he was dropped out here all alone without a friend in the world". Vixey decides to try to cheer him up, and Big Mama thinks the idea is perfect. Big Mama sets Vixey into the sunlight, just so that she will look as beautiful as possible, and leads Tod to her. Tod first tries to impress Vixey by catching a trout, only to fail, causing Vixey and the other animals of the game preserve to laugh at him. Angry and hurt, Tod tells Vixey that she's "a silly, empty-headed...female!" Angered, they refuse to speak to each other, but Big Mama intervenes with the song "[[Appreciate the Lady]]" and directs Tod in being himself, and Vixey to give him another chance. They get along very well once Tod admits his lack of survival skills. Vixey is now aware of his inability to survive in the wild and helps him adapt. This also brings Vixey and Tod closer in a romantic light, and Tod moves into a burrow where Vixey makes her home.

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the foxes, a vengeful [[Amos Slade]] and [[Copper]] trespass into the preserve in their hunt for Tod. He sets up the leg-hold traps and hides them with leaves. Tod and Vixey emerge from their burrow and wander around, happy to have each other. Soon, they come across a very quiet section of the forest. Vixey, sensing danger due to it being "too quiet", declines to go any further, but Tod dismisses her concerns and goes on ahead; however, as he goes into the woods, he too, starts to become a little nervous because of the total silence and gets closer to where Amos and Copper are lurking. Tod's foot uncovers one of Amos's leg-hold traps, and as Amos gets ready to shoot, a bolt comes unloose, causing Tod to step backward. Tod narrowly escapes the traps, running as fast as he can whilst Amos's gunshots ring out, and Copper and Amos chase Tod and Vixey. Tod tells Vixey to head for the burrow, which Vixey does as Tod distracts Copper by growling and snarling at his former friend. After a brief fight, Tod runs back to the burrow, where he rejoins Vixey, but Copper catches up with them. With Copper thrashing and clawing his way into the burrow, Tod and Vixey attempt to exit through the back end, but retreat at the sight of Amos and his gun. Amos sets fire to some straw and fans flames through the back end before joining Copper at the front end to wait for the foxes to emerge. Tod and Vixey find themselves cornered, but Tod decides they must take a chance, and they both dash out through the back end, narrowly escaping the flames.

Tod and Vixey run up a cliff next to a waterfall with Amos and Copper still chasing them. The two foxes cross a log protruding over the rapids to escape. However, Tod, who has heard Copper's loud yelp, is horrified to see him getting nearly killed by [[The Bear|a huge bear]]. Vixey can only watch as Tod rushes back to fight the bear to save his childhood friend. Tod fights the much larger bear to save Copper, and ends up luring him up on a fallen trunk, which breaks and sends the two animals plummeting down the reserve's waterfall.

Vixey is not seen again until the very last scene of the movie, where she joins Tod, who is sitting on a cliff and watching his friend Copper from afar.
