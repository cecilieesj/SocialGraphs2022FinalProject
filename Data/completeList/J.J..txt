==Background==
J.J. is described as a bully who did not like to share toys with other kindergarteners at first. When Lou notices this, he decides to teach him a lesson about taking toys from the kindergarteners. After Lou teaches him a lesson, J.J. decides to change his attitude in a caring and sophisticating manner.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lou (film)|Lou]]''===
While [[Lou (character)|Lou]] happily observes a group of kindergarteners playing with their lost belongings kindly, he observes J.J. who is not treating others properly, which causes him to feel upset about this. To stop this, Lou decides to teach him a lesson. While teaching J.J. a lesson, he notices Lou holding a plush dog (whose toy's tag also has his name), revealing a flashback that J.J., when he was little, got his plush dog stolen by another bully.

When J.J. tries to ask Lou for his plush dog, Lou refuses because the bully has to give the lost belongings back to their respective students and change his unacceptable behavior. When recess time begins again, J.J. gives back all the belongings back to all the respective students kindly in praise, making Lou proud of J.J.'s good deeds. Later after giving all the belongings back to their respective owners, J.J. notices the box of lost belongings is empty, and is sad to see Lou gone where the baseballs and hoodie returned to their owners, so he grabs the plush dog that once belonged to him, thanks to Lou's help. The short film ends with J.J. playing kindly with the students as the image fades to the "Lost and Found" box whose missing letters spell out "Lou".
