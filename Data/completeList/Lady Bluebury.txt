==''Gnomeo & Juliet''==
Lady Bluebury is the leader of the Blue Gnomes who lives in Mrs. Montague's garden and battles Lord Redbrick and the Red Gnomes who live in Mr. Capulet's garden. She was first seen making fun of Lord Redbrick about his tulips and his misuse of fancy words. She later met up with her son, Gnomeo, to wish him luck for the lawnmower race. She later gave a nod of approval when Gnomeo decide to take action against the red gnomes when Tybalt won the race by cheating.

She was later seen crying because the red gnomes destroyed their most prized plant, which her husband had planted and grown himself. She asked Gnomeo where he was, and Gnomeo told her that he was nowhere when in reality, he was on a date with Juliet, a red gnome. She later heard a noise of breaking glass and went with the others to investigate. She learned that Gnomeo had fought with Tybalt, and Tybalt hit the wall, smashing him to bits. She watched in horror as Gnomeo get chased by the red gnomes and apparently got smashed by a car. She mourns for Gnomeo's death, not knowing that Gnomeo was still alive. She later saw Benny with the Terrafirminator and approve of his plan of revenge to the red gnomes. The destruction caused by the Terrafirminator later resulted in war between the blue gnomes and red gnomes. She soon saw Gnomeo, alive and well, and was relieved. However, her joy was short-lived with the out-of-control Terrafirminator crashes into Juliet's pedestal. She apologizes to Lord Redbrick and makes up him, ending the feud. When Lord Redbrick accidentally stepped on the switch to the pedestal, which knocks down the rumbles, she saw that Gnomeo and Juliet were still alive. She later witnesses her son's marriage to Juliet and dances with Lord Redbrick.

==Trivia==
*Lady Bluebury is slightly similar to [[Zira]]:
**Both are the leaders of groups (Blue Gnomes and [[Outsiders]]).
**Both them and their group oppose another person and their group (Lord Redbrick and the Red Gnomes and [[Simba]] and the [[Pridelanders]]).
**Both have sons who fall in love with the daughter of the rival group's leader ([[Kovu]] with Kiara and Gnomeo with Juliet).
**Both their group and the rival group end their feud at the end of the film. But unlike Lady Bluebury, Zira doesn't join the Outsiders in joining the Pridelanders and dies.
