==Appearances==
===''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]''===
At the beginning of the film, the Troubadour (as a normal turtle) is seen talking to a narrator who would agree to tell the story of the Three Musketeers based on his comics, but refuses as he carelessly walks towards a platform while reciting his lines before being filmed. Just as the narrator falls, the Troubadour gets launched into the spot where the narrator is supposed to tell the story, not noticing that he is being filmed. Once he finds out he is on camera, he initially develops stage fright, but then quickly gains his confidence and tells the story of the Three Musketeers portrayed by [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]].

Throughout the film, the Troubadour is mostly seen either narrating the plots of the movie or singing songs. He is shown to be skilled at playing the mandolin and is often seen without his shoes on.

However, when it comes to the musical number "[[This Is the End]]", Donald Duck is irritated upon hearing his singing about the end of [[Mickey Mouse]], causing him to go berserk much to his worry and also causing him to damage his mandolin. Donald then thanks him for the singing just as he, Goofy, and Pluto plan to rescue Mickey from a watery fate at Mon Sewer. He then appears as a conductor who then conducts the performance of Pirates of Penzance opera in Paris. During the end of the film when Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are honored for defending Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck from Pete, the Troubadour calls for one more song which is a reprise of "[[All for One and One for All]]".

==Trivia==
*The Troubadour is very similar to [[Alan-A-Dale]], [[Chance]], [[Clopin]] and [[Kuzco]], asÂ they are all the narrators of their respective stories, but also part of these adventures at the same time.
