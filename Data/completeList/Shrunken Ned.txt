'''Shrunken Ned''' or '''Colonel Nedley Lostmore''' is character at [[Disneyland]]'s [[Adventureland]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Colonel Nedley Lostmore was a British colonist (likely in the late 1800s/early 1900s) who had some apparent connection to the [[Jungle Navigation Company]]. It is known that his position had something to do with the training and possible hiring of new skippers for the company.

At some point in time, Ned was decapitated and had his head shrunk albeit with supernatural forces afoot. As a result of this, Ned was preserved as a sentient shrunken-head who was subsequently mounted in the ''South Seas Traders'' shop.

At some point, Ned became a trained witch-doctor and even something of a fortune-teller (whether this was before his beheading or following it is unknown) but his head would become known as Adventureland's head witch-doctor. He would frequently give out services for those who paid.

==Appearances==

=== [[Shrunken Ned's Junior Jungle Boats]] ===
Ned was the namesake for the former Shrunken Ned's Junior Jungle Boats game at the [[Magic Kingdom]]. This defunct attraction having been themed around a way to train potential skippers for the Jungle Navigation Company.

===[[Skipper Canteen]]===
One of Shrunken Ned's fortune cards can be found on the bulletin board in the Skipper Canteen. His voice can also be heard as part of the audio in the mess-hall.

=== South Seas Traders/Bengal Barbecue ===
He is a fortune teller machine who was located in the South Seas Traders shop area (now a dining area for the Bengal Barbecue) that takes the form of an eccentric shrunken head that bills himself as "The Jungle's Only Self-Service Witch Doctor", diagnosing guests with strange jungle diseases and offering equally strange solutions.

== Other Appearances ==

=== Printed Material ===

==== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ====
Shrunken Ned plays a major role in this book series as the grandfather of protagonist [[Andy Stanley]] and the leader and Keymaster of the Jungle Explorers' Society.

The first book, ''[[Tales from Adventureland: The Keymaster's Quest|The Keymaster's Quest]]'', begins at his funeral at his home in [[Oregon]], after his family assumes the worst from a mysterious disappearance taking place during an expedition to a hidden temple in the Amazon. His grandson Andy Stanley is the one family member who actually attends the funeral, which otherwise includes his friends from his organization. As Andy explores the mansion and solves several puzzles, he finds that Ned is still alive as a sentient shrunken head.

When exploring the temple, he was ambushed by a witch doctor/assassin named Bungalow Bob working for a sinister group known as the Collective and transformed into a living shrunken head. The funeral was an elaborate ruse to trick the Collective into thinking he was dead. He appoints Andy as the new Keymaster for the J.E.S. and assigns him to a mission to [[Hawaii]] to prevent the Collective from awakening an evil Tiki God with a key hidden in [[the Enchanted Tiki Room]]. He later becomes more actively involved in the adventures through using his robotic butler [[Robot Butler (Horizons)|Boltenhouse]] as a mechanical body.
