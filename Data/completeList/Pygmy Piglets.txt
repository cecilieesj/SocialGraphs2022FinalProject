The '''Pygmy Piglets''' (voiced by [[John Fiedler]]) are a community of short-statured piglets which inhabit the Land of Milk and Honey.

==History==
In "[[The Piglet Who Would Be King]]", [[Piglet]] travels to this distant village along with [[Tigger]] and [[Rabbit]] while searching for some honey to give to [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] in return for the spring which Pooh had given to Piglet as a friendship gift. When the pygmy piglets see the spring, they salute Piglet as their new king, explaining that he had brought back their sacred Pig Tail, which would give their honey back. Indeed, when the piglets put the spring on their Piglet statue, all the honey comes back to the valley.

Piglet doesn't like the idea of being king, but Tigger and Rabbit; who give themselves the titles of Prime Minister and Chamberlain, respectively; take advantage of the situation and get the piglets to do them many favors. As a king, Piglet points out that what they are doing is wrong, and that they should get Pooh's present back and leave. Tigger and Rabbit agree, and try to get Piglet's spring back during the night. But when they remove it from the statue, the spring is broken and the volcano suddenly erupts. Piglet and his vassals work together to put down the giant monuments of Tigger and Rabbit which the pygmy piglets had built and use them to stop the lava flow, saving the village. After this, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit get their honey and go back to the [[Hundred Acre Wood]].
