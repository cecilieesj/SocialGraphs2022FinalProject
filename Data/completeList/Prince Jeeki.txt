When he notices [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] as his arranged bride, he comments how old she is. During the wedding, Jeeki is still playing with his fingertrap as Qin gives a ceremonial cup for Jeeki and Mulan to hold. Jeeki was last seen giving his father his fingertrap to play with, and the latter enjoys it.
