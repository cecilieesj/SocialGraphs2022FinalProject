'''Dyan''', '''Pan''', and '''Uka''' are supporting characters in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]’s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''. They are a trio of thieving '''Ongis''' (half-monkey, half-catfish creatures) from [[Kumandra]]’s Talon Land. When a toddler named [[Noi]] lost her family to the Druun, the Ongis worked together to raise and protect her. To get by, they formulated a hustle ring to rob the people of Talon blind of their valuables.

==Background==
The three chattering Ongis reside in the floating market region of Talon, known for its abundance of shops and trade. They spend much of their time prowling the busy streets and alleyways, awaiting their next pawn. The Ongis are rowdy, mischievous, and swift. They have mastered the art of thievery as their monkey-like attributes make them difficult to notice or catch. Their cuddly appearance render them unassuming, which helps in their schemes.

===Official Description===
:''Part monkey, part catfish, the three Ongis are resourceful con artists from the trading port of Talon. They do everything together, including raising a 2-year-old toddler named Noi.''

===Personality===
<tabber>
|-|Dyan=
'''Dyan''' is the tallest and leanest of the group. She<ref>''Raya and the Last Dragon'': Step Into Reading #3</ref> is identified by her large hat with a hole in the center to accommodate her banded head hair. With a typically scowled face, Dyan’s temperament leans into the no-nonsense (though she has a soft spot of playtime). She enjoys picking and eating grubs out of Pan’s fur.
|-|Pan=
'''Pan''' is rotund and dons a miniature hat that sits comfortably atop his egg-shaped head. He possesses a laid-back disposition, signified by his normally zen expression and broad smile. As the largest and strongest Ongi, Pan typically carries Noi during their quick getaways. He finds having his fur groomed for grubs to be relaxing.
|-|Uka=
'''Uka''' is the smallest and youngest of the trio. Though just as troublemaking and crafty as his companions, the wide-eyed Uka is the most compassionate and the least hostile towards strangers, being the one to explain to Raaya that Noi lost her family to the Druun by posing as a Druun victim. On his downtime, he enjoys playing with Dyan’s tail.

==Role in the film==
As [[Raya]], [[Sisu]], [[Tuk Tuk]], and [[Boun]] arrive at the marketplace of Talon, the three Ongis, Dyan, Pan, and Uka, spy on them approaching [[Dang Hai]]'s lair to which they suspiciously watch them proceed. As Raya encounters [[Noi]] alone, three Ongis sneakily take the parts of the Dragon Gem to which it is known that Noi is following them across Talon. Raya chases Noi and the three Ongis across the harbor only for the con artists to be foiled by Tuk Tuk. After Raya asks Noi to know where her family is, she and the three Ongis prepare to leave. Instead of leaving, Raya devises a plan to Noi and the three Ongis to sneak up against Dang Hai and earn loot from him.

Upon arriving at Dang Hai's lair, Dyan, Pan, and Uka perform in front of a group of Talon guards outside the lair in a plan to distract them as Raya plans to face Dang Hai himself only to find Chai instead. Having retrieved another piece of the Gem from Dang Hu in a plan to set sail for Spine. On their way to Spine, Dyan, Pan, and Uka begin eating the shrimp in Boun's kitchen alongside Noi just as Boun tries to stop them from messing his kitchen just as Raya thinks of playing hide and seek to help Boun, which distracts the four.

Upon arriving at the Land of [[Spine]], Tuk Tuk barges into [[Tong]]'s hut just as the Ongis and Noi tie up the lone warrior of Spine on a post. Later as Raya devises a plan to Tong to protect her friends, Dyan, Pan, and Uka escape with Tong across the forest along with the rest of Raya's companions as they escape into the Shrimporium. Back on the Shrimporium, Sisu then devises a plan to Raya to help her fight against the Druun just as the Ongis and the rest of Raya's friends agree to help her defeat the Druun just as the boat is on their way to Fang.

Upon arriving at Fang, the Ongis and Noi devise a plan to distract Namaari as part of Raya's plan. The next day, the Ongis and the rest of Raya's friends confront Namaari before she fires her arrow at Sisu. With Sisu gone, the Ongis and the rest of Raya's friends react to what happened to what Namaari did to her just before the Druun arrive at Kumandra again. As the Druun continue plaguing Kumandra, the Ongis are petrified along with everyone at Kumandra, as the gem's magic fades away.

With all the pieces of the Dragon Gem reunited, the Druun is wiped away, just as the Ongis are revived alongside everyone at Kumandra. The Ongis and Noi return to Talon in rejoice while Noi finally reunites with her mother. The Ongis then visit the kingdom of Heart along with everyone else in rejoice.
