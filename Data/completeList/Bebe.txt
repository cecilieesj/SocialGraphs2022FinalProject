'''Killer Bebes''') are talented feminine robots designed by [[Dr. Drakken]] to take revenge on his former college classmates, such as [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]]'s father, [[James Timothy Possible|James T. Possible]]. They have amazing robotic agility, a host of killing gadgets, and are extremely dangerous.

==Background==
===Personality===
Bebe was created and programmed with one primary goal in mind: to be perfect. Though originally loyal only to Dr. Drakken, the Bebes eventually determined that he was unfit to command them and began to act on their own.

Bebe was largely emotionless, though Drakken admitted to programming them with a "pinch of human emotion" just so they would be ashamed when they did manage to fail him. Given Drakken's dismal track record with robot programming, that validity of that was questionable. However, the Bebes did seem to think that they required a human to guide them to perfection.

Also, due to their programming, the Bebes are perfectionists. They adore being perfect, including a human that would perfect to be their queen, such as [[Bonnie Rockwaller|Bonnie]], and they despise anyone that lacks perfection. Since Drakken gave them a "pinch of human emotion", this stems from becoming obsessed with perfection, including their looks. When their looks are imperfect, one of the Bebes becomes really devastated when looking in a mirror, which causes the rest of them to panic as well.

Ultimately, it is this trait that leads to their downfall.

===Powers and Abilities===
The Bebes were equipped with a host of robotic abilities, including:
*Superhuman strength
*Considerable resistance to injury (though they are vulnerable to being crushed)
*Hyper-speed movement
*Superhuman agility
*Elasticity
*Gadgets

They also demonstrated the capacity to learn from past mistakes and effectively guarded against them in future encounters.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Each Other====
The Bebes are all controlled by a hive mind and referred to each other by their chronological production numbers, such as Bebe 9. This allowed them to work together seamlessly, though they were capable of independent thought to some extent.

===Friends===
====[[Dr. Drakken]]====
Drew Lipsky created the first versions of the Bebe robot in college when he proved unable to get an actual date. After becoming the mad scientist Dr. Drakken, he eventually improved on Bebe's design, made several copies, and tasked them with kidnapping his former friends. However, he had never been good at programming, and the Bebes reasoned that because they were created to be perfect, they should not serve someone imperfect like Drakken. (And truth be told, he didn't consider them to be anything more than objects.)

====[[Bonnie Rockwaller]]====
Wanting a new leader after deeming Dr. Drakken unsuited for command, and overhearing Kim's claim that Bonnie was "the bossiest person on the planet", the Bebes assumed that Bonnie would make the perfect queen for them, and thus kidnapped her so she could serve as the core of their hive mind. For her part, while this clearly upset Bonnie, she was at the same time flattered by their attention and insistence on her superiority. The Bebes were able to tap into Bonnie's subconscious mind and treated her desires as commands, though they still retained independent thought.

===Enemies===
====[[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]====
Though the Bebes always claimed that Kim was a "minimal" threat, she was in fact always a considerable obstacle to their plans, and the Bebes treated her accordingly. Though some of this was likely due to Drakken's programming, while under Bonnie's influence the Bebes adopted some of her mannerisms, including her obvious dislike of Kim. Despite underestimating her, they eventually decided to work together to take her down, which would have worked had Kim fought them alone.

====Rufus====
They considered him to be a disgusting pest, and dealt with him accordingly. However, they allowed him to distract them at a crucial moment, which led to the destruction of three Bebe robots.

==Appearances==
*"[[Attack of the Killer Bebes (episodes)|Attack of the Killer Bebes]]"
*"[[Queen Bebe]]"

==Trivia==
*In the series pitch bible, they were known as the Killer B's and were cloned psychic women rather than androids.
