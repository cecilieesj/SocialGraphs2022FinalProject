'''Rejean''' is a minor character who appears in the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''. He is the previous owner of [[Duke Caboom]].

==Role in the film==
Rejean's only appearance was in [[Duke Caboom]]'s tragic flashback during Boxing Day. Watching a commercial for Duke Caboom, Rejean imitates what the person does in the commercial, but the task he does for Duke was unsuccessful, causing him to feel angered that his Duke Caboom toy was defective, causing him to be unhappy about the toy he received. During a plan to rescue [[Forky]], [[Bo Peep|Bo]], [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], Duke, and [[Ducky and Bunny]] plan to reach [[Gabby Gabby]]'s cabinet, Duke sees Rejean's head with an angry expression upon remembering this, just as Duke falls into an uncontrollable speed after remembering this.

Towards the end of the film when Woody and the gang are on the Ferris wheel at [[the Carnival]], Woody points to the target reminding Duke of Rejean just as Duke manages to fulfill his purpose of being a great stuntman by going through the target of the Star Adventurer game, happy that Rejean would be proud if he were there.

==Trivia==
*According to the directors' commentary, the scene where Duke stares at an angry Rejean's face is one of the most memorable scenes featured in any ''Toy Story'' film.
