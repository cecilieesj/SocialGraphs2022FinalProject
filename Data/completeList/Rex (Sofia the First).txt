'''Rex''' is [[Prince James|James]]' foxhound who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Sofia the First]]''.

==Role in the series==
Rex makes brief appearances in the first season, during the song "[[(You Can Always) Count On Baileywick|Count On Baileywick]]" in the episode "[[Baileywick's Day Off]]", "[[A Royal Mess]]", and in the episode "[[Tea for Too Many]]", where he is often seen with James on a leash.

In the first episode of the second season, "[[Two Princesses and a Baby]]", Rex plays a more active role, and speaks for the first time. He steals [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]]'s spell book and buries it for everyone to find it. It turns out that Rex loves to play games and like all dogs, he loves to bury bones. He is a bit goofy, but he claims he is smarter than he looks. Rex is also shown to be a bit forgetful. When Rex buries Cedric's spell book in "Two Princesses and a Baby" he forgets which hole he buried it in. As a result, [[Clover]] and his friends come up with a plan in order to find the location of the spell book.

In "[[When You Wish Upon a Well]]", he chases after [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] when she becomes a cat. Sofia eventually manages to get away from him, and James puts him back on his leash.

== Trivia ==
*As he stated in "When You Wish Upon a Well", he does not listen to anyone but [[Prince James|his master]]. He does not even listen to Clover in "[[Clover Time]]" while cannonballing in Sofia's bed during the "party".
*As stated in ''[[The Curse of Princess Ivy]]'', James spends a lot of time with him.
