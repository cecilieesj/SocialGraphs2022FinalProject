==Official Biography==
The son of [[Phoebe Dickens]]; Rudyard is the youngest member of the family - energetic and still fascinated by childish things. His famous grandfather looms larger than life in Rudyard's eyes, and he wishes he could be as cool as [[Dorian Dickens|the Commodore]]. To that end, he has created an alternate persona of Kid Riddle: masked mastermind, boy brainiac, and juvenile genius!
When Rudyard dons his cape and cowl, the mild-mannered Rudyard can leap into the most confounding cases with courage and confidence. He has a flair for the dramatic; he occasionally offers explosive commentary on a case in the manner of an old-fashioned comic book. His enthusiasm often causes him to come up with wildy incorrect theories, but he usually makes up for it with energetic investigation.
