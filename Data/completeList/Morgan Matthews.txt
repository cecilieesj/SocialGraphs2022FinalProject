'''Morgan Matthews''' is the younger sister of [[Cory Matthews|Cory]]Â and [[Eric Matthews|Eric]], the older sister of [[Joshua Matthews|Joshua]], and the only daughter of Alan and [[Amy Matthews|Amy]]. Mainly used for comedic purposes, her character is usually annoying to Cory, and seems closer to Eric. She was initially played by [[Lily Nicksay]] but this was later changed to [[Lindsay Ridgeway]] due to unknown purposes. Throughout the series, it becomes clear that she is a good singer, as shown in'' Better Than Average Cory ''and ''Shallow Boy''. She was called Weasel by Eric a lot.
