'''Ron Thompson''' is one of the protagonists ofÂ [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[1989]] film, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''.

==Personality==
Ron is rude, arrogant, worrisome, and selfish and can be blunt at times. He enjoys fishing and baseball. He is also a bully to Nick, but during their adventure, he warms toward him and finally becomes his friend. He is tough, but when [[Antie]], the ant he befriended, died after being attacked by a [[The Scorpion|scorpion]], he broke down and cried. He's also known to be smarter than he gives himself credit for and has very creative ideas: such as being able to construct a booby trap in his backyard, using a crossbow, that fires a suction cup arrow, marked with superglue, rigged to Russ' fishing rod, to catch intruders. As well as improving on Amy's earlier idea, which involved using a piece of cookie to lure Antie, by rigging it to a stick, which is then placed in front of the Ant, to make it follow it, while attaching a blade of grass to it, so it can tow Amy, Nick and Russ Jr..
