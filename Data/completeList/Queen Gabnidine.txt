==History==
Her guardian hero, MagMan, had defended her home and her people from the evil mantle-dwellers until his herothalamus stopped producing bravezymes, causing him to lose his heroism. Her guards capture [[Randy Cunningham]] and hold him hostage, intent on transferring his hero essence to MagMan in order to revive him.

Not long after, [[Howard Weinerman]] shows up with fellow classmates of [[Norrisville High]]. After fighting off Queen Gabnidine and her guards, Randy throws a Tengu Fireball at a tank of methane gas. The explosion ends up incinerating the queen and destroys her underground lair.
