==Appearance==
The genie is dressed in an Arabian outfit. He wears a blue turban with a red diamond in it, an earring on his right ear, a yellow vest, and a red shirt. In addition to that, he has a black beard and a blue tail.

==Role in the series==
While [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] chase a couple of bugs, they find a lamp. The two rub it and the genie comes out and offers the duo three wishes. After Timon and Pumbaa accidentally make two wishes, Timon wishes for a million more wishes. Thus, all of their wishes come true.

Later in the episode, after Pumbaa wishes for Timon to be a little more content and disappears, and Timon wishes for a boat in a lake and a bowl of soup, the two miss each other. When Pumbaa realizes that Timon misses him, he wishes for his friend to be happy and that makes Pumbaa be on the boat with him. Timon then complains that even if he and Pumbaa have everything, nothing works out. He then wishes that he and Pumbaa never found the lamp and everything goes back to normal. Timon and Pumbaa go back to their bug chase and catch and eat the bugs while the genie is in his lamp waiting for Timon and Pumbaa to rub it again.
