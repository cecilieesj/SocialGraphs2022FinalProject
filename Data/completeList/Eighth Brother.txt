Eighth Brother]</ref>

==Background==
===Personality===
Like the other Inquisitors, the Eighth Brother is fiercely dedicated to the service of the [[Galactic Empire]] and [[Darth Vader]]. He is aggressive to the point that he often charged into action while his fellows hung back to allow him to weaken the enemy. He is also ruthless and cruel, demonstrating a willingness to drag out the terror of an enemy before killing them. However, his impulsive streak proved to be his undoing, as he chose to rely on his damaged lightsaber to escape when faced with battling three skilled enemies at once.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[The Force]]:''' The Eighth Brother has a strong connection to the Force.
**'''Telekinesis:''' The Eighth Brother can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed.
**'''Force Sense:''' The Eighth Brother can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users.
**'''Force Jump:''' The Eighth Brother can jump or leap at great distances. His abilities were further augmented by the fact that he was a member of an alien species called Terrelian Jango Jumpers, which were well-known for their incredible agility, and leaping abilities.

====Abilities====
*'''Skilled Lightsaber Duelist:''' The Eighth Brother is a skilled lightsaber duelist.
**'''Form IV:''' The Eighth Brother has some skill in Ataru.
**'''Form VII:''' The Eighth Brother has some skill in Juiyo.
*'''Skilled Pilot:''' The Eighth Brother is skilled in piloting most types of flying crafts.

===Weapons and Equipment===
====Lightsaber====
The Eighth Brother's valued weapon and possession is his red-bladed lightsaber.
*'''[[Lightsaber|Double-bladed spinning lightsaber]]:'''The Eighth Brother had built a red-bladed double-bladed spinning lightsaber. Like all Inquisitor lightsabers, his weapon could be utilized for flight as well as combat. A feature unique to this lightsaber is that it could also function as a spinning saw blade when deactivated, as it had collapsible teeth hidden in the outer ring. It would remain in the Eighth Brother's possession until it was damaged and eventually destroyed in his duel against [[Ahsoka Tano]], [[Kanan Jarrus]], and [[Maul]].

==Role in the Series==
Sometime after the Inquisition was created, the Eighth Brother was dispatched to Malachor by [[Darth Vader]] to hunt down [[Maul]] and retrieve the [[Holocron|Sith Holocron]] from the [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith Temple]] there. 

He first appears when he ambushes Kanan, Ahsoka and Ezra, separating the latter from his two mentors. Kanan and Ahsoka pursue and eventually capture him. They then try to get some information out of him, but with little success. When a beam of energy comes out of the Temple, the Eighth Brother takes advantage of the Jedi's distraction to activate a signal. The [[Fifth Brother]] and [[Seventh Sister]] arrive and free him. Just when the Inquisitors are on the verge of victory, Ezra comes out of the Temple with Maul, who drives the trio off. Later, they learn from one of the Sister's probes that Maul found the Holocron and that Ezra has it. The Inquisitors battle Maul and the Jedi again, but they prove to be too powerful. After his lightsaber gets damaged and his comrades get killed by Maul, the Eighth Brother attempts to flee, but his lightsaber malfunctions and he plummets to his demise.

==Video Games==
===''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''===
Eighth Brother is the assist character for [[The Grand Inquisitor]], available as a Unique card.

==Trivia==
*The Eighth Brother was the fourth Inquisitor introduced in the series, the only one not to have his face seen prior to his death, and had the shortest presence in the series, dying in the same two-part episode in which he debuted.
*His death was originally depicted as surviving his fall from the [[Malachor Sith Temple]] and attempting to flee in his TIE Fighter, only to be killed when the Sith Temple completed its firing sequence.
*His ranking wasn't revealed in the episode in which he was introduced and perished, similar to how the Grand Inquisitor wasn't distinguished by any other title until after his death.
