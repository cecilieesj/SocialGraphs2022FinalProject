}}'''Balthazar Horowitz''' is a recurring background character on ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. He is a young boy with dark-blond hair who is often seen making cameos in crowd shots, first appearing in "[[Toy to the World]]". He has also occasionally taken part in [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s big ideas. His most notable role was in the episode "[[I Was a Middle Aged Robot]]", in which he twice sees [[Perry the Platypus]], in his secret agent persona, coming out the [[Lawrence Fletcher]] robot's rear end. At the end of the episode, he comes upon Perry in his pet persona and notices that he looks familiar.

Prior to [[2013]], Balthazar was known primarily as the '''Ballpit Kid''' by fans. This is due to a scene in the episode "[[No More Bunny Business]]", in which, during the "[[X-Ray Eyes]]" song sequence, Phineas and Ferb use their x-ray specs to find and retrieve Balthazar out of a ball pit that he got lost in. Balthazar's real name was eventually confirmed during season 4, with it being spoken onscreen in the episode "[[Backyard Hodge Podge]]". Notably, in "[[Troy Story]]", he officially states that "Ballpit Kid" is his nickname.
