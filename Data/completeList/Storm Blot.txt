[[File:Storm_Blot.jpg|thumb|250px]]The '''Storm Blot''' was originally the true enemy of the game of ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' before it was scrapped. If you look at the picture to the right you can see that it's actually [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] as the [[Shadow Blot]]. From what is known, Oswald actually sided with the Blot (known then as the Phantom Blot) to get revenge on [[Mickey Mouse]]. The Blot somewhat possessed Oswald, though the rabbit was willing to do this in order to achieve this new power. Mickey had to call out to Oswald to stop being a pawn in the Blot's plan and redeem himself. This, however, was scrapped in favour of making Oswald a main deuteragonist.

==Trivia==

*If you look in the first picture, Oswald/Storm Blot is actually using popular Disney characters in his plan, and some characters like [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] are seen, as well as the [[Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin]]'', [[Dopey]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and [[Liver Lips]] from the [[Country Bear Jamboree]] attraction. Whether this is taking place in [[Cartoon Wasteland|Wasteland]] or in the Real World, as well as what the Blot plans on doing with these characters, is unknown.
*The Storm Blot's plan sort of resembles [[Mizrabel]]'s in ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''.
*As seen in the second picture, the Storm Blot has all the powers the Shadow Blot has, such as spawning [[Blotlings]].
*The Storm Blot has never been used in the game, ironically making him also a forgotten character.
*The Storm Blot is mentioned in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]'', when you revisit the Blot diorama in the train tunnels. [[A.B.E.]] will say "But what Mickey didn't know was that there was another Blot, a Storm Blot, one that could destroy all of Wasteland."
