== Background ==
=== Personality ===
Arabella is a fashion maven who idolizes [[Evie]] and her style. She's very outgoing and loves the color lavender.

=== Physical Appearance ===
Arabella copies the outfits Evie wears, but in variants of purple and even has a V-braid hairstyle similar to the one Evie wore in the first ''[[disney:Descendants|Descendants]]'' film. She also wears a poison-heart necklace similar to the one Evie owns.

=== [[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel]] ===
She invited [[Ben (Descendants)|Ben]], [[Mal]], [[Evie]], [[Jay (Descendants)|Jay]], and [[Carlos De Vil|Carlos]] to attend the annual Seaside Festival, a daylong celebration held among the Merfolks. She was at her grandfather's party when the storm appeared in Auradon.

== Trivia ==
*It is unknown which of Ariel's sisters is the mother of Arabella.
**She seems to be fond of the color lavender, a color that both [[King Triton's Daughters|Alana and Andrina]] shared. One of them could possibly be Arabella's mother.
*Many people believe Arabella is the replacement for [[Melody]] since Disney sequels and spin-offs are not canon in the [[Descendants|''Descendants'']] universe.
*In the web series [[School of Secrets|''School of Secrets'']], a girl wearing a blue dress speaks about her aunt Ariel.
*She's said to be a student at [[Auradon Prep]] and that it's her first year.
*Near the end of the ''[[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Rise of the Isle of the Lost]]'', Evie designed her a dress for the Cotillion.
