{{Quote|Mr. Bluebird's on my shoulder... It's the truth, it's actual... Everything is satisfactual...|One of the lines from the musical number "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" referencing Mr. Bluebird}}

'''Mr. Bluebird''' is a minor character in the [[1946]] film, ''[[Song of the South]]''. He is sporadically referenced in the song "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]", appearing throughout the film.

==Appearances==
===''[[Song of the South]]''===
During the musical number "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]", Mr. Bluebird appears as a gag character throughout the animated sequence. He then takes Uncle Remus to a mole burrow where [[Sis Moles|three female moles]] join in chorus alongside [[Hummingbird Trio|three hummingbirds]] and later during the [[The Bees (Song of the South)|bee]] verse. He later appears at the end of the film joining alongside animated characters following the entire group skipping away during the reprise of "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah".

===Other Appearances===
Mr. Bluebird featured prominently in the [[Splash Mountain]] attractions at the Disney Parks. Unlike in the film where his dialogues only consist of chirps and whistles, Mr. Bluebird actually speaks in the ride.

He also appeared in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode, "[[Pete's One-Man Show|Pete's One Man Show]]", making a brief cameo appearance during [[Boom-Da-Boom]], where he sat on [[Pete|Pete's]] shoulder and got flicked away by him. In addition, he appears briefly, along with several other ''Song of the South'' characters, in the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short, "[[Computer.don]]".
