'''Aldetha Teach''' was [[Blackbeard]]'s 10th wife in Disney's [[1968]] movie, ''[[Blackbeard's Ghost]]''. Before she died by burning completely at the stake by Blackbeard, who found out she was actually a witch, she put a curse on him that he will always be on Earth in limbo unless there'll be a spark of human goodness in him. Her tale was also told by [[Emily Stowecroft]] to [[Steve Walker]]Â when he came to spend the night at [[Blackbeard's Inn]]. She had a bed warmer which Steve purchased at an auction for $200 and when he accidentally sat on it, he found her book of spells in it along with a spell that can bring his eyes and ears to one who is bound in limbo: "Kree, Kruh, Vergo, Gaba, Kalto, Kree", thus, allowing him to see "That's right" Blackbeard's Ghost. Her portrait can be seen in Blackbeard's room of his Inn.

==Trivia==
* Since the early 2000s [[Madame Leota]]'s book of spells in the Seance Room in the American versions of the [[Haunted Mansion]] features, "Kree, Kruh, Vergo, Gaba, Kalto, Kree" on the pages dedicated to summoning spirits from limbo.
