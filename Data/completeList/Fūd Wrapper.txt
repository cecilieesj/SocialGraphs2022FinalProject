==Background==
As a living nutritional facts bar, Fūd Wrapper was a calm cool advocate for healthy eating and good nutrition, performing "[[Always Read the Wrapper]]" to encourage people to think about what they eat and practice moderation when eating snacks. This put him at odds with the show's villains, The Excess, a heavy metal junk food band, who he forced off the stage after they lost power from a sugar crash.

===Development===
Fūd Wrapper was not originally designed as the attraction's host, only gaining the role after early recording sessions with Tone Loc proved to be fun enough for the creative team to want to work with him more.<ref>https://twitter.com/TammyTuckey/status/1287495417266147329</ref> An early pre-opening photo of the show's installation features a figure of Fūd Wrapper with open eyes instead of his trademark sunglasses, presumably being replaced or covered up shortly afterwards.

Like many of the other simplistic figures produced for Food Rocks, his skeletal remains found their way on [[Ebay]] after the attraction's closure and briefly resurfaced during the Marvelous Mechanized Magic Kingdom fan event at the [[Disneyland Hotel]] in [[2010]].
