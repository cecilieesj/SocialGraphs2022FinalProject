'''John Laurens''' was a major character in the Broadway show and film, ''[[Hamilton]]''. He is based on the real John Laurens ([[Pre-1922#1754|1754]]-[[Pre-1922#1782|1782]]), an American soldier and statesman. He is close friends with [[Alexander Hamilton]] as shown for Hamilton's grief when Laurens died.

Laurens was killed in a gunfight while leading the first African-American Battalion, whose troops did not know that war was already over.

He is portrayed by Anthony Ramos, who also plays Philip Hamilton, Alexander's son.

==Background==
===Personality===
Laurens appears to be outspoken against slavery, saying that America would never be truly free until African-Americans had the same rights as citizens. He is also very determined to succeed in ridding America of slavery, though his efforts were vain as his death had done nothing, for the surviving members of the gunfight had been returned to their masters, and slavery would not be abolished until 83 years after his death.

Laurens is also very loyal to Hamilton, attending his wedding with Elizabeth Schuyler. The musical exaggerates their relationship, almost to a Romantic Friendship.

==Appearances==

===''[[Hamilton]]''===

====Act I====
Laurens was first seen in ''Aaron Burr, Sir'', as a person who evidently voiced out his opinions, in opposition to Aaron Burr, who preferred to keep his plans "close to his chest." He was very disappointed when Burr, who was a prodigy at King's College, did not want to drop his knowledge, asking him "what he stalled for," since the revolution was eminent. He was also very quick to accept Hamilton as a friend, as opposed to his friends [[Marquis de Lafayette]] and [[Hercules Mulligan]], who were suspicious of Hamilton.

He listened with interest to Hamilton's ambitious speech about America becoming an independent country and not throwing away his shot, to which Laurens greatly admired. He voiced out his own opinions that America would never be truly free until those in bondage have the same rights as regular citizens.

He also duelled fellow general, Charles Lee, which costs Hamilton a suspension. He also participated the Battle of Yorktown which Laurens is at South Carolina. When the battle is over Lauren's father told his friends through a letter that Laurens is killed in action.
