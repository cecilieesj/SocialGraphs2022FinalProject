'''Bulda''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2013]] animated feature film ''[[Frozen]]'' and its [[2019]] [[Frozen II|sequel]]. She is a female [[Trolls (Frozen)|troll]] and the adoptive mother of [[Kristoff]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Frozen]]''===
Bulda is shown towards the beginning of the film, when [[King Agnarr]] and [[Queen Iduna]] are rushing to save [[Anna]], after she is struck by [[Elsa]]'s ice powers. A young [[Kristoff]] and [[Sven]] arrive at the scene, where Bulda adopts them.

Bulda appears later in the film, during the second meeting with the [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]] and the "[[Fixer Upper]]" song. Bulda takes Anna for Kristoff's girlfriend, along with the other female trolls, assist in dressing Anna in her troll wedding outfit.

===''[[Frozen II]]''===
Bulda plays a much smaller role, first appearing after the [[Arendelle|Arendellians]] were forced out of their home by the [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|spirits]]. She excitedly leaps onto Kristoff, exclaiming that she and the trolls have missed him.

During the climax, Bulda, Cliff, and [[Grand Pabbie]] are seen watching alongside the Arendellians as Elsa saves the kingdom from being destroyed by a massive wave.
