'''Harmony''' is a major character in the TV series [[Sing Me a Story with Belle|''Sing Me a Story with Belle'']]. She is a yellow cat who is sleepy a lot of the time.

Harmony does not like hard work, but expects the reward (such as Belle's chili in "[[Reap What You Sow]]"), and is known for taking the easy way out (same episode and "[[Taking the Easy Way Out]]"). She is also afraid of ghosts ("[[Sleepover (Sing Me a Story with Belle)|Sleepover]]").

Despite being a female, she is performed by a male puppeteer named Jeff Conover, making her one of few such characters.
