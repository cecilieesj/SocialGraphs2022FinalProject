==History==

===Background===
The shaman of songs is a Na'Vi female who lives along the  sacred Kaspavan River on the exo-moon of Pandora. She is of legendary status and known for being quite reclusive although when encountered she is quite friendly. She is known for practicing her spiritual connection to the nature of Pandora through song.

Despite being a recluse, the shaman of songs has a connection to ''[[Alpha Centauri Expeditions]]'', a human organization which oversees Earth tourism and immigration to her planet. She even recorded advertisements for them for unknown reasons; likely wanting to share the spirituality of her planet with the galaxy.

===Development History===
When the Na'Vi shaman was created, she was the most advanced [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] made for a [[Disney Parks|Disney Park]]. Because of this, she was heavily featured in advertisements and promotional-materials for ''[[Pandora: The World of Avatar]]''.

==Appearances==

===[[Na'vi River Journey]]===
The Shaman of Songs appears in the final scene of this attraction. In this attraction, riders play the role of tourists and guests of Alpha Centauri Expeditions who voyage along the Kaspavan River to experience the planet's nature.

The shaman is encountered at the end of the ride. She is seen along the river singing a spiritual song called ''[[The Shaman's Song|Way Tiretuä]] ''which'' ''is sung to represent her connection to nature and the mother goddess of her people. As she sings, unseen singers provide back up for her song to Eywa.

== Trivia ==
* There is a plan B for when the shaman's animatronic malfunctions in-which she is lowered out of view for repairs while a screen projecting the shaman in animated form replaces the AA figure.
*The shaman parallels the character of [[Trader Sam]] from the [[Jungle Cruise]], an attraction which inspired Na'vi River Journey.  Both are mystical Indigenous characters within a rainforest who appear as audio-animatronics greeting guests at the end of their attractions.
