Julie first appeared in the film, ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]''. She has the quick glove and is the team's second goalkeeper.
== Biography ==
Julie was not put into the goal until later in the movie, even after begging Coach Bombay that she wanted to play for [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)|Team USA]], since she sacrificed playing with her home team this season. Coach Bombay put in her in the goal in the first match-up against Iceland to give [[Greg Goldberg|Goldberg]] a break. However, she is thrown out of the game when she kicks two of the [[Iceland]] players in the shins for insulting her abilities as a girl. Her reputation as "The Cat" is cemented when she stops Iceland's Gunner Stahl's shot to give the Ducks the championship in the Junior Goodwill Games. She is one of the reasons the Ducks won their final games with her miracle saves. Although she is the better of the two team goalies, Julie does not become the starter until ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''. Her personality is feisty yet friendly for she wants the team to win and to be taken seriously as a female goalie.

== Playing Style ==
Julie's puck awareness and fast glove earned her the nickname "The Cat". While she primarily displays a stand-up style, she has shown that she can alternate to a butterfly style if necessary. Because of her speed and efficiency, she poses as a major threat to offensive heavy opposing teams.
