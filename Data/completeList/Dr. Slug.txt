He is a ruthless villain who is considered Public Enemy Number One in [[St. Canard]], though he only makes a single physical appearance in the show's run. He is a physician with ambitions of world domination, but although highly dangerous, he's a fairly social guy. He's on good terms with [[Megavolt]], to the point he lets him use his stuff when he has no immediate need for it himself. Dr. Slug has made his hideout in a glue warehouse, which he has given a homey touch.

===Personality===
Dr. Slug can get a little crazy when he gets carried away in dreams of his soon-to-be global conquest, but he's a fairly level-headed guy who knows it's just as important to keep a handle on daily life as it is to design the perfect scheme.

===Physical Appearance===
As his name suggests, Dr. Slug is a slug. That he's green and slimy is to be expected, but his size is that of a small garage. Though he has no legs, he has arms. His only item of wear is a head mirror.

==Appearances==
===Cartoon===
Dr. Slug's only onscreen appearance in the show has him about to slice [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] and [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]] to ribbons when he corners them in an alleyway at the very beginning of "[[Inside Binkie's Brain]]". The two only escape because Darkwing pauses the scenario so he can answer fanmail, segueing into the episode's actual story; the episode oddly does not go back to the situation with Dr. Slug at the end.

In "[[The Quiverwing Quack]]", Dr. Slug takes Negaduck's spot on the public enemy list, which infuriates Negaduck so much he goes on a huge crime spree just to be Number One again. He fails miserably.

In "[[The Frequency Fiends]]", Megavolt is flattered that Darkwing considers him his arch-enemy, having presumed that position to be held by Dr. Slug. Later, in "[[Clash Reunion]]", Dr. Slug lends Megavolt his hideout for the weekend so he has a quiet place to murder those who tormented him in high school. 

===Joe Books comics===
The running gag of Dr. Slug being the number-one public enemy despite his lack of appearances continued in the comics. In the [[Darkwing Duck: The Definitively Dangerous Edition|revised version]] of "[[Crisis on Infinite Darkwings]]", it is mentioned that, due to the destruction caused by mind-controlled alternate-universe Darkwings running rampant in St. Canard, Darkwing Duck has become Public Enemy Number One to Five, beating out Dr. Slug. (The original [[Boom! Studios]] version of the story did not mention him here.) And in the first part of "[[Orange is the New Purple]]", when Negaduck announces that he's going to "remind this stinkin' city who's public enemy number one", Gosalyn answers, "Dr. Slug?"

==Trivia==
*Dr. Slug is adapted from the giant alien slug that appears in "Comic Book Capers". Whether on purpose or not, this means that for the entirety of Dr. Slug's existence in the cartoon, he's always around in context of Megavolt. With the exception of "The Quiverwing Quack", all his episodes are Megavolt episodes and his mention in "The Quiverwing Quack" comes with one on Megavolt.
