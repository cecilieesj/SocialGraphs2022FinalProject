==Role in the Series==
Zevon was first seen hiding in the shadows, having spotted [[Mal]] and [[Freddie Facilier|Freddie]] upon their arrival at the [[Isle of the Lost]]. After Mal returned, it's revealed Zevon has been trailing Mal and spying on her and [[Evie]] while his shoes and coat were dripping wet. In "[[Chemical Reaction]]", Zevon stole chemicals from the science lab. In "[[Steal Away]]", he is given a staff by a possessed [[Mal]] and later he breaks into a store. In "[[Evil Among Us]]", he shows up at the Jewel-bilee trying to steal the VKs' jewels unseen only to be caught by Freddie, Carlos, Jay, and Jane. He reveals he escaped the Isle of the Lost while Mal and Freddie went to find Mal's jewel there and plans to fulfill his family destiny he thinks he must accomplish; taking over Auradon. CJ helped him get to Auradon on her boat. He shrinks Freddie, Carlos, Jay, and Jane and traps them in a lamp so that they cannot stop him nor warn the other heroes, but fails to grab the jewels unseen so he plans to crash the Jewel-bilee. In "[[Party Crashers]]" he crashes the party and gets the jewels. He scares everyone away and plans to combine all the jewels to gain the power to rule Auradon.

Mal and Evie arrive to stop him and he gains the upper hand when he unleashes his army of puppets he made from the Geppetto's Workshop which outnumbers them. The AKs arrive and save them. They all work together and Mal stops Zevon by taking back Jafar's staff and Birthright Jewels and freezing him with his own potions. He is sent back to the Isle of the Lost by Ben.

== Trivia ==
* Zevon has a habit of adding bizarre prefixes and suffixes to the words he speaks. This is likely a misguided way of trying to show off his intelligence.
