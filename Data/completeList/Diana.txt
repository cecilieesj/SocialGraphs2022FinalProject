'''Diana'''Â is a minor character in the "[[The Pastoral Symphony|Pastoral Symphony]]" segment of the [[1940]] film ''[[Fantasia]]''.

==Role in the film==
Diana and her pet deer were the very last characters to appear in the segment. Here, she uses the crescent moon as a bow to fire an arrow to spread stars across the sky to announce the night, ending the segment.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Diana was seen on one of the ''Fantasia'' themed floats in the former [[Magic Kingdom]] parade ''[[SpectroMagic]]'', and she made a brief appearance in ''[[World of Color]]'' at [[Disney California Adventure]], shooting an arrow that becomes [[EVE]] to transition into the ''[[Wall-E]]'' sequence.  

In [[Fantasmic!]], her arrow is seen after Mickey shoots sparks from his fingertips.

==Trivia==
* At the end of the [[1990]] reissue trailer for ''Fantasia''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 50th anniversary, when Diana fired her star arrow across the night sky, its trail formed "Walt Disney's" while the stars that fell from it formed "''Fantasia''".
* Diana is the goddess' Roman name. In [[Greece]], she is called [[Artemis]].
