'''Cyril Proudbottom''' is a supporting character and [[J. Thaddeus Toad|J. Thaddeus Toad's]] Cockney-accented horse in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1949]] short ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', a segment of the 1949 feature film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''===
Cyril first appears alongside his good friend [[J. Thaddeus Toad]], riding through the countryside singing [[The Merrily Song|''We're Merrily On Our Way'']], though on the streets they are stopped by [[Ratty]] and [[Mole (The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad)|Mole]], as sent by [[Angus MacBadger]], telling him that they must give up his gypise cart, much to the annoyance of Toad and Cyril, though they blocks their ears from Ratty's remarks, and Toad subsequently finds a new mania, a motor mania!

He is then seen at the trail of Toad, as he calls Cyril as his witness, where he comes and tells Toad's story after escaping from [[Toad Hall]], where he says that upon arriving at Cyril's they both went of, though Toad than suddenly a motor car, interesting him, seeing it stop at a tavern , where [[Weasels]] are getting off, with Cyril being ordered to guard the motor car while he tries to but it, but because he had no money, he used the "honest way of bargaining" (with [[The Prosecutor]] asking him what is the honest way, Cyril joking that he knew he wouldn't know), as Toad traded Toad Hall for the motor car, startling everyone. After [[Mr. Winkie]] said that Toad tried to sell him a stolen motor car, Cyril defends Toad, calling Winkie a liar.

Later, since it was Christmas, Cyril disguised himself as Toad's (who was put in prison) grandmother, and was allowed to speak with Toad, telling Toad of a plan to escape, interesting him (though he lost his reforming ways of his manias).

He is then seen at the end of the segment, after Toad's name was cleared, much to the horror of Ratty, Mole and MacBadger, he is seen alongside Toad riding on an airplane, with Toad calling them to join him, waving alongside Cyril.

===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===
Cyril makes an appearance at the end of the short film, as a reformed [[Scrooge McDuck|Ebenezer Scrooge]] runs through the streets and meeting his nephew [[Donald Duck|Fred]] (portrayed by [[Donald Duck]]), he is seen as Fred's horseman on his cart, with Scrooge telling him that he will come to his family dinner. After leaving, Fred points out to Cyril that Scrooge has changed.

===Other appearances===
In ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', Cyril made a cameo appearance during the final scene with the other Toons of Toontown (though his fur color was light brown).

Cyril appears in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode, [[Dumb Luck|''Dumb Luck'']] as a horse that [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] is trying to get a lucky horseshoe from him, only to be kicked in the process, as throughout the episode, due to a broken mirror, the mouse was experiencing Bad Luck.

Cyril appears in statue form in ''[[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]'', holding up Toad.
