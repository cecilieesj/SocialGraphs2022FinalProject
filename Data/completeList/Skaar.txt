'''Skaar''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appeared in ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'', played by Wil Deusner.

Skaar was created by Greg Pak, Klaus Janson, and John Romita, Jr. 

==Background==
===Powers and Abilities===
He has gamma-powered superhuman strength and agility.

==Appearances==
===''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''===
Skaar was sent through a dimensional portal, by Annihilus, to battle and defeat the [[Hulk]]. During an intense fight between the two, [[Red Hulk|Red]] shows up and renders Skaar temporarily unconscious with a large missile, and he is then carried back to Hulk's Gamma Base, where they place him inside an anti-gravity holding chamber.

Unfortunately for S.M.A.S.H., Skaar notices a crack in the chamber and uses a Thunder Clap to break free and steal a gamma powered laser cannon. The cannon is used to stabilize the dimensional portal over Vista Verde, effectively allowing Annihilus to send through an army of bugs and begin his invasion of Earth. As Hulk and Red try to fight the insects, and hold off the invasion, [[A-Bomb|Rick Jones]] comes to the rescue with the Sandblaster. When he accidentally overloads its gamma core, the resulting explosion destabilizes the portal and thwarts Annihilus' plans, but not before Skaar and Red and are carried through the closing portal and into the Negative Zone.

===''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]''===
Skaar appears at the final moments of the ''She-Hulk: Attorney at Law'' episode "[[Whose Show is This?]]", portrayed by Wil Deusner.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Skaar is the son of Hulk and Caiera and brother of Hiro-Kala in the Planet Hulk and World War Hulk story arcs.
