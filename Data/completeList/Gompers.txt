The goat usually finds his way inside the Mystery Shack, and at one point, ate all of the household's tin cans.

==Role in the series==
Gompers first appears in "[[Tourist Trapped]]", standing on [[Dipper Pines|Dipper's]] bed and nibbling on [[Mabel Pines|Mabel's]] sweater. Gompers later nibbles on the pages of book ''[[Journal 3|3]]'' at the forest. At the end of the episode, the goat picks up a trapped [[Gnomes (Gravity Falls)|gnome]] in its mouth and runs off with him.

The goat appears next in "[[Headhunters]]", appearing outside the Mystery Shack a couple of times during the time of the murder of [[Grunkle Stan|a wax sculpture]] of Stan. He is also mentioned to be responsible for eating all of the Pines family's tin cans.

He is also seen in the end credits of the same episode where Stan is being lazy and dancing at the same time, where he attempts to steal Stan's fez, which they have a tug of war over.

==Appearance==
