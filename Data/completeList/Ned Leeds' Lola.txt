Lola is [[Ned Leeds]]' grandmother, who attended to her grandson and [[Michelle Jones]] at her home while the two of them waited to hear from [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] after the battle at [[Happy Hogan]]'s condominium. When Leeds inadvertantly opened an Inter-Dimensional Portal, Lola gasped and commented on the confirmation of her belief that there was magic in their family. As Leeds and Jones believed that the [[The Amazing Spider-Man|person]] they saw in a Spider-Man Suit on the other side of the portal was Parker, they called to him. He entered Lola's home through the portal, and upon the realization that it was not Parker, Lola screamed, threw a pillow at the stranger, and panickedly left the room. As the stranger explained that he was Peter Parker from another world and was not a threat, Lola cautiously reentered the room. After Parker jumped and stuck his hand in the ceiling to prove he was Spider-Man, Lola asked Parker, with her grandon's translation, if he could clean up the cobwebs in the corner of the ceiling while he was up there, which Parker reluctantly did, to Lola's appreciation. When Leeds opened another portal in an attempt to find their universe's Peter Parker only to find another alternate [[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man|Parker]], the two Spider-Men had a brief bout of shooting webs at each other, prompting Lola to complain about the mess that they were making and ask if they could clean up the webs that they had shot. The Parkers apologized and agreed to clean up their mess, and Lola announced that she was going to bed for the night.
