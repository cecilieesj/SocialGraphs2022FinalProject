The '''Screamin' Banshee''' is a minorÂ antagonist in ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]''.

==Role in the [[Mater and the Ghostlight|short]]==
"The Screamin' Banshee lurks outside of [[Radiator Springs]] in [[Ornament Valley]]. The Banshee waits for anyone who wanders out alone in the darkness of night. He is rarely spotted but is well known through myths and legends. Nothing can make the Banshee show fear. However, he is a bit puzzled by [[Mater]]."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20111127083841/http://www.carsdriveingallery.com/Banshee.html Banshee's bio on Cars Drive-In Gallery] (archived)</ref>

In a post-credits scene, the Banshee comes to spook Mater, who is unaware that it is him, and warns him to look out for the Banshee, before heading back to his home. The Banshee is left completely puzzled.

==Trivia==
*The Screamin' Banshee appears to be inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Banshee|Banshee]], an Irish legend, that is said to be a female spirit. However, the Banshee is said by Mater to be male.
*He is the first character in the [[Cars (franchise)|''Cars'' series]] to have an excavator's bucket for a jaw. The second is Dr. Frankenwagon's monster, from ''[[Monster Truck Mater]]''.
*In [[2010]], the Italian-published ''Cars Magazine''<nowiki/>'s issue 31 contained a one-page comic story involving the Banshee (known in the Italian-language version of the short as "la Strega urlante", "the Screaming witch" and referred to as a female), though the name is never said, titled "Chi urla, adesso?" ("Who is screaming, now?"). It (referred to in the comic as a male), accompanied by Mater, meets [[Lightning McQueen]] and [[Luigi]], but, before Mater is given the time to explain, Lightning salutes him as "ragazzone" ("big boy"), and then, as it rages, Mater, escaping, explains that the Banshee hates that name.
*The Banshee is a hybrid of a crane (hook arm), a large dump truck (wheels), an excavator (bucket arm and mouth), and a typical commercial freight truck (chassis). He also resembles a heavily-modified International S-Series dump truck.
