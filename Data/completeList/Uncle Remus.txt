His first film appearance was in Disney's [[1946]] hit ''[[Song of the South]]'' in which he narrates the animated segments, telling the [[Br'er Rabbit]] stories.
==Personality==
Uncle Remus is a kindly man who passes folktales along to the next generation of children.{{Stubsection}}

==''Song of the South''==
Uncle Remus meets the protagonist Johnny after the child decides to run away from home. He tells Johnny a tale of [[Br'er Rabbit]] running away from his home which helps change Johnny's mind on the matter and Unlce Remus returns him to the plantation. As the two bond with stories of Br'er Rabbit, Johnnyâ€™s mother becomes concerned that the stories are becoming a bad influence on Johnny and asks Uncle Remus to not spend any more time with him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, he decides to leave for Atlanta.

After Johnny is attacked by a bull, he returns to the plantation at Johnny's request where he tells Johnny a tale of Br'er Rabbit and the Laughing Place, and the boy pulls through.

At the end of the film, he walks down a road with Johnny, his friends, and characters from his own stories in an animated variation of a sunset.

==Other appearances==
===Disney Parks===
Uncle Remus is not seen in [[Splash Mountain]]. However, the famous lines he says when telling his stories appear on the walls in the queue and exit areas.

Also, Br'er Frog substitutes for the role of Uncle Remus, as seen at the very beginning of the ride as he proceeds to spin a [[Br'er Rabbit]] yarn.

==Trivia==
*[[James Baskett]], the actor who portrayed Uncle Remus, was given an honorary Oscar in [[1948]] for the portrayal of the character in [[Song of the South|''Song of the South'']].  He became the second African-American to ever win an Academy Award, the other being Hattie McDaniel for her supporting role in ''Gone with the Wind'' who, funny enough, starred in ''Song of the South'' and is seen onscreen with him. Sadly, 44-year-old James Baskett died four months later from a heart attack, brought on by diabetes.
*In the Italian dub, Uncle Remus was renamed "Zio Tom", whose literal translation is "Uncle Tom", because the character of Uncle Tom is more well-known in [[Italy]]. It is ironic, as ''[[Song of the South]]'' is often considered by some to be a revisionist film.
