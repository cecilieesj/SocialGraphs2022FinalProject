The '''Giant''' is a character who appears in the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] attraction, [[Sindbad's Storybook Voyage]]. He is a large green giant whom [[Sindbad]] encounters on his voyage.

==History==

===Background===
The Giant is shown to be the guardian of a hidden cave known as the Cave of the Giant. He is shown to be hostile to anyone who takes his treasure and those who take his treasure and could result in a trap.

===Development History===
When the Sindbad's Storybook Voyage attraction opened as Sindbad's Seven Voyages, the attraction was very unpopular to guests due to its scary theme featuring the giant being a threat to Sindbad and his crew. After the attraction closed in 2006 and reopened in 2007, the theme was toned down and features the Giant being less antagonistic to Sindbad throughout the attraction.

==Role in the attraction==

===Pre-2007 revamp===

In the original iteration of the attraction, the Giant is furiously seen watching Sindbad and his crew take the treasure inside the Cave of the Giant to which as Sindbad and his crew take it, they escape with the Giant furiously attacking them and being more of an obstacle, he is seen holding Sindbad's crew as Sindbad raises his sword to keep the giant away from attacking his crew to which Sindbad and his crew manage to survive the ambush and arrive at the Palace of the Sultan in [[India]].

===Post-2007 revamp===
In the retooled version of the attraction, Sindbad enters the Cave of the Giant where Sindbad is seen planning to rescue the Giant rather than take his treasure. Using a feather from the rocs at Rukh Island, Sindbad successfully frees him. Having rescued him, Sindbad and the Giant (who is gently using a string instrument) sing "[[Compass of Your Heart]]" together with each other just as the Giant happily sends Sindbad and [[Chandu]] on their way to India where they encounter the Sultan of India living in the Palace of the Sultan.

==Trivia==
*In certain versions of the original story of Sindbad (such as the translation by Richard Burton), the Giant is depicted as a cyclops (specifically implied to be Polyphemus).
