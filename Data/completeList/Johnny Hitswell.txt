==Quotes==
"Seriously what did you think? That I was going to dump you for a super model or something?"

"We'll You should've known better. Geez Riley."

==Trivia==
*In the episode "[[Garage Sale Daring]]", Johnny mentions that he has a brother. Unfortunately, his brother is never shown, but showed only his room. In "[[Extra Credit]]", Johnny has a little sister. This issue has not been explained by the writers, otherwise his brother may have been scrapped before "Extra Credit" and rather for Johnny to have a sister instead.
