==Role in the film==
Jack is first seen in his office looking at the sawmill outside through a window. Later, he is being warned by [[Grace Meacham]] not to cut down trees due to [[Gavin Magary|Gavin]]'s plan just as Grace and Jack's daughter [[Natalie Magary|Natalie]] wanders away while [[Pete (Pete's Dragon)|Pete]] stares at her. Later, Jack rushes into the woods to find Natalie, along with Grace and a group of rangers questioning her to which Natalie she tells them that she was following Pete.

As Jack and Gavin walk across the woods, Jack suggests Gavin that the woods should be locked until further notice linked to Pete to which they later arrive at the spot where Jack parked his truck to which he explains to Gavin that the construction workers have nothing to cut down by Grace's orders.

At home, Jack discusses with his girlfriend Grace about finding a plan where Pete belongs to. Later during the "It's a Good Day" montage, Jack and Grace look at a map of the Millhaven woods, followed by Jack getting a phone call. Later, he approaches Gavin outside the house who asks him to remember if [[Conrad Meacham|Mr. Meacham]] told them a story about dragons where he explains that he encountered the dragon Elliot in the neighborhood and tried to hunt him down, but destroyed his gun to which Jack denies that he cannot stay up in the forest at midnight to his glare. Back at home, Jack reads the book "Elliot Gets Lost", the book which Pete once read during a family vacation before his parents died during a car accident.

The next day, Jack, his girlfriend, Pete, his daughter Natalie, and Mr. Meacham arrive at the sawmill to see Gavin and arrives at his office where he asks Sheriff Dentler who asks him about Grace bringing Pete by while reading a note linked to capturing a dragon. He later arrives at the woods looking for his daughter. Jack later approaches a wounded Elliot whom Jack explains that he caught the dragon.

Arriving at the sawmill, Jack returns to his office talking privately not noticing Elliot being put inside the warehouse. He then escorts Natalie into a safe place while Grace devises a plan to fix the situation about Elliot. Later at the warehouse where Elliot is at, Jack tries to stop one of Gavin's minions from killing Elliot, causing Gavin to fear that this would make the dragon go on a rampage across the town of Millhaven. Outside the warehouse, Jack approaches [[Gene Dentler|Sheriff Dentler]] alongside Gavin about the situation of Elliot to which Dentler asks the two if it would be appropriate to look inside the warehouse where Elliot is at.

As Jack and the rest of the crowd enter the warehouse, the crowd notices that Elliot has disappeared just as Grace explains to Jack that Elliot is still in the warehouse. After Elliot has escaped thanks to Mr. Meacham's plan, Jack and the rest of the crowd manage to chase Elliot across the highway. Later, Jack and Grace drive across the bridge to look at Elliot as Dentler's convoy approaches the bridge just as Elliot breathes fire to protect Elliot only for Natalie and Pete to stop this. Ultimately, Elliot helps stop the truck Jack and Grace are at and rescues them from falling off the burning bridge due to his plan to stop Sheriff Dentler's convoy.

Furthermore, Jack, Grace, and Natalie return home and happily gaze upon Elliot flying in the sky thanks to Elliot who saved the family. During the epilogue, Jack joins with Pete, Natalie, and Grace seeing Elliot fly with a flock of dragons in the sky in rejoice.
