'''Sticky Webb''' was one of the main characters of the [[Disney Channel]] animated original series, ''[[The Proud Family]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Proud Family]]''===
He is one of [[Penny Proud|Penny]]'s best friends who acts like a cool dude even though he is smart. In the first episode,<ref>[[Bring It On]]</ref> he warns Penny about [[The Gross Sisters]]' plan of getting rid of [[LaCienega Boulevardez]]. Throughout the whole series, he is being annoyed by [[Dijonay Jones]], who has a huge crush on him. He is Penny's male friend and Dijonay's love interest, although he dislikes her rather strong come-ons. Though he does have feelings for her, he only let those show once in one episode. He is very intelligent and knows a lot about computers. Sticky is still upset because his parents got a divorce.<ref>The Altos</ref> He is also short and has a funny way of showing that he has a crush on Dijonay. Sticky is very good at figuring things out, like puzzles and anything involving technology. As shown in ''[[The Proud Family Movie]]'', his cousin is rapper [[Fifteen Cent]], a parody of rapper [[Wikipedia:50 Cent|50 Cent]].<ref>''[[The Proud Family Movie]]''</ref>

===''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]]''===
Sticky makes only a brief silent cameo in the first episode "[[New Kids on the Block]]". He leaves a note behind for Penny, telling her that his father got a new job in Japan. While his father gave him a chance to stay with his cousins, he ultimately chose to leave with him because he could not stand being around Dijonay. Penny stops reading the letter before she could say the full name; leading Dijonay to believe that another girl named "Dijo" chased him away.

==Trivia==
*Sticky's sometimes implied to have a crush on Penny.
*Sticky's similar to [[Cornelius Fillmore]] from ''[[Fillmore!]]'' and [[Eddie Thomas]] from [[That's So Raven|''That's So Raven'']], all of whom are portrayed by [[Orlando Brown]].
**All three of them are the African-American male best friends to the show's female lead.
**For Eddie, both he and Sticky are also the children of divorced parents (though Eddie's parents appear to still be friends at least) and are also implied to have feelings for the show's female lead.
**In the revival's first episode "New Kids on the Block", he has a silent cameo due to troubled problems.
