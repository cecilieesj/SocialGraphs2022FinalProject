==Appearances==
===''[[102 Dalmatians]]''===
Fluffy first appears at the beginning of the movie when Cruella is released from her conviction. [[Alonzo]] gives Fluffy to Cruella as a present. She mistakes his growling for "smiling" and names him Fluffy, despite having a lack of fur. He is often seen growling whenever Cruella is around. He also helps [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] and [[Dipstick]] escape from Cruella's mansion later on.

In the final scene, Alonzo brings Fluffy to the dog shelter when he delivers Cruella's fortune to Chloe and Kevin.
===''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''===
FluffyÂ makes an appearance in the video game ''102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue''.

In the game, the factor of Fluffy being [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]]'s dog is never brought up. He first meets the pups in the British Museum, where he asks them to place the many misplaced exhibits back to their proper locations, along with asking for a jelly doughnut, which he later reveals to be for him, since he is hungry. [[Domino]] or [[Oddball]] then advise him to not eat too many doughnuts.

They later meet up with him in Cruella's toy factory, since he himself got captured by Cruella's toys too. Fortunately, since he is skinny, he was able to squeeze through one of the air holes. He guides the pups through the factory, up to their final confrontation with Cruella.

==Trivia==
*Fluffy is the third De Vil pet in Disney adaptations, the other two being [[Scorch]] and [[Vendella De Vil|Vendella]] from ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''.
*Fluffy was created solely for ''102 Dalmatians'' and has no animated counterpart.
