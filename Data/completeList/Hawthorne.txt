'''Hawthorne''' is a character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2018]] movie ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. He is the Regent of the Land of Flowers, portrayed by [[Eugenio Derbez]].

==Background==
Hawthorne was brought to life by Marie Stahlbaum as she created the Four Realms and became its queen. Hawthorne was given to rule over the Land of Flowers while the other regents; [[Mother Ginger]], [[Shiver]], and [[The Sugar Plum Fairy]] were given to rule the other three realms; the Land of Amusements, the Land of Snowflakes, and the Land of Sweets. However, Marie left the Four Realms to be with her family, leaving Hawthorne and the regents saddened by her departure.

Unknown to the other regents, however, Sugar Plum was the most angered and saddened at Marie's departure so she sought to conquer all Four Realms to ease her pain. Mother Ginger discovered Sugar Plum's plot and attempted to stop her, only to be framed by the latter; causing Hawthorne and Shiver to side with Sugar Plum, believing Mother Ginger to try to take the Four Realms as a result instead of Sugar Plum. This lead to Hawthorne and his realm, along with the other regents and their realms to go to into war with Mother Ginger and the Fourth Realm. As Hawthorne continued to aid the other realms in the war against Mother Ginger, he, along with Shiver, was still unaware that Sugar Plum was the real traitor and was still seeking to conquer all the realms as she searched for a key for a machine Marie used that would allow her to turn those against her back into toys.

==Appearances==

===''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''===
As [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] and [[Phillip the Nutcracker|Captain Phillip]] arrive at the Palace of the Four Realms, Hawthorne introduces himself as the Regent of the Land of Flowers, followed by [[Shiver]] who also introduces himself as the Regent of the Land of Snowflakes. He and Shiver introduces [[The Sugar Plum Fairy|Sugar Plum]] as the Regent of the Land of Sweets. As Clara explains that her mother Marie passed away, the Regents all react in shock as Shiver shares a condolence with Clara for the loss of her mother and as the Regents bring Clara to Marie's throne, Clara explains to them that she was looking for the key for Marie's last gift to which the regents explain that access to the Land of Amusements (the Fourth Realm) is forbidden by law of the Regents. Hawthorne then devises a plan to organize a pageant for Clara followed by Shiver who is planning a tour of the Realms.

Hawthorne is later present attending the pageant of Clara followed by Clara watching the ballet telling the story of the Four Realms. When Clara is given a tour across the Four Realms, Clara rides on a carriage with Hawthorne boarding it while Clara receives bouquets of flowers from the citizens of the Land of Flowers.

Later at the observatory, Hawthorne and Shiver are locked up at the observatory due to Sugar Plum's betrayal to the Four Realms by sending an army of tin soldiers to destroy the Four Realms. After Sugar Plum is transformed into a lifeless porcelain via Engine, Hawthorne, Shiver, and [[Mother Ginger]] praise Clara for saving the Four Realms just as Mother Ginger sends Phillip to return Clara to the Christmas Tree Forest and return to his new post there.
