==Role in the short==
Bass is a musician who was playing the same tune over and over again, with his multiple brass instruments. He attempts that the [[Tippy|little girl]], whose name was Tippy, in front of him would tip him a coin. But soon after, another musician, named [[Treble]], who was a flashy and sophisticated newcomer, ups the tempo with his string accompaniment and charm.

They soon instantly become rivals, and fight over the Tippy's coin. But soon after that, Tippy accidentally drops the coin into a drain, and cries, and gets so angry at the two musicians. She requests for them to give her a replacement coin, but they reveal they are poor and broke. She takes one of the violins from the orchestra one-man-band, retuned it, and played an unexpectedly impressive tune.

A rich man, pleased by her performance, gives her a big bag of coins, and Tippy eagerly picks it up. Before leaving, she takes two coins for the one-man-bands and tosses them into the top of a fountain, where she was originally going to put her coin in for a wish. Soon after the two musicians work together in an attempt at reaching the top, where the two coins remain.
