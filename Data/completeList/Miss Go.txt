'''Miss Go''' is a character from the television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''. She appeared in the episode "[[Rewriting History]]". She is not to be confused with [[Shego]]'s alter ego from "[[Stop Team Go]]".
==History==
She was hired by [[Bartholomew Lipsky]] to steal [[Professor Demens]]' invention, the Electrostatic Illuminator.

She is implied to be an ancestor to [[Shego]], but the relationship was unstated. However, since the entire episode but for the final three minutes was a dream, her existence as a "real" person is debatable.

==Notes==
*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after Kim and Ron wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Miss Go was "real".
