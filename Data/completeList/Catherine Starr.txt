Catherine Starr was the wife of [[Egghead|Dr. Elihas Starr]]. Elihas was a researcher studying Quantum Energy with [[Hank Pym]] and [[Bill Foster]] for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. When Elihas attempted to steal Pym's work, Hank had him fired from S.H.I.E.L.D. and discredited. Elihas took Catherine and their daughter, [[Ghost|Ava]], to Argentina where he could continue his research. An experimental Quantum Tunnel failed, and Quantum Energy threatened to destroy his lab. Catherine attempted to get to safety with Ava while Elihas stayed behind to salvage his work. Ava, however, took off after her father, and Catherine ran after her. Catherine and Elihas were killed when the Quantum Tunnel exploded, while Ava was left quantumly entangled.
