'''Mr. Flour''', also known as '''Chef Flour''' and credited simply as '''Baker''', is a supporting character in the [[2019]] television series ''[[Amphibia]]''

==Background==
===Personality===
Mr. Flour seems to be one of the more well adjusted citizens of Wartwood. While he too can be annoyed at the antics of the Plantars, he is less likely to lash out at them. He is a lot more concerned with the well being of his daughters whom he loves dearly. However, he does seem to acknowledge that they can handle themselves as he was unfazed at Maddie threatening harm on her younger sisters. It could be that he is simply used to their unusual hobbies. He was insistent on Sprig getting married to his daughter, but upon the two of them breaking it off, showed no ill will towards the matter, nor did he seem to remember or bring it up.

===Physical appearance===
He is a blue, short frog, with a deep brow line and yellow eyes with purple pupils. He has purple stripes and dots along his back and a light-sky-blue underbelly. He often wears an apron, with several stains, dark grey pants, light brown shirt and a baker's hat.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Anne or Beast?]]", Mr. Flour makes his first appearance where he hears [[One-Eyed Wally]] inform of his encounter with a monster in the woods. Mr. Flour joins a mob in hunting down the monster who turns out to be a human girl named [[Anne Boonchuy]]. After Anne saves the mob from a giant red mantis, Mr. Flour leaves the with the rest of the mob when [[Mayor Toadstool]] allows [[Hop Pop Plantar]] to have Anne live with him.

After throwing his dough into an oven, Mr. Flour told them in exchange for giving them dough, [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] had to marry his daughters, [[Maddie Flour|Maddie]]. Anne accepted and Mr. Flour gave them some dough. He is later present with Maddie as the crowd started throwing stuff at Anne and the Plantars in the cage of shame, telling everyone that Sprig is his son-in-law.

In "[[Civil Wart]]", he and the rest of townspeople watch a movie called Love Choice after the movie had come to an end he gets into a fight with some frog over who Constance should pick: Hunter or Alistar. Mr. Flour joins Polly and those who chose Hunter over Alister.
