{{Quote|What you brought me today is worth... one quarter portion.|Unkar Plutt to [[Rey]]|Star Wars: The Force Awakens}}

'''Unkar Plutt''' is a minor antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.

==Background==
Unkar was the only Junk Boss on Niima Outpost, exchanging parts for Scavengers' rations. He also stole the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' from the Irving Boys and began to modify it (detrimentally, according to [[Rey]]). It was also indicated that he looked after Rey during her childhood on [[Jakku]]. However, he was not above verbal abuse towards her or taking advantage of her due to his belief that she was just another asset for him to use.

==Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''===
At the first glance, the Crolute junk boss may looked like a mere abusive slavedriver for scavengers that worked for him, including Rey. But upon seeing Rey with the lost [[BB-8]], he reports the droid's location to the [[First Order]], revealing that he is either a First Order sympathizer or simply seeks a reward. When Rey and the defector [[First Order Stormtroopers|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]] steal the ''Millennium Falcon'' from him only a few minutes later (not realizing its significance), he angrily demands them to return it to him.

Though he is not seen again in the finished film, it is revealed in a deleted scene (and the novelization) that he followed the group to [[Takodana]]. After Rey and Finn sought the help of [[Maz Kanata]] alongside [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], Plutt confronted Rey and threatened her, causing Chewbacca to intervene. When the angry Crolute declared he was not afraid of what he considered to be "half a [[Wookiees|wookiee]]", Chewbacca showed Plutt the error of his judgment by easily and casually ripping off the screaming Plutt's right arm and tossing it onto a nearby table as Rey watched in shock.

===''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition]]''===
He appears as a cast member of the game.
