==Background==
They are all dressed up in pearl buttons and sing "[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]". A lady in a magenta dress plays the tambourine, a short man in a black suit plays the bass drum, a tall man in a black suit plays the [[wikipedia:bones (instrument)|bones]], another short man in a black suit plays a stringy click instrument that looks like a banjo with a cymbal attached to it, and a lady in a blue dress plays the violin. Only the drummer speaks.

The band is based on the Pearlies or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearly_Kings_and_Queens Pearly Kings and Queens], working-class organizations who traditionally sew mother of pearl buttons to their extravagant suits and dresses to raise money for [[London]] charities.

==Appearances==
===''Mary Poppins''===
As said above, the band only appears during the end of the animated sequence where they perform the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious". Throughout the sequence, they end up playing the song just as [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] and [[Bert]] sing along as [[Jane Banks|Jane]] and [[Michael Banks|Michael]] enjoy the performance and the rest of the animated characters dance along. At the end of the song, they are last seen leaving after the thunderstorm in the real world arrives, just as Mary, Bert, Jane, and Michael leave the animated sequence.
