Thomas Jefferson's ghost also appears in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. He is depicted as an anthropomorphic dog and appears in the seventh episode, "[[Mount Rushmore or Less]]". In the episode, Jefferson, aided by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], approaches and confronts [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose]] to prevent the two from causing more havoc in Mount Rushmore. As a result, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln dislodge the two out of Mount Rushmore, followed by Washington undoing the spell Sheldgoose has caused to the statues in the hall dedicated to Washington's life. Washington explains to Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt that Sheldgoose is the one who knows where the [[Spark of Life]] is at, just as the Caballeros are deemed as eternal guardians of the Spark just before [[Xandra]], [[José Carioca]], [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], and [[Donald Duck]] return to Clinton Coot's Cabana.

Later when Felldrake prepares for a new age of darkness, Jefferson and the other three presidential ghosts are sent back to Mount Rushmore via zoom point as it is shown that the reinforcements summoned during the final battle are sent back to their respective homes.
