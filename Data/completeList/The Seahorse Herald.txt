==Appearances==
===''[[The Little Mermaid]]''===
He is first seen at the royal concert, announcing the arrivals of [[King Triton]] and the court composer, [[Sebastian]]. Later, he is seen telling Sebastian that King Triton wants to speak to him about [[Ariel]]'s lovestruck behavior, causing Sebastian to mistakenly think that he knows that Ariel is in love with a human, which in turn causes him to accidentally blurt out the secret and anger Triton enough that he destroys Ariel's secret grotto. He is last seen when Triton (having regretted at what he has done) has ordered a search for his daughter to apologize at what he had done and Sebastian and asks him if any traces of them have been found. He answers no and is ordered to keep looking for them, leaving no shells unturned and coral unexplored and no one sleeps until they return home safe. After he left, Triton then blames himself for his daughter's disappearance and regretting at what he had done and his bad behavior.

===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)]]'' and ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea|Return to the Sea]]''===
The Herald also appears in the TV series of ''The Little Mermaid'' and the sequel. From the series, he is seen reading the scrolls while in the sequel, he reports to King Triton that Ariel has returned to Atlantica to search for Melody.
