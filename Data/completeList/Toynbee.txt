'''Toynbee''' is one of the minions of [[Pete|Pete's]] historical counterpart from the episode "[[Sherlock Goof]]", from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
He attempted to steal the key to the Tower of London from [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald]], but was stopped inadvertently by [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]]. He later tries to kill Sherlock, but ultimately fails.

===Personality===
Toynbee is incompetent, blurting out [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] name when [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald]] wondered who would be behind stealing the Tower's key. However, he is also sly, being able to enter Sir Reginald's home without anyone, other than [[Sparky (Goof Troop)|Sparky]], noticing; nonetheless, he is quite daft when it comes to larger tasks, such as asassinating [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]].

===Physical appearance===
Toynbee is a short, overweight anthropomorphic dog with black hair. He wears a blue jacket, a light blue collared shirt, gray pants, black shoes, and a dark blue newsboy cap. When burglaring, he also wears a black mask around his eyes.

===Role in the series===
His only appearance is in the episode, "[[Sherlock Goof]]". He initally is tasked with stealing the Tower of London's key by [[Pete|Professor Inferiority]], but after he fails to do so, he is then helped by another of the Professor's henchmen to kill [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]], and also fails.

==Trivia==
*Jim Cummings voices Toynbee with an impression of [[Andy Devine]], just as he does for [[Herb and Binkie Muddlefoot|Herb Muddlefoot]] in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.
