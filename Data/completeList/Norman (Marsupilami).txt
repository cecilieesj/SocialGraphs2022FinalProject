==Appearances==
===[[Marsupilami (TV series)|Marsupilami]]===
Mr. Norman (''"[[Working Class Mars]]"'') or Dr. Normanstein (''"[[Marsupilami Meets Dr. Normanstein]]"'') is Marsupilami's main "Bad Guy" - a large and mean-spirited human male who plays the part of anything from a common bully or even a witch (''"[[The Wizard of Mars]]"'') in a parody of ''The Wizard of Oz''.

===[[Raw Toonage]]===

==Trivia==
*Norman is very similar to [[Quint]] from ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'', as they both have varying roles with different first names relating to their jobs, they both have shaven faces, and they both serve as frequent antagonists, making them the archenemies of the heroes.
