==Role in the short==
Although he's just in Donald's imagination, Paddy accused Donald for stealing pearls and tried to find out where the pearls are and who really has them. But in the end, it turns out he's the thief. When confronted with this development, he attempts to murder everyone for exposing him, especially Donald, whom he accuses of "[getting him] into this".
