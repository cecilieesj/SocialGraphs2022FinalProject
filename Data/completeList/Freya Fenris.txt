'''Freya Fenris''' is a character who appears in the animated series, ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]''. Dedicated to protecting the [[Colossus (location)|Colossus]] platform, she stands apart from the rest of the boisterous crew with both a cool methodical and calculating personality. She transforms her icy precision into blazing hot flight maneuvers, and her ship also stands out with its fiery red finish.

==Trivia==
*Freya is the second ''[[Star Wars]]'' character to be voiced by [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]], who previously voiced [[Arihnda Pryce]] in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.
*Her name alludes to the goddess {{WikipediaLink|Freyja}} and the wolf {{WikipediaLink|Fenrir|Fenris}}, two figures from Norse mythology.
