==Background==
===Personality===
Beatrice and Daphne are both very kind. However, both had contrasting personalities; Beatrice is more serious and strict, while Daphne likes to have fun. Both are determined to help Cinderella adjust to her new life.

===Physical appearance===
Beatrice is tall and slender with sandy-blonde hair and dark blue eyes and wears a cornflower blue dress. Daphne is shorter and chubbier with brown hair and blue eyes and wears a salmon pink dress.

==Role in the film==
Beatrice and Daphne appear in the segment "Aim to Please" as [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s ladies-in-waiting. They appear to be much less stern than [[Prudence]]. While Cinderella has trouble becoming a princess, they show her the ropes. They dress her up and they quiz her about what they will use at the banquet. Although they catch on fairly quickly when Cinderella starts making more drastic changes to life in the castle. Daphne is later seen at the banquet as she dropped the pudding on the King, and at the end when she dropped the pie on [[Pom-Pom]], while Beatrice makes no further appearances.

==Trivia==
*Daphne is similar to [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Merryweather]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. This is especially due to her looks and wit.
*Their role in preparing Cinderella is quite similar to that of the woman who was preparing [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] for [[the Matchmaker]].
*Neither of them appears in the third film. This is probably due to budget reasons.
*After the events of the sequels, [[Anastasia Tremaine]] left her estranged family behind and Cinderella let her move into the [[King's Castle|palace]], subsequently making Anastasia her third lady-in-waiting, alongside Beatrice and Daphne.
