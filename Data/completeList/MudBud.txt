'''MudBud''' is a golden retriever puppy who appears, along with his siblings, in the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' film series]].

==History==
MudBud is the filthiest of all the Buddies, hence his name. He wears a blue handkerchief for a collar and usually ends his sentences with "Dude." He likes rolling in dirt patches and hates getting soapy baths. In ''[[Snow Buddies]]'', the white snow he was trudging through washed away all the mud on his fur, much to his dismay. Luckily, when the Buddies arrived back in Fernfield, MudBud rolled in a patch of dirt to make his fur look like the way it used to be. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Pete, a boy who was at first addicted to handheld video games, until MudBud taught him how to loosen up and be more outgoing.

==Trivia==
*To date, ''[[Snow Buddies]]'' is the only ''[[Air Bud (series)|Air Buddies]]'' installment in which MudBud temporarily loses his dirtiness.
*He is very similar to [[Ample Grime]] from ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' in that they are both obsessed with filth, but unlike Ample Grime who is a villain, MudBud is a hero.
*In ''[[Santa Buddies]]'', he is shown wearing a red handkerchief.
*According to [[Buddha]] in ''[[Treasure Buddies]]'', MudBud appears to have the spirit of his great-grandfather, Digger, inside him due to the fact that they both love dirt.
