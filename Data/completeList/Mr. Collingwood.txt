==History==
Mr. Collingwood's first notable role is in Test of the Tested. After he had given his class the S.A.T.T.Y. 9 test and talking with Ingrid when she's the first to finish, he's then seen in the school's hallway wheeling boxes of answer sheets to the test. There he meets the school's mascot, Lobstee the Lobster. Lobstee then steals the answer sheets away from him and runs off with them. Mr. Collingwood then gets on the phone for help from the Safety Patrol.

His other notable role is in The Shreds Fell Like Snowflakes, in which he's seen directing a school play.
