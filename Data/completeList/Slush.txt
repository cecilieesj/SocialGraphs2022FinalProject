==Role in the film==
After [[Periwinkle]] meets her twin sister [[Tinker Bell]], the frost fairy wishes to visit the warm regions of [[Pixie Hollow]], which is forbidden. However, Tink's friends create a snowmaking machine that is powered by ice. Slush is able to provide a large block of ice from one of the glaciers in the Winter Woods. Later on, when the balance of the seasons is thrown off, the Pixie Dust Tree is in danger of being frozen. Slush and his friends notice this when their Pixie Dust Fountain dries up, and the frost fairies go out to preserve the tree with frost. Slush stays behind and meditates at the fountain until the pixie dust is restored. At the end, when the border law is abolished, warm fairies are able to cross as long as their wings are frosted. Slush is last seen helping Tink's friend [[Clank]], overcome his fear of glaciers.
