The '''Hammer and Pencil Birds''' are minor characters in ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''.

==Role in the Film==
The birds first appear in the [[Tulgey Wood]], making signs for Alice that read "Don't step on the [[Mome Raths]]". They are later seen crying for Alice when she sings "[[Very Good Advice]]". They are not seen again after that.

==Trivia==
*A pencil bird appeared in ''[[Donald in Mathmagic Land]]'', but it looks almost completely different. It was slightly taller than [[Donald Duck|Donald]]; it has a longer, less detailed pencil with a pink lead for ahead, a clear set square triangle for its entire body without a tail or wings (therefore making it flightless); and longer, thinner legs and toes without back toes. It challenged Donald to a game of Tic-tac-toe and won. It could be argued that this pencil bird was related to the genus found in Wonderland but was of a different species, like how birds in real life are related yet could look totally different to one another
**Pencil birds resembling this one appear as enemies in [[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]].
*Hammer birds appear among the enemies of [[The Ocean]] level in the Japanese version of ''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]''. They are replaced by regular birds in the US version.
*The pencil birds made an appearance in the [[House of Mouse]] episode "[[Chip 'n' Dale (House of Mouse)|Chip 'n' Dale]]" when they help [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] draw a line to prevent [[Donald Duck|Donald]] from crossing until the end of the show.
