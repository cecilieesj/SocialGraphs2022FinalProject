==Role in the film==
At the orphanage, Sophie goes downstairs and locks the front doors, believing the bogeyman would come out as she thinks it is the witching hour. She later receives a letter from the front door just as she goes upstairs and puts them in place to which she hears a couple men arguing in the streets to which she tells them that there are children trying to sleep as she plans to call the police for disturbing the orphanage just before going to her bed. Sophie then continues reading her book at night using a flashlight just before following a cat out of the window to which she sees the BFG in the streets of London just as Sophie hides into the bed, she ends up getting grabbed by the BFG just before the giant strolls around the streets and the London countryside to which he continues taking her to a faraway land known as Giant Country to which as Sophie ends up in the BFG's lair, the BFG confuses her for an ingredient as it is explained that Sophie found herself inside Giant Country, explaining to him that she and the BFG traveled a long way to which [[The Big Friendly Giant|the BFG]] sees a couple of man-eating giants walking from a distance.

The BFG explains to her that he knows about the giants [[Fleshlumpeater]], Bonecruncher, Manhugger, Childchewer, Meatdripper, Gizzardgulper, Maidmasher, Bloodbottler, and Butcher Boy, the dangerous giants the BFG has ever knew. The BFG denies that he is extremely friendly and when talking to her about her parents, Sophie explains that she doesn't have any, explaining to him that both of them died when Sophie was a baby. Sophie explains to him that he took her from the orphanage as she explains to her about her dislike to the orphanage. She describes the orphanage's matron being incompetent and having unfair rules with children being punished a lot. The BFG explains to her about how the matron punishes them to which Sophie explains that she locks disobedient children in a dark cellar with rats inside. Sophie tells the BFG to know if the other giants are nice, to which he explains that these giants he saw are ravenous man-eating monsters unlike him. Sophie asks him to know why he brought her to Giant Country, to which he explains that the reason why he took her to this location is because of Sophie's desire to see a giant like him. As the BFG keeps talking to her about Fleshlumpeater, Sophie explains to her that she won't tell as she explains to him that she is untrustworthy, believing no one would believe in her info just as she argues with him, to which the BFG explains to her that she would tell the whole world about the existence of giants, explaining to her that she wants to go home to which he denies, telling Sophie to stay in Giant Country for the rest of their lives. The BFG then warns Sophie that she must never go to Fleshlumpeater's lair without him or she would make it to her final journey into his prey.

While discussing, Sophie corrects the words the BFG mispronounces to which the BFG explains that he couldn't help with the mispronunciations to which Sophie apologizes to him for being rude to him. Later, she observes the BFG reading a book he obtained from his valise just before the BFG goes to his collection of jars. Upon hearing the experiment the BFG studies, Sophie becomes shocked all of a sudden, but notices the BFG sleeping below her on the ship. However, Sophie's fate actually is a nightmare.

The next day, Sophie talks with the BFG who explains to her that the fizz he is using is Frobscottle, the drink the giants enjoy. Seeing the fizz inside, it is known that the drink gives the BFG to launch him in the air to which the two hear the Fleshlumpeater outside. Sophie hides inside a Snozzcumber to which the Fleshlumpeater attempts to eat, only to be stopped by the BFG telling him that he hates other vegetables besides beans. Just as the Fleshlumpeater leaves, Sophie leaves her hiding place and stares at the BFG who takes him to his home just as the he gives Sophie a bath to clean herself from the Snozzcumber juice. After giving Sophie a bath, the BFG gives her something to wear to which after Sophie dresses up, she explains to him to know what he would do for work to which Sophie decides to keep it a secret. She then explains to him that she has been stuck in Giant Country, hoping to return back to the real world. The BFG then gives Sophie a nice safe place to keep her safe from the Fleshlumpeater just before the BFG returns to work.

Sophie then curiously explores the BFG's workshop by herself and asks him that he can't keep secrets from her to which she explains to him that she sneaks around at night, sometimes steals, and also lies. She explains to him that she never had a giant friend like him as Sophie explains to him that she is very lonely with no friend. She then warns the BFG about the Fleshlumpeater who is looking after her to which after discussing with him about the giant she talked about, the BFG and Sophie walk outside and plan to get to the top of the mountain without disturbing the Fleshlumpeater's henchmen only for the BFG to be grabbed by the Bloodbottler just as Sophie escapes into a cab to which the Gizzardgulper carries the vehicle still with Sophie inside as the two giants speed toward each other to which BFG manages to escape from them with Sophie on his hand.

Having escaped the giants when a rainstorm arrives at Giant Country, the BFG then takes Sophie to Dream Country to look at the stars above them as he explains to her about the whispering things he hears just as he and Sophie approach a large body of water upon seeing a large tree from a distance. While observing, the BFG explains to Sophie that someone called him the Big Friendly Giant to which Sophie introduces herself to the BFG just as the two stare at the tree in awe upon seeing glowing lights on the tree. He then notices an orange glow of light to which he calls it a Phizzwizard as he attempts to catch it with his net to which he manages to catch it with his hands instead as it goes near Sophie, giving the Golden Phizzwizard to her as he puts it in the jar. The Phizzwizard then draws a picture of Sophie to which Sophie looks at it upon seeing more glowing Dreams pass by. Sophie then chases after a magenta Dream to while the BFG labels a jar "Sophie's Dream" just as Sophie continues chasing after the Dreams inside, to which the BFG sees Sophie catching a red one known as a Trogglehumper.

Sophie gives the Trogglehumper to the BFG just as he explains to Sophie that there are also Bad Dreams too in this area, to which he plans to lock up the one Sophie caught. The BFG explains to Sophie that this Dream tells of what Sophie has done to it as she continues to look for the BFG. She then finds him suddenly as she explains to him that she will call him BFG for short. Back at the real world, the BFG then shows a boy sleeping in bed just as Sophie feels inspired to make everyone happy. Sophie then asks the BFG to know if his father or mother tells him about Dreams to which he denies, explaining that he has no mother or father. It is then known that the BFF has heard her heart at the orphanage just as he uses his instrument he made, summoning a couple of Good Dreams to a boy and two parents in the real world. It is then known that the boy is dreaming of him and his father using a telephone, according to the BFG who tells it to Sophie.

Having given the boy a good dream, the BFG returns Sophie to Giant Country just as she gives plans to the BFG to take care of the Fleshlumpeater. Sophie then finds herself outside the orphanage where the BFG explains to her that there was a boy taught him how to be a friend. Sophie then thinks of a plan of stopping the Fleshlumpeater and his henchmen so that Giant Country would be safe without them. Sophie then returns to her bed at the orphanage at the same spot where the BFG would arrive at. At the balcony, Sophie longs for the BFG to come as she is determined to jump to meet her giant friend just as the BFG takes her back to Giant Country. At the BFG's workshop, the Fleshlumpeater arrives as the BFG tells Sophie to hide. Sophie begins to escape from Fleshlumpeater and his fellow henchmen to which she arrives at a table next to the BFG just before she escapes from the giants and ends up at a knothole where she sees a small bed next to her and later sees a drawing of a boy and the BFG which reads "The Big Friendly Giant and Me" just as she sees more drawings of the boy in the room as it is revealed that this room once belonged to a little boy and his giant friend.

Having taken care of the Fleshlumpeater, Sophie then sees a dusty image of Queen Victoria inside to which she devises a plan to see Queen Victoria just as Sophie describes a special dream the BFG would give to the Queen to believe that giants are real. Later, arriving at Buckingham Palace, the BFG then takes Sophie to the Palace to see the Queen while avoiding a group of guards patrolling to which he opens a window for her to enter, giving the Queen a dream of Fleshlumpeater being real to which she approaches the Queen in her room in a plan to see the BFG just as she calls the BFG to meet her only to find him not present. However, the BFG shows up as Sophie asks the Queen she wouldn't harm the giant to which due to Sophie's request, she asks Mr. Tibbs to tell the guards to not attack him to which he tells the guards to follow what the Queen says just as the BFG meets Sophie inside the Queen's room. The BFG emotionally approaches the Queen explaining to her that he came to see her friend Sophie to give her assistance.

Later, the Queen's maid Mary brushes Sophie's hair to get ready for the invitation just as a footman makes way for Sophie who enters the hallway. Sophie, wearing a navy-blue dress, walks in the hallway and meets the BFG inside to which she, the BFG, and the Queen are served breakfast inside the dining room just as she watches him try the food he never tasted before just as she is tasked to eat breakfast just like her giant friend is eating to which she eats the strawberries and whipped cream served to her during breakfast time. As the footmen serve him tea, she instructs her friend to drink tea in a proper way to which he feels dissatisfied of the tea and prefers Frobscottle over it. She then sees a group of generals marching to the Palace where the BFG devises a plan to fight against Fleshlumpeater and save England from the giants just as Sophie shows support to her friend along with the generals to which Sophie joins him.

Back at Giant Country, Sophie is discussing with the BFG at his workshop of why he is using the Trogglehumper against the Fleshlumpeater and his henchmen, the BFG explains that it would help give giants a disadvantage in a plan to defeat the vicious giant leader to which the BFG uses the Trogglehumper in his infuser as part of his plan to defeat Fleshlumpeater.

At the spot where the Fleshlumpeater and his fellow giants are at, the BFG then tells a story of Sophie's journey to a happy end, explaining that this story would be part of her heart's desire as he hopes of Sophie's dream to come true. The BFG explains to Sophie that she has more dreams to catch, but not in Giant Country just as she shows empathy to the BFG. She then carries the jar with the Trogglehumper inside as she uses it against the Fleshlumpeater and his minions just as Sophie opens it as the Trogglehumper sprite gets absorbed by Fleshlumpeater and his fellow minions to which as she confronts him for being a bad giant. The Fleshlumpeater prepares to attack, but the BFG counters it just as Sophie escapes from the leader of the evil giants.

Sophie then notices the Fleshlumpeater tied up by military forces followed by her escaping from the giants captured by the military. She then notices the Fleshlumpeater getting close to him just as the BFG saves her in time just as the two watch the helicopters lifting all the villainous giants. The Fleshlumpeater and the rest of the giants are later dispatched and banished to a faraway island never to disturb the BFG once again just as Sophie narrates the other giants' fate.

Back at the real world the next day, Sophie wakes up happily just as she thinks of a happy dream she had last night just as she looks through the window as she thinks to herself of the BFG having a happier life to which she explains to herself that the BFG is the secret whisperings of the world.
