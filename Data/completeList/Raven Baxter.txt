{{Quote|Oh snap!|Raven's catchphrase}}

'''Raven Lydia Baxter''' (portrayed by [[Raven-Symoné]]) is the main protagonist of Disney Channel's ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and a main character of the sequel/spin-off ''[[Raven's Home]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Raven is strong, confident and loud. She loves to have fun, but struggles with the burden of keeping her psychic abilities secret while simultaneously trying to fit in with everybody else. She can be bossy and brutally honest when it comes to fashion, but has a heart of gold and has been shown to use her knowledge of future disasters to save the day.

Unfortunately, Raven's visions also have the uncanny ability to get both her and her family into bad situations. When this occurs, Raven often uses her acting skills and her talent for designing costumes to disguise herself as someone else, even though it is somewhat obvious to tell it's really her. This has led to a number of positive and negative influences in her life; it got her a job for a weekly horoscope; it also got her fired; she pretended to be a bald male in his late fifties in order to undermine a racist shopping system; she has also posed as a Russian gymnast, a bride to her boyfriend's father, an Arabian belly dancer, an overweight middle-aged woman, a stylish celebrity, a secret agent plumber, a dancing pirate working at a pizza parlor, to name a few. She was once transformed into a cow.

===Physical appearance===
Raven is a fun, fresh and fashion-savvy teenager with a love for outfits. She is African-American, has almond-shaped eyes and a winning smile. She likes to change her hairstyle throughout the series, but it is most often black or dark brown and worn in various bunches, ponytails and braids depending on her mood. In the first season, her signature hairstyle was a ponytail. Throughout the second season, her hair is dyed a light brown color. It returns to its dark brown/black color by the third season.
 
===Powers and Abilities===
*'''Clairvoyance:'''<ref>In "[[Saving Psychic Raven]]", [[Dr. Sleevemore]] described Raven's future-seeing powers as making her clairvoyant.</ref> Raven gets "psychic visions" about what may or may not happen later. She is only able to "see" a small segment of some future event, and she frequently makes errors on what it really means, in which case her attempts to change these events only end up making it happen or making it worse. During her "premonitions," Raven tends to stare blankly into space in a trance-like state for the duration of the vision. In "[[Double Vision]]", Raven and fellow psychic Ben could amplify their powers by making tactical contact (e.g. by hugging or kissing).
**'''Enhanced Intuition:''' Raven sometimes get a "vibe" that grants her some sort of intuitive sense, as seen in "[[Saving Psychic Raven]]" when Raven went along with this vibe and saw her friends (i.e. [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]] and [[Eddie Thomas|Eddie]]) confronting her. Likewise, Raven can apparently check to see if she's getting any "psychic vibes" so as to trigger a vision, as demonstrated in "[[A Fight at the Opera]]." 

====Temporary Powers====
*'''Telepathy:''' After catching a "psychic-cold," Raven had watery eyes, a runny nose, and temporarily gained the ability to read minds. According to her [[Tanya Baxter|mother]] in "[[Leave it to Diva]]", Raven's [[Vivian|maternal grandmother]] used to get psychic-colds all the time, and that it only lasts a few days before the effects wore off.

===Weaknesses===
*'''Mushroom Allergy:''' Raven Baxter is extremely allergic to mushrooms, and in "[[Vision Impossible]]" when she used a mushroom shampoo, her visions were temporarily "jacked-up."

===Age===
*Season 1: 14-15
*Season 2: 15-16
*Season 3: 16-17
*Season 4: 17-18
*''Raven's Home'': Early 30s

===School Year===
*Season 1: Freshman Year/9th Grade
*Season 2: Sophomore Year/10th Grade
*Season 3: Junior Year/11th Grade
*Season 4: Senior Year/12th Grade

===Careers===
Raven has had many jobs, such as a waitress and dog-groomer. But in Season 4, Raven lands an internship with (fictional) world-famous fashion designer [[Donna Cabonna]] (Anne-Marie Johnson).

Raven formerly worked for her former boss [[Paisley]] as a fashion designer for dogs. In "[[Vest in Show]]", Raven quit working for Paisley and they parted ways.

===Sayings===
Raven's catchphrases are "I'm okay!" (usually after a bad fall), "Ya nasty!" (usually to someone she dislikes, or to someone who does something inappropriate), "Oh Snap!", "My Bad!", "Gotta go!", "How y'all doin'?", and "Gently!" In addition, she tends to scream hysterically when she's excited or panicked. In Raven's Home, she's adopted "You gon' get it!"

==''[[Raven's Home]]''==
Before the series begins, Raven moves to [[Chicago]] and marries Devon, having twins with him. At an unknown point in time, the pair divorce with Raven taking custody of the children. She gets a job working for Paisley as a fashion designer for dogs. She later allows [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]] and her son [[Levi Grayson|Levi]] to move in with her. During this time, she refuses to disclose to her family that she is psychic, with Chelsea being the only one to know, although later, Raven changed her mind after hearing that Booker inherited her psychic abilities as she told her kids along with Levi and Tess about her own psychic ability.

In Season Five of the series, she and [[Booker Baxter-Carter|Booker]] relocate to her old hometown of San Francisco, where they will care for her father, [[Victor Baxter]], who has a “mild heart attack” and raising her young cousin, Alice.<ref>https://deadline.com/2021/10/ravens-home-renewed-season-5-disney-channel-rondell-sheridan-reprise-original-role-casting-changes-1234847720/</ref>

==Premonitions==
In an episode from the first season, Raven discovers that her maternal grandmother, Vivian ("Viv" for short), is also psychic, and it's revealed that the psychic powers are a hereditary thing on Raven's mom's side of the family--the powers apparently skip a generation now and then because Tanya (despite knowing about the psychic powers) never had psychic abilities like her mother or daughter. Also, the psychic powers don't appear to be exclusive to just the women in Raven's family, because her son, Booker, eventually develops psychic abilities of his own.

==Trivia==
*[[Raven-Symoné]] played a parody of Raven Baxter called [[Amber Algoode]], in the ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' episode "[[That's So Sonny]]".
*The character [[Tawni Hart]] makes a reference to Raven, when Sonny has a vision, in the ''Sonny With a Chance'' episode "Gummy with a Chance".
*It was revealed in "[[Run, Raven, Run]]" that Raven and Alana used to be friends, until the 4th grade where they became enemies because the teacher picked Raven to be the Tooth Fairy, and Alana got stuck being tooth decay.
*Raven and her brother, [[Cory Baxter|Cory]], are the only characters to appear in every single episode of the original series.
**She and Booker are the only characters to appear in every single episode of the spinoff.
*Raven's ex-husband in ''[[Raven's Home]]'' was originally going to be a man named David, but then it was changed to be Raven's old boyfriend, [[Devon Carter]].
**Despite being divorced, Raven and Devon seemed to have parted on good enough terms to have an amicable relationship.
*As seen in ''Raven's Home'', Raven wears wigs.
*The only people who know about Raven's psychic abilities are her family and close friends, although there were a few other people she told, as she trusts them to keep her secret.
*Raven is the second Disney Channel protagonist to be at least 20, the first being [[Jessie Prescott]].
*She's shown to be an excellent dancer.
*Raven has proven to be an iconic character and would even serve as the inspiration for future characters that try to balance their normal lives and maintain a secret that could bring negative consequences if revealed or exposed. Examples would be Miley Stewart, who's secret identity is Hannah Montana and even Alex Russo since she's a wizard in training.
*She has stated that her favorite color is purple. This was stated in the episode Vest in Show.
*She and Ally Dawson are one of the few characters who became moms in the future.
*She is the first Disney main character to have ever attended college.
