[[File:Shark_people.jpg|thumb|207px]]'''Shark People'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/critters/sharkpeople.htm</ref> are fictional creatures featured in the television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.
==History==
They are magical creatures which make their home in the oceans, but are roughly bipedal and able to breathe air for a period, as well as walk on solid ground. They are a cross between a shark and a human.                 

[[Tiburón]] was the leader of the Shark People to rule the seas by using Neptune's Trident while riding on a Sea Serpent. Tiburón's army of Shark People looked like makos, great whites, hammerheads, sand tigers, Megalodons, and other shark species. After the [[Sea Serpent]] found his weakness, which was steam, Tiburón fell into the ocean with his Sea Serpent, but they might have survived.

A Shark Woman was seen when she was dating [[Jake Long|Jake]]'s [[Luong Lao Shi|gramps]] and she bites the sofa with a huge chomp and still smiles while chewing<ref name="fishy">[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]</ref>. In a blooper, the Shark Woman, who was wearing a pink dress, spits out a piece of metal (the "OUTATIME" DeLorean license plate from ''Back to the Future''), a chair, Neptune's Trident, a chainsaw, and last, but only two more, [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]] and [[Arthur "Spud" P. Spudinski|Spud]]<ref name="fishy">[[Something Fishy This Way Comes]]</ref>! The Shark Woman also made a short appearance while playing go fish with [[Fu Dog|Fu]] and a few other magical creatures<ref>[[Nobody's Fu]]</ref>.
