As her name implies, she serves a priestess who lives in the mystical Valley of the Thirteen Heavens in the Temple of the Sun in [[Mexico]]. According to her, the Priestess herself is associated with the God of Life who would help protect her community of chickens with a messenger sent by the God of Life to help protect the community from a messenger sent by the God of Death. She then holds a tournament where the Messenger of Life must face the Messenger of Death to know who gains championship in a three-round match where the contender wins the match will survive while the other opponent who loses will fall and the surviving fighter is declared the winner of the match.

The Valley of the Thirteen Heavens Priestess is a large anthropomorphic red chicken wearing Aztec attire consisting of a white tunic patterend in green and yellow as well. She also wears a necklace made of three triangles as well as two triangle-shaped earrings and a typical Aztec headdress.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Mexico à Go-Go]]", the Priestess is first seen approaching [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], [[José Carioca]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Xandra]] believing that Panchito is a messenger from the God of Life has come. As Xandra asks the priestess to know why Panchito is chosen as the messenger, she explains to her that his arrival was foretold. The chickens then celebrate Panchito's arrival as the Priestess welcomes Panchito to the Valley of the Thirteen Heavens where Panchito is dubbed as their protector, telling the mariachi band to play the music to welcome Panchito's arrival, much to Xandra's worry.

During the ceremony, the Priestess honors Panchito with the ceremonial dance of the lights where a trio of fire twirlers perform in front of her for Panchito. Upon approaching Panchito, she believes that this ceremony is a bit of a distraction as Felldrake still has to be found to which the Priestess offers Panchito to dance as part of the ceremony. Later, the Priestess then tells the crowd that is is time for the ceremony where it is explained that the messenger of life has to deal with the messenger of death who is [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] assisted by [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Lord Felldrake]] and [[Leopold the Horrible]].

Later at the Arena of Champions, the Priestess (wearing a referee outfit) appears in the ring where a large crowd chickens are gathered together at the arena to see the messenger of life fighting against the messenger of death where a lucha libre match is taking place at the Arena of Champions where Panchito must fight against Baron Von Sheldgoose where Panchito (under his alter ego, "El Gallo Loco") is presented in front of the crowd where he is to fight his opponent Baron Von Sheldgoose (nicknamed "Ganso Gordo"). The Priestess gives the competitors the simple rules: no holds barred, three rounds, and "having fun" just as Panchito and Sheldgoose are readying themselves for the match. Later after a tough match and it is figured out that the wrestling match is being used as a fight to the death, Panchito decides to make the third round a draw instead of gaining victory to which Panchito's allies fight together along with Sheldgoose and his allies. Later when the God of Death arrives at the Arena of Champions, the Priestess and the large crowd flee the arena upon seeing the skeleton deity inside. It is unknown of what happened to her after that.
