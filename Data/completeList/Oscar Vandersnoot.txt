'''Oscar Vandersnoot''' is a one-time character from the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode "[[Captains Outrageous]]". He is a 6-year-old accident prone son of multi-millionaire Mrs. Vandersnoot. He is adventurous, though his mother often keeps him on a short leash. He's heartbroken, because the Jungle Ace club thinks he's also a walking disaster.

==Trivia==
*Oscar is the only Jungle-Ace member known to have any parents, of course [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]] does not, but it is a mystery who the other boys' parents are or if they're actually orphans like Kit.
