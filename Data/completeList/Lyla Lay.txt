|quote = }}'''Lyla Lay''' is a recurring character from the [[PKNA]] comic series. She was also featured in Pikappa and [[PKNE]].

==Background==
Lyla is a journalist of Channel 00, but that job is just a front. Actually, Lyla is an agent of the Time Police, an organization from the future with agents in several key periods to avert history from being manipulated by time travelers.

==History==
Origins of Lyla differ with each new retelling of the Duck Avenger story.

In '''PKNA''', Lyla first met [[The Duck Avenger]] during a soap opera party where she and [[Angus Fangus]] were invited as reporters. The Duck Avenger saved all the guests from an attack by the [[Evronians]].

The Duck Avenger found out the truth about Lyla, including the fact that she knew he was Donald, when Lyla helped him fight against [[the Raider]]. After stopping the Raider, Lyla also revealed to the Duck Avenger that she really is an android.

In '''Pikappa''', Lyla is the web-reporter of 00-channel.com, and met Duck Avenger during the Toyland incident, where she immediately saves him from being squished by a mechanical T-Rex, inadvertently breaking her own arm. Donald, puzzled by revelation that his favorite web-journalist is actually an android, takes her for repairs to his HQ.

While in transfer, Lyla told her story: Lyonard D'Aq, while investigating his own factory, found her disabled in a pile of rubble, and repaired her as far as his abilities could do, educated her and released her; though her mnemonic files largely remained damaged. Later Lyla found work as a web-reporter.
