==History==
[[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]] and his friends find Jack in the snow outside [[The Big Blue House|Big Blue House]] as they're preparing for their Christmas celebration, and they take him in for the holidays. They soon make friends with the kindly old dog and they worry about where he'll live. At the end of the special, [[Doc Hogg]]Â offers to take Jack in as his dog.

Jack speaks using something of a Southern patois. He generally likes to do things for himself and somewhat resists Bear and the others' attempts to help him. Jack may have lived with a boy named Billy at one point, as he can be heard muttering in his sleep, "Okay, Billy, I'll fetch the ball if you'll just throw here."

Jack returned in the following season, becoming the fire chief at the [[Woodland Valley]] Fire Department. He appeared in the episode, "[[Welcome to Woodland Valley]]".
