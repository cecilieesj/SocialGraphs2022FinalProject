'''Bungo''' is aÂ rabbit from the [[Playhouse Disney]] (now [[Disney Junior]]) show ''[[Jungle Junction]]''. He's one of the older residents of Jungle Junction.

==Personality==
Bungo loves to make signs and put them all over the jungle. He is very good at geography, and knows the jungle better than anyone. He is also the only wheeler that is good at jumping, as he can leap many times his own height into the air. He lives underground in the Jungle Junction town. The last one of his kind, Bungo is a very rare creature whose job is to keep the jungle tidy and running smoothly by the copious production of signs! Go left, go right, stop, go, no entry etc...he's at it all the time. Bungo does everything by the book and is a bit of a boffin who is rather prone to complaining that his work is not appreciated. He claims that without him the jungle and its roads would overgrow and movement about the place would be impossible. He's probably right, but nobody tells him that because it would go straight to his head.

==Appearance==
Bungo is a yellow rabbit with four car wheels, headlights and a striped raccoon-like tail. He loosely resembles a Sumatran striped rabbit and speaks with a UK accent.
