'''Ullu''' is a character from Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.

==Background==
Ullu is a female Indian scops owl. She spends most of her time in the mountain pass by the entrance to the Tree of Life. Mostly, she warns the Night Pride whenever there is a potential danger approaching the Tree of Life. In spite of her duty in giving out alerts to the Night Pride, she even is capable of tricking her foes by turning her head all the way around, the ability that owls can only do as revealed in "[[Triumph of the Roar]]", where Mama Binturong captures her and orders her porcupines to watch over her to which she tricks them by turning her head all the way around to foil the porcupines.

Ullu later arrives telling Nirmala that Makucha's army has arrived to attack once again to which Kion and the Night Pride fight off the villains to which Baliyo is injured during battle; fortunately, Nirmala tells Kion that the venom from Ora will wear off.

Later when the predators ambush once again, Kion warns Ullu that Mama Binturong has been playing dirty tricks on the two teams the whole time. Fortunately, Bunga, along with Binga, manages to defeat Mama Binturong using their stench abilities just as the Lion Guard defeats the villains.

===''[[Long Live the Queen]]''===
Ullu tells Rani that Queen Janna wants to see the whole Night Pride and Kion. Kion tells Rani to go ahead while taking care of a tiger family to which Ullu explains that Kion should go to Queen Janna more because she asked the Night Pride and Kion to see her just as the rest of the Guard escorts a tiger family to safety.

Meanwhile at the Tree of Life, Ullu takes Kion and the Night Pride there to see a crowd of animals outside the Tree to which Nirmala explains that Janna's time has come to which the Night Pride and Kion enter to see Janna one last time before she passes away; Janna later completes her Circle of Life as the Night Pride, Kion, and Makini are saddened upon her completion.

As Makucha's army enters the mountain pass, Ullu explains to the Night Pride that she dozed off when she heard the army arriving. Later, she notices Makucha's army (this time with new reinforcements) arriving to the Tree of Life just as Mama Binturong tells [[Smun]] and his porcupines to watch over the owl. She then freaks out [[Smun]] and his prickle with one of her owl-only abilities by turning her head all the way around; Smun decides not to tell the porcupines about their encounter with Ullu.

Elsewhere, she warns the Night Pride that Mama Binturong has led an army of villains to eat the rare animals just as the Night Pride decides to stop the villains from attacking. She later tells the Lion Guard about the Night Pride on their way to fight against Makucha's army.

As Ullu and the Guard notice Makucha's army attacking the rare animals, she and the Lion Guard work together to fight off Makucha's army just as Kion, with the mastered roar, uses it to create a tornado to take all the members of Makucha's army far a away from the Tree to ever be seen again in order to defend the Tree from predators.
