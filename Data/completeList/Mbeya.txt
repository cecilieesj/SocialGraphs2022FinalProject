Some spots (both lighter and darker) can also be found on his back. He has dark ear-tips with a pink inner ear and a pair of white horns, the front significantly larger than the other.

== Personality ==
Mbeya is very loquacious, friendly, polite, talkative, magniloquent, communicative, unreserved, and chatty. He is also claimed to know the Pride Landers like the back of his horn. However, he can also be very stubborn, and quick in leaping to conclusions. But he is not above admitting when he's wrong, and issuing apologies when needed.

== Role in the series ==

After Beshte helps him get out, Mbeya explains how he was rolling around to get rid of the flies, but accidentally rolled into the stream bed by mistake. The Lion Guard offer to escort him to a watering hole, but notice Thurston's Herd waiting nearby. When the flies disappear, Ono comes to the conclusion that it's the zebras stripes that they don't like. The Lion Guard escort both the herd and Mbeya to a new watering hole, their journey uninterrupted by the flies.
