'''Professor Pema Dorje, PhD''' is a character from ''[[Expedition Everest]]''.

== History ==
Pema Dorje was born in the latter half of the 20th century to a sherpa family in the asian village of Serka Zong, [[Anandapur]].  Dorje's family had come to the country during the 1950s.  Pema himself attended universities in India and Nepal where he studied ecology.  Pema received his doctorate from the ''Royal Anandapur University'' with a masters in anthropology and PhD in Conservational Science.

As a professor, Pema became a member of the group ''Conservation International'' where he was close with leader Russell A. Mittermeier.  Following the belief that cultural beliefs such as mythological creatures were tied to practice ecological wellbeing, Pema returned to Serka Zong to study the [[Yeti]] of the Forbidden Mountain overlooking the village.  In Serka Zong, Dorje opened up the, "Yeti Museum" which studied the history, science, and mythology surrounding the yeti.

In [[2005]], Pema was challenged by the company ''Himalayan Escapes Tours and Expeditions'' which lead steam-train tours through the yeti's domain in the Forbidden Mountain.  This operation angered the yeti and caused damage to those who passed through the mountain.  Pema used his museum and lectures to attempt to cease this tourist operation only to be shut down by ''Himalayan Escapes''<nowiki/>' leaders Norbu and Bob.
