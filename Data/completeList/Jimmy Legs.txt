'''Jimmy Legs''' is a character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Jimmy Legs serves as the ship's bosun. He uses a whip (or cat o' nine tails) who punishes crewmen on his harsh orders in a harsh temper.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Jimmy Legs has characteristics of sea creatures - his face in the form of a stonefish with a piranha-like mouth with a fin on his back.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Jimmy Legs and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Jimmy Legs and the other crew went on it and held his motley crew as prisoners where he held [[Pintel and Ragetti|Ragetti]] hostage.

On the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', Will Turner and his father, [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] confront Jimmy Legs after dropping a cannon on the spot where the two were supposed to be hoisting. Preparing to strike Will Turner with his whip, his father intervenes and stops this, trying to escape from Jimmy Legs' punishment.

The next day, Jimmy Legs used his whip on the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raising the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Jimmy Legs and the rest of the crew plans to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Just as Jimmy Legs and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Jimmy Legs and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. Successfully opening the chest containing the Heart of Davy Jones, Jimmy Legs and the crew fight against Jack's crew just as Jack and his crew plan to escape from the crew and return to the ''Black Pearl''. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Jimmy Legs and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Jimmy Legs returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Jimmy Legs and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Jimmy Legs and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Jimmy Legs and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men while Jack Sparrow fights against Davy Jones. In the battle, Jimmy Legs fought against Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, but the two manage to fight him back and when the two marry each other, the two strike him with a sword.

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Jimmy Legs and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==Trivia==
*In an early screenplay of ''Dead Man's Chest'', the bosun of the ''Dutchman'' was Greenbeard, not Jimmy Legs. It is also said that Jimmy Legs was described with his body covered in barnacles, but for the final version, he was covered in coral instead.
*His name is a reference to the term "Jimmy Legs" which is naval slang for the chief petty officer aboard a man-o-war.
