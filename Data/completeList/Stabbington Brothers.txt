A pair of brutish thieves, they once served as [[Flynn Rider]]‘s partners-in-crime, before facing betrayal at Rider’s hands. The brothers then formed an alliance with [[Mother Gothel]] to exact vengeance on Rider, and to use [[Rapunzel]]’s magic to become wealthy beyond all reason.

==Background==
The Stabbington Brothers are twins with muscular bodies, fair skin, red hair, light blue eyes, big eyebrows, big noses, and big jaws. Their haircuts are almost similar (their fringes are combed in different directions). They have dark rings underneath their eyes, and scars underneath their mouths.

Sideburns have a slightly curved scar on the right side of his face. He wears a sleeveless green shirt, his weapon is a long sword on his back. Also, his ears are edgier. Sideburns does most of the talking for both of them.

Patchy, on the other hand, wears a dark, sleeveless shirt similar to his brother, but also wears a long-sleeved shirt underneath. He has round ears and an eye patch on his left eye, and a scar underneath it. Patchy also does not talk.

==Appearances==
===''[[Tangled]]''===
The Stabbington Brothers are first seen with [[Flynn Rider]] heading for [[Corona Castle]] to steal [[Rapunzel's Crown|a royal crown]] that belongs to the [[Rapunzel|missing princess]]. The brothers hoist Flynn down with a rope to retrieve it. The three obtain it successfully, but the guards rush for them, and a chase begins. When the thieves become blocked by a tall cliff, the brothers will only lift Flynn up first if they have the satchel that holds the crown. Although they had the satchel, Flynn abandons them by snatching the satchel from under their noses then sprints off, much to their anger. Stranded, the brothers are arrested but roam along with the guards as prisoners in chains. While at [[The Snuggly Duckling]] where Flynn and his new allies, Rapunzel and [[Pascal]], are located, the two escape and attempt to catch Flynn. However, they are overwhelmed by the collapsing river water built up by a dam, which is destroyed accidentally by [[Maximus]], who also attempted to apprehend Flynn.

[[File:Meetinggothel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Stabbington Brothers encounter Mother Gothel.]]
They survive the chaos, exiting the Pub's secret passage. The two stumble upon a woman, [[Mother Gothel]]. She strikes a deal with the two and reveals the secret of [[Rapunzel's Magic Hair|Rapunzel's hair]], which they find more valuable than the crown.

After Rapunzel and Flynn enjoy a romantic evening watching the [[lanterns]], Flynn spots the brothers and brings the satchel to them, hoping that they will leave Rapunzel and him in peace. The brothers, however, point out to Flynn that they are aware of Rapunzel's hair, and want her instead of the crown. The brothers render Flynn unconscious and tie him up to their boat, pushing it back into the sea to sail back towards the kingdom. Cleverly, through Mother Gothel's commands, the brothers make it seem as if Flynn was escaping with the crown. This tricks Rapunzel into believing he abandoned her, trading her and her magic hair for the crown.

The brothers confront Rapunzel and tell her just that, breaking the girl's heart. They prepare to kidnap her, planning to use her magic hair to make a fortune. However, Mother Gothel betrays them and knocks the duo out with a branch. She pretends to rescue Rapunzel and tricks her into returning to the [[Rapunzel's Tower|tower]] in the forest. Off-screen, the brothers are arrested and taken to the prisons along with Flynn. They are last seen in their prison cell as Flynn is being escorted to his execution. In fury, Flynn grabs one of them and demands to know what happened to Rapunzel and how they knew about her hair. They fearfully tell Flynn that an old lady told them, making him realize the malevolence of Rapunzel's "mother" and she is in danger. They aren't seen for the remainder of the film.

===''[[Tangled Ever After]]''===
The Stabbington Brothers make a small cameo in ''Tangled Ever After''. They are seen at the very end, weeping as Rapunzel and Eugene share their first kiss as a married couple. This scene in the short indicates heavy signs of reformation as the brothers were not only invited to the wedding by Rapunzel and Eugene, but also showed genuine happiness for the loving couple.

===''[[Tangled: The Series]]''===
[[File:Sideburns_and_Patchy_in_TTS.jpg|thumb|250px|The Stabbingtons in ''Tangled: The Series''.]]
The Stabbington Brothers (revealed to be named Sideburns and Patchy) appear in the episode "[[Cassandra v. Eugene]]". Taking place before the events of ''Tangled: Ever After'', the brothers manage to escape their cell and seek revenge against Flynn. They kidnap Rider and Rapunzel's lady-in-waiting [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] to use as "human shield" as they make their way out of the dungeons. They are confronted by the guards and during the confrontation, the brothers learn that Cassandra is the Captain's daughter. Sideburns threaten to kill Cassandra should the Captain refuse to stand down, allowing the brothers to escape with both Cassandra and Eugene still in their grasps. Once they're in the clear, Patchy prepares to kill the captives, though Sideburns decides to keep Cassandra alive to use as leverage. Nevertheless, the brothers are equally ready to exact vengeance on Flynn right then and there, until they are distracted long enough for Cassandra to knock them unconscious. By the time they awaken, the guards are on the scene, and Eugene and Cassandra have made it out safety. The brothers are then taken back into custody once more.

In "[[Max and Eugene in Peril on the High Seas]]", the Stabbingtons take part in a mutiny aboard a prison barge, led by [[Lady Caine]]. Along with other criminals that have dealt with Eugene and Rapunzel, the brothers plot to take over a passing ferry to allow them safe entry to the mainland. Their plans are thwarted when Eugene and [[Maximus]] find themselves aboard the ship. In the end, the Stabbingtons are once again taken prisoner.

In "[[Return of the King]]", the Stabbingtons are no longer taken seriously by the criminal community and plot to take revenge not just on Eugene, but also his visiting father [[King Edmund]]. They fail once again, but Eugene rescues them from a collapsing log flume, the same one he and Rapunzel crossed when they traveled to Corona for the first time. The Stabbingtons are confused as to why Eugene would rescue them despite all they did to him with Eugene telling them that he had changed his ways. Based on their reaction, it is implied that this event most likely lead to their reformation seen in ''Tangled Ever After''. 

In "[[No Time Like the Past]]", when a magical hourglass sends Rapunzel and Pascal back in time ten years, they inadvertently inhabit the teenage bodies of the Stabbingtons. After returning to their own time, the Stabbingtons maintain no memory of what happened to them.

==Trivia==
*Although both characters are credited, Patchy has no actual lines of dialogue in the film.
*In ''Disney Enchanted Tales'', it's revealed that Flynn was the one who approached the brothers to join him on the Crown theft-and that he had preconceived on how he'd get rid of them. However, whether this game is completely canon is still questionable.
*The Stabbington Brothers themselves do not appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' in their homeworld of "Kingdom of Corona", as they were written out entirely in the game's rendition of the film. Their roles were substituted by [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Marluxia|Marluxia]] (an antagonist from [[Organization XIII]] and the nobody of Lauriam). However, his intentions were entirely different to the brothers in the film, as he plans to use Rapunzel as part of the New Seven Hearts that [[Xehanort]] and the Real Organization XIII are after and also use Gothel as an extra "pawn" for the Organization so that she can keep Rapunzel locked in her [[Rapunzel's Tower|tower]].
