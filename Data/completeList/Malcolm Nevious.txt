==Biography==
Malcolm is a teenage gamer whose avatar in the online RPG ''Everlot'' was known as the Wraithmaster. Nevious claimed that the Wraithmaster was destined to rule over Everlot, but [[Jake (Kim Possible)|Jake]] disagreed, saying that the Wraithmaster was just out to run everyone's game. One day, when his avatar discovered that [[Zita Flores]] had escaped the tangled growth in the Magnosian Thorn Bog with the aid of [[Ron Stoppable]] (under the guidance of [[Wade]]), he prepared to strike Ron down. But Ron used the Aspen Power Wand of Newforest on the ground, causing the Wraithmaster to sink into the resulting crevice. As Zita and Ron passed him in school the next day, Malcolm vowed he would have his revenge. He revealed himself and held a number of players hostage, including Jake, and requested a dance with Zita and she turned down the offer in an online virtual game. [[Kim Possible (character)|KP]] used the key to free the other players and Malcolm was defeated.
