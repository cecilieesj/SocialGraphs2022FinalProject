== Personality ==
Juhudi is a rambunctious young giraffe who is full of energy. Whilst she pays her mother little attention, she does listen provided she is having fun at the same time, as seen by how well she listens to Bunga's lessons and advice. Juhudi is also brave, capable of defeating jackals when she needs to.

== History ==

=== [[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]] ===
Juhudi is briefly seen running with her herd during "A Beautiful Day (Ni Siku Nzuri).

=== [[The Imaginary Okapi |The Imaginary Okapi&nbsp;]] ===
She appears during the song "Life in the Pride Lands", along with her mother, and another member of Twiga's herd. Her mother lovingly nuzzles her, before leading her away.

=== [[Beshte and the Hippo Lanes]] ===
She is briefly seen at the end crossing the Hippo Lanes with her mother and the other Pride Landers.

=== [[Babysitter Bunga]] ===
Juhudi is playing at the Watering Hole with her mother Twiga as her mother tries to relax. The young giraffe keeps getting into trouble as Twiga tries to warn her but to no avail. Seeing that Hamu is with Bunga, Twiga decides to see if Bunga will consider taking Juhudi as well, right after the youngster chases a porcupine across the plains.

Twiga and some other parents approach Bunga and ask if he would consider taking their children for a while too. Bunga is happy to oblige, and Juhudi and the other kids then got dropped off at Hakuna Matata Falls so the honey badger can watch them. During that time Bunga teaches them how to Teke Ruka Teleza or kick jump slide, as a way of having fun during their stay.

But while the young ones play, Reirei's Pack arrive to spoil the party. When they become surrounded, Bunga yells "Teke" to them, and Juhudi and the other youngsters kick the jackals away. Bunga then tells them to scatter, and they do so. Juhudi and Young Serval come across a bush filled with pollen and Bunga tell them to kick (teke). Once more they obey, and the pollen scatters around them and blinds Kijana and one of her brothers. She calls for the two blinded jackals to get closer before she and the serval part to drop them in the water.

Thanks to Bunga's techniques, she and the other kids defeat the jackals, right before Kion and the rest of the Guard show up to discover that everyone is fine. Then, her mother arrives to pick her up, asking Juhudi how her day was and she replies that it was great. But before Juhudi returns home, she and kids cuddle around Bunga, who they agree is the best babysitter ever.

A bit later, Juhudi watches [[Tamaa]]  impersonate [[Thurston]] and her mother as part of his show.

=== [[The Fall of Mizimu Grove]] ===
Juhudi is with her herd watching [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] ing their song "[[Tujiinue]]." Until the  Army of Scar arrives and there's a battle between the Pride Landers and the Outlanders. Soon Scar reveals himself in front of the Pride Landers and says his plan.  The herds start to panic and run and the Lion Guard goes after them. After being calmed down they all start to think about leaving the Pride Lands.
