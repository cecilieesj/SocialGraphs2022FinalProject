'''Tambry''' is a character in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''. She is one of [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]]'s friends, who first appears in the episode "[[The Inconveniencing]]". She rarely looks up from her phone, either texting or updating her status.    

==Background==
===Personality===
Tambry is in many ways a very stereotypical teenager. She enjoys texting and using social networking sites even more than other teens, and rarely looks up from her cell phone.          

===Physical appearance===
Tambry has light brown skin and short purple hair with a pink highlight in the front. She usually wears a purple and white shirt with a purple skirt, light purple leggings, and black boots, along with two black earrings. She also carries around a black flip cell phone that takes up most of her time. She carries a black handbag in "[[The Inconveniencing]]".
==Role in the series==
Tambry is seen as one of Wendy's friends throughout "[[The Inconveniencing]]". She goes with them to the abandoned Dusk 2 Dawn convenience store, but hardly interacts with the other teenagers, preferring to stay on her phone. In the store, she texts instead of partying, although Wendy noticed that she looked up from her phone more than usual which means she is having fun. She is the first person to disappear once the [[Pa and Ma|ghosts]] attack, ending up trapped in a security monitor because they didn't like her doing normal teenage things like texting. After she gets trapped, she changes her 'status' to "Ahhhhhhhhhhh! <3 <3 <3." [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] later saves her and the rest of the teens by doing the Lamby Lamby Dance for the ghosts.       

Tambry has small appearances in several of the episodes afterward, like when she makes a cameo in "[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]" at the diner, texting while sitting in a booth. She also is shown in "[[Double Dipper]]" as one of the people watching [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] and [[Pacifica Northwest]] compete for the Party Crown, and partying herself in the background. In "[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]", Tambry is seen riding the Ferris wheel with [[Thompson]] at the Mystery Fair. Robbie and Wendy mention her in "[[Summerween]]", saying that they are going to a party at her house. In "[[Boss Mabel]]", she is seen at [[the Mystery Shack]], hanging out with Wendy.

In "Mabel's Scrapbook: Heist Movie", Tambry can be seen in the audience for "Pony Heist."

In "[[Scary-oke]]", she attends the "Mystery Shack is Back" party. She takes a picture of a shirtless Thompson with her phone's camera. She promises not to send it to anyone but then pushes the "send all" button.

Tambry reappears in "[[Soos and the Real Girl]]", interacting with a clerk at the store "Overalls Are Cool Now" in the Gravity Falls Mall.

In "[[Blendin's Game]]", Dipper and Mabel travel back in time and meet younger versions of Tambry and Wendy. Young Tambry blurts out to Dipper that young Wendy thinks he's cute.

In "[[The Love God]]", she starts dating [[Robbie Valentino|Robbie]] (courtesy of Mabel).

==Trivia==
*Some TV closed captioning systems misspell her name as "Tambri".
*Wendy said "I've never seen Tambry look up from her phone this long" when she looked up for about a second, but earlier in the episode when Wendy had just came, Tambry wasn't even on her phone.
*Jessica DiCicco, who voices Tambry, also voices another character on the show, [[.GIFfany]].
