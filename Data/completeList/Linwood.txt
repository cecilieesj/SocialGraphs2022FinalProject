'''Linwood''' is a ''[[Fillmore!]]'' character and an X Middle School student.

==Appearance==
Linwood is a caucasian kid with short, brown hair, has green eyes, wears an olive green buttoned shirt with folded collar, jeans with a patch on each knee and black shoes.

==History==
He's seen near the end of <ref>Of Slain Kings on Checkered Fields</ref>. In this, when [[Dawn S. Folsom|Pricipal Folsom]] is commenting to [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] in the cafeteria where the sloppy Joe-eating contest is held, he's no longer there, having already left after winning once again. Instead, Linwood is in his place next to her, much to her surprise. She asks [[Raycliff]] who the boy is and he tells her his name. Then she asks where Fillmore went.

In <ref>[[Field Trip of the Just]]</ref>, he's seen walking through the school's hall when he's passing by Eric Orben, Sanjay, and Dmitri. Sajnay flicks a coin on the floor when Linwood spots it and goes for it. He's then hit on the back of his neck with a spitball by Sanjay, Dmitri swats a book Linwood was carrying out of his hand, and Eric takes Linwood's picture, which is then placed in a locker with other photos of other students. Linwood is left dazed from the camera's flash.
