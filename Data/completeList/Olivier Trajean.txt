==Role in the film==
Throughout the movie, he participates in a commercial about his beverage he calls "Powerade". He called Thunder Jack an old fool for going out into the storm during the race. He won the Arctic Challenge despite [[Ted Brooks]]' intervention. Karma got him back, by having his sponsors' Powerade get frozen and accidentally knock him out, ruining his victory speech.
