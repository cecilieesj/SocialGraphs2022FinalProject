'''Neil Miller''' is [[Laura Miller|Laura]]'s second husband, [[Charlie Calvin]]'s stepfather, and [[Lucy Miller|Lucy]]'s father in ''[[The Santa Clause]]'' films.

==History==
During the custody hearing, after Laura says that she wanted a Mystery Date board game for Christmas when she was Charlie's age, but never got one, Neil admits that he was three years old, and he wanted an Oscar Meyer Weenie Whistle; he added that Christmas came, but he didn't get one, and that was when he stopped believing in Santa Claus.

At the end of the movie, when Scott/Santa drops gifts for Charlie, Laura, and Neil, Neil gets the Oscar Meyer Weenie Whistle and blows it with a look of childlike wonder in his eyes.

Neil then apologizes to Charlie for not believing him when he said that Scott was Santa, and Charlie replied, "That's OK, Neil. You were just denying your inner child."

During the second film, Neil was surprised to hear that Scott has to get married in order to keep being Santa. Neil tells Scott that he can do it before he notices Scott slowly changing back to his old face. Later when Scott and Curtis were trying to summon the tooth fairy in order to get to the North Pole, Neil attempted to help. He tied one of Scott's teeth to a toaster to make it come out which Neil had done several times when he was young in order to get money much to Laura's disbelief. The attempt didn't work and Scott ended up falling down the stairs instead. Luckily for them, his daughter Lucy had one of her baby teeth come out which attracted the Tooth Fairy.

In the third film, Neil and Laura guilt Scott into inviting Lucy to the North Pole because it did not seem fair that he brought his son and not her there. They also insist on going along to supervise. Once at the North Pole, Neil and Laura are greatly amazed at the sight of being at the actual workshop, and happily enjoy themselves.
