'''Blobzilla''' is a monster from the episode "[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]" from the animated television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

==History==
The Blobzilla is a giant black and purple monster made of goo with red eyes. It only appears once as a bounty hunter, it tries to capture [[Hans Rotwood|Professor Rotwood]] for a reward. It is thwarted by the combined effort of Jake, Trixie, and Spud.

==Magical Powers==
Because this creature only makes two very short appearances in "[[Magic Enemy Number One|Magic Enemy #1]]", not much is known about its true abilities.

From what is shown in the series, the Blobzilla, because it is made of living goo, can change its molecular state at will. It can turn liquid or semi-solid whenever it wants, which makes him a very slippery enemy. Via this ability, it is able to go through drains and pipes and hastily escape a battle.

When it attacks, the Blobzilla will wrap around its prey like a swarm of tentacles and will try to suffocate its victims by either squeezing their body or blocking their respiratory system.

==Trivia==
*The Blobzilla is based on the monster featured in the [[1958]] film ''[[wikipedia:The Blob|The Blob]]''.
*Jake is the one who calls this creature Blobzilla, although it remains unclear if it is its true name.
*Jake compares the Blobzilla's attack to being assaulted by a puddle of mud.
