'''Mr. Boonchuy''' is the father of [[Anne Boonchuy]] and a major supporting character of the series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
He was born in Bangkok, Thailand and some time later fell in love with his future wife. Later, they had a daughter, Anne.

When he and his wife immigrated to the US, they opened Thai Go near their house.

===Personality===
Mr. Boonchuy is a very caring and loving man towards his wife and daughter. Like [[Hop Pop Plantar]], Mr. Boonchuy does show some overprotectiveness towards to Anne and to an extension, [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] and [[Polly Plantar]]. Mr. Boonchuy was also capable recognizing how mature Anne had grown during her time in Amphibia and how the Plantars meant so much to her.

===Physical appearance===
Mr. Boonchuy bears few resemblance to Anne, though mostly the dark brown hair. He has a big chin, dark thick brown eyebrows above his eyes, light wrinkles underneath his eyes and a big yet a bit flat nose. He wears a yellow polo shirt with red stripes having a blue shield like symbol at the heart area as well as a 3 at the back of his shirt, a pair of blue jeans and a pair of white socks in home while wearing a pair of brown sandals when he is out. He's the tallest in the family.

For the most part, he wears his gold wedding ring.

==Trivia==
*Mr. Boonchuy was supposed to make his first appearance in "[[Anne Vs. Wild]]", via flashback when Anne comments on her history with camping. The artwork depicted him looking much more stocky than his final design. He was also met to appear in the flashback at the beginning of "[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]", but the scene was also cut.
*He has the ability to speak Thai, much like his wife.
*Mr. Boonchuy can drive a mini van as shown in the "[[The New Normal]]" and "[[Mr. X]]" alongside a motor scooter as shown in "[[Adventures in Catsitting]]".
*Despite being a gamer, he has trouble using a smartphone.
