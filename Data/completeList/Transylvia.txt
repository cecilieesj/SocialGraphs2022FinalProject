'''Transylvia'''Â is the vampire-witch of the Terrified Forest.

Her name is a pun of Transylvania. She is reminiscent of the winged monkeys from ''The Wizard of Oz'' or the ''Tengu'' from Japanese mythology. She travels on a flying "boomerangstick", and is proud of the fact that people are scared of her, but seems to have self-confidence issues (until the end of the episode) and turned out to not be so scary once the gang got to know her (although she dissuaded them from telling anyone).

So far, she's the only Wuzzle that is a hybrid of three animals, instead of just two.
