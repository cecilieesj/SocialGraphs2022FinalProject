'''Petros Xanatos''' is the father of [[David Xanatos]]. He first appeared in the ''[[Gargoyles]]'' episode "[[Vows]]".

A man of strong integrity, Petros initially doesn't agree with the way David lives his life. He believes his son would've been better off as a fisherman like himself.

Peter believed that Xanatos did not deserve the gift that had launched his career.
