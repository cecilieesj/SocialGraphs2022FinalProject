'''Fanny''' is a ceiling fan and one of the major characters from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''.

==Role in the film==
Fanny is first seeing hanging from the living room ceiling, watching the action going on below in [[Rob McGroarty|Rob]] (the Master) and [[Chris McGroarty|Chris]]' new home. When [[Robbie McGroarty|Robbie]] (the Little Master) comes into their lives, Fanny remarks how cute he is and how much more attention they give him than [[Toaster]] and the other appliances.

When the Little Master is taken to [[Mars]], Toaster and the gang go on a mission and enlist Fanny's help to bring him home. She is reluctant to go with them at first and warns them to be real gentle with her. They unscrew her from the ceiling; however, she falls upside down to the floor with a crash, much to her discomfort.

As Toaster and the other appliances travel to Mars, Fanny can be seen whirring through space while attached to the bottom of a laundry basket. During their journey, she gradually softens up and begins to enjoy her flight through space, as she had never experienced it before since she'd been suspended from the ceiling.

When Toaster and the gang succeed in rescuing the Little Master, Fanny returns to Earth with everyone else, including [[Hearing Aid]]'s [[Supreme Commander|long-lost twin brother]] and [[Tinselina]]. She even tells them not to bother screwing her back up on the ceiling because she has grown accustomed to her new upside-down view, but they screw her back anyway.

==Trivia==
*Curiously, in some versions of the film's cover, a preliminary version of her character is shown, who appears to be male and a different style of ceiling fan.
