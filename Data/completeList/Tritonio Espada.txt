'''Tritonio Espada''' is a character in the [[2019]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
=== Personality ===
=== Appearance ===
Tritonio is a light green salamander with lighter shaded spots on his tail while possessing dark-purple hair, a short mustache, and a fake goatee. His attire consists of a typical vintage red French jacket with a brown belt fastened with a golden buckle and white puffy sleeves which are long black heeled boots and grey pants.

In Season 3, Tritonio dresses in a Robin Hood- esque outfit. 

== History ==
===Before===
In his youth, Tritonio lived in Newtopia. During his childhood, he had no friends and family until he was invited to join a group of thieves and got caught stealing. He called his group for help, but he begin realised that they were just using him until outlived his purpose. Since then, he acted as a lone wolf.

===Season 1===
In "[[Combat Camp]]", Tritonio meets [[Anne Boonchuy]], [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]], and [[Polly Plantar]], posing as the owner of a daycare which [[Hop Pop Plantar]] drops them off at as he leaves to attend the Crop-Con convention. After Hop Pop leaves, Tritonio reveals himself to be an adventurer-type instructor who turned the daycare into a combat camp loaded with various weapons of different kinds such as swords, spears, and mushroom bombs. This excites Anne, Sprig, and Polly, but as soon as they start training, Tritonio starts being hard on Anne, making her less thrilled about her training due to having a bad history with her school teachers.

One night, Tritonio finds Anne alone and has a heart-to-heart talk with her when she asks why he's tough on her, which reveals the reason why is because he believes in her potential. After cheering Anne up, he gives her his ancestral sword and tells her to get some sleep as they have more training to do tomorrow.

The next day, Tritonio trains with Anne where she improves her skills, impressing him so much that Anne warms up to him. Then, Tritonio gives the kids one final lesson which involves stealing a precious gem from a moving train. Though Sprig and Polly question it, Tritonio assures them it is just an act. However, when they manage to steal the gem after boarding on the train, Tritonio double-crosses them and takes the jewel for himself, revealing he is actually a thief who used Anne, Sprig, and Polly to help him get the jewel. The kids manage to escape and chase after Tritonio, with Anne defeating him with the sword he gave her. After defeating Tritonio, the toad guards of the train arrest him, revealing to Anne, Sprig, and Polly that Tritonio had tricking children to doing robberies for him for a long time. As he's arrested, Tritonio tells Anne he's proud of her before revealing his goatee was fake when Anne questions about it.
