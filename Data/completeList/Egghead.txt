A non-villainous version of Elihas Starr also appears in the ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'' film ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', played by Michael Cerveris.

Egghead was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and Larry Lieber.

==Appearances==
===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===
Egghead is a briliant scientist who was fired from his job as a prop maker for a movie studio, and thus decided to become a supervillain, using his scientific mind and high-tech gadgets and weaponry to sabotage a movie based on the exploits of [[Avengers|the Avengers]]. Thankfully, the actual Avengers, with the help of [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]], managed to stop him. Most of his gadgets and weapons have an egg theme, hence his supervillain codename.

====''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''====
In flashbacks, Elihas Starr was an old colleague of Dr. [[Hank Pym]] and [[Bill Foster]]. The three worked together on a project to harness [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] energies, but Elihas' desire to be the first to get to the Quantum Realm motivated him to resort to stealing Hank's tech to get there quicker. After Hank discovered this, he discredited Elihas and forced his family (consisting of him, his wife [[Catherine Starr|Catherine]], and their daughter [[Ghost|Ava]]) to go into hiding.

Elihas continued the project in secret, however, and eventually recreated the machine for the Quantum Realm; but his success was short-lived, for the machine became unstable and threatened to explode. Elihas realized the error of his ambitions too late, and urged Catherine and Ava to get out of the facility while he tried to stop the machine. However, Ava decided to stay to be with her father and Catherine running after to get her, but it was too late. The device exploded, killing Elihas and Catherine; Ava survived and received powers from the quantum energy.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Elihas Starr was a scientist working at an atomic research center for the government until he was fired due to charges of espionage. He earned the nickname Egghead due to the unusual egg-shape of his skull. Starr was also a member of the super-villain group known as Intelligencia, which is composed of the smartest villains in the Marvel Universe.
