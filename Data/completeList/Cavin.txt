'''Cavin''' is a character from Disney's [[1985]]-[[1991]] television series, ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. He was voiced by multiple people over the course of the series.

==Background==
Cavin is presented as a page aka squire to [[Sir Tuxford]] of [[Dunwyn Castle]]. His only known family is his grandfather, [[Sir Gawain]].

Cavin is one of the few people to know of the [[Gummi Bears]]' existence, and becomes an ally to them. He is shown to be best friends with [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], as they both share the dream of becoming a knight one day.

Quickly, Calvin becomes friends with [[Princess Calla]], with each harboring mutual feelings for each other.

==Appearances==
In the premiere episode, "[[A New Beginning]]", Cavin wears a [[Gummi Bear Medallion]] given to him by his grandfather. He ends up stumbling into [[Gummi Glen|the home of the Gummi Bears]] by accident, and convinces them to assist him in the defense of Dunwyn from [[Duke Igthorn]].

Cavin leaves his Gummi Bear Medallion with [[Zummi Gummi|Zummi]], which allows the Gummi Bears to unlock the [[Great Book of Gummi]] and discover much of their lost heritage.

Cavin becomes a close ally to the Gummi Bears, while keeping their existence a secret from other humans.
