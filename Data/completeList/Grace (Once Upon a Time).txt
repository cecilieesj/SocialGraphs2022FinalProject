'''Grace''' is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. She is portrayed by guest star Ali Skovbye, her [[Storybrooke]] counterpart is Paige.

==Biography==
In the Enchanted Forest, Grace lives in a house with her [[Mad Hatter|father]], who is a mushroom seller. They are playing hide-and-seek, and after he finds her, they head home to discover that the Evil Queen has come calling. Knowing that her presence is a bad sign, Jefferson tells Grace to wait in the woods while he speaks with their visitor.

The next day, while visiting the market with her father, Grace admires a white stuffed rabbit and asks Jefferson for it. However, Jefferson is unable to buy the toy, even after he offers all the money he has. Grace, however, understands, and later happily accepts a stuffed rabbit hand made by her father. Jefferson explains he has to go away to do a job for [[The Evil Queen]]. Grace begs her father not to help the Evil Queen, but he sends her to stay with the neighbors and promises to return in time for a tea party.

After the casting of the curse, Paige lives in the town of Storybrooke with her parents. She is completely unaware the family she lives with is all a part of the curse falsifying memories and creating a new life for her in Storybrooke, and her true father is the next door neighbor, [[Mad Hatter|Jefferson]].

After [[Emma Swan]] escapes Jefferson, who had seemingly crazy ideas about himself being the Mad Hatter, she sees a female classmate walk by and greet [[Henry Mills]] at school. Emma asks who the girl is, and Henry says Paige is one of his classmates. Only then does Emma have a strange hunch and looks through Henry's Once Upon a Time book to find that Paige looks very similar to the young girl in the story; something she cannot fathom.

After Emma breaks the curse, Henry convinces Jefferson he should look for his daughter despite feeling guilty for having left her when he got trapped in Wonderland.

Shortly afterward, Jefferson sees Paige with some other children. He calls out to her using her Enchanted Forest name, Grace, which prompts her to stop in her tracks. She happily reunites with her father, telling him that she knew he would find her.
