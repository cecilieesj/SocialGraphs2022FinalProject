'''Everett Konquist''' is an X Middle School student and owner of a virtual pet in the [[Toon Disney]] animated series ''[[Fillmore!]]''

==History==
In the episode "Nappers Never Sleep", Everett is the owner of Duappy, the oldest living digital pet in the world, and it's gone missing. He doesn't have many friends (other than his neighbor and schoolmate, [[Lorraine Almaden]]), so he's very attached to it, holding it near and dear to him. When [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] are searching for clues to this in a department at a mall and just as they get close to solving it, someone releases balls from a cage and the investigators get caught in the ball stampede to prevent them from reaching the solution. Later, when they're at the Almadens' place, they learn from Everett's mother, [[Mrs. Konquist]], who was hiding in a cabinet, that she was the one who caused the ball stampede. She says she did it, because she rather Everett spend time socializing with real people and making friends more instead of remaining an introvert. Therefore, he'd need Duappy less. Later, when it's found out that Lorraine (who is one of the two suspects, the other being [[Biana Bully]]), who took Duappy, Everett is displeased and is unwilling to forgive her at first, but Fillmore tells him she made a mistake and deserves a second chance. After finding that Biana also held Duappy hostage and attempted to drench it in a swimming pool, Fillmore and Ingrid manage to get there to save it in time and it's returned to Everett. Near the episode's end, Everett made amends with Lorraine. Deciding he no longer needs Duappy, he offers it to Fillmore.
