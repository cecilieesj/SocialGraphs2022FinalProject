==Appearances==
===''[[The Jungle Book]]''===
They are first seen when [[Bagheera]] brings an infant [[Mowgli]] to their cave. The man-cub's cries alert [[Raksha]] and [[Rama]], the wolf pups' parents. They notice Mowgli and, knowing the man-cub will die if not cared for, take him inside the cave. Many years later, Mowgli is almost 10 years old, The wolf pups are seen ten years later as young adults with pups of their own, and Mowgli has grown up as well. Mowgli howls to his adult wolf siblings, who jump on top of the man-cub and lick his face. They are not seen throughout the rest of the film after that.

===[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|''The Jungle Book'' (2016)]]===
The wolf pups make major appearances in the live-action remake of ''The Jungle Book''.
