'''Cal Weathers''' is a minor character in the [[2017]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Cars 3]]''. He is a professional race car who raced for the [[Dinoco]] team in the [[Piston Cup|Piston Cup Racing Series]] before retiring in 2016.<ref name="MTC">''Meet the Cars''</ref> The nephew of seven-time Piston Cup champion Strip "[[The King (Cars)|The King]]" Weathers, Cal grew up watching his uncle tear up the track, and he became the [[Dinoco]] racer following his uncle's retirement.<ref name="NASCAR">[http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2017/2/23/disney-pixar-cars-3-gears-up-for-season-long-ride-with-nascar.html 'Cars 3' gears up for season-long ride with NASCAR]</ref>

Weathers was a successful racer who befriended many of his competitors with his uncle as his crew chief, including [[Lightning McQueen]], Bobby Swift, and Brick Yardley. Despite his success, [[Tex Dinoco]] still sought to replace him, specifically with McQueen. In the 2016 season, after suffering many losses against next-generation rookies, Weathers announced his retirement and [[Cruz Ramirez]] would eventually become the Dinoco racer in his place.

==Appearance==
In ''[[Cars 3]]'', Cal competes in the 2016 Piston Cup season, alongside his friends Bobby Swift, [[Lightning McQueen]], and Brick Yardley. The four racers constantly pull pranks on each other and joke around on the track. Though he was the one who got pranked the most. While being interviewed after winning a race at Rocker Arms International, McQueen's pittie Guido over-inflates his tires, while releasing Lightning McQueen balloons behind him. Others often poke fun at Cal's poor ability to think of comebacks in response to jokes.

McQueen, Swift, Weathers, and Yardley continue to perform well throughout the season, before a rookie named [[Jackson Storm]] starts a winning streak. He is still able to keep preforming well as he finishes in 9th at Rustbelt Raceway, 15th at Georgia Motor Speedway, 5th at the Data Shift 400 and 27th at the Heartland Motor Speedway. Unable to keep up with Storm, Cal eventually decides to retire. McQueen approaches Cal before his departure in hopes of convincing him to stay, but Cal persists on retiring, and reminisces on the good times he had. As Cal's hauler transports him away, McQueen watches sadly.

At the Florida 500, when [[Cruz Ramirez]] manages to win the race, [[Tex Dinoco]], Strip, and Cal, approach her and McQueen to once again offer the Dinoco sponsorship. They accept the offer, and Cruz becomes the new Dinoco racer.

==Trivia==
*According to the diecast range, he was originally going to be called '''Strip Weathers Jr.''' as the son of The King. This is likely a reference that he's voiced by Richard Petty's son Kyle.
**Another name he had before the launch of ''Cars 3'' was Hank Weathers.
* He is named after Carl Weathers.
*Despite being Dinoco sponsored, he was never their best racers unlike his uncle, though he is shown winning one race in the movie, beating McQueen by a second.
*Cal possibly became the Dinoco racer between the events of the first and third films due to McQueen turning down the offer from Tex for his good sportsmanship.
*Years before Cars 3 was released, his actor Kyle Petty, has visited the [[Moteurs... Action! Stunt Show Spectacular|Lights Motors Action]] show at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]. This was also used in featurette during the Disney Parks 2005 Christmas Parade, though Kyle Petty can't drive one of their vehicles since he isn't a stunt driver.
