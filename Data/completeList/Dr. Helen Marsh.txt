'''Dr. Helen Marsh''' is a character from the attraction [[Dinosaur (attraction)|DINOSAUR]] in [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]].

== History ==
Dr. Helen Marsh was a doctor of unknown field with a reputation for saving museums and scientific institutions from bankruptcy.  In the 1990s she was hired to lead the [[Dino Institute]] in a small town within Diggs County, [[Florida]].  As leader, Marsh bought out the company ChronoTech which was studying time-travel via vehicles known as the ''CTX Time Rovers''.

Marsh's acquiring of ChronoTech aided the company in creating functional Time Rovers that the Dino Institute could use for field studies.  To acquire further funds, Dr. Marsh arranged for civilian tours of the Mesozoic era  in these rovers; taking advantage of how the Dino Institute's headquarters were located in a dinosaur oriented tourist-town.  These rovers were controlled by Marsh's subordinate [[Dr. Grant Seeker]] who was known for undermining her in his obsession with dinosaurs.

During one civilian tour, Dr. Seeker hijacked the Time Rover and sent it to the KT-Extinction Event in-order to retrieve an [[iguanodon]] which his team probed on an earlier mission.  The mission was disastrous but succeeded in retrieving the iguanodon even though it later escaped from the facility.  Dr. Seeker attempted to cover this affair up and out of Dr. Marsh's knowledge.

=== [[Disney Springs|Disney Springs Christmas Tree Trail]] ===
Dr. Helen Marsh is mentioned on a poster left in Disney Springs by Dr. Seeker.  Seeker's poster asks [[Disney Springs (town)|Disney Springs]] residents for assistance in tracking down Aladar while also asking that it is kept a secret from Dr. Marsh.
