'''Molly Jo''' is a secondary character from the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Molly Jo is a nice girl with an appreciation for those who do the right thing. She was quick to befriend the new local hero "[[Sprig Plantar|Frog-Man]]" (actually Sprig Plantar) after seeing him save several people, including herself, from a bus accident. However, the thing she hates the most is glory hounds who put lives in danger for the sake of attention, as seen when she reprimanded Sprig and her grandfather, Robert Otto, for fighting and putting the city at risk to get attention. She can also be forgiving if people make up for their mistakes, such as when she reconciled with Sprig after he and Otto repaired the damage they caused.

She is also loyal to her friends, as seen when she choose to save Sprig from an FBI bade even after learning he is a frog from another dimension and that saving him would involve getting in problems with the federal government. She is also as friendly with Sprig as before.

===Physical appearance===
Molly Jo is a young human girl slightly than Sprig, with waist long blonde hair dyed pink on her left side and light green on the bottom. Her outfit consists of a white t-shirt with a brown sweater vest, a green skit, black leggings, and dark blue-gray boots with spikes on the back, as well as toes, stars, and stud-like buttons all of them colored in black. She also wears in her right wrist a spiked bracelet, and a black shoulder bag that has on it the image of a hot pink cat.

==Trivia==
*The character is inspired by [[Mary Jane Watson]], from the ''Spider-Man'' comics. Her initials are even "MJ", which is one of the character's nicknames.
**She also has a blonde hair, similar to [[Gwen Stacy]], albeit Molly Jo's is dyed with pink and green colorations. However, Gwen Stacy also has her blonde hair dyed with pink colorations at times.
**Additionally, she is the granddaughter of Robert Otto, who became an enemy of Sprig's in his "Frog-Man" identity. This is similar to how [[Harry Osborn]] is the son of Spider-Man's archnemesis, the [[Green Goblin]].
