On the day of the wedding, Mr. and Mrs Hillman sit besides their daughter, as she gets married to Aamir, in a ceremony performed by [[Sheikh Abdullah]]. The party is held at a venue, and everyone takes part in celebrations. Mr. and Mrs. Hillman participate in a Bollywood dance number, along with [[Yusuf Khan|Yusuf]], Muneeba and their son. They are later forced to exit the building, alongside the other partygoers, when the fire alarm is triggered.

Mr. and Mrs. Hillman later arriving at Coles Academy High School, in protest of [[Damage Control]], who are present to capture the masked superheroine, known as [[Ms. Marvel|Night Light]] and her associate. They are joined by members of their communtiy, including Tyesha and the Khans.

The boy releases a surge of energy, and produces a large scale of crystalline constructs everywhere, but Night Light manages to placate him.
