==Appearances==
===''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks]]''===
Tanya is the Ducks' resident genius who is often the one turned to for advice, even by [[Wildwing Flashblade|Wildwing]]. She is good with mechanics and uses the Omnitool on her wrist with many of her projects. Despite her intellect, she has bad allergies, lacks confidence, has a gentler personality, and is not as good a fighter as the other ducks. She makes up for this with her good common sense and wry humor. According to herself, her middle name is Gertrude. Her jersey number is 23.
