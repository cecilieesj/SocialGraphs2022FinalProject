}}'''Jenny''' is [[Joe (Melody Time)|Joe]]'s partner in the ''[[Once Upon a Wintertime]]'' segment inÂ ''[[Melody Time]]''. She goes out ice skating with Joe. She is a lovely and sweet young lady, however she quickly becomes annoyed at Joe's teasing when she is struggling to skate.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
She is a beautiful and slender woman with fair skin, dark lavender eyelids, thin black eyebrows, red-orange hair with curls and rose-red lips. She wears a yellow long-sleeved jacket with a long lime-green skirt with pink inside and multiple petticoats, magenta gloves, a yellow bonnet with a white bow and a stripe, white bloomers and white boot-like skaters.

==Appearances==
===''[[Melody Time]]''===
Jenny and Joe spend time with each other during wintertime riding on a sleigh (along with animal couples following them). They later spend time ice-skating together ice skate but when a near-tragedy ensues on thin ice after Joe smirks at her falling as she separates from him, Joe was able to rescue her on thin ice. After rescuing, she and Joe reunite with each other riding on their sleigh again as the woodland animals bid a farewell to them.
