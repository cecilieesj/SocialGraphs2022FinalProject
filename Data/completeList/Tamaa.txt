He is a greater racket-tailed drongo who can, like most of his kind, mimic the voices of many different animals.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
As a drongo, Tamaa is a small dark-feathered bird with a gray beak and small striped legs. He has wings with dark gray feathers and a black border pattern across. Drongo's head also has a crest formed from larger feathers, and he has a black forked tail ending with two long feathers. Tamaa has green irises, specifically chalet.

==Role in the series==
Tamaa used his mimicry ability to imitate predators so he could scare some animals, and thus get their food when they fled. After discovering that he was behind the fleeing animals, the [[Lion Guard]] convince him to stop what he is doing.

Unfortunately, [[Janja]] overheard the conversation, so he and his minions capture Tamaa to use him so they can scare animals and capture them for food. However, Tamaa mimics Janja's voice to escape his imprisonment and later mimics the Lion Guard to trick Janja into retreating just as the real Lion Guard arrives.

After the dilemma is resolved, the Lion Guard commends Tamaa for his bravery in saving the animals. Tamaa, in turn, promises to never use his talent again unless for good intentions.

== Relationships ==

=== Friends ===
[[Kion]]

When the pair first met, Kion was less than impressed at Tamaa for using his skill to steal food from other animals, and made him promise to cease that behavior. Although the drongo went back on his word briefly, Kion appreciated his help when he returned to assist the Guard, trusted the drongo from then on.

In "Divide and Conquer,"  Kion turned to Tamaa when he needed help. Tamaa feared he might be getting the wrong idea due to the large amount of donated food at his feet, but Kion already trusted Tamaa, and knew that he wasn't going back on his word. When Tamaa is caught out by the jackals, Kion assures him that it wasn't his fault, and cares more about making sure that Tamaa is in a safe space for the rest of the battle.

[[Bunga]]

Bunga and Tamaa are on good terms. Bunga was the one who really wanted Tamaa to do his voice. 

[[Fuli]], [[Beshte]] and [[Ono]]

Tamaa is on good terms with the other members of the Lion Guard. He helps them save the impalas from Janja's Clan.

[[Thurston]]

Though they only interacted once Thurston was impressed at the way the drongo can imitate him. Which causes Thurston to laugh and marvel at how it seems like he's talking, but he is actually not. When Tamaa finishes the performance, Thurston says "ta-ta" and Tamaa says "ta-ta" back in Thurston's voice. He laughs about how he's saying "ta-ta" to himself.

=== Acquaintances ===
[[Twiga]] and [[Juhudi]]

Tamaa is on good terms with Twiga and Juhudi. Though they only interacted once, Twiga is among the group of animals getting entertained by Tamaa.

When she asks him if he can do her voice, while sounding like Twiga he replies with "Yes, but can you hear me from up there?", causing her to laugh. She appears to find Tamaa's antics entertaining.

[[Boboka]]

Though they only interacted once, Boboka is among the group of animals getting entertained by Tamaa.

[[Rafiki]]

Tamaa is good relationship of Rafiki who helped by Lion Guard to battle against Janja and his Clan and Reirei and her Pack who tried to killed Rafiki as a team work.

=== Enemies ===
[[Janja's Clan]]

Tamaa hates Janja's Clan. After running from the Lion Guard, Janja hears a voice that sounds just like him from a bush. It turned out to be Tamaa. Under his orders, his sidekick Cheezi grabs him. He later uses the bird in his plot to have an impala buffet in the Outlands. However, he had threatened to eat him if he did not do so. Later when Tamaa reforms from his selfish ways, he imitates the Lion Guard to outsmart him, Cheezi and Chungu. When he found this out he attempted to eat him, but Kion stopped him before he could.

[[Reirei's Pack]]

While Kion and the rest of the Lion Guard save Rafiki rom being murdered by Janja's Clan, Tamaa distracts her pack while they are going after a small herd of gazelles. She eventually finds out about the trickery and blames Kion for tricking them. After the jackals meet with the hyenas, they battle the Guard, Rafiki, and Tamaa and the heroes win leading them to return to the
