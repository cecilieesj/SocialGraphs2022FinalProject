'''Otika '''is one of the minor protagonists from ''The Pastoral Symphony'' segment of the [[1940]] film ''[[Fantasia]]''. Though she appeared in the film while it was in theaters, she, like [[Sunflower]], has been removed from all releases of the film due to being a racist stereotype.

==Background==
===Personality===
Like Sunflower, Otika appears to be a very young Centaurette and is smaller than the other Centaurettes. Unlike Sunflower, Otika serves [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]] along with the Zebra Centaurettes. She is kind and is a great servant but will be uncertain what to do if her master, Bacchus, ends up drunk.

==Role in the film==
Otika is only seen twice in the entire segment. She is first seen shining the hooves of one Centaurette and then scrubbing it with a cattail. And later, she's seen rolling the red carpet down so that Bacchus can sit on a wooden chair. She is uncertain about this and when Bacchus falls off the chair she runs off and is not seen again in the rest of the segment.

==Trivia==
*Despite being a character from ''Fantasia'', Otika does not appear in future releases of the film. Just like the case with Sunflower, the scene that showed her is objectionable and was removed from the film to prevent racial controversy.
*Like Sunflower, Otika is not seen or heard of at the Disney theme parks. Finding a publicity still of her in the film is more difficult than finding a still of Sunflower.
**Also like Sunflower, Otika is neither seen in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' or any other Disney TV shows.
**While ''Fantasia'' was released on [[Disney+]] and despite the outdated cultural depictions disclaimer, it shows the "Pastoral Symphony" segment still without Otika and Sunflower.
