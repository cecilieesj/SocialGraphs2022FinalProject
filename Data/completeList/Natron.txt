Natron is bent on domination of the galaxy and destruction of all those who oppose his will.

*"Infidel planet... meet your destiny."
*"I am your blighted past. I am your anguished future. I am Natron."
*"Your feeble weapons cannot destroy Natron the Invincible!"
*"Yes, come closer. Perish in my pure light of pain!"
