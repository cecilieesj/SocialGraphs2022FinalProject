'''Stacey''' is the supporting character in the [[Disneytoon Studios|Disney]]'s [[1995]] feature film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''. She is voiced by [[Jenna von Oÿ]].

==Background==
===''[[A Goofy Movie]]''===
Stacey is [[Roxanne]]'s talkative best friend as well as their school's student body president. She is also one of the many characters in the opening song "After Today."

She is formally introduced during the school's last day assembly, as she stands on stage at the podium to close out the school year, invite everyone to her end-of-school party to watch the [[Powerline]] concert live on pay-per-view and to introduce [[Principal Mazur]] to the podium for his own end-of-school speech, which is soon interrupted by an unexpected performance of Powerline's "Stand Out" by [[Max Goof]] to rebuild his public reputation with the student body before being dismissed for the summer.

During Max's performance as Powerline, Stacey notices Roxanne is really excited. Afterward, she encourages Roxanne to talk to Max while he's waiting in front of Principal Mazur's office after he was revealed to be the performer and was sent to Mazur's office with [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]] and [[P.J.]] to await punishment after Mazur notified their families of what happened.

The next Saturday, while watching the Powerline concert at her party, Stacey gives an annoyed look to Bobby as he expresses his doubts that Max would show up onstage with Powerline (which Max had previously told Roxanne that he would). Stacey attempted to reassure Roxanne that Max would make good on his promise, though Stacey clearly had doubts of her own as to if Max would keep his promise to Roxanne. When Max and Goofy do appear on-stage with Powerline, Stacey, and Roxanne attempt to match Max's dance moves and get sprayed with cheese by Bobby. After Bobby drops his Cheddar Whizzy can, Stacey goes to pick it up; she and Bobby's hands meet and they share a moment of attraction where their eyes meet each other.

Like Roxanne, Stacey is absent from the direct-to-video sequel, ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. It can be assumed that any potential romance shared between her and Bobby probably didn't pan out as, in the film, Bobby attempts to flirt with [[Beret Girl]] before she turns him down for P.J.

===''Disney Adventures'' comic===
Stacey also appeared in a ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine ''[[Goof Troop]]'' comic set at some point after the events of ''A Goofy Movie''. In this story, titled "My Hero", Stacey is first seen in class with Roxanne, Max, and [[P.J.]], watching an old film about a heroic figure who rescues a damsel in distress. When Max overhears Roxanne wishing to herself that she could meet a guy like that hero in the movie, Max is inspired to try and save Roxanne from some kind of danger.

The next day, Stacey is seen having lunch in the school cafeteria with Roxanne and a few other girls. During this time, Max makes his first attempt to "save" Roxanne after he has P.J.'s attempt to tie her shoelaces together while Bobby distracts her and Stacey. However, P.J. accidentally tied Stacey's shoelaces together, causing her instead of Roxanne to then trip over and fall into Max's waiting arms, much to Max's embarrassment and Roxanne's mild annoyance.

===''Le Journal de Mickey''===
On [[February 12]], [[1997]], Issue #2330 of the French magazine ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' published a special ''Dingo & Max''<ref>"Goofy & Max", the French title of ''A Goofy Movie''</ref> comic which featured Stacey (briefly) and others from ''A Goofy Movie''. In this story, titled "Je T'Ayuck" ("I Ayuck You"),<ref>A play on the phrase "Je T'Aime", which is French for "I Love You"</ref> Max learns from Stacey about Roxanne's birthday being the next day and, after a lengthy misunderstanding on Max's part regarding Roxanne and another guy, Stacey is seen the next day at school trying to comfort a crying Roxanne after said the other guy, Hubert, gets sick. He and Roxanne were to play the leads in a surprise play to be performed for the whole school in honor of Valentine's Day, but Hubert's sudden illness means the play will have to be canceled. Stacey explains the situation to Max when he sees Roxanne crying, and Max offers to fill in for Hubert, allowing the play to go off without a hitch.

===''Disney Minnie: Where's Fifi?''===
Stacey made a brief cameo appearance in the 2014 ''Disney Minnie'' storybook by Bendon Publishing, ''Where's Fifi?'', a remake of the 1992 ''[[Minnie 'n Me]]'' [[Where's Fifi?|storybook of the same name]] by Little Golden Books. In this 2014 story, Stacey appears on the second-to-last page of the book as one of the judges of a local dog show.

==Trivia==
*The most likely reason for why Stacey (and [[Roxanne]]) was absent from the events of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' was because, like how other members of the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' TV series who were absent from ''A Goofy Movie'' (e.g. - [[Peg Pete|Peg]], [[Pistol Pete|Pistol]], [[Waffles]], and [[Chainsaw (Goof Troop)|Chainsaw]]) simply didn't factor enough into that movie's father-son story to warrant an appearance for them. She likewise, simply didn't factor into any of the ''three'' main plots of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'': Goofy's and Max's "father & son at college" story, Max's College X-Games story, and Goofy's "return to college for a degree" story.
*That being said, Stacey's voice actress, [[Jenna von Oÿ]] did lend her voice to one of the co-ed college students in the second movie, as a nod to her having voiced Stacey in the first movie.
*The ''Disney Adventures'' comic strip mentioned above puts Stacey in the same grade and class as Max, P.J., and Roxanne. Since director [[Kevin Lima]] stated in ''[[The Making of A Goofy Movie]]'' that Max is 14 years old in ''A Goofy Movie'' (which took place at the end of a high school year), that would put him (and by extension, P.J., Roxanne, and Stacey) in 9th Grade during the movie's time. This would then mean that Stacey, who was shown in the movie to be the school's student body president, not only ran for president but also won the election during her freshman year of high school, beating out all other candidates who may have been in their junior or even senior year. That is truly impressive.
*In the novelization of ''A Goofy Movie'' published by [[wikipedia:Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], Stacey is said to be the class president instead of the student body president. Though, the novel also erroneously refers to the school as a junior high school instead of a high school.
*Similarly, in the ''A Goofy Movie Mini-Comic''—a short 14-page English translation of the movie's 44-page French graphic novel adaptation, which was included with the movie's UK VHS release in [[1997]]—Stacey refers to herself not as the student body president, but instead as "head prefect".
*In a [http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/walt-disney-characters/images/40252385/title/walt-disney-book-scans-goofy-movie-story-max-goof-danish-version-photo Danish storybook adaptation] of ''A Goofy Movie'', Stacey is said by the text to be "a wealthy girl" ("en velhavende pige").
*In the above-described ''Le Journal de Mickey'' comic, Stacey's color scheme is rather different from the one she had in ''A Goofy Movie'' and the ''Goof Troop'' comic from ''Disney Adventures''. Her hat is green instead of cream, its flower is pink-petaled with a yellow center instead of yellow-petaled with a brown (''A Goofy Movie'') or green (''Disney Adventures'') center, her hair is bright orange instead of light brown, her glasses are tinted blue (or have no tint at all) instead of tinted pink, her jacket is burgundy instead of lavender, her shirt is yellow instead of red, her pants are light brown instead of dark reddish-brown, and her shoes are the same burgundy as her jacket instead of light brown.
