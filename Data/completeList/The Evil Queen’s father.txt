This '''unnamed man''' was the greater-scope villain of [[Fairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen]],  a mirror-maker and [[The Evil Queen]]'s father.

==Background==
When his wife died giving birth to the Queen-to-be, the cruel mirror-maker blamed his own daughter for her death and constantly told her she was ugly, leading her to want to be the “fairest of all.” Before he died, he made a deal with [[Lucinda, Ruby, and Martha]] that they put his soul into one of his mirrors, thus making it become the [[Magic Mirror]].

The Queen’s father is the greater-scope villain of the book, as his soul was the one who made the Queen spiral into madness and turn her against her own family.
