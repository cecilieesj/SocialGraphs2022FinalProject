Koboi also orders Artemis to "return it to me or I will destroy everything you love."
==Personality==
Genocidal and ruthless, Koboi resented everything about the human people by blaming them for the previous war. She also was appalled how her race had been reduced among humans to silly stories and the objects of laughter which frightened children. Koboi coveted the Aculos, convinced that the magical object would grant her ultimate power. She wished to annihilate mankind by staying in the shadows, never showing her face and speaking with a raspy voice.
