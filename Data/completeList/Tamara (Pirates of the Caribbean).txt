'''Tamara''' is a minor antagonist from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''. Tamara also appeared in an extended [[World of Color]] sequence to promote the film.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===
Tamara takes part in the battle between mermaids and Blackbeard's crew at Whitecap Bay. When Scrum sings "[[My Jolly Sailor Bold]]", Tamara first appears before him and seduces him. Entrancing the pirates, she sings Scrum's song as the other mermaids surround the longboat full of Blackbeard's crewmen. Scrum is almost powerless to resist a kiss from the beautiful mermaid, but before succumbing, the mermaid reveals her true form. She tries to attack but is hit with an oar. The mermaids then afterward attack the crew. Fortunately, the crew survives when Jack Sparrow causes an explosion in the tower at Whitecap Bay, causing Tamara and the rest of the mermaids to retreats from the explosion with the exception of [[Syrena]].

==Disney Parks==
===[[World of Color]]===
