Hudd, escaped, and Vaneé kept chasing him, vowing to hunt him down. Telling scary stories along the way, Vaneé captured Hudd again, and tied him into the torture web. However, Lina Graf, disguised as an Inquisitor named Fourth Sister, came. Lying to Vaneé that it was orders from Palpatine, Lina Graf stated that Hudd must be transported to Coruscant. Vaneé, dueling Lina, told him of a story that happened in the fortress early days, saying that people must earn their respect within the walls of Fortress Vader. Knowing Lina was a fraud, Vaneé continued dueling her, but she and Hudd managed to escape. Angered with Vaneé, Vader electrocuted him on a web, but allowed him to live.

Vaneé taunted, him, saying that he is safe, but they are not, and retreated as Lava Troopers attacked them.

===''Star Wars Adventures: Shadow of Vader's Castle''===
In a flashback told by Mustafarian Lellis, a legend was told by Mustafarians surrounding the origin of Vaneé. In the story, it shows that an Imperial Inspector was sent to Fortress Vader to investigate why Stormtroopers have gone mad, only to learn that it was the Dark Side infested Lava Fumes that rose from the lake that caused all of this. He got trapped, however, from Vader, and inhaled the fumes for days and days until his mind unraveled and he finally died, but a new separate entity personality, an evil and twisted lunatic was born. Vader asked the lunatic what his name was, and the man said "Vaneé." Vaneé gained sanity and learned to be sophisticated ever since than, but was  the loyal Sith servant to Darth Vader. In the present day, at some point in time, Vaneé angered Vader, which caused him to lock him in a pit. Two young Mustafarians, name Tuttel and Giggek planned to blow up the fortress through detonators, and tried to rescue Vaneé, who pretended to be an old man, but betrayed them. The fortress bottom exploded after Giggek sacrificed himself by activating the detonators, but Vaneé survived. Vaneé heard the voice of his master Darth Vader, and Vader`s seemingly ghost told him that he will rise again, more powerful than ever before. 

=== ''Star Wars Adventures: Ghosts of Vader's Castle'' ===
Vaneé used the Force to send nightmares and dreams to the enemies who wronged him. Kidnapping Milo Graf, Lina Graf's younger brother, Vaneé eventually lured them to Mustafar. However, it was revealed that Vader's ghost was nothing more than a hallucination. Vaneé got trapped in his chair, forcing to suffer illusions with Vader for the rest of his life.
