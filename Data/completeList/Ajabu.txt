==Role in the series==
==="[[The Imaginary Okapi]]"===
[[Beshte]] encounters Ajabu while hiding in some bushes he when stepped on his hoof. Beshte is surprised cause he's never seen anybody like him, and Ajabu explains that he's new in the Pride Lands.

Ajabu is later pursued by a leopard named [[Makucha]], who has followed Ajabu from his old home and refuses to stop his hunt as okapis are rare. Ajabu attempts to escape Makucha through a herd of zebras but fails.

Ajabu later races past Beshte and the rest of the Lion Guard whilst being chased by Makucha. [[Kion]], [[Bunga]], and [[Fuli]] face off with Makucha whilst Ajabu watches on with Beshte, who then comes to his friends aid by charging at Makucha, who gives up on continuing to hunt Ajabu and leaves to search for easier prey. Following this, Ajabu thanks the Lion Guard but says that Makucha might be waiting for him at his old home.

Kion takes Ajabu to his parents [[Simba]] and [[Nala]], who give the okapi their blessing to stay in the Pride Lands. Afterward, Ajabu joins the Lion Guard in playing Hide and Seek.

== Trivia ==
* When Ajabu mentions there are not a lot of him and when Makucha says that okapis are rare, this is reference to okapis being endangered.
* For some reason, Ajabu does not possess any ossicones, despite being a male okapi.
