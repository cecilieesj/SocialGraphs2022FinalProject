===="[[Miniature Golf]]"====
Ella is first mentioned at the start of the episode; Zack had called her up and asked for a date. Zack apparently hit her with a spitball in biology class. Ella, Zack, [[Cody Martin|Cody]], and [[Barbara Brownstein|Barbara]] all go to Putt Putt Party, a mini-golf place. Zack attempts to help Ella by telling her how to swing the putt and she gets a hole in one. Then, for the next few rounds she gets more "hole in one's", indicating that she is great at miniature golf. When Zack has a bad game, he starts taking his anger out to Ella. The next day, Zack invites Ella to play another game, with Cody and Barbara there too. This time, Zack wins due to practice. Zack becomes a sore winner, and brags. This causes Ella to swear and leave. Back at Suite 2330, Cody, Ella, and Barbara return and Zack apologizes. They then agree to do a putt-putt tournament. After that Ella is never seen again.
