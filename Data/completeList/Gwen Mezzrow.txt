'''Gwen Mezzrow''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is the "occasional" love interest to [[Milo Kamalani]] and has a habit of going back and forth with loving and hating him for no reason.

==Background==
Gwen Mezzrow is a student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]]. In her first appearance, she is seen attempting to woo [[Milo Kamalani]] much to his displeasure. To deter her, [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] pretends to be his girlfriend which ends up spiraling out of control and dragging everyone else into a web of lies. By then, Milo begins to legitimately fall in love with Gwen. When he attempts to reveal this to her, Gwen reveals that she lied so that she can capture the attention of [[Dieter Liederhosen]]. Unfortunately for her, he does not reciprocate these feelings. Since then, Gwen and Milo have had a very unusual relationship.

Gwen has a habit of liking Milo one day and then despising him the next. Nevertheless, Milo does everything he can to win her over. Gwen every now and then will be pulled into one of Pepper Ann's unusual schemes, though unlike everyone else, she does not seem to mind what they entail. In "[[The Velvet Room]]", her father is revealed to be a basketball coach and it is implied that she herself has an affinity for the sport, though this is hardly ever shown.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Gwen has had a decent life and misses Milo, though she is sad to find out he is married already. Upon meeting [[Stewart Walldinger]], who has been discontent over the fact that no one remembers him, she admits that she thought he was cute and asks him out, to which he accepts. However unbeknownst to her, it is quickly revealed that he barely remembers her.

===Personality===
Gwen is a rather bubbly, yet happy young girl who is usually in a good mood, that is until she runs into Milo and then her personality goes one of two ways; she either becomes minx-like and flirtatious, or annoyed and dismissive. Her bipolar-esque front implies that she has a bit of a playful side that hinges on maliciousness. Nevertheless, she is a relatively good person and tends to be less antagonistic unlike the other students at Hazelnut. Despite her flirtations with Milo, she usually keeps to herself until otherwise called upon.

===Physical appearance===
Gwen is a Caucasian girl of average height with defined eyes and blonde hair, the top part of which resembles a bowl cut, though are actually really large bangs, but has two long pigtails that dangle underneath. She wears a blue turquoise shirt with a yellow oval mark on it and bares a midriff. She wears a light red skirt and magenta sneakers for her rather large feet.

==Trivia==
*Gwen's reason for being so split with Milo is never explained. Additionally, her crush on Dieter is also never elaborated on.
*Despite Gwen telling Stewart that she always had a crush on him in "The Finale", the two of them barely had any interaction in the series.
