==History==
He appears for the first time in 2008, in the saga of Ultraheroes. Does not really matter, because there are a lot more famous characters like [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[The Duck Avenger|Phantom Duck]]. 
Another "small" alter-ego is called Ciccio fork, a wrestler in the Mickey Mouse number 2711.

When [[Eega Beeva]] recruited superheroes to find the Ultrapods before [[Emil Eagle]] and his Bad-7, there also were two civilians given new superhero identities for this mission. One of them was Gus who got the Iron Gus armor (the other was [[Gladstone]]).

In the episode in which he appears, Iron Gus fights against [[John D. Rockerduck|Roller Dollar]], besting him, because during the struggle he had fallen asleep just above the 'Ultra-pod. Roller Dollar still manages to get the Ultrapod later (read below).

Iron Gus' appetite was a frequent source of trouble, as when he found and ate all of [[Super Goof]]'s Super Peanuts, which caused Super Goof to be temporarily unavailable for some missions, or when [[John D. Rockerduck|Roller Dollar]] had a lawyer robot close an icecream shop, so Iron Gus got distracted "saving" the ice creams from being dumped while Roller Dollar retrieved an Ultrapod.

==Trivia==
*For the name "Iron Gus" the authors were inspired by the legendary Marvel superhero [[Iron Man]].
