==History==
Kyoko Yoshiko is [[Nakasumi]]'s translator. She is always by his side, and knows a lot about his operations. [[Kim Possible|Kim]] first met Yoshiko when [[Dr. Drakken]] stole a video game factory from Nakasumi in order to build a giant robot. Yoshiko and Nakasumi helped Kim the second time by providing transportation to [[England]] for a mission to find [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]]. Kim met Yoshiko the third time to foil Nakasumi's kidnapping. It was at this meeting that it was revealed that Nakasumi could speak English very fluently; but liked to whisper to Kyoko, she say's it's because he is a bit "wacky."
