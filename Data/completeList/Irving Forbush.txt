'''Irving Forbush''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', [[The Defenders (TV series)|The Defenders]], and [[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]], played by the lateÂ [[Stan Lee]] (who created the character alongside [[Jack Kirby]]). A rather goofy and silly man, he always wanted to be a superhero, but lacked the skills or powers to be one, so he decided to become a police officer. Soon enough, he climbed ranks until he became captain of the New York City Police Department. His kind and gentle nature means that the residents of [[New York]] speak of him fondly.

==Trivia==
*This is Lee's only cameo in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], in which he portrays a character, adapted from the [[Marvel Comics|comics]] (though ironically, he doesn't make a physical appearance).
