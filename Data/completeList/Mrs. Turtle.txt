|quote = "HEY, [[Donald Duck|DUCK]]!"|alignment = Neutral}}'''Mrs. Turtle''' is a green turtle that first appeared in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''. She can be overprotective of her son [[Baby Shelby]] and will often yell if she can't find him, or if she gives someone an order.

==Appearances==
===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===
Mrs. Turtle made her debut in the cartoon [[Donald's Shell Shots]] where she lets Donald take a photo of Baby Shelby at the mall. However, Baby Shelby only causes Donald lots of trouble to take his picture. Mrs. Turtle will later go on to leave Baby Shelby at Donald's care unexpectedly, which will then again make Shelby one of Donald's advisories. She can also sometimes get impatient with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] in the cartoon "[[Babysitters]]". Mrs. Turtle made a cameo in "[[Daisy's Big Sale]]", attending Daisy's hairbow party.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Mrs. Turtle makes an appearance with her son in the ''House of Mouse'' episode "[[Mickey vs. Shelby]]" where she left Shelby in Mickey's care. Unfortunately, Mickey has a very difficult time trying to catch Shelby and getting him on stage. Near the end of the episode, after Mickey held an xylophone performance with Shelby, Mrs. Turtle decided to leave Shelby in Donald's care, much to Donald's dismay.

==Trivia==
*Like [[King Leonidas]]Â from ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', Mrs. Turtle has a very loud yell (only when she gets agitated if someone can't find Baby Shelby); but not as strong as King Leonidas'.
*It is never mentioned whether she is married or not. It is possible that she is a single mother.
