===Season One===

====Relationship with Walter====
Despite her excellence, Lahela finds it difficult resonating with her crush, Walter Taumata. Despite her affection for him, she finds it difficult to converse with him romantically, and despite their numerous dates, struggles to secure him as her boyfriend.

Lahela talks with Steph about her problems, and Steph suggests that she will know they are serious if he posts a photograph of her on his main Instagram. Lahela tries to secure this, but finds that Walter pulls away. After Walter suffers an appendicitis, Lahela is forced to perform surgery on him and finds that he becomes even more withdrawn. Lahela believes that Walter no longer has feelings for her, but he eventually reveals that he felt weak after she had to operate on him. The two clear this up and Walter posts a photograph of the two on his main Instagram.

Lahela's relationship with Walter is tested once more when he reveals that he will be spending the summer in Australia on a Surfing Tournament. Lahela is saddened at the idea of spending the summer apart and applies to be part of the medical team. She is accepted, but finds it difficult to convince her parents to let her go. This ends with an argument with Clara in which she leaves her position at the hospital.

Lahela tells Walter that she has left the hospital and he tells her that he cannot allow her to give up her passion for him. Walter tells her that he will instead go on the tour the following year and spend the summer with her. After thinking it over, Lahela tells him that he must pursue the tournament and that she will be there when he returns.

====Finding a new path====
When Clara begins her race for Chief Resident, she advices Lahela to run for Chief Resident, and the two talk about the partnership they could have if they both got their roles. Lahela becomes sidetracked, however, when Dr. Goldstein visits the hospital and reveals that he will give one doctor a fellowship. Lahela becomes intent on winning the fellowship but is eventually disqualified due to her age.

After an emergency, however, when Lahela is able to show her abilities, Dr. Goldstein offers her the fellowship. Whilst she considers it, she decides to turn him down to pursue the role of Chief Resident like her mother before her.
