It seems that throughout the entire series, they never left their certain area (possibly F.O.W.L. headquarters). Also, they were always hidden in the shadows and their true names were never mentioned during the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' series run at all.

The ones that usually talked were the one in the middle with a big head and fangs, and the one with a hunched back. The one wearing the over sized hat never talked. It also appears that they were anthropomorphic birds.

All members of F.O.W.L. are shown to fear them, as they appear to be prone to violently dispose of those who upset them, including [[Steelbeak]]'s predecessor, who was put through six trash compactors.
==Trivia==
*In the 2017 reboot of ''DuckTales'', the leadership of F.O.W.L. is assumed by the [[Board of Directors]], who are also the financial advisors of McDuck Enterprises.
