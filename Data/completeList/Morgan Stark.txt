{{Quote|I love you 3000.|Morgan to [[Iron Man|Tony]]|Avengers: Endgame}}
'''Morgan Stark''' is the daughter of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Pepper Potts]].

Morgan Stark was created by Don Heck and Al Hartley.

==Background==
===Biography===
Morgan was born after Thanos snapped half of the Universe's population into dust. She was named after Pepper's uncle.

Morgan grew up in Tony Stark's new residence far away from civilization, off the grid with her father and mother. All of them lived a happy life after the Decimation.

She attended Tony’s funeral with her mother, Pepper, and cried into her arms at the sight of her father's grave.

After the funeral, she sat with Happy Hogan, telling him she wanted a cheeseburger due to being hungry. After Happy points out that Tony loved burgers, he said he would give her as many as she wanted.

==Trivia==
*In the original comics Morgan was Tony Stark's cousin.
*In a deleted scene, after snapping his fingers, Tony was to visit the Soulworld and meet an older version of Morgan who would forgive him before his death. The scene was omitted because test audiences had no emotional resonance with the older Morgan.
*She was going to appear in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', but her role was cut from the film for unknown reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-cameo-tony-stark-daughter/|title=No Way Home Almost Included Tony Stark’s Daughter|website=ScreenRant|date=[[December 19]], [[2021]]}}</ref>
