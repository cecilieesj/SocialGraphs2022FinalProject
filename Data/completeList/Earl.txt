|alignment = Good}}'''Earl''' is one of the "Dragon Time" puppets from ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Puppetman Puppetman]''. He was puppeteered by [[w:c:muppet:Richard Hunt|Richard Hunt]] while [[w:c:muppet:Del Zivic|Del Zivic]] does his character and the character was designed by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Ron_Mueck Ron Mueck] and built by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Caroly_Wilcox Caroly Wilcox] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jitka_Exler Jitka Exler]. A goofy purple and pink dragon with buck teeth, Earl is the klutzy sidekick to [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Butane Butane]. In the initial "Dragon Time" sketch, Earl argues with Butane over who gets to pull the castle bell, and takes a pratfall as a result. Offstage, Earl is often used by his puppeteer [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Del_Zivic Del] to avoid answering people, providing dumb remarks for him. In opposition to the sharp-tongued, bile-filled [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Gertha Gertha], Earl represents the goofy, playful side of Del.

Earl is a [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Hand-Rod_Muppet Hand-Rod Muppet], allowing Del (and by extension, Richard Hunt) to perform him and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Gertha Gertha] at the same time. Earl receives third billing among the puppets in the "Dragon Time" credits within the show, behind Butane and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Candle Candle].

==Other appearances==
The Earl puppet was reused in the "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_103:_Monster_Telethon Monster Telethon]" episode of ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Jim_Henson_Hour The Jim Henson Hour]'' alongside the other "Dragon Time" puppets in a sequence involving a king who doesn't know how rule a kingdom that worked as a hat sharpener.

In the ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Ghost_of_Faffner_Hall Ghost of Faffner Hall]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_111:_Music_Brings_Us_Together Music Brings Us Together]", the puppet was used for the son of a tourist dragon family who played on sea shells with [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Steve_Turre?action=edit&redlink=1 Steve Turre]. Here, Earl is performed by an uncredited [[David Rudman]].

In the ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' episode, "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_323:_Read_My_Book Read My Book]", the puppet was used as a dragon in [[Tutter]]'s favorite book, "[[Mousey the Great]]".

Earl was later used in various roles on ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mopatop%27s_Shop Mopatop's Shop]'' like the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Dream_Collector?action=edit&redlink=1 Dream Collector] in "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_265:_Dream_the_Dream Dream the Dream]".

Several years later, it was used again in the ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street Sesame Street]'' PSA "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Don%27t_Forget_to_Watch_the_Movie Don't Forget to Watch the Movie]", to demonstrate that smoking is not allowed in movie theaters.
