==Story==
He traveled a lot and looked for the Mark of the Ragorlang, a mark that Ragorlangs live in the eyes of their victims, using a special outfit and a magic box he created to trap the monsters inside it. He move to Heatherfield as the doctor in the girls institute. Initially helps the Guardians against Tecla, but in the end, he merged with the monsters trapped inside his magic box and wanted to drain the energy of every human being on Earth. Folkner is defeated by W.I.T.C.H., who, with the advice of Tecla, combine their powers along with the box to create a power beam of magic light to suck back all the Ragorlangs, including Folkner himself into the box, where they remained trapped forever.
