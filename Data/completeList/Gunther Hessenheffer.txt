[[File:Gunther Hessenheffer Season 2.png|thumb|248px|right]]'''Gunther Hessenheffer''' is a main character on ''[[Shake It Up]]'' in which he dances on the local teen dance show, Shake It Up, Chicago!. He is the son of [[Kashlack Hessenheffer|Kashlack]] and [[Squitza Hessenheffer]], and the fraternal twin brother of [[Tinka Hessenheffer]]. He lives in an apartment with his family in Chicago, Illinois and attends [[John Hughes High School]] with fellow ''Shake It Up, Chicago!'' dancers [[Rocky Blue]] and [[CeCe Jones]]. He has been an exchange student since the first grade and was born in a European country that has never been addressed by name, but referred to many times. Gunther is portrayed by [[Kenton Duty]].

==History ==
Gunther was born in a small unnamed mountain country in Eastern Europe with his fraternal twin sister, [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Tinka_Hessenheffer Tinka]. His mother, [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Squitza_Hessenheffer Squitza Hessenheffer], was a princess in their country until her father dethroned her for marrying a commoner, [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Kashlack_Hessenheffer Kashlack]. Gunther came to America with his family when he was a child. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Add_It_Up Add It Up]", Tinka revealed that they flew to Chicago on a business class flight. He and his twin sister were enrolled as exchange students since the 1st grade in elementary school, where he met [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/CeCe_Jones CeCe Jones] and [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Rocky_Blue Rocky Blue]. He moved on with his sister and classmates to [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/John_Hughes_High_School John Hughes High School]. When he was 13-years-old in the 8th grade, he auditioned for the local teen dance show, ''[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Shake_It_Up,_Chicago! Shake It Up, Chicago!]'' and passed, becoming one of the newest teen background dancers. In the third season, Gunther goes back to his unnamed country so Kenton Duty is leaving the show but he will continue to be a guest star.

==Personality==
Gunther is described as a flamboyant, fashionable, unique, weird, theatrical, and ambitious dancer on ''Shake It Up, Chicago!''. He is from a fictional country that has not been mentioned by name, but is often referred to by the twins as they differentiate American traditions from their own. His taste in attire is loud and catchy and celebrates his love of performing. No matter how popular he thinks he is, he doesn't have many friends and most of them are frenemies. It is revealed in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Show_It_Up Show It Up]" that he and his sister have musical abilities as they performed two popular songs from their country with Gunther on the guitar. It is shown that he and Tinka both have sock puppets they make outfits for and call "Little Gunther" and "Little Tinka", first introduced in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Hot_Mess_It_Up Hot Mess It Up]". Even though he is shown to be arrogant, he can be bothered by the opinion of others, as shown in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Show_It_Up Show It Up]" when Candy and Randy made fun of their accents, and in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Shrink_It_Up Shrink It Up]" when [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Gary_Wilde Gary Wilde] calls them out for always being mean. They attempt to be nice and pick Deuce to try it out on. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Vatalihootsit_It_Up Vatalihootsit It Up]", he and Tinka invite CeCe and Rocky to their home to celebrate Vatalihootsit Day, a holiday where you celebrate your enemies. There are many strange rituals they perform. Their parents turn out to be even more strange than Gunther and Tinka and they are revealed to be royalty; their mother was a princess until she was dethroned for marrying a commoner. Their parents tell CeCe and Rocky, that they know Gunther and Tinka are not "well liked at school" and that their coming "meant the world" to the twins.

==Relationships With Other Characters==
===Tinka Hessenheffer (Twin Sister)===
Gunther and Tinka are fraternal twins and best friends who spend most of their time with each other. They are also dance partners on ''Shake It Up, Chicago''. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Add_It_Up Add It Up]", Tinka feels lonely, wanting a boy to like her after always seeing couples act affectionately towards each other. Gunther offers to take her out on a date, but Tinka states that she wants a "real date". Gunther looks shocked and horrified when Tinka points out that "it's not like we're going to grow up and get married!" The first time they are not seen together is in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Heat_It_Up Heat It Up]". They often wear flashy matching clothes, sided with Glitter and Sequins, and they are shown to have musical abilities, singing two songs ([http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/A_Goat_for_Christmas A Goat for Christmas] and [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Your_Uncle_is_a_Werewolf Your Uncle is a Werewolf]) together for the school talent show in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Show_It_Up Show It Up]". It is revealed that they take care of their little cousin [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Klaus_Hessenheffer Klaus Hessenheffer] in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Auction_It_Up Auction It Up]" and "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Judge_It_Up Judge It Up]". In [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Made_in_Japan Made in Japan], their closeness is formally revealed when [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Tinka_Hessenheffer Tinka] is arrested and almost deported. Gunther is extremely upset over it and seems like he was having anxiety at the thought of being separated from his sister for even a couple of days.

===Rocky Blue (Frenemy)===
Rocky is a "frenemy" of Gunther's, fellow ''Shake It Up, Chicago!'' dancer, and schoolmate. They don't often get along and like to throw insults at each other, but they can be friendly at times. Rocky agreed for her and CeCe to go to his house for Vatalihootsit Day ("[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Vatalihootsit_It_Up Vatalihootsit It Up]"), where he says he thinks she's the smartest girl in their school. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Show_It_Up Show It Up]", she asks him and his sister Tinka to join her team to defeat Candy Cho, until he leaves to join Candy's group. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Break_It_Up Break It Up]", they are seated together and her cast shows Gunther's signature. He thinks she is some sort of "witch" in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Kick_It_Up Kick It Up]". He helps her with her modeling in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Model_It_Up Model It Up]". In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Split_It_Up Split It Up]", Rocky is jealous of CeCe and Gunther dancing on ''Good Morning Chicago'' and initially accepts Tinka's help to get CeCe sick so she can't dance on the show.

===CeCe Jones (Frenemy; Ex-Girlfriend; Main Love Interest; Crush) ===
CeCe is a "frenemy" of Gunther's, fellow dancer on ''Shake It Up! Chicago'', and classmate at John Hughes High. The two don't often get along and like to throw insults at each other although later in the show (mainly Season 2) they seem to be more comfortable around each other. Rocky forced CeCe to ask him to the school dance. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Hot_Mess_It_Up Hot Mess It Up]" when they thought that he was about to move back to the "old country". Though he acted very sweet to her, in the end, Gunther dumped CeCe. They can be friends at times, as seen in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Model_It_Up Model It Up]" when CeCe had been working with Gunther (off-screen) as her modelling coach. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Split_It_Up Split It Up]", they are selected by [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Gary_Wilde Gary Wilde] to be guest dancers on ''Good Morning, Chicago''. Kenton Duty, who plays Gunther, has acknowledged the pairing in his interviews and has given away hints for a GeCe centric episode, "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Split_It_Up Split It Up]", before it aired. In [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Reality_Check_It_Up Reality Check It Up] on True Teen Life, they made it seem like CeCe likes Gunther. It is also shown in this episode that Gunther has a crush on CeCe as he kept on flirting with her. In[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Surprise_It_Up Surprise It Up] he and CeCe go to a mailman's funeral together, and later on in the episode Gunther shows up at her birthday party. Seeing as Tinka and CeCe are now friends, Gunther and CeCe may become friends and get closer.

===Deuce Martinez===
They have talked several times, but are not apparently close. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Add_It_Up Add It Up]", Deuce bets Gunther that he can beat him in arm wrestling, but to his and Ty's surprise Gunther slams Deuce easily. Gunther beats him in all the re-matches Deuce demands, winning all his clothes (when Deuce is seen walking home, he glares at Rocky and CeCe, who were mocking him, and states "You're just lucky I won back my underwear.") Gunther and Tinka like to pick on Deuce, as seen in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Shrink_It_Up Shrink It Up]". Gunther calls him "Deucey". Gunther tried being nice to Deuce in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Shrink_It_Up Shrink It Up]".

===Ty Blue===
Ty is a schoolmate and frenemy of Gunther's. Sometimes they don't get along, due to Ty thinking Gunther is weird and unusual. For the most part, they are friends and Ty gets along with Gunther more than anyone else on the show besides Tinka. In "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Age_It_Up Age It Up]", they were involved in a subplot similar to "[[wikipedia:My_Fair_Lady|My Fair Lady]]", where Ty tried to make Gunther more "hip" after seeing him get rejected by Gunther's crush, [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Danielle Danielle]. He succeeded, turning Gunther into a "cool" guy called "G" by making over his appearance and attitude. When Danielle accepted Gunther's offer for a date, Ty offered to get a pizza with him to celebrate, which Gunther didn't accept because he thought he was too good for Ty. They made up by the end of the episode. They also played a few friendly games of ping pong in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Camp_It_Up Camp It Up]" and got back at Flynn together in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Egg_It_Up Egg It Up]".

===[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Flynn_Jones Flynn Jones]===
Gunther was introduced to Flynn when he babysat him with Tinka in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Meatball_It_Up Meatball It Up]". Flynn takes advantage of the fact that they come from a foreign country, making up many things babysitters do in America. He watched him again when they were left behind by everyone else while Rocky was rushed to the hospital ("[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Break_It_Up Break It Up]"), and also in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Egg_It_Up Egg It Up]" when Flynn fired Ty as his babysitter. They appear to get along well while Gunther takes over as his babysitter, dressing up like rock stars and performing together. Gunther and Ty worked together to get back at Flynn for using the both of them in the same episode.

===Danielle===
Danielle was Gunther's crush in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Add_It_Up Add It Up]". Gunther followed Ty's advice to change everything about himself to impress her. He succeeded in asking her out, but she dumped him when he defended Tinka after Danielle called Tinka a reject and said she couldn't hang out with them unless she changed like Gunther did. He refused and ditches her, changing back to how he was and making up with Tinka.
