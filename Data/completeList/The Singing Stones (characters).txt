==History==
The Singing Stones are a family of Moai like creatures that inhabit the Singing Stone Isle living in peace. How exactly the Singing Stones were cursed was never explained in the series. The only means that can restore the Singing Stones family bodies is the glow of [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]]'s comet which is said to pass their island home.

==Appearances==

===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
The Singing Stones first appeared in [[The Singing Stones (episode)|the episode of the same name]]. While sailing the open Never Sea various islands [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew overhear singing coming from a near by island were they meet the singing stones family. The Singing Stones explain they desperately need to return to their home on Singing Stones Island on time before Peter Pan's comet arrives or they will never end their curse. Jake and his young pirate friends agreed to help by tying the small island to [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] and began towing the island. Unaware [[Captain Hook]] was spying on them, Hook refuse to allow the puny pirate to have another island and was determined to claim the Singing Stones island for himself. Jake and his crew try to intervene explaining the situation to Hook, but the greedy pirate refuse to give up his island paradise as plant his flag into the tiny island removing a chunk of island with Little Sister stranded on it.

Jake and his crew soon race to Little Sister aid, but they couldn't move the massive Moai. Recalling that Little Sister song cause the Singing Stones to become separated from their island home they inform her to sing once more freeing her Captain Hook's [[The Jolly Roger|ship]]. With Little Sister free from Hook's grasp [[Izzy]] quickly uses her [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] to reunite the young Singing Stone with her family and later on the island and Bucky allowing Jake and his crew to soar the rest of the way foiling Hook's attempt to regain control of the island. Finally, Jake and his crew reach Singing Stone's home just in time for the family to bath in the glow of Peter Pan's comet restoring the Singing Stones body once more. The Singing Stones are last seen singing and dancing, celebrating the return of their bodies with Jake and his friends.
