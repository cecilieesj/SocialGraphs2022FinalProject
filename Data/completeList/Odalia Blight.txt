{{Quote|We can shout as loud as we want. But money always shouts louder.|Emira on Odalia|Clouds on the Horizon}}
'''Odalia Blight''' is [[Amity Blight|Amity]], [[Emira and Edric Blight|Emira and Edric's]] mother and [[Alador Blight|Alador's]] wife in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Odalia is a middle-aged woman with pale skin, pointy ears, two-tone mint green hair in a bun, blue eyes and wears dark purple lipstick and black nail polish. She wears a purple blouse, a white vest with trios of intersecting pink crystal balls, dark teal pants, two-tone gray laced boots, golden earrings, and a magenta amulet around her neck.

When she was younger, she strongly resembled Amity, only with with natural green hair. In her Hexside School of Magic and Demonics uniform, is purple sleeves and leggings as a member Oracle track uniform, two-tone black boots. 

==Role in the series==
===Season One===
Odalia first appeared alongside her husband as silhouettes in "[[Understanding Willow]]". After Amity accidentally setting [[Willow Park|Willow's]] memories on fire, she and Luz were forced to go into her mind to repair them. They encountered Willow's "inner" self, who wanted to attack Amity. Before she could finish her off, Amity revealed the truth as to why she ended her friendship with her. Her parents did not want her to continue being friends with Willow due to their desire of keeping up their reputation. They arranged for [[Boscha]] and Skara, children of their coworkers, to be her new friends, and threatened to ensure that Willow would never be able to attend [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics|Hexside]] if she did not end her friendship with her.

Odalia is seen again in a flashback among the crowd watching [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]]'s witches duel in "[[Young Blood, Old Souls]]".

==Trivia==
*Odalia's name is originated from the Germanic name odalys, which means "wealth". This fits her, as the Blight family is very affluent.
*According to a Reddit AMA hosted by [[Dana Terrace]], Mr. Blight has brown hair and shares this with Amity, while Odalia's hair is green, the same as Emira and Edric's<ref name="hair">[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOwlHouse/comments/ill21i/hooty_hooty_im_dana_terrace_creator_and_ep_of_the/g3symor/ Dana Terrace's AMA (September 2, 2020)]</ref>
**The same comment also stated that Odalia had Amity dye her hair green because she likes her children to be "color-coordinated".
