A '''Palisman''' is a magical toten that sits on top of a witch's staff in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''. They serve as a witch's familiar, as well as both a loyal friend and and a powerful tool.

==Background==
Palismen are regarded as objects rather than a living creatures. They are equivalents of a familiar while also acting as magical staves that house their own source of power outside a witch's bile sac. Despite this, palismem are independent, sapient entities capable of having consciousness and detaching themselves from their staffs and act freely, though still subservient to the witches who own them. Every palisman has their own unique interlock that mate to only their own staffs and no other.

The bond between witches and palismen are built on a relationship of affection and mutual respect. If that relationship were to be broken in anyway, through either mistreatment or abandonment, a palisman will forever lose all loyalty and respect for its owner, unless they earn it back. Previously owned palismen can also become the partner of a new witch whom they find to be worthy.

Traditionally, witches in their teens would carve their own palismen from palistrom wood. However, palistrom trees have become an increasingly rare resource and the ones that are left are heavily guarded. As a result, a system of palisman adoption was established by [[Principal Bump]] and the [[Bat Queen]]. During this process, a young witch would step forward and speak their greatest ambitions, and if a palisman is compatible with the emotion of that ambition, they will step forward to meet their new partner.
