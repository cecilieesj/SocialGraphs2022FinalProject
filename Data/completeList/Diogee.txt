{{Quote|Diogee, go home!|[[Milo Murphy]]}}
'''Diogee Ex Machina Murphy '''is [[Milo Murphy|Milo]]'s dog in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]''.

==Appearance==
Diogee is a small dog with a slightly rounded body and a small tail. He is primarily colored cream, with a spot on his back and his nose being brown. He also has brown freckles on his snout.

==Trivia==
*Diogee resembles Paw Pooch from "Krypto the Superdog".
*Diogee's name is pronounced the same as the letters "D-O-G", which spell "dog", the species Diogee belongs to.
*Diogee is one quarter llama dog, which according to Milo means he can herd llamas like a sheepdog can herd sheep. ("It just doesn't come up very often.") Diogee can also understand Spanish, having attended at least one of Milo's Spanish classes in school.
*His middle name is "Ex Machina", which most likely comes from the Latin phrase "[[Wikipedia:Deus ex machina|deus ex machina]]", which has come to mean a plot device that suddenly (even abruptly) solves a problem.
**Coincidentally, the first three letters of his name "Dio" (as in "'''''D-i-o'''-g-e-e''") are forming an Italian word, which came from the Latin "deus".
