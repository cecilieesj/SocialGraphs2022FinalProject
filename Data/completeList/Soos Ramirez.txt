'''Jesus "Soos" Alzamirano Ramirez'''<ref>[http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/zzyin/im_michael_rianda_cartoonist_and_creative/c69amtk?context=3 Michael Rianda, creative director and writer on Gravity Falls, confirms Soos's name]</ref> is an awkward yet friendly young man and a major character in the animated series ''[[Gravity Falls]]''. He is one of the employees at [[the Mystery Shack]] gift (and souvenir) shop (throughout the events of the series). Sometimes he joins the adventure with [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines]].

==Background==
[[File:Soos_10_years_ago.png|thumb|250px|Young Soos.]]
Soos was the second Mystery Shack employee and has worked there since he was twelve years old after the old handyman got thrown out, literally, for "not doing how to fix anything". He is very dear to the Shack since he never gets upset at Stan no matter what he does.
===Disney Bio===
:''Soos is the loveable man-child who works at the Mystery Shack. He is super friendly and likes being in the center of attention.''

===Personality===
[[File:S1e12 soos and skulls.png|thumb|250px|Soos plays with the cackling skulls.]]
Soos is a portly, friendly, lovable, true talking, and bumbling employee whose desire to be where the action makes him an excellent resource for the Dipper and Mabel when they need a ride about town. Aside from the kids, he is one of the only people who sees and believes all the strange things happening in [[Gravity Falls (location)|Gravity Falls, Oregon]], such as in Tourist Trapped when he says he is always noticing weird stuff in Gravity Falls, and other episodes. He frequently shows his eager, inquisitive, and childish nature. He has good relationships with Dipper and Mabel, though Dipper can be irritated by him at times. He is also very humorous. He is addicted to pressing the cackling skulls at the Summerween Superstore and believes that the inflatable ducks from the pool can talk. This proves he's very childish and naive. However, as Bill Cipher observes in 'Dreamscaperers', Soos is smarter than he appears.

===Physical Appearance===
[[File:S1e11_Soos_Without_Cap.png|thumb|250px|Soos without his cap.]]Soos wears a brown cap, has light peach, fair skin, and has buck teeth, similar to those of a beaver. He wears dark brown shoes, beige shorts and a jade green shirt with a big question mark on the front and the word "Staff" on the back, which is most likely from [[The Mystery Shack]]. He also has a double chin and appears as if he hasn't shaven recently. He has short light brown hair that is styled similar to Grunkle Stan's, which is shown in "Little Dipper." His neck is wider than his head, or so it appears. It could also be considered that he has no neck, given that he appears to have a double chin, and what looks like his neck could just be his other chin. He is also quite chubby.
==Appearances==

=== ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' ===

==== [[Gravity Falls episode list|Season 1]] ====
Soos is first seen working in the Mystery Shack. When Dipper confides in him that Norman may be a zombie, Soos tells him that he believes him and that he's always noticing weird things in the town, like his belief that the mailman is a werewolf because he is very hairy. He also tells him that everyone will think he is a weirdo if Dipper doesn't have any proof. When Dipper finds out Norman was actually a "zombie", he hops into the [[Mystery Cart]] but before [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] drives away, Soos comes and gives him a shovel for the zombies and a bat in case he encounters any piñatas.

Soos' next appearance is at Lake Gravity Falls, as Dipper and Mabel are deciding they want to look for the [[Gobblewonker]]. He pulls up with a better boat than [[Stan Pines|Stan's]], the [[S.S. Cool Dude]], offering to help the kids look for the monster. They accept his offer, riding with him to Scuttlebutt Island. Along the way, he destroys several of the many cameras that Dipper brought. He even nominates himself to be Associate Co-Captain. When they arrive at the island, he goes with Dipper and Mabel to look for the beast, making jokes along the way. The group spots what appears to be the Gobblewonker; however, it is only a colony of beavers. He then takes pictures of the beavers, before the real Gobblewonker arrives. He is chased by the creature, along with Dipper and Mabel, until they are able to trap it in a cave behind a waterfall. There, he loses his shirt and the kids discover that it is not a beast, but a machine created by [[Old Man McGucket]]. McGucket then tells the kids that they are the real monsters, and goes to Grunkle Stan's boat, where he, Soos and the kids spend an evening of fishing and taking pictures together.

[[File:S1e4_alternate_soos.png|thumb|250px|Soos meets his Tent of Telepathy counterpart, Deuce.]]
In "[[Headhunters]]", he shows Dipper and Mabel the Mystery Shack's old wax museum. He later directs the twins toward [[Manly Dan]]. He later appears in [[The Hand That Rocks the Mabel]]. Soos is seen watching Tiger Fist with Dipper and Mabel, he then brings the twins to the [[Tent of Telepathy]] with him. In [[The Inconveniencing]], he works in the gift shop and advises [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] and the twins not to go onto the roof. In [[Dipper vs. Manliness]], Soos helps Mabel help Stan shape by dressing up as [[Lazy Susan]] for a practice run and by helping judging Stan's appearance.

[[File:S1e7 soos with crown contest start.png|thumb|250px|DJ Soos announces the party crown contest.]]
When Grunkle Stan decides to set up a party at the Mystery Shack, he allowed Soos to become DJ (only because he begged and that he works for free). Soos even got a book that teaches you how to DJ, telling Stan he won't regret his decision. Soos hosts the party crown dance competition, which is a contest where whoever dances the best will get the party crown. The only competitors are Mabel and [[Pacifica Northwest]], although Pacifica managed to beat Mabel by bribing [[Old Man McGucket]] to applaud for her. During Pioneer Day, Soos apparently saw Grunkle Stan trapped in a wooden stock, and, according to Stan, talked to him for an hour.

[[File:S1e9 soos and blendin.png|thumb|250px|Soos and Blendin Blandin at the Mystery Fair.]]
In "[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]", Stan makes Soos rig the Dunk Tank at the Mystery Fair by making the seat connected to the target very stiff, making it impossible to make Stan fall into the water just by throwing balls. When Stan says nothing will knock him down, Soos says maybe a "future arm cannon gun thing" will (which actually happens later in the episode). When Stan wonders where his red screwdriver went, Soos says maybe a "paranormal thing" took it. Stan doesn't believe him, saying he must be spending too much time with Dipper and Mabel. However, Soos was right again; the guy who stole Stan's screwdriver was a time traveler. Later when [[Blendin Blandin]] rode one of the rides Dipper suggested to him, Soos told him he shouldn't ride with his time machine, saying it can "fly off and accidentally fix something". Blendin told Soos to watch over it, but Dipper and Mabel effortlessly stole the time machine away from Soos, who wasn't even looking at the device.

In "[[Fight Fighters]]", he introduces the Pines to the Arcade and shows them some games he likes. He is later seen playing poker with Chipackerz with them at the Mystery Shack. When they hear Robbie playing his guitar, he thinks that he is picking up a radio station through his ear, and Mabel suggests him to blink to change the channel. When Dipper notices it is Robbie, Soos puts in that he called him "Big Dude" once. When Stan gives Dipper a choice on when Robbie forced him to go to a fight at Circle Park, and Dipper chooses to be a wimp, Soos tells Dipper he should just forget about Robbie. He soon is playing Nort and wonders what it is like to get stuck inside a video game. He soon unscrews part of the machine and goes in, and scares someone at the arcade about to play the game. Later, he asks [[Dipper Pines]] if he needs a sidekick with a car, and tries to shrink [[Rumble McSkirmish]]'s health. In the credits, he has a dream that everything is 8-bit and he is a Pac-Man-like head that eats Dipper, Mabel, Stan, and Wendy. When he wakes up he seems to fall back asleep and have the same dream.

[[File:S1e11 soos.png|thumb|250px|A shrunken Soos in the carpet.]]
In "[[Little Dipper]]", After Dipper and Mabel are done with chess, Soos needs help with reaching something, so he asks Mabel but Dipper says he can do. Although Soos just measures them both and Mabel turns out to be 1 millimeter taller. When Mabel and Stan make fun of Dipper because of that millimeter, Soos says, "Dude you should lay off a tiny bit." So Stan takes that like Soos was in on the joke. Later on, Soos is setting up the mirror maze and apparently, Stan is going to take his idea and credit for himself. When Stan looks at himself in the mirror he takes off his hat and then the phone rings so Stan leaves his hat and goes to answer while answering, Soos picks up his hat and tries it on. There we learn that Soos wants to be the owner of the Mystery Shack someday. So when Gideon comes in the Mystery Shack he sees Stan's fez hat and thinks it's Stan but it's actually Soos, so Soos is shrunk and put in a jar with Mabel and Dipper. When Gideon wants to know where Stan actually is Soos accidentally gives it away, so when Gideon is in the maze Soos, Mabel, and Dipper get out of the jar and are on Gideon's neck, while Soos is making "fat angel" Gideon thinks he is a termite and knocks him off his shoulder and Soos falls into a rug and finds his lost corn chip, so he then eats it. After Mabel and Dipper turn back to real size they destroy the crystal, not remembering that Soos is still shrunken.

[[File:S1E12 Candy Haul.png|thumb|250px|Soos, Dipper, Mabel, Candy Chiu, and Grenda with a wheelbarrow full of candy.]]
In "[[Summerween]]", Soos tells Mabel and Dipper the story of the [[Summerween Trickster]] before they go trick-or-treating as a warning, and he says the Trickster eats children alive if they lack the Summerween spirit. The twins don't worry about it because they have plenty of Summerween spirit for trick-or-treating. However, they both encounter the Summerween Trickster, who says if they give 500 pieces of candy to him before the last jack o' melon goes out, he will spare their lives. Soos joins the twins, along with Mabel's friends, [[Candy Chiu]], and [[Grenda]], and the gang goes through the town collecting candy. Soos left to get the car once they finally collected 499 pieces of candy, but Dipper accidentally spills all of them into a creek. The Summerween Trickster tries to eat the kids, but Soos comes with his car and unknowingly crashes through the Trickster, causing him to explode in a million pieces; but all of the pieces come together and rebuilds back into the Trickster's body. Soos drives the kids away from the Trickster, who begins chasing them, and he crashes into the Summerween Superstore.

[[File:S1E12 Soos in Gorilla suit.png|thumb|250px|Soos wants to play with the cackling skulls.]]
The gang successfully hides from the monster, but Soos was about to press one of the talking novelty skeleton heads he found earlier in the episode. The twins try to tell Soos not to touch it, but Soos found the talking skull entertaining, so he pressed it to enjoy himself. Thankfully, the toy was out of batteries, much to the twins' relief, but then Soos grabs two batteries and stores them in the skull, and the Trickster finds them because of the loud talking noise the skull made. The Trickster eats Soos and was about to eat the kids, but then Soos popped out of the monster's stomach, which was made out of candy. They learn that the Trickster is made out of the discarded candy no one eats, and he wants revenge on whoever throws them away, which is what Dipper had done earlier. The Trickster cries in joy after Soos said he tastes good, which was all the monster wanted to hear. Soos and the kids leave the store and watch a horror movie inside the Mystery Shack with Stan and Wendy for the remainder of the night.

In "[[Boss Mabel]]", when Soos enters Stan's office, he mistakes Mabel for Stan, and asks Mabel something, Soos is shocked after Mabel is done saying that Stan is no longer with us, and starts crying. Shortly after, Mabel reveals that she and Stan have made a bet to see who can make more money within 72 hours. Later on, Mabel has become too giving and has sent Soos on a nature walk in a question mark costume and Wendy off with her friends for the rest of the day. They then come together to make enough money before Stan comes back.

In "[[Bottomless Pit!]]", he, Stan, Mabel, and Dipper fall into a bottomless pit (rather boomerang pit) and pass the time by telling stories about voices, pinball, football, and being honest. He makes fun of Dipper's voice in "Voice Over", and even has a techno remix of it, until Dipper gets it changed, after which Soos initially thinks Dipper ought to be killed with fire. When it switches back to normal, Soos reconciles with Dipper. Soos' story involves his attempts to win Stan's creepy old pinball machine Tumbleweed Terror after four years of trying. At the suggestion of Dipper and Mabel, he tilts the machine to win and gains a high score. Soos considers this the greatest moment of his life (completely beating the last one, finding and eating a piece of pizza that fell from the VCR). The pinball machine is not amused, traps them all inside of it, and begins trying to kill them all. Soos, though distracted by the gorgeous pinball wench and the prospect of losing his high score, turns off the pinball machine and saves them. He then states he believes saving them all to be a great life accomplishment. After Mabel's story, the teeth get locked up in Mabel's "box of mysterious secrets" and the gang is spat out of the bottomless pit.

In "[[The Deep End]]", Soos joins the Pines family in their trip to the [[Gravity Falls Pool]]. While there, he is tricked by Dipper and Wendy into thinking that the inflatable duck rings are alive and becomes determined to save them. even sneaking into the pool at night to get them out.

In "[[Carpet Diem]]", Soos finds the hidden room that the twins fight over, though he tries to convince them that the attic is better. He later swaps bodies with [[Waddles]] due to the carpet's magic static electricity. He enjoys being a pig initially but ends up running for his life when McGucket decides that he wants to turn him into bacon. Meanwhile, Waddles as Soos flails about in his new human body and unknowingly ends up giving Soos a raise and a first girlfriend. In the end, once everyone has changed back to normal, Dipper eventually decides to give the secret room to Soos.

In "[[Boyz Crazy]]", Soos encounters Ergman Bratzman, who asks him if he had seen the boy band, Sev'ral Timez, anywhere. Soos implies that he did not see them. Soos then congratulates Gompers the Goat for eating Bratzman's car license plate (which later causes his arrest).

In "[[Land Before Swine]]", Soos assists Mabel and Dipper in rescuing Waddle from a Pterodactyl.

In "[[Dreamscaperers]]", Soos, Dipper, and Mabel (along with Xyler and Craz) enter Grunkle Stan's Mind to stop [[Bill Cipher]] from stealing the combination to the safe containing the deed to the Mystery Shack. In the episode, Soos is shown to be afraid of bats, or just their "weird little bat fingers." During their fight with Bill Cipher, Cipher points out that they're smart, "especially the fat one."

In "[[Gideon Rises]]", it is revealed that Soos has a grandmother who lives in Gravity Falls, and he and the Pines' family stay with her for a short amount of time after Gideon took over the shack. In addition, because he lost his job at the shack, he takes on various jobs as a replacement for his position at the Mystery Shack. These include being a cook at Greasy's Diner and a temporary bus driver. He joins the Pines' in their failed attempt to expose Gideon and is later seen helping to rebuild the recovered Mystery Shack.

==== [[Gravity Falls episode list|Season 2]] ====
In "[[Scary-oke]]", Soos takes part in the grand re-opening party of the Mystery Shack. When Dipper accidentally raises the dead back to life Soos gets bitten in the shoulder by a zombie. Soos joins his fellow zombies in chasing Dipper and Mabel until he gets distracted by something on TV. After Dipper, Mabel, and Stan destroy the zombies, Soos, while still a zombie, revealed he survived. Stan planned on attacking him until Dipper told him that there is a cure to turn Soos back to a human.

In "[[Into the Bunker]]", Soos, Dipper, Mabel, and Wendy went to investigate the author's hidden bunker in the forest. After entering a secret passage under a tree, a trap that makes the room close inactivates. They managed to unlock a secret door and escape into it, revealing a surveillance room. They eventually find out the Shape Shifter is inside the bunker, so they formulate a plan to stop the creature.

In "[[The Golf War]]", he joined the Pines family to play miniature golf. When Pacifica is challenged by Mabel at midnight, Soos stands guard while Mabel breaks in. Soos' weird shenanigans creep Stan out and later Soos sings a song while they bring Pacifica home.

In "[[Sock Opera]]", he finished the repairs to the Laptop he uncovered in the bunker and gave it to Dipper and Mabel. Soos also helps Mabel set up for her sock puppet show. Later, he watched the act in the crowd with Wendy, enjoying the act, but the show soon turned into a disaster.

In "[[Soos and the Real Girl]]", as a dear request from his grandmother, he tried to find a date to bring to his cousin Reggie's engagement party. Dipper and Mabel decided to help, bringing him to Gravity Malls. Despite his efforts, he makes a fool of himself each time he tries to ask a girl out. After spotting his cousin at the mall, he runs in shame into a video game store where he finds a video game called ''Romance Academy 7'' that can help him with his dating predicament. He takes it home and immediately plays it and seemingly connects with the game's digital girl, [[.GIFfany|GIFfany]], as he played all night and day, missing work for the first time ever according to Stan. Dipper and Mabel go to his house and force him to leave the game and come outside. While at the mall again, he still lucks out with talking to girls and runs into GIFfany who popped up on some screens. Though excited, he was confused about how that could be, to which she comments she's "special". Soos goes on a kid train with GIFfany who is electronically there with him but because his coin time was up, she was turned off. He soon meets a girl named [[Melody (Gravity Falls)|Melody]] and they immediately click. The two decide to go on a date at Hoo-Ha Owl's Pizzamatronic Jamboree that night. Mabel and Dipper congratulate him on getting a date, pointing out that he doesn't need that game anymore. Returning home, he talked to GIFfany about getting a date, which infuriated her, so he "turned" her off. While on his date enjoying himself he sees GIFfany appearing on the screens. GIFfany ends up taking control of the electronics in the place. People run in terror but before he, Melody, Dipper, and Mabel could leave they are shut in. Soos decides to put an end to this and gained GIFfany's attention on him only. He then burned her game disc, cutting off her connection and getting rid of her. He apologizes to Melody for the mess he got her into but she says this wasn't the worst date she ever had. Despite Melody moving away soon, she still said she'll be able to attend his cousin's engagement party with him and still be in a relationship with Soos, albeit long-distance.

===Other appearances===
[[File:Wax Museum 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Frog Soos (right) in ''Amphibia'' with Mr. Ponds.]]
A frog version of Soos simply named Frog Soos briefly appears in the [[Amphibia|''Amphibia'']] episode "[[Wax Museum]]".

Soos appears in ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]'' episode "[[Camping Trip (Star vs. the Forces of Evil)|Camping Trip]]".

==Relationships==
===[[Mabel Pines]]===
Soos and Mabel are good friends, brought together largely by their mutual love of humor and having fun. They like to goof around together, and they even have their own secret handshake. Soos accompanies Mabel and Dipper on many of their adventures in Gravity Falls—more so than any other individual.

===[[Dipper Pines]]===
Although Soos' childish antics get on Dipper's nerves from time to time, they have a close friendship. Soos sometimes acts as a role model for Dipper, offering the boy advice and doing "boyish" activities together, like blowing up hot dogs in the microwave. Soos serves as sidekick to Dipper and his sister on many occasions, being one of the only people aside from them to notice Gravity Falls' strange side on his own.

===[[Stan Pines]]===
As Stan's employee, Soos respects his boss and complies to his every request. With this submission and Soos' overall clueless nature, he tends to take advantage of Soos. Outside of work, they partake in various everyday activities together as friends.

===[[Wendy Corduroy]]===
As co-workers, Soos and Wendy spend enough time together to be on friendly terms. They are sometimes seen hanging out with one another and messing around, and Wendy likes to play pranks on Soos.

=== [[Melody (Gravity Falls)|Melody]] ===
Melody and Soos first met at Gravity Malls in "Soos and the Real Girl" and later that same night go out on a date. They get along remarkably well and are very compatible. Melody thinks it's admirable that Soos can do seemingly embarrassing and childish things without worrying about what other people think, and Soos is comforted by her warm and kind nature. They share a similar sense of humor, and while Melody had to go back to her home in Portland, they agree to try at a long distance relationship. During Dipper's monologue at the end of "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls", Melody is shown working at the Mystery Shack.
