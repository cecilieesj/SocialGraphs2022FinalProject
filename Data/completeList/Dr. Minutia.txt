'''Dr. Minutia''' is a one-shot villain on ''[[Teamo Supremo]]'', first mentioned in the episode "[[Calling Captain Excellent!]]" and later featured in the episode "[[Micro Supremo!]]" He is [[Captain Excellent]]'s archenemy, whose weapon of choice is his Reduct-o-Ray, which, as the name suggests, shrinks anyone zapped by it.

In his single appearance on the show, Dr. Minutia learns that Captain Excellent, who is currently off battling [[Big Skull]], has left his Hyper-Michronic Device at Level 7, so he plans to steal it. When Teamo attempts to stop him, he and his valet, Cosmo, shrink them with his Reduct-o-Ray. With Teamo detained, Minutia makes his way to the state capitol and also uses his Reduct-o-Ray on [[Governor Kevin]] and [[the Chief]]. However, he and Cosmo have a hard time finding the entrance to Level 7, to the point that Teamo manages to make it to the capitol and send in [[Captain Crandall|Crandall]]'s dog, [[Action]], to distract them. Before Minutia and Cosmo can figure it out, Teamo turns the Reduct-o-Ray on them.
