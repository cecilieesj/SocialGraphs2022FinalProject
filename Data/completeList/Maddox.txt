===Season Three===
====Happy Campers====
Maddox happily welcomes the Wildcats to Camp Shallow Lake as one of their cabin-mates and begins asking them about if they have drama to spill. Later she sings ''Shallow Lake'', a song about the camp, for the camper before the big surprise celebrity announcement.
====Into the Unknown ====
Maddox starts the morning off by waking up the campers with a bugle. During the auditions, after Gina gets nervous about EJ hugging Val Maddox happily explains their relationship to her. Later when Kourtney offers to help her with hair and makeup for the musical she rejects the offer, not realizing that Kourtney was trying to be friendly. When E.J. is struggling to find a way for them to finish the auditions without scripts, she suggests they do a dramatic reading of the song lyrics but, she brushes off her suggestion before Gina affirms her, saying that it's a great idea. That night she goes out to set something up in the woods while her cabin-mates gossip about her, with most of them calling her "a lot" and Gina defending her.
====The Woman in the Woods====
Maddox is excited to take the campers on their very first newbie initiation night, her favorite night of camp. That night she gets E.J. to sing ''The Ballad of Susan Fine''. After she begins telling the story of Shallow Lake and Susan Fine to scare the new campers. Instead of scaring them, Jet decided to make jokes, which everyone laughs at. Ignoring Maddox's story, she gets hurt and leaves the fire pit. Later that night Jet finds her again to apologize and she snaps on him revealing that they are siblings and that their parents made her keep an eye on him over the summer. She feels like she is the one being punished in the family for everything Jet has done.
====No Drama====
