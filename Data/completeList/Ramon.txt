He is shown to have amazing sporting ability, and is thus very popular with the girls at the school. [[Malina]] has a crush on him, which causes [[Kuzco]] to greatly dislike him. He is also afraid of clowns.

==Personality==
Ramon is very complimentary and appreciative. He always gives compliments (mostly toward girls) e.g. he said [[Yzma]] is the most beautiful woman. Ramon dislikes Kuzco; he even tried to kill him by pushing him in a scorpion arena. According to Yzma's sources, he is a treacherous double-crosser. Ramon has a crush on Malina.

==Trivia==
*Kuzco does not to know what country he is from. He mistakes him to be from other countries e.g. Germany, Australia and Sweden.
*He is most likely from Spain, the country which invaded the Inca Empire in 1532 A.D.Â This may mean that in the future Ramon may become a much greater threat to Kuzco.
*He may have been pretending to be afraid of clowns because after he went through the fun house and Malina comforted him he looked back at Kuzco with an accomplished look.
*Ramon once worked for Yzma.
*He lives in a canyon.
*In the final episode of the series, Ramon states that he is going to live in a hut and provide for himself solely by using his charm and good-looks.
