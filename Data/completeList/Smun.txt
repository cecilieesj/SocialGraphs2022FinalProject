'''Smun''' is a male Malayan porcupine who appears in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He serves as the leader of a prickle of porcupines who works for [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]].

==Background==

===Physical Appearance===
Smun has black fur, a gray belly, quills (just like what all porcupines have), and a large black nose. His ears are dark brown and his eyes are dark purple.

===Personality===
Smun is crafty, clever, and smart. He always tell all the animals of the forest to not say a word of [[Tuliza]] to make Mama Binturong frighten everyone away (a running gag in the episode ''[[Mama Binturong]]'').

He is loyal to Mama Binturong for her acting as a maternal figure to him and his Prickle, though his loyalty blinds him to Mama Binturong's truly uncaring nature.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Mama Binturong]]''===
Smun first appears when he overheard the [[Lion Guard]] saying "Tuliza". He then explains to Mama Binturong that all the Tuliza belongs to her as she reveals her true nature throughout the episode. He and the other porcupines are present during the [[You Best Not Mess With Mama|song Mama Binturong sings to the porcupines]]. Later when the Lion Guard tries to talk to a civet named [[Tompok]], Smun warns him that he and the other porcupines heard him say "Tuliza". When Mama Binturong scolds Tompok about her warning about Tuliza, Smun and the other porcupines prepare to impale the innocent civet but they stop when they hear [[Kion]] telling [[Bunga]] to avoid saying the word "Tuliza" as it can only either frighten the animals or cause Smun and the other porcupines to appear. Later when Smun talks to Mama Binturong after the situations with animals saying "Tuliza", she decides to face the Guard herself just as she tells the porcupines to take the [[Rafiki's Bakora Staff|staff]] Makini left behind to which Makini does not notice Smun and the other porcupines taking Makini's staff. Later when the Lion Guard is having a private conversation with [[Seisou]], the gibbon, he tells him the only private location he can talk about Tuliza and also the only place where no porcupine has ever heard an animal say "Tuliza" is in a cave.

Meanwhile at Stone Forest, Smun is later present during Mama Binturong's confrontation against Bunga where Smun and the other porcupines start attacking him to which Bunga was able to outsmart them in an attempt to get Makini's missing staff back. During battle, Bunga gets the missing staff just as Smun and the porcupines prepare to impale Bunga again as he uses his stench ability to defeat her and the other porcupines to get the Tuliza for Makini (also causing the pile of Tuliza to wither). With Mama Binturong foiled, Smun explains that his prickle will get more Tuliza for her to which she decides to take revenge against Bunga instead to which the porcupine talking to her tells her that the Stone Forest will never be the same without Mama Binturong as Bunga retrieves the missing staff and brings it back to Makini.

===''[[Triumph of the Roar]]''===
Smun and his prickle join [[Makucha's Army]] to add reinforcements to help [[Makucha]], [[Chuluun]], [[Ora]], and Mama Binturong in an attempt to take revenge against the Lion Guard and the [[Night Pride]] in a plan for Makucha and his army to eat the rare animals. Later when [[Ullu]] notices Makucha's army approaching the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]], Ullu tricks the porcupines using her head ability (the only ability owls would do) to fool them to which Smun decides to keep his encounter with the owl private.

Smun and the other members of Makucha's army later end up attacking the animals of the Tree of Life to which Kion was able to use the Power of the [[Roar of the Elders]] to defeat them by creating a tornado and send them far away from the Tree of Life to never be seen again.
