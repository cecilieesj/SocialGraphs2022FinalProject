'''Mrs. Macready''' is a character who appears in the [[2005]] Disney/Walden Media adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.

==Background==
Mrs. Macready is Professor Kirke's strict housekeeper. When she directs the Pevensies to the house, she lays out a few rules of being in their best behavior (I.E . keeping the historical artifacts in the Professor's house in prime condition and avoiding disturbing the Professor). When she met the Pevensies by the train station, she kindly gave the Pevensies a ride to the Professor's mansion just before laying out the ground rules.

==Role in the film==
As the Pevensies arrive at the Coombe Halt area, the four approach Mrs. Macready who escorts them to [[Professor Digory Kirke|Professor Kirke]]'s house, explaining to the children that the Professor is not accustomed to having children in this house just as Macready gives the Pevensies a few rules they need to follow. The Pevensies must refrain from shouting or running, any improper use of the dumbwaiter, or touching any historical artefacts inside and above all else, the Pevensies cannot disturb the Professor, as they begin to explore the inside of the Professor's mansion.

After [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] and [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] share their experience upon seeing [[Tumnus]] in Narnia and Edmund tells [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] and [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] that children don't know when to stop pretending, Lucy runs away in tears and approaches the Professor just as a flustered Macready storms in warning the children that they may have to sleep in the stables if they cause anymore disturbance. She's startled to see the Professor and tells him that she tried to warn the Pevensies not to disturb him, to which the Professor tells her to take care of Lucy.

Outside during a game of cricket, Edmund hits the ball which accidentally breaks a stained glass window of a coat of arms inside the Professor's house (also knocking down a suit of armor inside). Macready hears the commotion from downstairs as she prepares to scold the children for breaking the rules again. The Pevensies ended up hiding in the wardrobe arriving at Narnia. This is the last we see or hear of her in the movie.

==Video game appearances==
===''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)]]''===
Macready appears as a non-playable character in the video game adaptation of the Disney/Walden Media film, appearing in "The Spare Room" level in the console versions. Hitting a box blocking the path causes a warning to appear on the bottom of the screen indicating Macready is about to arrive to scold the Pevensies for the noise they caused, to which the player must hide from Macready in certain locations before she catches them whenever player tries to destroy the boxes blocking the path; otherwise, the player must restart the level whenever she catches them. Whenever the Pevensies hide at certain locations of the level, Macready will arrive at the spot looking confused that the Pevensies disappeared. Occasionally whenever the player approaches Macready in later parts of the level, she will scold the Pevensies for disturbance in the mansion, causing the player to restart the level. During the final part of the level after the player finds Edmund outside the mansion, the player must run into the wardrobe area to finish the mission to avoid being put into punishment.

==Differences from source material==
*Unlike in the books, Macready used a horse and buggy for transportation. Additionally, there is no mention of Macready giving the Pevensies any tour groups around the Professor's house in the Disney/Walden Media adaptation.
*This depiction of Macready controlled her temper when the Professor saw Lucy breaking down, and took her to the kitchen for a drink.
