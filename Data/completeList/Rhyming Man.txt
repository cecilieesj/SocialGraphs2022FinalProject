}}The '''Rhyming Man''' is a [[Mickey Mouse]] villain from the [[Floyd Gottfredson]] strips. He talks in rhyme as a parody of foreign villains' accents.

==History==
The Rhyming Man first appears in "The Atombrella and the Rhyming Man", where he's a spy from an undefined foreign nation, who thries to get [[Eega Beeva]]'s invention, the Atombrella, an umbrella-like accessory which can protect its user from an atomic explosion. Unusual for a Mickey villain, he killed one of his underlings by strangling him (he tried to do the same to other before, but in that case survived).

He resurfaced in some [[Italy|Italian]] comics.
