==Series Info==
*In ''An Affair to Forget'', it is learned that Eric's birthday is June 24, 1978. However, in the season 3 episode ''Stormy Weather'', he celebrates his 18th birthday in the winter. This is a continuity error.
*Went to John Adams High during the first few seasons.
*Had many schemes with Jason, much like Cory and Shawn in the later years.
*Struggled with the SATs, getting a poor grade and unable to get into college as a result of it.
*Went on a cross-country road trip with Cory between seasons 3 and 4.
*Stayed at home, remaining a townie during season 4.
*Found the motivation to retake the SATs and reattempt getting into college in ''Security Guy'' and got a 1120, 200 points higher than his first score.
*Was accepted to Pennbrook.
*Became the roommate of [[Jack Hunter]] when he started attending Pennbrook.
*Became the roommate of [[Rachel McGuire]] at the beginning of season 6, starting a competition for her affections with Jack.
*Ultimately gave up on competing for Rachel, and moved out of the apartment.
*Stayed in [[Mr. Feeny]]'s car between seasons 6 and 7 without Feeny knowing.
*Moved in to Topanga and Angela's old, girls dormroom in ''For Love and Apartments''.
*Actually highly intelligent and can get passing grades in his sleep (in fact, he once did), but due to his laziness and immaturity he is never able to make anything of himself academically.
*Gradually became more and more insane as the seasons progressed, especially in season 7.
*Moved to [[New York City]] with Cory, Shawn, and Topanga after graduating from Pennbrook.
