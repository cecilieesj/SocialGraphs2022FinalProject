In "[[The Real Rodents of Little Rodentia]]", [[Fru Fru]] asks Brianca and the rest of her friends to know who would be the Maid of Honor, which Brianca comments that she has been the obious choice - being married 23 times only for the conversation to be interrupted when [[Tru Tru]] arrives. Soon as Fru Fru and her friends approach Tru Tru, Brianca comments of not having her interest for Tru Tru. Soon as Fru Fru realizes that Tru Tru is ruining her show, Brianca and the rest of Fru Fru's friends decide to go shopping at Klawfeld.

Later at the Klawfeld dressing room, Brianca comments on Fru Fru's wedding gown only for Tru Tru to arrive at Klawfeld to which as Fru Fru furiously berates her cousin, Brianca and the rest of her friends react to Fru Fru furiously fighting her only for Tru Tru to leave in anger while Fru Fru and the rest of her friends exit Klawfeld.

Later during Fru Fru's wedding, Brianca and the rest of Fru Fru's friends are seen serving as Fru Fru's bridesmaids while Fru Fru throws her bouquet of night howlers to for Tru Tru and the rest of her friends to smell the flowers resulting in side effects that put them into savage mode.

==Trivia==
*The cheese patterns on Brianca's shirt are a reference to the stereotype of mice having a like on cheese mostly in media. In real life despite popular belief, most mice do not have a special appetite for cheese. Mice in real life only eat cheese for better options.
