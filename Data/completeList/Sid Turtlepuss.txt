==Role in the series==
Apart from [[Roy Hess]], Sid was the most frequently seen work buddy. Although Sid's surname was the most frequently used within the show (on his work jacket, during [[Monica DeVertebrae]]'s hearing or being addressed as "Mr. Turtlepuss"), in the early episode "[[The Golden Child]]", his name tag gave his surname as "Jacobs," in reference to [[wikipedia:Michael Jacobs|Michael Jacobs]], and his coworkers also had in-joke surnames.
