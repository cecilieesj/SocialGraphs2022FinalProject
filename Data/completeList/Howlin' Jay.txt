'''Howlin' Jay''' is a blue wolf-like mammal from [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_318:_Swamp_Music Episode 318: Swamp Music] of ''[[Dinosaurs]]''. He was performed by [[Kevin Clash]].

A blues musician, Howlin' Jay distrusts all dinosaurs, or "The Lizard" as he calls them. [[Robbie Sinclair]] tries to change his attitude by bringing Howlin' Jay and his son [[Sonny]] to the Sinclair home for dinner and trying to prove there's a market for genuine "swamp music."{{MuppetsWiki}}{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}
