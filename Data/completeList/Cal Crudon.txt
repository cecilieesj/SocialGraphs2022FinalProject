'''Cal Crudon''' is a character from the ''[[Quack Pack]]'' episode; "[[Gator Aid]]."

==Appearance==
Cal is an obese man with brown hair who wears a purplish-blue hat, no shirt, blue overalls, and red and white shoes.

==Gator Aid==
When Cal welcomes the Ducks to his ranch, he shows them a few gators. The Ducks realize that those are fake alligators, except for one whose name is [[Antoinette]], and Cal tells them the story about the disappearance of the [[Colonel (Quack Pack)|Colonel]] (his former Chief Alligator Wrangler) and the alligators. So [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] decides to solve the mystery about the disappearance of the gators.

But because Cal needs the publicity and since there aren't any gators, he tries to interest Daisy with several types of ranches from swamp rats to catfish ranches but to no avail. After the Ducks leave to find the missing gators, Cal isn't seen throughout the rest of the episode after this.
