The '''Martians''' are a group of characters featured in Disney's co-produced [[2011]] animated film, ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]''. They are the reason why they needed to abduct Milo's mother to have her memories transferred to the memory extraction machine which under the tyrannical rule of the [[Supervisor]].

==Background==
Centuries ago, Martians are born popping out of fragile ground every 25 years and the Martians have bad treatment to their own babies and all the Martians taking control of the chamber are females followed by the Martians building Nanny-bots to raise them. However, thanks to Ki's evidence showing the other Martians the prophecy of a true Martian family, they no longer use Nanny-bots to raise Martian hatchlings.

The SISS ('''S'''uperv'''i'''sor's '''S'''ecret '''S'''ecurity) is a group of Martians in black uniforms patrolling the Martians' chamber under tyranny of the Supervisor. As doing their duties is part of their job, they patrol wherever which area they are at and always follow the command from the Supervisor. Ever since then when the Supervisor's betrayal is revealed, the SISS soldiers turn against her for her betrayal thanks to Ki's evidence.

==Role in the film==
The Martians are introduced as a group of aliens under the tyranny of the [[Supervisor]]. They search around Earth to look for children who disobey their mothers; however, when their system shows footage of Milo's Mother telling her son to take out the trash, the Supervisor finds out that she might be the perfect mother she could find. However, when it comes to [[Milo (Mars Needs Moms)|Milo]] disobeying his mother, the Martians take her and plan to extract his mother's memories to a memory extraction machine.

As Milo arrives in Mars, Milo encounters a group of male Martians living underground to which they imitate Milo's actions of what his mother does at Earth until [[Two-Cat]] rescues him and takes him to Gribble. Gribble, who meets Milo, explains that the Martians do not treat their own kind properly and all the Martians in charge of their system are females, so they build Nanny-bots to raise female Martians. Later in order to avoid getting spotted by the Martians, Gribble has Milo disguise as a Martian soldier as the Supervisor watches the chamber in surveillance. Milo arrives at the Citadel to which while there, Gribble is held hostage in the Martian chamber just as Milo encounters Ki who introduces herself to him. After Milo looks at a t-shirt of Gribble and his late mother, Two-Cat shows footage of Gribble about to be terminated by a group of SISS soldiers just as Milo manages to rescue him. The Supervisor encourages Ki to fire, but she refuses so she helps Milo and Gribble escape. The two end up in the same spot where a tribe of underground Martians gazes upon them just as a group SISS soldiers arrives and prepares to shoot them down to which Wingnut finds them as the two escape into a translucent cavern.

Later at the cavern, Ki arrives searching for Milo and Gribble as she takes a picture of a hidden prophecy about a true Martian family, causing Ki to realize that the Supervisor has betrayed all the Martians just as she uses a handheld device to show evidence. Milo, Gribble, Two-Cat, and Ki manage to enter the silo to find the memory extraction machine and rescue Milo's mother to which along the way, Milo's group outsmarts some guards, disables the surveillance camera, and rescues Wingnut and the other tribe of underground Martians who are all imprisoned by the SISS. On their way, the group sees footage of male Martian hatchlings being dumped down into the junkyard where they are raised by underground males. As Milo's friends arrive at the silo, Milo plans to rescue his mother much to the Supervisor enraged that Milo is disrupting the plan just as she sends her guards to stop him. Milo manages to stop the memory extraction machine and rescue his mother, causing the machine to miss and launch a plasma blast at the space station, which disables all the Nanny-bots, causing a large commotion across the chamber, disrupting the Supervisor's plan just as the extraction plan has failed, foiling the tyrannical ruler's plan.

As Milo manages to save his mother's life, Ki confronts the Supervisor telling her that she has betrayed all the Martians, telling all the other Martians about what a true Martian family is just as she shows evidence found at the translucent cavern. After the SISS listen to Ki's evidence, one of the members became furious with the Supervisor that she betrayed her own species to which the Supervisor is arrested for her betrayal and tyranny. With the Supervisor arrested for her betrayal just as the SISS soldiers turn against her and Milo and his mother reunited once again, all the Martians continue adapting to have a better life just as Two-Cat uses a cable for a Mars rover and plugs in a cable to work in conjunction with Ki and Gribble working together to give signal to NASA.
