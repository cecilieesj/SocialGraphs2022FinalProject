She is married to [[Joe Robinson]] and spends her time controlling her full-sized model trains throughout the [[Anderson Observatory]]. She is voiced by Kelly Hoover.

==Personality==
Like the rest of the Robinsons, Billie is energetic and eccentric and cares deeply about her family. She likes challenging [[Gaston Framagucci]] to race her trains whenever they have spare time.

==Appearances==
===[[Meet the Robinsons]]===
Billie first appears when [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] and [[Bud Robinson|Bud]] arrive to find her and [[Gaston Framagucci|Gaston]] about to race. Gaston asks Lewis to time the race, which he manages to win. Besides her full scale model train utilized in the race, Billie also has a small train used to pass trays around the dinner table. When [[Tiny the T-Rex|Tiny]] is on the attack, she utilizes her train to ram the dinosaur back outside.

===[[Meet the Robinsons (video game)]]===
In the video game, [[Wilbur Robinson|Wilbur]] is charged early on with helping Billie restore the power-charger for her large trains. Billie also operates a monorail line that allows Wilbur to travel to different parts of the city that has a station right inside the foyer of the house.

==Trivia==
*Billie originally switched her accents constantly, before Lewis finally asks where she comes from: Cleveland.
*It was Billie who told Lewis (and the audience) that "from failing you learn, from success not so much." This may also imply to the fact that many famous people, including [[Walt Disney]], came across even many failures before they became successful.
