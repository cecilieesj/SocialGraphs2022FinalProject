He appears as the titular secondary antagonist of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''. [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] forced Jumba to create Leroy and design him as an improved version of [[Stitch]] with extra destructive capabilities and less fluffy. Thus, Hämsterviel could use Leroy to take control of the Galactic Federation and finally capture all of the other experiments. Leroy has [[Leroy Clones|an army of clones]] and is a near-unstoppable monster. His one true place is in [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Leroy is an antagonistic, conceited, and ruthless experiment created to serve as [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s enforcer, and thus obeys the scientist without question. Despite his loyalty to Hämsterviel, Leroy enjoys seeing him suffer as much as anyone else, as he is shown laughing sadistically at Hämsterviel when the latter falls to the ground after their cannon is destroyed. Nevertheless, Leroy is completely loyal to Hämsterviel, as he never once tried to betray him.

Like [[Stitch]], Leroy is shown to be very destructive, but in a more vicious than mischievous way. He is also revealed to be a physical, sadistic, cruel, and disgusting slob. Despite this, he also possesses some of Stitch's habits, including holding soda cans in his mouth, picking his nose with his tongue, and sharing Stitch's love for [[Elvis Presley]]'s music (though "[[Aloha ʻOe]]" would be an exception due to his fail-safe), as Leroy and [[Leroy Clones|his clones]] were seen dancing to "[[Jailhouse Rock]]" in their prison cells.

Leroy is very cunning and hyperactive like Stitch, though he is not quite as immature despite the "age" difference. Where the similarities end in Leroy is how brutal he is in comparison to Stitch. Leroy isn't above using violence to get things accomplished and enjoys tormenting his foes whenever possible. He will more often than not rely on brute force in battle and tends to not show mercy to his opponents, though he is capable of planning out his attacks and is quite smart. While his English is not perfect, Leroy can speak it a bit better than most other experiments.

===Physical appearance===
Leroy resembles an exact duplicate of Stitch with rougher red fur, a mahogany nose, black claws, toes, tips of antennae and ears and back markings, a light tan/pinkish-orange stomach from his chin down and around his eyes, crimson markings on the back of his head and on his back, frilly ears with light purple inside, yellow teeth, a fluffy tail, and a slightly deeper voice as well as two extra, retractable arms, two bent retractable antennae on his head, three bent retractable spines tipped with white and a very dark mahogany on his back, and retractable claws on his front and back paws. When his mouth is closed, his canine fangs stick out. ('''Note:''' Leroy can be considered as Experiment 629, as he was the 629th experiment created.)

When impersonating Stitch, Leroy dons the same black spacesuit when Stitch wore when he was the captain of the [[B.R.B. 9000]]. Leroy's suit is a black shirt with thick red brims on his shoulders, wrist-length sleeves with red cuffs, along with matching vertical linings on both sides of the shirt and trousers. He also wore a gray belt with a light gray "V" on the front, along with a small gray mark on the upper left chest that resembles a tear drop with a black dot on it. After Leroy and his clones were defeated, the suit was removed.

===Powers and abilities===
Leroy possesses all of the same powers as Stitch, with a little extra boost of strength and speed. He can curl into a ball and roll with incredible speed, dealing heavy damage to anything he hits. He is incredibly durable, being immune to fire, bullets, electricity, and other hazards. He is also smart, faster than a supercomputer, and can absorb electric and fire powers. He is normally very physical, but also good with a [[Plasma Blaster|plasma gun]]. Leroy also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue and can instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is also immune to some of the other experiments' powers; since he is created after [[Angel]], her song has no effect on him.

===Weaknesses===
During his creation, Leroy was programmed with a fail-safe that causes him and his clones to shut down when they hear the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]".

Like Stitch, Leroy is not immune to all the other experiments' powers, evident as some of his clones are affected by [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]] and [[Babyfier]].

It is unknown whether or not Leroy shares Stitch's weakness of water.

==Role in the film==
Experiment 629 was the 629th and last known genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to have all of [[Stitch]]'s powers, with a little extra boost of strength and speed. He was named Leroy by Dr. Hämsterviel.

While spending a few years on Earth, Jumba had an unfinished [[Experiments|experiment]] at his [[Galaxy Defense Industries|laboratory]] in deep space. After [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and Stitch had successfully captured and rehabilitated all 625 of Jumba's experiments, he regained access to his lab. During this time, Jumba's evil former partner [[Dr. Hämsterviel]] escaped [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]] with [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]'s help.

Jumba started creating an experiment with explosive saliva from a template similar to Stitch until he was ordered by Hämsterviel, who paid Jumba a visit, to instead make the latter "a new version of 626." Forced to comply after being threatened by Gantu, Jumba created a red, destructive replica of Stitch. 

Hämsterviel decided to mimic Lilo by naming the experiment, just like she did with the other experiments. After [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|trying]] [[Kixx|several]] [[Slugger|failed]] [[Cannonball|experiment]] [[627|names]], due to Gantu pointing out that each one was already taken, Hämsterviel christened the newly-created experiment Leroy (much to Jumba and Gantu's amusement).

Shortly after, Stitch attacked the lab to apprehend Hämsterviel, and Leroy was released to battle Stitch. After a long fight ensued between the twin experiments, Stitch eventually had Leroy pinned down, but [[Pleakley]]'s untimely arrival distracted Stitch long enough for Leroy to bat him into a containment orb.

After Leroy proved to be more powerful than Stitch (although he had technically won unfairly), the former was [[Leroy Clones|cloned]] by Hämsterviel into a huge army. The original Leroy then took over the [[B.R.B. 9000|B.R.B.]] by posing as Stitch, the captain, and ordered that the [[Galactic Armada|pilots]] take him, Hämsterviel, and the Leroy army to [[Planet Turo|Turo]].

En route, Leroy received a call from Lilo and, resuming his Stitch disguise, attempted to pose as Stitch. However, he was quickly discovered by Lilo to be an impostor, as he was not wearing the [[Stitch's Necklace|tiki necklace]] that she had given Stitch earlier, causing Hämsterviel to order Leroy to "hang up" (namely by blasting the communicator). Upon arriving on planet Turo, the Leroy army was able to overthrow the council and gain galactic domination. 

Meanwhile, a Leroy clone arrived on Earth, where, using [[Lilo's Experiment Book|Lilo's stolen experiment logbook]], he rounded up all of the first 624 experiments there (along with [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] while capturing [[Gigi]]) and brought them to a stadium to be destroyed.

Shortly after, Hämsterviel and the entire Leroy army arrived at the stadium on Earth in the B.R.B. to destroy the captured experiments. Before they could, however, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, [[Reuben]], and a reformed Gantu arrived, and a battle ensued between the experiments and the Leroy clones.

Though the experiments were able to overpower the Leroys at first, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand. However, as the Leroys came close to winning the battle, Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused all the Leroys (including the original one) to shut down due to the original's fail-safe.

Afterwards, all of the Leroys, along with Hämsterviel, were sent to prison on Asteroid K-37, where they were seen happily dancing to the song "[[Jailhouse Rock]]" with an angry Dr. Hämsterviel tapping his foot.

==Trivia==
*Until June [[2020]], Leroy was not officially called Experiment 629. Prior to this month, in promotional material for the film and on some [[Japan]]ese and [[Disneyland Paris]] merchandise, Leroy was also referred to as '''Experiment 628''', although this number was not used for his initial appearance in either the Japanese or global versions of ''[[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]]''. Regardless, Leroy being X-628 is false, as he was only called Leroy in the film and is the evil doppelganger of Experiment 626. Also, the real [[Experiments#Battlefield and doomsday experiments with galactic implications|Experiment 628]] (albeit in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form) was shown in the episode "[[627 (episode)|627]]".
**Leroy was officially referred to in media as Experiment 629 on [[June 4]], 2020, via a limited-time side story of the manga ''[[Stitch & the Samurai]]'' that was released exclusively via the Japanese version of ''LINE: Disney Tsum Tsum''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/LINE_tsumtsum_j/status/1268422230498828288 Tweet from the Japanese ''LINE: Disney Tsum Tsum'' account written on June 4, 2020.]</ref> In the manga, a caption box appears under Leroy, referring to him as "試作品629ルロイ" or "Prototype 629 Leroy". ("Prototype", written as 試作品, is [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|the franchise]]'s Japanese terminology for "Experiment"; ルロイ translates to "Leroy".)
**Leroy's chapter in the side story was not published in English, thus leaving him technically unnumbered outside Japan.
*Leroy is the only experiment to have not been created by Jumba out of his own free will, as Hämsterviel forced him to create the experiment, though he had originally intended Leroy to be a different experiment.
*Technically speaking, Leroy is the youngest of all the known experiments, having only come into existence during the events of ''Leroy & Stitch''.
*Hämsterviel wanted Leroy's fur color to be red instead of blue so as to match his cape, and that he doesn't like the color blue.
**Ironically, Leroy can change his fur color to look like Stitch's.
**It is unknown if he can change his fur color to other colors.
*Leroy's color scheme and attitude seem to be derived from [[627|Experiment 627]]. Much like 627, Leroy could not be rehabilitated.
**627 was suggested as a name by Jumba before Gantu reminded him that 627 was already created.
*Leroy is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], and [[Shrink]].
**Leroy, in particular, was named by Hämsterviel, who is also implied to have named Shrink.
**It can also be said that Hämsterviel opened and closed Jumba's career of creating genetic experiments, having named the first and last experiment he funded (Shrink and Leroy, respectively).
*When Hämsterviel christened the newly-created experiment Leroy, everyone, for whatever reason, laughed at the name except Lilo, who thought Leroy was a fine name.
**Hämsterviel initially tried to name him [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Kixx]], [[Slugger]], and [[Cannonball]], but Gantu pointed out that they were already taken.
*Leroy is the third experiment shown to share Stitch's habit of picking his nose with his tongue, the first being [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]] and the second being [[Angel]].
**He is also the first experiment shown to share Stitch's habit of obtaining and enjoying soda.
*Although Leroy is the secondary antagonist, he turned out to be more dangerous than Hämsterviel.
*According to the DVD scene selection, Leroy has about 50,000 [[Leroy Clones|clones]].
*The scene where a Leroy clone crash-lands on Earth in [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]'s backyard is the same animation when Stitch first crash-landed on Earth in ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''.
*When Leroy was defeated, his eyes glowed green as Stitch's eyes did in ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''.
*Leroy can be considered to be one of the only successful prototypes for Jumba's "ultimate monster" experiment, since Jumba deliberately programmed Leroy's weakness to the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", and no actual failure has been observed. Other notable attempts for such a prototype experiment are [[Cyber|000]], [[Ace|262]], [[Woops|600]], [[Reuben|625]], 626, and 627, and each failed for its own reason: 000 is uncontrollable, 262 is good, 600 is clumsy, 625 is lazy, 626 wanted a family, and 627 is weak to laughter.
*He is one of the few experiments that are actually villains, along with Leroy's clones, Cyber, [[Chopsuey]], 627, and [[Dark End]], while all the other experiments were following their primary function.
