|image = MadamSnake.jpg|alignment = Bad}}'''Madame Snake''' is one of the recurring villains of ''[[Teamo Supremo]]'', and one of the first villains the series' titular characters ever went up against. She is a tall, green-skinned, snake-like mutant with serpentine features who wears a green snake skin patterned dress with a pink necklace.

She was once an up-an-coming model/fashion designer, until she had an accident involving a batch of experimental shower gel (this incident is never fully explained in the show) which altered her body, and gave her the power to compress her skeleton and mold her face, making her a master of disguise.
