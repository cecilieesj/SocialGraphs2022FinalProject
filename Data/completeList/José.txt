'''José''' is one of the four masters of ceremonies for [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]] and [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Under New Management]].

==Appearances==

=== [[Main Street Cinema]] ===
José is mentioned as a contact for the [[Disneyland Casting Agency]] to recruit new bird performers for the Tiki Room.

=== [[Skipper Canteen]] ===
There is a candelabra in this restaurant modelled after José, Fritz, Michael and Pierre.

===[[The Tropical Hideaway]]===
At the Tropical Hideaway, a package delivered by the [[Jungle Navigation Company]] is seen along the riverside.  Said parcel is addressed to José. 

===Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room===
Jose is the main Tiki Bird and his awakening by a cast member opens the show and calls Michael into waking up. He leads the Tiki Room cast in singing both ''[[The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room]]'' and ''[[Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing]]''. Later during the ''[[Hawaiian War Chant]]'' musical number and when the frenzy goes fast, a large thunderstorm is brought to the Tiki Room; Jose then explains to the other Tiki Birds that someone "has left the shower running" to which Michael explains that the Tiki Gods have been angered for all the celebration. During the end of the show, he tells the audience, "We have a wonderful magic trick for you" just before the guests leave the attraction where the four bird hosts sing a special rendition of "[[Heigh Ho]]".

====The Enchanted Tiki Room: Under New Management====
The show opens the same way as the original, but the song is interrupted by [[Iago]], who tells them that the old act isn't going to do it anymore. Jose protests by telling Iago "We've done the same show!" with Fritz. When Iago's actions wake up Uh-Oa, Jose and the others briefly sing ''Hot, Hot, Hot'' as the Tiki Gods come to life. With Iago punished and learning his lesson that the Tiki Room can adapt just fine to a new audience, Jose and his friends happily celebrate getting their show back.

== Other Appearances ==

===Disney Kingdoms===
In [[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room|''Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room'']], Jose decides to quit the group and start a solo career, with the Tiki Birds scrambling to find a substitute and considering options like the [[Orange Bird]], holograms, and their volunteer employee Chip. After Chip's failure, Jose decides to come back as long as they let him have the creative freedom to perform new material. However, this does not last as Jose's ego continues to grow out of control and the band ends up breaking up entirely after a fight between him and Michael.

Jose continues trying to start a solo career, selling CDs at the hastily built "Chip's X-Treme Tiki World" island resort that Chip built with money invested by the wealthy Randy family. When this fails, he flies back home and desperately tries to make amends with the others, only for Michael to be kidnapped shortly afterwards, leading to a rescue and the eventual re-forming of the band.
