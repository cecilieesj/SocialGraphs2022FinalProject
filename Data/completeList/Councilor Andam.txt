==History==
Councilor Andam is a former World Dragon and protector of Africa, who now serves as a member of the [[The Dragon Council|Dragon Council]], apparently headquartered on the Isle of Draco.<ref name="sum">[[Dragon Summit]]</ref> He is the Dragon of Africa and the apparent leader of the Dragon Council (he was the one who made the thousand year toast). He's also the administer of the Dragon test: Wisdom in battle. Like [[Councilor Kulde]], he believes [[Jake Long|Jake]] shows much potential as a dragon.

Unlike most dragons, he breathes lightning instead of fire.
