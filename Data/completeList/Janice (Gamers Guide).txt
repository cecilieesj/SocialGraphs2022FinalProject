In the episode "The Gaming Club," she meets Wendell, whom she was last seen seven years ago when he borrowed a book entitled ''Worm with a Perm''. Unfortunately, Wendell forgot to return the book. After various attempts to return the book, Wendell is finally caught when he accidentally misplaces the book and the whole library collapses, leading to a mess. Therefore, Janice gives him the biggest fine ever, 7,321 dollars! Wendell is shocked over this fine, but then reads the fine print which says the borrower has the choice to either pay the fine or purchase a new copy of the book. The book costs only $3.25, so Wendell decides to pay for a new copy of the book, which is unfortunate for Janice. In the same episode, Janice was also the announcer of the gaming match of Mondale High School vs West Yuba High.
