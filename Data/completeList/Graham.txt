'''Graham''' is a chef at IHOW that Olive has a crush on in the episode "restaurANTeur". He joins the A.N.T. program and becomes Olive's boyfriend. Graham is also a bit psychotic and tends to yell at Fletcher about adding salt into food or not adding salt on a quail egg. Despite this he seems to be a reasonably nice person and has good intentions. However, he goes berserk when anyone interferes with his food in any way, even to the point of holding grudges, though he will try to let them go after a while. After Olive yells at Fletcher for using incorrect grammar, Graham breaks up with her because she yells over grammar. Fletcher comments that he is the one who really yells.
