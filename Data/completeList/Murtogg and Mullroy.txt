{{Quote|That [[Jack Sparrow]]. He talked about the ''[[Black Pearl]]''."<br>"Mentioned it is more what he did.|Murtogg and Mullroy|Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl}}
'''Murtogg and Mullroy''' are supporting characters in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise]]. They are two dimwitted soldiers who are assigned to guard any ship in [[Port Royal]] from pirates, although they tend to get distracted easily.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===
When [[James Norrington]] is being promoted at Fort Charles, Murtogg and Mullroy served their duties as marines where they were to guard the docks of [[Port Royal]] where the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'' docked at. Despite their plans to stop [[Jack Sparrow]], they were incapable of rescuing [[Elizabeth Swann]], forcing Jack to save her in the ocean.

When they mention "a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out, their conversation has foreshadowed the presence of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]], and his crew. After the ''Black Pearl'' attacks [[Port Royal]], both started devising a plan to fight against the ''Pearl''. After a discussion with Norrington about the ''Pearl'', the Royal Navy planned time search for Elizabeth, who was captured during the ambush as Murtogg and Mullroy board the ''Dauntless'' and fight against Barbossa and his undead crew, though they survived the conflict after the battle ends.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
When the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' was commanded by Norrington, Murtogg and Mullroy worked for the [[East India Trading Company]]. Upon looking at [[Davy Jones]] and his crew, the two were frightened upon seeing their appearances, though Norrington orders them to be steady.

Murtogg and Mullroy were tasked guarding the chest containing the heart of Davy Jones, but Jack Sparrow was able to take the chest when the two were bickering. Murtogg and Mullroy later participated in the battle at the maelstrom and later survived after Davy Jones falls to his death. Afterwards, the two later switched sides and fights against [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] and later celebrate their freedom from the EITC. Following the death of Cutler Beckett, the two joined the crew of the ''Black Pearl'', making them the only survivors of Beckett's forces on the ''Dutchman'' to join the ''Pearl'' with Barbossa as the captain.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===
Once again, Murtogg and Mullroy served as crew members of the ''Pearl'' this time on the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''. Following the battle against [[Captain Salazar]], the [[Trident (Hercules)|Trident of Poseidon]] was destroyed, undoing all curses and Barbossa sacrifices himself to save the crew while defeating Salazar. With Barbossa gone, Murtogg and Mullroy mourn the death of Barbossa along with the other crew members who mourn him. Furthermore, Murtogg and Mullroy accepted Jack Sparrow as the captain of the ''Pearl'', retaining his duty.
