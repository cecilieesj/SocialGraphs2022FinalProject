'''Raja''' is the main antagonist of [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]'s animated short, ''[[Tiger Trouble]]'' and the secondary antagonist of ''[[Goliath II]]''.

==Background==
Raja is a crafty old tiger who tries to eat [[Goliath II (character)|Goliath II]] '''('''''wondering what a tiny elephant tastes like''''')''' every time he crosses him, but each attempt always ends in consecutive failures. He is eventually swallowed by a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] on his last try, but he escapes from the crocodile's stomach and runs away in horror, and was never seen again. It is unknown what happened to him. But, he presumed gave up going after Goliath II and tries to find something else to do somewhere else.

==Appearances==
Raja first appeared as an unnamed Royal Bengal tiger in the short ''[[Tiger Trouble]]'', where he tried to eat the tiger hunter [[Goofy]] in the jungles of [[India]].

His most famous appearance was in the [[1960]] short film ''[[Goliath II]]'' in which he attempts to eat the [[Goliath II|small titular elephant]] many times before he is eventually thrown to the [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] by [[Goliath II's mother]].

He has also appeared in the TV show ''[[TaleSpin]]'' in the episode "[[Save the Tiger]]" as an unnamed assistant of [[Shere Khan#TaleSpin|Shere Khan]], working for [[Khan Industries]]. He also made a cameo in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode "[[Year of the Dog]]", where [[Mickey Mouse]] accidentally splashes him with a torrent of soda from a billboard.

==Trivia==
*Raja was a character that inspired people to create another character; in this case, a [[Wolf (The Sword in the Stone)|wolf]] based on him in ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.
*[[Louie the Mountain Lion]] seems to be modeled after Raja from ''[[Tiger Trouble]]''.
*Raja is made to look like the short's main antagonist but is never seen again after halfway into the short. The short's real villain is the [[Mouse (Goliath II)|mouse]].
*When Raja tries to trap Goliath II with his tail after he accidentally wakes him up by hitting him on the head with a cattail, the stripes on his tail shift so that the tip of his tail is now colored orange when normally it's supposed to be black.
* When Raja gets twisted around by [[Goliath II's mother]]'s trunk, Raja is heard screeching like a cat. In reality, tiger cries sound nothing like housecat calls - this would be intended for comedic effect. This kind of "tiger with cat sounds" scenario would be repeated when [[Rajah]] gets turned into a cub by [[Jafar]] in Aladdin.
