'''Edna Peepleson''' is a supporting character in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[Vampirina]]''. She is the mother of [[Poppy Peepleson]] and [[Edgar Peepleson]] and [[Vampirina Hauntley]]'s neighbor.
She often gets creeped out by the spooky things found in Vampirina's home, but respects her and her family nonetheless. She is also the leader of the Woodchuck Woodsies group that Vampirina and her friends take part in, and the judge of the dog show Vampirina enters [[Wolfie (Vampirina)|Wolfie]] in.
==Background==
===Personality===
Edna Peepleson is very excitable, motherly, and supportive. But she is easily scared of spooky stuff. Unlike her children, she never suspects there is anything supernatural around the Hauntleys. She has some trouble with disappointment, as revealed when she loses the house-decorating competition to the Hauntleys in "[[Hauntleyween]]".
===Physical Appearance===
Edna has brown eyes, short brown hair, wears yellow earrings, and a yellow sweater decorated with orange cats. After the first episode, she wears a similar sweater without cat patterns.
