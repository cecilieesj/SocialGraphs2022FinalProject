==Trivia==
*It's unknown if Eddie will appear in ''[[Raven's Home]]'', which he hasn't been seen or mentioned in so far. The reason behind his absence so far is due to Orlando Brown, who originally portrays him, got into numerous legal issues between 2016 and 2018 <ref>https://www.tmz.com/2016/02/18/disney-star-orlando-brown-arrested/</ref><ref>https://www.eonline.com/news/907345/disney-star-orlando-brown-arrested-following-family-dispute</ref><ref>https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/05/orlando-brown-arrested-vegas-narcotics-mug-shot-raven-tattoo/</ref><ref>https://www.tmz.com/2018/09/04/orlando-brown-arrested-burglary-vegas-caught-on-camera/</ref>.
**He is finally referenced in the ''Raven's Home'' episode [https://ravenshome.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_From_Pal-Catraz Escape From Pal-Catraz].
*Eddie is similar to [[Nia Baxter-Carter]]'s best friend [[Tess O'Malley|Tess]] from ''Raven's Home'' as they're both rappers and basketball players.
*Eddie was only shown playing basketball in the early seasons and not so much in season three and four.
*His dream is to become a rapper.
