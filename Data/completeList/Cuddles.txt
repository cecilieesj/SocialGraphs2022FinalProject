'''Cuddles''' is a recurring character and antagonist in ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''. He is the pet cat of [[Hunter De Vil]].

== Appearance ==
He is a skinny Sphinx cat who does not have any fur. This means he does not cause Dylan's cat allergies to react to his presence. Cuddles is pink with a grey spot on his left eye and ear. When he is on recon missions for the De Vils, Cuddles wears a red collar with a camera on it, but he is sometimes seen without the collar.

== Bio ==
At first glance, Cuddles looked like any close sidekick, in this case, he was always seen with Hunter. He is also known to be stealthy, able to sneak into the Dalmatian family's house. However, it turns out that he is treacherous and cowardly, willing to give up on Hunter when Cruella turned on the latter. In "The De Vil Wears Puppies", Hunter chased Cuddles like an annoyed dog in their final scene.

As such it is unknown if Cuddles is still Hunter's pet.

==Notes==

* Cuddles is the fifth De Vil pet in Disney adaptations, the other four being [[Scorch]] and [[Vendella De Vil|Vendella]] in ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]],'' [[Fluffy (102 Dalmatians)|Fluffy]] in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' and [[Dude]] in ''[[Descendants]]''.
* Despite the show focusing on the animal characters, and as such their language is translated for the audience, Cuddles has not had any actual lines of dialogue. The closest thing to a spoken line of dialogue is "Me-owch" (a combination of "meow" and "ouch") in "[[London, We Have a Problem]]".
