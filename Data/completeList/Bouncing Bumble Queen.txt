==Background==
The Bouncing Bumble Queen is a large anthropomorphic bee who is beloved by all her Bouncing Bumble subjects. The queen is the only one of her species shown so far that can communicate in human speech.

==Role in the [[Jake and the Never Land Pirates|series]]==
The Queen first appears in "[[Follow the Bouncing Bumble!]]" While on a treasure hunt through [[Big Bug Valley]], [[Captain Hook]] and his crew discover the Bouncing Bumble hive and try to retrieve what treasure lies within, but are forced to flee when the queen's guards cast them out. Not one to give up a treasure hunt, Captain Hook and his crew disguise themselves to try and steal their treasure. The disguises seem to fool the guards, allowing Hook and his men access into the hive. But a young Bouncing Bumble named Bouncer isn't fooled by Hook and his crew and rushes to find help. When he arrives at [[Pirate Island (Jake and the Neverland Pirates)|Pirate Island]], Bouncer meets [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew, who agree to help stop Hook.

Later on, while evading Jake and his crew through the hive, Hook and his crew stumble into the Bouncing Bumble Queen's throne room, where the queen demands the meaning of this. Hook tries to trick the queen into believing that Jake and his crew are a band of thieving pirates who want her treasure. Fortunately, Bouncer is there to prove Jake and crew aren't the thieves, but once the queen realizes the truth, it's too late. Hook and his men make their escape with the queen's treasure chest with Jake, [[Izzy]], [[Cubby]], [[Skully]], and Bouncer in pursuit. Once Jake and his team catch up to Hook, he has already opened the chest, but it only contains honey, much to Hook's anger. He accidentally cracks one of the support beams to the Bouncing Bumble hive. Izzy quickly uses her [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] while Bouncer summons the queen's guards to chase Hook and his crew off. Jake and his crew soon return the chest of honey to the Bouncing Bumble Queen, who is very grateful for the bravery of young pirate crew.
