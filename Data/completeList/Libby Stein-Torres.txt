'''Libby Stein-Torres''' is a supporting character in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. She is a quirky, yet nervous young girl who is [[Molly McGee]]'s best friend other than [[Scratch (The Ghost and Molly McGee)|Scratch]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Libby tends to be shy and sometimes a downer and has trouble speaking for herself. Despite this, she is very friendly and will be eager enough to help Molly with whatever she wants, even if it negatively affects her.

===Physical appearance===
Libby is a tall, skinny, tan skinned girl with brown eyes and wood brown hair that is long and slightly messy.

Her clothes consist of a teal green sweater and black jeans that are ripped at the knee. She wears big black boots with straps on them.

==Trivia==
*As her name implies, she is of Jewish-Argentinian heritage (Argentinian part confirmed by Bill Motz on Discord).
*A running gag has her constantly getting physically harmed in some way.
*Libby is like “The Ghost & Molly McGee” equivalent of [[Marcy Wu]] from [[Amphibia]]. Like Marcy Wu, Libby has a thing for books.
*In some episodes, Libby likes reading ''Bill and Bob's OK Adventure'', which is a parody to the [[1989]] film, ''{{WikipediaLink|Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure}}''.
