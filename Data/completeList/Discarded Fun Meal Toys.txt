The '''Discarded Fun Meal Toys''' are toys who formed a support group, as seen in the ''[[Toy Story Toons]]'' episode ''[[Small Fry]]''. The group resides in [[Poultry Palace]]'s storage room for stored away items including the fun meal toys who get discarded over the years.

==Role in the short==
The group is first seen when [[Buzz Lightyear]] is trying to find a way out to escape the restaurant, assuming the vent might be a way out. Instead, he falls into the storage room where he finds the group. They welcome Buzz into the psychotherapy meeting, not knowing he isn't actually a discarded toy.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', Franklin also appears as one of the toys from the [[Second Chance Antiques]], but is revealed to be a full-bodied toy instead of being a fast food toy (specifically a character riding on a vehicle toy type).
*In ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'', a T-Bone toy can be seen during the bathtub's overflow.
*In ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'', DJ Blu-Jay can be seen on [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]'s shirt.
*Gary Grappling Hook is similar to Lenny because he is a toy modeled after a survivor's tool (he is a grappling hook while Lenny is a pair of binoculars) and he can also talk without a visible mouth.
*The [[Condormobile]] with Condorman toy is the from the 1981 live-action Disney film ''[[Condorman]]''.
