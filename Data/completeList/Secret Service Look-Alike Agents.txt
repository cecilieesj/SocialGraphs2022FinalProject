They are depicted as a bunch of bad guys dressed in black sweaters and dark sunglasses.

==Role in the [[Recess: School's Out|film]]==
The henchmen were first seen when they raided the military outpost that was testing the [[Weather-Altering Laser]].
When TJ was captured by Benedict during a failed rescue attempt of Prickly, TJ and Prickly, after escaping confinement again, attempted to disguise themselves as guards after knocking them down and stripping them of their uniforms to trick the agents, but the agents were smart enough to realize they weren't actually guards, forcing TJ and Prickly to flee.

When the Third Street Elementary School student resistance (led by Gus Griswald) infiltrated the school, several of them were dispatched in various ways:

*Mikey Blumberg, acting as the distraction for the main squad to get inside, got on a stepladder and started singing, with several agents then trying to drive Mikey off, only to fall into a very deep pit that the Diggers created (with aid from their drills from space-camp).
*Vince LaSalle lured several of them into a hallway where his division ambushed them, ending with them trapped in a net by the Ashleys. 
*Gus Griswald lured several of them into the playgrounds of the school where several of his division, which consisted of [[King Bob]] and Captain Bradley, started bombarding them with balls from the roof. As further insurance against them either pursuing Gus or retreating, the main area leading to the jungle gym had been sealed off by several discarded furniture with Gus climbing the pile to act as the signal to commence the bombardment.

Several more were later dispatched by reinforcements composed of the teacher and staff (led by Ms. Finster).

Several were smothered and/or arrested in the aftermath of the battle, with the police presumably airlifting the ones in the pit.


== Trivia ==
* The only named guards in the film were Henderson, Smithson, Underhill, Franklin, Morrissey, and Goodman.
* Since Benedict hates violence, the guards never use any types of guns to kill anyone who stands in their way.
