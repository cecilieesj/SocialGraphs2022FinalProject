He replaced [[Mayor Befufftlefumpter]] as the new mayor of [[Gravity Falls (location)|Gravity Falls, Oregon]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Tyler appears to be good-willed, energetic, and kind. However, he is also known to be effeminate and flamboyant, in stark contrast to most gruff bikers. He has unusual habits, such as choosing to do Christmas shopping in summer. He is seen as a bit of a scatterbrain, not knowing what he wants to buy when he visits the [[Mystery Shack]]. He is also noted for being very indecisive. Despite his soft personality, he is very supportive of acquaintances regardless of their actions, as he seems to follow Manly Dan around and cheer his crazy acts on.

===Physical appearance===
Tyler wears a green and white hat that is similar to Dipper's, a white (pale green in earlier episodes) tank top with a very low neckline, short jean shorts, a belt with a large buckle, and large brown boots. He has light brown hair, a mustache, and small visible eyelashes just like Mabel's.
==Role in the series==
Tyler first appears in "[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]" at the opening day of the fishing season, on the lake along with other residents of [[Gravity Falls (location)|Gravity Falls]]. He follows [[Manly Dan]]'s boat and cheers for him as he grabs a fish from underwater and punches it.

In "[[Headhunters]]", when Dipper interrogates Manly Dan on the murder of Wax Stan in Skull Fracture, Tyler cheers Manly Dan on as he rips off the robotic arm from the arm-wrestling machine and starts beating the machine with it.

He appears once again in "[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]" at the Mystery Shack, wanting to get his Christmas shopping done early, and asks [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]] if there's anything in "the spirit of the season." Grunkle Stan shows him "crystals" and he remarks, "ha, ha, looks like broken glass." Stan asks him, "What are you, a cop?" He is also seen looking at a "fur trout" and asks if he has it in a different animal. Eventually, he is locked inside the Mystery Shack so Mabel, Dipper, and Grunkle Stan go to Greasy's Diner and is seen trying to decide between a puma shirt and a panther shirt (which are the same animal).

In "[[Gideon Rises]]", he is among the disappointed townspeople when it is revealed that Gideon has been spying on the entire town to compensate for his fake psychic abilities. As Sheriff Blubs is about to arrest Gideon, the officer turns to Tyler for his cue. He tearfully says his catchphrase, "Git 'em, git 'em."

In "[[The Stanchurian Candidate]]", he is one of the candidates to run for Gravity Falls' new mayor. After [[Stan]] is disqualified from having a massive criminal background, Tyler becomes mayor by elimination.Â
