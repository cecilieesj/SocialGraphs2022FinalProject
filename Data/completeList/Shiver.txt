'''Shiver''' is a minor character in Disney's [[2018]] movie ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. He is the regent of the Land of Snowflakes. He is portrayed by [[Richard E. Grant]].

==Background==
Shiver was brought to life by Marie Stahlbaum as she created the Four Realms and became its queen. Shiver was given to rule over the Land of Snowflakes while the other regents; [[Mother Ginger]], [[Hawthorne]], and [[The Sugar Plum Fairy]] were given to rule the other three realms; the Land of Amusements, the Land of Flowers, and the Land of Sweets. However, Marie left the Four Realms to be with her family, leaving Shiver and the regents saddened by her departure.

Unknown to the other regents, however, Sugar Plum was the most angered and saddened at Marie's departure so she sought to conquer all Four Realms to ease her pain. Mother Ginger discovered Sugar Plum's plot and attempted to stop her, only to be framed by the latter; causing Shiver and Hawthorne to side with Sugar Plum, believing Mother Ginger to try to take the Four Realms as a result instead of Sugar Plum. This lead to Shiver and his realm, along with the other regents and their realms to go to into war with Mother Ginger and the Fourth Realm. As Shiver continued to aid the other realms in the war against Mother Ginger, he, along with Hawthorne, was still unaware that Sugar Plum was the real traitor and was still seeking to conquer all the realms as she searched for a key for a machine Marie used that would allow her to turn those against her back into toys.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''===
When [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] and [[Phillip the Nutcracker|Phillip]] enter the Palace of the Four Realms, Shiver introduces himself as the Regent of the Land of Snowflakes after [[Hawthorne]] introduces himself as the Regent of the Land of Flowers. He and Hawthorne introduce [[The Sugar Plum Fairy|Sugar Plum]] as the Regent of the Land of Sweets. As Clara explains that her mother Marie passed away, the Regents all react in shock as Shiver shares a condolence with Clara for the loss of her mother and as the Regents bring Clara to Marie's throne, Clara explains to them that she was looking for the key for Marie's last gift to which the regents explains that she must avoid going to the Land of Amusements (the Fourth Realm) as it is forbidden by law of the regents. After Hawthorne devises a plan to organize a pageant for Clara followed, Shiver plans on giving Clara a tour of the Realms.

Shiver is later present attending the pageant of Clara followed by Clara watching the ballet telling the story of the Four Realms. When Clara is given a tour across the Four Realms, she and Shiver board a carriage at the Land of Snowflakes as the citizens bow at them. Later at the observatory, Shiver and Hawthorne are locked up at the observatory due to Sugar Plum's betrayal to the Four Realms by sending an army of tin soldiers to destroy the Four Realms. 

After Sugar Plum is transformed into a lifeless porcelain via Engine, Shiver, Hawthorne, and Mother Ginger praise Clara for saving the Four Realms just as [[Mother Ginger]] sends Phillip to return Clara to the Christmas Tree Forest and return to his new post there.
