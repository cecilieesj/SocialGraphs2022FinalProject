'''Percy''' is an antagonist of ''[[To the Rescue|Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers: To the Rescue]].''Â He is very dimwitted and has almost no involvement as much as [[Aldrin Klordane|Klordane]], [[Fat Cat]], and [[Professor Norton Nimnul|Nimnul]].

==Role in the series==
Percy is first seen getting chased by [[Donald Drake and Plato]] after he stole a Clutchcoin ruby necklace. He drives to a lumber warehouse to look for his boss, [[Aldrin Klordane]]. [[Chip and Dale]] manage to distract him with their antics and cause him to lose the ruby necklace. After the good guys leave, Percy confronts Aldrin.

Percy is later seen with Klordane, [[Fat Cat]], and three other thugs at the Happy Tom Cat Food Factory hideout, with Klordane telling them about the Arctic trip. Percy is later seen again when he and his group are going to the Arctic to give the ruby to [[Professor Norton Nimnul]].

Later, after the rodents freed Plato from a dog pound and entered a subway, Percy and Klordane find Plato, capture him, and chain him to Klordane's train. Percy and the other thugs are then forced by Klordane to steal the gold in the subway. When the Rescue Rangers trigger another earthquake, this causes the whole Gold Reserve building to come down and the cops get investigated within. Percy and the other thugs see the cops and run away. They possibly get arrested later with Klordane.

==Trivia==
*In the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode; "[[Out of Scale (Rescue Rangers episode)|Out of Scale]]", a crook named Moose working for crime boss, Ignatz "Ratso" Ratzki-Watzki bears a striking resemblance to Percy.
*The gag with Percy mistaking Dale for his gun when trying to return fire at [[Donald Drake and Plato|Detective Donald Drake]] and his friend, [[Donald Drake and Plato|Plato the Police Dog]] is based on [[Pete|Black Pete]] mistaking Dale for his gun when trying to return fire at Chip from ''[[The Lone Chipmunks]]''.
