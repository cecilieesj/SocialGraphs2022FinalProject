{{Quote|Special Agent Oso, Mr. Dos here.|Mr. Dos introducing himself whenever Oso is alerted to a kid being unable to complete a task}}
'''Mr. Dos''' is the head of the U.N.I.Q.U.E. Headquarters in ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', who tells the special assignments Oso needs to accomplish.

==Appearance==
This character holds a non-physical face, unlike the rest of the characters. It appears to be a digital and circular navy blue screen with two horizontal lines that vibrate as it speaks. The speaker seems to have a deep booming voice.

==Biography==
Mr. Dos serves as U.N.I.Q.U.E.'s leader and supervisor to Oso. He isn't physically seen and only speaks to Oso in his watch, as his true identity is presumably a mystery. Whenever Oso fails a training exercise upon hearing a special alert from  [[Paw Pilot]], this is when Mr. Dos comes in and speaks to Oso about the situation the child is in and gives Oso a special assignment to help the child complete the task they're unable to do, if it is helping Joe borrow a dinosaur book for his class or helping Oliver and Theo turn on their flashlight. When Oso completes the assignment, Mr. Dos awards him a digi-medal for it before Oso breaks the 4th wall and awards the digi medal to the viewer on also helping them complete the assignment.

==Trivia==
*He is based on M, James Bond's supervisor though M is physically shown and isn't a mysterious figure.
*Mr. Dos could also be based on Charlie Townsend from Charlie's Angels, as they're also a mysterious unseen figure giving tasks.
