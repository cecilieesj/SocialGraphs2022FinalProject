'''The Black Cube of Darkness''' is a character in ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''.

==Background==

===Personality===
Initially, the Black Cube appeared to be an absolute villain who enjoyed harming others and desired more power for himself. Despite this, and the fact that he is pure condensed darkness and evil in the form of a cube, the Black Cube of Darkness is actually quite self-conscious about being a cube and becomes incredibly saddened when realizing that he has no limbs like other beings in the galaxy. Eventually this self-conscious attitude led him to falling into a severe depression and giving up villainy. This showed that the Black Cube was actually a sensitive being who was not completely evil. However, the Black Cube would still use its destructive powers, especially when angered, showing that he sometimes had difficulty controlling his temper. Eventually, through the aid of Wander and some soul searching, the Black Cube became a better person, though he still retained a few of his villainous tendencies.

==Appearances==
He first appeared in "The Fancy Party". He is a seemingly ominous object who was considered to be concentrated evil and only speaks in Latin with a deep demonic voice. He was formerly one of the most powerful and evil villains in the galaxy and was consistently among the top rankings of the Galactic Villain Leaderboard with dozens of planets under his control, but eventually gave up villainy after failing to acquire the Ring of Invincibility in a humiliating event. He has since reformed with the aid of Wander and found a new lease on life.

He joins Wander and a group of rebels to fight [[Lord Dominator]] at [[The End of the Galaxy]].

==Powers==
His main power is the ability to temporarily suck the soul out of anyone who looks directly at him. When he does this, he can be heard speaking in Latin and visible distortion occurs for those nearby. Victims will become limp, and their eyes become covered in darkness. It appears these effects only last a short amount of time. He is also capable of telekinesis and levitation, which provides his main method of mobility.

==Trivia==
*Andy Bean is not credited for voicing the Black Cube during the animatics and credits.
*According to [[Francisco Angones]], the Black Cube is loosely based on the "Ultimate Evil" from the 1997 film ''The Fifth Element''.
*It is possible that the Black Cube knows some English because if you listen carefully when he is battling Little Bits, it sounds like he says, "It's over for you.".
