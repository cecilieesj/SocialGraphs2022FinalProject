'''Domino''' is [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne's]] cat who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Amphibia]]''. Anne adores her so much that she gives her as much care as possible.

==Background==
===Personality===
Like any domestic cat, Domino likes to play and sleep during the day. Her favorite thing is a yarn ball. Whenever she sees one she becomes intrigued by it. However, Domino can sometimes be vicious, especially when someone touches her tummy or wakes her up.

===Physical appearance===
Domino is a small black fluffy cat with white paws, six white whiskers, huge black eyes with yellow sclera, and white fur on her chest. In the first few episodes of season one, Domino was shown to have a splotch of white at the end of her tail. But by season three, her tail has been changed to just being black and fluffy.

==Role in the series==
Throughout seasons one and two, Domino has only been mentioned and seen in pictures and videos on Anne's phone. Domino makes her present day appearance in the third season premiere, "[[The New Normal]]". Along with [[Mr. Boonchuy|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Boonchuy]], Domino comes up to Anne, who had just returned home. She brushed herself around her legs happy to see her owner again.

In "[[Adventures in Catsitting]]", Domino goes around the house catching and chewing flies, sliding down the stairs, knocking things over and playing with a yarn ball. Wanting to contribute to the Boonchuys for their hospitality, [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]], [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]], and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] volunteer to take Domino to the vet while Mrs. Boonchuy takes Anne to the dentist. The Plantars find Domino sleeping in the sun cuddling a yarn ball and purring. Polly jumps on her, and Domino viciously attacks the Plantars as they try to get her in her catbox. Shortly after seeing the vet, Domino escapes and finds her way into a restaurant where she eats the shawarma. She becomes quite popular with the customers, and the owner of the restaurant declares that he will keep her. Hop Pop imitates a firealarm to get everyone out of the restaurant while Sprig and Polly get Domino. She refuses to be pulled away from the shawarma, but Polly manages to lure her back to her catbox by pretending to be a yarn ball. Domino and the Plantars return home, along with a heavily drugged Anne who had "eight cavities and a whole lot of cricket legs". The Boonchuys leave an inebriated Anne with the Plantars as Domino casually licks herself.

==Trivia==
*Domino was likely inspired by [[Matt Braly]]'s cat of the same name and physical appearance.
*Anne found a caterpillar that looks like Domino and called it [[Domino II]] before releasing it into the wild after finding it was a deadly predator.
*According to Anne, Domino was a stray when she adopted her.
