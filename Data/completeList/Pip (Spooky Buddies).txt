==Background==
75 years ago, Pip was seen with his siblings waiting to see the [[Halloween Hound]]. However, after realizing the truth, Pip refused to "visit" him but was caught anyway. Just as his soul was about to be consumed, the sun rose up, causing [[Warwick]] and the Halloween Hound to escape. Pip's soul became separated and it made him a ghost. After being seen by the [[Sheriff Dan|sheriff]], he told [[Joseph Johnson]] and his father to get out of there and had the place condemned. Pip tried to tell Joseph that he was still around, but a magic barrier caused him to remain trapped inside the manor anyway.

==Role in the film==
75 years later, when [[B-Dawg]] enters Warwick's manor, he calls the Halloween Hound three times to summon him. Pip tries to warn the Buddies, but they get scared by his ghostly appearance. B-Dawg thinks Pip is the Halloween Hound and escapes him. After Warwick and the Halloween Hound are released, Pip becomes free so he can warn the Buddies. Before he does so, a boy wearing a ghost costume gets scared by Pip, and he uses it as disguise so he could warn the Buddies. Pip tries to warn them, but the ghost costume slips off and the Buddies get frightened again.

B-Dawg still thinks Pip is the Halloween Hound, and they escape him. Even so, he still does not give up, so the Buddies go to [[Zelda (Spooky Buddies)|Zelda]]'s hideout. When Pip appears, the Buddies and Zelda get terrified, but he convinces them that he means no harm. The Halloween Hound then appears but gets stuck because he is too big, and they escape him. They go to see [[Deputy Sniffer]], but Pip and the Buddies accidentally scare him. The Halloween Hound appears again, and Sniffer tells them that he can deal with him, but he gets turned into stone.

The crew goes to the graveyard where Zelda attempts to bring Pip back into his body, but then Zelda gets turned into stone like Sniffer did, and Pip sees the Buddies get captured by the Halloween Hound. Pip enters Warwick's manor, where he and the Buddies manage to reason with [[Hoot]] and tell him that he can reform. Hoot agrees and releases the Buddies, but then the Halloween Hound sees that Hoot betrayed them, so he turns the owl into stone. Pip and the Buddies get trapped, but Pip bravely informs the Halloween Hound that he sucked his siblings' souls 75 years ago. The Halloween Hound turns Pip into stone as well, but Skip and Rodney's rat forms help them all escape.

After Joseph destroys the crystal, Pip turns back to flesh, and Sniffer, Zelda, Hoot, Pip, and his siblings' souls return to their bodies, while Skip and Rodney are turned back into humans. Pip then returns to his owner and says goodbye to the Buddies before he and Joseph leave.
