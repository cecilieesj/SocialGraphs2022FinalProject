'''Honey Best''' is a minor character in the [[2004]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and its [[2018]] [[Incredibles 2|sequel]]. She is the wife of [[Frozone|Lucius Best]] (a.k.a. Frozone). While she never appears onscreen, she is mentioned early in the film by [[Elastigirl|Helen]], and later has a conversation with her husband. It is unknown if she is also a superhero, or just a normal citizen of [[Metroville]].

==Appearances==
===''[[The Incredibles]]''===
Honey is only seen in one scene, and her appearance remains a mystery. She has hidden Frozone's supersuit from him, leading to a heated argument about a planned dinner. Frozone eventually finds his supersuit. It is unknown if he found it himself or she decided to tell him.

===''[[Incredibles 2]]''===
Honey was originally supposed to have a physical appearance in the second movie, but the crew felt that she was more funny "as a voice". Therefore, her voice is only heard when Lucius gets a call to watch the Parr children, where she tells him to "be back ASAP and leaving that suit".

==Video games==
=== ''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]'' ===
Honey makes no appearance in the game. However, she is mentioned by Frozone to [[Fix-It Felix Jr.|Fix-It Felix]] after unlocking their friendship mode.

==Trivia==
*Her conversations with her husband are her only spoken parts in both films.
*A character model of Honey was created for ''Incredibles 2''. However, it was decided that the character was funnier when the audience couldn’t see her, so the model was not used for her. However, it was used for a background super in the film.
