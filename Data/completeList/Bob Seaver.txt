==Role in the films==
===''Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey''===
Bob first appears at his home where the wedding is held and is married to Laura with her children, Peter, Hope, and Jamie from a previous marriage and Peter's dog, [[Shadow]], attending. He hears a crash noise coming from inside the house and it was a lampshade being knocked down by Jamie's dog, [[Chance]], who was been annoyed by Hope's cat, [[Sassy]], but he and Laura ignored the noise and continue the wedding.

After the wedding, Bob and his family go to the farm owned by their friend, [[Kate (Homeward Bound)|Kate]], where they leave Shadow, Chance, and Sassy to be looked after her ranch's hand, Frank. Before leaving, Jamie plays Frisbee with Chance until Bob throws it, and Chance catches it for him.

A few days later, Bob received word from Kate and Frank that Shadow, Chance, and Sassy are no longer on her farm anymore due to them returning back home. Although saddened by this news, he is hesitant to seriously look for them.<blockquote>''"Trying to find three animals in the wilderness, is like...trying to find a needle in a haystack."''</blockquote>This causes Peter to scold him for leaving them at the farm. At work, at the university where he worked as a professor, his secretary enters his office and informs him that his students are waiting for him; he asks her for a favor to do a hundred print of the "Lost Pet Reward" and goes to where his students are waiting.

Sometime later Bob receives a call from the forest rangers whom he sent to look for Shadow, Chance, and Sassy, and informs him that they found Shadow, Chance and Sassy who helped a lost girl named Molly to find her parents and are in the Fineville Animal Shelter and Chance was getting medical treatment because of his muzzle being pinned by a porcupine earlier, to his delight, causing everyone in the lobby to look at him in confusion. Bob then informs Laura, Hope, and Peter, picks Jamie up during the middle of practice for a play, and apologizes to her teacher for the magic pumpkin that she accidentally breaks and will replace it.

However when Bob and his family finally arrived at the shelter, Shadow, Chance, and Sassy already escaped (because of Chance having mistaken the shelter for a pound), and the shelter staff apologizes to Bob and his family for failing to stop Shadow, Chance, and Sassy from escaping. He watches Peter calling out for Shadow in the darkness, and they returned home.

Near dusk, Bob, Jamie, Peter, and Hope are playing basketball, to which the kids begin to accept him as a second father figure when they hear barking coming from a distance and it was Chance, who then reunites with Jamie, followed by Sassy, except for Shadow who has fallen into a muddy pit at the train yard. Peter laments that Shadow is too old to make it. But Shadow appears in the distance limping (having injured his leg from the fall, and how he able to get out of the muddy pit is not shown), and is reunited with Peter. After being reunited with their pets, they all go inside to enjoy dinner.

===''Homeward Bound 2: Lost in San Francisco''===
Sometime after the first film and before the second film, Bob adopted Peter, Hope, and Jamie. Bob and his family are preparing to go to spent their vacation in [[Canada]]. He is carrying the things that they need for it. When Jamie and Chance return from playing baseball at the field by the park, they leave for the airport and board Chance, Shadow and Sassy in the back of their car.

At the [[San Francisco]] International Airport, Bob puts Chance and the others on their cage. He asks Jamie if he's gonna say goodbye to him, so that they could all board on the plane. At the plane, Peter asks Bob if Chance, Shadow and Sassy are gonna be okay and he replies that they are safe and sound below their feet.

However when Bob and his family arrive in Canada, they received a word that Chance, Shadow and Sassy had somehow escaped from the plane, due to Chance escaping from his cage mistakenly again thinking that he and the others will be taken to the pound and as well mistaken the airport for also a pound.

A few days passed at their rented home, Bob calls the San Francisco authorities to look for Shadow, Chance and Sassy, which they will and also need to watch out for some crooks named [[Jack and Ralph]] who are trying to steal dogs and bring them to their lab. He and his family then board on their rented car to go to the airport.

When Bob and his family finally arrive back in San Francisco, he hopes that Shadow, Chance and Sassy are already at home. While on the way, a container truck that was in front of them suddenly skidding to a stop, and Bob manages to avoid crashing right into it by putting their car to a stop. Hope then asks what happened and he replies it must be an accident and inform them to stay in the car, while he goes to check it. They then notice Shadow and Sassy coming down on a hill nearby, realizing that they already made it and are reunited with their pets. The truck driver then apologizes to Bob and asks him if he and his family are okay and he replies that they are fine and what happened and he replies that there was a dog in the middle of the road. It turns out it was Chance who was in the middle of the road and is reunited with Jamie.

At home, Bob and family meet and adopt a new dog named [[Delilah]], Chance's love interest, a member of [[Riley]]'s gang and the former girlfriend of [[Bando]], who Chance, Shadow, and Sassy met in San Francisco while on their way home and dealing with [[Ashcan and Pete]] and Jack and Ralph.
