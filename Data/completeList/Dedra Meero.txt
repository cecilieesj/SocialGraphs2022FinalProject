'''Lieutenant Dedra Meero''' is one of the antagonists of the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[Andor]]''. She is a supervisor of the [[Galactic Empire]]'s Security Bureo, who collects and analyze intelligence from across the galaxy to identify possible signs of disorder.

==Background==
Methodical, polished, and ambitious, Supervisor Meero embodies the ideals of the Imperial Security Bureau. She is ever vigilant. Her ingenuity serves her well, climbing the ranks by piecing together a clear picture of [[Rebel Alliance|rebel]] activity from disparate parts.

===Physical appearance===
Supervisor Meero is a human female with fair skin and blonde hair that she wears in a tight bun at the back of her head. On duty, Meero dons the signature white uniform of the Security Bureau along with black boots. She has three blue squares on her rank insignia plaque, as well as a pair of code cylinders. In addition to her uniform, Meero also fashions a cream-white overcoat, a black kepi, and black gloves.
