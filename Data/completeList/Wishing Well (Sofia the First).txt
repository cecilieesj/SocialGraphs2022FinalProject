{{Quote|Give me your riches and I will grant you three wishes.|The Wishing Well requesting riches before granting wishes}}
The '''Wishing Well''' is a magical sentient well that appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Well]]", voiced by [[Keith Ferguson]]. It is capable of granting people three wishes by tossing "their riches" into the well. However, the well can easily misunderstand what the wisher wishes for.

[[King Roland II|Roland]] made a poor first wish in it once, which he prefers to tell [[Princess Amber|Amber]] and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] about at another time after he uses his second wish to turn Sofia from a cat back into a human. Amber wasted her three wishes by first asking for a new tiara, making Roland allergic to Sofia, which turned Sofia into a cat, and wishing Sofia wasn't a purple cat in an attempt to break the spell, which only turned Sofia pink. After the well is locked up, [[Clover]] finds it and wishes for a lifetime supply of radishes, which causes him to be buried in an avalanche of vegetables.

The well also has a face that looks like a sun with a creepy, ventriloquist's dummy-like smile and speaks in a soft, robotic voice. It appears that the well's concept of "riches" depends on the potential recipient's idea of value, as it accepted Clover's offer of a carrot in return of his wish.

In "[[Forever Royal]]", it is revealed in a flashback that Roland's first wish in the wishing well was to have a family with his wife, and his wish was granted when his wife gave birth to [[Princess Amber|Amber]] and [[Prince James|James]]. Unfortunately, shortly after their children were born, Roland's wife fell ill and passed away, perhaps implying that her death was the price Roland paid for his first wish.

*The well's voice and some of the phrases it uses are evocative of HAL-3000 from ''2001: A Space Odyssey.''
