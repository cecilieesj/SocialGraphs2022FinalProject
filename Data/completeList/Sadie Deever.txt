While working, Agent Deever is sent footage of a [[Ms. Marvel|young cosplayer]] at AvengerCon, using powers. She brings it to the attention of her colleague, [[Agent Cleary]], and showcases the video, adding that she's never seen powers like that. Cleary watches the clip and reports to Deever, to bring the young individual in.

[[Damage Control]] bring in [[Zoe Zimmer]], the young girl being saved by the masked individual, to determine what she knows, about her identity. Deever enters, in the middle of Cleary's interrogation, and figures out that the target is of south asian descent. Cleary calls her over, to announce a tri-state sweep, searching in every temple, community centre and mosque, though asks that she be respectful, as the FBI are already surveilling them. Deever accepts the order, and leaves to get ready.

Drones acquired by Damage Control are used to determine the enhanced's location. They manage to track her, exiting an alley, where Agent Deever is waiting, with a team full of men. She orders to freeze, but the powered individual creates platforms to run above the team. Deever's men fire a weapon, which emits a blast that shatters her constructs, but the individual manages to evade capture, and escapes from their sights.

Following their encounter with the enhanced, Deever and her men arrive at the Islamic Masjid of Jersey City, where the powered individual was cited. She enters the building and reports why they've arrived to [[Sheikh Abdullah]]. He denies any such person is operating from the building, and asks that refer anyone who can fly, to help clean out the gutters. She commands her men to search the premises, but [[Nakia Bahadir]] intervenes and prevents them from doing so, as they don't have a warrant. Agent Deever warns upon the seriousness of the matter, and advises that it would be in their best interest to cooperate, but the Sheikh asks she return with a warrant. Before she leaves, he asks that next time she return, she remove her shoes.
