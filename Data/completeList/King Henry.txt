'''King Henry''' is the overarching antagonist of the [[2014]] live-action film of ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]''. He attempted to conquer the [[Moors]] with his army, but was thwarted by [[Maleficent]] and the [[Forest Army]]. He was introduced as the main antagonist (only to be replaced by [[King Stefan]] after his death).

==Appearances==
===''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]''===
King Henry was a ruthless king who desired to take over the Moors, and led a large army of knights and soldiers in an attempt to conquer it all. But Maleficent, who lived there, stood up to him as the forest's fiercest defender and rallied an army of tree-men like warriors to drive back his forces.

King Henry becomes wounded in battle, but manages to briefly wound Maleficent when he pushes her back with his iron gauntlet. On his deathbed, the King demands to be avenged and promises whoever kills Maleficent shall become the new king of his country and marry his daughter Lelia. Stefan takes the task by pretending he killed her  to claim the throne for himself. He just ends up stealing Maleficent's wings, however King Henry believes his lie and declares him his new sucessor, who is crowned king after his death.

==Trivia==
*He was created solely for ''Maleficent'' and has no animated counterpart, but his design seem inspired by [[King Hubert]], who has however a completely different personality.
