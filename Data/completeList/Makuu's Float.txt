They are led by [[Makuu]] and formerly led by [[Pua (The Lion Guard)|Pua]]. They served as antagonists in season 1 and a reformed float in season 2.

==History==
For many years, the float was under the leadership of Pua, who was held in high esteem by the [[Pridelanders]] and the inhabitants of the [[Pride Lands]]. One day, a younger crocodile named Makuu, who was disdainful of Pua's peaceful and patient ways, challenged him to a Mashindano. As per tradition, the Mashindano took place at sunset. Despite Pua having more experience and much better techniques, Makuu's youth ensured that he had strength and much more stamina on his side ensuring his victory enabling him to become leader of the float.
