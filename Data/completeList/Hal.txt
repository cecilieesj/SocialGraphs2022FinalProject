'''Hal''' is a character in the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''. He also makes a cameo in both ''[[Ratatouille]]'' and ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''.   
==Role in the film==
He is a cockroach that is [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]]'s friend and pet. Hal is extremely resistant, as he manages to not only survive the devastated near-lifeless Earth, but also getting stepped on by WALL-E and shot by [[EVE]] without suffering harm.

Hal likes eating Kremies as his food. He stays on Earth when WALL-E leaves the planet because WALL-E orders him to do so.

After the [[Axiom]] landed on Earth, Hal quickly approached the broken WALL-E and EVE, and returned to WALL-E's transport vehicle.
