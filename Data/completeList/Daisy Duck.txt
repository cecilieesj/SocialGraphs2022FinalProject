{{Quote|I don’t like magic anymore. I wanna go shopping!|Daisy Duck|House of Magic}}
'''Daisy Duck''' is an anthropomorphic duck who first appeared in the [[1940]] short, ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''. A stylish prima-donna, Daisy is the girlfriend of [[Donald Duck]], and the best friend of [[Minnie Mouse]]. Though she often scolds Donald over his anger issues, Daisy has an explosive temper of her own with more self-control. However, she generally suppresses her eccentricities in attempts to exude elegance and savoir-faire.

[[1937]]'s cartoon ''[[Don Donald]]'' saw an early precursor of Daisy in the form of '''[[Donna Duck]]''', who bore similar physical features and even had Daisy's temperament. The character would be renamed and refined in 1940 with the release of ''Mr. Duck Steps Out''. Daisy would continue to appear in cartoons throughout the following decades, even playing the lead role in shorts like ''[[Sleepy Time Donald]]'' and ''[[Donald's Dilemma]]''—both released in [[1947]]. In the [[1990]]s and early [[2000]]s, Daisy would be fleshed out to have more of a comedic edge, with shows like ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and ''[[House of Mouse]]'' implementing a sassy and somewhat vain side to Daisy's personality.

Today, Daisy is one of Disney's most prominent characters. She appears as a member of the [[The Sensational Six|Sensational Six]], featuring alongside [[Mickey Mouse]], Minnie, Donald, [[Goofy]], and [[Pluto]] in multiple facets of the company including animation, merchandise, and theme parks.

==Background==
===Personality===
Daisy is shown to be a loving and caring girlfriend, who is always there for Donald and encourages him to change his ways for the better. She has faith that her boyfriend is a good person despite his flaws, and uses their relationship as a means to better Donald's life, specifically with regard to his temper.<ref>"[[Donald's Double Trouble]]"</ref><ref>"[[Donald's Dinner Date]]"</ref> She has even been known to hype Donald up to Minnie and the others.<ref>"[[Captain Donald]]"</ref> Even so, Daisy has been guilty of unleashing the same kind of rage whenever something upsets her in some way.<ref>"[[Cured Duck]]"</ref>

In later years, Daisy's personality was expanded, evolving into a fun-loving, and fashion-forward diva. Compared to the rest of the classic Disney cast, Daisy is rather worldly and contemporary, both in how she behaves and even down to the way she speaks.<ref>"[[Duck the Halls: A Mickey Mouse Christmas Special|Duck the Halls]]"</ref> She enjoys fashion and shopping above all else. Although Daisy is usually well-mannered and sophisticated, she can be a bit eccentric and overbearing at times.<ref>"[[Daisy's Road Trip]]"</ref> Daisy's bombastic and talkative nature can occasionally annoy her friends, who sometimes feel suffocated by her presence. She is extroverted and enjoys spending time with her friends, sometimes having a difficult time suppressing her excitement when she socializes with them.<ref>"[[Daisy Bothers Minnie]]"</ref> Still, as mentioned, Daisy is generally level-headed and mature, especially when needing to balance out the more cartoony hijinks of the others.<ref>''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers|The Three Musketeers]]''</ref><ref>"[[The Adorable Couple]]"</ref>

Like Donald, she has a love for attention. This is most notably seen in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', where Daisy was obsessed with getting a chance to perform at the club.<ref>"[[Ladies' Night]]"</ref><ref>"[[Where's Minnie?]]"</ref> Unlike Donald, who stooped to underhanded deeds to steal the spotlight from Mickey, Daisy was determined to earn her stardom, believing her "big break" should be based solely on her talents, and was heartbroken when Donald (albeit well-intentionally) tried to pay Mickey to get Daisy to perform.<ref>"[[Rent Day]]"</ref> Daisy can, however, feel envious toward others that have the attention she craves. For example, when Minnie became the apparent starlight of an ice-skating show, Daisy's obsession with the spotlight drove her to attempt to sabotage Minnie's performance. In spite of this, Daisy soon realizes that friendship is more important than fame. After her schemes nearly injured Minnie, Daisy apologized for her selfish behavior and admitted to her shortcomings.<ref>''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas|Belles on Ice]]''</ref> In "[[Daisy's Debut]]", Daisy was finally given a chance to perform on stage in a duet with Mickey, but after realizing Minnie was longing for quality time with her boyfriend, Daisy willingly dropped out so that Minnie would take her place, proving that she can be selfless and even sacrificial.

===Physical appearance===
Daisy is like a female counterpart of Donald. She is a white duck with an orange bill, legs, and feet. She usually has lavender eye shadow, long distinct eyelashes, and ruffled feathers around her lowest region to suggest a skirt. Like Donald, she typically doesn't wear pants, although she sometimes wears an actual skirt or longer dresses and clothes to cover her bottom.

She's usually seen sporting a blouse with puffed short sleeves and a V-neckline. She also wears a matching bow, heeled shoes, and a single bangle on her left wrist. The colors of her clothes change very often, but her signature colors are usually purple and pink. In comic series, while she also wears pink, she mainly later wears red with black.

The television series ''[[Quack Pack]]'' gave Daisy Duck a more mature wardrobe and hairstyle and cast her as a career woman with a television reporter job. ''[[House of Mouse]]'' got her a blue and purple employee uniform, with a blue bow, and a long ponytail. In ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', Daisy regained her purple blouse with a purple bow and shoes. She also wears a gold bangle and has a short ponytail, similar to the longer one seen in ''House of Mouse''. It was used again in ''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]'' while not working at Mickey’s garage. While working, she would wear a blue shirt with dark pants and a red bandanna tied around her head.

In the new ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' animated TV series, Daisy wears her trademark blouse in a pink and matching bow. She also sports a pair of white boots with pink daisy designs on the outer sides of them.

In the ''DuckTales'' reboot, Daisy's hair is in a bun with a black ribbon similar to her appearance from ''[[Donald's Diary]]'' and she wears black shoes with bows. Her eyelids, which are usually magenta colored, were a shade of green. In her debut, she wore an overcoat with her traditional pink while wearing a blue and green sparkling dress with a black strap. Her main clothing is a long pink sleeveless dress with a thin dark pink strap.

===Family===
Daisy’s first known relatives were three triplet nieces called [[April, May, and June]] (the female counterparts to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]), who were created by [[Carl Barks]] and made their debut in ''[[Flip Decision]]'' (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #149). In the same story, Daisy visits her sister, the mother of her nieces, who remained unseen. [[Daisy's parents]] first appeared in ''[[Donald's Diary]]''. Huey, Dewey, and Louie appeared as her brothers. Daisy has a number uncles, aunts, and cousins as well as other relatives and decedents in the comics series. Daisy has a cousin from [[Brazil]] named Almanda de Quack introduced in the ''Roadster Racers'' series. Daisy's grandmother Lily appears in the ''Mixed-Up Adventures'' series, who she calls her Gramquacker Lily.

==History==
===1937-1940===
[[File:dondonald2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Daisy's precursor, [[Donna Duck]], as seen in ''Don Donald''.]]

The history of Daisy in animation can be traced to the appearance of her precursor, '''[[Donna Duck]]''', in the cartoon short ''[[Don Donald]]'', directed by Ben Sharpsteen. The plot had Donald courting Donna somewhere in Mexico. His efforts are frustrated and Donna leaves him alone and rides away in her unicycle near the finale. The short is important for introducing a love interest for Donald, but one should note that Donna had little in common with Daisy other than both being female ducks and sharing a temper. Donna was more or less a female version of Donald both in design and voice. Her voice was provided by [[Clarence Nash]] and was a slightly higher version of that of Donald. Donna was not intended as a recurring character and the Donald shorts of the following three years featured no female companion for him.

===1940-1950===
[[File:168963 202331669781647 151177044897110 860162 488023 n.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Daisy's first appearance (as Daisy) in ''Mr. Duck Steps Out''.]]
Daisy first appeared with her familiar name and design in ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' ([[June 7]], [[1940]]). The short was directed by [[Jack King]] and scripted by Carl Barks. Here, Donald visits the house of his new love interest for their first known date. At first, Daisy acts shy and has her back turned to her visitor. But Donald soon notices her tail feathers taking the form of a hand and signaling for him to come closer. But their time alone is soon interrupted by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] who have followed their uncle and out of jealousy compete with him for the attention of Daisy. Uncle and nephews take turns dancing the jitterbug with her while trying to get rid of each other. In their final effort, the three younger Ducks feed their uncle maize in the process of becoming popcorn. The process is completed within Donald himself who continues to move wildly around the house while maintaining the appearance of dancing. The short ends with an impressed Daisy showering her new lover with kisses. In this short, her voice is still like Donna's, a "duck voice" similar to Donald's but pitched higher, which was provided by Clarence Nash.

The short stands out among other Donald shorts of the period for its use of modern music and surreal situations throughout. The idea of a permanent love interest of Donald was well established following it. But Daisy did not appear as regularly as Donald himself. Her next appearance in ''[[A Good Time for a Dime]]'' ([[May 9]], [[1941]]) features her as one of the temptations threatening to separate Donald from his money.

The short ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'', directed by Riley Thompson and released on [[June 20]], 1941, featured [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] in a 1890s setting. Daisy made a cameo following [[Goofy]] and alongside Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This was an indication that Daisy was already a permanent addition to Donald's supporting cast.

However, she would make no further animated appearances until ''[[Donald's Crime]]'' ([[June 29]], [[1945]]). The short featured Donald arranging a date with Daisy at a nightclub but not having enough money to pay for it. He proceeds to take $1.35 from the piggy bank of his nephews. The crime of the title is theft and the rest of the short focused on Donald feeling guilty. His own imagination provided increasingly disturbing and nightmarish visions of the possible repercussions of his actions and resulted in Donald resolving to return the money. Starting from this short, Daisy was given a normal voice, as opposed to the "duck voice" of Donald's.

[[File:Http-//24.media.tumblr.com/e9e17a3662f3be122c413d5aa45cd07f/tumblr mj7fzp0K8U1r3jmn6o1 500.png.jpg|thumb|250px|Daisy in ''Cured Duck''.]]
Her second appearance in the same year was in ''[[Cured Duck]]'' ([[October 26]], 1945). The short starts simply enough. Donald visits Daisy at her house. She asks him to open a window. He keeps trying to pull it open and eventually goes into a rage. By the time Daisy returns to the room, Donald has wrecked it. She demonstrates that the locking mechanism was on and criticizes his temper. Daisy refuses to date Donald again until he learns to manage his anger. She claims Donald does not see her losing her own temper. Donald agrees to her terms and follows the surreal method of mail ordering an "insult machine", a device constantly hurling verbal and physical insults at him. He endures the whole process until feeling able to stay calm throughout it. He visits Daisy again and this time calmly opens the window. But when Daisy shows her boyfriend her new hat, his reaction is uncontrollable laughter. Daisy goes into a rage of her own and the short ends by pointing out that Donald is not the only duck in need of anger management training. There is a continuation regarding her temper in "[[Donald's Dinner Date]]" from ''Mickey Mouse Works'' where she and Donald have a date in a restaurant wherein they both end up with a bad temper due to bad customer service.

Their relationship problems were also focused on ''[[Donald's Double Trouble]]'' ([[June 28]], [[1946]]). This time Daisy criticizes his poor command of the English language and his less-than-refined manners. Unwilling to lose Daisy, Donald has to find an answer to the problem. But his solution involves his own look-alike who happens to have all the desired qualities. His unnamed look-alike happens to be unemployed at the moment and agrees to this plan. Donald provides the money for his dates with Daisy but soon comes to realize the look-alike serves as a rival suitor. The rest of the short focuses on his increasing jealousy and efforts to replace the look-alike during the next date. However, a failed attempt at a tunnel of love results in the two male Ducks exiting the tunnel in each other's hands by mistake. Daisy walks out all wet. She jumps up and down and sounds like a record played too fast as Donald and his look-alike run away.

Daisy makes a mere cameo in ''[[Dumbell of the Yukon]]'' (August 30, 1946), but she once again factors on the motivation of Donald. This time he was hunting [[bear]]s in Yukon, Canada in order to provide Daisy with a fur coat. The cameo involves his daydream of her pleased reaction.

Her next appearance in ''[[Sleepy Time Donald]]'' ([[May 9]], [[1947]]) involved Daisy attempting to rescue sleepwalking Donald from wandering into danger. The Donald is loose in an urban environment and the humor results from the problems Daisy herself suffers while trying to keep him safe.

[[File:Daisyfeature.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Daisy in ''Donald's Dilemma''.]]
Daisy was also the actual protagonist of ''[[Donald's Dilemma]]'' (July 11, 1947). The short starts simply enough. Donald and Daisy are out on a date when a flowerpot falls on his head. He regains consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. Both his speaking and singing voices have been improved to the point of being able to enter a new career as a professional singer. He also acts more refined than usual. Most importantly Donald suffers from partial amnesia and has no memory of Daisy. Donald goes on becoming a well-known crooner and his rendition of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" becomes a hit. He is surrounded by female fans in his every step. Meanwhile, Daisy can not even approach her former lover and her loss results in a number of psychological symptoms. Various scenes feature her suffering from anorexia, insomnia, and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and contemplating various methods of suicide. She narrates her story to a psychologist who determines that Donald would regain his memory with another flower pot falling on his head but warns that his improved voice may also be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer, but Daisy loses him, or Daisy regains her Donald, but the world loses him. Posed with the question "her or the world", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream of "Me, Me, Me!". Soon Donald returns to his old self and forgets about his career. His fans forget about him. But Daisy regained her lover again. This is considered a darkly humorous look at their relationship.

Donald also faces problems resulting from his own voice in ''[[Donald's Dream Voice]]'' (May 21, [[1948]]). He works as a door-to-door salesman but his customers do not understand a word he is saying. His attempts at politeness are misinterpreted and customers react angrily to imagined insults. But Daisy convinces him otherwise "Don't give up! I have faith in you!" His problems seem to end when Donald buys a box of "voice pills", a medicine temporarily improving his voice. He gets confident enough in his newfound voice to prepare his marriage proposal for Daisy. But due to an accident, he loses all but one of his pills. The rest of the short features his frustrated attempt to regain this last pill in order to propose to her. Something which he is eventually unable to do. After a few minutes of trying to get it, the pill ends up getting swallowed by a cow and makes it able to talk. And tells Donald he can't understand what he's saying. Donald then throws a tantrum.

===1950-present===
Daisy did not appear again until ''[[Crazy Over Daisy]]'' ([[March 24]], [[1950]]). The short took place in a 1890s setting, exactly like ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]''. At first, Donald seems in a good mood and on his way to his date with Daisy. But when [[Chip and Dale]] start ridiculing his appearance the short results in one of their typical fights. Interrupted in the end by Daisy herself who accuses Donald of being cruel to the two "innocent" chipmunks, completely unaware of what really happened between Donald and the two chipmunks. The short ends with Donald having to forget about that date.

[[File:Http-//24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr lxv7taJ4sI1r3jmn6o1 500.png.jpg|thumb|250px|Daisy and Donald in ''Donald's Diary'']]
Daisy's next animated appearance was in the aforementioned ''[[Donald's Diary]]'' ([[March 5]], [[1954]]). There she is portrayed as a young lady who manages to start a long-term relationship with Donald. But after having a nightmare about the anxieties that would come from married life, Donald runs out on her and joins the French Foreign Legion. Several scenes of the short imply that Daisy has had several previous relationships with men. Donald carves their names on a tree. Not noticing that the opposing side of the tree features her name alongside that of several other boyfriends. The marriage scene in Donald's dream featured a group of sailors waving goodbye to Daisy and mourning the loss of their apparent lover. Unlike other cartoons, in this cartoon Daisy has pink feathers (pale yellowish-pink feathers in some old unrestored TV/video versions) as opposed to white feathers like Donald and other ducks.

Daisy's last appearance before her comeback was in ''[[How to Have an Accident at Work]]'', where she plays as Donald's unnamed wife and the mother of their [[Donald's son|unnamed son]].

Daisy's return to theatrical animation came in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (October 20, [[1983]]). She was cast as Isabelle, the romantic partner of a young Ebenezer Scrooge (played [[Scrooge McDuck]]). This was also the first time she and Donald appeared separate and not together. In [[1988]], Daisy appeared alongside Minnie, Donald, and Mickey at the 60th Academy Awards ceremony. In [[2012]], Daisy briefly appeared toward the end of ''[[Electric Holiday]]'', a short starring Minnie.

==Films==
===''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]''===
[[File:DisneyEnchantedPDVD 043.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Daisy in ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas''.]]
Daisy plays a supporting role in the film. Daisy first appears in the segment "Donald Duck: Stuck on Christmas" where Huey, Dewey, and Louie wish for Christmas every day. In the segment, Daisy attempts to kiss Donald under the mistletoe, only for their chance to be ruined by the boys, but the boys were able to undone that part during the loophole by putting them under the mistletoe and making them kiss happily with no disturbance and make Christmas dinner for the family, that the boys also helped served towards the table, which she noted is her favorite part of Christmas. Daisy later appears in the last segment "Gift of the Magi" where she works with Minnie in Mortimer Mouse's department store. In this segment, Daisy seems to be far younger as the story may possibly take place in the past. Also in this segment, Daisy has blue eyes as opposed to her usual black. She then appears at the end of the film singing Christmas carols with Mickey and friends.

===''[[Fantasia 2000]]''===
[[File:Fantasia2000-disneyscreencaps.com-6607.jpg|thumb|250px|Daisy in ''Fantasia 2000''.]]
She was featured alongside Donald in the "[[Pomp and Circumstance|Noah's Ark]]" segment of ''Fantasia 2000''. Here, Daisy resides with Donald in their own hub and prepares to board the giant ark to save themselves from the global flood coming their way. While Daisy is boarding the ark, she notices some mice about to get stepped on by [[Colonel Hathi]], until Daisy grabs them. While Donald is loading the animals, he fails to notice Daisy boarding the ark and believes she's still in the hub just as the storm approaches He rushes to save her while Daisy sees him through a window of the ark and sees Donald and a huge wave. She covers her eyes to prevent herself from seeing Donald's death. She fails to notice that Donald jumped onto the ark at the last minute. As Daisy is on the second floor and Donald on the first, they never see each other the entire ark ride and believe each other dead. When the flood clears up, Daisy and the other passengers leave the ark when Daisy finds her love locket to be missing. It was recovered by Donald and as Daisy reaches out for it, she and Donald both find out that each other were still alive. The two reunited as Daisy kisses Donald and lived happily ever after in their new home. 

This is the only time she was voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] (who voiced Minnie Mouse until 2019) who did her one scream when Mickey accidentally enters her dressing room while looking for Donald before the segment started.

===''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]''===
[[File:Threemusketeers 381.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Daisy as she appears in ''Mickey, Donald and Goofy: The Three Musketeers''.]]
Daisy is Princess Minnie's lady-in-waiting and close friend. Daisy secretly believes Minnie's fantasy of true love is a little ridiculous and believes a princess should be practical. After Captain [[Pete]] hires Mickey, Donald, and Goofy as musketeers to protect Minnie and Daisy she is thought to be a bad guy and attacked after things are set straight, she sees Donald developed a crush, but she is not interested until the end. Later, Daisy and Minnie are kidnapped by the [[Beagle Boys]] as part of Pete's plans to become king but are saved by Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. At the grand opera, Daisy and Minnie have been attacked again, but this time the Beagle Boys are accompanied by Pete. They are rescued and she reveals her love for Donald, which surprises Minnie when asked her if she is kissing commoner. Daisy happily admits as she continues to kissing Donald and the two are presumed married after the events of the film. This is the only time she is seen with blonde hair as her other appearances will show her with white hair.

===''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''===
[[File:Twiceuponaxmas 385.jpg|thumb|250px||Daisy in ''Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas''.]]
Daisy reappears in the sequel with a larger role. Daisy first appears in the first segment ''Belles on Ice'' where she is a contestant in an ice skating tournament. One of the other contestants is Minnie, who proves to be a glamorous skater with only a few seconds in during her run. Daisy becomes jealous of Minnie's acclaim and begins to steal the light by heading onto the ice and impressing the judges. Minnie begins to become more advanced with her moves, using the alligators from ''[[Fantasia]]''. Daisy decides to pull out her secret weapons, the hippos from ''Fantasia''. After many incredible stunts, Minnie accidentally trips on a bell. Realizing her mistake, Daisy rushes to her side and regrets her actions as Minnie shows how foolish they've been acting as the two apologize to each for their actions and Daisy is sorry for her bad attitude as she helps Minnie get up. Minnie gladly accepts and the friends perform a grand finale stunt, spelling the words Peace on Earth as they wish each other a merry Christmas and hug. Daisy is later seen in ''Christmas: Impossible'', celebrating Christmas with Donald and his family at Scrooge's house. In ''Donald's Gift'', Daisy and the boys try to show Donald what Christmas spirit is. Lastly, Daisy has seen aside with the rest of the cast, attending to Mickey's normal Christmas party.

===Other films===
Daisy made a cameo alongside several Disney characters in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. She was seen at the very end when the toons begin heading back to [[Toontown]].

==Television==
===''[[Quack Pack]]''===
[[File:Daisy-QuackPack.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Daisy as she appeared in ''Quack Pack''.]]
Daisy curiously never appeared on ''[[DuckTales]]'', but she was a regular in ''[[Quack Pack]]''. 

In ''Quack Pack'', Daisy is presented as a much more assertive and mature woman and is working as a reporter for a local television news-magazine "''What in the World?''", with Donald serving as both her boyfriend and the show's cameraman. Despite working underneath head anchorman Kent Powers, Daisy is a far more capable reporter, a fact that often leaves Kent feeling threatened. She also has a pet iguana named Knuckles who seems to be a brainless omnivore who blithely goes about eating anything from automobile upholstery to priceless works of art. Despite her heightened maturity, Daisy is prone to flights of fantasy, which often lead Donald to disaster in the name of assisting her. Unlike the other series, she and Donald have a steadier and better relationship, although she is still often annoyed with his jealously of her with other men and that he is not always there when she needs him.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===
[[File:Daisy2 4204.jpg|thumb|Daisy as she appeared in ''Mickey Mouse Works''.|alt=|250x250px]]
Daisy is a main character in the show and for the first time gets her own series of cartoons. Unlike most of her previous appearances, Daisy is wild, wacky, ignorant and somewhat childish. She often unknowingly annoys Minnie, Mickey, and Donald. In most of her cartoons, she has a comical time with Minnie who in contrast to her is more mature. Aside from this, in some episodes, she is similar to the earlier cartoons. She is often the subject of Donald's affections as he tries to please her the best way he can. For the series, she resides in a beach house.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:Houseofmousedaisy.png|thumb|250px|Daisy as she appeared in ''House of Mouse''.|alt=|left]]
Daisy is the club's reservation clerk. Like Donald, Daisy craves the spotlight and constantly asks Mickey to perform, which he usually denies. On some occasions during an emergency, Daisy does perform, and it's often hated by the Disney character audience when improperly performed. Daisy is also a big fan of [[Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. In a related topic, she often gets starstruck when special guests attend the club often trying to get their autograph before the night's over. Several episodes revolved around Daisy and her antics. She was finally given her debut chance in "[[Daisy's Debut]]" but gave up her chance when she realized how Minnie wanted to work closely with Mickey. She also performed a parody of [[The Enchanted Tiki Room]] theme entitled ''[[The Daisy Duckie Room|The Enchanted Daisy Room]]'' in "[[Suddenly Hades]]", and performed a parody of ''[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]'' entitled ''[[Daisy Crockett]]'' in "[[Where's Minnie?]]" In "[[House of Magic]]", Daisy, wanting to go into magic, practices sorcery and accidentally makes the House of Mouse, and all its guests disappear. In the end, [[Jafar]] and [[Iago]] restore the club and guests.

Daisy also appears in the spin-off films ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===
[[File:Daisy Duck - Minnierella.png|thumb|250px|Daisy, as she appears in ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse''.|alt=]]
Daisy also stars in the CGI series starring Mickey Mouse. Daisy is one of the main characters. She is still the girlfriend of Donald and obsessed with fashion as always. She joins Mickey on many adventures and tries to keep Donald's temper at bay. Many episodes revolve around Daisy. One of the most notable is "[[Secret Spy Daisy]]". In the episode, Pete plots to steal Clarabelle's secret cookie recipe and Professor Ludwig Von Drake alerts Daisy of the situation. She becomes her spy alias and teams up with Mickey and Minnie to foil Pete. She would later become Secret Spy Daisy on occasion and team up with Minnie's alter ego, Detective Minnie. Another episode centering around Daisy is "[[The Golden Boo-Boo]]". In this episode, Daisy becomes Daisy O'Dare in order to retrieve a legendary golden statue known as The Golden Boo-Boo. However, trouble arises when she must compete against the thieving Safari Pete.

In ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'', Daisy joins Minnie in her new bow business known as Minnie's Bow-Tique as her partner. Here, Daisy and Minnie open a shop where they sell different types of bows. As seen in the first episode "Leaky Pipes", Daisy has yet to master the "art" of bow tying as Minnie did. Daisy can be rather often lazy in comparison to Minnie's hardworking stature and because of this, she sometimes tries to find faster ways to get her work done, but this often causes more problems and trouble.

===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===
[[File:Daisy render.PNG|220px|Daisy as she appears in ''Mickey Mouse''.|alt=|left]]
In this animated series, Daisy returns with the rest of her friends in all-new adventures. Like in previous roles, Daisy is presented as fairly mature, though still sassy.

She first appears in the episode "[[No Service]]", where she and Minnie are set to have a picnic on the beach with Donald and Mickey. However, the short ends with Donald accidentally becoming nude in public, embarrassing Daisy to the point where the picnic ends up going on without Donald.

In "[[Croissant de Triomphe]]", Minnie and Daisy work at a French café in [[Paris]], though things go wrong when they run out of their signature croissants, forcing Mickey to travel around the famous city to deliver them to Minnie.

The first episode in which she had a big/significant role is in "[[The Adorable Couple]]". In this episode, Mickey and Minnie try to make Donald and Daisy happy.

In "[[Captain Donald]]", Daisy, Mickey, and Minnie were very excited to set sail on Donald's boat, much to Donald's dismay. It was revealed in the same episode that Daisy bought a sailor outfit for Donald because she likes a man in uniform.

Daisy made a cameo appearance as a bridesmaid at Goofy's "wedding" at the end of "[[Goofy's First Love]]".

In "[[No Reservations]]", Daisy with [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] and [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] attempt to get into the hottest, yet most impossibly booked restaurant in town.

In "[[Split Decisions]]", Daisy does not actually appear but is heavily mentioned: the reason Mickey wants [[Ludwig Von Drake]] to solve Donald's temper problems is that Daisy has had enough of it and is threatening to leave him if he does not find a cure. Later, when the attempt to cure Donald has gone horribly wrong, Mickey dreams about and interacts with an imaginary Daisy being mad at him for what he's done to Donald.

In "[[Duck the Halls: A Mickey Mouse Christmas Special]]", Daisy and Donald are to migrate to the south for the winter with Scrooge McDuck, Ludwig Von Drake, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. At the last minute, Donald chooses to stay behind to celebrate Christmas. Daisy believes he'll join her soon as ducks cannot survive through winter, but she and the others become increasingly worried the longer they wait. After a call to check, Daisy learns that Donald is gravely ill. Determined to save her lover, she rallies Scrooge, Ludwig, and the triplets to rescue Donald, but he soon arrives in the south safely courtesy of Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Pluto. Though somewhat angry at him with his recklessness and for scaring her when she thought he was dead for a moment, Daisy was happy to have her beau back alive as she missed him so much and is relieved that Donald is safe. This special also proves the duck's relationship even stronger than ever and that Daisy loves Donald even more.

Daisy plays a mirror in "[[The Scariest Story Ever: A Mickey Mouse Halloween Spooktacular]]", where she and Minnie only appeared at the near end of the special. She accompanies Minnie to Mickey's when he got scared of Minnie's costume thinking her of the witch from his story.

Despite her role as one of the main characters in the series, Daisy made very few appearances yet still important roles. Although she still has her role as a protagonist and having her maturity, Daisy also has a role as an antagonist, and she was shown to also be a cheater as shown in "[[Three-Legged Race]]" and "[[Two Can't Play]]" unlike any of the other shows.

===''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]''===
Daisy appears in the madcap racing series, with a transforming roadster known as the "Purple Snapdragon", which is modeled after the snapdragon plant. She also stars alongside Minnie in the second part episodes centered around their local "Happy Helpers" hotline business. Much like in ''Minnie's Bow Toons'', Daisy is constantly portrayed as less adept at her job than Minnie, and often gets the worst of the duo's bad luck.

===''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''===
Daisy appeared in the series as a major character. In the series, she has become fed up with Donald’s time tables tardiness , even though she’s jumping to conclusions, so she, as usual, temporarily dumps him he got his act together. Through the series, while Donald does everything to get her back, Daisy goes through her extreme lengths to make Donald get his act together. That is, until, she suddenly reacts to Donald’s thought to be demise.

By then, she has lost her patience and was on the verge. When she was to paradise, she witnessed Donald fighting against a giant version of himself and suddenly managed to ease all his rage, much to Daisy’s delight. Afterwards, they witnessed the world at near destruction so Donald heads off toward his destiny but not before giving Daisy a lip to lip kiss.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
[[File:Daisy Duck DuckTales 2017.jpg|thumb|250px|Daisy in the ''DuckTales'' reboot.]]
Though Daisy does not appear in the original ''[[DuckTales]]'', she is reintegrated as a recurring character in the reboot. Her design in this show is heavily influenced by her appearance in ''[[Donald's Diary]]'', but with white feathers like the other duck characters.

She first appears in the episode "[[Louie's Eleven!]]", where she works as a stage organizer for [[Emma Glamour]] with dreams of becoming a designer.  Interestingly, she is the only one who can understand Donald's normal voice perfectly, she enjoys his singing voice, while everyone else starts holding their ears. The series also introduce Daisy and Donald as strangers, with the series chronicling the timeline of their relationship. Daisy meets and falls in love with Donald while trapped inside an elevator. In during which, she reveals her dreams to Donald, who relates to Daisy's desire to be seen. When Glamour's true identity is revealed later on, Daisy and Donald fight against [[Falcon Graves]] and Glamour. Afterwards, Daisy and the nephews, minus Huey, watches Donald, José, and Panchito perform on stage with the problem solved.

Daisy appears again in "[[New Gods on the Block!]]" where she begins her second date with Donald, and they share their first kiss.

In the [[The Last Adventure!|series finale]], she meets Donald's sister [[Della Duck]], who is impressed by Daisy's appearance and relationship with Donald and Daisy also meets Donald's cousins [[Gladstone Gander]] and [[Fethry Duck]]. Fethry, by mistake slips up the news that Donald and Daisy plans to travel around the world together, news Della finds hard to take. Daisy is also part of the team to get ready to storm the [[F.O.W.L.]] base as she, Della, and Donald heard the partyblower for cake time for [[Webby Vanderquack]]'s birthday, they nodded. She watches Webby to blow the candles and waited with [[Gladstone Gander]] and [[Fethry Duck]] to watch them into the ball pit that leads to the F.O.W.L. base. Later Donald called her to bring May and June.

===Other shows===
Daisy has made a few cameos in the long-running [[Walt Disney anthology series]], as well as a few keys and notable roles in episodes centering Donald such as "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (animation)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]".

Daisy appeared in the ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' opening sequence alongside Minnie. She wears green go-go boots.

==Printed media==
[[File:Daisy67.png|left|thumb|250px|Daisy and her nieces in Carls Barks' ''Flip Decision'' (1953).]]
Donald and Daisy's common last name points to both Donald and Daisy being members of the Duck family. However, in the popular Dutch Disney comic magazine ''Donald Duck Weekly'', issue 44-2013, it is explained that Donald and Daisy are unrelated and "Duck" simply is the [[Duckburg]] universe equal to "Smith", being a common surname.

Donna Duck served as a precursor for Daisy in both animation and comics. She first appeared in a one-page illustration titled "Don Donald" and published in Good Housekeeping #3701 (January 1937). The page was illustrated by Thomas "Tom" Wood (1870s - October 4, 1940) who was head of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]' publicity department from 1933 until his death. She went on to appear in the ''Donald and Donna'' comic strip published in Mickey Mouse Weekly from May 15 to August 21, 1937. The Weekly was a United Kingdom publication and the strip was illustrated at the time by William Arthur Ward. However, her co-starring role was brief.

Daisy made her first comics appearance on November 4, 1940. She was introduced as the new neighbor of Donald and his potential love interest. The Donald Duck comic strip was at the time scripted by Bob Karp and illustrated by Al Taliaferro. She was seemingly soft-spoken but had a fiery temper and Donald often found himself a victim of her rage. For example, one strip had Daisy waiting for Donald to carve their names and their love for each other on a tree. Only to discover the male Duck had carved "Daisy loves Donald" with her name hardly visible and his name in prominent bold letters. Resulting in her breaking her "umbrella" on his head and dismissing him as a "conceited little pup".

Her first original comic book appearance was in the story ''The Mighty Trapper'' by Carl Barks, first published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories # 36 (September 1943). However, this was only a cameo when Huey, Dewey, and Louie ask her to lend them an old fur coat. Barks would not use the character again until "Donald Tames His Temper" (January 1946) when Daisy demands that Donald learns to manage his anger as a New Year's resolution. Donald has to agree but points early on that Daisy herself has the temper of a "wild-eyed wildcat".

Her next appearance by Barks in ''Biceps Blues'' (June 1946) introduced a key concept to their relationship. When Daisy seems impressed by a certain type of male, Donald is forced to emulate that type. No matter how unsuited Donald is for emulating it successfully. In this early case, Daisy envies her "old school chum" Susy Swan for dating a notable weightlifter. Donald at first protests that she seems too impressed by a "gorilla" just because the "muscle-bound buffalo" can lift 300 pounds. But when Daisy simply ignores him and daydreams about dating Hercules, Donald decides to start weightlifting. The rest of the story focuses on his ineptitude at exercising and the eventual efforts of Huey, Dewey, and Louie to cheer him up by various tricks pointing to Donald becoming stronger. But when Donald arranges a demonstration for Daisy, Susy, and her boyfriend, their tricks are not able to save him from ridicule. Daisy then chases Donald in anger (whom Donald, in turn, chases Huey, Dewey, and Louie in anger) while Susy boasts about her luck in men to her weightlifter boyfriend, who simply grunts and nods and fails to understand her words. Daisy failed to see that Susy's boyfriend is strong but otherwise not too gifted, whereas Donald is one who would go great lengths for her.

Daisy continued to make frequent appearances in stories by Barks but the next important one for her development was "Wintertime Wager" (January 1948). There she first attempts to act as the voice of reason between competing cousins Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander and in fact manages to prevent Donald losing his house to Gladstone because of a wager. This story established that both of them wanted to be in her good graces. Their next joined meeting in "Gladstone Returns" (August 1948) has Donald and Gladstone competing in raising enough money for her charity effort.

Their rivalry increased when "Donald's Love Letters" (December 1949) revealed that both cousins were romantically interested in Daisy. From then on many stories by both Barks and others would develop around this love triangle. Daisy in turns dates both of them but this fact does not prevent the two competing suitors from attempting to earn more of her affection or trying to embarrass each other in front of her. Daisy can be counted on to be making regular appearances alongside either of them for several years to come. Often it would appear as if Gladstone had the upper hand in winning Daisy due to his luck, only to find fate thwarts his plans, such as a contest where the man who hunts the most turkeys gets to have dinner with Daisy, who has won a beauty contest. Gladstone wins the turkey hunt but finds himself having dinner with an ugly woman who is the runner-up queen, as Daisy is incapacitated, and Donald is the one nursing her.

Although the vast majority of her appearances were in theses shorter stories, she also had a role in a number of Barks' longer adventure stories, most notably in ''Hall of the Mermaid Queen'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #68), where she accompanies Donald, Uncle Scrooge and the nephews on a dangerous mission in an underwater kingdom, to recover Uncle Scrooge's fortune, after it has sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

Similarly, Daisy's precursor Donna and Daisy herself were featured together as rivals for Donald's affection in a newspaper strip published on August 7, 1951. In her last appearance, on August 11, 1951, Donna had a fiancé, a caricature of Disney cartoonist Manuel Gonzales, establishing a distinction between her character and Daisy.

In the comics, Daisy is also a member of a local gossip group called the "Chit-Chat Society", which plays bridge and sponsors charity fund-raisers. The core membership includes Clarabelle Cow and Clara Cluck, though occasionally some other unnamed characters appear.

In later years, Carl Barks 'modernized' Daisy in two stories: 'The not-so-ancient mariner' and 'Hall of the mermaid queen'. In the first story, Daisy is wearing a lot of different wigs and outfits. Gladstone Gander is also seen wearing a wig and a new wardrobe in the story. In the second story, Daisy has short, curly hair and a bow that is much smaller than usual.

In the 1950s, Disney launched the series "Daisy Duck's Diary", where Daisy was given more of a leading role. This series, originally by such cartoonists as Dick Moores, Jack Bradbury, Tony Strobl and Carl Barks, have continued to the present day in Italy. Daisy also stars in another comic series ''Daisy and Donald'' which centers around the duck couple's relationship and love.

Since 1999 Daisy, like Donald Duck has her own magazine in the Netherlands. She had one in Brazil between 1986 and 1997, and a short-lived series in 2004 with republications of old stories.

The comics feature the duck couple going through all sorts of troubles and rough time through their relationship. Despite having bigger situations in the comics than in the TV series and movies, Daisy's love for Donald is stronger than she thought as she always gets back together with him. No matter what the situations they go through, they just make the two duck's love each other stronger than ever.

===Super Daisy===
Daisy's secret identity, "[[Super Daisy]]" (''"Paperinika"'') has been featured in Italian Disney comics since the early 70s. She was created by Guido Martina and Giorgio Cavazzano as a female counterpart of [[The Duck Avenger]] (''"Paperinik"'').

Super Daisy made her debut in "Paperinika and Ariadne's thread" ([[1973]]). In the comic, [[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]] calls Donald to the Money Bin to receive a top-secret assignment but refuses to reveal the task while Daisy is present, belittling her for being a woman. Angry and repulsed by Uncle Scrooge's remark, Daisy recounts the story to Genialina Edy Son, who proposes that Daisy becomes the masked champion of the fairer sex.

Super Daisy has no superpowers but is aided by the gadgets created by Genialina Edy Son, a protégé of [[Gyro Gearloose]].

Super Daisy and Duck Avenger would usually have a rivalry which soon turn into a romantic relationship, with the two ducks unaware of each other's identity and make them think they're cheating their respective lovers.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #1 (published in 1940), Daisy Duck is named Donna in an image that appears based on ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''. The image contains Donald and Daisy, with the text "Donald's got a girl! —and Donna thinks that HE'S just dandy. Because his heart is full of—candy!"
*Like Minnie and Clarabelle, Daisy wears a bow on her head and pumps. However, unlike Minnie and Clarabelle, Daisy doesn't have a dress, as her feathers are ruffled in a way to create a dress. Instead, she wears a shirt that serves as a top.
*According to Don Rosa, Daisy is the sister of Donald's brother-in-law, making her the paternal aunt of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. However, this never turned out to be true but the boys still call her Aunt Daisy in the comics.
