'''Walter''' is a humanoid Muppet who is the main protagonist in the [[2011]] feature film, ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' and one of the main characters in its [[2014]] sequel, ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''. He is sweet, slightly naïve, lacking self-confidence, and is a huge [[The Muppets (franchise)|Muppet]] fan. With his human brother, [[Gary (The Muppets)|Gary]] (played by [[Jason Segel]]), Walter sets out to reunite the Muppets in order to save the [[Muppet Studios (The Muppets)|Muppet Studios]] from destruction.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''With his Kermit T-shirt and watch, Walter is a devoted fan of the Muppets. The lifelong resident of Smalltown, USA, dreams of meeting his heroes one day, and feels that — just maybe — he belongs with them. So, when brother Gary and his girlfriend Mary plan a trip to Los Angeles, Walter joins them with hopes of realizing his dream once and for all.<br />The role marks the big-screen debut for Walter, and one seemingly written for him. “I play Walter, the world’s biggest Muppet fan,” says the star, “which is a real coincidence, since I happen to be the world’s biggest Muppet fan and my name is Walter. It’s like I was made to play this part.”<br />Walter finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time — or is it the right time? — when he overhears evil oil baron Tex Richman discussing a plot to destroy Muppet Studios. With the help of Gary and Mary, it’s Walter who sets the plan in motion to reunite the Muppets and save the studio. His pure-hearted enthusiasm for all things Muppets just might save more than the studio, too.''

===Development===
Walter was named after the first puppet Jason Segel ever owned. In an interview at the World Premiere, Walter claims he was swimming laps at the Beverly Hills Hilton when a talent scout discovered him for the role (he was the only person he could find who was 18 inches tall).

Disney paid Walter roughly the same amount as 67 movie tickets. In a [[2012]] interview with ''Talk Nerdy'', Walter revealed that his last name is Blagojevich (no known relation to Rod Blagojevich). However, he is known simply as "Walter" with the Screen Actors Guild.

The script only specified that Walter had the look of 'an old dishrag' and wore a blue suit. Puppet Heap Workshop president Paul Andrejco drew 14 possible Walters and later 25 different combinations of color and fabric textures.

In an interview with Film Journal International, director James Bobin spoke on Walter's design:

{{quote|We based Walter’s design on the same one they used for Kermit—he’s basically a hand puppet with a more advanced mouth. That design gives the puppeteer’s hand maximum freedom of movement, so with the smallest amount of finger change, he or she can create a huge range of expressions. With a few flicks of his left finger, Peter can make Walter look incredibly different all the time and because the camera is close enough in, you swear you can hear this puppet thinking and that conveys the emotion of the movie.|James Bobin}}

Six puppeteers were considered for the role of Walter during an audition process, but it ended up going to [[Peter Linz]].

===''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''===
Walter was born to a family in [[Smalltown, USA]]. He is unique in the family, as he is the only one that is a puppet. He has a strong bond with his brother Gary. Due to his "condition", he has been shunned his whole life (and he can't grow any taller either). He then discovered ''The Muppet Show'', which gave him hope in life. He stated that he was their "Number one fan." He even dressed up in a Kermit costume for Halloween, but no matter how much the ridicule, he still had hope at the end of the day, all because of the Muppets. He eventually developed the desire to join the group, as revealed in his nightmare.

After almost twenty years have passed, Walter and Gary are still living together in the house they grew up in. They go on a vacation with Gary's girlfriend [[Mary (The Muppets)|Mary]] (who is hoping for Gary to ask her hand in marriage) to Los Angeles to tour the Muppet Studios, where Walter finds out that [[Tex Richman]] has plans to tear down the studio to drill for oil once the Muppets fail to produce the ten million dollars needed to re-purchase the property. Walter tells Gary and Mary of this discovery and they set out to find [[Kermit the Frog]] to warn him of Tex's evil plan. Kermit decides that the only way they could earn enough money is to perform a telethon show. After Kermit brings back most of the Muppets together, the telethon proves to be a bigger success than they had expected. Walter takes the stage for the last act and wins the audience over with his whistling skills. Even though they fail to meet the ten million dollar goal, they still gain massive popularity and Tex Richman lets the Muppets keep their studio and name after suffering a head injury from a bowling ball accidentally thrown by Gonzo. Walter is asked personally by Kermit to join the Muppets, which he accepts. Following this, Walter said farewell to his brother and stayed in Los Angeles when Gary and Mary returned to Smalltown.

===''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''===
Though still a major character in the [[2014]] sequel to ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'', Walter plays a smaller role than he did in the previous film as the only one aside from [[Animal]] who knew [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] was acting weird when [[Constantine]] replaced him. While [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] also notices Constantine's similarities with Kermit, Walter discovers that [[Dominic Badguy]] has been giving away tickets and bribing critics to ensure a packed house and rave reviews for their show. Walter and Fozzie are then attacked by Constantine for their discoveries, but Animal fends him off and all three escape to rescue Kermit. During the performance, Dominic steals a locket from the bank and Constantine proposes to [[Miss Piggy]] onstage; Piggy accepts, and the pair plan a wedding ceremony to be held at the [[Tower of London]] in [[London]], where the Crown Jewels are kept. The rest of the Muppets, including Miss Piggy, feel that there is something off, but cannot place it.
