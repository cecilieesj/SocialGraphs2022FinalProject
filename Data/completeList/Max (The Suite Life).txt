==Story==
Max is a minor character on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. She is one of [[Zack Martin|Zack]] and [[Cody Martin|Cody]]'s friends. She is a tomboy and is sometimes mistaken for a boy (a running gag throughout the series). She once had a crush on Zack as shown in the episode "[[Kisses & Basketball]]", and goes on a date with him. While on the date, she shows a slightly girlier side, but "falls out of love" with Zack when she finds out that he just did it to "take one for the team".

==Appearance ==
Max has shoulder-length brown hair that is styled into two pigtails at the start of the series, in which she hides them with a cap. Later, she lets her hair loose and stops wearing her cap as well. Max's outfits are often more boyish, such as jackets and jeans but she was once shown in a dress during her date with Zack. During the later part of the series, her way of dressing becomes "girlier", and the colors of her jackets are more often than not lighter in color, rather than the usual dark colors like black and gray.

==Personality==
Max is portrayed as a great dancer (as shown in the episodes "[[Footloser]]", "[[Hotel Hangout]]", and "[[Club Twin]]"), but can become extremely bossy at times ("Footloser").  She is very good at hip hop dancing and sports, such as basketball, and is very outgoing. While she is on relatively good terms with the twins, she can also be quite mean towards them, such as when she insults Cody over and over again in the episode "[[Election (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)|Election]]". Over the series, she loses her tomboyish personality and becomes much girlier, though she still retains her love for sports and hip hop dancing.

==Appearances==
Max has appeared in six episodes through two seasons of ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody''. She did not appear in and was not mentioned during ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'', though a few other main characters did.
