'''Koleniko''' is a character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Koleniko serves as [[Davy Jones]]' navigator. Despite his appearance, Koleniko was not as frightening as with many other ''Dutchman'' crew members who had this characteristic.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Koleniko has characteristics of sea creatures - his left arm and shoulder fused with the spines of a pufferfish which would inflate and deflate when breathing.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Koleniko and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Koleniko and the other crew went on it and held his motley crew as prisoners.

Koleniko and the rest of the crew later heave together to get the cannons ready on the ship. During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Koleniko plays the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.

The next day, Koleniko and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Koleniko and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Just as Koleniko and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Koleniko and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. Successfully opening the chest containing the Heart of Davy Jones, Koleniko and the crew fight against Jack's crew just as Jack and his crew plan to escape from the crew and return to the ''Black Pearl''. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Koleniko and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Koleniko returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Koleniko and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Koleniko and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Koleniko and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men only for Jack Sparrow to fight against Davy Jones.

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Koleniko and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==Trivia==
*In an early screenplay of ''Dead Man's Chest'', Koleniko was described having only one eye. For the final version, Koleniko had two eyes like the other crew members, leaving that the other crew members who seemed to have two eyes is [[Maccus]].
