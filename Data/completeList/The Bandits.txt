==Role in the film==
The bandits are an assortment of Indian and Nepalese/Tibetan thugs first seen at an outdoor tavern where [[William Boone|Captain Boone]] and [[Lt. John Wilkins|Lt. Wilkins]] visit [[Buldeo (Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book)|Buldeo]] and [[Tabaqui (Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book)|Tabaqui]] to find out information about the bejeweled dagger from "The Lost City of Hanuman".

They later team up with Boone, Wilkins, [[Sergeant Harley]], Buldeo, and Tabaqui to look for [[Mowgli]] in the jungle so as to capture him and make him lead them to a treasure from a city inhabited by monkeys called "Monkey City." Tabaqui and two bandits are able to spot and capture Mowgli with a net but Mowgli struggles, fights back, and manages to escape.

Later, the bandits ambush [[Colonel Geoffrey Brydon]], his daughter; [[Katherine "Kitty" Brydon|Kitty]], and [[Dr. Julius Plumford]] as they kill a few British soldiers. One British soldier serving as a coachman is seen killing a few bandits but Colonel Brydon is the only one able to shoot a few more dead with his gun until one of them shoots him on the leg.

When Buldeo brutally removes Dr. Plumford from the caravan and is about to kill him with a dagger, Mowgli stops him by pushing him out of the way. Then, Mowgli's wolf friends including [[Grey Brother]] and [[Bagheera]] the black panther join the attack and kill the rest of the bandits while the others flee for their lives. Then, Buldeo and Tabaqui with some remaining bandits flee with Kitty and her father taken as hostages. Only two bandits, one Indian and one Sherpa, remain to attack Mowgli - the Indian one is overpowered and pushed aside and the Sherpa is bitten and then knocked unconscious when Mowgli throws him against a tree. 

The bandits are not seen throughout the rest of the movie after this. It can be assumed that the ones Mowgli defeated and the ones that ran away for their lives were killed and probably eaten by Mowgli's animal friends or [[Shere Khan]] in the end.
