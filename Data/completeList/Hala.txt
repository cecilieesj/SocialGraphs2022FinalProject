|quote = }}'''Hala''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and the main antagonist of ''[[Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors]]''. She is an Accuser, just like [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]], and she is just as strong, just as durable, just as fierce, just as ruthless and just as merciless as him. Unlike Ronan's hammer, her weapon more resembles a spear or a staff.

Hala was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Valerio Schiti.
