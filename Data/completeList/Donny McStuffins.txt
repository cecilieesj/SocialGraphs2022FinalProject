|quote = "Doc, you're the greatest!"}}'''Donny McStuffins''' is [[Dottie McStuffins|Dottie "Doc"]]'s 4-year-old brother from the [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. Donny is a curious and playful boy with an adventurous imagination and many great friends his age: Luca, Will, and Alma. Luca is his best friend, while [[Alma]], who is the little sister of [[Emmie]], is his neighbor. Also, his favorite toys are Robot Ray, [[Sir Kirby]], Ricardo Racecar and Glo-Bo. Doc acts like a big sister to Donny, even when his toys don't work.

==Personality==
Donny is very playful and curious. He loves playing with his big sister, Doc and his toys, especially the kids his age. In the episode "[[Ben/Anna Split!]]", when Donny accidentally rips Ben's hugging sticker off from a rosebush thorn, he shows Alma, feeling sorry to her. Also in the episode "[[Run Down Race Car]]", Donny is tired from racing Ricardo Racecar last night and has to go inside to take a nap before Luca comes to play.
