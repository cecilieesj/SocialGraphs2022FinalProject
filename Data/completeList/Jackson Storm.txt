'''Jackson Storm''' is the main antagonist of the [[2017]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Cars 3]]''.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Jackson Storm is fast, sleek, and ready to race. A frontrunner in the next generation of racers, Storm's quiet confidence and cocky demeanor are off-putting—but his unmatched speed threatens to redefine the sport. Trained on high-tech simulators that are programmed to perfect technique and maximize velocity, Jackson Storm is literally built to be unbeatable—and he knows it.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pixarpost.com/2017/01/cars-3-vocal-cast.html|title='Cars 3' Vocal Talent Confirmed with First Official Look at Jackson Storm & Cruz Ramirez|website=Pixar Post|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>

===Physical Appearance===
Storm is painted black, and has a dark blue lightning bolt-like design on his doors. His eyes are gray, and his racing number, 2.0, is painted on his sides along with the logos of the [[Piston Cup]], Combustr, Carbon Cyber, SynerG, and IGNTR. The IGNTR logo is colored blue, while the rest of the logos are colored white. His number can also be found on his rear end and roof, being painted gray, while the IGNTR logo is also painted gray on his rear end, and painted black on his hood and spoiler. He also has one dark blue line beside each of his headlights, on the edges of his roof, around his windows, and on the sides of his spoiler.

According to his character pose, his model is a [[2017]] Custom-built "Next-Gen" Piston Cup Racer.<ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" />

===Powers and Abilities===
With a Maximum Performance electric motor, 850 hp, a hydroformed alloy & steel chassis, and a carbon fiber and metal composite body, he can go from zero to sixty miles per hour in 3.6 seconds, and go up to 214 miles per hour.<ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" />

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars 3]]''===
Jackson is introduced as a rookie in the racing world, where he tries his best to beat [[Lightning McQueen]]. He unexpectedly wins a race and reveals himself to be an extremely arrogant racer. Throughout the season, he keeps winning as newer racers take over the circuit, and boasts about McQueen retiring, when he is interviewed by racer turned reporter [[Chick Hicks]]. 

Prior to the Florida 500, he sets records and increase his top speed to 214 miles per hour. At the race, Storm notices [[Cruz Ramirez]] in her racing outfits and insults her. When Cruz Ramirez enters the race, Storm completely underestimates her. As Cruz moves up to third place, Storm tells her that she does not belong on a track and her dreams won't be enough to make her a racer. McQueen tells Cruz that Storm saw something in her which was why he tried to lower her confidence. Storm was shocked to find out that Cruz was right behind him. Cruz remains close on his tail by drafting. During the final lap, Storm attempted to push her against a wall, but Cruz flipped over him and won the race.

===''[[Miss Fritter's Racing Skoool]]''===
Storm is seen in a news footage headlining that Cruz Ramirez beat Jackson Storm to win the Florida 500 trophy for Lightning McQueen.

==Video games==
===''[[Cars 3: Driven to Win]]''===
Storm is one of the playable characters in the game and is unlocked once he's beaten in the final boss race.

==Trivia==
*Storm's voice actor, [[Armie Hammer]], was born on the same year [[Pixar]] was founded ([[1986]]).
*By winning the [[Piston Cup]] in his rookie year, Storm has achieved what McQueen was hoping to do in the first ''[[Cars]]'' film which he gave up and helped The King instead after learning that helping others is important than winning. It is highly possible, as another rookie may have won sometime between the events of the first and third films.
*Storm makes no future appearances in the series.
*Unlike [[Chick Hicks]], [[Professor Zündapp]], [[Acer]], [[Grem]], and [[Miles Axlerod]], Jackson Storm is the least evil main antagonist who never does anything evil, as his only intent is to top other racers.
*Jackson Storm won ten races in a row before winning his first Piston Cup.
*Ironically, in spite of his clear hate for McQueen, Storm is very much like he was in the [[Cars|first film]]; the main difference is that Lightning still showed respect towards older champions, like [[The King (Cars)|the King]], as shown when he chose to admit defeat by forfeiting his victory so he can help him finish his last race for good.
*Jackson Storm highly resembles a Nissan Concept 2020 Vision Gran Turismo, a concept supercar made for the Gran Turismo series by Polyphony Digital.
*Jackson Storm beat a racing record when he reached 214 mph in a practice lap.
*Even if Jackson is the fastest Piston Cup racer, he's not the fastest car in the franchise: the record is held by [[Francesco Bernoulli]] (Lightning's rival in ''[[Cars 2]]''), with a top speed of 220 mph.
*Jackson's actions in the final race reflect Chick Hicks' actions in the first movie, aggressively attacking King and McQueen.
*Armie Hammer previously portrayed the [[John Reid|Lone Ranger]] from the [[2013]] [[The Lone Ranger|film of the same name]].
