==Role in the series==
In "[[Trike X-5]]", Penelope tries to show her "superior" unicycle-riding skills, but is outdone when Brianna uses her brother's tricycle to perform a stunt. In "[[Sister Pact]]", she tries to sabotage Brianna's audition for the Poise Posse but fails and is kicked out of the group for trying to do so. Like Janelle, she is commonly seen as a background character.
