The '''Dragon of Japan'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/dragons/japan.htm</ref>Â is a minor character who only appeared in the ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'' episode "[[The Hong Kong Longs]]". He is one of [[the Dragon Council]] members. He is the first dragon who saved [[Japan]] and wields two swords.

After [[the Dark Dragon]], [[Councilor Chang]], and [[Bananas B.]] arrived, the Japanese Dragon turned into his dragon form and realized that [[Jake Long]] slipped something into their drinks. The Dark Dragon, thinking the council members drank his mind control spell, commanded [[Sun Park]] to destroy and kill [[Councilor Andam]], but she suddenly grew long ears, while the Japanese Dragon turned into a codfish, [[Councilor Andam]] tuned into a hippo, [[Councilor Omina]] turned into a sheep, Councilor Kulde turned into a horse, [[Councilor Kukulkhan]] turned into an eagle, and the rest of the dragons turned into different animals.

He turned back into his dragon form to fight the Dark Dragon.

==Dragon Anatomy==
Dragon of Japan's dragon form resembles a large green dragon. He wields two samurai swords and brown wrist plates. His mane is brown and his short hair is black. His underbelly is a yellowish green. His wings are similar to most dragons, having an arm-and-fingers bone structure. The outside of his wings match the green of her scales, but the inside of his wings are a darker green than his scales.
