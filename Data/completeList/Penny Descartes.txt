'''Penny Descartes'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0399133/</ref> (voiced by [[Cree Summer]])<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/The-Weekenders/Penny-Descartes/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838588/</ref> is [[Carver Descartes|Carver]]'s beautiful, but snobby big sister from the Disney television series ''[[The Weekenders]]''. She is African-American and is noted for wearing very high platform shoes, and having an horrible singing voice. She also dates one of [[Lor McQuarrie|Lor]]'s brothers, [[Kirk McQuarrie]].

==Episode appearance==
*"Sitters" (first appearance)
*"Vengenace"
*"Penny McQuarrie"

==Trivia==
* It is ironic that she's a horrible singer, as most of Cree Summer's characters are good singers (particulary Susie Carmichael).
