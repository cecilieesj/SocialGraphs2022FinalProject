==History==

===[[The Rise of Scar|''The Lion Guard: The Rise of Scar'']]===
[[Shupavu]] and [[Njano]] watch the [[Lion Guard]] lead [[Makuu]] and his float into a cave, before leaving.

When [[Ushari]] and [[Janja]] are trying to find out if it's possible to summon [[Scar]], Ushari enlists the help of his friends, a group of skinks. Among them is Shupavu, who speaks with Ushari about his call. Ushari explains that he needs one of them to follow [[Rafiki]] and [[Makini]] to see where they go. Intrigued, Shupavu asks what's in it for them. Ushari replies that it might tip the Pride Lands in their favor, and she becomes convinced. She sends out her stealthiest skink, Nyeusi, to spy on the two mandrills.

===[[Let Sleeping Crocs Lie|''Let Sleeping Crocs Lie'']]===
Njano and Shupavu see that the Lion Guard has accidentally woken up [[Makuu's Float|Makuu's float]] and inform Ushari and Scar. Scar instructs them to keep him informed of any changes. Later on, after they witness [[Kiburi]] challenge [[Makuu]] to a Mashindano, they tell Scar, and, after Scar praises them, they leave the volcano.

===[[Swept Away|''Swept Away'']]===
Njano, Shupavu and another skink see [[Beshte]] alone in the Outlands and goes to meet him. While Shupavu and another skink stay with Beshte; Njano reports to Janja and Ushari about their finding and afterward returns to Shupavu, with a new plan given to him by Scar. After reuniting with Beshte, he and others lead the hippo into a trap (secretly planned by them and the hyenas) as [[Janja]], [[Chungu]], and [[Cheezi]] topple rocks onto Beshte. He warns Njano and his friends to leave and they do so by slithering into small openings in the rocks, leaving Beshte blissfully unaware that the skinks are working against him.

===[[The Little Guy|''The Little Guy'']]===
Njano and Shupavu watch [[Hodari]] desperately try to join [[Makuu's Float]]. When he fails, Shupavu has an idea and, once Njano catches on, they are certain that Scar will love it.

When Hodari separates from Beshte, Njano and Shupavu approach the gecko, with the latter assuring him that they're not enemies. She goes on to tell him that Makuu doesn't hold the only crocodile float and that she knows someone who would love to have a bright, young gecko in his float, piquing Hodari's interest. She suggests that Njano go on ahead and tell [[Kiburi]] about the "special candidate", which he gladly does. Njano pitches the idea to Kiburi, though never mentions Hodari's species. When the gecko arrives, Kiburi is slightly miffed, though Njano reminds him that ''he'' was the one who assumed Hodari's species. Njano and Shupavu watch as Hodari is "accepted" into the [[Kiburi's Float|float]].

===[[The Scorpion's Sting|''The Scorpion's Sting'']]===

They chase Kinyonga around the Outlands, but the sneaky chameleon is able to outdo Njano and the other skinks until they finally corner her. But before they are able to capture her, the Lion Guard appears, having used camouflage themselves with foliage and earth. Not wishing to fight them, she and the rest of skinks retreat.

===[[The Hyena Resistance|''The Hyena Resistance'']]===
After finding out that [[Jasiri]] and [[Jasiri's Clan|her Clan]] are behind all of Scar's plans being ruined. Scar gets mad at Janja because he lied to him and he didn't finish the mission in ''Rescue in the Outlands''. They see Jasiri save Janja, Njano thought that he was going to join the Resistance. Janja refuses and he can't wait to tell Scar about what happened.

===[[The Underground Adventure|''The Underground Adventure'']]===
Shupavu and Njano watch Kion, Bunga, [[Kiara]], [[Tiifu]] and [[Zuri]] at the hot '''mud pots''' edge of the Pride Lands. They go to tell Scar and Scar asks for a vulture, so he can deliver Kion and his friends ''a gift of fire''.
