|siblings=[[Anna Otter]] (sister)|partner=[[Ernest Otter]] (husband)|children=[[Peanut Otter]] (oldest son)<br>[[Jelly Otter]] (middle daughter)<br>[[Baby Butter Otter]] (youngest daughter)}}'''Opal Otter''' is the wife of [[Ernest Otter]] and the mother of the three kids, [[Peanut Otter|Peanut]], [[Jelly Otter|Jelly]], and [[Baby Butter Otter|Butter]].
Opal has lived on Lake Hoohaw for her entire life. Before her sister [[Anna Otter|Anna]] moved to Howdydoo Island, Opal often hung out with [[Shirley Duck]] and [[Betty Lou Beaver]]. When a new otter, Ernest, moved in from the city, Opal was resistant at first to get to know him. However, when she gave Ernest a chance, she ended up getting married to him.

While Opal is more of the serious type, unlike her husband, you could still say that the two of them are a perfect couple. Sometimes during the evening, Opal and her family hang out on their dock and talk about their day.
