[[File:Char_72900.jpg|thumb]]'''Moira Payne''' (voiced by Dana Daurey)<ref>http://www.imdb.com/find?q=Dana+Daurey&s=all</ref><ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/The-Weekenders/Moira/</ref> is the 14-year old daughter of [[Dixon Payne|Dixon]]. [[Carver Descartes|Carver ]] has a crush on her, but [[Tino Tonitini|Tino]] has very mixed feelings on her becoming part of his family, due to her obsession with shoes that goes even beyond Carver's level and her inability to think precisely.

==Trivia==
*Her hair style is similar to [[Mandy]]'s.
