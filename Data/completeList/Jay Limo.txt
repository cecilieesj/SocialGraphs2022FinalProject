'''Jay Limo''' is a minor character in the [[2006]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Cars]]''. He is a talk show host, based on the real-life [[Jay Leno]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars]]''===
Jay Limo has spent countless nights on the road, crisscrossing the country perfecting his stand-up comedy act before getting his big break performing on the most popular late show in town. It wasn't long until he was asked to fill in as guest host, and eventually took over the show full time. He may be a big-time talk show host now, but that hasn't stopped him from spending countless nights on the road, crisscrossing the country, still working to perfect his comedy act.

In ''Cars'', Jay Limo is seen reporting on the loss of [[Lightning McQueen|McQueen]].

==Trivia==

*This is ironic since real-life Jay Leno has his very own car collection.
