==Role in the series==
Sanza is a chanul who went bad and instead of giving people good advice, he talks them into causing trouble. He first appears with Guillermo and convinces him to help ruin Día de los Muertos. They start causing chaos, but Elena spots them and tells them to stop. When Elena mentions the [[Spirit World]] Sanza says there's an even bigger party to crash and then he teleports Guillermo and himself there.
