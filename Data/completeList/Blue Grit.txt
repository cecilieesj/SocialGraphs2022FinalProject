'''Blue Grit''' is a character in the ''[[Cars Toons]]'' episode ''[[The Radiator Springs 500½]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Blue Grit is painted mainly dark blue, with blue eyes, and flames painted on his front and sides. His model is a trophy truck.<ref name="EW">[http://family-room.ew.com/2014/03/13/cars-short-radiator-springs-500/ Lightning McQueen revs his engine off-road in Pixar's new Radiator Springs short -- EXCLUSIVE]</ref> On his roof, he has four off-road headlights, as well as two spare tires in his cargo area. On his rear fenders is a white shape representing a bull's face. On the shape are red lines and text colored blue that says "Blue Bulldozer". He also has a gray space frame at the front.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars Toons]]''===
In ''[[The Radiator Springs 500½]]'', Blue Grit, [[Sandy Dunes]], [[Idle Threat]] and [[Shifty Sidewinder]] all travel to [[Radiator Springs]], having heard that [[Lightning McQueen]] is the fastest around these parts. They immediately find him on stage dressed up as the town's founder [[Stanley (Cars)|Stanley]], to which Blue Grit comments that Stanley looks dumber than McQueen. This is followed by Sandy and Shifty making more insults about Stanley, resulting in McQueen challenging them to a race.

At the start of the race, Blue Grit and the other racers come to two paths. [[Mater]] had told them to take the left path, but due to confusion on saying "left is right" when he meant to say "left is correct", all of the racers take the right path, unaware that it is the wrong path. Blue Grit and the other racers continue racing, but they are forced to go down cliffs, and then drive through a cactus patch. Soon, they come into a cavern that is filled with tailpipes, which then let out soot. Finally, the racers come through a spooky forest, soon finding many corpses that frighten them, while Blue Grit admits that he wants to live. They manage to get back to Radiator Springs, but Blue Grit and his pals cannot believe that Stanley would be so tough.

==Video games==
===''[[Cars: Fast as Lightning]]''===
