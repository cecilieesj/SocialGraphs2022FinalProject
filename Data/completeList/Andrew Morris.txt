'''Andrew Morris''' is the main antagonist of [[Locksmith Animation|Locksmith]]'s animated feature film, ''[[Ron's Gone Wrong]]''. He is the COO of the company Bubble who produces companion-like robots called B-Bots, but when the company discovers that a defective B-Bot named [[Ron]] is running amok, he plans to get rid of it and protect the company from bad publicity.

He was voiced by Rob Delaney.

==Background==
Andrew is the COO who works at the Bubble company headquartered at Nonsuch. When Andrew first saw Ron's glitch causing an incident at Nonsuch Middle School with the students' B-Bots causing a rampage during recess, Andrew watches footage of what happened believing that the incident is about the B-Bots causing a ruckus across the school to which he devises a plan to find Ron and have him destroyed via crusher.

Later throughout the film, it is revealed that Andrew has taken the position as CEO replacing Marc Weidell as he is shown to have fired him, denying Marc's access to fix Ron, leading Barney to bring Ron into the cloud storage area so that Ron can have his glitch fixed. After Ron's original code given by Marc himself is installed into the B-Bots' data which overwrites everything permanently seen during the B-Bot incident at school, Marc goes to the presentation area where he shows footage of Andrew's threats via his phone carried by his fellow robotic skateboard to which Andrew sees footage of himself doing this action of saying a negative saying about B-Bots and also children. To avoid getting booed off by the audience for betraying Bubble and also to avoid his true actions being marked as public, Andrew then steps down from his position as CEO of Bubble just as his position as CEO was pivoted to Marc Weidell, returning his position as CEO to him.

==Biography==
Andrew is first seen with Bubble CEO Marc Weidell during a presentation on delivering B-Bots to kids everywhere.

Andrew is next seen in Bubble HQ where he, Marc, and the rest of the employees notice that one of the B-Bots belonging to a kid named Barney Pudowski who he calls Ron has a malfunction to it and Andrew's first instinct is to cover it up to avoid bad publicity. It's soon revealed that Andrew uses the B-Bots to spy on the customers in order to potentially profit off them.

When Ron once again causes a mess (having multiple B-Bots band together to form a hulking giant and cause havoc), he becomes determined to locate the B-Bot and destroy it, despite Marc's insistence to leave it be. However, Ron and Barney manage to escape into the woods.

When Ron and Barney come back to civilization, Andrew tries to have Ron captured, but Marc manages to swipe Ron and repair his malfunction. When Barney learns of this, he implores that Marc restates Ron to how he was before due to liking him better that way. While Marc agrees, Andrew puts a stop to it due to taking over as the new CEO.

Andrew is defeated however when Marc blackmails him into giving him back his new CEO position by emailing him a video confessing his unscrupulous use of the B-Bots and disliking kids.

==Trivia==
*Based on his clothes, he is clearly intended to be a parody of late Pixar employee [[Steve Jobs]].
