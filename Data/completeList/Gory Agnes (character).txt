She was once a young girl until an incident where she had a squirrel embedded in her forehead. Afterwards, her soul became trapped within a Mirror World. To summon Gory Agnes in a mirror, one would need to pour sunbathing oil on their head, paint an all-seeing eye over their heart, and say Gory Agnes' name three times while looking into a mirror.

==Role in the Series==
Gory Agnes first appeared in [[Gory Agnes|the titular episode of the same name]]. After [[Peanut]] watched a television episode about Agnes, he dared [[Pickle]] to try and summon her in the bathroom mirror. After giving it a try, it seemed like a rip-off—until the candle blew out and left the bathroom in the dark. Agnes suddenly appeared in the mirror and spewed black goo all over the duo. The next day, Peanut returned after his shift at Mjärt Mart and found that Pickle was now taking Agnes out on dates. Of course, the only reason Agnes was around was because Pickle the first boy to ever call her back.
