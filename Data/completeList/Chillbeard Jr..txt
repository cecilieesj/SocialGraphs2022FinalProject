'''Chillbeard Junior''' is a frost giant who causes trouble for [[Gummi Glen]] by keeping a prolonged winter.

However, he sees this as a way to have fun, and when met by [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] and [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], he simply figures he finally has someone to play with.

When the bears first meet Chillbeard Junior, they are surprised that although he looks like the famous [[Chillbeard]], he sounds and behaves rather immature.

Chillbeard Junior meets his endgame when he is discovered by his father, who is angry with him for stealing his wind horn, and perplexed why he is wearing a fake beard to impersonate him.
