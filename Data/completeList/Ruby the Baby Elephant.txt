'''Ruby the Baby Elephant''' is a supporting character in the [[2020]] [[Disney+]] film, ''[[The One and Only Ivan]]''.

==Background==
When Ruby arrived at the Big Top Mall, she is billed as one of the attraction's main stars of the show. Each time she is brought to the circus, she walks alongside her aunt Stella across the circus. However, when [[Stella the Elephant|Stella]]'s foot becomes swollen at one point and Ruby fearfully refuses to walk into the stage by herself, she manages to conquer her fear of walking into the circus by herself, pleasing her aunt.

===Personality===
A cheerful and kind elephant calf, Ruby shows a good friendship when she talks to Ivan and Bob at the Big Top Mall. At first, Ruby felt fearful after her aunt's passing, though she gained trust and tenacity so that she can walk into the circus during showtime by herself and felt confident adapting to walking into the circus thanks to her courage. Besides herself as a circus elephant, Ruby has a fond of carrots. In spite of her like for carrots, she even felt pleased when Ivan drew a carrot for her. At the end of the film, Ruby adapts to having a new life in her new enclosure alongside Ivan as Rubh adapts living with her new herd of elephants.

==Role in the film==
Ruby is introduced as the Big Top Mall's new addition to the main attraction where she is billed as circus' main stars alongside the silverback gorilla [[Ivan the Gorilla|Ivan]]. During performance, Ruby is billed as one of the circus' main headliners where she walks alongside Stella as the two elephants walk together to impress the audience. The next day, the Big Top Mall's billboard receives a banner advertises Ruby's as the main headliner of the attraction just as Bob looks at the Big Top Mall's billboard  and notices that the circus has changed due to Ruby being the circus' new addition. Later that night, Stella praises Ruby for her performance at the circus as Stella tells her a story about her flashback when she was stuck at a deep mud pit. The next day, as Stella is unable to perform because of a swollen foot, Ruby manages to conquer her fear of walking into the circus ring by herself, still impressing the audience. That night, a despondent Ruby asks Ivan to draw a carrot for her, to which Ivan tells Ruby to keep Ivan's drawing hobbies private as everyone would know that he wouldn't be the angry gorilla of the circus.

Shortly after Stella's passing, Ruby mourns her death, leaving the elephant calf by herself. The next day, Mack teaches Ruby how to walk like an adult elephant in solo in order to keep Stella's legacy alive. George asks a resilient Mack to wrap everything up after training with Ruby to which Mack denies, explaining that he refuses to cancel further showtimes either much to Ivan's worry. That night, Ivan tells Ruby a story about a smart and brave elephant calf desiring herself to get freedom in the wild. After being brought back to the Big Top Mall, Ruby clarifies to Bob and Ivan telling them to remember that her late mother Stella explained that not all humans are bad. Ruby then performs one last time during her final performance at the circus before Ivan shows up.

The next day, Ruby and Ivan hear protesters outside the circus demanding them to be free. The following day, Ruby bids Ivan her final farewell before being sent to a large enclosure while being guided by Dr. Maya who feeds her a carrot just as Maya takes her alongside her as Ruby leaves.

After Ivan is released into a large enclosure, he observes Ruby adapting her new life into her new enclosure as she adapts living in a new herd of elephants just as Julia and George happily observe the former Big Top Mall stars adapting their new lives into their enclosures.
