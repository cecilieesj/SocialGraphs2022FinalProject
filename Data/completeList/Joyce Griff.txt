'''Dr. Joyce Griff''' is the mother of [[Stanley Griff|the title character]] of the Playhouse Disney (now Disney Junior) animated series ''[[Stanley (TV series)|Stanley]]''. She is a redheaded woman who works, as she is a dentist, revealed in "[[Double-Duty Dad]]" and to a lesser extent, "[[Up the Apple Tree]]", "[[Garbage Can Bandit]]", and "In a While, Crocodile". It is shown in "[[Whole Lotta Snakin' Going On]]" that she has ophidiophobia (meaning she is afraid of snakes).

In the episode "A Boy's Best Friend is His Fish", she once sees and hears an image of Harry and Elsie dancing and singing, but dismisses the fact that it is really them.
