==Background==
===Physical Description===
The meerkat angel is a large meerkat with light purple fur and dark purple hair. He has black eyes. He also has black ears with dark purple canals and wears a white robe, a gray-purple tunic, and glasses.

===Personality===
The meerkat angel seems overall devoid of any personality. His very existence is to objectively judge people for their time on earth and send them to either Heaven or Hell. However, because his judgments are based on the majority of what a person has done, rather than individual actions, his decisions are sometimes harsh, as in [[Timon|Timon's]] case, who almost got sent to Hell simply because he called people "mooks" all his life. However, he can give people second chances if they do one good deed. After doing so, when they die again, they will go to Heaven.

==Role in the series==
After [[Timon]] presumably dies from eating a poisonous bug, the meerkat angel appears and welcomes him to Meerkat Heaven.

He looks at a big book that shows Timon's life. After seeing that Timon has been calling someone a mook all his life, he is about to send Timon to Hell. After Timon asks him to give him another chance, the angel sends him back to Earth and tells him that he has to be selfless and help others, if he doesn't he will live on earth never die and therefore, never enter Meerkat Heaven.

==Trivia==
*Jeff Bennett, who provides the meerkat angel's voice, also voiced [[Zazu]] in the Morning Report segment of the original ''[[The Lion King|Lion King]]'' and in [[The Lion Guard]]. He was also [[Iron Joe]] in ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', as well as various other voices in ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'', including the [[Beast (Timon & Pumbaa)|beast]], Buzz, and the [[Castaway (Timon and Pumbaa)|castaway]].
