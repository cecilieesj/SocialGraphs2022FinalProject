'''Thingy''' is a tiny blue furball that can transform into a large battle form of ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]''. Its fur is apparently edible.
==Role in the Series==
Thingy first appeared in the episode [[Thingy (SRMTHFG)|of the same name]]. It was saved from a rockslide on Ranger 7 by the Hyperforce. It licked every one of them (except for [[Gibson]] who sneezed on him). It's later revealed that was under control of [[The Skeleton King]] to destroy the Super Robots by spreading a virus that was inside of Thingy. It managed to infect Gibson, the others were immune due to Thingy's saliva. They manage to prevent the virus from spreading into the Super Robot and Thingy was back to its usual self.
Thingy also makes a cameo near the end of "[[Wonder Fun Meat World]]".
