'''Sphinx Martindale''' is a minor character from the ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules TV Series]]''. He is a game-show loving creature with the body of a lion, the head of a man, and bird wings who lives high up on a mountain top. Whenever someone trespasses on his domain he forces them to play on his game show and if they answer all his questions right he gives them a fabulous prize but if they get them wrong he eats them.

==History==
===''[[Hercules and the Driving Test]]''===
Sphinx Martindale first appears after [[Pain and Panic]] direct [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]], [[Icarus]], and [[Cassandra]] in the wrong direction. Soon after traveling up the mountain they were directed to, the Sphinx appears and knocks their chariot off the mountain. Icarus and Cassandra fall, but the Sphinx catches them. As Hercules begs the Sphinx to let them go, he informs them they were going to have fun. 

The scene then switches to a skeleton audience and a skeleton announcer participation in the Sphinx's game show, with the trio standing in front of the Sphinx on a pedestal. The show was revealed to be called "Riddle of the Sphinx". The Sphinx first greets Hercules as he held onto Icarus and Cassandra, informing him that he ate all of the former contestants. He then asks Hercules the first question, and after Hercules gets it right, he at first prepares to eat the group but then comes to the realization that Hercules was right. He then flies away sadly while the skeleton informs them that they won a brand-new chariot.

==Trivia==
*Another Sphinx appears in the [[Hercules (video game)|Hercules Video Game]], which is the only other Sphinx to have appeared in the series. This Sphinx appears to be far different from Sphinx Martindale, appearing to have a more feminine head and no crown. 
*In the original Greek myths, the Sphinx was female, not male. However this sphinx bears several similarities to its Egyptian counterpart, namely the beard and gender.
*Sphinx Martindale is a parody of the game show host Winx Martindale, who also voiced the character.
