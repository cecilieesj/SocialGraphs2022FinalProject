==Appearances==
===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===
The day following the Dalmatians escaping from [[Jasper and Horace]],Â they become stranded in a dreadful snowstorm but are found by the Collie who tells [[Pongo]] that they have shelter for them in a dairy farm. The Collie leads them to the farm where he brings food for Pongo and [[Perdita]] while the dairy cows feed the puppies. He informs them that they should head to [[Dinsford]] next where there is a [[Labrador]] whose owner is a grocer. He then goes outside to guard the door in case [[Cruella De Vil]], Horace, and Jasper appear while the Dalmatians get some sleep.

He is not seen or even heard of for the rest of the film, but it can be assumed that he heard about the Dalmatians successfully returning home.

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
The Collie apparently makes another appearance in ''101 Dalmatians: The Series'' in the episode "[[Lucky to be Alone]]". Here, he assures Perdita that he shall keep an eye on [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] as he travels to his Aunt Coco and Uncle Beamer Vandercream. When they arrive at the Vandercreams, he cautions Lucky to be careful.

In this episode, his human seems to be a grocer van driver, though he claims the Labrador to have the grocer human in the animated film. However, it is possible he contacted the Labrador to arrange something.
