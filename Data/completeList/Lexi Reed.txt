==Personality==
Lexi is the cruelest and yet most popular girl at Webster High. She often puts people down and tries to mess with them, especially the ANTs. She has always been naturally beautiful and has won many beauty pageants in her childhood. Previous plays she starred in were ''Grease'', ''Annie'', and ''Fiddler on The Roof''. She is very protective of her popularity status and is never a bimbo unlike other popular girls, and doesn't like it when other talented people are around her. She tries to sabotage people for the sake of her popularity, such as Chyna and Abigail Timmons, but it usually backfires. She also considers socializing with certain people bad for her own popularity. She's also not above exploiting or abusing others, even her best friend.
