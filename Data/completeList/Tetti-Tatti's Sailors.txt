}}'''Tetti-Tatti's Sailors''' are minor characters and [[Tetti-Tatti]]'s ex-minions '''('''''at the end''''')''' from Disney's 1946 short the ''[[The Whale Who Wanted To Sing At the Met]]'', a segment of the 1946 film ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Nothing is known about them except they were hired by Tetti-Tatti to try and hunt down [[Willie the Whale|Willie]] to rescue the Opera Singer he apparently swallowed. However, they become so appreciative about his singing that they refuse to kill him, knowing he didn't swallow a singer. Later, Tetti-Tatti manages to break free without them noticing, and when he harpoons Willie, the sailors, enraged and horrified, attack their captain.

===Physical Description===
All three look exactly the sameâ€”barrel-chested with a large rounded jaw, shaven head, reddish-brown beards, wearing the typical sailor suits, with the typical buff male triangular body design.
