}}'''Two-Bits''' is the corrupt executive for ''Grampa Arnie's Ant Show''. He uses a vacuum to suck up dropped change from the audience. He appears in the episode "[[Stand-In Dad]]".

His scheme was to steal all the nickels from all the children in the audience to be reunited with the nickel "Nicky" he had as a little kid, which he lost forever when his father dropped it in a parking meter. His great-granddaddy David O. Seltzerwater used to tell him. "Never trust an agent". His nickellust came to an end when Lucky gave him his last nickel, which turned out to be Nicky.{{CharacterStub}}
