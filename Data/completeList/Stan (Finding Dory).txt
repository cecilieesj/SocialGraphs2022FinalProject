==Role in the film==
Stan, along with his wife, only appear in the beginning of the film where they hear [[Dory]] (as a baby fish) looking for her parents [[Charlie (Finding Nemo)|Charlie]] and [[Jenny (Finding Nemo)|Jenny]]. Stan's wife suddenly spots Dory behind the kelp forest as she and her husband both arrive towards Dory as she asks them to help find her parents. Stan asks Dory to know if any of the other kelp forest fish are her parents, since Dory is unable to remember where her parents were as she tells them that she suffers from short-term memory loss. As Stan and his wife decide to look for her missing parents, they then discover that Dory is gone as they plan to find Dory who is swimming away. He and his wife are never seen again throughout the rest of the film afterwards.

==Trivia==
*Stan is the fourth [[Pixar]] character to be voiced by [[Bill Hader]], after Slug Monster Student and Referee from ''[[Monsters University]]'' and [[Fear]] from ''[[Inside Out]]''.
