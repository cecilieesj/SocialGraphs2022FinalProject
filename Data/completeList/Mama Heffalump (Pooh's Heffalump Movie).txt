She was introduced in the film ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]''. She worried over her son and warned him never to leave Heffalump Hollow, as there were scary creatures living outside it, but learned that the other residents of the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] are a lot like her. She and [[Roo]]'s mother, [[Kanga]], have since formed a friendship. Although she appeared in the first heffalump movie, she did not appear in ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie]]'', nor is mentioned although Lumpy does mention some holidays that his mother and he celebrate.

Mama Heffalump has been seen on occasion in ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]'', most notably in the film ''[[Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too]]''. In all appearances to date, she has been voiced by Brenda Blethyn.
