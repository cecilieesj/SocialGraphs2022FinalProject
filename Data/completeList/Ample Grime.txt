'''Ample Grime''' is a one-shot villain in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.

==History==
Ample Grime is [[Ammonia Pine]]'s younger sister and a fellow agent of [[F.O.W.L.]]. However, she is the complete opposite of Ammonia, loving dirt as much as her sister loves cleanliness, though it is never mentioned why. One other thing is that she is afraid of being clean, much to displeasure of her sister. Strangely enough, though, Ammonia is quite protective of her sister.

Ample Grime first appears in the episode "[[Dirtysomething]]". [[The High Command]] sent her to team up with Ammonia to rob the city of all money. The plan was for the two to create a machine that would shot sticky sludge at the victims, then use a vacuum to suck them of all their money. Though the plan was quite simple, [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]] had difficulties fighting the duo due to [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]] having sold all of his equipment for recycling. DW was then forced to improvise by constructing a vehicle out of junk parts. He eventually foiled their plans, leaving the two to bicker among themselves while their machine exploded.

To date, Ample Grime's only other appearance was in "[[Orange is the New Purple]]", the opening story arc for [[Joe Books]]' short-lived ''[[Darkwing Duck (comic book)|Darkwing Duck]]'' revival comic.
