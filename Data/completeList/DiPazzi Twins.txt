==Personality==
Both are pretty clumsy, and usually obey Gordon without question. But their personalities are not known very thoroughly, as they do not speak much and have only appeared in a few episodes with supporting roles. But they do have a crazy love for the colonies, and like to sneak into the Mellowbrook cinema and cheat and annoy him enough to Kick.
