'''Peter Parafox'''  is one of the main characters of the 1985 Disney TV series ''[[The Wuzzles]]''.

Half parrot, half fox and the owner of Parafox Studios in Hollywuz. He spent most of the episode "[[Hooray for Hollywuz]]" ordering his Dogrilla (dog-gorilla) security to throw the persistent but unwanted Hoppo out of the studio. He does not seem to be able to say anything without squawking loudly at some point during the sentence.
