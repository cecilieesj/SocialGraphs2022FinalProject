{{Quote|Joined the dark side, Dooku has. Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are his ways now.|[[Yoda]]}}
'''Count Dooku''', also known as '''Darth Tyranus''', is a major antagonist in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. Once the [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] and former apprentice of Jedi Master [[Yoda]] and Master of [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], Dooku fell to the dark side, becoming the second apprentice of [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] and head of State of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] after Qui-Gon's death at the hands of [[Maul]]. 

Dooku secretly plotted to kill and overthrow his master, unaware that he had plans of his own to replace Dooku with [[Anakin Skywalker]]. As such, when the right time came, Palpatine had Dooku duel Anakin, who defeated and subsequently beheaded him at Palpatine's urgings.

He is the main antagonist in ''Attack of the Clones'' and in the ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film and television series, and a minor antagonist in ''Revenge of the Sith''.

==Background==
Dooku was born into a rich family on the planet Serenno, and was to become the future Count of his homeworld. However, he instead chose to become a [[Jedi]], training under Jedi Master [[Yoda]] before becoming a Jedi Master himself. According to Jocasta Nu, he was one of the finest Jedi that the Jedi Order has ever had. Eventually, he would take an apprentice, [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], who eventually obtained the rank of Jedi Master. At some point after Qui-Gon's death at the hands of [[Maul]], Dooku resigned from the Jedi Order. [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]], secretly known as "Darth Sidious", who had lost his apprentice Maul, offered Dooku the chance to join him. Tempted by the offer, Dooku became the Sith Lord known as "Darth Tyranus". Dooku then began to rally thousands of star systems to the Separatist cause.

===Personality===
Dooku is high stoic, calm, relaxed, confident, and cunning. Dooku is amoral and highly apathetic, but not incapable of emotional experiences. He was visibly shocked when [[Jango Fett]] was killed in the Geonosian Arena by [[Mace Windu]]. Dooku is an accomplished philosopher, orator, politician, and warrior.

Even as a child, Dooku felt driven to succeed. He was fully devoted to the ideals of the Jedi Order and the ideal of service to the galaxy. He sought to become a great Jedi Master, and for the vast majority of his life, he did not even consider the possibility of a life outside the Jedi Order. He knew of his heritage as a nobleman and felt self-conscious about it on occasion in his younger days. Dooku chose Jedi Padawans he thought had the potential to become great Jedi themselves and endeavored to teach them all he knew.

Dooku had very high expectations of the government as a Jedi, and was viewed by his peers as a "political idealist". He became increasingly disillusioned with the corruption within the [[Galactic Republic]] in the period before his defection from the Jedi Order, and eventually held the opinion that the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. In particular, he was highly critical of the Jedi Council's handling of the Battles of Galidraan and Baltizaar, as well as their refusal to become involved in the Battle of Naboo. The Council's perceived betrayal of the ideals of the Jedi Order greatly influenced Dooku in his fall to the dark side. Dooku also never forgives betrayal, appearing to have virtually no tolerance for it.

As Tyranus, Dooku became a Humanocentrist. While he remained a connoisseur of alien art and antiquities, he secretly despised most if not all of the aliens on the Separatist Council, though he reserved a measure of respect for the Geonosian Archduke and Separatist Council member Poggle the Lesser. He divided the entire galaxy into two categories: threats and assets. The threat category was for beings or institutions that interfered with his personal advancement and would have to be eliminated. The asset category being for those who could aid, or at least not hinder his advancement. He also had a certain fondness for Obi-Wan Kenobi, partially because he was taught by Dooku's Padawan. This was shown when he asked Obi-Wan to join him in his quest of power and even telling him the truth that the Republic was governed by Darth Sidious, though the Jedi didn't believe him.

By the time of the Clone Wars, Dooku believed that the sorrow and injustice of the galaxy could only be responded to with anger and hate. He came to believe that the Jedi Order should embrace the dark side and rule the galaxy alone without the interference of the Senate. As Tyranus, he planned to transform the Jedi into a Sith Army and intended to forcibly recruit Force-users into its ranks. While often assuming a genteel and civilized manner, Dooku showed no qualms about torturing or ordering the deaths of hundreds of his former comrades, nor about committing any number of atrocities as leader of the Separatists. He was also willing to abandon or even kill his own allies and followers in order to achieve his goals or simply to prove his loyalty to his Sith Master, [[Palpatine]] but was secretly planning to betray his master just as Sidious had betrayed and murdered Darth Plagueis.

Dooku is very arrogant, not acknowledging his mistakes, at least for the most part. Every time he used Dun MÃ¶ch to taunt Anakin, it would backfire, causing him to doubt Dooku's abilities. This just encouraged Anakin to draw on his anger and nearly allowed him to kill Dooku. Eventually, this led to Dooku's death at the hands of Anakin on-board the Separatist flagship ''Invisible Hand'' during the Battle of Coruscant. However, at that point, he had been led to believe that Palpatine would come to his aid to turn Anakin to their side or dispose of him. Dooku also became annoyed every time his then-apprentice [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], tried to help creatures that he deemed inferior. However, despite his arrogance, he also showed respect to his enemies such as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whom he considered a worthy opponent. 

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[The Force]]:''' Despite Dooku's old age, he has an extremely strong connection to the Force. However, despite having arrogantly claimed himself to be more powerful than any individual [[Jedi]] of his time, Dooku's Force powers were not enough to surpass that of [[Yoda]], [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]], and [[Anakin Skywalker]], at their peaks.
**'''Telekinesis:''' Dooku can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. His powers allow him to affect small structures, notably damaging parts of a ceiling to rain down debris on his former mentor, Yoda, who caught and discarded them with ease. Dooku was also able to collapse an entire cave entrance on Vanquor to trap [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and Anakin inside with several Gundarks.
***'''Force Push:''' Dooku can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed.
***'''Force Pull:''' Dooku can telekinetically pull his opponents or objects towards him.
***'''Force Choke:''' Dooku can telekinetically choke his opponents to either weaken, kill or intimidate them. His proficiency with this power allows him to throttle his targets without looking at them, as he did to Queen Miraj Scintel, who he was still able to fatally injure despite releasing her.
***'''Force Grip:''' Dooku can telekinetically lift his opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them. His powers also allow him to influence the movements of other individuals, as he was able to force the pirate Turk Falso to shoot his comrade while simultaneously choking him, while he performed a similar feat when he made Padme Amidala aim at and shoot Bec Lawise.
***'''Force Levitation:''' Dooku can telekinetically levitate himself or slow down his fall to the ground.
***'''Force Throw:''' Dooku can telekinetically cause objects and other individuals to be hurled toward a target at an astounding velocity.
***'''Force Crush:''' Dooku can telekinetically crush objects or droids. He was able to destroy the base of a small tower in an attempt to have it fall on a defeated Obi-Wan and Anakin, all while simultaneously locking blades with Yoda, forcing his former master to end the duel while Dooku escaped on his ship.
***'''Force Deflection:''' Dooku can telekinetically redirect incoming attacks such as blaster bolts or Force lightning, with or without his lightsaber, although it is difficult to do so. This allowed him to deflect his own Force lightning that had been redirected back at him by his former mentor, Yoda.
**'''Mind Trick:''' Dooku can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.
**'''Taming Beasts:''' Dooku can control the minds of animals.
**'''Force Lightning:''' Dooku can create and project lightning from both his hands to torture or kill his opponents. He was notable able to levitate and repel targets using his lightning in a similar manner to telekinesis.
**'''Force Valor:''' Dooku can temporarily push past physical limitations and renew his morale, stamina, accuracy and overall battle prowess through sheer concentration and willpower. He notably used this ability to overcome the disabilities caused by his advanced age, increasing his strength, speed, agility, and dexterity to unnatural levels.
**'''Force Jump:''' Dooku can jump or leap at great distances.
**'''Force Dash:''' Dooku can move at amazing speeds.

====Abilities====
*'''Master Lightsaber Duelist:''' Despite Dooku's old age, he is an extremely skilled lightsaber duelist. Dooku was even able to fight on par against [[Yoda]].
**'''Form II:''' Dooku is a master of Makashi, using it exclusively. He considered by many to be the most proficient practitioner of the style.
**'''Dun MÃ¶ch:''' Dooku is extremely skilled in Dun MÃ¶ch.
*'''Genius-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Leader:''' Dooku is highly intelligent and wise. As a Sith General, Dooku is a highly skilled tactician and a very capable leader.

===Weapons and Equipment===
====Lightsaber====
Dooku's valued weapon and possession is his blue, later red-bladed lightsaber. Dooku's curved-hilt lightsaber was made out of Solid Heavy-Duty metal and Black alloy.
*'''[[Lightsaber]]:''' Dooku had built his lightsaber shortly after becoming a Jedi Master and it had originally a blue colored blade. When Dooku left the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], he took his lightsaber with him. Upon he joining the [[Sith|Sith Order]], Dooku converted his weapon into a Sith lightsaber by replacing the original blue crystal with a scarlet synthetic gem, improving the blade's cutting power at the expense of maneuverability, turning it into a red-bladed lightsaber. It would remain in Dooku's possession until his death. The Curved-hilt lightsaber was eventually destroyed when it entered the planet atmosphere of [[Coruscant]].

After leaving the Jedi Order and becoming a Sith, Dooku began a Separatist movement in the Galaxy under the command of his Master, Darth Sidious. When Obi-Wan Kenobi was tracking the bounty hunter, [[Jango Fett]], to the planet of Geonosis, he found that Dooku was creating a new droid army and recruiting politicians, among them being Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who wanted revenge on the former Queen PadmÃ¨ Amidala for his defeat during the Invasion of Naboo. He reported to the Jedi Council, but was captured by Geonosians. While he was captured, Dooku attempted to turn him to the dark side. Obi-Wan talked to Dooku, who refused working with the Sith, to which Dooku reminded Kenobi that he trained his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, who had been killed by Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo. When Obi-Wan remained stubborn, Dooku revealed that [[Palpatine|a Sith Lord]] was controlling the Senate, but that the dark side of the Force had clouded the Jedi's vision.

After Kenobi's apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator PadmÃ¨ Amidala failed to rescue him, Dooku sentenced all three to death in the arena. He was overwhelmed when the trio broke free and killed the monsters that were supposed to kill them. However, he was prepared and brought out some [[Droidekas|destroyer droids]] to kill them instead. Master Windu came with a strike team of Jedi to rescue the three. They were all surrounded again by numerous battle droids, but were saved by Master Yoda and an army of clone troopers. Dooku fled the arena and returned to a command center, where he monitored the battle with Nute Gunray, Poggle the Lesser, and other Separatist leaders. When Gunray decides to escape with his ''Lucrehulk''-class Core Ships before they can be taken down by the Republic's clone army while still on the ground, Poggle hands Dooku the blueprints for what the Separatists dubbed the "Ultimate Weapon", that being the schematics for the future Galactic Empire's dreaded [[Death Star]], warning Dooku that if the Republic found out about it, the Confederacy would be doomed. Dooku assures Poggle that the blueprints will be safe with Sidious back on Coruscant.

Eventually, he left to return to Coruscant, but was spotted by Skywalker and Kenobi as he attempted to flee to a hangar. Both Jedi pursued him, but lost Padme on the way, who fell out of the ship (though the ship was hovering above ground, so she wasn't seriously hurt) when it took some damage from flak from the pursuing Geonosian fighters. In anger, Skywalker charged at the Sith Lord, allowing Dooku to zap him with Force lightning and briefly injure him. Obi-Wan was more calm, deflecting the lightning and engaging the Sith in combat, but Dooku wounded him with his lightsaber and Anakin returned with his and Obi-Wan's lightsabers. Dooku managed to disarm Anakin of one of the blades, but Anakin fought on with the second. Eventually, Dooku broke off briefly to assess Anakin's strength. Returning to the duel, Dooku cut off Anakin's right arm and prepared to kill them both, but Yoda arrived and confronted him. Despite Dooku's obvious power, Yoda quickly proved to be both stronger in the Force and more skilled with a lightsaber; he deflected all of Dooku's Force attacks with ease and quickly seized the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel. Unable to defeat Yoda, and worried of incoming Republic reinforcements, Dooku distracted the ancient Jedi Master by nearly causing a pillar to fall on Anakin and Obi-Wan, forcing Yoda to save them while Dooku fled, escaping in his personal solar sailer, even as it was fired on by Padme and several clone troopers who had arrived to reinforce the Jedi.

Dooku went to Coruscant to meet with his master, Darth Sidious, whom he gave the plans to their new weapon: the [[Death Star]]. He also informed him that the Clone Wars had begun, setting the Republic on a path to becoming a ruthless dictatorship as the future Empire.

===''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith''===
Count Dooku fought Obi-Wan and Anakin once more three years later on General Grievous' flagship, the ''Invisible Hand''. Grievous had captured Chancellor Palpatine and Dooku fought to make sure the Chancellor was not rescued. The Jedi used lesser styles to lull him into a false sense of confidence, before suddenly switching to more advanced styles to catch him off guard. Adjusting to this feint, Dooku took out Kenobi first and caused a balcony to fall on him and taunted Anakin as the battle continued between the two of them, as he had sensed Anakin was holding back, lest he give in to anger. An enraged Anakin eventually cut off both his hands and took his lightsaber as a souvenir. Palpatine, who was secretly Dooku's master Darth Sidious, ordered Anakin to kill him, shocking Dooku as this was never part of the plan as he knew it. After initial hesitation, Anakin brutally decapitated Dooku; Count Dooku's last thought was: "the way of the Sith is treachery".

This was Anakin's first cold-blooded murder, unknowingly paving the way for him to succeed Dooku as Palpatine's new apprentice as Darth Vader. Although Anakin expressed guilt for killing Dooku, stating that it was not the Jedi way, Palpatine assured and congratulated Anakin, stating that Dooku was too dangerous to be kept alive and saying Anakin's killing of Dooku was only natural in revenge for Dooku cutting off Anakin's arm, reminding Anakin of when he sought revenge on the Tusken Raiders for his mother's death.

==Trivia==
*In the original drafts for ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'', Dooku was to have been revealed by Palpatine to have orchestrated the Tusken Raiders' abduction and murder of Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother. However, this was written out because of the way it interfered with the dynamic of the duel.
*George Lucas has stated that Palpatine tricked Dooku by telling him that if Anakin could defeat Dooku, Palpatine would intervene to stop the duel, and have Anakin join them. However, in truth, this was only a ruse for Palpatine to gain Anakin as his true apprentice.
*He acts as a foil to his master, Emperor Palpatine. While Anakin Skywalker was led to believe that Dooku was too dangerous to be left alive, but Dooku ultimately had redeeming qualities that might had led to his redemption. Emperor Palpatine in contrast was completely evil and would never redeem himself, being ultimately the one who was too dangerous to be left alive, as he was even plotting Jedi genocide.
