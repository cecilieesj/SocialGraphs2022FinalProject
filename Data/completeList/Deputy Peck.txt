}}'''Deputy Peck''' is [[Sheriff Callie]]'s trusty deputy and the deuteragonist of ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]''. He is a red woodpecker with big yellow eyes and dressed up in a brown hat, a blue bandana, brown boots and a gold star badge. Peck owns a mule named Clementine, whose slow, easygoing nature sometimes contrasts with Peck's character. Peck likes to eat corn and prairie peppers, but his favorite food is Trail Mix, as shown in "[[Peck's Trail Mix Mix-Up]]".

==Personality==
Deputy Peck is generally loyal, honest, hardworking, and kind. However, he is also a bit of a perfectionist and can be very impatient with others. 
In some instances he shows some other negative traits, such as ''Horseshoe Peck'', in which he discovers the sport of horseshoes, he develops into a braggart and bad sport, and Callie has to teach him some humility.

In ''Jail Crazy'', Peck is made the substitute sheriff to fill in for Callie. He soon became obsessed with the word of the rulebook and began to send everyone to jail for "rule-breaking". But when Billy Goat the Kid broke out and cornered Peck, it taught him a lesson in being nice and friendly regardless of the rules. In "Parotting Pedro", Peck put Pedro in jail for imitating him. 
In ''"''Peck's Trail Mix Mix Up''"'', Peck accidentally pokes a hole in his trail mix bag and begins to accuse others of taking it.
