==Role in the film==
Pearl is an elderly farmer who owns a farm called Little Patch of Heaven. Like any farmer, she tends to her farm and livestock. She is shown to love and care for all the animals that live on her farm, especially [[Maggie]], a show cow that was sold by her previous owner and whom Pearl took in. She is also revealed to keep a few photos she had taken of her farm animals as fond memories, including one of her bottle-feeding [[Grace]] when she was a calf.

Later, [[Sheriff Sam Brown]] arrives on the farm and shows Pearl another bank notice, explaining that the banks are going to auction off her home if she can't pay the full amount she owes them because they are losing so much money due to cattle rustlers leaving behind so many bankrupt ranchers. He then suggests that Pearl sell off a few of her livestock to pay the debt. This angers Pearl, who explains that she would never sell her farm animals because they're family. She then chases the Sheriff off her property in a fury, sending him running.

Pearl is later seen mourning over her three cows, who had gone AWOL in an attempt to save her farm, and wonders if she will ever see them again. Nevertheless, she is also upset about losing Little Patch of Heaven to the highest bidder, as she had no choice but to auction off her remaining farm animals after [[Alameda Slim]], disguised as Yancy O'Del, had closed the deal with the Sheriff.

In the film's climax, when Pearl sees a train (which her cows hijacked earlier to get home) coming dangerously behind, she rushes forward to grab the [[chicks]] that were being auctioned before they get hurt and shoves the Sheriff out of the way of the train just as he notices it. After a brief battle, the cows get the best of Slim when his disguise is removed, revealing his true identity. Pearl becomes shocked and horrified that the auctioneer who is buying her farm is Alameda Slim, and the outlaw is then roped up, gagged, and arrested by Sam. The Sheriff later arrives with the reward money and asks Pearl if she can find any use for it, to which she happily states that her farm is saved and pays the debt she owes the bank. Afterwards, a photographer takes a picture of Pearl and her livestock, with everyone smiling save [[Jeb]].

At the end of the film, Pearl dances with Sam as they and all the farm animals (who are also seen dancing) celebrate Little Patch of Heaven being saved and re-opened.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Pearl appeared at the "Little Patch of Heaven Petting Farm" (which was actually called the "[[Big Thunder Ranch]]" area themed to ''Home on the Range'') at [[Disneyland]] for meet and greets for promotion of the film. After the attraction closed in [[2005]], Pearl had vanished and has not made appearances at any of the Disney Parks since.

==Trivia==
*In the original version of ''Home on the Range'', Pearl was going to be a male farmer before the script changed.
