==History==
Dog-lobsters are mutant cuddle buddies, that are mixed between dogs and lobsters. It may seem cute, but also dangerous. This creature has the body and head of a dog, six lobster legs, lobster claws, and a lobster tail.

[[Steven Barkin|Mr. Barkin]] and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] saw what appeared to be a dog coming out of the trees, but when it came out of the trees it is revealed that the dog is a Dog-Lobster; a [[Rabbit-Rhino]] scared the Dog-Lobster, until [[Amy Hall|DNAmy]] arrived with her own Dog-Lobster and was ashamed that her Rabbit-Rhinoceros ran away.
