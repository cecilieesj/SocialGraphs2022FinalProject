He is designed to shred important documents. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her "cats".

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 134 was the 134th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to shred important documents. 134 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s yard, 134's pod being one of them.

At an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 134's pod for an apricot and placed it in a colander for later consumption along with numerous other pods.

After [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] redecorated Mrs. Hasagawa's yard without her permission, she was less than thrilled with the results, but decided to thank them for their work with the "apricots." The pods were then revealed, but before Lilo and Stitch could stop her, she washed them with a watering can, thus activating the experiments.

After his activation, 134 began to carry out his primary function by shredding Mrs. Hasagawa's important mail. Lilo and Stitch believed the experiments to be a danger to Mrs. Hasagawa and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], decided to capture them all. 134 was then captured by unknown means.

134 and the other experiments were about to be taken away, but were returned to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. 134 was then named Shredder.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Shredder, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Shredder participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', Shredder is seen with a purple nose, but in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', he is seen with a green nose.
*Shredder was activated off-screen.
*An error on the ''Leroy & Stitch'' DVD cover shows Shredder's ears on his back instead of his head.
*Frank Welker, Shredder's voice actor, voiced Rahzar and Tokka, the mutant minions and "sons" of the more well-known Shredder, in the film ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze''.<br />
