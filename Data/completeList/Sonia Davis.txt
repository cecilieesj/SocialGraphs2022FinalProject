Everyone panics as a major snow storm is about to hit Brighton. [[Scratch (The Ghost and Molly McGee)|Scratch]] reveals that it is caused by the spirit of a failed ice skater named Sonia Davis. The McGees visit her as she tries to perfect her routine, but needs a partner. [[Pete McGee|Pete]] is revealed to be a former ice skater himself and becomes Sonia's partner, but she threatens to freeze Brighton forever if their routine fails. The two of them perform flawlessly, but fail at their very last move. Instead of being angry, Sonia realizes that she had a lot of fun and gives up on winning, finally able to pass on.
