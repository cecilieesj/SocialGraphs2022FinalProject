'''Air Bud''', also known as '''Buddy''', is a golden retriever and the titular protagonist of the [[Air Bud (series)|series of the same name]]. He plays a different sport in each film (basketball, football, soccer, baseball, and volleyball, respectively). In ''Air Bud: World Pup'', he becomes the father of five puppies: [[Budderball]], [[B-Dawg]], [[Buddha]], [[MudBud]], and [[RoseBud]], though none of them are given actual names until the first ''[[Air Buddies]]'' movie.
