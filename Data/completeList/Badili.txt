==Role in the Series==
===''[[The Trouble With Galagos]]''===
The galagos tell the Lion Guard that a leopard has moved into their tree and they head to the galagos' tree, where Badili first appears sleeping in the branches. When the Lion Guard confront Badili, he tries to growl at them, But his courage instantly fails him and he cowers begging the team not to hurt him. He says he thought they were baboons because he dreamed about them chasing him. Ono asks him if he's the big, scary leopard, but Badili says no and introduces himself saying a he's big friendly leopard.

When urged by the Lion Guard to return to his home in Mirihi Forest, Badili reluctantly does but is confronted and intimidated by a larger leopard named [[Mapigano]], who had driven Badili out of Mirihi Forest. Angered by Mapigano's attitude, The Lion Guard come to Badili's aid and force Mapigano to leave.

The next day, the Lion Guard find Badili back in the [[Pride Lands]] and learn that Mapigano has driven him out again. Kion realizes that it must be Badili himself who must get rid of Mapigano for good. The Lion Guard train Badili in how to be brave and confident.

When deemed ready, Badili returns to Mirihi Forest and confronts Mapigano, who at first laughs at Badili's attempts of bravery and attacks him. Badili eventually plucks up courage and roars at Mapigano, causing the latter to flee Mirihi Forest for good. The Lion Guard congratulate Badili on his victory to which he thanks them for their help.

== Relationships ==

=== Friends ===
====[[Kion]]====

Kion was the one who agreed to teach Badili how to be fierce so he could defeat Mapigano and even defended the leopard from him at first. When Badili's training was complete, Kion knows he can defeat Mapigano and when he does, he congratulated the leopard and said that all he had to do was be himself which is what he proudly did and the two remain close as of now.

====[[Bunga]]====

Bunga was the one who taught Badili to be brave and even defended him from Mapigano at first when he couldn’t.

Later after his training is completed and he defeats the bully, Bunga and the others are extremely proud of Badili and the two as of now are on good terms.

====[[Fuli]]====

Fuli was the one who helped Badili learn to be fast and even defended him Mapigano when he couldn’t.

Once he completes his training, Badili is able to defeat his bully and Fuli  is quite happy when he does. The two remain on good terms as of now.

====[[Beshte]]====

Beshte was the one who helped Badili get stronger and defended him from Mapigano when he couldn’t and, once he completes his training, he is able to stop his bully which makes Beshte proud of him.

The two remain on good terms as of now.

====[[Ono]]====

Ono was the one who helped Badili with eye contact and even defended him from Mapigano when he couldn’t and once he completes it, he isn’t able to defeat his bully. At first Badili is worried that the Guard may have seen how scared he was, but Ono states that he saw a leopard standing up for himself, which delights Badili and the two remain on good terms for now.

====[[Laini]]====

Laini was scared of Badili at first. He wanted to sleep her tree and live with her group. Laini didn't like that idea and wanted him gone. The guard helped Badili go back home and he gave them their tree back. The two seem to be on good terms after that.

=== Enemies ===
====[[Mapigano]]====

Mapigano bullies Badili constantly, believing him to be a ''scaredy cat''. When Mapigano takes over his home, he refuses to compromise by sharing it, knowing that Badili is not powerful or strong enough to fight back.

Mapigano uses harsh words to force the other leopard into submission, but thanks to the Lion Guard. Badili finally plucks up the courage to fight back Mapigano who backs down and runs off.
