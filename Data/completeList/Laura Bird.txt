'''Laura Bird''' is the year 8 Summer School teacher at Cheevers High School in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''. She only appears in the episode "[[Summer of Our Discontent]]".

==Personality==
Mrs. Bird is the year 8 Remedial English (Summer School) teacher at Cheevers High School. In class, she assumes that each student is incredibly dumb (usually by spelling out her last name, which is a simple word) and referring to Summer as the "hot time". She is considered a pretty harsh grader, although 3 out of 4 times she is accurate about her grading. Mrs. Bird's full name is revealed by a Summer School classmate named Brick who has repeated the same class for 4 years. Laura's first name was revealed by Brick. In the episode, Mrs. Bird shows much love for [[Zack Martin]], although she once gave him detention for being a clown. Additionally, she seems to be a good teacher, even though many students don't really like her.

==Appearance==
Laura Bird wears average clothes, usually in a professional manner due to her being a teacher. She has her hair mid-length and she looks in her late 40s - mid 50s.
