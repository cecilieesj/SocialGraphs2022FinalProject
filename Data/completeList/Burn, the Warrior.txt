'''Burn''' is the unofficial leader of the Dojo. Burn takes pride in being the best of the Dojo group, however, with the arrival of [[Ed, the Protector|Ed]], he's felt his role in the group is challenged. Because of this, he's hard on Ed every chance he gets. He rides a bike that is like a motorcycle but with only one flaming wheel. Burn wears a black costume with orange flames. He also hates a lot of other courier teams.

He's the oldest kid of the Dojo Team.
