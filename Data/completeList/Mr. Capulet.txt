==Role in the film==
Mr. Capulet lives at Not 2B Verona Drive whose garden is the home of the Red Gnomes and is lives next door to his rival, [[Miss Montague]]. His home has a nautical theme, implying that he's worked with boats, or at least has an interest in them. He first appears in the film leaving his home at the same time as Miss Montague and trades insults with her. Unknown to the both of them, the gnomes that live in their gardens share the same animosity toward each other. He also seems to drive some sort of Smart car.
