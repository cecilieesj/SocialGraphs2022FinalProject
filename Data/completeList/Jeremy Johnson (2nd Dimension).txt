Jeremy has an extended cameo in the movie. He aids Phineas and Ferb in their mission to save a captured Candace and is responsible for breaking down Candace's cell door. He compliments Candace, during which the two exchange romantic glances at each other before getting back to business.

He then appears towards the end of the film, where he shows up in the 2nd Dimension right after [[Candace Flynn|Candace-1]] reassures Candace, who is now unsure of what to do with her life after Doofenshmirtz is arrested, that there are other pursuits for her to take, to which she replies that she'll "take it under consideration"
