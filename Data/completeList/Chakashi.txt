He was voiced by the late Floyd Red Crow Westerman.

==Role in the film==
He was turning those who he deemed as threats into dust coyote ghosts so that the secret of Crystal Guardian will be kept safe for all eternity. He is not to be considered evil, as he's nothing more than a simple spirit guardian with an over-protective mission. Thankfully, [[Milo Thatch|Milo]] and the gang was able to convince him that they will keep his secret, and have no intention of profiting from or destroying the ancient Indian village. Thus, they were able to avoid being turned into sand coyotes.
