'''Garrett Grayson''' is a character on ''[[Raven's Home]]''. He is the father of [[Levi Grayson|Levi]] and the ex-husband of [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]]. He is first mentioned in "[[Baxter's Back!]]".

== History ==
Sometime after [[Bayside High School|high school]], [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]] met a man named Garrett who she fell in love with and eventually married. Chelsea's mother and [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] both disapproved of Garrett. According to Chelsea, after marrying her, he doted on her and refused to let her do any housework, doing all the cooking and cleaning. During their marriage, the pair had a son, whom they named [[Levi Grayson|Levi]]. Despite this, however, Garrett became unfaithful and fell in love with another woman who, unbeknownst to him was a federal agent. Chelsea created an invention called the "schmop", which earned her a vast fortune. He stole all of his and Chelsea's money, but was caught and ended up being arrested for tax evasion. He was later sentenced by the judge, and sent to prison while Chelsea managed to reclaim some of her money. Before Garrett left, he gave Levi a drone to play with. Chelsea and Garrett eventually divorced.

Garrett is mentioned several times throughout the episode "[[Vending the Rules]]". Chelsea constantly reinforces into Levi's mind, what a great man Garrett is, to the displeasure of Raven, who realizes that Chelsea is in denial, and suppressing her inner anger. Raven tries to help her release all her suppressed feelings through various activities. Meanwhile, Levi begins using his dad's philosophies to earn money at school, by selling snacks, despite being against the rules. When Chelsea realizes  what he's doing, the two have a talk and discuss Garrett, telling Levi that he is a bad man, who has done bad things which lead to the break up of their family.
