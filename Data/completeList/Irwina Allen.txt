'''Irwina Allen''' is a one-time character and the main villain of the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode, "''[[Risky Beesness]]''".

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
She is a tall and slender human with fair skin, brown hair, black glasses and wears a white lab coat. When she rehearses for her rock and roll gig, she also wears a purple and yellow bee rock-and-roll outfit with a mind control device built into her helmet.

==Role in the episode==
Irwina is a scientist who works at Bug-Out Exterminators. But even though everyone wants her knowledge of insects, she always wants to be a star of rock and roll. Her boss, Mr. Sneed, is not too pleased about Irwina indulging in her dreams on company time. Irwina uses a sound device to hypnotize a swarm of bees under the leadership of [[Queenie]] to steal a bunch of instruments for a rock and roll gig. She plots to upstage [[Chip and Dale|Dale]]'s favorite rock and roll band, Iron Goose, and take their place on stage at the rock concert. Unfortunately during her concert, the Rescue Rangers destroy the device planted in her headgear, freeing the bees who then turn on the rock-crazy scientist and chase her off-stage.
