'''Gus Molehill''' appeared in the second season ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_211:_Switched_at_Birth Switched at Birth]." He was voiced by [[Jason Alexander]], his body was puppeteered by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Tate Jack Tate] and his face was played by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/David_Greenaway David Greenaway]. He was the father of Aubrey Molehill and husband of [[Glenda Molehill]]. His personality, however, was close to that of [[Baby Sinclair]], and he preferred Baby over his real son. Although he was happy when science proved that Baby was his real son, he was willing to take back Aubrey when [[Solomon the Great]] divided Baby in two so that the Sinclairs and the Molehills could each have half.
