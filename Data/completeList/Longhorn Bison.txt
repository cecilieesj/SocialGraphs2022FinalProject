The '''Longhorn Bison''' (''Bison latifrons'') are characters featured in the [[2015]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''.

==Background==
In ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', longhorn bison are shown to be depicted to show equivalent reminiscence to modern day longhorn cattle used by rustlers in order to survive. Their main obstacles throughout the film are the Velociraptors who are also attempting to survive by stealing Butch's longhorns much to the T-rex family looking for their lost herd in order to survive.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''===
In a plan to bring [[Spot (The Good Dinosaur)|Spot]] back to his family while [[Butch (The Good Dinosaur)|Butch]] and his family are looking for their lost herd, Spot sniffs out a clue to finding the herd by looking at a longhorn bison carcass, which is linked to the Tyrannosaurus family's lost herd and also to the [[Velociraptors (The Good Dinosaur)|Velociraptor rustlers]]. Along the way, [[Arlo]] and Spot are tasked to bring in the rustlers so that Butch and his family could come to retaliate against them. Just as the Velociraptors arrive, Arlo, Spot, Butch, and his family, fight against them during the ambush. As soon as the ambush ends, Butch, [[Nash and Ramsey|Nash]], [[Nash and Ramsey|Ramsey]], and Arlo roar at the rustlers to stay away from the longhorn herd. Having protected the longhorns, Butch and his family rest at the campfire where they share their stories with Arlo.

The next day, when Arlo notices winter is coming, he and Spot proceed to go back home while the T-rex family continues herding the longhorns.

==Video game appearances==
===''[[The Good Dinosaur: Dino Crossing]]''===
Longhorn bison appear in later levels of the game as obstacles the player must avoid. They also appear as obstacles in Endless Mode.

==Trivia==
*In real life, dinosaurs and longhorn bison did not live together in the same epoch.
*According to the audio commentary and merchandise, they are identified as "Bisodon", a pun on "bison" and the suffix "-don" (a common suffix for several dinosaur species).
