'''Kristoff Bjorgman'''<ref name=":0">''Frozen'': The Essential Guide, p. 32</ref> is the tritagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2013]] animated feature film ''[[Frozen]]'', and a major character in its [[2019]] [[Frozen II|sequel]]. He is a Sami<ref name=":2">Lee, Jennifer (September 23, 2013). "''Frozen'' Final Shooting Draft", p. 1</ref> outdoorsman that worked as an ice harvester with his reindeer [[Sven]]. Having been an orphan<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /> who was raised by a colony of [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]] in the mountains, Kristoff was initially wary of humans, believing them to be untrustworthy, cheating crooks. His outlook would slowly change upon meeting [[Anna|Princess Anna]], whose warmheartedness would prove that people aren't as bad as Kristoff believed.

By the end of their adventure, Kristoff developed a romantic relationship with Anna, and was welcomed into the royal family of [[Arendelle]]. Three years into their relationship,<ref name=":4" /> Kristoff proposed to Anna, thus becoming her fiancé.

==Background==
Kristoff was orphaned at a young age and placed in an orphanage thereafter.<ref name=":3" /> He was nevertheless too adventurous and free-spirited to be contained in such a facility; he spent a majority of his time sneaking out and exploring the surrounding wilderness.<ref name=":3" /> With a fascination of ice, Kristoff also occupied his time by tagging behind [[Arendelle]]'s team of ice harvesters to observe their ethics in hopes of garnering their skill and eventually becoming an ice harvester himself.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourkidsmom.com/interview-filmmakers-disneys-frozen/|title=Interview With the Filmmakers of Disney’s Frozen #FrozenBluRay|author=Ashley|date=March 2014|website=OurKidsMom.com|format=Blog}}</ref>

Kristoff is always accompanied by his reindeer, [[Sven]] — his pet, best friend, and business partner. The two met during Kristoff's childhood, wherein during which, he found and rescued the reindeer fawn.<ref>''Frozen'': The Essential Guide, p. 35</ref> Since then, the two became inseparable and built a relationship akin to that of brothers. Kristoff's care for Sven was so great that he eventually began living by the philosophy that "[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People|reindeer are better than people]]", to which Sven would agree. Furthermore, although Sven cannot speak, both he and Kristoff have a mutual understanding of one another. So much that Kristoff has a habit to literally voice Sven's thoughts in a gruff, goofy, exaggerated tone. Sven doesn't seem to mind, and the voice-overs are surprisingly accurate. Interestingly, Kristoff uses this quirk to talk himself into doing the right thing in times of uncertainty.

===Official Description===
:''Kristoff is a true outdoorsman. He lives high up in the mountains where he harvests ice and sells it to the kingdom of [[Arendelle]]. Rough around the edges, Kristoff's the strong, no-nonsense type, who follows his own set of rules. He may seem like a loner, but he always has his best friend by his side—a loyal and extremely mangy reindeer named Sven.''

===Personality===
During his first proper introduction in the film, Kristoff is presented as a miserly loner, with a lack of respect for those around him—specifically in terms of personal boundaries and sensitivity. This is a direct result of growing up with a family of mythical creatures and wildlife, as opposed to other humans. Though his upbringing included a large family and at least one close friend, Kristoff tends to look out, mostly, for himself and can be rather selfish from time to time because of this, with his focus primarily on his ice business and life upon the mountains. The ice harvester spent a large portion of his early life in the mountains because of this, becoming an individualist and avid survivor in the wilderness, and constantly proving himself to be self-reliant and efficient when facing various perils throughout the course of the original film.

In spite of his loner nature and dislike for society, Kristoff has a loving heart, and at his core, is rather harmless, innocent, and protective. This is first evidenced by his relationship with Sven, whom he treats as his pet and closest friend, and is shown to value the reindeer's life above his own several times. Kristoff's inner softness and loving aura is further emphasized by his family, the [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]], who reveal Kristoff to be (despite his various flaws and shortcomings) sensitive and sweet when given the same treatment, which he proves through his friendship and eventual relationship with Anna.

Through Anna, Kristoff is shown to be loving, respectful, and completely selfless and sacrificial. Eventually falling for the princess's fun-loving nature, selflessness, and persistence, Kristoff allows himself to open up to the world around him, revealing himself to be rather bashful and quirky, mirroring Anna's personality. Also, as a result of his love for Anna, Kristoff is willing to risk his own life and happiness, without hesitation, all in hopes of the former's own happiness. This ties into a pivotal line featured in the film: "Love is putting someone else's needs before yours..."; which was directly used to reference Kristoff's willingness to conceal his affections for Anna, for the sake of the princess's possible future [[Hans|with another]]. As mentioned, he mirrors Anna in his quirkiness, best evidenced by his relationship with Sven, as the two have been shown to nonchalantly share food, "sing" duets, and engage in "conversations"—a further example of his peculiar traits.

Quite notably, however—midst a cast of colorful and larger-than-life characters in a world to match—Kristoff appears to be more of a straight man, reacting to the mystical situations he and the other characters encounter with a generally down-to-earth viewpoint. Though not a pessimist, he acts more of a realist, though his care for others ultimately leads him to perform death-defying acts for the greater good.

In ''[[Frozen Fever]]'', Kristoff's softer side is shown to have grown, and become a more prominent aspect of his personality. With Anna's sister, [[Elsa]], he is shown to be fairly laid-back, comforting, and encouraging, looking on the brighter side of a situation, no matter the level of importance. Nevertheless, he is still shown to become flustered around Anna, as a result of his affections for her.

In ''[[Frozen II]]'', Kristoff is serious in settling down in his relationship with Anna despite his lack of communication skills getting in the way of his attempts to propose to her. After his failed attempt in which he, with [[Ryder Nattura|Ryder]]'s help, accidentally did it with [[Yelana]], who flat out declined it, he feels insecure and unsure whether Anna's concerns for her sister canceled out her own feelings for him during "[[Lost in the Woods]]". Despite this, Kristoff's feelings for Anna remain strong where he saved Anna from the [[Earth Giants]] just in time to help her get to [[King Runeard|Runeard]]'s [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] and as well as saving her again when she failed to get out of the collapsing dam in time.

===Physical appearance===
Kristoff's build is a distinct variation on most male leads in Disney animated features (Hans is a perfect example of the traditional stature). On the flip side, Kristoff has broad shoulders and a rugged, muscular build. His build is a realistic consequence of his rough life as a mountain-dwelling ice harvester.

Kristoff is 21 years old in the first movie<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tinyjellyrex/status/406637403181305856|date=November 29, 2013|author=Lee, Jennifer|website=Twitter|format=Tweet|title=@alittlejelee I adored Frozen.

He has light brown eyes and fair skin with a light dusting of freckles across his nose. His nose is quite big and his cheeks tend to redden a lot because of the cold weather.

At the beginning of the film (when he is a child), he wears a royal purple long-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and a purple sash. When we next see him as an adult, he is wearing a thick dark tunic with a fur-lined burgundy dark crimson collar, a blue patch on his right elbow, a burgundy sash tied around his waist, a dark blue long-sleeved undershirt, olive mittens, thick dark trousers, a dark bobble-hat (which he later gives to Anna when she is freezing to death), and fur-lined dark brown boots with pointed toes. At the end of the film, he wears pretty much the same outfit, minus the thick tunic and gloves, because it has become much warmer.

In the sequel, he now wears a royal delivery attire in shades of brown. He later wears this during their travels to [[the Enchanted Forest]]. When he stays with Elsa and Anna at the castle, he wears a dark purple long robe along with his sleeping attire.

At the end of the film, Kristoff's rugged blond hair is now slicked back, and he wears a dark purple royal outfit.

By night, Kristoff manages to obtain his own small block of ice, much to his pride, and follows behind the harvesters as they make their leave from the mountains. During their trip home, the horses of [[King Agnarr]] and [[Queen Iduna]] rush past Kristoff, leaving behind a peculiar trail of ice. Curious, Kristoff and Sven follow the royal family to the [[Valley of the Living Rock]], home to a colony of mystical [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]]. As Kristoff and Sven look on in amazement how [[Grand Pabbie]] heals a [[Anna|little girl]], they are discovered by a female troll named [[Bulda]]. Bulda instantly takes a liking to the two and decides to adopt them as her own. From there, Kristoff and Sven grow up with the trolls in the valley. Years later, the once wide-eyed Kristoff has grown into a cynical, antisocial, and jaded man with animosity towards society. He and Sven have since become professional ice harvesters and no longer live amongst the trolls, though they make occasional visits. Due to their low source of income, the two live as nomads—selling their ice by day and traversing through Arendelle for a place to sleep by night.

[[File:49272598262.jpg|thumb|250px|Kristoff meeting Anna at Oaken's shop.]]
On the night of her coronation, [[Elsa|Queen Elsa]]'s powers over ice and snow are revealed to the public. To protect her people, Elsa sentences herself to exile and establishes [[the North Mountain]] as her new home. In doing so, she accidentally sets off an eternal winter. Kristoff and Sven take notice of [[Let It Go|Elsa's arrival]] and travel to [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna]] for supplies and carrots. Inside, he comes across Princess Anna, who is searching for Elsa. When asked about the peculiar weather, Kristoff nonchalantly notes it to be coming from the North Mountain. Unfortunately, the prices for Kristoff's mountain gear have been spiked due to the supply and demand issue stemmed from the unexpected winter. Kristoff makes the poor choice of calling [[Oaken|the store owner]] a "crook" in response and is immediately thrown out. Despite his lack of goods, Kristoff and Sven retire to a nearby barn to rest for the night. They are soon visited by Anna, who asks Kristoff to escort her to the North Mountain. Kristoff refuses, until Anna reveals to have purchased Kristoff's mountain gear, and claims to know how to stop the winter. In gratitude for Anna's services, and for the sake of his endangered ice business, Kristoff accepts the proposal, and they set off that night, per Anna's demands.

[[File:Svenconvince.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sven convincing Kristoff to stay with Anna.]]
As the travel begins, Kristoff inquires Elsa's reasoning behind freezing the entire kingdom. He's incredulous at Anna falling for [[Hans]] and wanting to marry him within hours of meeting him and he too calls her out for it. The conversation is cut short when a pack of hungry [[Wolves (Frozen)|wolves]] attacks them. They manage to evade the wolves by jumping over a chasm, but the sled plummets to the bottom of the cliff along with the supplies. Anna offers to replace the sled and supplies and offers to let Kristoff out of the deal. Knowing Anna would die on her own, however, Kristoff reluctantly decides to stick with the princess for the remainder of the journey, much to Sven's delight. The following day, they come across a talking snowman named [[Olaf]], who offers to guide the group to Elsa. Upon arriving at the [[Elsa's Ice Palace|ice palace]], Kristoff is left in awe at its beauty. In spite of this, Kristoff is forced to remain outside per Anna's wishes, as she wouldn't want Elsa to cause more havoc at the sight of a man (referring to the debacle with Hans). Kristoff expressed grief over the matter, but abides and waits patiently alongside Olaf. Upon hearing Anna in distress, however, Kristoff rushes into the palace and tends to her. When Elsa orders the group to leave, a fearful Kristoff tries to oblige but Anna refuses to leave without her sister.

[[File:Anna and Kristoff running.jpg|thumb|250px|Kristoff and Anna escaping Marshmallow.]]
This forces Elsa to create a giant snow monster named [[Marshmallow]] to forcefully throw the group out. Anna retaliates by throwing a snowball at the beast, which angers him. Kristoff and Anna rush down the mountain while being hotly pursued by Marshmallow. By working together, they eventually evade him by cliff-diving and landing safely on a blanket of snow below. After Kristoff assists Anna in getting back onto her feet, the two share an affectionate glance in mutual gratitude for saving each other. Unfortunately, this is short-lived, as Anna starts to panic over Elsa's refusal to return to Arendelle. She also worries about Kristoff's ice business, to which the latter replies by calmly assuring his ice business is no longer a priority. Just then, Kristoff notices Anna's hair beginning to turn white and deduces that the phenomenon is due to Elsa having struck Anna back at the palace. Fortunately, Kristoff believes he has a solution, and leads the gang to the Valley of the Living Rock, to consult [[Grand Pabbie]].

[[File:Theonlyfixerupper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kristoff and Anna's "[[Fixer Upper]]" wedding.]]
Along the way, Kristoff starts to open up to Anna by revealing his past, including how he and Sven were lonely orphans until they were taken in by their adoptive family. Though he loves his family, Kristoff warns Anna that they can be rather overbearing, stubborn, and loud at times, though Anna assures she doesn't mind. With his insecurities somewhat lowered, Kristoff introduces Anna and Olaf to his family, who are currently dormant as rocks. Assuming Kristoff is delusional, Anna and Olaf try to leave until the trolls finally reveal themselves. Upon noticing Anna, Bulda assumes her to be Kristoff's girlfriend. The two deny any romance, but Bulda and the trolls try to convince them otherwise, telling them they're meant for each other. They arrange an entire wedding, and in during which, Kristoff finds himself falling for Anna. Before the wedding is complete, Anna nearly faints and loses balance. Pabbie is unable to heal her, and informs them that Anna must perform an "act of true love" or else she'll freeze forever. Bulda believes "true love's kiss" may qualify, which prompts Kristoff to take Anna back to Arendelle so she can receive a kiss from Hans.

[[File:Frozen-disneyscreencaps.com-931.jpg|thumb|250px|Kristoff solemnly accepting his love for Anna.]]
At the castle, Kristoff escorts Anna to the care of the royal staff. Now that she has returned to Hans, Kristoff sadly takes his leave from Arendelle with Sven by his side. Along the way, Sven, who's fully aware of Kristoff's feelings for Anna, pressures him to go back. Kristoff's insecurities drive him to refuse until a giant snowstorm (inadvertently created by Elsa) begins to form around the castle. Presuming Anna to be in danger, Kristoff and Sven race back to rescue her. At the castle, Hans reveals that he doesn't actually love Anna, as he was only using her to become the new king of Arendelle. He instead denies Anna a kiss and leaves her to die in a locked room within the castle. Anna is eventually rescued by Olaf, who reveals Kristoff's feelings for the princess. Though shocked, Anna musters up her remaining strength to brave Elsa's storm and find Kristoff so that he can give her "true love's kiss". Due to the blinding whiteout, however, both Kristoff and Anna have a difficult time reaching each other. At one point, Sven falls into the fjord and apparently drowns. Kristoff looks on in horror, but Sven survives and makes his way to safety before urging Kristoff to push forward.

[[File:Frozen-2disneyscreencaps.com-10120.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A distraught Kristoff upon finding a freezing Anna on the fjord.]]
At one point, the blizzard comes to a sudden standstill, clearing the pathway for Kristoff and Anna. As Anna weakly tries to meet him halfway, she notices Hans and Elsa not too far, where the evil prince is seconds away from murdering the Snow Queen with his sword. Choosing to sacrifice her life for her sister, Anna takes one final look at Kristoff before leaping to the rescue, putting herself between Elsa and Hans, and freezing to death seconds before the sword hits her. The sword shatters against Anna's frozen hand, and Hans is knocked out from the impact. When Elsa realizes what happened, she tearfully mourns her sister, as a heartbroken Kristoff watches on. However, Anna's sacrifice was an "act of true love", and she is soon revived from her death, much to Kristoff's relief. The experience helps Elsa to realize that love is the key to thawing Arendelle and uses her power to lift the curse.

[[File:Annakristoffkiss.png|thumb|250px|Kristoff and Anna's blossoming romance.]]
As Hans awakens, Kristoff moves in to pummel him. As for Anna's request, Kristoff pulls himself back while Anna punches Hans herself. Afterward, Anna and Elsa embrace, and in during which, Anna looks lovingly and appreciatively to Kristoff. Following Arendelle's restoration, a celebration is held by Elsa in the castle courtyard. Before attending, Anna takes a blindfolded Kristoff to the docks, where she surprises him with a brand new sled and lute. Taken aback out of modesty, Kristoff tries to deny the offer, but Anna insists, announcing that Elsa has dubbed Kristoff Arendelle's "Official Ice Master and Deliverer". An elated Kristoff twirls Anna in his arms, and awkwardly asks permission to bestow a kiss of gratitude. Anna accepts, and the two share their first kiss, cementing a romantic relationship. Kristoff is last seen joining Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and Sven in the castle courtyard, where citizens of the kingdom gather to embrace the return of their queen by enjoying a newly-created ice skating rink.

===''[[Frozen Fever]]''===
[[File:Frozen Fever 37.png|thumb|left|250px|Kristoff in ''Frozen Fever''.]]
Following the events of the film, Kristoff and Sven have become welcomed members of Anna and Elsa's extended family. On one particular day, Anna's 19th birthday arrives, and both Kristoff and Sven are enlisted to assist Elsa and Olaf in making preparations.

As Elsa prepares the cake in the castle courtyard, Kristoff and Sven handle the decorations, notably the banner. Though Elsa feels anxious about the event, the perfectionist inside of her causing distress, Kristoff serves as a token of optimism and reassures the Snow Queen that all is well. Eventually, it is time to awaken Anna, and Kristoff is left in charge to ensure the festivities and decorations remain intact during Elsa's absence. After the Snow Queen's departure, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven eventually fall asleep as they await the queen and princess' return, only to be awakened by miniature baby snowmen known as [[Snowgies]], who immediately begin causing mayhem around the courtyard.

Flustered, Kristoff immediately takes action, with Sven and Olaf following behind. However, the Snowgies prove to be elusive, and they soon spot the birthday cake, instantly marking it as their delectable target. Noticing this, Kristoff ensures the cake remains intact but as the day goes along and more Snowgies randomly appear, the decorations are individually ruined. Even so, by the time Anna and Elsa arrive, the Snowgies have been tamed and the decorations restored as the surprise party kicks off. Kristoff greets Anna with a soft smile and wishes her a happy birthday, as well as excitingly proclaiming his love for her by saying "I love you, baby!" (much to his embarrassment) before the cake is distributed by Sven.

At the end of the short, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf travel to the North Mountain to move the Snowgies in with Marshmallow in Elsa's ice palace.

===''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]''===
Kristoff appears in the featurette, which focuses on Anna and Elsa's first Christmas as a reunited family. Like the rest of Arendelle (save for the royal family), Kristoff has his own holiday tradition—this being an annual celebration honoring a jolly fungus troll that was tragically killed by humans.

===''[[Frozen II]]''===
[[File:Frozen II (12).png|thumb|250px|Kristoff and Sven leading a herd of Northuldra reindeer.]]
Three years after their first meeting, 24-year-old<ref name=":4" /> Kristoff is seriously in love with Anna and has decided to propose to her. He begins spiffing himself up, getting a manicure from Oaken and talking with Sven about his plans, only to admit that he's terrible at things like pulling out rings and setting candlelight dinners. When Elsa hears a mysterious voice leading to [[the Enchanted Forest]] and Anna and Olaf insist on coming along, he agrees to take them there via Sven. He begins his attempts to propose to Anna, but every attempt seems to go badly wrong, as they either accidentally offend her, or she misses them entirely due to being preoccupied. In the Enchanted Forest, Kristoff meets and bonds with [[Ryder Nattura]] over their shared love of reindeer. Ryder, seeing Kristoff's love of Anna, decides to help him, as his people, the [[Northuldra]], have a special method of proposing to a woman which involves reindeer. Anna, however, is distracted following Elsa and thinks that Kristoff has left her. When Kristoff finally unveils his grand proposal, he finds that the woman that has entered the clearing is not Anna, but rather the Northuldra leader [[Yelana]], who comically refuses his proposal with a flat no. She informs him that the princess left with the queen and advises him not to follow as they are long gone.

Kristoff, bereft, sings a reprise of the song "[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]", and has a sort of vision or fantasy in which Sven sings his own response, telling him to let down his guard. He and the other reindeers then perform a power ballad, "[[Lost in the Woods]]", in which he admits that Anna is the love of his life, and he doesn't know what to do without her around.

Later, Anna summons the [[Earth Giants]] to destroy a [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] that is draining the Northuldra [[magic]]. Kristoff, riding on Sven, notices the roaming giants and rushes over just in time to rescue Anna from getting crushed before she could reach the dam. He carries her to the dam so that she can destroy it with the aid of the giants. When [[Lieutenant Mattias]] questions Anna’s actions, Anna reveals that Elsa discovered the truth about the war: King Runeard had constructed the dam to hurt the forest, as opposed to strengthen it. She also reveals that Elsa potentially passed on as she discovered this truth. Learning of the potential death of another sovereign of Arendelle he was sworn to protect, Mattias is convinced to aid Anna in getting the Earth Giants to destroy the dam to lift the curse by drawing their attention with his guardsmen and avenge Elsa. As the dam collapses, Kristoff saves Anna from falling with it alongside Mattias.

In the end, Anna and Kristoff are relieved when they discover that Elsa is alive. They learn from Elsa that their actions in destroying the dam are what saved her, and that she managed to save Arendelle from destruction by the floods of the destroyed dam. Together, Anna, Elsa and Kristoff reconstruct Olaf, who faded away as a result of Elsa’s sacrifice. Kristoff reveals that he has one last thing to say, and with Elsa watching on with a warm smile, this time fully accepting of the marriage proposal Anna is being given by Kristoff, he is finally able to make his proposal, which Anna happily accepts. Elsa abdicates her throne to Anna so that she can stay in the forest, and everyone else prepares to return to Arendelle, where Kristoff gets spiffed up for Anna’s coronation, a gesture she appreciates, though she jokingly states she prefers him in leather. Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven join Anna as she and the newly-promoted General Mattias unveil a new statue of a younger Agnarr and Iduna to honor their memory and the new unity between Arendelle and the Enchanted Forest.

===Other appearances===
An emoticon version of Kristoff appeared in the ''Frozen'', ''Frozen Fever'', and ''Olaf's Frozen Adventure'' entries of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.

Kristoff plays a supporting role in ''[[Frozen: Northern Lights#Shorts|LEGO Frozen Northern Lights]]''. This version of Kristoff is somewhat pompous and pretentious as he repeatedly tries to impress Anna and Elsa with his survival skills, only to fail and end up humiliated in the process. He tends to be the butt of many jokes as a result of this.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 4x06 - Family Business - Photography - Kristoff.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Kristoff appears in the fourth season of ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' along with Anna and Elsa and is played by actor [[Scott Michael Foster]].
In a time frame set two years after the events equivalent to the events of ''Frozen'' and one year before the first Dark Curse within the general ''Once'' timeline, Kristoff and Anna are engaged to be married.

After discovering their parents were heading off to a land known as Mist Haven for an unspecified reason involving Elsa, Anna boards a ship heading for the mysterious land alone, leaving Kristoff behind to both keep Elsa company and keep her distracted. After searching for Anna for a short while, Elsa confronts Kristoff and Sven on her whereabouts. Kristoff attempts to hold the fort, but Elsa eventually realizes the truth and heads out to Arendelle's port in order to stop her sister from journeying off alone. Kristoff follows behind, but by the time they arrive, Anna has already departed.

Sometimes during Anna's quest in the Enchanted Forest, Elsa begins to feel worried about her sister's safety. Kristoff, however, is confident that Anna will be fine. When one of the scouts reported that Hans and [[Hans' Brothers|his twelve brothers]] are approaching Arendelle from the Southern Mountains, Kristoff offers to sneak into the mountains to spy on them, only for Elsa to insist that, as the ruling Queen of Arendelle, she should handle the situation herself. Nevertheless, Kristoff decides to go against her decision and sneak into the Southern Mountains with Sven. He managed to find their campsite and eavesdrop on the princes' new plan to take over Arendelle. He returns to Elsa and informed her that they are planning to use a special urn that can trap people like Elsa with magical powers. Hans suggested having a few soldiers accompanied him to the North Valley to find and destroy the urn before Hans and his brothers find it first. On Elsa's insistent, he should take only her. They travel to the North Valley, where the urn is hidden in a cave. Upon finding it, Hans and three of his brothers arrived and surround them. Hans holds Kristoff hostage and demands Elsa to surrender the urn. Elsa eventually gives Hans the urn and tells Kristoff to go find Anna and save Arendelle. As he's held captive by one of Hans' brothers, Kristoff could only watch as the evil prince uncaps the urn and pours out a living white liquid substance that will supposedly trap Elsa. However, instead of latching onto Elsa, the liquid moves to an isolated spot next to her and morphs into the [[Ingrid|Snow Queen]]. Kristoff and Elsa watch as the Snow Queen turns Hans into an ice statue, as the result of his insult in calling Elsa a monster, while his brothers flee the scene. Though the Snow Queen is wary of Kristoff, Elsa convinced her that he is her ally.

Prior to Anna's return from the Enchanted Forest, Kristoff tries to get a moody Sven to eat his carrots. Exasperated, he wonders out loud what's wrong with him. Anna then appears at the stable's doorway, having returned from her trip through her temporary control of [[Rumplestiltskin]]'s [[Dark One's Dagger|dagger]], and suggest that the reindeer probably missed her. Overjoyed by her return, Kristoff embraces Anna in a hug, and they share a kiss.

Later, Anna was discussing with Kristoff about her introduction to the Snow Queen, Ingrid, revealed to be her and Elsa's aunt. Though doubtful about Ingrid's family ties, since she isn't found in any of the family portraits or records. Unbeknown to both, the suspicions are correct. After Anna is released from Ingrid's magic spell, where she unexpectedly imprisoned Elsa in the urn while blinded by her anger, the Snow Queen furiously moves to choke her only to be stopped by an intervening Kristoff, armed with his ice pick. Kristoff and Anna can only stand idly by as Ingrid, after being consumed with disgust and remarks how the two are looking at her like a monster, turns the couple into frozen statues as Arendelle itself also ices over.

30 years after being frozen in a state of suspended animation, Kristoff, Anna, and the kingdom of Arendelle finally thawed out as the result of Ingrid casting her Spell of Shattered Sight in [[Storybrooke]]. While they were discussing on rescuing Elsa from Rumplestiltskin, they were confronted by an unfrozen Hans and his brothers, who had just declared Arendelle as his kingdom. Feigning that Anna had dethroned her sister, Hans had the couple arrested for treason, but Kristoff and Anna, after pretending they surrender, managed to fight their way out and escape.

After escaping the castle, Kristoff and Anna decide to go to the pirate [[Blackbeard]] to look for the wishing star. When they get to Blackbeard, they say they will pay for the wishing star in his weight in gold. Hans and his brothers suddenly appear and tell Anna and Kristoff that the whole thing was a setup. Hans then had the two tied up and placed in a large trunk, where he had them toss overboard at the bottom of a spot in the sea called Poseidon's Boneyard, where Anna and Elsa's parent died several years prior. Though the trunk is filling up with water fast, Kristoff managed to free himself and Anna from the binds. Thinking this is the end for them, Anna begins reciting her marriage vows to him. He assures her that they will marry once they escape. With the trunk almost completely filled up with water, they proclaim their love for each other and prepare to meet their fate. Fortunately, through Elsa wishing that she could know what happened to her sister and that she could see her again, the trunk they're in are magically transported to Storybrooke. After reuniting with Elsa, and meeting [[Emma Swan]], the group head to the sheriff's office. Finally, the inhabitants of Storybrooke brace themselves as the curse falls upon the town and begins to take its effect. Although Anna, Elsa, and Emma will be immune to the curse, Kristoff, after trying to resist, looks at Anna one last time before he's affected.

Later, an affected [[The Evil Queen|Regina]], in her Evil Queen attire, arrived at the sheriff's station originally hunting down Emma but finds Kristoff, Anna, Mary Margaret, and David instead. Before she duels with Mary Margaret, Regina teleported Anna and Kristoff to the beachfront. Frustrated, Kristoff gives up on the current situation and attempt to swim back to Arendelle, only to be knocked out by Anna using the bottle that contains her mother's message. The message Anna found would eventually convince Ingrid to end the curse, but at the expense of her own life.

In the mid-season finale, "[[Heroes and Villains (episode)|Heroes and Villains]]", Kristoff, Anna, and Elsa prepare to leave [[Storybrooke]] for [[Arendelle]] and must head back as quickly as possible as Hans, Anna's ex has conquered Arendelle. After [[Rumplestiltskin]]'s defeat by Belle, Kristoff, Elsa and Anna say goodbye and go through the portal to Arendelle, where Elsa continues ruling the kingdom and Kristoff and Anna marry.

Kristoff plays a central role in the book series. In the first installment, ''Journey to the Lights'', he takes Anna and Elsa to the Crystal Ceremony, an annual event held by the trolls in which Grand Pabbie grants crystals to the deserving younger trolls. Kristoff considers this particular ceremony to be fairly special, compared to the others, due to the fact that his close friend, Little Rock, is being honored. Little Rock once saved Kristoff's life—in the past, some of the younger trolls made a sandwich for Kristoff, not knowing the ingredients they used were poisonous to humans. Little Rock was able to identify the hazard and smacked the food away before Kristoff could consume it.

The story also reveals that Kristoff tends to celebrate his mother's birthday by picking flowers and singing songs.

===''[[Conceal, Don't Feel (A Twisted Tale)|A Twisted Tale: Conceal, Don't Feel]]''===
In a world where Elsa's interference resulted in Anna being cursed and her and Elsa's memories of each other being erased, Anna meets Kristoff when she's a teenager living in a remote village with her 'adopted' parents (a baker's couple where the wife was a good friend of Idunna). Although the two only have brief encounters as they grow up, Anna eventually asks for Kristoff's help in getting to Arendelle to find out what caused the freeze as Elsa's powers go out of control on the day of the coronation. During their efforts, Kristoff is told about the curse by the trolls when Anna tries to find Elsa with Hans, and is present when the curse is finally broken as both sisters regain their lost memories.

===Other books===
Kristoff and Anna are the focus of ''Anna Is Our Babysitter'', where Grand Pabbie and the trolls must leave the Valley of the Living Rock for a congress of magic, leaving the infant trolls in the hands of Kristoff and Anna.

In ''[[Frozen Spring Fever]]'', it is learned that Kristoff has had a lingering dream of competing against fellow ice harvesters in the annual "Ice Games", which acts as an Olympic-esque event for ice harvesters, and their families. Unfortunately, only humans can participate, and since Kristoff's only friends were Sven and the trolls, he was repeatedly ineligible to participate. Upon hearing this, however, Anna and Elsa volunteer to join Kristoff's team, to finally bring his dream to fruition.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''===
[[File:Kristoff KHIII.png|left|200px]]
Kristoff makes an appearance in the world of Arendelle, first meeting [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]] when he overhears Sora voicing his excitement over seeing Olaf. Kristoff remains suspicious of them on account of recent occurrences such as the [[Heartless]] (whom he mistakes for hostile wildlife) going around until Anna vouches for them that they can be trusted. When Anna asks Kristoff to take Sven and Olaf elsewhere for the moment, he returns later to reveal that Olaf had fallen to pieces after a Heartless ambush, and Anna asks Sora, Donald, and Goofy to help find them.

They later arrive at Elsa's ice palace, but Sora, Donald, and Goofy remain outside with Sven while Kristoff goes in with Anna and Olaf. Sometime later, Sora is startled when Kristoff, Anna, and Olaf are tossed out of Elsa's palace by Marshmallow, and despite his attempts to stop her from doing so, Kristoff is unable to stop Anna from enraging Marshmallow by throwing a snowball at him. Sora offers to distract him while Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven escape.

After escorting Anna safely back to Arendelle, Kristoff and Sven reunite with Sora, Donald, and Goofy and brings the trio up to speed. They spot a storm brewing on the fjord; Kristoff runs back looking for Anna, only to spot her, slowly freezing, a short distance away. As Kristoff rushes to her aid, he is unable to reach her in time before Anna sacrifices herself to save Elsa from Prince Hans, who summons a Heartless for Sora to fight. When Sora emerges triumphant and slays the Heartless, he finds Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, mourning the loss of Anna as Elsa embraces her little sister and cries her heart out in grief. However, Anna's sacrifice constituted an act of true love, and she is soon restored to flesh and blood. Kristoff joins in the jubilation and with Sven and Olaf, he watches as Elsa ends Arendelle's eternal winter, bringing spring back to the kingdom. In the game's epilogue, Kristoff and Anna are sledding down a mountain that sends them flying off their sled and land safely thanks to an ice slide conjured by Elsa.

===''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]''===
Kristoff appears as a playable character who can summon Sven with his guitar in addition to throwing snowballs and freezing enemies with an ice block.

==[[Frozen (musical)|Musical]]==
[[File:Frozen Musical cast photos - Kristoff.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jelani Alladin as Kristoff in the ''Frozen'' musical.]]
Kristoff's role in the stage version of ''Frozen'' was originated by actor Jelani Alladin. While his character traits and personality have remained faithful to the animated film, some changes have been made for the adaptation. The first of which is Kristoff's family; instead of trolls, the stage version has a group of Scandinavian creatures called the "hidden folk". They are summoned by a distinctive call that very few know, with Kristoff being one of those few.

In the stage version, Kristoff first meets Anna on Coronation Day, after she runs into his ice kart following "[[For the First Time in Forever]]". When Kristoff encounters Anna again in the midst of her journey to find Elsa, he provides her with a mountaineer outfit similar to his own, which she later gives up for her iconic winter gear when they meet Oaken in the second act of the show.

In response to the character's limited amount of singing in the film, Bobby and Kristina Lopez made sure to include Kristoff in a number of new songs for the Broadway play. One of which includes a duet with Anna called "[[What Do You Know About Love?]]". Replacing the wolf chase sequence, the song highlights Kristoff and Anna's differing opinions on the idea of "true love", with Kristoff questioning Anna's intelligence and Hans' legitimacy. During the number, Kristoff and Anna save each other from plummeting off a frozen bridge, which ensures them that they can trust each other. After Anna's heart is frozen by Elsa, Kristoff performs "[[Kristoff Lullaby|Kristoff's Lullaby]]", a solo that acts as a reprise to "What Do You Know About Love?".

==Trivia==
*Ice harvesting is a seasonal occupation that does best during the summer months; men who take up such jobs often have problems finding enough money to live on during their 'off' season. It is implied that Kristoff has no permanent place of residence and is financially challenged. A line from ''Disney on Ice Presents Frozen'', where Kristoff says he comes from "nowhere in particular" suggests this. Additionally, in original drafts, Kristoff only helped Anna out because of the money.
*Norway was the world's largest exporter of ice in the late 19th century. As an industry, it started in 1822, and lasted until 1968, with the golden age being 1850-1914. However, most of the industry was centered on the coast from Risør (which is just north of Arendal) and towards and including present-day Oslo, which was the main export port. Given this, it is unlikely that Kristoff's Sami attire and Sven has a historical basis in the ice harvesting industry.
*Across Europe, there are many stories of Changelings and Fetches - the fairies of local folklore may steal a human child and replace them, sometimes with fairies. A child who was always crying, or a child with red hair, was said to be a sign of the Fey having switched babies. Sometimes it was just a log of enchanted wood that would become 'sick' and die. The stories include that the Fey are particularly attracted to blond hair and beauty, and often treat the stolen child as one of their own. In return, they might give the child (sometimes the Changeling; sometimes the Fetch) gifts such as strength, stamina, or an affinity for the wild. This seems very similar to what happened to Kristoff, though unlike the stories, he wasn't kidnapped or stolen by trolls in the film, but was merely adopted by them.
*Kristoff seems to be based on the Robber Girl from the original story "''The Snow Queen''". In the original story, the Robber Girl owned a reindeer named Bae.
**When the film was in early production, Kristoff and Anna were originally children called Kai and Greta, which can still be seen in early concept art. Eventually, as the story changed they were aged up to adults and renamed Kristoff and Anna. Kristoff himself is based on both Kai and the Robber Girl from the original tale, whereas Anna is based on Gerda and the Summer Witch, whom according to some adaptations of The Snow Queen, is the title Queen's sister.
*According to director/writer [[Jennifer Lee]], Kristoff is 21 years old.<ref name=":1" />
*It should be noted that Kristoff's current design is much like an early design for [[Flynn Rider]] from ''[[Tangled]]'', known as "Bear Flynn" or "[[Bastion]]". That design was bulky, largely built, and that version of Flynn Rider was sweet and charming. Later, Flynn became suave, dashing, and lean, while Kristoff is sweet and introverted but bulkier in his build, but both are of the Loner archetype.
*Both Kristoff's voice actor ([[Jonathan Groff]]) and Elsa's voice actress ([[Idina Menzel]]) have portrayed recurring characters on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] television series ''Glee''. Groff played Jesse St. James, a love interest to the character of Rachel Berry. Menzel played Rachel's mother, and the vocal coach of Jesse's Glee Club, Vocal Adrenaline.
*Although it was not mentioned in the film, Kristoff's last name, Bjorgman, was confirmed in the Essential Guide.<ref name=":0" /> In Scandinavian, "Bjorg" means "help" or "salvation".
*Due to time, a scene featuring Kristoff climbing, using his pickaxe all over the mountain cliffs, was deleted.
*Apparently, Kristoff does not have very good hygiene; in one of his voice-overs for Sven, "Sven" admits Kristoff does not smell better than a reindeer. Also, the trolls mention in the song "Fixer Upper" that "though we know he washes well, he always ends up sort of smelly" and how he "tinkles in the woods" and "has a couple of bugs." He also shares carrots with Sven, allowing Sven to take a bite, then taking a bite himself - when he is seen briefly in Arendelle with Sven, Sven takes the ''whole'' carrot in his mouth, but Kristoff tells him to share. Sven then spits part of the carrot out (now saliva-covered), and Kristoff takes a bite from it.
*According to the book ''Olaf and Sven on Thin Ice'', Kristoff once fell into the frozen lake trying to go get ice when he was younger. After this, the other ice harvesters called him Icicle.
*Kristoff 'dubs' Sven saying "People will beat you and curse you and cheat you; every one of them's bad, except you." Sven seems to agree. This strongly suggests that Kristoff has had some very bad experiences with other humans.
*In the credits of ''Frozen'', there is a disclaimer which states that Kristoff's views are his own views and do not represent the views of the filmmakers or [[The Walt Disney Company]] as inferred from when he asks Anna, "What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?" Anna counters, "Excuse me, sir, he is a ''prince''!" Kristoff's response is "All men do it." The disclaimer reads as follows: "''The views and opinions by Kristoff in the film that all men eat their boogers are solely his own and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Walt Disney Company or the filmmakers. Neither the Walt Disney Company nor the filmmakers make any representation of the accuracy of any such views and opinions.''"
**Kristoff's opinion is likely included to emphasize Prince Hans' role as an antagonist, as well to imply his possibly horrible experiences with other humans before ''Frozen''.
*Kristoff's involvement in the film's opening was used to connect his story and ties with Anna early in the film, as it was her actions (accidentally becoming injured and having to visit the trolls) that led to Kristoff finding a permanent family. This would later reciprocate with Kristoff aiding Anna in her quest to rekindle her bond with Elsa.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://johnaugust.com/2014/scriptnotes-ep-128-frozen-with-jennifer-lee-transcript|title=Scriptnotes, Ep 128: Frozen with Jennifer Lee|date=February 1, 2014|format=Transcript|website=JohnAugust.com|last=August|first=John}}</ref>
*Kristoff dislikes wearing royal attire and can only last one hour maximum in it.<ref>''Frozen II'': The Magical Guide, p. 24</ref>
*Kristoff's actions of proposing to [[Anna]] are similar to that of [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]] from ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' when proposing to [[Miss Bianca]]. Both get interrupted constantly throughout the films trying to propose to their girlfriends and finally succeed towards the films' endings.
*Kristoff has similarities to [[King George III|King George III:]]
**Both are portrayed by Jonathan Groff
**Both are Kings to their nations (Arendelle, United Kingdom)
**Both sing an 80s ballad ("Lost in the Woods", "You'll Be Back")
