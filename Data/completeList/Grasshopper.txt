'''The Grasshopper''' is a character that was originally created for the [[1942]] Disney animated film, ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]'', but deleted during the film's production.

==Development==
Originally, the grasshopper was going to appear in a scene where he was quarreling with [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] and [[Thumper]] and where he was in a predicament with an army of ants. However, because his role seemed foreign, he was cut from the final version of the film along with the ants. Despite this, there was dialogue written for the grasshopper and some rough sketches for the character.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/life/movies/2017/05/13/photos-meet-the-grasshopper-cut-from-bambi/101650840/ Photos: Meet the grasshopper from 'Bambi']</ref>
