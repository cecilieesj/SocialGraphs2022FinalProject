It is the town's main tourist attraction where the local townspeople celebrate an annual bloom once a year in the local town with a big feast; however, it turns out that the festival is actually a trap where the townspeople celebrating the feast are part of the flower.

==Background==

===Personality===
The Drosera occidendum is shown to be a manipulative, carnivorous plant. Although it is known that people celebrate the Festival of the Flower, it is shown that the townspeople are actually part of the flower where the Drosera occidendum reveals its true form after it is found out that there are no visible feet on the townspeople as it is known as the Feast of the Flower. It is able to capture prey in an attempt to eat them whenever they try to escape. As shown during the musical number "[[The Three Caballeros (song)|The Three Caballeros]]", it is sensitive to music.

===Legend===

According to the inscription, it is known that a massive battle left a local town where the flower is at vacant. Whenever it is destroyed, a single flower grows to replace the one that previously withered, just as the city celebrates the triumph over the flower reborn once a year.

==Role in the series==
The Drosera occidendum is introduced in the Season 2 episode, "[[The Town Where Everyone Was Nice!]]".

[[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Launchpad McQuack]], [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] attend the Feast of the Flower (Festa da Flor), which is a tourist spot in the local town occurring once a year, along with Donald's old friends [[José Carioca]] and [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]].

After Webby, Huey, Dewey, and Louie receive robotic responses of "Thank you", "Of course", and "Have a great day" from the citizens regarding about the Feast of the Flower's history and how the festival was celebrates, something weird happens with the nephews; Webby finds out that there are no visible feet on the townspeople according to Louie's phone. After shouting the evidence out loud about the proof that something is going weird in the town, the Drosera occidendum reveals its true form as the townspeople are actually part of the flower.

Just as the flower reveals its true form, Dewey, Louie, and Webby arrive towards the conversation between Donald and Huey about the Festival of Flower which is actually the Feast of the Flower as the legend shown on the fountain comes true, Webby devises a plan before they become eaten by the carnivorous plant. Donald then plans to get help from José and Panchito to rescue the nephews and Scrooge McDuck from being eaten. José and Panchito, however, confront Donald for his betrayal about his lies to the group. To help fix the problem about this, Panchito, José, and Donald perform a musical number to help save Scrooge, Webby, and the nephews from being eaten by the carnivorous plant, where they sing the musical number "The Three Caballeros".

During the musical number "[[The Three Caballeros (song)|The Three Caballeros]]", the group ends up fighting the Drosera occidendum to save Scrooge, Webby, and the nephews and as they continue singing, the plant ends up getting uncomfortable with Donald's terrible singing. Just as Donald continues singing, along with José and Panchito, the Drosera occidendum ultimately withers from all the large singing. After the musical number, the Three Caballeros hear two tourists applauding them.

Just as the McDuck family leaves via plane, a remain of the Drosera occidendum grows a new seed afterwards, causing the flower to regrow after defeat.

==Trivia==
*Its name is derived from Drosera, the genus for the carnivorous sundew plant, and "occidendum", the Latin word for "murder", both of which allude to the plant's sinister nature.
*Two of the townspeople part of the Drosera occidendum (coffee vendor and waitress) are voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]] respectively.
