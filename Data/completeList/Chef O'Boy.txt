'''Chef O'Boy''' is a character from ''[[The Proud Family]]'' episode; "[[I Love You Penny Proud]]".

==Role in the episode==
Chef O'Boy is first seen preparing for [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] and [[Trudy Proud]]'s Valentine at their home since he was hired by Trudy. At first, Oscar mistakes him for Trudy when trying to offer her some Valentine's gifts until Oscar notices and gets scared at the very sight of him. After Trudy tells Oscar about their dinner plan, O'Boy proceeds to cook their dinner.

At night, after [[Penny Proud|Penny]] and her friends get caught trying to catch the [[Johnny McBride|one]] responsible for spraying Penny's name and face on buses at the bus station, which also got her and her friends falsely suspended for the same thing on the school's wall the other day in the first place, O'Boy can be seen watching [[Suga Mama]] and [[Papi Boulevardez|Papi]] eating the dinner instead. When Papi starts insulting Suga Mama in Spanish, he and O'Boy start laughing, revealing that O'Boy speaks Spanish as well. When Oscar refuses to pay, O'Boy calls for his hulking, monstrous assistant, Hans to persuade him otherwise. Instead, Oscar has Trudy pay for the dinner and O'Boy bids them "''Auf Wiedersehen''" and leaves. He isn't seen throughout the rest of the episode after this.
