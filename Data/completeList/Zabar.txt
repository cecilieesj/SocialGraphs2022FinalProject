|quote = }}'''Zabar''' is a dinosaur nature healer who appears in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "Germ Warfare". He is legendary, known to dinosaurs as "the Guy in the Woods."

After [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] and [[Frances Sinclair|Fran Sinclair]] lose faith in the medical establishment, due to [[Dr. Ficus|Dr. Ficus']] placid indifference to the blue medicine's failure to cure [[Baby Sinclair|Baby]] of his sickness, they travel to the ritual healing grounds at the advice of [[Ethyl Phillips]] to seek Zabar's help.

Zabar ultimately manages to cure Baby by feeding him moldy bread, saving the child's life.
