'''Mr. Carrot''' is the name of one of the characters from the [[2008]] hit animated feature ''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]''. He is [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]]’s rubber chew toy, an orange carrot with a simple smiley face.

==Background==
This character is first seen at the [[Silver Lake Animal Rescue|Animal Rescue Center]] in the beginning of the movie. It can be assumed that Bolt was given the toy to play with while he was taken care of at the center and he quickly grew attached to it.

Mr. Carrot does not develop much in the movie and shows no particular characteristics as his role in the movie was not as central as other characters; however, it may have something to do with him being a squeaky toy.

Mr. Carrot is [[Bolt (character)|Bolt’s]] favorite toy and has been from early puppy-hood onward, making him one of the hero’s more intimate childhood friends. Mr. Carrot also holds a distinguished emotional value for [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]]—reminding him of times he has shared with [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]]. At the conclusion of the film, [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] is still seen playing with Mr. Carrot after settling down in [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny's]] house after his great adventure.

==Critical Reception==
Mr. Carrot was generally well met by critics—cited as both a funny and deep character. Some critics have criticized the carrot's notable lack of dialogue throughout the film, however, general consensus favors the silent depth of his character over the obtrusive and poorly written [[Rhino]].

==Trivia==
*[[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]] is the only character to call Mr. Carrot by his name.
