==Background==
The Fiery Dragon, as its name implies, is a dragon-like creature made of fire that emerges from the fireplace when [[Ramsley]] furiously berates the Evers family and [[Master Gracey]] after [[Jim Evers]] discovered that Ramsley has been lying the whole time. After Ramsley's true colors are revealed, the fire starts emerging from the fireplace, causing a dragon-like creature made of fire to appear and send Ramsey to his demise only for Ramsley to grab Jim; however, Gracey manages to rescue Jim from falling to his demise with Ramsley finally defeated.

==Role in the film==
The Fiery Dragon appears at the end of the film where it comes to take [[Ramsley]] to Hell after the truth of his murder of [[Elizabeth Henshaw|Elizabeth]], his treachery against his [[Master Gracey|master]] and his blackmailing the other residents of the Mansion was revealed. The Fiery Dragon emerges from the fireplace, driving away all the [[Wraiths]] that Ramsley summoned in the process, then wraps its fiery tongue around the butler and drags him to hell, as punishment for all eternity for his evil actions. Ramsley tried to drag [[Jim Evers]] with him, but Gracey saved Jim just before that happens.

==Trivia==
*One of the few characters in Disney history to have its home literally be Hell.
*According to the audio commentary on the ''Haunted Mansion'' DVD releases, the scene with the Fiery Dragon was one of the most challenging scenes ever made and the fire used in the scene was actually a mix between real fire and CGI fire done at visual effects company {{WikipediaLink|Sony Pictures Imageworks|Imageworks}}. Additionally, the set was actually filmed with no real fire used on set but rather filmed with motion control photography.<ref>''Haunted Mansion'' Audio Commentaries (Widescreen DVD, 2003).</ref>
