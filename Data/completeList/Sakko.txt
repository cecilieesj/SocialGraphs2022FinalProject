He was originally presumed to be </span>Jinmay<span style="line-height:21px;">'s pet in the first episode, but he pins her down and opens up her chest, revealing that she is a robot. He fails Skeleton King and is taken away by a strange jack in the box looking robot with legs, but he appears in later episodes and with an eyepatch. He makes a brief cameo in the final episode with Krinkle, drawing a picture of the Skeleton King holding him. Sakko seems to be a Marmoset. He talks with a Russian accent. He seems to be nearly a friend, or an acquaintance to [[Mandarin]], and he appears to like him. He is voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. He is sometimes seen with Mandarin. </span>

==Trivia==
*Some viewers believe that the Alchemist created him and that he was a monkey prototype. This hasn't been confirmed.
