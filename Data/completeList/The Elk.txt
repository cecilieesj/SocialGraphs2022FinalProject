==Background==
The Elk is kind and caring, which is shown when he first awakens the [[Spring Sprite]] and is shown later when he sees her sad about [[the Firebird]] razing the forest. He is seen to be perceptive, seeing as how he always seems to know where to find the Sprite. He also show his loyalty and fondness for her, as seen when he stays by her in her time of need. As she restores life to the forest with rain, he shows signs of happiness, both for her renewed spirit and the forest's renewal.

==Role in the film==
The Elk first appears when he enters a pool to reawaken the Spring Sprite so she can start spring. Later that day, he witnesses the ravaging fury of the Firebird, though he survives the destruction. In the aftermath of the Firebird's wrath, he finds the Sprite dispirited but is able to convince her to restore life to the forest. As a result, she creates rain, restoring life to the forest and allowing the Elk to live peacefully.

==Trivia==
* It is possible that the Elk is actually a god in animal form, though it is never truly confirmed.
