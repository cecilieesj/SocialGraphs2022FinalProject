'''Summer''' is a character in ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'', whom the Dalmatians meet while on holiday in Cornwall in the two-part special "[[A Summer to Remember]]".

== Appearance ==
She is a teenage border collie. Most of her fur is grey, but she has white legs and a black pattern on her head. She also has light-blue scleras.

== Personality ==
She is friendly, social, brave and intelligent. She also has easy humor, laughing at every blunder Dylan or spanking a sarcastic remark when he knows lost calling him <nowiki>''city boy''</nowiki>.

Initially, Summer had a bad opinion of Dylan because of his derogatory remarks about the locals, that she found offensive and insulting. Summer was also annoyed at the mere sight of [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]] and [[Spike (101 Dalmatian Street)|Spike]]'s crush.

Although their bad start, She seems to have a crush on [[Dylan]] later, when Dylan apologized for making a mistake on the locals. She even smiled after Dylan just touched her nose because he was too embarrassed to exchange a kiss.

== Background ==
Summer is first seen observing the arrival of the Dalmatians in Cornwall.

As it begins to rain, Summer comes to take shelter in the Dalamtian bus while seeing with amusement Dylan hanging on his tent and blown away by the wind. Confusing this with a game, she asks Dolly what<nowiki>'s its name and the Dalmatian responds '' Born that way ''</nowiki>.

When the rain is over, Summer comes to see Dylan looking at a map. The border collie turns out to know a lot about constellations just comparing the patterns on Dylan's ear with Canis Major, which amazes Dylan because he didn<nowiki>'t believe that someone ''so far from civilization'' could know so much, which upsets Summer. Dylan tries to catch up but only makes matters worse by saying that there isn'</nowiki>t much to see in the sticks. Still a little upset, Summer then remarks that Dylan has a wasp on his nose, causing the Dalmatian to panic and just fun for the border collie. Dylan then collides with Bessy the Cow and releases another demeaning reflections on the locals, again to Summer 's indignation.

She later finds the Dalmatians gone in the wrong direction for the beach and warns them of their mistake but Dylan does as he pleases and then stumbles on the trail and brambles. Seeing her brother in chains fall after fall, Dolly prefers to follow Summer.

Summer successfully drives the Dalmatians to the beach, and along with Dolly, taunts a bramble and vines covered Dylan who came last. Right after Spike's intro, Dylan saves Dorothy from Chips the Seagull and complains about the locals again in front of Summer, upsetting her yet again. When Dylan and Dante set off to find Dizzy and Dee Dee who have entered a dark cave, Summer offers her local knowledge to help them. The trio eventually find the two pups and save them in-extreme from a landslide. After getting out of the cave, Summer receives an apology from Dylan who finally realizes that all the locals are not bad news. Dylan then introduces himself to her and vice versa as they hadn't done during their first meeting, starting the beginning of a crush between them.

As night falls, Dylan and Summer stargaze and almost share a romantic moment, only for [[Chips (101 Dalmatian Street)|Chips]] to vomit on Dylan's paw, causing him to start his criticism of the locals again, which infuriates Summer. After the Dalmatians' bus tumbles down the hill and begins to tip over the cliff, Summer helps Dolly, Dylan and Spike balance it out until Doug and Deliah throw themselves out of the vehicle to lighten it and end up getting stuck on a mini island. As a storm rolls in, Summer and Dylan see Dolly and Spike's rescue attempt fail, leaving four dogs to save. Summer comes up with the idea of ​​using the tent like Dylan accidentally did earlier and a rope attached to the lighthouse so Chips can bring it to the island so the tent can reach the dogs.

At the top of the lighthouse, Summer calls the seagull and Dylan begins to doubt the bird that previously tried to kidnap Dorothy but Summer corrects him as Chips actually wanted to save Dorothy from a wave. The plan is derailed with the wind blowing too hard to make the transition and with Chips too light, Summer wants to go but Dylan bravely takes her place. Despite the rope cutting while the dogs are in the sky, Dylan manages to get them back to the lighthouse before crashing into the glass, amusing Summer who says "My hero".

The next day, the Dalmatians are about to fly back to London so Summer comes to say goodbye. Dylan admits he was wrong about the premises, to which Summer agrees before she closes her eyes waiting for Dylan to kiss her but the overly shy Dalmatian awkwardly pats the border collie's nose then to slip away, leaving Summer smiling happily.
