'''Torra Doza''' is a character who appears in the animated series, ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]''. She is part of a group of ace pilots who fight to protect the refueling depot on the [[Colossus (ship)|Colossus]], and when there are no threats attacking the base, she a professional racer.

==Background==
A daring pilot at the Colossus station with a sense of flair and competitiveness, Torra Doza has the combined energy of a hotshot Ace and a fifteen-year old. She is the daughter of the station operator, Captain [[Imanuel Doza]] and Resistance pilot Venisa Doza, and lives in the stationâ€™s upper levels.

Torra Doza has a sense of childlike wonder, who loves her friends and family dearly. However, once behind the controls of a ship she is quite a competitive force. Due to her father being a little protective of her, Torra hardly had any friends, but finds a true friend in [[Kazuda Xiono|Kaz]].

==Trivia==
*Torra's ship, the Blue Ace, strongly resemblances a Porsche 917 prototype race car.
*Torra can be seen flying the Blue Ace during the battle of [[Exegol]] in ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]''. Yeager (flying his racer) and Kaz (flying the Fireball) are also present, although the three pilots are not clearly shown.
*Torra could have been a love interest with Kaz.
