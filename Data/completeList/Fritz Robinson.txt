==Role in the film==

Fritz Robinson is the uncle of [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]], brother of [[Bud Robinson|Bud]] and Joe, brother-in-law of [[Billie Robinson|Billie]] and [[Lucille Krunklehorn|Lucille]]. He is married to [[Petunia Robinson|Petunia]] and is the father of [[Tallulah Robinson|Tallulah]] and [[Laszlo Robinson|Laszlo]]. He is dominated by his wife and is very nervous around her and tries that his children don't bother her.
==Trivia==

*He and his wife are the only married couple in the Robinson family who are always getting into funny arguments.
*His wife is a hand puppet, controlled by him, though his children are real. It's implied that Fritz thinks Petunia is real, and everyone else in the family either think the same thing, or are pretending to for Fritz's sake.
*It is never explained how he had kids or started a relationship with Petunia.
**It is possible she's either divorced or deceased. Or Fritz developed a split personality modeled after his wife. Though given how advanced the future is, it is possible her mind shares her husband's body and the puppet is the only way she can communicate.
