Maggie was a nun in her youth until she met Jack Murdock at a boxing ring and fell in love with him. After giving birth to [[Daredevil|Matt]], she began to suffer from postpartum depression and believing she had turned away from God, returned to the church, leaving Jack and Matt behind. Years later, she aids a gravely injured Matt after the events of The Defenders, giving him harsh, but supportive words during the events of the season. When Matt learns that Maggie is his mother, he turns her and Father Lantom away for lying to him all these years. Later, when [[Karen Page|Karen]] makes herself a target of [[Kingpin|Wilson Fisk]], Sister Maggie and Father Lantom agree to shelter her in the church's basement. Fisk sends [[Bullseye (Marvel)|Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter]] to the church to kill Karen as revenge for James Wesley's death and Father Lantom is killed in Matt and Karen's efforts to fight Dex off. When she finally gets into the church, Maggie prays fervently for Matt and Karen's protection and even misleads the FBI from finding them. She also gives Dex's colleague Ray Nadeem some words of wisdom that lead to Nadeem turning against Fisk. At Father Lantom's funeral in the season finale, Matt forgives Maggie for abandoning him.
