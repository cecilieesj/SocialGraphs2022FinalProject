'''Yachi''' is a character in the [[Disney+]] Original series ''[[Baymax!]].'' She is a stray tabby cat who has roamed the independent streets of [[San Fransokyo]] and now trusts [[Baymax]] and [[Kiko Tanaka]] as their new caretaker allies.

== Background ==

=== Personality ===
Despite being a feisty and scrawny cat, Yachi is not hesitant to refuse to defend herself when situations get out of hand for her in her solitary being. She is often seen as an afraid and hysterical cat. However, she actually just wants to be loved; she never felt much of being loved in her life. And perhaps not needing anyone, she still wants to have connection to close encounters in her life - she has her still-humorous moments here and there, so what she really wants to feel is happiness and heart.
{{Quote|Whenever Yachi opens her mouth, the earbud emits excerpts from the local news or snippets of songs and advertisements, sending the cat into even greater panic. Baymax, determined to massage the feline’s throat to eject the intrusion, just makes her anxiety and fear worse. She’s a cat. She doesn’t know he’s trying to help.|Cirocco Dunlap<ref>https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/documents/baymax_production_brief_final_06-27-22_fcb25aa9.pdf</ref>}}

=== Physical appearance ===
Yachi is a alley, stray, and street cat with orange fur. She has a white muzzle, paws, tip of tail, ear insides, and eye mask. She also has olive-green eyes with black colored circle shaped eyes, a long thin tail, messy whiskers on the sides of her muzzle, and two large ears with the left one having a tiny notch, giving the fact she is a stray.

=== Abilities ===

* '''Ultrasonic Meow''' - Yachi has a very loud meow that can be heard from miles away. She has used this meow mainly to alert people about her surroundings and to warn them that they should back off. She has most notably used this meow when she alarmed the construction workers about not closing the construction house because [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro]], [[Sofia (Baymax!)|Sofia]], [[Mbita]], and [[Kiko Tanaka|Kiko]] are inside the pothole to help plug Baymax back to life.

==Trivia ==
*Her name means “Eight Thousand” in Japanese.
*The trailer subtitles listed the character as "Boss Cat" due to her reckless nature.
*Despite making her official debut in the ''Baymax!'' episode "[[Yachi (episode)|Yachi]]", she has previously made cameos in the ''Baymax!'' episodes "[[Cass]]" and "[[Mbita (episode)|Mbita]]". In "Cass", she made a cameo at the end of the episode when she stared at the [[Lucky Cat Café|Lucky Cat Cafe]] for a couple of seconds and then scampered away shortly after. Then in "Mbita", she made a cameo at the very beginning of the episode where she could be seeing stealing a bony fish from a trash can, then hops off.
*She is skilled at stealing food from other people. An obvious attempt at this was when she emitted loud music on a man’s EarPods to distract him and get sushi from him. A more famous attempt is when she snatches a red lollipop from an unplugged Baymax’s hand.
*Baymax reuses the line “Hairy baby….hairy baby” while petting her to relax her from the falling shelf. This line was originally used when Baymax was petting [[Mochi]] in ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.
