'''Ada''' is a character in ''[[Tron: Uprising]]''. She is a female [[ISO]], and a friend of [[Quorra]].

==Biography==
Following the Purge, a few ISOs managed to escape their genocide and survived as fugitives. Ada and Quorra had been on the run for some time when Ada was critically injured and rendered unconscious. A group of other programs had surrounded the pair when [[Paige]] chanced upon the scene and helped the ISOs escape. Paige nursed Ada back to health, but her friends betrayed the fugitives, forcing Ada and Quorra to flee once more.

It is unknown what Happen to Ada, as she wasn't seen with Quorra later.

==Trivia==
*Ada speaks with a light accent, similar to an Australian one; to date, this accent has been heard only from her. 
*It is likely that her name was taken from Ada Lovelace, whom some consider the first computer programmer. 
*In "[[ElecTRONica]]", a program named Ada stood in for Eckert on one occasion. However, she resembled Eckert and did not appear related to Quorra's friend.
