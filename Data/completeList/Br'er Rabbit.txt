==Appearances==
===''[[Song of the South]]''===
In the film, [[Uncle Remus]] tell three tales of Br'er Rabbit and his foes, [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Bear]]. He lives out most of his roles in these fables.

In the first story, Br'er Rabbit leaves his [[Briar Patch|briar patch]] since it is giving him too much trouble. However, he then gets caught in Br'er Fox's trap, but manages to escape by tricking Br'er Bear into switching places by convincing him that it was a job that paid a "dollar a minute". He then escapes back to his briar patch as Br'er Bear and Br'er Fox fight, learning that he can't simply run away from trouble, for there is no place too far from it.

In the second story, Br'er Rabbit travels the trail, greeting everyone along the way. But then he becomes offended when he gets no response from the [[Tar Baby]], which is another trap concocted by Br'er Fox. Br'er Rabbit punches it and gets stuck inside, but eventually escapes by tricking Br'er Fox into throwing him into a briar patch, saying it was more painful than what Br'er Fox had planned for him. He survives and escapes, as the briar patch is where "he was born and bred". This experience taught him not to bother in affairs that aren't his own.

In the third and last story, Br'er Rabbit is captured by Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear and nearly eaten until he tricks them into taking him to his "Laughing Place", where they are attacked by [[The Bees (Song of the South)|bees]] and he laughs at them.

At the end of the film, Br'er Rabbit miraculously appears in the real world (much to Uncle Remus' shock and amazement) and interacts with the children and singing "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" with them, along with other characters from Uncle Remus' stories, including [[Br'er Frog]].

===''[[The Mouse Factory]]''===
Br'er Rabbit made recurring appearances in the live-action wrap-around skits alongside the other costumed characters and celebrity guests.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Br'er Rabbit makes numerous cameo appearances in the animated series ''House of Mouse''.

His most notable cameo is in the first episode "[[The Stolen Cartoons]]", where [[Mickey Mouse]] reminds everyone of the House of Mouse rules. As one of the rules, Mickey says "No villainous schemes", at which point Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear stop themselves from catching Br'er Rabbit.

He is also seen during ''[[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|The Ludwig Von Drake song]]'' in "[[Ask Von Drake]]".

He also appears briefly in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.

==Video Game Appearances==
===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===

Br'er Rabbit appears in this game as an unlockable meet-and-greet character outside the entrance to [[Splash Mountain]] in [[Critter Country]], after the player helps Br'er Fox lure him out of hiding.

Br'er Rabbit also serves as the player's guide in the ''Splash Mountain'' mini-game. Br'er Rabbit and the player pay a visit to Br'er Fox's house, where Br'er Rabbit tricks his foes into believing that he tripped and fell down and is now helpless in front of their door. Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear rush out only to find a "present". Ignoring Br'er Fox's warnings that it's most likely one of the rabbit's tricks, Br'er Bear eagerly opens it to discover a beehive, although he doesn't realize it's a hive until the bees come out and attack. Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear then start chasing after Br'er Rabbit and the player, but they are ultimately foiled.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==

Br'er Rabbit, along with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear, was a popular character in the Disney Parks around the world. They were the only characters from the film to still be used in later appearances.

In 2020 when racial tensions reached an all time high, he, along with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear were retired from the character line-up. All ''Song of the South'' elements in the parks were quietly removed, with the statue of Br'er Rabbit at the [[Magic Kingdom]] seeing removal from the Hub in front of [[Cinderella Castle]] in mid-2021. 

===Splash Mountain===
Br'er Rabbit stars in this popular attraction. It features a 50 foot drop as its climax and dozens of animatronics of characters from the film, most notably him.

At the start of the ride, he is shown leaving his briar patch in search of his "Laughing Place". He then tricks Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear into going into it and laughs at them as the bees sting them. Suddenly, Br'er Fox captures him in a beehive and prepares to eat him, but he begs Br'er Fox not to throw him into a briar patch, prompting Br'er Fox to do exactly that (which is represented by the climactic drop) and enable him to escape. Lastly, he is seen relaxing in the briar patch as the other animals celebrate his return home.

===[[Mickey Mouse Revue]]===
In this original Magic Kingdom attraction that was subsequently moved to Tokyo Disneyland, Br'er Rabbit appeared with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear to sing "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" near the end of the show.
