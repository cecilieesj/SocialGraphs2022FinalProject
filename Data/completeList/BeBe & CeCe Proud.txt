'''Benjamin "BeBe" & Cecilia "CeCe" Proud''' are [[Penny Proud|Penny]]'s troublemaking one-year-old twin siblings.

==Background==
BeBe is a boy with an Afro hairstyle and has a bottle in his mouth, while CeCe is a girl with brown hair and a pink dress with diapers. They are named after the gospel music brother and sister duo {{WikipediaLink|BeBe & CeCe Winans}}. BeBe is the older twin. They love Penny very much, but at points play too roughly with her. They are often seen playing with [[Puff]], and most of the time, Puff ends up getting injured. Even though the film takes two years after the series, they remain infants and don't seem to have aged. [[Al Roker]] once turned them into teenagers, which made them ruin Penny's life; since everyone paid attention to them and ignored her (along with Penny's room being redecorated against her will solely for Cece without concern for her).

=== ''Proud Family: Louder and Prouder'' ===
The two of them are aged into 2-year-old toddlers from babies for the show; but haven't been potty trained yet. CeCe now has a full head of hair like Trudy's but in Sugar Mama's style. She also wears a pink ballerina dress, a matching headband with a rose and white stockings. BeBe now wears purple pants with the zipper open, along with one sock on his right foot.

==Trivia==
* They are named after gospel singer siblings {{WPS|BeBe & CeCe Winans|BeBe and CeCe Winans}}. Much like their namesakes, ''Louder and Prouder'' revealed that their full names are Benjamin and Cecilia.
