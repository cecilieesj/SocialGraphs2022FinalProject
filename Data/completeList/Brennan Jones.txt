A fugitive on the run, Brennan escapes on a ship with his two sons. When his youngest son [[Captain Hook|Killian]] gets scared by the storm, he comforts him and tells him there's nothing to be scared of and tells him to go to sleep. While his sons are asleep, Brennan trades his children into servitude for a rowboat so that he can escape from the authorities, leaving the two brothers alone.

Not long after Brennan leaves, he is caught and put under a sleeping curse. He is awoken by true loves kiss from his nurse. She makes Brennan see the error of his ways and the pair get married together and have a son, whom he calls Liam, after his [[Liam Jones|first born]] and in honor of the children he believed were dead. A few years after Brennan and his wife get married, she falls ill and dies.

After almost a century has passed since he abandoned his sons, Brennan is reunited with Killian, now known as Captain Hook. Killian explains to him that [[The Evil Queen]] had sent him to kill Brennan in order to pass a test set by her, but can't go through with it. Killian allows Brennan to escape so that the Queen believes he is truly dead.

While Brennan comforts his youngest son and tells him to go to sleep, Killian arrives with the transportation letters that will allow Brennan and his youngest son passage. Killian is however angered that Brennan named his child after his dead brother seeing him as an attempt to replace him. Brennan tells him he named him in honor of his first two children in order to never make the same mistake he did with Liam and Killian when they were boys.

Not wanting to risk being unable to obtain his revenge, Killian stabs Brennan. Shortly before his demise, Brennan's tells Killian that it's never to late to change and he can be a better man.
