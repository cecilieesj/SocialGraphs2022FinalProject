[[File:Swampmonster.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''The Predator''' is a large monster with horns and fangs who frequently appeared as the secondary antagonistÂ of ''[[Dinosaurs]]''.

The creature first appeared in the second season episode "[[I Never Ate for My Father]]", where it was referred to as a swamp monster and consumed [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] and [[Robbie Sinclair|Robbie]]. The swamp monster is a hand puppet, matted to look like a giant creature. Every swamp monster seen on ''Dinosaurs'' looks identical. It takes a few days for the monster to digest his meals.

In its second appearance, in "[[Slave to Fashion]]," the puppet was used as the title character for the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Dinosaur_TV TV series] ''Totally Hidden Predator''. This was the first reference to it as "The Predator" and no other official name is known. The monster would continue to be seen both on television and encountering the Sinclairs in the wild.

This puppet originally appeared in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Maker Monster Maker]''. A photo caption in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/No_Strings_Attached No Strings Attached]'' refers to this creature as a demon.
