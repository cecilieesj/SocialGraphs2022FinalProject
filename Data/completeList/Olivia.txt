==Role in the series==
Olivia and Mateo first met during a get together at the castle in "[[Wizard-in-Training]]". While her parents spoke with [[Princess Elena]] about fixing a dried up well, Mateo gave Olivia a personal tour of his workshop and tells her a little bit about being a wizard. At the same time Mateo decides to make Olivia his apprentice, much to her delight. Despite Elena's concerns, Mateo was certain he could handle teaching.

Olivia's first day of apprenticeship, was learning basic alchemy. She does well with the first part with Mateo showing her, but when he leaves her with directions for the second part she decided to take some notes in her book instead of doing the alchemy. Once she tries to finish the alchemy it ends up turning into purple smoke. Olivia decided to help Mateo clean up his workshop, and while he left with Elena, She got called upon Lucas to help get their cat out of a tree. Going against Mateo's orders, Olivia took one of his tamboritas and went to help out.

Forgetting her spell book, she used one spell she remembered to get their cat down. After the family saw what she did they decided to let her help them out with the dry well. Olivia tried to get more water from the well, but instead created a huge water spirit. Working with Mateo, both Master and Apprentice chased down the Water spirit and together they froze the spirit which became snow. 

Olivia next appears in "[[Movin' On Up]]." During their magic lesson, Mateo shows her the Creature Compendium which [[Alacazar]] imprisoned many magical creatures in. Olivia is fascinated by the Kupi-Kupi, until Mateo tells her what he's capable of. Mateo then teaches Olivia how trap things in the Compendium. Olivia hopes she'll get to trap an evil monster, but Mateo says she's not ready for that yet. Instead, he gives her a vase to practice on and she casts the spell perfectly on the first try. However, the lesson is soon interrupted by [[Rafa (Elena of Avalor)|Rafa]] who offers them a snack, much to Olivia's delight. After Elena takes Rafa out of the workshop, Olivia tells Mateo that his mom is right about him getting cranky when he's hungry.
