The '''Umbrella Vultures''' are characters featured in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1951]] animated feature film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. They are one of the creatures encountered in [[Tulgey Wood]].

==Background==
The Umbrella Vultures are vulture-like creatures with black umbrellas in the shape of their bodies which live in [[Tulgey Wood]] as their names imply. They are usually seen peacefully bathing in a pond with no one interrupting them. However, whenever [[Alice]] asks them to help her find a way back home, they become furious with her for disturbing their bath. This can imply that they dislike anyone who interrupts their moment when they are washing and cleaning themselves. In spite of that, one of them felt remorseful to Alice during the "[[Very Good Advice]]" along with the other creatures of Tulgey Wood.

==Role in the film==
When [[Alice]] wanders around [[Tulgey Wood]], she encounters a group of Umbrella Vultures happily playing in a pond with a waterfall above them just as she curiously hears them squawking in their pond. When Alice asks them for directions, they make a frightened reaction in shock just as they scatter and fly toward a branch where they make an angry expression for interrupting their bathing routine. Alice asks them, "Nevermind", telling them to continue their routine. Later during the "[[Very Good Advice]]" sequence, three Umbrella Vultures land on a branch and angrily stare at Alice who is singing about her fear of not being able to return home. As Alice cries, the three of them sadly react to Alice who cries. Another Umbrella Vulture also cries as well alongside a [[Glasses Bird]] and two [[Hammer and Pencil Birds|Hammer Birds]] just before they slowly fade away along with the other Tulgey Wood creatures. They make no further appearances after that.

===[[Alice in Wonderland]]===
An Umbrella Vulture is one of the last creatures from Tulgey Wood encountered in the [[Disneyland]] attraction. It is encountered after the guests pass through two Hammer Birds placing two signs spelling "Watch out" respectively.

==Trivia==
*During the scene where Alice asks the Umbrella Vultures for directions, there were originally five of them bathing in a pond. However, during the part where they land on a branch to show an angry expression to Alice, there were only four Umbrella Vultures. This is likely an animation error oversight.
