Harold Proctor lives in [[Westview]], married to [[Sarah Proctor]], with a daughter. In [[2023]], a short period, after the [[Avengers: Endgame|Blip occurred]], Harold Proctor hangs a poster up, advertising piano lessons, as [[Scarlet Witch|Wand Maximoff]], drive into Westview. A few moments later, Harold becomes entrapped in the town, as everything in the borders, is transformed, into a black and white, 1950s sitcom. He is assigned the new identity of Phil Jones. Under this new persona, Phil is aware of everything that happens, but has no control. He feels Wanda's pain, and when he goes to sleep, suffers from her nightmares. In this new life, he is still married to his wife, who has now been assigned the identity, of "Dottie Jones".

After Phil was hired by [[Todd Davis|Mr. Hart]] of Computational Services, Inc., he participated in an employee rite of passage, in inviting Mr. Hart and [[Sharon Davis|his wife]] to an evening dinner at his home. His wife was organised a five-course meal, with a stringed quartet, but Mr. Hart was unimpressed, and found his turtleneck, an embarrassing display of "beatnik enthusiasm". Following this, he was let go by Mr. Hart, and was forced to clear his desk.

Phil participates in a neighborhood watch, with other the men from the neighborhood, and the group regularly meet in Westview Public Library, though they mainly participate in gossip. One day, while the group are discussing a fellow neighbors garden, [[Vision]] walks in. He inquires about various security questions, but they reveal that the nature of the group is more of a social setting, and Phil takes out a round of Danishes for them to eat. He offers some to Vision, who refuses, on the basis, that he doesn't eat, between meals. The group continue, to gossip, and in an attempt to participate, Vision claims [[Abilash Tandon|Norm]] is a communist, to the delight of Phil and everyone, who find his joke amusing. When Herb offers Vision a piece of gum, Norm reminds them that Vision doesn't eat between meals, and Phil questions whether gum is considered food. After Vision accepts, they carry on with their conversation. Later that day, a fundraiser talent show for Westview Elementary is being held. He provides his grandmother's piano for the talent show, first playing it, during the performance of two tap dancers, before returning to his wife, Dottie, in the audience, and granting the piano for Wanda and Vision's magic act. When Vision displays his staggering strength by holding the piano with one hand, Wanda takes it from him, and carries it across the stage, before accidentally revealing it to be a cardboard cutout, leaving Phil confused, about what happened to his grandmother's piano. Phil watches as the pair continue with their magical acts, and in the climax, they make [[Monica Rambeau|Geraldine]] magically appear, in Vision's Cabinet of Mysteries, leading to an applause from Phil and the other members of the audience. When Dottie announces them as winners of the best comedic act, Phil can be seen cheering them on, and he, alongside everyone else, gives a standing ovation.

During the opening sequence of the [[Now in Color|third episode]], which takes place in the 1970s, Phil can be seen leaving the library with Vision and Herb. At home, Phil is reading the newspaper, when his wife enters the room, and asks him, if her earrings make her look fat. Before he can answer, the electricity goes out, and Phil thanks God.

While Phil is out in town, Wanda appears, and suddenly, the true personas of the towns residents are restored. Phil reverts backs to her true identity, of Harold, and approaches Wanda, alongside several other people. Wanda tries to assure the group that she is protecting them, but they all simultaneously beg her, to free them. She screams at them to stop, releasing a burst of red magic, and placing them all in a choke. Harold falls to the ground, unable to breathe, alongside everyone else, and Wanda quickly undoes this. Wanda promises that she will let them go, and begins lowering the Hex, surrounding Westview. Harold runs away, but the barrier is quickly brought back, before he has the chance to leave. A battle ensues in the sky, between Wanda, and [[Agatha Harkness]], and once it's over, the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Before Wanda leaves, she makes her way in town to speak to Monica Rambeau, and Harold can be seen, amongst the various other townspeople, angrily staring at her, for the suffering she caused.
