'''Snowball''' is [[Claude Frollo]]'s horse in Disney's [[1996]] animated feature film, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. He is mostly seen to mirror [[Phoebus]]' horse, [[Achilles]].

==Background==
Very little is known about Snowball, except that he appears to be a breed of draft horse, built as muscular, and hulking. He is loyal to his master, however, and can't be considered truly evil as he does not have a human-based personality like other animals in Disney films are sometimes seen to have, although he does always appear to have an angry snarl on his face, hinting that he does have some sort of dark personality.

In the audio commentary of the DVD, film directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]] and film producer [[Don Hahn]] revealed the name of Frollo's horse to be Snowball.

==Role in the film==
Snowball appears only a handful of times in the film. During the opening scene, he is with Claude Frollo chasing after the [[Quasimodo's mother|gypsy woman]] who is holding baby [[Quasimodo]]. In one scene, he gives a harsh glare to [[Phoebus]]' horse, [[Achilles]]. When Phoebus rebels against Frollo at the windmill, Esmeralda throws a stone at Snowball's butt thrusting Frollo off, then Phoebus steals Snowball in order to escape. He is immediately recovered by Frollo after Phoebus is wounded and thrown off the horse.

It is not known what happened to him after his master's death.

==Trivia==
*His name is slightly ironic, as he is a black sable horse, whereas snowballs are usually white.
*He is a Friesian horse.
*In ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', [[Gaston]] rallies the mob while riding a horse which bears a striking resemblance to Snowball.
