He is a small, light gray desk lamp (although he has sometimes looked more of a white than light gray lamp) who loves to play with [[Pixar Ball|bouncy balls]].
After having the same light bulb for over 20 years, [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] had to replace it for him when it went out, which can be seen in the trailer for ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'', replacing the standard bulb with a compact florescent. Luxo, Jr. has been seen in every Pixar feature film and short film since ''[[Toy Story]]'', during the film's introduction and at the end of the credits as the I of the Pixar logo.

Luxo, Jr.'s most recent (albeit temporary) upgrade was that of a laser for the teaser trailer of ''[[Cars 2]]''.

==Pixar Logo==
Luxo, Jr. appears in the logo of Pixar Animation Studios, where he comes in and squishes the "I" in "Pixar".

===Logo variations===
There are some variations of the logo:
*Originally, in the trailers and TV Spots (Including the 1996 home video) of ''[[Toy Story]]'', the words are white on a black background.
**The color were later inverted on ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' for GBC, and ''Operation: Camouflage'' for the iPhone and iPod Touch.
*On ''Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story'', it slowly fades in before the lamp animation starts. After the lamp turns, it slowly fades out.
* On the short film ''Geri's Game'' and ''Disney's Activity Center: A Bug's Life'' for the PC, it is open matted.
**The latter, however, ends slightly differently the background suddenly turns off leaving it a blue glow around it which slowly dims and the lamp's brightness dims slightly before turning off.
* Beginning in 1998 at the beginning of films from ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' onward (Not counting ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Cars]]''; including the beginning of the 2000 DtV feature ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]'', the short films ''Boundin'' and ''One Man's Band'', and the non-theatrical prints of ''Cars 2''), it animates as normal, but it ends similar to the ''D'sAS:TS'' version. The difference from that version is the fading is faster.
** The ''BLoSC:TAB'' version has it vertically off-centered.
*A still version with Luxo, Jr. exists on ''Toy Story 3'' for the iPhone and iPod Touch.
*Mainly on trailers and TV spots, at the beginning of ''Monsters, Inc.'', at the beginning of shorts starting from ''Partly Cloudly'', at the end of TV specials, and on the second trailer for ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]'' titled "Dante's Treat", the tail end of the animation plays.
*On June 28th, 2008, starting with ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'', it was given an HD look with the same animation intact.
* At the end of the theatrical release of ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'', it plays as normal, but it cuts in at the beginning, but after the lamp turns, it freezes for the few seconds before "ANIMATION STUDIOS" fades in.
**Beginning with ''[[Up]]'', after the lamp turns "ANIMATION STUDIOS" then fades in.
*At the beginning of the 2009 2D re-release of ''[[Toy Story]]'', it plasters the existing WDP logo variation, but still fades to the opening shot.
* On ''Kinect Rush: A Disney/Pixar Adventure'', the animation starts from the point where the lamp is already in place.
*On one TV spot for ''[[Finding Dory]]'', "ANIMATION STUDIOS" is absent.
*At both the beginning (Opening variant) and the end (Normal version) of ''[[Cars 3]]'', it cuts in like the ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'' theatrical version (and it's custom variant).
*On the teaser trailer for ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' on [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s official Facebook page, it is oddly cropped up in the middle to unfit into the vertical ratio cutting out the "P" & "R" in "PIXAR" and the half of "ANIMATION STUDIOS".
*In opening logos of ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', the logo is reanimated to be in the style of the movie's closing credits, with a completely different color scheme.
*In the opening logos of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', it straightly transitions to a thunderstorm during the flashback scene, where Luxo, Jr. can slightly still be seen glowing his bulb in the rain.
**In the closing logos for said movie, Duke Caboom takes Luxo, Jr.'s place. After he finishes, the winter Combart Carl arrives. Duke gives him a high-five and the logo cuts to black.
*In the openings titles of ''[[Pixar Popcorn]]'', Luxo, Jr. keeps finding popcorn as it rains over him.

Anniversary Variants:
*In 2006, Pixar celebrated 20 years. At the beginning of ''[[Cars]]'' (Excluding the 3D version), the logo plays as normal. When the background darkens, the words: "Celebrating 20 years".
*In 2011, Pixar celebrated 25 years. At the beginning of theatrical prints of ''[[Cars 2]]'', the logo plays as normal, but after the lamp turns, the letters of "PIXAR" (Excluding the already squished "I") and "ANIMATION STUDIOS" fades out leaving the background and lamp behind. Then it fades to black, as "CELEBRATING" (With the "C" formed from Luxo, Jr.'s light) fades in, zooming forward.

==Trivia==

*The inspiration for the design and size of Luxo, Jr. came from Spencer Porter, son of Tom Porter. Tom had brought his son to work one day and [[John Lasseter]] was inspired by how much larger Spencer's head was compared to the rest of his body, plus the size of his eyes compared to the rest of his head.<ref>[http://www.videobash.com/video_show/disney-pixar-25-magic-moments-1178972 Disney Pixar - 25 Magic Moments, BBC]</ref>
