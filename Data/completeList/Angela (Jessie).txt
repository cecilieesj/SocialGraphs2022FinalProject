'''Angela''' is [[Agatha (Jessie)|Agatha]]'s twin sister. The only difference is that she appears to be more attractive than her sister.

==Character History==
[[Agatha (Jessie)|Agatha]], like many sisters, thinks Angela is evil, which is later revealed to be true in "Evil Times Two" when she squirms her way into the Ross clan by her friendliness and looks to try to win over the Ross siblings and steal Jessie's job. In the end, her plan is ruined and she leaves the Ross family alone after the kids choose Jessie to be their nanny.
