'''Juju''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2009]] film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. He is [[Mama Odie]]'s pet snake.

==Background==
Very loyal and highly affectionate, Juju is Mama Odie's closest companion, acting as her eyes throughout their hidden home. And although Juju acts as Mama Odie's personal little assistant, he is also treated as her very own child, much like the stereotype that the elderly treat their pets as their own children.

Juju first appears in the film right after [[Mama Odie]] rescues [[Naveen]] from a pack of [[Shadow Demons|shadow demons]]. Juju is called by Mama Odie and shows his affection for her. It is shown she treats him like a baby. Juju is also shown during the scene to assist Mama Odie as her cane and guide through the tree due to her blindness. During the song "[[Dig a Little Deeper]]", Juju is turned into a dog, a pig, a cow, and a goat before returning to his original form as Mama Odie sings that to [[Tiana]] and Naveen that it doesn't matter what they are. Juju appears at Tiana and Naveen's marriage and celebrates alongside Mama Odie and the bayou animals.
