'''Kid Loki''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]] that appears in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''. He is a [[Variants|Variant]] of [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] that was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and sent to [[the Void]], where he managed not only to survive but also to become the ruler of the place.

==Background==
Kid Loki is a Loki from an alternate reality. Under unknown circumstances, he killed his adoptive brother, [[Thor Odinson|Thor]]. This created a nexus event which caused the [[Sacred Timeline]] to branch, so he was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] and his reality was destroyed. He was then judged for his crimes against the Sacred Timeline and pruned, being sent to [[the Void]]. Kid Loki spent thousands of years at the end of time without ageing and, at some point, he became the King of the Void.

====''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''====
Kid Loki first appears during the middle credits scene of the [[The Nexus Event|fourth episode]]. He along with [[Classic Loki]], [[Alligator Loki]] and [[Boastful Loki]] find the [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Variant of Loki]] that was recently pruned and sent to [[the Void]] by the TVA. They invite him to join them in order to survive.

In the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], Kid Loki and the other [[Variants]] are questioned by Loki, who is exasperated asking them about what is going on while the Lokis are in a rush to walk away from there. Kid Loki tells him that he should be careful to not alert [[Alioth]]. Kid Loki explains that they are at the place where everything is transported after being pruned by the TVA and Alioth, a living tempest that consumes energy and matter, assures that nothing ever returns. So, they are moving fast because they want to survive and not be devoured by Alioth. After they are done with the explanation, Kid Loki announces that they should keep walking and the other Variants follow him, surprising Loki. When Loki asks why all of them would listen orders from a child, the older Loki explains that the Void is Kid Loki's kingdom. Surprised, Loki asks Kid Loki what his nexus event was. He is even more perplexed when Kid Loki replies that he killed Thor.

The Loki Variants walk until they arrive at their underground hideout, the Loki Palace. Inside it, Kid Loki sits on his throne and drinks a juice box, while they tell Loki about their stories. Eventually, Loki decides to leave to try to go back to the TVA, but Classic Loki states that this would only result in his death. As Loki replies that dying was his destiny anyway, Kid Loki points out that he is different from them and asks why. Loki states that Kid Loki is mistaken, that he is just like them, but he knows someone, a [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|woman Loki Variant]] who is different as she is trying to take down the TVA instead of taking over it. Loki tells them that Sylvie needs him, so he intents to kill Alioth and go back to the TVA to find her. Loki asks for their help, but Kid Loki and the other Lokis laugh, thinking that is impossible for him to kill Alioth. However, as Loki attempts to leave the hideout, another Loki Variant, [[President Loki]], accompanied by several other Lokis, enters the Loki Palace.

Classic Loki accuses Loki of leading President Loki to them, but it is then revealed that President Loki had done a deal with Boastful Loki, who betrayed Kid Loki by revealing their location in exchange of gaining the army of Lokis and becoming the new King of the Void. But while Boastful Loki points his hammer to Kid Loki, taking him as a hostage, President Loki claims that he is not willing to let him have the army and the throne. Following this, President Loki is betrayed by his own army, who also fight to claim the throne. President Loki then notices Alligator Loki and asks why there is an alligator in the hideout. Kid Loki and Classic Loki state that the alligator is also a Loki, just before Alligator Loki bites off President Loki's hand. A battle starts and while all the Lokis confront each other, Kid Loki carries Alligator Loki away from the fight as Classic Loki casts illusions that allow them to escape from the hideout safely.

[[File:Kid Loki and Classic Loki with Loki EP5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kid Loki and the other Lokis plan how to defeat Alioth.]]

Outside, Classic Loki exclaims that all versions of Loki are broken and blind by their own ambitions, while a frustrated Kid Loki states that every time one of them try to fix themselves, the TVA appears and sends them to die in the Void. Loki explains that this exactly the reason he needs to return to the TVA and find Sylvie. Classic Loki asks Loki if he trusts Sylvie, and Loki replies that she is the only one he really trusts and their only chance to bring down the TVA. Hearing this, Kid Loki is convinced, and they accept to help Loki to face Alioth. While the Lokis are watching Alioth from afar and trying to devise a plan to confront it, they see a car approaching. Kid Loki warns Loki that it could be cannibalistic marauders or cannibalistic pirates, but Loki realizes that it is Sylvie, and runs to meet her. Loki introduces Sylvie and [[Mobius]] to the other Lokis. Sylvie is surprised that the other Lokis agreed with Loki's plan to kill Alioth, but Kid Loki replies that he was not sure that this plan would work, and Alligator Loki and Classic Loki also think the same. Sylvie explains that she plans to enchant Alioth instead.

Later, Kid Loki, Classic Loki and Alligator Loki are sitting together with Mobius around a fire. Kid Loki asks Mobius what he will do if he returns to the TVA, and he replies that he wants to tell the truth to the other workers. When they are planning to face Alioth, Kid Loki tells them where the branched timeline will appear, so that Sylvie is able to enchant the creature while it is distracted. Loki decides to stay and help Sylvie instead of returning to the TVA with Mobius. Before leaving to go to the TVA, Mobius asks the Lokis Variants if they would like to get out the Void with him, but Kid Loki replies that they are staying and Classic Loki states that the Void is their home. Kid Loki then conjures a sword and gives it to Loki, before waving him goodbye and leaving accompanied by Classic Loki and Alligator Loki.

==Trivia==
*According to Jack Veal, Kid Loki is the oldest [[Variants|Variant]] in [[the Void]]. He was pruned thousands of years before the events of "[[Journey into Mystery]]", and didn't age because of the Void being the end of time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedirect.com/article/loki-kid-mcu-void-age?utm_content=buffer3a9c7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer|title= MCU Star Reveals Kid Loki Has Spent an Extreme Amount of Time In The Void|website=The Direct|date=[[July 20]], [[2021]]}}</ref>
