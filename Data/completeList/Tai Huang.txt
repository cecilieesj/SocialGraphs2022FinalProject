==Background==
Huang serves as the captain of Sao Feng's guard at [[Singapore]]. He wears a straw workman's hat and a studded leather cloak.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
Arriving in the town of [[Singapore]], [[Elizabeth Swann]] encounters Tai Huang who warns her that singing "[[Hoist the Colours]]" could be dangerous alone. As [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] approaches him, he explains to Huang that his master [[Sao Feng]] is expecting him to protect her from danger. As the [[East India Trading Company|EITC]] soldiers arrive, Huang and the other soldiers leave just as Elizabeth and Barbossa meet up with Sao Feng at the bathhouse just as Huang follows alongside the couple. Sao Feng then gives the navigational charts to Tai Huang just as he warns Barbossa about the dangers of [[Davy Jones' Locker]] to which Barbossa tells Sao Feng about the [[Brethren Court]], alongside a plan to rescue [[Jack Sparrow]] just as Huang and the rest of the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' escape from the EITC soldiers and board the ''Hai Peng'' to seek the World's End.

On their way to Davy Jones' Locker, Huang explains to [[Will Turner]] that the [[Mao Kun Map]] leads to more places over the edge to which Barbossa warns him that going the Davy Jones' Locker is the only way of getting Jack back from the dead. As the Hai Peng falls into the Locker, Huang and the rest of the crew encounter Jack Sparrow who finds himself in this place too just and open looking at his crew, Tai Huang introduces himself to Jack to which he explains that he has a ship called the Black Pearl to which he explains to Jack that he is a good bidder just. Tai Huang and the rest of his man sail to escape the Locker under command of Jack Sparrow.

As the crew arrives on a small island where the [[Kraken]]'s corpse is at (because [[Davy Jones]] is forced to kill the Kraken under [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]]'s order), the group arrives just as Tai Huang and his men turn against Jack and Barbossa as hostages as the ''Empress'' is discovered from a distance as part of the deal between Feng and Turner. Under command by Sao Feng, Barbossa and his crew fight against the HMS ''Endeavor'' just as the crew sets sail to Shipwreck Cove.

On the ''Empress'' when the ''Flying Dutchman'' is attacking the ship Huang is on, he later gazes upon Sao Feng's death under attack by the ''Dutchman'' with Elizabeth declared as captain of the ''Empress'', much to Huang's shock about Elizabeth's duty as captain. When Davy Jones boarded the vessel and asked who was captain, Huang was later locked in the ship's prison along with Elizabeth and the crew.

After consulting the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court in an attempt to free [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]], Huang and the other crew members plan to free just as the EITC plans to attack to which the crew manages to free her. When Elizabeth tells all the other pirates to hoist the colors, Tai Huang and his men raise the flags to prepare for battle against the EITC and the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' just as Calypso is free, causing in a maelstrom to occur; this explains that Huang found respect for Elizabeth Swann during her duty as captain.

After surviving the battle of the EITC's forces with Lord Cutler Beckett killed, Huang and his men celebrate their freedom along with the other pirates who celebrate their freedom. Shortly afterwards, some of Huang's men join the Black Pearl to be part of Barbossa's crew.

==Trivia==
*According to [[Terry Rossio]]'s original script for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', Tai Huang was to return in the fifth film where he was to accept pardons by Admiral John Benbow of the British Royal Navy, but the character was removed from the final version.
