'''Manu''' is a character who was featured in the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]".

==History==
===Background===
Manu serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the Japan-exclusive incarnation of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, he and the other emcee birds try to investigate the case of something weird going on in the Tiki Room attraction. After the culprit behind the mess is revealed to be [[Stitch]], Manu and the other emcee birds scold Stitch for disrupting the show to which Stitch then apologizes to them for doing pranks in the Tiki Room. After Stitch accepts to perform in the show after promising not to do anymore pranks, Manu then performs with Stitch with the other emcee birds who then participate with him during the end of the show.

===Development History===
After [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]] closed in early [[2008]], the hosts from this incarnation of the attraction, Danno, Lava, Scats, and Buddy, are replaced by four new unique bird hosts: Manu, Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli when the attraction opened on summer 2008 where the incarnation features a storyline different from the one in the original incarnation.

==Role in the attraction==
Manu and the other four emcee birds are introduced singing the musical number "[[Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride]]" to which during the song, the lights go out just as the four emcee birds look at the strange graffiti on the wall whom he thinks it is the Big Kahuna who is behind the mess, warning the other emcee birds that if they make the Big Kahuna angry, the Tiki Room would be in trouble just as Mahina explains to him that the writing on the wall says "Aloha e komo mai" to which Hau'oli explains that this writing is the title of their next musical number to which Manu explains to the other emcee birds that the tiki gods must be knowing about this song just as the musical number "Aloha, E Komo Mai" begins. After the song, Manu tells Waha Nui to not upset the Big Kahuna just as Waha Nui tells him "Kahuna matata" where he plans to play the next musical number "[[Hawaiian War Chant]]". As the [[Orchids]] begin their next musical number, Manu suddenly notices Stitch disrupting the show much to Waha Nui's worry as Manu warns Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli to not upset the Big Kahuna in which Waha Nui plans to cancel the musical number to which the song suddenly ends.

As the emcee birds are discussing about the Big Kahuna, Manu then plans on giving out the next musical number "[[On the Beach at Waikiki]]" with the [[Showgirl Birds|Winged Wahines]] performing their part. Noticing the plastic blue ears on their heads, Manu tells them that the Big Kahuna could have made the Winged Wahines blue to which upon noticing the blue paint on the Winged Wahines (triggered by blue light filter effect), they plan on not finishing the song until the culrpit behind the mess is gone. Noticing the Winged Wahines leaving off for Waikiki in disgust, he sings to Mahina that he will "fly off to the beach at Waikiki" just as the song ends.

After the song, the culprit behind the trouble is revealed to be [[Stitch]] who was playing pranks throughout the show just as Manu and the other emcee birds worriedly notice this and it is revealed that the "Big Kahuna" is actually Stitch doing pranks. Manu and the other emcee birds scold Stitch for causing trouble in the show. Worried that being punished in the Tiki Room is no fun for him, Stitch then promises not to do anymore pranks in the show just as the emcee birds accept Stitch's promise to which a reprise of "Aloha, E Komo Mai" begins. Manu then sings with the other emcee birds during the reprise while singing with Stitch accepted in the show. As the song pauses, Manu explains to Stitch that "ohana" means "family" just as Stitch is accepted to be in the show promising not to do pranks anymore just as Manu and the inhabitants of the Tiki Room sing with Stitch accepted to perform with the entire Tiki Room cast (except for the Winged Wahines who left during the show) just as they sing along happy about being in Stitch's ohana. As the show ends, Manu and the other emcee birds bid farewell to the guests as  he and the other emcee birds discuss that the "Big Kahuna" does not exist and it is actually Stitch the whole time throughout the show.

==Trivia==
*"Manu" means "bird" in Hawaiian language.
