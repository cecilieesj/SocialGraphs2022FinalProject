'''Uncle Jack''' is [[Jack Sparrow]]'s uncle in the film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''. He is a pirate who is recently imprisoned in Saint Martin's prison.

==Role in the film==
When [[Jack Sparrow]] was sent to prison after being discovered by guards who arrest him for robbing the bank in Saint Martin (though Sparrow did not collect enough money for his crew), Jack notices his uncle who looks like him and he is satisfied that he never saw him a long time while the soldiers plan to kill Sparrow the next day. Sparrow talks to his uncle in the cell and is worried telling him that he is sentenced to die during the next day for Sparrow's crimes to which his uncle tells his nephew about a joke focusing a skeleton in a bar. As a nearby prisoner laughed at Jack's joke, Sparrow explains that he found the joke funny before the soldiers put him in punishment. Jack then later tells his nephew to mention his name during the execution so that he wouldn't be in the same situation he had before in [[Port Royal]]; Sparrow's crew, however, saved him from execution so that Jack Sparrow could continue his journey. He is never seen again throughout the rest of the film; therefore, his further fate is unknown.

==Trivia==
*Uncle Jack is named after [[Paul McCartney]]'s own uncle, John "Jack McCartney".
*Because he is [[Captain Teague]]'s brother, it is possible that his full name is "Jack Teague", though it has yet to be confirmed by the Disney Company themselves.
*The language uncle Jack sings is an old Liverpool sailors song.
*Uncle Jack's joke "A skeleton walks into a bar, orders a mop and a beer" is a reference to the film Donnie Brasco, because during filming, actor Al Pacino told the same joke to Johnny Depp repeatedly.
