A series of press is held, for the new Captain America, one of which, is set at his and Lemar's former school. He goes into the locker room to check in on his friend, while, John's wife, Olivia exits. He jokingly questions if John has puked yet, which she denies, and tells him he's up. He walks in on John stumbling on his speech, as he prepares to talk to the audience, and Lemar remarks that, that is why he failed drama class. He expresses his disbelief at the situation, referencing how only two weeks ago, they were prepping their team on a special-ops mission in Chile. John remains dissatisfied, with what the job has entailed of so far, and Lemar tells him that doing press is part of the occupancy, stating how the suit comes with expectations and he can no longer punch his way through problems. Later on, Lemar and John travel to Munich, [[Germany]], while investigating the Flag Smashers, and come across [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] and [[Bucky Barnes]]. The pair introduce themselves, while fighting members of the Flag-Smashers on the roof of a van, but are ultimately bested by the group, who hold enhanced strength, leaving them on the roadside, as they drive away. Following the fight, Lemar and John take a vehicle to the airport where they comes across Bucky and Sam, walking. They discuss the nature of the Flag-Smashers and Falcon reveals them to be super soldiers to Lemars shock, who wasn't aware they existed. The two jump in the vehicle with Lemar and John, and discuss the intent of the Flag-Smashers. When Sam questions how they tracked them, Lemar reveals that they tracked Falcon through Redwing, and John adds in that it's government property, which he is a representative of. They talk about how the Global Repatriation Council are working to manage resources post-Blip, and Sam questions why the two of them have been sent. Lemar replies that while they provide the resources, it's their job to keep things stable. John offers an alliance to the pair, but when they refuse, Lemar intervenes, stating that while he holds respect for them, they were losing, until he and John shows up. Bucky asks who he is again, and when Lemar gives him his name, Sam further inquires about his identity. He provides him with his hero alias, Battlestar, and informs them he is John's partner. This response angers Bucky, who orders them to stop the car and leaves, with Sam following him, shortly after. Bucky is later arrested for missing his man dated court session, and Lemar arrives with Walker to the police station. The pair wait for them outside, and when they come out, they again propose an alliance, informing them of the tactics they've adopted to take on the Flag Smashers. While the four agree the Flag Smashers need to be apprehended, Sam and Bucky refuse to work with them, and the group part ways.

Lemar and John travel to Munich, with GRC, where they storm a warehouse, in search for Karli Morgenthau, after getting a lead that she passed through there. John calls over Lemar to act as a translator, for a suspect, he wants to question, and Lemar asks him in German, if he has seen Karli, but he denies having any knowledge on her. The pair leave, realizing they aren't going to get any answers, and John deduces that Karli must be funneling something from someone they cant't see. Lemar points out how Karli's actions in giving displaced people shelter and medicine, creates loyalty. He understand that John wants to bring her in, but notes how they've used the resources disposed to them, and still don't have any results. In reponse, John suggests they see [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]], who is being held in Berlin. The pair head there, only to find he's escaped. John suggests Sam and Bucky helped him break out, but Lemar disagrees with John's theory and argues they can't accuse them, without evidence. John suggests they chase this up up and Lemar points out that this won't be on-the-books, but John believes that if they get the job done, no one will question the methods they took.

Lemar and John arrive in Latvia, to discover Zemo, working alongside Sam and Bucky. They learn that Karli will be attending a funeral, where they plan to intercept her, and Lemar points out that it means civilians will also be present, possibly resulting in  a high risk of casualties. Lemar convinces John, to give Sam a chance to talk Karli down, before any action takes place. The group head to Karli's location, and wait for Sam to deal with Karli on his own terms. Less than ten minutes later, John decides to intervene, and apprehend Karli himself. He enters the room, and Lemar follows, but she manages to escape their grasp. Following this, Lemar and John later head to Sam and Bucky's quarters, so they can turn in Zemo to the authorities. Sam and John get into a disagreement, on Zemo, when the [[Dora Milaje]] arrive, demanding Zemo be taken into their custody instead. Their situation further escalates, and [[Ayo]] attacks John, causing Lemar to run to his defense. The pair get into a brawl with the [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] warriors, but are no match. When they discover Zemo escaped in the middle of the chaos, they leave to capture him, and Lemar runs towards his partner, who is distraught, that he was beaten. He picks him, and the pair also leave. They head to a cafe, where they grab a cup of coffee, and discuss the destruction of the remaining vials of the [[Super Soldier Serum|super soldier serum]]. In the middle of their conversation, two women arrive, and ask for John's autograph. Lemar asks how long it'll take before it gets annoying, and John jokingly replies that Lemar is mad because she didn't ask for his autograph, but Lemar responds that it's her loss, as he includes a Battlestar logo to draw with it. John questions if Lemar would take the serum, had he the chance, and Lemar answers he would. John asks if he wouldn't be worried about the changes he may face, taking it, but Lemar believes that power makes a person, more of themself, and compares Karli Morgenthau and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. John questions himself, but Lemar reminds his friend that he has three Medals of Honor and consistently makes the right decisions, in the heat of the battle. John admits he thinks what he did to earn those merits, were the worst day of his life, and the actions that took place in Afghanistan, felt a long way from being right. He further adds that being Captain America has given him the chance to do something that feels right, and Lemar ponders on how many lives they could've saved, if they had the serum. Later on, Lemar and John head to a location, they believe the Flag Smashers to be. They infiltrate the building and split up, in search of them. Lemar is ambushed by two of the members, and tied to a pillar. When he comes to, he manages to escape his restraints with a knife, and leaves, in his weakened state, in search for John. Lemar manages to find his partner, who is moments away from being stabbed by Karli, when he intercepts her attack. In response, she punches him back, throwing him against another pillar, which kills him.

Lemar's death enrages John, who immediately chases Karli out of the building, but she escapes and he ends up chasing Nico instead. He pins Nico to the ground in front of a crowd of onlookers on a city street. Nico reminds John that he was not Lemar's killer, but John does not care and uses the shield to beat Nico to death anyway. With the iconic shield covered in blood, John turns to face the horrified onlookers, most of whom have filmed the incident. 

This incident, coupled with John's deteriorating sanity (which, unknown to the government, is due to him taking the super soldier serum), leads to him being stripped of all of his war medals and the title of Captain America. He later visits Lemar's family and lies to them that he killed the person responsible for Lemar's death, when in reality Karli was the one who accidentally killed him and Nico was simply a bystander.
