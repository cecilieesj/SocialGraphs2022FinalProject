'''Grandpappy Beagle''' is the grandfather of [[Ma Beagle]] in [[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]. Prior to the series, he apparently stole the deed to Duckburg only to lose it to Scrooge McDuck, thus inciting the vendetta of Ma and the Beagle Boys against Scrooge.

He makes his first physical appearance in the season 2 episode [[Last Christmas!]]

==Appearances==
===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
In [[Last Christmas!]], Grandpappy appears alongside his three great-grandchildren, Babyface, Bankjob and Bugle to rob past Scrooge's Christmas party when present Scrooge travels back in time to relive past Christmases.
