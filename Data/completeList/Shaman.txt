He is a wizard hungry for power and the former ruler of the rat people.

==Role in the series==
The Shaman is the leader of the rat people. He orders them to capture [[Genie]] so that he can have his powers. When he sees [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]], [[Abu]], and [[Merc]] approach his cave with his ship, he orders the rat people to stop them, but it's too late, the ship crashes through the wall. He then begins to fight the three. After Genie tells the rat people that the Shaman isn't their true leader, they fight the Shaman, take his staff and destroy it. The shadow creature, which the Shaman created to devour Aladdin and Abu, devours him instead and it disappears. With The Shaman's death, Genie regains his powers.
