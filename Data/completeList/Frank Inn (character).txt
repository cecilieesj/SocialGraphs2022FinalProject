}}'''Frank Inn''' is a character in the 1987 film ''[[Benji the Hunted]] ''. He is the owner of [[Benji]].

==Role==
In Oregon, Benji has gone missing while filming a movie on location. Benji’s trainer, Frank Inn, tells a television reporter that he and Benji had been on an open fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean when a storm came in, capsizing the vessel. Inn fears Benji is dead, but the movie producers plan to search the wilderness coastline with a helicopter.

As Benji tries to get the Mother Cougar to adopt the cubs, the helicopter flies overhead and Benji sees his trainer in the window. By the time Benji has finished moving the cubs to the new den, another animal has eaten the quail. Benji searches for more food, barking at the cubs when they try to follow him. Meanwhile, the Timbero Wolf begins to movie in on the cubs, but the helicopter flies overhead, scaring him away. 

Later, the Mother Cougar drinks from the stream when one of the cubs approaches. Just then, the helicopter flies overhead, scaring her away. When Benji spots the cougar again, he barks at the cubs to follow him across the stream. The helicopter lands nearby and Frank Inn gets out, calling for Benji. The dog looks between his master and the cubs playing, but does not make a move. Unaware Benji is nearby, Inn gets back into the helicopter and flies away.

With all three cubs on the mountaintop, the cougar appears. She sniffs the cubs and nuzzles them. The cub that has been following the lioness comes into the meadow, sees its newfound siblings and runs to join them. The cougar lies down and the four cubs nurse from their adoptive mother. Benji goes to rest in plain sight in the meadow just as the helicopter approaches.
