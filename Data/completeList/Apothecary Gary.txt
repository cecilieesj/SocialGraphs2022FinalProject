'''Apothecary Gary '''is a character that appears in the animated [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] series ''[[Amphibia]]''. He is a formerly evil fungus that is able to take over the mind of his host. 

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Apothecary Gary, in his fungus form, resembles a large purple mushroom with light blue spots that flashes as he speaks. His host's eyes turn bright purple with light pink pupils. 

==History==
Apothecary Gary made his first appearance in the episode segment "[[Children of the Spore]]" as the main antagonist. Prior to the events of the episode segment, Apothecary Gary took control of a local frog named Lloyd. He later encountered [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]] and tricked him to having a jar of elixir that would make [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]], and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] behave better. However, unbeknownst to Hop Pop, the "elixir" is actually a concoction of mind-control spores. 

Slowly, the spores took over Anne, Sprig, Polly, and the rest of the Wartwood residence (except for Hop Pop and [[Bessie (Amphibia)|Bessie]]). After revealing his true self and motive, Gary battled Hop Pop in Bessie's stable. Eventually, Gary was eaten alive by Bessie after she ate the rest of his mushrooms, breaking his control over the other Wartwood residents, despite his pleads that his species would become extinct. Despite this, some of his spores survived and took control of Hop Pop's beetle Jeremy, which grew another Gary. 

After leaving Wartwood, Gary and his host traveled Amphibia for a place to regrow Gary's strength. After long traveling and hardships, they were eventually found and taken in by the future citizens of Gardenton, where they formed a true symbiotic relationship where the frogs willingly used Gary's spores to become better gardeners without mind control, using this power to make Gardenton into a paradise.

At some point during that time, [[King Andrias]] got his hands on Gary's species' spores and used them for mind control collars to control the local wildlife that were produced in a factory until it was boom-shroomed by the Wartwood Resistance. 

In "[[The Beginning of the End]]", during the battle against Andrias' forces he returns to aid the Resistance, where he uses his spores to override the spores used on the beasts imprisoned by Andrias, allowing them to turn against Andrias's forces.

Nine months after the events of "[[The Hardest Thing]]", Gary has found another fungal to be with.

==Trivia==
*Gary's species seems to be based on the [[wikipedia:Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis|amphibian]] (''Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis'') and [[wikipedia:Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|salamander]] (''Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans'') [[wikipedia:Chytridiomycota|chytrid]] fungi, both of which causes the disease [[wikipedia:Chytridiomycosis|Chytridiomycosis]] in amphibians; as well as [[wikipedia:Entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic fungi]] that controls their victims' brains and sprouts out of their bodies.
*Apothecary Gary is the first major character (excluding the dangerous wildlife) in the series to not be an amphibian but rather an non-animal being. 
*In the Latin American dub, he named '''Apothecario Mario''' in order to rhyme.
**Similar in the Italian dub, where he named '''Battista il Farmacista'''
