'''Professor Garrett Reed''' is a character from the [[Jungle Cruise]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Garrett Reed was an unethical archaeologist and member of the ''[[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]'' in the 1920s.  Due to a controversial Egyptian expedition in [[1929]], Reed would have his membership to the society stripped by one [[Lord Henry Mystic]] who was revolted by Reed's actions.  Garrett would also become enemies with rival archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]] as Garrett would often sell archaeological findings on the black-market such as an ancient idol in Peru that he competed with Jones for.

By [[1932]], Reed had become a wanted criminal and also became obsessed with three mystical emeralds known as the Emerald Trinity.  These being three jewels defended by the jungle which would grant immortality to whomever took possession of them.  In his attempt to steal the jewels, Reed would be attacked by jungle vines aiming to protect the emeralds which killed him and shoved his body into the dirt.

== Appearances ==

=== [[Jungle River Cruise: Curse of the Emerald Trinity]] ===
Reed is a supporting-antagonist within this Halloween overlay for [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]'s Jungle Cruise.  Extraneous information on him is given in the queue and he is directly encountered within a base camp where guests witness his murder.

== Trivia ==

*Both photos of Reed in the Daily Colonial Journal were photographs of historic Egyptologist, Howard Carter (1874-1939).  Reed's main profile picture is a horizontally flipped photo of Carter with another man's face edited on-top while the photo of him grave robbing is an unedited photograph of Carter unearthing the tomb of Tutankhamen.
*While grave robbing is a legitimate colonial crime arguably worth being expelled for, Lord Henry Mystic expelling Garrett Reed for grave-robbing a mummy is hypocritical as Mystic himself is shown in Mystic Manor to have graverobbed.  A portrait in [[Mystic Manor]] depicts Lord Mystic opening up the sarcophagus of an Egyptian mummy and laughing as [[Albert the Monkey|Albert]] rips the bandages off the corpse, and this mummy also appears within the attraction as an artifact in Mystic's personal collection.
*Reed's bio in the Daily Colonial Journal implied he tried to claim the fertility idol from ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' though this is unlikely for timeline reasons as Reed died in 1932, four years prior to the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark.
*Reed might be inspired by [[Ren√© Belloq]] from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
*Garrett is similar to [[Harrison Hightower III]] from [[Tower of Terror]] in being an evil S.E.A.-member who was killed by the mystic relics he attempted to steal.
