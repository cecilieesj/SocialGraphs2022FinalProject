|quote }}The ''' Unkbuut''' are giant supposedly man-eating (but in truth, harmless) spiders led by a queen straight out of the fairy tales that frightened [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] as a child. They appeared in the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' episode; "[[Web of Fear]]".

==Role in the episode==
After an earthquake, Aladdin and his friends are helping the residents of Agrabah get pulled out of the rubble and destroyed buildings. While they do so, two spider-like creatures called Unkbuut appear. After Aladdin saves a little boy's mother with Carpet's help, he runs into a group of Unkbuut and faints. He then tells everyone what he saw. Later, an Unkbuut goes to the palace and kidnaps Jasmine.

Aladdin and the others go find her. They go through a dark tunnel underneath the city. Carpet then gets stuck on a spider web and everyone sees an Unkbuut coming toward them. The tunnel collapses and everyone but Carpet fall. Genie turns into a mattress and everyone lands safely. They then see a line Unkbuut carrying something wrapped in webbing behind their backs and assume they are catching humans to eat. In order to find Jasmine, Genie turns himself into an Unkbuut with Aladdin, Abu, and Iago hidden inside a cocoon.

When they get to a hidden hive of Unkbuut, one of the creatures takes the cocoon off Genie's back. Aladdin opens the cocoon and kicks the Unkbuut in the face so he can get away from it. He then gets on a spider web and Carpet appears out of nowhere and catches Abu and Iago. The Unkbuut are coming toward Aladdin and Genie. Then a high-pitched rhythmic shrieking sound starts and the Unkbuut stop.

The gang finds an even larger Unkbuut coming down, this time with Jasmine on its back. The princess tells the gang that the Unkbuut are not dangerous and reveals that they mean no harm. Meanwhile, the people in Agrabah are planning to destroy the Unkbuut. Back at the underground Unkbuut city, the gang meets a baby Unkbuut and learns more about the creatures. Jasmine tells them that the Unkbuut took her so that they can prove that they're not dangerous as they had no way of communicating with her otherwise. She then shows them that the cocoons are filled with potatoes; the true food the Unkbuut eat. Jasmine also states that they accidentally caused the ground to collapse in their search for potatoes due to the ground being rotted and unstable. Everyone then realizes that the giant Unkbuut is the queen of the hive.

Meanwhile, Farouk is leading a mob who are all carrying torches around the crater. The men throw the torches while the women pour oil into the crater so that they can all burn the creatures. The gang and the Unkbuut see that the underground is filled with smoke and they try to run away from it. When they get out of the tunnel, Jasmine tells everyone that the creatures are not dangerous, though a crazed and irrational Farouk does not believe her at first.

While Genie goes to get water to put out the fire, the little boy and his dog from earlier fall into the crater. Aladdin gets on the Unkbuut queen's back and they go rescue the boy and the dog. After doing so, they see that one side of the web has caught fire. The Unkbuut queen falls down into the crater while Aladdin gets to the other side of the web and carries the boy and dog to safety. The city is happy about Aladdin, the boy, and the dog surviving the fire, but is sad about the Unkbuut queen falling.

Genie shows up with seawater and puts out the fire. The Unkbuut queen climbs out of the crater wet, but unharmed. Aladdin then thanks her, overcoming his mistrust of the creatures and showing the citizens that the Unkbuut are friends as Jasmine said. Meanwhile, the little boy wants his mother to tell him a happy story about the Unkbuut as she takes him home.
==Trivia==
* Unkbuut means "spider" in Arabic.
* Despite being spiders, the Unkbuut more resemble beetles due to the fact they have wing cases, compound eyes and only six legs.
