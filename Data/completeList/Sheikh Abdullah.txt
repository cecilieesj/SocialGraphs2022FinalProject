[[File: Ms. Marvel - 1x02 - Crushed - Sheikh Abdullah Sermon.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
After the attendants of the mosque are finished praying, Sheikh Abdullah begins his sermon. During the middle of his lecture, he overhears a discussion between two girls, and asks they stay quiet, while he's talking. [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] apologizes and expresses her lack of concentration is founded by the fact they have a partition separating them, and she can't see him. Abdullah expresses his pleasure in Kamala attending, but reminds her that the partition and side entrance are their to preserve their modesty and dignity. He thanks her for voicing her opinion, but asks she does so, while he isn't in the middle of a lecture. He also reminds everyone that nominations are open for the Mosque Board's elections.

Abdullah attends the Eid Al-Adha festival, held by the mosque. That evening, he and the others are alerted to the screams of [[Hameed]], who is hanging on from the the window of the mosque tower. He witnesses the superhero Night Light arrive, in an attempt to save him, however Hameed ends up ultimately falling. Night Light manages to create constructs to cushion his fall and lessen the impact, but nonetheless, Hameed crashes onto the hood of a car and gets injured. Sheikh Abdullah and the other witnesses, rush to Hameed's side.

During counting for the Mosque Board election, the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]], lead by [[Sadie Deever|Agent Deever]] enter the building to investigate the mosque's association with Night Light. Abdullah denies that she is operating from within, and jokingly asks that she refer to anyone that can fly, his way, so that they can clean out the rain gutters. Deever orders her men to search the building, and Nakia joins the Sheikh's side to deny them permission. Deever suggests to Abdullah that it would be in his best interest to cooperate, but Nakia and Sheikh Abdullah affirm their positions, and he ask that she return, when she has a signed warrant. As they leave, he tells Deever that the next time they come, she remove her shoes.

Word soon gets out about authorities entering the mosque. Abdullah attends [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] and [[Tyesha Hillman|Tyesha]]'s mehndi party, and [[Auntie Ruby|Ruby]] checks on him, after hearing that the FBI stormed in and accused him of having involvement with Night Light. Abdullah clarifies what happened, and shares that Damage Control only seem to know what they do; that the hero is a brown girl and likely Muslim. When Kamala steps outside, Abdullah joins her, and she asks on his opinions on the new superhero. She shares that she thought it'd be cool to have a superhero, fighting for them, but she only seems to be making things worst, and Abdullah points to Hameed, who would disagree with her. Kamala questions how the hero can convince people she's good, but the Sheikh advises her, that good isn't a thing she is, but a thing she does.

On the day of Aamir and Tyesha's wedding, Abdullah performs the ceremony, and weds the new couple.
