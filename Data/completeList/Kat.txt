[[File:Kat1.png|thumb|250px]]'''Kat''' is an uber ''[[Shake It Up]]'', Chicago! fan who loves Rocky and CeCe. She is featured in the episode "Copy Kat It Up" and is portrayed by [[Kerris Dorsey]].

==Background==
Kat, at first, seems like a sweet girl to CeCe and Rocky , but they have yet to see the 'real' her and her true intentions throughout the episode. Rocky and CeCe meet Kat at Crusty's. After hearing how much she loved them and their show, Rocky and CeCe invite her over CeCe's apartment to watch them dance. She pressures them to tell Gary to hire her as an intern on the show. She begins dressing up like CeCe, wears her hair like CeCe, and even tries to "accidentally" injure CeCe. She helps choreograph one of the dances and is really good at it. This surprises Rocky, since Kat told her that she couldn't dance. Kat even tries to replace CeCe on the show, but Rocky tells her that she isn't going to get away with it, which doesn't faze her. She sends CeCe to a store across town to get a popcorn costume. But when CeCe arrives, she fights for the spotlight. At the end, she moves to New York to join ''Shake It Up, New York'', although the email she had received was a fake email sent by CeCe.
