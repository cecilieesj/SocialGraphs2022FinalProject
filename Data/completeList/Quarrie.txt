He is a Mon Calamari starfighter engineer who lives on the planet Shantipole, and responsible for designing and building the [[B-Wing]] starfighter.

==Role in the series==
Following a great loss against the [[Galactic Empire]] during an attempted blockade run, [[Hera Syndulla]], [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios|Zeb]] journesd to Shantipole in order to retrieve his prototype B-Wing. Quarrie is initially uninterested, as he does not believe Hera to be the right pilot for his ship. However, her story of growing up and dreaming of becoming a pilot sways Quarrie's mind, and he allows her to test the starfighter. After a successful test run, Quarrie accompanies the Rebels to Ibaar, and with his ship in the fight, the Rebels are able to break the Imperial blockade over the planet and deliver food to the planet's starving population. Afterwards, Quarrie leaves the fleet in order to oversee the production of more B-Wings for the Rebel's cause.
