They are two unnamed greater flamingos part of the migration group. They are voiced by [[Anndi McAfee]] and Sarah Grace Wright.

==Background==
===Personality===
The flamingo girls are shown to have a joyful personality whenever they party at their beach. However, much to their chagrin, they dislike it when their beach moments are interrupted.

===Physical Appearance===
Like all flamingos in the ''Lion Guard'' universe, the flamingo girls have pink plumage, black feathers, and thin black eyebrows.

==Role in the series==
===''[[The Race to Tuliza]]''===
When [[Ono]] decides to talk to the flamingos to keep the noise level down, two of the flamingo girls arrive and tell Ono that the flock of flamingos is on migration. They explain that every year, they stop to migrate at the beach they call "Flamingo Beach". As the flamingos dance at sea, [[Makini]] takes Kion away to a safe place from the flamingos spending their time at sea performing the musical number "[[Flamingo Dance Party]]", much to their bothersome performance to Kion.

When [[Kion]]'s friends are trying to stop the noisy flamingos from bothering Kion's peaceful nap, [[Anga]] tells the noisy flamingos to stop but the flamingos don't listen. The flamingo girls think Anga is doing an amazing trick the two find interesting, much to Anga feeling serious and worried about Kion being disturbed as the flamingos continuing partying at the beach. Trying to stop the noisy flamingos from waking up Kion was not successful as the flamingo girls notice Kion floating in front of them as the flamingos try touching him. Enraged, Kion prepares to use the [[Roar of the Elders]] to blast away the noisy flamingos for disturbing his sleep, but this is prevented when Anga sees [[Fuli]] and [[Azaad]] with Tuliza for Kion.

When Fuli and Azaad arrive at Flamingo Beach, they give the Tuliza to Kion in order to stop Kion from blasting away the flamingos and to calm his temper. Kion then apologizes for being rude to the flamingos to which the flamingo girls accept his apology as a misunderstanding. Kion tells the Guard to leave the flamingos alone so they can spend more time at sea.

==Trivia==
*They are one of the few flamingos in the ''Lion King'' franchise to actually speak individually. Many flamingos are featured as background characters in the franchise with no speaking roles.
*Like the rest of their flock, it is not known whether or not if the flamingo girls are from the [[Pride Lands]] or not as their actual home is never mentioned.
