'''Ben Baxter'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0399151/</ref> (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Phineas-and-Ferb/Ben-Baxter/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0071818/</ref> is an executive with Huge-O-Records.

==Biography==

He met Phineas and the Ferb-Tones at The Next Super American Pop Teen Idol Star competition and later offered them a contract for a follow-up single. [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]], however, refused with a diva tantrum, saying that they weren't interested in "obscene amounts of cash". They all left, saying that "The Phineas and the Ferb-Tones is strictly a one-hit-wonder! Good day to you, sir!" Once PFT was gone, Baxter said that it didn't matter, because they still had a tape of their song. The tape, however, vanished, thanks to [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz]]'s robot building which, thanks to [[Perry the Platypus|Agent P]], sneezed, causing the tape to fall out of Ben Baxter's hands and into Perry's hand. Agent P instantly used the tape to grab onto a flagpole, destroying it and preventing Baxter from making two decades of entertainment out of it ("[[Flop Starz]]").
==Background Information==

The conference room where Ben Baxter meets with Phineas and the Ferb-Tones to discuss a recording contract has several awards visible on the walls. Among them is an award for Lindana that was received in 1985. However, when Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Agent P crash through the wall, the awards are missing on that wall.
