'''Owl''' is [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra's]] pet owl in the show, ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
He is very loyal to Cassandra and is trained to follow her without verbal command. Per Cassandra's teachings, he is also an attack owl, having been taught to "go for the enemy's eyes". Unlike most owls, Owl does not mind being out in the day. He can also be very expressive with his face, scolding Cass when she lied to Rapunzel about the "Challenge of the Brave" or the circumstances regarding her path of darkness and use of magic.

Much like Cass, Owl is fairly distant, and even cold at times, especially towards Pascal initially. It isn't until [[Pascal]] saves his life as [[Rapunzel's Tower|Rapunzel's tower]] crumbled that he starts to slowly warm up to him.

Although Owl is loyal, this is not absolute; though he continued to remain by Cassandra's side following her betrayal to Rapunzel for a short while, he eventually left her, seeing she was slowly starting to lose herself and was no longer the same person she once was. When they were reunited, Owl silently scolded her for her [[Islands Apart|re]][[Cassandra's Revenge|cent]] [[Race to the Spire|ac]][[A Tale of Two Sisters (Tangled)|tions]]. Owl shows he still cares for his friends and the safety and well being of others as he desperately flew back to Corona to save the Captain and protected Rapunzel and Eugene from the various bird copies of Cassandra. He returns to Cassandra's side in the end of "[[Plus Est En Vous]]".

==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==
Throughout the early part of the series, Owl has only made minor appearances, such as training alongside Cassandra in "[[Challenge of the Brave]]" and helping her with the expo decorations in "[[Great Expotations]]". In "[[The Quest for Varian]]", Owl plays a more active role when he joins [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], [[Rapunzel]], [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], [[Pascal]], and [[Maximus]] on their trip to Old Corona to find the bronze Graphtyc for [[Varian]]. Throughout the episode, Owl acts very cold towards Pascal as well showing an interest in eating him. However, he did express gratitude when Pascal saved him from falling.

By season two, Owl accompanies Cassandra on Rapunzel's journey following the [[Black Rocks]].

By season three, Owl remains by Cassandra's side even after she betrayed Rapunzel and took the [[Moonstone Opal]] for herself. However, in "[[Islands Apart]]", Owl has left Cassandra and returns to Corona alone, reuniting with Rapunzel and Eugene and leads them back to [[Terapi Island]] to save the [[Captain of the Guards]].

==Trivia==
*Owl is loosely based on a Red Phase Eastern Screech Owl.
*Co-Executive Producer, Ben Balistreri, originally wanted to name Owl "Who", but Story Editor Jase Ricci insisted on just naming him "Owl".
*Owl (who is a Western Screech Owl) was initially going to be a Great Horned Owl. However, this would have made him too big for Cass’ shoulder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://benbalistreri.tumblr.com/post/184118040204/interesting-fact-owl-who-is-a-western-screech|title=Ben Balistreri post|website=Tumblr|accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>
