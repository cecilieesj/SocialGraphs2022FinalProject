'''Ratlin''' is a character in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'']] film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Ratlin serves as one of [[Davy Jones]]' trusted crewmen.

===Physical Appearance===
While many members of the ''Dutchman'' had characteristics of sea creatures, though in Ratlin's case, he is one of the crewmen who served as one of Davy Jones' crew the longest, since his experience on the ''Dutchman'' was part of his biology. While serving onboard the ''Dutchman'', Ratlin was fused with rope, sailcloth, and an entire ship's mast fused into his body while his right foot had the stump of a driftwood.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Ratlin and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Ratlin and the other crew went on it and during this sequence, he held back the motley crew during the negotiations between Jones and Jack.

The next day, Ratlin and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Ratlin remained onboard the ''Dutchman'' while the rest of the crew plans to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as Ratlin fires the cannons to destroy the ''Pearl''. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack. Jack and the ''Pearl'' are later dragged down to [[Davy Jones' Locker]] by the Kraken.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Ratlin returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken.

During battle at the maelstrom, Ratlin and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men while Jack Sparrow fights against Davy Jones. Ratlin, however, survived the battle at the maelstrom, despite being struck by a cannonball and being sent flying backwards behind Davy Jones.

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Ratlin and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==Video game appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|At World's End]]''===
Ratlin appears as a mini-boss, amongst Davy Jones' crewmen multiple times in the game. To defeat him, the player must defeat regular enemies and then use a special ability to defeat him.

==Trivia==
*His name is a play on the word "ratline" - a term used for small ropes attached on ships which are used for climbing like ladders.
