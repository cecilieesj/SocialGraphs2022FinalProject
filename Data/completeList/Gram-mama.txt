'''Gram-mama''' is an arctic shrew who is the late grandmother of [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]] from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Zootopia]]''.

==Background==
Prior to her death, Gram-mama raised Mr. Big as a child, whom he loved and respected dearly. She was responsible for teaching Big the values of respect, determination, and family. Mr. Big's family would grow over time, as he would eventually find love, and have a [[Fru Fru|daughter]], whom he cherishes above all else, declaring her as "the light of his life". When she and Mr. Big lived in Zootopia, the two faced challenges during their lifetime in the New World (now [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] in the present) - mostly when it comes to big animals serving as challenges for rodents where Mr. Big and his grandmother built their own baking industry business where Gram-mama's grandson Mr. Big tells him to be careful of the dangers of big-sized animals living in this area, resulting in challenges for the shrews and other small-sized rodents all across the community for large animals, making life tougher for rodents. To keep her industry growing, Gram-mama offers her grandson to do bakery deliveries. Though Mr. Big had travels doing deliveries by foot, he had no problems doing deliveries done by scooter thanks to his grandmother who helped him to making his grandmother's baking business earn more money and keep her community growing. After Mr. Big made friends with a polar bear cub, Gram-mama's grandson encountered a rhino criminal who threatened his grandmother's baking business, giving a big challenge to Mr. Big ever since he was little. Gram-mama told her grandson to be safe from the enormous criminal but instead of seeking for shelter, Mr. Big called in some neighbors, including the polar bear cub he befriended, and even his grandmother to take on the rhino, successfully dealing with the criminal. This led the rhino being frozen in an ice factory. Afterwards, Mr. Big's community gew throughout his lifetime, followed by [[Little Rodentia]] being built. Gram-mama praises her grandson for helping change the world.

By the present, Gram-mama died of an unknown cause while her memorial shrine was displayed into [[Tundratown]], her resting place. At some point prior to the film, Mr. Big and [[Nick Wilde]] developed a partnership and one that Mr. Big valued, as he saw Nick as family, having invited the latter into his home. Nick was even offered cannoli made by Grandmama. However, this partnership was short-lived, as Nick took advantage of Mr. Big by selling him a very expensive wool rug made from the fur of a skunk's butt. Mr. Big developed a sincere grudge against Nick following this event, as it disrespected the former and his grandmother, who passed away shortly after Nick's betrayal. She was buried in the skunk-butt rug, per Mr. Big's demands.

==Appearances==

===''[[Zootopia]]''===
Mr. Big's grandmother only appears on a memorial shrine during the part where [[Nick Wilde]] and [[Judy Hopps]] encounter [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]] in [[Tundratown]] during their plans to help find [[Mr. Otterton]] to help them solve the case. As Mr. Big talks to Nick about his plan, he tells him that his grandmother was buried in skunk-butt rug per his demands. Seen on Gram-mama's shrine are two red candles standing next to each other.

===''[[Zootopia+]]''===
Gram-mama makes her first physical appearance in animation form, making it the first time she is ever heard talking in the episode "[[The Godfather of the Bride]]", albeit in a flashback sequence. In it, Gram-mama and her grandson Mr. Big were the first to leave for the New World (now [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]]) to build a big community. As Mr. Big and his grandmother set out for the New World, the shrews experienced several problems - mostly when it comes to big animals living in the community serving as challenges for rodents living there as challenges for rodents where Mr. Big and his grandmother build their business in backing where Gram-mama's grandson was involved in her baking business where he gained his jobs in making deliveries. Mr. Big's grandmother tells her grandson to be careful due to their diminutive sizes living in a world where big animals lives, resulting in challenges all across the community fof large animals for shrews, making life tougher for smaller animals like rodents. After his first delivery was a failure, Mr. Big returns to his grandmother who comforts her grandson to and gives him a scooter fit enough for a rodent his size so he can do bakery deliveries without ever having to do it on foot where Mr. Big had no problems doing deliveries via scooter without ever having to walk, causing Gram-mama's baking business to earn more money and keep her community growing. 

When Mr. Big makes new friends with a polar bear cub, he faces another challenge: enormous criminals that are bigger than his size, which his grandmother tells her grandson to seek for safety. Instead of following what her grandmother tells him to do, Mr. Big instead takes on the rhino criminal to his determination and tenacity in order to deal with the criminal which some neighbors, the polar bear cub, and Gram-mama herself were able to take on the criminal. This eventually led the rhino frozen in an ice factory. Afterwards, Mr. Big's community grew throughout his lifetime with [[Little Rodentia]] being built, which Gram-mama praises her grandson for helping change the world.
