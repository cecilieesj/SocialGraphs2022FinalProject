The '''Woodsman''' is a minor antagonist in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series,Â ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. His role is mainly to cut down trees throughout [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]]. He tried to cut down the [[Magic Gnome]]'s tree, but was stopped by [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]] after seeing how big he had become. Next, he cut down a tree near a bridge and the tree fell down destroying the bridge. Then recently, he tried to cut down Old Knotty so a new road can go from the king's castle directly to the lake, but it too came to a halt when the residents of the forest protested the cutting of the tree. It was [[Prince Charming (Goldie and Bear)|Prince Charming]] who came and put an end to the protests by changing the road plan. Instead of going straight through the tree's location, it would go around the tree.
