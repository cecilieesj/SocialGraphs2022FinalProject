==Background==

=== Personality ===
Authoritarian and quick-tempered, the scrappy Lord Dingwall doesn't let being height-challenged get in the way of solving his problems with fisticuffs. Never one to shy away from an old-fashioned fracas or high spirited kerfuffle, he has no qualms talking on even the burliest adversary to assert his own position in the kingdom. But he has still has a nicer side.

==Trivia==

*While King Fergus and Lords Macintosh and MacGuffin all appear to be around the same age, Lord Dingwall looks noticeably older than they do. If this is true, he may have been the first of the four of them to have children.
**If he wasn't the first of them to have children (but is still older than them), it's possible that he didn't start having children until at a much later point his life. This would make some sense, since during the time period that the movie takes place in, women and girls generally got married and had children are much younger ages compared to men and boys of that same time period (and were typically married off to men who were much older than them).
*While he declared Young Dingwall to be "[his] ''only'' son," its unknown if this means that Young Dingwall is an only child (meaning that he has no siblings).
