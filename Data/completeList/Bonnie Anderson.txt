'''Bonnie Anderson''' is a major character in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], first introduced in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. She is a young girl who becomes the owner of [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], and the rest of [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys after [[Andy Davis|Andy]] heads off for college.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Bonnie is a 4-year-old brunette girl who wears a pink tutu. She goes to [[Sunnyside Daycare]], where she is the daughter of the [[Mrs. Anderson|receptionist]]. Even though Bonnie has an active imagination when playing with her toys (similar to [[Andy Davis|Andy]]), she is shy, quiet, and withdrawn when around adults.

Bonnie is first seen sitting on the front desk at Sunnyside Daycare, holding the [[The Monkey|Monkey]] in her hand, wanting to see what [[Mrs. Davis]] (her mother's friend and Andy's mother) is donating. However, when her mother closes the box flap, she slumps and pouts in disappointment. Later, she finds [[Woody]] hanging by his pull-string from a tree, and she takes him [[Bonnie's House|home]] to meet her very own toys: [[Mr. Pricklepants]], [[Trixie]], [[Buttercup]], [[Dolly]], [[Peas-in-a-Pod]], [[Totoro]], and [[Chuckles the Clown]]. When Woody goes back to rescue his friends, he puts himself away in Bonnie's backpack.

She is not seen again until at the end of the film when she was playing with her toys in her front yard when [[Andy Davis|Andy]] stops at her house to donate his old toys - [[Jessie]], [[Bullseye]], [[Rex]], [[Mr. Potato Head|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog]], [[Hamm]], the [[Little Green Men Store Command|Aliens]], and [[Buzz Lightyear]] - to Bonnie, Woody having left a note on the box containing the others. Upon seeing Woody - who had sneaked into the box after Andy packed - she turns to grab him, but Andy pulls Woody away, which gives Bonnie a sad look on her face. After seeing how Bonnie loves Woody as much as he does, Andy relents and gives Woody to her, and they play with their toys before Andy finally leaves for college. She is last seen when she is taken into her house by her mother for lunch, leaving the toys to watch Andy's car disappear down the road.

In the closing credits, it is revealed that Bonnie has made drawings for her toys, including the ones handed over from Andy. She also has drawn Chuckles' smile right, the sight of which makes Chuckles smile for the first time ever since.

===''[[Toy Story Toons]]''===
In "[[Hawaiian Vacation]]", Bonnie briefly appears in which she says, "I'm going on vacation," as she bursts into her room, quickly grabs her suitcase from the closet, and rushes out of the room, leaving behind her book bag that, unknown to her, contains [[Ken]] and [[Barbie]]. Ken despaired as Bonnie and her family drove off to [[Hawaii]].

In "[[Small Fry]]", Bonnie and her mother eat at [[Poultry Palace]]. Bonnie was upset that she got a Zurg Belt Buckle in her Fun Meal and requested it is exchanged for a [[Fun Meal Buzz Lightyear|Mini-Buzz]]. However, the cashier explained that they are out of Mini-Buzzes and the one on display is not for sale. Bonnie then went to play in the ball pit with [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] and [[Rex]], imagining she was sliding into hot lava. As her mother told her they were leaving, Bonnie was unaware that Mini-Buzz had switched places with her Buzz.

In "[[Partysaurus Rex]]", Bonnie takes Rex to play in the tub with her bath toys, pretending that Rex was a vicious sea monster. But the fun did not last when her mother turned off the water, drained the tub, and wrapped her in a towel to take her to dinner at her grandmother's.

===''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''===
While on the road with her mother, in the center of the trip, Bonnie, who was in the car, yawns and sleepily asks her mother if they are at their destination, but she said they will not be at Grandma's for a few more hours, so she tells her to go back to sleep. Suddenly, one of the car's tires blows out, forcing Bonnie and her mother to pull over into the [[Sleep Well|Sleep Well motel]]. Upon learning the tow truck will not come until morning, they are forced to stay the night. While they slept, Bonnie's toys leave her suitcase, only to be captured one-by-one by [[Ronald Tompkins]]' pet iguana, [[Mr. Jones]]. When her toys were found, she gives [[Jessie]] a hug.

The next morning, as they were checking out, Bonnie noticed the curtain behind Ronald's desk being pulled back, seeing Bonnie's missing toys. She quickly collects them and she and her mother leave the motel after her mother reports Ronald to the police.

===''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''===
Two days after Christmas, Bonnie plays out a variety of roles with her toys, but unhappily for Trixie, she does not play with her as a real dinosaur instead of choosing to play with [[Angel Kitty]] as a Kittysaurus. Afterward, she collects Woody, Buzz, Rex, Trixie, and Angel Kitty for her playdate with her friend [[Mason]]. Upon arriving, she finds Mason playing his new Optimum X game console and he invites her to play, prompting Bonnie to toss her backpack with her toys into Mason's room.

Unknown to Bonnie, her toys encounter Mason's new Battlesaurs, who are unaware they are toys because Mason was fixated on the Optimum X and thus sought to kill Woody and Buzz. Trixie goes for the Optimum X's power switch to get Bonnie and Mason's attention off of it. With the game turned off, Mason goes for the power switch, only to find [[Reptillus Maximus]] instead. Upon spotting the Battlesaur, Bonnie begins to play with him, prompting Mason to join her and they spend the rest of the afternoon playing with their toys. Afterward, Bonnie collects her toys and returns home as her mother plans on bringing her back next Tuesday at around 3:30 PM.

===''[[Toy Story 4]]''===
Bonnie appears in ''Toy Story 4'' as she is about to enter kindergarten. By this time, despite Bonnie's promise to Andy, she has begun actively neglecting Woody, to the point where she removes his badge and appoints Jessie as her "sheriff". Despite her neglect, Woody still does his best to ensure Bonnie is happy. On the day of her kindergarten orientation, Bonnie is busy playing with her toys when her father enters and tells her to get ready for kindergarten. Bonnie is nervous about going and asks if she can bring a toy with her but her father says she can't. Bonnie leaves the rooms but then returns and starts sobbing, which Woody sees. Unable to see his new owner unhappy, Woody sneaks into Bonnie's backpack to ensure she has a good time. Bonnie's parents come to her and encourage her to go and she leaves the room with them and Woody. When she arrives at kindergarten, Bonnie is extremly shy around everyone. With Woody's secret help, she creates [[Forky]], a homemade toy made out of a spork and craft projects, who quickly becomes her favorite toy and instantly cheers her up. At bedtime, after Forky once again jumps into a wastebasket near Bonnie's bed, Woody climbs up to put him back on her pillow, only to make Bonnie grab him and pull him close to her sleeping face, which makes Woody feel a bit good inside.

Bonnie brings her entire toy collection along with her on her family RV vacation, during which Forky, who is suffering from an existential crisis, abandons her. She ultimately cries when she finds that Forky is gone, and makes constant frantic efforts throughout the film to find him. As her and her parents' efforts to find Forky fail, Bonnie becomes increasingly inconsolable, until they finally find him along with her backpack at the Second Chance Antique Shop. Later that evening, her toys help Bonnie's father return to the park through Trixie's secret GPS to return to the carnival to rescue Woody, though he decides not to return to Bonnie.

In a mid-credits scene, Bonnie has entered first grade and Jessie introduces a crafted knife figure named Knifey, with whom Forky falls in love.

===Other appearances===
In the [[2020]] Pixar film, ''[[Onward]]'', one of the satyrs seen in the beginning of the film resembles Bonnie.

==Trivia==
*Bonnie lives at [[Bonnie's House|1225 Sycamore Street]], which is right around the corner from [[Andy's House|Andy's house]].
*Bonnie taking [[Woody]] to her tea party seems to echo [[Hannah Phillips|Hannah]] borrowing Buzz for a tea party in the first ''[[Toy Story]]'', except for Bonnie's toys all had their heads, as opposed to Hannah's.
*When [[Andy Davis|Andy]] stops at her house, she is seen playing with her toys but is interrupted when she catches sight of Andy. This mirrors one of the home videos [[Mrs. Davis|Andy's mother]] has made at the beginning of the film when young Andy is interrupted by her entry while playing with his toys.
**Two other instances of this are Bonnie tossing herself onto her bed and hugging her toys and Woody in her arms, and at the end of the film, when Andy plays with his toys one last time during his visit at Bonnie's, Bonnie makes Woody and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] high-five each other. Both of these recalls two other of the home videos of young Andy at the beginning of the film.
*Bonnie is named after U.S. actress [[Bonnie Hunt]] (which she also voiced [[Sally Carrera]] in the [[Cars (franchise)|Cars]] trilogy), who voices [[Dolly|one of her toys]], and [[Darla K. Anderson]] (last name), the producer of ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.
