==Appearances==
===Marvel Animated Universe===
====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
Miles Morales' name and picture appear in the episode "I Am Spider-Man" on a list of understudies for the part of Spider-Man in Phil Coulson's high school play. He is the second to last choice, while Peter Parker is the last choice. In May 2014, the Sunday badge for the 2014 New York Comic Con was revealed, featuring the third season title Ultimate Spider-Man: Web-Warriors, and showing various incarnations of Spider-Man, including one wearing Miles Morales' costume. Web Warriors is a third season storyline in which Peter Parker travels through various parallel universes and encounters those dimensions' versions of Spider-Man, including Miles Morales.

Miles eventually appears in Parts 3 and 4 of the Spider-Verse arc, which involves him teaming up with Spider-Man and other incarnations of Spiders to defeat a dimension-hopping [[Green Goblin]].

In the episode "Miles from Home", Miles had a brief fight with his Green Goblin while getting his mother Rio (who in this reality knows Miles is Spider-Man) a birthday cake. However, Baron Mordo helps Doctor Octopus bring the Green Goblin of Miles' universe to combat his Spider-Man, and Peter brings Miles to assist him. Their fight results in Miles getting stuck in Peter's reality. Doctor Strange opened a temporal window so that Miles could let his mother know that he's all right and he will find a way back to her. Spider-Man then took Miles to the Triskelion where he met Agent Venom, Iron Spider, and Scarlet Spider. It was decided that he would live there for the time being until they would find a way to bring Miles back to his own dimension.

In the episode "Iron Vulture", Spider-Man, Miles Morales, and Agent Venom defeated Batroc the Leaper. Later on, Miles meets Harry Osborn and Norman Osborn before they are attacked by Vulture and Doctor Octopus. Due to a name by Doctor Octopus, Miles Morales uses the alias of Kid Arachnid as he helps Spider-Man and Norman Osborn in his Iron Patriot armor defeat Doctor Octopus and Vulture.

Miles helps Peter in the Return to the Spider-Verse arc, where they track the shards of the Siege Perilous to prevent the destruction of the Multiverse. They encounter several alternate Spider-people while being by a villain called Wolf Spider, who is an evil version of Peter that seeks to rule the multiverse. In the final part, Miles returns to his home dimension where he reunites with his mother and finds he was succeeded by Gwen Stacy. After a battle with Wolf Spider, where he and the other spiders were saved by Peter, the Siege Perilous was complete. Miles decides to go back to Peter's universe with his mother choosing to go with him so they'll be together.

====''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''====
Miles Morales is introduced as a student from [[Horizon High]], alongside [[Spider-Girl (Anya Corazon)|Anya Corazon]]. Unlike the comics, he is a robotics expert, having even built an assistance robot with his voice. Later, when a Spider-Slayer infiltrates the school to steal experimental tech (that were pumpkin bombs built by [[Harry Osborn]]), Spider-Man webs up an unsuspecting Miles to protect him from harm. Later in the series, Miles accidentally bumps into Spencer Smythe, knocking a briefcase out of his hand. The briefcase contained the experimental spiders from Oscorp Labs. Like Peter Parker, one of these spiders bites Miles, and he ends up gaining spider-like powers the same as Peter had. Excited by this, Miles makes his own Spider-Man costume, which is black and red and hustles Peter into his dormitory to tell him the secret. Peter is surprised that Miles has his powers, and attempts to discourage Miles from fighting crime like Spider-Man/him, as to keep him from putting himself in harm's way. Miles is annoyed that Peter doesn't believe in him, and attempts to prove himself. However, he is being trailed by Spencer Smythe and Alistair Smythe, both piloting large Spider-Slayer robots, but are against each other. They begin fighting each other in Miles' neighborhood, causing collateral damage and putting Miles' father, Jefferson, at risk. Both Spider-Men attempt to fight off both Smythes to protect Jefferson.

===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''====
Whilst he doesn't appear, Miles is briefly alluded to when his uncle Aaron Davis claims to have a nephew he wants to protect.

====''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''====
Although he doesn't appear, Miles Morales is indirectly referenced in the film. [[Electro]] tells [[The Amazing Spider-Man|the Spider-Man from his universe]] he thought he would be black and "that there must be a black Spider-Man out there, somewhere."

==Disney Parks==
===[[Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure]]===
In W.E.B.'s headquarters is a locker belonging to Miles with artwork on it made to resemble the art which Miles makes in the hit Sony animated film ''Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'' (2018). Outside of the ride building is a mural signed by Miles which is used for meet 'n' greets with Peter's Spider-Man.

==Trivia==
*In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', Miles' decision to become his dimension's Spider-Man after the death of his Peter Parker was lifted from the comics. The only difference between this version and comic Miles is that his mother Rio knows he's Spider-Man and supports his actions, whereas the canon version didn't know Miles was Spider-Man until her death, but she was resurrected and her knowledge was retconned (though Miles' father, Jefferson Davis, knew).
**This version's Jefferson Davis is hinted to be deceased when Rio referred to him in "Miles from Home". It is further implied in "Return to Spider-Verse Part 4" when Rio claims that Miles is the only family she has left.
**This is later reinforced in the Sony Game Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which in that universe's his father died the same way T'Challa's did (explosion in a government focus building.) He later become Peter Parker's apprentice/partner.
**Nadji Jeter later voiced him in that game.
*While Miles originally belonged to the Ultimate Universe, after the ''Secret Wars'' event in [[2015]], he started living in the main universe after surviving the final Incursion in which both his and the main universes destroyed each other.
*Miles' first voice actor, [[Donald Glover]], was one of the original inspirations for Miles' character from his unsuccessful attempt to be cast as the lead in the [[2012]] ''Amazing Spider-Man'' reboot.
**Donald Glover later appeared in the second reboot in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' as Miles' uncle. A deleted scene showed Glover's character on the phone to his nephew.
*Miles is the main protagonist in the CGI-animated movie ''Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'', released in [[2018]], voiced by Shameik Moore. However, this is purely a Sony production and is not produced or distributed by Marvel Studios.
