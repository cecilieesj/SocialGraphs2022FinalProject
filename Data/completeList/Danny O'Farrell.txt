'''Danny O'Farrell'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0073826/filmoseries#tt0337761</ref> (mostly referred to as '''O'Farrell''') is a Safety Patroller who's main duty is crime scene photographer. O'Farrell is more the comic relief of the show due to his comical actions and comments, he tends to show lack of intelligence towards most situations, however, he does have an big imagination and is able to produce certain knowledge about different topics such as DIY photography. He is voiced by [[wikipedia:Kyle Sullivan|Kyle Sullivan]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838202/</ref><ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Danny-OFarrell/</ref>


==History==
Not much is known about O'Farrell's history as he tends to be more of a background character (although he's still considered to be more prominent than Joseph and Karen). It is unknown how O'Farrell managed to get inducted into the Safety Patrol (although it could be because of his photography skills) as during missions he tends to be rather clumsy and for some reasons, can be more of a hinder than a help to the team (even being unable to take photos of a model train wreck crime scene due to the sight made him sick). The frequent running joke with him is that he shouldn't be qualified for the Safety Patrol, as [[Horatio Vallejo|Vallejo]] stated, and was once replaced by a tripod. Another joke from another episode is that "he isn't qualified to operate a stapler." O'Farrell also has the tendency to over-exaggerate in various situations such as when he attempted to apply as a dance partner in <ref>''The Currency of Doubt''</ref>. Sometimes he tends to vex others, has deep introspection and weird ideas, such as trying to take pics of his own behind <ref>(A Cold Day at X)</ref>. He is of Irish or Scottish descent, as his name, ginger hair and the fact that he's seen wearing a kilt in one episode <ref>(A Dark Score Evened)</ref> indicate.
