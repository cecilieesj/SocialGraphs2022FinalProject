}}'''Francois''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2001]] film, ''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]'', sequel to the [[Lady and the Tramp|1955 film]]. He is one of the members of the junkyard dogs.

==Background==
===Physical Description===
Francois is the smallest of the junkyard dogs. His appearance is more like a {{WikipediaLink|Boston Terrier}}, but he has a [[France|French]] accent (hence his name), which makes his character even more funny and adorable.

===Personality===
Francois is rambunctious and often gets into mischief, such as getting electrically shocked. He also likes ripping apart chicken skin and doesn't like being perfumed. He has a bit of a snobbish attitude, but isn't above congratulating [[Scamp]] on his heroic actions with unusual kisses on his cheeks. He accidentally managed to get Scamp captured by [[the Dogcatcher]] and taken to [[Dog Pound|the pound]], with no thanks to [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]] who was responsible for that accident by using his own member as bait. Francois even showed guilt and remorse for unwillingly leading Scamp into trouble. He eventually leaves the junkyard with the other junkyard dogs,Â minus Buster, and gets adopted by a family.

==Trivia==
*Francois' name is equivalent to [[Francis]] in ''[[Oliver & Company]]''.
