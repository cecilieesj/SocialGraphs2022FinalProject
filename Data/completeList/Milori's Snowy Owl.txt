==History==
Because the Winter Lord's damaged wings prevent him from flying on his own, a proud Snowy Owl lends his wings to the lord so he can fly around the Winter Woods; along with it's strength as they do what they can to keep the woods and it's fairies safe. It is possible that the feathers that Milori wears as his cloak, to cover his injury, are from his friend.

The owl also scouts the woods and alerts Milori when Winter or warm fairies cross the Border. Milori's owl is also shown to be the general of the wood's Snowy Owls when it lead a group of owls to Pixie Hollow's three other season realms, so the Frost-Talent fairies can save the Pixie Dust Tree.

==Trivia==
*It's possible that the owl was trained by [[Sled]] or any of the other Animal Winter-Talent fairies.
*Some think that the snowy owl is male.
