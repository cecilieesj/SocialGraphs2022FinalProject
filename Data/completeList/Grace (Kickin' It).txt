'''Grace''' is a character and antagonist who has been seen in two episodes of ''[[Kickin' It]]'' so far. She is portrayed by Grace O'Doherty.

==Background==
Grace was mentioned in Ricky Weaver and had one scene. She likes Ricky Weaver almost as much as Kim did. It is unknown if she still likes Ricky or knows about his history with girls.
She was seen in My Left Foot as the captain of the pep squad. Eddie desperately wanted to date her, and she only said yes when he "almost died" asking her out.

==Relationships==
*'''Kim''' - Many people believe Grace is Kim's only female friend but there isn't much proof they are friends. Grace made sure the Wasabi Warriors saw Kim's "Ricky Shrine" which Kim desperately wanted to keep from them. Also, during My Left Foot, Grace did not want Kim on the pep squad. Kim and Jerry only made the squad because they knew Milton. Their relationship is unknown. They could be considered "frenemies". Kim does have Grace's number, and in Ricky Weaver it is shown that they talk and hang out at school.

*'''Jerry''' - Grace was partners with Jerry for a "baby egg" project. They most likley failed considering Jerry ate their "child". She would only let Jerry join the pepsquad when he knew Milton and got rid of his arm pit hair.

*'''Eddie''' - She was the one who Eddie wanted to ask out. During lunch, he tried to ask her out, but she rejected him. Then on the night of the football game, when Milton scored the kick, and Eddie was managing the scoreboard, he tried asking her out. He fell while doing so, but because he "almost died" doing so, she said yes to him, making Grace Eddie's love interest.
