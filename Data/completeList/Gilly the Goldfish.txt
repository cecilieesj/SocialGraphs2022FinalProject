==Role in the series==
Gilly first appeared in the first season episode "[[Cubby's Goldfish]]", where Cubby began to show his precious pet to [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]], [[Izzy]], and [[Skully]]. The small pirate team is not the only one to enjoy Gilly and her tricks: [[Captain Hook]] swipes the fish away from the sea pups for his own fish tank, causing [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew to pursue the greedy captain to recover Cubby's beloved pet.

Gilly returns in the special ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Jake Saves Bucky]]'', but unlike her first appearance where she was in a fishbowl, Gilly was freely swimming through the Never Sea. She appeared during the hunt for the second clue of the Great Never Race between [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] and the [[The Jolly Roger|''Jolly Roger'']].
