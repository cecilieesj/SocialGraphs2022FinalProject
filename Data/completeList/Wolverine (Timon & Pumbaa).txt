|quote = }}The '''Wolverine''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series. He makes his first and only appearance in the episode "[[I Think I Canada]]".

==Background==
===Personality===
The wolverine appears to be carnivorous. He enrolls [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] to his ''Survival of the Fittest'' training camp so that they can lose weight for him to be able to eat them more easily.

===Physical description===
The wolverine appears to be dark brown with red hair and a long red and yellow stripe on his back.

==Role in the series==
While Timon and Pumbaa are relaxing, talking about their ways of eating bugs, the wolverine shows up and chases the two. When Timon and Pumbaa end up at a dead end cliff, Timon suggests that they let him eat them. The wolverine then enrolls Timon and Pumbaa to his Survival of the Fittest training camp. Pumbaa wants to join, but Timon refuses, so he makes himself and his friend leave. The wolverine stops them and makes Timon reconsider.

The Wolverine takes Timon and Pumbaa to his training camp. He first makes Timon and Pumbaa step on a scale, then shaves their hairs (and the bushy part of Pumbaa's tail) and puts helmets on the two's heads.

The Wolverine gives Timon and Pumbaa five steps on how to be fit. First step: Remove the fat, second step: Exercise, third step: Drink cabo soy tofu protein muscle building non-dairy rehydratedÂ milk less milkshakes, fourth step: The Massage-O-Matic, and the fifth and final step: The Maze of Challenges.

Timon first volunteers for the Maze of Challenges, When the Wolverine blows the whistle, the meerkat just erases the "Start" line and writes "Finish" on the other side of the line and then lies down. It's now Pumbaa's turn and the warthog passes all the obstacles in the maze and succeeds. The Wolverine then tells him that the final step of the program is for him to eat him.

Pumbaa runs back to Timon and while the Wolverine chases him, he gets caught by all the obstacles. He then gets tired.
