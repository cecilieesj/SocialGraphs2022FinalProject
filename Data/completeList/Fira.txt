Fira is a light-talent fairy and she is good friends with [[Iridessa]], Luna, and [[Beck (Disney Fairies)|Beck]].

Fira can illuminate the entire Home Tree with her glow and she's the star of the fairies' light show. Her job is to make sure [[Pixie Hollow]] is well-lit in the evenings to provide light for celebrations, and to make sure that the mining fairies have light during their monthly visits to the mines. She is in charge of the other light-talents and delegates most of the tasks well.
