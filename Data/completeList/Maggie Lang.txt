Margaret Lang is the former wife of Scott Lang, they both have a daughter named Cassie. After VistaCorp incident and the subsequent arrest of Lang, Maggie decided to divorce him to give a quieter life to her daughter. While Lang was serving his sentence, she engaged with a police officer, Jim Paxton.

In 2015, Scott went to the birthday party of her daughter to give a gift; Cassie excited, told her mother about the arrival of her father. This information, caused Maggie choked on his drink. Maggie then faced Scott and told him he could not be there as he did not have a stable job. That same night, Cassie asked her if her father was a bad person she replied that he was just confused.

A few days later, she, Cassie, and Paxton shared a nice dinner in which Cassie wanted that the police did not find her father. When Darren Cross infiltrated at Maggie's house, Maggie called the police to come and help her as Cross had taken Cassie as a hostage. Days later, Paxton invited Scott to dinner along with Cassie and Maggie, due to the good actions performed by Lang. However, the dinner was interrupted by a call from Luis, who wanted to report something important to Scott.

*She is called "Peggy" in the comics, but it was changed to "Maggie Lang" to avoid confusion with [[Peggy Carter]]. This change turns out to be minor since in both cases her full name is "Margaret".
