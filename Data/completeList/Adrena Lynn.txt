'''Adrena Lynn''' is a villainess featured in the television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''.

==Background==
Adrena Lynn was a TV teen action star who specialized in "extreme" death-defying stunts. She also seems to like using the word "freaky" in sentences (she puts emphasis on the eaky, but not the fr). However, it is possible that the experience was a key element in Dr. Possible being distrustful of "show folk" and celebrities, particularly after Kim's brothers, Jim and Tim, were both injured in an hamfisted attempt to replicate one of her stunts. In reality, she faked all of her stunts, and was exposed by [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] when Kim tried to save Lynn from a failed bungee jump stunt, only to discover Lynn didn't do the stunt at all and was using a stuffed stunt-double dummy. It was really Ron, who exposed her to the press as being a "FAKE", resulting in her show being cancelled. Adrena Lynn attempted to get revenge on Kim. Lynn learns about Kim dating a football player named Brick Flagg (actually, a fake story Ron made up to get himself on the papers for Middleton High) and kidnaps him, taking him to the abandoned Middleton Fairgrounds and tying him on a coaster. Even after Ron confessed that he was the one responsible for exposing her as fake and her show getting canceled, and he made the whole Brick thing up, Lynn just shrugs it off.

Lynn was eventually was defeated and sent off to jail after a death-defying battle at an abandoned circus that ended with Adrena Lynn being exposed once again like a coward.

===Personality===
Adrena Lynn has a hard character, an extreme form of a bad and powerful girl. She adores the danger and tries to take it to extremes. In reality, she's a very cowardly person (if brave enough to take on Kim Possible), having faked every extreme stunt in her career.

===Adrena Lynn as a major villain===
Adrena Lynn was originally supposed to be a major villain. She was put in many of the show's promotional images and was one of the villains' fans who were allowed to e-mail on the DisneyChannel.com/KimPossible website (before [[2007]]). However, she did not prove to be popular enough with audiences and was written out of the series as a result. Her only other appearances were in the video game Global Gemini for the Nintendo DS and a cameo in the end credits of "[[Graduation|Graduation Part 2]]".

==Trivia==
*Her name is a play on the word "adrenaline", which is a hormone in the body that would be produced in response to extreme stress.
*Much like Motor Ed, she has her own catchphrase. While Motor Ed says "seriously", Adrena Lynn says "freaky."
