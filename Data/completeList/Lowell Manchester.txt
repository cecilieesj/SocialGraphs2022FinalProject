'''Lowell Manchester''' is the husband of [[Margaret Kingsleigh]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2010]] film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

== Role in the film ==
Lowell first appeared when [[Alice]] caught him cheating on his wife Margaret (Alice's sister) with his partner Hattie. Lowell tried to convince Alice to not tell Margaret as that would only ruin their marriage. Alice is confused on whether or not to tell her, but before she can decide, she is dragged off. At the end of the film, Alice returns to the engagement party with a new confidence, where she turns down Hamish's marriage proposal and she silently tells Lowell that she won't tell Margaret about his infidelity, but she will be watching him.
