==Appearance==
Skittles is a small penguin with a white bow on her head. She has big eyes, a small beak and "hair" on the back of her head.

==Role==
When [[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Launchpad McQuack]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] are imprisoned in Antarctica by a penguin army, [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] and [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] meet up with Skittles. She agrees to help them break their friends out when Webby gives her a scarf, which she loves because it has so many colors, as everything around her is white snow and ice.

She helps Webby get around the museum by disguising her as a penguin. The two canâ€™t get the map out due to being encased in ice, but they manage to draw a copy with colorful crayons

==Trivia==
*Her name may be a parody to a brand of fruit-flavored sweets of the [[Wikipedia:Skittles (confectionery)|same name]], given her kind nature.
