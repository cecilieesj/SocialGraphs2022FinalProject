'''Fiona Ashbury''' is a ''[[Fillmore!]]'' character, a [[X Middle School]]Â student, and president of the Fashion Club.

==Background==
===Personality===

As Becca's boss, Fiona uses and abuses her position to domineer over her more than she should. She's also very mean-spirited and overly hard on Becca, not thinking of how her words can affect her, and is insensitive to Becca's feelings. Since she has much responsibility to the Fashion Club, she's always self-absorbed with organizing the goings-on of it and running it. All of this stresses her out and makes her exasperated easily.

===Physical Appearance===
Fiona is an Afro-American girl with long, brown hair that extends slightly passed the shoulders and brown eyes. She wears a gold choker necklace, byzantine jacket, lavender blouse, blue jeans, and purple sandals.

==A Dark Score Evened==
As seen in "[[A Dark Score Evened]]", Fiona was depicted as a bully to her fashion assistant, [[Becca Embarcadero]]. She was upset with Becca, due to the subpar job the latter did with the fashion design on a mannequin, which wore a halter top with capri pants. She gave Becca a hard time about it and scolded her severely. [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] approached Fiona to inquire her concerning a clue they found, but she couldn't be bothered with that as she had a fall fashion line-up to prepare and told them that in lieu of her, they'd have to talk to Becca. In the middle of the interrogation, Fiona screamed after grape jam blew up on her and her models, exclaiming that she hates jam. The two Safety Patrollers spotted somebody dressed like a ninja committing the act, went after, and attempted to stop the suspect, but the suspect managed to escape them. From his observation of Fiona, Fillmore pointed out that she used a different method for bullying, which was verbal abuse rather than physical abuse. When Fillmore and Ingrid saw Becca again for another interrogation, she told them that she was now responsible alone for handling the fashion show, as Fiona fell ill. The stress of it all may had been tremendous enough for her to consider transferring schools, as Becca mentioned.
