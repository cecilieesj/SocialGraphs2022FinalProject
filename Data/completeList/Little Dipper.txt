'''Little Dipper''' is one of [[Dottie]] and [[Dipstick]]'s puppies together with [[Oddball]] and [[Domino]] in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]''. His spots are immaculately patterned to the constellation "Little Dipper", thus giving him his name (this is not official, though, and he is claimed to be named this since he has similar spots to his father's, as well as a black tip on his tail). He also has a blue collar (both in cartoon and live-action) like his father, Dipstick, and his brother, Domino.

==Appearances==
===''[[102 Dalmatians]]''===
Little Dipper first appears as a newborn puppy along with [[Oddball]] and [[Domino]]. He is later seen when Oddball attempts to get "spots" from a wet black inkjet copier, after she notices that she doesn't have any spots, when she is suddenly flung out the window, but is seen hanging on to the windowsill. Little Dipper and Domino go out and try to save her, to which they succeed. Little Dipper is later shown when [[Kevin Shepherd|Kevin]] and [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] go on a date and he and his family are left watching TV. [[Jean-Pierre Le Pelt]] then kidnaps him, his siblings, and his mother. Little Dipper is not shown for the rest of the movie, but makes a small appearance at the end of the film with Domino.

===''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''===
Despite being one of Dipstick and Dottie's pups, Little Dipper does not appear in the video game, ''102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue''. However, he did appear in the Game Boy Color version at the start of the game and at the end as the puppy filling up the screen.

==Trivia==
*Like [[Domino]], some of his cliparts are inconsistent. Some feature him wearing a red collar, some feature him with a blue collar, and some feature him with white paws that contradict other cliparts.
