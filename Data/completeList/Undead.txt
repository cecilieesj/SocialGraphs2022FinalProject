'''The Undead''' are menacing paranormal creatures that were summoned in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

==Background==
Originally, [[Journal 3]] stated that the Undead has no weakness, but written in invisible ink, it states that it is possible to defeat them with a three-point harmony that can shatter their skulls and return them to dead. As zombies, the Undead can infect the living with a bite and transform them into other zombies. Due to their pale skin and bad attitudes, they are often mistaken for teenagers. They seem to have a hunger for brains.

According to the "Creature #6" next to the species' name, they are implied to be the sixth creature to be written about in the book.

There is a cure for those who were infected by the Undead's bite which involves cinnamon and formaldehyde.

==Role in the series==
The Undead was mentioned in the first episode "[[Tourist Trapped]]", where they were described to look a bit like teenage boys. 

In "[[Scary-oke]]", [[Dipper Pines]] accidentally summons a hoard of them to prove the Federal Agents that his Journal is real. Several of the zombies drag the agents away into the woods before attacking the [[The Mystery Shack|Mystery Shack]] and infect [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]], turning him into one of their own. When the zombies' weakness is discovered, Dipper, [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], and [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]] sing a court song and destroy the zombie hoard.

In "[[Weirdmageddon Part 3: Take Back the Falls]]", several zombies, including the late [[Mayor of Gravity Falls]], try to rise from the graveyard behind the Valentino family's funeral home, but the Valentino couple suppress them back into their graves.
