The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. arrive at a mall where they see Deathlok attacking a girl. Later it is revealed that girl was Super Skrull. Aware of the Skrull invasion, Deathlok and Hulk infiltrate in the base of the Skrulls. In this place, they find Super Skrull who fights against them. The Skrulls are defeated when Deathlok exploits its base.

Super Skrull and others Skrulls are encountered on another planet by the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. where they make a plan to use the gamma energy of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. but eventually were defeated by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.
