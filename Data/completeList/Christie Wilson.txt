Her right-hand girl, [[Candi Brunschwegger|Candi]], is only slightly less cruel. In the film[[Carver Descartes| Carver's]] Media, she is portrayed as the epitome of all evil (at least in Carver's mind). In this episode "[[Makeover (The Weekenders)|Makeover]]", she and Candi gave Lor a new makeover.
