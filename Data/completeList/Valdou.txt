==History==
He was [[Rei|Prince Rei]]'s bodyguard but betrayed him to take over the kingdom [[Paradiso]]. By brainwashing the inhabitants and destroying the kingdom's glory, he had it all in his grasp. Though Rei lost his memory, they set on a journey to find the savior - the princess who is meant to salvage the kingdom with the [[Magic Tiara]]. Valdou, however, plans on using the opportunity to find and kill the princess to keep the kingdom the way it is.

Near the end, it is revealed that he is a robotic humanoid, though whether he was always one or was once a human who modified himself is unknown. The princess, [[Kilala Reno]], frees the kingdom's inhabitants from Valdou's control and helps create a battalion against Valdou's army of humanoid robots. He is killed by Rei in the end in a fit of rage when he (Rei) believed Valdou killed Kilala in a fire.
