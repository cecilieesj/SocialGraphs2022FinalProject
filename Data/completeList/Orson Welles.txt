At one point he invited [[Walt Disney]] to collaborate with him on a film version of ''The Little Prince'' by Antoine De-Sainte Exupery, which would be half live-action and half animated. Disney, however, was reluctant to work with Welles, given his reputation for being difficult to work with. According to Welles, Disney stormed out of a meeting shouting "There is not room on this lot for two geniuses."

His only role in a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-related production was portraying Lew Lord in ''[[w:c:muppets:The Muppet Movie|The Muppet Movie]]''. He was played by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] and voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the [[1994]] film, ''[[Ed Wood]]'', and by Angus Macfadyen in the [[1999]] [[Touchstone Pictures]] film, ''{{WikipediaLink|Cradle Will Rock}}''.
