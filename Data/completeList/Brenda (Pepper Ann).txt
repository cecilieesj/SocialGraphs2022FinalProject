'''Brenda''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is an old friend of [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]]'s who has fond memories of her time with her at camp, yet still displays a very childish attitude.

==Background==
Brenda is [[Pepper Ann Pearson]]'s bunk mate from Cubby Camp who first appears in "[[Old Best Friend]]" where she comes to visit her. When Brenda arrives, it is apparent that the two of them share absolutely nothing in common; Pepper Ann is down to earth while Brenda is easily excitable, childish and, at a glance, clingy. Brenda seems slightly unaware of Pepper Ann's sudden distaste of being around her, however in a twist, it is revealed that Brenda believes that Pepper Ann has not changed and politely ends their friendship, much to her confusion and sadness.

Brenda reappears, in spirit form, in "[[A Valentine's Day Tune]]" as the Spirit of Valentine's Day Present. She reveals to Pepper Ann all the things [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]], [[Nicky Little|Nicky]], [[Milo Kamalani|Milo]] and [[Craig Bean|Craig]] have done to make her feel happy on the day.

===Personality===
Brenda is loud, obnoxious, flowery, excitable, care-free and childish; basically everything Pepper Ann finds appalling. She barely finds a dull moment for herself and is always taking part in some odd hobby. She does however tend to turn down other people's interests for her own, implying that she is a little selfish. Despite all this, Brenda does display some self-awareness as she was convinced that she herself had matured more than Pepper Ann and was willing to keep her distance from her for her own sake.

===Physical appearance===
Brenda is a tall Caucasian girl with blond hair done up in two large pigtails. She wears a red-orange dress with a wide skirt and light blue trimming and, oddly enough, wears brown puppy shoes.

==Trivia==
*It is possible that Brenda suffers from [[wikipedia:Peter Pan syndrome|Peter Pan Syndrome]], in that she is incapable of mentally growing up. Seeing as how it is not accepted as a real psychosis, this might also explain why she believes she has matured and not Pepper Ann.
*Besides the two major episodes, Brenda has cameoed in "[[Crush and Burn]]", "[[Impractical Jokes]]", "[[You Oughta Be in Musicals!]]" and "[[Complimentary Colors]]". While this could simply the animators reusing assets, this would also imply that Brenda remained in Hazelnut, but stayed true to keeping her distance from Pepper Ann.
