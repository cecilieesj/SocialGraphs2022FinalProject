He is the nephew of Commander [[Jun Sato]] and the leader of Iron Squadron, the name of his late father's detachment. His uncle describes Mart to be rebellious, and despite being a brave and gifted pilot he is also very stubborn, especially when he refused to leave his home world.

==Role in the Series==
When the Empire invaded his homeworld, Mykapo, he initially refused to leave, even though his ship had a broken hyperdrive. Eventually, Mart and Iron Squadron joined forces with the Ghost crew, handing the Empire a defeat and escaping to fight another day. He was reunited with his uncle, Commander Sato, and his friends.
