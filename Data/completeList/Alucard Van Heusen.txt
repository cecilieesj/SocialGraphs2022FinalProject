==Role in the [[Wizards of Waverly Place|series]]==
Alucard is first seen in "[[Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place]]" in his sandwich shop, Late Nite Bite, when [[Justin Russo|Justin]] comes in to investigate the new sandwich. Alucard realizes that Justin works at the Waverly Sub Station and there to steal their ideas. He later arrives at the substation telling the Russo's that making Justin play with his daughter's feelings is low, even for wizards. At first, he will not allow Justin and Juliet to date, but gives in after they beg him, and when his wife reminds him how they were young and in love once.

In "[[Wizards vs. Vampires: Tasty Bites]]", [[Alex Russo|Alex]] goes to Alucard and his wife to ask if they can get Juliet to stop making her family eat healthy but instead he gives Alex and [[Harper Finkle|Harper]] a job at Late Nite Bite. After they have started working for him, he tells them that the reason why Juliet is so healthy is that she is a young vampire and that they make humans eat healthy as it makes the blood taste better.

When Alucard is talking a photo for Alex and Harper's ID cards, Alucard and his wife look like they are fighting over who should help Alex with her photo, but were really fighting over who should drink Alex's blood and who should drink Harper's. When the Russo save them, Max is covered in pumpkin which the Van Huesens' say is toxic for them just like garlic is. The Russo's ask for apologies for the Van Huesen trying to drink their blood, but Alucard gives them free ice cream instead.

==Trivia==
*On a side note, Alucard is "Dracula" spelled backwards, and is also the name of actual powerful vampires in many different stories, including the show ''Hellsing'' and the movie ''Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors''.
*It is possible that Alucard bit Cindy, as he acts more like a vampire and she acts normal.
