Bruce Banner seeks Creel to find information about the Cube, the prison for Gamma irradiated villains. However, Creel absorbs the metal of a spoon and attacks Banner to provoke him so he can turn into the [[Hulk]] and fight him. Creel is defeated and sent to the Cube.

During the breakout, Absorbing Man and [[Abomination]] helped the [[Leader]] take over the Cube.

When the Leader activated his Gamma dome in Las Vegas, Absorbing Man absorbed [[Mjolnir]] to fight [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], but this resulted on his undoing as Thor merely concentrated in order to control him just like he controls Mjolnir, so he sent Absorbing Man crashing into the Leader.
