'''Feral Predator''', or simply the '''Predator''', is the antagonist of the [[2022]] [[Hulu]] movie ''[[Prey]]''. He is an extraterrestrial creature who is determined to fight a worthy adversary.

==Background==

=== Personality ===
While a skilled hunter and warrior, the Feral Predator is also still young, inexperienced and overconfident. While adhering to the Yautja Honor Code in the sense that he will not attack unarmed opponents or non-aggressive animals, the Feral Predator was much more selective with the code in actual combat: he remained cloaked during his fight with a bear, he switched his active camouflage on during combat with Taabe when he got frustrated with the Comanche and killed a wounded Raphael, though in that particular case the hunter may have just been surprised. 

This willingness to bend the Code, suggests that Feral Predator more or less viewed the Code as being more like guidelines rather then actual rules. Alternatively, the Honor Code he followed being slightly different, less stricter than the one classic Predators familiar most, owing to indication of him originated from a clan who different than ones introduced in previous installments (see Trivia below).

However, after Naru was able to injure him and proved herself a worthy adversary, he intentionally decides to draw out the fight even though he could have easily killed her. The Feral Predator also seemed to have a very short temper, quickly grows frustrated upon challenges from foes which he found too subpar to his liking such as Comanche warriors and Taabe. The peak of his temper was exhibited when during his encounter with the French trappers; after stumbling into a bear trap and being ambushed, the Feral Predator went into a violent rage and used all of his weapons to slaughter his human assailants, even resorting to using explosives out of sheer spite towards them. The Predator's all-out approach against the trappers admittedly didn't help by latter group less formidable in comparison of Comanche warriors he fought prior, with one of the trappers ended up ended up killing himself in humiliating manner (his flintlock shot got deflected back to his skull by his Bio-Mask). 

The Feral Predator also enjoyed utilizing unarmed combat mixed with his wrist blades more then his other weapons, as he seemed to particularly enjoy killing with his bare hands the most. It seems he also came to enjoy hunting by the trees, stalking his prey from above, a tactic that later followed by more experienced Jungle Hunter.

===Physical appearance===
[[File:Feral Predator - no helmet.png|thumb|The Feral Predator without his mask.]]
Like its fellow species, referred to in other media as the '''Yautja''', or '''Hish''', the Feral Predator is a tall, bulky being with black and brown armored skin. His fingers are tipped with large claws, and he wears minimal armor, mainly in the form of his wrist bracers, a loincloth, belts to carry his equipment, and his helmet, which can see in a wide array of visual spectrums. He has a rather obtuse head with long wiry, hair-like dreadlocks that serve as sensory organs and a large helmet resembling or perhaps constructed from a skull of an alien creature. When the helmet is removed, his real face is shown to have tiny yellow eyes and a large wide mouth with four insect-like mandibles and fangs.  

===Powers and abilities===
The Feral Predator possesses an array of weapons, including his species' signature double wristblades, a laser-guided speargun and his helmet, which can see heat signatures, infrared, and other visual spectrums. The Feral Predator also had several chain blades that could snap straight before being thrown at a target, curling around to slice through the target; they could slice through a human's leg like a knife through butter, and could break a bear trap with little effort. He also possessed a spear that could be separated into a machete and a mace in combat. Likewise the helmet contains a cloaking device that can turn him invisible. On top of this, the Feral Predator possessed tools for preserving the skulls of his kills: after beheading his quarries, he would use liquid nitrogen or a similar component to dissolve their flesh, leaving only the bones that he would attach to his belt. In addition to this, the Feral Predator can run faster than any human, climb trees with terrifying speed and leap great distances. An excellent tracker, he can hunt prey over a wide expanse of territory, and he was strong enough to kill an adult grizzly bear with nothing more than his bare hands and wrist blades.

==Trivia==
*This Is the First time this predator has ever been to earth for a hunt
*Behind the scenes, he is referred to as the Feral Predator.  
*This Predator is more distinct from other Predators in the Franchise and has a more bulbous, narrow forehead, suggesting it is from an as-yet unseen group of Predators within the species. The director of ''Prey'' has hinted it may come from a different part of the species' home planet.
**Michael Vincent, the film's concept artist, confirmed such statement by describing Feral Predator being hailed from one of desert-dwelling clans (other members of his kind which featured so far better adapted to jungle biomes by contrast). In addition of developing more distinctive appearance as expressed by Feral Predator himself, the clan also holds reverence in bones as reflected from his Bio-Mask which fashioned from the skull of a formidable alien lifeform (implied to be a River Ghost from ''Predators'' or similar creature).
**This is in line with other Predators in the franchise, such as the [https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Predator_Clan Super Predators] from 2010's ''Predators'' film and the more classic Predators like the [https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Hunter_Clan Jungle Predator] and [https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Angeles_hunting_party City Hunter] from the first two films.
*Design and mechanics-wise, Feral Predator's retractable shield being based on Kratos' Guardian Shield from 2018 game ''God of War''.
