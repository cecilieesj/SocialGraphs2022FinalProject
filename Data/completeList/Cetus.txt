==Role in [[Hercules (film)|''Hercules'']]==
In the Hercules film, the Cetus is one of the many giant monsters that appears during the song [[Zero to Hero]]. He appears while [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and [[Philoctetes]] were rowing a boat through a body of water. While Philoctetes coward in fear, Hercules grabbed the serpent by the throat and threw him around like a wet towel. The scene then changed to a vase depicting Hercules holding the skeleton of the beast. 

In another scene, [[Hades]] was seen melting a small pawn piece of the creature in his hand out of anger.

**Another story stated that Poseidon unleashed Cetus on the city of Troy, only to be defeated by Hercules like in the film.
