'''Emmitt Otterton''' is a [[North America|North American]] river otter<ref name="File" /> from the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film, ''[[Zootopia]]''. The husband of [[Mrs. Otterton]], he goes missing and mysteriously turns savage. The search for the missing otter becomes the driving force of the film.

==Appearances==
===''[[Zootopia]]''===
In the film, Mr. Otterton had urgent matters to discuss with his good friend and employer [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]]. He contacted Mr. Big, who sent a limousine to pick him up. Before that, he bought a [[pawpsicle]] from [[Nick Wilde]] and went to the Mystic Springs Oasis. When [[Yax]] and Nangi walked him out, [[Mr. Manchas]] picked him up in a limousine and started driving him to Mr. Big's mansion.

That night during the escort, however, Otterton is shot by a [[Doug (Zootopia)|sniper]] with a pellet containing [[Night howlers|night howler]] serum, causing Otterton to regress to a savage state. In his last moments of sanity, Otterton madly yells "night howlers" as a warning to what had happened to him. When Manchas overhears the commotion, Otterton attacks him, brutally maiming the jaguar's eye and forcing the car to stop off-road while Manchas barely manages to get away alive from the now feral otter. With a snarl, Otterton then scurries off into the night. He is eventually captured by wolf security forces under the orders of [[Mayor Lionheart]] and incarcerated at [[Cliffside Asylum]] with other predatory citizens who also have gone savage.

Ten days later, Mr. Otterton is located by Officer [[Judy Hopps]] and [[Nick Wilde]], who was sent by Mrs. Otterton to find him, but only receive a fierce snarl from the otter, his sentience apparently absent from his mind. After the asylum is raided, Otterton is moved to a hospital, though still remains in his feral state. When Mrs. Otterton visits her husband, she is heartbroken to see the Emmitt she knew to be lost.

When it is discovered that the night howlers were the cause of the outbreak as an elaborate plot by Assistant Mayor [[Bellwether]], an antidote for the savaged citizens is found. Among them, Mr. Otterton is eventually cured of his savage condition and happily reunites with his wife, who is there when he wakes up to sanity.

During the end credits, Mr. and Mrs. Otterton are seen at a concert held by [[Gazelle]], happily dancing together.

===Other appearances===
An emoticon version of Mr. Otterton frequently appeared in the ''Zootopia'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.

==Trivia==
*According to the police report, Mr. Otterton is 2'4" in height, weighs 21 pounds, and has an address at 2347 Riverbrook Lane in Rainforest District.<ref name="File" />
**However, a deleted scene "Detective Work" shows that Otterton weighs 20 pounds.
**In the same deleted scene, Otterton's zip code is 91521, which is a zip code where the Walt Disney Studios building is located in Burbank, California.
*Mr. Otterton's full name is a reference to the ''[[w:c:Muppets:Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas|Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas]]'' TV special, according to [[Byron Howard]].<ref>[http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/5ov9c8/momontheside.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-zootopia Everything You Need to Know About Zootopia] January 6th, 2016</ref>
*He is a frequent attendant of the Mystic Springs Oasis naturalist club, owned by [[Yax]].
*It is strongly implied that Mr. Otterton somehow figured out the night howler operation, due to his described desperation to talk to Mr. Big, as well as his mad wailing of the night howlers before becoming savage. Given his occupation as a florist, it is possible. This could also explain why he was targeted: to ensure his silence.
*According to ''Zootopia: The Official Handbook'', Mr. Otterton first met his wife at the Sunday Meerkat Market in [[Sahara Square]] 20 years before the events of the film, where the latter was looking at spicy lentils.
*Emmitt's voice is never heard.
