'''Weatherby''' is a character in the [[2003]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''.

==Background==
During his duty as one of [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]]'s crewmen, Weatherby became cursed upon taking the treasure of Hernán Cortés from [[Isla de Muerta]] and spent the next nine years in taking the treasure to lift the curse.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''===
As the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' raids [[Port Royal]], Weatherby commands a group of cursed pirates to raid the town in an attempt to look for treasure. He is later present in several occasions during destruction of the ''[[HMS Interceptor]]'' battle between the motley crew and the cursed crew to which the motley crew managed to escape from the cursed crew's forces.

During the battle at [[Isla de Muerta]], Weatherby was one of the three cursed pirates who stayed in the island with Barbossa, [[Jack Sparrow]], and [[Will Turner]]. During battle, Will and Elizabeth impale an oar on him, alongside [[Jacoby]] and Monk, all in their skeletal forms and Will places a bomb inside Jacoby's skeletal form in the moonlight, killing all three pirates trapped on the oar.

==Trivia==
*When the cursed crew was identified, Clubba was confused with Weatherby. It is presumed that Clubba was the one who died during the battle at [[Isla de Muerta]], but it is later confirmed that Weatherby was the one who stayed and died during battle, confirming that Clubba and Weatherby are separate characters.
*Strangely, Weatherby was absent in ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]''. Clubba, in this video game adaptation, takes Weatherby's role and has a striking resemblance to him.
*His actor, D.P. FitzGerald, would later play a background pirate character named "Bonesy" from ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', one year after the release of ''The Curse of the Black Pearl''.
