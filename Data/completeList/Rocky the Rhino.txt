|designer = [[Milt Kahl]]}}'''Rocky the Rhino''' is a visually-challenged Indian rhinoceros who was dropped from the [[1967]] film ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. He was to appear in the vulture sequence and would have been voiced by Frank Fontaine. He was to be animated by [[Milt Kahl]] before the character was ultimately dropped from the story.

He was eventually used in theÂ [[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|2016 live action adaptation of ''The Jungle Book'']].

==Development==
Rocky did not appear in the original book, but was based on an antagonistic unnamed rhino that appeared in Bill Peet's initial treatment of the film. The rhino would try to kill Mowgli but Mowgli and Bagheera escaped him and he crashed into various objects instead. When Peet quit working for Disney, Larry Clemmons was asked to do the story for the film, and made the rhino more comical and named him Rocky.

==Appearances==
===[[The Jungle Book|''The Jungle Book'' (1967)]]===
Rocky was to be friends with [[Buzzie, Flaps, Ziggy, and Dizzy|the Vultures]]. When Mowgli met the Vultures, the Vultures would make Rocky fight Mowgli once the man-cub accidentally woke him up, but Mowgli beat Rocky by making him crash into a rock and break his horn. As Mowgli was about to leave, Rocky and the Vultures would sing [[That's What Friends are For]] to him. Rocky would probably then help Mowgli, Baloo, and the Vultures fight Shere Khan.

Rocky was deleted from the film because Walt Disney felt there was already enough action in the film with the [[Bandar-log]] and the Vultures.

===''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''===
Rocky can be seen in the crowd during the animated soccer field sequence at [[The Isle of Naboombu]] where all the inhabitants are anthropomorphic animals. Despite being deleted from ''The Jungle Book'', this is the first time the character appears in a physical manner in a Disney film.

===[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|''The Jungle Book'' (2016)]]===
Rocky had a much smaller role in that film, where he was at the water hole with his wife and daughter Raquel.

===[[The Lion King (2019 film)|''The Lion King'' (2019)]]===
Rocky makes a cameo appearance in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake]] during the musical number "[[Circle of Life]]" attending [[Simba]]'s birth.

==Trivia==
*Many of Rocky's traits were recycled into the [[Rhino Guards]] and executioner from ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''. One of the guards even crashed into a rock failing to catch [[Lady Kluck]], just like Rocky did in failing to attack [[Mowgli]].
*Some pictures show Rocky having a little bird friend. Not much is known about the bird, but it can be assumed to have served as Rocky's conscience, similar to [[Timothy Q. Mouse]] and [[Jiminy Cricket]] and that it was a Mynah, which is a bird seen feeding off of Indian Rhinos.
*In ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', there are several rhinos that looks very similar to Rocky. One can be seen in Season One's intro and the episode "[[How the Panther Lost His Roar]]". Unlike Rocky, however, this rhino in the show was a threat to the cubs. In the episode "[[Splendor in the Mud]]", [[Winifred]]'s herd encounters a mother rhino with a calf (possibly Rocky) that threatened the herd to get out of her way and knocked Winifred's uncle over. Another rhino resembling Rocky (only with a small, round jaw) shows up in "[[The Great Kaadini]]". A herd of rhinos resembling Rocky appear in the episode "[[A Tale of Two Tails]]" in which [[Arthur and Cecil|Cecil and Arthur]] try to trick them into trampling [[Shere Khan]] and [[Kaa]], but end up trampling the two vultures instead.
