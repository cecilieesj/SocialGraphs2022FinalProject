'''Charybdis''' is a character who was featured in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]].

==Background==
Charybdis is a five-eyed sea monster whom [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] and [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] encountered on their way to find the Spear of Poseidon at Ithaquack, only to be guarded by Charybdis himself. Despite his fierce personality to Dewey and Webby, he is shown to be friendly to the two as it was found out that they were actually looking for the Spear of Selene, not the Sword of Poseidon.

==Role in the series==
Charybdis first appears in the Season 1 episode, "[[The Spear of Selene!]]".

When the McDuck family lands on [[Ithaquack]], Dewey Duck and Webby Vanderquack explore Ithaquack looking for the Spear of Selene left by [[Della Duck]] behind to which while looking for the Spear, they instead find the Sword of Poseidon in which Charybdis suddenly emerges and assaults the two. Seeing the monster behind them, Charybdis uses his tentacles and attempts to eat them. Dewey attempts to fight back, but Charybdis warns him that he should stay away from the '''Sword''' of Poseidon to which Webby explains to him that she is looking for the '''Spear''' of Selene. Charybdis gently puts them down and tells the two that in order to find the Spear, the two should go back down the hall, past the Harpy Aviary and the third door leading to the Garden of Selene. Before leaving, Dewey apologizes to him for calling him a hideous monster to which Charybdis explains that he isn't really attracted to sea monster standards to which the two suddenly leave. Dewey and Webby follow Charybdis' advice.

In the Season 2 episode, "[[Treasure of the Found Lamp!]]", [[Dijon|Faris Djinn]] and [[Scrooge McDuck]] arrive at the area where Webby and Dewey encountered Charybdis while on their way to seek the missing Lamp. Arriving there, Charybdis ferociously emerges from the water furious with Scrooge and D'jinn for waking him up, telling Scrooge if he is brave enough to face Charybdis in contact with the monster to which Scrooge faces him in combat with his cane and puts him behind a rock, followed by Djinn trying to face him in combat while [[Selene]] notices the commotion and approaches Scrooge while Djinn is fighting him. Upon tying some of his tentacles, Charybdis spares Djinn who thanks him for the journey and honors his role to find the Lamp.

==Trivia==
*In the original myth, Charybdis was a female and served as one of the challenges to the Greek heroes, Odysseus, Jason, and Aeneas and is said to live in the Strait of Messina.
