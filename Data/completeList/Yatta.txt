==Background Information ==
Yatta is [[Malina|Malina's]] best friend, always hanging out with her, and works as a waitress at [[Mudka's Meat Hut]]. She was first seen in The Emperor's New Tuber. She's a country girl with a strong Tennessean accent (like her voice actress in real-life), and is very nice and kind to Mudka's Meat Hut customers. Her social butterfly attitude often distracts her from doing her job, though and she is left keeping angry customers waiting. She is also a student at Kuzco Academy. It's stated that Yatta's a vegetarian, so she probably only works at Mudka's for the money and not the food, since the place obviously sells mostly meat-type foods.
