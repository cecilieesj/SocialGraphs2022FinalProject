==Background==
Kashlack is a curly-haired, blonde-haired butcher and along with his wife, seems to be as strange (or even stranger) than his children. He owns a butcher shop. In his youth, Kashlack married a princess (Squitza) and had two kids (Gunther and Tinka), which caused Squitza to be dethroned as the princess of their country because of his status as a commoner. According to Gunther and Tinka, he's a huge "butt-kisser". Along with his wife and children, he dresses in odd, bright, and sparkly clothing.
