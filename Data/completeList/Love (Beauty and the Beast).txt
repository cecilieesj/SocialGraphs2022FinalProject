==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Love takes the form of a woman with dark skin and long, silvery blonde hair. Like her sister, Love has green eyes. Love always dresses in white clothing. When she first appears she wears a necklace of wood on which perched beautiful butterflies, jewel-bright beetles and dusky spiders, each one a piece of living jewelry.

==Role in the book==
Love and Death play a game of chess in Death's domain. They discuss the [[Beast]]'s curse with Love expressing faith in the Beast's redemption will Death remains steadfast in her belief that the Beast is evil and unredeemable. The sisters decide to make a bet. Love wins the chess game by making her chess piece seduce the king before stabbing him in the back. She leaves but not before telling Death that neither can interfere and that Death cannot take [[Belle]] before her time.

Later, after Death lured Belle into Nevermore, Love sends her beetles to stop Belle from eating more food. The beetles write a message in the food, warning Belle of the law of Three Fates. Death, under the alias of the Countess, tells Belle to beware Love, calling the latter a crazy, dangerous woman who Belle must avoid at all cost. 

Later, in an illusion of London, Love meets with Death and the former scolds the latter for trying to bind Belle to Nevermore. According to the Three Fates' Law, if Belle were to eat three things and leave three things in Nevermore, she would be bound to it forever. Death ignores Love and threatens to let her servant attack Love if she keeps interfering with her scheme. Love runs away to avoid a confrontation with the glamoured vulture. Later, Love steals a pile of money from a street urchin to keep Belle from giving away coins and binding her to Nevermore.

Love appears again in the pear orchard on Death's estate to warn Belle not to eat anything. She shows Belle pomegranates, reminding Belle of the story of [[Persephone (The Goddess of Spring)|Persephone]] and [[Hades]]. Love then gives Belle her silver scissors and disappears.
