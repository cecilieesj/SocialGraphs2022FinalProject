==Role in the series==
In her [[Navidad|debut]], Cristina first appears at [[Avalor]] Castle with her father Fernando to invite the Royal Family to their village for their Navidad celebration on Nochesbuena, to Isabel's joy.  Isabel gives Cristina an artist's set and voices the hope that they can make a pinata with it. Unfortunately, people from other parts of the kingdom also invite Elena to their Navidad celebrations. To convince Elena to come to her's, Cristina, at Isabel's urging, tells Elena how her part of [[Avalor]] celebrate Navidad. To ensure that nobody is disappointed, Elena decides to have everyone celebrate together in Castillo Park. Cristina agrees to this and together with Isabel makes a pinata. Unfortunately, [[Doña Paloma]]'s greed ruins this attempt by making everyone competitive to the point where everyone has a fight that starts a fire that ruins everything, including the pinata. This disaster makes Fernando decide that he and Cristina should just go home. On they way, they meet a parranda led by Elena, which leads them back to the castle to celebrate there, to Cristina's joy.
