The '''Knights of Rodegan''' are villains from the television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''. They appeared in the episode "[[Royal Pain (episode)|Royal Pain]]".

==History==
The Knights of Rodegan were an order of Knights in the Medieval era who served the small European nation known as Rodegan. Despite their loyalty to the throne, one of Rodegan's earliest Kings ruled with vast cruelty and lead to a planned coup by the Knights of Rodegan. Their plans failed before they began due to being caught in the planning stages and arrested. This presumably spelled the end of Rodegan's knighthood, but the descendants of these Knights would live on to the modern day.  

A prophecy was placed upon the fate of Rodegan's monarchy, which the Knights clung to in their grudge. The prophecy, hidden upon a tapestry of the cruel tyrant, read as follows:

"Awaiting the light from a full harvest moon, Rodegan's foe will soon face his doom. In the shadow of the palace we will not be deterred, the monarchy ends with [[Prince Wally|Wallace the Third]]."


==Modern Day==
The prophecy would not be acted on until the early [[2000]]s as Wallace the Third, known as "Weak Link Wally", came close to the age of taking the throne. Having adapted to the 21st Century through a company known as Rodegan Industries, the Knights of Rodegan planned to at long last fill their grudge by assassinating Wally. Although only two of them were alive to fulfill it, they had gained access to a powerful space-to-earth laser satellite. With that, they attempted to hit him with an orbital strike. Unfortunately for the Knights, they misidentified their target, instead aiming for [[Ron Stoppable]], who had come to Rodegan with [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]].

Although the attack failed, Wally was transferred to America to live with Kim so she could protect him until the Harvest Moon passed. The Knights followed to America and on the night of the Harvest Moon they cornered Wally in the Middleton golf club, which had a palace model in its minigolf course, technically obliging the prophecy. Their attack failed due to Kim's intervention, however. Though confused because the prophecy didn't mention Kim, they fought on to avenge their ancestors' grudge. Afterwards, the two knights were arrested by the Middleton Police Department.

Ironically, though the knights failed in their mission, the prophecy came true, as Wally running for [[Middleton High School|Middleton High]] class president had inspired him to institute democracy after his father retires, thus ending the line of kings.
