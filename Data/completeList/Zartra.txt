Zartra appears in the Avengers Assemble episode "Beneath the Surface", voiced by April Stewart. In this version, she is a former advisor of Attuma and leader of Atlantean rebels to overthrow Attuma. She summoned Giganto through the Serpent Crown so that her group can use Giganto to free Atlantis from Attuma's tyranny.  During the misunderstood fight between the Avengers and Lady Zartra's group, after Attuma was defeated and the Serpent Crown was claimed by the Avengers, Lady Zartra became the new leader of Atlantis.
