'''Captain Dola''' is the tritagonist of ''[[Castle in the Sky]]''. At the beginning, Dola acts and seems like a no good pirate. She scares and chases [[Sheeta]] and [[Pazu]]. When the army shows up, they retreat, but not too far. It's not until later when Pazu returns home, depressed that he loses Sheeta to the military, that they capture him. She scolds Pazu, but in the end she allows him to come with them.

At first, Dola is angry that Sheeta lost the necklace, but soon finds out Sheeta knows the way to Laputa and allows them to come along to help them. During their travels, they discover Dola isn't as mean as she seems.

==Background==
===Personality===
Early in the film, Dola was portrayed as evil (because she was a pirate) and selfish. However, after she lets Pazu and Sheeta onto her team, she realizes that Sheeta was exactly as Dola was when she was young, and Pazu acted like her husband. This enabled Dola to soften up and show that Dola is affectionate and caring, like a mother but with pirate qualities.

==Role in the film==
Early in the film, viewers find that Dola is a pirate and is searching for the crystal that Sheeta owns. At the start, she and her pirates board the airship and attempt to capture, leading to Sheeta slipping and falling off the airship, enabling Pazu to find her floating down. The next day Dola and the pirates disguise themselves and search for Sheeta and were successful but were unsuccessful in capturing her as Pazu and Sheeta fall into an abandoned mine, saved again by the crystal. After their capture, Dola is seen again after Pazu returns from the fort that held him and Sheeta captive. Dola then accepts Pazu into her team after he learns that Sheeta just saved his life. After the rescue of Sheeta, Dola and her pirates, along with Sheeta and Pazu, boards the "Tiger Moth" (Dola's airship) and search for Laputa. In the end, the Tiger Moth gets destroyed, but Dola and her gang manage to loot some treasures off Laputa before it was destroyed.
