'''Joe Robinson''' (also known as '''Uncle Joe''') is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''. He is quietest member of the Robinson family. He is morbidly obese.

==Personality==
He doesn't speak throughout the film, but sometimes whimpers. He has apparent childlike tendencies such as sucking his thumb when he doesn't get peanut butter and jelly on his toast and being considered "the baby" when being comforted by his family.

==In the film==
He is seen sitting on his easy chair "exercising" to a weight-loss program while [[Bud Robinson|Grampa Bud]] and [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] were looking for the garage. He is later seen at the family dinner table and loses control when he doesn't get peanut butter and jelly on his toast, but later calms down after Lewis fixes the PB&J machine. He is last seen with the family when they battle the [[Michael "Goob" Yagoobian|Bowler Hat Guy]] and [[Tiny the T-Rex]] to save [[Wilbur Robinson|Wilbur]] and Lewis.
