==Role in the Series==
Orion first appears in ''[[The Mystic Isles]]'' when he rescues Sofia and her group from a collapsing bridge. He warns them about a loose evil Crystalmaster to which Sofia reveals they are looking for her as well. This pleases Orion since he wondered why people from the Ever Realm are on the Isles. Later, he loses his wings and falls. He gets saved by Harrumph the Rompkin and Sofia informs him that Prisma is covering each of the Mystic Isles in Crystals. Orion informs them that the damage can be undone if they destroy Prisma's Terra Crystal, which can only be done by a Shattering Stone. Sofia decides to go and stop Prisma but Orion tells her she is too powerful for even a Storykeeper. However, Orion later discovers that Sofia set out to stop Prisma with a Shattering Stone anyway and succeeded. After they arrested Prisma, Orion and Vega invited Sofia to receive training as Protector of the Ever Realm, which Sofia accepts. Pleased, Orion tells Sofia to return to Enchancia and that they will inform her of her training when the time comes. Later, he and Vega help make Chrysta Sofia's Protector trainer, vouching for her when the other Protectors and herself doubt her abilities.
