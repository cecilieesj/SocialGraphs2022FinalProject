'''Emutilda''' is a character in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]]. She is the emu pet of [[Matilda McDuck]].

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Emutilda is a large brown emu with a plumage of brown feathers.

==Appearances==
Emutilda appeared in the Season 3 episode, ''[[The Fight for Castle McDuck!]]''. As a grumpy [[Scrooge McDuck]] barges into [[Matilda McDuck|Matilda]]'s room and upon noticing what Matilda did to Scrooge's clump of hair Whiskers, the two clash into each other as Emutilda angrily grabs the clump of hair Scrooge is holding. Following an argument between Scrooge and his family, an angry Downy McDuck wards off Emutilda out of the McDuck family's manor. Furthermore as the [[Phantom Blot]] and [[Pepper (DuckTales)|Pepper]] arrive at hall of statues of the McDuck ancestors in a plan to steal the Blessed Bagpipe and as the two steal the object, Emutilda blocks them from escaping as the mad emu angrily chases the F.O.W.L. agents across the hall just as the family continues to argue. In a plan to work together to stop Pepper and the Blot and protect the Bagpipe from theft, Scrooge, [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]], and Matilda ride on Emutilda, commanding the other McDuck family members (including the statues of the McDuck ancestors) to put in their teamworkâ€™s and protect the Bagpipe. Emutilda and the McDucks surround the two villains, followed by Scrooge's mother demanding the two to leave the manor. With Pepper and the Phantom Blot defeated, Emutilda hears Scrooge explaining to Webby that sometimes families fight while Emutilda is being comforted by her owner. To repair the damage that happened earlier during the fight, Emutilda, her owner Matilda, and Scrooge work together to clean up.

==Trivia==
*Her name is used in honor of [[Matilda McDuck]].
