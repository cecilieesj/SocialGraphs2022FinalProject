'''Shakes the Rattle''' was a scrapped character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[1995]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story]]''. He would appear in a scene that was ultimately deleted. This scene would play out after the toys watch [[Sid Phillips|Sid]] blow up a [[Combat Carl]] through [[Lenny]]. Afterwards, they watch Sid take one of [[Hannah Phillips|Hannah]]'s dolls and give it to [[Scud]] to demolish. Once [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] talks about teaching him a lesson, a toy ring on a night stand speaks about his experiences with Sid. He talks about an old Rattle named Shakes who he threw across to Sid's window, much to the toys' displeasure. He's heard the screams, and has multiple theories about his death. Though, he says Shakes was lucky, because he tells of things in Sid's room that are worse than death. As he squeaks away, Woody shakes it off as a cheesy, scary story and openly mocks the tale.

This scene was scrapped for how scary and uncomfortable the scene was, although [[Tom Hanks|Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen|Allen]] already recorded their dialogue for that scene.
