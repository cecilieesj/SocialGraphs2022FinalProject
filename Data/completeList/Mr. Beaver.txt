==Role in the film==
Mr. Beaver helps [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], and [[Peter Pevensie]] get across [[Narnia]] to see [[Aslan]]. They need to see Aslan so they could get their brother [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] back because he has been kidnapped by [[Jadis the White Witch|The White Witch]]. Once they arrived, Peter killed [[Maugrim]] to protect Susan and Lucy. One of the other wolves made it back to the White Witches camp, which got invaded by Aslan's army. The following morning, Peter saw Edmund at the top of hill, apologizing to Aslan for his actions. The White Witch demanded a meeting with Aslan which was revealed by Mr. Beaver. After Aslan was killed on the Stone Table, Mr. Beaver prepared Edmund for war.

During battle against Jadis, Mr. Beaver is present standing on a cliff with the other archers and after a centauress archer summons a phoenix via arrow and the phoenix creates a fire barricade successfully, he and the other Narnians cheer for a success. However, as there are too many minions fighting in the battlefield, he tells Edmund to escape the battlefield, to which Edmund risks himself to kill the White Witch but is stabbed by Jadis herself, injuring him during battle. Fortunately, Aslan returned from the dead and kills the White Witch in battle, ending the war forever. Mr. Beaver and his wife are later present attending the Pevensies' coronation as he and his wife cheer for them.
