{{Quote|We are called Northuldra. We are the people of the sun.|[[Yelana]]|Frozen II}}
The '''Northuldra''' are an indigenous group who live within [[the Enchanted Forest]], north of [[Arendelle]], and are known as the "people of the sun". Though they possess no [[magic]] of their own, they are deeply connected to the magic of the forest and its [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|elemental spirits]] - the wind spirit [[Gale]], the fire spirit [[Bruni]], the water spirit [[the Nokk|Nokk]], and the [[Earth Giants]]. The Northuldra were on friendly terms with the people of Arendelle, but a [[King Runeard|shocking betrayal]] led to conflict between the two peoples, which led to a contingent of both being trapped in the forest for thirty-four years, and all outside relations being cut off.

==Background==
Thirty-four years prior to the events of ''[[Frozen II]]'', the [[Arendelle|Arendellian]] [[King Runeard]] led a contingent of Arendellians into [[the Enchanted Forest]]. His stated purpose was to maintain good relations between the two peoples and to present the Northuldra with a gift - a [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] which would strengthen their lands.

Secretly, however, King Runeard was fearful of all [[magic]]. He believed, quite wrongly, that any access to magic made people feel they are too powerful and would lead them to believe that they could defy the will of a king. The dam, in fact, was secretly a ruse to weaken the forest and, by extension, the people.

During a gathering between the Northuldra and Arendellians in the forest, Runeard secretly murdered the Northuldra leader in cold blood after the latter voiced his realization about the dam harming the forest instead of helping it. After his murderous deed, Runeard instigated a war with the Northuldra, but conducted his actions in stealth, leading those of the [[Royal Guards (Frozen)|royal guards]], including [[Lieutenant Mattias]], to believe that it was, in fact, the Northuldra who were responsible. During the fighting, Runeard fell off a cliff to his death along with another Northuldra he had been trying to strike down. The conflict angered the [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|spirits]] of the forest, who ran rampant and then a magical mist appeared, creating a barrier that allowed nobody to enter or leave the forest. However, a young Northuldran girl [[Queen Iduna|Iduna]] rescued the Arendellian [[King Agnarr|Prince Agnarr]], and the two later became friends upon returning to Arendelle.

As adults, the couple fell in love, married, and became King and Queen of Arendelle, respectively. Three years later, the couple had their first child, [[Elsa]], who possesses magic as a gift from the spirits. After three more years, Agnarr and Iduna had their second daughter, [[Anna]].

==Role in the film==
{{Quote|We only trust nature. When nature speaks...we listen.|[[Yelana]] to [[Elsa]], just before and during the forest is set ablaze}}
As children, Elsa and Anna are told a tale of [[the Enchanted Forest]] by their [[King Agnarr|father]], then about a mysterious [[Ahtohallan|river]] and the song "[[All Is Found]]" by their [[Queen Iduna|mother]].

Three years after becoming the Queen of [[Arendelle]], Elsa begins hearing a [[Into the Unknown (song)|mysterious voice calling to her]]. When she tries to follow the voice, the [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|spirits of the forest]] invade Arendelle, draining its natural elements. Elsa brings [[Anna]], [[Olaf]], [[Kristoff]] and [[Sven]] with her to the Enchanted Forest, where she uses her magic to get them past the magical mist. There, the group discovers the Northuldra and Arendellian soldiers, who have been locked in a sort of stalemate for over 34 years, distrustful of each other, but not openly combative. They reveal who they are and eventually gain the trust of both groups. In honor of them, the Northuldra sing the song "[[Vuelie]]" and offer their aid.

Through a long and perilous journey, the group discovers the truth behind the conflict of thirty-four years before. The forest is freed and Elsa remains behind with the Northuldra as the forest's fifth spirit.

==Trivia==
*The mythology of the Northuldra draws heavily upon the culture of the real-life Sámi people. For the creation of ''Frozen II'', Disney signed a contract with the Sámi people to respectfully portray Sámi culture. The Sámi parliaments of Norway, Sweden and Finland, along with the Saami Council reached out to collaborate with the film's producers. The contract also included an agreement that Disney would produce a dubbed version of ''Frozen II'' in one Sámi language and participate in cross-learning initiatives that contribute to Indigenous communities in Scandinavia.<ref name="Sami">{{Cite web|title=Disney signed a contract with Indigenous people before making Frozen II|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/disney-frozen-2-indigenous-culture-sami/|first=Radheyan|last=Simonpillai|date=November 19, 2019|publisher=''Now Toronto''|format=Article|website=}}</ref> The Sámi people and those worked with by the filmmakers appear in the film's credits.
*The name of the Northuldra is derived from "huldra" or "hulder", a Norse root word meaning "covered" or "secret", reflecting their status as a hidden people living in the Enchanted Forest. In Scandinavian folklore, Huldra is used as the name for a magical race of forest dwelling women with tails that would seduce men traveling in their woods. These Huldra would become associated with tales of the "hidden folk" in general, turning the word into a common toponym for locations associated with those stories.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulder</ref>
*They are experts at hiding themselves within the Enchanted Forest and keep huge herds of reindeer.<ref name="Magical Guide">''Frozen II'': The Magical Guide, p. 56</ref>
*In Polar Nights, it is revealed that, after the curse was lifted, the Northuldra migrated, out of the Enchanted Forest, to explore new lands, after being locked up for a long time. This explains their lack of appearances, in any works, after Frozen II.
