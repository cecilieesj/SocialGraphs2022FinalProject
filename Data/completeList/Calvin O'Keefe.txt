Charles offers Meg to invite him for dinner, to which Meg feels unsure if she should invite him, where Charles goes into a short conversation with Calvin. As Calvin kindly greets Dana in the house, he plays with Charles while Dana continues researching the tesseract project.

That night, Calvin asks Meg's mother to know if she is a neurobiologist to which she explains that she is while Mrs. Whatsit talks to Charles again in his mind to show Calvin about his missing father. Later on, Calvin joins in with Charles and Meg under orders from Mrs. Whatsit to find Jack who and save him from being lost where the three arrive at Uriel, the third star of the planet Malik. It is then known that it was the tesseract that sent Calvin and the rest of the trio to the planet. As the trio picks up the blue flowers, Calvin and the rest board on Mrs. Whatsit in her Pegasus-like creature form and look at the distant darkness that senses a great danger to the universe if not stopped.

That night, Meg goes into discussion with Calvin after overhearing the three Mrs. Ws discussing about their curiosities with Calvin and Charles to which, just as Meg says that the three of them haven't decided to know if they would hold Meg and the rest of her group as hostages. The next day, Calvin goes into a conversation with Mrs. Whatsit, Who, and Which, who discuss about the troubles of darkness and Mr. Murry who is lost in the planet Camazotz. He then goes with Calvin to look for the Hapoy Medium, beings who would help the children on their quest to defeat the dark forces. Upon encountering the Happy Medium, he shows the three problems with the O'Keefe Residence and the Murry family house affected by the negativity caused by a mysterious being known as "The It", leading the three to travel to Camazotz by themselves to find Mr. Murry. During their journey, the three encounter glowworms which helped the three give them light just as the three find the Happy Medium who would be happy to help the three on their journey. After learning about Mrs. Murry sad for her husband's loss, it leads Meg, Charles, and Calvin to travel to the planet Camazotz to find Mr. Murry via tesseract. As Calvin asks one of them to help find Mr. Murry, he ignores him as he playing.

Upon arriving at Camazotz, Calvin and the trio get attacked by the vicious ruler known as It, who watches them at the Central Central Intelligence just as the danger silenced and the trio explores a local neighborhood to which after passing and arriving at a movie house, the three discover many merchandise related to It who rules over Camazotz at the Central Central Intelligence as a local Camazotz resident girl points the trio to It's headquarters to which after discussing with a Camazotz resident teen about It, Meg, Charles, and Calvin approach the Central Central Intelligence headquarters to face It.

Arriving at the lair, Calvin, alongside Meg and Charles, enter Room K07 without filling the forms required to access by following an agent nearby without getting caught by the security guards. Arriving there, Calvin is held hostage by two of the headquarter's guards while Meg and Charles disguise themselves as scientists to enter the lab Calvin is placed at. While being placed inside his seat where he is told that he cannot resist It, he hallucinates a dream of him being top basketball player in his mind as Meg tells him that the laboratory employees gave him a hallucination of his basketball dream, Meg and Charles find lab coats in order to enter the lab to which upon entering, Meg tells him to snap out of it as this hallucination is a trap to which Charles manages to help rescue him from this trap. Having rescued Calvin, the three continue their mission to find Meg's father to which upon noticing that they cannot escape, Meg sees an image nearby believing it is his missing father where he attempts to enter but is unable to, much to her frustrations to which Calvin tells her that her father could be anywhere. He then tells Meg to be patient and think calmly before she causes more problems by remembering what Mrs. Whatsit said to which Meg puts on Mrs. Who's glasses and is able to access the image where her father is at to which upon entering the image, it suddenly disappears, causing Charles and Calvin are unable to catch up with Meg.

After Meg rescues her father through the power of tesseract through Mrs. Who's glasses, Calvin approaches Meg's father alongside Charles Wallace who is happy to see his father back before the moment is interrupted when the Man with Red Eyes appears in front of the four. He then separates the platforms between Charles Wallace's allies and Charles himself. Upon noticing Meg being held midair by Charles who is being controlled by the Man with Red Eyes, Calvin devises a plan with Meg's father to use Mrs. Who's glasses to save Meg from the hands of It to which while grabbing Meg to help her escape, Meg's father uses Mrs. Who's pair of glasses to help him and Meg escape, but during the tesseract, Meg could not hold on Calvin's hand longer, separating her from the two.

Calvin and Meg's father end up in the planet Ixchel where he attempts to find Meg across the snowy environment. Upon seeing some residential Ixchel aliens, he thinks the aliens are hostile to him while trying to look for Meg to which one of them kindly tells Calvin not to fear them because they are friendly aliens. Calvin later sees Meg who feels a lot better after being rescued to which she discusses with him fearing that she would lose Charles Wallace to which while discussing, Calvin explains to Meg that according to Aunt Beast, the darkness from Camazotz stalked Meg while she was in the tesseract while she was vulnerable to which Aunt Beast arrives towards the two discussing with each other about a plan to rescue Charles, telling Meg to discover anything that is unseen.

After a talk with Mrs. Which, Calvin shares his experience with Meg who discusses with him about losing Charles to which while talking with him, she explains to her friend that there is something he is afraid of to which Calvin shares his fear of not being like Meg to which Meg explains to her friend that she is afraid of not trying to rescue Charles Wallace, which is the fear Meg is experiencing. Later, Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who appear in front of the Calvin, alongside Meg and her father, where they discuss with the three about the possibility of reuniting Charles back to his family to which it is explained that grace could be the only way to fulfill their mission in defeating It and his powerful forces. After Meg listens to Mrs. Whatsit's advice, Meg happily reunites with Calvin just before approaching Aunt Beast.

Later when Meg returns to Camazotz to rescue Charles Wallace and faces the Man with Red Eyes in a plan to free him, Meg then counts the number of elements from one to thirteen shown on the periodic table to stall It's plans to which a vision of Calvin playing basketball suddenly appears where he tells Meg that Charles is Meg's only hope to which after the image of Calvin suddenly disappears just before Meg and Charles return back to the real world (actually an illusion as part of the It's tricks).

Later after Meg rescues Charles Wallace with the Man with Red Eyes (and It, the being itself) defeated for good, Meg and Charles Wallace return to the real world via tesseract with Calvin returning, along with Meg and Charles Wallace's father. When the three Mrs. Ws appear, Calvin listens to the three praising Meg for rescuing Charles Wallace and defeating It and all of his evil forces, just as Mrs. Who bids Calvin a farewell. After the three Mrs. Ws leave, Calvin approaches Meg who explains to her about what she did to save Charles Wallace to which Meg couldn't explain about what she did to save Charles to which she explains to him that love was the one which saved Charles as she and Calvin calmly observe a quiet, starry night.
