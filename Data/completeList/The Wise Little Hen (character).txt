She asks them for the help of [[Peter Pig]] and [[Donald Duck]], who feign bellyache. Having managed with her chicks, she returns to see the pig and the duck help in the picking. They redo the blow of the disease. This time, the hen realizes that they are liars, when one of the planks of their clubhouse came down after they come in and seeing them shaking hands. She contacts them again during the tasting, that they agree to volunteer. But the basket which she gives contains castor oil. She and her chicks have a fest to themselves.

== Trivia ==
The Wise Little Hen resembles [[Clara Cluck]] even having the same voice actress (the cartoon was released a couple of months before Clara's Debut in [[Orphan's Benefit (1934)]]).
