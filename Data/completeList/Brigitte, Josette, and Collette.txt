[[File:Isabella, Brigette, Colette, and Josette.JPG|right|250px|thumb|From left to right: Collette, Josette, Brigette, and [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]].]]In the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode "[[Buford Confidential]]", three new [[Fireside Girls]] appeared: '''Brigitte, Josette, and Collette'''.
==Brigitte==
'''Brigitte''' is a French Fireside Girl that was once in love with [[Buford Van Stomm|Buford]], and admits to being at least 'vaguely interested' in him.
===Biography===
Nothing is known about Brigitte's past, except that she fell in love with [[Buford Van Stomm|Buford]]. It can also be assumed that she was born in France.   
===Physical Appearance===
Brigitte's Fireside Girl outfit is a long-sleeved shirt with a red collar and cuffs, a beret, and a pleated skirt. Her casual attire is a blue long-sleeved shirt, checkered back and blue skirt, long socks, and blue shoes. For swimming, she wears a 2-piece swimsuit with a red stripe on the top.
===Relationships===
====Buford Van Stomm====
She might have a crush on him. Buford also learned to speak French for her, saying that it was easy because it was similar to Latin and he completely forgot himself. He didn't want anyone to find out about this as he was afraid that it would ruin his way of life.
====Isabella Garcia-Shapiro====
Isabella helped her and her troop earn the North American Tracking Patch.
====Josette and Collette====
Josette and Collette are the members of her troop. She may have other unknown members as well. Just like the members of Isabella's troops follow her orders, Josette and Collette follow Brigitte's.

==Collette's Trivia==
