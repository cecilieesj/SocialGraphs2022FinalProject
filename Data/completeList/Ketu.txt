'''Acolyte Ketu''' is a character from the now-defunct [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] attraction, [[Rivers of Light]].

==History==
===Background===
Acolyte Ketu is one of the two acolytes featured in the former [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] attraction, [[Rivers of Light]] alongside Acolyte [[Ambu]]. Throughout the show, he is seen on the Fire Lantern Sailboat alongside Shaman [[Aditya]] where his boat represents the element of fire. Like the rest of the performers featured in the Rivers of Light show, Ketu does not speak and instead communicates through nonverbal gestures throughout the show.

===Development History===
As of [[September 29]], [[2018]] due to budget costs, Acolyte Ketu and the rest of the live performers were removed from the nighttime show permanently. Despite the removal of the performers of the attraction, the remaining elements from the Rivers of Light attraction were retained prior to its closure in 2020.

==Role in the attraction==
Acolyte Ketu and Shaman Aditya are introduced in the beginning of the show to which during the show, the narrator tells the audience about the elements of water and light harmoniously reuniting to create the wonders of life where the spirits of the animals reunite with each other in harmony to represent the wonders of all living creatures in the attraction to which as the show begins, Ketu observes Aditya blowing his horn just as the Parade of the Animal Spirit Guides begins.

In Act IV, Ketu summons the tiger spirit during the show while Shaman Aditya blows his horn just as the tiger spirit travels through different realms of the Animal Spirits. During the musical number "[[We Are One (Rivers of Light song)|We Are One]]", Ketu happily observes the animal spirits reunited with each other in harmony together alongside Aditya just as the song plays throughout the sequence.

Later in Act V when Shaman [[Aseema]] summons the owl spirit to explore the snowy region of Alaska, Ketu observes the tundra animals reunited with each other in harmony with Aditya and as a reprise of "We Are One" ends, Aditya blows his horn just as the storytellers call in the aurora borealis to reunite all the animal spirits together just as the Animal Spirit Guides return to their lantern barges just before the sequence loops to the Temple Lotus sequence to bring in the grand finale reprise of "We Are One".
