When the mayor and people of Hamelin show themselves to be thankless by giving to the Pied Piper only a single gold coin instead of the promised bag of gold (claiming that the rats left of their own accord while the Piper played on his instrument), The Piper is incensed by their betrayal and decides that their children deserved better than to be allowed to grow up like the corrupt townspeople. So he uses his music to lead all the village children out of Hamelin and into an enchanted world, where they can play and laugh all day long.

They have appeared in ''[[The Pied Piper]]'' and in [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.
