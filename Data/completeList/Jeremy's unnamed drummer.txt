'''Jeremy's unnamed drummer''' is a friend of [[Jeremy Johnson]]. He is the drummer in Jeremy's band, [[Jeremy and the Incidentals]]. He was first seen when he, along with Jeremy and the bass player, performed at the Summer Festival, during which they were briefly transformed into a punk rock version of themselves by [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz]]'s Ugly-inator. ("[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]")

He was later seen in Candace's dream. He is at the mall with Jeremy and some friends when Jeremy laughs at Candace when she asks to go to the dance ("[[Out to Launch (Phineas and Ferb)|Out to Launch]]"). He is also seen in the audience of the HaHaHut, on the day Phineas and Ferb help Candace feel better. ("[[Cheer Up Candace]]")

He is then seen dancing in the background in "[[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!]]".

==Relationships==
===Jeremy Johnson===
He is possibly great friends with Jeremy because he is in the same band and they have been seen at the mall hanging out together.

===Coltrane===
It is unknown if they are friends, but they are in the same band together along with Jeremy.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Candace Gets Busted]]", a different drummer appears. It couldn't have been the same person because he shows up later, walking through the door.
*He has his first speaking appearance in "[[Does This Duckbill Make Me Look Fat?]]".
*In "[[Cheer Up Candace]]", he flips over a table because he thinks Ferb's joke is funny.
