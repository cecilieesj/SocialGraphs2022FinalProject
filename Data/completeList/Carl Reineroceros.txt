'''Carl Reineroceros''' is a toy rhinoceros and a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]]'s [[2019]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''. His name is a pun on his actor, [[Carl Reiner]]'s name.

== Background ==
Carl Reineroceros is one of the senior toys in [[Bonnie]]'s collection. However, since he is senior, he is mostly in the closest alongside the other senior baby toys, though before that he was played with plenty, liking the game hat shop, remembering it.

=== Physical appearance ===
Carl is shown as an aging toy rhinoceros, seeming to be worn out. He is pink with small pink ears and legs, and is shown to have small teeth. His back however has a purple tint. He is shown to have a large white tusk alongside darkened eyebrows and black eyes.

== Appearances ==

=== ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' ===
Carl Reineroceros first appears when all of Bonnie's toys are in her closest while [[Mrs. Anderson]] cleans Bonnie's room, with [[Dolly]] comforting them, though [[Woody]] tries to lead, though he is stopped. After Bonnie finishes breakfast she begins to play town, casting her roles: Dolly as mayor, Hamm as the banker, Slinky as the ice cream man, Trixie as the hat shop owner, Buzz as the mailman, Mr. Pricklepants as the baker, and finally the Sheriff, which she pulls out Woody's tag and gives it to Jessy, leaving, Woody, Carl, the other baby toys and [[Old Timer]] behind.

After Woody is left behind, he is shown distressed; however, when Carl and the other baby toys begin to watch him, he acts as if everything is fine. They then go to the window, seeing that Bonnie is playing hat-shop, with Carl noticing trying to remember when they last played it, though they all agree to Melephant saying that he liked house.

When Old Timer notices that Woody has gotten his first dust ball, Carl and the other baby toys seem excited, wanting to give it a name (symbolizing that he is being used less and less), though the cowboy pays little attention. However, when Dolly went to check up with Woody, only Carl and the other toys are present, seeming confused on the events.

=== ''[[Forky Asks a Question]]'' ===

[[File:CarlReineroceros-Forky-What-Love.jpg|left|thumb|236x236px|Carl Reineroceros in ''Forky Asks a Question'']]Carl Reineroceros returns in ''[[Forky Asks a Question]]'' episode, ''[[What is Love?]]'' with a larger role than in the film and with Carl Reiner reprising his role.

He is first seen when [[Forky]] introduces them, calling them very (saying it seven times) senior toys, with Carl asking how many verys does a person truly need. When Forky asks what is love, Carl responds saying that it is when your soul goes boom, though Chairol disagrees, with Melephant deciding to act it out with Chairol. After they act it out, with Forky declaring love boring they realize that Carl is crying, wondering what is wrong, with Carl revealing that he is in love with Chairol, with Melephant and Chairol faking to kiss making him feel worse.

However, suddenly his then girlfriend Bitey White comes out, confronting him on his love for Chairol, with the two sharing insults, when Carl tells Bitey that she never made his soul go Boom! and that their love was a lie, startling everyone. Then, Melephant confesses that when he faked kissing Chairol, he wanted Carl to break up with Bitey so he could be with the biting toy, much to her excitement though Chairol than states she felt something when Melephant faked kissing her, leading to an argument with the senior toys, much to Forky's amusement
