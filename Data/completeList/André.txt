==Background==
André is shown to be calm at first whenever he wakes up. However, when Wally B. shows up, he is shown to be aggressive towards him for disturbing his peaceful moment.

==Role in the short film==
André is first seen waking up from his nap in a quiet evening; however, [[Wally B.]] begins to pester André, so he distracts him to get away. He speeds off running and laughing out loud, taunting the bee pestering him. He is then chased by Wally B. and is stung offscreen to which he throws his hat at him as a last laugh.

==Trivia==
*André's character was originally going to be an android, but [[John Lasseter]] (having just been an animator for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]) designed the character in a way similar to [[Mickey Mouse]], knowing that he would be limited to simple geometric shapes.<ref>[http://www.pixartouchbook.com The Pixar Touch, David A. Price, P. 55]</ref>
*André is a tribute to the early characteristics of Mickey Mouse (physical appearance and personality), [[Donald Duck]] (through his laughter), and [[Goofy]] (with the "holler" he makes after he gets stung by Wally B.).
*André can be seen on a clock in ''[[Red's Dream]]''.
*When [[Hamm]] is clicking through channels in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', André is shown briefly on the TV.
