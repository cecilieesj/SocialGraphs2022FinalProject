'''Django''' is [[Remy]] and [[Emile]]'s father and the leader of the [[Rat Colony|rat colony]]. He is a major supporting character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Ratatouille]]''.

==Role in the film==
His son [[Remy]] is gifted with a keen understanding of cuisine, which Django really doesn't understand, as well as a powerful sense of smell and taste. Django notices his son's gift of a strong smell when Remy grabs a poisonous apple core away from him, in which he was going to eat. Because of this, Django gives his son the job of sniffing for rat poison. Django has split apart from his son Remy when their rat colony is discovered by the home's owner, forcing Django and the rats to flee into the sewer. Django is later reunited with Remy when [[Emile]] brings him back to the rat colony in their new home they moved into.

When Django hears that Remy has been close to humans, he is against it and gives Remy warning that humans and rats will never get along, showing his son an extermination shop with dead rats hanging on a bar, but Remy refuses to believe this. Later, Remy is captured by [[Chef Skinner|Skinner]], in which Django and Emile help rescue him. Remy returns to the kitchen, where [[Alfredo Linguini|Linguini]] reveals the secret of Remy cooking by controlling his movements under his hat to the staff. Everyone is in disbelief and walks out of the kitchen, leaving Linguini helpless. Django finally sees his son's passion and determination to cook, and realizes that humans aren't that bad. As of this, he organizes the rest of the pack to help out in the kitchen. They lock Skinner and the [[Health Inspector]] into the storeroom when they try to interfere. Near the end, Django is sitting at mini tables located on a hedge of a window behind plants talking with other rats in his son's new restaurant, [[La Ratatouille]].

==Trivia==
*Django's name is only referred to once in the film, while Remy is telling his father about his new living situation, another rat comes over and starts talking with Django, thus interrupting the conversation. Very faintly, the viewer can hear the rat say, "Hey, Django..." and proceeds to tell a joke, which makes him chuckle.
*He shares his name with a spaghetti western hero portraited by Franco Nero, [[Uncle Topolino]]'s voice actor.
*On [[Remy's Ratatouille Adventure]], while Emile does the English safety spiel, Django does the Spanish safety spiel.
