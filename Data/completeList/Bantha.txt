'''Banthas''' are sturdy and easily domesticated beasts of burden that are found all over the galaxy, especially [[Tatooine]]. Banthas are also considered part of [[Tusken Raiders|Tusken]] culture, and often used them as mounts. At maturity, a Tusken raider would bond with a bantha, giving it a life-long partner.

Stuffed Banthas are the Star Wars galaxy equivalent of the [[Wikipedia:Teddy bear|Teddy bear]], with many children in the galaxy owning one.
