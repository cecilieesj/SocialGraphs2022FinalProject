==Role in the [[The Legend of Tarzan|series]]==
In "[[Tarzan and the Flying Ace]]", Nigel was in hot pursuit of Robert, chasing him to the lands of Africa as Robert intended to regain the secret codes he had previously stolen and kept safety hidden with [[Jane Porter]]. They had an aerial battle in the sky, but Robert succeeded in shooting down Nigel's plane. Although his plane was destroyed, Nigel survived and landed safely in the jungle, but found himself stuck in a tree and was later confronted by the panthers, Nuru and Sheeta. He attempted to scare them away by using his gun, but dropped it and was soon attacked. Nigel was almost killed, until Tarzan arrived and saved him. Nigel thanked Tarzan for saving his life, but upon seeing his weapon, Tarzan was suspicious and demanded he identify himself.

Nigel quickly introduced himself to Tarzan and when revealed working for the Queen, Tarzan believed he was Robert's friend and revealed he was already in Africa. Nigel began to inform Tarzan of Robert's true nature, revealing he wasn't a friend, but a scandal. When Tarzan questioned if Nigel was jealous of Robert, Nigel was shocked by his remark and revealed everything Robert had done from betraying England to shooting him out of the sky. Upon learning the truth about Robert and seeing he was right, Tarzan and Nigel went in search him and found Robert escaping into the sky while holding Jane captive. Nigel was angered to see Robert escape yet again, but Tarzan refused to surrender and went in pursuit of Robert and to rescue Jane. Later, Robert was arrested by Nigel and was taken back to England to receive punishment for his crimes.
