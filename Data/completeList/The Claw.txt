'''The Claw''' is a character in the cartoon series ''[[Quack Pack]]''. He is an extremely violent criminal named for the metal claw replacing his hand. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]], in a tone very similar to that of his character [[Dr. Claw]] from the original ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'' cartoon.

==Role in the series==
The Claw first appears in "[[Ready, Aim... Duck!]]" when [[Donald Duck|Donald]] claims that he was responsible for breaking [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews']] video game console (in reality, Donald himself was the one who broke it). This causes The Claw to seek out Donald in anger.

In his second appearance, "[[Long Arm of the Claw]]", The Claw reappears as a fully rehabilitated "good citizen." However, he relapses back into his violent nature whenever he sees gold and calms down only when he hears the sound of a ringing bell.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Long Arm of the Claw]]'', a scene showing him going backwards and forwards into relapsing as him running up to a mountain and waving his arms similar to [[Chernabog]] in [[Fantasia]], then he hears a bell and cowers like Chernabog did.
*In ''[[Long Arm of the Claw]]'', he is very similar to [[Comet Guy]] from ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' as he has super strength and every time he hears a bell he does something peaceful, there's even a scene where he keeps hearing bells and going backwards and forwards into relapsing.
