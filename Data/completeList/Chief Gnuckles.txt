==Background==
===Personality===
Chief Gnuckles is a wise and caring leader. He is also shown to be very understanding and forgiving. He is also very brave. Like all Castle Trolls, he likes to stargaze and loves cave crystals because of how they look and shine like stars.

==Role in the series==
In "[[The Fliegel Has Landed]]", Gnuckles first appears after Teeny bumps into him during a game of hide n' seek. He tells her, Gnarlie, and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] about cave crystals and how they are so rare each troll only gets one. Later, Gnarlie comes to him and tells him about a mean and bossy fliegel named [[Grotta]], how she demanded cave crystals, how she turned Cedric into a salamander, and that she kidnapped Sofia. He conforts Gnarlie and assures him that he and the other trolls will help him confront Grotta and help him rescue Sofia. He and the other trolls go with Gnarlie and proceeds to do just that. After a repentant Grotta undoes everything and apologizes, the trolls become friends with her.
