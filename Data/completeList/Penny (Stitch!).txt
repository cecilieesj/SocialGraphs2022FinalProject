|status = Active}}'''Penny''' ('''Piko''' in the [[Japan]]ese original) is a character from ''[[Stitch!]]''. She is very similar to [[Mertle Edmonds]] from [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]], [[Jessica (Stitch!)|Jessica]] from the third season of ''Stitch!'', and [[Meiying]] from ''[[Stitch & Ai]]''.

==Physical appearance==
Penny is a small white girl with curly blonde hair and blue eyes. She wears pink glasses and a big bow and a pink sleeveless blouse and white pants.

==Role in the series==
She is young girl who lives on a fictional island off the shore of Okinawa in the Ryukyus called [[Izayoi Island]] in [[Japan]]. She is known as [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]]'s rival. She is self-centered, impatient, short-tempered, aggressive and in some cases, a bit snobby. Piko/Penny often takes great pride to mock and deride Yuna and [[Stitch]] in any case, often ending with Yuna and her fighting. This makes her remarkably similar to [[Mertle Edmonds]]. There's rare occasions where she and Yuna can get along though. Her father runs the island's pineapple plantations and her family runs the highest rated hotels and resorts on Izayoi, making her snobbery justifiable.

There's a habit with Piko/Penny where when she's angered, she'll often end her ranting with a comparison of something akin to pineapples. She is also a black-team karate leader. Piko/Penny may have been idealized after Hawaiian pop song Pineapple Princess. Piko/Penny dislikes [[Sasha (Stitch!)|Sae/Sasha]] but secretly does believe that she dresses better than her. Her minions consist of her older brother, [[Kenny (Stitch!)|Kouji/Kenny]] and his friends.

When [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hamsterviel]] pretended to be a nice guy, Penny believed in him and called him her hero and hoped that he would protect her and the island. However, when Hämsterviel chickened out, Penny realized that he was deceiving her and she attacked him on the robot and threatened to follow him for the rest of his life.

==Trivia==
*When [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was in disguise in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]], she pretended to be a girl whose parents own a pineapple factory. This may have been the inspiration for Penny in ''[[Stitch!]]''.
**Coincidentally, Lilo called [[Stitch]] Kenny when he was in disguise, the same name as Penny's [[Kenny (Stitch!)|brother]].
**There is also an [[Experiments#0-Series: Jumba's test batch, including many household helpers|experiment number 071]], also named Penny.
