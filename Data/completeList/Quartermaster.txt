'''Quartermaster''' is a character who appears in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''. He is an undead crewman who serves as one of [[Blackbeard]]'s undead crew members in a plan to seek the [[Fountain of Youth]].

==Background==
As his name implies, Quartermaster serves as one of the crewmen of the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard|Edward Teach]] (aka "Blackbeard"). Like the rest of the pirates in Blackbeard's crew, Quartermaster is a zombie working alongside the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' under command of Blackbeard.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===
Onboard the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Quartermaster is shown to have been zombified by Blackbeard's dark magic, just like all the other officers in Blackbeard's crew. During mutiny on the ''Revenge'', Quartermaster fought against the human crew to which [[Jack Sparrow]] defeats him throughout the mutiny until [[Blackbeard]] shows up just as Quartermaster and the crew members gaze upon Blackbeard. After Blackbeard unleashes Greek fire on the Cook, Quartermaster took Jack to Blackbeard's cabin, forcing Jack to help find the Fountain of Youth. 

Arriving at Whitecap Bay, Quartermaster and the rest of the undead crewmen stop by to capture a mermaid as part of Blackbeard's plan for the ritual to which the crew of the ''Revenge'' were able to capture one named "[[Syrena]]" with help from Philip Swift to bring the mermaid for the ritual. Quartermaster and the rest of the undead crewmen travel across a jungle following Blackbeard to the Fountain of Youth with Syrena being carried on a glass coffin. Philip Swift desperately attempts to open the coffin to give Syrena air, but Quartermaster prevents him from doing so, believing that the mermaid could escape, to which the missionary grabs his machete and opens the lid for Syrena to breathe much to the crewman's angry stare. Angelica later gives Quartermaster the Jack Sparrow voodoo doll and throws it off the canyon just as Jack risks himself to jump in order to escape from Blackbeard's crew just as the crew continues proceeding to the Fountain. Ultimately, the coffin with Syrena inside shatters much to the zombies noticing of what happened to the mermaid just as Phillip saves her life, just as Quartermaster grabs his cutlass while preparing to stop Phillip, only for the undead crewman's attack to be cancelled. Quartermaster and the rest of the crew continue proceeding to find the Fountain of Youth and to help prepare for the ritual by getting a tear from Syrena to which Blackbeard was able to obtain a tear via chalice.

The next day, Quartermaster leads the crew to a cavern to seek the Fountain of Youth to which upon arriving, the crew notices the water phenomenon in the cavern to which the crew notices Jack getting pulled up to find himself at the Fountain of Youth. Furthermore, [[Hector Barbossa]] leads the British to fight against Blackbeard to which Quartermaster participates during battle between the British and the undead crewmen. The battle suddenly pauses when the Spanish army arrives at the Fountain as the [[Spaniard]] and his men prepare to destroy the Fountain, much to Quartermaster and Gunner's worry and noticing what the soldiers are doing. Ultimately after Blackbeard's death, Quartermaster dies along with the other zombies.
