At the wedding, due to the arrival of [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who unintentionally revealed that Experiment 032 ([[Fibber]]) is a lie detector, Pixley was the first to call out what Gantu said. Upon hearing the truth, the family were upset, Pixley was upset that they traveled two million miles for nothing and blaming him for losing days of importing work, however, Fibber beeped at all their lies, revealing the family doesn't hate him, in their moment of honesty, Pixley admitted Pleakley's creative and was jealous of him, she felt inferior to him her whole life, the reason she's CEO was because she was trying to be better than him only to get a " high-powered career, a custom shoe closet, and bone-sheering loneliness", its also revealed that Pixley's career was caused by their mother, who admitted she pushed her children too hard all because she wanted them to be happy. Though, Pleakley tells them that he is happy with his family. They than made amends with each other and left.
