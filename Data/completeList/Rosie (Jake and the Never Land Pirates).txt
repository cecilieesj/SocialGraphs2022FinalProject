'''Rosie''' is a small, white kitten belonging to the pirate [[Red Jessica]]. Her vocal effects are provided by [[Russi Taylor]].

==Role in the Series==
Rosie first appeared in the episode, "[[Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty]]". In this episode, [[Red Jessica]] called for [[Captain Hook]]'s presence, much to the lovestruck captain's delight. He was quickly disappointed, however, when he learned the meeting wasn't romantically centered, but instead a request to cat-sit! Red Jessica had to set sail and run some errands on the sea, but Rosie is terrified of water. Red Jessica convinces Hook to watch over her kitten while she's away. But no sooner than Red Jessica departure, Captain Hook loses Rosie in the jungle, so with the help of both his and [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]]'s crew, they all searched for and tried to find Rosie before Red Jessica got back. When Red Jessica returned, she was delighted to see that Hook has taken a liking to her kitten, and decided to introduce him to her other "kitty," her tiger [[Sasha (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Sasha]].

Rosie reappears in the episode "[[Pirate Pals!]]" Captain Hook and [[Mr. Smee]] pay Red Jessica a visit on [[Crimson Isle]]. Much to Hook's surprise, he and Smee are not the only pirates to pay Red Jessica a visit. That sneaky, plundering pirate [[Beatrice Le Beak]] has returned, and she has her eyes on Red Jessica's treasured art collection.

Rosie returns in the episode "[[Smee-erella]]." Rosie played a damsel in distress during the first event in Red Jessica's Pirate Convention festivities. [[Sharky and Bones]] were the first contested to try to rescue the adorable kitten but the two musical pirates failed, much to the amusement of Rosie. Next, it was [[Mr. Smee]] under the disguise as the swashbuckling "Buck Buccaneer" turn to rescue the kitten, but jealous Captain Hook armed with his Grappling hook- hook was determined to make Buck a fool in front of Red Jessica. Jake and his crew alert Smee of Hook's plot and Smee successfully rescues Rosie, winning the first event at the pirate convention.
