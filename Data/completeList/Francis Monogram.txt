'''Francis Monogram''' (or '''Major Monogram''' as he prefers to be called, due to the fact that people often tease him about his first name)<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0138954/</ref> is a supporting character of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. He is [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]]'s commanding officer, and gives him his mission in each episode. Helping him transmit the messages is his intern [[Carl Karl|Carl]]. Since the third season, he doesn't hate being called Francis.
==Biography==
When Francis Monogram was five years old, he wanted a pony for Christmas. He was, however, not given this wish. This caused Major Monogram to have a grudge against [[Santa Claus]], which carries all through his life. At a young age, he was forced to attend a place known only as "The Academy", which traumatized him. He was forced to go there by a person he assumed to be his father, but on the day he was told he was going to the academy, he told him he was not. He still, obliviously, thought of him as his "daddy", probably a stepfather, or he still believed it was his father.

Major Monogram currently holds the title of major and head of his branch of The O.W.C.A., a secret, all-animal organization. He transmits messages to [[Perry the Platypus]] (Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus), as Carl, his scrawny, red-headed intern, films and transmits it. An interesting quirk he now has is that he almost never wears pants as he briefs [[Perry the Platypus]], though he does when he is on the field. This appears to be because of the importance of professionalism.

When he transmits messages to Agent P, he is wearing a wig. He is bald, and his mustache is also a fake.Recently, his old age has been getting to him. A great example can be the simple fact of his back going out, causing him to be unable to do his work for the day. This caused his intern, Carl, to do it for him.

==Relationships==
===Carl Karl===
Monogram and Carl have an interesting relationship. Carl seems to look up to him, and Monogram often acts superior. He once made Carl sit in a corner, and he belittles Carl quite regularly. However, on one occasion, when Carl won a bet, Monogram was forced to give him a massage, among other things.

Monogram does things around Carl, like not wearing trousers while on camera, or wearing a clown outfit, that he feels embarrassed doing around other people, including Agent P. At Christmas, when Carl got Monogram a framed picture of them both, Monogram gave Carl a signed picture of himself with 'To whom it may concern' written on it.

Major Monogram and Carl have somewhat of a parent-child relationship. They went shopping together in "[[Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)]]", with Carl sitting in the child's seat of the shopping cart. In "[[The Beak]]", when they were forced to go undercover, Major Monogram dressed as a woman and pushed Carl (wearing a diaper) around in a baby stroller.

Once, when Monogram forgot that it was Passive-Aggressive Relationship Day, Carl displayed that the two had a passive-aggressive relationship, saying "It's okay, you probably weren't going to get me anything anyway..."

===Perry the Platypus===
{{Main|Perry the Platypus}}
Monogram seems to think a lot of Perry. He is very formal with him and has always called him Agent P when others call him Perry. However, sometimes he calls him Perry ("[[Phineas and Ferb-Busters!]]")

He thinks of Agent P as the Agency's best agent. In "Cheer Up Candace", he stated that Agent P was "nothing less but the best in his field". Also in "[[Cheer Up Candace]]", he felt terrible, even cried slightly, when he was under the impression that Agent P had gone rogue. He sometimes believes he is too rough on Agent P, though perhaps only because Carl misled him to think so ("[[Thaddeus and Thor]]").

Monogram and Carl enjoy playing pranks on Perry. In "[[Boyfriend From 27,000 B.C.]]", they played a prank on him that involved Agent P dressing up as a magpie when going to his lair, Also, in "[[Jerk De Soleil]]", Agent P showed up for his mission in a ridiculous circus outfit that Phineas had dressed him in. Major Monogram laughed at him and when he tried to leave while he still had a shred of dignity left, tricked him into turning around so he could take a picture to send to Carl. And only once did he call him by his full name, Agent Perry the Platypus. ("[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]")

===Rest of the O.W.C.A. Agents===
Not much is known about his relationship with them, as we only see him debriefing Perry the Platypus, and he has never been shown having a direct conversation with any of them (except for Agent W), but he once hinted that Agent T (Turkey) for Thanksgiving dinner. At one point, he wonders why all the agents are animals. They may have the same relationship as he and Perry. In one interview Monogram revealed that he doesn't know why all the agents are animals but Carl yes because he is the one that does the things of having new agents.

He was known to have three non-animal agents [[Norm]] (fired), Planty the Potted Plant (fate is unknown) and when Doofenshmirtz went to the good side until he was fired because of Agent D making complaints from Human Resources. He is also shown to look down on the agent. One example of this is when Carl sent the animals on their mission during a seminar. Major Monogram called himself superior causing all the agent that were there to turn around and growl at him. ("[[La Candace-Cabra]]")

===Heinz Doofenshmirtz===
Monogram and Doofenshmirtz participated in a radio interview to promote the release of the soundtrack and hosted a music clip show. Though fairly friendly most of the time, the two do poke fun at one another a lot, especially when Doofenshmirtz finds out Monogram's first name. ("2009 Radio Disney premiere", "[[Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown]]")

They do seem to know a lot about each other, as Dr. Doofenshmirtz knows Monogram's phone number ("[[Hide and Seek (Phineas and Ferb)|Hide and Seek]]"). Doofenshmirtz has even nicknamed Major Monogram "Monobrow" because of his uni-brow. ("[[Spa Day]]")

Monogram also makes an appearance in the first episode of the Phineas and Ferb Podcast on iTunes, appearing with Doofenshmirtz, Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, speaking about what's coming up for the Christmas special.

In spite of their rivalry, the two do seem to respect each other. At one time, Doofenshmirtz genuinely thanks, Monogram (and Perry) for helping him rescue his daughter [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz|Vanessa]]. ("[[Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!]]") Also, Monogram genuinely thanks Doofenshmirtz for saving the world from the threat of the maniacal [[Aloyse von Roddenstein|Rodney]]. ("[[Phineas and Ferb Save Summer]]")

===Mrs. Monogram===
Major Monogram is married and goes on date nights with his wife. His wife's name has not yet been identified ("[[Chez Platypus]]," "[[The Ballad of Badbeard]]"). However, during a briefing for a joint mission in London, Monogram flirted with Inspector Initials. ("[[Elementary My Dear Stacy]]")

===Monty Monogram===
Major Monogram's son is Monty Monogram ("[[Minor Monogram]]"). It is known that Major Monogram wanted his son to become an acrobat because that was his dream, but after seeing his son combine fighting evil with acrobatics, then he allows Monty to fight evil. Monty also dates Vanessa Doofenshmirtz, whom is Heinz Doofenshmirtz (his enemy) Monty hides about dating Vanessa to his father because of the facts already given. However, his son, Monty, is at least 16, meaning that they either had him before they were married, or that they've actually been married for longer.

==Other Appearances==
===Phineas and Ferb and Phineas and Ferb Ride Again===
He is a minor character in the games.

===Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension===
Monogram tells Perry to go to [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] at [[Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated]]. He is seen again when the main characters get back to their home dimension, and when the kids, Jeremy, Stacy, and Candace have to lose their memories to avoid Perry being relocated.
