==Role in the film==
Bridget is a feisty, wisecracking giraffe and [[Benny (The Wild)|Benny]]'s love interest. She is also the only female in the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]] group. Bridget is insecure and easily pampered. She isÂ quick-witted and wants to be seen as strong and independent. Bridget is also witty and noted for her great sarcasm. She respects [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] and is good friends with [[Larry (The Wild)|Larry]]. She finds [[Nigel (The Wild)|Nigel]] annoying at times (but is also his friend), and loves [[Ryan]] like her own cub. She at first finds Benny super irritating and boring, but when Benny falls off the garbage truck, she shows great concern. At the film's climax, she later warms up to Benny and finally kisses him, which makes Benny shocked and happy. Bridget is often noted for her beauty both inside and out, quoted as a goddess by Nigel.
