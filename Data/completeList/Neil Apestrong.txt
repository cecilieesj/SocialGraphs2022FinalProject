===[[Randy Cunningham]]===
Randy and Apestrong seem to be on good terms. It was shown twice that Neil helped Randy (as the Ninja both times) to defeat a huge invasion or save a innocent person.

==Trivia==
*He is named after the famous astronaut Neil Armstrong, who actually did go to the moon.
*He can communicate with other apes, like how he talks to the Robo-Apes in "Rise of the Planet of the Robo-Apes".
