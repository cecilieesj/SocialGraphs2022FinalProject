==Appearances==
===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]''===
Sharga appeared in the  episodes ''[[The Great Sebastian]]'' and ''[[King Crab (episode)|King Crab]]''. When King Triton is thinking of making peace with the Sharkanians, he warns his advisor that making peace with said creatures can be very difficult due to them being dangerous where their leader Sharga is cunning and Sebastian must be careful of encountering him where Sebastian must travel to Sharkania to make peace with them in Atlantica.

Meanwhile is Sharkania, Sebastian, Ariel, and Flounder work together to find and talk to Sharga to make peace with his soldiers. Arriving, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian follow one of Emperor Sharga's guards to meet their leader. When Sebastian arrives, Sharga talks to him about being hungry despite being on a diet just like Sebastian who tries to offer him crab candy. Too nervous to continue talking with Emperor Sharga, Ariel talks to him about Sebastian being sent by King Triton to make peace conference with him and the Atlanticans.

Ariel then encourages Sebastian that it is time to do his speech to make peace with Sharga and his soldiers.
