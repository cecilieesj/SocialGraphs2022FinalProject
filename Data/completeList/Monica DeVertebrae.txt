}}'''Monica DeVertebrae''' is the [[Apatosaurus]] who lives next door to the Sinclairs on ''[[Dinosaurs]].'' She was voiced by Suzie Plakson and puppeteered by [[Julianne Buescher]].

==Role in the series==
Introduced in the second season episode "[[Unmarried... with Children]]", Monica is a career woman, a real estate agent selling the house next door.

Monica also holds the distinction of being the first dinosaur to divorce her husband, deciding not to renew her marriage license. As a four-legged dinosaur (only her neck and head are ever shown), she often encounters racial prejudice.

[[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] generally thinks of Monica as a radical, filling [[Frances Sinclair|Fran]]'s mind with wild ideas about independence. Her strong will and refusal to let dinosaur misogyny affect her role in the workplace led to the "Sexual Harris" hearings in "[[What "Sexual" Harris Meant|What 'Sexual Harris' Meant]]". [[Roy Hess]] has a crush on her and in "[[Green Card]]", they briefly marry so Monica can stay in [[Pangaea]].

Monica was the only "film-style" bodiless puppet on set, requiring a team of 4-5 puppeteers to operate the massive cables needed to move her neck joints, steady the fulcrum and roll her in and out of the window.
