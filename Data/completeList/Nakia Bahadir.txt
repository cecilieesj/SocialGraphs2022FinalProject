[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x01 - Generation Why - Nakia, Bruno and Kamala.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Nakia meets up with [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] and Kamala at school. She earns ten dollars, after betting against Bruno, that Kamala would fail her driving test, and she quickly apologizes as he hands her the money, insisting she loves Kamala. The three walk together down the hallway, and Bruno asks whether she has any plans for the weekend, but Nakia expresses how she'll be busy, if she's being invited over, to play ''Super Smash Bros'', as she hates the game. While walking up the stairs, Kamala bumps into [[Zoe Zimmer|Zoe]]. After a quick and awkward exchange between the pair, Kamala wonders if they should ask Zoe to drive them to AvengerCon, as her mother used to drive them from school. Nakia quickly dismisses the idea, citing her declining behavior, resulted by her growing social media following. As the three continue walking, Kamala is called by [[Mr. Wilson]], through the school intercom, and Nakia and Bruno tease that she is in trouble.

During a game of volleyball, Zoe smacks the ball in Kamala's face. Nakia accuses her of doing it on purpose, but Zoe denies it. She later hands Kamala an ice pack for her nose, in the locker room.

At school, Nakia joins Bruno and Kamala, who are walking down the hallways, and learns that Zoe has gained a large following online, after she was rescued by a superhero at AvengerCon. She criticizes Zoe, for her self-centered attitude, and sits down with her friends, as they overhear Zoe deciding to throw a house party. They initially refuse to go, but after the new senior, [[Kamran]] confirms he will be attending, they change their minds.

Later on, Nakia and Kamala sprint to the mosque, after running late, and quickly put their shoes in the rack, so they can perform ablution, and join the others. Nakia finds that her tap isn't working, and is forced to share with Kamala, when a tile falls, by their feet. They enter women's section, and after they finish praying, Nakia comments on the disparity between the way men and women of the mosque section is maintained. When [[Sheikh Abdullah]] reminds those in attendance that nominations for the Mosque Board are open, Kamala suggests she join the campaign. Upon returning to collect their shoes, Nakia finds that hers have been stolen. Nakia is uncertain whether she should run for the Mosque Board, but Kamala convinces her to run, so Nakia decides that Kamala will be her campaign manager.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x02 - Crushed - Miguel, Nakia, Kamala and Bruno.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
On Friday night, Nakia attends Zoe's party, and runs into [[Miguel]], who keeps following her around. Kamala arrives with Bruno, and she informs her friend that Miguel keeps hovering. When Kamala is tricked into drinking alcohol, Nakia is ready to leave the party, but Miguel encourages them to stay. At that moment, they see an individual standing atop of a roof and flip into the pool. He climbs out, and it's revealed to be the new senior, Kamran, who walks over into Nakia and Kamala's direction, to retrieve his shirt. The girls become smitten with him, and introduce themselves. At that moment, the incoming sound of sirens arrive, and the partygoers become altered to the arrival of the police. Kamran offers to drive a few of them, and Nakia joins him alongside Kamala, Bruno, [[Paul (Ms. Marvel)|Paul]] and Miguel. Nakia sits in the back seat, while Kamala sits in the front, next to Kamran. When he offers to give Kamala the chance to drive, Bruno comments that she failed her test, causing Nakia to slap him. She smiles to herself, as she watches Kamran and Kamala bond over mutual interests, and when they're dropped off at Circle Q, she watches on, as Kamran gives Kamala his phone number for future driving lessons.

After their class ends, Nakia vents about the topic of the subject of the topic they're being taught, when Kamala rushes to the bathroom. She goes after her, and offers a tampon, assuming Kamala's facing issues with her menstruation. Kamala declines the offer, and Nakia notes the strange behavior her friend has displayed, over the past few days. When Kamala does come out, she talks about how she she feels overwhelmed with the various changes she's been going through. Nakira relates, referencing her parents awkwardness after she began wearing a hijab and started developing. Kamala asks how Nakia makes it look so easy, and she admits that it isn't, but began to feel empowered and found a purpose, after wearing her hijab. The two girls express their love for each other, and Nakia hands Kamala a new top and earrings for her upcoming driving lesson with Kamran.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x02 - Crushed - Photography - Yusuf and Nakia.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Nakia begins her campaign to secure votes for the election board, at the Eid Al-Adha festival. She begins with [[Najaf]] and promises to make him the exclusive catering vendor for all masjid holidays and special events. She meets up with Kamala and Bruno, and hands them fliers, so they can convince the various cliques attending, to vote for her. She herself, heads into [[Yusuf Khan|Yusuf]]'s direction, and when he informs Nakia that he'd likely be voting for his best friend, [[Uncle Rasheed|Rasheed]], Nakia uses the prospects of her future as a woman, and relationship with Kamala to convince him otherwise, comparing herself to his second daughter.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x02 - Crushed - Nakia and Bruno.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Nightfall arrives, and Nakia and the others in attendance of the Festival, are alerted to the screams of [[Hameed]], who has fallen out of the mosque tower, and holding onto a curtain, attached to the window. She and others watch in horror, as he hangs for his life, when the heroine Night Light arrives. She witnesses Night Light create energy platforms below her feet, to walk towards Hameed, but fears she won't reach him in time. Hameed falls, but Night Light creates a construct mid air, which the pair land on, to Nakia's relief, and the crowd erupt in applause. Before Hameed can safely climb onto the roof, the construct he stands on, shatters. Night Light creates smaller constructs below him, to cushion his fall and lessen the impact, but the young boy injures himself, after crashing on the hood of a car, to Nakia's shock.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Nakia and Abdullah.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
During the vote counting, [[Sadie Deever|Agent Sadie Deever]] of the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]] and her men, enter the mosque, after getting reports that Night Light was operating from within the building. She orders the men to search the premise, but Nakia intervenes, and introduces herself as a mosque board member, even though she has not yet been elected. She shares that they are not permitted to enter the building without a signed warrant. Deever warms of the seriousness of the matter, and advises Sheikh Abdullah to cooperate, but Nakia questions if their concern is based on the person of interest being enhanced, or because she was spotted in a mosque. The agents leave, and Nakia is officially elected as a member of the Mosque Board. 

Nakia enters Kamala's room and slumps on the bed, upset by her recent interactions with Damage Control. Kamala wants to share something with Nakia, but before she can do so, Nakia snaps, and blames the hero Night Light, who is currently displayed on Kamala's monitor. She recounts what happened with the agents to Kamala, annoyed that the hero doesn't seem to care, while they've been placed under target. She also shares that she has been elected as a board member of the mosque and Kamala congratulates her.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Nakia Learns Truth.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The day of [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] and [[Tyesha Hillman|Tyesha]]'s wedding arrive, and Nakia is among those in attendance. They go to a venue to celebrate, and she, Kamala and Bruno also participate in a dance together. During their celebrations, the fire alarm is triggered, and Nakia is forced to exit the building, along with the other guests. When Damage Control arrive and storm the building, Nakia explores the back, where she finds Kamala exiting with Bruno, who appears to be injured. She witnesses Kamala create a construct to shut the door, and realizes her best friend is Night Light. Nakia is upset that Kamala never told her, but Bruno urges Kamala to leave as the agents are after. Nakia hands Kamala the scarf she dropped, as she makes an exit, and Kamala promises she'll explain everything to her. Nakia questions what just happened, while supporting a limping Bruno, away from building.

Following the revelation, Nakia receives multiple texts from Kamala, asking to speak to her, all of which, Nakia ignores.
