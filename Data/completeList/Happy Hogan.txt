'''Harold "Happy" Hogan''' is [[Anthony Stark|Tony Stark]]'s chauffeur, bodyguard, and friend, who is now the head of security of [[Stark Industries]]. He first appeared in ''Iron Man'' film, and later its two sequels: ''Iron Man 2'' and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', and in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''.

Harold Hogan was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Don Heck.

==Background==
===Personality===
Contrary to what his nickname suggests, Happy is actually cynical and dry. He takes his job and skills seriously, and almost with great pride, and becomes humiliated at times when he is beaten by opponents with greater skill than himself (Natasha Romanoff in combat or Tony Stark in-car driving). With his cohorts, however, he shows a more positive side - that of a loyal friend and a good partner, always ready to take any risk to protect [[Anthony Stark|Tony Stark]] and [[Pepper Potts]]. More of a friend than an employee, Happy always has Tony's back too, even when the eccentric billionaire doesn't think he needs him. Steadfast and loyal, Happy would do anything to keep Pepper and Tony safe. Although rude at times, he is willing to apologize when he is proven to be in the wrong.

==Appearances==
===''Iron Man''===
Harold Hogan, commonly called "Happy", is [[Anthony Stark|Tony Stark]]'s personal chauffeur and bodyguard, and one of his closest friends. He often encourages Tony's excesses, as seen when he challenges his boss in a race from Stark's mansion to the airport, where [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] is waiting for their arrival to take Stark in Afghanistan for the promotion of the new [[Stark Industries]]' weapons. He stays with his boss during all of his adventures, but he only acknowledges his secret identity of Iron Man during Stark's communication to press after the incident with the Iron Monger.

===''Iron Man 2''===
[[File:HappyHogan-IM2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Happy Hogan, Stark employee]]
Happy Hogan is still at [[Anthony Stark|Tony Stark]]'s employment and has added to his routine duties even the assistance to his superhero identity. He's initially seen sparring with Tony inside his mansion, in a boxing ring built in one of the many rooms. During their training, Pepper introduces one of the candidates for the role of Stark's personal assistant, [[Black Widow|Natasha Rushman]]. Impressed by the girl's curriculum, Tony asks Natasha to spar with Happy, but the bodyguard is quite humiliated when she annihilates him with a single, quick acrobatic move.

Happy accompanies Tony to Montecarlo, where the playboy enjoys himself in racing in the Gran Prix. During the race, [[Whiplash]] attacks him, and Happy, along with Pepper, intervenes, bringing the new armor to Tony. Happy too is attacked by the villain, but, once dressed up with the armor, Iron Man saves him.

When Whiplash' connection with Justin Hammer is revealed and Hammer Drones go on a rampage during the Stark Expo, Happy follows Natasha Rushman, aka the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Black Widow, to Hammer's base in which Whiplash is hiding, controlling the drones. Happy engages a fight with one of Hammer's guards, managing to defeat him after a long battle, only to realize that Black Widow has defeated all the others by herself in no time. Along with her, anyway, Happy manages to interfere with Whiplash' plans, even if he already fled away and assists Iron Man and War Machine in their battle against the Russian villain.

===''[[Iron Man 3]]''===
Happy is promoted to Head of Security at [[Stark Industries]]. When [[Aldrich Killian]] comes to visit Pepper, Happy suspects [[Eric Savin]] and decides to follow him to the Chinese Theatre where Savin meets Jack Taggart to deliver a batch of Extremis. Happy later bumps into Taggart, causing him to drop his case. Savin stops Happy but Taggart explodes from the Extremis, giving Happy several injuries and hospitalizing him.

Tony visits Happy in hospital and told the nurse not to turn the TV off because Downton Abbey was Happy's favorite show. After seeing what had happened to Happy, Tony decides to get revenge on The Mandarin. Happy later wakes up from the coma.

===''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''===
Happy appears in a recording depicting him "chaperoning" [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] on his trip to Germany and giving him his Spider-suit during ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. After returning to New York, Happy continues to be Peter's contact, albeit unenthusiastically, in which he received updates on Peter's crime-fighting and sent this information to Tony.

Happy is later promoted to the asset manager and is assigned in allocating all the items from [[Avengers Tower]] to [[New Avengers Facility]]. He oversees the items loaded into the cargo plane on moving day when he suddenly receives a message from [[Ned Leeds]], who tries to warn him that the plane is in danger, but Happy ignores the warning. During the takeoff, the plane gets hijacked by the Vulture. However, Spider-Man intervenes and the plane crashes into [[Coney Island]] beach following their battle. Arriving at the crash site with the FBI, Happy finds Adrian Toomes restrained on the side of a car with a note from Spider-Man. Realizing that Peter was right about the Vulture, Happy appears at his school later to personally apologize for ignoring him. He then brings Peter to New Avengers Facility where [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] invites Peter to the Avengers. However, Peter declines and leaves to wait in the car, expecting Happy to drive him home. It turns out that Tony intended to announce [[Spider-Man]] to the world at a press conference behind the room. As [[Pepper Potts]] tries to cover for the reporters, Tony haphazardly asks Happy for the engagement ring he carries to announce a proposal to Pepper for a last-minute scenario.

===''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''===
Although Happy does not appear in the final movie, he is seen in a deleted scene where he confronts both Tony and Pepper in Central Park, about being stressed out after having to keep their wedding out of the tabloids.

===''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''===
Happy attends Tony's funeral and comforts his daughter Morgan. Happy asks Morgan what she wants to eat and after she says cheeseburgers, Happy tells her that Tony loved cheeseburgers.

===''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''===
In ''Far from Home'', Happy gives Peter much needed support in the aftermath of Tony's sacrifice telling him that even Tony could never live up to what people excepted of him. Happy acts as a father-figure to Peter during the movie and looks out for him, replacing Tony Stark in that role. Happy helps Peter build a new suit to fight Mysterio and rescues his friends. Happy also has a flirtatious, unofficial relationship with Peter's [[Aunt May]].

===''[[What If...?]]''===
Happy appears in episode 5, "[[What If... Zombies!?]]", voiced by [[Jon Favreau]], and helps [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] film a video. Happy is later infected by the zombie outbreak and is turned into zombie, which saddens Peter as he has already lost his parents, [[Aunt May]], [[Ben Parker|Uncle Ben]], [[Iron Man|Tony]], and now Happy.

He reappears in episode 6, "[[What If... Killmonger Rescued Tony Stark?]]".

===''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''===
[[File:Spider-Man No Way Home - Happy Hogan.png|thumb|Happy witnesses Peter morn the death of his aunt.]]
Happy is first seen speaking to [[Aunt May|May]] about their fling and is seen not taking their break up very well. Happy hears Peter and MJ and walks into the young Avenger's room, only to find Peter half dressed, believing that he and MJ are sleeping together. When the government are after Peter, Happy takes him and May to his house to keep them safe and allows them to stay there. Happy's house is later destroyed when Peter must fight the [[Green Goblin]], who is taking over Norman Osborn's body, and Happy later finds a heartbroken Peter crying over the corpse of Aunt May, who was killed by the Green Goblin. After [[Doctor Strange]] does a spell where everyone forgets who Peter Parker is, Happy is seen at May's grave with Peter and comforts him, but has no idea who the young man is. Happy tells Peter about losing [[Iron Man|a friend recently]] and tells him to look after himself before walking off.
