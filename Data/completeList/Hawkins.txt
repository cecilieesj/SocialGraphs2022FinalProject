'''Hawkins''' is the player character of the ''[[Muppet Treasure Island (video game)|Muppet Treasure Island]]'' CD-ROM game. In the game, [[Jim Hawkins (Muppet Treasure Island)|Jim Hawkins]] is only referred to as "Hawkins," and the character's gender is never referenced, so that both male and female players feel that the characters are addressing them directly.

Because the player takes the role of this character, "Hawkins" is never seen on screen, apart from brief mirror shots of the protagonist's torso below the head (kept suitably generic and unisex).
