==Background==
===Physical Description===
Mooch is an {{WikipediaLink|Old English Sheepdog}} who also lives in [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]] with the other dogs. He is fairly dim-witted but enthusiastic.

===Personality===
Mooch has a good heart, but [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]] doesn't see much use for him other than to crash through fences so he can get through (as Buster was incapable of unlocking gates by himself). Mooch has only but heard tales of [[Tramp]], and they're pretty exaggerated. He eventually leaves the junkyard with the other junkyard dogs, minus Buster, and gets adopted by a family.

==Trivia==
*He bears a similarity to [[Prince Eric]]'s dog, [[Max (The Little Mermaid)|Max]], as they are both the same breed.
*His personality is very similar to [[w:c:spongebob:Patrick Star|Patrick Star]] from ''{{WikipediaLink|SpongeBob SquarePants}}'', another character voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]].
