'''Dennis the Bunny''', nicknamed "'''Mr. Cutie Patootie'''" by [[Candace Flynn|Candace]], is a rabbit and a former agent of the [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|O.W.C.A.]] who went rogue and attempted to hack into the mainframe of the organization. According to [[Francis "Major" Monogram|Major Monogram]], he is a mercenary for hire and master of disguise, proven by several images of Dennis that are sinister, followed by his harmless "mindless animal" look.

==History==
In order to gain access to the Flynn-Fletcher household and, by extension, Perry's Lair and the O.W.C.A. mainframe, he lets Candace see him. She immediately attempted to adopt him. Candace used him as a living doll for dress-up and taught him a couple of tricks, inadvertently showing his obsession with carrots. [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda]] spots [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]] and Dennis fighting, but on her double-take, sees both posing as mindless animals. She seems unconcerned that Candace has adopted a pet without her consent. He ultimately reveals his true nature as a feral and clever rabbit  during his battle with Perry. He was defeated by Agent P, whose lair he had infiltrated to hack into the organization, and taken into captivity by the O.W.C.A. ("[[No More Bunny Business]]").

However sometime later Dennis escaped from O.W.C.A maximum security prison with Dr. Doofenshmirtz's help, who was aware of Dennis's past as a criminal and mercenary and offered him an alliance where Dennis would help Doofenshmirtz to defeat Perry and take over the Tri-State with technology provided by the mad scientist, to which Dennis -eager to get revenge on Perry- agreed without a second thought. Soon Doofenshmirtz gave him a backpack which could transform in a robotic suit, and soon found Perry, who began battling the bunny with a giant marionette, and their fight soon got them to fall into the sea, where Dennis was trapped inside his robot and almost drowned, but Perry rescued him and both swan to the docks, where Perry attempted to arrest him, but was interrupted by Candace who recognized Dennis. However Major Monogram and Carl arrived in disguise, claiming to be Dennis's owners to Candace, who reluctantly returns to them, and Major Monogram said they were returning Dennis to his "special room", thus returning him to prison. ("[[The Return of the Rogue Rabbit]]").

==Background Information==
*Like many rabbits, Dennis has a strong fondness for carrots and has even interrupted his mission in order to eat carrots, which eventually leads to his capture. He eats so many carrots that he cannot fight back when Agent P handcuffs him.
*Dennis growls as his only vocalization, reminiscent of Agent P's own chatter foreshadowing his true nature.
*Carl dresses up as him while he tries on disguises ("[[Undercover Carl]]") but there is a color error because he is mistakenly pink.
*It could be that he is an allusion to [[w:c:jamesbond:Alec Trevelyan|Alec Trevelyan]] from the James Bond movie ''GoldenEye''.
*He also has a "mindless-pet mode" like Perry and [[Pinky]].
*He was mentioned by Candace in the game based on [[Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension (video game)|''Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the Second Dimension'']].
*He is one of the only known agents to have a name that is not an alliteration, such as Perry the Platypus, or Peter the Panda. Pinky the Chihuahua is not alliterative either.
*He can dance very well, being able to do "the Worm" and "the Robot" ("[[No More Bunny Business]]").
*He returns for a second time in the series ("[[The Return of the Rogue Rabbit]]").
*Like Perry and Pinky, Dennis doesn't "talk."
[[File:O.W.C.A. agents injured by Dennis.png|thumb|right|Two O.W.C.A. agents injured after fighting Dennis]]
*Dennis is skilled in fighting to the point that he injured current O.W.C.A agents D and O, leaving them with a arm sling and a leg cast respectively.
