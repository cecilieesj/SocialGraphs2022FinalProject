}}'''Cannonball''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'', played by Charlie Heaton. He is a [[Mutants|mutant]] with the ability to become an unstoppable ball of wrecking energy while also being invulnerable.

Cannonball was created by Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod.
==Background==
Samuel "Sam" Guthrie is a young boy from [[Kentucky]]. He had a close bond with his family who were coal miners. Sam eventually got a chance to work with his father, Thomas, and his fellow miners one day, but the unfamiliar environment and claustrophobia, caused him to suddenly cause a cave in with his explosive jet propulsive mutant powers. Sam was the only survivor and found himself on the run from authorities. He was found by Dr. [[Cecilia Reyes]] who offered him a safe haven at the hospital she was keeping other Mutants with uncontrollable abilities in the hopes that he can somehow master his powers.

Sam started to train and control his abilities by strapping himself to a harness tied to an anchor and flying around in the courtyard; resulting in him getting slightly injured and bruised. He becomes the first to experience the strange visions and begins to suspect that they have something to do with his inability to control himself and starts to panic.

Sam soon finds himself having to overcome his insecurities when he instills in [[ Magik|Illyana Rasputin]] the gumption to overcome the ferocious Smile Men. When the [[Demon Bear]] arrives, he protects his friend [[Mirage (Marvel)|Danielle Moonstar]] and eventually decides to fight the creature telling [[Wolfsbane|Rahne Sinclair]] "Gotta get better some day." After Dani defeated the Demon Bear, Sam notices that he barrier protecting the hospital is gone (Dr. Reyes was killed earlier) and he and the rest of his friends step out onto the road to find a new home.

=== Abilities ===
* '''Jet propulsion''': Sam has the ability to charge up his inert energy and blast off into the air like a cannonball. He has limited control over what direction he can go and apparently has trouble landing.
* '''Durability''': Sam can become durable, but only when he is in flight. He reverts to normal when he lands; hence the broken arm and bruises he has.

== Trivia ==
* Cannonball was supposed to appear in ''Deadpool'', but was replaced by Negasonic Teenage Warhead due to the characters eye-catching name.
* Cannonball's creator, Bob McLeod, was unhappy that the character was not "tall and gawky" like in the comics, though he did like Charlie Heaton's performance.
