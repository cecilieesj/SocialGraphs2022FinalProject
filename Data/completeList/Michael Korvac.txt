Korvac was a normal human, until whilst driving through a mountain area when he was taken by the [[Kree]], and experimented with him for a long time, which gave Korvac incredible destructive powers, which he used to destroy the Kree ship and escape. Korvac then used his power to destroy other things; a space-station, an inhabited planet, etc. enjoying it, and returned to Earth.

The [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] try to catch him, but couldn't with his powers.

He landed in Central Park, creating a crater, claiming to being pursued by aliens. The police take him to the [[Avengers]]. After [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] brought his wife, Corrina Walters, to the Avengers Mansion to be with him, the Guardians of the Galaxy appeared in search of Korvac.

Hearing Michael Korvac's pleas, the Avengers fought the Guardians as Michael escaped along Wasp and Corrina. When the Guardians explained to the Avengers the threat Korvac represented to the universe, his powers manifested and he knocked out everyone in the scene but Corrina. He escaped with her and a unconscious [[Ms. Marvel]] who he knocked out in battle. Within Adam Warlock's Soul Gem, the Guardians made the Avengers aware of Michael Korvac's true story. After that, both teams worked together to take him down for good. He arrived in Central Park and continued to battle Ms. Marvel under the reason to protect Corrina. When the Avengers and the Guardians arrived, he fought them, but even with their combined powers, Korvac easily defeated them in front of Corrina's eyes. He tried to explain to her that he was only doing that to drive away the "monsters" from them, but Corrina replied in saying: "You're the only monster here, Michael!" Korvac then teleported himself to the deep space, possibly to another dimension, blaming himself for all the things he had done.
