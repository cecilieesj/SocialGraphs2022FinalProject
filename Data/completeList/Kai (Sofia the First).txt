==Role in the Series==
Kai makes his debut in "[[The Bamboo Kite]]". He left his home in the North Forests of Wei-Ling so he could dance all he wants. He quickly became disillusioned due to having no one to dance for. He first appears while Princess Sofia, Prince Jin, and Wu-Chang are walking through the forest. Kai is happy to meet a princess and Wei-Ling's Crown Prince and Imperial Sorcerer and offers to do some dancing. Jin turns him down in favor of his sister. Kai walks away sadly prompting Sofia and Wu-Chang to tell him they have time for one dance. After the dance, Kai helps them on their journey by giving them Bamboost. After Jun is cured, Kai takes part in the Festival of Kites.
