== Trivia ==

* The name "'''Asha'''" has two meanings:
** One is in Hindi, from the Sanskrit आशा (Asha) meaning "Desire", "Wish" or "Hope", which seems to be closely linked to the feature film.
** The other is in Swahili meaning "Life".
* She will be the second princess to be Hispanic behind [[Princess Elena]] from ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''.
** She also bears a slight resemblance to [[Isabela Madrigal]] from ''[[Encanto]]'', who is also Hispanic.
