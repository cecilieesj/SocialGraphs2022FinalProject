==Personality==
Papi always disapproved of young [[Kronk]]'s culinary interests and wished that Kronk instead would settle down with a wife, have kids and live in a large house on a hill. He is very strict, but ultimately wants his son to have a good life.

In the end, Papi learns to accept Kronk for who he is, finally giving him a thumbs up.

==Appearances==
===''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''===
Papi is instrumental to the plot of the film as Kronk is always trying to get his approval. Papi arrives at [[Mudka's Meat Hut]] and confusion ensues as several of Kronk's supportive friends try to pass themselves off as Kronk's wife and kids. But in the end Kronk realizes that his wealth is in his friendships, and this finally wins his father's thumbs up and Miss Birdwell's love.

===''[[The Emperor's New School]]''===
Papi makes a few guest appearance in the series, first appearing in "[[Clash of the Families]]" in the national celebration "Famaolimpics". Since [[Malina]] promised she would dance with the winner, [[Kuzco]] switches families between [[Pacha]]'s and Kronk's.

He also appears in [[Kronkenitza]] where he tells Kronk where their family comes from.
