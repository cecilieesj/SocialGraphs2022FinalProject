'''Lola Boa''' is, as her name suggests, a boa constrictor and often the voice of reason amongst [[Brandy Harrington]]'s friends. She speaks with a heavy [[Spain|Spanish]] accent. While she often has great ideas Brandy believes her ideas aren't too bright, and Brandy secretly believes she is gross because she swallows rodents whole while they are still alive. However, Lola remains one of Brandy's best friends throughout the show.
