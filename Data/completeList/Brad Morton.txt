==History==
[[File:The_Talented_Mr._Long_(30).jpg|thumb|250px|Brad Morton as he appears in Season One]]He is one of the premier football players at [[Millard Fillmore Middle School]], where he is a school bully and plays the role of the popular "dumb jock". He usually thinks he is a hot shot, but at some points he just utterly fails.

He is two years older than [[Jake Long]], making him 16 because he was held back twice in elementary school for failing 3rd grade<ref name="young">[[Young at Heart]]</ref>.

Jake is frequently the target of Brad's abuse, despite also being popular. Usually by him flaunting something, such as a car<ref name="young">[[Young at Heart]]</ref>, a large wad of money<ref>[[Fool's Gold]]</ref>, etc., in Jake's face. However, Jake almost always manages to get even either by himself or because of Brad's own actions backfiring.

==Personality==
[[File:The_Doppleganger_Gang_(8).jpg|thumb|250px|Brad Morton as he appears in Season Two]]Brad is very egotistical, constantly referring to himself as "The Bradster". He was a major foil to Jake getting a chance to spend time with Rose during school. He once took Rose on a date but dumped her for [[Jasmine (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Jasmine]], a girl Jake took to that dance unaware that she was a [[Nix]]<ref>[[Dragon Breath]]</ref>. Afterwards, he is oblivious to the fact she no longer likes him. He always tries to steal Rose away from Jake whenever they show up, but Rose has probably not forgiven him for ditching her for Jasmine, or the dance gave her an opportunity to see Brad's true personality.

It seems that Brad hides his fears and embarrassing secrets like his fear of the dark<ref>[[The Doppelganger Gang]]</ref> and dreaming of becoming a ballerina<ref>[[Dreamscape]]</ref> with his tough-guy attitude.

==Family==
His father is a police officer and much like his son, picks on other people, including [[Jonathan Long]]<ref>[[Bite Father, Bite Son]]</ref>.
