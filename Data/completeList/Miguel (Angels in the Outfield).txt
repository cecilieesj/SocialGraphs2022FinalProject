[[File:Miguel from Angels in the Outfield.png|thumb|255px|right]]
'''Miguel''' is a minor character in ''[[Angels in the Outfield]]''. He is [[Roger Bowman]] and [[J.P.]]'s foster brother only for a short time, as [[Maggie Nelson]] can only take care of a certain kid for seven months, and he had been taken in way sooner than them. He is to J.P.'s liking, but he is not very nice to him, as at dinner. For one thing, he lies to him about Maggie's JELL-O really being "cat brains with food coloring." which annoys Roger to the point of telling him to shut up, which Maggie scolds Roger for using those words. He is later adopted by a nice family from Northridge [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].
