'''Fritz''' is [[Tylor Tuskmon]]'s boss in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated series, ''[[Monsters at Work]].''
== Personality == 

Fritz comes off as a very friendly monster and boss to the employees in MIFT, though he is overenthusiastic and sometimes goes overboard in befriending others and trying to make new employees feel welcome.  

He's quite emotional and was unintentionally a little selfish, seen in [[It's Laughter They're After]] when his bawling that Tylor was leaving MIFT to become a Jokester caused Tylor to reconsider and stay in MIFT, and it wasn't until Fritz saw Tylor never threw out his jokester props and found the letter of recommendation Tylor originally received that he realized he'd been selfish and somewhat insensitive to Tylor's feelings and dreams, that he encouraged Tylor to become a Jokester full-time, even though it made him emotionally conflicted of being happy for and proud of Tylor yet still sad that he was leaving MIFT. Still, he made peace with it and proudly watched Tylor (and Val) become a Jokester team on the Laugh Floor.

== Physical appearance ==
Fritz is a rotund, tapir-like monster with one eye, hippo-like feet and a chameleon-like tail, as well as fin-like hair. He is blue with darker blue spots and a white stomach.
