'''Bog, Fens, and Mire''' are minor antagonists in the [[2019]] animated TV series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==

*'''Bog:''' A ruthless toad soldier and leader of the trio who wields a giant hammer. He would later become the new head of [[Toad Tower]] in season 2. He is voiced by [[Darin De Paul]].
*'''Fens:''' An aggressive female toad soldier who fights with a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanab%C5%8D kanab≈ç]. She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].
*'''Mire:''' A toad soldier in full body armor who doesn't speak; mostly growls.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Toad Tax]]", Bog, Fens, and Mire came to Wartwood for daily taxes where they met Anne and inspired by her fiery spirit, they ask Anne to join them, which Anne accepts due to believing she'll finally get the town's respect. While the toads harassed the citizens of Wartwood under the belief of them not paying their taxes, Anne began having second thoughts about them. When they head to the Plantar farm, Anne tries to tell Bog that Hop Pop did pay his taxes, however Bog wasn't having it. Before Fens and Mire steal [[Bessie (Amphibia)|Bessie]], Anne finally stands up to them and engages in a duel with him, using a sword and tennis racket. Fens manages to seriously injure Anne and before Bog was about to deliver a fatal blow, Sprig arrives and the entire town of Wartwood defends Anne, allowing Sprig to reveal to them that [[Mayor Toadstool]] hid the taxes in a statue, keeping them for himself. Before leaving town, Bog tells Anne she lost his respect, and the townsfolk tell him she doesn't need his as she has theirs. As the toads leave with the taxes, they discuss their plans to inform their leader, [[Captain Grime]] about Anne.

Sometime later, in "[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]," Bog, Fens, and Mire return to Wartwood, this time with the Toad Army in rallying the citizens in order for Captain Grime to convince the citizens into coming to a banquet at [[Toad Tower]] to celebrate the reunion of Anne and her best friend, [[Sasha Waybright]]. However, the banquet turned out to be a trap so Grime could execute [[Hop Pop Plantar]] as he had been unknowingly inspiring revolutions across Frog Valley. However, after the collapse of Toad Tower, Bog, Fens, and Mire retreated with Grime and the injured Sasha deep into the forest.

Months later, in "[[Toad to Redemption]]," Bog, Fens, and Mire became bandits after the destruction of Toad Tower. They and the remaining toad soldiers attack Wartwood, blaming its people for their troubles. They were once again beaten by Anne and the people of Wartwood, but the Newtopian emissary, [[Jacinda]] became impressed with Bog's cutthroat attitude and appointed him as the new leader of Toad Tower, after deeming Mayor Toadstool "too soft" for the job. Bog, Fens, and Mire soon joined the other toads back to Toad Tower so Bog could start his new leadership of both the tower and the reorganized Toad Army garrison.

==Trivia==
*Fens is the only female in the group.
*Mire does not speak and can communicate through squeals and other strange noises.
