'''Sir Ector''' is a supporting character and one of the two anti heroes in ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''. As the lord of his own castle, he is [[Sir Kay]]'s father and [[Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]]'s foster father.

==Background==
Sir Ector was one of Uther Pendragon's knights. He is heavyset in appearance with red hair and a primitive attitude; preferring more practical concepts like fighting and war training over educational pursuits. At some point, he adopted the orphaned Arthur, but showed very little concern for him in his presence beyond the obligation of guardianship. He believed in strict discipline and constantly piled on more chores as demerits if Arthur ever misbehaved, treating him more as a servant and derisively calling him the Wart, while doting on his birth son, Sir Kay. He is extremely distrustful of magic and thus of [[Merlin]], whom he mistakenly refers as Marvin. After Arthur is revealed as the rightful King of [[England]], he regrets his mistreatment of the boy and (out of fear of his former charge's reprisal) begs for Arthur's forgiveness which Arthur quite willingly gives.

==Role in the film==
Sir Ector first appears in his castle, worried about Wart who has disappeared into the woods earlier in the day. He scolds his devoted son, Sir Kay, for allowing Wart to go into the forest alone, though Kay insists that it is not his duty to look after Wart. Ector notes that he adopted Wart and so he feels responsible for the boy's safety. When Wart returns along with a wizard named Merlin and his pet owl, [[Archimedes]], he gives Wart 4 demerits for the worry he caused. Though he initially refuses Merlin's (whom he keeps on calling "Marvin" by mistake) offer to educate Wart, he is quickly convinced otherwise by a display of magic. Still distrustful of Merlin, and resenting his challenge to his authority in the castle, Ector deliberately sets Merlin up in the decrepit and dangerous northwest tower, hoping the conditions will cause him to leave. Merlin however refuses to abandon his responsibility to Arthur.

Later that night, Ector's friend, [[Sir Pellinore]] appears with news of a tournament on New Year's Day. Ector decides that Kay should be knighted and entered, as the winner's prize is ascension to the throne of England, and the Wart will accompany them as Kay's squire.

Ector is seen early the next morning, training Kay unsuccessfully. Later that day, after Wart returns from his first lesson with Merlin, Ector refuses to believe his stories of Merlin's magic and punishes Wart with "three demerits for being late and three more for the fish story." Later, Wart sneaks off with Merlin again for the squirrel lesson, after Merlin enchants the dishes, mops and brooms to clean by themselves. Ector is informed by the [[Scullery Maid]] that the kitchen has been bewitched. Believing the enchanted dishes to be "black magic of the worst kind," Ector and Kay attack the bewitched dishes. Unfortunately for the two of them, the dishes push Ector in the washing basket and Kay is attacked by a broom and a mop. Merlin and Wart arrive to the kitchen and Merlin stops the magic dishes, turning them back to normal. Ector accuses Merlin of using dark magic and berates him for interfering with his rules and with Wart's chores. He warns Wart to shape up if he wants to go to London. After Merlin disappears, Wart angrily defends Merlin, refusing to back down even when Ector furiously piles on demerits.  When Wart upraids Ector for his intolerance, he finally revokes Wart's privilege of being Kay's squire, giving the position to another boy named Hobbs.

However, after Kay is knighted at Christmas, the Scullery Maid told Ector that Hobbs has come down with the mumps. He is forced to reinstate Wart as Kay's squire, much to Merlin's anger. In [[London]], Ector attends the tournament later on and becomes shocked when Wart is revealed to pull the legendary [[Sword in the Stone (object)|Sword in the Stone]], which is supposed to reveal the rightful heir to the throne. Wart discovered the sword and intended to use the sword as a replacement for Kay's sword, which Wart would have forgotten to bring. All the knights and nobles starts laughing at this event; making Ector and Kay think Wart is making a fool out of them. Ector drags Arthur back to the churchyard, followed by Kay, Pellinore, [[Sir Bart]], Archimedes, and other knights, nobles, peasants, and other townspeople demanding Arthur show he pulled it out. Once he places the sword back into an anvil, he tells Wart, "Let's have the miracle." Unfortunately, Wart is rudely interrupted by Kay; stating "anyone can pull it once it's been pulled", a fact proven wrong. Ector encourages Kay to pull the sword with all his might; hoping to have his son made the new king of England and even helps him in the process. Then, other knights and nobles join in. Sir Bart states this is not fair and Pellinore suggests they let Wart try it first which of course, Sir Bart agrees to: "That's what I say: Give the boy a chance". After Wart removes the sword one more time, the miracle is fulfilled. Sir Bart asks Ector for the boy's name. Ector almost calls him Wart, but catches himself and calls the boy his real name, Arthur. Ector kneels at Arthur's feet and begs for forgiveness for his mistreatment, though Arthur says itâ€™s not necessary. Then, Ector orders Kay to bow down before his new King as well.

== Trivia ==

*[[Sebastian Cabot]], the voice of Ector, later provided his voice as [[Bagheera]] in ''[[The Jungle Book]].''
*The animation of Sir Ector accidentally bumping his sword into [[Sir Kay]]'s head and Sir Kay moaning in pain when trying to attack the enchanted kitchen supplies is recycled from ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' when [[Jasper and Horace|Horace]] accidentally strikes [[Jasper and Horace|Jasper]] in the head with a chair leg. Archive audio of [[J. Pat O'Malley]], who voiced Jasper, is used for Kay in the scene. The only difference is that Ector does not get kicked in the rear by Kay.
*The animation of Sir Ector laughing with Sir Pellinore after Arthur fell down with the dishes is also recycled from [[Sleeping Beauty|''Sleeping Beauty'']] when [[King Hubert]] and [[King Stefan]] were laughing after arguing and fighting over the future of [[Prince Phillip]] and [[Aurora|Princess Aurora]].
