'''Patriot ''' (real name '''Rayshaun Lucas''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appears in ''[[Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors]]''. He's a teenage boy who has [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] and [[Captain America]] as his idols and role models. Thus, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] gave him a suit of powered armor that gives him super-strength and super-speed and invulnerability, as well as a [[Vibranium]] shield, which Patriot uses to fight crime and protect the innocent just like Falcon and Captain America do.
