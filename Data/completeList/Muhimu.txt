==Role in the series==
==="[[The Mbali Fields Migration]]"===
When the grazing grounds become scarce, Muhimu and her herd begin to clash with her gazelle friend Swala and her herd. On the suggestion of his father [[Simba]], [[Kion]] and the Lion Guard lead Muhimu, Swala, and their herds to Mbali Fields, where there is plenty of grass for the two herds to share.

However, in order to get there, The Guard has to take the herds through [[The Outlands]] after the route they were intending to use is blocked by rocks. While Swala and the majority of the herds doubt Kion's leadership, Muhimu stands up for him and trusts him.

When traveling through the Outlands, Muhimu reveals she's pregnant, (something she was trying to tell Bunga during the whole trip but to no avail), goes into labor, and gives birth to a son. Soon after, the herds are attacked by [[Janja]], [[Cheezi]], and [[Chungu]], but the zebras try their best to protect Muhimu and her son. While Kion and Bunga deal with Cheezi and Chungu, Janja breaks through the protection and tries to attack the zebras, but is kicked in the face by Muhimu's son.

After the hyenas leave, Muhimu, her son, herd, and Swala's herd reach Mbali Fields.

==="[[Babysitter Bunga]]"===
Muhimu and her herd are being attacked by Reirei's Pack until they get saved by the Lion Guard. She goes to hang out with her friends at the Watering Hole while Bunga watches Hamu.

==Relationships==

===Family===
====[[Hamu]]====

Muhimu has a close relationship with her son and despairs whenever he is in a dangerous situation as seen when the hyenas' attack, but is very proud of him, as seen when he kicks [[Janja]] during the fight and when he and his friends defeat the jackals and love him a lot.

===Friends===
====[[Bunga]]====

Bunga and Muhimu didn't get along from the start, mainly because she sat on him and she referred to him like a mongoose and a hedgehog. But during the migration, they start to get along after Bunga saves her from a flood. The pair soon became good friends, and Bunga even helps protect her when she's giving birth.

Sometime later, Muhimu entrusted Bunga with Hamu and declared him to be the best babysitter ever after teaching her son how to defend himself.

====[[Kion]]====

In the beginning, Muhimu has little faith in Kion, as seen during the migration.

But when the young leader starts to show his best efforts, Muhimu softens and begins to understand Kion, even offering him her support when the other animals lose their own faith in the cub after she accidentally blocks off the path to Mbail Fields by causing a minor stampede in excitement.

Since then, the two remain on good terms, with Muhimu now knowing she can always have faith in the cub.

====[[Swala]]====

When Muhimu and Swala are first seen, the pair are in the middle of a tense argument over a depleting grazing ground. After Kion begins to lead them to their new grazing grounds, the pair seem to become more neutral towards each other.

When Muhimu enters labor in the  Outlands, Swala is only too happy to support her as a friend, staying behind with her to ensure that all goes well.

====[[Twiga]]====

Twiga is a good friend of Muhimu who asked her questions to what happened to Hamu. She told her Bunga is taking care of Hamu and will keep him safe from jackals.

====[[Simba]]====

Muhimu and Simba are on good terms since he's her king. However, she didn't like it when Simba didn't tell the herds about Scar.

===Acquaintances===
====[[Fuli]], [[Beshte]], and [[Ono]]====

Fuli, Beshte, and Ono are good friends of Muhimu who help her and her herd to the Mbalil Fields to safety. They protect her from hyenas and jackals.

===[[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]]===

Muhimu and her herd go over to  Mizimu Grove and watch Timon and Pumbaa sing their song "[[Tujiinue]]."

===Enemies===
====[[Janja's Clan]]====

Janja's Clan tried to attack Muhimu when she was giving birth to Hamu. Despite his diminutive size, Hamu saves his mother from them after kicking Janja in the face.

====[[Reirei's Pack]]====
Reirei's Pack attack Muhimu's herd, but the Lion Guard (alongside Bunga) saved them. Thanks to this, Muhimu praised Bunga for taking care of her baby to defend himself from jackals.

==Trivia==
* Muhimu is the only character in the series to feature a different voice actress for the UK release (but only for one episode).
* Muhimu is the second character in the series to feature a different voice actor after their debut the second being [[Mufasa]] (but only for the UK release).
