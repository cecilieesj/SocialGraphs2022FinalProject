He is the new Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and disguises as an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] with super-strength.
==Powers==
Jeffrey Mace originally pretended to be an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who achieved his genetic potential after undergoing Terrigenesis, gaining superhuman powers, but in reality he obtained his abilities through regular doses of an altered version of [[Calvin Zabo]]'s formula through Project Patriot.
*'''Superhuman Strength''': Jeffrey Mace was strong enough to easily subdue [[Melinda May]], lift her by the neck off the ground with one arm, and walk her over to a wall to knock her head against it and render her unconscious without visible effort. He was able to engage [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Ghost Rider]] in a fight and toss him across the room with ease. However he was not as strong as Ghost Rider and was quickly overpowered. Mace is strong enough to send a man flying by pushing him with one hand.
*'''Superhuman Durability''': Mace was able to withstand Melinda May's attacks without even being moved. Once May resorted to hitting him with a barbell, he recoiled from the blow, but it caused no injury. He suffered repeated blows from Ghost Rider. However, while he had no visible injuries, he was wounded and fatigued.
==Abilities==
*'''Combatant''': Incorporating his strength into his fighting style, Mace was able to defeat multiple members of the Chinatown Crew.
*'''Multilingualism''': Mace is fluent in English and has some proficiency in Spanish (though with a thick American English accent).

==Trivia==
*In the comics, he is known by the codename '''Patriot''', as well as being one to hold the title of '''Captain America'''.
