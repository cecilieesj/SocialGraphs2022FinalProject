'''Zeke''' is a minor character from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]''. He is voiced by [[Timothy Stack]] (who also voiced [[Lampy]] in the movie).

==Role in the film==
Zeke is a customer. When he arrives at the Parts Shop, he asks [[Elmo St. Peters]] for a [[Blender]] motor, to which Elmo gives Zeke the last available Blender after using it to make himself a cold drink. The Blender tries to hide from Elmo behind a cereal box, but Elmo finds it and moves [[Toaster]] and the gang to a baby carriage. They then watch nervously as Elmo takes apart the Blender and takes its motor out to sell to Zeke, who then leaves the Parts Shop. It is unknown what happens to Zeke after this.
