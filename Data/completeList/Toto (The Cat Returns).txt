'''Toto''' is a character in the [[2002]] [[Studio Ghibli]] film,Â ''[[The Cat Returns]]''. He is voiced by [[Elliot Gould]] in the English dub.

==Info==
In "reality", he is only a stone statue of a crow who comes to life when the sun sets, while at the Cat Bureau, he has a soul. He's very friendly and nice to [[Haru]]. He often fights with Muta, like when he taunts Haru Yoshioka for having saved the cat prince from getting run over, which was resulting in the Cat Kingdom trying to get her to marry the prince, much to her dismay. He helps the Baron to catch up to her when she's taken to the Cat Kingdom. He also helps them when they get back.
