==Background==
===Personality===
Weezie is a cool guy through and through.

He always has a look of relaxation on his face and speaks in short sparse phrases. However as seen in "[[Cyberbullies]]" he can become downtrodden though he still speaks in short cool phrases that causes surrounding sympathy to those who hear him.
===Appearance===
Weezie is a blue skinned boy with short shaved down hair. He has noticeable lips ended with puffy cheeks. He wears a pink polo shirt brown pants and yellow sneakers.
==Trivia==
* A majority of his dialogue consists of variations that use the phrase "it is".
* His real name was revealed on the forged petition in "[[Chipocalypse Now]]".
** His name is a play on the directions West and East.
