==Background==
According to the [[Pub Thugs]], Ruthless Ruth was one of the meanest thugs who ever lived who would go on to build and own The Snuggly Duckling Pub. The people of [[Corona]] lived in fear of her, as it was said she would go on terrible rampages through the streets of the kingdom. She owned a spiked Club which used to intimidate her pub customers and destroy anything in her path. The crosses carved in her club were believed to be the number of towns she destroyed. Little did everyone know that she secretly had a passion for writing and singing songs, and the crosses on her club were actually musical notes. However, she was afraid of sharing her music with others. Afraid that no one would want to hear her songs. Even in death, she suffered through doubt and fear which bound her spirit to her pub until one day someone would sing her song and free her spirit to the afterlife.

Her song, carved into her club, would not be heard until her slumber was disturbed by the [[Captain of the Guards]], causing her to trap and torment its residents and threaten them with death until they discovered the reason for her wrath. Only [[Rapunzel]] was able to figure out why Ruth's spirit came back to haunt the pub. With her help, Ruth was able to finally sing in front of others and encouraged them to sing along, allowing her spirit to be released into the afterlife.
