'''Marcus Mouse''' is [[Minnie Mouse]]'s stern father. He is a farmer, and runs the family farm with his wife.

He first appeared in ''A 'Pot' Shot'', an illustrated Mickey Mouse verse from [[1930]]. He was still unnamed, and shown throwing a pot at [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]'s head while the latter is giving a serenade to Minnie.

He was first named in ''[[Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers]]'' by [[Floyd Gottfredson]], in which he was also depicted as a farm owner for the first time. The eggs of his chicken are being stolen, and because a drought has ruined his family's crops, he is unable to pay the mortgage. [[Mortimer Mouse|Mr. Slicker]] offers to help him out of debt, but only if Minnie agrees to marry him, which she does not want to. However, Mickey eventually finds out that the egg robbers work for Slicker and manages to save the day.[[File:Afbeelding1-0.jpg|left|thumb|231x231px|Marcus and [[Mrs. Mouse|his wife]] in ''Boxing Champion''.]] Minnie's parents briefly reappeared in the [[1931]] comic ''Boxing Champion'', also drawn by Gottfredson, listening to Mickey's boxing match by radio.

Marcus could be seen on a portrait in the [[1934]] comic ''In the News ''and appeared in a number of daily strips afterwards.

In the ''Goofy'' comic ''Sheerluck Goof and the Giggling Ghost of Nottenny Moor'', Miss Minnie's father is captured by [[Pete]]. In this story, Minnie's father had a design that was very different from the one in his classic stories. He has no beard or hat and a thin mustache.
