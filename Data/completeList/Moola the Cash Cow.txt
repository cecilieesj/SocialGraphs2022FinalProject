'''Moola the Cash Cow''' is the mascot for [[Wesaysoland]] in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_411:_Variations_on_a_Theme_Park Variations on a Theme Park]." He was performed by [[Allan Trautman]].

A cartoonish caricature of a cow, played by a teenage dinosaur in need of a summer job, Moola is [[Wesaysoland]]'s cheerful, heavily copyrighted, legally unassailable icon. He wanders the park spouting bad bovine-based puns, often using the phrase "udderly," and terrifies [[Baby Sinclair]]. His name is a "cash-in" on a slang term often used for money.{{MuppetsWiki}}{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}
