{{Quote|There's a lot you don't know.|Willa to Addison in [[Zombies 2]]}}
'''Willa Lykensen''' is one of the werewolves who was thought to be the main antagonist in ''[[Zombies 2]]''. She is [[Wyatt Lykensen|Wyatt's]] sister.
==Background==
===Personality===
Willa is the Alpha werewolf and the leader of the pack which makes her a strong leader and extremely protective. She is also very serious, fierce, and won't let anyone or anything disrespect her or her pack.

Willa is extremely loyal to her pack, her brother, and Wynter. She is a strong and confident force to be reckoned with and is a bit more violent than her brother, Wynter or her other pack mates. She is very resourceful. 

===Powers & Abilities===
Enhanced her powers with the necklace all werewolves wear that came from the moonstone with that, it can make the werewolf kind live and be healthy.

The powers of the necklaces give them, the Werewolves, infinite strength, which measures to the strength of a Zombie, if not stronger, and will make them formidable in combat or in a situation that threatens them.

==='''Powers'''=== 

*'''Enhanced strength:''' The powers of her necklace gives her infinite strength, which measures to the strength of a Zombie, if not stronger, and will make them formidable in combat or in a situation that threatens them.
*'''Enhanced Speed''': The powers of her necklace gives her infinite speed.
*'''Longevity''': This allows Willa to live longer than humans, especially for hundreds of years.

==='''Abilities'''===

*'''Intellect''': Willa somehow knew that Vanna was a vampire even when the others refused to believe it, which also shows that she is very observant. This could be a result of the Werewolves sixth sense as well.

*'''Survival''': Willa has managed to secretly live for thousands of years in the forest, leading her pack on her own.

==='''Weaknesses'''===

*'''Silver''': Like all werewolves, Willa is vulnerable to silver.

=== Physical Appearance===
Willa has brown eyes, long, dark, bushy curls of hair with several white streaks and dark skin. She wears combat boots and a long leather jacket. As the rest of her pack, she wears a Moonstone Necklace around her neck that enhances her abilities. She also has dark skin and a wicked smile with pointed, but human-like teeth.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====[[Wyatt Lykensen]]====

Wyatt is Willa's brother. They argue a bit in the second ''Zombies'' film, but ultimately are always there for one another, and there to defend the other werewolves in any situation.

===Friends===
====[[Wynter Barkowitz]]====

Wynter is Willa's packmate and best friend, and Wynter always follows Willa's directions, or asks for clarification on something tough. They get along well.

====[[Addison Wells]]====

Addison and Willa are put at odds, more or less with Willa leaving with snarky comments. But, by the end of ''[[Zombies 2]]'', the girls are friends and very close ones, at that.

====[[Eliza Zambi]]====

Her and Eliza barely exchange comments, but when they do, they seem very close. Willa calls Eliza smart and intelligent many times in the short series, and Eliza now stands behind Willa in risky situations.

====[[Zed Necrodopolis]]====

Zed and Willa's relationship is mutual. They can be kind to one another, but from time to time, they do argue, and quit, with the involvement of Addison.

====Bucky====

Willa seems to be the "Alpha" of her and Bucky's relationship. But, she does show how sensitive she is around Bucky from one time to another.

====Vanna====

Vanna and Willa were long time enemies, and both were stubborn at one another's throats. But, by the end of season 1, they both learned to accept one another and became close friends.
