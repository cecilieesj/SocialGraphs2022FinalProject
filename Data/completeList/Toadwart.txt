'''Toadwart''', nicknamed "'''Toadie'''", is the secondary antagonist of the TV series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
While Toadwart is largely an enemy, there are rare occasions where he strikes alliances and learns values from the [[Gummi Bears]].

===Personality===
Toadwart is an [[Ogres|Ogre]] in the service of the evil [[Duke Igthorn]]. Though the smallest of the Ogres, he is slightly more intelligent than the others, capable of reading and writing. Being the most intelligent Ogre at [[Drekmore Castle]], he serves as Igthorn's second-in-command.

==Role in the series==
Toadwart is usually seen in the employ of Duke Igthorn, helping Igthorn carry out his evil plans to conquer [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]]. He is often bullied and mistreated by Igthorn, but continues to attempt to please Igthorn.

Toadwart features heavily in a few episodes. In "[[Toadie's Wild Ride]]", Toadwart makes his way into [[Gummi Glen]] by accident and begins snooping around. Later on, in "[[Do Unto Ogres]]", Toadwart is cast out by Igthorn, but later returns.

In "[[Just a Tad Smarter]]", Toadwart's cousin [[Tadpole]] arrives. Tadpole is shown to be smarter and bossier than Toadwart, and is able to rally the Ogres in a revolution, ousting Duke Igthorn as ruler of Drekmore. Tadpole soon proves to mistreat and suppress the Ogres even more so than Igthorn did, and has Toadwart thrown in the dungeon for a minor reason. Tadpole also attempts to use vengeance against the Gummi Bears, by ruining their Gummiberry crops.

The episode "[[Toadie the Conqueror]]" also prominently features Toadwart, who happens to be the only being that can fit into a magical suit of armor that grants its wearer invincibility. When Toadwart realizes the power of the armor, he tries to take Duke Igthorn's place as conqueror of Dunwyn.

==Relationships==
Toadwart is extremely loyal to Igthorn, and appears to genuinely like him, despite Igthorn's constant mistreatment and physical abuse. In addition, in Toadwart's eyes, his abuse at the hands of Igthorn as his assistant still means he has a semblance of authority over the Ogres, who abuse him for their own amusement.
