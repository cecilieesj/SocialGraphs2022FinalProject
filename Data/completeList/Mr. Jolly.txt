==Biography==
Mr. Jolly is [[Leonard Helperman|Leonard]]'s pet tabby cat. He is a big, blobby, romantic cat that is afraid of the outside. When he was a kitten, he was abandoned by his father while he was still with his mother and litter. At one point while he was still a kitten, he was taken to an animal shelter and adopted by Leonard and his mother.

==Show==
Mr. Jolly stays at home with [[Pretty Boy]], Leonard's bird and they have adventures of their own while Scott and Leonard are at school. He left the house twice.

In one, Leonard brought him for pet day while [[Spot Helperman/Scott Leadready II|Scott]] brought Pretty Boy

In another, he and Pretty Boy went to Leonard's school again because they thought they were each missing.

==Movie==
In the movie, he and Pretty Boy go on a road trip to find Spot to warn him about Dr. Ivan Krank. After getting lost in Cuba, hitching a ride with bikers, sneaking on a plane, and arriving by a viaduct they make it to Leonard and they find out has happened to Spot.

When Leonard goes to turn into a dog, Spot (as a man) shows up and they warn him about Leonard going to the lab. And they go to save him. At the lab, Jolly is turned into a butt-ugly man for a few seconds. When Krank is turned into a mouse, Jolly chases him outta the lab.

At the end, Spot (who is a dog again) has a plan on how to get home. He dresses up as Scott and Jolly and Pretty Boy are hiding under the bed.
