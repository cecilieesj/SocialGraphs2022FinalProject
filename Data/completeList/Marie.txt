{{Quote|Ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them.|Marie|The Aristocats}}
'''Marie''' is a major character in the [[1970]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[The Aristocats]]''. She is a white-furred kitten who is the middle and only female kitten of [[Duchess]], the older sister of [[Berlioz]], and younger sister of [[Toulouse]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Marie believes herself to be quite the little lady, and so tries to mimic the elegance and propriety of her mother, Duchess. As a result, she can be somewhat prissy and spoiled and is quick to tattle on her brothers when things don't go her way. Although Marie makes an effort to appear ladylike, she does enjoy the occasional tumble with her beloved siblings and has an insatiable curiosity once [[Thomas O'Malley]] opens her eyes to the wonders of [[Paris]].

A hopeless romantic and daydreamer, Marie frequently is seen lost in her thoughts and sighing deeply. She also appears to be somewhat danger-prone, as she is consistently in harm's way throughout the movie. This may be because either her head is up in the clouds or because she is the kitten who has had the least practice of "biting and clawing", and thus the least capable of fending for herself in the wild.

Also, Marie is shown to be the most open and accepting of Thomas O'Malley and the most eager for him to become her and her siblings' new father. She loves romance as she eagerly watched O'Malley flirt with her mother and complimented on his poetry.

===Physical appearance===
Marie is a small white purebred Turkish Angora kitten. She has long, white fur and bright blue eyes with long lashes; out of the 3 kittens, she bears the strongest resemblance to her mother. Her nose and paw pads are light pink, and she has 3 or 4 whiskers on either side of her face. Marie wears a large pink bow around her neck and another pink bow, which is smaller, decorating a tuft of fur on her head.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Aristocats]]''===
Marie is first seen at the beginning, riding in the carriage with [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]], along with [[Duchess|her mother]] and brothers. At home, she excitedly tries to be the first one in the door but ends up stuck in the cat door alongside her two brothers. Marie insists she should be first because she is a lady. She ends up fighting with [[Berlioz]] and [[Toulouse]] until Duchess scolds them and asks the three kittens to begin their lessons.

While Toulouse practices his painting, Marie and Berlioz have a music lesson. Berlioz plays the piano while Marie sings (though the former does some of the singing, too, as do their mother, and a painted-pawed Toulouse, who also pushes on the keys). In the beginning, Marie attempts to tattle on Berlioz after he strikes the keys in such a way that her tail gets caught. After the lesson, [[Edgar Balthazar|Edgar]], the butler, brings them milk for dinner. He claims that it was prepared a special way, and it is in a way; the milk is laced with sleeping pills. The pills do their jobs and the cats are kidnapped by Edgar in their sleep and dropped off into the countryside. Unknown to the cats, they had been chosen to inherit Madame Bonfamille's fortune upon her death. Edgar had kidnapped them so that he could inherit it instead, as otherwise, he would not inherit until the cats had all died, which he thought would take years.

Marie and company awaken near a bridge, and after spending the night in the rain, are approached by [[Thomas O'Malley]], an alley cat. Though he initially offers to help Duchess as he is enamored by her, he soon discovers that Duchess has children, after Marie appears and asks if his poetic description of Duchess applies to her as well. Once over his shock, he helps them into a milk truck bound to Paris. He sends them on their way but rescues Marie after she falls from the truck. Deciding to go along with them, O'Malley uncovers some milk for Marie and the other kittens to drink. Eventually, [[The Milkman|the driver]] notices the cats and runs them out of the truck. O'Malley decides to lead them to Paris on foot. On the way, they cross a railway bridge. The cats are forced to hide from an oncoming train, but Marie falls into the river beneath. O'Malley saves her life again.

After returning to Paris, Marie and the others spend the night at [[Scat Cat]]'s pad. Like her siblings, she is impressed by the alley cats and enjoys a loud and colorful party. The next day, Marie returns home with her mother and brothers and sadly says goodbye to O'Malley. When they find that the cat door is locked, Marie comes up with the idea of meowing to get Edgar's and Madame's attention. Edgar traps the cats in a sack, with the intention of mailing them to Timbuktu, so that they cannot come back ever. Luckily, they are saved by O'Malley and the alley cats from Edgar that gets mailed away instead. Marie continued to live with Madame, Duchess, and her brothers, with the addition of O'Malley and the [[Alley Cats]], who are the start of Madame's foundation for the alley cats of Paris. 

===''[[Miriya & Marie]]''===
Marie is one of the two main protagonists of the manga ''[[Miriya & Marie]]''. In the manga, Marie is Miriya's mentor and is capable of using magic. Marie's first appearance is when she magically appears from Miriya's phone and tells Miriya that she is preparing her to become a witch. She then sends Miriya back in time to 1910 in Paris, France by unwrapping the large bow around her neck as a form of transportation. Throughout the manga, Marie takes Miriya on various magical adventures throughout Paris. She also wears a pink necklace around her neck in the manga.

===Other appearances===
On some logos and promotional material for [[Disney Digital Network]], Marie is featured as an illustration alongside [[Dopey]], [[Pascal]], and the [[Cheshire Cat]].

In [[The Princess and the Frog]], during the film's prologue showing [[Tiana]] and [[Charlotte]] as children. Charlotte owns a white kitten who resembles Marie.

In a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0lPwNwV4CU video] promoting the release of ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', a white kitten who resembled Marie complete with a pink bow makes an appearance. In some merchandise, [[Vanellope]] is seen riding on top of Marie (along with two other white cats that resemble Marie) as a giant who is seen firing lasers from her mouth and eyes.

In ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers]]'', Marie's head shape and bows were used as part of [[Peter Pan (character)|Sweet Pete]]'s bootleg transformation.
