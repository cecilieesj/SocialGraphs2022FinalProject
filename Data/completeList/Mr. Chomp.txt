== Role in the Series ==
Mr. Chomp is a kind-hearted and loyal toy shark. After [[Donny McStuffins|Donny]]'s bath in the bathtub, the bath toys get away from Mr. Chomp because they are frightened of him. [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] thinks it might be one of his teeth that is broken and begins to take a look at it, but [[Lambie]] climbs up her face, blocking her view, because she is frightened too. Doc takes Mr. Chomp to her room for a check-up. The toys are frightened of him too at first, but then help Doc out. When Doc reassures her friends that Mr. Chomp is friendly, he cries. Doc realizes he is brokenhearted because everyone thinks he is mean. After a solo song, Lambie and the toys apologize to Mr. Chomp for being scared of him. Lambie and [[Stuffy]] tell him a joke and sit next to him while Doc fixes his tooth. Feeling better, Mr. Chomp even sleeps with Doc and the other toys.
