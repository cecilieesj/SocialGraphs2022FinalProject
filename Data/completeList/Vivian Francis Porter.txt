'''Dr. Vivian Francis Porter''', or '''V.F.P.''' for short, is a beautiful robotics-scientist who appears in the ''[[Kim Possible]]'' episode "[[Grudge Match (episode)|Grudge Match]]".

==History==
The current leading expert in robotics, Vivian found it difficult to be taken seriously as a scientist when she looked like a supermodel.   

She worked with [[Dr. Fen]] to design a lunar exploration probe, which she took once she found out he was going to take all the credit. Fenn reported the robot as his stolen property in order to hide his own failures in robotics. In the end, she is offered a job at the Middleton Space Center by [[Dr. James Possible|Dr. James Timothy Possible]], which she happily accepted.

==Skills==
﻿Vivian is a very intelligent woman, who has designed robots for the Middleton Space Center. These robots were equipped with advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence (the robot learning as it goes) and self-preservation (sensing danger and defending itself﻿). It can be assumed that she turned out to be an asset to the Middleton Space Center when Dr. Fen was arrested.
