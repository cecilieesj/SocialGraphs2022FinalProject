'''Slickwell''' is the main antagonist in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[Baileywhoops]]". He was the Steward of Rudistan, serving under King Magnus, and gave Baileywick a cursed pin that put a clumsiness curse on himÂ in an attempt to steal his job as Castle Steward.

==Role in the Series==
Slickwell appeared at Enchancia Castle for the kingdom's Jubilee with King Magnus. He gave [[Baileywick]] a cursed pin called [[Pin of Klutzenheimer]] so Baileywick would be very clumsy with everything, ultimately retiring so Slickwell could steal his job. When Sofia and Clover found out about the cursed pin, Sofia told Clover to make sure Slickwell didn't get away with it. Clover put the pin on Slickwell's coattails to give him "a taste of his own medicine." When Sofia told her parents and everyone else about Slickwell's plot against Baileywick and the cursed pin, everyone was furious with him. Slickwell told King Roland he couldn't fire him because he worked for King Magnus, but that was until Magnus himself stepped forward and instantly fired him. Slickwell was escorted to the castle gates by the guards and thrown out before vowing to return, but ended up falling flat on his face due to the pin still being stuck to him.
