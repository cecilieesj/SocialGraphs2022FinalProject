Many years ago when the Sirenas used to sink human ships. One day however the ship was on sank by Sirenas, King Pescoro saw a woman named Camila fell tumbling into the ocean drowning. Feeling guilty, Pescoro saved her by wrapping her in magical kelp that turned her into a Sirena, and the two fell in love. Soon after they married and Camilla ascended the the throne she recommended to her husband that the Sirenas never again sank human ships. later on they both had a son and a daughter named Marisa and Marzel.

Due to Camila, being originally human, Marisa and her brother, Marzel, are half-human and half-Sirena, allowing them to turn their tails into legs when they are on land.

==Role in the series==

Marisa confirms this and tells her father that she thinks it is time they tell the humans that they have changed. Pescoro tells her he knows her heart is in the right place but the humans despise them for a good reason. Camilla agrees with him and tells her to stay away from the humans.

When Marisa and Marzel then take Elena to met Pescoro for help against Shuriki. Pescoro refuses and tells them about how after the attacks stopped humans thought they were kidnapping Marisa after she used her ability to turn her tail into legs for the first time. He also states that this convinced him that humans will always hate Sirenas for the attacks on their ships and forbade all contacts with humans. Even though Camilla knew her daughter was right her husband had a point too.

When Prince Marzel notifies Pescoro and Camila that Marisa was in danger, they were convinced and the rest of the Sirenas to come to Elena's aid with intercepting Cristobal's yacht into the sea wall of the palace. After Elena defeats Shuriki for good, she has Cristobal locked up for his treason and forges a new alliance with the Sirenas.
