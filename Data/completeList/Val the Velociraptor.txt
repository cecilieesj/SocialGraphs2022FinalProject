== Complaints ==
Val the Velociraptor used a dinosaur costume design style inspired by the ''Walking with Dinosaurs: The Arena Show, ''where the digitigrade walking style of a dinosaur was achieved through puppet legs attached to a human performers ankles''. ''However, the Val suit was less detailed then the ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' suits and did little to hide the performer, leading to common guest complaints that she was a cheap low budget alternative to [[Lucky the Dinosaur]].
