==Role in the Series==
Although he was a recurring in both series, Willie's role evolved when Disney bought the series and he became a more prominent character and, while still being a bully part of Roger's clique, developed more of a separate personality from Roger, along with Roger's other two sidekicks [[Ned Cauphee]] and [[Boomer Bledsoe]]. His lines became much more quotable and perhaps became the funniest character on the show.

Although he never became a main character there were a number of episodes from both Nickelodeon and Disney revolving around him including ''Doug Runs'', ''Doug Gets his Wish'', and ''Doug's Patti Beef.'' A usual appearance of Willie in each episode would usually revolve around Willie saying something ridiculous out of the blue and getting corrected by [[Roger Klotz]].

Although his role was minor, Willie remains the most recognizable member of Roger's gang.
