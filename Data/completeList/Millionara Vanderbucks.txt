|quote=}}'''Millionara Vanderbucks''' is a minor villain from ''[[DuckTales]]'', featured in the season 1 finale "[[Till Nephews Do Us Part]]".

==Background==
Millionaira is a wealthy woman with whomÂ [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] falls in love. Sadly for Scrooge, she only wants to marry him for his money. She has an evil side to her that shows when she has plans to deliberately destroy everything which is precious to the household. First, she will send [[Webby]] to finish school and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|the nephews]] to the military. Second, she will fire [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] and [[Duckworth]]. After that, she will be completely in charge of Scrooge's money and household.

After Scrooge finds out she only wants to marry him for his money and [[Glittering Goldie|Goldie]] shows up to stop their wedding, she tries to marry [[Flintheart Glomgold|Glomgold]] instead. Glomgold's answer to this is to run for his life.

==Trivia==
*Millionara Vanderbucks is the possible inspiration to Velma Vanderduck, a female business rival of Scrooge's in the the ''Uncle Scrooge'' comics. They have similar names and hairstyles and they serve as female duck antagonists to both Scrooge and Glomgold.
*Millionara Vanderbucks bares a resemblance to the Duchess/Featherika Von Strangeduck from [[Hotel Strangeduck]].
