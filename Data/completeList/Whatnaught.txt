==Background==
===Personality===
Not much can truly be said about Whatnaught, as he never speaks. He tries to communicate through charades, though humans have difficulty understanding him. Even so, he is helpful and kind, often there to aid Sofia and friends in anything. He and Clover are partners in comedy, Whatnaught backing up his bunny buddy.

===Physical Appearance===
He has all kinds of brown fur color, pink ears, yellow eyes, and two front teeth. His ears are pointed making him looking like a red squirrel, although in the actual species their ears are tufted.

*He is the only animal in the show to have five fingers.
*Despite his lack of appearances, he and Clover are known to be best friends.
