==Story==
===''[[High School Musical]]''===
Zeke in high school musical is a great cook in that movie. He was a great basketball player as well. Zeke was cool and collected the movie wouldn't be the same without him. He was tall cute and different from all his other classmates. Zeke and Sharpay were such a cute couple way better then Troy and Sharpay. In their first movie Zeke was hiding the fact that he loves to cook and once he realized that since his good friend Troy could have the guts to sing in public and face his friends knowing they wouldn't approve. So then Zeke had the guts himself to stand in front of all his friends and told them that he loves to cook. He is most likely the loosest bloke going around in the world of High School Musical.

Zeke was hired as the assistant to the head chef at Lava Springs. He initially liked his job at Lava Springs, because he would be able to be near Sharpay, while learning the art of Austrian pastry. He participated in the Lava Springs Talent Show with his friends, but did not get a chance to participate without a fight. With Ryan on their side, they manage to take part of the talent show and impress the audience. Later that night, he went to the golf course with Sharpay closely beside him and enjoyed the evening with all his friends.

Then, it was all about having fun for the rest of the summer.

===''[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]''===
Zeke, Troy and Chad, and the rest of the Wildcats pulled together their strengths and won the championship, which was going to be their last before graduation ''"(Now Or Never)"''. His crush on Sharpay remains obvious as ever. After that, [[Kelsi Nielsen]] signed up everyone for one last spring musical, his name included. Though he was resistant to the idea at first, he made a change of mind. He was the one that took Sharpay to the prom.

After putting their hearts into practice, the musical became a huge success and Zeke was able to move on to the next stage of his life with a large smile on his face and a diploma.
