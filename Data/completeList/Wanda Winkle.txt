'''Wanda Winkle''' is a character from ''[[Jessie (TV series)|Jessie]]''. She is Bertram's mother who appeared in ''Throw Momma From the Terrace''. She and Bertram have not talked in years until Jessie set them up and they get along better. She calls Bertram 'Bertrushka' and he calls her 'Mamushka'. 

==Trivia==
*When Bertram was 10 years old, she made his friend Timmy Schwartz disappear and nobody has seen him since.
*She made Bertram's valedictorian speech on "his behalf" but really because she beat him to the podium.
*Her full name sounds a lot like Wanda Fairywinkle-Cosma from ''The Fairly Oddparents''.
*Bertram does not really like her because he thinks she talks about herself too much.
