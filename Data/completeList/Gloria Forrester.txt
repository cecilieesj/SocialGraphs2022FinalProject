'''Gloria Forrester''' is a minor character in ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''. She is the wife, sister, or cousin of [[Don Forrester]].

Gloria and Don arrive in their trailer at the Thompsons' house, and then when Don pretends to "fish" [[Russ Thompson, Sr.|Russ]] downstairs from the foundation, she greets Russ, and waves her dog Gigi's paw. Noticing [[Wayne Szalinski]] "flying," she tries to get Don's attention and tell him, but he is busy talking to Russ. When Russ has told Don about Mae "having not been feeling too well", the Forresters just leave.
