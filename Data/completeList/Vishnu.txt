He is [[Sanjay (Sanjay's Super Team)|Sanjay]]'s superhero re-imagining of the Hindu god Vishnu. His superhero identity takes inspiration from the Marvel Comics character [[Captain America]].

==Role in the short film==
Though he is seen on one of the prayer shrines in Sanjay's house and as a statue in the Hindu temple which Ravana takes two discs from the statue of Vishnu, he does not make a physical appearance until the climax of the film where he and the other two deities Durga and Hanuman come alive and fight against the evil monster Ravana after Sanjay ignites the wick on the large diya using his action figure. When Ravana throws several discs at Sanjay and the deities, Vishnu uses his long arms to form a barrier and counter the weapons thrown by Ravana. He and the other two deities use a bell which is the same one used by his father to stall Ravana. Soon as Sanjay defeats Ravana, Vishnu gives Sanjay a replacement of Sanjay's action figure which he smashed in order to defeat Ravana, feeling proud with the other deities that he defeated the monster as he and the other deities transform back into statues.
