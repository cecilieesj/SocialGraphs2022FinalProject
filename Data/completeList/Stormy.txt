|quote = "I'm Stormy!"}}'''Stormy''' is a recurring character from the [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Disney_Junior Disney Junior] [[2011]] animated television series, ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''. She is the younger sister of [[Marina]], another mermaid.

==Personality==
Unlike her sister Marina, Stormy is very lazy, air-headed, and somewhat selfish, much like the mermaids from the original ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'' film. She was originally rather rude to [[Jake]], [[Izzy]], [[Cubby]], [[Skully]], and her sister [[Marina]]. To avoid doing work, Stormy would brainwash others to do the work for her using the powerful siren song called "The Mermaid's Song", but Stormy often stays honest.

==Role in the series==
In the episode "[[The Mermaid's Song]]", Marina asks Stormy to complete three mer-tasks for an upcoming event. However, Stormy openly refuses but decides to do them eventually. When Marina departs, Stormy uses the Mermaid Song to brainwash the treasure-seeking [[Captain Hook]] and forces him to find seashells. She then brainwashes [[Mr. Smee]] to collect seaweed and [[Cubby]]  to collect coconuts. Eventually, Stormy's brief partner-in-crime [[Snappy the Hermit Crab]] rushes off to warn Marina about her sister. When [[Jake (Pirate)]], [[Izzy]], and [[Skully]] arrived, [[Marina]] quickly informed them of the problem but told the young pirates to clap their hands to wake Cubby from the spell. Marina then demands Stormy's presence and tells her that while she didn't mean harm, Captain Hook, Mr. Smee, and Cubby didn't like being used in a selfish way. Stormy says that she didn't think that would happen and apologizes for her actions. Marina reminds her that the mermaid song should be used to help others and not selfishly.

She returns in "[[Treasure of the Tides]]" when the mermaids decide to make Izzy an honorary mermaid. Later that night, she joins the other mermaids when they crown Izzy "Mermaid of the Year". In "Izzy's Trident Treasure", she and Marina ask Izzy for help in finding King Neptune's legendary trident. She might have a small crush on Cubby.

Stormy appears again in the episode "[[Cubby's Pet Problem]]", where she joins Jake and his crew exploring the wonders of the Never Sea when the puny pirate team in countered a baby sea serpent they've named [[Slink]]. Stormy later returns in the episode when Cubby sneaks aboard the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] to rescue Slink from Captain Hook. She brings [[Slink's Mother]] to aid in the rescue.

Stormy attended Jake's birthday celebration with the rest of the Never Land friends in "[[Jake's Birthday Bash!]]"

Stormy and Marina make a brief cameo appearance in the episode "[[Captain Who?]]" When Captain Hook gets a whiff of the Forget-Me Flowers he forgets he is the captain of his crew. Sharky, Bones, and Mr. Smee enlist Jake and crew to help jog his memory.

Stormy and Marina reappear in the episode "[[Sandy and the Clams]]" taken part in the concert held by [[Sandy the Starfish|Sandy]] and his singing clam trio at Mermaid Lagoon.

Stormy returns in the episode "[[Izzy and the Sea-Unicorn]]", Izzy's new friend [[Cornica]], a magical sea unicorn, disappears, and Jake suggests they ask the mermaids if they knew where to find her. But Queen Coralie and a few of her subjects didn't believe Izzy's tale. However, Stormy was the only one who believed Izzy's story and decided to accompany Jake and his crew to locate Cornica, who has been captured by Captain Hook.

Stormy makes a brief appearance in "[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Battle for the Book]]", [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] comes to the mermaids' defense when a vicious sea beast enters Mermaid Lagoon.
