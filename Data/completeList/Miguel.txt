==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
He is first seen in the [[Generation Why|first episode]], talking with [[Paul (Ms. Marvel)|Paul]] in the schools hallways, when [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]], and [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] pass by them.

Later on, Miguel is conversing with Paul by the lockers, when Kamala greets them, as she walks by, and fist bumps Miguel.

When footage circulates online of [[Zoe Zimmer|Zoe]] being saved by a young cosplayer with powers at AvengerCon, Miguel is among the students at school, surrounding her, as she recounts the events from her perspective. Zoe proceeds to invite her classmates to a party on Friday in celebration of the "fragility of life", as well as her half a million followers.

Miguel is in attendance of the party, and begins hovering over Nakia, who is also there. He greets Kamala, and Bruno, who walk over to the pair. When [[Shawn]] offers Kamala a drink, which he secretly laced with vodka, as a joke, Nakia expresses her desire to leave, but Miguel tells her they can't, as everyone from their school is in attendance. When [[Kamran]] introduces himself to the group, the girls seem smitten, and Miguel looks disapprovingly at him. The sound of sirens suddenly arrive, and the partygoers are made aware of the incoming arrival of the police. Kamran offers to drive them away, so Miguel stows away in his car, alongside Nakia, Bruno, Paul, and Kamala. They are dropped of at Circle Q, and head off in their separate ways.

==Trivia==
*He was uncredited for his appearance in the [[Generation Why|first episode]].
*It is implied that he has a crush on Nakia.
