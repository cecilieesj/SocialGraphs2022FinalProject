'''Simple Simon''' is the [[Mother Goose]] character who appeared in two of Disney's [[Silly Symphony]] shorts: ''[[Mother Goose Melodies]]'' and ''[[Old King Cole]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Mother Goose Melodies]]''===
In the short, Simple Simon is one of the storybook characters who come to life, climbing out of a "Mother Goose" book, to sing and to dance, to entertain Old King Cole. 

===''[[Old King Cole]]''===
Very much like ''Mother Goose Melodies'', Simple Simon and the other storybook characters are tasked with entertaining Old King Cole, by singing and dancing, but this time in his ballroom. Instead of simply coming to life, the storybook characters climb out of Pandora's Box.
