'''Anna Lair''' is a supporting character fromÂ [[Jetix (US)|Jetix]]'s [[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]].

==History==
She's [[Irma Lair|Irma]]'s mother. She looks a lot like Irma, only taller and with longer hair. Her personality is similar to Irma's too, but she is a little more mature. Anna is a little oblivious to [[Chris Lair|Chris]]'s bad behavior and seems to protect him from his sister. Irma has hinted that she gets embarrassed by Anna in two episodes, "Happy Birthday Will" and "Parents' Night". She likes to party, although in a "lame" way. Anna is proud of her [[Tom Lair|husband]] being a police officer. She likes to go to the beach as shown in "I is for Illusion" and "J is for Jewel". She was attacked by Shagon in "M is for Mercy". In the comics, she is Irma's stepmother but in the show, she is Irma's birth mother.
