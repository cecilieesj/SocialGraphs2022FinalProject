In the beginning of the film, she and her pups were one of many residents of [[Underland]] who were captured by the [[Red Queen]]. They were used as bait, being promised to be released, along with the other prisoners, as long as Bayard finds [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]]'s scent and tracks her. They remained in the prison until [[The Mad Hatter]], [[Mallymkun|The Dormouse]], [[The Tweedle Boys|The Tweedles]], McTwisp and The Cheshire Cat released all the prisoners, turned all the royal court against the Red Queen and escaped to the [[White Queen]]'s castle where Bielle and her pups were reunited with Bayard and their family was back together.
