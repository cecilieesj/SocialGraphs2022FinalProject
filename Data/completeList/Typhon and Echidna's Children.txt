{{Main|Minotaur}}
The '''Minotaur''' is a large humanoid bull who enjoyed causing mayhem and destruction in the city of Heraklion, the capital of Crete. When Crete's king Minos finally captured him he requested of Daedalus and Icarus to build a large maze to keep the Minotaur imprisoned. However the insane king only wanted to use the maze for entertainment by throwing innocent people into the maze so they could be hunted by the Minotaur.

====Trivia====
*[[File:MinotaurBaby.JPG|thumb|left|120px|The Minotaur as an infant]]In the original myth the Minotaur was the stepson of King Minos but in the animated series there is no mention of the two being related.
*In the film, the Minotaur had red eyes and lacked clothing and facial hair and in the episode ''Hercules and the Parents Weekend'' he had purple skin as an infant (although this may be due to a lack of fur).
*In the episode ''Hercules and the Bacchanal'', it is implied that there may be more than one Minotaur.
