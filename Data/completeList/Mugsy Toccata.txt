The Xenomorph from [[Alien]]}}'''Mugsy Toccata''' or alternatively '''Mugsi Toccata''' is a character who appeared in [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Mugsy Toccata was a gangster from the criminal-underworld of 1920s-1930s [[Chicago]].  Mugsy operated along with henchmen by the names of Beans and Squid but was rivals with gangsters by the names of Brains, Legs and Weasel.  Mugsy was however little to their own knowledge, a movie-character.

At one point in time, tours being launched from the Chinese Theatre of [[Hollywood]] would start traveling through the worlds of different classic films, including the criminal-underworld inhabited by Mugsy.  These tours would intrude on a planned ambush on Mugsy's rival gangsters with Mugsy noticing the seemingly futuristic car and deciding to hijack it.

After abandoning their fellow mobsters to the gunfire of their enemies, Mugsy found themselves launched into worlds of different movies.  This lead to Mugsy finding themselves in the temple of [[Anubis]] from ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981) where they happened upon a jewel known as the Treasure of the Gods.  While ignoring the words of a nearby elder, Mugsy tried to steal the treasure and was killed by its curse, being transformed in a flash of fire and smoke into a skeleton.

== Appearances ==

=== The Great Movie Ride ===
Mugsy was a live-performed character who appeared in this attraction that hosted several portions of the ride.  Technically they were one of two possible hijacking characters but the Chicago Underworld was the most common of the scenes with the alternative being very rare.  Mugsy had no assigned gender, sex, race or ethnicity of which they were assigned as though women playing Mugsy might have the altered spelling of their name as Mugsi.

Mugsy would force the original tour-guide out of the car and take over for the scenes based on Western films, [[Alien]] and [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]].  They would be replaced with the original tour-guide following the Indiana Jones scene after stealing the treasure of the gods and being killed.

== Trivia ==
* Mugsy's prominence in the attraction might be inspired by the unbuilt attraction ''[[Dick Tracy's Crime-Stoppers]]''.  This would have been a [[Sunset Boulevard]] attraction themed to [[Dick Tracy]], a franchise well known for 1930s era stereotypical gangsters.
* While being put forwards to be a movie gangster by the tours of the Great Movie Ride, Mugsy was created for the attraction.
* The name Mugsy is a combination of, "Mug" which is a form of robbery and, "Bugsy", the nickname of famous gangster Benjamin Siegel.
* Mugsy being afraid of snakes is an allusion to the well known ophidiophobia of [[Indiana Jones]].
