{{Quote|Eclipsa Queen of Mewni to a Mewman King was wed, but took a monster for her love, and away from Mewni fled.|Pedestal in the Butterfly Castle "Grandma Room"}}
'''Eclipsa Butterfly''' (also known as '''Eclipsa the Queen of Darkness''') is a character in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''. She is the former and current ruler of [[Mewni]]. Once presumed to be [[Star Butterfly]]'s sixth great-grandmother and [[Moon Butterfly]]'s fifth great-grandmother, she is later revealed to be the mother of [[Meteora Butterfly]]. She is first alluded to in "[[Into the Wand]]".

Eclipsa unofficially regains her status as Queen of Mewni after Star gives the wand back to her in "[[Conquer]]", and she officially regains her status in "[[Cornonation]]", up until she returns the wand to Moon in "[[Pizza Party]]".

==Background==
Little is known about Eclipsa, but what is revealed indicates a dark and/or less-than-respectable reputation. In "[[Into the Wand]]", a tapestry of Eclipsa is shown among the past and present Queens of Mewni. According to a passage inscribed on the tapestry's pedestal, Eclipsa was wed to a Mewman king, but she was already in love with a monster named [[Globgor]]. Eclipsa later eloped with this monster and had a Mewman/monster hybrid child named [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]] (the true identity of Miss Heinous), who was switched with a peasant child, Festivia, by the Magic High Commission.

During her life, Eclipsa developed a number of spells that were associated with dark magic. These spells were recorded in the pages of the wand's [[Magic Instruction Book]] and sealed behind a skull-shaped lock to prevent others from reading them. She was also the only member of the royal family who never questioned [[Glossaryck]]'s teaching methods. According to Baby, Eclipsa had a very high affinity for magic compared to the other queens, rivaled only by Star herself. It is also presumed from a remark by [[River Butterfly]] that Eclipsa harbored sympathy for Mewni's monsters, a sentiment shared by very few of her fellow Mewmans and royals. At some point before the events of "[[Crystal Clear]]", Eclipsa was apparently encased inside a crystal by [[Rhombulus]]. Her crystallize imprisonment kept her alive for three hundred years, and at some point met [[Moon Butterfly|Moon Butterfly]]. Rhombulus briefly unfroze part of her body so Moon could ask Eclipsa for a spell that could defeat [[Toffee]]. Eclipsa was willing to help, but in return wanted her freedom once her enemy was destroyed.

===Personality===
Eclipsa is portrayed as calm, approachable, and sympathetic, despite her reputation as a queen of evil. (She was only branded such because of her extreme "outside the box" beliefs. Even the Magic High Commission admitted to sealing Eclipsa in crystal "before she could do anything [evil]"; even though Eclipsa's only crime by law was abandoning her arranged husband King Shastacan.) She bears no ill will towards her jailers, despite her long time in crystal captivity, and displays a carefree, fun-loving attitude similar to Star. She maintains her calm demeanor further on in the series and is more than willing to help Star whenever she is troubled. She also has a fondness for chocolate bars and roses.

===Physical appearance===
Eclipsa has short, green curly hair, grayish-purple mauve eyes, pale skin, and raspberry red spade-shaped marks on her cheeks. She wears a long, dark purple Gothic-themed dress, a large black sun hat with gray and white feathers and a thorny branch, a white cravat with a lavender crescent moon on it, purple gloves,and a gold wedding ring on the middle finger of her left hand,as she is married to her monster love, Globgor. Eclipsa also has maroon-colored lipstick and black mascara. Underneath her gloves, her hands are dark purple with purple veins sprouting out on her arm.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Royal Magic Wand''': As a queen of Mewni, Eclipsa once wielded the royal magic wand, taking the form of a parasol in her possession. Although Baby claims that she had the greatest magical potential she had ever seen before Star, Eclipsa never learned to use magic without the wand, though in "[[Tough Love]]" she used magic without a wand against Moon. After retaking possession of the wand in "[[Conquer]]", Eclipsa demonstrates incredible power with its magic, being able to overpower and defeat Meteora as well as duel and incapacitate Rhombulus. This is further demonstrated in "[[Ready, Aim, Fire]]", when she battles against a Solarian Warrior.
*'''Creativity''': Eclipsa is infamous for her creation and use of dark magic, creating many dark spells that would be logged into the [[Magic Instruction Book|Book of Spells]] and some of which never made it into the final draft. She has also displayed her creativity by making a guitar out of a skeleton.
*'''Music''': Eclipsa displays a talent for singing and playing the guitar in "[[Total Eclipsa the Moon]]", "[[Moon Remembers]]", "[[The Ponyhead Show!]]", "The Monster and the Queen", and "Cornonation".
*'''Ultimate Magic Form''': In [[Cleaved|"Cleaved]]", Eclipsa briefly gains access to her butterfly-like [[Mewberty (process)|mewberty form]].

==Role in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]]==
At the end of "[[The Battle for Mewni]]", Moon checks on Eclipsa's prison after Toffee was defeated by Star. When the prison seems intact, Moon leaves; but right after, part of Eclipsa's crystal prison cracks. It is later revealed that at some point before "[[Stranger Danger]]" Eclipsa escaped from the crystal prison and traverses to the royal family's garden. She meets Star (along with a reborn Glossaryck), and the two strike up a friendship. However, Eclipsa is discovered by the Magic High Commission who imprisons her and sentence her execution. Seeing Eclipsa as a victim instead of truly villainous, Star convinces them to give Eclipsa a fair trial. Afterward, Eclipsa is put under castle arrest until her trial and currently resides in an old tower which used to be her room. Throughout the first half of season three, Star often turns to Eclipsa for advice whenever she is troubled. Eclipsa helps Star with her troubles concerning Marco, who decided to live on Mewni. When Star tells her that she made him a squire for the Knight of the Wash, Eclipsa warned her that attending the laundry was the most dangerous job in the castle, prompting Star to rescue Marco. When Star discovers that she can travel through multiple dimensions in her dreams, Eclipsa encourages her to embrace them instead of running away from them.

Before her trial took place, Moon reluctantly looked into the history of the Butterfly family, after Star discovered that Miss Heinous was Eclipsa's daughter. Eclipsa helped Moon get into the Royal Archive in the Bureaucracy of Magic and discovered that all history on her daughter had been erased and replaced with Festivia. Certain that the Magic High Commission was keeping secrets from the royal family, Eclipsa, Moon, and Star set-up a rigged trial to force the Commission to reveal the truth. Using the truth or pain game, the Commission confessed they replaced Meteora with Festivia and erased all recorded history of her existence. This also confirmed that all of Festivia's descendants, including Moon and Star, were not true-blooded members of the Butterfly family.

==Trivia==
*Eclipsa has cheek markings shaped after a playing card, in this case, hers are spades. She shares this trait with Star (hearts), [[Moon Butterfly|Moon]] (diamonds), and [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]] (clovers).
*Eclipsa's voice is provided by Esmé Bianco who is best known for her recurring role as Ros in the hit HBO series, ''{{WikipediaLink|Game of Thrones}}''.
*Eclipsa was the most open-minded queen of the true royal line, as she saw monsters as equals and fell in love with Globgor.
*Eclipsa was imprisoned, not because she was an actual threat, but out of fear and prejudice by the Magic High Commission.
*Much like how Toffee had beliefs similar to Magneto, Eclipsa's beliefs are similar to Professor X, who believed in peace between different species.
*Eclipsa's magic is an homage to [[w:c:sailormoon:Sailor Pluto|Sailor Pluto]] from ''{{WikipediaLink|Sailor Moon}}''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cotugno, Sabrina|website=Tumblr|date=April 9, 2018|accessdate=April 9, 2018|title=Sabrina Cotugno on Tumblr|url=http://arythusa.tumblr.com/post/172769856406/atta-girl-attaway-we-already-knew-that-eclipsa}}</ref>
**Eclipsa was designed by Jushtin Lee.
**Eclipsa is voiced by [[Esmé Bianco]], who is best known for her recurring role as Ros in ''Game of Thrones''.
**Like the hearts on Star Butterfly's cheeks, the diamonds on [[Moon Butterfly|Queen Butterfly]]'s cheeks, and the clubs on Meteora's ([[Meteora Butterfly|Miss Heinous]]) cheeks, the marks on Eclipsa's cheeks are also themed after one of the four suits in playing cards - in Eclipsa's case, spades.
**When in Eclipsa's possession, the royal magic wand resembles a closed parasol with a long handle, the wand's head has black wings, the bell resembles an orb, and it has a black crescent on top.
**Due to the possibility of [[Rhombulus]] having imprisoned innocent people, it is unclear whether Eclipsa was frozen for being evil or merely under ''suspicion'' of being evil.
**Due to Eclipsa's "black sheep" status in the Butterfly family, Star did not know about her existence until "Into the Wand".
**Eclipsa's dark veins are a very common trait in many media with dark-embodied creatures, indicating that darkness (or similar form of dark magic) is devouring its host. The signs can also symbolize death, if not treated (e.g. Star's mother feeling pain on her arms as an adult rather than at a young age when she had no pain), however, they usually are just a physical trait that symbolizes evil.
**Until "[[Butterfly Trap]]", Eclipsa doesn't know anything about Festivia, who replaced Meteora as her daughter in the Butterfly records.
**In "[[Total Eclipsa the Moon]]", Eclipsa reveals she does not know how to "dip down", or use magic without the wand.
**Eclipsa and her daughter, Meteora, are the last living true-blooded members of the Butterfly family.
**From "[[Conquer]]" to "[[Pizza Party]]", Eclipsa is the owner of the [[Royal Magic Wand]].
***Eclipsa is the last true-blooded member of the Butterfly family to wield the [[Royal Magic Wand]].
**Eclipsa shares some similarities with Sailor Saturn and Sailor Pluto from the ''Sailor Moon'' series, including her reputation as a terrible person who dabbled in dark magic, whispering the names of her spells, and her Black Velvet Inferno spell, which shares its effect with Sailor Saturn's Death Reborn Revolution.
**According to the book ''Star vs. the Forces of Evil: The Magic Book of Spells'', Eclipsa was forced to marry King Shastacan as ordered in her mother Solaria's will. In life, Solaria had been trying to set them up for some time.
**Solaria described Eclipsa as being very intelligent and clever for her age, and loved how she liked to explore the castle's secrets and passageways.
**"[[Swim Suit]]" reveals that Eclipsa doesn't know how to reverse her spells, having never needed to do so before, though she learns how to with help from Star.
**It can be assumed that Eclipsa is born out of wedlock since her father is never stated as her mother’s husband in the first place.
**As of "[[The Monster and the Queen]]", Eclipsa may have had her ears pierced, as it was a requirement for her to free Globgor with the Crystal Pulverizing Spell from the Book of Spells.
**In Eclipsa's own words in "[[Here to Help]]", she's a "nervous eater".
**A flashback in "[[Pizza Party]]" shows that Eclipsa shared her love of Snookers bars with her mother, Solaria.
