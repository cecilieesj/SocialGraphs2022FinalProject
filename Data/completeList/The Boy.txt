'''The Boy''' is a character in ''[[The Small One]]''.

==Background==
As with Small One, he is a very kind hearted person and truly cares for [[Small One (character)|Small One]]. This is why when [[The Father|his father]] tells him in the first night that he'll be taking Small One to be sold, he asks to go instead. This shows how much he cares about Small One so dearly and it pains him that he has to let Small One go.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Small One]]''===
The Boy is first seen caring the donkeys in the stable, especially his donkey [[Small One (character)|Small One]], much to the other donkeys behind him feeling hungry. Noticing Small One's playful behavior, the Boy decides to play with him across the stable, much to the other donkeys feeling jealous about this. He then prepares Small One his breakfast while [[The Father|his father]] tells him to go to work. While working to get the loads of heavy sticks to construct shelters, his father tells him if Small One eats much as the other donkeys to which he explains to his father that Small One has a big appetite, to which the Boy's father explains that Small One is too old to do the work for him, explaining that he cannot afford to keep him longer, deciding to take Small One to the town to sell the donkey, much to his son's worry, telling him to understand and accept the tough decision he tells him. Afterwards, the Boy gently cares Small One singing the friendship he has with the donkey before going to sleep.

The next day, the Boy goes to a busy town to sell the donkey, asking a Roman guard who knows anything who could deal with the donkey. Going to the shop the guard pointed to, the Boy and Small One enter and encounter a nearby tanner, asking him if he has a donkey to sell to which before trying to sell the donkey, it is found out that the tanner only wants to kill him, causing the boy to refuse to sell him. Exploring the town around them, the Boy tries to sell Small One to a pottery vendor, but he refuses to buy him and after another failed attempt to sell the donkey, three singing merchants point the boy to seek an Auctioneer who would help the boy sell him. Looking at the Auctioneer the merchants pointed to, the Boy attempts to ask the Auctioneer if he can buy the donkey to which he refuses, explaining to him that the market he owns is a horse market. Noticing what the Auctioneer is doing to Small One, the Boy confronts the Auctioneer from harming the donkey to which the two manage to escape from him in panic.

Later, the Boy feels sad that no one would buy Small One in time just as Small One gently comforts him. That night, the Boy and Small One sadly walk around town, still with no one to buy the donkey. Suddenly, the sad boy approaches a man who is asking him if he owns Small One. The man talking to him is no other than [[Joseph]] who needs the donkey to carry his wife to Bethlehem. The Boy agrees to give Small One to Joseph, just as Joseph offers the Boy one silver coin, to which the Boy explains to Joseph that Small One needs a new home. The Boy gives Small One to Joseph, who takes Small One with him so that he can carry his wife to Bethlehem as the Boy bids a farewell to the donkey. Afterwards, Joseph takes Small One to carry his wife Mary to Bethlehem as the Star of Bethlehem shines on the sky, marking the birth of Jesus.
