'''Bootsie''' is a supporting character in ''[[Spidey and his Amazing Friends]]''. She is the pet cat of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Aunt May]]. Bootsie is ever so curious and sometimes gets herself into trouble.

==Appearances==
===''[[Spidey and his Amazing Friends]]''===
In "[[CAT-astrophe]]", Bootsie gets lost at the cat show and [[Lady Octopus|Doc Ock]] turns her into a super-sized, monster kitty causing chaos all over town. Later, she gets turned back to normal and saved by her [[Spider-Man|superhero owner]].

In "[[Bootsie's Day Out]]" Peter gets a leash for Bootsie but she gets distracted easily, and runs off while her owner is making a cat carrier. Bootsie is found by [[Black Cat]] who tries to use her to distract people some she can rob them after. After Team Spidey finds and rescues them at a construction site, Peter decides that Bootsie is not ready for a leash yet and keeps her home with Aunt May.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Peter and May Parker never had a pet cat, but they did have a pet dog named Ms. Lion, who was part of the Pet Avengers.
