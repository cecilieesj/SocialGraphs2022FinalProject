'''The Fujitas''' are deleted characters and antagonists originally meant to make an appearance in the 2014 Disney animated feature film ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.

==Background==
===Development===
The Fujitas were a group of female criminals in the high-tech city of [[San Fransokyo]]. At one point in the film's production, they served as villainous henchmen to the character of [[Yama (Big Hero 6)|Yama]], who originally served as a major antagonist in the film, though he eventually diminished into a more minor and comedic villain as production moved forward.<ref>http://kevinnelsonart.tumblr.com/post/102288278608/early-yama-and-henchmen-from-big-hero-6</ref>

More notably, the Fujitas would also serve as henchmen to the film's main antagonist, [[Yokai]], at one point. According to that storyline, Yokai rallied together a legion of San Fransokyo's most notorious criminals (including the Fujitas) to assemble a [[Silent Sparrow|portal]] capable of sending him to another dimension.<ref>http://ryanlangdraws.tumblr.com/post/102651562704/more-big-hero-6-well-i-just-put-up-my-website</ref><ref>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9zYVrAa-J0Y</ref>

Though the lethal and villainous Fujitas were ultimately dropped from the film, there are several points made by the filmmakers that indicates their presence within the universe. According to design artist Scott Watanabe, the criminal world of San Fransokyo most likely still exists, but was simply never explored in the movie itself.<ref>http://scottwatanabe.tumblr.com/post/102974378390/yama-used-to-be-have-a-more-predominate-role-along</ref>
Additionally, a woman bearing a striking resemblance to the various pieces concept art released of the Fujitas (excluding the face paint) is seen as [[The Ringleader|the ringleader]] of the bot-fightÂ [[Hiro Hamada|Hiro]] and Yama participate in at the beginning of the film.

===Physical Appearance===
In most concept art of them, they are shown to have a punk, geisha-like style. In clothing, hair style with hair sticks sticking out, along with some of them wearing verses styled hairpins, face paint and with some of them carrying hand fans and umbrellas, that possibly contain blades. Some of them are even shown to be wearing eye patches, to cover up an injure or to make them look more intimidating. The kneepads help to protect their knees while they use their roller-skates to skate around San Fransokyo and cause trouble for the people they encounter. The weapons that they carry are mostly bats, with most of them bearing sharp spike, and mace-styled ball in chains.
