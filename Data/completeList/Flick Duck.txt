|quote = "Cheese and quackers!"|parents=[[Shirley Duck]] (mother)}}'''Flick Duck''' is a unique character on the series ''[[PB&J Otter]]'' because he is the only non-mammal among his group of friends. Flick hides a soft, caring interior underneath his often tough and "cool" exterior. He has been known at times to be boastful and self-absorbed. Flick often leads the gang into trouble with his brilliant plans and ends up paying the price for his actions. He also tends to bully [[Munchy Beaver|Munchy]] and wants the position of [[Peanut Otter|Peanut]]'s best friend. On the other hand, Flick can easily be a good friend to others when he wants to and really quite enjoys playing together with others and helping out. Flick is a bit of a mama's boy and usually refers to his mom, [[Shirley Duck]], as "Mommy". He has curtains with hearts in his room, probably his mom's idea. Flick lives with his mom only; for unknown reasons his father is not a part of his life.

Flick's favorite comic book hero is Mallard Man. He often imagines either being or meeting this superhero. In "[[Collector's Edition]]", he had a rare Mallard Man Comic that was desired by Mr. Snootie when he was a poodle puppy.
