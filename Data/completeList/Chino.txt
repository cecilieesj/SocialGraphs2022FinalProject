'''Chino''' is a supporting character turned antagonist in ''[[West Side Story]]''. He is a reserved member of the [[Sharks]] who is in love with [[María Vasquez]], but grows jealous when she falls for [[Tony (West Side Story)|Tony]]; turning him into a killer.

==Background==
===Personality===
When Chino first appears, he comes off as being somewhat dorky and shy. Nevertheless, he is considered very reliable by the rest of the [[Sharks]], particularly [[Bernardo Vasquez|Bernardo]] who has a lot of faith in him. He appears very humble and even respectable at times, as even though he knew that Tony and María were together, he still treated him like an equal before the Rumble. After Bernardo's death, he is filled with rage and kills Tony, only to realize that his revenge was empty after seeing María's sadness.

==Trivia==
*Prior to Josh Andrés Rivera portraying Chino, he was played by numerous other actors. When the original Broadway show opened back in [[1957]], Chino was played by Jamie Sanchez. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, Jose De Vega portrayed him.
**In the original Broadway show, his surname was 'Lopez' while in the original film it is 'Martin'.
