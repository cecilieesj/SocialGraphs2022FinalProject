{{Quote|Come to think of it, I've never thought about it, sewing shadows. Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it. I said to myself, 'I'll put it away for him until he comes back. Oh, he's sure to come back.' And you did, didn't you, Peter? After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later. Don't you agree? What I don't understand is how Nana got it in the first place.|[[Wendy Darling]] to [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]]|Peter Pan (film)}}
'''Peter Pan's shadow''' is the living shadow of [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''===
In the [[Peter Pan (film)|film]], while Peter was visiting the Darling household to listen to stories, their dog, [[Nana]], barked at the intruders and while Peter escaped, his shadow was captured. That night, [[Wendy Darling]] discovered it and stored it in her drawer to prevent it from getting into trouble. The next night, Peter and [[Tinker Bell]] returned to retrieve it. When they found it, they accidentally woke Wendy. As Peter attempted to stick it back on with soap, Wendy preferred the proper way, and sewed it back on.

===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
The shadow appears in the special episode "[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Peter Pan Returns|Peter Pan Returns]]". In the 
special, it escapes and heads for [[Neverland]]. While there, it is captured by [[Captain Hook]], who uses the shadow as leverage to capture and exile Peter Pan and have his revenge. Ultimately, the plan fails, Peter is re-united with his shadow, and Hook is defeated.

The shadow makes another appearance in [[Jake's Awesome Surprise]]. When Jake opens a treasure chest, Peter's shadow flies out of the chest, revealing Peter Pan himself, who attends Jake's birthday party.

In [[Pirate Fools Day!]], Peter's shadow sneaks away and begins to pull pranks on everyone in Never Land. During his antics, he is captured by the demonic [[Shade the Shadow Pirate]]. However, before Pan's shadow is imprisoned in the Shadow World forever, Peter and Captain Jake fool Shade, helping the shadow escape, and the Shadow Pirate is destroyed.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
In this [[Once Upon a Time|show]], the Shadow is a demonic entity that resides within Neverland and monitors those who exist within it. When a man named [[Peter Pan (character)|Malcolm]] chooses to stay there, he gives up his [[Rumplestiltskin|son]] to the Shadow to retain his youth, and becomes Peter in doing so. The Shadow then becomes his servant, but warns him that his immortality is limited, and will die when his time runs out. Motivated to have companions, he orders it to begin bringing children to Neverland. In [[London]] years later, Wendy meets it outside the [[Nursery|nursery]] window, and it takes her to Neverland. However, after returning from a visit, she reveals that it now wants one of her brothers, [[John Darling|John]] and [[Michael Darling|Michael]] to take back with it. To make sure it doesn't succeed, Wendy, John, Michael, and their friend, [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]], hide the next night when it comes back. However, Michael gets distracted by it, forcing Baelfire to dash out and have it take him instead of the Darling children. Kf accepts the offer, and takes him toward Neverland. During the flight, however, he lights a match to ward it off, causing it to drop him into the sea, and after searching for a brief moment, it can't find him and flies back to Neverland. The Shadow appears in present day aiding the [[Lost Boys]] in acquiring [[Henry Mills]] from the rogue [[Greg Mendell|Greg]] and [[Tamara (Once Upon a Time)|Tamara]]. It assists in the attack by stealing Greg's shadow, leaving him in a comatose state, and flies off with its captive. It also appears to Rumplestiltskin as [[Belle]] to gain his trust until it is exposed by [[The Evil Queen|Regina]].

In the Dark Hollow, the Shadow ambushes [[Emma Swan|Emma]], Captain Hook, and Neal with two other duplicates of itself. Emma is able to capture it, however, in a candle, and it is then used to allow the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] flight to sail them home. After the ship enters [[Storybrooke]], the Shadow remains trapped in the sail, as Peter is incapable of controlling it since he is imprisoned. Unbeknownst to everyone else, he previously switched bodies with Henry. While he is inhabiting Henry's body, he releases the Shadow from the sail, where it then steals that of Mother Superior the following morning.

During the night, the Shadow overhears a plan the residents of Storybrooke have to switch back Henry and Peter to their respective bodies. Upon learning [[The Prince|David]], Hook, Neal, and Tinker Bell are going to procure the Black Fairy's wand for the task, it follows them to a church and attacks. It knocks Captain Hook off his feet, but is captured when Tinker Bell lights a flame on a coconut to draw it in, and proceeds to throw it into an open fire, killing it and returning [[Blue Fairy|Mother Superior]]'s to her body.

==Video games==
===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===
The Shadow is first shown when Peter send your avatar on a mission to find it. It is like a meet-and-greet character except you must copy his movements and find it three times throughout [[Disneyland]].

===''[[Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition]]''===
The Shadow can be seen during the game's opening when the player is operating as Tinker Bell. It appears in a bedroom (presumably the nursery) when Tinker Bell flies through, briefly surprising it.

=== ''[[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]'' ===
'''''Peter's Shadow''''' is an unlockable Oceanic Spell within the game. When used, the player selects a target teammate and can summon a Shadow clone of them. Each Shadow has 30-45% of the target teammate's Health, Offense, and Defense (depending on Ability Upgrades), and can only perform the target teammate's Basic Ability. As ''Peter's Shadow'' is upgraded, it also has a 50-100% chance to grant Haste to the Shadow for 2 turns when summoned. On Offense in Club Conquest, if the cloned teammate is a ''Peter Pan'' character, the Shadow gains 2 stacks of Evasion. If the cloned teammate is Peter Pan, the Shadow can also perform Peter Pan's Passive Abilities (if they are unlocked). 

Additionally, Wendy has a Special Ability, ''I Saved Your Shadow For You'', which acts similarly to ''Peter's Shadow.'' Wendy can select a target teammate and, with a sewing needle, detach their shadow, creating a Shadow clone. Wendy's Shadows only have 25-35% of the target teammate's stats (depending on Ability upgrades) and do not have any extra perks in the Club Conquest mode, but have unique synergy with Wendy's other Abilities, assisting her throughout the match. 

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
The Shadow can be seen flying through the walls in the popular dark ride attraction ''[[Peter Pan's Flight]]''.

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===
The Shadow plays a significant role in ''[[Disney Dreams!]]'' Here, the shadow unleashes some of the magic from the [[Second Star to the Right]]. As it enjoys itself with some of the Disney characters, he is attacked by Captain Hook and his Disney villain allies. Peter and Tinker Bell arrive and successfully restore the magic, defeating him.
