'''Quasimodo's Father''' is a minor character of the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] [[1996]] animated film, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.

==Role in the film==
At the beginning of the film, [[Quasimodo]]'s parents (who were Romani) tried to enter the city of Paris with fellow Romani, but they were discovered by [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]] and his soldiers when they realize they have been double-crossed.

The man puts a protective arm around [[Quasimodo's mother|his wife]] and son but is pulled away from them by a soldier and handcuffed.

While his wife manages to escape, it is unknown what happens to him afterward exactly, but it is most likely the man and the other Romani are taken to the [[Palace of Justice]] to be executed.

==Trivia==
*The stage musical identifies him as Jehan Frollo, Claude Frollo's younger brother.
*It can be assumed that he did not think of [[Quasimodo]] as a human, as when he was crying as an infant, he referred to him as an "It". He also seemed to be particularly harsh when he ordered his wife to silence him, trying to get him to "shut up". This could either hint that he (like other people) was disgusted by his deformity and did not consider him his child, or this may have been because of the circumstances of their situation at the time.
