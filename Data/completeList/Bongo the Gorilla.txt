'''Bongo the Gorilla''' is a minor character from Disney/Touchstone's [[1988]] hybrid film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

==Role in [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit|the film]]==
Bongo is the bouncer of the [[Ink and Paint Club]]. He sees who comes into there, letting people in with the password "[[Walt Disney|Walt]] sent me". Dedicated to his job, he makes sure people don't sneak backstage to bother the performers in their dressing rooms, especially [[Jessica Rabbit]]. He is seen again in the deleted scene, where he knocks Eddie out cold for sneaking back into her dressing room. He is supposedly a minion of the dastardly [[Judge Doom]]. Later, at the end of the film, he is seen at the Acme factory, celebrating the Toons' victory over Doom, while possibly reformed.

==Disney Parks==
Bongo can be seen and heard in the queue line of [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]] when passing by the Ink and Paint Club door. He opens the window like he does in the film and says one of several different phrases, such as "If you don't know the password, you ain't comin' in. So, amscray!" and "Who do you think you are? [[Mickey Mouse]]?".

==Trivia==
*Bongo's name is not confused with [[Bongo the Bear]].
*He resembles Conga the Ape from ''[[Wikipedia:Banjo-Kazooie|Banjo-Kazooie]]''.
*Bongo made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Marsupilami (TV series)|Marsupilami]]'' episode "[[Prime Mates Forever]]".
*Morgan Deare, the actor who voices this character, also portrays a live-action character, an editor who works out the moviola alongside [[R.K. Maroon]].
