'''Old Tim''' is the name of the '''Ice Moose''', the equivalent of [[Santa Claus]] within the world of ''[[PB&J Otter]]''. It is believed by some that if, on Hoohaw Hoo Eve, you turn around three times, make Ice Moose antlers, go "honk honk honk" and then make a wish on the star of Hoohaw Hoo, then Old Tim and his Sugarplum Ferrets (the equivalents of Santa's reindeer) will grant it. In "[[The Ice Moose]]", PB&J and the others put on a pageant about Old Tim. [[Peanut Otter|Peanut]], [[Baby Butter Otter|Butter]], [[Jelly Otter|Jelly]] and most of their friends believe that Old Tim is real, though [[Flick Duck|Flick]], disappointed at not receiving the flashy presents he wanted, has stopped believing (if he ever truly believed at all). Flick's disbelief is tested when he meets a young mouse who wishes on the Ice Moose to fly. He receives a visit from Old Tim in a dream. Additionally, at the end of "The Ice Moose", Old Tim and his Sugarplum Ferrets are shown driving off in a sleighboat. Tim exclaims "Happy Hoohaw to all and to all a hawhoo!" in a nod to the final line from the classic Christmas poem "Twas the Night Before Christmas" (or "A Visit from Saint Nicholas"). Butter refers to him as "Moo-Moo".
