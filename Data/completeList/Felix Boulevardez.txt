'''Felix Boule​vardez''' is a character in ''[[The Proud Family]]''. He is [[LaCienega Boulevardez]]'s father and [[Oscar Proud]]'s best friend. 

==Background==
He and Oscar have a lot of things in common. They are both business owners and piggy at glamouring at other women and they both like watching TV. They even get nervous when their wives catch them at doing something that upsets them. He is also a big fan of Freddy Freedo. He is the founder of the company ''Boulevardez Construction.'' Unlike Oscar, Felix's business seems to be quite successful as he manages to own a nice house and a movie theater whereas Oscar's company ''Proud Snacks'' struggles to even earn him enough money to pay a power bill. He is the father of [[LaCienega Boulevardez|LaCienega]] and the husband of [[Sunset Boulevardez|Sunset]]. He and Oscar often get into trouble together. He and Oscar have a lot in common: both have dominating wives, both have parents living in their home (Oscar has Suga Mama and Felix has Papi) and both have teenage daughters. The differences between them is that Oscar is tall and skinny and Felix is short and overweight, and Felix is also richer and more successful than Oscar at everything, yet that does not affect their friendship. They are also very strict with their daughters hanging out with boys (although Felix isn't as overbearing towards Lacienega as Oscar is towards Penny).

In ''Louder and Prouder'', it is likely Felix has either left his construction business or his company has gone downhill since the original series ended. This is due to the fact that his wife Sunset, who had recently been promoted to police detective, is now making twice as much as a CEO of a company. 

== Relationships ==
[[Sunset Boulevardez]] - Felix got engaged to his wife, Sunset, when she arrested him and said that he had a choice of going to prison or walking down the aisle. There have been moments where Felix can get annoyed by his wife's nagging ways but it is clear they love each other deeply and their relationship is far less dysfunctional than Oscar and Trudy's. Also, while he and his wife can be strict with their daughter, they aren't nearly as overbearing as Oscar and Trudy are towards Penny.

[[Oscar Proud]] - The two are best friends and love hanging out together. They get along extremely well. While their personalities are slightly different, they share just about everything else in common.

[[Bobby Proud]] - Felix and Bobby surprisingly have a solid friendship. They have been paired up together on several occasions and they get along really well.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Forbidden Date]]", Felix is shown to have normal feet when in fact, like all Boulevardezes, he has large feet.
*When paired with [[Oscar Proud]], their names are a reference to Oscar and Felix from the play turned movie and television show ''The Odd Couple''. Ironically, the Oscar and Felix there were known for being total opposites while the Oscar and Felix in ''The Proud Family'' are very much alike.
