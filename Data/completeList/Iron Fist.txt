==Appearances==
===Marvel Animated Universe===
====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====
In this incarnation, Iron Fist is apart of the group "Heroes for Hire", along with [[Power Man|Luke Cage]]. Iron Fist and Luke Cage are hired by [[Henry Pym]] to track down the thief who stole his Ant-Man suit and equipment, which they agree to as long as he pays well.

The pair encounter Mangler and Scythe in the alley who immediately fight them, which resulted in their defeat. After the clash, Fist theorizes that those two ran into the thief in the Ant-Man suit and uses his chi to sense the culprit's arrival. After an encounter with the thief, they discover that the thief is indeed Scott Lang who used Hank's suit to get the money he needs in exchange for his daughter held hostage by Crossfire. They follow Scott and engage Crossfire and his henchmen. After the battle, Fist asks Scott that if he needed a job, which he agrees to and joins the Heroes for Hire.

When the Avengers were taken out of time by Kang, Iron Fist is one of the heroes chosen for the new team. He, Luke, [[Wolverine]], [[Thing]], and [[War Machine]] act as a distraction while [[Spider-Man]] sabotages the time drive and returned the Avengers to the present.

Iron Fist participates in the battle against Terrax during the invasion of [[Galactus]]. After Galactus was defeated, he leaves to leave credit to the Avengers.

====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
A teenage Danny was raised in K'un-Lun. He had to kill Shou-Lao, a dragon to get his iron fist. Since he killed the dragon, he could put his chi energy into his fists to become Iron fist but something inside him always tells him that he doesn't deserve his iron fists. He kept a dragon on his uniform to symbolize Shou-Lao. His parents were killed by his father's business partner Harold Meachum. He then lived in K'un-Lun with Master Kung, from whom he learned martial arts. He then moved to America and went with S.H.I.E.L.D. to continue his training.

In the present, Iron Fist watched the live footage of [[Spider-Man]] training and saw some potential in him. He then made a bet with [[White Tiger]] that Spider-Man would join the team. Later Spider-Man got into trouble with his Spider-Cycle and his new teammates helped him, and Danny introduced himself to Spider-Man as Iron Fist. After Spider-Man got ambushed by the Frightful Four (sans [[Trapster]]) Iron Fist rescued him, along with White Tiger, [[Power Man]], and [[Sam Alexander|Nova]]. After Spider-Man advises him, Iron Fist augments his chi on his right fist and takes care of the [[Ulysses Klaw|Klaw]]. After the fight, Danny enrolled in Midtown High School along with Sam, Ava, and Luke.

Iron Fist was sent to detention by [[Agent Coulson|Principal Coulson]] along with the others. The team was transported to the Helicarrier where they got in contact with Fury, who told them to train. Spider-Man and Nova had a match of who destroys ten machines the fastest, while Iron Fist, Power Man, and White Tiger watched. Iron Fist went along to capture Doctor Doom and prevailed. When they returned to the Helicarrier, Doom was revealed to be a Doombot, who held 5 other mini-robots. The main Doombot attacked the nuclear reactor of the Helicarrier, while Iron Fist helped take care of one of the Doombots. When Iron Fist arrived with the others to the reactor, they all worked together and destroyed the Doombot. Along with the other four, Iron Fist took responsibility for the accident and received a message from Doom.

At Midtown High, Danny along with the other team members dragged Peter to the cafeteria. There they laughed Peter out, because of his humiliation in the subway. After the remark from Nova, Danny advised him not to say something before he thought it through. Danny got invited by Peter along with the other team members to [[Harry Osborn|Harry]]'s house, which was revealed to be a party and where they got trashed by Harry. After the Venom symbiote arrived, Danny helped the civilians to escape from the party. After that, he arrived at the rooftop along with the others and helped hold off Venom. After Power Man got attached to it, Iron Fist saved him but got attached to it himself and discovered he could read Venom's thoughts, finding out that it was confused and that it wanted Spider-Man. After throwing Spider-Man away, Iron Fist freed himself and got wrapped by the symbiote's substance, he then got freed by the others, although ripping his clothes and leaving him in his underwear, which embarrassed him but he claimed his choice of underwear is a "monk thing".

===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
