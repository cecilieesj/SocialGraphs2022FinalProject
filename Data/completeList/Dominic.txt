'''Dominic''' (Beau Mirchoff) was an evil wizard and the nephew of [[Gorog]]. He was the main antagonist of ''[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]''.

==History==
Dominic appears in the one hour special ''The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex''. Dominic plans to take over the world with the help of the [[Evil Alex]], whom he also formerly had a crush on. But when Dominic flirted with Alex, [[Mason Greyback|Mason]] got up and got so furious and jealous that he shoved Dominic ferociously off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, sending him toward his death. Dominic has now joined his uncle, Gorog, in death. He joined his uncle after Dominic's uncle's death in "[[Wizards vs. Everything]]".

==Personality==
Dominic is an evil wizard. He does not like mortals. He is very manipulative and can even trick Alex and Mason. Not only that, but he teams up with the evil version Alex to take over the world. The Good Alex stops him, and he does not succeed.

==Relationships==
===Alex Russo===
In the beginning of The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex, Dominic flirts with Alex which makes her werewolf boyfriend, Mason jealous. Later on, Dominic accompanies Alex when she's depressed and he continues to flirt with her and even gives her a friendship bracelet until Mason comes. When Alex divides her personality into a Good Alex and an Evil Alex, Dominic joins forces with the Evil Alex to take over the world. After Dominic is pushed off the Leaning Tower of Pisa to his death, Evil Alex attempts to take over the world, but Good Alex destroys her before she can.

===Mason Greyback===
Mason did not like Dominic from the start when he flirted with his girlfriend. This relationship became even more intense when Dominic trapped him in the bead and sent Good Alex to her death. In the end, Mason kills Dominic by pushing him over the railing of the Tower of Pisa.

===Evil Alex===
Dominic and Evil Alex worked together to try to take over the world and get rid of all mortals of the planet. They were dating, which caused Mason to believe normal Alex was cheating on him with Dominic, until Dominic died and normal Alex got rid of evil Alex for good.
