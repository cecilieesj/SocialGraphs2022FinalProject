'''Winchell P. Bickerstaff''' is a character from ''[[The Fox and the Hound 2]]''. He is a talent scout.

==''The Fox and the Hound 2''==
Bickerstaff visited the country fair to find some talented performers for the Grand Ole Opry. He was often accompanied by a little girl serving as his chaperone named [[Olivia Farmer]] to help him with his quest to find talented performers at the fair. The Singin' Strays hope, with their performance, to impress him and be chosen but, because of [[Dixie]]'s jealousy since she was replaced by [[Copper]] and with [[Tod]]'s help, the show is ruined and he leaves. Later on, the band tracks him down at a local diner and sings in front of him, thus, getting chosen along with their banjo player, [[Lyle Snodgrass]] to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. At the Opry, Bickerstaff enjoys the band's singing until he spots Olivia in the audience and faints on stage.
