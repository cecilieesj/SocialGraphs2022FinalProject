'''Two-Tone''' is one of the original fifteen puppies of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]] in the ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'' franchise. Unlike most of her siblings, her spots are concentrated on one side, corresponding with the black ear.

==Background==

===Physical appearance===
Two-Tone is a dalmatian puppy, spotted one one side of her body, not spotted on the other (vertically) slightly chubby (Movie), half white with black spots (one that resembles a beauty mark and two black ears) and half black with white spots (horizontally), green eyes, blue collar, gold hoop earring (TV series)

==Appearances==
===''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''===
Two-Tone is one of the original [[Dalmatian puppies|fifteen puppies]] of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]. She has one side of her body covered with spots, whilst on the other side is blank. Also, her ear is black on the side with spots on it, whilst on the spotless side, her ear is white. Like the rest of her siblings, she is kidnapped by [[Jasper and Horace]] for [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] and brought to [[Hell Hall|De Vil Manor]] to be made into a fur coat. She ends up escaping with the rest of the Dalmatian pups.

In most of the tie-in material, Two-Tone is shown to be close to her brother, [[Whizzer]]. She is also shown to have a love of music and is a bit of a tomboy in contrast to [[Jewel]]'s girly personality.

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
In ''101 Dalmatians: The Series'', Two-Tone is a minor character and one of the members of [[Mooch (101 Dalmatians)|Mooch]]'s gang, along with [[Dipstick]] and Whizzer. Her design is quite different, with the front half of her body being white and the back half black. She also sports two black ears, instead of one, and wears a blue-collar and earring on her right ear. In the TV series, Two-Tone is the only Dalmatian with green eyes.

Her personality is mainly seen as something of a valley girl, with a bit of a vain and indecisive thought pattern. She is usually seen as the second-in-command of Mooch's gang and is said to be dating Mooch himself on some occasions. She may also be friends or friendly with [[Cadpig]], as evidenced in the episode "[[Love 'Em and Flea 'Em]]".

She does show to have a strong like for boys, unable to make up her mind over whether Mooch was guilty or not in "[[Twelve Angry Pups]]", simply stating she thought he looked cute, and seeing [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] as a knight when he asks her to the dance. She seems to also have a strong fashion sense, looking through various items of clothing in the yard sale box.

Her indecisive trait is brought up in a number of episodes, examples being unsure whether she loved or hated yard sales and what to wear, in "Twelve Angry Pups" when she couldn't decide what verdict to give Mooch, and in "[[Roll Out the Pork Barrel]]" when she couldn't decide on whether to go to [[Rolly]]'s party or not.

She received an episode to herself in "Love 'Em and Flea 'Em" where, after being insulted by Mooch, she then accepts [[Lucky]]'s invitation to the Four-Legged Fall Ball as his dance partner. It is speculated that the producers either forgot she was Lucky's blood sister or presumed her one of the adopted puppies. Either way, the episode spawned off many fans pairing the two together.

<span style="line-height:22px;">In the episode "</span>[[Prima Doggy]]<span style="line-height:22px;">" Two-Tone asks for Lucky's autograph after he was chosen to star in </span>[[Cecil B. De Vil]]<span style="line-height:22px;">'s </span>[[Kanine Krunchies]]<span style="line-height:22px;"> advertisement.</span>

====Episodes where Two-Tone has speaking roles====
*"[[Love 'Em and Flea 'Em]]"
*"[[Bad to the Bone (101 Dalmatians: The Series)|Bad to the Bone]]" (albeit screaming with the rest of the gang)
*"[[Prophet and Loss]]" (implied; she's in a crowd scene and her mouth doesn't move, though her voice can be heard)
*"[[Prima Doggy]]"
*"[[Roll Out the Pork Barrel]]"
*"[[Invasion of the Doggy Snatchers]]" (attempting to shush [[Spot Chicken|Spot]] when trying to watch "Mystery Creepazoid Theatre")
*"[[Mall Pups]]"
*"[[Twelve Angry Pups]]"
*"[[Poison Ivy]]" (she is seen screaming along with the other pups when [[Ivy De Vil]] wrecks the chow tower and frames the pups for it)

==Concept Design==
[[File:Two-Tone_ConceptDesign.png|thumb|250px|Concept design of Two-Tone]]
In some concept designs of ''101 Dalmatians: The Series'', Two-Tone's design seems to portray her as a more "bad girl" type of Dalmatian, even showing her to smoke.

While her design is almost similar, her hind paws and tail are white instead of dark, like the rest of her rear end. One of her front paws is shown to be black.
These designs also suggest that, at one stage of production, Two-Tone's name was intended to be "Pants," which may explain why her design is shown the way it is.
