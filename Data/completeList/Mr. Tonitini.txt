In another episode ("[[Father's Day (The Weekenders)|Father's Day]]"), Tino is upset that his father could not come for Father's Day, but still enjoys it with his friends and their dads. He shares the same paranoid and timid nature as his son, claiming everything as a "breeding ground for bacteria", and was known in school as "Screamy Tonitini".
