('''Note:''' Although this is canonical information, it contradicts the other canonical story by Miyazaki.)

The survived Kodama seen at the end of the film later turned into Totoro, who is 1,302 years old.<ref>https://twitter.com/kinro_ntv/status/1426190874463989769</ref>

====Another Background Story====
Totoro is a remnant member of '''Totoro Tribe''', which is at brink of extinction due to ancient battles against humanity.<ref>[https://ghibli.jpn.org/report/my-neighbor-totoro/ トトロ族vs人間の戦い『となりのトトロ』の裏設定　]</ref><ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.jp/entry/story_jp_62f9ecffe4b045e6f6aec107 トトロは人間と戦って敗れた“トトロ族”の末裔だった。宮崎駿監督の構想が壮大すぎる]</ref>

Totoro has lived more than 3,000 years. He learned how to create Jōmon pottery from humans in the Jōmon period, and also learned how to spin a spinning top from humans in the Edo period.<ref>[https://twitter.com/castle_gtm/status/1030435353159585792?t=A_dXiit34SHusE-HrbLVsw 中トトロとチビトトロが隠れていたのは縄文土器です。トトロは3000年以上生きており、縄文人から土器の作り方を習ったり、土器を貰ったりして、それをドングリ入れとして長い間大事に使ってきました。#となりのトトロ]</ref>

===''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''===
Totoro is the titular character of the [[Studio Ghibli]] film. He is a kind, giant creature who befriended two young girls named [[Mei Kusakabe|Mei]] and [[Satsuki Kusakabe]], who moved into a nearby house. He lived in a  forest with his family and was often seen with the girls sometimes, such as standing right next to them in the rain with an umbrella.

===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Totoro is one of the toys owned by [[Bonnie Anderson]]. He first appears when Bonnie is seen playing with her toys. He is shown to sleep with Bonnie and her other toys. Woody gives him a hug when he finds [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s [[Andy's House|house]]. At the end of the film, he is present when Woody introduces Bonnie's toys to Andy's toys.

In the end credits, he is seen juggling the [[Little Green Men|Aliens]] in front of the [[Mr. Potato Head|Potato]] [[Mrs. Potato Head|Heads]]. He later watches a Shakespearean play with his new friends and Bonnie's toys. He is also seen helping [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] build a spaceship and watching him and [[Jessie]] dance. He is also shown to be stronger than the other toys, as while Buzz found it difficult to lift the cardboard spaceship, Totoro had no trouble at all.

==Trivia==
*Totoro's name is derived from ''Neighborhood Troll in Tokorozawa''.
*His appearance is based on the horned owl, and his name during concepts was ''Miminzuku'', derived from ''Mimizuku'', the [[Japan]]ese name for "horned owl".
*When asked about the cameo of Totoro in ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', [[John Lasseter]] said, "We do little homages in our films, and we thought it was a very appropriate homage to let [Miyazaki and his film company] Studio Ghibli know how much they mean to us."<ref>[http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/17/pixar-chief-discusses-totoro-cameo-in-toy-story-3-trailer/ Pixar Chief Discusses Totoro Cameo In ''Toy Story 3'' Trailer]</ref> Hayao Miyazaki and John Lasseter have been longtime friends, and Pixar has helped with the localization of several of his films.
**John Lasseter is a self-professed fan of Hayao Miyazaki and all of his Studio Ghibli films. When Disney made a deal with Studio Ghibli to release a majority of their films in the [[United States|U.S.]], Lasseter introduced all of the films and narrated a majority of the extra contents in the DVD releases.
*Totoro made his signature wide grinning smile three times at the end of ''Toy Story 3''.
**The first time was before the end credits when [[Woody]] was introducing [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys to [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]'s toys.
**The other two times were during the end credits: when he was juggling the [[Little Green Men|Aliens]] and during the dance sequence between [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] and [[Jessie]].
