==Background==
===Personality===
Edward is a caring, soft-spoken, and loving husband and father. He has faith in his family that they will be happy while he's gone away to fight the Nazi and Fascist Regimes in Eastern Europe and Northern [[Africa]]. While it is unknown if he believes in [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] or not, the opening scene featuring in which he stands with Wendy while she points out [[Neverland]] to Jane and Danny shows that he has no problem with her stories of Peter Pan and Neverland. It can be assumed he dislikes Adolf Hitler no less than anyone else, and wants the Germans to pay for their unprovoked aggression and attempts to exact revenge for the Treaty of Versailles.

==Appearances==
===''[[Return to Never Land]]''===
In the beginning, Edward is first seen holding Jane and standing next to Wendy, who is holding Danny, and together, they look out the [[Nursery|nursery]] window to which Wendy points to Neverland (second star to the right and straight on 'til morning). Later on in the film, it is learned that World War II has broken out and that many men have been asked to leave their families to protect their country from the impending attack by the Nazi Regime, which has just annexed [[France]] and installed a [[Wikipedia:Vichy France|puppet government]]. So Edward is drafted to fight in the war, and hugs his family goodbye, telling them that he'll be home before they know it, and he also assigns Jane to take care of Wendy and Danny while he's away fighting the forces of Hitler andÂ Benito Mussolini. Edward climbs into the army truck and tells his family one last time that he loves them as it leaves. He isn't seen throughout the film but is mentioned by Jane that he left her in charge after it is decided that all the children are being evacuated to the country because of the [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz#:~:text=The%20Blitz%20was%20a%20German,German%20word%20for%20'lightning'. Luftwaffe's nightly bombing raids] on [[London]] in the lead-up to Operation Sea Lion, which eventually fails due to the Royal Air Force, civilian action, and massive losses on the Soviet front (which eventually led [[Germany]] to lose the war). In the end, after Jane returns home from Neverland, and as she, Wendy, and Danny watch Peter fly back there, the army truck pulls up to their house. Edward gets out, returning home after being evacuated from Dunkirk, France with the rest of the military there. The allies pulled out after Hitler called off Operation Sea Lion in order to focus on Operation Barbarossa (invasion of the Soviet Union), although the Third Reich still continued to occupy France. Wendy, Jane, and Danny go out to reunite with Edward, and Peter and [[Tinker Bell]] fly home to Neverland.

==Trivia==
*In the original story, his name is not mentioned when Wendy grew up and married him.
*Unless he would have resigned his commission by then, he would have probably taken part in the Allied invasion of Normandy, or D-Day, four years later.
*While Jane is in Neverland, she has two flashbacks. The first one shows him comforting her just before he leaves for war.
*As the film takes place in [[1940]], his return at the end of the film means that he was most likely one of the soldiers ferried back across the English Channel during the Evacuation of Dunkirk.
