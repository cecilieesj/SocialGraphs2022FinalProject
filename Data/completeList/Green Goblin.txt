{{Quote|Peter, Peter, Peter. No good deed goes unpunished. You can thank me later.|Green Goblin|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}
'''Green Goblin''' (real name '''Norman Virgil Osborn''') is a fictional supervillain from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries and the father of [[Harry Osborn]]. However, upon taking an experimental serum, he became the supervillain known as the Green Goblin. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Willem Dafoe]] reprised his role as Green Goblin in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', after appearing in the non-MCU ''Spider-Man'' film trilogy directed by [[Sam Raimi]].

The Green Goblin was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.

====''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''====
[[Willem Dafoe]] reprises the role of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin from the [[Sam Raimi]] ''Spider-Man'' trilogy in this film as the main antagonist. [[Doctor Strange]]'s botched spell brings Norman along with other villains from their own universes into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], due to their knowledge of Peter Parker being Spider-Man. Norman struggles with his Goblin split personality and tries to rid it by disposing of his glider in an alleyway and smashing the Goblin mask. 

Later, he heads to a shelter ran by [[Aunt May|May Parker]] to get help from her nephew Peter, only to realize it is a different Peter than the one from his universe. Norman decides to help Peter out to develop cures for the other Spider-Man foes as a way to redeem them, or else they will be sent back to their own universe to die, which includes Norman himself. But the Goblin persona takes back control and sabotages the plan, and launches an attack on [[Happy Hogan]]'s condo. After a fight with Peter, Goblin throws a pumpkin bomb and injures May Parker, before flying off. The explosion proves lethal as she dies of her injuries.

The MCU Spider-Man, along with two other alternate universe Spider-Men, [[the Amazing Spider-Man]] and [[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]] (the latter being from Osborn's universe), team up to battle the villains and cure them. Goblin arrives to face off with them, and has a face off with the MCU Spider-Man who comes close to impaling Goblin with his glider. Goblin's Spider-Man intervenes and prevents the young Peter from striking him down. Goblin stabs his Peter in the back, but Goblin has the cure injected into him, destroying the Goblin persona for good and reverting him back to Norman Osborn. Norman is full of regret that he had stabbed Parker, although he does survive his injury. A redeemed Norman is sent back to his universe alive and well when Strange sends the villains and the two alternate Spider-Men back to their worlds.

===[[Marvel Animation]]===
====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
Norman had worked with [[Doctor Octopus]] when Spider-Man came into publicity, intending to market an army of Spider-Man like ability soldiers that he could sell. He was not fond of Nick Fury trying to train him. Octavius asked Norman if he should have The Frightful Four destroy Midtown High, but was quickly declined when Norman revealed that his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] went there.

Osborn ordered Octavius to have something to him by the night of Harry's party, refusing to have to wait for months. Norman arrived at his house after the symbiote had seemingly been destroyed, he was glad Harry wasn't hurt and showed gratitude to Spider-Man. After the incident was averted, Norman arrived in Doctor Octopus' facility and demanded a newly improved Venom.

Norman went to see Doctor Octopus, he ordered him to give him a reason as to why he had yet to explain why he had summoned him there. Osborn felt annoyed by his son Harry, who was trying to explain to him, that he had became the new Spider-Man everyone was talking about, but, Norman stated he did not care unless it was about an improvement in his grades before Harry could get out all of his words. Norman was doing business affairs when all of a sudden Spider-Man and Venom crashed through the window and shattered the glass. Venom expressed anger at Norman for not listening to him as Harry. Norman was called back to Octavius' lab and wrote it off as a waste of his time.

Norman had noticed his son had been acting very rude and disrespectful towards him and asked him to change his tone. Harry transformed into [[Venom]] and threw him out of a window. Spider-Man saved him and Norman briefly thanked him before going off with several of his assistants and coworkers. Norman was tracked by his son and thrown against a wall. Despite this, Norman was marveled at his son's symbiote and ordered Doctor Octopus to make more like it.

As time went on, Norman grew tired of Doc Ock's stall for time. He mocked Octavius incompetence to capture Spider-Man, but when Octavius finally captured Spider-Man and brought him to his lair while messaging Osborn, Norman was for once proud of him. However when Osborn ordered Octavius to bring Spider-Man to him, Octavius snapped at him and turned his monitor off.

After witnessing Octavius defeat by Spider-Man, he fired him from Oscorp and exploded his lab, leaving no evidence behind.

Norman later re-hired Octavius and attempted to find Spider-Man's true identity, but Octavius injected him with a combination of Spider-Man's DNA and Venom's causing him to transform into the Goblin. After seeing Harry, he went after him, but later attacked the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] and made Harry into Venom. Harry shook Venom off to Goblin's disappointment. He then sampled the symbiote and left his own son to die on the Helicarrier.

Soon after, he presumably killed Spider-Man and attacked his son and Peter. He later injected Peter Parker with Venom, which turned him into [[Carnage]]. He then ordered him to defeat Spider-Man's team. After Carnage was defeated, he took it with him, but watched Harry and Peter's car drive away.

Later, S.H.I.E.L.D. caught him at an abandoned warehouse, upgrading his glider. Spider-Man and his team were sent to stop him and quickly defeated him. When he was brought onto the Tri-Carrier, he released the Venom symbiote, which took control of everyone, including himself, on board except for Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus worked together to stop him. While Spider-Man fought him in the Iron Spider armor, Doctor Octopus got to work on an anti-venom serum. Once the anti-venom was done, Spider-Man used it to remove the symbiote off of everyone on board.

When the symbiote came off of Green Goblin, he was reverted back to Norman Osborn. Spider-Man then tossed the Venom symbiote into space and destroyed it with a huge repulsor blast. Norman was later taken to a hospital to recover.

After getting back to normal life, Norman felt remorseful for his actions as the Green Goblin and decided to make up for it by becoming a superhero himself. He built the [[Iron Patriot (armor)|Iron Patriot armor]] (Iron Man's armor with Captain America's color scheme) to serve a national symbol to emphasize that he was a changed man. Unfortunately, Norman's aggressiveness and control issues carry on to his new career, and make relations with [[Spider-Man]] and his team difficult.

====''[[Spider-Man (TV series)]]''====
[[File:Norman Osborn (Earth-TRN633) from Marvel's Spider-Man (animated series) Season 1 3 001.png|thumb|right|180px| Norman Osborn in ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'']]

Norman Osborn appears in the 2017 animated series ''Marvel's Spider-Man'' as one of the primary antagonists, aside from the [[Jackal (Marvel)|Jackal]]. He is voiced by [[Josh Keaton]], who ironically enough is best known for voicing Spider-Man himself.

In this series, Osborn starts a new school called the Osborn Academy for Geniuses as a way of saving his son Harry from the embarrassment after Harry was briefly suspended from Horizon High. However it is later revealed that he hired Spencer Smythe to cause Harry's suspension to push Harry into accepting his offer for the academy. Over the course of the series, Norman recruits future and current Spider-Man rogues to attend or work at Osborn Academy, such as Vulture, Doc Ock, and considering on admitting the Jackal, He works throughout the first season plotting the downfall of the Jackal and the Spider-Men.

In the "Spider Island" story arc, Norman was one of the first victims of Jackal's spider virus and mutates into a man-spider. Having the most exposure to the chemicals gives him more control over the other Man-Spiders as the Spider-King (a role that was Captain America's in the original storyline). In the story arc, "The Hobgoblin," Norman entrusts the Hobgoblin equipment to Harry Osborn in trust that he would destroy Spider-Man, but when Harry refused, Norman donned the Hobgoblin Armour, and tried to destroy Spider-Man himself, and again supposedly died in the process. When Harry resumed control of Oscorp (Not Osborn Academy, because it was destroyed in Spider-Island), Norman was revealed to be alive (in some sort), and reveals a new, deadly project to his son.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Green Goblin was created after a serum explosion, while in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' series, Green Goblin is created after Doctor Octopus injects him with it.
*In ''No Way Home'', Green Goblin loses his mask and gains a purple hood, making him more accurate to his comic counterpart than he was in the 2002 film.
*The ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Goblin's overall concept is an amalgam of his [[w:c:marvel:Ultimate Comics|Ultimate Comics]] version's Hulk-like form and his original incarnation's intelligence and technology usage.
*Unlike his comic counterpart, the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Goblin's Glider was created by S.H.I.E.L.D. rather than himself.
*''Ultimate Spider-Man's'' incarnation is referred to on-screen as The Goblin rather than Green Goblin, though promotional materials tend to refer to him as "The Green Goblin".
*The 2017 ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series featured a new identity for the character, known as '''Dark Goblin'''.
**Dark Goblin's design is based on the Red Goblin, while featuring some influences from the Ultimate comics version.
*In the 2002 film, Osborn dies via his own glider impaling him and he almost dies in ''No Way Home'' when Peter 1 ([[Tom Holland]]) almost impales him with his glider, but this time the Goblin is saved by [[Tobey Maguire]]'s Peter Parker, aka [[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]].
*Although this version of Norman Osborn is the Green Goblin, the Norman Osborn from the ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' films does not become the Green Goblin and dies due to an ongoing illness. Instead his son, [[Harry Osborn]], takes on the alter ego like how Harry from the Sam Rami films becomes the "New Goblin" after the death of his father in the 2002 film.
