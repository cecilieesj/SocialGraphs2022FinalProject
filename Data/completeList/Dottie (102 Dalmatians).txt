'''Dottie''' is [[Chloe Simon]]'s dog, [[Dipstick]]'s wife, and mother to [[Domino]], [[Little Dipper]], and [[Oddball]] in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]''.

==Background==
In her first and only appearance, Dottie appears as your average Dalmatian, with no specific or special spots or much indicated personality to speak of. She does get a revamp in the game ''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''; however, where she has a pink nose and a purple collar, and what appears to be a similar type of pendant as [[Oddball]] wears. She seems worried about her puppies and what's become of them, but not much else is shown or indicated about her personality as a whole.

She is shown to have a similar appearance in promotional clip art as in the game, sporting a pink nose as well as a dog tag with a circular row of dots around the edge.

==Appearances==

===''[[102 Dalmatians]]''===
Dottie is first seen at the beginning of the movie having just given birth to three puppies: [[Oddball]], [[Little Dipper]], and [[Domino]]. While [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] and [[Kevin Shepherd|Kevin]] go out on a date, she watches ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' on TV with her family and Kevin's dogs. She can be seen resting her head against Dipstick during the "[[Bella Notte]]" scene. When she is kidnapped, she stays close to her Domino and Little Dipper, along with Dipstick and a few other [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]].

===''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''===
Dottie first appears in the game as she and [[Dipstick]] tell Domino and Oddball that all of their brother and sisters are missing, and they will try to rescue them. They also warn them not to get in trouble, which the pups disobey immediately. She is later captured by [[Jean-Pierre Le Pelt|Le Pelt]], along with Dipstick, before Domino and Oddball defeat [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] and rescue them. Dottie then makes a comment on how she can still smell Cruella, saying it smells like pepper. She also wears a purple collar, unlike in the film. She is voiced by [[Barbara Dirickson|Barbara Dirikson]].

In an early demo version of the game, Oddball would have been called Dottie, and (since [[Pongo]] is in Dipstick's role for the demo game), it is possible that Perdita would have been in Dottie's role.

==Trivia==
*As mentioned above, she wears a red collar in the film and her cartoon forms, but in the 2000 video game, she wears a purple one.
*Was created solely for ''102 Dalmatians'' and has no animated counterpart. However, she has been seen in some animated concept art.
