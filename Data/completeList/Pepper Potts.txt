'''Virginia "Pepper" Potts''' is the deuteragonist of the ''Iron Man'' film series, a supporting character in ''The Avengers'' film series and a cameo character in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''. She is [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s personal secretary, executive assistant, eventually girlfriend and later wife. She gained superpowers after being bonded to the [[Extremis]] formula by [[Aldrich Killian]] in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', but is cured by Tony. She later appears as the superheroine '''Rescue''' in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', utilizing a nanotech armor built for her by Tony.

Pepper Potts was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Don Heck.

==Background==
===Biography===
Born sometime in May of the 1970s, Pepper graduated with a degree in business administration before working in the finance department of [[Stark Industries]]. After finding an error in Tony Stark's calculations, she rushed to Tony to correct the mark, forcing her way to see him, past bodyguards using pepper spray. Tony was impressed and hired her as his personal assistant, naming her Pepper as a joke.

===Personality===
Pepper evolves as a person over time from the events of the first movie. At first, it appears as if Pepper is a typical assistant as she is punctual, reliable, and claims to do everything that Tony needs of her. Despite knowing she is not the boss of Tony she is far from a pushover. Pepper knows that she deserves respect for all the hard work she does and even though it's not always delivered fully and sometimes drenched in sassy remarks, Tony never fails to show his appreciation for his assistant and friend. 

Pepper is independent, intelligent, and sometimes even brazen in her work. Although she is nowhere near as smart as her boss she possesses a keen eye for detail and never seems to fail at a task given to her and as the new CEO of Stark Industries, she proved how capable she really was. She never pretended to approve of Tony's impulsive and promiscuous life-style but also never directly tried to break him out of it. It seems that were it not for her feelings for her boss she might have quit her job ages ago. In fact, Pepper showed a certain amount of jealousy and insecurity around Tony's intimate flings which is possibly why she treated them with such subtle disdain. She is also quick to panic during action-packed moments but is willing to be in the middle of them if she can protect Tony. Ironically, Pepper does not like violence and was shocked at herself for how violent her murder of Aldrich Killian was.

After Tony's run-in with terrorists and his transformation into Iron Man Pepper became less comfortable with her job as it involved a whole new level of danger for them both. Pepper expressed her concern for Tony's safety and was on the verge of quitting in lue of helping his new superhero duties, especially when she saw bullet holes in his armor, which was far more upsetting to her than the armor itself. She changed her mind however when she realized how genuine Tony's morals were in his deeds. Being an ethically strong person herself, Pepper's loyalty to her boss remained intact.

By the time of ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'', Pepper was less nervous about Tony's dangerous new life as they were romantically involved. However, Tony's obsession with building new Iron Man suits during ''Iron Man 3'' had begun to irritate her. Even though their relationship was starting to become rocky Pepper still loved him and never tried to abandon him. Despite breaking up with him after he refused to give up the suits before ''Captain America: Civil War'', she got back together with him in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''. By the time of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Pepper was still in a relationship with Tony where she become engaged to him. She was still concerned over his safety as she begged him to come home before she lost contact with him as he disappeared into space to stop [[Thanos]] from retrieving the [[Infinity Stones]]. When Tony was rescued by [[Captain Marvel]], after Thanos succeeded in wiping out half of the universe's population, Pepper was relieved to see Tony alive and emotionally embraced him.

It turns out that her suspicions are correct, since Aldrich has been using the [[Extremis]] formula to create an army of superpowered henchmen, and he's the true mastermind behind [[A.I.M.]] and the Mandarin attacks. At the end, he kidnaps Pepper, wanting her to be his bride, and injects her with the Extremis formula.

Five years later, Tony has married Pepper and they have a daughter together named [[Morgan Stark|Morgan]]. Retiring to the countryside, Tony and Pepper have lived a peaceful normal life. After [[Scott Lang]] returns from the [[Quantum Realm]], who proposes using his Quantum Tunnel as a time machine, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Lang went to Tony and Pepper's house to request his help. Tony declines due to the fact that he finally had the life he always wanted. Pepper gives Tony her blessing to join the Avengers into reversing the Decimation, so that they could bring back those that have been lost.

Pepper would later join the other Super heroes in the Battle of Earth against Thanos' army, utilizing an armored suit created by Tony. Once Tony used the six Infinity Stones to eliminate the threat once and for all, Pepper reunited with her husband, who was dying of his wounds from the power of the Stones. She told Tony to rest as his family and friends were now safe. Pepper watched her husband die in peace, knowing he made the ultimate sacrifice.
