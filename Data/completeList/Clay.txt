'''Clay''' is a stop-motion character created by [https://web.archive.org/web/20200202171909/http://www.chiodobros.com/clay.html Chiodo Bros Productions] and voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]. Clay appeared as a mascot in interstitials that were aired on [[Playhouse Disney]] from [[2002]] to [[2005]].

==History==
Chiodo Bros Productions, a special effects group, created this character in the early 2000s.

Clay interstitials started airing in the United States in September [[2002]]. Playhouse Disney was in the process of phasing out its older interstitial material, and Clay's shorts were used to introduce shows on the block.

Until 2020, the Chiodo Bros website had a homepage for Clay that featured some of the original shorts. It is archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20200202171909/http://www.chiodobros.com/clay.html here.]

==Trivia==
*Clay shorts were phased out in 2005, when other short programs like ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]'' started to air instead. In 2007, Ooh and Aah started to appear in their own bumpers as the new "mascots" of Playhouse Disney, taking over Clay's role.
*According to Debi Derryberry in [https://www.tiktok.com/@debiderryberry/video/7055804903624854831?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id7035136834331379205 this video,] Clay is neither a boy nor a girl.
