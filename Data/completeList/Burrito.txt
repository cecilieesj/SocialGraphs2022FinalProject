Burrito is a brown-colored donkey with wings of a bird.

===Personality===
He is friendly and fun-loving. Burrito likes whistling like a bird and then brays like a real donkey.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Three Caballeros]]''===
In the ''Flying Gauchito'' segment, Burrito is discovered by [[Flying Gauchito|Gauchito]] at the peak of the mountain where Burrito's nest is at (whom Gauchito thinks he is a condor) in which Gauchito prepares to capture the flying burro. Gauchito then distracts him into eating his hat to trick him in which the gaucho jumps on him to ride on Burrito like a cowboy, After riding on him, Gauchito then trains the little burro as he plans to win thousands of pesos to be rich. After Gauchito trained him, Burrito learned new tricks and became best friends with him.

The next day, Gauchito and Burrito arrive at a festival of gauchos where Gauchito started thinking of something bigger to become richer. When Gauchito started thinking of winning 1,000 pesos for winning a racing competition, Burrito is then placed into the race where Gauchito whispers to his ears to remember the abilities he used when he rode on him and trained him. As the race begins and Gauchito is left behind, the little gaucho grabs his knife he packed and cuts the rope in order for Burrito to fly. Upon doing so, Burrito flies at a very fast speed, passes the other gauchos, and wins the race, in which Gauchito is happy that he won the bag of pesos. Upon winning the prize, Burrito flies away with Gauchito holding his leash, not taking the prize with him after the race.
