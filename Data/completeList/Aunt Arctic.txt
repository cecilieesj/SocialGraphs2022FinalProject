}}'''Aunt Arctic''' is the news reporter and editor-in-chief for the newspaper on Club Penguin Island, the Penguin Times. She is responsible for keeping all penguins around the island informed about the weekly news. She is such a skillful writer that she even has her own advice column, "Ask Aunt Arctic", where she makes it her duty to answer any troubling questions her fellow penguins might have. Any penguin can submit his or her question to Aunt Arctic for a chance at submission. She is a key character in Mission #1, in which she had lost her green and purple puffles that needed to be returned. She owned a Purple Puffle before they were available in the Pet Shop.

==History==
===''Club Penguin''===
Since she first appeared, she had a column in the local newspaper, the Penguin Times, answering questions from players. She also used this medium to express her personal opinions and her background.

Her first appearance as a meetable character was during the Penguin Play Awards in March 2009, where players who met her could obtain her autographed background.

She later revealed during [[w:c:clubpenguin:Operation: Blackout|Operation: Blackout]] that she is the Director of the EPF.
===''Elite Penguin Force''===
She is one of the first penguins you can talk to in [[w:c:clubpenguin:Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force|Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force]]. She has a minor role in the game and appears in several missions.

==Trivia==
*Despite her identity as the Director being revealed after Operation: Blackout, she is still censored on the spy phone and at mission briefings.
*Her name is a pun on the Antarctic, the natural habitat of most penguins.
