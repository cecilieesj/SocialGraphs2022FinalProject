'''Batroc''' is a supervillain who uses his jumping abilities for crime.

Batroc was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
One of Batroc's robberies is thwarted by [[Venom|someone]] who looks like [[Spider-Man]]. Batroc accepts his defeat and surrenders to go to jail, but "Spider-Man" viciously beats him and Batroc must be hospitalized.

Sometime later, when [[Electro]] caused a general shutdown, Batroc tried to take advantage of it to steal, but he was stopped by Spider-Man and his team.

===''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''===
Batroc, a former member of the French Foreign Legion who racked up over a hundred kills before being discharged, conducted a terrorist occupation on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] ship ''Lemurian Star'' with a mercenary army.

However, he was thwarted by Captain America (though not without a huge struggle between the two), although because Black Widow chose to delay aiding him in an attempt to back up data on the tanker (implied to be on Nick Fury's orders), he managed to escape into the night, leaving behind an explosive that Rogers and Romanov narrowly managed to evade.

He was eventually captured the day afterwards and interrogated. It was later revealed that he had been anonymously hired by [[Nick Fury]] as cover to retrieve data from the ship, as he suspected that S.H.I.E.L.D. may have been compromised

===''[[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]]''===
Batroc returns and does not get along with [[Sam Wilson]] and [[Bucky Barnes]] due to Batroc's history with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and Sam's battles with the villain alongside Steve when Bucky was the Winter Soldier. Batroc tries to fight [[Sharon Carter]] who ends up killing him along with lead Flag Smasher [[Karli Morgenthau]].

==Trivia==
*Georges St-Pierre said that Batroc will return to the MCU someday despite his death in [[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]].<ref>[https://www.screengeek.net/2022/06/17/mcu-surprise-character-return-actor-comments/ MCU Surprise Character Return “For Sure” Happening According To Actor]</ref>
