The self-proclaimed Mistress of Gravity, Gravitina has the ability to control gravitational fields with her massive cranium. She has a crush on [[Buzz Lightyear]] and her schemes often involve futile efforts to win his affection. She is voiced by [[Kerri Kenney]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Gravitina is oftentimes petty and self-absorbed. However, deep down, she desires companionship and love. Her abnormally large head was always a source of derision, leading her to live a life of crime.

===Physical appearance===
Having turquoise and blue eyes, Gravitina is an attractive woman who isn't afraid to flaunt her assets with her eye-catching wardrobe. She is typically seen wearing a pink bodice with matching high heels and gloves. A cape accents her outfit, and she wears a gem necklace that floats around her neck.

Gravitina's most prominent physical trait, however, is her abnormally large cranium. It is almost reminiscent of a planet, given it has its own "planetary ring" and three floating spherical objects reminiscent of tiny moons that circle it. It is a source of much ridicule for her, given most beings openly mock her for it. When she was finally arrested after she, Buzz, and Mira escaped from the space station she had been using with the Evil Buzz Lightyear from a parallel dimension to launch solar flares at Star Command and Capital Planet, her cranium was placed in a reinforced metal helmet to prevent her from using her powers as she was taken into custody, sharing a final chat with Buzz before the Space Ranger robot guards escorted her away.

===Abilities===
*'''Gravity Manipulation:''' Due to her abnormally large head, she is able to control gravity, even to the point of causing sunquakes and asteroid attacks upon celestial bodies. She can use gravity to make her enemies levitate in any direction she desires. She can also use this ability to manipulate her own personal gravitational field, allowing her to levitate and presumably reduce the weight of her large head.
