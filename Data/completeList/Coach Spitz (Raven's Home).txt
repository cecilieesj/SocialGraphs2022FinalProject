'''Coach Spitz''' is a character on the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Raven's Home]]''. He served as a substitute for Coach Ronson, teaching [[Levi Grayson|Levi]]'s class and makes his first appearance in the episode "[[You're Gonna Get It]]". He is portrayed by Anthony Alabi.

==History==
After the regular teacher, Coach Ronson has called in ill, Spitz takes over his class. He makes himself known to the class and immediately makes it clear that he will not tolerate bad behavior, just because he is a substitute. After catching [[Booker Baxter-Carter|a student]] talking, he questions him and makes a remark on his stature. The student in return does so too, and Spitz, impressed by his style asks the tall student what his name is, to which he replies, is Booker. Spitz mistakenly thinks he's called Booger, and wonders why his parents would give him such a name, but warns off Booker when he tries to explain what his name actually is. He makes Booker team captain, and when he notices [[Levi Grayson|another student]] whispering, he makes him team captain too. After noticing how talented Booker is against the other students, Coach Spitz -praises him, giving Booker encouragement to be able to pick off the other students one-by-one. When only Levi is left, Spitz urges Booker to finish him, but Booker refuses to do so, and when Levi gets Booker out, Spitz expresses his disappointment in Booker.

During a school day, Spitz tries to buy honey-yums from the vending machine, but finds the machine isn't taking his money, so heads to his car to get some more, though finds it still doesn't. When he notes many students with snacks, knowing the vending machine doesn't work, he tries to locate the source, interrogating various students. He then see's a suspicious-looking [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Nia]], [[Tess]], Booker and Levi, and after searching their bags, still doesn't know who is selling the food.

While in gym class, Booker has a vision of Coach Spitz moon walking into the room, which he tells everyone, to let them know he's psychic. When Coach Spitz learn that the other kids are referring to Booker as a psychic, he calls Raven and lets her know.
