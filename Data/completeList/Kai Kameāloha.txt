====Passion for farming====
When Kai's SAT's come around, he asks his parents if he is able to skip them, citing that he does not feel they are necessary and will not use them in later life. Benny rebukes him, however, citing that even he uses his business degree to run the Shave Ice truck, but Kai tells him that he wouldn't need the degree.

Despite his parent's refusal, Kai skips the SAT's anyway in order to attend a volunteering position farming in a nearby village. When his parents find out, they are furious but understanding of his dedication to the cause. Nonetheless, after the owner of the farm explains that he has a degree, Kai agrees to return to school and complete the SAT's.

====Relationship with Steph====
Whilst Steph is not afraid to admit her feelings for Kai, and tells Lahela herself that she has feelings for him, Kai is reluctant to tell Steph that he has feelings for her. After an issue with Walter's birthday cake, Kai kisses Steph to stop her from freaking out. Later, he tells her that this was to stop her from freaking out, but hides the fact that he wanted to kiss her all along.

Later, he tries to tell Steph about his feelings at the Lahela dinner, but again hides these feelings and simply talks with her like they are friends. Despite his feelings, he hides these from both Steph and those around him.
