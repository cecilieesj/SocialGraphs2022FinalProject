'''RoseBud''' is a golden retriever puppy who appears, along with her four brothers, in the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' film series]].

==History==
RoseBud is the youngest puppy of her litter and the only female. She is very feisty but brave, and she also serves as the leader of the group. She wears a pink bow on her head to distinguish herself from her older siblings. She clearly hates being annoyed by her brothers' antics, particularly [[Budderball]]'s gluttonous appetite and flatulence issues. However, she cares deeply for them and is very protective of them as seen in [[Air Buddies|the first film]], where she defended them from a [[Wolf (Air Buddies)|wolf]] (who turned out to be harmless). She likes wearing all sorts of outfits and is into fashion. She lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with her famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. Her owner is Alice, a young girl who is also into fashion.
