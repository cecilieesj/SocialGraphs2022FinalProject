===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' with help from [[Tia Dalma]], Ogilvey and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat to which during battle, [[Davy Jones]] arrives and asked some of the survivors to join his crew in a plan for [[Jack Sparrow]] to settle the debt with Jones. Ogilvey and rest of the ''Dutchman'' crew members arrive at the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' nearby the ''Dutchman''. Ogilvey and the rest of the crew held the motley crew as prisoners.

During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Ogilvey watched [[Maccus]], [[Koleniko]], and [[Clanker]] play the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.

Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Ogilvey and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]]. Ogilvey was ordered to attack the motley crew just as Ogilvey chases the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]]. The crew manages to escape, but was later destroyed by the [[Kraken]].

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Ogilvey and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack, much to the captain's rage.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Ogilvey returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Ogilvey and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Ogilvey and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Ogilvey fought against the crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men. After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Ogilvey and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.
