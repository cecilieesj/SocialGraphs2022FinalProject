|quote = "Miss? I never miss."}}The '''Beetle''' (real name '''Abner Jenkins''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain who is an exceptionally skilled mercenary. Commonly hired by [[Doctor Octopus]], Beetle regularly ran afoul of [[Spider-Man]], and was defeated on almost every occasion. He had temporarily joined the first Sinister Six.

He later became a member of the [[Masters of Evil]]. However, when they went undercover as the superhero team the [[Thunderbolts]], Beetle posed as the high-tech flying hero '''Mach IV. '''However, after [[Baron Zemo]]'s treachery, Jenkins disposed of his identity as the Beetle and fully became Mach IV, now a genuine hero.

Beetle was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Carl Burgos.

==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
At an unknown point in the past, Beetle met his first defeat at hands of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent [[Phil Coulson]].

In the episode "Beetle Mania", he targets the Daily Bugle for J. Jonah Jameson's campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains (i.e. springing MODOK from prison and dealings with Doctor Doom). When he fights the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees, Beetle's assassination attempt is stopped by Spider-Man and is knocked out by Power Man, however, Jameson was on monitor renderings the whole time unlike Mary Jane Watson actually being in the office. In the episode "The Attack of the Beetle", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their previous encounter as well as Phil Coulson for being 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use May Parker as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode "Hawkeye", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier but is defeated and captured by Spider-Man and Hawkeye. In the episode "The Sinister Six", Beetle appeared as a member of the Sinister Six alongside Doctor Octopus, Electro, the Rhino, Kraven the Hunter, and the Lizard. Along with the group, he fought Spider-Man. When the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees arrive, Beetle fights with Nova but is defeated by Iron Fist after Spider-Man's teammates switch opponents and is later detained in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. In the episode "Agent Venom", Beetle is hired by Taskmaster to obtain a sample of the Venom symbiote, leading to a fight with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom. While Spider-Man deals with Taskmaster, Beetle is eventually defeated by Agent Venom. In the episode "New Warriors", Beetle is among the escaped supervillains along with Doc Ock, the Scorpion, and the Green Goblin during a showdown between Taskmaster's team and the New Warriors. Along with his fellow supervillains, Beetle is eventually defeated by the New Warriors. In the episode "Contest of Champions" Pt. 1, Beetle - alongside Abomination and Executioner - are sent by Grandmaster to obtain Spider-Man for the contest against Collector.
