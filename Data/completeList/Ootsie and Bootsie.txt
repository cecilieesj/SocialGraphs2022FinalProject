==History==
They can be rather stuck up. Nevertheless, they can also be good friends to everyone in Lake Hoohaw when they want to and really just want to have fun like the other kids. They often completes sentences in tandem with each other. Since their parents are rich, Bootsie and Ootsie always have the latest toys, but often grow bored with them. In fact, they have so many toys that they don't play with that, according to [[Walter Raccoon]], they actually toss out bushels of them every morning.<ref>"[[Munchy's Sinking Feeling]]"</ref>
