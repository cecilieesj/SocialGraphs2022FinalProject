==Role in the film==
Celia is [[Anthony Cooper]]'s attractive, but bossy girlfriend. She often tells him that in his texts, he'd have to include hearts with a "less than and a three" or an "XOXO". During a phone call, she hangs up after hearing him trash-talking to his younger brother, [[Alexander Cooper|Alexander]], while assuming that insults are aimed at her. The next day, she forgives Anthony and decides to go to the prom with him.

At one point in the film, Celia tries to call Anthony while he is taking his driver's test, which results in him failing and the van being totaled. When he picks her up, she is displeased about him failing the test, having to ride in the same van as his family, and having to eat at Nagamaki. In the end, she gets stood up after realizing that she isn't as important as his family and that it is only the ''junior'' prom. While angered by this, she gets in her friend's car and attends herself.

==Trivia==
*It's implied that she is allergic to shrimp.
*Her personality is similar to Vana Glama from ''Sidekick'', because they both bossed their boyfriends around and are both selfish and attractive.
*Despite being the main antagonist, she didn't have many traits that would classify her as "evil".
