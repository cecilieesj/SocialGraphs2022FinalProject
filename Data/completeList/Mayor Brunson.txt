'''Mayor Stu Brunson''' is the elected leader of the town [[Brighton]] and supporting character of the series ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
The Mayor is an overweight man with brown hair wearing a blue suit and red tie.

==Role in series==
While reminiscing about the town in "[[Getting the Band(shell) Back Together]]", Patty points out the city’s former bandshell and telling happy stories, and explains that a tornado blew through town and destroyed it years ago. Molly is inspired to somehow bring the bandshell back and we see her pitch an idea for a 60,000 seat arena during her dad’s town council meeting and The mayor told that he loves her creativity, but that arena is not feasible.

BUT WAIT! Molly opens the arena model to show a more reasonable model of a brand new bandshell that she baited and switched the council into hearing about. However, even that model is rejected as the town simply doesn’t have the money to build it.

After Molly get the money and help to build the band shel herself  the mayor congratulates her while asking “Who’s going to play” in the new bandshell making Molly realize she forgot that.

In "[[The Turnip Twist]]", Molly’s dad is upset that Perfectborg is the most perfect town in the midwest over Brighton, and sets out to make sure Brighton is crowned the best in the midwest, and sets out to meet the mayor, pitching a festival that will draw out the crowd. The town does have a festival though, the turnip festival!

==Trivia== 
*As revealed in "[[Citizen McGee]]", he is not married and is apparently the last in his family line.
*
*The ghost of his mom also reveals that his first name is Stu.
