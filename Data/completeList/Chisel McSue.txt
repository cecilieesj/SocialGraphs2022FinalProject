}}'''Chisel McSue''' is an enemy of [[Scrooge McDuck]], originally featured in [[Carl Barks]]' ''[[The Horseradish Story]]''.
==History==
Scrooge almost lost his fortune because he could not produce a single heirloom. He also accused Scrooge of not being a true [[Scotland|Scot]]. Scrooge and his nephews managed to defeat him after staging a mock Battle of Culloden.

In the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[Down and Out in Duckburg]]", a character named [[Fritter O'Way]] with the same background took over Scrooge's fortune until Scrooge recovered the cargo sunk with Seafoam's ship, the ''Golden Goose''.

His great-great-grandfather, Swindle McSue, is the man whose case of horseradish Seafoam McDuck agreed to transport in 1776. Because of that incident, Scrooge almost lost his fortune.
