'''The Ghost Council''' are major characters in the series ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. They are a group of ghosts that enforce the laws in the Ghost World.

==Members==
*'''[[The Chairman]]: '''A mostly emotionless grim reaper like spirit that can only communicate through grunts, growls, and hisses. He leads the council, and he judges whether a ghost does a good job at their tasks of spreading misery or not, sending those who fail to do so to '''The Flow of Failed Phantoms''' (though in the extremely rare event that he gives said ghost another chance, he will recede the punishment).
*'''Barrister Ghosts'''
**'''Lucretia:''' (Voiced by [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]])- A purple ghost. She is toothless and she is quite short, though her hair just about doubles her height. She sits on the far left of the barristers.
**'''Sir Alister:''' (Voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])- A green ghost. He speaks in a very haughty voice and seems to be the most willing to taunt others. He also sits in one-of-two of the middle barristers. Before he was a ghost, he wanted to play the lute, but his father was not very supportive of his passion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_t7BAL6Tg&ab_channel=DisneyChannel|title=Enjoy Your Afterlife - The Ghost and Molly McGee - Season 2 Music Video - Disney Channel Animation|website=YouTube|accessdate=July 23, 2022}}</ref>
**'''Bartholomew:''' (Voiced by [[Greg Baldwin]])-A blue ghost. He seems to be the grumpiest of the council and also happens to be short like Lucretia. He sits on the far right of the barristers.
**'''Grimbella:''' (Voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]])- A pink ghost. Like Alister, she speaks in a very haughty, British-accented tone of voice, wears pink lipstick. She sits in one-of-two of the middle barristers.

==Background==
The ghost council are the most powerful, baddest, and bureaucratic ghosts that ever existed, feared by all other ghosts in the ghost world.

When not doing paperwork to make sure all "lesser" ghosts are doing their jobs right, or interviewing said ghosts on their performances, all the council members... although the Chairman normally remains fixated on each town's misery meter during the council's absence... spend their free time at a club called the Haughty Haunts Club, which is so strictly members only that it has its own bouncer to keep less popular ghosts (especially Scratch) out.

They seem to have twisted standards when it comes to each ghost's monthly scare quota, as they ignore the fact Scratch scared the pizza man multiple times yet point out he's one scare short when they found out "Billy Palmer" and "William Palmer" are the same person.

==Role in the Series==
They made their first appearance in the [[The Curse|series premiere]] where after they reviewed a ghost from Cedar Valley and her failed attempt to cause misery there (she explains that she couldn't compete with the animal shelter due to them having puppies, which the Chairman precisely expect her to do) and the Chairman sentences her to spend all eternity in The Flow of Failed Phantoms.

== Trivia ==

* Bartholomew was the first Ghost Council member whose name was revealed. It was first revealed in a tweet by Bill Motz on October 2, 2021.<ref>[https://twitter.com/InevitablyBill/status/1444372121250115584 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref>
** Even though there wasn't a direct reference to Bartholomew being one of the barristers in the first tweet, a later tweet revealed Bartholomew was indeed a ghost, posted on November 14, 2021<ref>[https://twitter.com/InevitablyBill/status/1459969935346647050 <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>]</ref>, so viewers who saw the tweets and read the voice credits could have possibly connected the dots.
