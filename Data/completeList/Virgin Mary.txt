'''Mary''' is a character from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[1978]] animated Christmas short film ''[[The Small One]]'', being the Virgin Mary from the Bible. Although her name is never mentioned in the entirety of the film, it is pretty obvious that she is the one who rides [[Small One (character)|Small One]] with her husband, [[Joseph]], to Bethlehem. His line in the short film: "I need a gentle donkey to carry my wife to Bethlehem." says it all. Their son is Jesus.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Small One]]''===
Mary only appeared for a short while in the film, because she was seen at the very end. She was first seen with her husband, Joseph, riding on Small One (bought by Joseph from [[The Boy|a boy]] earlier at night) while waving good-bye to the boy from a long distance and then, continuing their journey to the stable in Bethlehem where [[Wikipedia:Star of Bethlehem|a bright star]] later shone; symbolizing the birth of their son, Jesus.

===''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''===
The "[[Hellfire]]" sequence of the film consists primarily of [[Judge Claude Frollo|Frollo]]'s prayer to blessed Mary ever Virgin. Roman Catholics do pray to blessed her to ask her to pray to God on their behalf, and because of her absolute purity, she is the perfect saint to ask regarding his inappropriate attraction to [[Esmeralda]]. However, in so doing Frollo reveals himself to be filled with sinful pride, lust, envy, and vengefulness.

Earlier in the film, [[Archdeacon|the Archdeacon]] sang "you can never run nor hide what you've done from the eyes, the very eyes of Notre Dame". This was the his way of saying that, from Heaven, blessed Mary bore witness to Frollo's murder of [[Quasimodo]]'s parents, and thus he needed to do something to avoid being damned by her. This is what convinced him to adopt Quasimodo as his son.

==Trivia==
*During the making of the "[[Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria|Ave Maria]]" segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'', there were suggestions to have an image of the Virgin Mary appear in the last shot when it was intended to end with the monks (and possibly nuns) entering an actual church.
