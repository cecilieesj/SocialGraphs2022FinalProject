===''[[Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century]]''===
In April of 2049, Zenon is 13 years old and has been living up in Space for the past 8 years ever since she was five years old. After getting into trouble with the space station's commander, [[Commander Plank|Edward Plank]], Zenon's parents punish her by grounding her to Earth to live with her single and childless Aunt Judy, who is afraid of space. After Aunt Judy picks up Zenon she takes her out to eat at a local restaurant where she meets her future classmates Andrew, Greg, [[Margie Hammond]] and Matt who are sitting at the table next to where she is sitting and eating with her Aunt Judy. Greg falls in love at first sight with Zenon. [[Margie Hammond]] goes up to Zenon and starts making fun of her outfit. Later that day right before Zenon goes to bed she asks her Aunt Judy about how come she has never gotten married or have any children of her own and Aunt Judy replies to Zenon’s question and tells her that she is scared to take risks and to put herself out there. On Zenon’s first day of school on Earth she ends up in the same class with Greg, [[Margie Hammond]] and Matt. Later that day at lunch Zenon is buying herself lunch at school then she realizes that she doesn’t have any money then Greg helps Zenon out by paying for her lunch with his own money. On Earth, Zenon experiences trouble fitting in with other kids, but Greg had his eye on her. Zenon considered her space-station stories and slang weird to be avoided. [[Margie Hammond]] gives Zenon a hard time by making fun of her. Likewise, Zenon considers the children at her school woefully out of touch with pop culture. One day during Gym class the entire class is in line to practicing swimming in the school’s pool. [[Margie Hammond]] who is standing right behind Zenon in line pushes Zenon into the pool on purpose. Greg jumps in to save Zenon from drowning and saves her life. To assuage her homesickness, Zenon often communicates with her best friend on the space station, [[Nebula Wade]], via a video phone tablet. Eventually, Zenon makes friends on earth with two boys, Andrew and Greg. Along the way, the kids learn to be more accepting of one another and to look past first impressions.

During her time grounded on Earth, Zenon uncovers a plot masterminded by station bigwig Parker Wyndham to crash the computers of her space station home and thus the station itself, which will put everyone on it in danger. When Zenon tries to warn her parents of the danger, [[Commander Plank]], who sees all children as troublemakers, convinces Zenon's parents not to listen to her. He believes that her story is only a ploy to get her back onto the space station so that she can attend an upcoming concert by her idol [[Proto Zoa]], who is about to perform the world's first space concert. With the help of her friends Andrew and Greg, Zenon must find a way to save the space station and her family. Andrew creates a computer virus to counteract that deployed by Wyndham, and it is then up to Zenon to to get the disk to the station. Hoping to somehow sneak onto a space launch, Zenon goes to the launch yard, where [[Proto Zoa]] and his band are about to depart for their concert. Giving her new friends a farewell and Greg, their first "unawkward" kiss. In a lucky break, [[Proto Zoa]] recognizes that Zenon as the lucky fan that won his "Dance with Me" contest and takes her with his band, Mr. Wyndham, his assistant Lutz, and Aunt Judy on the launch to the station. Upon arrival, [[Commander Plank]] is shocked to see Zenon on the station but is smitten with Aunt Judy. After hearing Zenon's story, the commander still has trouble believing her, especially when Wyndham accuses her of sabotaging the station. Against all odds, Zenon manages to use the computer virus program that Andrew created to save the space station, and Wyndham and Lutz get arrested. Afterward, everyone enjoys the Microbe concert. Zenon on her tablet waves to Greg goodbye.

[[File:Zenon Kar-The Zequel.jpg|thumb|Zenon in 2051]]Two years later in 2051,  Zenon is 15 years old and has been dating Greg for about two years. One day Greg breaks up with Zenon due to long-distance and later that day Zenon shows her friend Nebula how to play a new game and how to play it she inadvertently empties out Commander Planks Office and is assigned work detail in the Alien Patrol lab. Worse the space station is now under command of the military and General Hammond is assigned to command the station. [[Commander Plank]], very furious, comes out of his office and stops Zenon. Even worse, he assigns Zenon to look after his daughter who turns out to be her old nemesis, [[Margie Hammond|Margie]], who's demanding and threatens to have her dad kick Zenon and her family off the space station if Zenon doesn't obey her.

Zenon then discovers that her space station is being decommissioned due to damage from the plot by Wyndum and Lutz and sneaks down to Earth to try and stop it after getting a message from aliens that seem to want to meet with [[Proto Zoa]], but [[Margie Hammond|Margie]] wants to go too and sneaks down to Earth as well, but making it look like Zenon forced her to go with her.

The aliens turn out to be friendly and communicating with Zenon telepathically, reveal that they have been lost in space for three years and need the ship's navigation charts to get home, thinking it impolite to just take them.

After getting the charts, they then tow the ship back to the space station where General Hammond refuses to relent, saying the space station is too badly damaged and must be destroyed. Then his daughter [[Margie Hammond|Margie]] stands up to him for once, but it isn't enough until the aliens return and repair the space station as a thank-you gift for helping them. With the space station saved, [[Commander Plank]] and General Hammond are assigned to command it together then [[Commander Plank]] and Aunt Judy get married. At the wedding that [[Proto Zoa]] plays at, dedicating his new song to Zenon having been revitalized by the whole experience. It's also realized that the aliens were actually trying to communicate with Zenon, not [[Proto Zoa]], and were using the transmission of his old concert to do so. [[Margie Hammond|Margie]] convinces her father to let her stay and she and Zenon become friends while Zenon gets a possible love interest in Orion.
