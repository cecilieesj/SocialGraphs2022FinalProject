In "A Monumental Crisis!", Teamo's class is on a field trip conducted by Stakas that they greatly dislike. This lack of respect gets her so mad that she makes a plan to steal a lot of historical monuments and take it to her lair. She manages to steal 3 cactus, hands, an igloo, and the Lobster of Liberty, despite Teamo's attempts to stop her and her henchmen, the Dousens. Eventually, she is caught and forced to surrender.
