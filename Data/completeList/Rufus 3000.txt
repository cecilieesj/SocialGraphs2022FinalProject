'''Rufus 3000''' is a character from the animated television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''.

==Description==
The designation for the leader genetic-modified carbon-copies of [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]] first and only sighted in ''[[Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time]]''. Little is known of him other than his hardcore attitude and determination to restore the timeline to what it was supposed to be, a goal that was accomplished by Team Possible once he had given them the ability to time travel to pursuit. He is also noted for making cookies.    

==History==
Little is known of Rufus 3000, and with the destruction of the Tempus Simia, he never technically existed. What is known is that he was part of the Future's resistance forces against [[Shego]]. He was in charge of the Shegoton Resistance's naked mole rat division, based on his differing uniform from the others.

He is orthograde, and can freely speak English as well as manage technical equipment and weaponry. It is unknown who created him and the other hyper-evolved naked mole rats but it's possible that it was based on [[DNAmy]]'s work, given she does not appear in the timeline. There were at least 3000 of these naked mole rats.

==Trivia==
*He is the only hyper-evolved naked mole rat that is given any characterization and wears blue instead (presumably an officer uniform). The other naked mole rats wear red
