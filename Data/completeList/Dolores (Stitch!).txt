==Background==
===Personality===
Dolores is a quiet and not very talkative girl. Unlike her classmates, she is heavily immersed in science, especially mathematics. She has a friend with whom she shares interests and has a bit of a rivalry, as shown in the school competition. She considers [[Jessica (Stitch!)|Jessica]] and her gang to be dumb girls who are trying to boost their self-esteem by bullying other people. The only classmate with whom she communicates normally is [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and they can even be called friends. Once they even grouped together to scare Jessica; another time they went together to get the wishing flower. She also treats [[Stitch]] well, although she openly considers him a rowdy. In addition to her hobbies for science, she is interested in other things; for example, when the winners of the "little queen" contest were voiced in the competition, Dolores was one of those who watched the results. She also has a sense of humor, as shown when she pulled a friendly prank on Yuna on the bus. Dolores also has a stronger respect for [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]; she is interested in [[Jumba's Ship|his spaceship]] and inventions and collaborated with him to create a fake monster to make a scary day.

===Physical appearance===
Dolores is a white-skinned girl with dark gray hair, on which she wears two blue hairpins. She wears a white school shirt and a black skirt.

==Role in the series==
In "New Town", she is sitting at her school desk when [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] enters the classroom and greets her new classmates. Yuna sits down next to Dolores. Then, the girl notices [[Stitch]] and points her finger at him in surprise.

In "Yuna vs. Jessica", when Yuna tries to befriend Jessica, Dolores advises that the way to befriend Jessica is to laugh at things that aren't funny at all.

In "Spooky Toons", Dolores travels with her classmates to an island where two students will have a scary party. Hearing Jessica show off that she's not afraid of anything, Dolores and Yuna decide to join the event to scare Jessica. They both come up with a monster and Dolores tells the class a legend that if someone sneezes that night, the ghost will haunt them. Then came [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Wendy Pleakley|Pleakley]], who decide to help them in the event. Dolores genuinely admires Jumba's intellect, looking at his starship and the equations on the blackboard. Together they made a fake monster that scared Jessica, and then comes [[Toons]] and [[Spooky]], who fell under the influence of [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]. They revive people's fears and Dolores noticed that most of them are afraid of women. Although Dolores is not subject to the experiments, Jumba and Pleakley have written a complex equation that Dolores cannot solve, which scares her.

In "P.J. 2.0", when Stitch, under the influence of coffee, trashes the city, Dolores advises Yuna for a lawyer. Then [[PJ (Lilo & Stitch)|PJ]] played a prank on her when he put the money on the ground and Dolores fell because of this prank.

In "Spike 2.0", she participates in a brain contest between schools. She was on the same team with Jessica and Yuna, and Dolores admitted that she alone would have been enough on the team. She almost makes it to the finals, but gets influenced by Spike and becomes temporarily stupid and is eliminated from the competition. She runs away in tears to the beach, where she was kidnapped by Hämsterviel, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], and [[Reuben]]. However, Stitch manages to save her, and Yuna reveals that a small repechage competition has been arranged, which allows them to return to the main. They compete in the final round and win by winning a set of textbooks.

In "Sprout 2.0", she goes with the crew to an island in search of a wishing flower. Dolores says she wants to be the youngest astronaut in human history. Arriving there, a disguised Gantu and Reuben tell them that there is only one flower left and the team splits up to get the flower for themselves. [[Jessica (Stitch!)|Jessica]] mixes up the signs to confuse the others, but Dolores follows the compass and doesn't believe the sign. Upon reaching the flower, they fall into a trap where they are met by a mutated Sprout using 627's DNA. They capture him, and then Gantu and Reuben, and after a bit of a fight, flies back home.

In "Stitch Goes to Wishlanda", she was one of the few who was not interested in Wishland, because there only children's wishes come true, which are unlikely to help her solve the problem in science. At the end, when the visitors have been hypnotized to capture Stitch, Dolores decides to come here and uses a wish from Wishy-Washy to make things go back to normal.

In "Flute", she was in class with [[Bragg|Flute]], whose math skills delighted Dolores. They made a bet that if she could solve his equation, he would dance upside down. Dolores wins the bet and Flute grants the request.

In "Witch", she, along with Yuna, [[Hiroman]], Jessica, Toriko, and Makiko, go to a scary house to clean up for the holiday. There they find a book and a box. The book was in Latin, but it was not difficult for Dolores to read it, because she knows this language. In the book it was written not to open the box under any circumstances, because a witch was imprisoned there. However, Stitch accidentally opens the box and Dolores yells at him for it. At first, everything was fine, but then the witch began to appear and the team runs out of the house. Later, they discover that they forgot Jessica there and want to come back for her, but then she leaves the house and complains that she was forgotten. Dolores had a witch's box open and Jessica asked to close it and then calls Stitch to help her decorate the school for the holiday, which Dolores called unusual for Jessica. Then it turns out that the witch moved into Jessica and controls her body. They tried to stop her, but fall under her influence and began to dance uncontrollably. Then Jumba and Pleakley arrive and they began to think together how to defeat the witch. Dolores reads in the book that the witch is afraid of mirrors and using large mirrors, they defeat the witch and save Jessica.

In "The Petite Queen", Dolores was one of the people watching the results of the competition.

In "Toddler-fier", she, like her friends, falls under the temporary influence of the [[Babyfier]] and was taken care of by [[Tigerlily Sakai|Tigerlily]] and Stitch. Then they returned to normal.

In "A Very Stinky Christmas", Yuna and Stitch see Lionel walking along with Dolores and discussing which equations they will give each other to solve. Yuna then sees Dolores in her room writing about a present for Lionel, and Dolores is embarrassed and afraid that everyone knows she is in love with him.

In "Chocolate Stitch", she was with the others at the chocolate factory where [[Fudgy]] went berserk and ate all of Dolores' classmates and herself. While they were inside him, Stitch fought him and won, summoning his friends from captivity.

In "King Meega!", she, along with the others, tries to capture [[Checkers]] in order to become rulers for a while. However, Dolores never caught Checkers, but was in the servants of the cat, [[Hiroman]], Jessica, Yuna, and Hämsterviel. Until Stitch captured Checkers and everything went back to normal.

In "Dark-End", she was one of Stitch's supporters in the fight against [[Dark End]] and tried to help him by fighting alongside [[PJ (Lilo & Stitch)|PJ]] and [[Squeak]]. Then, with the support of his friends, Stitch defeats the Dark End and sends [[Delia]], Gantu, Hämsterviel, and Reuben to prison.

==Trivia==
*Dolores is somewhat similar to the [[Taro (Stitch!)|Taro]] from the anime's first season, as they both wear glasses, have black hair, have white colors in their clothes, and neither of them are very talkative.
**However, Dolores has a wider range of knowledge, since Taro is more interested in biology than in other sciences.
