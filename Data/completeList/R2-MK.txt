==History==

===Background===
R2-MK was an astromech droid owned by Jedi master Mickey Mouse. The droid's dome head is decorated with stylized Mickey Mouse ears with the droid's name on its back. R2-MK served as a partner for Mickey as a Jedi knight, co-piloted his Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, and aided him in promoting the [[Tomorrowland]] starport hub of [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]].

===Development History===
R2-MK was created in [[2010]] to tie in with [[Star Wars]] related events at the Disney Parks. His design was inspired by Mickey Mouse and he was named after [[R2-D2]] and Mickey (MK). The droid was predominately made for merchandise but did make appearances outside of that.
: "The creative 'Forces' at Disney and [[Lucasfilm]] are proud to announce an all-new character coming to the Disney Parks in April 2010. Every Jedi needs his own astromech droid, and Jedi Mickey is no exception. This spring we will be introducing Jedi Mickey's own droid, R2-MK."
