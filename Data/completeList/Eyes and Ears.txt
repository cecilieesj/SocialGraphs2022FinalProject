'''Eyes and Ears''' are characters from the [[2019]] [[Blue Sky Studios]] animated film, ''[[Spies in Disguise]]''. They are a duo of backup agents working for H.T.U.V. assisting [[Marcy Kappel]].

==Background==
Eyes and Ears are a duo of backup agents who help [[Marcy Kappel]] on her assignment. Eyes introduces herself as an agent of spectral analysis and quantum optical thermography while Ears introduces himself as an agent of sound. They support Marcy on her side throughout her mission. Though they accused Lance Sterling of stealing the M9 Assassin, they figured out that it was actually Killian who stole it, clearing out Agent Sterling's bad reputation.

==Role in the film==
[[Marcy Kappel]] enters the conference room where her fellow allies Eyes and Ears enter the room just as the two introduce and describe themselves to her just as Ears approaches [[Lance Sterling]], deactivating the weapons from him. As Marcy explains that she can only trust in facts, she tells Eyes to give her evidence which is footage from Tokyo showing [[Killian]] (with Lance's face) stealing the M9 Assassin just as Lance is accused of his bad reputation. The two then later notice Lance escaping the agency as Marcy tries to stop her but fails.

As Lance prepares to go to his car with [[Walter Beckett]] to join him to find [[Katsu Kimura]] and ask him to know where Killian is, Eyes and Ears join alongside Marcy as part of her squadron just as Marcy and her squadron chase Lance's car across the streets. As Lance commands his car to activate weapons to dispatch Marcy, Eyes, and Ears, he and Walter argue whether to use weapons or not, believing that Lance could betray H.T.U.V., despite being the agency's trusted spy to which as the two argue to know which weapon to pick, the car's computer begins to reboot due to the overlapped argument. As the computer restarts, Walter asks the AI to deploy oil slick to which upon activating the oil slick, Marcy, Eyes, and Ears are surrounded by the flaming oil slick due to what Walter did to evade them.

At a hotel riviera in Playa Del Carmen in Mexico, Eyes and Ears are tasked to find Lance as instructed by Marcy. The two and a group of guards then follow Marcy to Kimura's room where Lance would be at as Marcy instructs them to be careful when dealing with him. Ears is then told to use his weapon on the door so that he and the other agents can find Lance. Eyes and Ears then begin to chase after Lance and Walter across the hotel to which as the two escape, they and Marcy notice the soldiers trapped on serious strings, leaving the three confused.

Arriving at Venice, Eyes and Ears surround Lance and Walter who confuse Lance for Killian, alongside Marcy and her fellow soldiers to which as Marcy plans to help Walter get his job back at H.T.U.V., Eyes and Ears lower down their weapons. Later when Marcy plans to go after Killian, Eyes and Ears approach the M9 Assassin drone which carries the database device to which the two retreat along with a group of soldiers when it attacks. Later in the morning, Marcy, Eyes, and Ears confront Killian who suddenly turns into Lance only to notice the M9 Assassin taking Killian back to his lair, leaving the three confused again.

Later onboard a ship, Eyes and Ears listen to Marcy who is discussing with Jenkins, explaining to her that she lost the database, she tells her to put everyone to safety to which Marcy argues with Eyes and Ears about Killian disguised as Lance to which Jenkins explains to the three that it would be safe to say that Marcy's investigation is never going anywhere just as Marcy finds a blue pigeon feather linked to Lance.

Back at the aircraft, Marcy approaches Eyes and Ears respectively who tell her that they found no sign of Walter and Lance during their assignment. Due to Walter's plan to stop Killian, Eyes and Ears later join battle to which they notice the M9 Assassin models pass through them as start attacking the victims Killian targeted. Later, Eyes and Ears hide behind a wall as Ears receives a device that uses a voice clip of Walter making a siren sound which he fires a shockwave blast at the drones making that sound to which Ears begins blasting away the drones using his weapon.

After the battle ends, Eyes and Ears notice Killian trapped in an inflatable hug gadget caused by Walter, followed by a couple of Marcy's guards approaching him. The two later approach Lance and Walter bringing them back to their agency followed by a group of H.T.U.V. soldiers approaching the two.
