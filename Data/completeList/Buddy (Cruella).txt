'''Buddy''' is a supporting character in the [[2021]] live-action [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Cruella]]''. He is a stray mixed-breed dog, who serves as [[Cruella De Vil]]'s dog companion.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cruella]]''===
A young Estella first meets Buddy when she is thrown into a dumpster by her classmates. She discovers the small puppy in the dumpster and adopts him, bringing him home with her. They quickly became best of friends and went everywhere with one another. After Estella is withdrawn from primary school, the small family travels to London to see an [[Baroness Von Hellman|old friend]] of [[Catherine Miller|Catherine]]'s. Estella and Buddy are told to stay in the car instead of going to see the gala, though their interests are piqued and they disobey Catherine and enter the gala. Buddy runs from Estella and causes a commotion, which Estella later perpetuates, and three Dalmatians chase them out of the gala. Estella grabs Buddy and lays on the ground with him while the Dalmatians barrel past them to knock Catherine off a cliff, killing her.

Estella escapes to Regent's Park where she and Buddy meet [[Jasper and Horace]], along with their one-eyed dog [[Wink]]. The group takes refuge in an abandoned building where they remain for the rest of their young adult lives. Buddy quickly starts assisting the group of petty thieves by pickpocketing strangers, carrying wallets, and blending into situations. He walks Estella to and from work every morning, doting on her with each day. When Estella takes the moniker of Cruella, she begins to neglect Buddy and doesn't spend as much time with him. Despite this, Buddy tries to save Cruella when she is tied up by [[Baroness Von Hellman]] in an attempted murder. Buddy pulls on the ropes to untie her. He later helps her in her schemes to take down the Baroness, free an arrested Jasper and Horace, and later moves into [[Hell Hall]] alongside his companions.

==Trivia==

*Bobby, the actor portrayed Buddy, was a stray prior to the filming of ''Cruella'', but found a home after production finished.
*During the scene where Buddy unties Cruella, Bobby actually did succeed in untying Emma Stone, though the moment was cut from the film since [[John (Cruella)|John]] was supposed to save Cruella instead.
*Buddy is the sixth De Vil pet in Disney adaptations, the other five being [[Scorch]] and [[Vendella De Vil|Vendella]] in ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]],'' [[Fluffy (102 Dalmatians)|Fluffy]] in ''[[102 Dalmatians]],'' [[Dude]] in the ''[[Descendants]]'' franchise and [[Cuddles]] in ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''.
