The '''Caucasian Eagle''' is a minor character that appears in the [[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules TV Series]]. He is a giant bird who was ordered by Zeus to eat the liver of the imprisoned Titan [[Prometheus]] every day as punishment for the Titan's disobedience. 

==History==
===''[[Hercules and the Prometheus Affair]]''===
For Prometheus' disobedience, he was chained to a rock where everyday the Caucasian Eagle was ordered to eat his liver. The Eagle is first seen appearing to taunt the God, then proceeding to eat his liver. After Prometheus noticed something in his talon, he discovered that the bird had brought along an onion because he was tired of eating the same thing every day. Soon after, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] arrives to free the God after hearing of his imprisonment. He and the Eagle process to fight each other, Hercules coming out victorious after causing the Eagle to run into a rock. 

A while later, the Caucasian Eagle is seen sulking on a rock when [[Hades]] appears. The Eagle assumes he had died due to the God's presence, but after Hades tells him otherwise he asks what he's doing here. Hades then informs him that he is replacing the bird, and orders the Caucasian Eagle to show him where Hercules and Prometheus went. Eventually the two find the God and Hercules, so Prometheus proceeds to try and defend himself using a stone pillar, but he is blasted by [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]]' lighting. 

After Zeus, Hercules, Prometheus, and the other Gods have a conversation, Zeus decides that Prometheus' fate will be decided by a "trial-by-fire". Hades then proceeds to fire a bolt of energy at the Eagle, turning him into fire-powered bird that proceeds to fight Prometheus. After Hercules joins in to help Prometheus, he defeats the Eagle, causing him to turn back into his original form.
