{{Quote|Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?|The Three Little Pigs}}
The '''Big Bad Wolf''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' short ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]''. As his name suggests, he is a ruthless, conniving wolf who variably plots to eat [[The Three Little Pigs (characters)|the Three Little Pigs]]. The crafty wolf often relies on gaudy disguises to accomplish his schemes. His greatest attributes, however, are his infamous "huffs and puffs", which are powerful enough to blow houses in.

==Background==
===Personality===
Big Bad Wolf believes that being bad is what wolves are supposed to do. He likes to disguise himself - sometimes in drag - to fool the Three Little Pigs and try to catch them and eat them, or sometimes just get them into trouble. He usually goes after Fiddler and Fifer Pig first, as they are foolish therefore easier to capture.

In two animated appearances, Big Bad has three sons who are just as bad as he is. They are triplets who dress almost identically to him. They pay no mind to their father's orders and are just as eager to eat the pigs as he is.

However, it is now more consistent that he has one son called Li'l Wolf. Li'l Wolf wants to be a good wolf, and his father often scolds him for being friends with the Three Little Pigs. However, it has been shown that Big Bad is not a bad father. He adores his son and has on occasion passed up the possibility of pork chops for the safety of his son.

===Physical appearance===
Big Bad Wolf is tall and slender with black fur, cream muzzle, and usually wears red pants held up by green suspenders with a yellow patch on his left knee, a blue top hat, and white opera gloves.

==Appearances==
===''[[Silly Symphonies]]''===
[[File:Big-Bad-Wolf-2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Big Bad Wolf at the door of the stick house.]]
In ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'', Big Bad Wolf is first seen stalking the three pigs as two ([[The Three Little Pigs (characters)|Fifer Pig and]] [[The Three Little Pigs (characters)|Fiddler Pig]]) were playing their flute and fiddle and [[The Three Little Pigs (characters)|Practical Pig]] was finishing up his house of bricks. Big Bad tried to eat the two pigs, but they hid in the house of Practical. While blowing his pants off, the Wolf climbs naked in the chimney, falls into it and burns his butt.

In ''[[Old King Cole]]'', disguised as [[Grandma]], he made a cameo appearance alongside the citizens of Storyland who attended a jazz party thrown by Old King Cole.

In the wolf's second appearance, ''[[The Big Bad Wolf]]'', he attempts to eat [[Little Red Riding Hood]].

In ''[[Three Little Wolves]]'', the Wolf is giving his three mischievous sons a lesson on the best parts of a pig to eat. Meanwhile, Practical Pig is building a Wolf Pacifier (patent not applied for), while Fifer and Fiddler Pig trick him by crying "Wolf" with the Wolf Alarm. Meanwhile, the Wolf dresses up as Bo Peep and tricks Fifer and Fiddler Pig into following his sons, who are dressed up as the lost sheep, and captures them. When they blow the Wolf Alarm, Practical Pig passes it off as another trick. Fifer and Fiddler trick the Wolf into blowing it, which finally summons Practical, who brings along his Wolf Pacifier. He tricks the Wolf into running into the Wolf Pacifier, which beats the Wolf, then tars and feathers him, and finally fires him out of a cannon, while his sons rush to catch him.

[[File:Bigbadpractical.png|thumb|left|250px|The Big Bad Wolf in ''The Practical Pig''.]]
In ''[[The Practical Pig]]'', the Wolf dresses up as a mermaid to trick Fiddler and Fifer when they go swimming and captures them. He brings them back to his home, where his three sons eagerly await dinner. He tells his sons that they don't eat until they have Practical Pig too, and goes out to capture Practical Pig. While he's out, the Three Little Wolves prepare to eat Fifer and Fiddler, who are shocked that they don't obey their father.

Big Bad Wolf dresses up as a messenger and delivers a badly written note to Practical Pig. He is captured and put in the lie detector, which scrubs his mouth with soap, spanks him, and beats him on the head when he lies. Back at the mill, Fifer and Fiddler escape when the Three Little Wolves use pepper that causes them to sneeze and run home. The Big Bad Wolf finally tells the truth and is dispatched with a rocket.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
{{Quote|Roll it, Big Bad!|Jafar}}
[[File:Bigbadwolfdaddy.png|thumb|left|250px|Big Bad Wolf Daddy in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Big Bad Wolf made several appearances in the series ''House of Mouse''. His most prominent role was in the show's [[Big Bad Wolf Daddy|second episode]], where he appeared as a popular jazz singer known as '''Big Bad Wolf Daddy''' (a parody of {{WikipediaLink|Big Bad Voodoo Daddy}}), with the Pigs providing music for him (he had them under a contract that says he will not eat them as long as they play for him). [[The Bimbettes]] apparently also seemed to like him, as they sang along to [[Big Bad Wolf Daddy (song)|his song]], to [[Gaston]]'s annoyance. It was revealed in the episode that the wolf's "huff and puff" reactions are activated by the sight of doors and not the three pigs. His "huff and puff" would end up blowing up the House of Mouse (just like the last time he was there, according to Mickey).

In later episodes of ''House of Mouse'', the Wolf returned to his more traditional appearance, with no more mention of his role as Big Bad Wolf Daddy. In the episode "[[Pete's House of Villains]]"; he replaced Horace in the control room. In the episode "[[House of Turkey]]", the Wolf decided to leave the pigs alone for the day as he'd rather have turkey. In the episode "[[Dining Goofy]]", he was unamused with the fact that he was seated with [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]].

The Wolf also starred in a cartoon short made for ''House of Mouse'', based on his escapades in the comics. The Wolf also had cameos in the show's compilation films, ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', where he joined the legion of villains, and when [[Jafar]] had him activate the machine thus staging the film's final act, he complied. He also appeared in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
{{Main|Little Red Riding Hood}}
In the [[ABC]] fantasy drama, the Big Bad Wolf is actually a werewolf whose human form is none other than [[Little Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood]]. Her [[Grandma|grandmother]] purchased a red hood from a wizard to stop her from transforming when there was a full moon.

===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===
Big Bad Wolf cameos in the episode "[[Sock Burglar]]" as one of the suspects interrogated by [[Minnie Mouse]], here having a ravenous, hungry look during the interrogation.

The Big Bad Wolf later appeared in "[[The Perfect Dream]]", as an obnoxious biker that disturbs Mickey's dream with the noise made by his ride. In the end, Mickey turns the noise of Wolf's bike (as well as the other noises that annoy him) as music, to finish his dream.

===''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]''===
[[File:Wonderful-World-of-Mickey-Mouse4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Big Bad Wolf in ''The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse''.]]
The Big Bad Wolf makes an appearance in the episode "[[The Big Good Wolf (The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse)|The Big Good Wolf]]", in which he moves into Mickey and Minnie's neighborhood and causes havoc. Mickey offers to reform the wolf by taking him across town to help others. The wolf agrees, but secretly uses it as an opportunity to eat everyone in town, including the Three Little Pigs, Minnie, [[Goofy]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], [[Pluto]], [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], [[Timothy Q. Mouse]], [[Clarabelle Cow]], and [[Horace Horsecollar]], among other residents. The wolf lastly invites Mickey to dinner as a cover up to devour the mouse, but Mickey learns of the wolf's schemes and frees the townsfolk. The wolf tries to exact vengeance by huffing and puffing Mickey into a fire to be roasted, but Mickey uses pepper to retract the wolf's huffs and puffs, causing the wolf to sneeze himself into the sun. Though Mickey laments his failure to reform the Big Bad Wolf, he and the other residents celebrate the wolf's "change-of-address".

===Other appearances===
[[File:Tumblr n23n1vERQI1r3jmn6o5 1280.png|thumb|250px|The Big Bad Wolf's appearance in ''Mickey's Polo Team''.]]
The Big Bad Wolf appears in ''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]'', as one of the members of the Mickey Mousers. The crowd boos him when he first appears. At one point during the match, the Wolf's mallet breaks, so he tries hitting the ball by blowing on it with his windy breath. When the Three Little Pigs and Shirley Temple all razz him for his efforts, the Wolf retaliates by simply blowing them over.

The Wolf and pigs also make cameo appearances in ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]'', as some of the many spectators in the boxing match. The Wolf, along with several other characters, is seen taking a fancy to [[Jenny Wren]] when she appears.

[[File:Bigbadmickeymarch.png|thumb|left|250px|The Big Bad Wolf being dragged by the Three Little Pigs in the opening of ''The Mickey Mouse Club''.]]
Big Bad and the pigs make appearances in the animated opening of the television series ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. During the theme, he is tied up and being dragged by the pigs. At the end of the theme, he, along with the pigs, are among the crowd of Disney characters cheerfully tossing [[Mickey Mouse]] into the air.

He makes two cameos in the film in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', first, at Toontown, and second in the final scene of the film with several other toons, during the latter toons are talking about what [[Judge Doom]] really was and as the toons say what they are, he claims to be a sheep. He is voiced by [[Tony Pope]] here.

In ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', the Wolf made a cameo as a street corner Santa Claus at the beginning of the film saying "Merry Christmas!" to the people who pass by him.

He also starred in the ''[[Raw Toonage]]'' short "[[The Porker's Court]]".

Big Bad Wolf makes a cameo in two ''[[Bonkers]]'' episodes, "[[The 29th Page]]" at a prison line-up, and in "[[CasaBonkers]]" where Katya tosses the Wolf out of his car, so she can go after Bonkers.

==Printed media==
===Comics===
[[File:ZekeWolf2.jpg|thumb|250px|Big Bad Wolf with his son Li'l Wolf.]]
Big Bad Wolf continued to antagonize the Three Little Pigs in the pages of the Disney comic books, eventually stealing the spotlight and having the stories focus on him. ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #52 introduced his oddly-named son, [[Li'l Bad Wolf]], who, unlike the Three Little Wolves from the shorts, is kind and friendly to everyone, much to Big Bad Wolf's dismay. Carl Buettner, Gil Turner, and [[Jack Bradbury]] all worked on Wolf's early comic stories, with Buettner giving the Wolf his proper name of '''Zeke''' in [[1946]] and Turner supplying his middle name of '''Midas''' [[1949]].

After the release of ''[[Song of the South]]'', a recurring joke in the comics was that Zeke would often accidentally incur the wrath of [[Br'er Bear]], resulting in the big bruin angrily chasing after him. He also made appearances in three issues of the Junior Woodchucks comics in the 1970s alongside with either the pigs or the Br'er characters.

==Video games==
===''[[Magical Tetris Challenge]]''===
Big Bad Wolf appears as [[Pete]]'s second-in-command in the video game ''[[Magical Tetris Challenge]]''. In the game's Story Mode, the player always goes up against the Wolf before facing off with Pete.
