'''Brett Eze''' is a supporting character from the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Big City Greens]]''. He is the neighbor of [[Cricket Green]] who lives next door in an apartment building overlooking his house.
==Background==
===Personality===
Brett seems to be a rather laid back person. He does not seem to mind the frantic nature of the Greens and their antics. As a matter of fact, he seems to be all together supportive of whatever endeavor they have. He is a very sociable person as in "[[Blood Moon]]", he threw a Halloween party at his apartment. He was delighted to see that the Greens had shown up, implying that he may have intended for them to appear.
===Appearance===
Brett is a large obese man with green skin. His hair is depicted as short soft dreadlocks that stick up and a beard. He has earrings, and a plain brownish white shirt. He wears a brown, orange and red man skirt, possibly a sarong, and sandals. On his left hand he has a small string bracelet.
==Trivia==
*As evidenced by the concept art, Brett was initially going to be yellow, and arguably Caucasian. In the test pilot, he was purple and was going to be named Mark.
* While the two have not shown any interaction yet, Brett might be friends with [[Gloria (Big City Greens)|Gloria]] based on the fact that she knew where his party was.
* He bears a slight resemblance to [[Wasabi]] from ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.
* A line was cut from an episode revealing that his dogs were named Chunks and Chunks Jr.
*In "[[Critterball Crisis]]", a small stream of smoke is seen coming out of Brett's window as he watches the kids play. Based on his personality, it is possible that this is meant to imply that he is a pot head, in other words, someone who smokes marijuana.
*Colton Dunn had previously played another [[W:c:parksandrecreation:Brett Hull|Brett]] on ''[[W:c:parksandrecreation:Parks and Recreation|Parks and Recreation]]''.
*In "[[DependaBill]]", Brett reveals that he wears sandals because he kept losing socks at the laundromat.
