'''Madame Placebo''' is a one-shot character who appears in ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. Her only appearance is in the episode "[[Tummi Trouble]]".

A Lotion and Potion Gypsy by trade traveling through [[Drekmore Castle|Drekmore]], she is responsible for giving [[Duke Igthorn|Igthorn]] a love potion, to be used on [[Lady Bane]].

After the scheme goes awry, and Bane accidentally falls in love with [[Toadwart]], while [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] falls in love with Bane, Igthorn catches up with Madame Placebo around [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]] forest, in order to find out how to break the spell again.

==Trivia==
*Madame Placebo's design, specifically her facial features like her nose, mouth, chin and hair color, mirror Duke Igthorn's design.
