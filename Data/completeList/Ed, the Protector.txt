'''Ed '''is a genetically engineered teen in a blue costume, made from the instructions of an ancient alien artifact found by Ol' Skool. He is the titular character of the show [[Get Ed|''Get Ed'']]''.''

Ed is the newest and youngest member of the Dojo Team.

As Ed tries to uncover his origins, he also works on the Dojo crew as a delivery boy. On top of delivering packages and figuring out his identity, Ed's side job is fighting evil. He has many equipment that he finds along his journey whose technology is far beyond technology of Progress City, thought to be gifts from aliens for his use. He rides a hoverboard co-piloted by Torch, an AI represented as a little floating fireball hologram with a face. Ed can be a little dense and gullible sometimes, but sometimes he gets flashes of future events that help him and his friends. If it wasn't for his friends, Ed could have accidentally destroyed the world. Ed has a crush on [[Deets, the Dreamer|Deets]], and the feeling appears to be mutual.
