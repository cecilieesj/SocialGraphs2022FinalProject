He later appears for the closing number of "[[Choose Before You Chew]]".

== Trivia ==
* While Peter Gabriel was willing to record his own voice for the attraction, hearing Jess Harnell's demo tracks impressed him enough to convince him that it wasn't necessary, a sentiment also shared by [[Sting]] when hearing Harnell's impression of him for [[The Refrigerator Police]].<ref>https://twitter.com/TammyTuckey/status/1287487601323147264</ref>
* Pita Gabriel was one of several Food Rocks animatronics to have their remains sold at auction after the attraction's closure, with only his head remaining as of a 2017 Van Eaton Galleries auction.
