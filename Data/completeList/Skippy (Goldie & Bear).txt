'''Skippy''' is a minor character featured in the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. He is a baby [[Dragons|dragon]] that lives on top a giant mountain. He was a pet to [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]] for a short time. Bear got along with him, but when [[Goldie (Goldie & Bear)|Goldie]] brings back a way to take back Skippy, Bear attempted to sabotage his rescue ride. Once he met [[Skippy's Mom|his mother]], he finally realized that he had to let him go. Before he left with his mother, both of them took both Goldie and Bear down the mountain to home.

==Abilities==
Skippy can breathe fire and when he eats apples, he shoots out fireballs. He can fly with his small wings and quite agile for his size. Despite being a dragon, Skippy's behavior and mannerisms are generally more like those of a small puppy dog. His mother sometimes lets him come down to [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]] to let him play with Goldie and Bear. Bear begins to teach him dog tricks, such as "roll over" and "fetch." [[Big Bad]], sensing an opportunity, uses Skippy for a time to fetch items for him, such as [[Red (Goldie and Bear)|Red]]'s muffins, before being caught by the others. And he licks and slobbers Goldie cheek
