'''Karen Beverly''' is a character who appears in the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.

==Background==
Karen Beverly is an extremely detailed plastic toy knife, unlike Forky, despite being a hand-crafted kindergarten toy.

==Role in the film==
Karen Beverly's only appearance was during a mid-credits scene where [[Jessie]] tells Bonnie's toys that Bonnie made a new friend in class. Showing the toys Karen Beverly, the other toys become shocked upon looking at [[Forky]] looking at her. Forky introduces himself to the new toy Bonnie made, just as Karen Beverly doesn't realize herself of how she was alive to which Forky replies, "I don't know."

==Trivia==
*According to the audio commentary, her name was confirmed by [[Josh Cooley]] and Mark Nielsen during the credits. Josh suggested using the name "Karen", named after Mark Nielsen's sister, followed by "Beverly", also Mark's sister, which is used as a suggestion for the character name.<ref>"I think Forky and Karen Beverly have a bright future together." ~ Mark Nielsen</ref>
**The name "Knifey" is colloquially used as an in-joke of many characters in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]] whose names end with a long "E" sound.
