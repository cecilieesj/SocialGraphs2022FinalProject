==Appearances==
===[[The Reluctant Dragon]]===
Sir Giles is first seen entering the town, announcing that he will vanquish the [[The Reluctant Dragon (character)|dragon]]; much to the <span style="line-height:1.5em;">[[Boy (The Reluctant Dragon)|boy]]'s</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> dismay since he found out earlier that the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is actually a very nice dragon who is mostly interested in poetry.</span>

Next, he is seen bathing in his room at the inn as the boy<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> enters to speak to him about the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">; despite the fact that Sir Giles had previously told the innkeeper to not let anyone disturb him. Initially, Sir Giles believes that the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> must have caused the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> some kind of misery and woe and begins to make various guesses as to what it is, from </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">devouring the boy's</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> flocks to making off with his parents, to kidnapping some fair damsel with flaxen hair, ruby lips, and form divine. The boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> simply states that the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> won't fight, to which Sir Giles says "Preposterous! the fellow must be an infernal cad. Bit of a rotter, what?". The boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> then explains that the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> actually a nice old dragon who likes to write poetry; much to Sir Giles' joy, as he's a bit of a bard himself. He then starts reciting a poem called "Ode to a Fleecy Cloud"; which causes the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> to realize that he is much the opposite of the way knights are portrayed in his storybook. Nevertheless, Sir Giles agrees to go with the boy to talk to the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> about the fight.</span>

The boy<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> and Sir Giles find the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">having a picnic, which he invites them to join. When the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> introduces Sir Giles as the dragon killer, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is so shocked that he angrily picks up all the picnic items and puts them back in his basket. However, when Sir Giles tells him that the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> told him that he is an accomplished poet, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is flattered and quickly hands back all of the picnic food. Sir Giles then asks the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> to recite a poem, to which he relates "To an upside-down cake" which Sir Giles likes very much. Sir Giles then recites his own poem entitled "Radish so red", which the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> finds delightful.</span>

However, this whole time. the boy<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> has been wanting Sir Giles to tell the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> about the fight,</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> so he proceeds to do so with his own poem. The dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is shocked and refuses to fight since there's nothing to fight and he doesn't believe in it. Although both Sir Giles and the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> tell him that the whole village is expecting a fight and that they will be severely disappointed if there isn't one, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> still refuses and </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">goes into his cave home, bidding them goodnight.</span>

Then, Sir Giles comes up with an idea: he will fake the fight so that neither he nor the dragon<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> will get hurt. After consulting the boy's</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> book and seeing that there's nothing against it, the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">and the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> both agree to his plan.</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> However, at the last minute, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> remembers that he can't breathe fire and </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">tries to change his friends' minds, but the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> and Sir Giles have already left.</span>

That following morning as the villagers gathered outside the dragon's cave<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> to watch the fight, Sir Giles rides in on horseback, clad in armor, ready for the fight. Inside the cave, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> and the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> are both very distressed because the fight can't take place as</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> no matter how hard he tries, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> can't get himself to </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">breathe fire. However, when the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> states that he wishes that the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> was a real dragon instead of a</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> "punk poet," the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> gets</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> angry and finally starts to breathe fire. Delighted, the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> asks</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> the boy</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> to call him a "punk poet" multiple times so that he can get madder and his fire can get bigger.</span>

The "fight" begins with Sir Giles <span style="line-height:1.5em;">charging at the dragon, who manages to hide in a cloud of smoke he created</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">. Sir Giles then chases the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> into his cave, where they proceed to fan the smoke from a fire out the entrance and shout things like "Take that!" and "Help!", all while having some tea; much to Sir Giles' horse's dismay.</span>

A little later, the two resume the "fight" outside, where they proceed to charge at each other again. After the collision, <span style="line-height:1.5em;">another cloud of smoke is created, in which the dragon and Sir Giles dance while shouting the same things over again; much to the horse's dismay again. Then, they both decide it is time for the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> to "die", so they end their fake fight with the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> pretending he has been stabbed by Sir Giles' spear. After that, Sir Giles "reforms the ferocious dragon" and the dragon</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is finally welcomed into society.</span>

===[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]===
He appears in ToonTown chasing the Dragon on his horse after Eddie crashes his car. Sir Giles, his horse, and the dragon<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> join the rest of the toons as Roger Rabbit reads Marvin Acme's will and rejoices knowing Marvin kept his word and left ToonTown to the Toons. He then heads back home to ToonTown knowing it will be safe from future harm, singing "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!" with the other toons.</span>

===[[House of Mouse]]===
Sir Giles makes many cameos in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', usually seen sitting with the Dragon. He appears multiple times in the shows intro clapping with the other toons as the show is about to start.
