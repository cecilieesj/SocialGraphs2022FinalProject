==Background==
Kimyo and Nabasu are shown to be playful and friendly. Despite their fear of predators, they are amiable and playful towards [[Anga]].

==Role in the series==
===''[[The Accidental Avalanche]]''===

Kimyo and Nabasu are first seen bathing in a hot spring with their family when Makini is devising a plan to ask the snow monkeys to know a shortcut to the Tree of Life. When Anga plans to ask them, the snow monkey family notices Anga approaching due to their sensitivity to large birds. Kimyo, Nabasu, and their family throw snowballs at Anga, thinking she is a threat; Anga yells at the snow monkeys to stop, but they refuse to as she retreats.

The snow monkey family notices Kion doing a disadvantageous plan to go through the mountain, caused by the venom affecting his temper, just as the snow monkeys run in terror just as the Guard rescues them from the avalanche caused by Kion (the hot springs the snow monkeys were bathing at is also covered during the avalanche). Kion then tells the frightened snow monkeys about Anga being gentle to them to which they agree to calm down. Kion then apologized to the snow monkey family for causing the avalanche across the snowy mountain to which the monkeys accept Kion's apology as there are other hot springs across the snowy mountain area to which Kimyo and Nabasu's mother Yuki tells the Guard to find another hot spring safe for the snow monkeys to which the Guard agrees to help the snow monkeys find a new home without trees.

Just as the snow monkeys follow Anga to a new hot springs their leader Yuki requested, they end up bathing at the new hot springs bigger than their old one. Just as Kimyo, Nabasu, and their family witness flying squirrels bothering the snow monkeys, Bunga tells one of them named "Tafu" to stop bothering the snow monkeys to which Tafu agrees. However, the Guard only notices the snow monkeys have left due to them in fright.

Anga then sees the snow monkey family in fright as they all fall deeper in the snow. Bunga then accidentally falls into the snow where the snow monkeys fell at just as Fuli asks Anga to lift them out of the hole to which Anga refuses at first. Just as Anga plans to tell the snow monkeys not to panic while she rescues them and Bunga, the snow monkey family accepts Anga's trust that she will rescue them. Anga, however, manages to rescue the snow monkeys from the hole just as Yuki praises her for her help. Just as Anga agrees to find a new home for the snow monkeys, Kion's team ends up having fun with the snow monkeys in their new home. During the moment before leaving to continue their journey to the Tree of Life, Kimyo and Nabasu tell Anga to join in the fun and have a bath with the snow monkeys.
