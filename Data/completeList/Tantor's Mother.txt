==''Tarzan''==
In the film, Tantor's mother is first seen talking to a pair of bull elephants while Tantor asks his motherÂ if the water is sanitary, because it looks questionable to him, to which his mother replies that the water is fine. Tantor then spots [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and takes him for a piranha, and tells her about this, and she doesn't believe him until Tarzan grabs one of the bull elephant's tails, causing a stampede, almost killing a family member of the apes in the process and leading [[Kerchak]] to scold Tarzan for nearly killing someone and himself. She is seen for the last time during the song "[[Son of Man]]".
