The '''Alligator''' is a character featured in the [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]] attraction at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]. It is seen in one of the four portraits in the Stretching Room area in the aforementioned attraction.

==History==

===Background===
The alligator, as its name implies, is an {{WikipediaLink|American alligator}} (''Alligator missisipensis'') seen in one of the four stretching portraits depicting the [[Sally Slater|Tightrope Walker]] with an alligator below her whose jaws are wide open attempting to devour her.

Prior to her death, the Tightrope Walker performed on a faulty rope during one show which suddenly snapped, causing her to fall into the water where the alligator is at, resulting the Tightrope Walker falling into the water and then being eaten and killed by the alligator; thus a portrait of Sally Slater with a hungry alligator below her is displayed in the Stretching Room area at the attraction.

==Appearances==
===[[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|The Haunted Mansion]]===
In the Stretching Room scene, one of the four stretching portraits depicts the portrait of Sally Slater standing on a tightrope with an image of an alligator attempting to eat her while narration from the [[Ghost Host]] is heard in the background giving guests a challenge of how to escape the Haunted Mansion; all of a sudden, a loud thunderclap is heard in the stretching room and after the sequence, guests exit the area and then proceed to the attraction's Doom Buggies.

Due to the success of the Haunted Mansion attraction at [[Disneyland]], the Haunted Mansion attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Liberty Square]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] at [[Fantasyland (Tokyo Disneyland)|Fantasyland]], still featuring the Stretching Room scene that depicts the painting of Sally Slater with the alligator below her.

In the Magic Kingdom version of the queue, one of the several poems read by the ghost of [[Prudence Pock]] reads, "In the swamp, poor Sally Slater was eaten by an alligator", in reference to the alligator that devoured the Tightrope Walker in one of the four stretching portraits in the attraction itself.

===Other appearances===

====[[Virtual Safari]]====
One of the two visible portraits in the Stretching Room scene in [[The Lion King 1½ (video)|Disc 2]] (specifically the [[2004]] DVD release) of ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' DVD in the "Virtual Safari" DVD game depicts a parody of the portrait of Sally Slater and the alligator, albeit with [[Timon]] taking place of the former and a [[Crocodiles (The Lion King)|crocodile]] taking place of the latter. Additionally, a few [[The Hyena Clan|hyenas]] can be seen in the same portrait.

====''[[The Haunted Mansion (comic book)|The Haunted Mansion]]''====
Several alligators appear in the first line of the ''Haunted Mansion'' comics, which are potentially the ones responsible for the death of the Tightrope Walker where it is elaborated that the latter was a witch named "Daisy de la Cruz" who was the one who transformed men into alligators with a widower named "Papa de Janeiro" whom she adds to the collection. The Tightrope Walker then kept these reptiles on the swamp and walked over the water where the tightrope is at until she fell to her death at the alligators.

====''[[Disney Crossy Road]]''====
When the player plays as Sally Slater in the discontinued ''Disney Crossy Road'' game in the ''Haunted Mansion'' hub, alligators appear on certain parts during gameplay. However, they only serve as harmless obstacles blocking parts of the scenery; the player cannot directly jump into any alligator, and thus cannot cause an instant game over to the Tightrope Walker.

==Trivia==
*The fact that the Haunted Mansion attraction was constructed at the [[New Orleans Square]] area at [[Disneyland]] with an image of an alligator in one of the portraits of the aforementioned attraction and New Orleans Square having a New Orleans theme is a possible reference to alligators commonly being found in the state of [[Louisiana]] where New Orleans is at.
*While not physically seen in the pre-[[2019]] revamp of [[Phantom Manor]], the alligator was homaged in one of the portraits of [[Melanie Ravenswood]], but depicts a river monster instead of an actual alligator.
