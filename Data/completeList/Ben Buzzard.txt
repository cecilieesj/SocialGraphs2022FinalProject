'''Ben Buzzard''' is a shady, used-airplane dealer and antagonist from the [[Donald Duck]] cartoon short ''[[The Flying Jalopy]]''. He also makes a cameo appearance during the finale of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

==Trivia==
*Ben Buzzard's appearance is similar to [[w:c:woodywoodpecker:Buzz Buzzard|Buzz Buzzard]] from the ''[[wikipedia:Woody Woodpecker (1941 film)|Woody Woodpecker]]'' cartoon series. Both Ben and Buzz also are similar in motives as they have both tricked their intended victims (Woody in Buzz's debut cartoon "Wet Blanket Policy") into signing an insurance policy before trying (and failing) to kill them in order to collect on the policy money. However, Buzz wouldn't appear until 1948 in his aforementioned debut cartoon, five years after Ben in this 1943 Donald Duck short.
