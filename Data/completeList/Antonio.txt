'''Antonio''' (originally known as '''Tony''') is a minor character in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'', appearing exclusively in the episode "[[Lip Synchin' in the Rain]]".

==History==
For the school play, ''[[High School Musical]]'' he auditioned for the part of [[Ryan Evans]]. He tried to make sure he got the part by researching Mr. Blaine's failed musical ''Floss'' and using it as his audition piece, it worked as he got the part. He was very arrogant in thinking the show revolved around him, he brought in some talent scouts to watch his performance. In the end, the curtain fell onto him (thanks to Zack and Cody) and he left the stage. Later, he came back and almost ruined it for Maddie, and in the end, he, along with Mr. Blaine, Maddie, London, Cody and Zack, danced to the song '''Floss'''.
