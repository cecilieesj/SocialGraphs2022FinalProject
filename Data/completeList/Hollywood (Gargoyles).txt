==Role in the series==
[[Thailog]] and [[Demona]] commissioned [[Anton Sevarius|Dr. Anton Sevarius]] to create Hollywood as a part of their clone clan. Sevarius and Thailog aged Hollywood to his peak physical age, leaving him radically discolored. Demona named him, and Thailog programmed him simply to "obey Thailog." Like the rest of the clones, Hollywood was sent against the [[Manhattan Clan]], but he was defeated. Talon adopted the clones, and planned to teach them to think for themselves and "to use verbs."

When Thailog stormed the Labyrinth, Hollywood quickly succumbed to his will. He and his clan-mates held [[Claw]] at bay, then departed to [[Castle Wyvern]] to reclaim [[Delilah]]. At the castle, Hollywood battled the Manhattan clan until Delilah proposed that each cloned gargoyle decide for itself whether to reaffirm its allegiance to the [[Labyrinth Clan]] or to return to Thailog's control. Hollywood decided to fight no longer, and decided to return to the Labyrinth.

==Trivia==
*In the non-canonical ''Goliath Chronicles'', Hollywood contracted a degenerative virus that was supposedly the result of a flaw in the cloning process. The Manhattan Clan brought the Clone Clan to Dr. Sevarius for help, but he tricked them into chasing after an escaping Thailog, and, while doing so, Hollywood petrified. His statue was placed atop a building, awaiting the time when a cure for their condition can be found.
*Hollywood is named after the famous [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood district of Los Angeles, California], regarded as the center of the film industry. This is a strange coincidence, as Broadway is named after Broadway Avenue in New York City, famous for being a center of American theatre.
*Hollywood was, of course, named by Demona after the famous motion picture headquarters in Los Angeles in part to contrast with Broadway's name, but also for Demona to make fun of the, in her opinion, ridiculous name choice of Broadway's.
