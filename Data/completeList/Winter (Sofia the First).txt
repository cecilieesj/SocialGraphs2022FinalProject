==Role in the Series==
Winter first appears playing a beautiful song on her pan pipes after Sofia, Clover, and Whiskers enter the Icicle Forest. After introductions are made and they see her freeze an entire tree with a single touch, she explains how she became able to do so: One year before, she had traded all her wood crystals to [[Glacia the Ice Witch]], who does spells for people every Wassailia, for this ability because she had heard of Queen Elsa and the Snow Queen's cryokinetic abilities and wanted a cryokinetic ability of her own: The Ice Touch. She enjoyed the power until she accidentally froze her bird Feathers by mistake. She is now looking for ice lilies to give to Glacia to take it away. Sofia reveals she looking for ice lilies too and offers to help her convince Glacia to remove her Ice Touch.

After coming to a pond and freezing it, they cross it and get the ice lilies. However, Clover gets frozen by her ice touch in the process, to Winter's horror. They head to Glacia's palace and gives her the ice lilies. However, Glacia refuses to remove the ice touch because she already has hundreds of ice lilies which make Winter runoff in despair.

Sofia comes by and tells her to make one of her songs a gift for Glacia. They head back to Glacia's palace and Winter takes Sofia's tip. Glacia is so pleased that she takes away the ice touch and undoes all the freezings, to the joy of Winter who thanks, Sofia, and heads home, eager to hug her seven brothers, three sisters, and twenty-six cousins.

==Trivia==
*Winter's the second hybrid person to appear on the show. 
**The first was the merpeople of Merroway Cove.
*Winter's Ice Touch and her enjoyment of it coming to an end after she froze one of her friends by accident with it is similar to the story of King Midas's Golden Touch and how his enjoyment of it came to an end when he turned his daughter into solid gold with it by accident.
