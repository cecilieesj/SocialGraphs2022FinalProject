==Background==
Jonathan attended the secret super power school [[Sky High School]]. At Sky High, he attended the sidekick classes. Upon graduation, he was paired with [[The Commander]] and became his Hero Support. The Commander chose the name All American Boy for Jonathan. The Commander also chose All American Boy's Uniform and colors so it would match his own Uniform. All American Boy once saved The Commander's life. Probably soon after The Commander met and partnered with [[Jetstream]], All American Boy stopped being the Commander's sidekick.
===Powers and abilities===
All American Boy can leap across vast distances, as shown when he caught Jetstream when the latter was Pacified, before she could fall to her death, a fall which would have been fatal owing to the fact she was a baby.
==Appearances==
===''[[Sky High]]''===
Jonathan now works as Hero Support teacher at Sky High. Though he tries to appear chipper and tries to inspire his students he is quite clearly unhappy and living in past glory. At some point he made and gave scrapbooks for The Commander. He is saddened that [[Will Stronghold]] didn't know who he was even though he worked with his father. 

He still does a little freelance Hero Support on the side.

During Will and [[Warren Peace]]'s save the citizen battle with Lash and Speed, he and Professor Medulla comment on how they previously use live people in the battles in their day. They also come in on a strategy that Speed used against Peace, before noting on how it was effective.

At the end of the film Jonathan gets the recognition he yearn for when Commander praises him for teaching his students well after they defeat Royal Pain. Jonathan is also pleased when he gets a kiss on the cheek by Jetstream.
