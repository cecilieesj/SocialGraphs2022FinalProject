The '''Pamplona Bulls''' are characters featured in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode, "[[Al Rojo Vivo]]".

==Appearances==

===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===
A group of bulls is first seen running across the city of Pamplona while [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] are watching the moment, much to Mickey's frustration of [[Pete]] blocking the view in which as Mickey is launched into the area where the bulls are running at, he furiously confronts Pete to give his love interest a better view of the Running of the Bulls. However, one bull sees Mickey's red color and furiously approaches him just as the bull furiously chases him across the street to which Mickey hides behind a red car to lose the bull only for him to continue chasing Mickey across the streets, just as Mickey attempts to find many ways to avoid the bull. However, Mickey attempts to find a safe place to avoid being seen by the bull chasing him only to find numerous red colors around him just as the bulls arrive at the area where Mickey is at, leaving him confused and causing him to ignore Mickey because Mickey removed the red scarf from himself. Losing the bull, Mickey only finds out that he is hit by numerous townspeople throwing tomatoes at him representing the La Tomatina event. The bull suddenly returns and furiously chases Mickey across the streets just as Mickey escapes from him just as the bull finds himself in the area where the Running of the Bulls is taking place.

As the bull finds himself in red paint, he sees other bulls chasing the two across the streets and upon seeing Pete from a distance, Mickey halts the bull and cleans him up with a red cape, also causing the other bulls to react to the red cape just as Mickey throws it at Pete, causing the other bulls to rampage across the streets and charge into Pete. As the bulls dispatch Pete, Minnie kisses Mickey for saving her from Pete only for the bulls to notice Mickey's red shorts, much to Mickey's worry about the bulls reacting to the red color again.

===Other appearances===
In the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] attraction "[[Vacation Fun]]", archived footage from the ''Mickey Mouse'' episode "Al Rojo Vivo" was featured in the attraction, where it features the bull chasing Mickey Mouse across the streets of Pamplona, Spain, which is one of the places Mickey had adventures at after finding his passport.

==Trivia==
*Despite being a common gag in cartoons, bulls do not really get angry at the color red. Bulls (and cattle in general) are in fact colorblind and are actually charging at the waving of a bullfighter's cape, rather than the color itself.
