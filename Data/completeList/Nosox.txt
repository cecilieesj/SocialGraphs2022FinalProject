He is designed to steal, hide, or otherwise make socks mysteriously vanish. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]".

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Nosox is a quadrupedal, gray experiment shaped like a four-legged washing machine with a red button for a nose, two small ears, and small white eyes with black pupils, similar to [[Skip]].

===Powers and abilities===
Nosox can steal socks and make them disappear by storing them in a washing machine-like container in his stomach.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 204 was the 204th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to eat socks, and thus make them disappear. 204 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

204's pod was one of the twelve experiment pods recovered by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] in "[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]". His was one of the final four experiment pods (among [[Stopgo|102]], [[Experiments#2-Series: Technological and scientific|274]], and [[Drowsy|360]]) that [[Pleakley]], with some assistance from Stitch, cataloged after being convinced to do so by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]].

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 204, named Nosox, was presumably activated and captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], as he was mentioned in "[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]" when [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] said, "After you sent me a sock hider..."

Nosox appeared in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Nosox, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Nosox participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Nosox made an appearance in a later episode of the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Shrink]], [[Squeak]], [[Clip]], and [[Retro]].

==Trivia==
*Nosox is one of the rare experiments to have sclerae and pupils instead of solid black eyes, the others being [[Mr. Stenchy]], [[Mrs. Sickly]], [[Skip]], [[Clink]], and [[Bragg]]. 
*His name means "No Socks" (No Sox) because he is a sock hider.
*Nosox, along with [[Richter]], [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Splodyhead]], [[Gigi]], [[Experiments#2-Series: Technological and scientific|Butter]], [[Shortstuff]], [[Yang]], [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Phoon]], and one unconfirmed experiment, are the only known experiments that are primarily quadrupeds.
*Even though Nosox was mentioned twice in Season 1, he did not officially appear activated until near the end of Season 2.
**Nosox is the only experiment to be mentioned twice by function in two separate episodes without actually appearing activated. Ironically, we saw Nosox in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form in the [[Drowsy (episode)|last episode]] of Season 1 with one of these mentions, even though he was activated off-screen and captured by Gantu in an [[Amnesio (episode)|earlier episode]] of Season 1.
**This is similar to [[Fudgy]], though he did appear activated in Season 1, but not fully seen. Interestingly, both of them were rescued from Gantu in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]".
*Nosox is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*He is also one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*Nosox's pod color is blue in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.
