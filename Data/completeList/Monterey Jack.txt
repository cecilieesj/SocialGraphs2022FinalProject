'''Monterey Jack''' is one of the main characters in ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. Monty serves as the group's "muscle".

==Background==
Monterey Jack, known to friends as Monty, is the oldest of the [[Rescue Rangers]], as it is revealed early on that he was friends with [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]]'s father and knew Gadget as a child. He is an Australian mouse, and often uses pseudo-Australian phrases in his speech, such as "Stripe me starkers". Monty comes from a family of travelers and has spent most of his life traveling the world with his sidekick [[Zipper]]. He loves to tell stories about his travels, even when the others halt his reminiscing.

He is close friends with Zipper and with [[Chip and Dale|Dale]], who shares Monty's fun-loving nature, while he considers Gadget akin to a surrogate daughter, due to his friendship with her father. Despite his easy-going nature, he can be quick to anger, which can lead to Monty getting into fights with larger opponents. His bravado vanishes in the face of cats, of which he has an intense fear. At the end of "[[To the Rescue|To the Rescue, Part 5]]," after Gadget joins the Rescue Rangers, he becomes her guardian.

==Appearances==
===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===
Monty joins what comes to be known as the Rescue Rangers after his home is destroyed by [[Fat Cat]]. This event gives Monty a grudge against the villainous feline that is rarely brought up in later episodes. He is responsible for leading [[Chip and Dale]] to Gadget, though he actually intended to meet with her father to obtain transportation.

After [[Fat Cat]] is brought to justice, he remains with the squad, serving as the muscle of the group. Being the most traveled of the bunch, he is often responsible for the group's travel arrangements when going long distances. Though a devoted member, he could easily be distracted by his addiction to cheese; upon smelling cheese he goes into a trance-like state known as a "cheese-attack".

Two episodes, "[[Parental Discretion Retired]]" and "[[A Lean on the Property]]" introduce Monty's parents, [[Cheddarhead Charlie and Camembert Kate]], respectively. While Monty is shown to idolize his father, his relationship with his mother is more strained as she is prone to smothering him.

===[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'' (film)]]===
After the end of the ''Rescue Rangers'' series, Monty fell in with Sweet Pete's uncanny valley gang and got involved with mockbuster production in the underworld. However, his love of cheese eventually lead to him racking up a debt, which would be paid by him being turned into a bootleg of another toon. He attempted to have Chip and Dale look into this, but Chip still held a grudge against Dale, and Monty ended up kidnapped and operated to become a Dumbo bootleg. The other Rescue Rangers eventually rescued him and took down the gang, and the reunited group began making the best of their newfound stardom.

Monty was the only Rescue Ranger not to be voiced (temporarily or not) by his original actors. Instead, he was played by newcomer and Disney veteran Eric Bana, who like Monty (but unlike Peter Cullen and Jim Cummings, who are North American) hails from Australia.

==Trivia==
*Monty and his relatives are all named after types of cheese.
*In the episode "[[Shell Shocked]]", when a group of hermit crabs reveals that their shells have been taken (essentially, their homes), Chip makes this comment directed to Monty: "How would you feel if you lost your home?" Monty actually did lose his home in "[[To the Rescue|To the Rescue, Part 2]]".
*Monty's voice can be heard in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode "[[Twitching Channels]]".
