'''Herr Rhino''' (or '''Mr. Rhino''') is a male rhinoceros with a "mustard-thick German accent". He is an inhabitant of the [[Pride Lands]] and a deleted character.

==Appearance==
He is large and gray, as he is initially mistaken as a rock by [[Banagi]]. Herr Rhino also has a needle-sharp horn.

==Personality==
Herr Rhino is an easily ticked off rhino, but does have a sense of justice about him.

==Information==
[[File:Readyforbattleherrsimbakwashi.png|thumb|left|Herr Rhino, Kwashi, and Simba march back to the Pride Lands.]]
In J.T. Allen's early script for ''[[The Lion King]]'', after Banagai, [[Baasho]], and [[Scar]] murder [[Mufasa]], Baasho pursue [[Simba]] as he flees from his homeland. Simba runs into what he mistakens to be a rock, but finds out to be a rhino. Simba asks help from the rhino, in which the rhino agrees. Herr Rhino charges at the hyenas creating a cloud of dust, but he makes Baasho go in Simba's direction.

Soon after Simba leaves [[Timon]] and Tesma's colony, Simba asks Herr Rhino to help assist him along with [[Kwashi]] and [[Zazu]] in taking back the [[Pride Lands]]. The rhino agrees, and Simba orders him and Zazu to lie down among some rhino bolders. Zazu whispers into Simba's ear telling him the rhino is not so swift, but Simba instructs him that he will be swift when the time comes. After Simba's fight with Scar ends with his opponent crushed by a tree branch, Herr Rhino and Zazu stand next to Simba, and the new king congratulates their work.

==Trivia==
* ''Herr'' means ''Mister'' or ''Mr.'' in English.
