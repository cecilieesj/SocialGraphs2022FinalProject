The '''Python''' is a character that was featured in the [[Jungle Cruise]] attraction at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
The python is a large constrictor snake as its name implies resembling an African rock python (''Python sebae''). It is shown to be hanging on a tree, presumably waiting for prey to strike.

===Development History===
Originally, the python was displayed outside the ruins of an ancient temple, but for later years, it was displayed into a section representing the Amazon as part of the attraction being refurbished.

Due to the success of the attractions at Disneyland, the Jungle Cruise attraction was later constructed in the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, still featuring the python in it albeit in a different section.

==Appearances==

===Attractions===
====[[Jungle Cruise]]====
In the Disneyland version of the attraction, the python was displayed in a section representing the Amazon river where it is displayed by some water buffalo presumably looking for a prey to strike to which the boats manage to get past the snake in time.

In the Florida version of the attraction, the python is seen in after the boat passes through the Boats & Baits area in the Amazon while in the Tokyo version, it is seen after passing by two crocodiles.

===Film===
====''[[Jungle Cruise (film)|Jungle Cruise]]''====
A boa constrictor taking the same role of the python also appears in the film based on the Disney Parks of the same name where it is seen staring at the ''La Quila'' on its way to the [[Tears of the Moon]]. Additionally, several cursed snakes which appear on the film's main antagonist, [[Lope de Aguirre]], where the undead conquistador himself was bound with snakes all over him were also inspired by the python in the attraction.

===Other appearances===
====[[Virtual Safari]]====
The snake depicted in the Virtual Safari bonus feature included in Disc 2 of ''[[The Lion King]] Special Edition'' is seen doing a pose similar to the one as the python in the Jungle Cruise attraction at the Disney Parks. In the tour, the boat comes across the snake hanging on a tree after [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] pass through [[Pride Rock]] at night (if the right path is chosen) or a tropical storm area (if the left path is chosen). Pumbaa asks Timon if snakes are part of the river, Timon explains that snakes don't swim to which Pumbaa explains to him that snakes can climb just as the snake ferociously lunges at them, causing the meerkat/warthog duo to react in fear just as the two manage to escape from the snake.
