==Personality==

==Biography==
Werner von Strucker was the son of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. Six months after his father’s death, he was persuaded by Grant Ward to join HYDRA and help him rebuild the organization. When he failed to kill Andrew Garner, he abandoned Ward and went to seek help from his father's old HYDRA ally, [[Gideon Malick]]. However, he was betrayed by Malick and tortured by Ward’s minions and fell into a coma.

Months later, von Strucker has been coping with his enhanced powers to recall specific memories. He was tortured by S.H.I.E.L.D. into revealing information on where to find Gideon Malick. He was later kept prisoner by General Hale at her secret base, where he befriended Ruby Hale. He assisted Ruby in her plan to become the new Destroyer of Worlds until being accidentally killed by her after she infused herself with 8 percent of the Gravitonium, due to being unable to control her powers.
