How Gorr became the God Butcher first started when his planet is dying from heat and has lack of food and water, and his daughter is dying. So, he prayed to their god, [[Rapu]], but his god rejected him, as he turned on his follower. Lurking in the shadow is the Necrosword. As he grabbed the sword, it cursed him.
