After Whitehall's death, he was kidnapped and brainwashed by [[Grant Ward]] and [[Agent 33]] into serving them. He was portrayed by Simon Kassianides.

==Background==
===Personality===
Sunil Bakshi was deeply loyal to his HYDRA superiors, particularly Daniel Whitehall. He was even willing to kill himself rather than reveal any information to S.H.I.E.L.D. Bakshi presented himself with a calm, confident, and sophisticated personality. Even while brainwashing prisoners he was able to keep his dignity and calamity.

After being brainwashed by Grant Ward and Agent 33, Bakshi's personality remained the same but he was now completely loyal to them.

===Abilities===
*'''Expert Combatant''': Bakshi had a great skill of hand-to-hand combat proficiency. He was taught by the British Armed Forces, which he demonstrated while fighting [[Phil Coulson]].

==Biography==
Sunil Bakshi joined HYDRA, where he became the right-hand man of Daniel Whitehall. He served under the leadership of Whitehall during his campaign to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. and retrieve the Obelisk. He was later captured and handed over to the United States Air Force before being freed by Grant Ward and Agent 33, who kidnapped and brainwashed him into serving them. While serving them, he went as an undercover HYDRA agent working with [[Doctor List]]. He was later killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jemma Simmons]], who had attempted to kill Ward.
