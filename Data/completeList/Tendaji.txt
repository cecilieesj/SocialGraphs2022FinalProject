'''Tendaji''' is a character from ''[[That's So Raven]]'', and makes his only appearance in the episode "[[Royal Treatment]]". He is the Prince of Shakobi, and comes to [[Bayside High School]] as an exchange student, where he encounters, [[Raven Baxter]], and becomes smitten with her. He is portrayed by Dempsey Pappion.

==History==
Prince Tendaji arrives at [[Bayside High School]], where he is made fun of, by the other students, due to his cultural garb. [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] witnesses this, and defends him. He thanks her, and she introduces him to her friends, [[Eddie Thomas|Eddie]] and [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]], and also invites Tendaji, to her [[Baxter House|house]]. Shakobian culture believes in marriage at first sight, and a proposal is conducted in three gits. Raven's kindness prompts Tendaji to gift her with the sacred feather, the first step in his proposal. Raven accepts this unaware of the symbolism it holds, and Tendaji calls his father to confirm the feather has been given.

Following school, the group revise together, and Tendaji tries a bingo bomb for the first time, much to his delight. Raven introduces her [[Tanya Baxter|mother]], to Tendaji, who views this as a great act of honor. She begins asking questions about his cultural background, and Raven quickly dismisses her, out of embarrassment. After this encounter, Tendaji gifts Raven with a seashell, the second gift in his planned proposal, now believingÂ their relationship has become serious, while she remains oblivious.

Tendaji has Eddie and Chelsea gift Raven with a dress, as Shakobian custom dictates it be delivered by her best friends. He also sends an invitation to her, at the embassy, where their marriage will take place.

Tendaji arrives at the ceremony and greets Raven, who is now aware of the Shakobian customs. Before she can tell him, she can't get married, he orders everyone to dance, separating the two. When Raven joins him again, she explains she was unaware of his traditions, and she is too young to get married. Tendaji also apologizes for not thoroughly explaining his customs, and the two decide to remain friends and continue the party anyway.

Once the party is over, Raven is forced by her mother to give back Tendaji's gifts, though she opts to keep his footmen for a small while.
