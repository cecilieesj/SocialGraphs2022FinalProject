He is designed to level entire forests.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Deforestator is a large purple, roughly wombat-like creature with dark purple markings on his arms and back, long blade-like claws on his front paws and a blade-like neck.

===Powers and abilities===
Deforestator can spin into a razor-sharp tornado that can cut through most substances. His claws and blade-like neck can rotate and function like a chainsaw, allowing him to spin at high speed, and he can jump real high.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 515 was the 515th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to cut down entire forests. 515 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point, Experiment 515 was activated and went on a rampage.

In "[[627 (episode)|627]]", [[Stitch]] chased after 515 and managed to corner him in an alley, defeat him, and rehabilitate him. [[Gantu]] and [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] then arrived for 515, named Deforestator. While Reuben lagged behind, Gantu pointed a [[Net Cannon|net cannon]] at Deforestator, but the latter was able to simply use his powers to force the duo to retreat.

In "[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]", Deforestator was one of the experiments that helped turn [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]] into a hotel.

Deforestator was one of the experiments in "[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against Gantu.

In "[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]", Deforestator was one of the first team of experiments (along with [[Kixx]] and [[Richter]]) formed to try and stop [[Ploot]]. However, Ploot was easily able to defeat them, forcing the three experiments to retreat.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Deforestator was one of the experiments in [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s dream.

Deforestator was seen on a computer screen in "[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]", posing as an evil creation of [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s as part of a hoax to fool [[Mortlegax]], the head of E.G.O. industries.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Deforestator, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Deforestator participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but they were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]," which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe. Deforestator can be seen in the audience cheering.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Deforestator made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime when [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] disguised him as a punk and was about to use him for another plan, but called it off after developing a temporary "soft side" while posing as a substitute teacher. Because of that, he didn't really do anything during the episode (except punished Hämsterviel for failing [[Delia]] again).

==Trivia==
*Deforestator was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.
*Deforestator is the first experiment to debut in [[627 (episode)|an episode]] not named after it, and to never have an eponymous episode. He shares this trait with [[Zap]], who happened to debut in the same episode. 
**Though [[Topper]] and [[Yaarp]] briefly appeared in "[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]", they still had their own [[Topper (episode)|respective]] [[Yaarp (episode)|episodes]].
*Even though Deforestator was activated off-screen, his [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is white according to "[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]".
*Jumba refers to him as: "Experiment 515: The Deforestator"; however, his official name is mentioned in "[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]".
*His number was also given to [[Splodyhead]] (in "[[Slushy (episode)|Slushy]]") and [[Ploot]], most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].
*Deforestator is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*Deforestator's body appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab]]''.
