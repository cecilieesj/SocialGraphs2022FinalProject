'''Celebrity Starr''' is a famous actress from the cartoon ''[[The Replacements]]''.

She first appeared in "[[The Frog Prince (Replacements)|The Frog Prince]]" as a replacement for [[Shelton Gunnar Klutzberry|Shelton]]'s imaginary girlfriend, Zelda. Celebrity became so annoying that Shelton broke up with her. Even with that she engaged to never let him go causing him to lose his glasses making him a "complete hottie", which was not her mood.

She returned in "[[Hollywoodn't]]" to get revenge on the young nerd by making a movie to dehumanize him. She ended up casting [[Todd Daring|Todd]] in wishes to pursue him. In the end, Todd turned her plan around and helped his friend. She instead made a movie to make fun of Todd. Celebrity also appeared as one of Scorpius' minions in "[[Irreplaceable]]".
