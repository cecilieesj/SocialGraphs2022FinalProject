====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In [[2023]], a short period after the [[Avengers: Endgame|Blip occurs]], the Pizza Delivery Man is on duty, when [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]], drive into [[Westview]]. A few moments later, he becomes entrapped in the town, as everything in the borders, is transformed, into a black and white, 1950s sitcom. He is assigned the new identity of Dennis, and is given the job of a mail man. Under this new persona, Dennis is aware of everything that happens, but but has no control, and feels Wanda's pain. When he goes to sleep, he suffers from Wanda's nightmares.

Dennis can be seen waving to the newly-wed couple, Wanda Maximoff, and her husband [[Vision]], as they drive into Westview, during the [[A Newlywed Couple|opening sequence]], of the [[Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience|first episode]].

The [[Don't Touch That Dial|second episode]], takes place in the 1960s. While [[Agatha Harkness|Agnes]] waits outside Wanda's home, she greets Dennis who is passing by, and he returns the greeting. She jokingly points an imaginary gun at him, and Dennis smiles and holds his hands up, asking her not to shoot, as he's just the messenger. She proceeds to shoot her guns, as Dennis walks past her.

In the [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]], when [[Billy Maximoff|Billy]] and [[Tommy Maximoff|Tommy]] lose their pet dog, [[Sparky (Marvel)|Sparky]], they go around the neighborhood calling for him. Dennis asks them what the problem is, and when they tell him they've lost their dog, he reassures them that he'll turn up, and their mother won't let him get far. 

In the [[Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision)|seventh episode]], Dennis is now a Delivery Man, and exporting a pile of fragile boxes. He passes by Wanda's house, and when she begins using her powers on [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]], he, along with the other residents surrounding the area, freeze. Once the confrontation between the two is over, Dennis continues with his orders, as if nothing happened.

One day, while Dennis is driving through town, he passes by Wanda, and asks that she doesn't shoot, as he's just the messenger, and heads forwards, chuckling to himself. Later on, the true personas of the towns residents are restored by Agatha Harkness. Dennis approaches Wanda, alongside several other people. He tells her how exhausted he is, and Wanda tries telling him, he's fine, while reassuring the group that she is protecting them, but they all simultaneously beg her, to free them. She screams at them to stop, releasing a burst of red magic, and placing them all in a choke. Dennis falls to the ground, unable to breathe, alongside everyone else, and Wanda quickly undoes this. Wanda promises that she will let them go, and begins lowering the Hex, surrounding Westview. Dennis and everyone run to escape, but it is quickly brought back, before he has the chance to leave. A battle ensues in the sky, between Wanda, and Agatha Harkness, and once it's over, the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Before Wanda leaves, she makes her way in town to speak to Monica Rambeau, and Dennis can be seen, amongst the various other townspeople, angrily staring at her, for the suffering she caused.
