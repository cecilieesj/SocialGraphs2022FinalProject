'''Pramesh Singh''' is the circus' snake charmer in the [[2019]] remake of ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''.

==Background==
Pramesh entertains guests using his snake-charming skills. Whenever they make a negative comment about his snakes, he angrily tips over the basket to to scare them away.

==Role in the film==
[[Holt Farrier]] encounters Pramesh with a python around him, happily arriving to see him back on the circus grounds. After a reminder from [[Ringmaster|Max Medici]], Pramesh and the other workers continue building the tent. The next day, Pramesh and the other circus performers gaze upon Jumbo Junior, recently born to [[Mrs. Jumbo]], in awe. Later at night, Pramesh entertains some guests using his flute to which he later tips over the basket which causes three cobras to scare away the guests giving negative comments in the sideshow section.

Later, Pramesh calmly plays his flute alongside [[Puck (Dumbo)|Puck]] who plays an accordion while [[Miss Atlantis]] sings "[[Baby Mine]]" just as [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], as he is now called, reunites with Mrs. Jumbo in confinement. The next day, Pramesh and the other performers sadly gaze upon Mrs. Jumbo being taken away just as Dumbo is sent to perform in the clown act, no longer included in the elephant one.

After Dumbo's act is a success, Pramesh explains to Max that in his country, a legend says that the gods can take animal forms just before the circus leaves for [[Dreamland]] in [[Arkansas]]. Furthermore, Pramesh and the other performers travel to an amusement park called Dreamland. After it is found out that Vandevere Enterprises has fired all the performers, Holt, his children, [[Joe Farrier|Joe]] and [[Milly Farrier|Milly]], and the performers plan to rescue Dumbo by releasing into the wild him alongside Mrs. Jumbo. Pramesh plays an important role in arriving at [[Nightmare Island]] which he and the other performers barge into by tricking one of the guards by using one of his cobras to scare him off just as the performers take the transport vehicle with Mrs. Jumbo inside just before the park owner, [[V.A. Vandevere]], and his guards try to stop the circus troupe. Later, Pramesh, Joe, Milly, and the rest of the performers spend their last moments with Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo before they get released into the wild.

Pramesh is not seen again for the rest of the film afterward, but due to the circus being re-established with a new rule about wild animals, it is likely that he released his snakes into the wild.

==Trivia==
*In one of the deleted scenes titled "Elephant Heist", the real reason why he is not seen again for the rest of the film afterward is because he went back home to Bombay in [[India]], and also he misses his land. It also reveals that Pramesh's cousin has a cargo ship that sails for Bombay and also he told [[Holt Farrier|Holt]] if he could bring [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], and [[Mrs. Jumbo]] to the port he promise him he’ll take them home.
**Also he was going to let Holt keep his snakes but he doesn't want to so instead he let Pramesh kept them.
*[[Casey Junior]] has a boxcar that has his name, and face on it. It is lettered “Pramesh Charming Enchanting”.
*While [[Miss Atlantis]] plays her ukulele and sings "[[Baby Mine]]" by a campfire, Pramesh plays alongside her while playing his flute.
*Was created solely for the remake and has no animated counterpart.
