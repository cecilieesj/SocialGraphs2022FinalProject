The '''Kings Men''' are the protectors of [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]], they follow the rules of the king, the [[Prince Charming (Goldie and Bear)|prince]] and the future king. There are three of them Sir Reginald, Sir Kenneth and Sir Dwight. They each look the same tall skinny men with long hanging mustaches wearing silver knights Armour. The only minor difference is the feather on top of there helmet. There first appearance they replaced the old kings men. They followed the rules so much even a minor infraction like swimming in the river was a cause of alarm. This stopped all the work and the play in fairy tale forest. They appeared again in several other episodes including the Bear that became King, Froggies Prince and Prince Charming's Day Off.
