==Background==
===Official Bio===
''Growing up, Noel was a highly popular and accomplished athlete, and many felt he would follow his older brother Wayne to Kringle Academy and then Prep & Landing. Although Noel always took great pride in his brother's heroics, he felt he could make a real difference in children's lives, and instead chose the Coal Elf Brigade as his vocation.''

''Noel has become one of the most esteemed members of the Coal Elf Brigade, working hard for the last 209 Christmas Eves delivering coal to children on the Naughty List. With his great brawn and keen insight into the minds of children, Noel is often regarded as the foremost Naughty Kid Expert. In his long career, he has never lost sight of the Coal Elf Brigade motto that "within every lump of coal is a diamond in the rough", and is proud of his job that helps rehabilitate children one lump of coal at a time.''

'''''Likes''':''
''Noel enjoys kicking back at Christmas Carol's in his free time. He is fond of Carol's famous ½ pound blackened herring special, but prefers it without parsley. Noel is also fond of his Jingle Gel Hair Cream, which keeps his magnificent head of hair "lustrous and luscious".''

'''''Dislikes''':''
''Noel doesn't like getting up before 10 a.m. He also hates doing laundry more than once every 3 months.''

'''''Random Facts''':''
''Noel is one of the few elves that command the begrudging respect of Thrasher the Reindeer. Noel sometimes joins Thrasher for Thursday night card games.''

''Noel holds the record at Christmas Carol's for staying on Bruiser the Mechanical Reindeer the longest: 9 hours, 16 minutes, and 43 seconds.''

'''''Favorite Christmas Cookie''':''
''Peanut Butter Yule Logs''

==Appearances==
===''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice]]''===
Noel is introduced when he arrives at Carol's tavern vis Natalé Turbo just as he introduces himself to the elves. Telling the other elves about saving Christmas, [[Wayne]] introduces [[Lanny]] to Noel as Wayne's little brother. While on an assignment, Noel encounters Thrasher who plans to take the three elves to Grace's house. On their way, Noel recaps his childhood relationship with Wayne just as Wayne remembers his relationship with Noel. Thrasher deploys Noel, Wayne, and Lanny to their destination.

Arriving there, Noel tells Wayne and Lanny to be careful while exploring the house to which Wayne unintentionally activates a ringtone causing Grace to watch over the elves at the living room. Just as the ringtone activates Grace's toy rabbit, Noel stops it while Lanny arrives at Grace's room. Just as Noel and Wayne hear [[Grace Goodwin|Grace]] demanding the password for the North Pole database to get herself off the Naughty List, Noel spies on the Fruitcake that Magee talked about. As Grace enters a password that damages the NPCECCC's system causing every nice children to be on the Naughty List, Noel and Grace get into a fight with the Fruitcake just as he retrieves it after falling into the road just as he stays in contact with Magee. Noel tells Lanny that he will be Elf of the Year, which upsets Wayne about this, thinking that Noel will replace Wayne as Elf of the Year. After an argument, Wayne realizes his mistakes after Noel recaps his past friendship as the two rejoice. Magee, however, contact Noel and Wayne that the database is in danger because  of Grace's suspicious plan allowing all the children to be on the Naughty List.

To stop this, Noel, Wayne, Grace, and Lanny head towards the big antenna just as Grace apologizes to Wayne for her naughty actions just as Wayne and Noel do teamwork together to reach the top of the antenna so that the Fruitcake can stay in contact with the NPCECCC by launching the Fruitcake onto the antenna to revert the problem Grace has caused earlier, saving Christmas once and for all. Back with Santa, he congratulates Noel and Wayne for their hard work just as Wayne and Noel are awarded for being Elf of the Year for their hard work.
