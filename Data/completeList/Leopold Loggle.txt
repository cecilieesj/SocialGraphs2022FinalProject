'''Leopold Loggle''' is a supporting character in the [[2019]] television series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Loggle is an all-around, nice and friendly carpenter. He is a dedicated individual who shows a passion for what he does. He does have a strong sense of discipline and, like most workers, prefers to have validation. He was seriously upset at his business getting destroyed and refused to have Anne and the Plantars leave until he was satisfactorily compensated.

===Physical appearance===
Loggle is a light blue axolotl with dark blue gills (the horns on his head). He has small white tufts of hair on the side just above his gills and a big white mustache. He has a light green tongue and his eyes are small and look closed. When they do open, they are white and have tiny blue pupils.

He wears a pair of goggles that wrap around his head. The left lense is clear while the right lense is green with three small settings on it. He wears a beige shirt, brown work apron and grey boots. To top it off, he wears a red neck scarf that is supposed to cover a small healed hole over his neck from a metal smith accident.

Starting with "[[Commander Anne]]", Loggle has undergone a significant change and now sports a large masculine body that makes him taller than most of the Wartwood citizens. He still retains his clothing, but now lacks his beige shirt and red scarf.

===Abilities===
*'''Wood carpentry:''' Loggle works at a local carpentry shop. He is shown to be capable of building small things like coo coo clocks to big and complicated things like a statue of Anne dabbing.
*'''Metal workings:''' Loggle has implied that he has worked with metal before as his occupation prior.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Anne or Beast?]]", Loggle is seen amongst the crowd hearing [[One-Eyed Wally]] describe his encounter with a monster and cheers when [[Mayor Toadstool]] proposes that they catch the creature. After discovering the monster to be a human girl named [[Anne Boonchuy]], Loggle is amongst the mob leaving after the Plantar family volunteer to take care of Anne.

In "[[Cane Crazy]]", after Anne accidentally breaks a cane belonging to [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]], Anne, [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]], and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] go to him to see if he can fix it. Unfortunately, he doesn't know how repair the cane nor can he give them a new cane identical to the old one, due to the can being made from wood from a rare tree called the "Doom Tree."

After Anne, Sprig, and Polly go to the Doom Tree, it is revealed to be a living creature which chases them all the way to his shop. Loggle watches as the Doom Tree and the Plantar kids damage his workshop. When they throw termites at it, the insects strip the Doom Tree of its wooden exoskeleton and it leaves.

Even though they got rid of the Doom Tree, Loggle tells them they have to pay him for the damages to his workshop. Sprig decides to give Leopold Anne's click pen, which Loggle finds fascinating, and he accepts it as payment.

In "[[Toad Tax]]", Loggle is robbed by [[Bog, Fens, and Mire]] as he was one of the individuals on the Mayor's list who did not pay their taxes to [[Toad Tower]]. After Bog steals his statue, Anne returns one of Loggle's wood cravings to him, making Loggle happy as he cries tears of joy.

Later, at the Plantar Farm, Loggle witnesses Anne standing up to the toads and calling them out bullying the frogs. Amazed by Anne's bravery and selflessness, Loggle is amongst the crowd of citizens would come to defend Anne after she is severely injured by the toads. After discovering [[Mayor Toadstool]] is exposed for hoarding the town's taxes, everyone gets their stolen belongings back and Loggle cheers for Anne, naming her the official protector of Wartwood while coming to respect her.

In "[[Children of the Spore]]", after Anne, Sprig, and Polly broke Hop Pop's ship model replica of a warship called ''The Green Lady'', Loggle was visited by Hop Pop who asked for stuff to repair it. When Loggle asked him if it was a replica, Hop Pop told him it was and Loggle gave him the tools needed to repair the ship. Leopold was later among those under [[Apothecary Gary]]'s control, but was later freed when Bessie ate Apothecary Gary's mushroom.

==Trivia==
* Loggle is Matt Braly's favorite of the citizens of Wartwood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Radrappy/status/1141051071713800192|title=So glad you all get to meet one of my favorite citizens of Wartwood today: Leopold Loggle! Voiced by the incredible @DuckMaillard and designed by @boodlebrain and Brandon Wu!!! And yes, he's an axolotl.|website=Twitter|date=June 18, 2019}}</ref>
* While Loggle is an Axolotl that walks around on land, real Axolotls prefer to stay in the water at all times as they dry up quickly.
* Loggle used to be a metalsmith, but quit when he fell and impaled his voice box on a pipe. Because of this, he has a bizarre speaking issue where he would speak using a positive before becoming a negative ("I doooooo-n't).
** Axolotls have the ability to regenerate lost limbs, thus it is possible that while he was able to regenerate his voice box, it came out wrong.
** In "[[Reunion (Amphibia)|Reunion]]", it is shown that everyone is annoyed with Loggle's voice issues.
*When the episode "[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]" was leaked online, a personal message from Loggle was released asking fans to wait for the official release of the episode and suggested taking up woodworking to pass the time, though not before having another vocal issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Radrappy/status/1390350554925203457|title=Loggle Leak Post|website=Twitter|date=May 6, 2021}}</ref>
