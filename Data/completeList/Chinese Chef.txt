==Trivia==
*In the [[1941]] film ''[[The Reluctant Dragon]]'', when Robert Benchley is touring the studio's Maquette-Making Department, a model sheet of the Chinese Chef is visible on the wall behind him.
*A possible reason why this character was scrapped out of the film was because the design resembled racial stereotypes of Asians.
*Another possible reason why this character was removed was that in the original Peter Pan book, there was no mention of this character or any Asian character in the book.
