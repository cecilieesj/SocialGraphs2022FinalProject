'''The Caseyettes''' are the nine daughters of baseball player, [[Casey]], and his wife (who's known only as "Mrs. Casey"). All nine of the daughters (which includes a set of twins and a set of triplets) all look identical to their mother, with the only real physical differences between the nine sisters being their hairstyles and their heights.

The names of the twins (the second-oldest daughter and the third-from-oldest daughter), the second-youngest daughter and the third-from-youngest daughter are never revealed -- but the daughters whose names are revealed are Patsy (the oldest daughter), Colleen (the youngest daughter) and the triplets, who're named Kim (the fourth-from-oldest daughter), Peg (the middle child of the nine daughters) and Jan (the fourth-from-youngest daughter).

The daughters are first featured in [[Casey Bats Again|'''''Casey Bats Again''''']] -- after Casey has lost the game from the previous short, his wife (known only as "Mrs. Casey") reveals that she's going to have a baby (specifically their first child). Excited by this news, Casey hopes to have a son in order to groom him and have him carry on his legacy (and hopefully redeem his reputation) as a baseball player -- and while they do manage to have a total of nine kids (through six different pregnancies), all nine of their kids end up being girls.

Casey's initially dismayed at not having at least one son -- however, all nine of his daughters prove to be excellent baseball players, and Casey's friends point out that his daughters could still carry on his legacy (and potentially redeem his reputation) as a baseball player. Realizing this, Casey forms a baseball consisting of his daughters (now collectively referred to as "The Caseyettes").

In the end, the Caseyettes ultimately redeem their dad's reputation as a baseball player.
