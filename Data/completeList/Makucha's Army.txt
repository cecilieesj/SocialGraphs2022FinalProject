'''Makucha's Army''' is an army of vicious (and mostly carnivorous) animals led by [[Makucha]] and later [[Mama Binturong]]. Their goal is to get revenge on [[Lion Guard]] and eat every rare, exotic, weak, lame, or sick animal from the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] as the main antagonists of Season 3.

==Background==
In "[[The Harmattan]]", Makucha brought in two leopards named [[Fahari]] and [[Jiona]] to help him get to the Tree of Life while the Lion Guard goes on their way to the Tree while dealing with a powerful harmattan. While the Lion Guard was able to get through, the leopards do not hear [[Ono]]'s warning to get shelter behind the rocks as Makucha decides to go to the Tree on his own.

By "[[Ghost of the Mountain]]" and "[[Dragon Island]]", Makucha recruits a snow leopard named "[[Chuluun]]" and a Komodo dragon named "[[Ora]]" so they can join Makucha to join forces to take revenge against the Lion Guard to which Makucha recruits new animals other than leopards to join him.

In "[[The River of Patience]]", Makucha's Army ambushes the Tree of Life to which [[Kion]] and the [[Night Pride]] were able to fight against them. During the battle, [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]]'s little brother [[Baliyo]] gets injured by Ora to which Kion and the Night Pride are able to defeat them while Baliyo ends up getting healed. After getting defeated, Mama Binturong joins and takes leadership of Makucha's Army and plans to take revenge against the Lion Guard and the Night Pride, especially [[Bunga]] since Bunga is Mama Binturong's most feared enemy.

By "[[Little Old Ginterbong]]", Mama Binturong disguises herself as a limping animal to be healed by Queen [[Janna]] to which the Lion Guard only found out that she is actually playing dirty tricks with the other animals to which Kion warns [[Ullu]] to tell Rani that Mama Binturong is working for Chuluun as the Guard manages to defeat the predators alongside Bunga and his new friend [[Binga]] who are able to defeat Mama Binturong.

In "[[Long Live the Queen]]", Makucha's Army stalks a [[Varya|tiger]] family to which the Lion Guard and the Night Pride defeat the enemies and save the [[Feliks, Pasha, and Polina|tigers]] from their demise.

By "[[The Lake of Reflection]]", Makucha and his Army begins attacking the Tree of Life once again to which Kion begins to lose confidence as a leader. As the army attacks again, the heroes were able to defeat the enemies.

In "[[The Triumph of the Roar]]", Makucha and his Army begin a final showdown against the Lion Guard and the Night Pride by bringing in reinforcements to make his army stronger. Fahari and Jiona arrive after surviving the harmattan, [[Smun]] and his porcupines also arrive to protect Mama Binturong, and the two [[Komodo Dragon|Komodo dragons]] who survived their encounter in Dragon Island also assist Ora as Makucha plans to kill the Lion Guard, the Night Pride, and all the other animals living there so that Makucha's Army can eat the rare animals once more. Soon as Makucha's Army begins attacking the animals and trapping [[Makini]] and the Night Pride inside the Tree of Life, Kion uses the Power of the [[Roar of the Elders]] after practicing with [[Askari]] to rescue the victims trapped inside and defeat Makucha's Army. Kion then uses the roar to create a tornado to suck up Makucha and all the members of his army to send all the villains far away from the Tree of Life to never be seen again, defeating all of them.

==Trivia==
*This is the third group of different species of animals. The first one was the Lion Guard, which lasted until the end of the series, and the second one was the disbanded [[Army of Scar]]. Unlike those groups, this is the only that remained together and was never disbanded.
