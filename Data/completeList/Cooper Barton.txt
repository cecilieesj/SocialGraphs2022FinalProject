'''Cooper Barton''' is a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character that appears in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', played by Ben Sakamoto.

Cooper Barton is the first son of [[Hawkeye|Clint Barton/Hawkeye]] and [[Laura Barton]]. He's the sibling of [[Lila Barton|Lila]] and [[Nathaniel Barton]].

He lives at the Barton Family Farm with her family. Cooper and his family are not in any government files, which is why the Barton Family Farm is used by [[Avengers|the Avengers]] as a place to hide and lay low.

In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Cooper and his family have a  picnic outside their house with Cooper playing baseball with Nathaniel. Cooper, alongside half of all life in the universe, later died at the hands of an [[Infinity Gauntlet]]-wielding Thanos; but was restored to life 5 years later, when the [[Hulk]] used the [[Infinity Stones]] that him and the Avengers retrieved from alternate timelines, to undo [[Thanos]]' work.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Cooper is named "Callum" before he, along with his mother and siblings were murdered by Black Widow.
