'''Aldarn''' is a supporting character in the [http://witch.wikia.com/wiki/W.I.T.C.H._(TV_series) animated series].

==Chronology==
Aldarn is the son of weapon maker Aketon and the second-in-command of the Meridian Rebellion. He is the best friend of Caleb and helps him in almost all his missions. He tries street-talk a few times to get Cornelia -and fails. In "''Caleb's Challenge''", he was hypnotized by Elyon into signing a peace treaty, and challenged Caleb leadership to the rebellion. He was able to break the spell and their friendship returned. He was the top commander during the Battle of Meridian Plains, but was captured by Elyon and put in the dungeons, only to be saved by W.I.T.C.H, Caleb and Tynar. After Phobos' defeat he helped the Mage guard Phobos' cell and was one of the first four along with Vathek, Drake and Tynar to be attacked by Nerissa. In season 2, Caleb, Aldarn, Julian, and Drake are awarded medals for their bravery.

He is later captured by the Knights of Vengeance after he is awarded the Medal of Honor from Elyon for being in the rebellion. He is rescued, though. He is usually in charge of the catapults when the Knights attack the palace. When the Knights released Phobos, Aldarn tried to hold the gate but failed. Later on, Phobos released the Knights after betraying W.I.T.C.H. and attacked Meridian and Kandrakar. Aldarn participated in both these battles, helping holding out Phobos' and Cedric's minions while Caleb went after Miranda. Once peace was restored to Meridian, he continued to work as a Royal Guard.{{W.I.T.C.H}}
