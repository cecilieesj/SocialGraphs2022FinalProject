'''Glee Club Girl''' (real name unknown) is a character in the animated series ''[[Fillmore!]]'' and a member of X Middle School's Glee Club. She's among the singers in an ''a capella'' group who belong to that particular club. She is voiced by [[Mae Whitman]].<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Glee-Club-Girl/</ref>


==Background==

===Personality===
As a singer, Glee Club Girl is musically-inclined and seems to be a natural. The little else that is known about her personality is that she is very touchy, at least when it comes to Arthur Stanley's deception (and possibly any forms of deception in general). She's also ill-humored and discontented in that she doesn't appreciate being toyed with like that, and she has no time nor patience for it. Therefore, she doesn't stand for that kind of game.

===Appearance===
Glee Club Girl is a pre-teen, Caucasian girl. She has brown hair with a fringe and in pigtails, and has green eyes. Her outfit is similar to the uniform that the male singers of the Glee Club wear: Except that aside from the white, long-sleeved shirt with folded collar, she also wears a fancier red bow tie and a gray skirt rather than pants.


== Next Stop, Armageddon ==

Since the room where the Glee Club is held is next to the Safety Patrol's headquarters, she and the other members are often seen. She seems to be the only female soloist in the group. She and the other Glee Club members had a brief role, singing at Principal Folsom's birthday party in <ref>"[[Next Stop, Armageddon]]"</ref>.

== Play On, Maestro! Play On ==

She has a significant role in: <ref>"[[Play On, Maestro! Play On]]"</ref>, when she and three other girls (another of which was Maryanne Greene) confronted Arthur Stanley. After eventually finding out that he had been four-timing them, as he was dating them all at the same time without one another's knowledge, they're very displeased with and crossed at him.
