'''Birdie McQuack''' is the mother of [[Launchpad McQuack]]. She, [[Ripcord McQuack|her husband]], and [[Loopey McQuack|daughter]] make up a team of stunt-pilots called the "Flying McQuacks". It appears they make their living traveling to different air shows, preforming stunts. She made her first (and so far only) appearance in ''[[DuckTales]]'' when the "The Flying McQuacks" are coming to [[Duckburg]] for an air show, where Launchpad is flying an experimental jet.

==Appearances==
So far, Birdie's only appearance was in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[Top Duck]]", where she and the rest of the McQuack family save [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s money bin from the [[Beagle Boys]].

Launchpad briefly mentioned his mother in ''[[DuckTales Remastered]]''. When he accidentally drops his fuel regulator, he says: "Uh, my mom always said I was a butterfingers!"
