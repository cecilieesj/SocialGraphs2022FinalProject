Eli lives with his grandfather, [[Isaiah Bradley]], a super soldier, with enhanced strength, who becomes reclusive, to the outside world. One day, two men knock on his front door, to see Isaiah. Eli denies that anyone of the name lives there, but they request to simply talk. Eli, again, denies them entry, and tells them they can leave, when the man tells him to inform Isaiah, that the guy from Goyang is there, and he will know what that means. Eli tells his grandfather, who upon hearing this, gives his grandson permission to let the pair enter. The two men are revealed to be [[Bucky Barnes]], who shares a past with his granfather, and [[Sam Wilson]]. Eli witnesses Bucky tries to talk to Isaiah about the rise of super soldiers, but Isaiah calls him out, over the injustices he faces following their confrontation, years ago. He refuses to give them help, demanding they leave, and Eli escorts the pair out.

One night, while out playing basketball, Eli finds Sam, walking down his street. He heads in his direction, and questions what he's doing and where he's going. Sam states he's going to see Isaiah, and Eli reveals he's in the back. As Sam thanks him and walks off, Eli add's he'll also be back there, and resumes his game.

Later one evening, Eli and his grandfather witness Sam's speech to the GRC on television, regarding his status as the new Captain America, and the relocation of the Blip-displaced people. Sam later arrives at the Bradley household, where Eli questions what he wants, before Elijah sees to him. Sam them escorts the pair, to the Smithsonian's Captain America exhibit, where a statue of Isaiah has been erected, commemerating his contributions.
