'''Old Lace''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''. She is a Deinonychus, a theropod dromaeosaurid/raptor dinosaur, brought back to life with genetic engineering. She possesses a psychic link with [[Gert Yorkes]]. As such, Gert Yorkes adopts her, and she becomes a member of [[the Runaways]]. Since Gert Yorkes has no special powers or weapons, Old Lace acts as Gert's combat partner, helping Gert whenever she has to fight the forces of evil.

Old Lace was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona.
