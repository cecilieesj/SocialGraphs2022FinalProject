The '''Sixth Brother''' (formerly named '''Bil Valen''') is an [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] and the main antagonist of ''[[Star Wars]]'' Disney novel ''[[Ahsoka]]'' and a secondary antagonist in ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord'' ''of the Sith'', by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was defeated and killed by [[Ahsoka Tano]]. He is described as tall with unnatural-looking grey skin, piercing ice-blue eyes, broad shoulders, and distinctive scar-like markings on his cheeks, nose, and chin, making him sinister in appearance. He also has a cybernetic left arm, courtesy of a training session with [[Darth Vader]] in which the Sith Lord cut off his limb.

==Background ==
=== Personality ===
Arrogant and sadistic, the Sixth Brother has no qualms about killing those who stood in his way to draw out his prey, force surrender or obtain information. He is very good at espionage and interrogation, and is easily annoyed by the incompetence of Imperial Interrogators. He also is avid in his hunt for Jedi, and willing to overlook a Force-sensitive child he was seeking in order to hunt "bigger prey".

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[The Force]]:''' The Sixth Brother has a strong connection to the Force.
**'''Telekinesis:''' The Sixth Brother can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes.
***'''Saber Throw:''' The Sixth Brother can telekinetically guide his lightsaber towards his opponents and return the weapon back to his hand, similar to a boomerang or shuriken.
**'''Force Dash:''' The Sixth Brother can move at amazing speeds.

====Abilities====
*'''Skilled Lightsaber Duelist:''' The Sixth Brother is a skilled, albeit sloppy lightsaber duelist. He lacks finesse, but made up for that in brute strength. He showed enough skill to deflect blaster bolts and throw his lightsaber with deadly precision. Despite this, his lightsaber combat skills are proven to be inferior to [[Ahsoka Tano]]'s, as the ex-Jedi proved to be more than a match for him even without her lightsabers, ultimately killing the Sixth Brother by causing his lightsaber to explode.

===Weapons and Equipment===
====Lightsaber====
The Sixth Brother's valued weapon and possession is his red lightsaber.
*'''[[Lightsaber|Double-bladed spinning lightsaber]]:''' The Sixth Brother had built a red double-bladed spinning lightsaber. It would remain in the Sixth Brother's possession until his death, when his lightsaber exploded due to [[Ahsoka Tano]] stealing the lightsaber's [[kyber crystal]]s while it was activated. After the Sixth Brother's death, Ahsoka took his lightsaber components and imbued the crystals with the light side of the force to construct her two white-bladed lightsabers. The crystals in the Sixth Brother's lightsaber were taken from the [[Jedi Temple|Coruscant Jedi Temple]], as Ahsoka could recognize them through the Force.

==Appearances==
===''[[Ahsoka]]''===
At one point a Jedi, the Sixth Brother fell to the dark side and swore loyalty to the [[Sith]] and the Galactic Empire. Trained by [[Darth Vader]] alongside the other Inquisitors, he began hunting down surviving Jedi and Force-sensitives. To this end, he studied records taken from the Jedi Temple to further combat his enemies.

During an assignment to track down a Force-sensitive little girl named Hadala Fardi on the planet of Thabeska, the Sixth Brother heard about a Jedi on the farming moon of Raada, where he learned from Jenneth Pilar, an information broker working with the Empire on the moon, that a Jedi or Padawan had been involved in an uprising by a local farmer community opposing the Empire's plans for Raada. During the uprising, teenage farm worker Kaeden Larte had been captured and tortured for information. The Brother scoffed at the techniques used on Larte by the imperial officers stationed on Raada, which proved ineffective. The Sixth Brother learned that Larte was then broken out of the Imperial base by a Force-sensitive being; the former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]].

The Sixth Brother then tracked Larte and the other farm workers who rebelled against the Imperial presence to a set of mountain caves far from the settlement. Kaeden surrendered herself to the Inquisitor, but her friends soon attacked the dark side adept. The Sixth Brother deflected the attacks of the farmers, killing them with sickening ease. As a show of strength to further intimidate Kaeden Larte, the Sixth Brother then threw his lightsaber at the Rodian farmer, Kolvin, who was instantly cut in half and killed.

When Ahsoka Tano returned to Raada, she discovered that the Sixth Brother had kidnapped Kaeden. Ahsoka was also in the process of rebuilding her lightsabers, and heard the kyber crystals in the Brother's double-bladed lightsaber sing to her through the [[the Force]]. During her battle with the Sixth Brother, Ahsoka used the Force to pull the crystals from his lightsaber. His lightsaber then became unstable and exploded, killing the Sixth Brother once and for all.

===''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith''===
In Marvel Comic's ongoing series, Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith, Sixth Brother is one of the Inquisitors who trains with Vader, and during his sparring session with the Sith Lord, has his arm sliced off by Vader's lightsaber. When questioned about why the Sith lord sliced off his follower's arm by the Grand Inquisitor, Vader replies that it will teach him about loss and not to forget it, before the scene cuts to the [[Fifth Brother]] and another Inquisitor, who have both lost limbs or are grievously wounded by Vader's "training".

==Trivia==
*Like the [[Fifth Brother]], the Sixth Brother is described as a member of an unknown, gray-skinned species. It is unknown if the two are members of the same species or if this is merely coincidence, and ''Ahsoka'' seems to imply that the coloring of the Sixth Brother may not have been natural. He is also noted to have strange, tattoo-like markings and blue eyes. It is also unknown whether the Sixth Brother's position was filled by another Inquisitor following his demise.
