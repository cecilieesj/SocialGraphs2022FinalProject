==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
At the beginning of "[[Dance of the Hours]]", the ostriches awakened by Madame Upanova and one of them is tying her ballet shoes while the others are warming up. Then they are all prepared to dance. Later, Upanova feeds her students some fruits as they try to grab the grapes from her as the squabbling ostriches chase her. They later appear during the end of the segment where Ben Ali Gator and his alligators try to woo Hyacainth Hippo where they pull the ostriches and elephants hiding in the pillars believing that Ben could be a trap as the dancers begin dancing with the alligators.

==Trivia==
*Despite being referred to as female by the development staff, the Ostriches' feather colors are of males'. Much like peacocks, where males are bright and colorful and have long tails, and females are shades of brown and grey where they lack long tails, only male ostriches have black and white feathers, while females are varying shades of brown in real life.
