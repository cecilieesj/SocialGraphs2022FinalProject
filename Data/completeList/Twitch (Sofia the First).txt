==Role in the series==
Twitch first appears in "[[The Mystic Isles: The Falcon's Eye]]" when Prisma is in her cell and he introduces himself. When Prisma ask him for a favor, he willingly helps her. She tells him how to get the [[Vor|Locket of Vor]] from the chamber, and retrieves the locket, where Prisma promises she'll share the power with him. The locket tells Prisma about the [[Wicked Nine]] and how they'll restore her powers, but she cannot get out. Twitch offers to get to them because he's picked Prisma as his master as he's always wanted a powerful one. The Spirit says the first of the Wicked Nine they need to find is the Falcon's Eye, which is in a marketplace in Wei-Ling, and Twitch leaves to retrieve it.

He fails to get the Falcon’s Eye, but steals Sofia’s Necessi-Key and takes it back to Prisma, allowing her to escape her prison cell.

Later in "[[The Mystic Isles: The Great Pretender]]", he and Prisma go to [[Royal Preparatory Academy|Royal Prep]] to steal Maleficent's Spindle. After discovering the only way to get it is by using dragon fire to break the protection spell on the door hiding it, Twitch helps Clover make dragon fire for an animal helper test, then steals it. Sofia and Clover then catch up to Twitch and Prisma, retrieving the Spindle, though Twitch and Prisma escape again.

In the series finale, [[Forever Royal]]" Twitch and Wormwood and Prisma release [[Vor]] from the locket. The spirit of Vor lunges into Prisma and takes control of her. Twitch and Wormwood quickly blow off their shock by this. Twitch turns into a black winged unicorn and the three and start their evil plan with their new mistress.

Twitch eventually met his defeat when Wormwood's former master [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]] made a cage magically appear and lock the rat inside (and then does the same to Wormwood). It is unknown what happened to him and Wormwood after Vor was defeated.
