He loves anything related to the Old West and decorated his office in that fashion he also wears a bolo tie, which he is fond of. (Another name for a bolo tie is a Lariete.) Laritate has an on-and-off relationship with Alex—in that he is disappointed in Alex's lack of work ethic and unwillingness to do well in school, but it is evident that he cares about her through his many efforts to reach out to her. The reason he punishes her so severely is because he still believes that she can still turn herself around, unlike other students who he either knows he can't get through to; won't do whatever they did wrong again. He holds a pop quiz every Thursday, however, he gives the answers in all the questions except when asking Alex whom he believes should be able to handle harder questions like Justin. He makes Alex join the Happy Helpers Club and is Alex's art teacher in the episode "[[Art Teacher]]".

Mr. Laritate is also the adviser of several activities at the school including the World School Summit at the U.N., Happy Helpers Club and Quiz Bowl, and he teaches a History class and a Marriage and Family class. He once taught the art class. In season two's "[[Don't Rain on Justin's Parade – Earth]]," Mr. Laritate calls Alex an evil genius, much to Alex's pleasure. He does not have a college degree said in Franken Girl. Mr. Laritate is one of Justin and Alex's teachers.

In the episode "[[Alex's Logo]]", it's revealed that Mr. Laritate's first name is Hershel.
