'''Princess Jorala''' is a minor character that appeared in ''[[Super Buddies]].''

==Role in the [[Super Buddies|film]]==
It was mentioned in a comic book, told by Bartelby Livingstone, that Jorala is the princess of the planet known as Ispirion. After knowing that [[Drex]] sought out to steal the rings, Jorala grew concerned about Megasis' safety. He promised that he would come back and marry her: however, the mission took almost 32 years.

Later, after [[Megasis/Captain Canine|Megasis]] was fully healed by the Buddies' ring power from Drex's fatal attack, Princess Jorala arrived and thanked everyone for what they've done. She gave Bartelby her necklace in his honor and was able to take back the rings. After Megasis returned to his normal alien form, they (along with Monk-E) went back to Inspirion. It is implied that Jorala married Megasis at some point afterwards.
