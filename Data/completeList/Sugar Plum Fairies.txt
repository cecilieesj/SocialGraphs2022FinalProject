They are small beautiful female fairies of different colors who are responsible for sublimating the nature, the night, in autumn and winter.
==Background==
The Sugar Plum Fairies are fairies responsible for controlling the change of the seasons. To accomplish this, there are different types of them to control over each season. Their kind includes '''Dewdrop Fairies''', who create dewdrops for the flowers and can have different colors (pink, red, green, emerald with yellow, blue, and orange); the '''Summer Fairies''', who are green and change spring to summer; '''Autumn Fairies''', who are orange and grey and change summer to autumn; the icy-blue '''Frost Fairies''', who change autumn to winter; and the '''Snowflake Fairies''', who have pale color skin and wear crowns, and wear a snowflake around their bodies. Every time one type is done, they fall to sleep to allow the next group of fairies to perform their task in the seasonal cycle.

==Appearances ==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
As dawn breaks over a meadow during the "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy", tiny fairies sprinkle drops of dew on every flower and stern.

In the final musical segment, "Waltz of the Flowers", autumn fairies color everything they touch brown and gold with their wands. Then the frost fairies arrive and everything becomes part of an icy, jewel-like pattern among falling snowflakes.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
The Sugar Plum Fairies appear on the show like the subjects of the [[Blue Fairy]] and [[Snow White]]'s acquaintances. [[Nova]] and [[Tinker Bell]] are members of this tribe.

===''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''===
[[The Sugar Plum Fairy|A member of their race]] is the main antagonist in the film.

==Disney Parks==
The Sugar Plum Fairies have their own spell card in ''[[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]'' called "The Sugarplum Fairies' Dewdrop Spiderweb".
