==Appearances==
===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===
In ''[[Bee Inspired]]'', Spike repeatedly frightens [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], keeping [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] from finishing her painting. In the end, they become friends and Spike saves Mickey from an angry swarm of his companions by giving a dramatic speech (all in buzz language with subtitles). 

In ''[[New Shoes]]'', Spike torments [[Goofy]] while stuck in [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s body and later Donald, after returning to his body alongside the rest of Donald's recurring tormentors ([[Chip and Dale]],  [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], and [[Scrooge McDuck]]).

===''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''===
In ''[[Mount Rushmore or Less]]'', Spike (or at least a look-alike) appears in a brief cameo when [[Humphrey the Bear]] goes after a large amount of honey in [[New Quackmore]].

==Printed material==
Spike the Bee made a handful of appearances in Disney comics. In the 1948 ''[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+WDC++92-12 Inferior Decorator] ''he attacks [[Donald's House|Donald's house]] with a whole swarm of bees because [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s new wallpaper represents flowers.

==Disney Parks==
Spike would be used for [[Epcot]]'s 2018 Flower and Garden Festival as the host for the ''Spike's Pollen Nation Exploration'' scavenger hunt game. Twelve figures of Spike were placed around gardens throughout [[World Showcase]] to mark the different spots. Spike would return as the mascot for the 2020 festival.

==Trivia==
* The Bee enemy design in ''[[DuckTales Remastered]]'' resembles Spike's original design from ''Window Cleaners''.
* He has stung multiple times, meaning he's a bumblebee, as honey bees can only sting once before dying.
* In the [[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]] episode [[Risky Beesness]] there is a swarm of bees that resemble him.
