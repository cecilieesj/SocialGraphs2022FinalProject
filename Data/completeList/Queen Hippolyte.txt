}}'''Queen Hippolyte''' is a minor character in the Disney animated series, ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. She is the monarchical leader to the Amazons, a tribe of all-female exclusive warriors, famous in Greece and is the mother of [[Tempest]].

==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==
In "[[Hercules and the Girdle of Hippolyte]]", while training with Phil, Hercules learns that during a Damsel-in-Distress training he was rescuing a guy doll. Phil tells him that heroes shouldn't save men they only save damsels. Meanwhile after Queen Hippolyte believes that her daughter, [[Tempest]] is going soft and weak, she kidnaps her, and makes her undergo a savage initiation ceremony to regain her status as an Amazonian warrior and to earn the right to wear the Golden Girdle. Hercules follows in a misguided rescue attempt only to learn she's just fine.
