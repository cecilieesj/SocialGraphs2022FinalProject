==Role in the series==
Pip and Pop are two inseparable purple otters who live on the [[Otter Pond|otter pond]] behind [[the Big Blue House]] on ''Bear in the Big Blue House''. They are cousins, and share a set of grandparents: [[Otto and Etta Otter]]. They are both obsessed with clams (though Pip loves steamed clams, whereas Pop loves stuffed clams), and enjoy the game of checkers. They often speak simultaneously — saying or singing the same thing in unison or in a two-part harmony.

They look almost identical, but there are a couple of minor differences. Pop's ears are slightly higher on his head, and his eyes are slightly larger and closer together than Pip's. Thus, "Pop's ears are on top" and Pip's ears are towards the front. Another difference Pip and Pop have noted about themselves is that Pop is able to make some very funny faces that Pip is not able to. According to [[Noel MacNeal]], "Pip was always on camera left. So ... it's [[Peter Linz]] on the left, and Tyler Bunch on the right."

When Pip and Pop are not at the Big Blue House, they can often be found at the Otter Pond. This is no surprise, as they love water. They can also be found hanging out and playing in the bathtub a fair amount.

One of Pip and Pop's favorite toys is a talking clam named Clammy, which they receive in the mail in "[[The Way I Feel Today]]".

They were both brown in the pitch tape for the series, and Pip was initially named Pummel.

==Notable Episodes==
*"[[Love Is All You Need]]" - Pip and Pop explore love and perform the "Otter Love Rap," also featured in other episodes and the live show.
*"[[Rockin' Rocko]]" - Pip and Pop's cousin Rocko pays a visit to the Big Blue House.
*"[[At the Old Bear Game]]" - Pip and Pop meet their baseball hero and learn some things they never knew about [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]].
