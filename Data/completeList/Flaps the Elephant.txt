He also appeared in the Episode [[CasaBonkers]]

== Biography ==
At the start of the episode, Flaps and his lackeys Meenie, Miney, and Moe are inside the Toon Museum, home of the world's greatest collection of memorabilia from various Disney cartoons. One of the artifacts is [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]]'s flag, which the flying elephant flew with at the end of the [[Dumbo (1941 film)|film]] in which he made his first appearance. Flaps plans to make a fortune by selling the flag to the highest bidder. But when he removes the flag from its display, he triggers the alarm. When the police arrive on the scene, the mice blow up the door while Flaps fires peanuts at them. After a chase, which results in the getaway car crashing, Flaps puts his lackeys (and the stolen flag) on [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]]' doorstep while he tries to lose the cops. [[Miranda Wright]] ends up cornering Flaps in an alleyway. Flaps tries to fly away, but since his ears are way to small to hold him up, he crashes into a chain link fence and gets stuck in a trash can. Miranda slaps handcuffs on Flaps' wrists shortly after he gets the can off.
