When [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] exit the library and head into the hallway while pursuing Noah Hawthorne in <ref>A Wurm in Our Midst</ref>, she appears briefly. Asking if either of them has seen a full-scale model of Mt. Vesuvius, which she's missing. Prior to that, she's also among the crowd seen at the baking contest held in the cafeteria, who then flee when some custard overflows from a giant bowl that tilts and the custard floods the lunchroom. This is due to the weight of the bowl on a wooden platform, causing its legs to buckle and give way, which [[Mr. Geary]] recounts as a contestant in a flashback.
