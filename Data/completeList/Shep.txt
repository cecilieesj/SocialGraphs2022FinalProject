'''Shep''' is [[George of the Jungle (character)|George]]'s faithful elephantÂ pet and the secondary tritagonist of the movie, ''[[George of the Jungle]]'' and its [[George of the Jungle 2|sequel]].

== Personality ==
Shep is a very friendly and loyal pet elephant, he is also very energetic and very fast. Even though real elephants can't run, only walk fast.

==Appearances==
===''[[George of the Jungle]]''===
Shep first appears when George calls for him to bring [[Ursula Stanhope|Ursula]] back to her group, when Shep comes running up to his master Ursula is afraid of him at first. But George convinces her to pet him, then whispers into Shep's ear and has him pick up Ursula in his trunk and she apparently enjoys it. When Ursula hands George a stick and asks if Shep fetches, George tosses it away and throws for him a much larger stick. Shep fetches the stick and ends up dropping it on [[Ape]]'s roses much to his dismay. Soon Shep takes George and Ursula out into the jungle to find her group, but when it gets late the trio rests by a small spring, while Shep briefly chews on a giant dog biscuit (which [[The Narrator]] finds "too much" and it disappears).

Later on after [[Lyle Van de Groot|Lyle]] and his two associates [[Max and Thor]] find George's Treehouse, Max and Thor attempt to shoot Shep for his ivory tusks, Ape quickly jumps out of the treehouse and tells Shep to run for his life.

Sometime later after Ursula has brought George back home with her to [[San Francisco]] Shep and the other animals are going gaga for missing their king. When Ape comes out and angrily scolds Shep for chewing his violin stick and says he's been a "Bad Dog" and Shep lowers his head in shame and then pees on the tree, causing all the other gorillas to flee.

During the climax of the film, Shep sees that George has returned and is scuffling with Max and Thor and he, [[Tookie Tookie]] and a little monkey George and Ursula met earlier in the film help him out. First Sheep launches Tookie from his trunk into the back of Thor's pants. Then Shep begins to shoots coconuts at the poaches (with a few accidentally hitting George and Ape). As Shep and the little monkey high-five, Max is about to shoot him when Ursula swings and and knocks him down and Ape knocks him out with a coconut. Then just before George goes to rescue Ursula from Lyle, George has Shep peep on the two poachers and a team of mercenaries who Lyle had brought with him.

George and Ursula's wedding where he and everyone else is celebrating and Shep enjoys a bottle of champagne alongside [[Mr. Kwame]], Shep is last scene carrying George and Ursula off on their honeymoon with the words "Just Married" painted on his butt. 

===''[[George of the Jungle 2]]''===
Shep returns in the sequel, where he is first scene running across a clearing with George and [[George Jr.|his son]], where he suggests playing fetch with Shep. But when George throws Shep the stick, Shep just looks at the stick and then scratches behind his ear.

Shep isn't seen again until the middle of the movie where Tookie has been locked up by the Mean Lion and asks Shep to open the cage, Shep succeeds, but opens it by sitting on it. When George and his family return to Africa, George whistles for Shep to bring them back to the jungle and Shep (wearing new-balance sneakers) comes running up to George and is so happy to see him he licks his face with excitement and carries everyone back home.

During the climax, Shep and a few other allies join George in stopping a team of bulldozers that are about to destroy the jungle. First Shep helps the team by launching coconuts from a tree like a slingshot, then he tries to ram one of the bulldozers, only to knock himself out. Shep's final scene is during the ceremony where George and Ursula renew their wedding vows to each other.

==Trivia==
*He is an animal who acts like a dog despite of not being it, like [[Pegasus]] from ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]'' and [[Sven]] from ''[[Frozen]]''.
*In some scenes, he was actually portrayed by a female elephant named Tai during the scene where she is seen being by [[George of the Jungle (character)|George]] and [[Ursula Stanhope|Ursula]].
*In the original cartoon, Shep was a lot clumsier and many people, including Ape and Ursula, would continuously try to convince George that he was in fact an elephant and not a dog.
