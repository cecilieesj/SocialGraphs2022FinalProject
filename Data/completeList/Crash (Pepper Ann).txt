'''Crash''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the best friend of [[Moose Pearson]] and an occasional, though unintentional, nuisance to her sister [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]].

==Background==
Crash is [[Moose Pearson|Moose]]'s worrisome friend who likes to go skateboarding with her. Right from the get go, nobody seems to pay much attention to him, other than that he hangs out with Moose. As a matter of fact, everyone continues to forget his rather simple name and will call him different names that rhyme with Crash (i.e. Trash, Flash, etc.). In "[[A 'Tween Halloween]]", he attempted to wear a shirt that read 'My Name is Crash' on it, but this did nothing to stop [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] to continue to mispronounce his name.

In "[[Mash into Me]]", Crash is revealed to be a fan of the comic ''Genetic Dozen''. Upon seeing that the character Regenica, looked like Pepper Ann, he became incredibly obsessed with her and tried to win her love through a variety of romantic, yet annoying declarations. He eventually lost interest in her when first, she yells at him and tells him to stop following her and second, when he notices that Regenica's ally Machina Girl looked like [[Nicky Little]].

Crash continued to make occasional appearances, usually to act as a companion to Moose.

===Personality===
Crash is constantly worrying about something, usually for his own safety. He tends to panic easily and apparently lacks any confidence to the point that he cries easily. As the series went on, he became less of a worrywart and more of a socially awkward dork who nevertheless has passion for the things that he does. By his last appearance in "[[The Merry Lives of Pepper Ann]]", he had matured into a very calm, yet easily annoyed individual.

===Physical appearance===
Crash is a small Caucasian boy with an oval shaped head who usually wears a yellow helmet with an orange chin strap that he never removes. Based on the lack of hair seen, it is possible that he is bald. He wears orange skater gloves, a big yellow shirt, blue shorts and blue sneakers.

==Trivia==
*Crash's real name is never said aloud.
*Much like how Moose is a girl with boyish traits, Crash is a boy with somewhat effeminate traits.
