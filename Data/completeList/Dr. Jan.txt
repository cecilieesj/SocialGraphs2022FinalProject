'''Dr. Jan''' is a supporting character in the [[2019]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Dr. Jan is very devoted to her research, she is capable of giving good advice and she is an adamant admirer of all things supernatural.

===Physical appearance===
Dr. Jan is a medium height woman of African American descent with brown skin and wavy black hair tied in a ponytail. She wears square red glasses, a yellow polo shirt with dinosaur bones on it, brown pants, a black belt with a silver buckle, UFO-shaped earrings, a black lanyard that holds her ID, and purple grey boots. She usually also wears yellowish white gloves.

==Role in series==
During [[Anne Boonchuy]] and the Plantar family’s trip the museum Dr. Jan approached them when she saw they were interested in a mysterious vase, but a paranoid Anne warded her off. That night, she would encounter them again during their fight with the [[Cloak-Bot]]. She became obsessed with the talking frogs after seeing them without their disguises. Dr. Jan distracted the guards so they could escape. After hearing their story, Dr. Jan offers to help them in their quest; she also gives Anne some sound advice, by telling her that while she understands her desire to help her friends get back to their world, but she still needs to take a break once in a while and sends her home for some much needed rest. After doing some research on the vase, she discovers a hidden message and gives it to Anne the very next day at the Thai Temple, which reads "Seek the Mother of Olms, she will guide you to your destiny".

In "[[If You Give a Frog a Cookie]]," Dr. Jan called Anne and informed her she found a scientist named [[Dr. Frakes]] who was studying gateways to other dimensions. However, Dr. Jan warned Anne of Dr. Frakes being considered crazy within the science community and she should wait on meeting with Dr. Frakes. Unfortunately, the Plantars' homesickness caused Anne and them to go meet with Dr. Frakes and her assistant, [[Terri (Amphibia)|Terri]] where the Plantars nearly got dissected until they were saved by Anne and Terri.

In "[[Froggy Little Christmas]]," Dr. Jan was visited by Anne and the Plantars came by where she allowed Anne to take some of the exhibits to be part of the Thai Go Float, she was making for the Christmas-Palooza Parade. At the same time, Dr. Jan explained the history of Christmas to the Plantars, which overwhelms them until she is interrupted when seeing some kids fooling with a T-Rex Skeleton.

In "[[Escape to Amphibia]]", Dr. Jan and Terri have built a portal to help Anne and the Plantars get back to Amphibia, she used her car to help power up, the Terri had to shut it down as it needed more power. She then has a short talk with Anne before heading to get more supplies to powerup the Portal. When [[Mr. X (character)|Mr. X]] and the FBI captured the Plantars, Anne and her parents rally their friends: [[Ally and Jess]], [[Molly Jo]], [[Humphrey Westwood]], and two women from the Thai Community to rescue the Plantars, Dr. Jan and Terri join too. While the group went inside the base, Terri and Dr. Jan stole the base's generator which cut off the power, allowing Anne, her Parents, and their friends to rescue the Plantars and escape. They return to the Warehouse and use the base's generator to powerup the porta, but it still wasn't enough.

Mr. X and the FBI arrived captured until Anne tap into her Calamity Powers, blew Mr. X and the FBI and then used her powers to power up the Portal. Anne then summons a giant Praying Mantis to keep the FBI busy while Anne and the Plantars escape through it. Jenny, Mr. X's assistant and an FBI Agent managed to subdue the Mantis but end up destroying the portal.

In "[[All In (Amphibia)|All In]]", during the invasion, Dr. Jan and Terri were rescuing citizens while Dr. Jan knock down some [[Frobots]] while driving her van. She and Terri are later seen with Humphrey, Molly Jo, Ally and Jesse as they watch Anne's battle [[King Andrias]]. She then cheers along with them after Anne defeated Andrias.

*She is very similar to [[Marcy Wu]] in terms of intelligence, interests, and enthusiasm.
*Dr. Jan's voice actress, Anika Noni Rose, is also known as the voice of [[Tiana]] in ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', another Disney production about frogs.
** Coincidentally, like ''Amphibia'', ''The Princess and the Frog'' also features [[King Andrias|an]] [[Dr. Facilier|antagonist]] voiced by [[Keith David]].
*Like Mr. and Mrs. Boonchuy, she knows Anne and the Plantars’s secret and becomes their ally, being the first non-Boonchuy to do so.
