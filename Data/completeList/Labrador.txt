The '''Labrador''' is a minor character from the film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===
He is first mentioned by the [[Collie]] at the dairy farm, where he comments that the Labrador's human is a grocer in Dinsford. After the Dalmatian family arrives in the village, they are greeted by the Labrador who informs them about his owner having a truck that will take them to [[London]] as soon as it gets its engine repaired. But soon the three dogs notice that [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]], [[Jasper and Horace|Horace, and Jasper]] are at the village. After seeing [[Patch]] and [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] covered in soot from a nearby fireplace, [[Pongo]] gets the idea of covering themselves in soot to disguise themselves as labradors. The Labrador says that's a good idea. After all the [[Dalmatian puppies|puppies]] are covered in soot, the Labrador helps Pongo and [[Perdita]] escort the puppies to the truck in groups. As soon as the truck is fixed and starts leaving, the dalmatians' cover is blown due to dripping icicles washing away the soot in front of Cruella. She then orders her minions to go after the puppies. The Labrador attacks Jasper and Horace, giving Pongo and Lucky enough time to get in the truck with Perdita and the rest of the puppies. He isn't seen or even heard of again for the rest of the film.
