'''Connie Moreau''' is a hockey player from Minneapolis, [[Minnesota]]. She plays Forward position and wears number 18. She is the recurring, independent female team player of the Ducks and is extremely proud of it. Connie is married to [[Guy Germaine]].

==Biography==
In the first movie, Averman refers to her as "the velvet hammer." She is the first to kindly welcome Coach Bombay to the group and asks if he plays hockey or skates nowadays, to which he coldly replies no. When the team invades Bombay's limo, she declares that she feels like Madonna sitting in it. She is close to [[Guy Germaine]] and is often shown holding hands with him, implying that they are dating. Later, when the team is upset with Coach Bombay, Charlie is ostracized in class for sticking up for Bombay and the others start to push him around. Connie stands up for him and it leads to the entire team arguing amongst themselves, thus landing them in detention for 'quacking at the principal'.

She suggested to Coach Bombay that [[Guy Germaine]] take the penalty shot against the Hawks before Bombay settles on Charlie to finish the game. After the Ducks won the game, Connie and Guy did a victory kiss.

In ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks|D2]]'', Connie is about to accept a kiss from Guy on a platform with a waterfall backdrop when Charlie skates in to tell them that "Quack attack is back!", thus making her excited and quickly joining the group to help round up the others. Like Charlie, she is fiercely loyal to the team and works hard to help them win. When the team was introduced to the new Ducks, she takes an interest in [[Luis Mendoza]], commenting that he was a "good-looking skater." This resulted in [[Guy Germaine]] elbowing [[Lester Averman]] in disgust for agreeing with Connie, indicating [[Guy Germaine]]'s jealousy. She attempted to score a goal in the second match against [[Iceland]], but a bigger male player knocked her against the rink wall. When she regains control of the puck, it becomes wedged against the edge of the rink wall and [[Dwayne Robertson]] lassoes the Iceland player before he can crush Connie against the wall again. She thanks [[Dwayne Robertson|Dwayne]] for his act and states that "I'm no lady, I'm a duck!' before shoving the Iceland player to the ice. When the team wins over Iceland, she hugs [[Luis Mendoza]], but in the credits she holds hands with [[Guy Germaine|Guy]]. Connie was part of the [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)]]. She later attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''. She is portrayed by Marguerite Moreau.

After D3, Connie married Guy and became a Minnesota State senator. She and Guy have three kids, which Guy describes as feeling like "seven". Connie sent an invitation to Bombay for their wedding, but Bombay never attended due to the struggles in life he was having. When she re-united with Bombay and the other Ducks at Twin City Slice, she was put off by Gordon's dismissive attitude about them and the Mighty Ducks. However, when [[Evan Morrow]] revealed to Connie and the others that Gordon was not invited to the gala, she and the other Ducks picked him up in a limo (which they drove onto the Ice Palace's ice) and took him to the gala. Once there, the old Ducks stopped a speech by Stephanie about [[Coach T]] to tell the crowd that the true recipient of the award should be Gordon Bombay. Notably, Connie mentioned that while the original Ducks did not have the best start, Bombay made them champions by teaching them that hockey wasn't just about winning and losing, but about the heart and the team. She then threw shade at [[Coach T]] before ending her speech with "Ducks Fly Together!"

The next day, Connie joined the other Ducks in playing with the Don't Bothers at the Ice Palace. She is seen giving checking instructions to [[Lauren Gibby|Lauren]] and [[Maya Kasper|Maya]].

==Playing Style==
Connie adds a feminine grace to the Ducks offense. She is an efficient skater and a good puck handler. Her more graceful skating maneuvers often throw off defenses, which enables her to weave around them. Despite her offensive prowess, her small size and weight make her vulnerable in defensive situations.

==Trivia==
*Her last name is the same as her portrayer.
*Connie was the only female player on the ducks until [[Tammy Duncan]] and [[Julie Gaffney]].
*Connie reappears in ''[[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]]''.
*One of Connie's children is named after Gordon Bombay.
*Not once in ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'' or ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]'' do we see a scene just with Connie Moreau and [[Julie Gaffney]].
