'''Troggles''' are minor villains from the animated series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==History==
The Troggles are servants, or rather minions to [[Lady Bane]].

Little is known about the jackal-like creatures dressed in nobility servant's attire, except that they are a little smarter than [[Ogres]], and have a habit of repeating words spoken by other people, particularly commands.

While their gender goes undefined, in the episode "[[Tummi Trouble]]" they wear female attire, such as hula skirts with coconut bras for Lady Bane's bachelorette party, and bridesmaid's gowns for the wedding ceremony.

*"[[A Gummi is a Gummi's Best Friend]]"
*"[[Patchwork Gummi]]"
*"[[Tummi Trouble]]" (female attire for wedding)
