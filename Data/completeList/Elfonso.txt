==Background==
===Personality===
Elfonso is a very playful elf who loves to have fun. However, this can also make him irresponsible and more of a hindrance than a help during a crisis.

==Role in the Series==
Elfonso first appears after Sofia and Clover arrive in Elvenmoor. After showing them around a bit and Clover gets himself a forever carrot, he takes them to the Silverspray Stream. Suddenly, another elf named Elfred comes by, and after a ride down the stream, informs them that Sofia's father is going to cut down the tree and that if he does she'll be trapped in Elvenmoor forever. He then directs the trio down the green path and tells them to stay on the path. They find the door, but Elfonso and Clover keep getting distracted by the merriment of Elvenmoor. Elfonso pulls himself together and helps them get to the door in time to save the tree.
