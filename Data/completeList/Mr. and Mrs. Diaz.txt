==Background==
===Personalities===
Both Rafael and Angie sport a cheerful demeanor, and tend to look on the bright side of things, which often bothers their son. Also, as seen several times in the show, they are quite loving and affectionate with each other. However, aside from being so cheerful all the time, they can also be protective of their loved ones.

Rafael is always cheerful, combined with his child-like personality. He is shown to be rather artistic, as he can sculpt a huge statue of star and speed-paint in the place of taking pictures while vacationing. Rafael is openly affectionate and constantly dotes on both his family and Star. While Angie is equally Bright and cheerful like her husband, she is demonstrably more mature than Rafael, and usually serves as Marco's true parental guidance.

===Physical appearances===
Rafael is a tall, well-built man of Hispanic descent with tan skin, short brown hair, brown eyes, a small mustache and visible chest and arm hair. He is usually seen wearing a yellow vacation polo shirt, grey pants and white soft shoes.

Angie is a woman of average height with lighter skin, long brown hair with a magenta knot, green eyes and pink lipstick. She wears a peach colored long sleeve shirt, a long olive green skirt and brown sandals. When she was pregnant, she wore a light green dress and dark green leggings.

==Roles in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]]==
===Season One===
At the beginning of the series, Rafael and Angie are the adorably happy parents of [[Marco Diaz]]. They open their house to [[Star Butterfly]], partially because they have had a history of inviting foreign exchange students to live with them as revealed in "[[The Other Exchange Student]]", but also because they find Star very pleasant to be around and do not mind her strange and wacky adventures. In "[[Diaz Family Vacation]]", they are invited by Star to go to [[Mewni]] for their anniversary; completely oblivious to the fact that it was a last minute gift from Star and to all the dangers that Mewni presents to them. In "[[Storm the Castle]]", Rafael and Angie miss the fact that Marco was kidnapped by [[Toffee]], but have faith in Star going to rescue him. Later, they are escorted by Mewni's guards, while wearing heavy armor, to go and retrieve their son; surprisingly enjoying the experience.

===Season Two===
Rafael and Angie continue their happy-go-lucky ways while Star and Marco go on adventures together. In "[[Hungry Larry]]", Rafael is faced with the prospect that he is not scary anymore when it comes to Halloween. This changes when Angie, Marco, Star, [[Janna Ordonia]] and numerous other trick-or-treaters are eaten by Hungry Larry. Angered at seeing everyone in danger, Rafael defeats Hungry Larry and rescues everyone. Rafael and Angie's stern side is showcased in "[[Heinous]]" when [[Meteora Butterfly|Miss Heinous]] arrives and demands that Marco be held accountable for ruining her life and [[St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses]]. To get her to leave, they, possibly for the first time, actually issue a punishment for Marco, which Heinous accepts before leaving. In "[[Starcrushed]]", the Diazes hold an end of the school year party at their house where Rafael deduces that Marco has mixed feelings about Star and tries to give him fatherly advice. It is presumed that they hear Star's declaration of love to Marco.

===Season Three===
In "[[The Battle for Mewni]]", Rafael and Angie try to cheer up Marco over Star leaving, possibly for good, though he later goes to join her in defeating Toffee. Later in "[[Sophomore Slump]]", when Marco decides to become a foreign exchange student on Mewni, his parents are there to see him off. In "[[Marco Jr.]]", it is revealed that Angie became pregnant during Marco's stay in Mewni as he and Star return to see how they are doing. It quickly becomes apparent that Rafael and Angie do not know much about their son due to his many adventures. This results in Marco promising to be more in touch in them and his soon-to-be younger "brother".

===Season Four===
In "[[Doop-Doop]]", Angie gives birth to a daughter whom they name [[Mariposa Diaz|Mariposa]] after Star Butterfly (Mariposa means Butterfly). They continue to make minor appearance in "[[Beach Day]]" and "[[Sad Teen Hotline]]", the latter of which had Rafael trying to calm Star and [[Tom Lucitor]]'s recent breakup, only for him to get emotional. They make a final appearance, along with Mariposa, in "[[Cleaved]]" where they check on Marco after his return from the Magic Realm.

==Trivia==
*In the book, ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', they first met at a café in Cleveland, Ohio. And they are usually found cuddling on the couch together.
*According to [[Daron Nefcy]], Angie's name is short for Angelica.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://starvstheforcesofevil.wikia.com/wiki/Angie_Diaz#cite_note-firstname-0|title=Ubaldo G. Chávez P. post|website=Twitter|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}</ref>
