'''Fred Lizard''' is a member of the Riverbottom Gang and plays the drums in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Riverbottom_Nightmare_Band Riverbottom Nightmare Band] in the 1977 special ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Emmet_Otter%27s_Jug-Band_Christmas Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas]''. He was performed by [[w:c:muppet:Richard Hunt|Richard Hunt]]. He was the most civilized of the gang; he would clean up after himself after making a mistake.

The character's name was not mentioned in the original special; it has been used in the 2008 Goodspeed Opera House's [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Emmet_Otter%27s_Jug-Band_Christmas_(stage_show) stage adaptation].

The lizard puppet reappeared in episodes [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_403:_Shields_%26_Yarnell 403] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_404:_Dyan_Cannon 404] of ''The Muppet Show''.

On stage, the role of Fred was played as both a [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Hand-Rod_Muppet hand-rod puppet] and a live actor, and was originated by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Colin_Hanlon Colin Hanlon].

==Trivia==
*The puppet's scaly skin was made from drops of hot glue that were then painted green. The same technique was applied for [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Howard_Snake Snake's] skin.
