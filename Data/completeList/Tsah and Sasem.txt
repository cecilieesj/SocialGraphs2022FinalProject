==Background==
Tsah and Sasem are kind and curious and nervous. However, when it comes to [[Beshte]]'s bad reputation, they take the blame on the hippo for the wave he accidentally caused in their pond. When Beshte saves [[Pinguino]]'s life, the two clear out his bad reputation with the problem solved.

==Role in the series==
==="[[Poa the Destroyer]]"===
When [[Beshte]] arrives at the pond area and sees shrews, Tsah and Sasem notice him walking across. Just as the hippo decides to get a closer look, not noticing he is causing a small wave that catches the shrews, Tsah and Sasem, however, become enraged about Beshte and decide to report Beshte to [[Baliyo]] about his bad reputation.

When Beshte arrives back at the shrews' pond, Beshte tries to talk to Tsah and Sasem again but they refuse to talk, thinking he is a nuisance to the tundra animals. Later, Tsah, Sasem, and the other tundra animals are gathered to reconcile with Beshte just as he saves Pinguino from a gruesome demise, apologizing for being rude to him. With Beshte's bad reputation dealt, Tsah and Sasem join in the celebration.

==="[[Long Live the Queen]]"===
Tsah and Sasem are one of the animals outside the Tree of Life worried about Queen [[Janna]] completing her journey through the Circle of Life. Just as [[Kion]] and the [[Night Pride]] enter the Tree of Life to visit Janna one last time before she passes away, Janna suddenly completes her journey through the Circle of Life; [[Makini]] reports the sad news to the animals outside, causing Tsah, Sasem, and all the animals to react in shock. It is possible that the shrews even attended the queen's funeral. Later, when [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] is crowned as the new queen of the Tree of Life, Tsah, Sasem, and the other animals of the Tree of Life attend her coronation.

==="[[Return to the Pride Lands]]"===
Tsah and Sasem are present alongside the other animals of the Tree of Life, and the animals of the Pride Lands, attending Kion and Rani's wedding.

==Trivia==
*"Tsah" means "needle" in Navajo language.
