=== ''[[John Carter (film)|John Carter (2012)]]'' ===
The day that [[John Carter (character)|John Carter]] arrived on Barsoom, Dejah was on the verge of discovering the Ninth Ray, a power that could permanently shift the balance of power between her nation Helium and their enemy Zodanga. But her research was sabotaged by a Thern, a god-like species that meddles in civilzations. The Therns knew of Dejah's work, and that it could bring peace and prosperity back to Mars. At the same time, the Therns conspired with the prince of Zodanga, [[Sab Than]], to assassinate Dejah during a fake wedding and conquer Helium.

However, Dejah escaped Helium, Sab and the Thern's. It was then that she met [[John Carter (character)|John Carter]], a human from the planet Earth and her future husband. Deja managed to convince John Carter to the fight to save Helium.

* In the original ''Barsoom'' novels, Dejah Thoris is the granddaughter of Tardos Mors, not his daughter like in the 2012 film. Her father in the novels in Tardos Mors' son, Mors Kajak.
