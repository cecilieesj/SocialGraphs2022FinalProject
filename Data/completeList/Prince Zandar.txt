'''Prince Zandar''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Sofia the First]]''. He is the Prince of the desert Kingdom of [[Tangu]] and shown to be a close friend to [[Prince James]].

==Trivia==
*Given his appearance, Zandar may be a Prince from one of the Seven Deserts mentioned in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]].
*Prince Zandar, being a best friend of James, is near him when he is not near Hildegard. They worked on their dragon costume and castle project together, for instance.
*He appears to share James's obsession with cannons and explosions, as the castle they built for their project was basically a huge cannon.
*Although Elephants are traditionally native to Africa, the Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia, he is shown to have a pet elephant, which is not native to the Middle East where Tangu appears to be located. However, it is possible that his parents imported the elephants from a neighboring kingdom.
*Zandar has almost never been seen without his turban, the sole exception being in the episode "[[Baileywick's Day Off]]" when he wears a red bandana. He even wears his turban over his hockey helmet as shown in "[[Lord of the Rink]]".
