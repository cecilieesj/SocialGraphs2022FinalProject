The children demand answers and Uncle Rolland tells them to go get info from the talking books in the Library as well as retrieving the first piece to retrieving the Coffin Clock. The Keeps learn of the evil Society and their desire to collect magical artifacts and the Wardens job to keep these magical items safe. Max and Melody are attacked by Dusk. Just as the situation looks dire, the Dusk are attacked by the monsters that kidnapped their parents. They escape on the object that Rolland sent them to collect, the Living Chair. It is part of a set that when brought together summons the Coffin Clock. They rest and recuperate, eager to find the second piece of the set, when they are stopped by the Dusks and green spirits calling themselves the true Wardens.
