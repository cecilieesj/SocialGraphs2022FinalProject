'''Milly''' is a supporting deuteragonist of the animated TV series, ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. She is one of the [[Fireside Girls]] in [[Danville]] and is a member of Troop 46231. She is voiced by [[Isabella Murad]].
==Biography==
She, [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]], [[Gretchen]], and [[Adyson Sweetwater]] were the background singers for Phineas and the Ferb-Tones as the Ferbettes (“[[Flop Starz]]”, “[[Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown]]”). She promoted the Brawl at the Mall by passing out fliers (“[[Raging Bully]]”). She, along with [[Ginger Hirano]], [[Holly]], and [[Katie]], help [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] create S’winter (“[[S'Winter]]”). Another time, she and [[Adyson Sweetwater]] were trying to explain the T.V. concept to [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella’s]] pet dog, [[Pinky]] (“[[Interview With a Platypus]]”).     

==Appearance==
Milly has curly brown hair, blue eyes with a twitch, freckles, and has a yellow bow (not always completely visible). Her uniform has a red collar, red circular pattern on the sleeves and the bottom, and black Mary Jane shoes, but when it's winter, she wears an orange sweater with a bell, leggings under her skirt, orange boots with white trim and a red Santa hat. She also appears to be somewhat plump, as she is the heaviest Fireside Girl.
