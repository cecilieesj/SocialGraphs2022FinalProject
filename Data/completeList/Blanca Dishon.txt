She is very interested in finding the next Flawless Girl and despairs that she might not do so. Her strict requirements are that candidates must be at least 5 foot 10 inches. She appears only to choose the new Flawless Girl by height, because it sets a standard for beauty unobtainable by the average woman ("[[Attack of the 50 Foot Sister]]").
==Trivia==
*Her strongest personality traits are that she only cares about fame, glory, and of course, money.

*She tried to make [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] the year's Flawless Girl, despite her being 50 feet tall.
