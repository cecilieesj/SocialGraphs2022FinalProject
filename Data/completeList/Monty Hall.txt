*Hall had previously co-produced and hosted his most noted game show, ''Let's Make A Deal'', which aired on [[ABC]] in daytime from 1968 to 1976; a primetime version ran concurrently from 1969 to 1971, and was replaced by a weekly syndicated edition that ran from 1971 to 1977 (which was initially distributed by ABC's in-house distribution firm ABC Films, until it was spun-off as Worldvision Enterprises due to FCC regulations). Another version of the show, which aired on [[NBC]] in 1990, was produced by Dick Clark and Ron Greenberg (who had co-produced the syndicated game ''The Challengers'' for [[Buena Vista Television]] in the 1990-91 season) and taped at the [[Disney-MGM Studios]], had Hall take over as a "temporary guest host" after bad ratings with initial host Bob Hilton; Hall planned to do on-air auditions to select a permanent host, but NBC cancelled it in January of 1991 to bring back ''Wheel of Fortune ''(which had moved to [[CBS]] in 1989). He also co-produced another ABC game show, ''SplitSecond'', from 1972 to 1975 (hosted by Tom Kennedy); he hosted a syndicated revival from 1986 to 1987.
