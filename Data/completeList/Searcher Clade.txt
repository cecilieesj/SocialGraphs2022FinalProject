{{Quote|I'm not an explorer. I'm a farmer.|Searcher Clade}}
'''Searcher Clade''' is the main protagonist from Disney's upcoming 2022 animated film, ''[[Strange World]]''.

==Background==
===Official Description===
{{Quote|Searcher Clade is a treasured member of the Avalonia community having discovered a revolutionary plant-based power source called pando. These days, he farms the plant, providing energy to the entire community. Above all though, Searcher is a family man: he loves a spontaneous middle-of-the-kitchen dance with his wife, Meridian, and he vowed long ago that he would do anything for his son, Ethan. Searcher has worked hard to create a solid and secure life for his family, so when he finds himself out of his element on an unpredictable mission, his cool confidence escapes him... Searcher is caught between the legacy of the greatest explorer of all time and his own legacy he established almost in contrast to that of his father, who he sees as a rambling, intrepid explorer who was never home... Searcher set out to be the opposite. Heâ€™s rooted in his family.|Don Hall describing Searcher<ref>[https://whatsondisneyplus.com/strange-world-inside-scoop-on-the-characters-environments/ Strange World: Inside Scoop On The Characters & Environments]</ref>}}

==Trivia==
*''Strange World'' was originally titled ''Searcher Clade'' after him, but it was changed.
