}}'''Sasha''' is one of the main protagonists from [[Walt Disney]]'s [[1946]] short ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', a segment of the feature film ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Sasha is an overly-excited bird who is forgetful at times. He helps [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]] in his wolf hunt and is a close friend to [[Sonia]]. However, when the [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] supposedly eats Sonia, Sasha mourns but then seeks revenge by trying to fight the wolf himself.

==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
Sasha first appears when he comes out of his birdhouse and greets Peter who is going out to hunt the wolf with his popgun. He then eagerly decides to tag along. He soon gets ambushed by [[Ivan]] who tries to eat him, but Peter manages to stop Ivan in time. Sasha later witnesses Sonia supposedly getting eaten by the wolf and mourns with the rest of the gang. Seeking revenge, he takes on the wolf himself but accidentally bumps into a tree after gloating overconfidently. However, Peter and Ivan manage to rescue him from the wolf, and he later goes to some [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir|hunters]] for help. He takes Sonia's supposed death the hardest, though he is overjoyed to find her alive at the end of the segment, and they go off to see the victory parade.
