'''Dr. Kon Chunosuke''' is a character from the [[Jungle Cruise]].

== History ==
Dr. Kon Chunosuke was a Japanese entomologist during the 1930s who became a member of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]].  In [[1938]] he became acquainted with one [[Alberta Falls]], the president of the [[Jungle Navigation Company]] and granddaughter of his fellow S.E.A. member [[Albert Falls|Dr. Albert Falls]] who went missing years prior.  Due to recognizing the S.E.A. logo on his equipment, Alberta invited the scientist to join her on a V.I.P. Jungle Cruise excursion.  This excursion turned sour however due to the boat having been crashed by JNC skipper [[Felix Pechman XIII]].  The party became stranded in the African veldt of the Nile river where they were chased up a pole by a rhinoceros.

=== Development history ===
Kon Chunosuke was integrated into the Jungle Cruise's 2021 refurbishment as part of its new storyline, being part of the reimagined, "Trapped Safari" which was removed due to its perceived racist undertones.

== Disney Parks ==

=== [[Club 33]] ===
A ticket in the menu for Tiki Takeover referenced Kon as using "[[Plane Crazy|Plane Crazy Airlines]]" in [[1975]].

=== Jungle Cruise ===
Kon is to appear atop the pole in the African Veldt of this attraction.

== Trivia ==

* It is possible that Dr. Kon takes his name from Chunosuke Matsuyama, an 18th century Japanese castaway from real-life.
*In the queue for the Jungle Cruise is a crate of books addressed to Kon from [[Mystic Point]].
