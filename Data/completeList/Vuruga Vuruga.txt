|quote ="Usually the royals are always so stuffy at these things. But this, this is most impressive!

She makes her debut in the episode, "[[Baboons!]]"

== Personality ==
Vuruga Vuruga is very kindhearted and polite. She is gracious to [[Kiara]] when the young princess presides over a buffalo ceremony and is also very understanding.

== History ==

==== Baboons! ====
[[Simba]] and [[Nala]] task their daughter, Kiara, with presiding over the Royal Buffalo Wallow for Vuruga Vuruga's herd of buffalo. After a mishap with the floodwaters, the young princess appears drenched in mud and water and greets Vuruga Vuruga with a bow. Vuruga Vuruga bows respectfully to Kiara and appears pleased by her presence. She praises Kiara's appearance, mentioning that royals tend to be very stuffy at these events and that Kiara must clearly understand what the event is all about, adding that she is very impressed.

Hearing the unexpected praise over her appearance, Kiara gives credit to her friends, Tiifu and Zuri, who always insist that she looks her best for important events such as these. Vuruga Vuruga smiles kindly towards them, making Tiifu and Zuri feel pleased that they could help their friend after all. Kiara then steps forward and announces the start of the Wallow, and Vuruga Vuruga stands at Kiara's side, watching as her herd participates in the important event.

==== [[The Savannah Summit]] ====
After Simba invites Makuu to the summit, Vuruga Vuruga and Twiga are nervous and wondering why he came. They plan a pilot to teach Makuu a lesson but when everyone else hears about it. Makuu steps up and gives a speech he becomes friends with everyone at the summit.

==== [[The Traveling Baboon Show]] ====

==== [[The Ukumbusho Tradition]] ====
When the bees ruin the show the elephants go all crazy. Fuli goes to warn Vuruga Vuruga's herd, but they don't think it's her because of her costume. Fuli decides to scare off the herd.

==== [[The Golden Zebra]] ====
When a drought hits the Pride Lands, Vuruga Vuruga argues with Twiga's herd over who should have the next drink, worried that they'll miss out entirely. Kion tries to calm them but is ultimately forced to seek advice from his father regarding the situation.

Later, having found a solution, the Lion Guard leads the herds through the Back Lands where they are introduced to Dhahabu the golden zebra, who welcomes them into the Watering Hole, on the condition that they frolic and romp. Vuruga Vuruga happily accepts her proposal and enjoys the water.

Vuruga Vuruga didn't like Makuu at all let alone trust him at first afterall the things he and his crocodiles have done in the past. She was visibly shocked along with everyone else when she discovers that Makuu was invited to the Summit too. So along the way to to Mizimu Grove she and Twiga thought of a plan that would teach him a lesson by making fall into a pit of rotten fruit. Though later at sunset, when Kion convincingly tells the other leaders that Makuu fell into a pit and completed his journey through the circle of life, leaving her and everyone in great shock. She and Twiga confess to the act, claiming that they only wanted to make him smell bad. But to hers and everyone else's surprise, Makuu appears, angry at their lack of trust. Vuruga Vuruga and Twiga are worried that he is mad, but instead, Makuu applauds their trick, stating that it was a plan worthy of a crocodile. With Vuruga Vuruga seeing Makuu in a new light, she offered to let Makuu and his float sleep near her herd's mud wallow.

However, not recognizing the fastest member of the Lion Guard, Vuruga Vuruga refuses, angered by her intrusion. Even though Fuli tries to confirm that it's her, Vuruga Vuruga still refuses, even after being warned of an incoming elephant herd.
