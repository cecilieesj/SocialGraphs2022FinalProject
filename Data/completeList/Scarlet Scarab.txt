'''Scarlet Scarab''' (real name '''Layla El-Faouly''') is a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character that appears in ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]''. She is [[Moon Knight]]'s best friend and wife, helping him fight [[Arthur Harrow]] and [[Ammit]]. Layla is kind, gentle, and friendly. Through the power of the Goddess Taweret, she becomes an Egyptian based superhero.

==Trivia==
*The character is loosely based on '''Marlene Alraune''', created by Doug Moench and Don Perlin. The reason for the change was because the writers wanted a closer connection to the Egyptian themes. She is also combined with the character Mehemet Faoul, who was the superhero known as Scarlet Scarab, created by Moench and Alan Kupperberg. Early drafts had the character named '''Zayna Faoul'''.
