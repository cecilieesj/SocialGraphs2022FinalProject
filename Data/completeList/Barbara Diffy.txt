She is very interested in how things work in this century. Unlike other mothers, though, she seems to let her kids figure things out on their own. She loves to cook the old fashioned wayâ€”however, her food usually turns out a mess, because in 2121 they spray food out of a can, thus she has no cooking experience. Her maiden name is revealed in "[[Not-So-Great Great Great Grandpa]]". She is two years younger than Lloyd, and kind, loving, and very intelligent.
