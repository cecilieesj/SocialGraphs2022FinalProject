'''Chelsea Brimmer''' (Brittany Curran) is a minor character seen in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]''. Though she only appears in a few episodes, she is shown to be a wealthy friend of [[London Tipton]]'s.

==Background==
===Personality===
More so than London, Chelsea is incredibly superficial and values appearance and wealth over everything else. Because of this, she buys posh items and loves to shop with her wealthy friends. She has had multiple nose jobs and refuses to drive her own car because bugs can get into the windshield.

===Appearance===
Chelsea, being wealthy, is much like London, her outfits are all designer. She has dark brown, curly hair and fair skin, her eyes are brown. Chelsea has a slim physique and often wears mini skirts. Her clothing is both similar and different from London's own.

==Story==
Chelsea is first seen in "[[Miniature Golf]]" where she participates in London's book club, but like the other girls, is more interested in chatting about her luxurious life than actually reading the book.

Chelsea appears next in "[[Who's the Boss?]]", where she hangs out with London on several occasions, while London tries to fix up [[Lance Fishman|Lance]] to presentable at a posh formal ball. He manages to woo Chelsea at the ball, by wearing a tuxedo and combing his hair and sweet-talking her.

In "[[Tiptonline]]", Chelsea appears as a guest on London's ''Yay Me!'' webshow, and later becomes a producer after [[Cody Martin|Cody]] quits.
Chelsea appears in the ''The Suite Life on Deck'' episode "[[Flowers and Chocolate]]", where she visits London on the ''[[S.S. Tipton]]'', assuming that London is still living a wealthy fashionable life with servants and other luxuries. She later discovers that London is actually attending school there, and eventually decides not to tell anyone back home about this.

==Trivia==
*In the co-star credits at the end of "Tiptonline", Chelsea's name is misspelled as "Chelsa".
*Her father is in prison for tax evasion.
*Her zodiac sign is Pisces.
