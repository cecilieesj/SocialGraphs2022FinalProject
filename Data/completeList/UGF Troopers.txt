|status = Active}}The '''UGF Troopers''' (also known as the '''Intergalactic Police''' or '''Prison Guards''') are minor characters from the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]]. They are alien [[Velociraptor]]-like guards who function as the backbone of the United Galactic Federation and serve as both the guards for captains of spacecraft and for those arrested or imprisoned. The guards' species is called ''Raptorsellus'', and they are known to be very temperamental when confronted or in battle.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''===
In the original movie, Experiment 626 (later known as [[Stitch]]) was turned over to the UGF Troopers for custody. One guard then used a [[Sample Extractor]] to take a sample of Stitch's blood, then inserted the syringe into a machine that analyzed the blood's DNA, allowing for two [[Plasma Blaster|plasma blasters]] on the ceiling to track Stitch's genetic signature and fire at him should he escape. However, Stitch quickly exploited a weakness in the tracking just shortly thereafter and used it to escape. Near the end of the film, a large group of prison guards were seen surrounding Stitch after he was apprehended and turned over to the [[Grand Councilwoman]], though he was later released from custody.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''===
In a flashback scene of ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'', [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was in his [[Galaxy Defense Industries|laboratory]], where he had just finished creating Stitch and attempted to fully charge his molecules in order to prevent him from short-circuiting and dying. However, three UGF Troopers burst into the lab and apprehended Jumba for illegal [[Experiments|experiment]] creation, thereby disrupting the process. This caused Jumba to call the guards idiots before they dragged him away.

===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===
In ''Stitch! The Movie'', two UGF Troopers were seen apprehending [[Dr. Hämsterviel]] after he had been successfully captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], Stitch, and Experiment 221 (recently known as [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]]).

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
In "[[Finder (episode)|Finder]]", several UGF Troopers were seen hunting down Hämsterviel after he had escaped from [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]], although he managed to evade them. Near the end of the episode, two guards were seen arresting Hämsterviel again after he had been captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]; however, since he had unintentionally kidnapped [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] in the process, the Grand Councilwoman rescinded her offer to reinstate Gantu to his former position as captain.

In "[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]", a couple of UGF Troopers were alerted after Experiment 600 ([[Woops]]) had been activated by Hämsterviel and caused mayhem around the prison, which almost blew Hämsterviel's cover in the process, and as a result, he was forced to send all of his captive experiments back to Earth on [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]].

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
In ''Leroy & Stitch'', two UGF Troopers were seen standing on either side of the door, permitting Stitch (captain of the [[B.R.B. 9000]]) entry to rendezvous with the Grand Councilwoman. It should also be noted that these guards were wearing traditional captain uniforms similar to Stitch's, instead of their usual chemical protection suits.

==Trivia==
*The UGF Troopers somewhat resemble [[Stormtroopers]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.
