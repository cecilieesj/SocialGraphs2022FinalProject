'''Dallben''' is the greatest wizard in Prydain, the keeper of the oracular pig [[Hen Wen]], and one of the major characters in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1985]] animated feature film, [[The Black Cauldron|''The'' ''Black Cauldron'']].

==Background==

===Personality===
Dallben is a kind and wise old fellow. He found [[Taran]] when he was a baby and took him in as his own.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Black Cauldron]]''===
Taran later became restless to leave [[Caer Dallben]] to fight against the [[Horned King]] which Dallben disapproves of. Taran later leaves on his quest to protect Hen Wen. At the end of the movie, he is shown with Hen Wen and [[Doli]] saying that Taran did well, even though Gurgi has proven the hero by saving Prydain.
===''[[House of Mouse]] ''===
Dallben made a slight cameo in ''House of Mouse''. In the episode ''[[Donald and the Aracuan Bird]]'', while Donald chases and searches for the Aracuan Bird (hint: right before the Aracuan Bird gets into Ursula's meal), Dallben is seen sitting at a table by Donald.
