'''Grimtrix''' is a sorcerer and antagonist who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series, ''[[Sofia the First]]''. He is the headmaster of [[Hexley Hall (location)|Hexley Hall]] who goes by the title Grimtrix the Good, however his title can be deceiving when in fact he is a bad sorcerer.

==Role in the Series==
Grimtrix first appears in "[[Hexley Hall]]" when Cedric and Princess Sofia arrive at Hexley Hall. When Grimtrix asks them why they're there, Cedric tells him that they're there so Sofia can do some research for her Alchemy Class at Royal Prep. Later on, he reveals that he has known that their reason for being there is to research the Amulet of Avalor due to having been watching them through his Crystal Ball since they arrived and that he wants the Amulet so he can take over a kingdom. He then tries to snatch the Amulet from Sofia with his Crystal Ball. However, Sofia turns the tables on him and destroys his Crystal Ball by using the Amulet to turn herself into a bulldog. She and Cedric then escape.

He appears in ''[[Day of the Sorcerers]]'' as the leader of the Order of the Wand.Â He gives Medusa Stones to some of the bad sorcerers in the land like Graylock the Grand, Morgana and the Baron Von Rocha to put on their wands to freeze the Royals and take over their kingdoms. Cedric is also given a Medusa Stone to freeze Sofia's family and take over Enchancia, but Sofia stops Cedric and destroys his Medusa Stone and Cedric and Wormwood get taken to the dungeon. Grimtrix then comes to Enchancia and freezes Sofia's family with his staff and a Medusa Stone. Grimtrix gives Cedric his staff to freeze Sofia, but Cedric completely becomes good and gives up seizing the throne and he freezes Grimtrix and saves Sofia. Cedric breaks the Medusa Stone and Grimtrix is defeated as Sofia calls the guards to seize the evil sorcerer. Grimtrix and his weasel, Wriggley, are then taken the dungeon once and for all.
