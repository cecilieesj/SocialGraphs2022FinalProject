==Background==
In the film, he is possible a detective in training with [[Inspector Bouchet]] as his mentor (unaware until the end that his own boss is the main culprit.) He respects his boss so much that he can really get on the Inspector's nerves, always trying his best to help him out and doing the necessary precaution.

After the diamond has been found and with the case closed, he regretfully handcuffs his boss with gentle apologies.
