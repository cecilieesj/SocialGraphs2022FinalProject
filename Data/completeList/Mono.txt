'''Mono''' is a character from the animated series, ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. He is a  monkey serving as one of the guardians of the Nazca Realm whom [[Donald Duck]], [[José Carioca]], [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], and [[Xandra]] encounter in a plan to stop [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]].

==Background==
Living in the Nazca Realm located in the Nazca Lines in Peru, Mono serves as one of the landmark's guardians alongside his faithful ally, [[Hanzy]], a giant female being and also a guardian living there. Initially, he lost his favorite magic chalk stolen by [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]], to which he uses a backup one to help the Caballeros and Xandra on their adventure. Later when Sheldgoose is attempting to escape, Mono even worked together with Hanzy, Xandra, and the Caballeros together to stop Felldrake using fragments of the chalk he gave them. Later after Hanzy gets erased after being struck by Sheldgoose using his staff to emit a magic blast, Mono worries over her loss, but was able to redraw her using the magic chalk just as he was able to reunite with her. After redrawing Hanzy, she and Mono even praised the Caballeros and Xandra for helping them just before the four leave.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Nazca Racing]]", the Three Caballeros and Xandra encounter Mono in his cage where José attempts to rescue him, but Xandra explains to him not to play dirty tricks like what José did with the kittens outside Clinton Coot's Cabana who are revealed to be con artists. After freeing him, Mono then introduces himself to the four as the guardian of the Nazca Realm, where he explains fo them that an evil warlock named Sheldgoose stole his magic chalk, explaining to Donald that Sheldgoose arrived to steal the Nazca Gyroscope, which helps keep the Earth spinning around the sun and removing it from the Solar System would cause a disaster, leading the Caballeros and Xandra to stop him from causing catastrophe. Mono manages to help the Caballeros using a backup chalk to help them get to the center of the Earth. As the Caballeros and Xandra come across another side of the rocky plateau with no bridge, Donald complains that he can't draw to which Mono instructs the Caballeros and Xandra to learn how to draw like him while singing the musical number "[[Draw the Line]]", helping the Caballeros and Xandra on their adventure across the Nazca Realm to which after doing some drawings for the group, he offers José to try drawing like him to which after José draws a scenery, Mono even felt impressed that José draws good like him to which the four continue their journey across the Nazca Realm.

As Mono leads the Caballeros to the spot where the Gyroscope would be at, a large female being named Hanzy drops down and introduces herself to which upon encountering her and removing the finger trap Felldrake put on her, Hanzy explains to José and Panchito that any friend of Mono's is a friend of hers as Mono explains to her that he, Xandra, and the Caballeros are planning to stop Sheldgoose from stealing the Gyroscope to which Hanzy agrees to help.

Five hours later, Mono, Xandra, José, Panchito, Donald, and Hanzy arrive at the lair where Clementine, the giant spider, lives to which the six sneak past the lair without waking her up. The six later arrive at the spot where the Nazca Gyroscope is at where it is explained thar the Gyroscope helps keep the Earth spinning. However, before they can protect it, Sheldgoose uses Mono's magic chalk to draw a cage to trap Mono, Xandra, José, Panchito, Donald, and Hanzy as part of Sheldgoose's dirty tricks so that Sheldgoose can return to the real world in a plan to erase them as part of his evil plans. Hanzy was able to remove the cage for them.

Upon escaping, the Caballeros and Xandra use Mono's backup magic chalk to draw their transportation to chase Sheldgoose and stop him from escaping to which while chasing Sheldgoose escaping with Felldrake and [[Leopold the Horrible|Leopold]], the six are later approached by Clementine who woke up from her nap, as she approaches them. However, Xandra, José, Panchito, and Donald draw a bed for the arachnid in order to calm her down so that Clementine can rest peacefully. Later while trying to stop Sheldgoose, Hanzy gets struck by Sheldgoose who used his staff against her, which suddenly erases Mono's ally, leaving Mono with no one to help him. While escaping the Nazca Realm, Mono grieves over the loss of Hanzy who was erased, to which José realizes that as Hanzy is a magical drawing, Mono can redraw her to bring her back to life. Upon redrawing Hanzy, she suddenly comes back to life, thanking the Caballeros for saving her as Mono and Hanzy thank the Caballeros and Xandra for their help just before the four leave.

==Trivia==

*According to him, the cage he was trapped at before the Caballeros and Xandra arrived to rescue him in a plan to stop Sheldgoose was drawn by Sheldgoose himself.
