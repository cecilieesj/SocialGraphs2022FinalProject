'''Felicia''' is Elena's old friend, from before the time [[Shuriki]] conquered [[Avalor]]. She appears in the episode of "[[Flower of Light]]".

== Appearances ==
While visiting the graveyard, Elena meets an old friend, who has lived her life while Elena was timeless within the [[Amulet of Avalor]]. She married Ricardo, who passed away before Elena returned to Avalor. Felicia was a flamenco dancer of considerable talent, but lost her passion for the dance once her husband died.

She goes to the [[Spirit World]] to try and find him again, only to be trapped there with Elena and [[Zuzo]] when Sanza permanently closes the portal between the two worlds. When it is explained that only joy can open the portal again, she performs her dance again to inspire the crowd watching, which reopens the portal.

Then Ricardo returns through the newly re-opened portal, as he had been on the other side waiting to return and they are reunited before she returns to Avalor.
