==Background==
===Personality===
Joaquin is a very worldly ruler. He is shown to be very kind as shown when he urged Elena to not take King Hector's cruel treatment personally. He is shown to be used to taking Hector's lead to get his top of the line gifts to the point where he finds it hard to say no to him. However, he also values doing what's right as shown by being the only one other than Elena who can stand up to Hector.

==Role in the Series==
In his [[Royal Retreat|debut appearance]], Joaquín first appears when he, Elena, [[King Raja]], and [[King Lars]] arrive at King Hector's Royal Retreat. When [[King Hector]] starts being obnoxious toward Elena, he tells her to put up with it telling her that Hector's harsh on all the new rulers. Hector unveils his gift for this year: The Sea Blaster, a ship he claims is indestructible. Suddenly, they see a Marposa ramming King Raja's ship. King Hector orders an attack and Joaquín goes with him while Elena goes to check on her family. Elena comes back and reveals that the Marposa who rammed King Raja's ship is just a baby looking for its mother but Hector does not listen. When Joaquín starts to speak up on Elena's behalf, Hector threatens to not give him his own Sea Blaster if he says he disagrees with him which makes him cave in. Later, he spots the mother Marposa in the distance and tells Hector Elena was right only for Hector to reveal that the attack was never about protecting their ships but to capture the two Marposas for his aquarium. Joaquín is disgusted by this revelation and goes to help Elena. When he finds her, he apologizes to her for not listening to her and helps her free the Marposas. Later, he attends a Royal Retreat hosted by Elena.

In the episode, "[[Olaball]]", Joaquín arrives in [[Avalor]] with his wife Queen Teresa and his daughter [[Princess Caterina]] for the Peace Festival between Avalor and Cariza and to play for Team Cariza in the Festival's Olaball game. He is delighted to see Elena and her family again. During the game, Joaquín plays remarkably until Gabe turns the tide and enables Team Avalor to win with his Royal Guard inspired Olaball moves. Joaquín takes this defeat well especially after Gabe saves Cat and Isabel.
