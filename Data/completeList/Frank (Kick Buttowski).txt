'''Frank''' is an old man who steals [[Kick Buttowski (character)|Kick]]'s new suit in "[[Clothes Call]]"''.'' His lines only consist of the words: "You punk kid!". His real first name is Frank as it is shown in the ending of "Clothes Call" that he is the owner of the umbrella store ("Frank's Umbrellas") that is missing a giant U from its sign due to Kick borrowing it for one of his stunts (which he never gets to perform). He is voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].
