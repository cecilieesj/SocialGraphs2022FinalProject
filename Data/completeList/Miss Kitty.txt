==Physical Appearance==
Miss Kitty is a tall, slender mouse. She has snow-white fur, a slender figure, a maroon nose, large blue eyes with lavender eye-shadow, and red lipstick.

The initial outfit she wears consists of a navy-blue dress with a lighter blue V-shaped bodice, a powder blue underskirt, a short, fuchsia cape, cobalt blue high-heel pumps, and a matching bow in her hair on the back of her head.

Her dancer outfit consists of a sky-blue tight-suit with an exposed back and cleavage, a powder-blue, skirt-like garment, a frilled garter-belt on her right thigh, midnight-blue opera gloves, and her high heels.

==Role in the film==
Miss Kitty is brought on by the Rat Trap's pianist to calm the crowd with her song ''"[[Let Me Be Good to You]]"'' when they prepare to riot. She starts off by singing softly, calming them, and even [[Dr. David Q. Dawson|Dawson]] is attracted to her act. Only [[Basil of Baker Street|Basil]] pays no attention as he notices the bartender drugging his and Dawson's drinks while keeping an eye out for [[Fidget]].

Miss Kitty's song rapidly degenerates into a burlesque act with backup dancers while patrons grab fruitlessly at her. She never misses a step, kicking a couple of patrons off stage. Dawson, in a drugged state, has wound up on stage dancing with the backup dancers, much to Basil's annoyance, before passing out as they look on horrified, and breaking the pianist's piano just as the song ends.

This results in a typical bar fight breaking out, with shots fired and some swinging on chandeliers. Fortunately, our heroes avoid swinging fists or flying chairs and slip out unnoticed through a trap door.

==Trivia==
*Her name was never mentioned, but 'Kitty' is written upon her character model sheet.
*Her musical number is quite daring for a Disney film and its usual audience. For instance, her dance is not only a Victorian Age version of a burlesque strip tease, but when the song hits its climax, she sings "I'll take off all my blues," with most of her relatively skimpy costume being blue.
