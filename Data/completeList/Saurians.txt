==Role in the series==
In the ancient past the Saurian Overlords led their legions of [[Hunter Drones]] in an attempt to invade the planet of [[Puckworld]]. They would have succeeded had it not been for a brave duck by the name of Drake DuCaine. DuCaine was able to do what no one before him had - he was able to see through the saurians cloaking technology with a seemingly normal [[Mask of Drake DuCaine|goalie mask]]. With the powers of the mask, DuCaine sent the Saurians to a mysterious dimension, known only as "Dimensional Limbo" to forever remain trapped.

The last of the Saurians, led by the Overlord [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]], escape Dimensional Limbo and returns to Puckworld with an armada of ships. The Saurians invade Puckworld and successfully enslave the populace. However, a resistance is formed by [[Canard Thunderbeak]], who had found The Mask of Drake DuCaine. Together, they destroy Dragaunus's fortress and free the planet from the Saurians' control. Though their control is lost, Dragaunus and his forces manage to escape in their ship, the Raptor, and end up escaping to Earth through an interdimensional gateway. However, the Ducks follow them, leaving both groups stranded on Earth to continue their fight.
