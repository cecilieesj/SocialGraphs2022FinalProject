'''Mato''' is a supporting character in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[Cars on the Road]]''. She is the older sister to [[Mater]] whose wedding he attends.

==Background==
===Personality===
Upon first meeting, Mato displays a charming and calm personality, until she is around Mater and she turns into a very uptight and condescending person. She describes herself as "passionate" and is very open about her feelings towards her brother. She apparently views herself as the more mature of the two as she despises his laid back attitude and lifestyle. Following [[Cruz Ramirez]]'s intervention, she admits that she admires Mater's carefree attitude and wishes that she could be like him at times.

===Physical appearance===
Mato is an old fashioned sky blue car with extended rearview mirrors on the hood of her car. She has green eyes similar to her brother and her teeth are straighter, though she has a noticeable gap between her front teeth.

==Trivia==
*Mato introduces herself the same way Mater did in the first ''[[Cars]]'' by explaining that her name is like "Tuh-mato, but without the tuh."
*Mato's gap teeth are meant to act as a counterpoint to Mater's giant buck teeth.
*It is implied that Mater's backward driving ability was copied from Mato as she is able to do the same thing.
