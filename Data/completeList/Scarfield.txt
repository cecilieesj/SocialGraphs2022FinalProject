==Background==
Despite being a high-ranking lieutenant, Scarfield shows a cruel and spiteful personality not only to his enemies, but also to his own henchmen, such as when he is shown threatening to hang one of his own officers in Carina Smyth's place if she wasn't found. Ultimately, his demise ended up in the hands of [[Captain Salazar|Armando Salazar]] while he was obsessively pursuing Jack Sparrow and Carina Smyth, since their escapes from the gallows ruined his social standing in the first place.

==Role in the film==
Scarfield is responsible for the recent capture of Carina and Captain Sparrow at St. Martin, as he plans to have both of them executed (Sparrow for piracy and Carina for witchcraft, despite Carina's actual occupation as an astrologist). Fortunately, Sparrow manages to escape trouble once again, and knocks out Scarfield with a block of wood before he could do any harm to Carina and their rescuer Henry Turner.

Humiliated, Scarfield assembles a crew and does everything in his power to find the three miscreants that ruined his reputation. He, along with his crew, seek the help of Shansa the witch, who willingly shows Scarfield the route to the Trident of Poseidon, where Henry, Carina, and Jack were headed, in exchange of him sparing her life. With that in mind, Scarfield plans to obtain the Trident for King George so that the British Empire can rule the Seven Seas.

After hours of searching, Scarfield's ship (the ''Essex'') encountered the newly resurrected ''[[Black Pearl]]''. After Henry Turner spots his ship on the starboard side, Hector Barbossa orders the entire crew to stand their ground and fight until the end. Scarfield stood aboard the ''Essex'' looking at the ''Pearl'' through his spyglass and ordered his men to prepare to fire. When all had seemed well, Scarfield heard a menacing sound creeping up behind him. As he slowly turned around, he noticed a peculiar large object moving upward in a chilling way: the ''[[Silent Mary]]'' (led by the raging Armando Salazar and his ghastly crew). The ''Silent Mary'' opened its sides like a cage and came crashing down on top of Scarfield and his crew, igniting the powder magazine and causing the ''Essex'' to go up into flames and sink to the depths of the ocean, resulting in the deaths of Scarfield and his men.
