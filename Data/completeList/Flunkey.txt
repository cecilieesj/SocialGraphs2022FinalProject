'''Flunkey''' is a feisty, ill-behaved Bandar-log that served as [[King Louie]]'s servant in ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. Despite his kinetic nature, he speaks with a prim and distinguished British accent in the original film.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Jungle Book]]''===
Flunkey is first seen fanning [[King Louie]], and then later during the song "[[I Wanna Be Like You]]", Flunkey is seen annoying King Louie by trying to steal the spotlight and gets thwarted a few times. He is last seen at the end of the song dancing and singing.
===''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''===
Here, Flunkey is known as '''M.C. Monkey''' and has taken over the ruins as King Louie is said to have deserted it. His mannerisms in this filmÂ are far more like King Louie than his own in the original. He is seen in the middle of the film introducing [[Baloo]] to the party of animals at the ruins. He is last seen listening to Baloo's stories of the [[Man Village]] and how "horrible" it is.

''<big>[[TaleSpin]]</big>''

Flunkey somehow made a few appearances in [[TaleSpin]], as an Employee at Louie's Place with the rest of the Bander-log monkeys. 

===Other appearances===
In "[[Mumbai Madness]]", Flunkey briefly appears alongside King Louie as they chase after Mickey during a travel montage.

==Trivia==
*Originally, Flunkey's role in ''The Jungle Book 2'' was meant for King Louie but due to the issues with Gia Prima (the widow of Louie's original voice actor [[Louis Prima]]), his role was given to Flunkey.
**Because of this, Flunkey's mannerisms and British accent were scrapped for what is essentially an imitation of the smooth-talking, jazzy characteristics of King Louie.
*Flunkey might be a Capped Langur or a Long-Tailed Macaque.
