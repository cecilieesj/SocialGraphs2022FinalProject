'''Depa Billaba''' is a [[Jedi|Jedi Master]], part of the Jedi High Council and the mentor of [[Kanan Jarrus]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe.

==Background==
===Personality===
Depa is known for being thoughtful, an excellent problem solver, soft-spoken, enlightened, and spiritual. She was also shown to be protective of her comrades, like [[Mace Windu]]. However, during the first few months of the Clone Wars, Depa gradually degenerated into madness on a mission and fell into a coma.

As a Jedi, Depa is highly intelligent and wise, and willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of others. She also believed that the Jedi Order made a crucial error in taking military titles, thinking that it was not a matter of leadership but of role and rank.

Depa developed a close relationship with her apprentice, [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], being more strict as a teacher than he later was. However, she is not overly serious, as she sometimes gently teased him about his habit of asking many questions.

===Physical appearance=== 
Depa is a short, lithe, young and attractive humanoid woman with two chalactan marks adorning the bridge of her nose and forehead as symbols of her illumination and spiritual awareness. She has brown eyes, caramel skin, simple makeup, red (often plum) lips, and a brown hair tied in a chalactan-inspired bun with two platted tails looped twice down toward her shoulders. She is often wearing simple brown robes with a long frontal piece connecting to the hood, a long, cream colored dress (''The Phantom Menace''), and sometimes a shorter, greeny-blue colored battle tunic, pants, and boots.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[The Force]]:''' Depa has a very strong connection to the Force.
**'''Telekinesis:''' Depa can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and she utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes.
**'''Telepathy:''' Depa can telepathically communicate with other individuals over small or vast distances, especially with [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], whom she had formed a Force-bond with.
***'''Mind Trick:''' Depa can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.
***'''Taming Beasts:''' Depa can control the minds of animals.

*'''Master Lightsaber Duelist:''' Depa is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist.
**'''Form III:''' Depa is highly skilled in Soresu.
**'''Form V:''' Depa is highly skilled in Shien/Djem So.

**'''Jar'Kai:''' Depa is highly skilled in Jar'Kai.
*'''High-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Leader:''' Depa is highly intelligent and wise. As a Jedi General, Depa is a highly skilled tactician and a very capable leader.
*'''Multilingual:''' Depa is capable of fluently speaking Basic, Coruscanti, Huttese, Kel Dor, and Shyriiwook. She knows the trader's language of the Senex Ancient Houses.

===Weapons and Equipment===
====Lightsaber====
Depa's valued weapon and possession is her green-bladed lightsaber.
*'''[[Lightsaber]]:''' Depa had built a green-bladed lightsaber which she used throughout her [[Jedi]] career and the entirety of the Clone Wars. It would remain in Depa's possession until her death, but it is unknown what happened to it after Depa's death.

==Film Appearances==
===''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace''===
Depa is a young member of the [[Jedi|Jedi High Council]] when [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] reports that he faces a [[Sith]] on [[Tatooine]]. He also claims he found the Chosen One, who is a boy named [[Anakin Skywalker]]. The council refuses to train him, as [[Yoda]] says there is too much fear in him. She later attends Qui-Gon's funeral, which Qui-Gon was killed by the Sith Lord, [[Darth Maul]], on [[Naboo]].

===''Star Wars: Attack of the Clones''===
Depa is still a part of the [[Jedi|Jedi High Council]] when they assign [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and his apprentice, [[Anakin Skywalker]], to protect [[Padmé Amidala]], who had been targeted in a complex assassination plot. She later safeguards the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]] with fellow Jedi Master Oppo Rancisis, while her old master [[Mace Windu]] takes a 250-strong Jedi strikeforce to rescue Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padmé on [[Geonosis]].

==Television Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''===
Depa makes a cameo appearance in the episode "Old Friends Not Forgotten". She appears in a hologram with her apprentice, [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]] during a flashback scene where they discuss with the other Jedi generals about the overwhelming attack by the Separatist.

===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===
At the time before ''Star Wars Rebels'', six months into the Clone Wars, Depa participated in the war with her Padawan, [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]]. They fight side by side during the Clone Wars until the Execution of Order 66, when clones they fight alongside with turn against them. The two fight in defense, but Depa soon realizes that they are vastly outnumbered by the [[Clone Troopers]] of their unit. She orders her apprentice to run while she holds them off, but is quickly gunned down by Commander Grey and the rest of the men who once served under her command. Her death would leave her apprentice, now known as Kanan Jarrus, scarred with grief and guilt because he escaped and she did not. Years later, Kanan would be able to take on an apprentice of his own, [[Ezra Bridger]] and move on from his master's death.

Depa appears in the first episode "Aftermath". Darth Sidious executed Order 66, a command to all clone troopers to kill the Jedi as traitors, this included her entire clone squadron shooting at her. She is killed by her clone troopers after being overwhelmed by them after telling [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]] to run, leading her apprenctice to escape.
