==Role in the film==
Katie has lived alone with her father, Darby, since her mother died. She enjoys caring for her elderly father, but still finds time to enjoy herself at dances in town at night. She is tough and no-nonsense with Darby and brave enough to stand up to the bullying [[Pony Sugrue]], but she understands her father's unique relationship with the Leprechauns. As Darby puts it, 'she has a tongue would clip a hedge.'

When Michael MacBride comes to replace Darby as a caretaker on [[Lord Fitzpatrick]]'s order, Katie runs into town to fetch Darby at the pub and he leads her to believe he is merely hired help. Michael and Katie soon warm to each other, and Darby and [[King Brian]] decide to encourage their love. King Brian visits Katie and Michael in their dreams. Though Katie insists she has no interest in a husband, King Brian convinces her to go with Michael on a visit to the ruins of Knocknasheega outside of town the next day. When Pony arrives and tries to pick a fight with Michael, Katie intervenes and orders Pony off. Nevertheless, she and Michael share their first kiss.

When Pony's mother, [[Sheelah Sugrue|Sheelah]], tells her the truth about Michael, she is furious with him, believing he lied to her and came to take Darby's job away. When he tries to ask her to marry him, she refuses to listen and leaves to fetch Darby at the pub. At night, when Michael stops her from finding Darby horse, Cleopatra, she slaps him; telling him she does not love him. However, she has a dangerous fall and is later found by Darby in a coma with a fever when trying to catch Cleopatra at Knocknasheega.

By that night, she is in danger of dying as the Death Coach, summoned by the [[Banshee (Darby O'Gill and the Little People)|Banshee]], comes to claim her soul. Fortunately, she is saved by the intervention of Darby and King Brian. On recovering, she and Michael makeup and admit their love for one another.

The film ends with Darby driving his cart with Michael and Katie in the back, singing "[[Pretty Irish Girl]]" reprise and sharing a kiss as they ride off.
