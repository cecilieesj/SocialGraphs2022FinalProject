'''Kizin''' is a character on ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. He is voiced by Roman Reigns.

== Appearance ==
Kizin is a giant with green skin and a baby face with large spots on his face and one tooth in his mouth. He has a mushroom on his head.

== Role in the series ==
Kizin is first mentioned in the special 'Realm of the Jaquins', where [[ King Verago|King Verago]] explains why the Jaquins dislike humans entering Vallestrella. Many years ago, humans entered Vallestrella and unearthed Kizin. It was the biggest battle the Jaquins fought, and though they won, there was a great cost.

Kizin makes his debut in the episode 'Giant Steps', where [[Chatana]], [[ Ash Delgado |Ash]] and [[Chancellor Esteban |Esteban]] plan to free him to gather forces. With the help of Tziloco, they enter Vallestrella, where Chatana shows Ash and Esteban the mound where Kizin was imprisoned. Ash frees Kizin, who is upset with his 'mother', Chatana for leaving him to be captured. Chatana tries to explain that she was captured and though Kizin takes a liking to Esteban, he refuses to help them and instead goes to free his friends trapped in [[Quita Moz |Quita Moz's]] jars.

Esteban teleports Ash's group away just as [[Princess Elena |Elena's]] group appears. [[Mateo]] recognizes Kizin and warns that his weak spot is his left foot. Elena sends the Jaquins back to bring the King's guard and her group sets out to stop Kizin.

Elena's group sets a trap for Kizin. Unfortunately, [[Naomi Turner |Naomi]] ruins the trap when she goes after Tziloco. Kizin hurts Elena in a way that breaks her arm and kidnaps [[Gabe Núñez|Gabe]] and Mateo and brings them to Quita Moz's nest. Kizin breaks through the entrance of Quita Moz's nest and gets ready to open the jars that contains his trapped friends. Fortunately, Naomi and Elena arrive in time and Naomi uses a magical bag to trap Kizin inside. Elena's group then plan to put the trapped Kizin in one of Quita Moz's jars.
