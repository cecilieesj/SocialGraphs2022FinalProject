'''Mayor Tomkins''' is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. He is portrayed by Bill Dow, and it is unknown if he has a [[Storybrooke]] counterpart.

During one wolfstime, a period of time in which a wolf terrorizes [[Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood's]] village, Mayor Tomkins requested for support from [[w:C:onceuponatime:WIdow Lucas|Widow Lucas]], who knew much about the wolves due to personal experience.
However, Lucas refused to help the group and shut the door in their faces, afterward informing her granddaughter Ruby (nicknamed Red) to go to bed and wear her cloak, which Red obligingly did. However, the next morning, Tomkins's hunting party was found slaughtered by the wolf near the well.

Tomkins called for a town meeting and expressed regret over the lives lost. He vowed that the slaughter will be the last massacre of their people; Widow Lucas attempted to dissuade the villagers from going out against the wolf all at once. She told them about her own story—how seven fully-grown men were killed in one instant by that single wolf.

Nevertheless, on the last day of wolfstime, Tomkins led a hunting party for the wolf, only to discover Widow Lucas and the destroyed corpse of the blacksmith's boy, [[Peter]] . It is implied he and the hunting party were killed, as Widow Lucas assumed wolf form a final time in order to give Red and [[Snow White]] a chance to escape.
