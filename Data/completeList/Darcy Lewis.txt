'''Darcy Lewis''' is a co-worker/intern of [[Jane Foster]] and [[Erik Selvig]], and the love interest of Ian Boothby. She is a major character in ''Thor'' and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', and returns in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'', ''[[What If...?]]'' and ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''. She also appears in two comics, ''Fury's Big Week'' and ''Thor: The Dark World Prelude.''

Darcy is portrayed by [[Kat Dennings]].

==Background==
=== Physical appearance ===
Darcy is slender and stands at a pretty average height. She's shown as an average college student with black glasses, brown eyes, and clean brown hair to match. Darcy is usually seen wearing a red hat.

=== Personality ===
Darcy Lewis is a devoted college student with a lot of compassion, ambition, and intellect, with her heart usually, if not always, in the right place. Despite initially not being a scientist like her friends, Darcy is intelligent and perceptive, as she is the first to notice the "anomaly" that made Jane Foster realize that Thor fell out of it. Years later, as a Doctor in Astrophysics, she is also the one who discovers the broadcast coming from [[Westview]], which allows the [[S.W.O.R.D.]] agents to study the anomaly happening inside the town.

Truly devoted, Darcy is extremely goal-oriented and takes great pride in her achievements. She has great respect for Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and constantly follows them around, hoping to gain knowledge from their endeavors together, even refusing to desert them during the dangers of the Convergence. 

She is also flattered Jane about her smell while she was on a date and acknowledges Ian Boothby for preventing a Dark Elf from killing her. Lewis also considers Thor to be very attractive, much like [[Gamora]].

Nevertheless, her good qualities are often overlooked because of her immense intensity, eagerness, curiosity, and tendency to follow people around. She is shown to be very impulsive, as she tases Thor because he was freaking her out and drops Ian, whom she has romantic feelings for, after Jane witnesses them making out. Notably, she takes accountability for tasing Thor and apologizes to him. While she continuously attempts to be helpful every chance she gets, Foster and Selvig often consider her to be annoying.

=== Equipment ===
Darcy has a taser strong enough to zap Asgardians into unconsciousness. Curiously, she did not appear to have it on hand during the Battle of Greenwich, leaving her nearly defenseless.

== Appearances ==
===''Thor''===
{{Quote|What? He was freaking me out!|Darcy defending her tasering of Thor}}
Darcy Lewis is Jane Foster's intern, a quirky but quick-thinking political science major who found herself in the middle of Earth's first contact with an alien civilization, and while she doesn't always understand everything that's happening around her, she doesn't hesitate to speak up about it. When [[Thor Odinson]] arrives on Earth, Darcy tasers him with a masterful flick at his busom, claiming that he was freaking her out.

===''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''===
{{Quote|I should not have to do this. I don't get paid enough. In fact, I don't think I get paid at all.|Darcy|Thor: The Dark World}}
When Jane discovers an ancient cosmological event affecting the Earth, it's Darcy who has to pick up the slack when Jane disappears.

After Jane goes to Asgard, Darcy and Ian try to contact Selvig while she called him on the phone, Ian watches the news and finds out what happened to Erik, then she and Ian go to the asylum to seek Erik. When Selvig sees Darcy, he does not recognize her but almost immediately he remembers her.

During the Battle of Greenwich, Darcy is nearly attacked by Dark Elves but Ian saves her. In gratitude, Darcy kisses Ian, before they reunite with Jane and the others. With Malekith defeated, Darcy kissed Ian again in celebration. At Jane's flat, she and the others tried to assure Jane would come back. Her prediction was accurate, as she was present when Thor returned to Earth.

===''[[WandaVision]]''===
Darcy, now a doctor in astrophysics, appears in ''WandaVision'', starting in the [[We Interrupt This Program|fourth episode]]. Along with [[Jimmy Woo]] and other S.W.O.R.D agents, she watches the sitcom created inside [[Westview]], while trying to figure out what is happening inside the town. At the end of the episode, she and the others aid [[Monica Rambeau]] that was ejected out of the town by [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]].

===''[[What If...?]]''===
Darcy makes a prominent appearance in ''[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]''. She is first seen with Jane as the two detect a high energy reading heading towards Las Vegas, initially believing this to be an invasion from space. They arrive in Vegas to find that it is in fact Thor throwing a party. As Jane makes contact with Thor, Darcy decides to spend the evening with [[Howard the Duck]], insisting it's not a date, though the two ultimately get married during the evening. The next day, Jane & Darcy are taken to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], since they were the first ones to warn [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] about the arrival. When [[Maria Hill]] activates [[Captain Marvel]]'s beeper, Darcy initially thinks they're calling a podiatrist, since her father is one and also uses a beeper. After Carol & Thor's first confrontation, Darcy is super excited to meet Carol (admitting she was initially expecting a man) and tries to offer being an intern for Carol. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. drops Jane & Darcy back in Vegas. Howard appears, referring to Darcy as "Mrs. The Duck", but Darcy is not in the mood to argue with him. Darcy makes a comment about how similar the events of the episode are to a teen party film, and quips about calling Thor's mother. This gives Jane the idea to do just that! Darcy then helps Jane get [[Heimdall]]'s attention, who in turn sends Jane to [[Frigga]], to tell her about what is happening with Thor on Earth.

===''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''===
When Jane started having Stage IV cancer, Darcy visits her at the hospital and offers her some snacks to cheer her up. Darcy notices Jane trying to rush her chemotherapy so she can get back to work in sharing her discoveries with the world while not telling anyone else about her cancer. Darcy advises Jane to slow down and maybe start considering getting back together with Thor since they've broken up, but Jane assures her she's got everything under control.

==Relationships==
===[[Jane Foster]]===
One of Darcy's closest friends was [[Jane Foster]]. The two agreed on pretty much everything and constantly operated together, though Jane often seems annoyed by Darcy's energy. Darcy also tries to get Jane to relax, joking with her on several occasions and getting a stark variety of reactions to her sense of humor from Jane.

When Jane developed cancer, Darcy was one of the first people to learn about it. Darcy visited Jane in the hospital, giving her snacks and advised her to take her treatment slowly and maybe consider reconnecting with Thor.

===[[Erik Selvig]]===
It is unknown how long Darcy has been working for Professor [[Erik Selvig]], but she seemed to have established a good relationship with her boss.

===[[Ian Boothby]]===
Darcy was close to Ian Boothby, who became her boyfriend after both worked under Erik Selvig. 

He was initially hired as her intern and she found her patience tested with him but they got along because of their similar personalities. They also fought Dark Elves together, during which time Ian saved Darcy's life, impressing her with his bravery. They were seen making out later by Jane Foster and Erik Selvig, much to Darcy's embarrassment. After Malekith was defeated, Darcy promptly kissed Ian because the conflict was over. They presumably became a couple afterwards.

===[[Thor Odinson]]===
Darcy and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] got off to a bad start, after she tasered him, thinking he was 'a crazy homeless person' and not responding well to his rants and threats. However, they eventually got over it after Darcy realized she found him to be incredibly attractive and Thor appeared to respect her for being intelligent and agile enough to catch him off guard so easily when he had challenged her. She was greatly amazed by his strength and power after it was restored often going to him for help. As two close friends of Jane's, Darcy had respect for Thor's tendency not to exactly stay out of life-threatening trouble. She was usually happy to help him out. He acts friendly toward her, and she gives him the same respect, but the two had little contact.

==Trivia==
*In early versions of the movie, Darcy was originally written as a male character.
*As a running gag, she mistakenly, yet repeatedly calls [[Mjolnir]] "myuh myuh", after she hears Thor talk about it in the first ''Thor'' film. She still has not been informed of the correct way to pronounce it.
*Darcy is the first person in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to refer to [[Howard the Duck]] by name, in ''[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]''.
