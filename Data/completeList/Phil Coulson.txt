===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
Phil Coulson is a high-ranking and trusted agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. In 2007, Coulson traveled with May and the others agents to Bahrain to find a woman with strange powers called Eva Belyakov. During this mission, they talked about the construction of the [[Triskelion]] and recruiting powerful people onto a team.

====''Iron Man''====
Coulson is first seen in ''Iron Man'', where he seeks [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] to discuss his escape from a cave in Afghanistan in an [[Iron Man (armor)|iron suit]], but is dismissed by Tony.

After Pepper discovers that Obadiah had ordered Tony Stark to be killed and her life is put at risk, she turns to Coulson for protection. Coulson goes to arrest Obadiah Stane, now the Iron Monger but is unable to apprehend him. This led to a battle between Iron Man and the Iron Monger over Los Angeles. After the battle, Tony Stark holds a press conference. Coulson gives him an alibi, which Tony eventually disregards, and instead declares, "I am Iron Man."

====''Iron Man 2''====
In ''Iron Man 2'', Coulson is present at Tony Stark's hearing with Senator Stern. He also bumps into Pepper Potts, telling her he can't help Stark out of this. He is then ordered to keep Stark at his house. Later, he visits Tony to inform him that he will travel to [[New Mexico]] by order of Director Nick Fury. In a post-credits scene, Coulson calls Fury to inform him that they have located a [[Mjolnir|mysterious object]].

====''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer''====
To be added.

In ''Thor'', after arriving in New Mexico, Coulson and his team discover that the mysterious object had been discovered by the locals, but they could not move it, even when using their vehicles. Coulson later confiscated the work of [[Jane Foster]] about wormholes. That night, when [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] infiltrates the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base, Coulson advises [[Hawkeye|Agent Barton]] to attack if necessary. Coulson sees that Thor cannot move the hammer, and sends agents to capture him.

Coulson interrogates Thor, who does not answer any of his questions. Selvig comes to rescue Thor saying that he was a member of his team and his name was Donald Blake, although Coulson does not believe him. They release "Donald", but Coulson sends agents to follow them, just in case. Days later, Sitwell informs Coulson about a new crater in New Mexico. Coulson travels there, where they discover the [[Destroyer]].

The Destroyer attacks them, but they are saved by a re-powered Thor. Thor, the Prince of Asgard, promises to protect the Earth so long as S.H.I.E.L.D. returns Jane Foster's work. Coulson wants to ask Thor some questions, but Thor goes to Asgard to confront [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]].

====''The Consultant''====
As the [[World Security Council]] sought to liberate the Emil Blonsky, the [[Abomination]], because they considered him a war hero, Coulson and Sitwell devised a plan to avoid this. The plan was to send someone very annoying to General Ross to convince him not to release Blonsky. Coulson sends [[Iron Man|Tony]] to talk to Ross. Days later, Sitwell and Coulson meet and talk about the success of their plan.

====''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''====

Finally Stark joins the team with the help of [[Pepper Potts|Pepper]].

Later, the team broke into Zabo's building to save [[Quake|Skye]] from HYDRA. When HYDRA outnumbered them, Ward asked him what they should do. Since there was no other way, Coulson decided to surrender and talk to [[Robert Gonzales]].

After surrender, Coulson asked Robert Gonzales aid in their fight against HYDRA. Gonzales agreed, but on condition that the Council decide if they should help. After a favorable vote for him, Coulson and his team went to the Arctic to rescue Deathlok and destroy the HYDRA base. After an intense battle, the team was able to rescue the prisoners and destroy the penultimate base known of HYDRA. Coulson keep its promise and opened the toolbox to Gonzales.
