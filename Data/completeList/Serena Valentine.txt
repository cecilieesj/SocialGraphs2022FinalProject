'''Serena Valentine''' was a reporter for the school newspaper at Bayside High School in the episode "[[A Fish Called Raven]]".

==Season 1==
[[Raven Baxter|Raven]] and Serena had a rivalry on who could get the head page story, which went to Raven after she had a vision of a sky-diving clown crashing through the window. Serena became suspicious and found Raven's article about [[Eddie Thomas|Eddie]]'s game-wining basketball shot that hadn't yet occurred. If Eddie made that shot, Serena would have the proof she needed to oust Raven as a psychic.

Raven pleaded with Eddie to miss the shot so Serena would be proven false, but Eddie saw it as too much of a boost in popularity to give up. Eddie was primed to make the game winning shot, but passed it to the coach's nerdy son, who made the winning shot.

Serena was angry that she wasted the last few days on a wild goose chase, but refused to completely rule out the possibility.
