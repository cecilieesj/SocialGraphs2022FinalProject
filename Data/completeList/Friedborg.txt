'''Friedborg''' is a handmaid who appears in ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''. She is recognizable for her atypical facial features, and being silent all the time. She can sometimes be mistaken for [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], since she wears the same maiden dress that Cassandra wears.

==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==
She first appeared in "[[Cassandra v. Eugene]]", when [[Rapunzel]] mistook her for Cassandra. Rapunzel spoke awkwardly with her, and Friedborg made no replies except displaying a creepy smile showing a huge gap between her front teeth. She again appears in "[[Under Raps]]", when she joined Rapunzel for a "ladies lunch" arranged for Cassandra. In "[[The Way of the Willow]]", she gets reacquainted with [[Queen Arianna]]'s sister, [[Willow]]. It is hinted by Willow that she and Friedborg used to get into a lot of trouble when they were young. In "[[Painter's Block]]", she attends an art class that was orchestrated by [[Mrs. Sugarby|an evil spirit]] who was disguised as an old woman, so she could use Friedborg and her classmates to perform a spell that would free her master before Rapunzel freed them from her control.

== Trivia ==
*Friedborg is allergic to lizards, so she cannot get along with [[Pascal]].
*In "[[Rapunzel and the Lost Lagoon]]", Miss Tasha (the matchmaker) while examining the aura of people, states that Friedborg has a red flame, the sign of a romantic. Friedborg match "will have a green flame. To soothe your passionate heart".
*She is the only recurring character to never speak.
