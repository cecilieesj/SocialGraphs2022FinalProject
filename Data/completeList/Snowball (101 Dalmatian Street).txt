|quote = |family=Stanislav (Owner)}}'''Snowball''' is a Pomeranian and a supporting character of the TV series ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''. She is one of [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]]'s friends and is owned by a human named Stanislav, who is the local merchant in Camden.

==Background==
===Personality===
Snowball has a thick [[Russia]]n accent and speaks slightly broken English. She is shown to be serious and feisty, but willing to help her friends with problems.

===Physical appearance===
Snowball, true to her name, is a small white Pomeranian with her fur puffed up in a spherical shape that is so circular that the fur covers her head, leaving only her face visible. Also emerging from this round puffball of fur is her tiny legs. She wears a collar which can connect to a retractable leash her owner has, but it isn't visible due to her fur.

==Role in the series==
Snowball's first appearances were during the World Wide Woof sequences of early episodes when [[Dylan]] used it.

Her first full appearance was in "[[Winter Funderland]]", where she and Roxy were invited as guests for [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]]'s indoor winter party. Snowball was used as a decoration for a snowman and Roxy later used her as an actual snowball, throwing her at Portia. After getting up and shaking off her dizziness, she rolled her eyes and told Spencer that this happens to her every winter.

In "[[Disco Pups]]", she is trying to create a dance video with her BFFs Dolly and Roxy, but Roxy's clumsiness messes things up and Snowball grows more and more frustrated with each attempt until she goes into a yapping fit and bounces up and down. Dolly and Roxy imitate her and ultimately come up with a dance they can all do together.
