'''Nana II''' is a [[wikipedia:St Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] who appears in Disney's [[2002]] film ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', the sequel to the [[1953]] film ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''. She used to be a nursemaid like her relative, [[Nana]], but became slightly cynical around World War II.

== Background ==

===Personality===
Nana II is a fun-loving St. Bernard. Like Nana with [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]], [[John Darling|John]], and [[Michael Darling]], she feels the need to protect [[Jane (Peter Pan)|Jane]] and [[Danny (Peter Pan)|Danny]]. It is unknown whether or not she puts toys away or serves medicine.

==Role in the film==
Nana II is [[Edward]], Wendy, Jane, and Danny's pet dog. She is most likely a descendant from Nana. She helps Jane on her mission to deliver Danny's birthday present through war-torn [[London]] dodging bombs and marching soldiers. She seems to be very active in saving [[England]] with Jane. When Jane exclaims [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] isn't real, she leaves the [[Nursery|nursery]] heartbroken and disappointed. She is very happy when Edward returns home from the war and Jane has found her faith despite it. Like Nana, she looks out the nursery window at the end of the film.

==Trivia==
*Nana II is obviously named after Nana from the first film and they are clearly related though it's unknown whether she is Nana's daughter, niece, or even granddaughter.
