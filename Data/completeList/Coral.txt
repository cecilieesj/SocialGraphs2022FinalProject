'''Coral''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2003]] animated film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]''. She was the mate of [[Marlin]] and mother of [[Nemo]] and 399 unborn Clownfish. 

==Role in the film==
Coral is seen at the beginning of the film, and she and Marlin swam down below their sea anemone to a small cave where there were hundreds of baby clownfish eggs. Marlin then decided to name half the kid's Marlin Junior and the other half Coral Jr. However, Coral says that she likes the name "Nemo", so Marlin says that he'll only name one egg "Nemo" because he wants most of them to be Marlin Jr. When Coral wondered why Marlin was looking at her the way he did at one point, Marlin asked Coral if she remembered how they first met and made Coral laugh so hard that she tried to get away from Marlin by swimming out of the anemone.

When Marlin swam out after her, he saw Coral staring at a barracuda, then told her to get back into the house. However, despite Marlin's attempts to get her to go inside their home, she rushed down to protect the children, and the barracuda went after her. Marlin fended the barracuda off from eating him, but it then slapped him with its tail knocking him out in his anemone. With Marlin unconscious, the barracuda ate Coral and her eggs, and presumably, while eating them, one egg fell out of its mouth.

When Marlin later regained consciousness that night, he discovered that Coral and all but one of their eggs were gone, as they had been eaten by the barracuda. Weeping over the loss of his mate and children, Marlin found the one lonely surviving egg and named it "Nemo" to honor his late mate's wish to name one of their children "Nemo".

A few years later, when Marlin and Coral's sole surviving son Nemo has grown into a kid (with a little right fin due to the slight damage his egg received from the barracuda attack), it is shown that Coral and her children's deaths have greatly affected Marlin, which have caused him to become increasingly overprotective to the point where he does not allow Nemo to go out of the anemone much.

==Trivia==
*In the original storyboard of the movie, there was supposed to be a brief scene where the audience could see Coral and the eggs inside the Barracuda's mouth, but the scene was later deleted.{{Citation needed}}
*Coral is the first female [[Pixar]] character to die.
*Coral is referenced in the [[Finding Dory|sequel]] when [[Dory]] talks to Marlin and Nemo about missing her parents.
*Coral is named after the real-life marine invertebrate of the same name which despite resembling a plant is actually an animal that builds large structures called "coral reefs" that help with the ocean's ecosystems.
*Although Coral is not mentioned much, it is known that her death has greatly affected Marlin, and is indirectly the reason for his overprotectiveness over Nemo.
