The '''Red Queen's Executioner''' is a minor character from [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2010]] [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland'']]. 

==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 video)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
The Executioner is seen briefly during [[Tarrant Hightopp]]'s execution as a large crowd is gathered to watch the execution. Throughout the moment, the Executioner prepares to kill Tarrant at dawn under orders from the [[Red Queen]]. The Executioner uses his axe in a plan to kill Tarrant, but misses his strike. It is then shown that it was [[Chessur]] who rescued Tarrant from the Executioner just as he notices this being unusual to him. Tarrant then tells everyone who is enslaved has been betrayed by the Red Queen as he tells the courtiers and everyone else to stand up against the Red Queen as they all celebrate their freedom, much to the Red Queen's fury. It is unknown of what happened to the Executioner after that.

===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===
This Executioner is totally different from his counterpart in the 2010 Tim Burton adaptation, though Wonderland instead of Underland unlike in the Tim Burton adaptation. Here, he appears in the fourth episode of ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]'', "[[The Serpent]]".

During an execution event, an executioner is seen swinging his axe on a watermelon, slicing it in half as [[Elizabeth (Once Upon a Time in Wonderland)|Elizabeth]] and [[Alice]] witness this event to which Liz explains to Alice that if she catches the watermelon, the two would receive free dinner. Later, [[the Knave of Hearts]] is placed on an execution platform as the crowd orders him to be killed to which the executioner arrives and prepares to kill him, but misses. The ''real'' Executioner, disrobed, then arrives, telling a group of red knights to go after Alice just as Alice and the Knave escape from the crowd who are all angry that the event is disrupted.

==Trivia==
*The Executioner is the only human character in Tim Burton's adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland'' to be completely in CGI - though he speaks only one line throughout the entire film. Jim Carter also voiced several other servants to the Red Queen.
*Though he does not return in ''Alice Through the Looking Glass'', the Executioner briefly appears on a music box as a non-physical cameo which [[Time]] gives to the Red Queen as a gift to her.
