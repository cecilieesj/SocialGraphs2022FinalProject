'''GO-4''' ('''GO-FR''') is the secondary antagonist of the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''.

==Background==
GO-4 was a small white robot and first mate of the [[Axiom]] he was charged with overseeing security aboard the ship. He used his own personal elevator system to move quickly around the Starliner. The entrances/exits of the elevator were usually at Steward Kiosks, the places where [[SECUR-T]] (Stewards) would wait inactive until they were needed. The elevator also granted GO-4 access to the captain's quarters.

===Physical appearance===
GO-4 is quite small and easily recognizable due to the red police light atop his body. his body somewhat resembles that of a soldier standing at attention. GO-4 is equipped with two arms for saluting and using interfaces (Such as the ones in the escape pod) and an anti-gravity stasis beam. GO-4, like [[EVE]] has a chest cavity for storage. For communication, he had various beeps and other sounds (Including hissing!), similar to [[R2-D2]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''. GO-4 units also can deliver coffee and dry-cleaning to superiors.

==Appearances==
===''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''===
GO-4 is first seen descending a personal elevator near two activating Stewards. With beeps, he directs them to the docking area where the [[EVE]]'s retreat for evaluation. 

He scans them, even scanning [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] accidentally before finding a probe with positive results. As a robotic arm picks her up and places her to a MVR-A, GO-4 tells the Stewards to lead the MVR-A until it was carried to a People Mover. 

As the MVR-A with the positive probe is brought to the Captain's quarters, he communicates with AUTO with a series of beeps, possibly about the secret directive [[A113|A-113]]. while AUTO is in the captains quarters with [[Captain B. McCrea|the captain]], GO-4 presumably retrieves the plant from EVE's storage compartment for disposal, after EVE is supposedly shown to be faulty, the captain instructs GO-4 to bring EVE and WALL-E to the Repair ward for diagnostics and cleaning respectively. 

As EVE is about to send WALL-e home to earth, GO-4  briefly arrives and places the plant in the escape pod and sets it to self destruct, (possibly putting some sort of override stopping WALL-E from disarming the sequence), before leaving. 

As AUTO's secret directive is found by the Captain, AUTO sends GO-4 to the quarters to attempt discarding the plant. The Captain orders EVE to arrest GO-4 for mutiny. He hisses to intimidate EVE before throwing the plant down the garbage shoot, much to the distress of EVE and the captain, however, Wall-E then emerges from the garbage shoot with the plant, after AUTO tases WALL-E, GO-4 traps EVE in his suspension beam while AUTO deactivates her before dropping her down the shoot.  

He was accidentally destroyed when he attempted to assist AUTO in taking down Captain B. McCrea and was kicked and sent flying through a window and crashing down near one of the swimming pools in the Lido Deck, obliterating him.

===Other appearances===
A GO-4 appears briefly in the short ''[[BURN-E]]'', which takes place during the events of the film.

One also appears in the [[WALL-E (video game)|video game]], but it doesn't break.

==Trivia==
*GO-4 is a pun on how personal assistants are often referred to as "gophers/gofers," a verbal pun as they are often sent to "Go for (GO-4) things."
*When GO-4 is sent flying out of the window, he makes a whistling sound and a smash sound effect very similar to the sound [[wikipedia:Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] makes when falling off a cliff in ''[[wikipedia:Looney Tunes|Looney Tunes]]''.
*According to the Pixarpedia, GO-4, like Auto, are not sentient, and therefore they lack technical alignment, as all they do are following orders since they can't think.
