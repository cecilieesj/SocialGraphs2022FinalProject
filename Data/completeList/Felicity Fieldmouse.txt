'''Felicity Fieldmouse''' (née '''Mouse'''), also known as '''Amely Mouse-Fieldmouse'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Disney Who's Who|publisher=Disney Press|date=September 5, 2017|isbn=978-1368009928|pages=247}}</ref> or '''Amelia Fieldmouse''' or simply '''Mrs. Fieldmouse''', is an anthropomorphic mouse who is [[Mickey Mouse]]'s older sister and [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse|Morty and Ferdie]]'s mother.

==History==
[[File:01pukenmax1e.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mrs. Fieldmouse in her (and Morty and Ferdie's) first appearance.]]
She first appeared in Morty and Ferdie's [[1932]] debut strip, ''Mickey's Nephews'', as a mouse lady arriving at Mickey's house and drops the twins off, asking if Mickey would not mind caring for them while she's running an errand. While in the original English version she had no first name and was referred to as "Mrs. Fieldmouse", a Dutch translation of the same of the comic strip had Mickey referring to her as "Amalia" (Dutch spelling of "Amelia"). In these original strips, Mrs. Fieldmouse is not Mickey's sister; as drawn, she looks more like an elderly relative, and Mickey refers to her "Mrs. Fieldmouse" rather than her first name. However, the relationship was changed to a siblinghood when she was re-introduced in more recent comics. The fact that Mickey is Morty and Ferdie's maternal uncle was also indirectly confirmed by the fact that, in the [[1935]] ''Mickey Mouse'' one-pager ''He's a Knockout'', Mickey states that he does not have a brother.<ref>http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=U+MMA++6B03</ref>

At Egmont Publishing, when her new design and characterization were fleshed out by Disney comic author Paul Halas and Disney comic artist Francisco Rodriguez, she was given the name Felicity Fieldmouse. As a side note, Egmont also named Felicity's husband—the twins' father—Frank, though he has yet to be specifically named or depicted in a published comic. Egmont's modern version of Felicity has slimmed down, which is designed to look closer to Mickey in age while remaining significantly taller than him with a more attractive body and face.
