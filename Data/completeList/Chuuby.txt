==== <big>Description</big> ====
''"Joyfully whistling up in the train barn or tunnel entrance, Chuuby is a merry resident of Runamuck Park and the essence of his happy surroundings. This multi-talented '''song-and-dance bird''' has aspirations of one day performing on the big stage!"''

===Background ===
Chuuby is an orange cartoon bird who lives in ''Runamuck Park''. He lives in the train barn by the Runamuck Railroad station and is very friendly to guests; often trying to entertain them.

===Development History===
Chuuby was an original character created for the attraction ''Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway''.  According to Disney imagineer Kevin Rafferty, Chuuby was originally intended to be named, "Chubby" but there was a typo during one of the development meetings and they all found the name Chuuby much more endearing. The three baby birds hatched from the eggs in the train barn loop are named the "Chuubettes". 

==Appearances ==

On this attraction, Chuuby is encountered '''twice'''.  Chuuby is first seen at the beginning of the ride, overtop of the train tunnel in the first room after loading. The second time you encounter Chuuby is as you exit the main-ride into the unload area.  Here Chuuby is seen overhead, chirping and dancing to entertain you as you wait for your train to be the next to unload.
