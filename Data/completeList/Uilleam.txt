'''Uilleam''' is a character [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2010]] film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

==Role in the film==
Uilleam has a very minor role in the film. He is one of the [[Underland]] residents that tries to determine whether the [[Nivins McTwisp|White Rabbit]] indeed found the right [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]]. But in the chaos of the attack by the [[Red Queen]]'s forces, he is one of the characters captured and only appears briefly in the court of the Red Queen afterwards. It is unknown what happened to Uilleam afterwards, even after the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]] tells all of the people working for the Red Queen in a plan to fight against her for her betrayal.

==Trivia==
*Uilleam is the last character to be played by [[Michael Gough (English actor)|Michael Gough]]. Gough died of pneumonia and prostrate cancer at the old age of 94 in [[2011]], a year after ''Alice in Wonderland'' was released.
*The English Audio Description for ''Alice in Wonderland'' (included in the UK home release of the film) describes Uilleam having a plump ostrich-like body. In real life despite both of the species being flightless birds, ostriches and dodos both belong to a different group of flightless birds.
