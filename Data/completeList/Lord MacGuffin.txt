==Background==

=== Personality ===
Strapping Lord MacGuffin is full of brawn and dignity. Though a man of few words, his deep voice resounds across the land demanding respect and contributing to his reputation as the most even-handed and reasonable Lord in the kingdom. Even so, like his fellow Lords, MacGuffin isn’t opposed to a first-rate brawl or full-throated belly laugh. He wants his son to win [[Merida|Princess Merida's]] hand in marriage.

==Trivia==
*Lord MacGuffin is the only Lord to have a mustache and beard, his hair and mustache tied up. And to appear larger and wider than the others almost like [[King Fergus]].
*Lord MacGuffin may have a wife (Lady MacGuffin).
*He must have at least one other son, since he presented [[Young MacGuffin]] as his "eldest" son rather than "only" son.
