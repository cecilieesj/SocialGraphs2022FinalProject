'''Rotocelli''' is a one-time character and antagonist from the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[Color Me Gummi]]".

==History==
He is an artist who longs to show that his art is unparalleled. After [[Cavin]] brings one of [[Gusto Gummi]]'s lifelike paintings to [[Dunwyn Castle]], Cavintels to tell [[King Gregor]] that he painted it himself in order to keep the [[Gummi Bears]] a secret. Rotocelli is extremely envious, and seeks to find out the truth behind it all.

When Rotocelli overhears a conversation between Cavin and Gusto, catches a glimpse of the bear, and gets his hands on an actual painting from Cavin, he rushes to tell King Gregor about the boy being a fraud. Cavin quickly downs a vial of [[Gummiberry Juice]] and shakes the carpet Rotocelli runs on to tattle, launching him into the air, and causing the painting to come down on him hard.

When Gregor awakes from the ruckus, Rotocelli tries to explain that a Gummi Bear had painted the portrait, but Gregor only sees Rotocelli as a thief and a vandal, since Cavin's painting is now ruined.

As a result, Gregor banishes Rotocelli from the kingdom.
