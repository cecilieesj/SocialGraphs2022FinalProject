==Trivia==
*Originally the Egret Couple was going to appear in [[Clair de Lune]] a segment that was going to be included for [[Fantasia]] but was cut from the final film due to Fantasia's length. A workprint of the original was discovered and ''Clair de Lune'' was restored in 1992, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra.''' '''It was included as a bonus feature''' '''in The Fantasia ''Anthology'' DVD in 2000.
