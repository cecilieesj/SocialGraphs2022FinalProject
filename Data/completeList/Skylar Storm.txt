{{Quote|There's a storm coming, Skylar Storm!|Skylar Storm catchphrase.}}

'''Skylar Storm''' is a character in the series, ''[[Mighty Med]]''.

To the general public she is a comic book character that [[Kaz]] and [[Oliver (Mighty Med)|Oliver]] like. In reality, like many comic book characters, Skylar Storm is not imaginary, but a real person. It turns out she is in the hospital because all of her powers have been taken away by the "comic book" villain, The Annihilator. She regained her powers, but has ended up as the Annihilator's evil servant.

==Summary==
Skylar has faced off with some of the most fearsome villains in the world. Beware to anyone who treats her as "just another pretty face"!

==Personality==
Skylar Storm is a "comic book" superhero who doesn't give up easily. She lost her powers because her nemesis, The Annihilator, took them away from her. Even though she has lost her powers she doesn't like to believe so. Once she tried to lift up a weight thinking that her powers would be restored but they weren't. Skylar sometimes helps Kaz and Oliver with their errands because she is bored without her powers.

Sometimes Skylar gets angry when people don't listen to her or things don't go the way she wanted to but she can be loyal and a good friend. Skylar is shown to care a lot about others, especially Oliver, and tries to do as much as she can do to help her friends.

==Secret Identity==
Since Skylar does not have her powers anymore, she tries to fit into the human world and asks Kaz for help. In the human world Kaz made up for her from nearby school posters the name "Connie Valentine", which she kept. In this alter-ego, "Connie" dresses as an average teenage girl in order to hide her true identity.

As time goes on, "Connie's" backstory gets filled from incidental incidents, mostly while trying to cover for everyone who know who she really is not always being on the same page regarding her normo cover story. Details which include:
*Mighty Med Chief of Staff Doctor Horace Diaz poses as her father "Mr. Horace Valentine".
**He likes to be called "Daddy" or "Pop Pop".
*Her full name is "Connecticut Valentine".
**Her "Father" refuses to call her "Connie", instead insisting on using her "full name".
*She has twin younger sisters "Virginia" and "West Virginia".
*Alan is a yet-unspecified relative.

==Powers==
*'''Calderan Physiology'''
**'''Acid Spit'''
**'''Weather Adaption'''
**'''Superhuman Senses'''
**'''Limb Regrowth'''
* '''X-Ray Vision'''
* '''Explosion Induction'''
* '''Heat Vision/Laser Vision'''

==Trivia==

*She's part of the school marching band.
*On her planet, corner means oven and when she was late she had to stand inside it.
*On her planet, the gesture of "peek-a-boo baby" is a marriage proposal.
**A swift roundhouse kick to the head is "no" to the proposal.

*As of Lab Rats VS. Mighty Med, she is shown to have a slight crush on Oliver.
