The '''Muse''' visits [[Charlene Sinclair]] in the third season ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[[Charlene's Flat World]]". His face was operated by [[John Kennedy]], his body was puppeteered by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Leif_Tilden Leif Tilden] and his voice was provided by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Picardo Robert Picardo]. He was made from the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Turtlepuss Turtlepuss] Unisaur.

A dinosaur outfitted with angel wings, the muse is the spirit of creativity and has brought Charlene an original idea--that [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Earth the Earth] is round like an orange and not flat as widely accepted.

Unfortunately, the Muse miscalculated, as the idea had in fact been intended for [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Copernicus Copernicus] in 16th Century Poland. Due to the muse's incompetence, the Polish astronomer ends up with Charlene's brownie recipe and Charlene finds herself on trial for heresy.

In [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Greek_Mythology Greek mythology], the Muses are goddesses who inspire artistic works.{{MuppetsWiki}}{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}
