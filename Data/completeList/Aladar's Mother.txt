'''Aladar's Mother''' is a minor character in Disney's [[2000]] CGI animated film ''[[Dinosaur]]''.

==Role in the film==
Aladar's mother was an [[Iguanodon]] taking care of her nest that was filled with eggs, scaring off a [[baby Parasaurolophus]] at one point when it sniffed one of her eggs. Suddenly, a [[Carnotaurus|Carnotaur]] appeared from the woods and started chasing all of the dinosaurs present in the [[Nesting Grounds]]. The Iguanodon tried to resist as much as she could with her nest, but the Carnotaur was coming so fast that she was forced to flee with the others. In the ensuing chaos, one dinosaur was killed and many eggs were destroyed. Only one of the eggs survived the attack; this egg was taken by an [[Oviraptor]], but it ultimately dropped it into a river as it was fighting against another Oviraptor for claim of the egg. The egg was eventually picked up by a [[Pteranodon]] as it flew far away to [[Lemur Island|an island]] and ended up dropping the egg. The baby hatched here and was raised by a lemur family consisting of [[Plio]], [[Yar]], [[Suri]] and [[Zini]]. Plio is the one who named the baby [[Aladar]].

It is unknown whether or not she was alive by the time Aladar arrived at the herd.
