}}The '''Bride of Nine Spiders''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', played by Jane Kim. A brilliant scientist named Alessa, she is now the queen of the Kingdom of the Spiders, a realm located near the sewers of New York. Her mastery of chi lets her control spiders and gives her superhuman strength and durability.

Alessa was conducting research in her lab on spiders when she was interrupted by the arrival of an invitation from the hand to participate in Madame Gao's Tournament. Upon receiving the invitation she said to herself "The time has come."

At the Da Jue Zhan Alessa confronted Danny at his second opponent. Using seduction and playing mind games on him she was able to throw him off balance and distract him which allowed her to stick him with a poisoned needle that clouded his senses. Danny tried to fight back but she used her martial arts skills and needles to overwhelm him, all the while questioning and distracting him. As Danny was on the verge of defeat she prepared to finish him off. However Danny was able to recuperate from the poison and managed to knock her out with a kick to the head.
