After Timon and Pumbaa save Rabbit's life, Rabbit wants to repay the duo hand and foot, which annoys them. In order to get rid of Rabbit, Timon makes him go far away to get a glass of water. But the bunny immediately returns with a glass of water when Timon and Pumbaa are about to leave.

Come nighttime and Timon, Pumbaa, and Rabbit are sitting next to a fire. When Rabbit gives Timon and Pumbaa blankets, Timon and Pumbaa suggests that it's time to sleep. It's then revealed that the two are pretending to sleep and they sneak away from Rabbit as he's sleeping.

Pumbaa gets tied with a rope, with the rope hanging from the tree. Timon lights fire on the rope and he and Pumbaa cry for help to get Rabbit's attention. When Rabbit gets there, he realizes what's going on and he walks away. The rope then rips apart and Timon and Pumbaa fall but Rabbit returns with a giant glass of water for the two to land safely on.

After Timon helps Rabbit come out of his hat, the bunny is impressed and asks Timon to be part of his act. Timon decides to join Rabbit, but tells him that he should also let Pumbaa be part of his act and Rabbit agrees. While Timon and Rabbit do some tricks, Pumbaa ruins it. Rabbit gets fed up and suggests that he and Timon should get rid of the warthog, but Timon refuses to do so and he tells the bunny that the only way to get rid of him is to tell him that he no longer wants to be his friend, which gives Rabbit an idea.

Rabbit goes to Pumbaa and tells him that Timon no longer wants him to be part of their act and he also tells him that Timon no longer wants to be bestest best friends with him. Pumbaa becomes saddened by this and Rabbit poofs him to a frozen wasteland. When Timon shows up wondering where Pumbaa is, Rabbit tells the meerkat the exact same lie.

Pumbaa sneaks in the backstage area and lures Rabbit away from Timon with a carrot. Rabbit sees a trap, but kicks it away. He sees Pumbaa and taunts the warthog by calling him a pig. Pumbaa gets very angry and traps Rabbit in a cage.

Timon is now onstage and he fails to get a rabbit out of his hat. Pumbaa sees this and gets an idea. He strips off Rabbit's fur and disguises himself as a rabbit to help Timon. Timon and Pumbaa win the Serengeti Star Talent Contest, while naked Rabbit sulks sadly in his hat.
