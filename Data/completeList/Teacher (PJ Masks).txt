Since he is an adult, the teacher is much taller than his students. He has tan skin, short dark brown hair, and light brown eyes. He wears teal colored square glasses and a teal sweater vest covering a white and light blue striped shirt and a dark blue tie. He also wears dark blue pants with a brown belt.
