Matthew Ellis was listed as one of HYDRA's threats, and on Project Insights' list and prior to when they begin launching the Hellicarriers list to scratch off him and a number of individuals that pose a threat to HYDRA (including [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], and [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]]).

[[File:Ellisaos.png|thumb|250px|After the Battle for Sokovia, President Matthew Ellis commissions the ATCU.]]
Following the Battle of Sokovia and rise of the [[Inhumans]], President Matthew Ellis authorized the formation of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit, the replacement for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after its collapse when it was revealed too be infiltrated by HYDRA, with Rosalind Price in charge.

Two months after the death of Rosalind Price, at the hands of Grant Ward the President meet with [[Phil Coulson]] in Price's residence. Ellis informed him, that he couldn't allow the reauthorization of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] because its infiltration of [[HYDRA]] but ATCU (Advancement Threat Containment Unit) was its replacement for the Inhumans and HYDRA threat also that there wasn't enough proof too arrest Gideon Malick for the death of Price and was too powerful even for the President of the United States of America. However Coulson, was given full allowance working from the shadows.

President Ellis later directly contacted Phil and May at the Playground to inform them General Glenn Tablot is now replacing Price after her death as the head of the ATCU despite Coulson's concerns as they previously were enemies.

When, Bobbi and Lance were caught and arrested in Russia for "attempting" too assassinate Prime Minister of Russia on Coulson's request Ellis had Interpol step in and investigate the matter. The Prime Minister of Russia thinks they are Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D which Ellis denied it as the organization was dismantled in 2014 when it was revealed too be infiltrated by [[HYDRA]]. Bobbi and Lance were accused, while they actually saved his life.

After the Avengers Civil War and signing of the Sokovia Accords, President Matthew Ellis of the United States of America allowed the legitimization of S.H.I.E.L.D with the eradication of HYDRA and he and Phil Coulson chose Jeffery Mace who was an Inhuman that signed the Sokovia Accords and considered a hero when the public misinterpreted his actions during the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre.
