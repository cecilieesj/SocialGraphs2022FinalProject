'''King Jean-Claude''' is a character who appears in the TV Series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
He is [[Princess Marie]]'s father, whom he is very proud of. His kingdom is unnamed, though it is appears to be [[France|Frankish]] in nature as opposed to the [[England|Britannic]] basis for [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]].

At times, his kingdom is under siege by a rebel group commanded by the [[Marquis de Bouillabaisse]], a mirror image of how Dunwyn is regulartly threatened by [[Duke Igthorn]].

He does seem snooty in nature, such as when [[King Gregor]] marveled at a tapestry Marie had presented as a gift, Jean-Claude did not seem to show the same respect for a bird statue given to him in return. However, he kept his thoughts to himself and showed public gratitude to [[Princess Calla]].

When the truth is shown that Marie has been really rude and obnoxious to Calla, King Jean-Claude does not put up with that behavior and humbly apologizes to Gregor for the trouble.
