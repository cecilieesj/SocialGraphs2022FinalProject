She is the daughter of [[Pacha]] and [[Chicha]].

==Appearances==
===''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''===
Chaca first appears in this film with her younger brother [[Tipo]] during Pacha's return from his visit to [[Kuzco]]'s palace. They embrace their father warmly, and beg to stay awake past their bedtime, until being disturbed by the idea of having to watch their parents display affection.

Later on, Tipo awakens from a nightmare involving Pacha, waking Chicha and garnering the attention of Chaca, as well. Chicha assures Tipo that Pacha is fine, leading to a childish bickering session between them.

One day, the family is visited by the wickedÂ [[Yzma]], who claims to be a relative of Pacha. When Pacha informs Chihca that Yzma has villainous intents, the family bands together to humiliate and rid their home of her, which buys Pacha time, as he's on a mission to save Kuzco from Yzma's plot to take over the kingdom.

Chaca is last seen during the "[[Perfect World]]" reprise, where she and her family (along with her newborn brother [[Yupi]]) celebrate the salvation of their village home, as Kuzco has had a change of heart over the idea of demolishing the area in favor of building a summer resort.

===''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''===
Chaca plays a role in the sequel film, where she is featured as one of the campers in [[Kronk]]'s chipmunk troop.

===''[[The Emperor's New School]]''===
Chaca makes multiple appearances in the television series along with Tipo and Yupi, often assisting Kronk when he needs it. She is also said to be a student of Kuzco Academy. She played a significant role in "[[Faking the Grade]]", where she is revealed to be a straight-A student, though on one rare occasion, she receives all D's while Kuzco (the complete opposite of her intellect) receives all A's.
