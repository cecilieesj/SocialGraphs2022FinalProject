==Background==
===Development History===
John's character originated as an, "Electro-mechanical" man who would have been named '''Wilbur K. Watt'''. He was planned for the Edison Square expansion of [[Main Street, U.S.A. (Disneyland)|Main Street, U.S.A.]] where he would have hosted an attraction. It would have revolved around following the innovation of electrical technology over the different eras to benefit American life. This idea was scrapped but not forgotten.

The Carousel of Progress (or Progressland as it was originally called) was created for a sponsorship from General Electric to be featured in the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. The ideas for it were largely recycled from Edison Square with Wilbur K. Watt being transformed into the character of John; no longer explicitly a robot and rather made to be a convincing [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] replica of a human.

The Carousel of Progress would later be integrated in [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] at [[Disneyland]] in the Carousel Theatre for the New Tomorrowland integrations of [[1967]]. In [[1975]], it was moved to [[Tomorrowland (Magic Kingdom)|Tomorrowland]] at [[Walt Disney World]] at the behest of ride sponsors, General Electric. Over the years as new scripts, scenes and integrations have been implemented into it, John has changed voice-actors multiple times.

==Appearances==
===Carousel of Progress===
John is the host of the Carousel of Progress and the main singer in its theme song, "[[There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]]". The show (literally) revolves around him and his family living in different eras of America and highlighting the progress in technology which came with each one. Throughout the show he interacts with his family in the different settings.

In the original Disneyland version, John and his wife, Sarah, would have narrated a pre-show which would have shown a model of Progress City, [[Walt Disney]]'s [[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]].

==Trivia==
* John's face mold was also used in [[Epcot]]'s [[Spaceship Earth]] for a minstrel character.
