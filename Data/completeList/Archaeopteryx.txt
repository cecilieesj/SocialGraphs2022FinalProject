== Trivia ==
* In real life, Archaeopteryx is a dinosaur that has some features recognized in the modern birds. It is classified as a deinonychosaur, meaning that it is most closely related to Velociraptor and other Dromaeosaurs along with birds.
* In 2011, color was discerned in the feathers of Archaeopteryx by paleontologists through the examination of fossil pigments using an electron microscope and x-rays, making it one of the few dinosaurs for which color is actually known. Other dinosaurs for which color is known to include three or four species from China. Thus, it was shown that Archaeopteryx's true color was differing shades of black, much like the color of a crow or raven.
