==Background==
===Physical appearance===
[[Pluto]]'s quin-puplets' design is much like Pluto's, though basically a smaller version of Pluto. Though the quin-puplets have a more circular head, and is chubbier. Almost all other things has him resemble their father. The quin-puplets ears also droop down straightly, are much shorter and have no collar.

In ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]'', the quin-puplets get blue, pink, red, purple and brown collars.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pluto's Quin-puplets]]''===
[[Pluto]] has to stay and watch the quin-puplets while [[Fifi the Peke|Fifi]] goes out for food. Not an easy job with five rambunctious pups who won't stay still, and end up fighting with an air hose and some spilled paint. Even more difficult when Pluto accidentally drinks moonshine.

Disillusioned with this, Fifi breaks up with Pluto, disowns both Pluto and the pups and leaves them out in the cold.

===''[[Pluto Junior]]''===
One of [[Pluto]]'s quin-puplets is named [[Pluto Junior (character)|Pluto Junior]], who wants to play and fight to the exasperation of Pluto who only wants to take a nap.

[[File:Quin-puplets in tire.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pluto's Quin-puplets in ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]].'']]The quin-puplets appeared in ''[[Thou Shalt Nut Steal]]'', making their first proper appearance in animation since their debut short in [[1937]]. In the short, [[Chip and Dale]] steal their nuts, leaving their [[Pluto|father]] to go after them.

Meanwhile, whenever Chip and Dale looked out their window, the quin-puplets were swinging in a tire from a tree, when a [[Beagle Boys|Beagle Boy]] stole their tire, leaving them on the ground. One of them started to play a harmonica, but the Beagle Boy stole that to.

[[File:Chip-n-dale-park-life-chip-pluto-dale-quin-puplets.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]Chip and Dale started to hallucinate and dream about the quin-puplets' sad faces causing them to feel guilt and return the nuts. Later, Chip and Dale decided to share the nuts with them and invite them to the tree they live in and soon, Pluto and the quin-puplets howl with joy for the redeemed chipmunks.

In ''[[Chipmunks Away]]'', one of the quin-puplets makes a cameo, drinking from a bird bath, alongside, their parents, Pluto and [[Fifi the Peke|Fifi]].

In ''[[Cone Alone]]'', one of the quin-puplets leaves the veterinarian office wearing a cone, and Pluto comforts it with gifts and attention.
