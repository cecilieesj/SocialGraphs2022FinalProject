'''Torgo''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series who appears in "[[Monster Massachusetts]]".

==Background==
Torgo was created by [[Dr. Cagliostro]] and became his assistant. He and Cagliostro lived in a tower in Massachusetts.

===Personality===
Being Dr. Cagliostro's assistant, Torgo is shown to be very loyal and obedient to his creator. He is ordered by Cagliostro to bring [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] to him in order to use the duo for their experiment. Despite his monstrous appearance, Torgo is deep down shown to have a good heart, as seen when Timon and Pumbaa convince him that Cagliostro will soon replace him with another monster. This makes him sad and very angry, making him want to destroy everything in the laboratory.

In addition to working for Cagliostro, Torgo's personal hobby is to hunt down helpless swamp rats. He is also shown to have a secret wishing place, which is a pile of straw in the dungeon.

Torgo is also shown to be very strict when it comes to anybody escaping Cagliostro's laboratory. This is shown when he grabs Timon and Pumbaa and tells them that he can be easily angered if they attempt to make an escape.

===Physical appearance===
Torgo is a gray monster with a head shaped like a tooth. He wears a yellow jacket, a black shirt, brown pants, and black boots. He has a nail on the side of his neck.

When Torgo is transformed into a female, her appearance is different from what she was as a monster. She is a slender and beautiful woman who has fair skin, and wears blur earrings, a red dress and black heels. She also has blue eyeshadow.

==Role in the series==
When Cagliostro is ready for his experiment, he orders Torgo to catch Timon and Pumbaa and bring them to him. When Torgo does so, Cagliostro tells the two friends that he is going to turn them into the world's most beautiful creatures. Timon then replies by telling the doctor that he is already beautiful, but Pumbaa could use some improvements. Therefore, Cagliostro puts Timon in a cage.

Pumbaa is getting ready to become beautiful and Torgo puts the warthog in the Metamorphitron, a machine created by Cagliostro. However, the Metamorphitron turns Pumbaa ugly instead of beautiful, much to Cagliostro's shock and depression as he realizes that his experiment failed. After telling Torgo to put Pumbaa in the cage with Timon, Cagliostro takes out a picture of Albert Einstein and asks him what he could have possibly overlooked. Albert Einstein "whispers" into Cagliostro's ear and tells him to check the math. Dr. Cagliostro tells Torgo that they have work to do and the two go upstairs.

Meanwhile, Timon and Pumbaa make a plan to turn Pumbaa back to normal and then escape the laboratory. After they succeed in getting out of the cage, while Pumbaa is getting turned back to normal, Timon gets caught by Torgo and tries to escape him.

After Pumbaa gets turned back to normal while Timon becomes ugly due to getting in the Metamorphitron in order to hide from Torgo, Torgo catches Timon and Pumbaa and forces the two to never try to escape again. Timon makes a plan to have Torgo be on their side in order to be turned back to his meerkat self. He tries to convince Torgo that since they are both mutants, they should team up and try to defeat Cagliostro, but Torgo refuses, saying that he is loyal to the doctor since he was created by him.

Timon then convinces Torgo that Cagliostro will replace, much to his sadness. Torgo then gets infuriated and decides to destroy everything in the lab, starting with the Metamorphitron. Timon tries to stop since it is the only thing that will change him back to normal. When Cagliostro finds Torgo destroying the Metamorphitron and tries to get him to stop, the laboratory explodes and Torgo turns into a beautiful woman. This makes Cagliostro fall in love and decide to marry her and become the happiest man on earth.

==Trivia==
*Torgo is based on the creature from Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''.
*Although Torgo is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]], his role is sometimes falsely attributed to the voice actor [[Jim Cummings]]. As a female, Torgo is voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].
*Torgo's name may have some allusion to the manservant from the infamous bad movie ''Manos: The Hands of Fate'', although this is not proven.
