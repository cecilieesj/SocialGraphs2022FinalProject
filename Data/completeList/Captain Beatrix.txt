'''Captain Beatrix''' is a character from the 2019 series ''[[Amphibia]]''. She is [[Captain Grime]]'s older sister and a lord of Amphibia's western Toad Tower.

== Background ==
=== Physical Appearance ===
Beatrix is a large vicious looking toad with black hair and a purple and ochre military uniform. Like her brother, Beatrix has a scarred eye, but it is her left eye that is scarred which consists of a pale purple color.

=== Personality ===
According to Grime, she is the toughest Toad warrior in all of Amphibia and she is also well versed in the art of warfare. She absolutely loves making fun of her brother, possibly to get back at him for all the times he teased her during their childhood and seeing his rank within the Toad Army lower than hers. There are times where Beatrix acts condescending towards Grime, showing she does have some care and respect towards her brother.

== Role in the series ==
Beatrix is older sister of [[Captain Grime]] who would tease her quite often ever since they were tadpoles. Growing up, Beatrix trained in combat and because a captain and lord of the western Toad Tower in Amphibia, but she and Grime continue to tease each other even with Beatrix openly taunting her brother every chance she got.

[[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]], Grime, [[Percy (Amphibia)|Percy]] and [[Braddock]] arrive at the Toad summit to pitch their idea of taking over [[Newtopia]] and [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]]. Everyone likes the idea, but do not want Grime to lead. Sasha impulsively takes the challenge of acquiring Barrel's Warhammer to prove their worth. Despite Percy and Braddock saying they should quit if things got too dangerous, Sasha ignores their pleas and together they face a giant worm to get the hammer back and to prove that she can make it without [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] or [[Marcy Wu|Macry]]. They are successful, but Percy and Braddock leave, unwilling to work with Sasha due to her not caring about their safety and well-being.

After [[King Andrias]]' true motives were known, Beatrix later sent a letter to Grime that she and the toads with her evaded capture. She later offers her services to help the resistance if [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] can beat her. If he wins, her army will join their army. If she wins, they all join her army as cannon fodder. Sprig manages to defeat Beatrix in a cage match.
