==History==
===Background===
Timekeeper is a eccentric scientist from M.I.T.T. (Metropolis Institute of Time Travel), who by inspiration from the works of [[Jules Verne]] and [[H.G. Wells]], builds a time machine, presenting his invention at venues such as the Visionarium in [[Discoveryland]] and Metropolis Science Center in [[Tomorrowland (Magic Kingdom)|Tomorrowland]].

With the help of his assistant, [[9-Eye]], Timekeeper was able to transport himself and the guests to different times in Earth's past, present, and future.

===Development History===
Timekeeper was designed specifically with [[Robin Williams]] in mind when the attraction was first developed for [[Disneyland Paris]]. However, French officials insisted on it featuring a French dub, resulting in Williams only being heard as Timekeeper when it was brought to the [[Magic Kingdom]].  Timekeeper's design would later be recycled for [[Tom Morrow]] at [[Disneyland]]'s version of [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]].

== Appearances ==

=== [[Skipper Canteen]] ===
In the library of the ''[[Jungle Navigation Company|Jungle Navigation Co]]. Ltd. Skipper Canteen'' is a book titled, "Keeping Time" by '''Williams''', referencing the character of the Timekeeper.

=== The Timekeeper ===

=== Rockettower Plaza ===
Timekeeper made a cameo in the show ''Stitch's Supersonic Celebration''.  Here, he alongside 9-Eye and [[Tom Morrow 2.0]] were shown being sold off by RoboMart, a subsidiary of the evil corporation [[X-S Tech]].

== Trivia ==

* The Timekeeper's employers at the Metropolis Institute of Time Travel are likely a reference to the influential [[1927]] German-expressionist science-fiction film ''Metropolis'', directed by Fritz Lang.
