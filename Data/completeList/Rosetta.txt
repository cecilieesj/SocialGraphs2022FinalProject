'''Rosetta''' is the talented garden fairy from the popular ''[[Disney Fairies]]'' franchise. [[Fairies]] will never tell their age, of course, but Rosetta introduced in [[Pixie Hollow]] before most of her friends, making her a bit wiser than the others. Older too, but she certainly does not look it.

==Background==
===Personality===
Rosetta is a garden-talented fairy who is gentle and well mannered but also has a quick wit and a handful of charm. Rosetta shares a sassy streak with [[Tinker Bell]], and always tries to look her best and loves giving beauty tips and makeovers to her friends, flowers, and animals. She is girly and speaks with a Southern accent. She is close friends with Fawn and Silvermist. She is the main protagonist in Tinker Bell and the Pixie Hollow Games and serves as the tritagonist in ''Tinker Bell, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure'', ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue'', and ''Secret of the Wings''.

Fairies never age, of course, but since Rosetta arrived in Pixie Hollow before most of her friends, she is presumed to be a little wiser than the others. It is revealed in ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue'' that she dislikes mud, despite being a garden fairy. She tends to become guilty of judging a book by its cover. In ''The Pirate Fairy'', Rosetta temporarily becomes an animal fairy, much to her dismay.

===Physical appearance===
Rosetta has red wavy longer-length hair, green eyes, red lips and fair skin. She wears a red dress that resembles flower petals. In her original design, Rosetta wore a similar dress, but with a light pink sweetheart bodice.

==Appearances==
===''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]''===
As the other fairies and sparrow men, Rosetta was introduced at Tinker Bell's arrival. Rosetta, [[Iridessa]], [[Fawn]], and [[Silvermist]] first befriend Tinker Bell after the fairy accidentally crashes her mouse-bound cart as a result of a Sprinting Thistle attack. After comforting the tinker, Clank and Bobble arrive with new supplies for the fairies forthcoming trip to the Main Land. Rosetta and the others showcase their magnificent abilities by testing out the new supplies, leaving Tinker Bell at admiration. This gives the tinker the appeal to go to the mainland, but tinker fairies are banned to go as there is no reason.

In an attempt to travel to the mainland, Tink decides to switch her talent, something that has never been done before. She goes to Rosetta and the others for help, but the friends feel Tinker Bell should accept her destiny. However, like her friends, Rosetta decides to help, and an array of other tests occurs. Despite the effort, all the attempts fail. After a while, Rosetta and her friends witness Tink repair a music box, proving her talent is correct. Even so, Tink still wants to change her talent and goes to the evil Vidia as a final result. Vidia tricks the tinker into trying to round up the Sprinting Thistles, which ends up destroying Pixie Hollow's preparations for spring.

Tinker Bell creates new ways to repair things after having a talk with Terence. He makes her realize that being a tinker is what she's destined to become. Rosetta stands by Tink's side and uses her inventions, and spring is finally free. At the end, Rosetta and the others travel to the mainland as planned, having Tinker Bell, Clank, and Bobble tag along to return the repaired music box to [[Wendy Darling|its rightful owner]].

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]''===
Rosetta plays a smaller role in the sequel. She is first seen with other garden fairies continuing with her real duties. Later on, Rosetta is taking a flight with Iridessa and Silvermist when Tinker Bell appears and asks for their doses of pixie dust. Unfortunately for Tink, Rosetta and the others need their pixie dust to travel to the mainland. Rosetta is lastly seen during the end when the fairies celebrate the arrival of the blue harvest moon.

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue]]''===

Summer has arrived and many of Pixie Hollow's fairies and sparrow men have traveled to the mainland to attend fairy camp. Rosetta also attends, flying there with Tink, Silvermist, Iridessa, and Fawn. After a while, Vidia reveals the presence of humans to Tink in an attempt to keep her away. Tink becomes infatuated, but Iridessa and Rosetta try to explain that humans are dangerous. Later on, Rosetta and the others learn that Tinker Bell has been captured by a human girl named [[Elizabeth Griffiths|Lizzy]]. Vidia then leads an expedition to rescue her.

Along the way, the fairies are forced to cross a muddy river. While the river is not too deep, Rosetta is hesitant to cross, revealing her fear of mud (while revealing the irony as she's a Garden Fairy). Eventually, the adventure leads them to Lizzy's house, but Vidia is captured by Lizzy's father and taken to London for research. Rosetta and the others go after them granting pixie dust on Lizzy so they can fly to her father, as they cannot fly in the rain. When they finally do approach Lizzy's father, the young girl convinces her father to rethink his actions. Vidia is freed, and the fairies have a picnic with Lizzy and her father to celebrate.

In this film, Rosetta develops a fussier, mud-hating personality that defines the character in the upcoming animation work.

===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===
[[File:Rosetta1.jpg|thumb|250px|Rosetta in ''Pixie Hollow Games''.]]
Rosetta is the main protagonist of the television special. Here, the Pixie Hollow Games have arrived and Rosetta is chosen to represent the garden-talented fairies along with a newcomer named [[Chloe (fairy)|Chloe]]. Unlike Chloe, Rosetta is fully aware of the garden fairies' position of not winning the games (or even coming close to winning). Chloe scoffs at that position and is still determined to break the streak. Rosetta's pride is emphasized once again, as her refusal to get dirty or be athletic has her avoiding "Pixie Hollow Games" duty every single year until the garden-talents combine forces in order to force her to play. Now teaming up along with the eager newly-arrived fairy Chloe, Rosetta is upset about the situation and fails horribly.

In the first competition, Rosetta shows up in a beautiful dress, wanting to look good despite looking bad. However, the healing-talented fairies could not finish the competition, allowing Rosetta and Chloe to move forward. When she sees how much winning means to Chloe, Rosetta usually makes a real attempt at winning. Throughout the next challenges, the garden fairies usually get through, but when it comes to a slide of slug slime, Rosetta's fear of getting dirty gets the best of her, knocking her team to the final place. At the final competition, Rosetta decides to brush her fear of dirt off, and the team successfully wins the games, finally breaking the losing streak.

In this story, Rosetta adds in the hard work, gives up constantly looking fashionable, and usually gets dirty. Showing more sides to her, she is guilt-ridden for adding the garden talents in the last place after avoiding the slug-slime slide. Ultimately, her clever thinking and inventiveness give the garden-talents their first-ever trophy in the Games.

===''[[Secret of the Wings]]''===
[[File:Foto-rosetta-en-campanilla-el-secreto-de-las-hadas-2-037.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rosetta in ''Secret of the Wings''.]]
On an ordinary day, Rosetta is blooming flowers while Tinker Bell and Fawn are helping animals cross the border to the Winter Woods. Later on, after Tinker Bell crossed the border and froze her wings, Rosetta, Iridessa, and Silvermist rush to the doctor to pick up Tink. Tink then decides to tell her friends that her wings began to glow after she crossed. However, Rosetta finds the claims to be eccentric and fears that Tink needs to be examined by the healing fairies again. Even so, Tinker Bell crosses once more and meets her sister Periwinkle. To have Periwinkle visit the warm regions of Pixie Hollow, Tink plans on creating a snowmaking machine. Clank gathers Rosetta and the others to begin work on said machine.

The next day, Tink's friends begin "Operation: Periwinkle" where they showcase their unique talents for the frost fairy. Rosetta blossoms an entire flower field for the first fairy and gives her a periwinkle flower as a gift. Periwinkle then preserved the flower in a frost blanket to not die when she travels back to the Winter Woods. Periwinkle suddenly becomes weak, and her wings begin to decay. Rosetta and the others rush her across the border, and the ruler of the Winter Woods, Lord Milori, forbids Tink and Peri from seeing one another again. Overnight, the snowmaker machine began to freeze parts of Pixie Hollow, thus throwing off the seasons.

Rosetta and the others evacuate to the Pixie Dust Tree as shelter. However, the Pixie Dust Tree is also in danger of being destroyed, but Tink thinks of a way to save it. If Peri and the frost fairies can preserve the tree, like she did the flower, Pixie Hollow would be saved. While Rosetta and the others take cover inside one of the Pixie Dust Tree's hollows, Peri and the others preserve it.

When the ice melts, the pixie dust returns, and all is well. The warm fairies are then allowed to cross the border to the Woods.

===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''===
Rosetta appears in the fifth film, where she and her friends magically switch talents. Rosetta becomes an animal fairy, much to her dismay, and becomes the mother of a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|baby crocodile]]. Worse, Fawn (who became a light fairy) accidentally fires the part of her hair off, though Rosetta is unaware of this until the end.

[[File:Rosetta'sdressmessdisney.jpeg|thumb|250px|Artwork of Rosetta in ''Rosetta's Dress Mess''.]]
In ''Beck and the Great Berry Battle'', Rosetta had been asked by Beck to help make umbrellas for other fairies. She and the other garden fairies exchanged old umbrellas for new ones to help aid in the relief of the Berry Battle.

At the beginning of ''A Masterpiece for Bess'', she appears when Tinker Bell shows everyone the portrait Bess had painted of her. Later, Rosetta asks Bess to paint a portrait of her. When it is finished, she asks Bess to fix her nose, which you should not ask an art-talented fairy. In the end, she asked Hem to make her a dress, which was the newest fad.

Rosetta appears in Tink, North of Never Land, when she sits next to Terence during Tor's story. When music comes on, she makes Terence dance with her.

She appears briefly in ''Silvermist and the Ladybug Curse'', playing games with the other fairies at the fairy picnic.

In ''Rosetta's Daring Day'', she gets Fawn to help her with a noisy squirrel. The squirrel was just trying to warn them of a forest fire. Fawn and Rani helped put it out. Rosetta did nothing to help. A party is announced in honor of Fawn and the others. At first, Fawn did not want to go, but Rosetta made a deal with her that she will do whatever she wants if Fawn goes. Rosetta had a poor time at the party, and the first thing Fawn makes her do is frog-riding. Wet and unlucky, they decide to go cherry-picking, but Fawn got trapped in a mole hole. Rosetta faced her fears of worms and mud and pulled Fawn out. Queen Clarion gave her a medal and acclaimed her for facing her fears.

She appears briefly in ''Four Clues for Rani'', standing next to Beck on the day of the Fairy Treasure Hunt.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Pixiehollow13.jpg|thumb|250px|Rosetta at one of the Disney parks.]]
A topiary of Rosetta was featured during the [[Epcot]] Flower and Garden International Festival. In the Spring of 2010, Rosetta was featured in Fairies Primavera at [[Tokyo DisneySea]].

She used to greet guests at Disneyland until the discontinuation of the Disney Fairies franchise. As a result of this, Rosetta is not meeting in the Disney Parks recently, and thus, is a rare character.

==Trivia==
*[[Megan Hilty]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]], who have both voiced Rosetta, have both portrayed [[Glinda the Good Witch of the South|Glinda the Good Witch]] in ''Wicked''.
**In ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]'', Rosetta mentions that she "never works with poppies, the pollen makes her sleepy" - a trait of the [[Poppy Fields|poppies]] in the ''Wizard of Oz'' and ''Wicked'', in which both [[Megan Hilty]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]] have performed as Glinda.
