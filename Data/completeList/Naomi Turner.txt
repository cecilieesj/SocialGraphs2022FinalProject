'''Naomi Turner''' is a major character who appears in the [[2016]] [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. She is an adventurer and is [[Princess Elena|Elena's]] best friend.

==Background==
===Personality===
Naomi is a practical girl who never gives up. Unlike [[Chancellor Esteban]], Naomi approves of Elena's take-charge approach and is shown to have a dislike of the snooty Chancellor. She at first had a fear of riding the [[Jaquins]], but she quickly overcame her fear after her first ride.

===Physical appearance===
Naomi is a fair-skinned teenage girl with a slender figure and deep aqua blue eyes. She has short blonde hair and faint freckles across her cheeks.

Naomi's signature outfit includes a deep bluish-green bodice with strong green lining and is decorated with flowers at the bottom that go over a white top. She wears a brilliant green skirt with a deep bluish-green strip that goes around the lower part. She has black boots and wears around her waist a dark red belt. Around Naomi's neck, she wears a patchwork choker necklace decorated with three turquoise gemstones dangling from the front. Around her left arm, Naomi wears a braided cord bracelet with similar gemstones on her necklace.

==Role in the series==
In the prologue of ''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]'', Elena shows Naomi [[Shuriki]]'s broken wand and tells her the story of how [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] freed Elena from the [[Amulet of Avalor]]. In the ending of the special after hearing the story, Naomi and Elena decide to lock Shuriki's wand in the treasury.

Naomi is a supporting character in the series and serves as a member of the Grand Council of Avalor, which Elena has chosen for her pragmatism and perseverance. She is also uniquely suited to represent the average civilians' interests when deciding how to run the kingdom. Through the show, Naomi often accompanies Elena on her adventures and assists her in Royal Duties in any way she can.

Since she lived and worked at the port all her life, Naomi is very skilled with ropes, knots, and nets. This makes her a bit stronger than an average female. She also has an eye for detail, such as noticing two warning glyphs in one episode. Like Sofia's struggles to prove herself a princess, Naomi believes she must work hard to prove herself as a member of the Grand Council because of her commoner status.

She later left Avalor to travel the seas on her own in "[[The Last Laugh]]", but returned in "[[Giant Steps]]" to help Elena when she learned of the danger [[Ash Delgado]] and Esteban posed with the new allies they were making. After working together with Elena, Gabe, Mateo, and the Jaquins to stop Kizin after causing Kizin to injure Elena with breaking her arm, Naomi decides to stay in Avalor, and Elena welcomes her back with open arms.

When Quita Moz visits Avalor to suggest Elena seek the help of Ixlan the Lightning Warrior to aid her against Ash and Esteban, Naomi goes with her when they decide to have Victor and Carla help them, despite Elena's own misgivings and distrust of them due to their past actions with Shuriki and Ash. Though they free Ixlan, they are swallowed by Ixlan's guardian that kept her imprisoned, the Moyacu. When Elena refuses to return Victor and Carla their tamberitias to help them escape, Carla calls her out on her distrust of them putting them in their current situation, and upon being reminded by Naomi of what Quita Moz said about trust, Elena finally agrees to put her distrust of the Delgados behind her. Once they all escape and return to Avalor, Victor and Carla are pardoned for their previous crimes and join Naomi and a fully-healed Elena with preparing to face Ash and Esteban, with Victor and Carla wanting their own revenge against Ash for choosing power over their family.

By the time of Elena's official coronation as Queen in "[[Coronation Day]]", Elena is soon called away to Nueva Vista and Coronado to deal with Ash and Esteban. Naomi comes with her, and due to her having put her grudge against the Sirenas aside previously, she is able to help Marisa subdue and capture all of Ash's allies, sans Esteban. When Elena is pulled into the Spirit World with Ash, Naomi returns to Avalor to prepare for the attack by Esteban and the [[Four Shades of Awesome]] under Isabel's leadership. When Elena returns from being released from the Spirit World after losing a match of Olaball against Ash, Naomi joins her in taking down two more of the Four Shades after Isabel's leadership took down the first one. However, when Cahu the Time Shade turns Gabe and Mateo to stone, Elena has Naomi take Isabel to safety before the same fate can befall them while she and Skylar lure Cahu back towards the Royal Palace. Naomi is later relieved with Isabel when Elena's forgiveness of Esteban allows her magic to undo the Four Shades' effects across Avalor, restoring Gabe and Mateo to flesh and blood. After Elena and Esteban destroy Cahu's hourglass, stripping her of her powers, and banish her back to the Spirit World to join the other three Shades. Naomi attends Elena's coronation with many other guests, with the last of them being Sofia the First and her family from Enchancia. Once Elena is officially crowned Queen, she dubs Naomi her new Chancellor. Naomi is hesitant to accept, but with the approval of both Esteban, the former Chancellor, and Dona Paloma, who had coveted the position herself previously, she accepts. Naomi then joins in the celebratory dance that follows Elena's coronation.

==Trivia==
*As revealed in "[[The Tides of Change]]", Naomi never met her grandfather because his ship was sunk by sirenas before she was born. That was also the reason why she hated sirenas and didn't trust them until she realized she was wrong about them.
*Naomi's face and hairstyle change very slightly as of "[[My Fair Naomi]]" to match her 2D-illustration appearance.
