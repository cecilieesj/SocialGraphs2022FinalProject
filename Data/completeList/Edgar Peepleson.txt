'''Edgar Allan Peepleson''' is a supporting character in [[Disney Junior]]'s ''[[Vampirina]]''. He is [[Poppy Peepleson]]'s twin brother, [[Edna Peepleson]]'s son and [[Vampirina Hauntley]]'s neighbor and friend. In "[[Ghoul Guides Save the Day!]]", he becomes the third human to learn about Vee's true nature and the existence of monsters after [[Bridget (Vampirina)|Bridget]].

He is interested in all things supernatural, and uses his smartphone to film anything potentially interesting onto his web show "Weekly Weirdness". As a result, Vampirina and her parents try their best to keep their true identity as a vampire a secret so they can continue to live a normal life.
