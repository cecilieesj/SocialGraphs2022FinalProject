==Role in the film==
The fearsome, unsightly man is first seen at the beginning of the film when Richelieu confronts a prisoner for stealing from a coach to feed his family. Ugly stands behind the prisoner menacingly after the peasant was violently flogged by another guard, prior to the prisoner's murder by [[Captain Rochefort]].

He is later seen when the Musketeers attack and try to save King Louis. Richelieu takes the King and Queen down through the dungeons to escape. As they proceed, they pass Ugly who is carrying the body of a prisoner that he possibly killed. Richelieu orders the hulk to prevent the Musketeers from pursuing them and Ugly violently throws down the prisoner and obliges.

He confronts Porthos in a torture chamber and attacks Porthos with a sword, but the Musketeer disarms the guard and then burns the man's rear end with a fire poker. Yelling and growling, Ugly punches Porthos down and grabs hold of him. Porthos then shoves him against a wall of spikes, two of which impale Ugly's back, apparently killing him.

However, Ugly is still alive and begins roaring in agony and fury, much to Porthos' horror. Porthos then closes the mechanism, crushing the man against the spiked wall and finally putting an end to him.
