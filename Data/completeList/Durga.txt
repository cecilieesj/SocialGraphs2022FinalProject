==Role in the short film==
Though she is seen on one of the prayer shrines in Sanjay's house and as a statue in the Hindu temple which Ravana takes two swords from the statue of Durga, she does not make a physical appearance until the climax of the film where she and the other two deities [[Hanuman]] and [[Vishnu]] come alive and fight against the evil monster [[Ravana]] after Sanjay ignites the wick on the large diya using his action figure. When Ravana throws several swords at Sanjay and the deities, Durga summons a tiger to protect Sanjay as it successfully counters all the swords. She and the other two deities use a bell which is the same one used by his father to stall Ravana. Soon as Sanjay defeats Ravana, Durga and the other deities feel proud that he defeated the monster as she and the other deities transform back into statues.
