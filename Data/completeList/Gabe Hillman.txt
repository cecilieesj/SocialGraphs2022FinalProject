Gabe appears in the [[Destined|third episode]], present at the Mehndi party, hosted in the Khan house. A traditional custom is to take a pair of the grooms shoes, but Gabe decides to hide all of them. When [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] leaves his room to report that his shoes have been taken, the partygoers begin to laugh at Gabe's actions.

The day of the wedding arrives and the party is held at a venue. Everyone takes part in celebrations and Gabe participates in a Bollywood dance number, along with family, in a [[Hulk]] costume, created by Aamir's mother, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]]. They are later forced to exit the building, alongside the other partygoers, when the fire alarm is triggered.
