'''Cassandra Bleem''' is a minor guest character of Disney's ''[[Disney's Doug|Doug]]''. She is voiced by Melissa Greenspan.

==Biography==
She is a superficial eighth grader who appears in "[[Doug's Older Woman]]" where [[Doug Funnie]] asked her on a date. However, during the date, Doug heard her say hurtful and mean things about Patti and realized she was bad news. Doug realized she only asked him out so he could make a fool of himself in front of her friends. She is by far, the most antagonistic character on the show. At the end of the episode, she dances with Al and Moo and thinks they're funny.
