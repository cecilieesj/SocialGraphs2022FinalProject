}}The '''Ice Cream Man''' is a character who is the center of a running gag throughout the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. He is an overweight, sunburned (except for where he sometimes wears a tank top) man who wears sunglasses, swim trunks, and flip flops. Whenever he appears, his ice cream drops from its cone before he can finish it. He is currently nameless and mute, except in "[[Swirly (episode)|Swirly]]" when he clucks like a chicken after being hypnotized by [[Swirly]] as well as in "[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]" when he yells after tripping over 151's pod and crying after [[Babyfier]] turns him into a baby.
