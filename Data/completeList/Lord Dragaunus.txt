'''Dragaunus'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0082584/</ref> is the leader of the Saurians and the main antagonist in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|The Mighty Ducks]]''.

==Background==
Dragaunus is an evil [[Dragons|dragon]]-like saurian that can breathe fire. He is not above working with humans or even aliens in his quest for world domination, he doesn't take kindly to the failures of his cronies, [[Siege]], [[Chameleon]] and [[Wraith]], Dragaunus has lost faith in the Saurian dark magic which Wraith uses and only when somewhat desperate, will he allow Wraith to employ them in a major part of his latest plan.

Otherwise, the main tools he equips himself and his henchmen with are teleporters, rays, blasters, rockets, and cloaking devices. Most of Dragaunus' schemes involve trying to create an alternative fuel source for his flagship, the Raptor.

Dragaunus' ultimate defeat was never seen since the ''Mighty Ducks'' TV series never got to a second season; therefore Dragaunus' fate has remained unknown.
