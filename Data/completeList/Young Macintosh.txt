He is the son of [[Lord Macintosh]], and one of the suitors competing for [[Merida|Princess Merida]]â€™s hand in marriage.

==Personality ==
Ryan Macintosh is confident in himself and his abilities to the point of arrogance. He is also (like his father) prone to acting melodramatic and does not react well to failure, or even being second best. However, Ryan Macintosh is otherwise a nice person, shown by his loyalty to his father, and his apparent friendship with [[Young MacGuffin]] and [[Wee Dingwall]].
==Appearances==

=== [[Brave|''Brave'']] ===
As the heir to the [[Clan Macintosh]], Ryan Macintosh became one of the three suitors for Princess Merida. During his introduction, he showed his bravado by expertly maneuvering with his sword, then flexing while striking a pose to impress Merida, though she was plainly disgusted by him. He took place in the archery contest, and threw a temper tantrum after missing the bullseye.

Later, during Merida's speech to the Lords about letting their children decide their own fate, Ryan Macintosh was the first suitor to agree wholeheartedly with the princess' idea. He took part with [[King Fergus]] in (unwittingly) hunting down [[Queen Elinor]] in her bear form, and was present when she returned to human form.

At the end of the film, he said goodbye to the other clans.

=== [[Once Upon a Time|''Once Upon a Time'']] ===

Set approximately 10 years after the events of ''Brave,'' Macintosh is the Lord of his clan. After Merida fails to save her father, King Fergus, from being killed, he unites and leads the clans with the new Lords[[Wee Dingwall| Dingwall]] and [[Young MacGuffin|MacGuffin]]. They kidnap [[Harris, Hubert, and Hamish]] and give Merida an ultimatum, the Lords will kill the brothers unless she abdicates from her throne. When Merida refuses to relinquish the crown, the Lords aim fire at the triplets, but are stopped by Merida who is able to save them from her. Macguffin then backs down along with the other Lords and give Merida back her crown.

=== The Fire Falls ===
Young Macintosh appears in this story where he and Merida are forced together and a wish gone wrong ends up wiping him of his memory. He and Merida spend the rest of the story on an adventure to reverse the magic. This is where his first name is revealed to be Ryan.
