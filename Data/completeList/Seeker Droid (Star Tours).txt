This '''Seeker Droid''' was a '''Prowler 1000 exploration droid''' or '''Prowler Probe Droid''' which appears in [[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]].

== History ==
=== Background ===
This droid was a prowler 1000 exploration droid which was utilized by the [[Galactic Empire]] at some point before the battle of Yavin. It was tasked with hunting down a rebel spy which was tracked down to [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]] Spaceport THX1138.

The probe droid and an ambush of sky-troopers and [[stormtroopers]] halted the passage of Star Tours Flight 1401, a [[StarSpeeder 1000]] being helmed by accident by one [[C-3PO]]. Thee stormtroopers held the speeder as the probe droid located the spy and found it was one of the ship's passengers. As a result, the ship went to hyperdrive while ramming into the seeker droid, pushing it into space.

=== Development History ===
Prowler 1000 Exploration Droids were created for Star Wars Episode III (2005) albeit as droids used by the [[Galactic Republic]] in the clone wars. They also made a number of expanded universe appearances leading up to Star Tours.

== Appearances ==
=== Star Tours: The Adventures Continue ===
The Seeker Droid appears in one of the two original opening scenes for Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. In its version of the scene it grabs onto the visor of the ship and holds a red screen which shows the faces of guests on it as it searches for the rebel spy.

Eventually it finds the spy (usually one of the guests) and encourages the sky-troopers to attack before the ride truly begins by ramming into the probe droid.

== Trivia ==
* It was identified as, "The Seeker Droid" by a [[2002]] Star Tours [[Star Wars: Star Tours (toy line)|toy-line]].
* One of the faces which flashes on the Seeker Droid's screen is that of [[George Lucas]].
