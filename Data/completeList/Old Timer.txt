|status=Active}}'''Old Timer''' is a minor character in the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Old Timer is a toy alarm clock with a white mustache and beard, giving him an elderly look.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''===
Old Timer was one of the toys stolen by [[Ron the Manager|Ron]], the manager of the [[Sleep Well]] motel. While being stored in the hotel, the toys use him to track how much time their evasion operations are taking and estimate how much time they have left. Later when they are finally freed, he leaves with the others on a delivery truck.

===''[[Toy Story 4]]''===
Old Timer appears briefly at the beginning of the film as one of Bonnie's old, outgrown toys. He tells Woody that he has been keeping track of the many times that he hasn't been played with.

===''[[Forky Asks a Question]]''===
Old Timer appears in the episode "[[What is Time?]]" when [[Rex]] explains to [[Forky]] what time is.

===Other appearances===
The DVD/Blu-Ray release of ''Toy Story of Terror!'' included an optional live-action mock commercial for Old Timer, which follows a child whose Old Timer toy is an integrant part of his daily life, accompanying him everywhere he goes, participating in all his activities. This commercial also indicated Old Timer requires batteries (sold separately) and that he is "not a working clock."

==Trivia==
*His name is a pun on his clock nature and the fact "Old Timer" is a nickname for an elderly person.
*Although he reappeared as one of Bonnie's toys in ''Toy Story 4'', it is unclear if he escaped during the events of ''Toy Story of Terror!'' or if it is a different Old Timer toy, especially considering they're played by different voice actors.
