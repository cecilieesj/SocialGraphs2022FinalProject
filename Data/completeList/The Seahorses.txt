==Role in the series==
The seahorses first appeared in the episode "[[The Seahorse Roundup]]". [[Izzy]] wanted to show [[Jake]], [[Cubby]], and [[Skully]] one of her favorite locations in [[Neverland]]: [[Seahorse Shallows]], home of the Never Land seahorses. The seahorses are very sweet and timid sea-dwelling creatures who are easily frightened by loud noises; the only way to calm them down is by singing them a lullaby. [[Captain Hook]] plotted to steal the seahorses and enslave them into pulling his rowboat, but Jake and his crew put a stop to his scheme and returned the seahorses to their home.

The seahorses appeared again in the episode "[[The Rainbow Wand]]". While Jake and his crew were sailing to [[Pirate Princess Island]] to return the [[Pirate Princess]] her Rainbow Wand, they get caught in a whirlpool. The seahorses help pull [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] to safety.

The seahorses are seen again in the episode "[[Treasure of the Tides]]". While Hook and [[Mr. Smee]] were trying to beat Izzy, [[Marina]], [[Stormy]], and the other [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]] to the Treasure of the Tides. A large school of seahorses gave Hook the idea to keep Izzy and the mermaids at bay by spooking the sea creatures toward Izzy and the mermaids. That way, Hook could beat them to the treasure. But Hook didn't count on Izzy's quick wit. Like in "The Seahorse Roundup", Izzy, Marina, and Stormy began to sing a lullaby to calm the seahorses down so they could safely pass.

In the episode "[[Seahorse Saddle-Up!]]" introduced large seahorses that Jake and his crew could ride as mounts in a Never Sea race held at [[Mermaid Lagoon (Neverland)|Mermaid Lagoon]]. Izzy and her seahorse Sea Flower were the main focus of the episode.

Sea Flower reappears in the episode "[[Captain Hook's New Hobby]]" while Izzy was trying to teach Captain Hook how to ride whales as his potential new hobby.
