'''Dolores Madrigal''' is a supporting character who appears in  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''. The eldest child and only daughter of [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Félix Madrigal]], she was gifted with enhanced hearing.

==Background ==
{{Quote|He told me that the man of my dreams<br>Would be just out of reach<br>Betrothed to another.|Dolores recounting the vision Bruno gave her.}}
Born into the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal family]], Dolores is the eldest daughter of [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]] and [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]], and the older sister of [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]] and [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]. In addition to being the niece of [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] and [[Agustín Madrigal|Agustín]], Dolores is also the cousin of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] and [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]]. In the early years of her life, Dolores lived in the nursery with her cousins Isabela, who is only a few weeks older than her, and Luisa who is two years younger than her. When Bruno was still with the family, Dolores apparently received a vision from her uncle who told her that the "man of her dreams" would be out of her reach because he would be engaged to someone else, causing her a great fear that would haunt throughout the years. When Isabela turned five and received her magical gift, she moved into her own room, and Dolores was left in the nursery with Luisa until her own fifth birthday a little while later. On the night of Dolores fifth birthday, she received the gift of enhanced hearing and she moved out of the nursery into her new room.

Dolores has inside information on everyone in the family and "knows everyone's dirt" through her enhanced hearing, but she is always quiet and does not appear to be much of a gossip. She has a hard time keeping the secrets that she hears with her gift and has to cover her ears every time she hears noises that are too loud. Despite the negative view her uncle gave her when she was young, Dolores listened to [[Mariano Guzmán]] and learned more and more about him to the point of falling in love with Mariano. After the fall of the [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]], Dolores, with Mirabel's help, finally confesses her true feelings for him, which he corresponds, much to Mirabel and Isabela's joy. Dolores also confesses that unlike the rest of her family and the Encanto villagers, she was aware of Bruno still living in the Casita as she heard him every day.

=== Official Description ===

:''Dolores is who’s usually the first to know the town’s biggest secrets, most compelling drama, and juiciest revelations. Gifted with the magical ability of extraordinary hearing, Dolores often hears things that she shouldn’t, which gets her into a lot of trouble. But she is always trying to be helpful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/meet-the-characters-of-encanto/|title=“Encanto” Character Details Revealed|website=D23|last=Team|first=D23|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2021/09/30/how-the-magical-casita-in-encanto-is-a-new-kind-of-disney-castle/|title=How the Magical Casita in ‘Encanto’ is a New Kind of Disney Castle|website=The Nerds Of Color|last=Lee|first=Michael|date=September 9, 2021|access-date=December 18, 2021}}</ref>

===Development===
How with the rest of the Madrigal family, Dolores was designed to reflect "family archetypes that are immediately relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-11-29/encanto-explained-disney-colombia-consultants|title=‘Encanto’ is Disney’s first Latino musical. How the filmmakers got Colombia right|website=LATimes|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=November 24, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> The studio originally created Dolores with the ability to heal people with food, but this power was instead given to Julieta due to her maternal personality. One of the most difficult things when designing Dolores was her appearance. During the creation process, the studio focused mainly on fixing Dolores's hair while for her clothing they were influenced by Félix's Caribbean heritage comes through in her loose blouse and skirt with red highlights, inspired by the cumbian dress.<ref>[[The Art of Encanto]]</ref>

Adassa, Dolores' voice actor, describes her character: ''“I absolutely love the character. I think that Charise Castro Smith, and Byron Howard, and Jared Bush did an amazing job writing this character, because she has all the secrets, she can hear everything. But sometimes, you know, her well-placed heart is a little bit out of order when she kind of speaks up and she can’t help it."''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vitalthrills.com/encanto-movie/|title=Encanto Movie Cast & Crew on the New Disney Film|website=VitalThrills|last=Busch|first=Jenna|date=November 8, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

===Personality===
[[File:Encanto - Dolores listening to rumors.png|left|thumb|Dolores enjoys hearing some rumors in the Town.]]
Described as "a little bit quiet", Dolores while not entirely stoic, is the least emotional of the family. She speaks or sings as low as a whisper and unlike her outgoing younger brother [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]] and their energetic parents, Dolores does not enjoy being the center of attention and prefers to stay in the background. Dolores also seems to enjoy helping others, especially her family. She on different occasions uses her enhanced hearing when someone asks her to know or find out something. Although with her gift she ends up causing problems or causing different disasters with the things she knows, Dolores is not ill-intentioned since she only tries to be useful, like a large part of her family. Due to the nature of her gift, Dolores has a tendency to expose people's secrets even if she does not want to, such as when she blurted out to the village kids that her cousin, [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]], did not have a magical gift. Despite her nature of exposing secrets, she never told anyone that [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] still lived in the walls due to the fear others had of him and his powers.

[[File:Encanto - Dolores screaming suddenly.png|thumb|Dolores having a rare moment of emotional weakness.]]
While she is generally calm and quiet, Dolores can have rare moments of stress and emotional weakness that are in stark contrast to her normally stoic personality. Her gift causes her incredible discomfort and suffering, causing her to cover her ears when they are too loud for her. Dolores powers also gives her a reputation as a busybody and forces her to keep others' secrets constantly, something that clearly makes it hard for her to pull off. After finding out the truth about Bruno's vision of the future fall of the Casita and the death of magic, she was so scared that during the dinner of proposal she told her brother as soon as she could, causing a chain of gossip that eventually led to everyone knowing what she knew. Her stress reached such a degree that she even shouted during dinner that the family was doomed. Although she does not do it to the same extent as Camilo, Dolores sometimes seems to enjoy making jokes or sarcastic comments. At breakfast, she gives [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]] a snooty look after scaring her by telling her that [[Mariano Guzmán|Mariano]] wanted to have five babies with her and proudly admits to Camilo that she always knew that Bruno never left.

[[File:Mariano and Dolores happy.png|left|thumb|Dolores happy to be with the man of her dreams and not having to hide her feelings.]]
Dolores, in addition to being quite quiet, initially also tends not to express her thoughts and feelings often. Because Bruno told her that the man of her dreams will be engaged to someone else when she was just a little girl, Dolores could never confess her love for Mariano believing that he could never be by her side and lost hope. Dolores did not confess to anyone directly that she was in love with Mariano and tried to hide her feelings to the point that for much of "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]" she has to constantly tell herself that she is okay with Isabela and Mariano's engagement, even though she was clearly suffering and depressed at the thought. However, thanks to the fact that the family was able to reunite during the reconstruction of the Casita and resolve their issues, in "[[All of You]]" Dolores was finally able to confess her feelings to Mariano and begin a relationship with him. She did not want to keep hiding her feelings, because when she had the opportunity Dolores immediately told Mariano what she loved about him and was overjoyed that he reciprocated her feelings, as well as being happy that she was no longer able to keep her opinions and emotions to herself (much to the joy of her cousins).

[[File:Encanto - Dolores taking care of Alma.png|thumb|Dolores lovingly caring for her frightened Abuela Alma.]]
She shares a close relationship with her family and can become protective of them. Dolores is mostly seen around her younger brothers and is shown to be close to them. Although she shares a typical sibling relationship with Camilo, she doesn't actually seem too bothered by her brother's antics compared to Isabela. When the Casita begins to crumble, Dolores instinctively puts her arm around Camilo in an attempt to protect him, though she can't stop him from running to save the [[Miracle Candle]]. Dolores obediently obeys Alma when she orders her to know something and after the Casita collapses, she takes care of her frightened Abuela and sits her on a small piece of debris to calm her own. Even when Bruno gave her a vision that caused her insecurities since she was a child, she never had a negative opinion of her uncle. As singing about him, she seems genuinely sympathetic about his powers compared to much of the family and doesn't portray him as a bad person. Dolores is even very close to Isabela despite living in her shadow all her life and willing to help Mirabel a helping hand in investigating the cause of the magic dying. After the magic had died, causing Mirabel to run away, she was concerned for her cousin and helped look for her.

===Physical appearance===
Dolores is a 21-year-old<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468685739969814528|title=Ages|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref>Colombian young lady with curly brown hair and brown eyes. She wears a white and yellow shirt with golden-colored trimming on it with red fabric going through the collar and sleeves, a long red skirt with yellow and light-red streaks, a red choker with a golden gem adorned with a ruby on the middle of it, and heart-shaped golden earrings, and red sandals. She also wears a big red bow on her hair, which she wears in a bun. Symbolizing her super hearing, Dolores' clothes have many sound waves on her shirt, skirt (along with flower-like symbols with them), and bow.

===Powers and abilities===
Dolores has enhanced hearing; her ears are strong enough to hear even the quietest noise, such as the sound of a pin dropping, and even the sound of someone's eye twitching. Her hearing also works over great distances, she is able to receive messages from people all the way in town from Casa Madrigal, as seen when she reported Mariano's family coming for dinner. However, her gift's one drawback is that she apparently doesn't do well in noisy environments, as she was seen holding her hands over her ears as everyone else cheered for Antonio.

[[File:Dolores telling the children that Mirabel has no gift.png|thumb|Dolores tells the kids that Mirabel didn't get a gift.]]
Dolores first appeared getting ready for the day and heading to the village with the rest of her family to help around. In "[[The Family Madrigal]]", Dolores is seen suddenly appearing whenever [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] mentions her to the [[Town Kids]] and listening with her enhanced hearing to some village rumors from great distances. Since the day was also her youngest brother's, [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]], fifth birthday and gift ceremony, Dolores soon returned home to help prepare for the celebration. When Mirabel was concluding her talk about her family to the Town Kids before being interrupted by [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]], who was standing by the door of the [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]], one of the kids told Alma that Mirabel was about to tell her and the rest of the kids about her magical gift, only for Dolores to suddenly appear at her abuela's side and tell the kids that Mirabel didn't receive one before suddenly leaving to hear what time some guests were arriving at Antonio's party.

[[File:Dolores listening to Alma.png|left|thumb|Dolores notifying her family that Alma says it is time for Antonio's ceremony to begin.]]
Later Dolores joined her family to greet Antonio and give him some encouragement to relax. Before the gift ceremony begins, Dolores smiles warmly at Antonio and encourages him along with the rest of her family as she wishes him luck. While her parents and [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]] were talking to Antonio, Dolores tells everyone that Alma says it's time to start. After leaving the place they were in earlier, she joined her other relatives to watch Antonio's ceremony and Dolores was affectionately holding hands with her cousin [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]] as they stand with the rest of their family listening as Alma gives her speech. When Antonio received his magical gift, Dolores, along with the rest of the family, are very happy, although Dolores can be seen covering her ears in reaction to people clapping and fireworks going off. As the party moved into Antonio's magical bedroom, Dolores is quite impressed when her younger brother mounts his jaguar around in his room for the first time and looks at it with pride along with Camilo. Alma then went over to congratulate Antonio and took a family picture, which everyone unknowingly excluded Mirabel from.

[[File:Dolores mentions that Luisa's eye was twitching.png|thumb|Dolores mentions that Luisa's eye was twitching all night.]]
The next morning at breakfast, Mirabel tries to ask "Dolores" if she knew what was going on with the magic after cracks appeared in the Casita the night before, only for "Dolores" to shift into Camilo much to [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]]'s annoyance and the real Dolores, who watched in silence as her father scolded her brother for shapeshifts into her to repeat food. Dolores, having overheard Mirabel's concerns, tells her that the only one worried about the magic was her, the rats in the wall and [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] since her eye was twitching all night, to later join the rest of the family at the table. As [[The Madrigals]] started eating, Alma makes an announcement to the family that she spoke to the Guzmáns about Isabela's engagement, and when asked, Dolores tells everyone that [[Mariano Guzmán|Mariano]] is planning on proposing to Isabela that same night and briefly scares Isabela by adding that Mariano wants five babies before eating again. When breakfast concludes, Dolores joins everyone in the family chant "La Familia Madrigal" before returning to her daily activities.

[[File:Encanto-animationscreencaps.com-6458.jpg|left|thumb|Dolores discovers Mirabel and Agustín talking about Bruno's vision of the death of magic.]]
Dolores then joined her family in "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]" after her parents' verses to telling Mirabel about their estranged, missing uncle [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]]. While in the halls of the Casita, she indirectly says that she can still hear Bruno and she associates him with the sound of falling sand and acknowledges that Bruno's gift is more of a burden, and that Bruno's prophecies left the family "fumbling" because they couldn't understand them. Watching from a distance as Alma leads the Guzmán family to the Casita for Isabela and Mariano's marriage proposal dinner, Dolores comments about the vision that Bruno gave her about the man of her dreams being out of her reach. Later stating again that she can still hear Bruno. Shortly before dinner, Dolores, overhears Mirabel's conversation with [[Agustín Madrigal|Agustín]] where she discussed Bruno's vision. Much to their dismay, Dolores acknowledges that she heard what they said before rushing off. At dinner, Mirabel stares Dolores down much to her discomfort, but as soon as they break eye contact, Dolores takes that opportunity to tell Camilo that Mirabel found Bruno's vision. As dinner starts spiraling out of control with the spread of Bruno‘s vision about the magic fading, a panicked Dolores blurts out to everyone present that Mirabel found Bruno's vision and she was going to destroy the magic and they were "all doomed", while covering her ears because [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] started forming a thundercloud.

[[File:Encanto - Félix and Dolores.png|thumb|Dolores and Félix looking for Mirabel after she disappears.]]
Later that same day, Dolores and the rest family returned to courtyard to find Alma and Mirabel having a heated argument about Alma's unhealthy perfectionism. When the Casita begins to destroy around her and the [[Miracle Candle]] begins to go out, while it's very quick and a bit blurred out, Dolores instinctively puts her arm around Camilo to try and protect him before he runs off to try to save the candle that was about to fall from a window. As the magic starts fading, and the house starts collapsing, the Casita forces everyone, except Mirabel out of the house. After the Casita is destroyed and the candle dies along with the magic, Dolores can be seen taking care of a frightened Alma and sits her on a small piece of debris to calm her own. When Julieta noticed Mirabel went missing, the Madrigals and the other townspeople spread out to search for her. Dolores tries to use her enhanced hearing, but having lost her gift after the magic faded, she can only hear what's immediately around her.

[[File:Encanto - Dolores, Antonio and Félix.jpg|left|thumb|Dolores working on the rebuilding of Casa Madrigal with her family.]]
By the next day, Dolores and the family saw that Mirabel and Alma (who reconcile with each other) returned to Casita's ruins and during "[[All of You]]" Alma revealed to the entire family that Bruno hid behind the rubble, they immediately accepted him back into the family. Unlike her brother and cousins, Dolores was not surprised when she saw Bruno again after years, as she nudges Camilo's arm saying that she knew Bruno never left and she heard him everyday since his disappearance. With the family all together, Mirabel rallied them to fix the house and the entire town also pitched in as thanks for all the Madrigals had done for them. At some point while rebuilding the Casita, Mirabel consoles a visibly upset Mariano and she introduces him to Dolores. When Dolores takes over the conversation, she expresses her feelings towards Mariano and confesses to him. When Dolores begins to relate different things that she likes about him, Mariano seems puzzled at first, but then his eyes widen in surprise and he falls in love with her. Dolores is very happy to be together with Mariano, although she tells him to slow down when he suggests that they should get married. After completing the house, Mirabel added a doorknob the family made just for her to the front door, which caused Casita to spring back to life, and the magic returned to the entire Encanto. The Madrigals then celebrated the return of their home and gifts with a family picture while Casita squished the whole family closer together unexpectedly.

==Trivia==
*Dolores' birthday is on [[August 31]],  coinciding with the International Day for People of African Descent and [[Wikipedia:Raymond Nonnatus| Saint Raymond Nonnatus]]'s [[Wikipedia:Feast Day|Feast Day]], who is (among other things) the patron of confidentiality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1510331589800062976|title=Dolores' Birthday|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=April 2, 2022|access-date=April 2, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1504942335104192512|title=Meaningful Birthdays|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=March 18, 2022|access-date=March 18, 2022}}</ref>
*Due to the nature of her gift, Dolores is the only one of the family who was aware that her [[Bruno Madrigal|uncle]] was living inside the walls of [[Casa Madrigal]] and Dolores drops subtle hints about Bruno's location throughout the movie.
**Despite her reputation of telling secrets, Dolores never shared Bruno's whereabouts to her family; why she chose to withhold this information is unclear, although it is possible she felt sympathy for his case since she describes his gift to be humbling and seemed to understand his predicament during the song "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]."
***It could be that she knew it would fall on deaf ears, as they, particularly her mother and grandmother, would not want to mention him. Though that wouldn't explain why she was willing to blast about Bruno's vision about Mirabel, knowing how her cousin would be treated by their grandmother. Though it could just mean Dolores isn't the best of keeping secrets or at least being sensitive.
*Due to their sensory powers, Bruno and Dolores are the only family members that their doors depict with eyes open.
**The similarity in their powers, being liable to cause civic disturbances, could explain Dolores' particular sympathy towards Bruno.
*Dolores and Isabela are the same age, but Dolores is slightly younger by a few weeks as she is "Isa's shadow".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468685739969814528|title=Ages|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref>
*While her room is never seen in the film, [[Jared Bush]] stated Dolores's room does contain some soundproofing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479866638811877380|title=Dolores's Room|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref>
*During Antonio's gift ceremony, Dolores claps using just her index fingers because the sound of her clapping is likely too loud for her ears, and when everyone cheered, she was covering them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/encanto-thriving-tiktok-weeks-theatrical-release-rcna11625|title='Encanto' is thriving on TikTok weeks after its theatrical release.

*The squeaks she does resembles how Colombians traditionally gossiped. 
*The name Dolores means "lady of sorrows," which is one of the many titles given to the Virgin Mary.
*Dolores and Mirabel are the only female members of the family whose names don't end with "a".
