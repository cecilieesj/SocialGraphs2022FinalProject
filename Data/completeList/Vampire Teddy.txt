==Appearances==
===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===
The vampire Teddy was made during the "[[Making Christmas]]" sequence to be one of [[Jack Skellington]]'s macabre [[Christmas]] presents. The teddy was created by the corpse dad, the wolf man and the devil of [[Halloween Town]].

Jack Skellington gives him and an [[Toy Duck|undead pull toy duck]] to a pair of children when he gives presents to the little kids in the real world. The toys both come to life and start chasing the children all the way to their parents' room. Near the end of the movie, [[Santa Claus]] comes and replaces the vampire teddy with a regular teddy bear that isn't scary like the previous one. He does the same with the other toys that Jack delivered.

==Other Appearances==

===[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]===

In both versions of Haunted Mansion Holiday, you can see him at the start of the ride. In the California version, he is first seen sitting on top of a stack of presents. He is also in the s√©ance room sitting behind [[Madame Leota]]. Next, he appears in the graveyard blowing a trumpet before guests enter the crypt to see [[Oogie Boogie]]. Finally, he appears above guests as they make the descent into the graveyard, chewing on the lights. In the Tokyo version, he is seen playing a piano to the tune of Haunted Mansion Holiday Nightmare's loading music ("[[Kidnap the Sandy Claws]]"). He also appears above the entrance to the crypt just like in the California version, and in one of the portraits in the stretching room.

==Trivia==
*The Vampire Teddy originates from Tim Burton's 1983 Nightmare Before Christmas poem.
*The Teddy's head-shape is a [[Hidden Mickey]].
*The teddy bear shares a striking resemblance to the [[Cheshire Cat]] logo of Max Schreck's Department Store in the Tim Burton film Batman Returns which was released a year before the Nightmare Before Christmas.
