He is voiced by [[David Kaufman]] in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' and by [[James Arnold Taylor]] in ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''.

==Background==
===Early life===
Not very much is known about Johnny's past, except that he got trapped in the Baxter Building when it was sent to space by [[Doctor Doom]].

===Present===
The Human Torch helped the Avengers fight off the Dark Elves in their ice forms when the Casket of Ancient Winters was opened.

Few weeks later after the Avengers saved [[Asgard]] from [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], Johnny and the [[Thing]] visited the Avengers Mansion for a poker game, the [[Hulk]] attacked the Thing and Johnny joined the fight. At the game Johnny was surprised that [[Captain America]] didn't know him he watched when the Thing got attacked by the Hulk. Doombots started to attack, he took on several Doombots. After a while the Doombots deactivated and the Hulk threw them in the ocean, they left the mansion and went to the Baxter Building where they met Reed and [[Iron Man|Tony]] and told them that Susan and [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] got kidnapped. Johnny was worried and they decided to invade the castle, but as they arrived they got overwhelmed by Doom. Doom stopped the fighting and freed both Susan and Wasp. The Fantastic Four and the Avengers left the castle. In the Avengers headquarters, they discussed the reason for Doom's attack.

===Personality===
Johnny is a hot-head who lives for the thrill and action in battle. He would prefer to fight, rather than watch it, or do anything else really. This tends to disturb or annoy others who aren't used to this attitude of his, such as [[Hawkeye]]. He can be serious, but that is only when someone close to him is in danger. That thrill of his automatically turns into pure focus. This was demonstrated when Susan was captured. He loves to pull many pranks on his teammates whenever he pleases.

===Physical appearance===
Johnny has blond hair and blue eyes, he sometimes covers his face with sunglasses. He wears the standard Fantastic Four's blue outfit, that can withstand extreme heat when Johnny goes in to fiery form. The outfit goes with back boots, gloves, and a black belt with the Fantastic 4 symbol on his chest.

When Johnny activates his powers he goes into a fiery form where he can emit and control the element of fire.

==Relationships==

They are siblings. Johnny acts kind arrogant towards everyone even to Susan, but when she gets in trouble he wants to save her as soon as trouble showing brotherly love.

===[[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]]===
Johnny keep winding Reed up about how smart he is or could build such and such.
