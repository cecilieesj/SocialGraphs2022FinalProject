It's [[Bob Duncan|Bob]] and [[Amy Duncan|Amy]]’s 20th wedding anniversary and for everyone's present from Bob, he surprises the entire family with a trip to Hawaii! Unbeknownst to them, the trip is complimentary if Bob attends a day-long seminar as part of a time share presentation. Upon arrival, Teddy wants to get surfing lessons from the cute instructor Kai, and [[PJ Duncan|PJ]] and [[Gabe Duncan|Gabe]] go on a helicopter ride with a scarily unpredictable pilot. Meanwhile, Amy ignores the advice of a local and is cursed when she steps on forbidden sacred areas...

[[Charlie Duncan|Charlie]] stays busy learning a new dance that is part of the Kahunas Kiddie Club. Meanwhile, though she didn’t believe it at first, Amy starts to slowly believe that a curse has been bestowed upon her so she sets out to undo it, and Bob discovers that his wife needs to be with him at the timeshare presentation or he will be charged for the entire trip so he convinces Teddy to pretend she is Amy. After a terrifying helicopter ride with a psychotic pilot, Gabe helps PJ overcome his fears. After a series of unlucky accidents, Teddy finally tries to go on a date with Kai but when he finally says yes, Teddy can't make it.
