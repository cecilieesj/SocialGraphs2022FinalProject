The '''Robo-Hooligans''' are a gang of soccer-themed robots from the [[Disney XD]] series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''. They appear in the episode "[[The McHugger Games]]".

==Role in the episode==
The Robo-Hooligans are sent out to retrieve a pair of McHuggers that [[Randy Cunningham]] stole from [[Hannibal McFist]]. Once [[Pitch Kickham]] tells Randy about the release lever in the back of the McHuggers, Randy frees his hands and takes on the Hooligans. Once Randy takes them out, a second wave appears, but [[Howard Weinerman]] ends up slicing them up with the ID Bot's laser.

The Hooligans make an appearance in the episode "[[Escape from Scrap City]]", implying they were junked after they were defeated.
