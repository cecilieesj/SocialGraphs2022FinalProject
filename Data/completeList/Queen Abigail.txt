'''Queen Abigail''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series [[Elena of Avalor]]. She is the queen of the kingdom of Norberg and the mother of [[Princess Chloe]].

==Background==
She had a belligerent history with [[King Hector]]. She was amused to hear that Princess Elena of Avalor refused to obey him at her first Royal Retreat.

==Role in the Series==
Queen Abigail makes her debut in "[[The Incredible Shrinking Royals]]". As Avalor's newly elected Magister of Trade, Julio Guzman decided to invite the rulers of various kingdoms to his first Feast of Friendship instead of their ambassadors. Queen Abigail was among the invited guests.

She arrived in her royal carriage to the Sunbird Temple, where the feast was being held. Abigail exuberantly greeted Princess Elena and told her she had heard about her encounter with Hector at her first Royal Retreat and believed it to be justified. The two bonded over their dislike of the king and were surprised when he arrived at the feast moments later.

After the Feast of Friendship "[[Norberg Peace Prize]]", Queen Abigail was heading home till King Hector came to show off his Wave Smasher is an indestructible ship, hands her a spear, dares her throws it, and she does it puts a hole in his ship. Hector blames her, even though he literally told her to do it, Hector warns Abigail this isn't the end.

Abigail headed back to Avalor tells Elena that Hector is demanding her to buy him a new ship or he'll ruin Norberg's Family by refuse to deliver the Mulberries. She needs Elena to meditate a truce, and Elena agrees.

Next week Elena, along with friends, arrived in the kingdom of Norberg at the Norberg Palace, Elena tries her best to meditate, but both Abigail and Hector are extremely stubborn and immature, even with trying friendship exercises, it didn't work, last chance they take them to Gibbspeake Island, were their only way off is to build a raft (Elena told the Jaquins not to come back for them), but start arguing again. Thanks to Isabel Elena realized they don't need to be friends to get along (for Hector, the respect and admiration of Norbergian and another Jaquins ride when they get to the mainland), the two starts getting along, Abigail is willing to repair his ship with Gibbspeak wood, Hector gives the Mulberries Family Day is saved, and Abigail invited Hector to join the fun too.

In ''[[Coronation Day]]'' she attends Elena's coronation.
