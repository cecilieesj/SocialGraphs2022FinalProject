==Role in the film==
Mike and his brother, [[Matt Murdock|Matt]], are [[Mayor Murdock]]'s sons. They do not enjoy [[Elizabeth (Ernest Scared Stupid)|Elizabeth]]'s classroom report about Briarville's legend of [[Trantor]] and [[Phineas Worrell]]. They later destroy Kenny's cardboard haunted house. They are eventually mistaken for trolls by [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]], but nobody believes him, especially [[Cliff Binder]]. Mike teams up with Kenny to defeat Trantor and other trolls after Matt became one of Trantor's wooden dolls during Briarville Elementary School's Halloween bash. After arriving at [[Francis Hackmore]]'s homeland, Mike, in his vampire costume, uses a squirt gun to squirt milk at some of the trolls in order for them to disappear forever. After Ernest defeats Trantor, Mike and his father reunite with Matt who is a normal person once again.
