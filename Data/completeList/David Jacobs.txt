Snyder|quote = "You talk about self-interest, but since the strike, your circulation's been down 70%. Every day you're losing thousands of dollars just to beat us out of one lousy tenth of a cent. Why?"}}David lives with his parents, Mayer & Esther Jacobs. As well as his older sister Sarah and his younger brother Les. Before becoming a Newsie and until his father got injured on the job, David attended school. 

The Jacobs' Household is small, with a bed in the same room as the dining table, and one bedroom for David, Sarah, and Les. In the film, after the first day on the job, David and Jack talk on the fire-escape; David suggests that Jack stay the night, but he declines.



== David and ''Seize The Day'' ==
''Seize The Day'' is the 8th title on the soundtrack. David sings this song with the Newsies, surrounding the Horace Greely statue. The song is later reprised in a chorale version, which is the 11th listing on the soundtrack. The song is a significant turning point for the character, considering he initially was unsure of the strike. The song was a way to help the other Newsies gain confidence in the strike again, even if Brooklyn didn't join them.
