'''Sexton Mouse''' is [[Little Sister]]'s husband and a church mouse who works in [[Friar Tuck's Church]] in ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''.

==Role in the film==
Sexton and Little Sister are first shown on [[Friar Tuck]]'s head, cheering for [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]] and [[Maid Marian]] and participating in a dance party in which everyone present makes fun of [[Prince John]].

The next time Sexton is seen, he is playing on an organ, using his hands and feet. He complains to Friar Tuck that nobody is coming. As Little Sister gives Friar Tuck their last farthing, and he blesses them both, Sexton remarks that they were saving it for a rainy day. Friar jovially says that this must be literal, as it is raining outoors. As the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] enters, Sexton Mouse rudely asks what he wants, only to be shushed by Little Sister. He is then shown in the doorway, watching the Sheriff and Friar Tuck fight, cheering for the latter, only to see the former arrest him thanks to Trigger. He then comforts Little Sister who is devastated at the sight of Friar Tuck being arrested for high treason to the crown.

Sexton and Little Sister are not seen again until the end of the film, where they celebrate newlyweds Robin Hood and Maid Marian by throwing rice down from a window after [[King Richard]] finally returns. 

== Trivia ==

* [[Sterling Holloway]] was considered to voice Sexton.
