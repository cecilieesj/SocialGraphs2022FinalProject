==Background==
===Official Description===
:''To Dean Hardscrabble, there are scary monsters and there are all other monsters. It is no surprise she feels this way—she is, after all, a legendary Scarer and Dean of the School of Scaring at Monsters University. Aspiring Scare students must be up for the challenge to impress her, though she is convinced that her assessment of who is truly scary and who is not is never wrong.''<ref>[http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/monsters-university-character-posters/ New Character Posters – Meet the Monsters of Monsters University]</ref>

===Development===
Hardscrabble, back then known only as the '''Dean''', was conceived as a male character and was based on an alligator. However, late in the production, a few weeks before starting the animation, Dan Scanlon decided the character had to be a female. Character Art Director Jason Deamer says Scanlon likes "to play things again type" and believes that was the trigger of the change, as "a male antagonist Dean is an accepted thing in the college movie genre, so the idea was that it would be more interesting to make her a female; it’s something new".<ref name="denofgeek">[http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/monsters-university/26234/the-inspirations-for-monsters-university%E2%80%99s-characters The inspirations for Monsters University’s characters]</ref> Story Supervisor Kelsey Mann says about the original iteration did not work because "he just came in and did a lot of yelling and screaming and it didn’t really intimidate you. [With Hardscrabble's final version] It’s a kind of quiet reserved judgment that really sends the chills up your spine".<ref>[http://blogs.disney.com/insider/articles/2013/04/09/the-story-behind-the-story-of-monsters-university/ The Story Behind the Story of Monsters University]</ref>

As a result of the change, the Dean's design had to be remade. A team of character designers, comprising artists that worked on the original ''Monsters, Inc.'', was gathered<ref name="denofgeek" /> as they went through many designs. Their designs had her based on a number of intimidating animals, such as a crab, scorpion, snake, moth, bat, and owl.<ref name="denofgeek" /><ref name="buzzfeed">[http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/monsters-university-dean-hardscrabble-change-gender The “Monsters University” Character Who Changed Gender At The Last Minute]</ref> The biggest problem and intent came from the need that her appearance had to reflect she is both the dean of the school and a legendary Scarer, two ideas that they found were not necessarily compatible.<ref name="buzzfeed" /> the team finally settled on using a type of centipede called Scolopendra Gigantea, also known as the Amazonian giant centipede, that combined the creepiness, authority, and elegance they wanted Hardscrabble to have.<ref name="denofgeek" /> One was brought to Pixar for reference and was called Kendra the Scolopendra by the MU crew.<ref>[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-monsters-university-fun-facts-63189/ ‘MONSTERS UNIVERSITY’ FUN FACTS PART TWO]</ref> Hardscrabble's head takes from the crowns of horned lizards, and her wings are based on those of bats and designed to blend into her jacket when folded.<ref name="buzzfeed" />

===Personality===
Hardscrabble is the archetype of a strict and no-nonsense school headteacher, and not so easily pleased. She is not afraid to point out somebody's shortcomings and even lightly taunts students who do not impress her. She even proved to have a petty streak in personally testing Mike and Sulley on the spot and dismissing them from the program after they had accidentally broken her scream canister which contained the scream she got that broke the Scare Record. She failed Sulley for his disregard of the importance of the studies while she failed Mike because in her professional opinion he was simply not scary despite his academic performances. At the same time, however, she firmly believes in fairness, as she was understandably angered when one of the teams in the [[Scare Games]] cheated and when [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] admitted that he rigged the machinery on the last event to help [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] win. But despite her harsh exterior, the climax of the film depicts Hardscrabble as capable of a certain degree of sympathy. She also has very keen observation, as she knew Mike only joined Oozma Kappa to get back into the program, which is why she changed the bet into letting the whole team into the program, as opposed to just Mike. After Mike bravely made the bet with her and indeed surprised her at the end of the Scare Games, Hardscrabble warms up to both him and Sulley, and is visibly upset at the idea of expelling them from the [[Monsters University (institution)|university]], and does her best to encourage them and wish them the best of luck in the future. 

While Hardscrabble is far from evil or malicious, her appearance and mannerisms mark her as antagonistic, given that she is Mike and Sulley's primary opponent in the film, in a similar vein to [[Anton Ego]].

==Role in the film==
Dean Hardscrabble is first seen flying into [[Professor Knight]]'s classroom, causing all of the lights in the room to go out with a single flap of her wings. Hardscrabble then tells all of Prof. Knight's students (including [[Mike Wazowski]] and [[James P. Sullivan]]) that they all have to complete a final exam at the end of the first semester and that those who fail would be kicked out of the Scaring Program. When, during said exam, Mike and Sulley get into a big roar-off which ends with both monsters accidentally breaking her prized scream canister, Hardscrabble appears to take in stride the loss of her old memento. She however retaliates by testing Mike and then Sulley on the spot, finding fault in both (Mike, because in her professional opinion he isn't scary, and Sulley because of his disregard of the importance of studying, causing him to use a reckless and flawed method to scare the hypothetical child) before dismissing them from her program.

However, Mike signs up for the [[Scare Games]] with a fraternity of misfit monsters called [[Oozma Kappa]] (Sulley joining to round up their numbers) and wagers to the dean that if he makes them win the Games, he'd be readmitted in the program. Hardscrabble agrees to allow his whole team in the program if they win, but warns them that if they lose, they would be expelled from Monsters University. During the Scare Games, Dean Hardscrabble spectates the competition from afar, expecting them to fail. When Sulley confronts her the day before the final event, she asks him if he thinks Mike is scary, which leaves him speechless.

After Sulley comes to her following OK's victory over [[Roar Omega Roar]] and shamefully confesses having cheated by tampering with the simulator, lowering its difficulty for Mike's benefit, Hardscrabble indignantly expels him on the spot, with the expectation that he's left the campus by the next day, calling him a disgrace to the university ''and'' his family's name, when she is suddenly interrupted by the alert of Mike's intrusion in the door lab, which prompts Sulley to go there to save his friend. When he successfully bypasses campus security to sneak through the door after Mike, Hardscrabble decides to have the lab cleared and the door shut down while waiting for the CDA's arrival to get things under control. She however witnesses the door reactivating and the scream canisters filling up seemingly on their own, forcing her to duck for cover and watch in horror as the door is engulfed in an explosion, from which Mike and Sulley emerge. When she asks Sulley, bewildered, how they managed to break out, he points to Mike as the one responsible for that stunt, to her further shock.

While she has no choice but to expel Mike and Sulley from Monsters University permanently for their actions, she nonetheless honors her agreement by allowing the rest of OK in the scaring program, and catches the two on their way out of the campus to admit that, against her expectations, they did manage to surprise her, and wishes them luck by encouraging them to "keep surprising people".

Her words would eventually come true as Sulley and Mike managed to create a new means of extracting energy through children's laughs, which are much more powerful than screams. Due to this inspirational change in the industry, it is highly possible that she was motivated to redesign the school curriculum to educate and train future Jokesters.

==Trivia==
*Hardscrabble created the Scare Games and won them four years in a row.
*Hardscrabble keeps the canister that holds her record-breaking scream in her classroom, but later is was [[James P. Sullivan|destroyed]].
*In some ways, Hardscrabble appears to be the complete opposite of [[Henry J. Waternoose|Waternoose]]: while Waternoose appears friendly and kind-natured but is actually cruel and evil, and is, therefore, the original film's main antagonist; Hardscrabble appears stern and unpleasant but is actually caring and benign, and therefore eventually became an ally to Mike and Sulley in the end of the film.
*When Hardscrabble sees [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] go into the [[door]] leading to the girls' cabin to save Mike Wazowski from several human policemen by roaring at them she yells, "Don't go in there!" A similar line was said by Waternoose at the end of the original film when Sulley and [[Boo]] trick him into exposing his evil plans and being arrested by the CDA by luring him into the scare simulation room, which he yells, "Don't go in that room!"
*Hardscrabble used to be a member of [[Eta Hiss Hiss|HSS]].
*"Hardscrabble" actually means "very poor reward, regardless of hard work," which appropriately describes how she treats her students: anyone who does not live up to her expectations or performs poorly cannot attend her program.
*Helen Mirren was offered the part of Hardscrabble outright, but insisted on auditioning anyway to ensure that the producers were satisfied with her performance.
*There was another Dean Hardscrabble who resembled an alligator, but he was scrapped and the female Hardscrabble was included instead.
