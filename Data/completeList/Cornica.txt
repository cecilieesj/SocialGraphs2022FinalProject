'''Cornica''' is a sea unicorn from ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''. She appeared in the episode "[[Izzy and the Sea-Unicorn]]".

==History==
Cornica met up with [[Izzy]] while she was sitting at the water's edge. She quickly bonded with Izzy and gave her a seashell to summon her. In return, Izzy gave Cornica a seashell necklace as a token of their friendship.

When [[Captain Hook]] captured Cornica, Izzy set off for [[Mermaid Lagoon (Neverland)|Mermaid Lagoon]] to ask if anyone had seen the sea unicorn. However, [[Queen Coralie]] and her subjects discounted it, since sea unicorns are but legends in mermaid lore. [[Stormy]] was the only one who believed Izzy's story and helped the young pirates find where Hook had taken Cornica.

Jake and his crew pursued Hook in their min-subs to Coral Tunnel, wherein lay the legendary treasure of the sea unicorns. Hook caused a cave-in to try and stop Jake from following, but Jake and friends managed to bypass the cave-in.
