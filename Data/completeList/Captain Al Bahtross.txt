'''Captain Al Bahtross''' is a minor character who appeared in the Aladdin episode: ''[[Plunder the Sea]]''. He is known as the nautical hero who defeated the Seven Fleets of Jambalaya. He always smiles and speaks in third person. His ship is covered with little red flags to mark the number of victories he won during his adventures at sea. His name is a comical adaptation of a sea bird known as an "Albatross".

=="[[Plunder the Sea]]"==
Captain Al Bahtross is a nautical hero. According to [[the Sultan]], he has defeated the Seven Fleets of Jambalaya. [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] becomes jealous when he hears [[Jasmine]] and the Sultan talk about how much of a hero Al Bahtross is and goes to his ship. When Aladdin gets to his ship, Al Bahtross makes Aladdin his only crew and makes him finish pulling up an anchor. In a stormy night, Aladdin tells Al Bahtross to go below the deck, but the captain wants to stay under the storm. The next morning, Aladdin sees a figurehead from the lost ship in the ocean and gets a harpoon in case something shows up, but the captain says that they don't need any harpoons. When the two get in the water, they go to a shipwreck to tie a rope on a treasure chest. They are later captured by a mechanical monster. Aladdin and Al Bahtross see that [[Mechanicles]] is controlling the monster. When the two are about to fight him, he traps them behind bars. Al Bahtross bends the bars and when he and Aladdin climb out of the cage, Mechanicles pulls another lever which opens a trapdoor beneath them. When [[Genie]], [[Abu]], and [[Iago]] go to Aladdin and Al Bahtross, Genie pulls a plug and they all get sucked back into the ocean. When they get back on the ship, Aladdin sees the monster and Al Bahtross wants to ram it. Aladdin tries to stop him because he'll end up wrecking the ship, but the captain thinks he's just being a coward. The two men fight over the ship's wheel, causing them to accidentally roll overboard. When they reach the surface, Al Bahtross sees that his ship is being destroyed and fights the machine's tentacles. After Aladdin destroys Mechanicles' machine, Al Bahtross thinks ''he'' defeated the monster.

==Trivia==
*He was voiced by [[Jason Alexander]] who also played [[Abis Mal]].
