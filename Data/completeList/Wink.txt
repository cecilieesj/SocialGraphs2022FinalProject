'''Wink''' is a supporting character in the [[2021]] live-action [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film, ''[[Cruella]]''. He is a light brown chihuahua with one injured eye that is usually covered by a patch. He serves as the companion to [[Jasper and Horace|Horace Badun]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Cruella]]''===
When a young Cruella awakens on a park bench, she is greeted by the petty thieves [[Jasper and Horace]], as well as, their one-eyed dog. A police officer chases the group from the park, though they escape to Jasper and Horace's home. The boys introduce Cruella to their dog, Wink. Over the years, Wink aids the trio in their many cons by pickpocketing people on the streets, carrying wallets from one person to the other, and being their lookout. During Estella's crusade against [[Baroness Von Hellman]], Horace dresses Wink as a giant rat to further his disguise as a pest control employee. When Jasper and Horace are arrested, Cruella drives a truck into the police station which allows Wink to jump out of the van and carry Jasper's pickpocketing materials to the imprisoned men. As they pull their final con against the Baroness, Wink keeps Horace safe by biting at the ankles of guards. When one of the guards pushes Wink aside, Horace angrily proclaims that the dog is like a son to him and prepares to fight the guard. After the defeat of the Baroness, Wink moves into [[Hell Hall]] alongside his companions.

==Trivia==

*[[Emma Thompson]], who portrayed the villainous [[Baroness Von Hellman]], jokingly tried to get Bluebell fired from ''Cruella'' for upstaging her performances. The crew knew her claims were in good fun as Bluebell was marvelously well-behaved.
*Despite Bluebell being a female dog, Wink is a male dog, as confirmed when Horace says, "that dog is like a son to me".
*Bluebell was a stray during the filming of ''Cruella'', but found a home after production finished.
