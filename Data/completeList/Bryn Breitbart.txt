==History==
She is a snobby, mean girl that attends East View High School. She was thought to be thirteenth in line for the throne of Denmark, but was then discovered to be a liar.

In the end, she throws a nacho at Rosie, aimed for Emma, and causes Rosie to "die" (she only falls). She is an enemy of Emma Ross.
