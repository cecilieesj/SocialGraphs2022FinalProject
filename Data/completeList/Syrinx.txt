She is a female tree nymph who resides on [[Phil's Island]]. Unlike the rest of the nymphs she apparently enjoys Phil's company and seems to be in a relationship with him. However, she was upset when Phil forbid Hercules from dancing (considering it "un-manly"). She tells him he's just as stubborn as her father, who disapproves of her relationship with a satyr. She has appeared in "[[Hercules and the Muse of Dance]]".

Syrinx is named after the mythological nymph who was chased by Pan but turned herself into reeds to escape from him.
