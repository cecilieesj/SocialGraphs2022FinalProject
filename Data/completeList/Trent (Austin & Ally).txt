[[File:Backups_&_Breakups_63.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Trent''' (alias '''T-Fame''') was [[Trish De la Rosa|Trish's]] new boyfriend that only appeared in the Season 2 episodes "[[Backups & Breakups]]" and "[[Crybabies & Cologne]]". He is portrayed by [[Trevor Jackson]].

==Character History==
===Backups & Breakups===
Trent is first introduced in this episode as Trish's secret boyfriend. Trish decides to keep him a secret with [[Dez]] because he caught them at a movie together. It is shown that Trish breaks up with him after [[Ally Dawson|Ally]] catches him and he already had a different girlfriend named Becky. The only reason he dated Trish was so he could be a back-up dancer for Austin. He claims that the only reason why he was fired as a backup dancer was because Austin was afraid that he would out shine him. He challenges Austin to a dance-off, but loses due to Austin's secret move.

===Crybabies & Cologne===
Trent is seen again, when he comes to Sonic Boom to apologize to Trish, by presenting him an apology t-shirt. Trish refuses his apology, and he is kicked out of Sonic Boom. He later comes to the practice room where he overhears Austin and Ally working on a new [http://austinally.wikia.com/wiki/Got_It_2 song]. He steals it and takes credit for it. He made a video of him singing the song, which is similar to the video for [http://austinally.wikia.com/wiki/Double_Take ''Double Take'']. He makes an appearance on ''The Wanda Watson Show'' along with Austin. He later gets attacked by bees that Dez and Dex set free because the cologne he was wearing smelled like honey. After he blamed Austin for setting the bees free, he replaced Austin's spot as "Crybaby of the Week". This humiliation would put an end to his singing career for good.
