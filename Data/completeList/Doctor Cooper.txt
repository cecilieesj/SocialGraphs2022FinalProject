'''Doctor Cooper''' is a character from ''[[TaleSpin]]'', who makes an appearance in the episode "[[The Old Man and the Sea Duck]]".

==Bio==
When [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] flies into town to get help for [[Joe Magee]], he comes across Doctor Cooper, an elderly anthropomorphic turtle.

Baloo takes the doctor to the [[Sea Duck]], telling him about an emergency. But when Baloo brings the doctor (along with [[Kit Cloudkicker|Kit]] and [[Wildcat]]) back to the flight school, it is completely deserted.

Doctor Cooper starts to grow impatient until he hears Baloo mention Magee's name. The doctor says the airfield hasn't been used since the entrance was almost completely blocked by a landslide. Cooper explains that Joe Magee injured his leg saving fellow pilots from a burning plane. The injured leg left Magee unable to fly again, and sometime after, built the flying school and trained a number of the best pilots.

Finally, the doctor tells Baloo that Magee had passed away twenty years ago.

==Trivia==
*Cooper's voice actor was [[Alan Young]], who was best known for voicing [[Scrooge McDuck]] from [[1974]] until his death in [[2016]].
