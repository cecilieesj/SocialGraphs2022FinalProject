In a downward position, he causes bad luck; in an upright position, he causes good luck. His one true place is at the mini-golf course, making miniature golfers score holes-in-one.

==Background==
===Personality===
Shoe appears to be mute, but also friendly and sociable as shown when he tried to make friends with [[Stitch]]. Unlike most experiments, Shoe doesn't mean to cause chaos intentionally; it is merely the way he was programmed. He is also shown to be very sensitive about his bad luck powers, as seen when he overheard [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] say that he cannot seem to change his bad luck and is apparently useless. He felt abandoned and hurt after hearing this and even ran away. However, when Lilo learned that Shoe could generate good luck, she apologized to him after finding him, and he seemed to forgive Lilo when he hugged her.

===Physical appearance===
Shoe is a green, lanky experiment with a horseshoe-shaped head, a pointed face with black eyes, small dark purple round nose, and two long curved horns with white tips that are shaped like a horseshoe. The horns can be flipped upward or downward.

===Powers and abilities===
Shoe is a luck-manipulating experiment. When his cranial horseshoe, or the "horns" on his head, are facing down, bad luck occurs; when the horseshoe is turned up, good luck occurs. The events can be predicted to happen whenever the tips of his horns glow, and also a faint bleep is heard. Shoe cannot control the luck his powers provide to himself or others, however, and is dependent on the horns' position.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 113 was the 113th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to generate bad luck, but could also cause good luck. 113 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 113's pod landing on a miniature golf course.

113's pod was used as a golf ball, where a miniature golfer whacked it. The pod landed in the moat obstacle, activating 113, who then went around the island causing bad luck.

[[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] had been informed about 113, but [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] refused to have a bad luck experiment. Gantu then had a squabble with [[Reuben|Experiment 625]], who tried to tell the former about 113's good luck ability. When Reuben later managed to reveal this to Gantu (and deftly tape-recorded his earlier protests), the latter decided to track down and capture 113.

Meanwhile, 113, traveled to the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]], where his bad luck caused [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s jeep to break down, forcing her to walk to work. He was later caught raiding the kitchen by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and [[Pleakley]]. 113 kept generating bad luck for Lilo's ''[[Pelekai ʻohana|ʻohana]]'', despite their best efforts to change his bad luck effects and hide him someplace where the bad luck he created could not affect them.

When Lilo reluctantly admitted that 113, named Shoe, was nothing more than a jinx, the latter, unfortunately, overheard Lilo and promptly left, feeling hurt and abandoned. After Jumba revealed that Shoe could generate good luck, Lilo and Stitch set out to find him. Shoe was sitting alone on a cliff when the two discovered him, but before they could save him, Gantu overtook Stitch and scooped Shoe in a container. Despite being captured, Shoe's bad luck allowed him to evade both Gantu and Stitch.

After a series of mishaps, Gantu managed to reclaim Shoe and turned the latter's horns upward, causing him to generate good luck for Gantu. Shoe was then left alone on [[Lahui Beach|the beach]] after his good luck caused Gantu to become rich, making the experiment feel just as useless as when he generated bad luck.

Shoe was eventually found by Lilo, who apologized to the former for giving up on him. After generating good luck for Lilo's ''ʻohana'' and bad luck for Gantu, Shoe found his one true place at a mini-golf course (the same one where he was activated) using his "good luck setting" to allow golfers to score holes-in-one.

In "[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]", Shoe was one of the wanted fugitives who had already been captured in an alternate future where Hämsterviel ruled Earth.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Shoe, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], Pleakley, [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Shoe participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Lilo stated that she didn't name 113 "Shoe" because of his horseshoe-like horn, but because she thinks he needs shoes, despite the fact that none of the experiments wear shoes.
**According to [[Jess Winfield]] on his TV Tome thread, in real life, Shoe was actually partly named after a production associate, Jennifer "Shoe" Hsyu.<ref name="WinfieldTVTome">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page02.html|website=[[wikipedia:TV.com|TV Tome]]|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|access-date=July 21, 2022|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134521/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page02.html|archivedate=March 19, 2016|quote=I'll leave you with a bit of fun trivia about today's episode "Shoe." The name (aside from the obvious reference to the character's horseshoe-head design) was inspired by our fantastic Production Associate, Jennifer 'Shoe' Hsyu.|date=July 19, 2004}}</ref>
*According to Jumba, the moment he created Shoe, his [[Galaxy Defense Industries|laboratory]] exploded.
*Altering the position of Shoe's U-shaped horn in order to reverse his powers is the same way to reverse the effects of [[Dorkifier]]. Also, the closeness of their numbers (113 and 122) and movable horn feature may suggest that Jumba had been inspired by the same DNA source when creating both experiments. This would be a similar concept to how Jumba reused some of Twang's DNA when creating [[Bragg]].
*Shoe's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is purple.
*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Shoe as: "Experiment 113. Primary function: Negative event generator."
*His number is a likely reference to the number 13, which is considered unlucky by most Western cultures.
*Shoe's holographic silhouette appeared in "[[Snooty (episode)|Snooty]]".
**Shoe is shown to have two different graphic designs on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]].
