}}'''Lyth''' is a character who only appears in the Ultraheroes saga. She is [[Eega Beeva]]'s assistant.

==History==
Lyth's first appearance is when she arrives to [[Mickey Mouse]]'s house to tell Eega Beeva that somebody is seemingly seeking for the Ultrapods to rebuild the superweapon known as the Ultramachine. This prompts Eega Beeva to reunite the four greatest heroes of [[Calisota]] (plus two new ones) to form the Ultraheroes and get the Ultrapods before the [[Bad-7]].

Lyth turns out to be the seventh and last Ultrapod needed to complete the Ultramachine.
