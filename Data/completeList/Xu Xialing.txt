'''Xu Xialing''' is a character in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'', played by Meng'er Zhang. She is the sister of [[Shang-Chi]], she is the daughter of [[Xu Wenwu]], and she is the current leader of the [[Ten Rings]].

==Background==
Xialing was born between 2003 and 2004. She is the daughter [[Xu Wenwu]] and Ying Li, and younger sister of Shang-Chi. She and her family lived in the Ten Rings Headquarters in [[China]] for many years happily, until her father's dark past led to the death of her mother. As Wenwu couldn't look at Xialing without being reminded of his late wife, he forbade his daughter from training with her brother and the rest of his men. Xialing instead learned martial arts by observing and copying the movements and techniques until she mastered them herself.

==Abilities==
*'''Bilingualism''': Xialing is fluent in her own native Mandarin language as well as English.

==Trivia==
*Xialing's name in translation means "summer."
*Xialing was based on other Marvel characters such as Zheng Bao Yu, Sister Dagger, and Sasha Hammer.
*In the comics, the [[Xu Wenwu|Mandarin]] has a daughter named Sasha Hammer, also known as Detroit Steel, who was also the granddaughter of Justin Hammer.
