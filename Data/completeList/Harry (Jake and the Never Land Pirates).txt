==Role in the series==
Harry first appeared in the episode "[[Big Bug Valley!]]" While aboard the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]], [[Captain Hook]] overhears Bones reading to his pet and demanded to know who Bones was speaking to. Bones introduced Harry to the captain, much to Hook's horror, as he couldn't keep himself from dancing out of fear of the mere sight of the spider. It wasn't until [[Mr. Smee]] arrives on deck, and reminds Bones about Captain Hook's fear of spiders, that Bones puts Harry away. Harry reappears at the end of the episode after Hook is bested yet again by [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his pirate crew, and losing the treasure of the golden caterpillar. Hook and his crew return to the Jolly Roger feeling low. In an attempt to cheer his captain up, Bones bring Harry out again, scaring Hook so much he leaps overboard into the Never Sea.

Harry makes a reappearance in the episode "[[Cubby's Tall Tale]]." Captain Hook and his scurvy crew manage to steal Cubby's map to his prized treasure on top of Hidden Peak. But first they had to venture through Thunder Tunnel, which was said to be the home of the feared giant jumping spider. Hook and his crew find themselves entangled in a large web and feared they would become the spider's next meal. But much to their surprise, the web was created by Bones' pet spider, who giggles off.
