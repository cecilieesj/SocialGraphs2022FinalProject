'''Vestia''' is a formerly rogue Jaquin who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. She is the older twin sister of [[Cruz]]. They both affiliated with [[Shuriki]] and her followers until she was vanquished by [[Princess Elena]]. Cruz and Vestia later mannaged to redeem theselves and were accepted back among their kind. They are now both once again Guardians of Avalor.

==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==
Vestia was mentioned in "[[Shapeshifters]]" by Cruz after he was imprisoned for treason.

Vestia has made her debut appearance in "[[The Race for the Realm]]" as an antagonist. She will appear with her brother. After busting him out of jail, she and Cruz were given shelter by Troyo to protect them from [[Chief Zephyr]] and the other Jaquins as they were wanted fugitives now.

When they are introduced to Shuriki and Fiero, the twin siblings agree to take the sorcerers to Vallaestrella to retrieve the two pieces of the Scepter of Night hidden there by Alacazar before he fled Avalor. When they arrive, they run into a trio of Flaringos, who direct them to Vallaestrella's highest mountain, mentioning that Elena and Naomi were on their way there to get the Jewel to the Scepter of Night. When Vestia and Cruz reach the mountain and confront Elena and Naomi, alongside Skylar and Luna, Vestia and Fiero stay behind to attack Naomi and Luna when Elena takes Skylar to go after Shuriki and Cruz for her personal revenge. As a result, Fiero and Vestia are able to overpower Naomi and Luna and retrieve the Jewel while Shuriki and Cruz return to retrieve the Mount after Naomi dropped it. They return to Avalor, where the Delgados had retrieved the Staff from Mateo and Gabe. Shuriki reunites the three pieces into the complete Scepter of Night, before beginning her training under Fiero to learn how to wield it properly for her second attempt to take over Avalor.

Vestia remains with Shuriki's group and her brother Cruz, acting as transport for Fiero while Shuriki rides Cruz. After Shuriki is able to divert Elena and Skylar's attention with setting Isabel's tower ablaze with her Dark Fire spell so she and Cruz can escape, they join Fiero and Vestia as they decide to flee deeper into the jungle for their own protection, unaware that Elena has seen them with the Scepter of Light's Farsight spell.

Later, in "[[Song of the Sirenas]]", Vestia and Cruz fly Fiero and Shuriki to Nueva Vista to confront Elena, who had traveled there with her family to see her cousin, [[Duke Cristóbal]]. However, after they stop to land, they are engaged by Migs, Luna, and Skylar. However, Shuriki is able to distract them long enough for her group to escape, leaving them to fly ahead to warn Elena.

Later on, Vestia joins Shuriki and the others with confronting Isabel, her grandparents, and Esteban, and having them locked up in the tower as she takes over the summer palace, only to learn from the Duke, who was a former ally to Shuriki during her original takeover, that Elena survived her earlier battle with Shuriki and is being locked up with the rest of her family. Livid, Shuriki has the Duke take her, Vestia, and the others to the tower, only to find the Royal Family being busted out by Naomi, Gabe, and Mateo with Migs, Luna, and Skylar. Vestia joins Shuriki and the others as they pursue Elena as she tries to flee on her yacht, but during the fight, Vestia is struck by a spell that freezes her solid, rendering her unable to assist further in her frozen state. After Cruz returns to report on Shuriki's demise by Elena, with the Jewel from the Scepter of Night being the only thing left of her, the Delgados use this to their advantage and prepare to flee, but Cruz demands that they thaw his sister first, who is still frozen, only being able to move her eyes and speak in muffled words.

Vestia and Cruz soon find themselves and the Delgados being pursued by Gabe and two of his Royal Guardsmen in "[[Snow Place Like Home]]". Victor tries to throw them off their trail with a blizzard, but when he and Carla insult and disrespect Vestia and Cruz one time too many, fed up with the lack of respect, Vestia and her brother dump the Delgados and leave them to fend for themselves in the blizzard.

Some time later, in "[[Not Without My Magic]]", Cruz and Vestia have returned to Vallaestrella, but are still pursued by King Verago's guards for their treason. After losing them, upon seeing Elena and Skylar enter the Jaquin homeworld, they decide their only option left is to ask for forgiveness from Elena and King Verago and hope they will be merciful. However, trailing Elena to the lair of [[Quita Moz]], after Elena and Skylar leave shortly after Quita Moz does to take the damaged Scepter of Light to be fixed by the other Sun Birds, Vestia decides to use one of the magical creatures sealed in the various jars in the lair as a means to show their reformation to Elena and Verago. However, the magical fire imp they unleash proves to be too much for them to handle, and when confronted by Elena and Verago, they confess to letting it out and ask to help. Verago instead has them arrested and taken to the Jaquin Royal Palace to await punishment, but when the palace is set ablaze by the fire imp, Vestia and Cruz provide some valuable information to Elena and Verago, revealing that the imp was looking for its creator, [[Chatana]], who the Jaquins had banished long ago. Though still wary of them, Verago releases Cruz and Vestia to help capture the fire imp, and when they prove themselves with helping lure it to Elena for her to capture with Skylar and his father, Verago agrees to pardon them for their past transgressions, and Vestia and her brother depart to continue making amends with the rest of the Jaquins.

Vestia returns in the series finale "[[Coronation Day]]." She and Cruz have not only made peace with all the Jaquins again alongside King Verago, but are also now part of their official team to protect Avalor. They've even reconciled with Victor and Carla. After flying Elena and her team to their destination, Vestia takes part in the fight against Ash and her army with great determination. After [[Antonia Bello|Antonia]] and Mateo have frozen [[Tziloco]] and [[Pili]], and [[Naomi Turner|Naomi]] has imprisoned Chatana in her Milagro, Vestia and Antonia take them to the Summer Palace and lock them up in the tower. After regrouping with the others, they find that Ash has released the [[Four Shades of Awesome]]. Vestia continues to help fly Elena's team to wherever they need to go and helps them however she can. In the end, Vestia, along with Cruz and the other Jaquins happily attends Elena's coronation to become Queen of Avalor.
