At first she is only briefly mentioned in the second Duck Avenger story by Guido Martina, until Marco Gervasio creates her a background.

Dolly Paprika's real name is Dolly Duck, a rich lady who, tired of the aristocrats and their snobbish ways, decides to follow Fantomius' steps. This doesn't mean she's insensitive; Dolly sincerely loves Fantomius, and gets worried when he elaborates particularly risky plans.
