====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Zainab arrives with [[Owais]] to greet her cousin, [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] and aunt, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] at the airport. When they arrive, Zainab calls out to them, and as Kamala walks over, Zainab puts a garland around the two, in celebration of her arrival. Muneeba's mother and Kamala's grandmother, Sana, also arrives to escort Kamala and Muneeba, back to her house. Zainab says her goodbyes, as Kamala and Muneeba leave.

The next day, Zainab and Owais arrive to Sana's house to fetch Kamala for a day out. They enter Kamala's room, where they find her fast asleep. Zainab prompts her to wake up, and informs Kamala they've planned a whole day out.

The groups first visit is to the boat club, but they are denied entrance, because Kamala is wearing jeans, which they have a policy against, forcing them to eat out on the patio. Zainab laments about missing the buffet outside, and suggests they go the mall for Kamala.

After they eat, Zainab and Owais give Kamala a tour of their surroundings and the historical significances, and the trio browse the local markets. After a while, Zainab tells them they need to go because they have friends waiting for coffee. Kamala inquires about checking a train station for historical purposes, but Zainab tells Kamala they're going, and to just meet them after.

Zainab later arrives with Owais to Sana's home to help Muneeba, who can't seem to locate Kamala.
