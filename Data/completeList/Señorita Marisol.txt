==Role in the Series==
Señorita Marisol makes her debut in "[[Crystal in the Rough]]". She first appears when [[Princess Isabel]] arrives in her classroom.

They then move on to Chemistry where the students learn how to make Avaloran Rubber and Señorita Marisol is impressed when Isabel is the first to make hers. However, the next day, Senorita Marisol is confused when Isabel starts acting like Quique. When [[Princess Elena]] shows up, Señorita Marisol tells her about the field trip and Elena insists on going with the class. At the Crystal Caverns, Señorita Marisol gives the class a tour. When Elena reveals that Isabel, Amara, and Quique wandered off, she punishes the trio by sending them back to school to clean the schoolyard.
