'''Maestro D'Elfman''' is a [[Disney Parks]] character.

==History==

===Background===
Maestro D'Elfman was a conductor and likely composer who was a member of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]] at some point during the 19th century. He was considerably close with Lord [[Henry Mystic]] and appeared to have assisted him with his music-room in Mystic Manor.

===Development History===
Maestro D'Elfman is a tribute to [[Danny Elfman]], who composed the soundtrack to (among other things) Mystic Manor and the soundtrack to the [[Nightmare Before Christmas]], which was adapted for [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]].

==Appearances==

===Mystic Manor===
Maestro D'Elfman appears in portrait form in Mystic Manor, showing him situated within Mystic's music room. Later in the attraction, guests traverse this music room following its possession from the [[Balinese Music Box]].

==Trivia==
*Despite being one of the first S.E.A. members introduced and actually visualized, D'Elfman probably contains the least amount of attraction references of any society member.
*For unknown reasons, the maestro was not present for the S.E.A. meeting of 1899.
**It is possible he was simply unavailable.
**Another possibility is that he died prior to this meeting.
**It is also possible that he was simply not a member at the time of the meeting in 1899.
