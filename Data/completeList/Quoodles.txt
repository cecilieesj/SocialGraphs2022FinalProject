==Appearances==
*"[[Space Adventure (Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episode)|Space Adventure]]" (Space Pirate Pete's Helper)
*"[[Minnie-rella]]" (Minnie's helper instead of Toodles)
*"[[Minnie's Winter Bow Show]]" (Minnie's helper instead of Toodles)
*"[[Donald's Brand New Clubhouse]]" (cameo)
*"[[Oh Toodles]]" (cameo)

==Trivia==
*Since "Space Adventure", her faceplate screen saver changed from how it used to look when she is being used for the Quoodles tool. Her faceplate screen saver used to look like Toodles' screensaver with the circled dots and the sky blue background, but in an episode where she is tagging along with Minnie, her faceplate screen saver is a peachy pinkish color like how her face is and different color dots.
*She is capable of speaking chicken.
*In the clubhouse, Toodles's Mousekadoer has changed to Quoodles Mousekadoer for her to obtain her Quoodles tools to help Minnie.
*Quoodles appears to be a little ditzy as she wanted to test the spider web despite being aware of its sticky nature.
*Toodles and Quoodles have a huge mutual crush on each other.
*Out of the five characters that acts similarly to Toodles, Quoodles is the only such character to have appeared in more than one episode, unlike [[Sheamus]], [[Woodles]], [[Boodles]], and [[Goofles]], who have each appeared in just one episode.
