'''Arthur Rizzic''' appeared in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "The Mighty Megalosaurus."

A mammal with a protruding snout, Rizzic escaped from the dinner table at [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sinclair_Home the Sinclair Home], only to find that [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] had destroyed his tree home. After Earl spared Rizzic following a heart-to-heart chat, the prey creature became [[Bradley P. Richfield|B. P. Richfield's]] personal assistant.

Although this was Rizzic's only appearance, the puppet type would be recycled throughout the series, usually voiced by [[Brian Henson]]. [[Steve Whitmire]] actually performed the puppet in "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_301:_Nature_Calls Nature Calls]" while Henson performed the voice.
