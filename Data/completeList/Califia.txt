'''Califia''' is a character who appeared in the now-extinct [[Disney California Adventure]] attraction, [[Golden Dreams]]. She is based on the fictional queen of the same name whom the state of [[California]] is named after.

==History==

===Background===
In the Golden Dreams attraction, Califia is described as the spirit of California who narrates about what happened in California a long time ago just before modern conveniences arrived in later years.

===Development History===
The Golden Dreams attraction opened in California where the Califia statue was displayed inside the theater, as well as a mural depicting Califia also shown outside the theater. After Golden Dreams closed in [[September 7]], [[2008]], the Golden Dreams theater was demolished in [[2009]] as well as having the mural being removed in order to make way for a new attraction, [[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure]] which opened in summer [[2011]].

==Role in the attraction==
Califia is depicted on a mural outside the auditorium's entrance where she is seen next to the now-extinct [[Wikipedia:California grizzly bear|California grizzly bear]] (''Ursus arctos californicus'').

Throughout the attraction, a statue of Califia herself is displayed inside the theater and when the show begins, a projection of Califia's voice actress appears on the face of the statue herself just as she introduces herself to the audience. She narrates the history of what California was like before there were modern conveniences across the state of California over the years. After narrating about the past events, Califia explains to the audience, "If there's anything that you ever need, you just let me know" just as she tells the audience to take care of themselves after learning about the history of California just as the projection of Califia's voice actress turns off just before guests leave the attraction. Her face briefly reanimated to remind a woman that she forgot her bag

==Trivia==
*[[Whoopi Goldberg]], the actress who starred in the former Golden Dreams attraction in California Adventure, also voiced [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Shenzi]], one of the three hyenas serving as one of [[Scar]]'s minions featured in Disney's [[1994]] animated feature film, ''[[The Lion King]]''.
