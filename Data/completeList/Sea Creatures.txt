}}The '''Sea Creatures''' are antagonistic monsters from [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2012]] animated film ''[[Frankenweenie]]''. They are based on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-Monkeys Sea-Monkey] brand of brine shrimp pets, and their characteristics are based on ''The Creature from the Black Lagoon'' and the 1984 film ''Gremlins''.

==Description==
For the New Holland Elementary School science fair, [[Toshiaki]] and [[Bob (Frankenweenie)|Bob]] try to concoct an experiment utilizing Sea-Monkeys as their subject. The experiment doesn't come along very well, but when the boys discover the secret of electricity from [[Victor Frankenstein|Victor]]'s lab, Bob gets the idea to try it out on the Sea-Monkeys on his own. The description on the package doesn't come close to matching the result when Bob unleashes an army of little warriors. Wreaking havoc everywhere, the mischievous Gremlin like Sea Creatures are not easy to stop.
