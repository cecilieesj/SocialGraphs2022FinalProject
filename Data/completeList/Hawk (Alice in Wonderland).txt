The '''Hawk''' is a minor character from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1951]] animated feature film ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Hawk is mostly known for pushing the [[Toucan (Alice in Wonderland)|Toucan]] when he is used by the [[Dodo]] and the [[Queen of Hearts]] as boat.

==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''===
The Hawk was first seen as [[Alice]] was floating on the sea in a bottle, were he is pushing the [[Dodo]], thatâ€™s on riding on the [[Toucan (Alice in Wonderland)|Toucan]] from behind. On the shore, the Hawk was seen in the caucus race. This race involved running around until one gets dry, but the attempts were hampered by incoming waves. While in the race, Alice lands on floor, causing him to walk over her.

Near the end of the film, the Hawk reappears in another caucus race. After, the caucus race is over he and the Toucan help the [[Queen of Hearts]], to catch up with Alice. Then as Alice leaves [[Wonderland]], she wakes up, her adventure in Wonderland was all a dream, as she is woken up by her sister.
