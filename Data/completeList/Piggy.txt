'''Piggy''' is a character from the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode, "[[Our Homespun Melody]]".

==Role in the series==
Piggy is introduced by [[Mickey Mouse]] where he sings the titular song, "[[Our Homespun Melody (song)|Our Homespun Melody]]" where he is seen as a piglet. As Mickey tells the audience to meet his singing pig, the audience is overjoyed with Piggy's performance at the county fair and as Mickey spends his time with him, Piggy ends up gaining fame from audiences, making Piggy a popular animal. However, when Piggy grows up into an adult pig, Mickey tries to check up on him to make sure he is okay so that he can regain his voice from before, even with help from [[Donald Duck]]. When Mickey brings Piggy back on stage to the audience, the sign "Piggy is back" suddenly tips over, only to reveal a phonograph playing audio of Piggy when he was a piglet, much to the crowd's disgust and Mickey's sadness.

Feeling sad after the crowd angrily left for a disappointment, Mickey notices Piggy singing along with his baritone voice noticing that Piggy is able to sing again, Piggy can no longer make the same voice he had when he was a piglet so Mickey introduces him to the audience as a baritone-singing pig just as the audience happily reacts to Piggy now performing on stage as an adult pig. Happy to have Piggy back and sing with him once again, Mickey happily sings along with Piggy just as Donald, [[Goofy]], one of the judges, one of the townspeople, a cat, and some sunflowers watch Mickey and Piggy's performance in exicement just as the short ends with Mickey and Piggy singing, "That's our homespun melody!".

==Trivia==
*Elyse Willis, who did the voice of Piggy as a piglet, also wrote the [[Our Homespun Melody|titular episode]]'s [[Our Homespun Melody (song)|lyrics]].
