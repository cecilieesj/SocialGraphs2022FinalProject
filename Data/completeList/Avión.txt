==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==
Avión first appears in "[[Flight of the Jaquins]]" when he arrives from Vallestrella, the Jaquins' home realm, for Guardian training with [[Ciela]] and [[Nico]] under Skylar. On they way to Avalor City, they spot the Pueblo De Ono, the home of the Noblins. After Skylar explains that the Noblins are magical shapeshifters that have the Golden Touch, Nico insists they stop there. Upon arriving, Nico and Skylar instantly get distracted playing with the Noblins to the concern of Avión, who fears they will be late. When Ciela decides they have to go to Avalor City themselves, Avión goes with her. On the way they run into [[Troyo]] the magical coyote, who he learns too late is an enemy of the Jaquins when he ensnares them in a trap. They get freed by Skylar and Nico.
