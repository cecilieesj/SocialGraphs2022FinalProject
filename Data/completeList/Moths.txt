They are the only friends Luna Girl has.

They also serve as the secondary villain sidekicks.

==Background==
===Personality===
They follow all of Luna Girl's orders and attempt to complete them to the best of their ability. The moths love her, despite her often mean and verbally-abusive treatment to them.

===Physical appearance===
The moths are small and white in appearance. They are each about the size of Luna Girl's fingers but can be large when flying in groups.

==Trivia==
*Even though Luna Girl often treats them quite poorly in some episodes, they still appear to care for her.
*They almost left her in "[[Catboy and the Butterfly Brigade]]" after a large amount of criticism and mistreatment, but went back to Luna Girl when she became sad about it.
*They may be able to partly speak in English, as they sang the "We can't think of a rhyme!" portion of the PJ Masks' theme song in "[[Catboy's Tricky Ticket]]".
*They are shown to be great painters in "[[Catboy's Flying Fiasco]]".
*They made noise for the first time when Catboy used his Super Cat Ears in "[[Owlette and the Giving Owl]]".
*One of them gains a new appearance and a name: Motsuki.
**She is also the first moth to transform into a humanoid in "[[Moth on the Moon]]."
