She is designed to tickle anyone into submission, rendering opponents helpless with laughter; they sometimes even cause an accident in the process. She was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]". 

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 275 was the 275th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to tickle people into utter hysterics. 275 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All the experiments were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 275 was activated and captured by [[Gantu]].

In "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", Tickle-Tummy was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission. She then tickled [[Reuben]] into hysterics, after he denied being ticklish.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Despite not physically appearing, the first 624 experiments, presumably including Tickle-Tummy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Tickle-Tummy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Tickle-Tummy made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Frenchfry]], [[Squeak]], [[Pix]], and [[Houdini]] after [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] kicked them out for being considered useless.

==Trivia==
*Tickle-Tummy was activated off-screen.
*Tickle-Tummy is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having dark blue eyes instead. Interestingly, she shares this trait with [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], [[Welco]], and [[Witch (Lilo & Stitch)|Witch]], three other female experiments.
*Tickle-Tummy and [[Stamen]] are the only experiments rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]" that had never been seen or referenced before. [[Nosox]] had never been seen before, but was mentioned in "[[Amnesio (episode)|Amnesio]]" and seen in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form in "[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]".
*Tickle-Tummy, [[Phantasmo]], [[Fudgy]], [[Remmy]], and Witch are the only known experiments to have arms but no legs.
**Interestingly, excluding Fudgy, all of these experiments are capable of levitation. Remmy is always seen levitating. Phantasmo and Witch primarily levitate but often possess objects or living beings to move by other means. Tickle-Tummy is also able to levitate, but has been seen bouncing as well.
***Tickle-Tummy and [[Cannonball]] are the only known experiments that mostly bounce when traversing land.
*Tickle-Tummy's appearance changed between her debut in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' and her second franchise appearance in ''[[Stitch!]]''. In the former, her torso has a light pink stomach surrounded by a pattern of purple and blue markings, whereas the anime removes the stomach and blue markings, leaving only the purple markings. It is likely that this was done to simplify her design for economic purposes.
*Tickle-Tummy is one of the few experiments to not have her one true place revealed.
*She is also one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*Tickle-Tummy is the only experiment that was not on the list of the original 626 experiments in the end credits of ''Leroy & Stitch'', but she is called 275 in the ''Stitch!'' anime. 275 is the number [[Wormhole]] is listed as in the end credits; however, in the anime, Wormhole is called Experiment 272, which was originally the number of an unconfirmed experiment called Mamf. When asked about the numbering, [[Jess Winfield]] stated: "The best I can tell you about Tickletummy/Wormhole is that Jumba's genius does not extend to keeping a tidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]]. There is some confusion in his records regarding Tickletummy, Wormhole, and a third experiment named Mamf, with different lists giving different numbers for them. Perhaps it will be sorted out someday."
