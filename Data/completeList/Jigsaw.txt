|quote = }}'''Billy Russo''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appeared in ''[[The Punisher]]'', played by [[Ben Barnes]]. He is a notorious crime boss that controls much of the organized crime that [[Kingpin]] and [[Mariah Dillard]] don't control. An accident disfigured his face, resulting in a scarred face that vaguely resembles a jigsaw puzzle, hence his supervillain codename. Jigsaw is [[Punisher|the Punisher]]'s arch-nemesis, as Punisher is determined to dismantle Jigsaw's criminal operations. Prior to this, Billy was a US marine under the command of William Rawlings and Ray Schoonover, and was best friends with Frank until Frank found out about his role in his family's death.
