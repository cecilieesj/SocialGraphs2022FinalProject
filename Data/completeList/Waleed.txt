Waleed first appears in the [[Seeing Red|fourth episode]]. [[Red Dagger|Kareem]] brings [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]] to their headquarters, where Waleed welcomes her, as the descendant of Aisha. He teaches her about the [[Order of the Red Daggers|organizations]] function, and explains to Kamala, the nature of [[Djinn]] and the [[Noor Dimension]]. He stands before a map, and places a device above it, creating a holographic map, juxtaposed over the first, and points to it as a display in how their world and the Noor Dimension coexist. A glass display emerges from the chambers ground, and two regions are showcased, separated by a wall of light. Waleed explains there are multiple dimensions they cannot see, and they are currently looking at the Noor Dimension, a world connected to theirs, but hidden, behind the Veil of Noor, which acts as a barrier, between the two worlds. Waleed warns that if the [[Clandestines]] were to use Kamala's [[bangle]] to tear down the veil, they'd unleash the Noor Dimension, onto their world, until nothing is left. He emphasizes the importance in keeping the bangle safe. Kamala looks down onto her bangle, and Waleed notices an inscription, he was previously unaware of. The message translates to "What you seek, is seeking you", and concludes it must’ve held important to someone.

Kamala later returns to their headquarters, and displays her powers for Waleed and Kareem. He hands her a jacket on the organizations behalf, in honor of her heritage, and shared alliance, when he Clandestines suddenly smash through the ceiling. Waleed calls for Kareem to get Kamala out, and begins sparring with the Djinn. He barricades the doorway, as the two teenagers makes an exit, and battles the Clandestines, as the room covers is engulfed in smoke. He spars long enough, before breaking through the glass screen, and the trio leave together.

They get on-board on an auto rickshaw, driven by Kareem, and are pursued by their enemies, in a truck. The truck bangs into their rickshaw, turning the vehicles onto its side, and against the trucks speed. Kamala manages to create a construct, which pushes the three away, causing the truck to topple on the side on the road. They are pursued next by Najma in another auto rickshaw, so Waleed detaches the carriage, from the bike, Kamala and Kareem, are riding. Waleed fends Najma off, giving Kamala and Kareem time to escape, and leads her onto a balcony. He throws two daggers, into the side of a building, next to the one he’s one, and uses them as a grapple, as he leaps over. Najma jumps over and joins him, when Waleed spots Kamala and Kareem, pursued by [[Saleem]], in an alley below him. He throws two knives in Salem’s direction, and successfully hits him, but is stabbed by Najma in the back. She pushes his body, off the building, killing him.
