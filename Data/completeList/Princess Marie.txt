'''Princess Marie''' is a character who appears in the series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. She is a princess like [[Calla]], but she is known to be spoiled and self-centered.

Introduced as a minor antagonist for Princess Calla when she accompanies her father [[King Jean-Claude]] on a routine state visit to [[King Gregor]]'s [[Dunwyn Castle]], she is later reformed during her second and final appearance, when the two are forced to band together in order to defeat the conquer-hungry [[Marquis de Bouillabaisse]], and the two princesses part as friends.

Marie even becomes aware of the existence of the [[Gummi Bears]], when [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], and [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] travel to her home country in order to help save the day.

== Background Information ==
Princess Marie looks a bit like a young version of the evil witch [[Lady Bane]], but Marie's birth mother is never spoken of, and no connection between the two is ever established.

== Trivia ==
*The French accent [[Kath Soucie]] used for Marie is very similar to the one she used for fan favorite [https://tinytoons.fandom.com/wiki/Fifi_La_Fume Fifi LaFume] from [[w:Tiny Toon Adventures|Tiny Toon Adventures]].
*Princess Marie is one of a relatively small group of humans who find out about the existence of [[Gummi Bears]] during the course of the series.
