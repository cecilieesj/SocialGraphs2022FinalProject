== Role ==
In turn-of-the-century New Mexico, Lobo, a wolf-pup consumed by curiosity, meets an angry rattler in the course of his investigations and has to be rescued by his parents. He becomes the inseparable companion of an antelope, but when winter comes his mother and father are killed and Lobo must fend for himself. In his maturity he is the smartest, most dangerous wolf on the range, and he becomes a pack leader, taking a black female, Sombra, for his mate. Their first litter, born in a deserted Indian cliff dwelling, is accessible only by means of a tree trunk across a gorge. The reward for Lobo's capture mounts until there is a $1,000 price on his head. Relying on the devotion of wolves to their families, a professional hunter manages to snare Sombra and use her as a lure. But Lobo leads his pack to create a cattle stampede, a diversion that enables him to liberate his mate and strike out for unsettled territory.

== Trivia ==
* "Lobo" means "wolf" in Spanish.
* The real Lobo died shortly after being lured into traps shortly after his mate Blanca was killed by the cattlemen. Seton couldn't bring himself to finish the job, but Lobo died in captivity shortly after being caught, which he attributed to a broken heart. Seton memorialized Lobo in his book "Animals I Have Known".
