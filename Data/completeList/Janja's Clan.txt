'''Janja's Clan''' are the primary antagonists in the [[2015]] TV film ''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]'', and used to be the secondary antagonists in its [[2016]] follow-up series, ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. They are a small group of male spotted hyenas who reside in the [[Outlands]] and are led by [[Janja]]. They are descended from the [[Hyena Clan|hyenas]] who aided [[Scar]] when he became King of the [[Pride Lands]].

Throughout the film and series, the clan aids Janja in wreaking havoc in the Pride Lands such as hunting the animals who live there, but are always stopped by The Lion Guard, led by [[Kion]] (the son of the Pride Lands' current King and Queen [[Simba]] and [[Nala]]). They are following in their ancestors' foot steps and are serving Scar, who has returned as a spirit.

However, after Scar almost killed the clan by setting them up to be burned to death along with the Lion Guard and royal family as to prevent a possible revolt due to Janja's growing hesitation, Janja completely cut ties with Scar and joins Jasiri's clan.

==Trivia==
*The hyenas in Janja's clan are noted to be descendants of the hyenas from the original Lion King film.
*Though Janja is the leader of his clan, a real hyena clan is typically led by a female.
*Though Janja's clan is undeniably ruthless and greedy, the fact that they constantly prey on animals for food makes them the most accurate portrayal of hyenas in the show, as contrary to popular belief, real spotted hyenas actually hunt more than they scavenge.
*There seems to be some confusion about exactly how many hyenas are in Janja's clan. In the episode "[[Rescue in the Outlands]]", Scar orders Janja to take his entire clan to get rid of Jasiri, and when Janja and his clan confront her, there are exactly seven members counting Janja. However, this contradicts with scenes from previous episodes; in the final shot of "[[Tonight We Strike]]", there are ''eight'' hyenas in Janja's clan, and in one of the latter shots of "[[Bring Back a Legend]]", seen in this article's gallery, there are ''nine''.
