'''J. Griffin Remington''' is a tycoon who works for the Atlas Ford Bank in the [[2019]] remake of ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''.

==Background==
Remington offers [[Ringmaster|Max Medici]] to help him make a lot of money for [[V.A. Vandevere]]. However, when it comes to any failure at the circus, he becomes unhappy, planning to close the bank for a failure. Despite him working for Vandevere due to his aggressive actions, it is later shown at the end of the film that he started feeling emotional upon seeing the disaster Vandevere caused to Dreamland at the control center, causing him to reform toward Max.

==Role in the film==
Upon arriving at Vandevere Enterprises, Vandevere introduces Max to Remington, telling him that his priority is to let the circus make a lot of money for Vandevere. They watch the Pink Elephant sequence during showtime. During [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]]'s act, they watch him fly around the tent but the act fails due to him planning to find his mother, [[Mrs. Jumbo]], at [[Nightmare Island]]. Later as the audience angrily leaves, Remington tells Vandevere that Dumbo is an uncontrollable animal, closing the bank for a failure at the circus.

Furthermore, Remington watches [[Colette Marchant]] and Dumbo's performance, however, due to Vandevere's chagrin in the control center, the park catches on fire, destroying everything. Remington emotionally notices Vandevere's betrayal for what he did to it in reaction. Later, to cheer Max up, he decides to buy him a hot dog. It is unknown what happened to him after that.
