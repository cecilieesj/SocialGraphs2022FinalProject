==Role in the film==
Murdock's two sons, [[Mike Murdock|Mike]] and [[Matt Murdock|Matt]], are school bullies of [[Kenny Binder]]. They both disliked [[Elizabeth (Ernest Scared Stupid)|Elizabeth]]'s classroom report about Briarville's legend of [[Trantor]] and [[Phineas Worrell]]. They later destroy Kenny's cardboard haunted house. They're then mistaken for trolls by [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]], but nobody believes him, especially [[Cliff Binder]], the town sheriff, after the exposure of the two trolls really being them. Matt becomes one of [[Trantor]]'s wooden dolls until Ernest defeats Trantor once and for all.
