|status=Active}}The ''' Baby Baboon''' (also known as '''Manu''') is a minor character in ''[[Tarzan (film)|Tarzan]]'' and a recurring character in ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''.

== Appearances ==

=== ''[[Tarzan]]'' ===
The Baby Baboon first appears when [[Jane Porter|Jane]] leaves her expedition group briefly to sketch him when he appears in her path. He doesn't hold still long to look at Jane's progress and likes her drawing of him so much that he steals it from her, Jane gets it back by tricking him. The baboon cries, not getting its way, prompting his entire family to show up and attack Jane. Running for her life, Jane is soon found by [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and the two make a thrilling escape, though Jane loses a boot and her parasol in the chase, which the baby baboon has taken along with the drawing that Tarzan ends up grabbing and handing to him as he floats down to the jungle floor.

Later in the film, the baby baboon and the troop come to help Jane and Tarzan fight [[John Clayton|Clayton]]'s thugs off when they threaten to capture the gorillas. The baby baboon (wearing Jane's missing boot as a hat) signals for an attack and his horde chase after the thug who was about to attack Jane. The baby baboon then kisses Jane and follows his horde.

=== ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]'' ===
The Baby Baboon makes a few appearances throughout the show like in "[[Tarzan and the Lost Treasure|Lost Treasure]]" where he played a vital role in warning Tarzan that [[Count Nikolas Rokoff|Rokoff]] planned to kill him after he got the treasure from him. In "[[Tarzan and the Hidden World|Hidden World]]" he took pictures of himself with [[Samuel T. Philander|Philander]]'s camera, causing him to lose film which caused him to not capture the photos of the dinosaurs as he wanted.

=== ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' ===
The Baby Baboon made a cameo in the second part of the special [[Where's Perry?]] There he was one of the monkeys that [[Candace Flynn]] met in the song ''[[Living with Monkeys]]''.
