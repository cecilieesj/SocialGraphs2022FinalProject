|quote = |children=[[Willy White]] (son)}}'''Robert "Bob" White''' is the former mayor of Bluffington and principal of Beebe Bluff School in ''[[Doug]]'' and the father of [[Willy White]]. He is a stereotypical fast talking glad-handing politician. He is best known for his campaign slogan "Vote for me!" and is overweight, is almost always shown wearing a gray suit and tie, and his white hair is always styled. In the original series, he was eventually voted out of office in favor of Mrs. Dink, after which he takes the role of middle school principal (and Bone's superior) in the Disney series, a role he uses (somewhat unethically) to campaign for his old office back.
