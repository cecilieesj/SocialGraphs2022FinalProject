[[File:Hugh_Edmonson.png|thumb]]'''Hugh Edmundson''' is a green French Fish who goes to [[Freshwater High]].
==Personal Life==
Hugh Edmundson once asked [[Bea Goldfishberg|Bea]] to go to the National Kelp Museum together ("[[Doris Flores Gorgeous]]"). When [[Milo the Fish|Milo]] started recycling at Freshwater, he somehow took off Hugh Edmundson's mouth and turned his frown into a smile ("Legend of the Earth Troll"). In the "Potatoes for Winter" play, Hugh Edmundon played as one of the citizens of El Gratin. He was one of the bakers of the town, the other being [[Bo Gregory]] ("[[Fish School Musical]]").

Hugh Edmundson tried auditioning for the Hokey Poke commercial, although he failed to get the part and swam away, crying ("[[Bea's Commercial]]"). When [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] got perfect scores in French class after he got hold of [[Steve Jackson]]'s hair gel, Hugh Edmundson congratulated him ("[[Hairanoid]]").
