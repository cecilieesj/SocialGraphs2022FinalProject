'''Diane Darcy''' is a female race car driver who appears in ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' and the TV series ''[[Herbie, the Love Bug]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]''===
Diane is the only female race car driver in the Trans-France Race and first meets [[Jim Douglas]] by accident when they bump into each other.

Diane owns a [[1976]] Lancia Scorpion which, like [[Herbie]], is alive, however, she didn't know it at the time. When Herbie first sees her car, he falls in love and she gets annoyed every time he gets in the way while racing. She starts accusing Jim and his mechanic, [[Wheely Applegate]], of trying to keep her out of the race because she's a female driver.

As the film goes on, Diane learns to like Jim and finally believes her car is alive and encourages Herbie to win the race for his friends and loved one.

In the end, Diane starts dating Jim and names her car "[[Giselle (The Love Bug)|Giselle]]."

===''[[Herbie, the Love Bug]]''===
Diane returns in the third episode of the series. She discovers Jim is now dating another woman named Susan MacLane but it is clear they are just good friends. She is last seen racing Herbie when Susan thought it was Jim behind the wheel.
