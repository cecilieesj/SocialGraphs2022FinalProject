'''Chillbeard''' is a character in ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

He is the Master of the North Wind and responsible for the beginning and end of the winter season.

At one time, his son [[Chillbeard Jr.]] steals his wind horn and runs away with it to [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]] in order to create infinite winter, to the disadvantage of the [[Gummi Glen]] [[Gummi Bears|Gummis]] who aren't able to harvest any Gummiberrieas that year, as nothing had flowered during winter.

Chillbeard Sr. tracks down his son, recaptures his wind horn, and threatens punishment, much to Chillbeard Jr.'s dismay. Chillbeard also apologizes to [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] and [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] for all the trouble, telling them that Spring will quickly melt all the snow and have everything back on track.

Chillbeard is last seen flying back home with his son, in a sleigh pulled by two giant polar bears. He uses his wind horn to make an ice slide, so the young Gummi Bears are able to disembark the sleigh and return home.
