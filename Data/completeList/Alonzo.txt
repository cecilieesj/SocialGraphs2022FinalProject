'''Alonzo''' is a character in the [[1996]] live-action film, ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' and its [[2000]] sequel, ''[[102 Dalmatians]]''. He is [[Cruella De Vil]]'s former butler, and an unwilling participant in her scheme to create a [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppy]] coat.

==Appearances==
===''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''===
Alonzo is first seen when [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] enters the [[House of DeVil]] at the start of the live-action film, busy trying to direct several phone calls coming in at once, and quite panicked as a result. However, he still stands up to greet Cruella.

When Cruella takes [[Anita Radcliffe|Anita]] to her office, she scolds Alonzo by reminding him to ask Anita if she wanted a drink. She then shouts at him when he hesitates to take the drawing from Anita and give it to her. Once he does, Cruella tells him to stand somewhere till she needs him. He is then ordered to give the drawing back to Anita when Cruella makes an addition to the design.

He is later seen at Cruella's home, when [[Jasper and Horace|Horace and Jasper]] present the tiger skin coat to Cruella. His hands are shown to have a nervous shake as he pours them tea.

===''[[102 Dalmatians]]''===
After Cruella is released from prison, reformed by Dr. Pavlov's therapy, Alonzo greets her with a gift — a Chinese crested dog, whom she named [[Fluffy (102 Dalmatians)|Fluffy]]. As soon as Cruella arrives back at her house, he is given the job of burying all her furs in an underground chamber, including her design for the Dalmatian puppy coat. Subsequently, he helps her working with the dogs at Second Chance dog shelter.

When Cruella is reverted to normal, Alonzo, desperate to please her, is sent out to steal the puppies needed for her coat, while she meets with furrier [[Jean-Pierre Le Pelt]]. When he shows up with the captured puppies, Le Pelt takes an instant dislike to him, calling him a wormy little man. Alonzo also is landed with the job of looking after Fluffy, as Cruella is back to her dog-hating ways. Alonzo also reluctantly helps place evidence and [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]] to frame [[Kevin Shepherd]] — the owner of the Second Chance dog shelter — for the crime, and then to steal the puppies back from under the police's noses. Upon arriving at the train station, which the Orient Express is taking Cruella, Le Pelt, and the captured Dalmatians to [[Paris]], Alonzo is tasked with eliminating [[Oddball]], as Cruella only wants spotted puppies for her coat. When Oddball manages to elude him, resulting in Alonzo getting his hands run over by a baggage trolley, he decides to let her go and return to the train, telling Cruella she will never see Oddball again.

After arriving in Paris, Alonzo's resentment of Le Pelt grows when the furrier gets to ride in [[Cruella's car]] while he has to follow in the van with the puppies. He is present when Cruella traps Kevin and [[Chloe Simon]] - Cruella's probation officer - in the basement of Le Pelt's sweatshop. Once inside, Alonzo is the first to notice the puppies escaping, although he tries to cover the fact. When Cruella notices, she yells at him for not killing Oddball, then storms off to recapture the puppies, causing Le Pelt to jeer at him again. Finally fed up and having enough with him, Alonzo engages Le Pelt in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in Le Pelt becoming trapped in the hole through which the puppies had escaped, and [[Chomp]] bites Le Pelt on the leg, causing him to scream, and Alonzo gags him by putting a fur tail scarf in his mouth; as the workers cheer for him, Alonzo smiles and takes a bow. Alonzo then immediately frees Kevin, Chloe, and the dogs, telling them that the puppies are in the bakery nearby.

Later, Alonzo shows up at the Second Chance dog shelter, with Fluffy, with eight million pounds for the shelter; on the judge's orders, all of Cruella's money had gone to the dogs' homes of the borough of Westminster — of which "Second Chance" is the only one. While what happened to Alonzo subsequently is unconfirmed, it could be assumed that he started working at Second Chance as well.

==Other appearances==
===''101 Dalmatians: Animated Storybook''===
Alonzo makes a small cameo on the second page of ''101 Dalmatians: Animated Storybook''. If the player clicks on a buzzer, Cruella shall press it and order Alonzo to get to where she is. When he arrives, Cruella asks what took him so long, and he apologizes for it. Cruella then tells him to stand somewhere till she needs him, and he walks off.

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
Whilst this is yet unconfirmed, in the series episode "[[Barnboozled]]", when Cruella moves into the [[Dearly Farm|barn]], she demands to know where her cappuccino maker is, and a butler, having a similar resemblance to Alonzo, appears. He is later seen taking [[Cadpig]]'s squeaky toy from her, when Cruella (annoyed by its noise) demands to have it.
