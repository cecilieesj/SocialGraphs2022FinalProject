This Firebird is a hero from the Epilogue of the Little Einsteins. For the villain, see: ''[[The Firebird]]'' from [[Fantasia 2000]]. And for Captain Jake's Firebird, see: ''[[Wildfire]]''.

'''The Firebird''' is a magic bird that brings music to all of [[Russia]].

==Rocket's Firebird Rescue==

In the story, Firebird was responsible for bringing all the music in Russia and always got away from Katschai. When Katschai finally captured her, he locked her up in a birdcage where she couldn't bring or make any music. Eventually, she was rescued by the Little Einsteins and went back to her duties.

==Trivia==
*Despite her color, she has nothing to do with fire.
*When one of her feathers were taken off, you can use her power for music.
*Her theme song is [[The Firebird Suite|the Firebird Suite]].
*The Firebird is based on Slavic folklore creature [[wikipedia:Firebird_(Slavic_folklore)|Firebird]].
