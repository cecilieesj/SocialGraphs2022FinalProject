==Background==
Ricky is a snarky sweetheart, a B-minus student, and our star. Ricky’s been dating fellow junior Nini for a year. When she unexpectedly breaks up with Ricky, he launches a bold plan to get Nini back — by auditioning to star opposite her in the school’s production of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. Ricky’s class-clowning covers a deep fear that he’s not actually great at anything, except coasting by on charm. Constantly attempting get-rich-quick schemes with best friend and fellow skater Big Red. Stays up too late bingeing GoPro stunt videos on YouTube. Voted “Most likely to sleep through his alarm.”<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/high-school-musical-series-development-190058962.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEpXP_lbnaNwG8QwSOThFxg8k0OE-bmzeDvMcxlx_fBuFs7lBfBWMlOep5W75PWLR6Rbn627s3kSCkfhoQdScKl-hwHb3ZxFc1x1ivSTvn0kPwBe9ev0oNfl8VSJZ7fobphr9mASsYW0-opQhxwbFtFEzyLw9Kfczn8Ea5CivSzA]</ref>

== Biography ==

===Early Life===
Richard Bowen was born in the summer of 2002 to [[Lynne Bowen|Lynne]] and [[Mike Bowen]].

When Ricky was in kindergarten, he met [[Nini Salazar-Roberts]]. Ricky didn't know how to pronounce "Nina", so he just called her "Nini", and it stuck since then. In first grade Nini had decided to call Ricky "Ricky" because "Richard" sounded like an old man's name. Ricky started dating Nini the summer before their sophomore year and broke up in the Summer of 2019, when Nini confessed her love to him after showing him a song she wrote for him and posted on Instagram for their one-year anniversary ("[[I Think I Kinda, You Know]]"). Ricky suggests they take a pause due to her leaving for theatre camp and not being able to express his feelings.

==='''Season One'''===
====[[The Auditions]]====
He decided to audition for the fall musical after his girlfriend, [[Nini Salazar-Roberts]] broke up with him and started going out with another guy named [[E.J. Caswell]] in order to impress her. He ended up getting the lead role, [[Troy Bolton]] after running in late and singing the song that she wrote for him to confess her love.
====[[The Read-Through]]====
After Nini gets upset with him for not taking the musical seriously he thinks about quitting but Gina convinces him to stay. He decides to try harder to learn the dances from the musical which ends up impressing Nini.
====The Wonderstudies====
He tries to leave a voice message to Nini but EJ deletes it before she can see it. He later talks to Big Red about it and he tells him to be the bigger man. Later while in rehearsal with EJ while tossing a ball between each other he hits him in the nose giving him a cut on the mouth. He tries to apologize to EJ in the bathroom but EJ gets mad at him because of the voice mail he left. Ricky later tells Nini not to share such personal messages, tipping her off that EJ has her phone.
