==Background==
According to ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', Miss Quackfaster was originally hired by Scrooge's younger sisters [[Hortense McDuck|Hortense]] and [[Matilda McDuck|Matilda]]. At first, Scrooge did not like the idea of having someone on his payroll, but he got used to her very quickly. In fact, some stories have revealed that Scrooge has come to depend on Miss Quackfaster. Even though Scrooge is a shrewd businessman and can easily smell profit, running basic organizational jobs in his own office is often beyond his capability.

==History==
Miss Quackfaster was created by [[Carl Barks]], and first appeared in ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #36 in the story ''The Midas Touch'' (the same story that introduced [[Magica De Spell]]), and her last name, "Quackfaster", was first used in ''Uncle Scrooge'' #39 in ''A Spicy Tale''. In ''The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'' part 11 (1994) by [[Don Rosa]] she was referred to as Emily, while in Geoffrey Blum's story ''World Wide Witch'' (2001), her full name was given as Florence Quackfaster<ref>''World Wide Witch'', printed in ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #320</ref><ref>https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/a/a1/Florencequack.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20180523124318</ref>. The character was also known as '''Miss Typefast''' in a number of stories (including Don Rosa's ''[[A Matter of Some Gravity]]'').

==Appearances==
===''[[DuckTales]]''===
On the show ''DuckTales'', she was called '''Mrs. Featherby'''. She appeared in the episodes "[[Dinosaur Ducks]]", "[[Hero for Hire]]", "[[Blue Collar Scrooge]]" and "[[Yuppy Ducks]]", as well as [[1990]]'s ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]''.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
In the reboot series, Quackfaster works as Scrooge's archivist in the McDuck archives, located below [[the Money Bin]]. Like the new show's version of Gyro Gearloose she is portrayed as viciously deranged, forcing Dewey and Webby to prove themselves worthy of knowledge and attacking them with a sword in the process. She appeared in the episode "[[The Great Dime Chase!]]".

In the episode "[[Friendship Hates Magic!]]", Quackfaster is revealed to be working a second job at the Duckberg library to pay for a retirement condo in Barbados, and is later seen as a tour guide at Fort Duckburg in the episode "[[The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot!]]". Though generally referred to as '''Mrs. Quackfaster''' in this series, her first name as Emily is used.

==Printed media==
===Boom! Studios Comics===
In [[Boom! Studios]]' ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' and ''DuckTales'' comics she is shown to still be happily working as Scrooge's secretary and even help to stop The Phantom Blot and other villains with the other characters when they all "found their inner Donald" and beat back the slime.

==Trivia==
*While featured with an elder like appearance, Quackfaster has a much a younger looking appearance in the Italian comics . In addition, she is also taller than most ducks including Scrooge and his family.
*As shown in the ''Uncle Scrooge'' comic ''The Spirit of Fear'' (first published in [[2004]]), Miss Quackfaster is afraid of spiders.
*In the Italian Disney comic ''Miss Paperett e il malaugurato batticuore'', one of the [[Beagle Boys]] falls in love with Quackfaster.
*In a series of Italian Disney comics, Miss Quackfaster, Grandma Duck, Daisy and Brigitta team up and go on adventures of their own.
*It is possible that Miss Quackfaster's role in the 2017 animated series as a manic librarian rather than a secretary resulted from a mix of Miss Quackfaster with minor Carl Barks character Miss De Wak, a librarian greatly resembling the comics' version of Quackfaster, who appears in a 1959 story.
