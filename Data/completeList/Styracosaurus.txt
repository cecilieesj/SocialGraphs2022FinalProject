It was related to the later [[Triceratops]] and more closely to [[Pachyrhinosaurus]]. It appeared in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[2000]] CGI film, ''[[Dinosaur]]'' and its corresponding ride, [[DINOSAUR]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Dinosaur]]''===
''Styracosaurus'' appear in the herd that appears just after [[Aladar]] is chased by the [[Velociraptor]]s.

=== ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'' ===
[[Forrest Woodbush]] from ''The Good Dinosaur'' is a ''Styracosaurus''. Oddly enough, however, he has the brow horns of a ''Triceratops'' as well as the nasal horn of a ''Styracosaurus''.

== Disney Parks ==
''Styracosaurus'' appears in [[DINOSAUR]] at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] where it is the first dinosaur encountered.  The Syracosaurus also appears as the mascot of the [[Dino Institute]] and appears on its logo.

While the ride was called "Countdown to Extinction", a model of ''Styracosaurus'' was shown on the exterior,   This statue of the styracosaurus would however be relocated in-favour of a statue of Aladar the [[iguanodon]] to tie in with the film.

==Trivia==
*In the original story for Dinosaur conceived and pitched by Phil Tippett and Paul Verhoeven in 1988, the main protagonist would have been a ''Styracosaurus'' named Woot.
*Styracosaurus is Imagineer [[Joe Rohde]]'s favorite dinosaur species and this was the primary reason for its selection as the Dino Institute mascot and fountain statue before Countdown to Extinction's rebranding to Dinosaur.<ref>https://wdwnt.com/2020/04/a-digital-tour-through-disneys-animal-kingdom-with-imagineer-joe-rohde-part-5-dinoland/</ref> 
*Despite being shown alongside Pachyrhinosaurus in Disney's Dinosaur, Styracosaurus lived a few million years earlier than Pachyrhinosaurus and may be its ancestor.  
*A specimen of Styracosaurus discovered in 2015 with seven horns on its frill instead of eight (three on one side and four on the other) suggests that individual Styracosaurus were unique in appearance. This could also indicate that some new ceratopsians, such as the closely related Rubeosaurus, could be Styracosaurus that were born with more or fewer horns on their frills per individual.  
*Styracosaurus is one of the best-known of the ceratopsians and is a member of the Centrosaurinae, a subfamily of ceratopsians defined by large nose horns and bosses as well as short frills.
