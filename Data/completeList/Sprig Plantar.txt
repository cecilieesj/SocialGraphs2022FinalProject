'''Sprig Plantar''' is the deuteragonist of the [[2019]] [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''. A young frog from [[Wartwood Swamp|Wartwood]] with an adventurous and energetic spirit, he befriended the human [[Anne Boonchuy]] after she was teleported to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] by a magic [[Calamity Box|music box]]. Out of genuine love and loyalty, Sprig aided Anne on her quest to return [[Los Angeles|home]], and in doing so, taught her the measure of a true friend. 

The distant descendant of [[Leif]], Sprig is the grandson of [[Hop Pop Plantar]] and the older brother of [[Polly Plantar]]. At a young age, Sprig and Polly’s parents were killed during a heron attack on Wartwood, leaving his family broken and small. He would find solace in his friendship with Anne, and eventually his romance with [[Ivy Sundew]]. As he grew older, Sprig became a seasoned adventurer whom embarked on professional expeditions to explore and chart new regions within Amphibia.

===Personality===
Sprig is a very excitable, energetic, sweet, and adventurous child - qualities that can bring him to adventure and into trouble. Despite acting careless at times, he is utterly loyal to his friends and family, and will ultimately do what is right in the end.

Sprig is an energetic adventurous frog. Although he seems very calm, he is very easily startled.

It is implied in the episodes "[[Cracking Mrs. Croaker]]" and "[[A Caravan Named Desire]]" that Sprig has somewhat of a need for affection, as in both episodes, once he discovers that someone doesn't like him, he fell into desperation and went to great lengths to make that someone like him.

As his everyday clothing, he wears a dark forest green hat with olive green goggles and a jade green jacket paired with dark teal shorts.

In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bL2eMR31Ao Pilot episode] titled ''Amphibialand'', Sprig was initially called Weed. And instead of having a violin as a musical instrument, he had a flute instead. For his appearance, he originally had a blue tongue, wore a yellow neckerchief and a stitched green shirt.

He has a very short green shirt with big-circle shaped short sleeves. The big-circle shaped short sleeves are peach colored with orange seed shapes on it the short sleeves. He has big-circle shaped pants with thick vertical stripes with the pattern of colors green to yellow. It also looks like the outfit is too big for him.

In "[[The Shut-In!]]", Anne creates a human version of Sprig in her imagination named '''Twig'''. He is a human of average height with slightly tan skin and reddish-blonde hair. He wears a dark green beanie with pink and brown pins.

==Appearances==
===''[[Amphibia]]''===
====Pre-Season 1====
Not much is known about Sprig's past expect he and his sister [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] were taken under their grandfather [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]]’s wing after their parents were eaten by Herons and he is childhood friends with [[Ivy Sundew]].

====Season 1====
From the start of the series, Sprig starts off as being considered something of a strange kid in the town of Wartwood. Over the course of the first season however, this begins to change through the influence of [[Anne Boonchuy]] while also changing her perspective as well. Along with the rest of the Plantars, they slowly begin to gain some respect from the town with many people looking at Sprig as the "fun Plantar".

One of the story arcs in season one involves Sprig's personal relationships. In "[[Hop Luck]]", he ends up getting engaged to [[Maddie Flour]], albeit forcibly by Anne in an effort to get dough. Later on in "[[Dating Season]]", Sprig is revealed to be friends with Ivy Sundew, an old acquaintance. At the end of the episode, Sprig suddenly realizes that he is in love with Ivy and makes it his goal, through the encouragement of Anne, to admit his feelings to her. While Maddie makes spare appearances, Sprig still brings her up in a resigned manner. While he likes her, he considers her too weird and creepy. It is not until the episode "[[Cursed!]]" when he finally breaks up with her and learns that despite her weirdness, she simply wants to be friends with him, and he accepts her. In "[[Anne of the Year]]", he and Ivy are finally able to admit their feelings for one another.

Sprig also spends numerous amounts of time learning from his mistakes and maturing somewhat. In "[[Sprig Vs. Hop Pop]]", he learns to be more accepting of rules and in "[[Trip to the Archives]]", he realizes that even though he would rather have fun, he should be more concerned with helping Anne with her problems instead.

====Season 2====
In season 2, Sprig joins his family and Anne in their journey to Newtopia, in hopes of finding a way to transport Anne back into her world. In the episode "[[Handy Anne]]", it is revealed that he has several different slingshots, and briefly goes on a crisis to select which one to take to Newtopia, but eventually manages to settle down in which one to use.

They eventually arrive to Newtopia in "[[Marcy at the Gates]]", where they meet Anne's other human friend, [[Marcy Wu]]. In spite of Marcy being clearly harmless, Sprig is initially suspicious about her, fearing she might be like [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]]. As the group helps Marcy to deal with Barbari-Ants that cause Newtopia to be closed for protection, Sprig constantly watches over Marcy, expecting her to betray them at any minute. However, he soon realizes Marcy is a friend when she saves him from the Barbari-Ant Queen.

In "[[Hopping Mall]]", Sprig helps Anne with finding the perfect gift for her mother, putting them in conflict with Priscilla the Killa over a butterfly teapot, but Anne eventually relents when she learns Priscilla wanted it because it belonged to her own mother. That night, as Anne tells Sprig about her mother, Sprig reveals that his and Polly's mother died when they were young. Therefore he says that he can't remember how she looked or how her voice sounded, briefly causing him to somberly wonder if he can miss her even througth he never knew her, before receiving a hug from Anne and letting his emotions take over him.

====Season 3====
In season 3, Sprig alongside Anne and rest of the Planter family are transported to Earth were they must search for a way home. By the time they returned, Amphibia was in ruins. They joined the resistance led by Sasha to take down Andrias.

==Trivia==
*Early in development, Sprig was originally going to be named Weed.
*[[Thurop Van Orman]] was once considered for Sprig's voice.
*Sprig claims that he has a short attention span. This, combined with his excitable personality, implies that he has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). When asked if this was the case with his character, Matt Braly said it is "very likely" he has ADHD.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/amphibia/comments/ieoe6m/im_matt_braly_creator_and_executive_producer_of/g2jjd56/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 Matt Braly's Reddit AMA]</ref>
