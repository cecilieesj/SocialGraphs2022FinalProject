He is designed to dig or drill holes through planets, making him capable of digging or drilling through many other surfaces.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===
Experiment 529 was the 529th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to dig or drill holes straight through planets. 529 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 529's pod landing atop a little boy's sand castle on a [[Lahui Beach|beach]].

Later, a wave washed over the sand castle, activating the experiment, which proceeded to escape underground.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
529 was captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] at an unknown point and named Digger.

In "[[The Asteroid]]", Digger was one of the six experiments that Stitch convinced to come with him and Lilo to save Earth from an approaching asteroid. Along the journey, Digger was shown digging restlessly into his seat. He later drilled a hole through the asteroid's core for which to insert the [[Jumba's Ship|ship]]'s hyperdrive engine into.

Digger was one of the experiments in "[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]" that presumably joined Stitch in a rebellion against [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]. Earlier in the episode, he, along with [[Yin]] and [[Backhoe]], helped Lilo make mud.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Digger, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Digger participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by sending attacking Leroys into his underground tunnels.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Digger's design was first revealed in a bonus feature trivia game on the original ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' DVD, before he officially debuted in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''.
*After [[Reuben]] and [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]], Digger is tied with [[Slimy]] for the most appearances of experiments that debuted in ''Stitch! The Movie''. Both appeared in two different episodes of ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' as well as ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*In one scene, Digger's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] was red, and in another, it was purple.
*Digger is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*He is also one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''.
