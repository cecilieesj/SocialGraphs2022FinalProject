===''[[Halloweentown (film)|Halloweentown]]''===
On Halloween night, Gwen's mother, Aggie, arrives, encouraging the children in Halloween activities by reading them a book about Halloweentown. When Marnie notices a witch in the book that looks like her, Aggie makes no attempt to quell this thought.

Later that night, Marnie overhears an argument between her mother and grandmother. Marnie learns that both women are witches from Halloweentown, and that Marnie must begin training to use her powers before she loses them. Gwen refuses, favoring their normal human life. Marnie also overhears Gwen refuse to help Aggie when Aggie reports that people in Halloweentown are going missing. Marnie excitedly tells her siblings what she has heard.

When Aggie leaves to return to Halloweentown via a magic bus, Marnie and her two siblings stow away unbeknownst to their grandmother. Becoming lost after exiting the bus, Marnie and her siblings meet the mayor, [[Kalabar]], who summons a taxi to take them to Aggie's house. Aggie is both surprised and happy to see them. Against her better judgment, Aggie chooses not to return the three children home; Aggie promises to begin Marnie's training after she solves Halloweentown's problems, which involves lighting a magic talisman. When Aggie's instant witch's brew fails, Aggie takes the kids into town to gather ingredients for a homemade recipe.

While in town, Gwen arrives in Halloweentown and catches up to them where she plans to bring her children home much to Marnie's objections. Gwen cannot find another bus back to the mortal world upon being told that there is not one coming. When Gwen tries to see if the mayor can do anything, Marnie is shocked that Mayor Kalabar was her old boyfriend. When Kalabar briefly leaves to handle another problem, Gwen and her kids see Aggie walking somewhere with [[Luke (Halloweentown)|Luke]]. Sensing Aggie might be in trouble, they follow Aggie and Luke to an abandoned movie theater.

In the theatre, the family sees Aggie battling a shadow demon, which promptly stuns both Gwen and Aggie. Forced to flee, Marnie and her siblings take up the responsibility of lighting the talisman to reverse the effect. After gathering the ingredients, Marnie and Sophie are able to successfully recite the spell. The three siblings then take it with the intention of installing it in a jack-o'-lantern in town. In town, the three are shocked to realize that the demon is actually Kalabar, who desires to take back the human realm. Utilizing a distraction, Marnie is able to get close to the jack-o-lantern, but is stunned. However, Marnie is able to drop the talisman into place, healing Kalabar's victims.

In a final showdown, Marnie is able to combine her powers her that of her family (including Dylan, whose powers had emerged suddenly out of frustration). Together, the family is able to defeat Kalabar. Reconciling with her mother, Marnie agrees to finish her training with Gwen, which Aggie will live with them in the mortal realm.
