==Background==
===Personality===
Jodie is a very down-to-earth woman who does not put up with any of the nonsense that MODOK or the rest of the Marvel Universe throws at her. Contrary to her villainous husband, she is much more subdued and does not appear to have any evil tendencies whatsoever. She is not afraid to get her hands dirty however and she will be forced to put her foot down. While her decision to divorce MODOK is based on boundaries being broken, it might also be due to her wanting to have a less chaotic life. In "The M.O.D.O.K. That Time Forgot", it is shown that she was once an irresponsible young woman who married MODOK after becoming pregnant with Melissa. It is implied that family life did a significant number on her and made her the smart and reasonable woman she is today. However in "This Man... This Makeover!", Jodie is revealed to be just as conniving and manipulative as M.O.D.O.K. to the point that she begins to reconsider how she approaches success. While she clearly still loves her husband, she wants to reevaluate her place in life. 

===Physical appearance===
Jodie is a woman of average height with short, curly black hair and a brown tan complexion. She is usually seen wearing a purple shirt, a light brown tweed jacket, black mom jeans and brown slip on shoes. Additionally, she wears blue tear drop earrings.

==Trivia==
*Jodie is of Mexican descent.
*Jodie has never had a quinceañera.
*A month before the series premiere, Jodie, along with Melissa and Lou, were introduced in the mainstream Marvel Universe. This version of Jodie is an A.I. program named JOD1E that was meant to activate when MODOK was offline. MODOK continues to have hallucinations of this family when he is awake and discovers their origin. After a fight with his father and his army of Super-Adaptoids, he takes three of them and has them transformed into the family from his hallucinations. Jodie has the ability to morph her arms into guns.
