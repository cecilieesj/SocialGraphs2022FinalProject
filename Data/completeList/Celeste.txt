In her first appearance, she had trouble admitting when she felt something wrong with her body and the toys taught her the importance of listening to her body when something isn't right.
Her second appearance was in season four when she visited the Toy Hospital to make sure everything was fine for her big show that night. At her show her sound effects scared Squibbles so badly he ran around town in fright. After learning about pets and noises, Celeste performed a quiet light show for Squibbles to make up for frightening him.
