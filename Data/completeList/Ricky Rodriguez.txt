==History==
Both [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] and [[Nicki Peterson]] invited Ricky to their parties. Ricky decided to go to Raven's because he hated the Giants, the team Nicki's father played for.
Later, Raven tried to get out of quality time with her mother so she could go see a movie with Eddie and Ricky, but wound up having to go back and forth and in the end, decided to stay with her mother.
