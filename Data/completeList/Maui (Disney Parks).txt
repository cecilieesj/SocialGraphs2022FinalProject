'''Maui''' is one of the Tiki Gods represented in the Enchanted Tiki Garden, the pre-show of [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]], an attraction at [[Disneyland]].

==History==
===Background===
Inspired by the mythical trickster and hero [[Wikipedia:Māui (mythology)|of the same name]], originating in [[Wikipedia:Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian]] and [[Wikipedia:Māori mythology|Maori mythology]]. Like his inspiration, Maui is depicted as having restrained the sun so as to control its movement and give his people time.
==Appearances==
===Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room===
Maui is the first Tiki God to speak in the pre-show of the Enchanted Tiki Room.  He tells guests of his legends and how he roped the sun.

His sign poem reads:
"''Through his special mystic powers''
''He made the sun keep regular hours''
''Maui tells us time to go''
''Time for wonderous tiki show"''
===[[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort]]===
As with other Tiki God statues, Maui can also be found at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort at Walt Disney World.  A separate Tiki depiction of Maui appears as the mascot for Disney's resort, having a large wooden statue in the resort's lobby which depicts him.  He is also present on many of the promotional material works and signs found throughout the resort.

Cards which were once handed out at the resort once described this and explained his significance in Polynesian culture.  Namely his importance to the fictional village who lived in the Polynesian Village Resort.  These cards read:

"''The folklore of Polynesia contains no more colourful characters than those of Maui.  His exploits are told and retold across the island world, from [[Hawaii]] to Bora Bora to [[New Zealand]].''

''Maui, born of the gods, lived among the people of the South Seas. His Pranks and tricks provided the Islanders with a constant source of new tales… How Maui, with his magic fish hook, pulled the islands of Polynesia from the depths of the sea…And happiest of tale of all, how Maui achieved his greatest feat – capturing the Sun with a specially woven net, refusing to release it until he secured a promise that the Sun would pursue his course across the sky more slowly.  This, of course, means more daylight for all…for all who live in Polynesia.''

''So now you know why the people of every Polynesian Village remember the mischievous one – the playful god of the people, Maui''".

=== [[Trader Sam's]] ===
In both the Trader Sam's locations of Disney's Polynesian Resort and Disneyland Hotel, the HippopotoMai-Tai tiki-mug is modelled after Maui.  In the Grog Grotto location, paraphernalia of Maui's likeness can be found within the bar.

===[[Tahitian Terrace|The Tahitian Terrace]]===
Maui's statue from the Tiki Room can be found in the Tahitian Terrace restaurant at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

=== [[Main Street, U.S.A. (Disneyland)|Main Street, U.S.A.]] ===
Disneyland's Main Street has an illustration of the Tiki Room's Maui alongside some artwork for ''[[It's a Small World]]'' and the [[Grandfather Coffin Clock]] from the ''[[Museum of the Weird]]'' featured in one of the windows above the silhouette studio.  This window serves as a tribute to imagineer [[Rolly Crump]] who designed all of the afformentioned illustrations.

==Other Appearances==

=== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ===
In the book ''[[Tales from Adventureland: The Keymaster's Quest]]'', the Tiki Gods found outside of the Enchanted Tiki Room were constructed by the Jungle Explorer Society to frighten away poachers who might wish harm upon the Tiki Room birds.

===[[Disney Kingdoms]]===
Maui's tiki idol from the Enchanted Tiki Room makes fairly minor appearances in [[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]] comics.
