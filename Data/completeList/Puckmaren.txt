}}The '''Puckmaren''' is a little alien character who befriends [[David Freeman]] in ''[[Flight of the Navigator]]''. He is from the planet Binpuka Minor, which was destroyed by a comet, and the last surviving member of his kind.

==Role in the film==
[[Max (Flight of the Navigator)|Max]] had collected the Puckmaren as one of his samples prior to Binpuka Minor's destruction, but naturally could not return him there afterward.

The Puckmaren did not know his world was gone, and was angry that Max would not take him home; while Max could not bring himself to tell him he now had no home to return to.

At the end of the film, the Puckmaren is discovered to have stowed away in David's backpack after he arrives back in [[1978]].
