He is a Canadian biologist without any survival skills, yet brave enough to study wolves in their environment.

== Role in the film ==
Tyler is sent to the desolate Canadian tundra to find out whether the local wolf population is responsible for decimating Canada's caribou herds. Helped by Ootek, a local Inuit native, Farley Mowat manages to establish an observation post and, while braving the harsh climate, begins to study a family of wolves, as well as the caribou. He eventually determines that the greatest danger to the caribou doesn't move on four legs.
