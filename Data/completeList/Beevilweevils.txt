'''Beevilweevils''' are large insects, featured in the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[Day of the Beevilweevils]]".

==Background==
When [[Tummi Gummi]] builds a honey bee caller in an attempt to attract more of the insects to pollinate more Gummiberry bushes, he ignores very specific instructions given in the [[Great Book of Gummi]]. Despite [[Zummi Gummi]]'s warning that Tummi acted carelessly in constructing the device, using the wrong wood, drilling too few holes, on the wrong side, and using a rope that is too long, he goes on using it anyway.

Zummi's warning holds true, and instead of honey bees, Tummi attracts the voracious Beevilweevils. Nothing that the [[Gummi Bears|Gummies]] attempt to stop the greedy bugs is successful, and all that ends up being left of the Gummiberry bushes are bare branches (and unbeknownst to them, some still-fertile roots).

The bears eventually travel to the deserted Gummi colony of [[South Gumton]] in order to find a sapling to replace the bushes.
