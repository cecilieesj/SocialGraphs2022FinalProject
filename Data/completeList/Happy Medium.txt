===[[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|''A Wrinkle in Time'' (2003)]]===
As [[Meg Murry|Meg]], [[Charles Wallace Murry|Charles Wallace]], and [[Calvin O'Keefe|Calvin]] are summoned to seek the Happy Medium on their journey, the three travel very far in the cave with assistance from [[Mrs. Whatsit]]. There, the three encounter the Happy Medium who greets the visitors inside. Mrs. Which asks H.M. to show her allies something that no one else can about one creature who can face off the forces of darkness before it destroys the Earth to which he agrees. H.M.'s crystal ball shows a flashback of Meg's mother with his relationship with her daughter on the swings at the playground just as Mrs. Which tells him to show her friends the darkness.

Upon showing the group the darkness, it is then shown that the darkness was defeated for a while, but it came back to again, much to the worries of Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Which just as the Happy Medium notices their sadness of what happened while Mrs. Whatsit explains that sometimes, children can triumph over the darkness' evil forces with faith and hope. However, before going to Camazotz, Meg asks H.M. to show her mother to her, to which Calvin interrupts and tells him to show his mother to which the Happy Medium tunes in to the O'Keefe family's house, where it shows a tragic flashback of Calvin's mother scolding him, followed by H.M. tuning in the Murry family's home, showing a flashback of Meg's mother who mourns the disappearance of her husband, causing Meg and the rest of the children to find Mr. Murry at the planet Camazotz, much to the sadness of H.M. who felt exhausted upon hearing this just before the children and the three Mrs. Ws leave the cave.

As Meg, Charles, and Calvin are at Camazotz entering It's headquarters, the Happy Medium tunes in Camazotz so that [[Mrs. Who]], Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Whatsit know where the three are at. Later when Charles is dealing with the Man with Red Eyes, H.M. fearfully reacts to what he did with Calvin, alongside Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Whatsit. He is not seen again throughout the remainder of the film.
