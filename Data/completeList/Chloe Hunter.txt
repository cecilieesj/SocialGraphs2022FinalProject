|quote = }}'''Chloe Hunter''' is the former manager of Sassy's (written on a checkout desk as "SASEEZ"). She is a one time character and the antagonist of "[[True Colors (That's So Raven)|True Colors]]", an episode in the third season of Disney's ''[[That's So Raven]]''.

==Background==
When both [[Raven Baxter]] and [[Chelsea Grayson|Chelsea Daniels]] apply for jobs at Sassy's, the popular mall clothing store, Chloe acts exceptionally perky and has the two girls perform tasks to assess their abilities. However, despite Raven's top notch skills and Chelsea's incompetence, Raven was rejected while Chelsea was accepted. As the girls and [[Eddie Thomas|Eddie]] wonder how Raven wasn't hired after doing so well, Raven has a vision that shows Chloe pointedly saying she doesn't hire black people, showing her true nature and persona as a bigot. After telling her friends about her vision, Eddie reveals how he notices that Sassy's is lacking in ''any'' employees of color.

After talking to her parents about what happened, Raven and her friends enlists the help of anchorwoman Yolanda Johnson to expose Chloe's bigoted policy and true colors. The plan begins with Chelsea going into work with a hat containing a camera, as well as Raven entering the store disguised as an older man. When Chloe notices her, she shows her prejudiced beliefs by instructing Chelsea to keep a closer eye on "Him", though is able to do so without explicitly revealing her motivation. When Chloe roughly interacts with the disguised Raven, she claims she's the higher up for the store who has come to check on the establishment's quality. When she points out how the store doesn't have decorations for Black History Month, Chloe claims that she enthusiastically celebrated the month. When asked if she has any employees of color, Chloe again lies and says she did, using Raven's job application as "Proof".

The gang further tests Chloe by having Eddie go in and apply for the job in Raven's presence. Not wanting to be revealed in front of who she believes to be her boss, Chloe allowed him to submit his application. But once in private with Chelsea, the bigoted manager reveals that she planned to throw out Eddie's application once her "Boss" left. When questioned by Chelsea why, Chloe explicitly reveals that she doesn't hire black people, proving that Raven's vision is true. With Chloe's confession exposed on tape, Yolanda airs the story on the news, exposing the blatant case of discrimination. As a result of the investigation, Chloe is fired from Sassy's and the company releases a public apology.

==Trivia==
*Chloe Hunter is similar to Miss Hendra from ''[[Smart Guy]]''; both are the managers of clothing stores who are revealed to have bigoted policies regarding their store, which are ultimately exposed by the protagonists.
