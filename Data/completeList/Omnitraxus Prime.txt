==Background==
===Personality and Traits===
Omnitraxus Prime is arrogant, somewhat goofy, and callous. He bears an intense hatred of monsters and their supporters and will go to any lengths to ensure their subjugation, though he does feel a little remorse for the way they were treated.  He is willing to assist people with space-time-related problems if he feels the matter is worth his attention.

===Physical Appearance===
Omnitraxus Prime is a giant humanoid-like being with a skull-shaped face, a body made up of space. As the largest member of the Magic High Commission, his great size likely prevents him from entering normal public places, so he usually appears alongside his allies via a crystal ball.

===Powers and abilities===
* '''Space-time manipulation''': As the master of space-time, Omnitraxus can bend time and space to his will. Space-time-related problems, such as time loops, are his specialty, and in his body lies the Crystal Fields of Interwoven Continuum, from which all of a person's individual timelines can be perceived.
* '''Size manipulation''': Omnitraxus can expand and shrink his body. His body is typically the size of a galaxy, but he can shrink enough to interact with others on a more personal level, like Star.
* '''Intangibility''': Omnitraxus can turn his body intangible, and is able to pass through floors and other solid objects.
* '''Shapeshifting''': Omnitraxus is able to transform and reshape the form of his body, as demonstrated in "[[Starcrushed]]" when he shapeshifts his body into a giant fist.

==Trivia==
*Omnitraxus's name is similar to that of [https://warner-bros-characters.fandom.com/wiki/Optimus_Prime Optimus Prime], the leader of the Autobots in the ''Transformers'' franchise. [[Peter Cullen]] has voiced the character since 1984, although he has also been voiced by [[David Kaye]].
*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Omnitraxus was created by [[Glossaryck]] to maintain the multiverse for Mewmans and explain to them the delicate strands of space-time.
*Despite the fact that he hates monsters he seemed to felt a little remorse for the way they were treated and tried to convince Festivia to treat them good unfortunately she listened more to Hekapoo.
