'''Pearl''' is a pink flapjack octopus in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2003]] animated film, ''[[Finding Nemo]] ''and its [[2016]] [[Finding Dory|sequel]]. She says she has one shorter tentacle than the rest, though this is barely noticeable.

==Background==
Pearl is pink like her father Ted, but unlike him, her face is positioned in the middle. She also claims to be able to walk on land. Whenever she gets nervous or scared, she squirts her squid ink, or "inks" as she calls it. This trait was presumably inherited from her father, who has a similar release of ink when he encounters [[Bruce]] and his [[Anchor|fellow]] [[Chum|sharks]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Finding Nemo]]''===
One of [[Mr. Ray]]'s students, [[Nemo]] meets Pearl and her friends, [[Tad]] and [[Sheldon]], while waiting to start school. She was part of the group who saw the boat. Like the other children, she tries to see how close to it she can swim. When Marlin accuses Nemo of swimming passed the drop off, she and the other kids try to defend Nemo. When the [[Philip Sherman|divers]] appear, she flees with the rest of the class, being protected by Mr. Ray as they escape from the divers. She is the only one to scream at the situation.

She briefly appears at the end of the film, welcoming Nemo and newcomer [[Squirt (Finding Nemo)|Squirt]] into the class as she, Nemo, and the other students prepare for a new adventure for exploring.

===''[[Finding Dory]]''===
Pearl returns in the sequel, albeit only making two appearances throughout the film. She first appears in the scene where Mr. Ray is telling his class about the stingray migration and during the spot where the stingray migration occurs in which Mr. Ray warns the class to stay away from the undertow to avoid getting caught in the current and later looking at Dory who was knocked unconsciously by the large group of stingrays. Pearl last appears at the end of the film, where she, Tad, Sheldon, and the rest of the students discover that Mr. Ray joined the stingray migration in which Hank, Bailey, and Destiny substitute for Mr. Ray's class.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Pearl is seen in ''[[The Seas with Nemo & Friends]]'' at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]] as part of the group who is searching for Nemo and worry about him. She also appears on the coral reef sculpture outside of the Pavilion.

She also appears in ''[[Finding Nemo - The Musical|Finding Nemo: The Musical]]'' at the [[Animal Kingdom]] playing the same role as in the movie.

==Trivia==
*Pearl is named after a type of bright object found inside oysters and clams. Coincidentally, oysters, clams, and octopuses are all mollusks just like Pearl who is an octopus.
*Flapjack Octopuses live at great depths in the ocean not in coral reefs.
