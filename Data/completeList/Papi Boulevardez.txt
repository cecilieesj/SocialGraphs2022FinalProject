'''Papi Boulevardez''' is a character from ''[[The Proud Family]]''.

==History==
He is [[Felix Boulevardez]]'s father, [[LaCienega Boulevardez]]'s paternal grandfather, and [[Suga Mama]]'s love interest. He wears purple clothes and has styled green hair (however, when Suga Mama rescues him from slavery at an Okra Plantation and gives him black hair dye, he implies his hair color was originally black) just like the Joker from the ''Batman'' series, and he laughs manically like him after saying something rude in Spanish about Suga Mama. However, in episode "[[Suga Mama's Believers]]", Papi finally spoke English for the first time. It would seem that he actually can speak English (and understands it fluently), but prefers his native language. A genetic trait passed down in his family is that they all have large feet (except maybe not his daughter-in-law) that enable them to swim better than most people. Whether or not the characters can understand him varies depending on the episode.

==Trivia==
*Papi presumably has other sons, Sunset mentioned that Felix's brothers had not seen him.
*Papi's look and laugh are based on Cesar Romero and strongly resembles one of his characters, [[w:c:dc:Joker|The Joker]] from the Adam West ''Batman'' show. In fact, in his first appearance, Suga Mama initially mistakes him for Romero.
** Papi's laugh in ''Louder and Prouder'' was provided by Kevin Michael Richardson, who actually voiced the Joker in 2004's ''The Batman''.
