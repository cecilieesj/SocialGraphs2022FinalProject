'''Lord Nicholas Devereaux''' is the reformed secondary antagonist of ''[[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement]]'', he's the nephew of [[Viscount Mabrey]] and the love interest of [[Mia Thermopolis]].

==Biography==
Nicholas Devereaux first appears in Princess Mia's 21th birthday party, where he dances with her and they feel a connection.

However, it was later revealed that Nicholas was another heir to the Genovian throne and thus Mia's rival and that he will become king unless she gets married as stated in Genovian law, when she discovers this, she angrily stomps on his foot.

When Mia gets engaged to [[Andrew Jacoby]], Mabrey instructs Nicholas to seduce Mia to break off her engagement and that he could be crowned king, when Nicholas expresses doubt about this, his uncle manipulates him by saying that his deceased father's last wish was to see Nicholas becoming king.

Nicholas begins flirting with Mia, first by leading her into a closet and later dating another girl named Lady Elisa to make her jealous, which slightly worked, and Nicholas got Mia to admit that she didn't love Andrew and kissed her and pushed her into a fountain, much to her dismay.

After Mabrey humiliates Mia in front of the public, a worried Nicholas went to comfort her but she angrily told him to leave her alone.

One day, [[Queen Clarisse Renaldi|Queen Clarisse]] asked Nicholas why he didn't want Mia to become queen, and he replied that he thought that she didn't know the people of Genovia very well, unlike him who was born there. However he was proved wrong when he witnessed Mia comforting an orphan girl and inviting her and other children to join her in a parade, impressing him with her kindness.

Nicholas started to have second thoughts about inheriting the throne and asked his uncle to stop sabotaging her, which he seemingly agrees and tells him to seek Mia and tell her that the crown is hers.

Nicholas later found Mia to tell her that he's leaving and asks to her to see him one last time in a lake, where they share secrets, dance and fell asleep, the next morning they see a man videotaping them (secretly sent by Mabrey), and Mia angrily thinks that he set her a trap and leaves Nicholas despite his objections.

At the royal wedding day, Nicholas discovers that his uncle set him up and runs in an antique bicycle to tell Mia, and arrives to tell everyone that he declines the crown and that he believes that Mia would make a great ruler. Mabrey angrily confronts him and Nicholas disowns him.

He's later seen declaring his love for Mia and happily watching her being crowned queen of Genovia.
