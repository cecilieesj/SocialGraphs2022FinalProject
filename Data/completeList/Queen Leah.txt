==Background==

===Personality===
Although her personality isn’t fully developed, Queen Leah is shown to be a caring individual and a loving mother to her daughter, [[Aurora]] and her family, kingdom and all of the palace servants.

===Physical appearance===
Queen Leah is a slender woman with fair skin, pink lips, dark blonde hair, and brown eyes. She wears a dark pink-and-lavender dress, a gold crown, a aqua veil, and a dark magenta cape.

==Appearances==
===''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''===
Queen Leah and her [[King Stefan|husband]] are the monarchs of an unnamed [[Europe|European]] kingdom. After many years of marriage, she gives birth to a beautiful baby daughter which she and her husband name [[Aurora]], after the [[wikipedia:Aurora (mythology)|goddess of dawn]]. Her happiness is shortened when [[Maleficent]], who was not invited, curses her daughter. Devastated, she has to see her daughter taken away by [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|the fairies]] in order to protect her. Sixteen years later she is waiting for the return of her daughter. But when Aurora touches the spindle, the Queen, her husband, [[King Hubert]], and the entire kingdom are put to sleep by [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|the Good Fairies]]. When Maleficent is defeated, she awakens and is finally reunited with her daughter, whom she embraces and cries tears of happiness when she sees her with [[Prince Phillip]].

===''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''===
In the short segment, Queen Leah, King Stefan, King Hubert, and Prince Phillip all leave town to a royal ceremony where Hubert is due to give a speech. Trusting their daughter, Stefan and Leah give Aurora the "keys to the kingdom" while they're away, leaving Aurora as temporary ruler of the kingdom and aided by their fussbudget majordomo, [[The Duke|Lord Duke]]. When they come back to town from a royal ceremony, Duke warns them about the magic incident. So when they enter the throne room, no green pigs, giant chickens, and cows are shown, as a result of Aurora solving her problem. Leah is seen at the end of the segment when she attends a royal banquet that is hosted by Aurora, along with Duke, Stefan, Hubert, Phillip, Merryweather, Flora and Fauna.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
In the [[ABC]] fantasy drama series ''Once Upon a Time'', she's called Briar Rose (as a reference to ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''). The original Sleeping Beauty, she had incurred [[Maleficent]]'s wrath, and was cursed by her into an eternal sleep before [[King Stefan]] awakens her with true love's kiss. While Maleficent falls into ruin, destroyed by her failed revenge, King Stefan and Briar Rose marry and have a daughter named [[Aurora]]. Years later, when their daughter is set to wed [[Prince Phillip]], King Stefan seeks to get rid of Maleficent permanently to keep Aurora safe from her. Instead, Maleficent regains her lost ability to morph into a [[Maleficent|dragon]] and gains the upper-hand over the king, but the latter managed to survive. Later, Maleficent gains retribution against Briar Rose by cursing Aurora into an eternal sleep.

===''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]''===
Queen Leah appeared in the film under the name of '''Leila''' and was portrayed by [[Hannah New]]. She is the daughter of the ruthless [[King Henry]]. She remains loyal to her father who performs her duties as a princess by becoming Stefan's wife and later bearing his child. She would soon witness Maleficent, her husband's former friend whom he betrayed would place a curse on her daughter Aurora.

During the course of the film, she becomes gravely ill and eventually dies. Stefan shows no grief over her death as he has become paranoid and obsessed with hunting Maleficent down.

===''[[Descendants]]''===
Queen Leah appeared in the Disney Channel Original Movie played by Judith Maxie. By that time she is a grandmother to [[Audrey (Descendants)|Audrey]]. She is shown to be apathetic toward the villains, but especially [[Mal]] in particular, because her [[Maleficent|mother]] caused Leah to miss out on her own [[Aurora|daughter]]'s entire childhood. After the incident at the coronation, she appears to have accepted Mal and the others; she observes as Audrey thanks Mal for stopping her mom.

===''[[Descendants 3]]''===
Queen Leah attends an announcement made by [[Ben]], and watches him ask Mal to be his queen. She chides [[Audrey (Descendants)|Audrey]] for not being able to win Ben over, stating that Aurora managed to hold onto a prince in her sleep. After Audrey is defeated by [[Mal]], Leah watches [[Hades]] awaken her from a deep sleep, and apologizes to Mal. She later claps as Mal declares that the Isle's barrier will be taken down.

==Trivia==
*In the French version, she is called '''Reine Orhiane''' or '''Reine Oriane''', although some media called her '''Reine Béatrice'''.
*Aurora looks pretty much identical to Leah, with the only real differences being that Aurora has longer and lighter-colored hair and a slightly rounder face compared to Leah.
*Queen Leah is the first mother of a Disney Princess to be alive in the film, though she and King Stefan both die in ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]''. The second is [[Fa Li]] ([[Fa Mulan|Mulan]]'s mother), the third is [[Eudora]] ([[Tiana]]'s), the fourth is [[Queen Arianna]] ([[Rapunzel]]'s) the fifth is [[Queen Elinor|Elinor]] ([[Merida]]'s) and the sixth is [[Sina]] ([[Moana (character)|Moana]]'s).
*Though King Stefan and Queen Leah do not appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', the thrones on which they sit are present in the hall of the castle, where [[Terra]] faces the Wheel Master Unversed.
