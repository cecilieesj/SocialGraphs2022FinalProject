'''Lenny''' is a race car from Queens, New York that came to Radiator Springs to race against Lightning McQueen. Little is known about his personality, as his dialogue consists solely of phrases like "good!" and "not good!", spoken in a rough, low-pitch voice.

Lenny is a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. He is coated with light blue livery, and a white stripe going down the middle of his model. Lenny also sports the number "[[Route 66|66]]" on his doors, and in the PlayStation 3 version of ''[[Cars: Mater-National Championship]]'', he has two black lines on his rear, though these are not depicted in any other versions of the game.
