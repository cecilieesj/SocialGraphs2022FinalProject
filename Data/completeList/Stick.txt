He is the one who taught martial arts to [[Daredevil|Matt Murdock]] and [[Elektra Natchios]], acting as a father figure to both of them. His fierce training regime and his gruff, antisocial personality is partly responsible for Matt and Elektra's ruthless and aggressive personalities. Born blind, he is a master at several different kinds of martial arts and, as his name indicates, an expert at using a staff as his weapon. This usage of a staff as his trademark weapon is what inspired Matt's usage of a billy club as a weapon in his identity of Daredevil.

Stick was created by Frank Miller.
