==History==

He is [[Dave Barbarian|Dave]], [[Fang Barbarian|Fang]] and [[Candy Barbarian|Candy]]'s uncle, on [[Glimia]]'s side of the family, though this is based solely on appearance. A rather clumsy sorcerer who usually wreaks havoc with his spells rather than being useful. It was revealed in the episode "[[Sorcerer Material]]" that he never really went to sorcerer school, he just worked in the cafeteria.

Uncle Oswidge loves to eat and presents a rather unkempt appearance. Like his younger niece Fang, he secretly likes to play with dolls. His favorite foods are ham and "Nut Logs" - he cannot resist them. His knowledge of magic and magical items, and most other things, surpasses the rest of the family.

== Trivia ==
*His name is a pun on Oz, as in "Wizard of Oz", considering he's a wizard, but he doesn't know real magic.
*Some kids mistakenly believed Oswidge should have been ruling [[Udrogoth]] instead of [[Candy Barbarian|Candy]]; mistaking him for the King's brother. 
*One of his spells was "hydrogen peroxide", which is actually a disinfectant.
