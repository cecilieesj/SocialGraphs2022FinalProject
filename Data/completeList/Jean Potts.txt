|fullname=Jean Potts|status=Active}}'''Jean Potts''' is the village potter and husband of [[Mrs. Potts]] and the father of [[Chip Potts]] in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|live-action adaption]] movie of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.

==Role in the film ==
Because of the [[Enchantress]]'Â curse on the [[Beast's Castle]], Jean's memories of the Prince and his servants, along with the memories of the rest of [[Villagers (Beauty and the Beast)|the villagers]], were erased, making him forget his wife and son. He lives alone in the [[Village (Beauty and the Beast)|village]] working as a potter.

Jean is first seen in the village asking [[Belle]] about where she's headed, and responds that the book she has read sounds boring after she tells him what it's about. Before that question, it appeared that Jean is one of the few people who is friendly towards Belle and doesn't talk about her behind her back like the other villagers. Belle as well seems to enjoy him, even asking in concern if he had lost something again and laughed in amusement of his inability to remember what he had lost, though not in a malicious way.

Jean is then later seen in the [[Tavern (Beauty and the Beast)|tavern]] when [[LeFou]] is trying to cheer up [[Gaston]] after Belle rejected his proposal. He witnesses [[Maurice]]'s claims about the [[Beast]], and like the rest of the town, believes him to be crazy. However, Belle returns and proves her father's sanity by revealing the Beast's existence with a magic mirror, which made all the villagers (including Jean) realize that Maurice was telling the truth.

However, Gaston tricks Jean and the villagers into participate in the attack on Beast's castle by lying that the Beast is a threat. Jean obviously fell for it and during the battle, he strangely recognizes Mrs. Potts. Once the curse is lifted following Gaston's death, Jean's memory is restored and he is reunited with his wife and son, finally realizing the true events. He is last seen happily dancing with his wife during a grand ball hosted by Belle and the Beast (who has turned back into the Prince).

==Trivia==
*His appearance during the song "[[Belle (song)|Belle]]" replaces Belle's conversation with the baker in the original film, despite the baker making an appearance right before Mr. Potts is first seen.
*Like [[Sir Francis Tremaine]], in Disney's [[Cinderella (2015 film)|live-action adaptation]] of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', he is revealed to be the previously unknown spouse of a main character. However, he is still alive during the events of his film while Sir Francis dies in ''Cinderella''.
*The film novelization indicates that it is his mule that Belle uses to help with her laundry.
