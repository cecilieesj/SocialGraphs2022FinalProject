Bertrand Crawley began posing as a living statue in [[London]], and was discovered by [[Moon Knight|Steven Grant]], who would regularly confide in him, telling him about things such as a woman at work named Dylan. One day, Grant told Crawley about the unusual amount of energy he sometimes has, and how he had a date. A couple approached and asked Grant to take a picture with Crawley, and Grant obliged, reminding them to leave a tip. Grant resumed talking and resolved to figure out a way to hide his need for an ankle restraint. Grant thanked Crawley for listening, tipped him, and returned home. A few days later, Grant returned during the daytime to see Crawley. He told him about uncovering the truth behind what was happening to him regarding [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]] and that he would continue searching for proof that he wasnâ€™t going crazy. Grant then hugged Crawley, much to his surprise, and thanked for him for listening.

A recreation of the real Bertrand Crawley, manifested in Duat, and a patient at the Putnam Psychiatric Hospital. There he hosted a bingo game with the fellow patients of Putnam Psychiatric Hospital. [[Scarlet Scarab|Layla El-Faouly]] took Marc Spector's bingo sheet and told Crawley that they won, promising Spector that she will share the prize with him.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Bertrand Crawley is a homeless man in [[New York City]], often working as an informant for [[Moon Knight]]. Crawley has a natural flair for the dramatic, and behaves as if he were a member of British aristocracy, rather than a man living on the streets of New York.
