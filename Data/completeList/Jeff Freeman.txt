==Background==
Jeff is a cheeky boy who enjoys tormenting David, causing a few heated arguments in which Bill and Helen are always caught in the middle of.

==Role in the film==
At the age of 8, Jeff is the average cheeky annoying boy who enjoys teasing David. But after his mysterious disappearance for 8 years, Jeff shows how much he really cared aboutÂ him by helping in Bill and Helen's search for him, feeling bad that the last time they met is when he scared him by jumping out of a tree when he goes to pick him up.

When Jeff meets David again, he is just as surprised to see him as he is by him and helps him understand where he is and what has changed. He goes to great lengths to help him out including lighting a fireworks display so he can find his way home.

When David returns to [[1978]], Jeff is amazed when he forgives him for his teasing and eventually warms up to him.
