'''Artemis Fowl I''' is the widowed father of [[Artemis Fowl II]], the main protagonist of the [[2020]] film ''[[Artemis Fowl]]''. After disappearing mysteriously, he is branded as a major thief by the media, responsible for the disappearance of some of the world's most important artifacts. In fact, he is secretly an ally of the fairy-folk, helping to protect their treasures, and working together with Beechwood Short.

==Appearance==
In the film, Artemis was not home much at Fowl Manor, traveling a lot for his work. His son enjoyed the postcards he sent and kept them for his fairy collection, even though he did not know them to actually be real. One day, he disappeared while aboard his ship, the ''Fowl Star''. As the news was reported that he had been named a person of interest in a number of high-profile thefts, Artemis received a call from a mysterious stranger who told him "I have your father. If you want to see him alive again, get me one ton of fairy gold''.''" He hatched a plan to kidnap a fairy in order to the gold as a ransom, the fairy in question turning out to be [[Holly Short]]. However, the plan took a turn when Holly Short discovered that her father, who had also disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and Artemis' father, were allies.
