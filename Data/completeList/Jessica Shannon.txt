==Biography==
Jessica's parents buy her an invitation to see the first showing of Stark Enterprises' DISKs, small devices to imprison villains in a codified form. After [[Loki Laufeyson]] captures [[Avengers|the Avengers]] and other heroes in DISKs, Jessica and other four kids are affected by a defective bio-code that allows them to briefly summon the heroes from the DISKs via a D-Smash. Jessica's bio-code allows her to D-Smash Animal heroes like Wasp.
