[[File:Dallas (Austin & Ally).png|thumb|250px]]'''Dallas''' was [[Ally Dawson]]'s crush who used to work at the Cell Phone Accessory Cart, at the same mall that Sonic Boom is located. He is a recurring character on the show. Ally lists reasons as to why she likes him, namely his hair and great smile. After taking something that Ally said seriously, Dallas quit his job at the Cell Phone Accessory Cart, choosing to work at Sonic Boom. Now, as of the ending of World Records & Work Wreckers where Dallas got fired from Sonic Boom, he now works in the library, but he pronounces it as Libary. He was portrayed by [[Noah Centineo]].

==Personality==
Dallas is a really nice and a kind guy. He says sorry when he couldn't dance with Ally, meaning he cares about peoples' feeling. He has a crush on Ally shown in Club Owners & Quincea単eras and World Records & Work Wreckers. Sometimes, he gets nervous around Ally. He is a bit clumsy, and also a bit ditzy.

==Relationships==
'''Ally Dawson''' (Friends - Crush)
He appears to find Ally strange throughout Secrets & Songbooks, but during Austin's performance of Not a Love Song, the two share a smile. In Club Owners & Quincea単eras, Ally wants to share a dance with him but he can't dance so he rejects her. He later confesses to Ally that he can't dance and she says she doesn't know how to dance either. At the end the two awkwardly dance together. He also has a crush on her, as seen in World Records & Work Wreckers. In that episode, Ally accidentally said that if he thought his job at the Cell Phone Accessory Cart stunk, he should work at Sonic Boom. The next day, Dallas had started working at Sonic Boom. Ally tries to hide this from her dad, but she fails when Dez talks about Dallas's terrible work ethic. When Ally goes to fire Dallas, following orders from her dad, he tells her he loves the job because he gets to see her every day. At the end, Dallas gets hired to work at the library because his mom is a librarian, and she has been trying to get him to work there.

===Trish===
They don't interact too much in the show, but when Trish asks Dallas to go to her Quincea単era, he gladly accepts. (see in Club Owners & Quincea単eras).
