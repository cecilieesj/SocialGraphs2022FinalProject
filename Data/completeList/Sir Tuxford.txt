'''Sir Tuxford''' is the highest ranking knight in [[King Gregor]]'s court and his trusted friend.

He is an older, jolly character, always ready for a fight but perhaps past his prime. Sir Tuxford leads the knights of [[Dunwyn Castle|Castle Dunwyn]] and is the main force that keeps [[Duke Igthorn]] and his [[Ogres]] away.

His catchphrase is often "I'm sure I don't know, Sire." when questioned by King Gregor about the present situation. Despite his age and his appearance, Sir Tuxford has apprehended many troublemakers in Dunwyn, and done battle with Igthorn and his Ogres.
