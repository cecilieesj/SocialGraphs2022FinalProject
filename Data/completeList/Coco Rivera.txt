'''Socorro Rivera''',<ref name="Secrets" /> better known as '''Mamá Coco''', is the titular character of the [[2017]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]''. She is a warm-hearted, supportive, and kind woman who is [[Miguel Rivera|Miguel]]'s great-grandmother. She suffers from a degenerating memory, but doesn't let that interfere with her happiness.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Mamá Coco is Miguel's cherished great-grandmother. She is very old and fragile, but that doesn't stop Miguel from sharing his daily adventures with her.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet the Characters and Voice Cast of Disney Pixar's Coco and See the Beautiful New Poster|author=Lema, Michelle|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2017/06/06/meet-the-characters-and-voice-cast-of-disney-pixars-coco-and-see-the-beautiful-new-poster/|date=June 6, 2017|website=Oh My Disney|publisher=Disney|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref>

==Role in the film==
Mamá Coco is introduced as the daughter of [[Imelda]] and an unnamed musician who left Imelda with Coco when she was three, after the latter decided to pursue a career in music and never returned. Because of this, Imelda enforced a ban on music in her family and raised Coco herself in a family business of shoemaking. In the present, Coco is the beloved great-grandmother of Miguel and is the only member who listens to his hopes and dreams. Despite the outcast status of her father among the Riveras, Coco still remembers her father and thinks of him fondly. Like Miguel, she doesn't approve of her mother's ban on music but is not vocal about it. However, her declining health and memory is a growing concern for her daughter [[Abuelita (Coco)|Elena]], who becomes more worried and protective of her mother even when the old woman fails to recognize her.

On ''Día de Los Muertos'', Coco is overseeing her family's ''ofrenda'', on top of which is the portrait of Coco with her parents, including Coco's disgraced father. After [[Dante]] accidentally shakes the ''ofrenda'' and causes the portrait to shatter, Miguel spots the man in the portrait holding a guitar identical to the [[Héctor's Guitar|guitar]] of [[Ernesto de la Cruz]]. Seeing the portrait causes Mamá Coco to react and confirm the figure is her father. Miguel, believing Coco meant that de la Cruz is her father, takes this as a sign to fulfill his dream of becoming a musician. Unfortunately, this leads to an argument between Miguel and the rest of the family, and Abuelita smashes his guitar, which in turn leads Miguel to try to steal Ernesto's guitar so he can play in the plaza like Ernesto. Because of his hasty act, Miguel becomes cursed and transformed into a spirit.

While in the [[Land of the Dead]], Miguel learns that Coco's missing father is actually [[Héctor]] and tried to come home to her and Imelda all those years ago, but Ernesto, who was his selfish music partner and with whom he was on tour in Mexico, murdered him and stole his songs to achieve fame. Meanwhile back in the Land of the Living, Coco's memory, including of Héctor, is fading, and so will Héctor if Coco completely forgets him and passes away as she's the last person among the living who remembers him. Miguel, Héctor, Imelda, and the deceased Riveras plan to send Héctor's photo back with Miguel so that Coco can remember him and pass down his memory to the living Riveras. Unfortunately, the photo is lost in the struggle with Ernesto and Miguel, in danger of being trapped in the Land of the Dead permanently if he stays any longer, is sent home empty-handed. Miguel rushes back to the Rivera residence with Héctor's stolen guitar and, despite Abuelita's objections, bursts into Coco's room to see that Coco has become catatonic. Miguel tries to get Coco to remember by showing her the old photo and her father's guitar but to no avail. When the rest of the family enters, Abuelita (not realizing that he's trying to help her come to her senses) orders Miguel to apologize to Coco, but as he does so, his foot nudges Héctor's guitar.

Remembering how Héctor told him of the song he wrote especially for his daughter, Miguel tearfully picks up Héctor's guitar and plays "[[Remember Me (song)|Remember Me]]" to Coco, telling her it is from her father. The song brings Coco back to her senses, and she recognizes her great-grandson and daughter, who tears up at the sight of her mother regaining her senses by listening and singing to the song. Revitalized by her father's music, Coco is motivated to reveal her father's identity, along with the letters he sent to her as a child before his murder and the torn section of their family portrait that has his face. All this evidence respectively grants Héctor the recognition he was robbed of from Ernesto as the Riveras reconcile with Miguel and accept music back into the family now that they know more of Coco's father.

Sometime before the next ''Dia de Los Muertos'', Coco passes away (much to Abuelita's sadness) and her photo is also placed on the ''ofrenda''. Reunited with her parents, uncles, husband, sister-in-law, and other daughter in the Land of the Dead, Coco embraces her father and later accompanies them on their visit to the Land of the Living. Coco stands next to Abuelita as they proudly watch Miguel, Abel, and Rosa [[Proud Corazón|perform a song to the family]].

==Trivia==
*Coco is Pixar’s fourth titular character, the others being [[Nemo]], [[WALL-E]], and [[Dory]], as well as the second female titular character, the first one being Dory. 
*Mamá Coco was born in 1918.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Twitter|author=Unkrich, Lee|date=December 6, 2017|url=https://twitter.com/leeunkrich/status/938285941059440647|title=1918 (reply to @PixarFreak1 what year was Socorro born?)}}</ref>
**As the film takes place in present day,<ref>{{Cite web|website=Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/leeunkrich/status/941382162355453952|title=It takes place in 2017. #AskAboutPixarCoco|author=Unkrich, Lee|date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> Coco was 99 years old at the time of ''Coco''. This is confirmed by [[Lee Unkrich]], who revealed Coco passed away at 100 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Twitter|author=Unkrich, Lee|date=December 7, 2017|url=https://twitter.com/leeunkrich/status/938551917319299072|title=100😮 (reply @kelly_morana How old was Mamá Coco when she died? If the movie takes place in the present day, she would have been almost 100, right?)}}</ref>
*Miguel's younger sister [[The Riveras|Socorro]] is named after Mamá Coco.
*During the "Remember Me" lullaby flashback, Mamá Coco's singing voice is performed by Libertad García Fonzi, who is Héctor's voice actor [[Gael García Bernal]]'s daughter in real life.
*In the Brazilian Portuguese version of the movie, her name is Inês.
*In Spanish and Portuguese, her real name (Socorro) means "help" or "aid".
**Also, her nickname "Coco" means "coconut" in Spanish and Portuguese.
*She outlived her older daughter [[The Riveras|Victoria]].
*In the novelization (which depicts her backstory in four chapters), the music ban by her mother did not stop Coco from dancing secretly. Music is also how she and Julio met and fell in love at the Mariachi Plaza (the same one their great-grandson would often sneak off to). Julio loved her so much to willingly give up music. Coco also hid her musical passion in the same hidden attic as Miguel. When she suffered a dancing-related injury which scared her daughters, she fully lived through the music ban from then on. She is also responsible for Miguel's love of music by humming a song to him when he was an infant.
*Miguel's resemblance to Héctor probably helped Coco maintain her memory of her father in her autumn years.
*Though it is never explicitly stated, Coco's failing memory is likely attributed to her having {{WikipediaLink|Alzheimer's disease}}, as evidenced by her inability to recognize her daughter at the beginning of the film and mistaking Miguel for her late husband, as well as her limited mobility.
*Being 100 at the time of her death, Mamá Coco is the oldest Rivera to be deceased.
