'''S.I.R.''' (short for '''Simulated Intelligence Robotics''') was a robot character that hosted the pre-show of the now-defunct [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
S.I.R. is a robot who was created by the [[X-S Tech]] corporation for their attempts at claiming a portion of the market in [[Tomorrowland]].  Despite being made for social purposes, S.I.R. (like the X-S corporation itself) was very clearly disturbed and cruel.

=== Development ===
The character was originally called '''T.O.M. 2000''' (short for '''Technobotic Oratorical Mechanism Series 2000''') and was voiced by [[Phil Hartman]]. He had a more light-hearted personality than the sinister personality of S.I.R., struggling with the controls and being mortified by the incident that singes Skippy's fur. This original incarnation might have been an allusion to the character of [[Tom Morrow]] who appeared in [[Rocket to the Moon]], the attraction which originally occupied the space which ExtraTERRORestrial was built on.

S.I.R. would later be given a much more sinister personality while being voiced by legendary actor [[Tim Curry]], an actor particularly known for his roles in horror movies and monster movies (''It'', ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', and ''Legend'' to name a few.)

Following ExtraTERRORestrial's closure, the S.I.R. animatronic was repurposed as [[Sargeant C4703BK2704-90210]] in [[Stitch's Great Escape!]].

== Appearances ==

=== ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter ===
As an artificial spokesman for X-S Tech, S.I.R. was sent to the Tomorrowland Convention Center on Earth as part of their teleportation presentation. In the attraction's pre-show, S.I.R. proceeds to demonstrate X-S Tech's "practically painless" teleportation technology using a cute little alien named [[Skippy (Alien)|Skippy]], whose charred and disoriented appearance after being teleported a short distance across the room suggests that the technology is flawed.

While teleporting Skippy back across the room, S.I.R. pauses the process, demonstrating how the technology can be used to suspend subjects in teleportation indefinitely, his apparent favorite feature, before ushering them into the theater to see X-S's full-sized machine and a galactic-scaled demonstration of its might.

=== Rockettower Stage ===
Advertisements for X-S Tech division RoboMart and its assorted paraphernalia (such as its robots) are played on the screen for the Tomorrowland stage during the show ''[[Stitch's Supersonic Celebration]]''. Amongst its products are S.I.R. for sale as a, "New Robot".  When Stitch began assembling robots using Robo-Mart, SIR's head was shown on their website as a possible head for him to use.

==Trivia==
*Considering that Alien Encounter was inspired by Ridley Scott's film ''[[Alien]]'' (1979), it is likely that S.I.R. was inspired by the character of ''Ash'' from the film.  Ash having been an android created by the sinisterÂ Weyland-Yutani corporation (inspiration for X-S tech) to make sure that the crew of the Nostromo secured the Xenomorph specimen.
*S.I.R. and TOM 2000 both bare a passing resemblance to [[C-3PO]].
