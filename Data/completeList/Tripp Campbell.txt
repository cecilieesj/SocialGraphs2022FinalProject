==Biography==
Not much is known about Tripp's background, besides that when he was six, he peed his pants and was known as "Captain Pee Pants" until he was eleven, and that in the third grade, he played guitar for his band with his friend [[Izzy Fuentes|Izzy]] called "Booger Smack." He was inspired to play guitar by Iron Weasel's former guitarist, Bleed. When he entered a radio contest on the radio show "The DJ Fat Man Show." He answered some questions about Iron Weasel, and thus won dinner at his house with the band. Here, then he requested playing "Pull My Finger" with Iron Weasel and since they sounded great, he asked to be their new lead guitarist. Iron Weasel refused, so Tripp tried to find them a gig. Unsuccessfully, he sneaks them into West Valley High's teacher appreciation assembly, pretending that they won the award, "Band of the Century". Here, then after their performance, Iron Weasel discovers that he lied, thus allow him into the band due to proving that he was committed to helping them. They then start working on making a comeback.
