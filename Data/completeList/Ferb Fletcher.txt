{{Quote|A brother is a brother, but I couldn't have asked for someone better than Ferb.|[[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]]}}

'''Ferb Fletcher''' is one of the two titular protagonists of the [[Disney Channel Original Series]] of [[Phineas and Ferb|the same names]]. He is an English child of the Fletcher family currently living in the American city of [[Danville]]. He is one of three children of the Flynn-Fletcher household among his step siblings [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Candace Flynn]].

Ferb rarely speaks but is not actually shy as others would assume, he only actually "does not have" much to say. He is very courageous and has the ability to think quickly and stay calm in the midst of desperate scenarios. A notable skill of his is a technical and technological proficiency he shares with his stepbrother which he can easily take advantage of and build almost anything he chooses. He is also one of the three titular characters in the ''Phineas and Ferb''/[[Milo Murphy's Law|''Milo Murphy's Law'']] universe, the other two being his stepbrother, Phineas Flynn, and his friend, [[Milo Murphy]].

==Background==
Ferb was born in [[England]] to [[Lawrence Fletcher]] and an unknown woman. At some point in their lives, Lawrence's relationship with Ferb's biological mother ended abruptly and Lawrence was left alone as a single parent caring for his young son. Eventually, Ferb and Lawrence moved to the city of [[Danville]] in the United States where his father met a woman named [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda Flynn]] and fell in love with her at a [[Love Handel]] concert.

When Lawrence married Linda, Ferb gained Linda's children, [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Candace Flynn|Candace]], as stepsiblings. Ferb has shared an enduring relationship with Phineas for which they have come to know one another not only as brothers but also as best friends.

===Official Description===
If Phineas can think it up, Ferb can build it! He is a boy of few words, but many talents.

===Development===
Ferb was created by ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' co-creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, who originally met as layout artists on the Fox Network animated series ''The Simpsons''. ''Phineas and Ferb'' was inspired by their boyhood memories of summer vacation; Povenmire and Marsh both felt the theme of school in television had fallen to redundancy and wanted to create a series that took place solely in the summertime.

Ferb's name was derived from that of a mutual friend of Povenmire and Marsh named Frank, who "owns more tools than anyone [they] know." Frank was a set-builder who had worked building and designing sets for shows such as ''{{WikipediaLink|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine}}''. Frank's wife disliked Frank's name and gave him the unusual nickname "Ferb".

===Voice===
Ferb's voice was provided by British actor [[Thomas Sangster]], who used his same voice for Ferb when speaking. However, whenever Ferb sings, [[Danny Jacob]] provided his singing voice most of the time (except for in "[[The Ballad of Badbeard (song)|The Ballad of Badbeard]]" and "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas]]"). At first, Ferb's voice seems to be slightly high and low-pitched at the same time (like Phineas' younger voice in the first half of the first season), but beginning with "[[Hail Doofania!]]" and the second season, his voice is deeper and more fancy, due to Sangster going through puberty. Ferb was originally to be voiced by [[Mitchel Musso]] before the character was made British.

{{cquote|We knew Thomas Sangster from ''{{WikipediaLink|Love Actually}}'' and ''{{WikipediaLink|Nanny McPhee}}'', and he was able to express so much. But he did it in a studio in London and never met or saw anybody else working on the show. He'd seen one episode where somebody else was the voice that he had to portray and he just got it.|4=[[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] on casting Ferb.}}
In the series' pilot episode, "[[Rollercoaster]]", Ferb was voiced by actor [[Mitchel Musso]]. When ''Phineas and Ferb'' was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his new voice. However, they enjoyed Musso to a level that they recast him as the voice of the character [[Jeremy Johnson]], which allowed him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from [[England]]. Marsh had lived in the country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.

===Personality===
Ferb is a very intelligent boy who rarely speaks (usually one line per episode), expressing himself in his actions rather than his words. His intelligence and skill are tested every day in his and Phineas' nearly impossible plans, and he always succeeds. Ferb does not show much facial expression and only occasionally smiles or frowns. He is very focused, but he has once been distracted from his goals after seeing [[Vanessa]] at Blueprint Heaven. Although very young, Ferb occasionally demonstrates a mindset that is more akin to a young adult than a child. This is demonstrated especially in the case of girls, even going as far as to say that he also takes part in these nearly impossible plans ''"...for the ladies."'' However, this doesn't stop Ferb from enjoying more juvenile activities. In addition, Ferb enjoys participating in unusual and/or downright eccentric activities or antics; such as doing dolphin style swimming in the sea to going down a water-slide using butter as a lubricant. Ferb also has a huge appetite and in "[[Lights, Candace, Action!]]", he reverts to a primal mindset when he hasn't eaten lunch. Although he rarely talks, Ferb demonstrates a wry wit and isn't afraid to speak his mind when it suits him. He spoke the most frequently while he, along with Phineas and friends, were traveling around the world on the Summer Solstice while his longest consecutive line was during the search for new pet Steve the Chameleon.

===Physical appearance===
As a toddler, Ferb wore a collared light beige shirt, dark purple overalls, and black shoes.

Currently, Ferb wears a similar collared beige shirt with a button, very high-waisted dark purple pants with a light purple belt and black tennis shoes. His hair is thick, scruffy, and leaf-green. His head is tall and rectangle-shaped, with a large cubical nose, and also shaped like an "F". He has dark blue eyes, one of which is larger than the other.

His swimwear is a dark purple pair of swimming trunks with yellow spots and a light purple lining sported with dark green sandals. In winter, he layers a light green button neckline sweater with dark green zigzags and a reindeer on the front over his outfit, while his winter-wear consists of a gray jacket with silver buttons, black snow pants, dark green boots, red gloves, a red hat, and a dark green plaid scarf. For bedtime, his PJ's are light yellow with a zipper in the collar with foot coverings and later on golden yellow with a turnover collar and cuffs, white buttons and no foot coverings.

===Abilities===
[[File:Ferb driving.jpg|thumb|250px|Ferb driving Meap's spaceship.]]
Ferb is shown to have great accuracy.

Ferb is proficient with the guitar, saxophone, trombone, synthesizer/keyboard, maracas, tambourine, bass, trumpet, bagpipes, harmonica, violin, harp, and the drums. He is very intelligent and can think on the spot.

Despite not talking much, Ferb has many talents in using his vocal skills. He is fluent in French, Japanese, Martian, and dolphin, and possibly more. He can also sing and can dramatically change the pitch of his voice.

Ferb has mechanical and technological skill. He has almost single-handily built a roller coaster and track, a real radio-controlled race car, several arenas and stadiums, a space laser (which was supposed to be an ice cream maker but the plans got accidentally switched), a monster truck, a shrinking submarine, and a time machine as well as helping build many other things.

He also has incredibly great dancing skills, which he helps Jeremy with for Candace on a national dance show. He has also proven to be good at cooking, being a chef at Chez Platapus and at Phineas and Ferb's truck stop diner.

When he grows up he wants to be a movie director. However, he already ''was'' twice.

==Appearances==
===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===
Along with Phineas, Ferb spends the summer doing outrageous activities. Phineas and Ferb decide to build a roller coaster that extends from their backyard to all over town. Not only did they create a rollercoaster, but they created a beach in their backyard as well, where Ferb sang his first known song, "[[Backyard Beach]]". A short while after that, Ferb became a member of the Phineas and the Ferb-Tones, where they became one-hit wonders in just a day.

Ferb helped Phineas remodel Mount Rushmore for Candace's birthday, carving Candace's face into the sculpture. Ferb was also a very successful time-traveler, since he and Phineas fixed a time machine at the local museum, traveling back in time to 300 million B.C. Phineas and Ferb accidentally brought Candace with them, breaking the time machine in the process. Together they took the time to practice patience while [[Isabella]] and the [[Fireside Girls]] created another time machine to retrieve them.

Phineas and Ferb helped reunite [[Love Handel]] back together for their parents' anniversary. While Phineas was trying to talk the band members into getting back together, Ferb started making music with random objects to help start a song. Later that day, Love Händel was reunited.

Ferb and his stepbrother went into space to see the star his father had bought for them. Their sister accidentally tagged along, though, and the three went on a perilous journey through the galaxy. Surviving an asteroid field and other dangers, they ran out of fuel and stopped at an asteroid where a milkshake bar stood. There, Phineas and Ferb found out that it was really a star and they owned it. Phineas and Ferb returned home and accompanied Isabella to the Night of the Falling Stars dance.

[[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and Ferb were asked for help by their friend, [[Baljeet Tjinder|Baljeet]], to help him build a portal to Mars. They successfully built it, helping Baljeet get an A+++ for his science grade. Ferb also received a camera and a chemistry set from Bastille Day. He used the chemistry set to help Baljeet grow his shrunken watermelon to be 50 feet tall, and the camera to make friends with Nosey, the Lake Nose Monster.

[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] once caused the entire universe to grow large, but everything seemed normal to Ferb and everyone else, as it did not look different.

Ferb and his brother met [[Meap]], a cute space alien who was searching for his nemesis, [[Mitch]]. Phineas and Ferb accidentally knocked his spaceship into their backyard because they were playing baseball. Meap ran off with Candace to her Bango-Ru convention. While Phineas was busy trying to find Meap with his Cute-O-Meter, Ferb was repairing Meap's spaceship.

Ferb tested Meap's spaceship out for a run when he was done repairing it. He stopped by [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz]], whom he was particularly fond of, and backed up a bit to flirt with her.

Ferb eventually met his neighbors' relatives, who were named [[Thaddeus (Phineas and Ferb)|Thaddeus]] and [[Thor (Phineas and Ferb)|Thor]]. Ferb bears an uncanny resemblance to Thor, and sure enough, it turns out that the two like to build stuff as well as Phineas and Ferb do. They then compete on who can build the biggest backyard fort, and of course, Phineas and Ferb's fort wins.

One night, while Phineas and Ferb are sleeping, [[Perry]] disappears into his lair and is told by [[Major Monogram]] that he will be assigned to a new villain, and also, a new family. Perry then leaves the following morning, leaving Ferb in a state of depression and sadness. Ferb, along with his brother decides to host an awareness campaign (much like they did for the aglets) and sings a song about Perry. Perry then arrives, cheering Ferb and the other characters up automatically.

Ferb, Phineas, Candace, their parents, and Isabella get shipwrecked on a deserted island after a storm. Lawrence asks Phineas and Ferb to help build a shelter where they can stay inside, and Phineas and Ferb do so. However, they overdo it and instead makes some sort of vacation home. Despite that they were only doing what their dad said, Candace tries to bust them (the only reason being that she's angry they didn't build something that would reach the mainland).

On a visit to the beach, Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford, and [[Irving]] goes out to look for the lost city of Atlantis. (Irving wasn't actually invited, he came with them when "Mom stopped for gas").

On Tri-State Area Unification Day, he, Phineas, and their friends decide to hijack the parade to show what Tri-State unification is all about, making giant floats of themselves, and even have Love Händel perform. Buford makes several attempts to interrupt the parade, but Ferb took precautions and managed to escape his traps. After the floats had literally floated away, Ferb and the others continue the parade by simply pulling wagons.

On the summer solstice, Ferb and his brother flew around the world in 40 hours. They stopped in Tokyo, the Himalayas, Paris, and an unknown island. In Paris, Ferb shows his crush on [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz|Vanessa]] by riding a motorcycle with her and bringing flowers for her. At the end, all of his and Phineas' friends had a celebration in their backyard.

One day, Ferb and his brother decide to build a rollercoaster again. This time they did it as a musical, but Ferb questions what assurance that he has that everyone will break into a musical number. The day ran the same as it did in the first episode. He later said that "Carpe Diem" is English for seize the day, and the entire cast breaks into a musical number.

A short while later, Ferb builds a supercomputer that can answer anything. However, Linda got a bad hairdo at a local salon and ends up having a bad hair day. To cheer her up, the boys tie balloons to industrial marking dye and a leaf blower. At 2:37 pm on that day, the items are released and Mom's bad hairdo turns back to her normal hairstyle.

On the last day of a family road trip, the boys decided to build a truck stop diner as they didn't get to go to one on their trip. Ferb received a delivery of the food and the establishment is set up. Truck drivers nearby ended up going to the diner and a song explained the scene. Candace wanted to bust the boys, but she ended up becoming a waitress there.

On Perry's fifth birthday, Ferb and his brother built a "Platypult" to celebrate. They end up landing in Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated and help Dr. Doofenshmirtz build an Other dimension-inator. Perry landed there and the boys took him to the 2nd dimension, but then they found out that he was a secret agent. Doofenshmirtz planned an invasion on the 1st dimension, so Ferb and the platypus went back with a few stops on the way. They explained summer to the counterparts of themselves and got trapped by Doofenshmirtz. Many of his friends ended the invasion and he, along with the others, had to get his memory erased to forget about Perry's identity.

Ferb's ancestors had lived very similarly to him currently. Gerb and his brother had invented the wheel and had a celebration of Can-tok inventing fire. Several centuries later, the boys helped save Princess Isabella, who had been kidnapped by Doofenshmirtz. Some time later, his ancestor Ferb-a-lot went to find the sword Excaliferb, but then it turned into a monster fight. In 1914, he and his brother set out to find the lost amulet of Juatchadoon.

One day when Doof's "Babe-inator" hit Phineas and Ferb, they were turned into babies. They still had remarkable abilities and Candace had to chase them around town. At Vivian's "aunt's sister's landlord's party", the Fireside Girls join the boys in being babies.

Ferb and his family and friends went on a trip to Africa to visit their dad's friend. They go on a safari and the boys build a highly unconventional vehicle. However, Buford messes up the machine and they fall into an uncharted gorge. Phineas was concerned that Perry was in the forest of Africa. Perry was actually trying to avoid the boys as he was accidentally sent to Africa. After the fight against Carl, who was evil, the boys meet up with their platypus. Ignatius then wonders how their platypus came to Africa, but then Ferb says that platypi are synonymous with the word impossible.

The boys decided to create an antique car for Candace. She and Jeremy were so impressed by the boy's work that they wanted to take it to the Doo Wop Hop. A song explained the ride to the event, in which Ferb was the background/secondary singer. Candace and Jeremy ended up getting a trophy for winning the competition, but they gave it to the boys.

After their mom recalls past memories of a wading pool, Ferb and Phineas decided to create a giant inflatable wading pool for her. They also helped Isabella earn her patch by turning the Fireside girls into bees. Doof's "bee-pheromones" cover the pool and a simple one is left in its place.

The Marvel superheroes powers are drained by Doofenshmirtz's inator. Ferb and his brother discover what is going on and try to get them back. However, Doof is sided with Red Skull, Whiplash, Venom, and M.O.D.O.K, who are the supervillains.

===''[[Take Two with Phineas and Ferb]]''===
[[File:FerbAdjustBowTie.jpg|thumb|250px|Ferb as the cohost of ''Take Two with Phineas and Ferb''.]]
Ferb appears in the talk show spin-off of the series as a co-host with Phineas as they talk with celebrities about various things.

==Disney Parks==
[[File:ParkFerb.jpg|thumb|250px|Ferb posing for a photo at Disney's Hollywood Studios.]]
Phineas and Ferb made their theme park debut at [[Disneyland]] for a taping of the [[Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade]] in [[2009]]. They then appeared at [[Walt Disney World]] for an appearance in a [[Disney 365]] spot about the ''Phineas and Ferb'' video game with [[Alyson Stoner]]. Afterward, they, along with [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]], appeared at Disney's pavilion of the Licensing Expo in Las Vegas on June 7, 2010. The three later appeared as meetable characters at the newly designed Disney Store at The Shops in Montebello, California. They also appeared for the grand opening of their new flagship store in Times Square, New York. In 2011 Phineas and Ferb started making regular appearances at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] and [[Disney California Adventure]] in the [[Phineas and Ferb's Rockin' Rollin' Dance Party]]. Ferb along with his brother Phineas also appeared in the summer edition of the night time show ''[[Celebrate the Magic]]''. Ferb also appears during random portions of [[Agent P's World Showcase Adventure]] in between parts of the mission. The boys also made special appearances with Perry during the [[D23 Expo]] in 2011 to promote ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'', and with [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]] for the 2013 expo to promote "[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]". Phineas and Ferb also showed up on [[Disney Cruise Line]] ships around 2012 to 2015. They also appear during the [[Move It! Shake It! Dance and Play It! Street Party]] in the [[Magic Kingdom]]. As of 2016 however, their meet and greet in Disney's Hollywood Studios has been closed, so it's not likely to meet them anytime soon. The Rockin' Rolling Dance Party had it's final performance on November 2, 2014 so it's highly unlikely to find Phineas and Ferb at Disneyland Resort either.

==Trivia==
*"Ferb" is revealed to be a shortened version of his actual name. The birth-name of the man whom Ferb is named and based on is Frank, so it is likely the same goes with the cartoon Ferb.<ref name="Frank">[http://downloads.wired.com/podcasts/assets/thegeekdads/thegeekdadsspecialphineasandferb.mp3?_kip_ipx=1895089171-1238013329]</ref>
**However, in a video, Dan Povenmire claims that it is short for "Ferbs" (they never said it was A LOT shorter).<ref name="Ferbs">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMsk_kS6b9E]</ref> This is also confirmed in the episode "[[Act Your Age]]" when Vanessa calls him "Ferbs".
*He has one eye that is larger than the other. The eye farthest away from the viewpoint of the audience is one that is almost always larger. When Ferb turns his head, the size of both eyes change, swapping sizes (the small eye enlarges and the large eye shrinks). However, his right eye is the larger of the two when he is viewed head on. This may be an homage to {{WikipediaLink|Bill the Cat}}, the feline from Berkeley Breathed's various comic strips. Bill's eyes also change size when he looks into something, with the larger eye always being closest to the reader's viewpoint.
*Ferb was named after a friend of creators [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] and [[Dan Povenmire]] who knows everything about tools. Though, as stated by the creators, "Ferb is anything but quiet."
*In ''{{WikipediaLink|Rocko's Modern Life}}'', a show that [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] and [[Dan Povenmire]] worked on, someone with the name "Ferb" is mentioned many times.
*In the Original Pitch, Ferb is one of the few characters to remain pretty much the same as his final outcome. The only difference from the pitch is that he doesn't speak at all. This could be that the creators didn't intend on Ferb ever speaking.
*According to Candace, Phineas and Ferb smell of motor oil and confidence.
*He has obtained five world records. Four with Phineas in "[[Bowl-R-Ama Drama]]" and "[[De Plane! De Plane!]]" (largest bowling ball, largest pinball game, two records in one day, largest papier-mache airplane), and one without Phineas in "[[Elementary My Dear Stacy]]" (as shown, fastest sliding on a water slide).
*Due to an old English phone booth with the name "Chelsea" on it in the back of his side of the room, it is possible he is from Chelsea, London.
*Actor [[Thomas Sangster]] records his dialogue for Ferb in England.<ref>[http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/12/17/love-actually-olivia-olson/ Entertainment Weekly interview]</ref>
*Two Space Adventure fans say he has an invisible cape just like Harry Potter owns as seen in the Books and the Adaptations, such as the film series and Video Games.
*He is a fan of both Stumbleberry Finkbat and [[Space Adventure]].
*He can play chess very well as he played chess to escape the maze from "[[We Call it Maze]]".
*He is an internationally ranking video gaming champion as revealed in "[[Brain Drain]]".
*He can communicate with dolphins as revealed in "[[Voyage to the Bottom of Buford]]" and with Martians in "[[Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)]]".
*In "[[My Fair Goalie]]", it was revealed that he is an excellent soccer player, but a little while before summer, he was given the Emu's Curse, and could never be on a winning soccer team again. He didn't play soccer again until he and Phineas built the Football X-7 stadium. Right before the game could end, his curse was broken thanks to Baljeet. It is also revealed that Ferb has a blog.
*He used his toes as temporary hands in "[[Escape from Phineas Tower]]".
*He is nicknamed "Ferbuch" in "[[The Beak]]" by his stepbrother.
*His favorite color is yellow, as mentioned in the book ''[[Phineas and Ferb's Guide to Life]]''.
*On the back of his action figure, it states that he is, in fact, nine years old. However, this may not be entirely accurate. In "[[Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo]]", after Candace travels 20 years into the future, Linda states that Phineas and Ferb are now 30 years old. At the very least, Ferb is somewhere between the ages of 6 and 15.
*He can dunk himself into a basketball hoop.
*One of Ferb's favorite foods is haggis.
*Ferb makes a cameo in one of Bleedman's popular webcomic ''PowerPuff Girls Doujinshi''.
*Ferb has a double life.
*Unlike Phineas, he wasn't mad when he found out Perry's secret in ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''.
*He does not talk a lot like Phineas does and so he is like the opposite of Phineas when it comes to talking.
*Ferb is an excellent dancer.
*He can untie a rope with his toes, like fingers.
*Ferb knew that [[Isabella]] liked [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] before Phineas did.
*Ferb, at one point, in some early ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' trailers, was supposed to be playable, though the idea was scrapped during the development of the game.
**However, he is found in the files.
