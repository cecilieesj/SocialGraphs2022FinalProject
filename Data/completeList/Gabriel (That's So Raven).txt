==Season 1==
[[Raven Baxter|Raven]] had a vision that Gabriel would ask her to be his girlfriend, so she began to drop hints so he would as her to the dance, ignoring advances by Ben Sturky.
Eventually, Raven gave up and decided to ask Ben just before Gabriel called to ask Raven to the dance. Raven decided to go with both and hop back and forth until finding out the "Rae" Gabriel mentioned in her vision wasn't her, but Rachel. Raven apologized to Ben.
