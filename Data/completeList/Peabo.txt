==Biography==
He is a 9 year old (formerly 7 prior to the movie) who unwittingly always makes trouble for [[Oscar Proud]], he also used to have a crush on [[Penny Proud|Penny ]] and [[Zoey Howzer|Zoey]]. Despite his age, he is very smart. He is also constantly telling Oscar he doesn't think he should do something but despite his warnings, Oscar does it, anyway, and gets hurt. Usually ending with: "I told you, Mr. Proud". He is also the only person who genuinely likes Proud Snacks. He often inadvertently gets Oscar into trouble when trying to dissuade him from doing something hazardous (e.g. Oscar getting electrocuted, caught by [[Trudy Proud|Trudy]] when trying to fraternize with two attractive female lifeguards on tv, and attacked by a giant bird). Peabo's catchphrase is "Remember what happened last time", after reminding Oscar of a last time Oscar has done something that had gotten him hurt.

He seems to hang around the Prouds a lot, and also attends church with them.

==Trivia==
* Peabo's voice actress, Cree Summer, also did the voices of Susie Carmichael from Nickelodeon's ''Rugrats'' and Numbuh 5/Abigail Lincoln from Cartoon Network's ''Codename: Kids Next Door''.
