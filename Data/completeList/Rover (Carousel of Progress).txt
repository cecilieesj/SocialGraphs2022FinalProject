==Appearances==
===Carousel of Progress===
In each scene throughout each decade, Rover would lie on the floor near his owner, [[John (Carousel of Progress)|John]]. In the final scene, he is sitting and wearing a Christmas bow. 

===The Ghost Gallery===
In the 1990s, [[Walt Disney World]] [[cast member]]s created an unofficial but influential backstory for [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|The Haunted Mansion]]. In this story, Rover would be revealed to have been from a litter of five puppies with the each of the different scenes' dogs in Carousel of Progress being a different dog with their names being: Rover, '''Queenie, Sport, and Spot''' who lived in the attraction.

These dogs were the sibling of Bony, the [[Caretaker]]'s dog from the Haunted Mansion and that they were the pups of, "Loki", the ghost dog seen by the mummy in the ride. They were the grandpups of [[Master Gracey]]'s pet, [[Hellhound]], and also descendants of the dog from Fort [[Mark Twain|Sam Clemens]] on [[Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island|Tom Sawyer Island]] and the [[Prison Dog]] from [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]].

==Trivia==
*In [[2017]], Rover was the subject of the [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] card "Rover's Christmas Carousel of Progress" given out exclusively at [[Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party]]. It is modeled after his position in the final scene. However, unlike in the attraction where he is wearing a Christmas bow, he is wearing a virtual reality headset that appears to be shooting out digital Christmas images.
