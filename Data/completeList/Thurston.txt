==Trivia==
*Thurston's name was revealed by his voice actor, [[Kevin Schon]], who said that it was intended to be a tribute to Jim Backus, who played Thurston Howell on the 1960s sitcom ''Gilligan's Island''.
**For a while, it looked as if the Lion Guard did not know his name as when Ono was asked what zebra was in trouble, he responded by simply doing an impersonation of Thurston. Sometime later, Kion calls him by name with Thurston telling another zebra, "I told you they knew my name!"
*Ironically, zebras are supposed to be some of the smartest animals in Africa. Their survival skills, water and grass locating abilities and defensive maneuvers are some of their more excellent prowess.
