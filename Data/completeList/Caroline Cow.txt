[[File:Caroline_Cow.gif|thumb|251px]]'''Caroline Cow''' (sometimes known as '''Carolyn Cow''') was part of the original [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon cast. The name is used for the generic cow that is often seen in black and white Mickey Mouse cartoons, but is not to be confused with [[Clarabelle Cow]]. Her three major roles were in the cartoon "[[Plane Crazy]]", in which she nearly gets run over by an airplane, "[[Mickey's Choo-Choo]]", in which she nearly gets run over by a train, and her final cartoon "[[The Nifty Nineties]]", in which she nearly gets run over by a car.
