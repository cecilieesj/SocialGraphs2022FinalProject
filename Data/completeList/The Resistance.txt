'''The Resistance''' is a small band of citizens of [[Danville]] who oppose the dictatorship of [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension)|Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] and his family of the 2nd Dimension of the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' universe.

==Background==
The Resistance was founded by [[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)|Candace]] sometime after the Doofenshmirtz family conquered The Tri-State Area with their armies of Norm Bots and Animal Borgs, without the knowledge of her parents. Several 2nd Dimension counterparts of 1st Dimension characters have almost immediately joined, either serving in roles that oversee Doofenshmirtz family being foiled in some way, such as [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro (2nd Dimension)|Isabella]], or roles that involve providing help to members on the outside, such as [[Baljeet Tjinder (2nd Dimension)|Baljeet]]. Their activities against the Doofenshmirtz family are unknown, although the organization and Doofenshmirtz family seemed to have established a feud similar to that of the 1st Dimension [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]] and [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Heinz]]. At some point, one member, [[Buford Van Stomm (2nd Dimension)|Buford]], became heavily focused on rebelling against the Doofenshmirtz family that he abandoned his colleagues and became an independent rebel.

Prior to the arrival of a group of 1st Dimension citizens, there were ten known Resistance members, with the possibility of more members in Danville open.
