The '''Golden Squid''' is  a character in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''.

==Role in the series==
The Golden Squid is a sullen, massive creature that resides in the depths of the Never Sea. It is known for its magical ink, but it is one of the few aquatic creatures that isn't willing to comply with the [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]]. [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] tries to find the squid to gather ink for [[Cubby]]'s map in the special "[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Rescue|Jake's Never Land Rescue]]". When Jake asks it to spare some of its magical ink, this instead sends the squid into a rage and chases Jake through the the sea.

Luckily, [[Flow the Dolphin|Flow]] helps Jake swim away from the squid as it pursues them, where they trick it into swimming into a narrow surface which causes the squid to get caught between a rock pillar. With the animal safely incapacitated, Jake gets close enough to the squid to tickle it into releasing some of its magical ink. However, the squid manages to break free and swims away, but spares Jake due to its uncontrollable state of laughter.
