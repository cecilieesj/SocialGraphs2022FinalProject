'''The Robot''' is a minor villain featured in the live-action film, ''[[Sky High]]''.
==History==
The Robot was created by [[Royal Pain]] to wreak havoc on the city. Unbeknownst to everyone, the real reason it was created was to trick [[The Commander]] and [[Jetstream]] in destroying it. Royal Pain knew that the commander likes to keep tropies of his victories, soÂ she designed the eye to be a camera so she could spy on The Commander and Jetstream. Jetstream hurled the Commander's powerful body into the robot, toppling it.

After the robot died, the Commander took the eye to his secret lair where she discovered that he was keeping her old weapon, [[The Pacifier (Sky High)|the Pacifier]].
