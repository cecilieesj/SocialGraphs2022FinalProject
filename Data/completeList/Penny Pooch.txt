==Background==
Penny is said to be athletic and goofy in personality. She is featured in Minnie ‘n Me; a merchandising line of products. They were collector’s cards and books designed for pre-teen girls. She forms a trio with Minnie and Daisy, much like the trio of [[Mickey]], [[Donald]] and [[Goofy]].

==Trivia==
*There is fan speculation that she could possibly be the (future) [[Mrs. Goof]] and mother of [[Max Goof]]. This is based off the fact that she has red hair and a reddish nose like the description of the mysterious Mrs. Goof.
