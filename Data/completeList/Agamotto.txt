He returned in "Eye of Agamotto Part 1", and fully appeared in Part 2, where he is revealed to be evil and wanted his eye back. He was able to change most of the Avengers into their evil counterparts. It took the willpower of [[Hulk]] and the mind of Doctor Strange to reseal him back in his dimension.
