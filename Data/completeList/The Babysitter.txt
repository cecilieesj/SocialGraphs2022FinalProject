'''The Babysitter''' appeared in the fourth season ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[[Terrible Twos]]". His face was played by [[Bruce Lanoil]], his body was puppeteered by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Fisher Tom Fisher] and his voice was provided by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/John_Glover John Glover]. Having failed to get results from [[Dr. Herder|a pediatrician]] and an animal trainer, the Sinclairs follow [[Ethyl Phillips|Ethyl's]] suggestion and call in an expert to tame [[Baby Sinclair]].

The Babysitter has experience in expunging evil spirits and battling the forces of darkness. He wears a pacifier as a crucifix to ward off the baby and insists that no dessert be offered until he has eaten his dinner: "The power of rice compels you!" He emphasizes the importance of boundaries and tries reading from "the bedtime book" (''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Theodor_Geisel Blue Eggs and Toast]''). As a last resort, the Babysitter invokes a time-out and asks [[Frances Sinclair|Fran]] and [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] to lock the door and refrain from opening it, no matter what they hear. The Babysitter falters, however, and is defenestrated by Baby Sinclair.

The character, and that entire portion of the episode, references ''The Exorcist'' (1973), with the Babysitter standing in for Father Merrin.
