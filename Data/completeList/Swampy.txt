He is an alligator who lives under the city in the sewers. He also is the only alligator who loves to be clean and take showers. His first appearance is in level 1-1/ "Meet Swampy" as a unique and different character from other alligators, in terms of his personality. Unlike other alligators, he is very nice, kind and generous to other ones that aren't even nice to him. As you find out later in this tale that Swampy is in love with a girl alligator named [[Allie]] that used to love Swampy's enemy who is named [[Cranky]]. Swampy also loves his Rubber Duck. He dislikes Poison Water, Ooze and Mud. He wants to take a shower with just plain Water.

== Appearance ==
Swampy takes on the appearance of an anthropomorphic short green alligator that walks on two legs and he is the smallest alligator in the sewer, making him slightly shorter than his girlfriend Allie. His eyes have blue irises, and he has three teeth poking out of his mouth; two on the left side, one on the right. He has a long curvy tail with purple rounded scales running down it and his back. He also has lighter green spots on his arms and legs, a round light-green belly, and blue-colored claws on his hands and feet. In earlier versions, his teeth were yellow rather than a clean white.

Furthermore, Swampy shares a mixture of features that can be found on either Allie or Cranky. His eyes are the same shape as Allie but his pupils resemble that of Cranky. Also like Cranky, he has spots rather then patches on his arms and the same 3 spots on his legs as Allie. Swampy has blue fingers and toes just like Cranky and purple scales on his back just like Allie. The lines on his belly and his two teeth are virtually identical to that of Allie. Except that Allie's teeth face downward and she has 5 lines rather then 4 on her hourglass shaped belly. His snout also resembles that of Allie's, but its thicker and his nostrils are wide like Cranky. Swampy also has the same looking fingers as Cranky, but they are rather short and stumpy.

== Personality ==
Unlike other alligators, Swampy is very nice and follows a golden rule in the first game. He is shy but loving, and never shows hatred or aggression to other alligators. Though living in a sewer, Swampy is obsessed with cleanliness and this drives the simple story of the game. He is incredibly sweet and innocent, which makes him an easy target for Cranky and his gang, who despise Swampy for his human-like qualities. After finding a purple bow in the dump and gifting it to Allie, the two have been in a relationship since much to Cranky 's displeasure who used to be Allie's boyfriend. Swampy also loves his Rubber Duck. 

Swampy is a very clean alligator who doesn’t want to be dirty. He takes baths and showers regularly, in doing so only wants to bath in plain water. He frequently uses cutlery for eating. He likes to avoid mud and rain. Despite his dislike for mess, it doesn't stop him finding items in the Sewer and treasuring them. On one occasion, on of the alligators ate some of his collection putting him into stress. 

In the second game, Swampy has a much younger appearance and personality. Swampy is portrayed as a playful energetic child, while Allie and Cranky on the other hand somewhat portrayed as adults. Swampy also loves his Rubber Duck. Swampy is a very calm, happy and bubbly alligator. He may be shy but he is loving, and never shows hatred or aggression to other alligators.

In Where's My Water?: Swampy's Underground Adventures, he looks out for all the alligators. Swampy hangs out with his girlfriend [[Allie]] and sometimes [[Cranky]] the most. Swampy eventually wears his swimming gears on to jump into the water with Cranky and the other alligators in the episode Out to Dry. 

Swampy is arguably one of the most curious alligators in the Sewer, often getting himself into trouble and he loves his adventure companion, Ducky. Swampy and Cranky are still enemies, they both take the lead at times and both show care for each other.

==Background==

==Appearances==
===''[[Where's My Water?]]''===
Swampy is the main character of the app and lives amongst the other alligators beneath the city streets in a sewer. Here, Swampy is in outcast with no real friends. He keeps happy by doing what he loves best, taking baths. He has a crush on the only female gator in the clan Allie. Swampy often strives to impress Allie but because of her boyfriend Cranky, who is also the leader of the clan, Swampy rarely prevails. He is often teased by the other gators because of his nature which is strikingly similar to that of a normal human.

===''[[Disney Emoji Blitz]]''===
On May 10, 2017, Swampy was added to the game's code, implying he will become a playable character at some point. Assuming he does get added, this will make him the first character from ''Where's My Water?'' to be added to the game.

== Trivia ==
* Swampy is voiced by Justin T. Bowler
* Since Swampy is a child, he shares a mixture of features that can be found on either Allie or Cranky. This is because child characters like himself don't have the same features as their adults counterparts, however the features can match from either parent.
* Like Allie, he has a notable, distinctive laugh and hum.
* He is also the first original Disney character created for a mobile game.
* Swampy juggled yellow balls in an older version (rather than blue).
* Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Swampy has four fingers and two toes. But real gators have''' ''' 5 toes on the front legs while the back legs have only 4 toes.
