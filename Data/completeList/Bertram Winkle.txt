'''Bertram Winkle''' is the Ross family's butler. He is disinclined to work and quite sarcastic. He is shown actually doing work, however, only when the Ross parents are visiting.

==Personality==
Bertram is the Ross family's lazy, sarcastic butler, who seems to care very little for the kids and calls them "The Nanny Killers." Even though he rarely shows it, he does have a soft side for them. He doesn't however, seem to like [[Jessie Prescott|Jessie]], though he sometimes gives her advice, not knowing his intentions and mistakes where she is from. It is possible that he cares for her in a brotherly, possibly fatherly way, as he walks Jessie down the aisle on her wedding day. Bertram often takes time for himself and wishes he could quit his job, but doesn't. He spends his time cleaning, reading magazines on the couch, watching TV in the screening room, and eating bacon-wrapped donuts. The Ross kids insult him sometimes, like when he tries to help them. When the Ross parents are home he pays extra attention to his job.

==Relationships==
===Rhoda Chesterfield===
[[Rhoda Chesterfield|Mrs. Chesterfield]] is seen flirting in the lobby with Bertram. She smacks his butt and then follows him to the elevator, smiling. Bertram does not return her feelings (Are You Cooler Than a 5th Grader?). In "Romancing the Crone", Bertram asks Mrs. Chesterfield on a date in order for Jessie and [[Zuri Ross|Zuri]] try to get Mrs. Ross's tiara from Mrs. Chesterfield's terrace.

==Trivia==
*Out of all the Ross kids, he dislikes [[Luke Ross|Luke]] the most and likes Zuri and Ravi the most.
*He is a hoarder.
*He wanted to go to Mexico for his Christmas vacation (Christmas Story).
*Most of his high school classmates got bald and/or went to jail. (One Day Wonders)

*He was probably on the wrestling team in high school.
*He has a "Butlers of the World" game card collection (Creepy Connie Comes a Callin').
*He weighs 279 lbs.
*Despite his size, he is a coward. He even sobs just like the Cowardly Lion from the 1939 film ''The Wizard of Oz'' many times in the series, a possible reference to the fact that Kevin Chamberlin once played that same character in the stage version. 
*Mr. Kipling sometimes gets attached to his legs.
*He has been beaten up by every one of the Ross kids. (A Christmas Story)
*He has a blog. (One Day Wonders)
*He wants a rich girlfriend named Lola. (The Princess and the Pea Brain)
