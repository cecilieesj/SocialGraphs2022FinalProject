'''Red Guards''' (also known as '''Glitch Guards''') are the security programs loyal to [[Commander Sark]] and the [[MCP]] in the computer world. It is assumed that Sentries are the updated versions of guards. They use long Light Staffs to stun programs and also to block attacks. They haven't demonstrated the use of their [[Identity Disc|identity discs]] as weapons. Their primary function is acting as security for the MCP and [[the Grid]]. They are used to escort conscripts to the games from their cells. They also search for and round up any rogue programs.

==Trivia==
*The Guard is called "Warrior" in the [[1982]] Tron toyline.
