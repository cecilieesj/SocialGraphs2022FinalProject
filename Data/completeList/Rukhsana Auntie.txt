Rukhsana arrives at a boat club to meet [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] and her daughter, [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], who have flown in from [[New Jersey]]. She rushes to Muneeba's side and apologizes for running late, and Muneeba introduces her to Kamala. Rukhsana comments on how pretty Kamala looks and notes that Kamala isn't a typical Pakistani name, which is reminiscent of Muneeba's formerly rebellious nature. Muneeba hopes Rukhsana doesn't mind they're sitting outside, as Kamala is wearing jeans, which goes against the clubs policies, and Rukshana questions if that's why Kamala is hot. Kamala points at the food for being the reason, and Rukhsana informs her it's called panipuri.
