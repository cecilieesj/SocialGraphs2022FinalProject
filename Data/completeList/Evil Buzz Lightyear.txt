He comes from an alternate universe, where he, instead of [[Emperor Zurg|Zurg]], is the Evil Emperor, and has complete control over the galaxy.

==Personality==
He is probably even more evil than Zurg himself. He acknowledges his villainy and refuses to change, due to it being more amusing to him.

He is very intelligent and thorough as he recognized the threats good Buzz poses due to their similar way of thinking.

==History==
His first appearance is in the episode "The Lightyear Factor." When one of Zurg's [[Brain Pods|brain pods]] opened a portal to the alternate universe, Evil Buzz came back through with Zurg and they attempted to destroy Star Command; however, they were foiled by the good [[Buzz Lightyear]].

In a subsequent episode "Sunquake," it is revealed while drifting in space that Evil Buzz has taken on the disguise as [[Shiv Katall]] and teamed up with [[Gravitina]]. She initially mistook him for his good counterpart, though realized otherwise, and was pleased to find a Buzz that was already evil. The pair constructed a heat-proof base just above the sun's surface, from which to use Gravitina's powers to shoot solar flares at Star Command, Capital Planet, and wherever else they feel like.

Good Buzz and [[Mira Nova]] set the station to fall into the sun, and Evil Buzz makes a run for his ship, preparing to abandon Gravitina along with Buzz and Mira. Before he can, however, the floor splits under him, and he falls into the sun. He should presumably die as a result, but in the end, he is shown to escape, although how he achieved that isn't explained, and he isn't seen again afterward. Because of this, however, it can be assumed that he survived somehow.

== Trivia ==

* ''[[Lightyear]]''<nowiki/>'s incarnation of Zurg is also an evil Buzz from an alternate future that has assumed Zurg's identity and traveled back in time to prevent the crash that marooned Buzz's colony on Tikana Prime even at the cost of damaging the space time continuum.
