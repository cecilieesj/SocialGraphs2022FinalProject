He got fired from his job, "one time Pim was messing with the New Ager", and turned Lloyd into a 2-year-old, "for telling his boss he made a 'poopie'." Some time later, he and his family took a trip in a used time machine and got stuck in the year [[2004]]. After being there for two years, they returned to the future, leaving behind a caveman named [[Curtis]]. He was a Pozotronic engineer, worked at WizardCorp in 2121, and loves "older music". He was paranoid about the government (and [[Neil Hackett]]) figuring out he and his family are from the future. During their stay, he and Curtis got jobs at the Mantis hardware store.
