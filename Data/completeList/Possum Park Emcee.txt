==Role in the film==

When [[Goofy]] and [[Max Goof|Max]] enter the theater to watch the Possum Posse Jamboree animatronic show at [[Lester's Possum Park]], the Emcee announces, "Howdy there, folks. Lester's is proud to present the Possum Posse Jamboree. Here it is."

During the show, the animatronic of Lester begins to break down, to which the Emcee thumps the stage with his right arm and makes it work right again. The Emcee doesn't appear again for the remainder of the film after this.

==Trivia==
*The role of the Possum Park Emcee is the final film role for [[Pat Buttram]]. He died on [[January 8]], [[1994]] from kidney failure at the age of 78, a year before the film was released.
