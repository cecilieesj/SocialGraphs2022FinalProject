'''Farmer Stinky''' is a character in the [[Disney Junior]] series, ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]''.
As his name implies, Farmer Stinky is a farmer and he enjoys being a farmer, too. He is the cousin of [[Priscilla Skunk]] and the two couldn't be more opposite when it comes to cleanliness and hygiene.

Stinky plays a big role in the episode segment, "[[My Fair Stinky]]". When Stinky inadvertently embarrasses Priscilla in front of her friends from a flower club she's part of, Priscilla decides to try and change Stinky into a suave gentleman. She was successful, but she let Stinky go back to his old ways closer to the end of the segment.
