The '''Time Baby''' is a giant, time-manipulating being from ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

He is the last of his kind—an extinct race of time giants—and weighs approximately 9 trillion tons. At some unknown point in the past, the Time Baby was frozen in a glacier in the Antarctic. Due to global warming, he was thawed out in the distant future and started causing havoc upon human civilization.

[[Bill Cipher]] destroys him in [[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]. However, the episode's cryptogram reveals that Time Baby will reconstruct after 1000 years.
