'''LEGO Bunny''' is a character who appears in the [[2013]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated special, ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''.  He is a yellow rabbit entirely made out of [[LEGO]] bricks who is capable of using his ability to shapeshift into various LEGO forms.

==Background==
LEGO Bunny is a sentient being who can take many shapes due to his ability to use LEGO bricks (which he is made of) to shapeshift into many different forms. Though he does not speak, he is capable of transforming into certain objects such as a staircase to give toys a better view, a ladder as a support to the toys, or even as a package. He is often assisted by a female construction worker toy riding on her forklift whenever LEGO Bunny transforms into a certain object.

===Development===
Prior to appearing onscreen in ''Toy Story of Terror!'', LEGO Bunny was first created by [[Angus MacLane]] himself through the use of real-world LEGO bricks as MacLane himself was a huge LEGO fan just before having the real-life model being imported to the computer for him to appear in animation. According to character modeling artist, Jonas Jarvers, he created an animation tool which allowed the animators to animate LEGO bricks coming apart of LEGO Bunny to dial in the gaps in between the single bricks to animate LEGO Bunny<ref>"Team of Specialists" bonus feature (''Toy Story of Terror!'' Blu-ray Disc)</ref>.

==Role in the short==
When [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], [[Jessie]], and the rest of Bonnie's toys find themselves in a cabinet at the Sleep Well motel at [[Ronald Tompkins|Ron]]'s office, [[Combat Carl|Combat Carl Jr.]] commands LEGO Bunny to help Woody and the gang find a way to escape which he transforms into a staricase to help the toys escape with the help of a construction worker toy and her forklift him in the form of a staircase where Carl Jr. uses a paperclip handed out by [[Pocketeer]] which he uses it as a hook to open a door handle which the attempt was unsuccessful. Later the next day, [[Combat Carl|Combat Carl Sr.]] commands the other toys to think of a plan to escape just as Jessie puts the tenacity in herself while LEGO Bunny remains with the other toys inside the cabinet to know if Ron is present in his office giving him and the other toys an attempt to escape which Jessie manages to get the missing arms of Combat Carl and [[Mr. Potato Head]] respectively.

Soon as Bonnie and her mother plan to leave with her toys back, LEGO Bunny transforms into a ladder, allowing Combat Carl and the other toys to escape the cabinet as the toys leave to wait for transport upon seeing a delivery truck arrive as commanded by [[PEZ Cat]] which LEGO Bunny (in the form of a package) who is carried by his construction worker toy assistant on her forklift follows alongside the other toys from the [[Sleep Well]] motel just as LEGO Bunny transforms to his rabbit form just as they arrive at the transport truck to Billy's house.

==Trivia==
*LEGO Bunny has a major animation limitation based on the toy he is designed after, due to the fact that LEGO Bunny cannot walk by himself and the way he is animated is when he disintegrates into multiple bricks to transform into another form (such as a staircase or a ladder).
*[[Angus MacLane]], who directed the TV special and designed LEGO Bunny, ironically is a huge [[LEGO]] fan.
