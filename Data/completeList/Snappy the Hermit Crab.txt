'''Snappy''' is a little hermit crab that inhabits pink and purple spotted seashell. He is also good friends with [[Marina]] and [[Stormy]].

==Role in the series==
Snappy first appeared in the episode [[The Old Shell Game]] After thwarting [[Captain Hook]]'s plan to steal the shell from the sea pups. Jake and his crew return to [[Pirate Island]], where they learn the shell was the home of a Hermit Crab, so Izzy set him free.

The Hermit Crab would later return in the episode "[[The Mermaid's Song]]." In the episode, the crab's name was revealed as Snappy as he tagged along with [[Stormy]] the mermaid as her brief partner-in-crime while the young mermaid used the power of the "Mermaid's Song" to hypnotize Captain Hook, [[Mr. Smee]], and [[Cubby]]. Snappy the Hermit Crab would later rush off to warn Marina about her sister abusing the power of the Mermaid's Song.

Snappy makes a brief cameo in the episode "[[Captain Who?]]" as Jake and his crew tries to restore Captain Hook's memory. Snappy makes a brief appearance at the end of "[[Treasurefalls!]]" retrieving Cubby's lost Skull-N-Bones marble from the bottom of Never Sea, and returns it back to Cubby.

Snappy reappears in the episode "[[Jake's Royal Rescue]]" rehearsing a song with [[Sandy the Starfish]] and Stormy in [[Queen Coralie]] honor held at [[Hidden Cove]]. After Queen Coralie is rescued by Jake and his crew from Captain Hook and return to Hidden Cove, Snappy can be spotted successfully singing with Sandy, Marina, Stormy, and the [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]].
