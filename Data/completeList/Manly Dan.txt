He is the father of [[Wendy Corduroy|Wendy]] and the [[Corduroy Brothers|Corduroy boys]]. He appears to often be followed by the [[Tyler Cutebiker|Cute Biker]].
==Background==
===Personality===
Manly Dan is the proud father figure, often showing his children how to do activities, like fishing, in his own manly way. Besides this, he is also an emotionally unstable lumberjack. He also may have a rather bad temper since in "Headhunters" he gets so mad that he punched the post almost all the way down.

===Physical appearance===
Manly Dan looks, as his name implies, very manly. He is extremely large and muscular, and sports a red beard, with his chest hair and armpit hair barely concealed. Manly Dan has short, bright red hair similar in color to Wendy's hair. He wears a stereotypical lumberjack outfit.
==Role in the series==
Manly Dan is first seen in "[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]", where he is fishing with his kids. He snaps his son's fishing pole, and proceeds to catch a fish with his bare hands and beats it up, with his kids and the Cute Biker cheering him on. He is later seen running when fish start falling from the sky, yelling that they're coming for revenge.

He is next seen in "[[Headhunters]]", as part of the crowd at [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]]'s wax museum unveiling. He gets angry when he learns that Stan lied about giving free pizza, and punches a pole as he leaves. He has later deemed a suspect for the murder of Wax Stan by [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], due to the ax found at the crime scene. He and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] go to the bar he hangs out at and interrogates him; however, Dipper learns that he is not the culprit. Manly Dan does tell Dipper that the ax is a left-handed one, which helps Dipper narrow the suspects down to all left-handed suspects.

He is seen again in "[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]", eating at Greasy's Diner with [[Wendy]]. When Dipper fails to win a manliness tester, Dan effortlessly wins it using his pinky finger, winning all the patrons free pancakes. Then when Dipper is in the forest, Dan runs away from the [[Manotaurs|beast]] coming their way.

In "[[Irrational Treasure]]", Manly Dan eats meat with the Cute Biker on Pioneer Day.

Manly Dan appears next in "[[Fight Fighters]]", where he goes on a camping trip with Wendy and her brothers.

Dan reappears in "[[Summerween]]", trick-or-treating with his sons while dressed up as Vikings, and having them ram through a door.
