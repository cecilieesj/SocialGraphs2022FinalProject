==Role in the film==
At the beginning of the film, Elizabeth narrates the result about the legend of Briarville's troll, [[Trantor]] and how future descendants of [[Phineas Worrell]] (especially [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]]) will not be very smart whatsoever for an annual classroom report in school. She is friends with her schoolmates, [[Kenny Binder]] and [[Joey (Ernest Scared Stupid)|Joey]], as well as Ernest, who works the town garbage collector. She, Kenny, and Joey go to their clubhouse after school and Joey and Kenny worship her feet and she and Joey wear her converse. After [[Mike Murdock|Mike]] and [[Matt Murdock]] destroy Kenny's cardboard haunted house, she relocates with Ernest, Kenny, and Joey underneath the tree, where Trantor is dormant near [[Francis Hackmore|Old Lady Hackmore]]'s mansion. He later roams Briarville once again to transform children into wooden dolls. [[Elizabeth's mother]] tells her to have fun trick-or-treating and that trolls do not exist, especially on Halloween. She becomes Trantor's third victim when she lays in bed and is scared because there is something under it. So she puts her hand down, pulls up the covers, and looks under the bed to find out it was only her stuffed bear. When she gets up back on the bed she closes her eyes, hugs her bear, turns over, and opens her eyes to find Trantor laying beside her. She screams but he turns her into a wooden doll. The curse lasts until Ernest defeats Trantor once and for all.
