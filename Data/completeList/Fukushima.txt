'''Fukushima''' is a minor character from the series ''[[Kim Possible]]''. He was a student at the [[Yamanouchi Ninja School]] and [[Master Sensei]]. He betrayed them when he allied himself with [[Monkey Fist]], whom he told the location of the [[Lotus Blade]].

He had this rivalry with [[Ron Stoppable]], who was an exchange student at the Yamanouchi Ninja School, frequently calling Ron "Outsider".

When he allied himself with Monkey Fist, they were able to steal the Lotus Blade and capture [[Yori (Kim Possible)|Yori]]. After Yori was captured, Fukushima agreed to help Ron in rescuing her, but it was a trap, which he was purposely leading Ron into. Ron then defeated Fukushima by tapping into and channeling his own Mystical Monkey Power for the first time.
