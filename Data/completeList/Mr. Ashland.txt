}}'''Mr. Ashland''', voiced by [[Wikipedia:John Vernon|John Vernon]], is the Chief Executive Officer of [[WESAYSO]] on the sitcom ''[[Dinosaurs]]''. He is notable for being the only dinosaur who has higher control over WESAYSO than [[Bradley P. Richfield|B.P. Richfield]]. Richfield is in the same rank as that of another WESAYSO worker who was killed for disapproval by Mr. Ashland.

He appeared in "[[Power Erupts]]", proving that there are in fact dinosaurs even eviler than B.P. Richfield. Ashland summons Richfield, who kowtows before his superior, to discuss the corporation's strategy regarding [[Robbie Sinclair|Robbie Sinclair's]] free-energy concept. Ashland detests butt-kissers, mounting their heads on his wall, and keeps a pet lawyer, [[Elliot (Dinosaurs)|Elliot]], in a box on his desk.

His ambitions are even eviler than Richfield's. He believes that WESAYSO must gain their advantage by unfair cruelty to others, regardless of whom.
