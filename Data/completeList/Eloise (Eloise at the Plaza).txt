'''Eloise''' is a character based on the books by Kay Thompson from the films: ''[[Eloise at the Plaza]]'' and ''[[Eloise at Christmastime]]''. She is a 6-year-old girl who, is sometimes very mischievous.

==Background==
Eloise has two pets, a pug named Weenie, and a turtle named Skipperdee. In ''[[Eloise at Christmastime]]'', Skipperdee lies on a record player, spinning, while Weenie wakes up in his little bed, wearing a Santa hat and beard. Then Eloise meets Rachel, Mr. Peabody's daughter, and is deeply befriended. Nanny often tells her off for being "rude, rude, rude", but she does not care.

===Personality===
At times, Eloise can be sarcastic and serious, but she has a reluctant sense of humor when she does something "rude, rude, rude". Nanny sometimes says something three times, as though sometimes Eloise does not understand. She also has a mind of creativity, such as to her room.
