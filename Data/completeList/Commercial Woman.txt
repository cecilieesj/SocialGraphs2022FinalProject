The Commercial Woman first appears in the first episode, set during the 1950, in black and white. She stands in front of the Toast Mate 2000, by Stark Industries, while the Commercial Man advertises it. She comments on its shine, and demonstrates how its used, while the Commercial Man narrates. As the toaster begins beeping, she briefly looks down at it, then returns her gaze to the camera. When the toast comes out, she takes it out, and moves them onto a plate.

In the second episode, which takes place in the 1960s era, and is also in black and white, The Commercial Woman stands besides the Commercial Man, both of them formally dressed, and the two leave the room, arm in arm, which takes place in an advertisement for Str√ºcker watch.

The third episode takes place in the 1970s, and now in color. The Commercial Boy and Girl accidentally throw a soccer ball on the table, while the Commercial Woman is eating, and the cereal splashes around her. The next scene features the dog peeing, and the Commercial Woman frantically running towards it. The third scene features the Commercial Woman taking out her burnt dish from the oven, and her daughter apologizing, and the fourth shows her blender, overflowing, as it's turned on, causing a mess. All four scenes are presented in a collage, and as the Commercial Woman looks at it, the Narrator asks if she needs a break. She tells him, he read her mind, and the next scenes shows her in bathing in a tub, surrounded by bubbles, while she's being fanned by the Commercial Man, in an advertisement for Hydra Soap.

The fifth episode takes place in the 1980s. When the Commercial Girl accidentally spills a red drink on the table, the Commercial Woman rushes to clean it up, but the drink soaks through the paper towel. The advert then pans to the Lagos paper towel, and the Commercial Woman shows a side-by-side comparison, of the advertised paper towels, alongside regular ones, to demonstrate their efficiency. When the Commercial Man accidentally spills some, she gives the paper towel to him, rather than cleaning it herself.

The seventh episode takes place in the late 2000s/early 2010s, advertising Nexus Capsules. The Commercial Woman sits alone on a bench in the park, on a dreary and cloudy day. She stand up and looks at the sky, as a storm begins to gather, and falls into her bed. She begins to walk up vertically, and arrives at the pharmacy where the Doctor gives her Nexus Capsules. She exits the premises, happy.
