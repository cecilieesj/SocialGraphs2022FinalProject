'''Ceratosaurus''', meaning "Horned Lizard" in reference to the large bony protrusion on its nose, was a medium-sized theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
Three Ceratosaurus made an appearance near of the end of the segment, attacking a group of Brontosaurus and [[Stegosaurus]] trapped in the mud pit, likely with the intention of eating them. One Ceratosaurus made a cameo walking with a [[Parasaurolophus]] after the [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] collapsed of dehydration. It was one of many starving and dehydrated at the end of the scene, forced to extinction by the endless drought.

=== ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' ===
In "[[Land Before Swine]]", a ''Ceratosaurus'' is visible as one of the dinosaurs trapped in fossilized resin. 

==Trivia==
*The Ceratosaurs seen in ''[[Fantasia]]'' strangely did not have any teeth (though they may have been too small to be visibly seen). They also did not have horns over their eyes like the real ''Ceratosaurus''.
*Ceratosaurus was a distant relative of [[Carnotaurus]], as they shared a common ancestor and they are both members of a group called Ceratosauria.
*Ceratosaurus is known from both [[North America]] and Portugal in the Morrison and Lourinha formations, respectively.
*Stegosaurus and Ceratosaurus, having lived at the same time and in the same place during the Jurassic, were natural enemies.
*Ceratosaurus is believed by some to have been an excellent swimmer, thanks to its strong tail.
