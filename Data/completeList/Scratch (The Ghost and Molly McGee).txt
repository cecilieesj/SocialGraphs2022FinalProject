'''Scratch''' is the deuteragonist of the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''.

==Background==
===Appearance ===
Scratch is a light blue ghost, he has green teeth, a huge light blue nose, yellow eyes with small black pupils, and wrinkles.

===Personality ===
Scratch is described as a grumpy ghost whose joy comes from spreading misery. When one of his spells backfired, he finds himself forever cursed in [[Molly McGee|Molly's]] presence (as long as she stays in Brighton), to his immediate displeasure. 

Scratch is is very rude, obnoxious, crude, self serving, and disgusting. Despite his unpleasant traits he does have a caring side and even though he was clearly disturbed at Molly's presence Scratch has slowly started to care about the young human girl.

He enjoys most kinds of foods (sometimes from the trash) that includes pizza, tacos, strawberry soda, poisonous berries, popcorn, cake, ice cream, Khanom bueang, rice balls, roti, squid chips, candy, cookies, coconut Yim-Yums, marshmallows, and most especially deep fried food like donuts, jelly donuts, sufganiyot, hash browns, latkas, churros, corn dogs, french fries, empanadas, egg rolls, fritatas, fish and chips, chicken strips, drumsticks, hush puppies, and crudit√©s; though some others like carob (he has a massive intolerance to it), protein bars, the smell of durian, turnips, and raisins can turn him off.

==Powers and Abilities==
Scratch possesses several powers commonly associated with ghosts:
*'''Levitation:''' He can fly and hover off the ground.
*'''Telekinesis:''' He can move people and objects without touching them. Upon meeting Molly for the first time, he used this ability to force her to leave his attic.
*'''Intangibility:''' He can move through solid objects.
*'''Invisibility:''' He can render himself invisible to others, allowing him to stay undetected by everyone except for Molly, her family, and Libby. However, he remains visible to animals.
*'''Shapeshifting:''' Being made of ectoplasm, he can manipulate his body into any shape he desires. He mainly uses this ability to appear scarier and can turn into a fully functioning human leg. 
**'''Elasticity:''' His body and limbs can be stretched seemingly without limit. Molly exploits this by using his arm to pull him towards her.
*'''Regeneration:''' His body is made of a seemingly limitless supply of ectoplasmic goo. This is first seen when he angrily covered Molly and her family in ectoplasm, showing no ill effects afterwards.
*'''Curse inducement:''' He can curse anyone to be haunted by him for an eternity. However, it has the opposite effect on Molly, who sees it as an opportunity to have an eternal best friend.
*'''Possession/Overshadowing:''' He can possess and control people and inanimate objects to varying degrees. On Molly's first day at school, he possessed Andrea Davenport to convince the other students to accept Molly and Libby Stein-Torres and not bully them. Later, he took control of the Lemmings' equipment to help them win the state championship.
*'''Invulnerability:''' As he is already deceased, poisonous substances have no effect on him. On Molly's camping trip, he consumed several poison berries with no harmful effects. However, he can be vulnerable to certain physical dangers such as animal attacks, fire, electric fences, hot oil, and attacks from other ghosts.
*'''Portal creation:''' He can create and travel through portals to the ghost world and back.
*'''4th Wall Awareness:''' Scratch is somewhat aware he is a fictional character. He attempted to personally rewind the online video the intro song was being played on, without success. He also reacts to several verses in several other songs in the series that he appears in.

== Trivia==
*According the series bible, Scratch does not remember what his life was before becoming a ghost, but he assumes that it was no different from what it was now; implying that he was a bit of hermit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TGAMMwriters/status/1516454203165745161|title=Twitter Bible Post|website=Twitter|date=April 19, 2022}}</ref>
