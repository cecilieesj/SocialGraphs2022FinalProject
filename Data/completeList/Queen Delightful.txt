==Background==
Queen Delightful doesn't seem to follow normal royal standards, or simply doesn't know them, as she usually employs [[Lord Starchbottom]], her assistant, to inform her of royal events or meeting arrangements. She seems to have more faith in the 7D to save the kingdom than Starchbottom, despite his insistence that he can save the day.

===Physical Description===
The Queen is tall and slender, with light blonde hair, red lipstick, and light blue diamond earrings. She wears a red and pink dress with golden cuffs at the sleeves, a golden belt, and has been shown to wear pink shoes that look like sneakers.

===Personality===
The Queen is always happy, gullible and even if there's an emergency. In the times she does get worried, it would only be regarding the safety of her dog Sir Yipsalot. She is extremely kind and quirky leader, and often makes public appearances in her kingdom.

She is also known to be be quite naive and goofy. Her crown can light up in a manner similar to a police car strobe light and she would imitate a siren when she goes on a "tizzy", as Lord Starchbottom puts it.
