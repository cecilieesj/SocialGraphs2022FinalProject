==Background==

=== Personality ===
The wiry, indignant and off-kilter leader of his clan, Lord Macintosh is always a heartbeat away from hysterics. His savage smile and fierce appearance – body bedecked in blue war paint and chest pridefully puffed up – proclaim that he’s ready for battle at any moment, though his bark may be worse than his bite.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=90213 Exclusive Character Art From Pixar's ''Brave'']</ref>

==Trivia==

*The painted blue motifs Lord Macintosh bears follow a Pictish tradition. They were supposed to give protection from sword blades in battle, or strength against enemies. [[Mark Andrews]] said by making this they wanted to give a mark of respect to the ancestors of the Scots.<ref>[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/04/02/brave-pixar-first-look-character-posters/3/ Pixar's 'Brave': Inside look at movie's characters -- EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS]</ref>
*Macintosh's name might be an allusion to [[Apple, Inc.|Apple's]] personal computers, also named Macintosh.
