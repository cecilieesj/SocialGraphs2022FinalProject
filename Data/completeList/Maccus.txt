'''Maccus''' is a character in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]].

==Background==

===Personality===
Maccus serves as one of [[Davy Jones]]' loyal henchmen. Initially, when Davy Jones planned to summon the [[Kraken]], he shows a sinister, evil smile to show his nature during his duty as a ''Dutchman'' crew member. During battle at the maelstrom, Maccus showed a grudge against Will Turner and even attempted to kill him. After the battle at the maelstrom stops and the crew reforms (causing all the crew to lose their aquatic creatures characteristics), Maccus became loyal to Will as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''.

===Physical appearance===
As with many other members of the ''Flying Dutchman'', Maccus is shown with the characteristics of aquatic flora, specifically with the characteristics of a hammerhead shark with sharp fang-like teeth. Also during his duty as a ''Dutchman'' crew member, his body was covered in barnacles, coral, and other aquatic fauna.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' with help from [[Tia Dalma]], Maccus is introduced as the first mate of the ''Dutchman'' alerting his master [[Davy Jones]] who tells [[Will Turner]] if he fears dangers, trying to offer the crew a trap. When Jones asks Will about what his purpose is, he explains that [[Jack Sparrow]] sent him to settle his debt just as Jones and the crew corner Jack Sparrow who is to have his debt paid to the ''Dutchman'' just as Jones explains that Jack has a three-day deadline to complete the bargain of one-hundred souls to which Jack accepts his offer while Jones allows the crew to leave just as Jack has ninety-nine more souls left to harvest before the deadline.

Maccus and the rest of the crew later heave together to get the cannons ready on the ship. During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Maccus plays the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.

The next day, Maccus and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Just as the Kraken destroys most of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', Maccus finds out that Jack Sparrow must have been claimed by the sea to which Jones denies telling him that he himself is the sea. As the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Maccus and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Just as Maccus and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Maccus and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. Successfully opening the chest containing the Heart of Davy Jones, Maccus and the crew fight against Jack's crew just as Jack and his crew plan to escape from the crew and return to the ''Black Pearl''. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones tells Maccus to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Maccus tells his master that not even Jack can defeat the Kraken just as Davy Jones and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Maccus returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, it is possible Maccus and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Maccus and the other crew react in shock just as he gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Maccus and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men to which during battle, he approaches Will Turner holding Dead Man's Chest just as [[Pintel and Ragetti]] launch [[Jack the Monkey]] to tackle him in order to help Will, to which he thanks the monkey for helping him.

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Maccus and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
In the [[Shanghai Disneyland]] attraction [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]], an animatronic Maccus can be seen popping out of a pile of treasure while snarling, "The Captain be wantin' a word with ye!", just before guests pass through an animatronic Davy Jones playing his organ. He is later heard alerting Davy Jones that Jack stole his treasure.
