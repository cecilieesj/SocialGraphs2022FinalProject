'''Wilson Matua''' is a character from the attraction [[Kilimanjaro Safaris]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
During the 1990s-2000s, Wilson Matua was a resident of the East African port of [[Harambe]].  An environmentalist, Matua worked as warden of the Harambe Wildlife Reserve.  Matua worked in partnership with the company ''Kilimanjaro Safaris'' and the ''[[Wilderness Explorers]]'' to help gain awareness and support for the reserve.  A skilled airplane pilot, Matua often patrolled the land in an aircraft as a means of watching out for poachers.

=== Development history ===
Wilson Matua was a prominently featured character in the original incarnation of Kilimanjaro Safaris.  A darker version of the attraction, the original Kilimanjaro Safaris featured a narrative that revolved around guests helping Matua track down poachers who killed the elephant Big Red and kidnapped her baby Little Red.  Wilson hosted the pre-show videos and also communicated with the jeep driver during the attraction's narrative.

Elements of this darker narrative have been progressively removed over the years.  As a result, few referenced to Wilson Matua remain in the parks.

== Appearances ==

=== Kilimanjaro Safaris ===
Wilson Matua used to host the pre-show video and communicate to guests on the attraction.  His outpost is still visible at the end of the ride.

=== [[Skipper Canteen]] ===
In the Skipper Canteen there is a book titled, "The Harambe Chronicles" by Wilson.  While this is a clear reference to Warden Matua, given how the setting of this attraction is c. [[1938]] and how Wilson is a first-name, not a surname, it is likely that this is just an easter-egg.

=== [[Wilderness Explorers (Animal Kingdom)|Wilderness Explorers]] ===
In this attraction, the ''African Culture Badge'' is earned by going to Wilson Matua's home.  The Wilderness Explorers handbook refers to him as, "'''The Warden'''" and Wilderness Explorers agents are active outside this area.

== Trivia ==

* Matua is similar to the character of [[Dr. Helen Marsh]] from [[Dinosaur (attraction)|DINOSAUR]].  This is as both are leaders of institutions which serve as the backdrop for attractions in Disney's Animal Kingdom.  Furthermore, both only appear in the pre-show videos and are the superiors to the attraction's guides.
*Wilson's name is likely a tribute to American ecologist, environmentalist and author [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson Edward Osborne Wilson] ([[1929]]-present day).  It is possible that ''The Harambe Chronicles'' by Wilson in the Skipper Canteen are also a tribute to this.
