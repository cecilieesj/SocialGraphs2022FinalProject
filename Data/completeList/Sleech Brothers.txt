Smart twin brothers, both of whom have light blue skin. [[Doug Funnie|Doug]] looks to them for help whenever needed.

They are each shown to have a crush on [[Judy Funnie|Judy]]. The two try to hide the fact that their father is not as intelligent as them and is a hardworking doughnut baker. They respect [[Skeeter Valentine]] for his intelligence.
