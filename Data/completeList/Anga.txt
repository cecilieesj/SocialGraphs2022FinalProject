==Role in the series==

==="[[Fire from the Sky]]"===
When the Lion Guard can't figure out who is behind all the fire falling from the sky due to Ono explaining that egrets like him cannot fly that high to figure out, Beshte gets his friend Anga to help them. Anga spots the vultures and shoos them away. She reports back to the guard and Kion thinks that they should get all the birds to help. Ono says that they should get Hadithi to help too, Anga goes with Ono to get Hadithi.

The Lion Guard and Anga locate Hadithi talking to a flock of birds and Anga is very excited to meet him; Ono tells him that the Pride Lands needs his help so the three birds fly off. Hadithi and Kion ask the other birds for their help until Ono spots the vultures. Kion gives his order and all the birds fly off to stop the vultures from taking over Maumivu Thorn Patch. While fighting the vultures, Anga becomes wounded during the fight; Ono grabs her and tries to lift her, but she is too heavy for him. Hadithi swoops in underneath her but is attacked by the vultures himself. He falls to the ground, and Ono is able to slow Anga's descent. Although trapped in a thorn bush, Hadithi is otherwise safe and manages to get himself out of the thorns.

Yuki also praises Anga for being a gentle eagle.

==="[[Marsh of Mystery]]"===
Anga and the rest of the guard look for Makini and Ono while the rest of the Lion Guard is attacked by a pack of territorial mongooses. Later while on their way to find the next stone, Anga then warns Bunga not to follow the glowing lights as they can lead them to becoming lost just like what Makini and Ono were following the lights. In fact, she picks him up with her feet and refuses to let him go when he spots snails, even when he bribes to share them with her.

==="[[Dragon Island]]"===
After meeting a dolphin named [[Lumba-Lumba]], the Lion Guard encounters a vicious Komodo dragon named [[Ora]] while Anga, Makini, and Ono are on their way to a moja kwa moja stone pointing to the next landmark while finding Tuliza.

However, Kion then realizes that he should leave the flamingos alone so that they can relax in the sea.

==="[[Friends to the End (The Lion Guard)|Friends to the End]]"===
When Bunga thinks that Kion has been turning evil and his friends tell him that won't happen, Anga soon finds Kion hanging from a tree branch after she and the rest of the Guard sing about the good moments they had with Kion before he received a scar on his face during the final battle. She tries to reach for him but can't due to the height of the cliff below her. They soon get [[Yun Mibu]] to help out.

==="[[The Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|The Tree of Life]]"===

While trying to arrive to the Tree, Anga and the rest of the Guard are confronted by the Night Pride (a different pride of lions as their name suggests) led by an adolescent lioness named Rani. After Kion apologizes to Rani for using the roar against [[Baliyo]], Anga and the rest of the Guard are finally welcomed to the Tree of Life.

==="[[The River of Patience]]"===
The Lion Guard finally arrives at the Tree of Life. Inside the tree, they meet Rani's grandmother Queen [[Janna]] Kion tells Janna that he and Ono have come to be healed. Seeing that they have the  Mark of the Guard  Janna knows that they're from the Pride Lands. Janna asks Nirmala to take a look at Kion and Ono. Janna explains that while healing Ono will be simple, with his remedy being ready in a few days, Kion's ailments will take both time and patience. Wanting to start right away, Kion is led away by Nirmala to begin his healing. Janna asks Rani to show the rest of the Lion Guard around. Rani soon gives them a tour of the Tree of Life explaining that the Tree of Life is special because it's home to every kind of habitat, allowing a wide variety of animals to live in it. Soon Ullu comes up to Rani and she ends the tour.

The rest of the Lion Guard finds Kion waiting for a log. Realizing there might be trouble, Kion abandons his task and takes the Guard to the pass to help. The Lion Guard arrives at the pass in a rush and, unable to stop, collides with the Night Pride. Rani informs them the villains have been defeated already, pointing they're good at protecting the Tree of Life. When the Night Pride begins describing the invaders, the Lion Guard recognizes them as Makucha's Army, quickly realizing they must have followed them to the Tree of Life. Kion tries to apologize, though the revelation angers Rani greatly.

Later on, Kion complains to the rest of the Guard, not seeing how falling in a river will heal him and his scar. Touched by his friend's faith in him, Kion agrees to try again tomorrow. The next day Makucha's Army soon comes and attacks the Night Pride. The Lion Guard comes to help and both teams gather to check on Baliyo, with Nirmala confirming the venom will eventually wear off, much to Rani's relief. Kion spots his flower on the ground and, seeing it got trampled during the fight, begins to tell Nirmala of his failure. However, she tells Kion that getting the flower wasn't the point of the task, noting he still managed to finish it. Bunga and Rani assume this means this Kion has been healed, though Kion doesn't feel too sure, guessing there's still more for him to do. Nirmala agrees with Kion, confirming he has taken the first step and still has a long way to go.

Kion pauses to instinctively paw at his scar for a moment before stopping himself, realizing he doesn't feel pain and agrees he just needs patience. 

==="[[Little Old Ginterbong]]"===
Anga and the rest of the Lion Guard relax with Rani and Baliyo at the Tree of Life. Kion then arrives at the lake, sporting a mud facial that Nirmala says will help treat the venom in his scar. After washing off the mud, Nirmala notes that while Kion is making progress, he still has a long way to go. However, she tells Ono she can now heal '''him''', saying '''his''' remedy is ready. Realizing he will get his eyesight back, Ono gets excited and eagerly follows Nirmala to the Tree of Life to get healed. After they leave, Bunga starts chewing water bugs loudly, annoying Fuli. Baliyo thinks that Bunga chewing is kind of quiet for a honey badger.

Anga and the rest of the Lion Guard makes their way to the Tree of Life to see Ono get healed.  Bunga, though, is still hung up over losing the bug-eating contest to [[Binga]]. Anga's sarcasm inspires Bunga to have a stink contest, leaving the others to find Binga. Inside the Tree, Ono gets healed by Queen Janna. Ono is excited to see everyone accept his vision isn't what it used to be. When Ono doesn't see Bunga he questions where he is. Beshte says that Bunga is with Binga and Ono goes to see him. The guard meets Binga and Fuli is shocked that Binga is the friend that wins every contest.

The next day, Anga and the rest of the Lion Guard are seen resting except for Bunga. Ullu wakes them up and asks them to come help fight Makucha's Army. Anga quickly spots Mama Binturong calling for help, saying Chuluun is attacking her. Though Anga reports not seeing Chuluun, Fuli believes she must have hidden in the snow. As the Guard moves in to help, Ono stops as he wonders how exactly would "Granny Ginterbong" know Chuluun's name. Thinking it over, Ono stops the Guard as he realizes it's a trap as "Ginterbong" is in fact "Mama Binturong". Going over the clues he's picked up all, Ono realizes that Mama Binturong is working with Makcuha. Flying overhead, Anga spots the Army making their way to the Tree of Life, proving Ono right as Kion thanks him for his insight.

Kion tells Ullu to warn Rani that "Granny Ginterbong" is a decoy, while he and the rest of the Guard face off against the Army. At the Tree of Life, Rani approaches Ono, having been told by Ullu that he was the one who figured out Mama Binturong's plan. Ono mentions that, even if his vision may not be what it once was, he still wants to help as Rani to thank him. Kion agrees with Rani, saying that even if Ono isn't the Keenest of Sight, he is still the Keenest of Sight. Ono glances at the Mark of the Guard on his shoulder before looking up at his friends with gratitude, finally coming to terms with his self-worth and his role as the Smartest, as Kion declares Ono will always be a part of the Lion Guard.

==="[[Poa the Destroyer]]"===
Beshte and Anga are seen at the lake watching Ono fly. Ono asks Anga to come with him and see what they can see around the Tree of Life.

The Lion Guard and the Night Pride are seen outside the Tree, where Beshte learns all the animals fear him. Rani lists to Beshte all the damage that he caused, explaining he is now being called "Poa the Destroyer". Ashamed and guilt-ridden, Beshte agrees that he is a destroyer and walks way, looking for a place where he can't scare anyone or destroy anything.

Bunga is left confused by it all, noting that everyone always likes Beshte. Hearing this, Ono comes up with a way to help Beshte. He proposes they give the animals a chance to know Beshte, believing they'll like him once they get to know him. Thanking Ono for his insight, Kion and Rani devise a plan: both teams will split, lure the animals to the Tree, and then bring Beshte afterward, allowing them to meet him all over again. Confident that their plan will work, Kion thanks Rani for her help, though she only states that she is just doing her job as both stare at each other warmly.

Bunga and [[Baliyo]] arrive with [[Tangaagim]] and the penguins, apologizing for being late. When Rani then notices [[Pinguino]] isn't with them, Baliyo explains that he refused to come. Noting Pinguino was the one who made the biggest fuss over Beshte, Rani stresses that he needs to be present. Kion sends Anga to find Pinguino and Beshte, who quickly returns saying she's found them both. Beshte and Pinguino soon arrive at the Tree of Life, both singing the "Poa" song as Pinguino rides Besthe's back. This surprises the other animals, who wonder why Pinguino is with "Poa the Destroyer".

Pinguino then reveals that Beshte saved his life, calling him "Poa the Life Saver". Now convinced of Beshte, the animals ask Pinguino what happened to him, with the penguin explaining how Beshte rescued him after he fell from a cliff. Hearing this, Tangaagim apologizes to Beshte for having doubted him, asking him to save his life one day. Climbing on top of Beshte, Pinguino tells the animals to cheer for "Poa", with all of the animals chanting the name over and over. Bunga points Beshte that the animals are still calling him Poa, though Beshte is fine with the name, now thinking it to be "Poa".

==="[[Long Live the Queen]]"===
As Makucha's Army is attacking a family of tigers, Kion, the Lion Guard and the Night Pride comes to their rescue. After Makucha's army is dealt with, Ullu appears telling Rani and the Night Pride that Queen Janna wants to see them along with Kion. At the funeral, the rest of the guard tries to cheer up Baliyo by saying how great his grandmother was just as Anga also gives her condolence to Janna. Afterwards, all the other animals prepare for Rani's coronation. Fuli, Nirmala, and Anga sing a song about the new queen as the other animals cheer for her.

==="[[The Lake of Reflection]]"===
Anga and Fuli try to cheer up Kion when he thinks that he shouldn't lead the guard anymore, Anga soon remembers a flashback when the guard was a lot younger. Anga remembers seeing Kion and Bunga in the middle of a race to the watering hole, with Bunga saying the winner is a rotten egg when they were young. Though Bunga wins the race, Beshte emerges from the water, saying he got there first, thereby making him the rotten egg. Bunga is okay with this, noting he still smells like one. Suddenly, Fuli runs up to Kion, saying a hyena is in the Pride Lands stealing an egg. Beshte suggests getting Simba for help, but Kion says they don't have time to get his dad. Realizing it's up to them to save the egg, the group starts running while Anga follows.

The hyena is then revealed to be a young Janja who is seen rolling the egg back to the Outlands. Kion and his friends stop the hyenas and the egg hatches. Inside the egg was a younger Ono who said his first words "Hapana!".

Soon, Makucha's Army attacks and they get stopped under Kion's command. Rani notices that Kion can lead after all.

===[[Triumph of the Roar]]===
At dawn, Makcuha's Army is seen attacking the Night Pride when the Lion Guard comes to help. Nirmala says that Kion is healed and the guard wonders if they can go home. Kion says that they need help the Night Pride. Anga then notices Makcuha's Army then attacking again she goes to get Kion, Bunga, and Rani. Coming to the rescue, Kion uses his Roar of the Elders to blast the villains away and also creates a tornado to send all the villains far away to never be seen again. Baliyo is disappointed that they didn't get to see more of Kion's Roar to which Rani asks if Kion and his friends can stick around.

==="[[Journey to the Pride Lands]]"===
Anga and the Guard ask Kion if he's ready to leave the Tree of Life since he's healed and villains of Makucha's army are gone. Kion says that Rani has become such a good friend and is tempting to stay. Soon, Ullu spots a cheetah making his way to the Tree of Life. The cheetah happens to be [[Azaad]] who Fuli met before. Azaad brings Jasiri and Janja to the Tree of Life. They warn the guard that [[Zira]] has returned and [[Kovu]] and [[Vitani]] has fully grown. Rani says goodbye to the guard and thanks them for helping her defend the Tree of Life. Azaad shows the guard the fastest way back home. During the journey, Kion uses the Roar in many different ways. Upon arriving at the Great Stone Wall, Anga notices a leak coming out of it due to Kion's plan of going around. Anga, Jasiri, Janja, and Bunga work together to fix the wall. They soon reach the Outlands and as the animals plan to stop Zira from ruling the Pride Lands.

===[[Return to the Pride Lands]]===
When the Anga and the rest of the Guard returns to the Outlands on their way back to the Pride Lands, they find out that Zira has completed her journey through the Circle of Life (revealing that this episode takes place after ''Simba's Pride'' since Zira died). Kion also finds out that Vitani and a group of lionesses has made her own Lion Guard. Back at the Pride Lands, Anga flies happily with Hadithi who is happy to have Anga back at the Pride Lands. The next day Kion and Vitani's teams have a contest to see which Lion Guard is better. During the competition to see who has keener eyesight, Anga competes with Tazama by trying to find a Galego in a cave but has trouble navigating her way through the dark. 

Later on when both Lion Guards have a tie, Vitani calls for a Mashindano. Kion gives his leadership role to Vitani. Then, [[Askari]] comes and says that there's another place that needs the Roar. Kion asks his friends if they want to join him and become protectors of the Tree of Life. They all agree and immediately receive the [[Mark of the Night Pride]]. After returning, Kion becomes the King of the Tree of Life and marries Rani in which Anga is seen among the other animals attending Kion and Rani's marriage.
