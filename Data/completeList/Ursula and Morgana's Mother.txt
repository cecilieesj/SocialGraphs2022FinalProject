'''Ursula and Morgana's mother''' is a minor character, who is only briefly mentioned in ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''===
Ursula and Morgana's mother is briefly mentioned. It is said that she favored [[Ursula]] more than [[Morgana]], her other daughter, who always sought her approval. She was given a slightly expanded role in the Special Edition, when Morgana elaborates on her motives and backstory ("[[Gonna Get My Wish]]").

==Trivia==
*It is mentioned she loved Ursula more than Morgana, possibly due to the fact that Ursula was better at [[magic]].
*The family portrait listed "first place", implying that her family won some sort of competition.
*The existence of Ursula and Morgana's mother indicates that the deleted scene of Triton being Ursula's brother was rendered non-canon with ''Return to the Sea'', due to their mother being an [[Octopid]] instead of a [[Merpeople|mermaid]].
*In the ''[[Descendants]]'' franchise, she has a granddaughter named [[Uma]].
