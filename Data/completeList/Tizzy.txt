|quote= "Fairy Godmother at your service."<br>"Poof!"}}'''Tizzy''' is a character who appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[In a Tizzy]]". She is [[Ruby Hanshaw|Ruby]]'s over-eager Fairy Godmother who wanted to earn her wings and the only way she could do that is to make someone's dreams come true. Unfortunately for her, making people's dreams come true was difficult as all her attempts ended in disaster, mainly because she kept overdoing it with the magical assistance.

==Role in the Series==
Due to being over-eager and over-supportive, her attempts to help make people's dreams come true always ended in disaster making her chance of earning her own wings impossible. Before meeting Ruby, she was the Fairy Godmother to a Skier and then to a Ballerina. She tried her best to help them make their dreams come true but because of her over-assistance, both of her previous Godchildren ended up humiliated and hurt.

Tizzy was in the woods crying when she first met Ruby and after telling her how difficult it has been for her, Ruby asked her if she could help her with her dream of winning the Dinwiddie Pedal Power race which she happily accepted. Using her magic, she recreated Ruby's Go-Carriage to the way she imagined it and began helping her practice, to Jade's disapproval. Unfortunately, she once again became over-supportive, using her magic to help Ruby with almost everything and not letting her do things by herself.

On the day of the big race, Tizzy cast a spell on the pedals of Ruby's Go-Carriage so they would move all by themselves, to Sofia's disapproval. But, because of her enchantment, Ruby's Go-Carriage went out of control and crashed into a barn. After the accident, Sofia told Tizzy to stop helping Ruby because what she was doing was making her cheat. So to really help Ruby, Tizzy used her magic to restart the race and this time let Ruby race all by herself with her support. When Ruby won, Tizzy finally succeeded in making someone's dream come true and earned her wings.

Tizzy appeared in "[[The Birthday Wish]]" in her second major role after Sofia's birthday turns out horribly due to a series of unfortunate disasters. After showing up late to the party due to not knowing what gift to bring, Tizzy learns about the ruined party from Ruby. Overhearing Sofia's wish to redo her birthday, Tizzy casts a spell that causes Sofia to relive her birthday. Due to Tizzy failing to read the full details of the spell, this ends up trapping Sofia in a time loop as the spell requires Sofia to have a truly happy birthday before it can be broken. Sofia makes multiple attempts to avoid all the problems on her birthday, ending up exhausted after living through thirty-seven repeats and is disappointed when the final attempt does not work despite anything going wrong. Eventually, Sofia realizes that she can only be truly happy by accepting the accidents and looking on the bright side of things. This causes time to finally proceed, and Tizzy looks over Sofia under a rainy sky.
