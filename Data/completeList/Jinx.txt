'''Jinx''' is a minor turned main antagonist who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. She is a Joy Hunter who works for [[The Ghost Council]] and who comes into conflict with [[Molly McGee]] and [[Scratch (The Ghost and Molly McGee)|Scratch]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Jinx, as the Ghost Council put it, is a ruthless Joy Hunter. She speaks fast and is highly confident in her abilities and checks everything to make sure she is astute in her job. When things do not go her way, she will become ferocious, angry and terrifying and will stop at nothing to complete her goal. Despite this, Jinx is not incapable of fear, as she was genuinely horrified when [[Molly McGee]] easily killed [[The Chairman]] with a single touch using her joy, and didn't even try to stop her from leaving with Scratch.

===Physical appearance===
Jinx is thin and purple with a noticeably big hairstyle. Like the other ghosts, she has yellow eyes with black lining. She does possess eyelashes and her eyelids are blue. Additionally, she has a big pink nose and purple lipstick on.

===Powers and abilities===
Jinx possesses several powers commonly associated with ghosts:
* '''Levitation:''' She can fly and hover off the ground.
* '''Intangibility:''' She can move through solid objects.
* '''Invisibility:''' She can render himself invisible to others, allowing him to stay undetected by everyone except for a few.
* '''Shapeshifting:''' Being made of ectoplasm, she can manipulate her body into any shape she desires. She mainly uses this ability to appear scarier.
* '''Invulnerability:''' As she is already deceased, Jinx is practically immune to all forms of bodily harm.
* '''Portal creation:''' She can create and travel through portals to the ghost world and back.
* '''Giant Scythe:''' Jinx possesses a giant scythe which is apparently capable of harming humans, or more specifically, killing them.

==Trivia==
*Jinx is, of course, named after the superstition of bad luck, which is befitting for her job.
