'''King Gregor''' is a character from the animated television series ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==History==
The King of [[Dunwyn Castle|Castle Dunwyn]]. He is a good king who cares greatly about the problems of his people. He protects them from villains like [[Duke Igthorn]], and takes great charge in battle. 

His pride and joy is his daughter, [[Calla]], whom he would do anything for. This later includes considerable respect for her fighting skills as a warrior when he experienced them first hand as secretly part of a series of trials. In doing so, he was deeply impressed at how formidable Calla has become.

His one major weakness is a penchant for prideful tall tales, predominately about hunting, that he shared with Sir Tuxford. When warned about a large wild boar on the loose, those two decided to hunt it with Cavin with them. That exercise in bravado promptly ends that the warnings about the extreme size of the beast turned out to be no exaggeration and they flee in terror, confessing to Cavin in hiding that their stories were playful exaggerations. When they were forced to face the dangerous beast and best it for real, no one believed their true story back at Dunwyn.

He is unaware that [[Gummi Bears]] live in Dunwyn, and have helped defend his kingdom, despite actually meeting disguised Gummies on multiple occasions, such as when [[Grammi Gummi|Grammi]] and [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]] tried to warn him of a wild animal, the beast turns on Grammi, causing King Gregor and [[Sir Tuxford]] to have to save Grammi in danger.
