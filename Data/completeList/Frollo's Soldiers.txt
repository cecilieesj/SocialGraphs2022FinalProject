'''Frollo's soldiers''' are the military and law enforcement force of medieval France. They serve as tertiary antagonists in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1996]] animated feature film,Â ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', and later as minor characters and allies to the heroes in [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II|its sequel]]. Two notable members are [[Brutish and Oafish Guard]].

==Appearances==
===''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''===
They first appear arresting a group of gypsies ordered by [[Judge Claude Frollo]], who is their leader.

They also appear twenty years later at the Festival of Fools where two of them start a riot on [[Quasimodo]] who attended the Festival by accident. [[Esmeralda]] helps Quasimodo and puts the torture to a stop. When Esmeralda escapes into Notre Dame, Phoebus follows her but refuses to arrest her having witnessed her kindhearted nature. When Frollo and his soldiers attempt to drag her outside of Notre Dame but were forced to leave by an enraged [[Archdeacon]] who warned Frollo not to touch her and Frollo orders them to guard every door. After Esmeralda escape from Notre Dame, they arrest a group of Gypsies and attempt to murder an innocent family.

Phoebus saves them and they attempt to execute him but the latter is rescued by Esmeralda. Frollo then orders them to burn Paris to the ground and they search everywhere and still no sign of her. At the Court of Miracles, they and Frollo captured [[Clopin]], Esmeralda, [[Djali]], [[Phoebus]], Quasimodo, and a group of gypsies. They also chained Quasimodo on the Belltower to make sure he "stays there". During the execution of Esmeralda, an enraged Quasimodo rescues her after she passes out; two soldiers attempt to stop him but he swings a torch at them knocking them down and yells for Sanctuary. Frollo orders his soldiers to break down the door. Phoebus breaks free from his cage and rallies the citizens of Paris and the French army to attack and free Clopin, Djali, and the other gypsies from their cages. They tried to hold back the mob but were overwhelmed. While the troops struggled with the rioters, Frollo, who had been attempting to murder Quasimodo and Esmeralda, fell to his doom from the cathedral's bell tower.  With the minister dead, there was no more need to enforce his orders and the riot came to a happy end. Afterwards, the guards likely returned to their duties, now enforcing the law under Phoebus. 

===''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]''===
In the sequel, the soldiers are first seen helping Phoebus find Madellaine. Soon they hear a thud on a bell that Victor, Hugo, and Laverne were stuck in at Notre Dame. They rush to the bell tower to find the Archdeacon shouting that Sarousch has stolen La Fidele. Phoebus then tells the soldiers to find Sarousch. Quasimodo then thinks that Madellaine did not care about him and helped Sarousch steal the bell. Phoebus then tells the soldiers to arrest Madellaine. The soldiers soon start a manhunt for Sarousch but they don't find him. They soon tell Phoebus about this and he tells the soldiers to look further. Madellaine then tells them that Sarousch was taking the bell underground. They soon find him. After Madellaine saves Zephyr from Sarousch, the soldiers run to the boat Sarousch was on with La Fidele. They are last seen taking Sarousch to Prison.
