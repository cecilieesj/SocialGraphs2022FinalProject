==History==
===Background===
Scarlett resided in [[Tortuga]] during the Age of Piracy. She and [[Giselle (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Giselle]] were believed to be prostitutes. Scarlett had bright red hair and was typically seen wearing a fiery, red dress with an excessive amount of blush on her face.

===Development History===
Scarlett was based on the [[Redd|redheaded wench]], in the Auction scene of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' attraction]], commonly referred to as the "Redhead". When she was adapted into the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' films, the character was given the name "Scarlett", because of her red hair.

Scarlett had a history with [[Jack Sparrow]], but developed animosity towards him which manifested itself in a slap to the face upon seeing Jack again in [[Tortuga]]. Jack commented that he hadn't deserved the slap, though one from Giselle's moments later was, as he believed, that was justified.

Despite the divide between them, Scarlett and Giselle were often seen in each other's company in Tortuga, and were both approached by [[William Turner Jr.|William Turner]] a year later, during the latter's search for Sparrow, though Scarlett claimed Jack had not been seen for over a month.

Jack was ultimately reunited with Scarlett following his rescue from Davy Jones' Locker and end of the Battle of Calypso's maelstrom, and was again greeted with a slap after admitting he loved neither Scarlett nor Giselle. [[Joshamee Gibbs]] departed with Scarlett and Giselle as Jack set off on his quest to find the [[Fountain of Youth]].
