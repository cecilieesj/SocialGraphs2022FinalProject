== Appearances ==

=== Horizons ===
The robot butler appeared in the, "Looking back at the future" segment of Horizons, a sequence dedicated to retrospectives on the ideas of futurism and innovation from different eras.  The robot butler appears in a scene dedicated to the retro-futurism of the early-mid 20th century where it is one of the robotic servants owned by a human.

=== One Man's Dream ===
One of the original butler audio-animatronics would be relocated to One Man's Dream in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] alongside animatronics of [[Figment]], the [[Dreamfinder]]'s dream-mobile, Mr. Broccoli and an anthropomorphic tomato from [[the Colander Combo]] of [[Kitchen Kabaret]].

=== [[Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom)|Space Mountain]] ===
A different robot appears as the mechanical butler in the post-show sequence of Space Mountain in the [[Magic Kingdom]].  This butler appears in an apartment in the [[Starport Seven-Five|Space Mountain]] offered interstellar tourism destination of Constellation: the city of stars.  The apartment is made to look reminiscent of the, "Looking back at the future" apartment from Horizons and while of a different design and holding out drinks rather than vacuuming, the robot butler is most certainly an allusion to that from Epcot.

== Other Appearances ==

=== [[Tales from Adventureland]] ===
The ''Tales from Adventureland'' book series is based on several [[Disney Parks]] properties and while most are taken from [[Adventureland]], there are references to other attractions such as Horizons.  In the books, the character of [[Shrunken Ned|Colonel Nedley Lostmore]] is the owner of a robot butler named '''Boltenhouse''' which is inspired by the robot butler from Horizons.  In the later books, Ned begins to use Boltenhouse as a mechanical body after he is magically decapitated and turned into an animate shrunken head.
