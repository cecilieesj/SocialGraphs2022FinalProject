'''Jacques the Beaver''' is a beaver who appears infrequently on ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''. He was performed by [[Peter Linz]].

He was first seen in "[[Oops, My Mistake]]." [[Doc Hogg]] heard him calling and mistook him for [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]]. Though he speaks with an accent that sounds somewhat Scottish, he uses French phrases such as "Pardon moi" and "Bonjour!"

He is a recycled version of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Morton_the_Beaver Morton the Beaver] from ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Animal_Show The Animal Show]''.
