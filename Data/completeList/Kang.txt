'''Kang''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who will appear in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]'' and in the second season of the ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' series,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2021/07/loki-director-ep-kate-herron-says-shes-not-returning-for-season-2-1234794552/|title=‘Loki’ Director & EP Kate Herron Says She’s Not Returning For Season 2|website=Deadline|date=[[July 16]], [[2021]]}}</ref> and ''[[Avengers: The Kang Dynasty]]'', played by [[Jonathan Majors]]. A [[Variants|Variant]] of Kang that is called [[He Who Remains]] appears in the first season of the ''Loki'' series.

Kang was created by [[Stan Lee]], Dick Ayers, George Roussos and [[Jack Kirby]]. 

==Background==
{{Quote|Not every version of me was so pure of heart. To some of us, new worlds meant only one thing, new lands to be conquered. The peace between the realities erupted into all-out war, each [[Variants|Variant]] fighting to preserve their universe and annihilate the others.|[[He Who Remains]]|For All Time. Always.}}

In the 31st century, a [[Variants|Variant]] of Kang was a scientist on Earth. He discovered alternate universes, at the same time that other of his Variants did the same, causing the Kang Variants to meet. They shared knowledge and technology, using what they learned from each other to improve the other universes. 

For awhile there was peace, but some of these Variants viewed the universes discovered as new lands to be conquered. This led to the Variants fighting each other for the supremacy of their own universes and trying to eliminate the others in a Multiversal War. The war almost caused the destruction of everything in the multiverse, until one of these Variants found [[Alioth]], a creature formed out of all the tears in reality that is able to consume time and space itself. Another Variant, who later became known as [[He Who Remains]], managed to weaponize Alioth's power and use it to end the war. 

Following the end of the Multiversal War, He Who Remains isolated a collection of realities, reorganizing it into a single "[[Sacred Timeline]]". He Who Remains also created the [[Time Variance Authority]] to protect the proper flow of time by pruning branched timelines and Variants, to assure that the Kang Variants would not be able to dominate the multiverse and start another Multiversal War.

=====Season One=====
{{Quote|You came to kill the devil, right? Well, guess what? I keep you safe. And if you think I'm evil, well, just wait till you meet my [[Variants]].|[[He Who Remains]] to [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] and [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]]|For All Time. Always.}}

In the [[For All Time. Always.|final episode]] of the season, [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] and [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]] arrive at the [[Citadel at the End of Time]] and meet the [[Variants|Variant]] of Kang who rules the [[Time Variance Authority]], [[He Who Remains]]. He tells the two Lokis the story behind the Multiversal War and the creation of the TVA, explaining that the war caused by the Kang Variants almost led to the destruction of all realities of the Multiverse. The war ended after he weaponized [[Alioth]] and eliminated his other Variants, before organizing the [[Sacred Timeline]] and creating the TVA, leading the Multiverse to ages of cosmic harmony.

He Who Remains warns Loki and Sylvie that he is not as evil as the other of his Variants, and that something even worse will take his place if they decide to kill him. He then gives the duo two options: kill him which will unleash an infinite amount of his Variants in the Multiverse, or assume his place as the new rulers of the TVA.

Loki believes in He Who Remains' story. Sylvie, however, is still set on taking revenge on He Who Remains because the TVA destroyed her timeline. She also thinks that everything that the ruler of the TVA told them is just a lie. This leads the couple to a disagreement. While Sylvie wants to kill He Who Remains, Loki wants to rethink their plan to avoid unleashing something worse in the Multiverse. This results in Sylvie using He Who Remains' [[TemPad]] to send Loki back to the TVA, before finally completing her mission by murdering the ruler of the TVA. With the death of He Who Remains, the Sacred Timeline is freed and branches off several times.

At the TVA, after crying for failing to stop Sylvie, Loki decides to warn the others about the Multiversal War. Inside the Archives, Loki finds [[Hunter B-15]] and [[Mobius|Agent Mobius]] checking the great number of new branched timelines on a [[TemPad]]. As the two of them evaluate the damage and realize that they will not be able to prune all these timelines, B-15 wonders if "he" wants them to just let everything branch. Loki tells them that they won't be able to stop the branches, then reveals that he and Sylvie found He Who Remains and freed the timeline. Loki tries to explain that there are countless versions of the same dangerous person coming and they will start a war. To Loki's surprise, neither Mobius nor B-15 recognize him. Looking around, Loki sees that there is a statue of Kang replacing the statues of the [[Time Keepers]], the ones the TVA members believe to be the founders and rulers of the TVA. Loki realizes this is not the TVA he knows, this is a new version of the organization ruled by Kang.
