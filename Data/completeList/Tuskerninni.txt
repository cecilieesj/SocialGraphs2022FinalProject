==Background==
An anthropomorphic walrus, his schemes always revolve around films and filmmaking. He also has a gang of penguin minions who follow him and do his bidding. One interesting characteristic of his is that he usually plays dumb, pretending that he is either reformed or not doing anything wrong, only to reveal his schemes when the heroes are out of his way.

==Trivia==
*By his costume and penguin minions, Tuskerninni is possibly a parody of the Penguin, an enemy of Batman.
*His name is a parody of Italian music conductor Arturo Toscanini.
*[[Aaron Sparrow]] had intended to use Tuskerninni for a ''DuckTales''/''Darkwing Duck'' crossover comic titled "The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck: The Movie". In it, Darkwing would attempt to investigate a [[Scrooge McDuck]] biopic being produced by Tuskerninni, only to be cast as Scrooge when Tuskerninni sees through his disguise.<ref>[https://www.twitter.com/Aaron_Sparrow/status/1129435979062829056 Tweet by Aaron Sparrow]</ref> Unfortunately, since Disney cancelled the comic and has now forbidden Sparrow from writing for the Dynamite Entertainment title,<ref>[https://twitter.com/Aaron_Sparrow/status/1577055638332375040 Tweet by Aaron Sparrow]</ref> the story is unlikely to ever be published.
