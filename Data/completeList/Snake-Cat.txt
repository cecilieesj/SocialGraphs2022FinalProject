}}The '''Snake-Cat''' is a creature featured in the animated television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''.
==History==
Snake-Cats are mutant cuddle buddies that are mixed of cats and snakes. These creatures have long bodies of snakes (huge long ones) and the head of a cat and it shows the snake body has scales and so does the cat head, but the cat has whiskers and it has a forked tongue. This was seen in the episode "[[Downhill]]". [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] was in [[Amy Hall|DNAmy]]'s lair and a cat sees Kim, but Kim turns around and it shows the cat is a Snake-Cat. The Snake-Cat wraps Kim in his body to suffocate her, but Kim and the Snake-Cat both fell into the shelf of cuddle buddies and the Snake-Cat is knocked out or dead. The explosion probably killed the Snake-Cat with the [[Rabbit-Rhino]], Pig-Man, and Chicken-Man, but the plush of cuddle buddies have made it, but they fell in the snow.
