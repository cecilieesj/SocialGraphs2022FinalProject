==Biography==
He pioneered the concept of the Football X-7 in [[1952]], but unfortunately, his creation fails to become a reality, and eventually, he is forced to go into hiding because of his name (including his title of professor) being a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome%7C Palindrome]. After a long hiatus, Football X-7 is successfully built by [[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]]. Professor Ross Eforp appears toward the end of the episode, when he sees Phineas and Ferb's football stadium. He then temporarily comes out of hiding, but goes back because people still do not like Palindromes.
