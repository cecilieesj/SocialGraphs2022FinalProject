==Trivia==
*Two of Tara's love interests have the same initials, "J.M." – Josh Mankey and Jason Morgan.
*Before the fourth season aired on TV, there were rumors that Tara was going to have a bigger role on the show in that season than she did in the first three seasons.
*Her last name was never revealed on the show, but many fans speculate that King is her last name--an allusion to John Steed's third partner Tara King from the British adventure series "The Avengers" (''not'' the Marvel Comics superhero group), while others believe that Tara could be named after her voice actress Tara Strong, since they look alike. There has never been any canon proof to back up '''''any''''' of these theories.
*According to artwork on [[w:c:kimpossible:Talk:Middleton_High_School#From_a_Very_Early_commercial|an early television commercial]] prior to the debut of ''Kim Possible'', Tara's pre-production name was "Cindy".
