==History==
According to legend, each brother held a specific trait that made them unique: the youngest son was said to be wise, the next son was said to be compassionate, the second-eldest son was just, and the eldest, [[Mor'du]], was strong. After their father's death, they agreed to rule the land equally. Unfortunately their oldest brother, Mor'du, felt insulted and desired all of the power for himself. This resulted in war against all four brothers and then the fall of their kingdom. Eventually, Mor'du gathered his brothers at the false promise of peace to the conflict, but then betrayed his brothers when he turned into a bear and murdered them.
