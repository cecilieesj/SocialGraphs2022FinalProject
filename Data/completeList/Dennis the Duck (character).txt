==Trivia==

*Despite being billed as a classic cartoon character, he is in fact not and was a parody of classic cartoon characters created specifically for the ''House of Mouse''.
**He very likely served as a stand-in for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], [[Walt Disney]]'s first ever cartoon star of the 1920s, which was still under ownership of Universal and therefore didn't have the rights to at the time this show came out. Co-incidentally, Disney would successfully regain the rights to use Oswald from Universal for the first time since the 1920s in 2006.
