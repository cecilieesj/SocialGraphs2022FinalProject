'''Little Sister''' is [[Sexton Mouse]]'s wife and a church mouse that lives in a hole in [[Friar Tuck's Church]] in ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''.

==Role in the film==
Little Sister is first seen with Sexton on Friar Tuck's head, cheering for [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]] and [[Maid Marian]]. She is then seen dancing on Friar Tuck's head as everyone present at a dance party makes fun of [[Prince John]].

Next, Little Sister is shown in Friar Tuck's church, sweeping up the little Welcome mat outside the mouse hole, complaining over Prince JohnÂ taxing the heart and soul out of the peasants. Her husband is playing the pipe organ, and Friar Tuck encourages him to play enthusiastically in the hopes all the prisoners can hear it and be heartened by the music. She then gets her (and Sexton's) last farthing (which they both have been saving) from under the mattress of their bed (which is a single shoe) and gives it to Friar Tuck for the poor. As soon as the coin makes a rattle in the collection box, the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] enters the church, Sexton rudely asks what he wants, but Little Sister shushes her husband not to be flippant in front of an authority figure. She then scolds the Sheriff for entering to take the coin for Prince John by telling him to put it back, only for him to say that "His Majesty also blesses [her]". They then watch Friar Tuck and the Sheriff fighting, only for the latter to arrest the former for "high treason to the crown" thanks to Trigger, causing Little Sister to cry into her apron as Sexton is comforting her.

Finally, she and Sexton are seen at the end of the film, where they celebrate newlyweds Robin Hood and Maid Marian by throwing rice down from a window after [[King Richard]] finally returns.
