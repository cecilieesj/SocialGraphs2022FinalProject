The '''Viruses''', also known as the '''Sparks''', are minor antagonists from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue]]''.

==Role in the film==
They appear during the "[[Chomp and Munch]]" sequence as they plague [[Wittgenstein]] by destroying his inner tubes and circuitry while singing the chorus part of the song. When Wittgenstein is later revived by [[Radio]]'s WFC 11-12-55 tube, the viruses automatically get destroyed (though a few remaining ones form the word "Yipe!" before they too are destroyed) and are never seen again throughout the rest of the movie.

==Trivia==
*The viruses are similar to the [[w:c:mario:Virus|Viruses]] from the Nintendo puzzle video game, ''{{WikipediaLink|Dr. Mario}}''.
