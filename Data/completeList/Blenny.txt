'''Blenny'''<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20101221003008/http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2003/05/findingnemo/</ref> is a character who appears in the [[2003]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.

==Background==
Blenny is a small light-green fish. Though he swims in the ocean just like any typical fish, he is shown to be nervous when it comes to predators (such as the case of [[Chum]] who started sticking out various skeleton fish out of his mouth), causing him to swim away in fear.

==Role in the film==
In the film, Blenny is seen in the [[Sharks' Lair]] swimming all by himself and during meeting between [[Bruce]], [[Anchor]], and [[Chum]] while discussing with [[Marlin]] and [[Dory]] and when Bruce tells both of his shark fellows to know if they brought in a fish friend, Anchor shows Blenny to him where he swims around in fear and when Chum explains that he have "misplaced a friend" showing the fish skeletons sticking out of his mouth, Blenny reacts to it in fear and swims out of the submarine to find another place where no big fish can eat him.

Later during the film's post-credits scene, Blenny is seen swimming by himself in the [[Abyssopelagic Zone]] and while swimming, he notices the [[Anglerfish]]'s light approaching him. As Blenny reacts in fear, he notices the Anglerfish attempting to eat him and soon as Blenny approaches it, he suddenly eats it in one bite, consuming the predator. He then swims away offscreen.

===[[The Seas with Nemo & Friends]]===
Blenny is encountered during the scene where [[Marlin]] and [[Dory]] attempt to find [[Nemo]]. In the attraction, Marlin finds Blenny instead of Nemo who was supposed to be in the anemone home he and Marlin are at.

===[[Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage]]===
Blenny can be spotted in the Sharks' Lair scene hiding in a sunken cannon presumably to look for shelter while hiding alone (presumably to escape from predators). He later appears again during the scene the whale sequence being fearful of the whales in the area while Dory is exploring the area where the whales are migrating.

==Trivia==
*Blenny's name has not been mentioned onscreen. His name was revealed in an official Apple Macintosh game adaptation of ''Finding Nemo'' via said game's official site.
*In the console video game adaptation of ''Finding Nemo'', Blenny was originally going to appear in the console version of the game, but was cut in the final version of the game - though his model was present in the game's files. The reason why he was cut in the final version of the console versions of the game is unknown<ref>[https://youtu.be/Z8V7oXl7dr0 Unused models for ''Finding Nemo'' video game].</ref>.
*It is unknown how Blenny is capable of eating fish that are larger than him, despite his diminutive size.
