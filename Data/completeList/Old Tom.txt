'''Old Tom''' is a pirate in ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''. He was performed by [[Jerry Nelson]].

He has a long, uncut beard and wears glasses. He has a background role but is seen hugging [[Angel Marie]] when the pirates discover [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Flint Flint's] treasure. He is defeated when [[Sweetums]] throws a log at him and he was later arrested with the other pirates.

Old Tom also played a member of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Monkeys the Flying Monkeys] motorcycle gang in ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', where he was performed by Tyler Bunch and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Allan_Trautman Allan Trautman].

He later appeared in a [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Haunted_Holidays Haunted Holidays] interstitial on Disney.com, performed by [[Steve Whitmire]], and the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_viral_videos viral video] of "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody Bohemian Rhapsody"].

He later resurfaced in [[Muppets Most Wanted]] on the ice wall at [[Gulag 38B]]. He bears a somewhat striking resemblance to Cousin It fromÂ ''The Addams Family''.

He is not to be confused with [[Old Tim]].
