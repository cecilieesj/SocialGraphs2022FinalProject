'''Ulik''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appeared in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'', and ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. He ambushes Eitri and the Dwarves before they can make it to their forge and ends up fighting them and [[Iron Man]]. Ulik is defeated when Iron Man dislodges the cap on his chest device which knocked Ulik unconscious. Shortly after that, Eitri reattaches the cap to Iron Man's chest device. Later, Ulik travels to Midgard wielding his Codgel weapon and fights [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] and [[Avengers|the Avengers]] in [[New York City]]. The Avengers defeat Ulik but lose the Codgel in the process, which ended up in [[Doctor Doom]]'s possession. Ulik was placed in a special cell at [[Avengers Tower]]. After Doctor Doom and the [[Midgard Serpent]] are defeated, Thor visits Ulik's cell and takes him to [[Asgard]] so that [[Odin Borson|Odin]] can deal with him.
