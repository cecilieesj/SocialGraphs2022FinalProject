{{Quote|Hello, 'dere'! Professor Ludwig Von Drake here. Certified scientist, and all-around expert on brilliant things!|Ludwig Von Drake}}
'''Professor Ludwig Von Drake''' is an anthropomorphic duck created by [[Walt Disney]]. The paternal uncle of [[Donald Duck]]<ref name="drake">{{Cite web|url = https://d23.com/did-you-know-8-genius-facts-about-ludwig-von-drake/|title = DID YOU KNOW? 8 GENIUS FACTS ABOUT LUDWIG VON DRAKE|date = September 22, 2016}}</ref>, he is an eccentric lecturer, scientist, psychiatrist, and self-proclaimed genius, who frequently displays his vast array of "expert" knowledge on a variety of subjects. Von Drake speaks with an Austrian accent and is typically depicted wearing an overcoat and specks, in line with his scholar motif.

Ludwig debuted as a presenter in ''[[An Adventure in Color/Mathmagicland|An Adventure in Color]]'', part of the first episode of ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' on [[September 24]], [[1961]], making him the first [[Disney]] animated character created specifically for television. While conceived as a one-shot character, Von Drake became a breakout star in part for his kinetic animation and voice performance by comedian [[Paul Frees]]. The character proved so popular that he would feature as a spokesperson for the Disney company throughout the latter half of the 20th century by hosting specials, commercials, records, and other media.

==Background==
Von Drake comes from Vienna, Austria, and has a fascination with knowledge. In Ludwig's second animated appearance, "[[The Hunting Instinct]]", Walt Disney explains that Von Drake comes from the paternal side of Donald's family—the Drakes, who are a continental branch and the "eggheads" of the Duck family clan.

Ludwig is described as a scientist, world-traveler and psychiatrist. He has obtained degrees from such universities as Oxford, Cambridge, and Heidelberg, and, in one of his comic strip appearances, Ludwig himself claims that he has obtained "about 98 degrees" in total.<ref>https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=YD+61-10-04</ref> In ''[[Fly with Von Drake]]'', Ludwig claims to have served in the air force in 1917, where he earned himself the dubious nickname of "Ludwig "[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ace Eddie Von Richthofen]" Drake". During his first flight in combat, he shot down five planes--five planes from his own side, that is, with Ludwig remarking that he's been wearing glasses ever since. In ''[[A Symposium on Popular Songs]]'', Von Drake credits himself for the creation of various musical fads including ragtime, the blues, and even rock-and-roll, throughout the 20th century. In “[[In Shape with Von Drake]]”, Von Drake hosts a fitness program under the alias “Ludwig “Muscles” Von Drake”.

While always portrayed as elderly, Von Drake’s specific age is generally left ambiguous. In “[[Carnival Time]]” (aired in [[1962]]), Von Drake claimed that he served as a reporter and announcer for every Carnival in Rio de Janeiro since the event’s inception in 1641, which would make him at least 300 years old by the time of the episode’s premiere.

===Personality===
In spite of being a world-renowned scientist, psychiatrist, and lecturer, Ludwig is incredibly wacky, somewhat bumbling and, as he puts it, "Kooky!". He is often shown as having little social competence, however, and is often portrayed as being very forgetful, sometimes even somewhat senile. During many of his classic lectures, Ludwig would often get sidetracked rather quickly, with the end results being comical shenanigans. He would also sometimes say the wrong thing and then quickly realize what he said and say "What am I saying" before correcting himself.

Regardless, he is normally portrayed as extremely intelligent and more than likely to know nearly everything about a certain topic—ranging from science to music. A notable recurring goal for the professor has been to discover the source of his nephew Donald's temper tantrums, mostly for the sake of Donald's health. Outside of lectures and his studies in psychology, most of the professor's time is spent creating an array of magnificent inventions and therapies meant to make life easier for both himself and the rest of the world. More often than not, however, does one of the professor's creations go off the deep end.

Von Drake is rather pompous as a result of his genius. He prides himself in his intellect, and never hesitates to attempt to convince others of his genius, to the point where he can be somewhat of an egotist. He also has a habit of beginning the name of his inventions with "The Von Drake" heading.

His catchphrase is "Hello, there!", which he often shouts when greeting someone, or at the beginning of one of his cartoons.

===Voice===
{{Quote box|quote=I ad-lib on tape and it’s incorporated into the script. Walt Disney gave me a lot of liberty in portraying the Professor, and I’ve made him more personal than any of my other characters. Originally, Ludwig was a supercilious character but we’ve given him point and shade as we brought him along. His complete knowledge in every avenue helps bring a little culture to TV.
|source=[[Paul Frees]] on voicing Ludwig Von Drake
|width=32%|align=right}}Von Drake's raspy, Austrian-accented voice was originated and provided by [[Paul Frees]], who was also well-known as the voice behind the [[Ghost Host]] in [[Disneyland]]'s ''[[The Haunted Mansion (Disneyland)|The Haunted Mansion]]'' attraction. According to Frees, Walt allowed for a hefty amount of freedom and liberty when it came to shaping Von Drake's personality, as ad-libbing was encouraged, much of which was added to the script.<ref name="drake"/> To achieve Von Drake's fast-paced voice, Paul Frees' recordings were sped up by about five or six percent.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fgKBNNpRwY?t=11m2s</ref>

Following Frees' retirement from acting in the 1980s, Von Drake's distinct voice was provided by [[Walker Edmiston]], who was given Frees' blessing before assuming the role. Eventually, new home video projects came along of which Ludwig was to star. Auditions were held for a new actor to officially take the mantle from Paul Frees, but no one could emulate the voice. [[Corey Burton]] actually turned down the role five times, believing he couldn't possibly pull off the performance. However, the founder of the Disney Character Voices division believed in Burton's talent and worked alongside the actor to recreate Frees' vocal mannerisms.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fgKBNNpRwY?t=10m</ref> Burton eventually assumed the role and has been consistently voicing Von Drake for over three decades.

==History==
===1960-1970===
[[File:Milt kahl von drake sketches.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Von Drake model sheet by Milt Kahl.]]
[[Walt Disney]] entered into television production as early as [[1950]]. By [[1954]], he had his own weekly anthology TV series, called ''Disneyland'', on [[ABC]]. In [[1961]], after a disagreement, Disney changed his loyalties to NBC and added color to the mix and rebranded the show as ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''. While developing the show’s debut episode, story man Bill Berg created rough sketches of a brainy Austrian scientist who would introduce the concept of colored television to the audience. Berg’s sketches were later passed down to animator [[Milt Kahl]], who finalized the design and became the character’s lead animator.<ref name="von"/> In addition to introducing colored television, part of Ludwig Von Drake’s creation was to ensure “a regular stream of new Disney animation on TV.” Seven of Walt Disney’s [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]] were enlisted to animate the character in his debut appearance; these include [[Ollie Johnston]], [[Eric Larson]], [[Ward Kimball]], [[Les Clark]], [[Frank Thomas]], [[John Lounsbery]], and Milt Kahl.<ref name="drake"/>

[[File:1963-goose-06.jpg|thumb|250px|Ludwig as the narrator of ''Mickey and the Beanstalk''.]]
Ludwig Von Drake was introduced in 1961, with the introduction to Walt Disney's television series ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color''. Though he was intended to be a 'one-shot' character, Von Drake proved so popular with audiences that he became a recurring character in Disney's related television projects.<ref name="von"/> Throughout his appearances, Von Drake served as the foremost “expert” of an episode’s dedicated topic—spanning everything from human psychology to music. For most episodes, comedic backstories were created to explain Von Drake’s relationship to the topic, thus giving the character an eclectic history. In total, Von Drake would appear in sixteen episodes of the anthology series, from "[[An Adventure in Color/Mathmagicland]]" in 1961, to "[[A Salute to Alaska]]" in [[1967]]. The latter episode was also the last to feature Walt Disney as its host, as he died months prior. In "[[The Truth About Mother Goose]]", Von Drake appeared as the host and narrator of the ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' short (originally a segment part of the ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' animated compilation). He and Herman replaced the film's original narrators, Edgar Bergen and his ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy, respectively. This version would go on to become the "definitive" version of the short, being used in home video releases and television airings for decades to follow.

[[File:1222a.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Artwork for the Ludwig Von Drake album.]]
Von Drake’s popularity paved the way for various forms of merchandise based on the character—some of which include toys, collectible figurines, books, games, and records. In 1961, the Disneyland Records album ''[[Professor Ludwig Von Drake (album)|Professor Ludwig Von Drake]]'' was released. The album was a mixture of audio commentary and musical performances by Von Drake, as voiced by Paul Frees. The [[Sherman Brothers]] songwriting team—who were prominent at the studio for their contributions to the animated features—wrote several songs for Von Drake, which were included on the comedy album. Some of the most notable of which includes "I'm Ludwig Von Drake” and “[[The Spectrum Song]]”, in addition to a parody version of “[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]” from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''. On the commentary tracks, Ludwig takes listeners behind-the-scenes of record productions. In an irreverent manner, Von Drake claims credit for the creation of the album, with an offhanded reference to Walt Disney (referring to him as ‘Walt Frisbee’). Also in 1961, another album was released titled ''Carnival Time'' (predating the television episode of the same name) which featured two songs from the professor: “I'm Ludwig Von Drake” and “Green With Envy Blue”—both of which appeared in the previous album.

[[File:A_Symposium_on_Popular_Songs_poster.jpg|thumb|250px|Poster featuring Von Drake for ''A Symposium on Popular Songs''.]]
On [[December 19]], [[1962]], Von Drake starred in his only theatrical appearance, a featurette titled ''[[A Symposium on Popular Songs]]'', which focused on Von Drake lecturing about the music of bygone and contemporary decades such as ragtime, the Charleston, blues, love ballads, and rock and roll. The short notably received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film.

===1970-1990===
In the [[1970]]s, Von Drake appeared as the narrator in "[[Nature's Strangest Oddballs]]", and starred in a number of commercials promoting Gulf Gasoline, featuring newly recorded voice acting and animation.

After Ludwig's conclusion from the anthology series, the character would make irregular appearances in various spots, such as "[[Donald Duck's 50th Birthday]]" ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|The Magical World of Disney]]'' broadcast in [[1984]], ''[[Ludwig's Think Tank]]'' in [[1985]], and ''[[Down and Out with Donald Duck]]'' in [[1987]]. Also, in 1986 and 1987, Von Drake co-hosted two ''[[DTV]]'' television specials, ''Disney's DTV Valentine'' (later renamed ''Disney's DTV Romancin<nowiki>'</nowiki>'') and ''Disney's DTV Doggone Valentine'', alongside Mickey and [[Jiminy Cricket]]. The ''Valentine'' special is particularly notable for being one of the very last times that Paul Frees voiced Von Drake before he passed away in November of 1986.

Von Drake would later go on to host of ''[[Disney Sing-Along Songs|Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]'' series of videos, beginning with [[1988]]'s ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: You Can Fly!|You Can Fly]]''. Von Drake would later appear as the host of the following volumes: ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: Fun with Music|Fun With Music]]'' (a.k.a ''101 Notes of Fun''), ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: Under the Sea|Under the Sea]]'', ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!|I Love to Laugh]]'', and finally ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: Colors of the Wind|Colors of the Wind]]'', released in [[1995]].

===1990-present===
In [[1991]], Von Drake hosted the television special ''[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Animated]]'', where he takes a look at the "private lives" of classic Disney characters. Around this time, Von Drake made a comeback with the premiere of the [[Disney Afternoon]] television block, making appearances in several of its programs (now voiced by [[Corey Burton]]), the first being the acclaimed series ''[[DuckTales]]'', where he made a guest appearance.

In [[1999]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' premiered on [[ABC]], and featured Von Drake as the star of his own animated shorts, including the gag segments "Von Drake's House of Genius". Von Drake later appeared in the sister series, ''[[House of Mouse]]'', as a recurring character alongside others from the ''Mickey Mouse'' universe. While Von Drake's design in ''Mouse Works'' more or less resembled that of Milt Kahl's, the iteration appearing in ''House of Mouse'' was drawn with thicker legs and feathers that stretched further down his legs.

In the early 2000s, computer animation had become increasingly popular. Many of Disney’s classic characters made the transition from traditional animation to 3D with the release of ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' in [[2004]] (not including video games). Von Drake was not amongst the film’s roster, instead making the transition two years later with the premiere of the long-running ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' on [[Playhouse Disney]] in [[2006]].

In [[2008]], Disney Parks released a promotional video starring Von Drake (again, using traditional animation) as he and a narrator explained Google Earth's feature that allowed users to tour the [[Walt Disney World]] Resort on their computer.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''===
[[File:NewPicture6-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Ludwig Von Drake in his debut episode, ''An Adventure in Color''.]]
Von Drake became a very popular recurring character and appeared many times hosting the weekly show, following his debut. In some instances, he would even interact with Walt Disney. In "[[An Adventure in Color/Mathmagicland]]", Walt introduced Ludwig as his "old friend and long-time associate" (despite needing a card to remember his name).

Several episodes were fairly significant to Ludwig's character. In "[[The Hunting Instinct]]", Walt revealed that the professor is the brother of Donald Duck's father. He further explained that the drakes (being Donald's paternal family branch) are the "eggheads" of the Duck clan. In the same episode, Von Drake was given a companion, [[Herman the Bootle Beetle]], who would become a recurring sidekick to Von Drake; the latter refers to Herman as his best friend. In "[[Inside Donald Duck]]" (the first episode to showcase Von Drake interacting with his nephew) Ludwig tries to psychoanalyze Donald's problems with various different tactics. In "[[Kids is Kids]]", he once again looks to Donald for psychiatric research, focusing on his familial relationship with [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. Von Drake's [[Mother Goose (character)|grandmother]], whom Ludwig claims were none other than the original "Mother Goose", was shown on a portrait in "[[The Truth About Mother Goose]]".

===''[[DuckTales]]''===
[[File:LudwigVonDrakeOnDucktales.jpg|thumb|left|259px|Ludwig in ''DuckTales''. ]]
Von Drake made a guest appearance on ''DuckTales'' as [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad McQuack's]] psychiatrist, in the episode "[[The Golden Fleecing (DuckTales)|The Golden Fleecing]]". In the episode, Launchpad claims to have experienced an encounter involving a band of harpies, visiting the professor to speak of the traumatizing matter. However, Ludwig scoffs the entire situation as a mere dream, but in the end, Launchpad returns with a lovesick harpie as proof, resulting in a nervous breakdown between himself and an astonished Professor Von Drake.

===''[[Bonkers]]''===
Von Drake reprised his psychiatrist role in several guest appearances on ''Bonkers'', appearing mostly in the episodes produced by Duane Capizzi and Robert Hathcock.

He plays a key role in several episodes. In "[[Do Toons Dream of Animated Sheep?]]", he assisted Bonkers in finding out the cause of his missing dreams. In "[[The Toon That Ate Hollywood]]", Von Drake created an invention capable of increasing a toon's humor levels, considerably groundbreaking for the toon world. However, the invention is eventually stolen by two villainous clowns. In "[[Bobcat Fever]]", Von Drake teams up with Bonker's partner, Miranda, in stopping a toon microbe from infecting Bonker's brain. In "[[When the Spirit Moves You]]", ghosts begin haunting the police station, resulting in Von Drake concocting a way to bust them. In "[[Toon for a Day]]", Sergeant Grating believes he is a toon after getting hit in the head, resulting in the professor coming into the scene to solve the problem psychiatrically.

===''[[Quack Pack]]''===
[[File:Quack pack von drake.PNG|thumb|250px|Ludwig in ''Quack Pack''.]]
In ''Quack Pack'', Von Drake resides in a laboratory in [[Duckburg]] and also runs a pizza delivery service to pay for his science equipment. In "[[The Really Mighty Ducks]]", Huey, Dewey, and Louie visit Von Drake after Donald ordered them to clean their room. While there, they notice one of Von Drake's inventions and offers to test it. Ludwig allows them to do so and the machine gives them super abilities. Huey gains super-speed, Dewey gains incredible knowledge and Louie gains super strength. Ludwig is also called for by the President during global crises and after the boys received their powers, they use them to fight crime. Later in the episode, Donald also uses the machine to become a supervillain.

Von Drake returned in "[[Duck Quake]]", where he creates an earthquake-creator that's eventually stolen by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] overnight.

Furthermore, Ludwig made appearances in the episodes "[[Need 4 Speed]]" and "[[Cat & Louse]]".

===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===
[[File:Ludwig_Von_drake_MMW.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ludwig in ''Mickey Mouse Works''.]]
In this series, Von Drake was given his own short series entitled "Von Drake's House of Genius" where he creates a new invention meant to make life easier, but the creations backfire and often get destroyed in the end. He did, however, star in three regular cartoons--one being "[[Relaxing with Von Drake]]", where the professor attempts to ease Donald Duck's nerves. In "[[Hydro-Squirter]]", Von Drake accidentally creates a teleportation bathtub. In "[[Futuremania]]", the professor's latest invention is tested on Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.

Von Drake also made appearances in other characters' cartoons, most notably "[[Mickey Foils the Phantom Blot]]", where the professor asks Mickey, Donald, and Goofy to deliver his very valuable credit card to him in a different location at another time. The reason being that the professor is being hunted down by a criminal mastermind, The [[Phantom Blot]], who seeks to use the card for his own criminal ends. He also made a small cameo in "[[Locksmiths]]".

In the series, Ludwig's mother, who could be heard by voice only, was introduced. Later, her voice (provided by [[April Winchell]]) was heard again in ''House of Mouse''.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:Von_Drake_HOM.jpg|thumb|250px|Ludwig Von Drake in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Ludwig is a recurring character in this series as a "nutty professor"-type character. He had roles in a few episodes where he was the main focus. The most notable of these was "[[Ask Von Drake]]". Here, Mickey tires of Von Drake knowing absolutely everything and challenges the professor throughout the entire evening. In the end, Mickey thinks of one last challenge: name every guest member at the club. Von Drake seemingly goes through the headcount of all the Disney characters with ease ([[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|in song]]) but still ends up losing the challenge, after Mickey points out that the professor forgot one person: himself.

In other episodes, the professor was often called upon to help solve some of the problems in the club. In "[[Super Goof (House of Mouse)|Super Goof]]", Von Drake was called to determine where an oncoming meteor will strike. In "[[House of Crime]]", when all the guests go missing, Von Drake creates a device to lead the heroes to the culprit. Unbeknownst to them, the culprit was The [[Phantom Blot]], and he and the missing guests were inside Von Drake's machine. In "[[Dining Goofy]]", when Goofy gave the guests their wrong meals, Von Drake invented automated touch-screen computers for them to order food. Also, in "[[House of Genius]]", Ludwig creates robot duplicates of Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and Pluto. In the end, when Ludwig brings in a robot duplicate of himself, Mickey tells the robot to send the real Ludwig packing.

Von Drake also appeared in the film ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'', where he goes on stage to lecture about ''The Science of Santa''. This scene was later reused in the episode "[[Pete's Christmas Caper]]".

===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===
[[File:Ludwig_MMC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ludwig Von Drake in ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse''.|alt=]]
Here, Von Drake is a recurring character and the creator of the clubhouse. He created the clubhouse as a gift for Mickey equipping it with various accessories that make life much easier, including the Handy Helpers and [[Toodles]]. Ludwig often creates new inventions that go wrong accidentally.

Like his previous appearances, many of his inventions cause trouble such as when Donald drank his potion and transformed into a frog or when magical goo he created multiplied Goofy. Despite this, a number of inventions saved the day such as the time when the color was being drained from the world and he used a device to get it back. He is the most intelligent of the group and most problem solving is due to his ideas and innovations.

===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===
[[File:Image Ludwig .jpeg|thumb|250px|Ludwig in ''Mickey Mouse''.]]
Ludwig returns in the ''Mickey Mouse'' animated series, first appearing in the episode "[[Down the Hatch]]" as a museum scientist and tour guide introducing various scientific marvels. These include a shrink ray, which falls into the hands of Mickey and Goofy, resulting in an adventure within Donald's internal caverns. In the end, Mickey and Goofy's shrink condition wears off, resulting in Donald laying an egg, hatching into the duo. An astonished Ludwig congratulates the trio on their discovery of "men from egg" and openly ponders on the idea of a further investigation, much to Donald's dismay and fear.

Von Drake also appeared in the episode "[[Wonders of the Deep]]", where he takes Mickey, Donald, and Goofy on a voyage to explore the wonders of the deep. During which, he is jettisoned out of the submarine and into the sea and being eaten by a clam. When the professor is freed from the clam inside the submarine, it is revealed that he was oblivious of any sort of danger, as well as the squid battle, as he was still calculating the probability of finding one. Ironically, he learns that there's still a chance and asks Mickey, Donald, and Goofy if they would like to search for it, prompting a fearful Mickey and Donald to jettison themselves out of the submarine in the same clam that ate Von Drake.

In "[[Split Decisions]]", Von Drake is visited by Mickey and Donald; the former explains that Donald's temper has been more unruly than usual, and a remedy is in need for the sake of his health and relationship with Daisy. Von Drake uses an invention to remove Donald's anger, though this creates two trouble-making incarnations of Donald: one who's obnoxiously happy, and another with a dangerously violent temper. While Von Drake works to re-calibrate the machine, Mickey rounds up the two Donalds to revive the original.

In "[[Duck the Halls: A Mickey Mouse Christmas Special|Duck the Halls]]", Von Drake migrates to the south for the winter season alongside [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]], [[Scrooge McDuck]], and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] as a family trip. Donald was meant to join, but according to Daisy, he stayed behind to celebrate Christmas with Mickey and the others. Ludwig mourns the absence of the guinea pig for his experiments, but more importantly explains that Donald is in grave danger should he stay in the north for too long, as a duck cannot survive in such weather. In the end, Christmas is celebrated in the south. Ludwig is accidentally given Scrooge's money bag for the holidays, while Scrooge gets Ludwig's telescope, though the two exchange understandingly. They are then seen playing checkers together as the day comes to an end.

In "[[Three-Legged Race]]", Ludwig teams up with the [[Martian Robot]] to compete in the titular race. Like the other racers (sans Mickey), Von Drake cheats by using the robot's mechanics to sabotage Donald and Scrooge. In "[[Surprise!]]", Von Drake uses a growth ray to aid in the creation of Mickey's giant birthday cake. Ludwig had a larger role in the episode "[[Outta Time]]", which once again largely takes place in the "Hall of Science", where he sends Mickey and Donald back in time to rescue Goofy after the latter accidentally uses a time machine during one of Ludwig's guided tours.

===''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]''===
[[File:Von_Drake_in_Mickey_and_the_roadster_racers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Von Drake in ''Mickey and the Roadster Racers''.]]
Ludwig is a recurring character in the animated racing series, residing in Hot Dog Hills alongside the other characters. He has a laboratory on the top floor of Mickey's garage, where he works on various inventions. He is able to communicate with Mickey and the others through a video monitor.

He, once again, plays the role of a well-meaning professor that regularly creates inventions for the benefit of Mickey and his friends, only for said inventions to cause trouble in one way or another. An example of this is "[[Smarty Goof]]", where he invents a hat capable of turning its host into a genius, and "[[Mouse Vs. Machine!]]", where he creates an A.I. car that challenges Mickey to a Roadster race to see if actual drivers are still necessary. In "[[Grandpa Beagle's Day Out]]", it is shown that Ludwig sells high-tech bikes on the side from a garage in town.

In season two, Von Drake upgrades the vehicles of Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, and Goofy to be “super charged”, which becomes a recurring shtick in the show for ongoing episodes.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017 series)]]===
[[File:Ludwig Von Drake DuckTales 2017.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Von Drake in the ''DuckTales'' reboot.]]
In the ''DuckTales'' reboot series, Ludwig is the director of [[S.H.U.S.H.]], the former employer of [[Bentina Beakley]], and an old colleague of Scrooge McDuck. He briefly appears in a flashback taking place in the 1960s in the episode "[[From the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22!]]", where he assigns Scrooge and Beakley as partners to take down a [[F.O.W.L.]] operative, [[Black Heron]]. For the sake of their mission, Von Drake equips Scrooge with a new invention: the Von Drake Action Cane PPK.

In the present day (as seen in "[[Raiders of the Doomsday Vault!]]"), Ludwig's children Corvus, Anya and Klara have taken over at least some of his duties, including the management of Ludwig’s Arctic "doomsday vault", which he established in case of worldwide disaster. Inside the vault, Ludwig appears in a number of video-recorded instruction guides, which [[Della Duck]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] utilize to plunder Von Drake’s money tree.

As seen in a flashback in "[[The First Adventure!]]", Bradford once proposed that S.H.U.S.H. take over the world to liberate it from chaos. Von Drake denied Bradford's request, however, reminding him that Bradford got the job because Ludwig owed his grandmother a favor and urged him to abandon his villainous schemes. After being dismissed, a scorned Bradford joined forces with Black Heron to form F.O.W.L..

In “[[The Last Adventure!]]”, Ludwig is revealed to be alive, as a prisoner in Bradford’s secret lair. He explains that between being captured and forced to work on Bradford’s evil schemes, he became so busy that he never got around to dying. Ludwig reveals to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey]] and [[Gyro Gearloose]] that Bradford—having detested his time as a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]]—is plotting to eradicate all things adventurous, including Scrooge McDuck, his family, and his associates. Von Drake is later placed in a special containment unit alongside Huey, Dewey, Louie, Gyro, [[Gandra Dee]], and [[Webby Vanderquack]] as Bradford’s plan nears completion. While captive, Ludwig reveals to the nephews that Webby was made from Scrooge McDuck's DNA created by Black Heron along with [[April, May, and June|May and June]].

Later, Ludwig manages to escape alongside Gyro and Gandra, and the three band together to dismantle Bradford’s existence-erasing portal. Ludwig joins with Scrooge and the rest of the family to confront Bradford, who is ultimately turned into a mindless vulture by [[Magica De Spell]]. With F.O.W.L. defeated, Ludwig returns back to civilization with the rest of the heroes.

===''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]''===
[[File:Von drake and the house of tomorrow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Von Drake in ''The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse''.|alt=]]
Ludwig is a recurring character in this, a continuation of the earlier ''Mickey Mouse'' series. He first appears in "[[House of Tomorrow]]", as a scientist and tour guide for Mickey, Donald and Goofy. He shows the trio his newest invention: the titular House of Tomorrow, which is home to the latest technology, including an artificial intelligence that caters to everyone's needs. However, it's not open yet; it will open tomorrow. Von Drake then leaves, and the door opens, enticing Mickey, Donald and Goofy to go inside and check it out. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence goes so crazy from catering to the trio's needs that the house explodes into flames, and the A.I. jettisons the trio from the premises. Von Drake panics when he returns and sees his house in ruins, but decides to deal with that tomorrow.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]''===
[[File:King Ludwig Von Drake.png|thumb|150px|King Ludwig Von Drake in ''Mickey Mouse Funhouse'']]
Ludwig is a recurring character in this series as the king of Majestica.

In "[[King Mickey]]", he left Mickey in charge of the kingdom while he's going out of town. He tells Mickey that it's his responsibility to get chores done in the castle. But Mickey has become overwhelmed and nervous about taking on such a big responsibility of being king, that he misinterpreted it as doing the chores all by himself.

===Other appearances===
In ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', Ludwig Von Drake makes two guest appearances in episodes 1 and 8, as an expert in cartoon-physics.

==Printed media==
===Comics===
[[File:Ludwig_Von_Drake_Issue_One.jpeg|thumb|250px|Ludwig on the cover of his first starring comic, ''Walt Disney's Ludwig Von Drake''.]]
The Disney studio encouraged the writers of the ''Donald Duck'' comics to introduce this new character in print and already in September 1961, on the very same day that his animated debut aired on television, Von Drake started appearing in [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Bob Karp]]'s featured daily newspaper strips. He also made a brief appearance in the one-page story ''Flowers are Flowers'' in ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #54 (December [[1964]]), which is notable for being Von Drake's first and only appearance in the works of <span>leading Disney duck artist </span>[[Carl Barks]]<span>.</span>

In 1961, Dell Comics launched a comic book series starring Von Drake that was illustrated by [[Tony Strobl]], but it only lasted for four issues before being discontinued. The character did keep making subsequent appearances in other comic titles such as ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' and in the ''Donald Duck'' newspaper strip.

In the comics (especially those created in Italy), Ludwig usually visits his relatives Donald Duck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie. On occasion, Daisy Duck would coax (or even trick) the professor into giving lectures and tours for her ladies' club. When he is consulted by other family members, it is a running gag that he almost invariably turns out to have a university degree relevant for whatever information they are seeking. In recent comics, he works as a college professor at Duckburg's [[Cornelius Coot|Coot]] University

==Video Games==
===''[[Mickey Saves the Day 3D Adventure]]''===

Ludwig is a playable character in the game. To unlock him, a player must select Minnie Mouse and win a few games.

During [[Sora]]'s visit to [[Twilight Town]], [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters|Olette]] shows him a poster for ''Mickey & Sora in [[Giantland]]''.

==Trivia==
*Von Drake is the first Disney character made specifically for television.
*Milt Khal was said to have been inspired in part by Picasso when finalizing Ludwig's design.
*According to [[Walt Disney]], Ludwig is the brother of Donald Duck's father.<ref name="drake" /> Disney identified the Drakes as the continental branch of the family, and the eggheads of the clan. In "[[The Donald Duck Story]]", before Ludwig was introduced, it had already been specified that the Drakes were Donald's paternal relatives, but Donald took his mother's maiden name, "Duck", instead. This relation was not carried over into the popular ''Donald Duck'' comic stories, and Ludwig was not included in the comic iteration of Donald's family tree. Instead, Ludwig's relation to the comic Duck family is inconsistent and has been altered on a number of occasions.
**Although Ludwig does not appear in the final version of the tree, [[Don Rosa]] originally wanted to include the professor on the Duck family tree as the husband of [[Matilda McDuck]], one of Scrooge McDuck's sisters. However, this contradicts the fact that in "[[Kids is Kids]]", Ludwig stated that he is a bachelor. The 2001 book ''The Little Big Book of Disney'', went with Rosa's interpretation, though that book's family tree has a question mark next to the placement, referencing the ambiguity.
**Some 1960s Disney comics (including [[Tony Strobl]]'s 6-pager ''Barn Dance Doctor'', first published in 1961) state that Ludwig is Grandma Duck's cousin.<ref>http://coa.inducks.org/hr.php?normalsize=1&image=http://outducks.org/webusers/webusers-char0/us_gpsb_04_02_006_gd.jpg</ref> This relationship was even further established in the German translation of ''Duckburg, U.S.A'' (first published in 1961). Here, Grandma reveals that Ludwig is the son of her maternal aunt and a certain Hofrat Von Drake. In contrast to these classic comics, a character profile poster of Ludwig in the German Disney comic magazine ''[[Micky Maus Magazin]]'' states that he is Grandma Duck's nephew rather than her cousin.<ref>http://www.duckipedia.de/images/2/2d/MMMPrimus.JPG</ref>
*At one point in the 1960s, during the production of the Disneyland television series, there were plans at the Disney Studios to give Ludwig a son, who was to be voiced by Fred Frees, Paul Frees's own son.<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredfrees</ref>
*He is possibly ambidextrous, as seen in ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color''. He writes with his left hand briefly near the beginning and writes on the chalkboard with both hands.
*Ludwig once dated a duck lady named Alice in a series of 1985 newspaper comics. Alice and Ludwig met each other through the "Absentminded Dating Club", and kept forgetting each others' names.<ref>http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Alice+from+YD&c1=code</ref>
*Concept art for ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' reveals that Von Drake was originally intended to make a cameo in the [[Oh My Disney]] section of the film.<ref>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/nnwo4</ref>
*Despite not appearing in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'', series director Matt Danner confirmed that Ludwig works at the show’s primary setting, the [[New Quackmore]] Institute.<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/MattyDanner/status/1454609757176688643 Matt Danner’s Twitter]</ref>
