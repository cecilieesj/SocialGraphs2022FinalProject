'''Quilda'''<ref>[http://borjamontoro.blogspot.fi/2016/04/zootopiaviii.html Borja Montoro's blog]</ref> is a character featured in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''.

==Background==
Quilda is an anthropomorphic {{WikipediaLink|crested porcupine}}. She serves as an interviewer who interviews with [[Mayor Lionheart]] during his arrest after the predators infected by the [[night howlers]] have been cured back to normal, which Lionheart claims that he did imprison the savage animals. However, she doesn't talk much.

==Role in the film==
Quilda is first seen during the part where [[Judy Hopps]] attempts to arrest [[Nick Wilde]] for scamming her with his [[Pawpsicle]] plans. She is seen standing between the two at a crosswalk. Soon as Quilda walks across the street, Nick follows the porcupine using her quills to protect herself from a herd of wildebeests in another direction just as Judy follows him.

Later at the end of the film, Quilda is seen interviewing [[Mayor Lionheart]] questioning him if he was responsible for arresting the predator animals in savage mode - albeit in a false way. Lionheart tells her giving him claims that he did ''intentionally'' imprison the animals, telling him it was good intentions. Quilda makes no further appearances after that.

==Trivia==
*In the book ''Zootopia: The Essential Guide'', Quilda was named "'''Muriel'''".
*In the original theatrical release where [[Mayor Lionheart]]'s in-jail interview was slightly longer where he explains about why he imprisoned the animals, he asks Quilda, "You can understand that, can't you?" to which she replies to him flatly, "No." In all subsequent releases of the movie (DVD, Blu-ray, digital, streaming, TV broadcasts, etc.), these two lines are not present, leaving Quilda silent in all subsequent releases. The reason why these lines were cut is unknown.
**Additionally, in an original screenplay of ''Zootopia'', it was a deleted character named "Kitty Cowlick" who interviewed Lionheart at the end of the film and not Quilda.
*Quilda's name is a pun of her species "quill" which porcupines have and the female name "Hilda".
