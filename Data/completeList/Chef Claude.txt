==Role in the episode==
[[Timon]] decides that he and [[Pumbaa]] learn how to cook after seeing that the bugs have no taste at all. Claude tries to show them how to prepare food properly, but they constantly fail, so this makes Claude think they can't cook. But Timon persists, and decides that he and Pumbaa finish what they started. The two finally whip up a parfait, and when Claude tastes it, he swiftly says that it's good and runs off.
