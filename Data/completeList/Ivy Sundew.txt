==Background==
===Personality===
Ivy is a total tomboy. She is confident, eager and very friendly, albeit in a rough way. She enjoys relaxing and hanging out with Sprig and is willing to jump into action if given the opportunity. Like most children however, she cares very much for her mother and when things get scary, is shown to cling to her like most children do. She tends to be impatient when it comes to her mother’s rules and expectations, but she comes to accept them upon learning Felicia’s past and intentions to take her on an adventure someday.

Ivy Sundew is close in age to Sprig, but is slightly shorter and stouter than him. She is yellow with a light yellow underbelly and possess orange hair that stick out in tufts underneath her teal beanie. She wears a light blue shirt and denim dungarees to go along with them. She is barefoot with two toes, has three fingers and light violet tongue.

==Role in the series==
===Season One===
In "[[Dating Season]]", while Sprig and [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] were exploring the woods, Ivy ambush Sprig and then was introduced to Anne who was from another world, and she then took off promising to do another ambush. Later, [[Hop Pop Plantar]] and Felicia arranged Ivy and Sprig to a date as part of the Firefly festival, as Hop Pop and Felicia planned to have their families emerged and get what they agree. That night, due to being forced by her mother, Ivy danced with Sprig as part of a dating ritual, however the two didn't want to go with it so the two decided to abandon the ritual and go watch the fireflies. Ivy and Sprig removed the dresses they were forced to wear and started to have some fun before at the fireflies.

While they were watching, Felicia, Anne, Hop Pop, and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] were captured by Love Doves, Sprig and Ivy rescue them and defeated the Love Doves. They then inform their families they don't to get married and never will, Hop Pop agree, but Felicia took Ivy home, so she could "apologize to her safety." Ivy and Sprig then waved to each other goodbye and as they do, Sprig develops romantic feelings which he and Anne are able to catch on.

In "[[Toad Tax]]", Ivy and Felicia have all of their belongings stolen by [[Bog, Fens, and Mire]], due to believing they did not pay their taxes to [[Toad Tower]]. However, Anne is able to return a mug to Felicia, making the Sundews feeling grateful towards Anne. Later, Ivy and Felicia, along with everyone in Wartwood gather around at the Plantar Farm, witnessing Anne standing up to the toads after having enough of their cruelty. Ivy and the citizens are amazed by Anne's bravery and selflessness, which motivates them to stand up to the toads and protect Anne when the toads injure her. After [[Mayor Toadstool]] is exposed for hoarding the town's taxes, everyone gets their belongings back and Ivy, along with everyone in Wartwood cheer for Anne, finally respecting her while naming her the official protector of Wartwood.

In "[[Civil Wart]]", Ivy is seen watching the movie ''Love Choice'' after the movie concludes a fight breaks out over those who choose Hunter and those who chose Alistair. It is unknown which side Ivy pick as she is not seen on either side.

In "[[Anne of the Year]]", she is revealed to have romantic feelings for Sprig.

===Season Two===
In "[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]", she is seen watching [[Newtopia Castle]] raise into the air alongside [[One-Eyed Wally]], [[Sadie Croaker]], Archie, [[Mayor Toadstool]], [[Toadie]], [[Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger]]. 

== Relationships ==
=== [[Sprig Plantar]] ===
Ivy had been friends with Sprig for a long time. The two are so close that they are comfortable with rough housing with one another and hanging out casually. While not confirmed until "[[Anne of the Year]]", Ivy has apparently had a crush on Sprig for a long time. This was slightly hinted at in "[[Croak and Punishment]]" where she opted to have a Blue Moon Shell, which was initially meant for her as a birthday present, stay with Sprig so that she will know when she is close to his house. In "[[Return to Wartwood]]," the two of them are more open about their feelings for one another. Even though Sprig slipped up at not getting Ivy a gift from his trip, she still loved him and told him that she could take her on a date, before kissing him.

When Sprig and his family escaped to Earth, in order to evade the wrath of [[King Andrias]], Ivy questioned [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] and [[Captain Grime]] on Sprig's whereabouts when they came to Wartwood, showing concern for her boyfriend.

=== [[Felicia Sundew]] ===
Ivy loves her mother, but she was initially shown to be strict and overbearing to her. Felicia expected Ivy to obey her and complete her chores perfectly. Ivy lacked the patience to put up with Felicia’s rules, but soon learned that her mother was teaching her self-defense through those strict chores. Ivy came to appreciate her mother for understanding her desire for adventure and promising to take her on one in the future. Ivy cares about Felicia and is shown to hug her mother whenever something dangerous is happening. Ivy is also shown to help Felicia with running her tea shop and hold her mother’s hand like most children do.

==Trivia==
*Ivy seems to be the only true friend that Sprig has ever had. Though it can be argued that Maddie Flour is also a close friend.
*While most animated shows tend to develop romantic relationships over the course of the series' run, Ivy and Sprig's relationship was made official by the end of the first season.
*Ivy's full name, Ivy Hibiscus Matcha Sundew, are all names of plant or tea related things. Ivy, or Hedera, is a type of climbing vine that itself carries various subset plants. Hibiscus is a type of flower found in tropical climate areas that can be used to make Hibiscus tea. Matcha is finely ground powder made from green tea leaves that are most commonly made in East Asian countries. The Sundew, or Drosera, is a small carnivorous plant that is called so because of its liquor like dew that hangs from its leaves. Each name perfectly summarizes her character as well as various themes of the show.
