The '''Strange Cobra''' is a character seen in the Season 3 episode of ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', ''[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]''. He is an unnamed cobra who is the one responsible for giving [[Scar]] his scar in the first place.

==Background==
===Personality===
The strange cobra shows a crafty and menacing personality after he strikes Scar.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]''===
The Strange Cobra's only appearance in the episode is during a flashback in the musical number "[[When I Led the Guard]]".

When Scar was alive during his position as the Fiercest of the Lion Guard, the strange lion lead Scar to his friend, a venomous cobra which struck Scar on his left eye with his venomous bite, giving him his scar. Upon receiving his namesake, the lion then told Scar that the only way to purify the venom from the cobra is to do his task but an out-of-control Scar uses the [[Roar of the Elders]] against the two, destroying both the lion and the cobra. Afterwards, both the cobra and the lion are destroyed after Scar blasts them into [[the Outlands]]' volcano.

==Relationships==

===Friends===

====[[Strange Lion]]====
This snake worked in collaboration with the strange lion, which is likely that he and the lion are friends. However, the snake gave Scar his namesake because the strange lion gave him a negative influence going near the cobra.

===Enemies===

====[[Scar]]====
This snake was the reason of giving Scar his namesake. He and the strange lion were using Scar for power in an attempt to take over [[Mufasa]]'s place as king, but the plan failed when Scar used the Roar against them as the strange lion gave him a negative influence.

==Trivia==
*The revelation of the cobra responsible for giving Scar his namesake contradicts [[Rob Minkoff]]'s (director of [[The Lion King|the original ''Lion King'' film]]) opinion about Scar receiving his namesake when he and Mufasa were cubs; according to Minkoff's opinion, Mufasa was the one responsible for giving Scar his namesake as a cub.
**Similarly, in the book series "[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures]]", Scar received his namesake after getting attacked by a Cape buffalo.
**The [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake of ''The Lion King'']], however, revealed that Scar received his namesake by challenging Mufasa to know who is the king of [[Pride Rock]] as it is mentioned that Mufasa was the one giving his namesake as an adult lion.
*The Strange Cobra belongs to a specific blue-coated subspecies of cobra; a African Black-Necked Spitting Cobra.
*The Strange Cobra was seen early. On July 30th, 2019 in a video on [[Disney Junior]]'s YouTube channel.
