'''Dr. Elliott Piaget''' is a child psychologist who introduces and closes the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_406:_Terrible_Twos Terrible Twos]." He was portrayed by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Allan_Trautman Allan Trautman].

Dr. Piaget is shocked by the story's resolution and demands a rebuttal from the producers (but gets eaten by the [[The Predator|Predator]] instead).

The character's name is a reference to the Swiss developmental psychologist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget Jean Piaget].{{DEFAULTSORT:Piaget, Elliott}}{{MuppetsWiki}}{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}
