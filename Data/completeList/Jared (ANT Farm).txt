<p style="line-height:19px;">'''Jared''' is [[Chyna Parks|Chyna]]'s fake boyfriend in "Some EnchANTed Evening"Â (which was his first appearance) in ''[[ANT Farm]]. ''His is shown to be very over-dramatic, like in "Some EnchANTed Evening", when he accused somebody of being a murderer. He isn't very good at dressing like his character, such as, in the fake date, he's wearing a cape and an eye patch. His second appearance is in "You're the One That I WANT", when he gets the role of the leading man in the school's musical along with Chyna, as his leading lady. This character is portrayed by Cameron Palatas.</p>
