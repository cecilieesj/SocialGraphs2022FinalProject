'''Tyler Nguyen-Baker's Parents''' (also known as '''Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen-Baker''') are minor characters that appear in [[Turning Red|''Turning Red'']].

== Personality ==
Not much is known about Tyler's parents since they are cameo characters, but it is known that they are quite friendly and critical at the same time. They love their son very much and will allow him to do anything he wants, even allowing him to have a party without any adult supervision. Despite being friendly, they can also be critical too as seen when they scolded [[Ming Lee|Ming]] after [[Mei Lee|Mei]] got furious over Tyler. They are extremely protective of their son and will yell at or scold anyone who is a threat to him.

== Trivia ==

* Their only appearance in the film was when Tyler's birthday party was ruined by Mei's red panda form.
