==Background==
Claudia was born to Leopold. She had two brothers. The family lived in the [[Jungle (The Lion King)|jungle]], where they ruled as the royal family of the leopards.

===Personality===
Claudia is quite playful and adventurous. When [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] were promoted by Leopold to be her bodyguards, she took the duo to some dangerous parts of the jungle, such as an empty field with a stampede of wildebeests, a cave inhabited by a giant spider, and an area of bull elephants. According to Leopold, Claudia is a bit of a daredevil, but very kind-hearted in comparison to her two brothers.

===Physical description===
Claudia is a small leopard cub. She has bright golden fur, with a cream chest, muzzle, and paws. She has brown spots on her back, as well as brown ear rims and a brown tail tip. She has yellow eyes.

==Role in the series==
Claudia is chased by a hyena. When she reaches a dead-end, a gorilla appears and attacks the hyena, causing the hyena to run away, with the ape giving chase. Timon and Pumbaa appear and find Claudia. Leopold then shows up and is about to attack Timon and Pumbaa, but Claudia stops her father and tells him that the two had saved her life. Leopold then reveals to the duo that he is the king of the leopards and offers them a reward for saving his daughter.

Timon and Pumbaa are pampered at Leopold's place. While Pumbaa feels guilty for the misunderstanding, Timon gladly takes advantage. Meanwhile, Claudia wants to go out and play with her father, but the king is too busy to do so. He therefore makes Timon and Pumbaa become his daughter's bodyguards and tells them that if they succeed in their duties, there would be a position for them at the royal court. Pumbaa tells Timon that they did not know how to be Claudia's bodyguards, but the meerkat says that they just have to try to keep the cub out of trouble. He then warns Pumbaa that they would get in trouble with Leopold if they do not do their job well.

Claudia takes Timon and Pumbaa to a plain field, believing it to be a fun place since she never knows what she would run into. The ground then shakes, and a herd of wildebeests stampede into view. While Pumbaa quickly goes to the edge of a rock with Claudia, Timon gets trampled by the herd twice.

Claudia then takes Timon and Pumbaa to her favorite tree, as it is home to one of the world's largest pythons. The python shows up and grabs Timon while Pumbaa and Claudia are sliding over the snake. Pumbaa suggests that Timon tells Leopold that they did not really saved Claudia from the hyena. Before Timon could confess the truth to Leopold, the king deals with another leopard, scolding and attacking him for not taking good care of Claudia. Worried by what he had sees, Timon decides not to tell Leopold the truth.

Claudia takes Timon and Pumbaa to a cave. At first, Timon refuses to enter until the princess tells him that it has really big bugs. When Timon and Pumbaa follow Claudia inside the cave, Timon gets caught by a giant spider. After Pumbaa saves Timon from getting eaten, Claudia takes the duo to a ravine. While the three are relaxing in the water, Timon gets bitten by tigerfish and attacked by crocodiles. Pumbaa then makes Timon try to tell Leopold the truth once again. However, the meerkat still hesitates to do so, as he is afraid of what Leopold would do.

Claudia takes Timon and Pumbaa to other parts of the jungle. During each instance, Timon suffers. Despite all the trouble Timon gets into during the adventures, the meerkat still refuses to let Leopold know that he and Pumbaa did not really rescue Claudia from the hyena.

Timon, Pumbaa, and Claudia then find themselves in an area of bull elephants, where a curse causes the skeletons of said elephants to come out of the ground and attack. After getting trampled by the bull elephants, Timon decides to tell Leopold the truth. After hearing the truth, Leopold is impressed, stating that he admires honesty more than courage. As a reward for setting a good example for Claudia, he gives Timon and Pumbaa a promotion, which is to look after his two sons, who, according to him, are naughtier than his daughter.
