|alignment = Neutral}}'''King Freddie II''' is the King of the Playground after [[King Bob]] graduates in ''[[Recess: School's Out]]''. He also invites [[T.J. Detweiler|T.J.]] and the gang to the Fifth and Sixth Graders Club.
==Appearance==
King Freddie is tall and slender. He has tan skin, slanted eyes, black hair, and wears a light green polo shirt, dark green pants, black sneakers, and after becoming king, a yellow crown-shaped baseball hat with a blue "F" on it.

==Personality==
Before becoming King, Freddie was only a background character. At the beginning of ''[[Recess: School's Out]]'', King Bob crowns him king of the playground, as he's graduating that year.
King Freddie is shown to be bossy, and unlike King Bob, he was not a fair ruler. He often came up with cruel, harsh punishments for the kids, however his guards had to tell him to lay it a little easier.

In ''[[Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade]]'', he is only seen in "Grade Five Club".

==Trivia==
*King Freddie was once shown in King Bob's class in "[[Pharaoh Bob]]" and in the line in "[[Omega Kids]]", however, he is a year younger than him. This may or may not be considered a continuity error, as the episode was being made before ''Recess: School's Out'' was greenlit.
