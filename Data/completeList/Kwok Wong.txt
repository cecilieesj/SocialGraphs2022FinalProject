Ribbs Middle School that participated as Romeo in the school production of "Romeo and Juliet" opposite [[Penny Proud]] (who played Juliet).

==History==
His parents come from an area in China where tradition leads them to arrange their children's marriages long before either of them are born, causing much strife to Kwok and Penny who have become closer as they rehearse for the school play. Despite being engaged to another woman, Kwok still has feelings for Penny, and even tries to make things right between them when she confronts him while he is at work. Later that night, he meets his fiancé who is visiting from China, only to catch Penny and [[Dijonay Jones]] sneaking around their house at night (albeit causing both he and Penny to fall off of a ledge). Kwok later reveals to Penny (during opening night of the play) that he and his fiancé couldn't stand each other and the wedding was off. They later reconciled and were seen performing their own version of Romeo and Juliet for Mr. Vericola.

Kwok is again seen (with a speaking role) reading poetry in a popular hangout of Penny and her friends.
