==[[Witch Way Did She Go?]]==
After [[Sadira]] pours her soup on the sand, the witches, led by Shakata, come out. Eventually, they try to eliminate Aladdin and his friends with a sand snake but it fails. After meeting Sadira, they ask her to become one of them, but Sadira tells them that she has to think about it first. After overhearing [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]], [[Jasmine]], and [[Genie]] insult her when trying to warn them about the three witches, she decides to join the witches. Aladdin and the others go to Sadira's place and see what's going on. The witches notice them and trap them. They then turn Sadira's lair into a series of tall black towers that surround the city with the help of a magic staff. After Sadira releases the gang, she tells them that she fooled the witches into thinking she's on their side, but no one, aside from Jasmine, believes her. So Genie locks her up in a treasure chest and throws it out the window and everyone fights the witches, who trap them again. Sadira returns with the staff and tells the witches to open a portal to a Realm of Mists. When the witches do so, Sadira pushes them in and frees the gang. Shakata grabs her and tries to make her fall as well. Aladdin grabs Sadira by the hand, but her hand slips and she falls down and the portal closes. Aladdin and the others begin to realize that Sadira wasn't evil after all. The portal opens, Sadira comes out, traps the witches, and everyone apologizes to her.
