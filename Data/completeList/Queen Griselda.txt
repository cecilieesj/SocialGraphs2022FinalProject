|quote = }}'''Griselda''' is the queen of Valhalla and the wife of the viking King Yorik. She appeared in episode 62, "[[Maid of the Myth]]".
==''[[DuckTales]]''==
==="[[Maid of the Myth]]"===
She was angry when [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] arrived in her land but her husband gave her a gold necklace and lots of other stuff. The queen was jealous that her people were interested in Mrs. Beakley's singing voice but she had a plan for her. Griselda took a bag of powder and put it in a cup of water so Mrs. Beakley would lose her voice but [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]] drank it by mistake and lost his voice. At the end of the episode, Yorik said he would teach his wife to be a good queen and teach her to share with the outsiders.

==Physical appearance==
She has long, blonde hair, wears a jeweled crown, wristlets, and bracelets, necklace, and pink dress.
