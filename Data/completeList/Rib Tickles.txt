Rib appears in the episode "[[What is a Pet?]]". Despite being deleted from ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', Rib makes a physical appearance for the first time. When [[Forky]] walks up to her, Rib introduces herself to Forky, explaining that she and her partner [[Giggle McDimples]] run the Pet Patrol division of Minneapolis station. She explains to Forky that Rib herself is a toy while real animals are pets. Just as the suspect toys leave, Rib continues explaining that [[Dragon the Cat]] in the [[Second Chance Antiques]] store swallowed her, one week away from her retirement. She then continues explaining that Giggle McDimples was gone forever, but she managed to survive somehow. She then explains her tragic flashback to Forky about her encounter with Dragon to which she managed to escape by landing into a sandbox. Upon hearing a meowing cat from a distance (possibly implied to be Dragon), Forky tells her to do it again to which she plans on regretting this plan. At the end of the episode, she regrets this plan on being in the sandbox just like she ended up at like in her flashback.
