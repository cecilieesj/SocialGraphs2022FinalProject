She is Doc and Donny's mother and Mr. McStuffins' wife and works as a doctor. She sometimes has Doc to volunteer for her when there's a patient to help, either toy or person. She and Doc are both doctors and always expects Doc to become one, like herself.

==Appearance==
Dr. McStuffins is slender and wears a green long-sleeved shirt and denim jeans. She is often seen wearing a white lab coat just like Doc.

==Personality==
Dr. McStuffins is mostly compassionate and motherly, but when there's a patient in need, she always remains sweet and friendly to them, if the patient is a person, but when Doc is stuck on a hard case when there's a toy to fix, her mother always helps her with some advice or help to fix the toy.

==Trivia==
*Dr. McStuffins' real name is Maisha which we learn in ''The Big Sleepover''. Her name is based on Dr. Myiesha Taylor, an emergency room physician at Texas Regional Medical Center in Sunnyvale.
*Dr. McStuffins is as sweet and as maternal as [[Kanga]] from ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]''.
*She is absent for some episodes.
