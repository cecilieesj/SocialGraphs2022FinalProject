{{quote|You don't turn your back on family. Unless your back will save them from a falling tree.|Zito, [[The Kilio Valley Fire]]}} 

'''Zito''' is an adult male elephant and a member of [[Ma Tembo]]'s Herd.

==Appearance==
Zito is a large, grey, bulky elephant with two large white tusks and a long trunk which is pale grey inside. His face contains wrinkles, and around his jet, black eyes are dark grey. Running along his back are several darker grey spots and he has a small tail with a dark grey tuft. He has four pale grey toes on his feet. His ears are pink, and his left ear contains two notches. Atop his head are three wisps of hair and some additional dark grey spots.

==Personality==
Zito is shown as being stubborn, impatient, ungrateful, and prone to complaining. He appears to take things very literally, as seen when [[Hadithi]] uses the quote, ''The higher you fly, the more they'll look up to you'', where Zito points out that elephants can't fly.

== Role in the series ==
In "[[The Kilio Valley Fire]]", despite the [[Lion Guard]]'s best attempts to control the fires spreading in Kilio Valley, Zito remains unappreciative of their efforts, complaining over trivial matters and blaming the Lion Guard for eventually losing Kilio Valley, even though it was not their fault. However, he does seem to appreciate the value of family and has a softer side, as shown when he saves [[Kion]] from a falling tree. 

In "[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]" Zito helps fight the [[Army of Scar]]. 

In "[[Return to the Pride Lands]]" Zito has become part of the Lion Guard competition between Kion's Lion Guard and [[Vitani]]'s Lion Guard. He and Ma Tembo each stand on a huge boulder for the strongest members (Ma Tembo for [[Beshte]] and Zito for [[Imara]]) He complains to Ma Tembo about letting her talk him into it before she hushes him. As the competition begins, Imara and Zito initially fall behind, but due to Beshte getting sunburned, they take the lead and win the first round.

== Relationships ==

=== Friends ===
[[Ma Tembo]]

Zito seems to have a great relationship with his leader Ma Tembo He helps out a lot the with his herd, and though he seems to get annoyed at some things, he still helps to save the day. Whenever Ma Tembo tells him to do something, he always does it. Zito respects Ma Tembo as a leader. 

[[Aminifu]]

Zito gathering his former leader has been passed away to gather flowers around him. He also remembers when he have poop on him and it always made him laugh.

[[Kion]]

In "[[The Kilio Valley Fire]]" Zito did get a little annoyed at Kion because of his home being destroyed by the fire. Kion tried to find the elephants a new home but none of the places seemed to be working, which annoyed Zito more. When Ndefu Grove was lit on fire, at first Zito didn't want to help, but when he learned that family is important, he comes to Kion's rescue and saves him from being crushed by a tree.

Zito gets very upset at her because she never finished his sunburst. Makini, however, makes more yellow paint by finding some yellow flowers. Unfortunately, the pollen in the paint that she used attracted bees. Zito forgives her once the bees are gone and they become close friends. 

[[Laini]]

At first, Zito had a fair amount of resentment towards Laini and her galagos, after they were unable to accommodate Zito and the rest of his herd in Ndefu Grove after a fire destroyed  their home.
