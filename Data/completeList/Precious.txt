[[File:Adorable_Precious.jpg|thumb]]Precious is a baby panda who appears in "[[Panda Excess]] ." She is dangerously adorable, meaning that, if anyone looks into her eyes and is hit by a heart kiss from her, they will be charmed and fall under her "adorable spell" and turning their eyes into hearts. The only way to get out of her spell is to get reminded that she has a family of her own.

==Appearance==
She is a white-ish colored panda with purple colored ears, arms, feet and heart patches on her eyes. Her eyes are colored blue. She wears a red collar with T.O.T.S. symbol and a white diaper with red trimming and bamboo pattern.
