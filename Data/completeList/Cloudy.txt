'''Cloudy''', also known as '''Experiment 320''', is an illegal [[Experiments|genetic experiment]] created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to depress others with constant rain. His one true place is raining on [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s produce at her [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit stand]], suggesting he may be one of her "cats".

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 320 was the 320th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to depress others with constant rain.

320 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At some point, 320 was presumably activated, captured, and named Cloudy.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Cloudy was seen early in the movie raining on [[Mrs. Hasagawa]]'s [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit]] as [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Cloudy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Cloudy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]," which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Cloudy is the only known experiment associated with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] that did not debut in the episode "[[Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats]]".
*While it is confirmed that Cloudy works with Mrs. Hasagawa, it remains unconfirmed whether Cloudy returns home with her from the [[Hasagawa Fruits|fruit stand]].
*Cloudy is one of three known limbless experiments, the other two being [[Slimy]] and [[Zap]].
*Cloudy, Zap, [[Remmy]], [[Welco]], and [[Shrink]] are the only known experiments that are always seen levitating.
**[[Phantasmo]] and [[Witch (Lilo & Stitch)|Witch]] primarily levitate but often possess objects or living beings to move by other means. [[Tickle-Tummy]] is also able to levitate, but has been seen bouncing as well.
