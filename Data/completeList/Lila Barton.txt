'''Lila Barton''' is a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character that appears in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', played by Imogen Poynton and Isabella Poynton, ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' and ''[[Hawkeye (series)|Hawkeye]]'' played by Ava Russo. 

Lila Barton is only daughter of [[Hawkeye|Clint Barton/Hawkeye]] and [[Laura Barton]]. She's the sister to [[Cooper Barton|Cooper]] and [[Nathaniel Barton]].

She lives at the Barton Family Farm with her family. Lila and her family are not in any government files, which is why the Barton Family Farm is used by [[Avengers|the Avengers]] as a place to hide and lay low.

In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Lila and her family have a  picnic outside their house with Clint and Lila practicing archery. Lila, alongside half of all life in the universe, later died at the hands of an [[Infinity Gauntlet]]-wielding Thanos; but was restored to life 5 years later, when the [[Hulk]] used the [[Infinity Stones]] that him and the Avengers retrieved from alternate timelines, to undo [[Thanos]]' work.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Lila was named "Nicole," named after Nick Fury and the youngest child of Barton family before she, along with her mother and siblings were murdered by Black Widow.
