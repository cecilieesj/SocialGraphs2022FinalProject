'''Stuart Minkus''' (often identified only by his last name only) was the epitome nerd that accompanied [[Cory Matthews|Cory]], [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]], and [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]] in elementary school.

==History==
*Had an enormous water gun for the highly-anticipated water fight in "On The Fence"
*Was noted for being very intelligent, as he was [[George Feeny|Feeny]]'s choice to attend the geography bee in "Killer Bee"
*Often assumed he and Topanga would end up as a couple, although that never happened.
*Was willed to disappear by Cory and Shawn at the end of "I Dream of Feeny" and wasn't seen for another 4 years.
*Accidentally discovered the secret of time travel at the end of one episode, only to discount it by saying "Nah."
*Was horribly shaken when Feeny asked the class a big question that had no true answer. When told he was wrong, Minkus stood up and went to the nurse.
*Appeared again in "Graduation", was upset because Cory, Topanga, and Shawn never spoke to him.
**When Cory asked him where he had been, he simply said in the other part of the school and gestured offscreen. He then called to [[Mr. Turner]], who hadn't been seen for a full season at that point.
