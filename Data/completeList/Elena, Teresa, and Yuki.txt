==Background==
===Personality===
Not much is known about their personalities because they are not focused on a whole lot. They obviously enjoy the art of hula dancing, since they attend a hula class along with [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]. While they are mostly mean toward [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], they are also kind to them as well, usually when Mertle is not around at all, so it's hard to tell whether they are nice or mean. It is actually implied several times that they may actually hate Mertle and only hang out with her because they don't want her to bully them. It is also shown that they wouldn't emotionally crush Lilo or remind her of being an orphan like Mertle does. However in "[[Shush (episode)|Shush]]", it is shown that even without Mertle, they can be bossy and dismissive, implying that Mertle somewhat keeps them in line

Of the three girls, Yuki has the most distinctive personality (albeit not by much), with her expressing an interest in ice hockey in a few episodes of [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the show]]. Teresa has also shown some glimpses of a personality, showing a drawing of a robot doing hula at the [[KaiƒÅulu Hale|hula halau]] in "[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]" and helping Mertle cheat in the Ohana-Rama trivia competition in "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]" through wireless voice communication and looking up answers on a laptop connected to the Internet. This could imply that she has an interest in technology.

==History==
They usually travel in a group with their leader Mertle, and seldom say anything other than a sarcastic "Yeah!" in unison when agreeing with whatever mean thing Mertle has just said about Lilo. It is often hinted that the three hula girls would probably actually like Lilo if Mertle didn't make them think that they didn't. They have even ditched Mertle to hang out with Lilo for a while, like in the episodes "[[Tank (episode)|Tank]]" and "[[Shush (episode)|Shush]]", and they seemed to have enjoyed their time with Lilo on both occasions up until sadly going right back to Mertle in the end for the sake of continuity. Also, in the episode "[[Mr. Stenchy (episode)|Mr. Stenchy]]", Elena says to Mertle, "Hey, there's Lilo! Should we invite her, too?", referring to one of their little tea parties at Mertle's house, and sounding as if she wouldn't mind having Lilo join them. In [[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]], when the hula girls have a meeting about what kind of things they should have for the May Day Festival, Lilo shares an idea about making their own costumes, and the girls including Mertle actually agreed with her idea. Also, when Mertle pointed out that Lilo's mother was not around to help her, one of the girls told her not to say that, showing that they may actually care for Lilo's feelings. When Lilo is given a picture of her mom, the girls come over to see, she shows them, and explains that she has a picture of her mom winning the contest when she was her age, they seem to have thought that Lilo's mom was actually pretty back when she was young, but it still doesn't seem to increase Mertle's interest since she may not even care that much for Lilo's loss, following Mertle saying that Lilo will never be like her mom in the contest, much to Lilo's frustration, leading the 2 girls getting in a fight. In [[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]], Lilo's friends are acting very nice to her in her dream especially Mertle, and admits that she's not weird at all as she just has a personality and hugs her, though they only act nice and treat her only because it's just her dream, so they'd still be teasing her in real life.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', [[Moses Puloki|Moses]] calls Teresa "Aleka" for some reason.
**According to Jess Winfield, one of the executive producers of ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', [[Disneytoon Studios]] (the producers of ''Lilo & Stitch 2'') came up with their own names for the hula girls, despite that Winfield and his producers already came up with and revealed their names in the show itself. Disneytoon apparently decided not to correct their film to maintain continuity with the series, resulting in several [[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch#Continuity issues|continuity issues]].
*In the intro sequence of the series, Yuki appears in two squares in the hula dance, with her image and movements mirrored to one another.
