{{Quote|It's sandwich day. Every Thursday I give Pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich...|[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]}}

'''Pudge''' is an unknown species of tropical fish who was first seen in the opening of ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' in the episode "[[Sinker (episode)|Sinker]]", and was mentioned in "[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]" and "[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]". [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] feeds him a peanut butter sandwich every Thursday because she believes Pudge controls the weather.

==Trivia==
*In a non-canon [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxmT-zQc1GQ deleted scene] from the first film, [[Stitch]] inadvertently caused Pudge to be killed by seagulls, and his body was buried by Lilo beside [[Mr. and Mrs. Pelekai|her parents]]' graves.
*Pudge also appears in ''[[Disney Friends]]''. If the DS system clock is set to a Thursday, it would be "Sandwich Day". Lilo will tell the player to give Stitch a peanut butter sandwich to throw. If Pudge catches it, the weather changes and the player is awarded a pin.
*In real life, it is not wise to feed fish sandwiches, peanut butter or otherwise.
