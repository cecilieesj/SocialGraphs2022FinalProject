According to Esteban, she was the most important leader in Avalor City. She has since become a member of the Grand Council of Avalor.
==Role in the Series==
Paloma makes her first appearances In "[[First Day of Rule]]" where she is shown to be very ambitious wanting to be in charge of all trade agreements. She also had many other demands when talking with [[Princess Elena]], wanting to talk with her after the ball.

Her first major role is in "[[Navidad]]". She first appears at Avalor Castle with [[Carmen and Julio]] to invite Elena to celebrate Navidad with them. Elena tells everyone that they will celebrate together. Seeing a chance to make money out of this, Doña Paloma agrees and invites everyone to her shop Viila Mercado for any last minute shopping. The success of this makes Doña Paloma greedy. So when Elena proposes a Navidad Parade, Doña Paloma is all for it and tells everyone the supplies they need is at her store. To ensure they buy as much as they can, Doña Paloma lies to each group by telling them Elena will pick the best one to lead the parade. This makes them buy as much as they can. Later Elena comes along and angrily informs her that her lie has ruined everything. Since she made a lot of money, Doña Paloma does not exactly care even after Elena tells her that Isabel's upset and offers her a deal, to Elena's disgust. When Elena starts leading a paranada, Doña Paloma tells her assistant to go sell the crowd stuff but her assistant, who is also disgusted with her greed, quits and goes to join the crowd. This makes Paloma realize her wrongdoings and she also joins the crowd.

In "[[Captain Mateo]]", she becomes Esteban's replacement in the Grand Council after he betrays Avalor and joins forces with [[Ash Delgado]]. She believes that Mateo should be made Captain of the Royal Guard, as you need magic to fight magic and a wizard in charge is required for Ash to be defeated.

In "[[Elena's Day Off]]", she aids Elena in planning for her coronation, taking on the role of the party planner. However, when everything is completed, Elena and [[Ixlan]] try to get her to relax as Elena did, despite her not knowing how to.

In "[[To Queen or Not to Queen]]", she serves as King Esteban's queen in an alternate reality created by [[Zuzo]] to help Elena realize her true destiny is to lead.

In "[[Coronation Day]]", Paloma continues to try to convince Elena to make her the new Chancellor, and is desperate to save her emporium when the [[Four Shades of Awesome]] attack Avalor. After everything is saved thanks to Elena and a fully redeemed Esteban, Doña Paloma reminds everyone they have a Queen to crown, and attends Elena's coronation. There, she gives her approval to Naomi when Elena names her Chancellor, and dances with Julio.

==Trivia==
*Paloma is almost always shown wearing a hat or some form of headgear. The only times she's appeared bareheaded were in [[Captain Mateo]] and [[Elena's Day Off]].
