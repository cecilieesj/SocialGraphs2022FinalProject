He is designed to use his high-pitched shriek to jam radar.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===
Experiment 202 was the 202nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hamsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to jam radar with his high-pitched shriek. 202 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 202's pod landing on a cliff face by a waterfall.

Later, 202's pod was accidentally moved by a frog off the ledge and into the waterfall, activating the experiment, which then flew off to cause trouble.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
At an unknown point after this, Experiment 202 was presumably captured and named Jam.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Jam, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Jam participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Jam is Experiment 202. However, in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'', his [[Experiment Pods|pod]] is labeled 455, a number taken by [[Mary (Lilo & Stitch)|Mary]], most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].
*Jam and [[Snooty]] are the only known experiments based on bats. Interestingly, they are both in the 2-series and purple. Additionally, they both share the same voice actor, [[Frank Welker]].
*Jam's pod color is red.
*Jam is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*Jam's wings appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab]]''.
