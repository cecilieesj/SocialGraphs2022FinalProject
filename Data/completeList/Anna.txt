{{Quote|For the first time in forever, nothing's in my way!|Anna|Frozen}}
'''Queen Anna of Arendelle''' (pronounced "AH-na") is the protagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2013]] animated feature film, ''[[Frozen]]'', and the deuteragonist of its [[2019]] [[Frozen II|sequel]]. She is the second-born daughter of [[King Agnarr]] and [[Queen Iduna]], the younger sister of [[Elsa|Elsa the Snow Queen]], and the contemporary ruler of [[Arendelle]]. During their childhood, an accident involving Elsa's magic created a rift between the two sisters, leaving Anna devoid of love for many years. Despite this, Anna remained big-hearted and optimistic, albeit socially awkward. When their estrangement incidentally triggers an eternal winter, Anna embarks on a perilous journey to save her kingdom and mend the broken bond between herself and her sister.

Three years after her adventure,<ref name=":1" /> a rekindled Anna and Elsa embark on another journey to confront the [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|elemental spirits]] of [[the Enchanted Forest]]. Upon their journey's end, Elsa chooses to remain in the forest as the fifth spirit, so she abdicates the throne, allowing Anna to be crowned Queen of Arendelle.

Anna is loosely based on Gerda, the female protagonist of the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fairy tale "''{{WikipediaLink|The Snow Queen}}''".

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Anna is more daring than graceful and, at times, can act before she thinks. But she's also the most optimistic and caring person you'll ever meet. She longs to reconnect with her sister Elsa, as they were close during their childhood. When Elsa accidentally unleashes a magical secret that locks the kingdom of [[Arendelle]] in an eternal winter, Anna embarks on a dangerous adventure to make things right. Armed with only her fearlessness, a never-give-up attitude and her faith in others, Anna is determined to save both her kingdom and her family.''

===Development===
[[File:Anna by Chad Stubblefield.jpg|thumb|left|A model of one of Anna's earlier designs by Chad Stubblefield.]]
In the earlier stages of the film's production, Anna's role was vastly different from that of the final project. Instead of being a princess, Anna was a peasant on a quest to have the Snow Queen help free her frozen heart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/frozen-elsa-originally-villain-2014-9|title=One Huge Change In The 'Frozen' Storyline Helped Make It A Billion-Dollar Movie|date=September 3, 2014|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|format=Article|publisher=''Business Insider''}}</ref> Not only that, she was of no relation to Elsa in these stages of the film's production. The filmmakers struggled to find the movie's heart through this version, finding it difficult to have a believable and engaging relationship between the two female leads when they truly have nothing to do with one another. However, one of the filmmakers suggested the two be made siblings, and things quickly changed from there. Anna was made a princess, as well as Elsa, who, in turn, went from a villain to a misunderstood heroine.

With these changes, the characters and story were viewed in a more relatable light, as Anna's main goal was to now win the acceptance and love of her older sister; something to which her voice actress Kristen Bell personally related.<ref name="story">The Story of ''Frozen'': Making a Disney Animated Classic</ref>

Notably, as seen in early animation footage, Anna wasn't always as daring and fearless as she is in the film. In the early test animation for the [[Marshmallow]] chase scene, Anna was seen reluctant when diving off the cliff with [[Kristoff]], only doing so at the fear of Marshmallow attacking. However, in the film, this isn't the case, and Anna is seen with immense excitement, engulfing herself in the thrill of the moment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://johnaugust.com/2014/scriptnotes-ep-128-frozen-with-jennifer-lee-transcript|title=Scriptnotes, Ep 128: Frozen with Jennifer Lee|date=February 1, 2014|format=Transcript|website=JohnAugust.com|last=August|first=John}}</ref>

One of Anna's early designs by Chad Stubblefield (pictured here on the page) revealed that Anna was originally planned to have platinum blonde hair but was changed to strawberry-blonde.

===Voice===
Anna's voice actress, [[Kristen Bell]], served as one of the prime inspirations for the character. The filmmakers, as well as Bell, wanted a heroine different from the trademark princesses of [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and [[Belle]]; one who was clumsy, socially awkward, and constantly spoke before she thought. Anna's supervising animator, Becky Bresee, noted she took much of Anna's animated movement from Bell's facial expressions and rhythm when she recorded the lines.<ref name="story" />

===Personality===
{{Quote|A character who is willing to stand beside you and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong.|[[Paul Briggs]]}}
Unlike her older sister Elsa, Anna is optimistic, energetic, awkward, perky, and generally far from elegant. She is also free-spirited, and has garnered an extrovert mentality after years of living within the confines of the castle gates without her sister's company. As a result, she is quick to make friends and craves affection and companionship, though this serves as potentially her greatest flaw, as she can sometimes be ''too'' trusting towards strangers - an issue brought to attention with the introduction of the malevolent [[Hans|Prince Hans]].

Anna's most valued asset and the true object of her affection is her relationship with her sister. Since childhood, Anna has been attached to Elsa and greatly admired her abilities, to which she saw as unique. Throughout most of the film, Anna is also the only individual to express faith that Elsa was not a monster. This is in contrast to the [[Duke of Weselton]], Kristoff, as well as the entirety of Arendelle's populace, who were all notably skeptical towards Elsa's benevolence, and feared at what she was capable of. Against all these odds, however, Anna remained hopeful, and fiercely assured that Elsa's true nature was gentle and caring; so much so, that she willingly threw herself into the dangerous terrains of the mountains to retrieve her sister from exile, only armed with the belief that the strength of their bond would be enough to motivate Elsa to return, which is example of Anna's powerful sense of hope and optimism. Anna relies on these traits to carry her through her hardships, and though she still faces overwhelming struggle, her buoyant mentality ultimately led to the restoration of both her kingdom's welfare, and the relationship with her sister.

It should be noted that despite her optimism, Anna also struggles with her self-confidence on occasion. The lack of explanation regarding her forced separation from Elsa would lead Anna to believe that ''she'' was the issue, and that Elsa simply wanted nothing to do with her. As time would go on, she would begin to fall into a state of mind that manifested itself into a need for love and companionship that would cause her trouble with Prince Hans. This would also explain why she is so quick to find romance, as "[[For the First Time in Forever]]" shows that she's looking for someone to act as her companion, no longer wanting to be alone. She also makes remarks such as "It's just me" and "No, I'm completely ordinary", which also indicates her low opinion of herself.

Anna also tends to act before she thinks, and can be rather impulsive and quick-tempered at times, which causes quite a bit of trouble. Throughout the film, she made several imprudent decisions as a result of this trait, such as accepting Hans' suspiciously hasty marriage proposal despite barely knowing him and provoking the beastly Marshmallow despite his ferocious size and power grossly outweighing her own. She can also be quite stubborn as she initially refused to accept the possibility that Hans was not her true love, despite the valid criticisms regarding the idea from Elsa and Kristoff, only coming to realize the truth once Olaf points out about how she has no idea on what true love is as well as how Kristoff really loves her when she is almost dying near the end of the first film. Furthermore, she repeatedly went against Kristoff's advisement (such as letting him face a pack of [[Wolves (Frozen)|wolves]] alone while she remained out of harm) throughout their adventure. Balancing this out is the fact that Anna is fearless, intelligent, quick-thinking, good in a crisis and highly skilled in self-defense, allowing her to overcome various challenges, including those caused by her own lack of impulse control. She held her own against Marshmallow (despite their difference in assets), a pack of wolves, and was solely responsible for the downfall of Hans.

In the end, despite her flaws, Anna is an extremely sweet, selfless, and loving character. Numerous times throughout the film, she puts the safety and well-being of others before her own, showing great loyalty and admiration for her friends and family. Though clumsy and comical, she has a strong sense of purity and heart, as well as fearlessness and good judgment in a crisis, which ultimately aids her in overcoming obstacles.

''[[Frozen Fever]]'' shows a much more mature side of Anna's personality. While excited over celebrating her birthday with Elsa, she spends the day more worried over Elsa's health and pushes her to rest, caring more about Elsa's health than her birthday highlighting her selflessness, especially after her sister almost falls off the clock tower. She also assures Elsa that she hasn't ruined her birthday, but also states that taking care of Elsa is the "''best birthday present ever''".

In ''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]'', Anna shows concern when Elsa feels bad about not having a holiday tradition and searches for one, which she finds in the attic. She takes charge and orders everyone to gather for a search and rescue when [[Olaf]] goes missing, demonstrating her leadership skills. Anna was also realized that her and Elsa's childhood memories of creating Olaf were her family's traditions as Anna kept giving Elsa Christmas gifts based on Olaf, which reminded her and Anna of their happy childhood and how much they still loved each other. This allowed Anna to accept that having the family and friends she has made as the greatest gift she's ever received.

In ''[[Frozen II]]'', Anna has shown to be a little more mature, though she still retains some aspects of her personality. She finds happiness in no longer being alone, having her sister back as well as Olaf, [[Sven]], Kristoff, and the gates open. Although no longer  rash and impulsive, she is also shown in wanting to connect more with her fellow Arendellians. Anna has also become very protective of Elsa, loving her life the way it is and not wanting to lose her sister again. She insists on accompanying Elsa through her journey and tries persuading her against too many dangerous choices, indirectly pushing Kristoff away in the process, something she realizes and apologizes to him for later. After the apparent 'deaths' of Elsa and Olaf, Anna breaks down since she is rendered virtually alone again, but she manages to pull herself together to fulfill Elsa's wish and destroy their [[King Runeard|grandfather]]'s [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] to lift the curse on [[the Enchanted Forest]]. She subsequently shows great leadership qualities in leading her fellow Arendellian soldiers in provoking the [[Earth Giants]] to destroy the dam, something which the forest's [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|spirits]] recognize and consequently allow Arendelle to stand because of Anna doing what was right for everyone. They and Elsa acknowledge Anna as a great and noble leader, also allowing Elsa to recognize that Anna is the best person to be queen of Arendelle. After Elsa's return, the resurrection of Olaf, and her engagement to Kristoff, Anna accepts that it's okay for her and her sister to separate so long as they maintain contact with one another. In the three years since the first movie, Anna has fully grown up as she becomes a responsible and cheerful queen who continues to look after the needs of Arendelle.

===Physical appearance===
At 18 years of age during the original film<ref name=":0">Lee, Jennifer (September 13, 2013). "''Frozen'' Final Shooting Draft", p. 13</ref> and 21 during ''Frozen II'',<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/frozen-2-time-jump-new-footage-disney/|title=Frozen 2 to Have 3-Year Time Jump, New Scene Details Revealed|date=June 14, 2019|website=ComicBook.com|last=Ridgely|first=Charlie|format=Article}}</ref> Anna has a slender build and fair skin. She has turquoise-blue eyes, rosy cheeks, thin pink lips, a small nose, long, strawberry-blonde hair, mostly tied into two braided pigtails, bangs down her forehead, and a light dusting of freckles (a trait that she shares with her sister Elsa, although due to being slightly older, Elsa appears to have fewer freckles than Anna); her face is also slightly rounder than Elsa's. When she wears sleeveless dresses, it is shown that she has some freckles on her shoulders in addition to the ones on her face. She has a platinum-blonde streak on the right side of her hair due to an accident in which she was struck by Elsa's magic during childhood. The platinum-blonde streak remained for years until the curse on Anna's frozen heart was broken and the streak was removed along with it.

All of her outfits have rosemaling, reflecting the movie's Norwegian setting.

In her coronation dress, Anna wears a black sweetheart bodice with dark green off-the-shoulder straps and rose, teal, blue, and purple prints on it, and has greenish-gold trim, a black satin-laced necklace with a bronze pendant of Arendelle's symbol, an olive drab pleated skirt with sashes consisting of the following: asparagus centers with pink, crimson, dark olive green, olive drab, and blueprints on it between cream sides and dark green pleats, both cream petticoat and frilly knee-length pantalettes, white stockings, and a pair of black ballet shoes. She wears her hair in a bun, and a part of her hair is braided and used as a headband, a green comb-shaped barrette with a couple of satin ribbons green and chartreuse attached to the back of her hair, and dark pink lipstick. She also wears a teal cape with a cyan bow as a clasp for the cape, a sapphire oval-cut hem with an azure line, blue dots on each cut, and small sapphire dots all around the cape.

The winter outfit that Anna acquires at [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna]] is a traditional Norwegian clothing called "Bunad". The design consists of a medium-length, dark blue skirt consisting of a lavender round-cut lining with points, with each rose and periwinkle print similar to a rose around the skirt on each point, and each periwinkle bush-like print on each of its round edges with a black bodice with gold trim and green, red, yellow, and purple rose prints on it, a light blue long-sleeved blouse, and black heeled leather boots with gold linings and magenta soles. She also wears a magenta bonnet with purple lining, lavender fluff, and matching white print on the back, a pair of blue mittens with navy blue palms, and a detachable magenta cape with a matching cap, purple linings, and small Byzantium tassels on the edge of the cape with a silver brooch consisting of a pair of hearts with gray prints attached to her cape and magenta lipstick. On occasion, she wears a pair of crystal clear ice skates.

After Anna's heart is frozen, her hair turns silvery-white. When she is thawed out, her hair returns to its original state without the platinum blonde streak.

In Anna's summer attire, her hair is once again braided in pigtails without her streak. She wears a timber wolf wrist-length blouse with light blue vertical linings, a pinafore dress consisting of both a light gray bodice with green linings, vertical gray hairlines, and four green buttons placed vertically on the bodice with black hairline laces attached, a dark gray skirt with a light gray lining, crimson, green, and lavender flower prints all around on it, and lavender, green, and olive drab bush-like prints between each flower prints. She also dons a white petticoat, a pair of matching heeled leather boots with gold linings and brown soles, the same color and shape of the brooch, and on occasion, the same color ice skates.

In ''[[Frozen Fever]]'', Anna wears her hair a bun but with a yellow sunflower and three ribbons hanging down (in the colors of dark green, light green, and teal) in the back. She wears a navy blue bodice which has olive, crimson, green, and orange prints on the front with copper linings, and a light chartreuse short-sleeved blouse that has a pink and gold brooch in the middle that turns purple and gold later on. On top of this, Anna wears an apple-green sleeveless cropped gilet with teal, dark green, brown, orange, and chartreuse rosemaling on the front and back. She wears a teal skirt with yellow, olive, and brown sunflower prints with darker teal stalks and leaves with smaller olive, dark teal, and purple designs between each sunflower, and a small dark teal leaf design on the left, middle part of the skirt. Above the sunflower is a wavy looping yellow line with light teal dots above each loop. She wears light olive stockings, pale olive-yellow petticoats, black ballet flats, a friendship bracelet, and dark pink lipstick. Elsa used her powers to change this dress by adding sunflowers to her bun and skirt using crystalline ice and creating a hidden ice petticoat to make the skirt more voluminous.

In ''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]'', Anna wears her hair in a bun for the majority of the special, but reverts to her standard braids when she and Elsa are leading the search for Olaf. Her attire is comprised of a sky blue dress with bells and goats patterned motif around the hemline, using the same fabric as the tablecloths in the ballroom.

At the beginning of the sequel, Anna wears a beige gown with kitten heels. Her hair is tied up in a bun with a piece of wheat on the side. Her hair is in her usual braids, and she wears a lime green nightgown when playing charades with Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven. During their travels to the Enchanted Forest, Anna wears a purple and magenta long vest and a black long-sleeved dress with gold trim, a brown belt around her waist, and gold pants underneath. She accessorizes with long black boots and a gold cross pendant. She later removes the vest during her travels in the cavern and luring the Earth Giants to destroy the dam.

As Queen of Arendelle, Anna wears her hair in a bun similar to that of her mother and Elsa when she was crowned queen in the first film and wears a black shirt with buttons to close it, a tropical rain forest dress with mint green trim, and a teal cape with a purple underside. She also wears a tiara similar to the one her sister wore.

===Abilities===
{{Quote|We know what her superpower is: her superpower is love! She saves the day with love.|Chris Buck}}
Unlike Elsa, Anna was born without magic and lacks any sort of enchanted abilities; she relies solely on fearlessness and optimism to guide her through perilous situations. According to directors [[Jennifer Lee]] and [[Chris Buck]], Anna's "super power" is the strength and purity of her loving heart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/hitfix/frozen-directors-christopher-buck-jennifer-lee-talk-love-fear-and-fan-theories/|title='Frozen' Directors Christopher Buck & Jennifer Lee Talk Love, Fear, And Fan Theories|last=Dickens|first=Donna|date=March 18, 2014|website=Uproxx}}</ref> Because the love she harbored for her sister was so powerful, Anna managed to successfully navigate through a death-defying journey through the Norwegian wilderness, facing off against cursed weather conditions, supernatural beings, and the elements of nature, itself. It was her devotion towards Elsa, and refusal to view the latter as a villain, that would ultimately lead to the resurrection of their familial bond, Elsa's total control of her powers through love, and the salvation of the kingdom of Arendelle.

Quite notably, however, Anna has exhibited examples of above-average physical strength and has proven herself to be quite powerful in this regard; she doesn't seem to notice, as she has accidentally caused physical pain to characters such as Kristoff (when she nonchalantly threw a bag of carrots to the mountain man, but with far more force than intended) and Olaf (when she made an attempt to gently insert his carrot nose onto his face, only to jab it in forcefully and giving the snowman a "head rush" by mistake) as a result of underestimating her own strength. During "For the First Time in Forever", she was seen dancing with and subsequently flinging a bust with ease. During a wolf attack, she held her own, using Kristoff's lute to smack one of the wolves away from the sled - which had brutal results for the wolf. The most noteworthy example of Anna's physical capacity is perhaps following the film's climax, where the princess punched the traitorous Prince Hans off a ship, with a substantial amount of force strong enough to send the prince flying off of his feet.

In addition to her physical strength, Anna is also shown to be very fast and agile. During "[[The Next Right Thing]]", Anna was able to leap from separate ledges several feet apart. She was also able to outmaneuver the Earth Giants, although she was nearly crushed before being rescued by Kristoff. While in the first movie Anna had difficulty climbing she was shown to be able to climb well in the sequel.

Anna also has an incredible amount of endurance in harsh winter conditions, as she was able to navigate through post-blizzard terrains with a simple cloak and ball gown for over twenty-four hours or so, without too much negative effect other than some initial discomfort towards the unexpected cold. Following the purchase of her winter gear, she seemed entirely unaffected by the weather and only fell into the danger of freezing to death due to the frozen curse accidentally placed upon her heart by Elsa in the midst of her journey, as its power froze the princess from the inside out. As a young child, she was also unaffected by the snow figures she and Elsa played with in the enchanted forest she made with her ice magic (barefoot, no less).

[[File:YoungAE.jpg|thumb|250px|Young Anna and Elsa enjoying themselves in Elsa's snowy wonderland.]]
At a young age, at Anna's behest, she and [[Elsa]] would spend much of their time using the latter's powers for their own enjoyment, against their parents' wishes. One night, five-year-old Anna<ref>Lee, Jennifer (September 13, 2013). "''Frozen'' Final Shooting Draft", p. 2</ref> suggests they build a snowman, to which eight-year-old Elsa agrees. The sisters head into the castle's throne room and create a winter field of snow. During their playdate, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the head with her magic, rendering her unconscious and turning a streak of her hair platinum blonde. Horrified, Elsa calls their parents, [[King Agnarr]] and [[Queen Iduna]], for help. Iduna and Agnarr travel with their daughters to the [[Valley of the Living Rock]], where they request the assistance of magical [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]] led by a shaman named [[Grand Pabbie|Pabbie]]. Pabbie is able to save Anna by cleansing her body of all magic, including memories of magic. Though this leaves Anna with no recollection of Elsa's powers, Agnarr declares that it's for the best.

[[File:Frozen-disneyscreencaps.com-819.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]"]]
Pabbie advises that the royal family take precaution with Elsa's powers as they can be extremely dangerous if not controlled. For the safety of his daughters and people, Agnarr forces Elsa into isolation by closing off the [[Arendelle Castle|castle]] and separating her from Anna, who remains oblivious as to why life in the castle has changed. Over the years, Anna makes repeated attempts to reach out to Elsa, but to no avail. To keep herself occupied in spite of her loneliness, Anna would spend most of her time running through the castle halls and talking to paintings. During Anna and Elsa's teenage years, Agnarr and Iduna lost their lives at sea when their ship was struck by monstrous waves. The news devastated Anna, who attended her parents' funeral alone. With no family left besides her sister, Anna made another attempt to reconnect with Elsa to no response. With Elsa refusing to leave her room due to the instability of her powers, both sisters were forced to cope with the loss of their parents, alone.

[[File:Lisa Swing Painting Part 2.jpg|thumb|250px|"[[For the First Time in Forever]]"]]
Three years later, Elsa had finally come of age and is ready to be crowned Queen of Arendelle. To celebrate the occasion, the windows, doors, and gates of the castle were opened for the first time in years. Foreign dignitaries are also invited to the festivities, with such kingdoms as [[the Southern Isles]] and [[Weselton]] sending representatives in honor of their countries. An excited 18-year-old Anna<ref name=":0" /> sees this as an opportunity to explore the outside world and find the companionship she has been devoid of for years, preferably, in the form of "true love." The second the gates are finally opened, Anna rushes out and explores her kingdom, roaming about the streets and catching glimpse of all the visitors. Suddenly, she bumps into [[Sitron|a horse]] owned by the dashing [[Hans|Prince Hans]] of the Southern Isles. Though initially angered by the clumsiness of the stranger, Anna quickly becomes smitten with Hans's charm and good looks. After introducing themselves, Anna and Hans become acquainted, and apparently hit it off, only to be interrupted by the coronation bells.

[[File:Frozen-disneyscreencaps.com-2471.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna and Elsa at the coronation ball.]]
At the [[Arendelle Chapel|chapel]], Anna stands by her sister's side during the crowning (where she shares a cute wave with Hans). Afterwards, a ball is held in honor of the new queen. Anna and Elsa stand side by side in the ballroom, watching over the crowd. To Anna's surprise and delight, Elsa initiates a conversation, allowing the sisters to bond for the first time in years. They are interrupted by their steward [[Kai (Frozen)|Kai]], who introduces the snide [[Duke of Weselton]]. When the Duke offers Elsa her first dance as queen, Elsa mischievously volunteers Anna instead. Anna is dragged onto the dance floor, where she is subjected to the Duke's over-the-top dance skills, much to Elsa's amusement. Afterwards, Anna and Elsa laugh about the matter, with Anna openly wishing their lives could always be carefree. With regret, Elsa declares that it cannot, but refuses to explain why. Feeling rejected, Anna excuses herself from the party.

[[File:Frozen-disneyscreencaps.com-3138.jpg|thumb|250px|Anna looking in confusion and shock as Elsa flees the ballroom as a result of her powers being revealed.]]
As she walks off, Anna bumps into Hans once again, who takes the princess out on a romantic date around the city. Anna falls in love with Hans, and the night ends with a proposal from Hans. Anna immediately agrees, and the newly engaged couple return to the ballroom to ask for Elsa's blessing. Elsa refuses, telling Anna that she can't marry a stranger. This leads to a heated argument between the sisters, which climaxes with Anna questioning why Elsa coldly shuts out her family and the world. Anna's prying triggers Elsa's anxieties, causing the queen to inadvertently unleash her powers upon Anna and their guests. Horrified by what she's done, Elsa flees the ballroom. Despite her confusion, Anna follows behind in an attempt to stop her sister. Elsa escapes into the fjords and unknowingly places a curse that traps Arendelle in an eternal winter. As snow flurries fill the sky, the Duke of Weselton goes into a panic, exclaiming that Elsa must be apprehended. Claiming responsibility for Elsa's departure and the curse, Anna makes it her mission to find Elsa and save the kingdom. With Hans in charge in her absence, Anna leaves the castle on horseback, searching for her sister.

[[File:Hr Frozen 11.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna meeting Kristoff (not exactly love at first sight).]]
Hours later, Anna loses her horse in the middle of the woods and accidentally ruins her clothes by falling into freezing water. Fortunately, she stumbles upon a humble [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna|establishment]] owned by the equally humble [[Oaken]], who happens to have one winter outfit in stock. Just as she's about to purchase her new outfit, a rugged mountain man named [[Kristoff]] arrives and tells Oaken that the source of the harsh weather is [[the North Mountain]]. Anna deduces that Elsa is somewhere along the North Mountain, but before she can get more information, Kristoff is booted from the shop for insulting Oaken. Anna pays for Kristoff's unpaid gear to coerce the mountain man into guiding her to the North Mountain. Though reluctant at first, Kristoff eventually agrees. Anna loads up with Kristoff and his reindeer sidekick, [[Sven]], and the trio embark on their quest to find Elsa that same night.

[[File:Meeting Olaf.jpg|thumb|250px|Meeting Olaf the Snowman.]]
Along the way, Kristoff inquires Elsa's reasoning for covering the land in eternal winter, and Anna explains the situation with Hans. The cynical Kristoff calls Anna out, finding it ridiculous that she became engaged to someone she met that same day. Before their conversation continues, however, the trio are attacked by savage wolves. Fortunately, they're able to escape the pack, but the only bit of cargo to make it out of the chaos are Sven's carrots. Kristoff's [[Kristoff's Sled|sled]], and most of everything in it is destroyed. Feeling guilty, Anna offers him a new sled and gear, and allows him to return home if he so chooses. Knowing Anna would die on her own, Kristoff and Sven choose to stick by her side, much to Anna's relief. By the time morning hits, Kristoff starts to doubt Elsa's morality, but Anna remains confident that Elsa will end the winter. Upon entering a grove, they encounter an [[Olaf|enchanted snowman]] created by Elsa. Anna is initially terrified, but simmers down upon realizing that he's harmless. The snowman introduces himself as Olaf, the same snowman that Anna and Elsa built as kids. He explains that Elsa brought him to life and that he knows her whereabouts: an [[Elsa's Ice Palace|ice palace]].

[[File:Beware The Frozen Heart.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna in agony after her heart's accidentally been frozen by Elsa.]]
Upon arriving at the palace, Anna is stunned by the sheer beauty of Elsa's powers. Wanting alone time with her sister, Anna advises Kristoff and Olaf to wait outside before anxiously entering the palace. Inside, Anna apologizes for the coronation incident and asks Elsa to return home. Believing her people are safer without her, Elsa refuses and encourages Anna to return to Arendelle, where she can enjoy the sun and open gates. To that, Anna reveals that Arendelle is trapped in an enteral winter caused by Elsa's magic. Despite Anna's confidence that they can solve the problem together, Elsa goes into another panic attack and loses control of her powers. She accidentally strikes Anna once again, but this time, in the heart. With neither sister realizing the danger, Anna continues with her persistence, but Elsa remains firm on her decision and orders Anna to leave for her own safety. When Anna refuses, Elsa creates a hulking snowman to remove Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf from the palace.

[[File:Frozenheartpabbie.jpg|thumb|250px|Anna and Kristoff's meeting with Pabbie.]]
The snow monster (named [[Marshmallow]] by Olaf) chases the friends out and away from the palace, warning them not to come back. After reaching safety, Anna's hair begins to turn white, and Kristoff deduces the cause to be Elsa's magic. Kristoff leads the gang to the Valley of the Living Rock, to seek aid from the trolls. Kristoff's adoptive mother, [[Bulda]], assumes Anna to be her son's girlfriend; when the two deny any romance, Bulda and the trolls try to convince them otherwise, going as far as to set up a troll wedding. Before things go any further, Anna loses balance as the curse becomes stronger. They learn from Pabbie that Anna was struck in the heart by Elsa and can only be saved by "an act of true love." Should she fail, Anna will turn to solid ice and die. Bulda believes the "act of true love" would be "a true love's kiss." With this in mind, Kristoff escorts Anna back to Arendelle to receive a kiss from Hans. Meanwhile, Hans fears that Anna has been away for too long and might be in trouble. Under his command, a search party is set out. Though they fail to find Anna, Hans and his army are able to apprehend Elsa and take her back to Arendelle as a prisoner.

[[File:Hansbetrayel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hans taunting Anna after revealing his dark nature.]]
Later, Anna and her friends arrive in the kingdom. Kristoff leaves Anna in the care of the castle servants and accepts that she no longer needs him. Inside the castle, Anna reunites with Hans and hastily warns him of Elsa's curse. She pleads for a "true love's kiss", but Hans refuses, revealing that he never really loved Anna. While extinguishing all the warmth in the room to quicken Anna's death, Hans explains that his real desire was to marry into the throne and become king of Arendelle. Now, Hans plots to use Anna's impending death to prosecute Elsa and sentence her to execution. Anna tries to stop him, but Hans locks her inside the room and leaves her to die. Afterward, Hans announces Anna's death at the hands of Queen Elsa. He also claims that he and Anna married just before she died in his arms, leaving Arendelle in his hands. With Hans in control of the throne, Elsa is charged with treason and sentenced to death. Before the execution can be carried out, Elsa escapes her cell. Her anxieties trigger a whiteout that encapsulates all of Arendelle and threatens to destroy the castle. Kristoff and Sven notice the storm from a distance and rush back to the kingdom to save Anna.

[[File:Frozenheartanna.jpg|thumb|250px|Anna's frozen body.]]
Back in the castle, Anna is found by Olaf, who quickly lights a fire to keep Anna alive. Olaf contemplates their next step, but a crestfallen Anna loses hope as she doesn't even know what love is. Olaf explains that love is "putting someone else's needs before yours." He uses Kristoff as an example, revealing that the mountain man is in love with Anna. Reinvigorated, Anna uses her remaining strength to escape the castle to find Kristoff, while her home is overtaken by Elsa's storm. With Olaf's help, Anna makes it into the fjord, but the curse only worsens the farther she goes. Not too far away, Hans confronts Elsa. He reveals that Anna died of a frozen heart despite his "efforts" to save her and places the blame on Elsa. Devastated, Elsa breaks down in tears, which ends the whiteout. No longer blinded by the blizzard, Anna and Kristoff finally spot each other. As Anna slowly makes her way towards Kristoff, she hears a sword being drawn a short distance away. In horror, she realizes that Hans is preparing to kill Elsa. After one last look at Kristoff, Anna sacrifices herself by lunging between Elsa and Hans and blocking the latter's blow just as her body freezes solid, killing her. The shockwave caused by her curse knocks Hans off his feet.

[[File:Anna and Elsa embrace.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna and Elsa's embrace, following Anna's revival.]]
Upon seeing her sister's lifeless body, Elsa breaks down in tears. Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven arrive shortly afterward and mourn the loss of the princess, as Arendelle's onlooking populace does the same. Fortunately, Anna's sacrifice for Elsa has constituted an act of true love, thus breaking her curse and thawing her frozen heart. Anna and Elsa embrace and profess their love for each other. With help from Olaf, Elsa comes to realize that love is the key to controlling her powers. As Anna watches in amazement, Elsa frees Arendelle from its eternal winter, effectively restoring peace to the kingdom. Hans, meanwhile, regains consciousness and is shocked to find Anna alive. Anna calmly confronts him before fiercely punching him in the face and knocking him into the fjord. Anna and Elsa share another hug, and as the sisters embrace, Anna looks lovingly to Kristoff, showing that she reciprocates his romantic affections.

[[File:Elsa-anna-final-scene.png|thumb|250px|"I like the open gates."]]
Following these events, Elsa reclaims her position as queen. Under her command, Hans and the Duke of Weselton are deported, while Kristoff is dubbed the "Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer". Anna also buys Kristoff a new sled and presents it to him as a surprise (with help from Sven). Kristoff is delighted to the point of wanting to kiss Anna, though he quickly regrets admitting as much. Anna nevertheless accepts, and the two cement their relationship by sharing their first kiss. At the castle courtyard, Elsa permanently reopens the castle gates and invites her subjects to enjoy a newly-created ice skating rink. Anna joins in the festivities and is touched by Elsa's vow to never close the gates again. Joined by Olaf, Kristoff, Sven, the sisters indulge in a kingdom-wide celebration honoring their reunion and a new era for Arendelle.

===''[[Frozen Fever]]''===
[[File:Anna frozen fever .jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna in ''Frozen Fever''.]]
It is Anna's 19th birthday in the animated short, and Elsa has plans to make it absolutely perfect in hopes of rectifying the hardened past the sisters were forced to endure. Within the castle, Anna oversleeps but is soon awakened by an elated Elsa. Explaining her plans to make her sister's birthday an enjoyable, memorable one, Elsa bestows her first gift; a new dress, embodying the bright, colorful aura of spring. Once fully dressed, Elsa leads Anna throughout the castle and kingdom, following a trail of string with various checkpoints leading to several gifts: a clock, flowers, a bracelet, a fishing pole, and more. As Anna happily follows her elder sister, she notices her sneezing and sniffling and takes note that medical attention is in need of providing. Nevertheless, Elsa assures her she's fine, and the day continues.

With time, however, Elsa falls into a delirious haze. After leading Anna to the top of the city's clock tower at the end of the string, Elsa nearly falls off the ledge, only to be rescued by Anna, who decides to put the day on hold in order to care for her sister.

With Elsa finally admitting she has a cold, the sisters return to the castle as Elsa apologizes to Anna for ruining her perfect birthday, to which Anna assures that Elsa didn't ruin it (despite having a cold), and she just needs to rest in bed. They then enter through the castle gates, only to find Olaf, Kristoff, Sven, and several citizens, as well as miniature [[Snowgies|baby snowmen]], within the courtyard and announcing a surprise party. Ecstatic, Anna is greeted by her guests and receives her birthday cake from a loving Kristoff.

Following a spectacular birthday celebration, Anna helps Elsa to bed and thanks her for the most wonderful day and the best birthday present she could ever ask for which is Elsa letting her take care of her.

===''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]''===
[[File:Olaf's-Frozen-Adventure-35.png|thumb|250px|Anna in ''Olaf's Frozen Adventure''.]]
{{Quote|[giggles] I'm excited, too, Olaf. This '''is''' Arendelle's first Christmas in forever.|Anna to [[Olaf]] about everyone's first Christmas}}
In the featurette, it is the first holiday season after the castle gates have reopened. To commemorate the occasion and "[[Ring in the Season|ring in the season]]", Anna and Elsa plan a surprise Christmas party for Arendelle's people, though the two sisters soon come to realize that their own family lacks traditions. Olaf, meanwhile, makes it his mission to find a holiday tradition for the sisters to share. Anna searches the attic for some traditions and finds a box full of gifts she gave Elsa during their years of separation. When Olaf goes missing, her sister Elsa orders the citizens of Arendelle to conduct a search party and aids in the search. Olaf is found and Anna admits that they had a tradition all along, which was the gifts inside the box. The sisters both treasured the artwork because it reminded them of their childhood and of how much they loved each other, leading Olaf to realize that he is their tradition. Later, Elsa uses her magic to create a sparkling ice Christmas tree and decorates it with lanterns from the search party. Elsa and Anna are happy and grateful to be with family and friends. Elsa looks around and thinks Arendelle has a new tradition, to which Anna agrees and thanks Olaf for the help.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
[[File:Ralph Breaks the Internet 141.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna with Pocahontas and Moana in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''.]]
In ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'', Anna is a netizen who lives and works in [[Oh My Disney]] as a [[cast member]] where she and the other Disney princesses meet and greet their fans. When [[Vanellope von Schweetz|Vanellope]] glitches into the princesses' dressing room to hide from the [[First Order Stormtroopers]], Anna is seen talking with Elsa and [[Moana (character)|Moana]]. When the princesses mistake Vanellope for a threat, they charge at her with various weapons; Anna is the only princess shown without a weapon, instead opting to use her fists (a reference to when she punched Hans). Vanellope explains that she is also a princess, which surprises Anna and prompts [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]] to ask what kind of princess she is. Anna, [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]], [[Merida]], and Moana are the only ones who do not ask Vanellope a question. When [[Jasmine]] asks Vanellope if she has "daddy issues", she notes that she does not have a mom, to which Anna and Elsa relate.

After declaring Vanellope an official princess they admire her "gown" and change into comfortable modern clothes. Anna wears a green flannel shirt with a black top with a graphic of a sandwich which reads "[[Love is an Open Door|FINISH EACH OTHER'S]]", blue jean shorts, and black-and-white sneakers and is seen lounging next to [[Tiana]] while eating a bag of potato chips. Before Vanellope leaves, Merida tries to give her advice in an unintelligible Scottish accent which confuses Vanellope, and she asks the princesses what Merida said and they explain that they cannot understand Merida with Anna adding that she is from "[[Pixar|the other studio]]".

In the climax of the film, Anna and the princesses witness [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] about to fall to his death from the Google tower and work together to save him. Anna and [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] help [[Jaq and Gus]] sew two of the princesses' discarded dresses to [[Rapunzel]]'s [[Rapunzel's Magic Hair|magic hair]] to use as parachutes. After Ralph is saved, the princesses introduce themselves as friends of Vanellope and befriend Ralph as well.

In this film, Anna still retains the platinum-blonde streak on the right side of her hair as seen at the start of the original ''Frozen'' film.

===''[[Frozen II]]''===
[[File:Anna in Frozen 2.jpeg|thumb|250px|Anna happy with her life.]]
Three years after her adventures in the mountains, the now 21-year-old<ref name=":1" /> Anna is happier than ever with her now peaceful life in Arendelle. With the gates open, and Elsa, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf by her side, Anna feels that she is no longer alone. Despite the positivity, Anna notices a dwindle in Elsa's mood, especially after seeing Elsa wearing their late mother's [[Iduna's Scarf|shawl]]. Anna is seemingly able to comfort her sister, but some time later, she is awakened by an assault on the kingdom, led by the four elements of [[Earth Giants|earth]], [[Gale|wind]], [[Bruni|fire]], and [[The Nokk|water]]. The sisters evacuate their subjects to the cliffs as Arendelle is stripped of its resources, where Elsa confesses that she awakened the [[Spirits of the Enchanted Forest|spirits]] of [[the Enchanted Forest]] because of a mysterious voice that's been calling to her. Anna confronts her sister on keeping secrets again, but she nevertheless trusts Elsa's hunch that the voice is calling for a good reason.

[[File:Frozen II (46).png|thumb|left|250px|Anna vows to protect Elsa at all costs.]]
Grand Pabbie soon arrives with his rock trolls, and informs the sisters that the spirits are upset due to a past offense. If the problem is not rectified, he foresees no future for Arendelle. Elsa determines that she must find the voice in order to save her kingdom, but Anna insists on tagging along. Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven do as well, much to Elsa's frustration. Before they depart, Grand Pabbie voices his concern for Elsa with how much stronger her powers have gotten since they last saw each other, but Anna ensures that she won't let anything happen to her sister. Pabbie also assures that he will watch over the people of Arendelle until Elsa and Anna return from pacifying the spirits and ending their rage.

The party embarks on their journey to the Enchanted Forest, and along the way, Kristoff awkwardly tries to propose to Anna. Anna mistakes Kristoff's fumbling for rejection, but before they can talk any further, they arrive at the forest. Before entering, Elsa promises that the sisters will accomplish the mission together, per Anna's request.

Soon after entering the Enchanted Forest, the group is ambushed by the wind spirit, Gale, in the form of a tornado. After Elsa uses her powers to save Anna from being hit by flying debris, the wind spirit focuses on her and expels the others. Elsa is able to quell the wind spirit (whom Olaf names Gale), and the result of combining their powers creates several sculptures of the past because "water has memory".

Shortly afterwards the group runs into the [[Royal Guards (Frozen)|Arendelle Royal Guards]] and the Northuldra tribe led by [[Yelana]] who are still at war with each other and blame the other for the fight leading to their imprisonments. After Anna unintentionally points an ice sword made from one of the statues at a familiar looking soldier, Elsa uses her powers to keep the two groups from attacking them. After recovering from their shock, Olaf recaps the first movie and recent events before Anna recognizes the Arendellians' leader as [[Lieutenant Mattias]], King Agnarr's former bodyguard.

The site is soon attacked by the Fire Spirit, and Elsa uses her powers to put out its flames (and saves Anna from suffocating after she runs into the flames). Elsa tames the spirit, an agitated fire salamander, and names it "Bruni". After the Northundra recognize their mother's [[Iduna's Scarf|scarf]] as Northuldran-made, the two princesses realize their mother was the Northuldran girl who saved their father's life, ceasing conflict between the two groups as the Northuldra sing "[[Vuelie]]" and welcome the royal sisters into their tribe, and Elsa promises to find the truth of the past and free the forest, despite Anna's concern at how big that promise is that Elsa needs to keep.

[[File:Frozen II (48).jpg|thumb|250px|Anna and Olaf in Earth Giant territory.]]
Before they leave, Anna finds that Kristoff had run off to deal with matters of his own. Believing this to be another sign of rejection, Anna chooses to leave Kristoff behind for the sake of protecting Elsa. The sisters are guided by Bruni and Gale to the shipwreck of their parents, washed ashore from the Dark Sea. There, they find a note explaining that the monarchs were searching for [[Ahtohallan]] to find answers about Elsa's magic. Elsa, knowing that sending Anna and Olaf with her would upset the balance between both worlds and that it's too risky for both of them, declares that she must journey to Ahtohallan alone to find the voice. Anna insists on joining Elsa to protect her from Ahtohallan's curse and reminded her of their mother's song, "Go too far and you'll be drowned", but Elsa instead sends Anna and Olaf off on an iceboat to keep them out of danger, infuriating both the princess and Olaf. Anna and Olaf find themselves in the Earth Giants' territory but are able to escape through a dark cave while avoiding waking them up.

[[File:Do the next right thing.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Anna chooses to do the next right thing.]]
While trying to find a way out, Anna and Olaf are greeted by an ice sculpture created by Elsa, which depicts their grandfather, [[King Runeard]], attacking the unarmed Northuldra leader from behind while he was completely unaware of Runeard preparing to execute him. Anna realizes that Runeard's [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] was a ruse to wipe out the Northuldra, and that he was responsible for the war that angered the spirits. Anna realizes that, in order to break the curse, she must destroy the dam, which would inevitably flood all of Arendelle. Olaf is able to comfort Anna by finding an exit from the cave, but before they can leave, the magic in Olaf begins to flurry away. Olaf deduces that this is because Elsa had fallen under Ahtohallan's curse and died, thus resulting in his own demise as her magic was now defunct. With Elsa, Olaf, and Kristoff gone, Anna feels lost, but she forces herself to move forward and do what's right: destroy the dam, for the sake of everyone. Anna summons the Earth Giants and lures them to the dam when they come after her for disturbing their sleep. With the help of Kristoff and Mattias, Anna is able to get the giants to toss boulders at the structure, destroying it and lifting the curse.

[[File:The new queen of Arendelle.jpg|thumb|250px|Anna as the new ruler of Arendelle.]]
With the dust settled, Anna apologizes to Kristoff for leaving him behind, allowing the two to reconcile. Anna remains crestfallen at the loss of Elsa, however, but is suddenly led to the fjord by Gale, where Elsa stands as the fifth spirit of the forest—the bridge that connects the magic of nature and people, having been brought back to reunite with Anna by [[the Nokk]]. Elsa explains that Arendelle had been spared by the spirits thanks to Anna's selfless act. Elsa also declares that Anna, herself, is also the fifth spirit—as a bridge has two sides and their mother had two daughters. Olaf is revived by Elsa's magic, thereafter, and with their family reunited, Kristoff finally musters up the courage to propose to Anna. In tears, Anna accepts, becoming newly engaged. Now knowing where she truly belongs, Elsa remains behind to protect the Enchanted Forest with the Northuldra, while Anna is crowned the new Queen of Arendelle, with Kristoff, Olaf, Sven, and Mattias by her side. At the kingdom square, Anna and Mattias jointly unveil a statue of Agnarr and Iduna, the Arendellian and Northuldra, symbolizing the love and unity between the two sides. Despite her new role as sovereign, Anna continues to make time for her family, and hosts charade nights at the castle, which Elsa always attends.

===Other appearances===
Along with Elsa, Anna makes a small cameo in the animated mini-series ''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]'', in the episode "Little Birds, Frost and Pine", happily building Olaf with her sister in the woods.

While not physically present, the fact that Arendelle is in quarantine in the song ''[[I Am with You]]'' strongly suggests that she placed the kingdom under a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order stay-at-home/safer-at-home order] to protect her subjects from the novel coronavirus.

Anna also makes a very brief appearance alongside Elsa, Olaf, and Sven in an advertisement promoting [[Sky Movies Disney|Sky Movies]], where she is seen on the television after the commercial's host family come back into the real world.

An emoticon version of Anna appeared in the ''Frozen'', ''Frozen Fever'' and ''Olaf's Frozen Adventure'' entries of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.

An otter version of Anna appeared on the cover of [[Duke Weaselton]]'s bootleg copy of ''[[Frozen II|Floatzen 2]]'' in the film ''[[Zootopia]]''.

In ''[[Frozen: Northern Lights#Shorts|LEGO Frozen Northern Lights]]'', Anna wants to learn why the northern lights have mysteriously vanished from Arendelle's night sky. She does so by assembling Elsa, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf on a quest to seek Grand Pabbie for answers. Over the course of the adventure, Anna proves to be the most level-headed and capable of the team.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 4x06 - Family Business - Photography - Anna.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Anna appeared in the fourth season of ''Once Upon a Time'' alongside Elsa and Kristoff. She appears in 9 episodes, and is portrayed by Elizabeth Lail.
In a time frame set two years after the events equivalent to the events of ''Frozen'' and approximately a year before the first Dark Curse in the general ''Once'' timeline, Anna is engaged to Kristoff. In honor of the momentous occasion, Elsa grants Anna both a beautiful new necklace and a gown originally owned by their deceased mother. As Anna tries on the dress, Elsa discovers their mother's diary. Within the text, it is revealed the king and queen left Arendelle because of Elsa. While Elsa believes it's because they feared her and saw her as a monster, Anna believes otherwise. To prove the true reason, Anna takes Elsa to Grand Pabbie. Pabbie is unable to uncover the exact reason the king and queen left, but reveals where they were heading; a land known as Mist Haven. While Elsa still worries, Anna stays positive and suggests they travel to Mist Haven to find out the truth for themselves. Reluctant about the idea, Elsa denies, claiming she doesn't want to abandon her kingdom and fears Hans and his brothers will strike should they leave Arendelle. Unable to convince her sister to tag along and grant permission, Anna secretly boards a ship and travels to Mist Haven, herself, in hopes of finding the truth to their parents' mysterious journey.

After arriving in the [[Enchanted Forest]] (Mist Haven), Anna encounters [[The Prince|David]], as well as the infamously powerful sorcerer, [[Rumplestiltskin]], who play crucial roles in her quest.

At sometimes afterward, Anna arrives home and reunites with Kristoff. She informed Kristoff that her parents did travel to the Enchanted Forest out of fear of Elsa, and they seek to use a box that contains the [[Sorcerer Hat|sorcerer's magical hat]] to rid Elsa of her powers. When Kristoff asked how she is going to break this to Elsa, Anna says she has no idea what to tell her elder sister.

When she reunites with Elsa, Anna instead lied about her discovery, claiming their parents didn't find what they seek when they traveled to the Enchanted Forest. To her surprise, she discovered that Elsa has more control over her snow/ice magic. Even more surprising is when Elsa introduced her to [[Ingrid|Ingrid the Snow Queen]], their maternal aunt, who also possesses exactly the same abilities. Despite Elsa's claim that Ingrid was a relative of theirs, Anna was suspicious, since their aunt isn't in any of the family's portrait or records. After sharing this revelation with Kristoff, Anna decides to visit Grand Pabbie again to find out their family's secret involving Ingrid. When Kristoff discusses Anna's decision to withhold the truth from Elsa, concerning what her parents did in the Enchanted Forest, Anna decides to keep hiding the truth from her sister until the time is right to tell her, which he supports. After Anna departs to find more answers, she and Kristoff are unaware that Ingrid has been eavesdropping on their conversation the whole time.

Ingrid eventually kidnaps Anna and imprisons her within the castle's dungeon cell. She then admits that she wants a family of people like her and Elsa (magically-inclined), and considers Anna to be the "odd one out" due to having nothing in common with her and Elsa, and not fitting the perfect criteria as the third family member. Ingrid vows to find the [[Emma Swan|perfect replacement]] and have what she desires: a family that loves her for who she is.

Ingrid manipulates her into thinking that Anna plans to use a sorcerer's hat to absorb all of her abilities. Learning that she is locked up in the dungeon cell, Elsa pays Anna a visit and tells Anna that she doesn't believe their aunt's lies. They now had plans to find the urn and trap Ingrid in it.

As part of the plan, Anna was returned to the dungeon cell, where she'll ambush Ingrid when she comes to check up on her. Unfortunately, Ingrid was onto their scheme, and Anna now found herself in chains and trapped in the cell with her. Ingrid then uses a shard of mirror to place Anna under her spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, resulting in Anna releasing her inner anger and resentment towards her elder sister. As Elsa is bewildered at her little sister's venomous anger, Ingrid appears and admits she did it to show Anna's inner darkness, causing Elsa to realize her aunt has placed her sister under her spell. Ingrid demands that Elsa freezes Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister and holds her arms against her sides. In an unexpected twist, Anna, still under the spell's influence, unseals the urn and traps Elsa inside. As she is slowly absorbed into the urn, Elsa tells her that she will always love her no matter what she does. Recovering from the magic spell, Anna was horrified by what her aunt made her do to Elsa. As Ingrid prepares to choke her to death, Kristoff arrives to save Anna, armed with only his ice pick. With her aunt finally consumed by her anger and overwhelm with disgust at how the couple sees her as a monster, Anna can only stand and watch as Ingrid uses her power to freeze both her, Kristoff, and Arendelle out of pure fury.

Thirty years later, after Ingrid begins to cast her Spell of Shattered Sight in the town of [[Storybrooke]], Arendelle, along with Anna and Kristoff, finally thaws out. While she contemplates on finding and freeing Elsa from Ingrid, Anna found a piece of gold straw on the floor that was left behind by Rumplestiltskin and deduced that he must have followed her to Arendelle and took Elsa from Ingrid while they were frozen. As they start devising a plan to rescue Elsa from Rumplestiltskin, Hans and his brothers, who had recently been thawed out, barged in and declare Arendelle as his kingdom now. As they figure out what to do next to rescue Elsa, Anna recalls reading in her mother's diary about a wishing star, which she assumes is used to grant a wish. She remembers the journal stated her parents tracked the item to a man, a pirate by the name of [[Blackbeard]].

Anna and Kristoff bargain with Blackbeard for the wishing star, hoping to find Elsa. Unfortunately, they realize it's a trap as Hans and his brothers surround them. Blackbeard tells her about his past encounter with her parents, who sought the wishing star, but they could not use it since the item needs someone with a pure heart. Hans then takes the couple to a spot out at sea called Poseidon's Boneyard, the same spot where Anna and Elsa's parent's ship went down, hoping to dump the couple to the bottom of the sea. The trunk is then shut and thrown into the sea, which sinks and fills with water. Kristoff managed to free himself and Anna from the binds. Believing they will die, Anna begins reciting her marriage vows to Kristoff, though he insists they won't be married until they are out of danger.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 4x09 - Fall - Reunion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anna and Elsa reunite.]]
They proclaim their love for each other as they're about meet their watery fate, but fortunately, due to the power of Elsa's belief in finding her sister and her possession of the wishing star, Anna's necklace for her and Kristoff's wedding, the trunk is transported to the shores of Storybrooke where the siblings reunite, along with their mother's message in a bottle. Anna is led to the diner so the fairies can make a spell with her hair to counter Ingrid's imminent curse, since she'd been affected before and can't be again. However, they find the fairies gone, courtesy of Killian under the control of Mr. Gold, the town's counterpart of Rumplestiltskin. At the sheriff station, Anna reunites with David and meet his family: his wife [[Snow White|Mary Margaret]], their baby son Neal, and their daughter Emma, whom she and Kristoff had just recently met when they arrived. With the spell just moments away, Elsa helps Kristoff handcuff himself to a desk before it approaches, while she, Anna and Emma brace for impact. Though the three are immune to the spell's effects, Anna could only helplessly watch as Kristoff, trying to resist, is slowly affected.

With the town now affected, Mary Margaret and David argue with each other from their separate cell, and Kristoff begins to express his relief that Anna keeps postponing their wedding. After fruitlessly trying to persuade Kristoff that Ingrid's spell causes him to say all the hurtful words about her, Anna left him to discuss with Emma and Elsa about the situation. When Emma recalls her promise to give the people of Storybrooke their happy ending, Anna remembers Ingrid's curse being similar to a myth called ''The Trolden Glass'', in which she reveals that the curse can be broken by killing the person who had cast the spell, the king; meaning they have to do the same with Ingrid. Before she and Elsa left to face Ingrid, with no other option since they can't reason with her, Emma leaves Anna to look after Neal.

As the town is thrown into utter chaos, Anna tried to dissolve Mary Margaret and David's quarrel by bringing up their early lives and how they met in the Enchanted Forest as Snow White and Prince Charming, but to no avail. Later, [[The Evil Queen|Regina]], affected by the spell and in her attire as the Evil Queen, arrive at the sheriff's station to look for Emma, but found Anna, Kristoff, Mary Margaret, and David locked up in their cells. Despite Anna's attempt to calm her down, Regina teleported her and Kristoff to the beach they arrived from. After a frustrated Kristoff attempt to swim back to Arendelle after giving up on the current event that transpires, Anna knocked him out with a bottle that carries her mother's message. Anna discovers its content and decides to bring it to Elsa and Emma, who are confronting Ingrid in her lair.

After arriving, Anna reveals to Elsa their mother's last words in the letter and read the whole thing out loud. It's revealed that, before they died, their parents were wrong to keep the girls apart, as well as hiding Elsa and her abilities, along with Ingrid and [[Helga]]'s existence, from Arendelle. The letter also shows their mother's instructions on how to restore the memories of the people of Arendelle with a memory stone of her elder sisters and how they should free Ingrid, and they should tell their aunt that she loved her and that she regretted deeply what she had done. After reading the letter and seeing the good memories of her and her sisters, Ingrid realized that Anna is right and begins to regret her action. Realizing her wrongs, Ingrid undoes her curse by sacrificing her own life. Before she dies, Ingrid returns Elsa and Emma's missing memories and Storybrooke returns to normal. With Ingrid's redemption now complete, Anna and Elsa now seek to honor their mother's last wish to return to Arendelle to let its people know of Ingrid and Helga.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 4x11 - Heroes and Villains - Anna Wedding.jpg|thumb|250px|Anna, during the finale moments before her wedding.]]
Following the end of Ingrid's curse, Hook, seemingly with Mr. Gold's help, informs the group that he discovers a door to Arendelle hidden in an abandoned mansion. After they found the door that will take them back to Arendelle and confront Hans, they thank Mary Margaret, David, and especially Emma for their good deeds, of which Anna thanks them for looking after her sister. After Elsa and Kristoff walk into the portal, Anna starts to follow but stops to ask the three that she wanted to thank, Hook and Gold, until she curiously asks about Mr. Gold's identity when he was still living in the Enchanted Forest. She guesses, incorrectly, that he was a "fairy godfather", although David reveals that Mr. Gold was actually Rumplestiltskin. To this, Anna reveals Rumplestiltskin lied about not knowing her or Elsa and tells them that she knows of him from their past encounter, causing Emma to suspect Mr. Gold has not changed and has ulterior motives.

At an unknown amount of time later, Arendelle has been reclaimed by the two sisters, and Hans is dethroned; Anna even got her hand bruised from punching Hans in the face. While in the castle's east wing preparing for her wedding with Kristoff, Anna discovers a portrait of Ingrid, Helga, and Gerda, which she places in the great hall. Before the wedding starts, Elsa, struck by Anna's past decision to postpone the wedding to go to the Enchanted Forest, asks her why she chose to do so. Anna cheerfully reasons that she couldn't be happy if her big sister wasn't as well. With the wedding now in full swing, Elsa helps Anna walk down the aisle.

===[[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]===
Anna, alongside Elsa and several other Disney characters, appeared in the 2021 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on the Disney float based on the newest ship for the [[Disney Cruise Line]] fleet, the ''Disney Wish'', with [[Jordan Fisher]] riding with them as a special guest star to sing the song "Together We Set Sail" when the float reached Herald Square on 34th Street. Their float followed behind Ronald McDonald in his Big Red Shoe Car and newest version of his balloon introduced at the parade. During the procession, Anna and her sister, along with Aladdin, Jasmine, Cinderella, Moana, Tiana, Rapunzel, Captain Minnie, Admiral Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n' Dale, waved to the guests along the parade route with Jordan as the song played over the float's loudspeakers, adding that little bit of Disney magic to the parade due to the lingering threat of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its mutations over NYC.

===''[[Anna & Elsa: Sisterhood is the Strongest Magic]]''===
This series of stories follows the adventures of Anna and Elsa after the events of the film. Most of the tales focus on the sisters rebuilding the bond they've once shared, including ''Memory and Magic'', where an eager young troll claims to have the power to restore the memories of Anna that Pabbie erased after the childhood incident. However, a reluctant Elsa doesn't take kindly to the idea.

In ''The Secret Admirer'', Anna reveals herself to be an aspiring matchmaker and leaps at the opportunity to pair Elsa off with a love interest after the latter received gifts from an anonymous admirer.

''Anna Takes Charge'' looks into Anna's capabilities as sovereign of Arendelle, as she is left to rule the kingdom while Elsa is away for some time. Here she is portrayed as an “outside the box” thinker. Having the people take the day off from planning a huge event which allows them to feel refreshed and work twice as hard the next day. A strategy that Elsa (who had previously had everyone constantly working to meet the deadline) complimented.

===''Conceal, Don't Feel''===
In the ''Twisted Tales'' story ''[[Conceal, Don't Feel (A Twisted Tale)|Conceal, Don't Feel]]'', in which Elsa tries to stop Grand Pabbie from erasing Anna's memory of her sister's magic ends up cursing herself and Anna. She could not be in close proximity with Elsa otherwise she would freeze to death. Anna is then taken to be raised by another family in a village called Harmon with no recollection of her royal bloodline in Arendelle. Her mother would visit Anna every other month, posing as a seamstress named "Freya" and Tomally's best friend. In the years that followed, Anna constantly felt drawn to Arendelle and planned to move there someday to open her own bakery. At fifteen, Anna's snowman cookies were famous in the village.

In the meantime, Elsa, through different circumstances, accidentally freezes the kingdom. Anna feels obligated to find out what happened and recruits Kristoff and Sven for help. Once down in Arendelle, Anna hears the story from the [[Duke of Weselton]] and Lord Peterssen. When she sneaks into the castle, her memory starts to return. Upon finding [[Olaf]] in the halls, they follow Olaf's direction up to the North Mountain to find Elsa.

While halfway up the mountain, after escaping the pack of wolves, Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and [[Sven]] run into [[Hans]], a prince from [[the Southern Isles]] who is on his way to find Elsa himself. Kristoff and Sven leave the group when Anna and Olaf allow the prince to join them on their quest. They eventually find a cabin inhabited by a family before a royal guard arrives and takes them back to Arendelle. Hans then explains she is the lost princess of the kingdom and wishes to be by her side. However, Anna finds him increasingly untrustworthy and runs down to the dungeon to find her sister. The close proximity causes Anna to freeze. But even with the curse's enactment, the snowstorm becoming increasingly dangerous and Hans's ruthless pursuit, Anna braves through the danger. She recovers all of her childhood memories moments upon seeing Hans readying to strike her sister with his sword. She shields Elsa with her body, but the close proximity causes the curse to take full effect, turning her into an ice statue. However, by recovering her memory, the curse is lifted and Anna is ultimately thawed. After Elsa unfreezes the kingdom, Anna returns to the village to talk with her adoptive parents and then returns to her childhood home, where she starts a new future with her sister, as well as a romantic relationship with Kristoff.

===Other stories===
''Tales Of Courage and Kindness: Cloudberries for a Queen'' shows Anna's first cloudberry festival as Queen of Arendelle. She becomes distraught when she realizes that the people are treating her different now that she is their queen. Doing things for her instead of asking her for help or doing things with her like they did before (similar to Elsa's predicament in All Hail the Queen) and seeks to close the growing divide between her and the people.

The novel ''[[A Frozen Heart]]'' delves into the internal thoughts of both Anna and Hans, during the course of the original film, specifically pertaining to their overall relationship, in addition to their backstories and motivations.

''A Year with Elsa & Anna (and Olaf, too!)'' features a flyer released during Anna's birth; the inscription reveals that to commemorate Anna's birth, Agnarr and Iduna held a kingdom gathering in the castle courtyard, where they presented a days-old Anna for the first time to the public from the castle balcony.

''Forest of Shadows'' takes place three years after the first movie and three months before ''Frozen II''. It highlights certain aspects about Anna and Elsa. Elsa prepares to leave Arendelle to go on a grand tour of other countries and decides to leave Anna to look after Arendelle, though she takes it as her sister not wanting her. When a plague hits Arendelle, Anna attempts to price her worth to Elsa by fixing it after discovering a secret room in the castle with books on magic, but accidentally releases a Nattmara (a Scandinavian spirit in the form of a white wolf that feeds on nightmares) on Arendelle. The Nattmara goes on a rampage through Arendelle, putting everyone in a sleep-like state and continuing to grow. After Anna realizes that the Nattmara is a manifestation of Elsa's fear of not being a good queen, she reassures her sister, helping Elsa overcome her fear and causing the Nattmara to shrink before disappearing completely. Following this, Elsa cancels the tour, deciding that she and Anna need to stay to rule Arendelle together. The book also foreshadows events from the sequel, such as a dream Anna has of the earth giants destroying the dam, and the epilogue contains Anna's thoughts during “Into the Unknown”.

Grand Pabbie tells the sisters that he senses great power coming from the player, prompting the sisters to enlist them in helping defeat the ghosts. Anna can later be found in the marketplace. She, at one point, is the head of preparations for the Snowman Festival and later travels to the Ice Palace to find blue crocuses for Elsa.

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Anna KHIII Render.png|right|250px]]
In ''[[Kingdom Hearts Union χ]]'', Anna appears as a combat Prime power medal used by the game's avatars along with her sister Elsa. Her power from the medals was channeled by the Book of Prophecies.

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', Anna appears in her homeworld of "Arendelle". Her role is largely the same as it was in the film, but with her brief interactions with [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]] during her search for Elsa. In their pursuit of seven pure hearts, Anna becomes one of the unknowing targets of [[Organization XIII]].<ref name="kh3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.khinsider.com/news/Famitsu-Frozen-New-Seven-Hearts-summary-video-no-public-demo-12493|title=Famitsu: Frozen, New Seven Hearts, summary video, no public demo|website=Khinsider|date=June 15, 2018|author=Cecily}}</ref>

Anna is first seen with Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf as they make their way up the North Mountain to Elsa's palace when they hear Sora's excited reaction to seeing Olaf, causing them to turn around and formally meet Sora, Donald, and Goofy, with Anna asking Olaf if he knows them, but Olaf says he doesn't recognize them. When Sora mentions having just seen and met Elsa a short while ago, Anna has Kristoff take Sven and Olaf away so she can explain to Sora about her past with her big sister and Elsa's ice powers in private. After Sora relates Anna's plight to his own past regarding [[Riku]] when he stayed behind with King [[Mickey Mouse]] to ensure the locking of [[Kingdom Hearts]] after defeating [[Ansem, Seeker of Darkness]], Sora helps Anna and Kristoff with finding Olaf's parts as they had been scattered again. After reassembling Olaf, [[Heartless]] show up prompting Sora, Donald, and Goofy to face them while Anna and the others proceed to find Elsa. They then arrive to Elsa's castle, but Sora remained outside with Donald, Goofy, and Sven while Anna went in with Olaf and Kristoff to speak with her big sister. However, in her panic and fear regarding casting Arendelle into an eternal winter with her powers, Elsa lashes out and hits Anna in her heart with them, though neither sister realizes this at first, while Sora clutches his own chest in pain when he realizes something bad has happened to Anna.

Elsa then conjures Marshmallow to get rid of Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf, forcing Sora, Donald, and Goofy to distract him to give Anna and the others time to escape. Later on, Anna's curse has worsened to the point that she can barely walk across the frozen fjord as she struggles to find Kristoff in the hopes he can save her by breaking the curse with an "act of true love". Though she soon spots him and tries to struggle towards him, she hears a sword being drawn and spots Prince Hans about to execute Elsa, who is unaware as she lies on the ice, caught in her grief to not see the prince about to kill her. Sacrificing her chance of saving herself, Anna rushes to her sister's aid and places herself between Hans and Elsa, just as her curse reaches its zenith, turning her into a solid ice statue, shattering Hans' sword and knocking him out cold. However, the darkness in Hans' heart results in a large, wolf-like Heartless named Sköll being created from it, consuming Hans in the process, which Sora is forced to take down with support from Marshmallow, whom he convinced to help them due to Marshmallow's loyalty to protecting Elsa from harm.

After the Heartless is slain, Sora sees Elsa weeping over Anna's frozen body, but Anna's sacrifice to save her sister constituted an "act of true love", thawing her heart and restoring her to flesh and blood. Before Sora can celebrate with the sisters, he is intercepted by [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters#Larxene/Elrena|Larxene]], who is surprised that Anna's love for Elsa filled both of their hearts with light. She then warns Sora that if he doesn't find his seven Guardians of Light soon, the True Organization XIII would go after Anna and Elsa for their pure hearts, as [[Xehanort|Master Xehanort]] already has his thirteenth piece of darkness. Despite Sora's worry about Larxene's fateful warning, he is assured that Anna and Elsa can handle it due to their strong love for each other. Elsa then realizes that love is the key to controlling her powers, and is able to end Arendelle's winter. Anna celebrates the return of summer to Arendelle with her sister, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven, alongside Sora, Donald, and Goofy, before the trio set off on their next adventure.

In the game's credits, Anna and Kristoff are sledding down the mountain before Elsa provides them an ice ramp to land safely. Anna joins Elsa afterwards as Marshmallow arrives with Olaf having fallen to pieces again, but Olaf soon puts himself back together as Marshmallow smiles, while Anna and Elsa look on in amusement.

===Other games===
Anna appears in the puzzle game ''[[Frozen Free Fall]]'' as a companion character. Her special item is a torch.

On December 2014, an add-on costume of Anna was added to the popular video game series ''LittleBigPlanet'', as part of the "Frozen Costume Pack".

==[[Frozen (musical)|Musical]]==
[[File:Frozen Musical cast photos - Anna.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Patti Murin as Anna in the ''Frozen'' musical.]]
For the stage adaptation of ''Frozen'', the role of the plucky, free-spirited Princess Anna was originated by actress Patti Murin, who related to Anna back when ''Frozen'' first hit theaters.<ref name="oh">{{Cite web|url=https://www.backstage.com/interview/how-patti-murin-reimagined-her-disney-princess-broadways-frozen/|title=How Patti Murin Reimagined Her Disney Princess for Broadway’s Frozen|date=March 21, 2018|last=Mink|first=Casey|format=Article|publisher=''Backstage''}}</ref> Anna's character - and more specifically, her struggles are explored further in the musical, primarily through song.

Her role in the story is relatively the same, with a few differences littered throughout, including meeting Kristoff on Coronation Day and donning an ice harvester outfit given to her by Kristoff before purchasing her winter gear from Oaken. More significant is when Anna confronts Elsa in the latter's ice palace. Anna learns that the white streak in her hair is from a nearly fatal accident caused by Elsa rather than something she was born with.

Anna is given several new songs, most of which are duets. The first is "[[A Little Bit of You]]", sung by herself and Elsa as children when they create Olaf. Another is "[[What Do You Know About Love?]]", a confrontational, and later romantic duet in which she and Kristoff question their differing views on love. Anna's first and only solo is "[[True Love]]", performed after Hans leaves her to die alone. The song is the dramatic, melancholy climax of Anna's emotional arc, where she reevaluates her tragic life while simultaneously accepting her oncoming death.

In [[Festival of Fantasy Parade]], Anna appears wearing her green coronation gown. She currently appears with Elsa and Olaf in [[Mickey's Royal Friendship Faire]].

During the summer of 2014 and 2015, Anna serves as the hostess of [[Frozen Summer Fun!]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], alongside Elsa. She's heavily featured in the daily events, including the sing-along stage show, [[For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration]] among others, and serves as a "Mistress of Ceremonies"; often kicking off the events before other characters and cast members arrive to further the entertainment. Sometimes, after the show, she, Kristoff, Elsa, and the Historians will perform little meet-and-greet sessions for special occasions.

Anna makes a cameo during the bubble montage scene in [[Fantasmic!]], alongside Elsa and Olaf.

Anna also appears as an audio-animatronic in [[Frozen Ever After]] at [[Epcot]]. She is first seen singing a duet version of "For the First Time in Forever" with Kristoff, and later, in the end, singing a version of "[[In Summer]]" with Elsa and Olaf. In the same park, she can be found making meet-and-greet appearances in the [[Norway Pavilion]] alongside Elsa.

Before the construction of the Royal Sommerhus at Epcot, she and Elsa had actually been moved between several temporary meet-and-greet locations around Walt Disney World. These include a dedicated section at The Magic of Disney Animation at Disney's Hollywood Studios, the entrance to the Puffin's Roost at the Norway Pavilion, and the Princess Fairytale Hall at the Magic Kingdom. At the Princess Fairytale Hall, she started doing meet and greet sessions separately from Elsa. As of now, they still conduct individual sessions at the Royal Sommerhus but will still interact with each other occasionally.

Her revival and confession of love for Elsa lead to the show's finale.

==[[Disney Princess]]==
[[File:MagazineAnnaElsa.jpg|thumb|250px|Anna and Elsa on the cover of a French ''Disney Princess'' magazine.]]
Anna and Elsa were originally planned to join the ''[[Disney Princess]]'' franchise as the twelfth and thirteenth Princesses respectfully. The two were even given two-dimensional art, similar to those of [[Rapunzel]] and [[Merida]]. However, with the financial and critical success of their movie, the two are currently the stars of the ''Frozen'' franchise, rendering it unnecessary to include the two in another major franchise.

Despite this, the two have been commonly featured alongside members of the franchise in merchandise and media. They were referenced in the show ''[[Sofia the First]]''. In "[[The Secret Library]]", a cold wind and ice droplets are shown in the secret tunnel, alongside other references to all the other Disney Princesses. Later, in "[[The Secret Library: Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle]]", Olaf is summoned by the [[Amulet of Avalor]], due to the powers of [[Miss Nettle]]. It is implied by Olaf, however, that without Miss Nettle's intervention, Anna would have been summoned, as aside only Disney Princesses have been summoned by the amulet.

The two were also included in the updated version of "[[The Glow]]", a Disney Princess song.

Inside of Shanghai Disneyland's Enchanted Storybook Castle, wall carvings of the official Disney Princesses are prominently displayed; Anna and Elsa are featured among them.

Inside the book ''Going to Disneyland: A Guide for Kids and Kids at Heart'' is a page dedicated to the Disney Princesses, which features Anna as the twelfth member.

Despite not being official members, Elsa and Anna were added into the Ultimate Princess Celebration, due to the event being a unification of both the ''Disney Princess'' and [[Frozen (franchise)|''Frozen'' franchises]]. In the celebration, they're presented as Frozen Queens.

==Trivia==
*At one point, Anna was going to be named Greta, loosely after Gerda, the original heroine of ''The Snow Queen''.
*According to [[Jennifer Lee]], Anna was born on the Summer Solstice<ref>{{Cite web|format=Tweet|date=September 2, 2014|title=@alittlejelee Was Elsa born in summer? #AskFrozen @MarianaDeLama For all who've asked, here's an exclusive: Elsa was born on the Winter Solstice & Anna on the Summer Solstice. #AskFrozen|website=Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/MarianaDeLama/status/506954737238155266|last=Lee|first=Jennifer}}</ref> at 1:16 PM,<ref>{{Cite web|title=What time was Anna born on June 21st? 1:16pm.|url=https://twitter.com/thejedijunkyard/status/1343040641723330564|last=Lee|first=Jennifer|date=December 26, 2020|format=Tweet|website=Twitter}}</ref> and is 18 during ''Frozen''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=@KellanJudy for the main part of the story, Anna is 18 and Elsa is 21.|url=https://twitter.com/alittlejelee/status/405894331350786050|date=November 27, 2013|website=Twitter|format=Tweet|first=Jennifer|last=Lee}}</ref> The events of ''Frozen Fever'' also confirm her birthday taking place roughly a year after the film, making her 19 years old by that time. Her birthday is not celebrated on the Summer Solstice every year, necessarily, as that date differs. But she was born on the day that the Summer Solstice happened for that specific year (e.g. 1821).
*Anna's name means "gracious" or "full of grace". Ironically, Anna is more bubbly and daring than graceful.
*Anna's name is pronounced "AH-na" in Norwegian, as opposed to the usual English pronunciation "AN-ah".
*She is shown to be ticklish at the beginning of her film as a child, as shown when she and Elsa slide down the snow, which Anna giggles yelling "Tickle bumps!"
*Anna is mostly seen wearing green and magenta, while Elsa wears blue. Green and magenta represent spring and summer as well as her cheerful and optimistic personality. Similarly enough, [[Elliott]] from ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'' sports the same color palette of green and pink, which are also nature colors and represent his own personality (green=his loyalty and pink=his kindness and love).
*Anna sings the most out of all the characters of ''Frozen''.
*The two parts of Anna's body that Elsa accidentally hurt with her ice powers, her head and her heart, ''mirror'' the two parts of Kai's body that were hit by the broken shards of the Devil's mirror in the original ''Snow Queen'' fairy tale: the eye, distorting the way he sees things, and the heart, making him resentful to others. Ironically, Elsa takes on Kai's role in the film.
*Although Elsa is based on Kai, Anna receives ice skates from Elsa, mirroring how Kai also received ice skates from the Snow Queen.
*When in warm weather, Anna wears outfits which look similar to her winter outfit, but with green coloring.
*Anna's winter outfit shares uncanny similarities with Elsa's coronation gown, perhaps symbolically marking how she has gained maturity:
**Detachable magenta cape.
**Adorned bodice with a V-shaped waistline (black on Anna, and teal on Elsa).
**Bluish gloves/mittens (that they eventually took off).
**Tight fitting sleeves (black on Elsa, and light blue on Anna).
***In addition, by the end of ''Frozen II'', Anna's coronation gown also shares similar black and dark green colors (with slight traces of purple), long, tight-fitting sleeves and long green skirt like Elsa's, hence symbolically marking how she has matured by the events of the sequel.
*According to ''Frozen'': The Essential Guide,<ref>''Frozen'': The Essential Guide, p. 9</ref> one of Anna's favorite desserts is {{WikipediaLink|krumkake}} (not to be confused with {{WikipediaLink|Streuselkuchen}}, a dessert of German origin, which is referred to in English-speaking countries as crumb cake) - a thin waffle-like cookie shaped like an ice-cream cone and stuffed with sweet fillings.
*In ''[[Sofia the First]]'', Anna is mentioned by Olaf in the episode "[[The Secret Library: Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle]]".
*In ''[[Zootopia]]'', a little elephant girl wearing an outfit resembling Anna's trademark winter outfit can be seen wandering around in [[Tundratown]].
*During renovations of the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] building, beginning in [[2014]], Anna was one of the character silhouettes featured on the wall mural.
*While it has gone unnoticed by many, Anna has performed feats of incredible strength not typically associated with a woman of her build. Although some may argue that these were kickstarted by adrenaline, examples are:
**Flinging a stone bust across a ballroom.
**Throwing climbing equipment at Kristoff with enough force to inflict pain with no effort.
**Sending a wolf flying off a sleigh with a lute.
**Pulling Kristoff up a cliff with a little help from Sven.
**Kicking Olaf's head high into the air.
**Knocking Marshmallow out with a tree.
**Punching Hans in the face with enough force to throw him overboard.
**Spraining the wrist of a dignitary when she was a little girl.
*Given Anna's hyperactivity, impulsivity, and short attention span, she may have {{WikipediaLink|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}. She gets easily excited, can sometimes act before she thinks, and her short attention span shows when she says, "Wait, what?" (both in the first movie as an adult and in the sequel as a child).
*According to the deleted song "[[Life's Too Short]]", Anna was originally intended to marry Hans without Elsa's permission.
*When Pabbie alters Anna's memories so she doesn't remember Elsa's powers, if you look closely as he puts the altered memories in her head, her expression changes to a smile.
**This is further enforced in the sequel when Anna looked confused when Olaf mentions that Anna was born powerless while introducing himself and his friends to both groups of Arendellian soldiers and Northuldrans during the standoff.
**It is also heavily hinted Elsa did not tell her about Pabbie altering her memories, though it is unknown if she forgot to tell her or didn't want to.
***However, a few books, including ''A Frozen Heart'' and ''Anna and Elsa: Memories and Magic'' have Elsa reveal the events that led to their separation when they were children even though Anna still doesn't specifically remember them.
*In ''Forest of Shadows'', it is revealed that Anna has a fear that her loved ones may not actually want her around, which was influenced by her childhood and Hans. Although this is resolved at the end of the book, it is prominent in the sequel, with her assuming Kristoff is trying to reject her during his many awkward proposal attempts.
**In the same book, it is also revealed that, in her frozen state, Anna was still alive and completely conscious the entire time and has nightmares about it.
***However, in ''A Frozen Heart'', Anna describes turning to ice as seeing white and blue then nothing before thawing.
**''Forest of Shadows'' and ''A Frozen Heart'' also have different versions of Anna waking up after her accident.
*According to Elsa, and confirmed by Jennifer Lee, Anna and Elsa ''both'' serve as the fifth spirit because "a bridge has two sides". While Elsa can be regarded as the "official" fifth spirit, it is her close bond to Anna that unites the Enchanted Forest and Arendelle, specifically with Anna becoming Queen and Elsa staying as the forest's guardian. This is also supported by the fact that Elsa and Anna were both required to lift the curse: Elsa by discovering the truth and Anna by getting the Earth Giants to destroy the dam.
**Ironically, however, it was Anna who broke the curse over the forest while it was Elsa who saved Arendelle from the resulting flood.
*In a deleted scene in ''Frozen II'', Elsa reveals to Anna a memory from the water that their parents had planned to tell her the truth about Elsa's magic upon returning from their voyage, the one in which they died. Some of Agnarr and Iduna's lines from this scene were worked into the epilogues of the prequel novel, ''Dangerous Secrets: The Story of Iduna and Agnarr'', and the post-''Frozen II'' novel, ''Polar Nights: Cast Into Darkness''.
*In the "Five-Minute Sleepy Time Stories" segment "''Frozen II'': Family Game Night" which takes place before the sequel, chess is Anna's favorite game, at which she is better than both Kristoff and Elsa. But she tends to get overenthusiastic about playing to the point of critiquing other players' moves and taking over both sides.
**Historically, chess has been considered a game of royals as it teaches strategy. The fact that Anna is better at the game than Elsa hints her future as Arendelle's true queen.
*One of Anna's underlying insecurities was being the "spare" princess, unimportant and not having a true purpose compared to Elsa, who is the heir and later queen; hence why she becomes more secure and fulfilled after Elsa passes the title of queen onto her at the end of the sequel.
**When Anna becomes Queen of Arendelle, she has the same hairstyle Elsa had on her coronation day. Their mother also had the same hairstyle when she was queen. Her dress also emphasizes the Arendelle official crest, while both her mother and sister only wore regular dresses.
***Unlike her mother and sister, who wore simple tiaras during their reigns, Anna's tiara is very extravagant and contains Arendelle's royal symbols, indicating her true role as queen of Arendelle.
*On Anna's winter dress, there is a clasp that looks similar to a clasp her mother wore on her dress. It's unknown if this is the same or a replica.
*Despite Anna having a horse, Kjekk barely appears in the ''Frozen'' storyline, contrasting to Elsa's animal companions that play major roles in the story ([[Bruni]] and [[the Nokk]]).
*In ''Polar Nights'', it is said that Elsa and Anna have game night in Arendelle every Friday, Anna also makes occasional trips to the forest to see Elsa and they exchange through Gale every day.
