'''Max Hare''' is one of the titular characters of the short, ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]''===
An athlete and a bragger, he first pretends to sleep, showing off about how the tortoise is slow and he is fast. He runs until he finds a school of girls. When he starts to notice them, they begin to swoon over him. Max Hare shows them archery tricks and shows how fast he is by playing tennis by himself, running back and forth and hitting the ball. The Bunny Girls clap, cheer and swoon for him some more, but Max gets back to the race, and loses. The hare ends up learning that the quick path is not always the easy way.

===''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]''===
The Hare later returns for a boxing match, alongside his rival, Toby. After Max Hare dodges Toby's punches he turns to the bunny girls, who begin to giggle. When Toby tries to sneak up on Max, they warn him, but he already knows and punches Toby. In the second round, Toby uses his shell to protect himself from Maxâ€™s punches. The Hare tries to grab the turtle but gets his hand trapped by a mouse trap. After that, Max tries to fill his shell with water, but Toby spits all the water at him, making him angry. Then, Max puts a lot of fireworks inside his shell and lights them up, making Toby fly around and hit him several times. One of the fireworks takes Max away and he ends up being taken away to the hospital. 

==Trivia==
*Max Hare is believed to be one of the inspirations for Warner Bros.' popular cartoon star Bugs Bunny, who first appeared in 1940. In fact, Bugs' early design in 1940 bears a closer resemblance to Max Hare.
