==Role in the series==
Dr. Okra was about to appear as a public speaker until her clumsy servant carrying drinking water accidentally bumped into her. The water bottle on the tray spilled onto the stage, leaked out, and activated Experiment 319 ([[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]]), who then spiked both her and her servant, causing them to act goofy in front of the audience. Shortly after, Spike attacked the entire audience, scaring them all away.

[[Pleakley]] watched Okra on television, studying the methods of "hugging, crying, and throwing chairs" for people who deal with their emotional problems. He wanted to do his own seminar to rehabilitate Spike, along with [[Fibber]], [[Nosy]], [[Slushy]], [[Splodyhead]], [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]] and [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]]. Pleakley used the "hugging-and-crying" method to rehabilitate Spike, which worked, causing the other experiments to do it as well.

Given Spike's ability is temporary, Okra and her servant returned to normal within 48 hours.

==Trivia==
*Dr. Okra bears a striking resemblance to [[Oprah Winfrey]]. Notably, they are both media proprietors who help people through their syndicated TV shows.
*She is revealed to be the best selling author of ''I'm Peachy, You're Peachy''.
*Okra was Spike's first victim. Ironically, Pleakley used her methods to rehabilitate him.
*Okra made a cameo appearance in "[[Heckler (episode)|Heckler]]", when a large-eared person helped Pleakley against [[Heckler]].
