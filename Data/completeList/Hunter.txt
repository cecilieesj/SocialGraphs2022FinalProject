'''Hunter''' (formerly known as '''The Golden Guard''') is a recurring character in the second season of ''[[The Owl House]]''. He is a grimwalker created by [[Emperor Belos]] who served as his right-hand man, believing he was a powerless witch and Belos' nephew before discovering the truth. He is now one of Luz's closest friends and allies who helps her in her fight against Belos.

==Background==
===Personality===
Hunter is laid-back, easy-going, chill, and likes to make quips towards the people he battles with. He is also shown to have an endearing side, taking a liking towards [[King (The Owl House)|King]] for his cute nature. In spite of this, he takes his job seriously and always makes sure to follow his [[Emperor Belos|boss]]'s orders. He might be quite arrogant and obnoxious, as [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] calls him "a brat". He is apparently a "genius teen prodigy" among the members of the Emperor's Coven, implying him to be intelligent and resourceful at magic, which serves as the reason for his high rank despite his age.

A hidden side of Hunter was revealed in "[[Hunting Palismen]]", in which he has been revealed as not only a naturally powerless witch, but also the nephew of Emperor Belos. He is similar to Lilith, being very loyal to Emperor Belos and has some fear of his uncle, but unlike Belos' other employed, Hunter does genuinely care about his uncle, who, according to them both, took Hunter in when their family was apparently destroyed by wild magic. While he does retain fear of his uncle, he does not seem to fear Belos in his monster state and even attempts to sway Belos on a more effective way of harnessing the palisman magic. This also reveals Hunter has an interest in wild magic, having studied it quite thoroughly to the point of knowing some of the ways witches used to do magic back in the Savage Ages, although Belos seems to heavily disapprove of this interest. Outside his connection with Belos, Hunter showcases insecurity and bitterness about being a powerless witch, as he relies solely on his artificial magical staff, causing him to act a little harshly and defensive at times, especially towards Luz, his enemy. However, he gradually warms up to her, even revealing his name later on. While he is indeed her enemy, he is not above trying to help her after she helped him as thanks. After getting to know Luz, help each other out and even listening to Luz criticizing him for what he is willing to do to innocent palismen for the sake of Emperor Belos, Hunter has some respect for Luz by letting her escape with the palismen while holding off Kikimora and when he tells Belos someone got in his way, he does not tell who it was and later the cardinal palisman arrives to his room choosing him as his wielder, despite Hunter's worries for his safety. Eventually, he learns to bond with the palisman after he hears him say his name, Flapjack.

Hunter's loyalty to Belos comes to as an almost obsessive degree in "[[Eclipse Lake]]", as Belos tells him in his life everyone in existence have a use and his own usefulness will come when the time is right. Hunter believes that if he himself can't be useful, he considers himself "worthless". This obsession has affected Hunter's mental health, as he has a mental breakdown for a moment when Hunter feels he failed again. Hunter seems to listen to Amity's words that he does not have to think everything is an opportunity to justify existing when there are people out there who will not make you feel worthless and not want anything from you as they like you for who you are, and all he has to do is let himself meet them as she offers her hand. However, he chooses his belief as he sees the portal key around Amity's neck. After the fight Hunter went as far as using dirty tricks by threatening to harm Luz if she doesn't surrender the key, but after she does hand it over, he does show genuine gratitude, compassion and some remorse about this before leaving.

Hunter desires to be accepted by his subordinates, especially Darius, which stems from not having interacted with anyone his own age and being forced into a life of training which he believes was fun, but he is dumbfounded to discover that nobody believes in the Emperor's coven anymore. He soon realizes what it really took to get him to where he is and begins to regret most of his life choices as he realizes that he may have put his new friends in danger. This causes him to choose friendship over leadership and briefly renounces his title, only to finally gain respect from Darius who gives it back to him, afterwards he begins opening up to the idea of making friends with Willow, Gus and possibly Luz, the former of whom he is implied to have developed feelings for.

After discovering the truth about who Belos is, what his true intentions are for the witchkind and the Boiling Isles and the revelation that he is a Grimwalker, Hunter loses complete trust in Belos and abandons him in favor of Luz but suffers an existential crisis causing multiple panic attacks, which causes him to go into denial, wanting to believe that his life is still means something to others, but with help from his new friends, soon accepts that he was living a lie and chooses to help in the fight against Belos.

Hunter becomes insecure about his status as a Grimwalker and begs Luz not to tell anyone since he knows about her secret about her interaction with Belos as he understands the situation that she's in compared to his own, but also empathizes and worries about her well-being as they keep each other's secrets to themselves.

In the Human realm, Hunter's personality takes a drastic change for the better, at first, he develops paranoia about what his friends will think of him being a Grimwalker, so much so that he imagines himself becoming like Belos, leading him cut off most of his hair in a panic, until, with help from Willow, it resembles Luz's original hairstyle. Later on, however, Hunter becomes gradually cheerful, enthusiastic, and eager to learn more about human world culture and devices, such as learning to speak Spanish and how to use a sewing machine, he also develops a fascination for fireflies, wolves and a sci-fi book series called "Cosmic Frontier", while Gus notes that he's been much happier since they arrived, he shows little desire to return to his old life, and simply wants to help his friends return home. Eventually, Hunter admits to himself that while he's not who he's supposed to be, he likes the person he's become.

Hunter's relationship with Luz has also improved significantly, as he now relies on and trusts her to help him keep their friends safe, until Luz tells Hunter that she wants to keep him safe as well and that he's become a part of her family, which causes him to break down crying, meaning that he feels the same way about her.

After Flapjack gives his life to save Hunter's, he becomes despondent as he mourns his palisman, but insists on finishing the fight they started for Flapjack's sake.

===Physical appearance===
Hunter is an adolescent male with fair skin, pointy ears, dark magenta eyes, thick black eyebrows, a gap between his front teeth, bags under his eyes, and ash-blond hair that is shaved below the top with a long, jagged forelock. He has a notch on his left ear and scars on his right cheek, upper left arm, and legs.

He wears a golden-yellow tunic with darker sleeves and a dark brown belt, black leggings, dark brown boots and gloves, a golden two-faceted owl mask, and an ivory hooded cape with a triangle clasp. He wears a golden pauldron on his left shoulder, while his right shoulder is without armor.

In season 3, Hunter's hair has been cut shorter to resemble Luz's Season 1 design, and it is cut down to a tiny curl over his forehead. He's wearing a yellow sweatshirt with a breast pocket, faded jeans with patches on the knees, and red sneakers.

At the end of "Thanks to Them", after being revived, his hair has grown longer, and his forelock has been restored, he has tissue damage from being possessed causing his scar to spread across his lower cheek to his nose, and right forearm, along with a new scar on his other cheek, and his eyes have turned hazel, he wears a wolf t-shirt that he made along with leftover parts of his Halloween costume, a black and yellow sweater wrapped around his waist, black slacks and green and black high tops.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Artificial magic:''' Unlike all the other witches, Hunter is a powerless witch, and his only source of power is artificial magic which he gets from his staff. Without it, he cannot perform magic. Like Belos, he cannot use [[Spell Circle]]s and instead uses his staff to do magic.

==Role in the series==
===Season two===
Hunter is formally introduced in "[[Separate Tides]]" as the Golden Guard, who replaces Lillith as head of the Emperor's coven, he meets Luz and Eda as they hunt for the Selkidomus and accidentally drown the reward money, and he reveals that the ship they were on belongs to the Emperor's coven and, after fending off the two of them, reveals that he captured King and threatens to arrest Luz, petrify Eda and drown King in the boiling sea unless they earn back the reward money by slaying the Selkidomus, which Luz accepts out of guilt for Eda and King's predicament. Luz tricks The Golden Guard into believing she has done so using plant and light glyphs to resemble the creature and then takes off, stating that Emperor Belos is not a forgiving man.

At the end of "[[Escaping Expulsion]]", he tells Odalia and Alador Blight that the Emperor has purchased every last of their Abomatons and funds research into improving them, implying that he believes that they would likely build a private army against him.

In "[[Hunting Palismen]]", he begs Emperor Belos to let him help him with his declining condition using wild magic, which his uncle immediately shuts down, stating that wild magic is the reason that their family is gone and instead sends him out to find more palismen after depleting their resources. The Golden Guard abducts the tree filled with palismen at Hexside, unknowingly kidnaping Luz in the process, who then surprises him by rocketing him off of his own ship with a fire glyph, only to for him to teleport back where he captures Luz, who sends his staff flying, and soon crash lands in Latissa because of Kikimora. Luz finds him unconscious, where she sees his face for the first time, and wakes him up in an attempt to save him, much to his chagrin as Luz also finds his staff, he attempts to enter a branch of the Emperor's coven but is ridiculed out by the guards as they do not believe he is their superior and Luz refuses to hand over his staff, leading him to chase after Luz in anger, where she discovers that he is powerless without the staff. Luz offers a truce after the Golden Guard sees that she was right about Kikimora, and together they plan to put her and her hand dragon to sleep with wild magic, which Hunter begins to find interesting, but brushes it off believing it to be dangerous, and then confides in Luz about being a powerless witch who uses a staff with artificial magic after Belos gave him a home and purpose after losing their family.

After succeeding in landing Kikimora's hand dragon, Luz goes to free the Palismen only for the Golden Guard to turn on her, in which Luz admits that she knows that Belos destroys palismen to gain strength and realizes that he could never be her friend, which seems to affect him emotionally, so he stands down and introduces himself as Hunter, only to be attacked by a disoriented Kikimora and holds her off while Luz escapes. Hunter then returns to Belos empty handed, but doesn't tell him about Luz, he tries to get him to listen to him about how wild magic could help him, but Belos lashes out at him, so he apologizes and leaves, he passes Kikimora who notices the singe she gave him during the fight and retires to his room where a red cardinal Palisman has followed him and chooses him as his owner, which confuses him.

In "[[Eclipse Lake]]", Hunter, joins his uncle as he tries to get the portal door to work, who explains that he needs Titan's blood to activate it, and Hunter expresses interest in the Human realm, to which he claims to have been there before and looks forward to returning, Hunter then becomes concerned about what Belos thinks of him when he's convinced that he may try to replace him, so he goes off to find Titan's Blood himself at Eclipse Lake while disguised as a coven scout to avoid detection from Kikimora, but his palisman joins him and gets him caught by Eda, King and Amity, who take him captive and lead him through the caverns to the lake. Throughout the journey, Hunter constantly tries to get into Amity's head, saying that they are no different from each other and telling her that Luz expects results according to her messages, until they end up getting caught by the coven and Amity is forced to free Hunter after Eda and King fall down a cliff, only for him to abandon her and take the blood for himself, only to find that it's empty. Hunter suffers a mental breakdown and attempts to bury himself after realizing that he has completely failed and can't return, but after Amity gives him a heartfelt speech about how they are similar, he considers taking her hand only to see the portal key around her neck and attempts to fight her and King for it, using his palisman, which has reduced power, the fight ends in a tie, but Hunter threatens to have Luz arrested unless she hands it over, which she does, which Hunter shows gratitude for as he leaves, but immediately regrets his actions. Afterwards, Hunter officially bonds with his palisman, who introduces himself as Flapjack, as they leave.

In "[[Any Sport in a Storm]]", Hunter takes over Belos' job as leader while he's away, only to be dismissed by everyone as their meeting was rescheduled, he then gets a mission from Darius to find recruits for the Emperor's Coven, so he goes to Hexside disguised as a student, but is confused to find that no one is interested, but, under the alias "Caleb" finds Willow, Gus, Viney, and Skara as candidates after joining their flyer derby team, which he actually enjoys more than he thought. Hunter then reveals to them his real name and that he is the Golden Guard, as guards appear to take them, intending to take them away from their friends and families forever. In their cell, Hunter can't see why they are unhappy of being part of the best coven, they tell him they don't want to, and friends don't stab people in their backs, which he doesn't believe. When Darius takes them and their palismen, Hunter is reminded that their palismen are to be given to Belos, Hunter regrets of what he has done having realized the way he was raised is not normal. Hunter goes to rescue them and when Darius is about to attack them, Hunter protects them and helps them leave, abandoning his title in the process. Despite everything that's happened, Hunter hears that Willow, Gus and the rest do consider him as a friend. Instead of scolding Hunter, Darius praises him and gives him a scroll to contact them as he needs connections outside the castle.

In "[[Hollow Mind]]", Hunter attempts to stop a group of witches from using wild magic to invade Belos' mind, only to be intercepted by Luz as they escape, Hunter attempts to scold Luz only to activate the spell that gets them both stuck in Belos' mind, where they are chased by the inner Belos while finding what they believe to be a manifestation of an intense emotion, they discover the memories of Belos' past has been made out of lies and deception to the witches. Hunter tries to deny all of it, believing it to be for the greater good, or that Belos is remembering things wrong, until they see a present memory after Hunter gave him the portal key. He finds out that Belos saying that the Titan has big plans for him was a trick to make him do what he's told and there have been many Golden Guards before Hunter and that all of the previous ones have all betrayed him. Hunter is hurt that Belos tricked him about the Titan and that Belos doesn't really care about him, and Hunter sees the masks of all the Golden Guards. When he and Luz are confronted by Belos, they find out that the being chasing them is a manifestation of palismen souls and that the inner Belos has been with them the whole time, and they watch in horror as Belos destroys the souls. At that point Hunter no longer denies what he has seen and asks Belos what really happened and that the whole thing about their family being destroyed by wild magic was also a lie. Belos tells Hunter that he is a Grimwalker and the one who looked the most like "him" and seemingly gets rid of him. Hunter appears again and protects Luz from Belos (who is really Philip Wittebane) where he finally says Luz's name for the first time, and they both escape from Belos' mind. Hunter is shocked, hurt and confused that everything he thought and believed in Belos and himself were all a lie, Hunter then throws away his cloak and runs away in panic after finally seeing the truth.

In "[[Labyrinth Runners]]", Hunter has been living at Hexside since he ran away and is found by Gus. Gus asks Hunter if he knows where Luz is, he surprised and worried that Luz isn't with Eda and is missing. Hunter saves Gus from illusion coven head Adrian Graves; Gus asks why he's helping and why he ran away from the Emperor's coven which he can't bring himself answer. Hunter begins to panic again when he finds out that Belos is after him, Gus helps him calm down with a breathing technique. Gus tells him that people like Luz, Willow and himself are good people who don't have ulterior motives and are trusted.

After Hunter wakes up, he finds himself in Hexside's Healing homeroom and that Gus has been taken, while everyone knows that he is the Golden Guard and nobody can trust him, Hunter tries to tell them he is on their side, Willow helps to prove his innocence after he brings up her breathing technique, and they work together to rescue Gus. After managing to reach Gus, Hunter says he understands what it's like getting tricked and that he can't trust himself, he says he spent his entire life believing what he's been doing was something good or someone good, but it was a lie, and that there was a part of him that wanted to believe it, but promises that he is Gus' friend. Hunter tries to do the breathing technique for Gus, but Hunter does it wrong and makes whistling sounds. At the end of the episode, he tells everyone at Hexside that Belos has been lying to everyone about wild magic and the Day of Unity, and then tells them the whole story.

In "[[Clouds on the Horizon]]", Hunter, Willow and Gus meet up with Luz as they prepare to stop the Day of Unity, Hunter tells Luz that he is given orders from Darius to protect her. Luz and Hunter talk about what happened in Belos's mindscape, Hunter tells Luz not to tell them he's a Grimwalker, as he doesn't know if he's a witch or a human, but he is copy of someone Belos made disappear. Hunter reveals that he knows that Belos is Philip and that Luz unknowingly helped him as he overheard their conversation in "Hollow Mind", he also empathizes with how Luz feels about it. When group is caught by Odalia and Kikimora, Kikimora taunts Hunter about what Belos is going to do with him, but Luz tells Kikimora to leave him alone. During Alador and Odalia's fight, Kikimora grabs Hunter and manages to escape with him, but it turns out Luz had Gus switch her place with Hunter's, who was confused and didn't know what was going on, and Gus tells him and everyone that Luz wanted to protect Hunter, knowing that Kikimora would try and take him away.

In "[[King's Tide]]", Hunter and the rest go to rescue Luz from Belos. They help Luz fight Belos, when Belos approaches Hunter and tries to trick him into believing that he wanted to help him, but Hunter refuses to believe him, only for Belos to see Flapjack and says the name "Caleb" as he resumes attacking him. When the Collector defeats Belos and begins destroying the Demon Realm, Hunter, Luz, Amity, Willow, and Gus all escape to the Human Realm thanks to King giving himself up, it ends with them landing outside same the old, abandoned house in the Human Realm and the portal back to the Demon Realms closed off. They go to Luz's home and meet her mother.

===Season three===
In "[[Thanks to Them]]", Hunter shows concern for Luz's well-being, worrying about how she's been since Belos' mindscape and tries to ease her when she expresses worry about what their friends will think when they find out about their secrets, but she says that they'll tell them when they're ready, and after explaining everything to Luz's mother Camilla, she helps Hunter and Gus settle in the basement to which Hunter attempts to express gratitude by bowing to her and thanking her for shelter, to which she asks never to do it again and to call her Camilla, as she wishes them goodnight. Over the course of the remaining Summer, Hunter contemplates how his friends will feel when they find out the truth and hallucinates becoming Belos after his hair grows out, resulting in him cutting off most of it in a panic before Willow finishes it properly, until it resembles Luz's former hairstyle, leading him to gain some confidence. In the Fall, while his friends become despondent and homesick, Hunter becomes more cheerful, enthusiastic and generally happier, he's concerned about Flapjack constantly pecking at the floorboards until Amity finds a box containing a map where he was pecking, and they all agree to go out and figure out what it means without Luz to surprise her. That night, Hunter cuts his finger learning how to use a sewing machine, and reveals that he's been making a shirt with wolves which he has taken a fascination to, but while he claims that it's because he needs to pass the time, Gus notices how happy he's become, but when Gus asks about his life in the Emperor's Coven, he says that he misses knowing who he's supposed to be more than being in the coven and shows little desire to return, but hopes to be able to get his friends home.

The next day, as the group sets off to decode the map, Hunter cosplays as a character from ''Cosmic Frontier'', a book series Gus introduced him to, thinking it'll help him blend in, but stays behind to change after they point out that it's too distracting, there he admits to Flapjack that while he's not who he's supposed to be, he likes who he is now, only to find a piece of Belos on the shelf and immediately sees him in the mirror. Hunter becomes paranoid and locks Flapjack in a cage to protect him, then asks Luz to help him take down Belos, he wears an owl mask to cover up his fear as they go looking for him, but it turns out to be just a possum, settling him, and Luz tells him that it's okay to be paranoid after everything they've been through, and Hunter admits that he just wants to keep everyone safe, to which Luz agrees and adds that she also wants to keep him safe too as she admits that she thinks of Hunter as a member of her family, which causes him to break down in tears, he and Luz return to the house, but his shadow bears a resemblance to Belos indicating that he is possessed, while at the house, Gus suggests that he and Hunter dress up as characters from ''Cosmic Frontier'', which excites him. At the Halloween Festival, Hunter is made aware of the plan to find Titan Blood and begins hearing voices of Belos, but ignores them as his skin starts turning green, at the Haunted Hayride, he learns about the story revolving around the brothers Wittebane and becomes unnerved to learn that he is a clone of Philip's brother Caleb, who fell in love with a witch, who apparently led him and Philip to the Demon Realm.

Hunter begins seeing Belos again and panics as he tries to convince Luz to believe him by revealing their plan to find the Titan Blood and go to get it themselves before Belos does, he has Flapjack get the Rebus, but when he hesitates, Belos takes him over briefly and angrily repeats himself, to which he doesn't understand why. Hunter begins losing control of himself and peels of a bandage to find that Belos has entered his body through the cut on his finger and takes off after seeing him again, separating from Luz, but when she finds him, Belos has completely overtaken Hunter and forces him to attack Luz against his will. As their friends join in, they try in vain to reach Hunter until Flapjack gets too close and Belos mortally wounds him, leading Hunter to regain control, where he officially renounces his loyalty to Belos, expresses a desire what he wants and things he likes and attempts to destroy the Titan Blood to prevent him from hurting anyone else, only for Belos to resurge and drown Hunter trying to retrieve the Blood. Camilla rescues Hunter and Belos releases him as he escapes, with Hunter dying, only for Flapjack to revive him at the cost of his own life, which Hunter is immediately made aware of and mourns him. After Luz admits her role in helping Belos find the Collector, Hunter tells Luz that all Belos ever does is use people, and if it wasn't her, it would've been someone else, and insists that they finish this fight together for Flapjack's sake, which Luz agrees. As Hunter approaches the portal, he becomes despondent as he returns to the Boiling Isles, thanking Flapjack for saving him.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Eclipse Lake]]", Eda mentioned Luz getting to know and learn about Hunter in "[[Hunting Palismen]]", Luz describes Hunter "a bad but sad boy".
*In "[[Hollow Mind]]", it is confirmed that Hunter is a Grimwalker, a clone of someone of Belos who is Philip Wittebane knows and there was many Grimwalkers before Hunter.
**It is also revealed that the previous Grimwalkers have "betrayed" Philip at some point. But it is possible that like Hunter in "[[Thanks to Them]]", they had enough of doing what Philip tells them, wanted to do what they like and interests and began to realize what Philip was planning is actually evil and finally rebelled.
**When Philip sees Flapjack with Hunter, he says the name Caleb. This means the person Hunter is the clone of is named Caleb and since Philip and Caleb are the brothers who went missing in the 1600s, the full name of the brother is Caleb Wittebane.
**At the start of "[[Eclipse Lake]]", an open book reveals that the ingredients required to create a Grimwalker are Galdorstones, Palistrom wood, Selkidomus scales, Stone Sleeper lungs, and Bone of Ortet, and also the Grimwalker shown in the book has magenta eyes like Hunter's.
*During early development, Hunter was going to be introduced early in the series. [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cfk7K_hrlhM/]
