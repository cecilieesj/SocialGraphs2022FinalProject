==Role in the film==
She first appeared in the alley to avoid getting seen and put in an animal shelter by [[Stan Cruge]]. She finds a loaf of meat from a tipped-over rubbish bin, says grace, and starts eating it. Stan then traps her in a net and takes her to the shelter. She appeared in the shelter when [[Puppy Paws]] gets put in one of the cages. She makes him feel better by telling him how Stan Cruge lost his Christmas spirit, and even sings a song about having a Christmas spirit. Near the end of the film, she gets adopted by Mikey, who was sick and needed a companion.Â
