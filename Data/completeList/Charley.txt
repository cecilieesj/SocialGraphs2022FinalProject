'''Charley''' was a deleted character and [[Belle]] and her sister [[Clarice (Beauty and the Beast)|Clarice's]] cat from the [[Beauty and the Beast Original Screenplay|1989 screenplay]] of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.

==Role in the [[Beauty and the Beast|film]]==
Charley is first seen in the alternate opening being chased around by a goat as [[Maurice]] and his family arrive at the [[Belle's cottage|cottage]]. In order to escape his pursuer, the cat jumps upon [[Phillipe|Orson's]] back where he is spotted by [[Belle]] and 
[[Clarice (Beauty and the Beast)|Clarice]] who decide to keep him. He is next seen at Belle's birthday party, running to hide after he gets startled when she blows out the candles on her cake. Later on, Charley is hanging out with the girls in their room, when suddenly, [[Marguerite]] comes in and almost steps on him, resulting in him getting caught under her dress. However, Charley is able to get out and quickly darts under the bed where Clarice is hiding. He is last seen looking out the window on the night Maurice has failed to return, getting miffed when Clarice opens the window and some snow accidentally blows into his face.

Concept art reveals that Charley would've later snuck aboard the enchanted sedan chair and accompanied Belle to the [[Beast's Castle]].
