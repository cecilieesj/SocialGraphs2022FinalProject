'''Emma Evangeline Ross''' is one of the main characters in ''[[Jessie (TV series)|Jessie]]'' and the spin-off, ''[[BUNK'D]]''. She is a bubbly, albeit cynical 19-year old girl. She's the eldest of the Ross family and the only biological child.

==Background==
Emma is the only biological child in the Ross family. In the first episode, we meet her as the girly, pretty and oldest kid in the Ross family, but certainly not the smartest. A little boy crazy, she is obsessed with clothes and shoes, and usually has "problems" with her wardrobe. She often gets into fights with her slightly younger brother, [[Luke Ross|Luke]], but they do get along sometimes.

===Personality===
Emma is a girly, sweet, and very fashionable teenage girl. Although, she is very silly and dorky, she tries hard. She also displays a little bit of sass in everything she does. Emma has a very good sisterly bond with her sister Zuri, but usually fights with [[Luke]] and occasionally Ravi. She is assumed to be a Directioner (someone who likes One Direction) because on a few occasions she brings up the band, either in random conversation, or a dream.

===Physical appearance===
[[File:Tumblr m3o4mr9t1M1qeewuqo1 500.png|thumb|200px|Emma in Season 1 of Jessie.]]
Emma has long, blonde, straight hair and hazel eyes. She has pale, creamy skin and is pretty tall for her age. She has a curvy body too. She likes girly clothes and is very beautiful. She sometimes curls her hair. She normally wears her hair down, but sometimes also wears it up. She wears glasses in some episodes, suggesting she may be wearing contacts most of the time.

==Relationships==
===[[Jessie Prescott]]===
Jessie is Emma's nanny.

Emma and Jessie seem to have the closest relationship in the family, most likely because they are close in age. Although Emma gets mad at her often for not understanding her, she loves Jessie very much, as though she is her sister.

===[[Luke Ross]]===
Luke is Emma's younger adopted brother. They have the classical brother-sister relationship, they tend to fight and argue a lot, but love each other very much.

===[[Ravi Ross]]===
Ravi is Emma's younger brother.

Emma and Ravi, along with Luke, often form a trio. Not much is said about how close they are individually.

===[[Zuri Ross]]===
Zuri is Emma's younger sister. She loves Zuri very much and enjoys having tea parties with her. In season 2, they don't hang out that much.

===Caleb===
Caleb is Emma's ex-boyfriend.

Caleb and Emma first met in G.I. Jessie.

===[[Xander McCormick]]===
Xander McCormick is Emma's boyfriend.

Emma and Xander first met at Camp Kikiwaka and fell in love with each other in the spin-off Bunk'd.
