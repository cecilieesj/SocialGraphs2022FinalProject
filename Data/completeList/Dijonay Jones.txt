'''Dijonay Jones''' is a recurring character in [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[The Proud Family]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Dijonay has yellow-blonde hair, though it is stated to be a wig in the first episode of [[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]]. Her hair is tied in a ponytail, but the rest stays down. Dijonay wears a lavender button-up collared shirt that exposes her stomach with a sky blue jacket over it, which matches her bobbles and a blue skirt that reaches the top of her knees.

== Personality ==
Dijonay is a rather complicated person. On the one hand, she's not exactly the most loyal of friends as she habit of back-stabbing people or not doing the things a friend should be doing. On the other hand, she does often feel bad when she does do these things and have a lot of regret. She has shown to be selfish but also caring at the same time. 

Clearly not the most ideal of friends (as Suga Mama often tells Penny) but at least she does not treat Penny as poorly as LaCienega. By ''Louder And Prouder,'' Dijonay has shown she is trying to be a better friend to Penny. To begin with, she supported Penny and Kareem’s relationship that she was not happy at LaCienega stealing him from Penny. When Penny's singing voice changed, Dijonay defended Penny against LaCienega for insulting the latter. Dijonay came through for Penny when she refused to leave Al Roker's college reality before the trial period expired by sending the link to the contract so Oscar can bail her out. Dijonay also takes her siblings' needs more seriously, though she tends to do so at the expense of others. 

Her well known trait, was her obsession with Sticky, who doesn’t return her feelings, which caused him to leave when his family moved. After Maya and KG moved into Sticky’s old house, Dijonay obsessed over KG the same way she did with Sticky, whom she mistook for him when they first met.

==History==
===''[[The Proud Family]]''===
She is [[Penny Proud|Penny]]'s selfish, chubby and enthusiastic best friend. She loves to gossip and has gotten Penny into trouble many times. She has an obsessive crush on [[Sticky Webb]], who is trying to avoid her affection. Eventually, Penny stopped trusting Dijonay, since the latter always mistreated her, though the girls still remain friends. Dijonay's name is a pun on dijonnaise, and she has nine wild younger siblings named after all spices, seasonings, and condiments. That explains, it's fitting that Dijonay is an good cook. Her biggest talent however, is poetry writing and reciting. Penny got jealous of her once because they both discovered together that Dijonay was really better at it. She is also a member of the girl group LPDZ consisting of herself and her three friends Penny, LaCienega and Zoey. She stated that her family is originally from Louisiana meaning she was not born in Wizville. She's also know both Penny and LaCienega since they were preschool-aged.

Dijonay hasn't always been a great friend to Penny, but she has shown enough evidence that she does indeed care about her.

==Trivia==
*Dijonay's name is a pun on the name of Best Foods'/Hellmann's Djionnaise - and she has nine younger siblings named after all spices, seasonings, and condiments.
*In "[[Makeover]]", it is revealed Dijonay is putting a pillow inside of the back of Zoey's skirt. 
*Despite being a recurring character, Dijonay, along with Penny, Trudy, Oscar, Suga Mama, BeBe, and CeCe are the only characters to be in all the episodes.
**However, she was absent in [[Old Towne Road]], meaning none of Penny’s friends have appeared in every single episode of the franchise.
*Despite Dijonay being an obvious poor influence/friend (unlike LaCienega, who acts selfishly out of insecurity), Penny never stops being friends with her.
