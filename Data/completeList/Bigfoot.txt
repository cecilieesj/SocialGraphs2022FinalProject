'''Bigfoot''', also known as '''Sasquatch''', is a large, hairy, ape-like creature thought by some to inhabit the Pacific Northwest of [[North America]]. While the existence of Bigfoot has been a subject of debate and mystery in the real world, Bigfoot (and occasionally Bigfoots) has appeared as a notable character throughout some Disney media.

== Appearances in Disney media==
===''[[Darkwing Duck]]''===
In contrast to other appearances, the episode "[[Dances with Bigfoot]]" features not a single legendary creature but a whole tribe of them. Known as the '''Bigfoot Tribe''', these creatures resemble brown-furred, bucktoothed natives with large feet. They live in the Pacific Northwest and sacrifice victims to a volcano god. They are led by a rather plump chief and their toughest fighter is the ironically-named "Born with Delicate Bone Structure".

They speak a strange language in which every spoken phrase begins with "[[Wikipedia:The Honeymooners|Humina humina humina]]" and is followed by other phrases that sound like those from other known languages, such as "[[Wikipedia:Shama Lama Ding Dong|Shama Lama Ding Dong]]", "[[Wikipedia:E pluribus unun|E pluribus unum]]", "[[Wikipedia:Be-Bop-a-Lula|Be-Bop-a-Lula]]", "[[Wiktionary:Soup du jour|Soup du jour]]", and "[[Wikipedia:Topo Gigio|Topo Gigio]]". Despite the primitive life they live, the tribe does have some access to modern technology, such as spotlights and even their own commercial airliner (but which doesn't work).

In the episode, the tribe kidnapped [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] to sacrifice him to their volcano god. Unaware of this, he initially believed that they intended to worship him for his resemblance to one of their totem pole gods, not knowing that said god was the Snack God who gets eaten by the Glutton God. When [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]] and [[Honker Muddlefoot|Honker]] came to rescue him, they informed him of the tribe's true intentions. Darkwing then tried to talk himself out of the sacrifice, but was instead put through a series of tests to prove his worthiness. Unfortunately, once he passed all of the tests and the tribe dubbed him "Dances with Bigfoot", it was revealed that the tests were to prove his worthiness of being fed to the volcano god.

The next morning, the tribe brought him, Gosalyn, and Honker to the top of a volcano where the three were to be sacrificed. The tribe pushed the trio into the volcano with their spears, but the three managed to climb back out before the volcano erupted. Angry over the three upsetting their volcano god, the Bigfoot Tribe chased after the trio down a river in a canoe. But after Honker located the [[Thunderquack]] hidden nearby (he and Gosalyn had previously sent it here via auto-pilot), the three boarded the craft and flew back home. The Bigfoot Tribe attempted to pursue them in the air with their airliner, but the chief couldn't get it to work.

That night, long after Darkwing, Gosalyn, and Honker's escape, the chief declared that the tribe would target another individual who resembled one of their totem pole gods: the "[[Launchpad McQuack|clod god]]".

===''[[Goof Troop]]''===
[[file:1992-dingo-50.jpg|thumb|left|The female Bigfoot from the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' episode "[[Winter Blunderland]]".]]
Bigfoot is first mentioned in the episode "[[Date with Destiny]]", in which [[Max Goof|Max]] was supposed to have written a term paper on Bigfoot as part of his Mysterious of Nature report. However, he misunderstood the assignment and instead wrote his paper about a monster truck called Bigfoot.

The actual Bigfoot creature appears as a guest star in the episode "[[Winter Blunderland]]", in which she is a female Bigfoot and sports a rather different design from the male Bigfoot that would later appear in ''A Goofy Movie''.

She lived alone in a furnished mountain cave. When [[Pete]] learned of a Bigfoot sighting in a TV news report, he took a trip to the mountains to get a photo of Goofy dressed as Bigfoot, in an attempt to earn himself fame and publicity. However, the real Bigfoot showed up unexpectedly and brought Pete back to her cave. Pete tried to trick her into letting herself be taken back to his car lot, but when Goofy (still dressed as Bigfoot) came crashing into her cave, Bigfoot mistook him for a male of her kind and took a shine to him, kicking Pete out of the cave so she could be alone with Goofy.

She tried to woo Goofy by treating him to a romantic date of dinner and dancing, and refused to let him leave. When Goofy finally managed to get outside the cave, Max and [[P.J.]] mistook him for the real Bigfoot and tried to bag him, which sent the three of them tumbling down the mountainside, leaving the real Bigfoot in heartbroken tears back at the cave's entrance.

Later, Pete returned to Bigfoot's cave with a camera crew only to find Bigfoot gone. She'd gone after Goofy and the boys, only to find Goofy's disguise left on the ground. Assuming the worst upon seeing the costume, Bigfoot broke down in tears. She returned to her cave with the costume, where she lay it to rest nearby, marking a grave for it with a stick.

Witnessing this act, Pete hatched a plan to disguise himself like he did with Goofy, in hopes that Bigfoot would take to him like she did with Goofy. Initially fooled, Bigfoot was overjoyed by the sight of the disguised Pete, but quickly realized he was an impostor once she smelled him. Pete did his best impression of Goofy to convince her otherwise, but when she overheard him plotting to capture her, she chased him up a tree and accidentally caused an avalanche. The snow chased her off and sent Pete tumbling down the mountain, crashing into a lodge.

The man who originally reported the initial Bigfoot sighting at the beginning of the episode found Pete knocked out in his costume and mistook him for Bigfoot. The disguised Pete was locked in a cage and handcuffed with his mouth taped closed, drawing much business to the lodge as people came from all over to see him, believing him to be the real Bigfoot. Max and P.J. laughed at Pete's predicament while Goofy (no longer in disguise) was once more chased through the woods by the lovesick Bigfoot.

===''[[A Goofy Movie]]''===
[[file:Bigfoot scares Goofy and Max.png|thumb|right|250px|Bigfoot scares away [[Goofy]] and [[Max Goof]] in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'']]
A male Bigfoot is the secondary antagonist of this movie.

He was first seen standing over a piece of steak owned by Pete and eating a tree bark. He is about to eat the steak, but he follows it to the lake and gets accidentally lured by Goofy and Max using a fishing pole. Bigfoot then scares Goofy and Max back to camp and has them trapped in their car while Pete and P.J. escape in their RV. He then pulls off pieces of the camera, and then throws the car keys away when Goofy and Max notice that he has them.

He then makes an act on sock puppets and runs back. When he looks at Goofy trying to get a can of alphabet soup on the front of their car, he comes back to Goofy and Max, but he got hit. However, a set of headphones landed into his ears and listens to the song "Stayin' Alive" by The Bee Gees and he enjoys listening to it. Bigfoot was lastly seen getting on top of their car and starting to fall asleep. Bigfoot was not seen for the rest of the film, but he lets Goofy and Max go and returns all their stuff before returning to his family.

This version of Bigfoot briefly appeared in the [[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'']] movie as one of the freed victims of Sweet Pete's bootlegging operation, having been fused with Fred Flintstone.

===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===
[[file:Bigfoot-TimonAndPumbaa.jpg|thumb|right]]
Naturally, a Bigfoot appears in the ''Timon & Pumbaa'' episode "[[Bigfoot, Littlebrain]]".

As [[Timon]] reads a tabloid newspaper, he stumbles upon a photograph of Bigfoot, who [[Pumbaa]] idolizes because he is hairy, dirty, smelly and wanders around doing nothing; just like them. The warthog aims to search for Bigfoot, which Timon objects to until he gains interest in the cloud of bugs in the photo.

During their search, they discover a huge footprint in the ground. Shortly afterwards, Timon is accidentally stepped on by Bigfoot himself. Bigfoot asks the two if they'd like to be his friends, to which they respond by eating the many bugs circling his head.

After their feast, Timon and Pumbaa proceed to leave, but Bigfoot is left lonely and upset due to the loss of his bug companions. Realizing this with guilt, Pumbaa coheres Timon into staying with Bigfoot. Overjoyed, Bigfoot begins playing games with them.

The next morning, Timon and Pumbaa come up with a plan to distract Bigfoot while they find him some new friends. They capture swarms of flies from a swamp, but Bigfoot ultimately befriends a butterfly instead. Timon and Pumbaa wind up frantically trying to swat at the bugs they caught, while Bigfoot tells his new butterfly companion that he taught them how to play that game.

===''[[Donald Duck Adventures]]''===
A male Bigfoot and a female Bigfoot appear together in ''Donald Duck Adventures'' issue 17, they live together in the forest.

While [[Donald Duck]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] were watching TV news report about the existence of Bigfoot, they go out to the forest spending time for lunch, but Donald gets dressed as a male Bigfoot and was mistaken by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] with the real Bigfoot. Real female Bigfoot comes next to Donald, falls in love with him but the male Bigfoot gets jealous of Donald and almost hits him with a tree, but was crushed by rocks. When Donald still spends time dating the female Bigfoot, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] talk with a hunter about the costume that Donald used, they go out and hunts the female Bigfoot for a jail. The male Bigfoot didn’t dies, he stares Donald, but was sad because the female Bigfoot was kidnapped, Donald decides to save the female Bigfoot and takes her back to the forest. Male Bigfoot and female Bigfoot wave for [[Donald Duck]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] when they are in a airplane traveling.

===''The Muppet Show Comic Book''===
[[File:BigfootAndSam.JPG|thumb|200px]]
In ''The Muppet Show Comic Book: Meet the Muppets'', issue 4, [[Sam the Eagle (Muppets)|Sam the Eagle]] rails against gullibility, using belief in Sasquatch as an example. Behind Sam, a Sasquatch happens by and becomes offended. Unaware of the creature's presence, Sam continues his tirade even as the Sasquatch reaches menacingly for Sam's head. [[Miss Piggy]] suddenly appears and defeats the Sasquatch in hand-to-hand combat. Sam finishes his editorial, unaware of having been in any danger.

===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===
[[file:GetThatBigfoot.jpg|thumb|right|350px]]
Bigfoot is prominently mentioned throughout the episode "[[Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face!]]", but does not make a physical appearance. [[Clyde Flynn|Grandpa Clyde]] sings [[He's Bigfoot|a song]] about Bigfoot to [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]], [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]], the [[Fireside Girls]] and other kids. Later that night, Phineas tells a scary story about Bigfoot. The kids are scared, and then "Bigfoot" appears. Phineas then reveals that it was just Ferb controlling fake Bigfoots. [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] however, gets annoyed by the prank. Phineas then warns Candace that her screaming might attract a real Bigfoot. Candace then mocks him, saying that will never happen. As she says this, a real "Bigfoot" approaches Candace from behind. She sees him and asks what it is made of, asking if it was "Popsicle sticks and glitter", but Phineas tells her that it was a real Bigfoot. It then eats Candace, shocking everyone and making them run away, screaming. Candace and [[Betty Jo Flynn|Grandma Betty Jo]] then come out of the back, laughing. They leave to get the kids and drink hot cocoa.

[[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz]] hears the screaming and tries to find where it is coming from, but falls off his vacation home. Later, he comes back up covered in leaves. His date thinks he is Bigfoot and knocks him off. She hears his screaming and realizes she knocked off Dr. Doofenshmirtz. After the kids left, he falls on the strings of Phineas and Ferb's Bigfoot. He tries to clean off the leaves but the Bigfoot dummies by made Ferb appear making Doofenshmirtz run away in terror.

Candace is then seen telling the kids that she got them, saying only immature people would believe in monsters. She then sees Dr. Doofenshmirtz being chased by the Bigfoot dummies. She screams and runs into the house. The kids look and see nothing. [[Baljeet Tjinder|Baljeet]] comments that she overacts too much, and everyone agrees.

===''[[Gravity Falls]]''===
Bigfoot appears for a split second in the opening theme.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
[[file:Gavin.png|thumb|right|200px]]
A sentient version of Bigfoot named Gavin appears in the episode ''[[The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!]]''. Prior to the events of the episode, Gavin was found with a thorn in his paw by Huey, who removed the thorn, hoarded him in McDuck Manor, and named him Tenderfeet. However, Gavin secretly takes advantage of Huey's kindness to crash at the manor.

When Huey overhears Scrooge preparing to search for an intruder who is searching for his Number One Dime, Huey misinterprets the vow as Scrooge catching on to "Tenderfeet," and has his brothers keep "Tenderfeet" away from Scrooge. During this, Louie discovers Gavin's secret. Though Gavin threatens Louie, Louie shaves some hair from Gavin to convince Huey and Dewey that Gavin needs to return to the forest. Scrooge manages to catch Gavin as the boys return him to the forest, but the boys convince Scrooge not to kill Gavin. Before Gavin is set free, Louie smirks in victory.

===''[[Vampirina]]''===
[[file:Uncle Bob.jpeg|thumb|right|Bigfoot in Vampirina]]

==Trivia==

* Though Bigfoot does not make an appearance in the original [[1987]] ''[[DuckTales]]'' animated series, a female Bigfoot is mentioned in the episode "[[Ducky Horror Picture Show]]", in which she is said to be a member of Monsters Unanimous.
*In the French dub of ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', Bigfoot is instead referred to as the [[Yeti]].
* In ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', there is a tall and skinny member of the [[The Gammas|Gammas]] who looks like a shaved counterpart of Bigfoot's original design from [[A Goofy Movie|the previous film]], due to having the same black snout. A conspiracy theory that they're the same character, but Disney likely just wanted to recycle a preexisting design.
*In ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Bigfoot is mentioned by [[Mike Wazowski]] as one of the many monsters who were banished to the human world for some unspecified crime. [[Yeti (Monsters, Inc.)|Yeti]], who was also banished and was friends with him, stated that he was so distraught he fashioned a pair of underwear made out of poison oak and "wore it on his head like a tiara". Because of this, he started calling himself King Itchy.
**Bigfoot was supposed to be appear in the cancelled film ''[[Monsters, Inc. 2 (Circle 7 Screenplay)|Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scareidice]]''. Contrary to his description in the previous film, Bigfoot would have been female and serve as [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]]'s love interest. The film was to end with her and several other banished monsters returning to their world.
*In the ''Recess'' episode "Beyond a Reasonable Scout", Bigfoot was mentioned by the head Woodchuck Scout, where he came across a cave and upon smelling the ground deduced that Sasquatch was inside, although the banging drums from his headquarters calling for him to return for an urgent mission (relating to Gus and Mikey not being allowed into the Woodchuck Scouts by the troupe leader for suspicious reasons) forced him to abandon his quarry, although not before yelling towards the cave entrance that he will return.
*During filming of ''[[Star Wars|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi]]'', orange-vested film crews were required to escort Peter Mayhew while he's suited up as Chewbacca during filming within the Pacific Northwest in order to ensure no one mistook him for Bigfoot and thus ended up shot.
