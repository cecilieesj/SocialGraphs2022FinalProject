'''Tiki''' is a beautiful (and apparently high-class) Maltese terrier that [[Pluto]] has a brief flirtation with. She first appears in ''[[Pluto's Penthouse Sweet]]'' and made a cameo in ''[[Pluto's Seal Deal]]''.

She became attracted to Pluto the first time she saw him. Pluto had difficulty getting up to her penthouse thanks to [[Butch the Bulldog]] guarding the building. After reaching the penthouse, Pluto was smothered with Tiki's kisses. At first, Pluto was happy and imagined getting married to Tiki, having children and growing old with her. However, after thinking about how Mickey's life would be lonely without him Pluto tries to get out of there. Tiki takes every effort to make sure he doesn't leave, constantly puckering her lips and even leaving Pluto's body covered with lipstick marks once. When he got to the elevator, he kept going up and down, afraid of having to face Tiki in the penthouse or Butch on the ground floor. When the elevator came up, Tiki tackled the dog inside, turning out to be Butch and not Pluto. Butch then turns the tables on her and gave her a kiss. Now Tiki is in love with Butch.
