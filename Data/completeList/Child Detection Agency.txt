{{Quote|Oh, not the CDA.|[[Henry J. Waternoose]] upon seeing the CDA}}
The '''Child Detection Agency''' (or '''CDA''' for short and later called ''Comedy Detection Agency'') are a group of agents in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2001]] animated film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]] ''and its [[2013]] [[Monsters University|prequel]]. They wear biohazard suits throughout the film. CDA Agent 001 is [[Roz]], as revealed toward the film's climax.

==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''===
For most of the film are a CIA-like group whose main job is to search and take away and/or destroy any type of children contaminant, like a Biohazard Unit. They come in a wide variety of forms and all wear bio-hazard suits, for fear of contamination. If any human object appears in the Monster World, they arrive to destroy it and decontaminate anyone who comes in contact with such objects.

The CDA is first seen arriving at the [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc. factory]] after [[Jerry (Monsters, Inc.)|Jerry]] calls the agents upon hearing Charlie's alert about a child's sock on [[George Sanderson]]'s back. The agents arrive at the factory with some being rappelled into the scare floor down a rope attached to CDA helicopters. Outside the factory, CDA trucks are parked in the parking lot in front of the main entrance doors, with other CDA agents opening the truck doors and entering the main lobby. [[Roz]] closes the office door to allow the agents to remove the sock, which is then sealed, blown into smithereens, and its remains are vacuumed up. Then the agents decontaminate George by shaving his fur off, having him showered, and placing a cone on his head. After this, they take the band-aid off his back. Waternoose also implied that the CDA had previously been dispatched to the factory at least a month earlier, presumably for the same reason as the recent dispatch, as they serve no other purpose. The agents are seen again arriving at [[Harryhausen's]] after the Sushi Chef calls the CDA about a human girl nicknamed [[Boo]] in the restaurant, forcing the building to be evacuated. They arrive at the restaurant and round-up almost every patron that they suspect to be contaminated, including [[Celia Mae]], for decontamination, and they envelop the restaurant in a gigantic blue force field. Later on the news, the CDA refused to confirm or deny the presence of a human child.

The CDA deployed in full force when all of [[Monstropolis]] became aware of the incidents of Boo's invasion into the Monster World, and the Monsters, Inc. facility was thoroughly searched for evidence, as Sulley's duffel bag was found at the scene of Harryhausen's. As Sulley tries to get Boo who accidentally loses a piece of her monster costume after falling into the trash can, two of the CDA members ask Sulley for an autograph to give to Stephanie, the daughter of agent 00002 which follows a piece of the costume being dumped with the trash. Subsequently, three CDA agents burst from the restroom stalls to pounce on George when some of Boo's toys Sulley stuffed in his locker fall on him.

Upon learning Sulley and Mike are the ones who have brought Boo in, [[Henry J. Waternoose III|Mr. Waternoose]] banished them to the [[Himalayas]] so he and [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] (who had hired Waternoose for the plot) could take Boo and forcefully extract screams from her, then kidnap thousands of more children to extract their screams, and bring the company back on top. Following Randall's defeat, Waternoose tried to have the CDA arrest Sulley and Mike, but Mike distracts the agents by tossing a sock off his tongue on one random agent, causing them to pounce on him before leading them on a chase right to the factory simulator, where he streams Waternoose's confession of the plot to the CDA, resulting in his arrest. Shortly afterward, [[Roz]] enters and, to Sulley and Mike's surprise, reveals the truth that she has not been a dispatcher, but the CDA leader all along, having worked undercover to expose Randall and Waternoose's plot. After Sulley leaves Boo at her room, the CDA shreds Boo's door to prevent future monsters from getting into her room. The CDA is last seen locking Waternoose in their truck to bring him to prison. Though it seems like Sulley would never see Boo again, Mike surprises him with the fixed door.

According to Monsters Inc. Laugh Floor, when Sulley discovers that laughs are more powerful than screams, the Child Detection Agency becomes the '''Comedy Detection Agency'''. Their job also changes to solving if a joke is funny or not. Similarly, they also were responsible for acting as ushers for the company musical play "[[Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me|Put that thing back where it came from or so help me]]." It could presumably be implied that CDA would have dissolved and disposed their biohazard suits if that happened.

===''[[Monsters University]]''===
The CDA makes their first chronological appearance at ''Monsters University''. Following [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] and [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]]'s intrusion in the Human World, the emergency was declared and the CDA was dispatched to take charge of the situation. [[Roz]] is seen overseeing the operation (as an easter egg).

==Printed media==
In the comic sequel series called the [[Monsters, Inc.: Laugh Factory|Laugh Factory]] (which would later be non canon due to the newly developed TV series ''Monsters at Work''), the CDA takes a strong role of the police.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==

The CDA characters are seen in various parades. CDA agents are also seen in the rides [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]], [[Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!]], and [[Monsters, Inc. Ride & Go Seek]]. Most of the CDA figures in Mike & Sulley to the Rescue are redressed animatronic celebrities from its predecessor, the failed [[Superstar Limo]].

==Trivia==
*Their decontamination methods are often painful.
*CDA might be a pun on the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).
*It is unknown what they look like under their biohazard suits. Even so, the suits resemble various "species" of monsters, so speculations can be made.
*The CDA may also be the monsters' equivalent of the police, especially the SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) or the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation). However, they work more like a bomb-squad or a biohazard unit.
*Most CDA agents have two legs at least due to the boots. Roz is an exception, being a slug.
*The signal for the CDA, 2319, may be a reference to the letters "W" and "S", which are the 23rd and 19th letters of the Latin alphabet. WS may stand for "white sock", a common threat to monsters, which can only be ridden by the CDA. W and S are also the first letters of Mike and Sulley's last names (Wazowski and Sullivan).
** This was somewhat confirmed in the [[Monsters at Work|''Monsters at Work'']] episode "[[The Damaged Room]]" where the code "418", meaning "Damaged Room" , has its numbers line up to the letters "D" and "R", which are the 4th and 18th letters of the Latin alphabet. This would mean that "white sock" is really a catch-all term for any and all human clutter that sticks to the monsters as they scare kids.
*Agent 00002 is the only member who is revealed to be a father, having a daughter named Stephanie.
*The organization bears many similarities to the real-life [[Wikipedia:Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), due to their uniform (hazmat suits) and the nature of their work.
*Since there are 5-digit numerals, it can be presumed that at the current moment, CDA has at least 10,000 operators.
*There are at least six different CDA body types.
*Many of their uniforms erroneously have the same number.
