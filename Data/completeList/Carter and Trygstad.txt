==Trivia==
*When Ben asked the FBI was here, Terrell referenced them as the ''[[Wikipedia:Men in black|Men in Black]]''. It also shows similarities with their position within the government, with the FBI searching for "genetic guinea pigs" as the MIB covers up UFO conspiracy theories.
**It also shows similarities with two agents yet differences with their personalities: Carter represents [[Wikipedia:Agent J|Agent J]] and Trygstad represents [[Wikipedia:Agent K|Agent K]].
*During the chase sequence, there is somewhat an error; in the first scene Carter and Trygstad drive a Ford Expedition MAX, though it is later switched to a Chevrolet Suburban.
