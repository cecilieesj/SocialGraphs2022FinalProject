'''Fernanda Pizazzo''' is a character in ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''.

==Role in the series==
Fernanda first appeared in the episode "[[Great Expotations]]", as one of the inventors taking part of Corona's science fair. As she presents her creation to spectators, she unabashedly expresses her confidence that the fair's judge, Dr. Croix, will award her the winning prize by the end. Though her invention doesn't compare to the others, such as those created by [[Rapunzel]] or [[Varian]], she wins by a landslide, as Croix is apparently more interested in a flashy display, rather than breaking new ground in the scientific field.

===Physical Appearance===
Fernanda is a tall, slender woman with brown skin, dark cyan eyes, and black curly hair. For gypsy wear, she has a deep pink head scarf, a pair of turquoise earrings, a dress made of deep pink blouse with light blue brims on the collar and ruffles at the end of her long sleeves, a deep pink and blue corset, and dark pink skirt with pink trimming, and black boots.

==Trivia==
*Judging by her comments, she appears to find Dr. Croix physically attractive, although this may have been an attempt to further boost her chances of winning.
*Fernanda resembles a fortune teller character present in early concepts of ''[[Tangled]]''.
