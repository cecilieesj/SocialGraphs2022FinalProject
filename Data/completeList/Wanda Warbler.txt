'''Wanda Warbler''' is a country singer from Sunny Gulch. She is nicknamed "The Wanderin' Warbler" for her propensity to wander off without telling anyone where she's going.

==''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]''==
Wanda first appears in the ''Mickey Mouse Funhouse'' episode "[[The Wandrin' Warbler!]]", where [[Mickey Mouse]] and the gang travel to Sunny Gulch to hear her sing. They meet her when [[Pluto]] hears her yodeling and runs off to find her. While Wanda is greeting him, the others show up and Mickey scolds Pluto for wandering off by himself. [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]], who runs the tavern where Wanda performs, shows up and finds that Wanda and Pluto are alike in that they both often wander off.

While Mickey and his friends wait for Wanda to appear and perform, they learn that she wandered off and her whereabouts are unknown. Mickey and Pluto discover her in a ditch, which she fell into while wandering by. Mickey and Pluto fall in as well, and Wanda realizes that wandering off without telling anyone can get her in a lot of trouble. [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] and [[Donald Duck|Donald]] show up and rescue them and they make their way back to the tavern where they perform the song "Won't Go Wanderin'".

Wanda reappears in "[[Polka Dots and Don'ts]]" as a guest at Mickey's fancy dinner party. She helps Minnie in her search for something fancy to wear at the party, but Minnie can't find a hat or boots that are her size in Sunny Gulch.

==Trivia==
*Wanda is modeled after her voice actress, country singer Mickey Guyton, and is one of the few human characters on the show.
