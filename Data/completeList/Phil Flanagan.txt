He's a member of the Knights of the Iron Dagger and the Principal of the high school in the film. [[Edgar Dalloway]] found him and revealed the past of his family, gaining Phil's help in trying to permanently seal the portal to Halloweentown. However, once he sees the creatures of Halloweentown (even [[Agatha Cromwell]]) aren't a threat to everyone, he gave up his membership as a knight.
