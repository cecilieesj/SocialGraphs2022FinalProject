}}'''Doctor Syclocks''' is the villain of the [[Super Goof]] comic story "The Strange case of Doctor Syclocks" by Bob Ogle and [[Paul Murry]]. He steals rubies from jewelry clocks and uses cuckoo clocks as bombs, and always emits a noisy "tick tock". he is eventually found to be a defective clockwork man created by [[Geppetto]].

In "[[The Return Of Dr. Syclocks?|A Volta Do Dr. Tictac?]]" the [[Red Bat]] faces a jewelry thief and when he describes him to [[Chief O'Hara]], he quickly recognises him as Dr. Syclocks. However, it actually is [[Dangerous Dan and Idgit the Midget|Idgit the Midget]] in disguise, who did it as a diversionary tactic to have the police guarding jewelries while he and his partner [[Dangerous Dan and Idgit the Midget|Dangerous Dan]] robbed the bank. However, they are found by the police because they didn't follow Syclocks' Modus Operandi, as they used dynamite and stole more than just rubies.
