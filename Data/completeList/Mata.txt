}}'''Mata''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2000]] animated feature film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''. She is a waitress atÂ [[Mudka's Meat Hut]], a restaurant in the jungle. She was initially only credited as the Waitress.
==Appearances==
===''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''===
Mata's only appearance in the first film was when [[Kuzco]] and [[Pacha]] discover a Mudka's Meat Hut while on their journey to the palace, and decide to eat there with Kuzco dressed as a girl since llamas are not allowed in. After Kuzco goes to talk to the chef about the food, Pacha begins to eat until [[Yzma]] and [[Kronk]] arrive shortly afterwards and he overhears Yzma discussing their plans to kill Kuzco, so Pacha goes to Kuzco and attempts to warn him. Mata mistakes Kronk for the chef after Kuzco's constant demands caused the original chef to quit. Mata is last seen when Pacha convinced her it was Yzma's birthday in order to cause a distraction allowing Pacha and Kuzco to escape.

===''[[The Emperor's New Groove 2: Kronk's New Groove|Kronk's New Groove]]''===
Mata plays a larger role in the sequel working with Kronk who is the head chef and owner of a Mudka's. But once Kronk receives a message from [[Papi (The Emperor's New Groove)|his father]] who is coming to meet Kronk's wife and see his house on the hill, Kronk dreads what will happen when his father learns the truth, and begins telling Mata how Yzma eventually tricked him into helping her with a fake "youth potion" to con money out of elderly villagers, and how he developed a love interest, named [[Birdwell]]. Mata was among Kronk's friends who stand up for Kronk when his father scolds him for not having anything. Mata and Papi were happy for Kronk when he later reunited with Birdwell. Mata is last seen dancing with Papi during the closing musical number.

===''[[The Emperor's New School]]''===
Mata makes a few appearance in the series, most noticeably seen serving as the Lunch Lady of Kuzco Academy rather than working at Mudka's Meat Hut as a waitress. Her old job was taken over by a new character named [[Yatta]]. The series is also the only time Mata was ever referred to by name.
