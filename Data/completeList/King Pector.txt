====[[From Hippsodeth, with Love]]====
King Pector swoops down Galifem on his golden chariot, led by a winged unicorn to convenes Queen Hippsodeth to fall in love with him but Queen Hippsodeth has fallen in love with [[the Sultan]] ignoring Pector's advances and sends the Sultan a love letter with a date invitation, [[Jasmine]] thinks it may be unsafe for him to go. After returning a letter declining the offer (with [[Iago]] adding a few insults), Hippsodeth reads the letter and gets angry, thinking it was the Sultan who wrote the insult. King Pector also reads the letter and decides to battle the Sultan to the death for the insult. When Pector reached [[Agrabah]], he begin bombarding the palace with lightning until the Sultan faces him. So Jasmine convinces [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] to disguise himself as the Sultan so he can come up with an explanation. Aladdin agrees and they all go to sleep. [[Scara]] and the other Galifem warriors kidnap Aladdin and put him in the dungeon. The next day, [[Abu]] frees Aladdin and the two escape. When Pector gets to Agrabah, he sees Aladdin, who he mistakes for the Sultan, and fights him. When the Sultan sees what's going on, Pector sees him and grabs him. Queen Hippsodeth and Scara show up to stop Pector. After the fight, Hippsodeth talks to the Sultan about the insult on the letter and everyone realizes that it was Iago who wrote it. Jasmine tells her father that the reason they hid the letter from him is that they didn't want him to get hurt. The Sultan tells her that it's for him to decide what he wants to do and he decides to accept Hippsodeth's love. Pector now has a romantic interest on Scara.
