===Personality===
The beast is terrifying. He also possesses great strength, which comes from his golden tooth. He can also breath fire. However, despite his ferocious qualities, he is still willing to request help from others. Additionally, he gives them a favor in return.

==Appearances==

After [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] fell into his pit, the beast ate them. However, he immediately spit them back out. He then began to sob to them about his missing gold tooth.
