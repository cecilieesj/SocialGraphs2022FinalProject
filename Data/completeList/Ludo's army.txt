== About ==
They were mean, evil, greedy, scary and huge monsters.
In season 1, Ludo has an '''army''' composed of his loyal monster minions who help him in his quest to get Star Butterfly's wand and take over the universe with it. In "[[Marco Grows a Beard]]", Toffee usurps Ludo and takes over as the army's leader.

In Season 2, Ludo obtains a new army with a giant spider, a bald eagle, rats, and other monsters (which he has enslaved) as his minions. It is unknown what happened to most of Ludo's previous army after the events of "[[Storm the Castle]]". Some of those shown to have survived, such as [[Buff Frog]] and Boo Fly, have pursued other work.
