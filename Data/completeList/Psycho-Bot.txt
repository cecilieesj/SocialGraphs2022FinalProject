[[File:Tumblr_mukxlonvVM1rzigc1o1_500.png|thumb|250px]] '''Psycho-Bot''' is a giant robotic scorpion-like creature invented by [[Willem Viceroy]]. Its first appearance is in "[[The Ninja Identity]]" and his destruction is shown in "[[The Ninja Supremacy]]". Psycho-Bot is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].

==Abilities==
Unlike Viceroy's other inventions, Psycho-Bot is able to analyze and learn from its surroundings. Not only can it learn how to counter attacks, it is also able to learn human emotions and feelings. This makes it one of the most sophisticated and advanced pieces of technology Viceroy has invented thus far. It is also able to repair itself after it got major damage from [[Randy Cunningham|Randy]].

Due to its ability to learn emotions, it becomes vulnerable to the [[The Sorcerer|Sorcerer's]] [[Stank (magic)|Stank]] because [[Howard Weinerman|Howard]] humiliates it when he has to fill in as the Ninja. After getting stanked, it traded its solid metal body for one made of an unknown liquid metal, making it pretty much invulnerable to all forms of attack. It is finally taken down when Randy destroys its emotion chip, which destanks it, and finally short circuits it in the waters of the Van Dam.

Sometime afterwards, the Psycho-Bot was imprisoned in [[Scrap City]].

==Trivia==
*Psycho-Bot is the first robot to be stanked in the show.
*Psycho-Bot is the first robot defeated (but not destroyed) by a ninja that wasn't Randy.
*Psycho-Bot appears in the [[Disney XD Villains Unite!]] as the boss of the McFist levels.
