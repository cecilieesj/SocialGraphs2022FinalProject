'''Jordan''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2015]] animated feature film, ''[[Inside Out]]'' and a major character in the short film, ''[[Riley's First Date?]]''

==Appearances==
===''[[Inside Out]]''===
Jordan only appears at the end of the film when he bumps into Riley, who is about to enter the ice ring. He drops his water bottle and Riley picks it up for him. Inside his mind, his own emotions freak out with a large klaxon alarm shouting "GIRL!", possibly hinting at what is to come for Riley's own emotions in the coming years. He is also mentioned by Riley's teacher during the credits where he is heard struggling to answer her question.

===''[[Riley's First Date?]]''===
Jordan returns in the short where he takes Riley skating. While waiting for Riley, [[Mr. Andersen|Riley's father]] develops animosity towards Jordan, believing that the two are going on a date. Riley's father tries intimidating the boy with a stern, silent glare, but Jordan remained oblivious to it. When questioned on his interests, Jordan gives a vague answer, which Riley's father interprets as back talk and prepares to throw the boy out. However, the two end up bonding over their experiences in a band and love for music, dancing to "Back in Black" by AC/DC. At the end of the short, the misunderstanding is cleared and Jordan leaves with Riley on good terms with her father.

==Emotions==
We see inside Jordan's mind twice, in both ''[[Inside Out]]'' and the short [[Riley's First Date?|''Riley's First Date?'']]
*[[The Emotions|Joy]] ([[Bill Hader]])
*[[The Emotions|Sadness]] (David Ray Keyes)
*[[The Emotions|Fear]] (Flea)
*[[The Emotions|Disgust]] (Tom Wallace)
*[[The Emotions|Anger]] (Randy King)
Jordan's Console is still the one-man console, similar to Riley's Console through most of the movie, and his memory orbs are still monochromatic. They are also scattered all over the place, implying he is 'scatterbrained', and his mind is full of distractions like music, posters, and a skateboard ramp. Fear takes the lead at the Console - despite the Girl Alert - implying a cautious personality, and his Disgust is a girl, implying he may have a sensitive side.

==Trivia==
*Jordan's memory orbs are monochromatic (each has only one color) in both ''[[Inside Out]]'' and ''[[Riley's First Date?]]. ''His console is still the one-man console.
*[[Bill Hader]], the voice of Jordan's Joy, is also the voice of Riley's [[Fear]].
