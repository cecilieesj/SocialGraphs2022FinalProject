As inferred by their name, besides [[Chip Potts|Chip]], [[Mrs. Potts]] had at least six other children (according to Marvel Comics, including Chip, she had 12 children overall). Like their brother, the children were transformed into a teacup set by the [[Enchantress]].

Their father is not identified in the film, however he [[Jean Potts|does appear]] in the [[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|2017 version]].

They were first alluded to when Mrs. Potts was putting Chip into the cupboard for the night, despite his protests, shortly before Belle entered the kitchen after leaving [[Belle's Room|her room]] during the first night at the [[Beast's Castle|castle]]. Despite this, however, they were later awake and helping prepare Belle's meal ("[[Be Our Guest]]"). They aren't seen again until the climax of the film, where they aided Mrs. Potts in driving out the invading villagers by pouring hot tea onto a bald, mustachioed baker. They aren't seen again for the rest of the film, although they are implied to have regained their human form.

===Disney Princess: Princesses and Puppies===
It is revealed that Mrs. Potts has a daughter.

== Disney Princess Magazine ==
Mrs Potts’s daughter has a major role in the Beauty and the Beast story of one Disney Princess magazine, where she blows the biggest bubble, much to her brother’s dismay.
