{{Quote|As I live and breathe...a fairy!|[[Jiminy Cricket]] upon witnessing the Blue Fairy for the first time|Pinocchio (film)}}
The '''Blue Fairy''' is a major character in the [[1940]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''. She is a magical being who, fulfilling [[Geppetto]]'s wish, transforms [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] into a living being. With the power to take multiple forms (including a wishing star and a white dove), the Blue Fairy aids Pinocchio and [[Jiminy Cricket]] throughout their adventures to fulfill the puppet's goal of becoming a real boy.

==Background==
===Development===
====Design====
In a story meeting on [[January 12]], [[1939]], [[Walt Disney]] specified that the Blue Fairy was to 'give the appearance of loveliness... (but not look like) a glamour girl'. Early model sheets and inspirational sketches reflect this concept, depicting the character as an ethereal beauty with swirling, billowing clothes and loose, unkempt hair (to reflect the fact that the fairy has literally flown in). At some point in development, this design changed to a less ethereal figure, with human proportions. This final version of the character, with her blue glittery dress, solid hair, and more human proportions, suggests the inspiration of {{WikipediaLink|Jean Harlow}} and thus ultimately resembled the 'glamour girl' Disney had initially been anxious to avoid; however, Disney seemed pleased with this version of the character, whose newly-found sexual allure worked on both [[Jiminy Cricket]] and the men working on the film, who reportedly whistled on first seeing a color test of the Blue Fairy.

====Animation====
Jack Campbell's animation of the Blue Fairy closely followed live-action footage of Marge Champion (who was also the performance model for [[Snow White]]) under the direction of Hamilton Luske. Oskar Fischinger, a famous abstract filmmaker from Germany who had been hired by Disney primarily to help with ''[[Fantasia]]''<nowiki/>'s abstract Toccata and Fugue in D Minor segment, was responsible for the animation of the Blue Fairy's magic, including the effects surrounding her when she first enters the workshop and the beams of light emanating from her wand.

===Personality===
The Blue Fairy is angelic, kind, sweet, thoughtful, understanding, loving, magical, wise, motherly, imaginative, gracious, moral, smart, benevolent, and gentle.

===Physical appearance===
The Blue Fairy is beautiful slender and full-figured woman with fair skin, rosy cheeks, red lips, medium-length wavy blonde hair, light blue eyes adorned with purple eyeshadow, and two white wings on her back. She wears a blue glittery dress with long translucent sleeves that have fabric hanging below, a long blue ribbon tied around the waist with a heart tied like a buckle, and a blue oval pendant placed in the cleavage. She also has a blue headband and shoes, and carries a gold wand with a yellow star at the top end of it.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''===
[[File:Pinocchio-disneyscreencaps.com-1837.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Blue Fairy having brought Pinocchio to life.]]
The wishing star is first referred to in the film's [[When You Wish Upon a Star|opening song]] (with the Blue Fairy herself perhaps referred to in the song as ''"Fate herself"''). When Jiminy Cricket begins his story, the wishing star is looking over [[Village (Pinocchio)|Pinocchio's village]], and it and the other stars are 'shining like diamonds'. It is not mentioned again in the film until inside [[Geppetto's Workshop]]. After [[Figaro]] has opened the window, Geppetto notices the Wishing Star and wishes that the marionette Pinocchio becomes a real boy. Everyone in the workshop falls asleep; soon, however, Jiminy is woken by an ethereal glow caused by the star as it moves closer and closer to the window. Eventually, the Blue Fairy herself appears in the workshop, stating that Geppetto deserves his wish after the happiness he has brought to others. She walks to Pinocchio and, tapping the puppet with her wand, grants him life, but his body is still made of wood. She tells him that he must learn the difference between right and wrong in order to become a real boy. When Pinocchio appears not to understand, Jiminy interrupts to explain, and the Blue Fairy offers him the position of conscience to Pinocchio. Somewhat dumbstruck by her beauty, he agrees and is granted a new suit befitting his status. The Blue Fairy then leaves, reminding Pinocchio to "be a good boy, and always let your conscience be your guide."

The Blue Fairy next appears after [[Stromboli]] has locked Pinocchio in a cage; the showman intends to use the wooden boy to make an enormous amount of money. Ashamed of doing the wrong thing, Pinocchio attempts to hide when he sees the wishing star approaching the [[Stromboli's Caravan|caravan]], though both he and Jiminy are spotted. The Blue Fairy asks Pinocchio why he did not attend school that day; lying, he concocts a ridiculous story that he was kidnapped by two monsters, who put him into a sack and threatened to chop him into firewood. As his lie grows, his nose becomes longer until it resembles a tree limb, complete with a bird's nest. The Blue Fairy informs him that "a lie keeps growing and growing until it's as plain as the nose on your face". When Pinocchio promises to tell the truth from then on, the Blue Fairy returns his nose to normal and frees him from the cage with a tap of her wand.

She does not appear in person for the rest of the film - in keeping with her 'warning' as she frees Pinocchio from the cage that this is the last time she can help him - although she offers some indirect assistance. When Pinocchio is on [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]], while [[The Stupid Little Boys|other boys]] were being turned into donkeys and then sold to salt mines by [[the Coachman]], Jiminy warns Pinocchio to follow his lead to prevent the curse from taking a foothold, with his role as the Fairy's proxy allowing Pinocchio to escape his own transformation.

After the two return home and see Geppetto's abandoned workshop, the Blue Fairy, in the form of a dove, drops a message that Geppetto learned about Pleasure Island and set sail in order to rescue Pinocchio, but his boat was swallowed by [[Monstro|Monstro the Whale]]. Presumably, this "bonus help" was due to the fact that Pinocchio had gotten back on track by listening to Jiminy (as well as ceasing his bad-boy behavior unlike [[Lampwick]]) and that Jiminy would not have realized that Geppetto had been attacked by Monstro as they were making their way back to the village. Pinocchio's dangerous decision to try and rescue Geppetto (even over Jiminy's objections) was the final test in order to see whether he had what it takes to become a real boy.

Pinocchio's selflessness in rescuing Geppetto from Monstro costs him his life, as he drowns from the violent wave that washed him and Geppetto on shore. As Geppetto, Jiminy, Figaro, and Cleo mourn Pinocchio's death, the Blue Fairy appears, saying that Pinocchio has proven his heroism and rewards him by returning him to life, reversing the Coachman's donkey curse, and ultimately changing him into a real human boy. She also gives Jiminy a golden badge, declaring him Pinocchio's official conscience.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:The blue fairy HOM.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Blue Fairy in ''House of Mouse''.]]
In the animated series ''House of Mouse'', the Blue Fairy makes occasional appearances.

Her most notable appearance in the series is in the episode "[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]", where [[Pain and Panic]] try to lead Pinocchio down the path of evil. When Jiminy becomes convinced that he is no good at being Pinocchio's conscience, [[Mickey Mouse]] wishes to help, resulting in the Blue Fairy reassigning Jiminy to be Mickey's conscience. In the end, when Jiminy and Pinocchio are reunited, Pain and Panic mock the moment until the Blue Fairy reappears and turns them into ashes.

===Other appearances===
The Blue Fairy makes a few cameos in the ''[[Teacher's Pet]]'' [[Teacher's Pet: The Movie|movie]] in [[Spot Helperman/Scott Leadready II|Spot Helperman]]'s dreams. Due to the show's art style, the Blue Fairy looks noticeably different than her past appearances.

In ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', a banner featuring the Blue Fairy can be briefly seen in [[Oh My Disney]] as [[Iron Man]] flies passed [[Vanellope von Schweetz]].

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Geppetto (film)|Geppetto]]''===
[[File:2000-geppetto-3.jpg|thumb|250px|Julia Louis-Dreyfus in ''Geppetto''.]]
She was portrayed by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] in the 2000 TV film ''Geppetto''.

During the film, Geppetto tries to have the Blue Fairy take back his wish, since Pinocchio is not a perfectly well-behaved child. She refuses to, telling him that her magic is not a fix-all solution. After some prodding, she finally sends Geppetto off to fetch Pinocchio, still refusing to undo the wish. During the quest, [[Stromboli]] makes a deal with Pinocchio, signing him to a contract to grant ownership of Pinocchio to Stromboli for life. When Geppetto learns of Stromboli's deal, he begs that the Blue Fairy undo the contract, which she regretfully tells him is impossible. Geppetto makes one final wish that she turn him into stone or clay, for life without Pinocchio would be a sorrowful life. This act gives the Blue Fairy incentive to turn Pinocchio into a real boy, stating that Pinocchio couldn't be a real boy without having a real father.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 1x01 - Pilot - Blue Fairy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Blue Fairy in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
In the [[ABC]] original series, The Blue Fairy plays a supporting role only seen in the [[Enchanted Forest]] and is portrayed by [[Keegan Connor Tracy]]. Her [[Storybrooke]] counterpart is Mother Superior. She first appears in "[[Pilot (Once Upon a Time)|Pilot]]". She creates an enchanted quill which helps [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and [[Prince Charming|Prince Thomas]] imprison [[Rumplestiltskin]]. She also transforms Jiminy Cricket into a real cricket, guiding him to help Geppetto after his parents were turned into puppets. In "[[Dreamy]]", she instructs a novice fairy, Nova, on how to distribute fairy dust. Later on in that episode, she and the dwarf Bossy convince Nova to end her relationship with Dreamy (later, as a result of the breakup, [[Grumpy]]) in order for Nova to become a fairy godmother. In "[[The Return (Once Upon a Time)|The Return]]", it is revealed that Rumplestiltskin's son, [[Neal Cassidy|Baelfire]], asked for her help in defeating Rumplestiltskin's curse. She gives him a magic bean to send him and his father to a world without magic. Rumplestiltskin, however, does not want to let go of his magic and refuses to leave with him.

He later confronts the Blue Fairy, who says that Baelfire had taken the last bean and that there is now no way to cross between the worlds - starting Rumplestiltskin's quest for the Dark Curse, which he spent the next several centuries searching for. She presents the idea of putting Snow White (and, unbeknownst to Snow, Pinocchio) into a wardrobe that can protect those in it from the Dark Curse.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x01 - Broken - Mother Superior.jpg|thumb|250px|The Blue Fairy's counterpart, Mother Superior.]]
In [[Storybrooke]], she is '''Mother Superior''', the head of Storybrooke's convent. She appears in the "Dreamy" episode and appears unaware of her magical identity. She is also seen in a Land Without Magic in Henry's hospital room. After [[Emma Swan]] breaks the Dark Curse, Mother Superior and the other fairies (who had been nuns in the convent) acknowledge her previous existence as the Blue Fairy. When Henry requests that she do some magic, she responds by stating that although she can feel the magic released into the town by Mr. Gold, she cannot use it because magic works differently in Storybrooke. [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]]'s [[Peter Pan's Shadow|shadow]] later tries to kill her, which appears to work until the shadow is destroyed and she comes back to life. She and the other fairies are trapped in the [[Sorcerer Hat|Sorcerer's hat]] by [[Captain Hook]] under Rumplestiltskin's orders for six weeks, after which Regina Mills frees them. She then tends to Pinocchio (now a grown man named August), who is suffering the effects of having transformative spells used on him too many times.

===[[Pinocchio (2022 film)|''Pinocchio'' (2022)]]===
The Blue Fairy appears in the live-action remake of the original movie. Here, she is portrayed by [[Cynthia Erivo]].

The Blue Fairy first appears after her magic from the wishing star causes Pinocchio to come to life. She sees Pinocchio tangled up in his strings and makes them magically disappear, untangling the puppet. She then meets Jiminy Cricket and explains why she's here as Geppetto made a wish on the star before she fixes Pinocchio's voice box due to him copying every word she says. Realizing that Pinocchio is a puppet, the Blue Fairy is confused on why Geppetto carved a puppet if he wanted a son until Jiminy theorizes Geppetto is extremely lonely. The Blue Fairy explains to Pinocchio that he is only a living puppet and must prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish in order to become a real boy. She then appoints Jiminy as Pinocchio's temporary conscience until the boy learns to develop his own conscience. After that, the Blue Fairy tells Pinocchio that being real is not just what he is made out of, but who he is on the inside.

As she departs from Geppetto's workshop, the Blue Fairy sings "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" before she disappears. The Blue Fairy is not seen again for the rest of the film, but her advice to Pinocchio helps him in becoming a real boy after rescuing his father from Monstro.

==Printed media==
===''[[Mistress of All Evil: A Tale of the Dark Fairy]]''===
She appears in the novel as a student of the Fairylands Academy when Maleficent was a teenager. She is one of the students along with Maleficent, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather that are taking their final exams to see if they are capable of wish-granting by helping someone. She is the only fairy at the academy who is kind to Maleficent, unlike the other fairies.

==Video games==
===''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]''===
[[File:Disney's Villains' Revenge Blue Fairy.jpg|thumb|250px|The Blue Fairy in ''Disney Villains' Revenge''.]]
The Blue Fairy's role is minor in the game. After Jiminy removes the happy ending pages so he can tell the unseen and unheard player how each story ends, resulting in the four villains of the stories almost getting their hands on the pages, the Blue Fairy appears. She tells Jiminy and the player that when the happy endings were removed, the villains have started to change the stories so that they end in their favor. She tells them they must go into the stories and fix them, allowing the player to enter after she enchants the book.

When the player does something wrong or loses in a certain way in a story's game, they are returned to the room where the Blue Fairy offers them tips or tells them to do the right thing. Once they have completed the four stories, defeated the villains for a second time when they successfully steal the happy ending pages, and recover the pages, The Blue Fairy shows a fifth story was added to the storybook of their adventures and enchants a few toys in the room as mini-games. She also says the player can return to the book and replay the stories as many times as they wish before vanishing completely.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''===
[[File:Blue Fairy KH3D.png|left|130px]]
The Blue Fairy makes an appearance in her homeworld [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Prankster's Paradise|Prankster's Paradise]], where she arrives at the scene and gently scolds Pinocchio for lying to Jiminy. Pleading for the Blue Fairy to help his nose return to normal, Pinocchio promises to never lie again. The Blue Fairy forgives him, but before returning his nose to normal and releasing him from the cage, she warns he will remain a puppet forever if he keeps lying. She later appears before [[Sora]] to tell him that Geppetto had been swallowed by Monstro and that Pinocchio and Jiminy ran off to find the whale to save him.

She is voiced by [[Rosalyn Landor]] in English and Miyuki Ichijo in Japanese.

===''[[Disney Sorcerer's Arena]]''===
The Blue Fairy's magic is a spell in the game that cleanses the player's team of any harmful effects afflicted on them.

==[[Disney On Ice]]==
[[File:DOIBlueFairy.jpg|thumb|The Blue Fairy during Disney On Ice show in 2016.]]
The Blue Fairy originally appeared in Walt Disney's World On Ice: Happy Birthday Donald from 1984 to 1991. She later appeared in [[Walt Disney's World On Ice: Pinocchio]] from 1987 to 1992, [[Disney on Ice: Let's Celebrate (100 Years of Magic)|Disney On Ice: 100 Years of Magic]] from September 3, 1999, to Summer 2017, and [[Disney on Ice: Mickey and Friends|Disney On Ice: Let's Celebrate]] from September 4, 2009, to May 2016.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Blue Fairy from Magic Happens.jpg|250px|thumb|The Blue Fairy at Disneyland.]]
The Blue Fairy appears occasionally in Disney Parks around the world. She is most commonly found in [[Disneyland]].

For many years, the Blue Fairy's most prominent role in the Disney Parks was not as a meet-and-greet character, but as the leading float in the popular [[Main Street Electrical Parade]]. She appeared in all versions of the parade until 2009, when she was retired from the American version (which at that time was running at [[Disney California Adventure]]) and replaced by a [[Tinker Bell]] float. However, she continues to appear in [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s variant of the parade, the Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights. In 2022, she returned to the American version of the parade as the leader of the new [[It's a Small World]] finale unit, created to celebrate the parade's 50th anniversary at [[Disneyland]].

===[[Disneyland]]===
She appears in the ending scene in all versions of [[Pinocchio's Daring Journey]].

She would also make an appearance during the former firework spectacular [[Magical: Disney's New Nighttime Spectacular of Magical Celebrations]] granting Geppetto's wish.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
She has her own spell card known as "The Blue Fairy's Wand Wish" in the attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]].

In the nighttime spectacular [[Wishes: A Magical Gathering of Disney Dreams]], the Blue Fairy hosted along with Jiminy Cricket. In contrast to Jiminy, she only makes a few speaking appearances.

===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===
In Jubilation!, the Blue Fairy could be seen in an extremely tall standard in the parade. She rides in a carriage driven by [[Pegasus]]. She also made a quick appearance in the opening montage of [[Once Upon a Time (Tokyo Disneyland)|Once Upon a Time]] bringing Pinocchio to life with her wand.

==Trivia==
*The Blue Fairy is the opposite in the appearance of the Fairy in Carlo Collodi's original story. In the story, the Fairy has turquoise hair, giving her the name, but wears normal clothing; she lives at first in a cottage in the woods and later in a house on Busy Bee Island, and has no connection to a wishing star. Additionally, she is mostly depicted as youthful and childlike and Pinocchio considered her to be his mother.
*In the original story, the Blue Fairy has no role in Pinocchio coming to life: his own wood was already magical and capable of speaking and moving. She still retains her role of giving him a human body.
*The Blue Fairy is the only major female character in the movie other than [[Cleo]], but the latter has no speaking parts.
*The Blue Fairy appears as a statue at the end of the film ''{{WikipediaLink|A.I. Artificial Intelligence}}''.
*Although not part of the [[Disney Princess]] franchise, she was present in an early image of the franchise, along with the Disney Princesses.
*Most of her facial expressions are very similar to [[Snow White]]'s, no doubt because she shared the same live model for the animators, Marge Champion. Some of her facial expressions were also used as an inspiration for [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]].
*Unlike all the other characters in the film, the Blue Fairy was animated via rotoscoping rather than by freehand.
