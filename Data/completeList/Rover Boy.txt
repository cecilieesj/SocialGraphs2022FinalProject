'''Rover Boy''' is a riding horse at a dude ranch that [[Donald Duck]] visits in the [[1951]] animated short ''[[Dude Duck]]''. He is voiced by [[Clarence Nash]].

==Personality==
He dreams of being ridden by one of the bevy of beautiful girls that arrive at the ranch, but balks when he finds that his mount is Donald.

==Appearances==
===''[[Dude Duck]]''===
[[Donald Duck]] tries to ride Rover Boy, who is very upset to be ridden by a common city duck instead of a beautiful girl, and decides to trick him. 

==Trivia==
*He looks like two other Disney horses, [[Cyril Proudbottom]] and [[Widowmaker]]. He has also some graphical similarities to Jolly Jumper, Lucky Luke's talking horse in the eponymous french comic serie, but this is probably fortuitous.
