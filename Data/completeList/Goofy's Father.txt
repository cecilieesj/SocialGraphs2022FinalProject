'''Goofy's Father''' is the father of [[Goofy]]. He strongly resembles Goofy's original design from ''[[Mickey's Revue]]''.

== Appearances ==
In the ''[[Island in the Sky (Mickey Mouse)|Island in the Sky]]'', Goofy briefly mentions his parents when he waves goodbye to his loved ones. Both characters, however, remained unseen. Goofy mentioned his father again in the [[Goofy]] comic ''Goofy's Last Stand ''([[1958]]), where he says "Looky here! Muh pappy was a railroad man!" while showing his family album to his nephew [[Gilbert Goof|Gilbert]].<ref>http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++899-05</ref>
=== ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland ]]'' ===

In the episode ''[[The Adventure Story]]'', which first aired on March 20, 1957, Goofy tells his son [[Max Goof#Goofy Junior|Junior]] about their ancestors and relatives. The Goofy cartoons ''[[Tiger Trouble]]'' and ''[[African Diary]]'' were featured in this episode, and it was said that the goofy from these cartoons were in fact named '''Amos Goofy''', and that he was Junior's grandfather and Goofy's father. In later printings of the comic adaptation of this episode, Amos was renamed '''Hunter Goofy'''.

===''[[Goof Troop]]''===
During the earlier production stages of the series, Goofy’s father (simply referred to as “Grandpa”) was intended to be a regular character. He was described as a friend and confidant to his grandson Max, providing him with his advice and philosophies and getting himself into various shenanigans, such as wandering off at a rock concert he is attending with Max and P.J.<ref>[[:File:The last paragraph speaks about Max's mother, and gives an insight of a potentially pitched way of how she died..png|File:The last paragraph speaks about Max's mother, and gives an insight of a potentially pitched way of how she died..png]]</ref> However, at some point during production, the character of Grandpa was scrapped entirely, and he never appeared in the final product.

Nevertheless, Goofy's father is first mentioned by [[Pete]] in the episode "[[The Good, the Bad and the Goofy]]". When Pete is having a bad day because of Goofy's typical antics, he says to the Goof, "Let's get one thing straight: I am onto you. I don't know when, and I don't know why, but somehow, one of the ''nuts'' in your family tree got the evil eye put on 'em, see? And that curse has been oozin' down through the bloodline ever since. Your father had it, you have it, and I don't want it! Got that?"

In the episode "[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]", Max's grandpa (presumably Goofy's father) is also mentioned when Max tries to use the argument of "Grandpa never went to the dentist," to get out of going to his own dentist appointment, to which Goofy responds "Grandpa doesn't have any teeth, Maxie."

===''[[A Goofy Movie]]''===
[[File:Tumblr inline mrvwk0pbXh1qz4rgp.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|The map Goofy and his father used.]]
Goofy's father is mentioned several times over the course of ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''. When Goofy decides to take Max on a fishing trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho, he tells Max they will use the same map he and his own dad used when they went on the same fishing trip back when Goofy was Max's age. When Goofy unfolds the map, the map is shown to have previously belonged first to a "Walter P. Goofey", then to a "Benjamin Goofey", and finally to "all Goofeys", with "'''Benjamin Goofey'''" being a possibility for the name of Goofy's father (or at least one of Goofy's relatives). Later in the movie, Goofy tells Max that his (Max's) granddad had taught Goofy how to open up a soup can with his teeth back when Goofy and his dad had taken a trip to Yosemite together.

===''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''===
When Max prepares to leave for college in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie|An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', Goofy gives him his father's old adding machine as a gift.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
In the ''House of Mouse'' episode "[[Goofy's Menu Magic]]", when [[Gus Goose]] ends up eating all of the food for the evening's events, Goofy takes over Gus's duties as a chef and prepares to cook more food. When he states that he's working on some popcorn, he is then heard asking: "How's the corn comin', Pop?" Goofy's own father is then shown to be working in the club's kitchen, peeling an ear of corn for his son, to whose inquiry about said corn the man replies with a confused "Heh?!"

Ten seconds later, Goofy somehow causes an explosion in the kitchen, to which his father once again (but this time offscreen) responds with a confused "Heh?!"
