'''Elves''' are creatures from the [[2020]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Onward]]''.

==Background==
Elves back in the old days used magic to help across the world. Because magic wasn't easy to master, elves continued doing a simpler technology such as using modern appliances and adapting to newer technology for an easier way to get through, alongside other mythical creatures. In the film, elves are frequently featured throughout the film as background characters adapting to modern life. 

==Role in the film==
Elves once lived in a world when magic once existed throughout the land of mythical creatures. Ever since magic existed across the land, they enjoyed using magic until modern technology arrives. With modern technology rising slowly, elves adapted to a new life in this format such as working as employees, living in modern day houses, etc.

The key elves featured in the film are [[Ian Lightfoot]] and his brother [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]] who are one of the main characters featured in the film who plan to know about who their father once was before his death, followed by their mother [[Laurel Lightfoot]]. Ever since Ian and Barley brought magic back to the land of mythical creatures, elves started adapting to a new life with magic brought back to the land of mythical creatures.
