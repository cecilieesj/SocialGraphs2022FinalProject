'''Amanda Johnson''' is [[Candace Flynn]]'s future daughter in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode "[[Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo]]". She is the older sister of [[Xavier and Fred Johnson|Xavier and Fred]].

==Background==
===Personality===
She appears to act like her mother, but reversed, she always tells Xavier and Fred to do something cool during their summer vacation rather than just sit under the front of the family's digital tree. She always responds, "I knew it! You guys never do anything!"

She also enjoys the same extracurricular activities as her mother: mainly, complaining about her brothers - except Amanda is annoyed by the fact that Xavier and Fred spend their days ''not'' doing anything.

===Physical appearance===
Amanda looks almost exactly like her mother when she was Amanda's age, except for different clothes and hairstyle (although her skirt is pretty much the same as her mom's when she was a teenager).

==Trivia==
*"Amanda" and "Xavier" are the two names that Candace had picked out for her future children in the episodes "[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]", "[[Swiss Family Phineas]]", and "[[Spa Day]]". Given her interest in [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]], it's probable that he is the father of both children. It is possible that Jeremy might be her father because her brother, Xavier, has the same blond hair and light blue eyes as Jeremy. On that note, Amanda's face shape is more similar to Jeremy's rather than her mother's. This was eventually confirmed by [[Dan Povenmire]] at the [[2015]] San Diego Comic-Con.
*[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]] finds out that she is going to be Amanda's aunt, which for obvious reasons means she is going to marry either [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] or [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]].
