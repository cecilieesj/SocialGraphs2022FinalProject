'''Commander Fox''' (birth number CC-1010; nicknamed "Fox") was a clone trooper officer and clone commander of the Coruscant Guard during the Clone Wars. He is perhaps best known for being responsible for [[Fives]]' death, which prevented the other clones from knowing Order 66 ahead of time before the order was initiated and it was too late. He was also responsible for ordering the command to kill [[Ahsoka Tano]] after she had accidentally force choked her prison mate, and Fox was attempting to prevent Anakin from seeing her after he was commanded that nobody could talk or see her from the [[Palpatine|chancellor]].

He was eventually killed after the events of Order 66 when he and his troops were tasked with a mission to kill a Jedi, however his troops instead targeted [[Darth Vader]] as they mistook him as the Jedi librarian known as Jocasta Nu. Vader became upset, and with his anger getting to the best of him, acted in rage by choking Fox to death from the power of the force.
