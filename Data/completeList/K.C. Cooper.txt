Cooper''' is a 17-year-old girl and the titular protagonist of the live-action television program, ''[[K.C. Undercover]]''. She is an outspoken, confident technology wiz and skilled black belt. She discovers that both her parents are spies with aspirations that she will follow in their footsteps.
==Background==
K.C. is an intelligent, extremely mature, and multi-talented teenager whose skills range from computer programming to being a black belt in the martial arts.

===Personality===
K.C. is a tomboy and prefers to study over partying. As she seemingly despises wearing dresses, only when it comes to going to a special occasion with her family. She can be seen as quite social, and gets nervous around boys she finds attractive. Normally, she's friendly and accommodating, however, when annoyed or frustrated, she can get a bit sassy and sarcastic. She can even be egotistical, believing she knows what's best for people and on romance like when she learned that her parents weren't officially married and almost ruined their relationship, along with Marisa's and Ernie's relationships. This side is shown again when she has difficulty working with a partner, believing she can do the job, even though it is out of her level. She keeps Marisa in check, and K.C. is very intelligent and gets very suspicious if even just the slightest thing is off. Despite being suspicious of anyone, she usually has been misled through someone else's deception, as proven when her cousin Abby first came to Cooper's house, she fully convinced K.C. as being part of the family, despite Kira's objections of ever seeing or meeting Abby, prior to her background being confirmed. Then wanting her to meet her mother and aunt, Erica. And later finally realizing Abby's true intentions of working for The Other Side. If someone tries to attack her, she'll probably attack first. And falling for Brett as she had no clue of his true intentions. She also has a tendency to be mocking towards those she deems inferior to her, namely her temporary partner Dexter (because he's a dog) and her brother Ernie for all his oddities. Although she is more respectful once they prove themselves. K.C. can be clever and can keep up a cover for as long as she wants, managing to fool Ernie one time with this ability.
===Physical appearance===
K.C. is very tall (5'10), slim and has a very tomboyish style. K. C. wears her hair loose all the time. Her hair is curled and brown with curled back strands colored blonde-caramel highlights. In season 1, K. C. wears Scottish flannels of black and red colors. She wears a light grey jacket with black and white stripes at the bottom. She always wears a jacket around her waist, ripped jeans and black sports sneakers with a white high heel like under it. In season 2, her style changes and becomes more girly. Her hair becomes darker with no highlights anymore; they get straighter and K. C. also wears dresses now and more girly colors, such as baby blue, white, but also still boy colors, such as green, dark green and brown.
