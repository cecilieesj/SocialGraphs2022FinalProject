It is capable of getting into any machine, fix any glitch and straighten up any mess. However, when it malfunctions, or is poorly coded, it displays a mischievous side and can deliberately make problems go from bad to worse. It works best with specific coding as opposed to general codes, as shown in it successfully giving Loretta a complex style, but struggling with several simple styles for Miles. The I.O.T.A., despite its fickleness, is a durable robot, capable of functioning in water.

The I.O.T.A.'s main body is a small sphere with one camera eye and has five holo legs that operate as propellers, allowing it to fly and hover. Its legs and body are held together by a small cone-like projection.
