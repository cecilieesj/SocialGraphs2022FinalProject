The '''Bensons''' are the secondary antagonists-turned-supporting characters of the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', acting as loyal servants to [[Gabby Gabby]] who serve her in her goal to retrieve [[Woody]]'s voice box to replace her broken one.

==Background==
===Development===
{{Quote|The dummies are, by far, some of the creepiest characters we've ever created. Our animators really leaned into the truth in materials for how our ventriloquist dummies move. Dummies' bodies are soft with no structure, so our dummies' arms just dangle and their legs bend backwards. Throw in their fixed expressions with their wide eyes and big hinged jaws and they're nightmare material—in the best way possible.|Producer Mark Nielsen on the Bensons' creation}}

==Role in the film==
The Bensons are a group of ventriloquist dummies who live at the [[Second Chance Antiques]], led by a dummy who wears a red bow tie and work as loyal servants for the talking doll Gabby Gabby, obeying her every command without question.

The red-tied dummy is first seen taking Gabby in her stroller while Woody and [[Forky]] were looking for [[Bo Peep]] in the store. Then, Woody meets Gabby and Benson and when the doll sees that Woody has a voice box, they coerce Woody and Forky into joining them. Sensing an ulterior motive from Gabby Gabby, Woody flees the shop. Gabby Gabby then sends her dummies to chase them and they manage to capture Forky. The Bensons are then later seen patrolling the shelf, turning their heads around as they guard Gabby Gabby and their captive Forky from intruders.

While Woody with the help of Bo, [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Giggle McDimples]], [[Ducky and Bunny]], [[Duke Caboom]], and [[Billy, Goat, and Gruff]] are trying to recover Forky, the dummies surprise them and Woody nearly got his voice box stolen. The group fails their mission and after an argument with his friends, with Bo being indirectly insulted by Woody's remarks, Woody decides to return to find Forky alone. He then confronts Gabby Gabby and she convinces him to give her his voice box in exchange for Forky, Woody having been moved by Gabby's backstory. Gabby, happy to have a new voice box, keeps his word and makes Forky go to Woody. Forky then greets Gabby Gabby and Benson and points out that he scares him. However, when Harmony, the girl Gabby dreamed of playing so much, did not like her, the doll loses hope and tells Woody (who came back to comfort her) that it was over for her. With Bo, Woody manages to convince her to be with [[Bonnie]]. Everyone then leaves the antique shop and the first Benson gives the stroller a boost before entering it. However, the stroller stumbles against a fairground barrier and falls to the ground. A lady then runs to straighten the stroller and sees Benson which makes her scream in terror. The Bensons then are not seen again and it is unknown if the Benson in the stroller was brought back to the antique store.

==Trivia==
*It's possible that the reason for which the Bensons can't talk is because they are ventriloquist dummies and thus can only talk if a ventriloquist uses them to speak "'through" them, aside that there are other toys in the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' universe which can't talk, despite not being ventriloquist dummies.
**Though they are not able to talk, they are able to make some grunting sounds.
*The idea of a ventriloquist dummy character was inspired by the original concept of [[Woody]], who was originally designed to be a dummy before being changed to a pull-string cowboy doll by the suggestion of [[Bud Luckey]].
*They resemble Slappy the Dummy from the ''{{WikipediaLink|Goosebumps}}'' franchise, specifically the movie version of the character.
*The Bensons walk irregularly due to dummies requiring a human hand to keep them upright.
*For unknown reasons, the red-tied dummy skin in the official ''Toy Story'' content pack for ''{{WikipediaLink|Minecraft}}'' is referred to as "Fredric".
*When one of the Bensons is sitting atop of Gabby's cabinet, his head spins fully around, similarly to how Woody turned his around in the [[Toy Story|first movie]].
*Their faces are modeled off of official [[Paul Winchell]] "Jerry Mahoney" dolls that were released in the 1950s, more specifically the 32 Inch figure in that product line. This isn't really a surprise considering many Toy Story characters are already based on pre-existing toys.
