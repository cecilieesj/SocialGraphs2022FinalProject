'''Miss Hatchet''' is a character from the television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''. She is the librarian of [[Middleton High School|Middleton High]]. She is voiced by [[April Winchell]].

==History==
Feared by many students (as evidenced by the instant cowering when she's near outside the library), Miss Hatchet is infamous amongst the students for her strict actions in regards to her library's books. This was evidenced with [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]], when her friend [[Ron Stoppable]] lost one of her books unknowingly during a mission. Miss Hatchet then put Kim through the proverbial grinder as punishment until Ron returned the book.

She was last seen accidentally opening what she thought was Kim's missing library book... in reality, it was an ancient text that Ron had stolen from [[Monkey Fist]]. Ron still had Kim's missing book. What happened to Miss Hatchet afterwards is unknown.

==Trivia==
*She is one of the few staff members that can be seen at Middleton High.
