The '''Siren''', also known as the '''Lady of the Lake''', is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. She debuts with her first appearance in the thirteenth episode of the first season "[[What Happened to Frederick]]". She is portrayed by [[Aria Pullman]].

The Siren is based on the creature of the same name from Greek mythology, and also on the Lady of the Lake of King Arthur's legend.
==Background==
After [[The Prince|Charming]] agrees to help restore the life of her former lover [[Frederick]], [[Abigail]] takes Charming to a lake and shows him a shrine where others have left offerings to appease the creature within a lake which has healing properties.

He commands the beast to show itself and is answered by a beautiful siren. Even though Charming knows the deceptive nature of the siren, she transforms into the image of Snow White and attempts to seduce him. She slowly starts to kiss him, but he notes that this isn't real love and it takes all his will to refuse the temptress. The Siren congratulates him on being the first to be able to resist her temptation and she tries to drown him by force. She leads him underwater and signs him to follow her, but Charming swims away. The Siren uses her magic to tie a sea plant around his leg and drag him underneath and swims towards him. The Siren kisses Charming underwater, but he manages to find a dagger on the sea bed, manages to cut himself free and stab the siren to death. The Siren turns back into her natural blonde state and bleeds to death underwater.

When Prince Charming returns to Lake Nostos in order to heal his mother after she is shot by a stray arrow, he discovers the lake-bed has dried up due to the Siren's prior death. As he and [[Lancelot]] search for any remaining water, they find the creature's skeleton.
