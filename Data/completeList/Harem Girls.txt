==Background==
===Personality===
The Harem girls are shown to be somewhat snobbish, as evidenced by their dismissal of Aladdin and sarcastically feigning sadness regarding Aladdin's plight, as well as literally bump-checking him off their apartment. However, they do seem very fond of Prince Ali, and presumably any other handsome individual due to their swooning his highly-publicized arrival at Agrabah. Presumably, they later act on friendly terms with Aladdin and/or Jasmine due to them being among the invites to their wedding.

===''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves ]]''===

[[File:Aladdin(2019)_0487.jpg|thumb|250px|The Harem Girls, known as the School Girls in the live-action film.]]
The Harem Girls, who are known as the School Girls in this film, appear in live-action form in this remake of the 1992 animated musical ''Aladdin''. Unlike the original film, they seem quite fond of Aladdin, as when he accidentally enters their room during "One Jump Ahead", they are seen swooning over him and become somewhat concerned when their teacher tries to reprimand him.

When Aladdin returns to Agrabah as '''Prince Ali''', they swoon over him and are very impressed with him as he is presented by [[Genie]] who, at one point, disguises himself as one ("Prince Ali") and they are visible surprised when Genie's disguise is exposed.

They are later seen at the end of the film during Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding and later taking part in dancing with everyone in the palace during a reprise of "[[Friend Like Me]]".

==Trivia==
*The words 'harem' and 'girls' refers to either the wives, concubines or servants occupying a section of a house reserved for women members of a Muslim household.
*They are often compared to [[the Bimbettes]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', as they are flirtatious, fairly ditzy, and have more impressive figures than the main female lead; in this case, Jasmine. A primary difference between them, however, is that the Bimbettes are not known to have been stuck-up or snobbish to anyone in the film (except [[Belle]] to a small extent), while the Harem Girls act stuck up with Aladdin.
*Like the Bimbettes, whose hairstyles constantly change, the Harem girls' wardrobes constantly change in color. However, unlike the Bimbettes, their names are unknown and they have shorter, darker hair.
*Besides them, there are other harem girls summoned by [[Genie]] in the songs, "[[Friend Like Me]]" and "[[Prince Ali]]".
