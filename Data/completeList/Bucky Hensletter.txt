'''Bucky Hensletter''' is a recurring character from the [[Disney XD]]'s ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.  Although normally a harmless picked upon Geek, every so often he is pushed to moments of emotional tension so high, that he becomes victim to the Sorcerers dark magic and is turned into a monster. In "[[Got Stank?]]", [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]] turned him into a purple monster using [[Stank]]. He was partnered with Randy in the episode, "[[Monster Dump]]". Randy tricked Bucky into thinking that the volcano had different kinds of silt [[Mrs. Driscoll]] hasn't discovered yet, and Buck stated that the fact Randy made a convincing zing.

== History ==
In "Got Stank" following him "showboating" in the school marching band, by continually playing his triangle, he was kicked off the team. Overcome with grief, as this was the only thing he cared about. He fell victim to the Sorcerers dark magic, and was turned into a monster. In this form he attacked the matching band, declaring if he couldn't play in the marching band no one could. Randy confronted him and fought him back, but Bucky escaped. To lure him back Randy joined the marching band. At the game he returned, and Randy fought him again, this time he managed to destroy his triangle "dinger" which was possessed by the sorcerers dark magic turning him back to normal.

In "Silent Punch, Deadly Punch" following him humiliating himself by trying to serenade his love, Flute girl. He once again fell prey to the Sorcerers magic, Randy did battle with him again, this time quickly managing to return him back to human form.

In "Stanks Like Team Spirit" following him (and the rest of the team) losing the annual Chess match to McFists chess playing robot, overcome with grief and anguish he was turned into a monster, along with the rest of the team and multiple other students (he was the last one to turn.) In this form he went on a rampage, Randy was able to keep him at bay and he was returned to normal when Howard beat the robot.

In "[[Lucius O'Thunderpunch]]" once McFist possing as a new hero drove the Ninja away. He chose Bucky, as the weakest kid in school to break. So he would fall victim to the Sorcers magic. He did so by destroying his triangle, Bucky was once gain turned into a monster, but Randy returned beat him and the other monster, and destroyed the Ninja of the year plack returning him to normal.

==Personality==
Bucky is an over-dedicated band geek who has a passion for playing the triangle. He's also very goody-goody by nature, being a teacher's pet and following all the rules. Personality-wise, Bucky is over-emotional and is easily stressed or panicked by small things, making him one of the Sorcerer's frequent targets. He is also over-excited about small things, as shown in Monster Dump where he shows an over-enthusiastic reaction to silt.

If he is not being a goody-goody or worrying about silly things, he can be quite frequently seen being a show-off and gloating in his "talents" (most noticeably in "Got Stank?" and "[[Stanks Like Teen Spirit]]").

His personality makes him the target of Bash's bullying and also lands him into humiliating situations that often make him out to be the butt of the joke, causing him to be targeted by the Sorcerer.

Besides being over emotional and a target of bullying, he really likes to make silly jokes or puns. He is also rather intelligent. In fact, his intelligence and diligence have made him someone other Norrisville High students rely on to do their homework for them (as seen in "[[Raiders of the Lost Nomicon]]").

==Attire==
*'''School Uniform''' - White t-shirt with a blue design on the side and blue sneakers
*'''Band Attire''' - A blue shirt with yellow lines and buttons, blue shoes, blue pants with yellow lines on the side, a blue and yellow band player hat, yellow piece of cloth in the waist
*'''Instrument''' - Triangle

==Relationships==
===[[Randy Cunningham]]===
Bucky feels Randy is a bit irresponsible and is reluctant to be partnered with him for school events such as field trips (as seen in [[Monster Dump]]). He, however, doesn't think too poorly of Randy.

===[[Howard Weinerman]]===
Bucky also feels Howard is irresponsible, but he also has no ill will against him. Howard, however, thinks Bucky is a shoob, and will not hesitate to tell him that to his face (as seen in Escape from Detention Island). Howard also thinks Bucky is a teacher's pet (as he called him a "brown-noser" in [[Attack of the Killer Potatoes]]).

===[[Flute Girl]]===
They seem to be good friends, as he is seen hanging out with her on numerous occasions (most notably in "Monster Drill" and "Silent Punch, Deadly Punch") Though they are friends, Flute Girl tends to constantly bring reality down to him, a good example being when she informed him sternly about how there were no triangle solos in any of the marching band songs (as seen in Got Stank?). She is also not hesitant to show him her disapproval (ie rejecting his song in Silent Punch, Deadly Punch) It almost seems like even though they are friends, he seems to like her more than she likes him. Almost like she just kinda puts up with him and tolerates him for some reason.

===[[Stevens]]===
They are indeed friends, as Bucky picked him to be his gym partner in "[[30 Seconds to Math]]". They are also seen playing instruments next to each other in "Evil Spirit Week" and Bucky hid out under a pile of rubble with Stevens and Flute Girl in "[[Stanks Like Teen Spirit]]" shortly before he was stanked. Other than this, there is not a lot of information about their friendship.

===[[Bash Johnson]]===
Bucky does not particularly like Bash, as Bash constantly bullies him and takes any opportunity to humiliate Bucky (most notable in "[[Last Stall on the Left]]" and "Der Monster Klub"). In "[[Dawn of the Driscoll]]" they were partners on a science project where partners were not assigned. This could be because Bash forced him to be his partner or they ran out of other people to pick from so had to pick each other. In "[[Enter the Nomicon]]" he and Bash are crying together.

===[[Julian (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|Julian]]===
It seems they are friends, or at least acquaintances, as they were seen sitting next to each other at the lunch table in "[[Nukid on the Block]]".

===[[Theresa Fowler]]===
It is unknown if they are friends or not, but he was seen sitting next to her during Cooking class in "Nukid on the Block". It did not appear as though there was assigned seating, so he might have picked her to be his partner or vice versa.

==School and After School Activities==
===Marching Band===
He is Norrisville High's Marching Band's triangle player, making him one of their percussionists. He is VERY proud of his role in the band and believes he is the best triangle player in Norrisville. This belief causes him to show off a bit (as seen in [http://www.randycunningham9thgradeninja.wikia.com/wiki/Got_Stank Got Stank]).

===Chess Team===
He is part of Norrisville High's chess team, and he is pretty proud of his skills here as well. He is, again, found gloating in his abilities when he won against an opponent chess player from the rival school Flackville (as seen in "Stanks Like Teen Spirit").

===Mustache Society===
He weedled his way into this club with a presumably fake mustache. Though he got in at the beginning of the [[Secret Stache]] episode, he was not shown later on at their party. It is unknown if he just did not show up or if he was kicked out before the party started.

*Though he is intelligent, he can be easily deceived by others. An example of this is when Bash cried and hugged him believing Mac Antfee's "you-splosion" actually changed him. Bucky cried and hugged Bash back, also believing he was actually a changed person.
