==History==
Flora is the Mother of the [[Nymphs|Tree Nymphs]] in the tree nymphs' home. One day, Yarrow informs Flora that [[Mother Gothel|Gothel]] has been with humans. When Gothel returns, she is encouraged by Flora to go by her tree nymph form. She warns Gothel not to be with the humans, but Gothel insists the ones she went with are different. Flora reminds Gothel that she cannot be with the humans as they are irrational creatures, and that she is of eternal nature. She also reminds Gothel that she will become Mother one day, and as Gothel doesn't have a choice whether to accept the mantle or not, Flora directs her towards the right path.

After Gothel is betrayed by [[Isla]], she steals Gothel's key and manages to access the grove, before murdering all of the tree nymphs using axes and torches. By the time Gothel returns, everyone is dead, except Flora who is clinging onto life. Flora reassures Gothel she hasn't failed her or her sisters and tells her not to seek revenge despite her desire to do so and declares her the new Mother. As she dies, Flora tells her to remember that all Mothers know only goodness can bear sweet fruit. Following Flora's death, Gothel does not take her advice and murders Isla, as well as the rest of humanity.
