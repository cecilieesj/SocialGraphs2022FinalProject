==History==

=== Background ===
Gilbert London was a man in the film-industry during the 1930s. On the Halloween of [[1939]], he went in an elevator at [[the Hollywood Tower Hotel]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. When paranormal lightning struck the hotel, Gilbert and the other five guests were killed and bound as ghosts to the nightmarish [[The 5th Dimension|5th dimension]].

In the 1990s, the hotel would be reopened and Gilbert would be amongst the ghosts who terrorized new guests of the establishment.

=== Sunset Boulevard ===
A piece of luggage placed near the sign for Route 66 on Sunset Boulevard has Gilbert's name on it.  Beside this piece of luggage is one belonging to [[Carolyn Crosson]].

=== The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ===
Gilbert is found with the other ghosts in the ride's pre-show portraying his fate and later as a ghost in the hallway. His likeness is found in the 5th dimension and at the end of the ride he waves goodbye to guests.

== Other Appearances ==

=== [[Tower of Terror (film)]] ===
Snobbish and sarcastic, Gilbert has no qualms about picking on anyone with his snide remarks on people, which led to countless arguments with Dewey and Sally. In spite of his apparently unpleasant attitude, he does show a sense of loyalty and trust towards his fellow ghosts, which was reinforced when he and the others were surprised at Anna blaming Emeline for the tragedy, and by extension, to Buzzy and the others upon being helped in their effort at moving on with their deaths, expressing his gratitude as he and Carolyn ascend to Heaven.

=== Film Novelization ===
The novelization refers to him as Gilbert Lawrence and was described as having a Hamlet costume at one point in the story.
