He appears as a minor character in the [[1993]] stop-motion animated film, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. 

==Background==
The Easter Bunny is a holiday figure residing in Easter Town, who represents the holiday Easter. He is always seen wearing a yellow "HAPPY EASTER" sash and carrying a wicket basket of eggs. He is primarily based on the legendary figure of the same name, also known as Peter Cottontail. The Easter Bunny is rather tall for a rabbit, and is covered in pink, yellow, and white fur with bucked teeth, long ears, and a small nose.

==Appearances==

===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===
When [[Lock, Shock, and Barrel]] are given the task to kidnap "[[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Sandy Claws]]" and bring him to [[Halloween Town]], they accidentally travel to [[Easter Town]] (mistaking it for [[Christmas Town]]) and kidnap the wrong holiday figure, revealed to be the Easter Bunny. When the trio bring the proposed Sandy Claws to [[Jack Skellington]], he reveals that the pink bunny isn’t the right person. Frustrated, Jack clarified his instructions, while the Easter Bunny investigates and becomes scared of [[Behemoth]]. He quickly jumps back in the bag, and he is presumably brought back home. 

=== ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' ===
The Easter Bunny appears in the reimagined story of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' in ''As Told by Emoji''. Much like the film, he is mistakenly kidnapped by Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who believe him to be Sandy Claws. Jack then orders the children to bring him home. 

==Video games==

===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]''===
The Easter Bunny appears in the video game as a hostage of [[Oogie Boogie]]. As an act of revenge, Oogie Boogie kidnaps several holiday leaders from their holiday realms. As such, he kidnaps the Easter Bunny and several of its inhabitants, and locks them away. He also takes Easter Land's door. Eventually, Jack recovers the door and returns it to its rightful place, while also defeating Oogie Boogie and saving the Easter Bunny

===''[[Disney Crossy Road]]''===
The Easter Bunny appears as a secret playable character in ''Disney Crossy Road''. To unlock him, the player must collect 30 presents as Santa Claus and then play as Shock and find the Easter Bunny whilst playing the game as normal.
