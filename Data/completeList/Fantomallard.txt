}}'''Lord John Lamont Quackett''', the true identity of '''Fantomallard''' (original Italian name '''Fantomius''') was a gentleman thief from [[Duckburg]] during the [[1920]]s. When [[Donald Duck]] found his diary in Villa Rosa, this inspired him to become [[The Duck Avenger]].



Guido Martina scarcely used the character, since his role was limited to be Donald's inspiration, but Italian Disney comic artist and writer Marco Gervasio expanded on the character and his background, at first as part of flashbacks in Duck Avenger stories and later with a mini-series happening in the past. Fantomius lived in Villa Rosa with his fianc√©e and partner in crime [[Dolly Paprika|Dolly Duck a.k.a. Dolly Paprika]].

Some Danish comics show an aged yet still living FantomAllard who returns to Duckburg to test his successor, but he mistakenly believes [[Gladstone Gander]] to be the Duck Avenger, as Gladstone was the original inheritor of Villa Rosa.
