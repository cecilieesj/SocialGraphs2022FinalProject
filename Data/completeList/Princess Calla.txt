'''Princess Calla '''is a character from Disney's [[1985]]-[[1991|91]] television series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
Calla is the daughter of [[King Gregor]], and the princess of [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]]. Her mother is never mentioned, but is presumed to be deceased. She has shown great skill as a fighter, besting even her father in battle.

===Personality===
Calla is a tomboyish 12-year-old girl who dislikes having to be the "perfect princess" her father wants her to be. Instead of dealing with the pomp, she would much rather take part in governing the realm. She is friends with [[Cavin]], and it is hinted at times that she may possess more feelings for him than just as a friend.

==Role in the series==
Like many characters in the series, Calla initially believed that [[Gummi Bears]] were merely a fairy tale, though she often wished that they were real. In the episode "[[The Sinister Sculptor]]", she was given what were apparently statues of Gummi Bears. Unknown to her, the sculptor had used magic dust that turned the real Gummi Bears into statues. The episode ended with Calla remaining unaware of the Gummi Bears' existence.

In the series' sixth episode (but ninth overall segment), "[[A Gummi by Any Other Name]]", Calla finally meets the Gummi Bears after she and [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]] are kidnapped by [[Duke Igthorn]]. Following this episode, Calla is often seen having adventures with the Gummi Bears, often dragging Cavin along for the ride. She becomes best friends with Sunni, who dreams of being a princess. Together with Cavin, she shares many adventures of the Gummies of [[Gummi Glen|Gummie Glen]].

Later on in the series, in the episode "[[Girl's Knight Out]]", Calla becomes troubled when King Gregor holds a tournament to find a royal protector for her. Disliking the squires competing (Cavin is a page, the rank below squire), and realizing that having someone around would hamper her ability to visit the Gummies, she realizes that she could secretly enter the tournament herself. Donning a suit of armor as a disguise, Calla competes in both jousting and archery, despite dirty tactics from the squires. The final task is to steal a golden apple that is protected by the Black Knight. Sunni, who had been with her, gives her a vial of [[Gummiberry Juice]], but Calla declines, saying that becoming super strong would be too much of an advantage in facing the Black Knight, and the only proper way to confront him out in the open and gain a golden apple. Calla is able to do so successfully, but runs away when she realizes that the knight is none other than her own father. She eventually reveals herself to her father. Though confused at first, Gregor is impressed by Calla's abilities, and publicly declares her champion and capable of her own defense.

In "[[Princess Problems]]", Calla meets [[Princess Marie]], whose spoiled ways quickly frustrate Calla. When Marie thinks Sunni, who had come to see Calla, is Calla's doll, she quickly begins telling lies about Calla in order to get it for herself. Calla's attempts to retrieve Sunni simply cause Marie to tell more lies. Eventually, Marie's lies cause a fight to break out between [[King Jean-Claude|Marie's father]], and Dunwyn. Luckily for Calla, Marie's lies are learned of, halting the fight.

==Trivia==
*In literal Disney-animation-homage fashion, one of Calla's frequently worn formal dresses is based on [[Snow White]]'s classic dress. The bodice is identical, though with added long, white sleeves, and instead of the yellow skirt, the dress features a longer, white train.
*Calla is not included in the official [[Disney Princess]] line-up or in any of the merchandise. This is most likely due to the fact that she is from a TV series, whereas all of the official Disney Princesses come from films.
*She is one of a relatively small group of humans who find out about the existence of Gummi Bears during the course of the series. Other humans that become explicitly aware of the bears, are [[Cavin]], [[Duke Igthorn]], [[Lady Bane]], [[Sir Gawain]], [[Princess Marie]], [[Angelo Davini]], [[Flint Shrubwood]], [[The Hunter|the Hunter]], [[Rotocelli]], [[Doctor Dexter]], [[Marzipan]], [[Lord Willoughby]], [[Prince Yen Moon]] and his subjects, Carney's assistant from the episode "[[Never Give a Gummi an Even Break]]", and the boy who turned himself into a Giant, from the episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Stone]]".
