'''Emile''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Ratatouille]]''. He is [[Remy]]'s gluttonous older brother.

==Appearances==
===''[[Ratatouille]]''===
He is a brown (his mother's fur color), overweight rat, who is slightly larger than [[Remy|his younger brother]]. He is friendly, understanding, and is the only one whom Remy tells about his cooking, TV watching, and reading talent. He never tells their dad [[Django]], due to his brotherly support to Remy (although he did carelessly tell his friends about Remy's activities inside [[Gusteau's]]). Emile loves food; however, he often swallows food whole and, to Remy's disappointment, doesn't savor the flavors.

One day, Emile and Remy are smoking a mushroom by the chimney, before being struck by a flash of lightning. Impressed by the popcorned mushroom, the two venture into the kitchen for saffron. The [[Mabel|old lady]] is asleep, but a TV is on where Remy hears the news that [[Auguste Gusteau|Gusteau]], Remy's idol, has died. The old lady awakes sees the rats, and promptly produces a shotgun where she blasts the walls and roof. Her inaccurate shooting, however, brings down part of the ceiling where the entire [[Rat Colony|rat clan]] lives. After the rats manage to escape on their "rescue boats," Emile tries to coax Remy to grab onto a spatula [[Git]] is holding, but the old lady fires her rifle again, causing Remy to drift away from Emile and into the sewers.

One night, Emile unexpectedly finds Remy. After the two brothers embrace, happy to see each other again, Emile and Remy reunite with their family who believed Remy to have died in the rapids of the sewers. Django asks Remy to stay, but Remy shows his loyalty to [[Alfredo Linguini|Linguini]], having bonded with his new human friend while being absent from his rat colony.

When Remy is captured by [[Chef Skinner|Skinner]], who uses blackmail to order Remy to create a new successful frozen foods line, Emile notices and brings Django to help him free Remy from Skinner's limousine. With help from Emile and the entire rat colony, Linguini, [[Colette Tatou|Colette]], and Remy present to food critic [[Anton Ego]] and a disguised Skinner a version of a peasant dish, [[Ratatouille (food)|Ratatouille]].

Emile is last seen hanging out at the new restaurant [[La Ratatouille]] with Django and the rest of the rat colony as Remy surreptitiously prepares food for them and the human customers.

===''[[Your Friend the Rat]]''===
In the animated comedy short, Remy and Emile teach the viewers about the history of the rat in order to bring a better understanding between the two species.

==Trivia==
*In the books and on [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]]'s official website, Emile is referred to as Remy's younger brother.<ref>[http://www.pixar.com/features_films/RATATOUILLE#/detail/1913/internal/1964?ajax=2/1 Emile on Pixar.com]</ref> In the [[Ratatouille|movie]], Emile calls Remy "little brother" when he and Django rescued Remy from Skinner's car, suggesting he is the older brother of Remy. However, it is possible that Emile means "little brother" as Remy being literally smaller than him.
*When the ''Ratatouille'' teaser trailer first premiered, many fans thought that it was [[David Schwimmer]] voicing Emile due to [[Peter Sohn]] having a similar voice. Emile's name was also rumored for the longest time to be Rollie. David Schwimmer would later voice a Thark in ''[[John Carter]]'', which was directed by executive producer [[Andrew Stanton]].
*While recording the voice for Emile, [[Brad Bird]] always had Peter Sohn eating something so his mouth would be full. The food that worked best was licorice, so Sohn would usually eat {{WikipediaLink|Twizzlers}} or {{WikipediaLink|Red Vines}}.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/2015/11/18/456492003/in-good-dinosaur-director-peter-sohn-helps-an-herbivore-conquer-his-fears In ''Good Dinosaur'', Director Peter Sohn Helps An Herbivore Conquer His Fears], NPR ''Fresh Air'', Terry Gross, November 18, 2015.</ref>
