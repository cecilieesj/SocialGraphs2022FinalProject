The '''Prime Minister''' is a character in the [[2004]] Disney short, ''[[The Cat That Looked at a King]]'', originally released in the 2004 DVD edition of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.

==Background==
The Prime Minister is an animated human character who appears in the painting where he observes the [[King (The Cat That Looked at a King)|King]] and his collection of books containing facts and knowledge. Though he serves the king, he is constantly seen reading his own book quietly without any interruptions, implying that he likes reading his book quietly without hearing any interruptions.

==Role in the short==
The Prime Minister is first seen observing the [[King (The Cat That Looked at a King)|King]] scrambling through his collection of books with a worried expression while trying to read his book quietly while being asked if turkeys ''literally'' come from Turkey which the King tells him not to miss a word. He asks him to repeat the question he asked him but he demands the Minister to work with him, to which he answers his question and alter while asking about the Queen a question about her to which the Minister suddenly answers his question. However, when a [[Cat (The Cat That Looked at a King)|white cat]] enters the painting, the Prime Minister hears a discussion between the Cat and the King, still reading his book while noticing the commotion.

While the Cat is questioning the King his first question, he answers "Poppycock" which the Minister explains that the Cat is right. When the King is asking the Cat a second question about the measure of a man, she answers the question for him just as the Minister continues reading his book while noticing the conversation between the two until the Cat then asks the King one final question about what is the strongest thing in the world to which as the King tries to answer her question, his wife the Queen explains to him that patience is a possible answer to answer the Cat's question. After the King realizes who he once was with his relationship with the Queen and she gives the Cat a necklace as a token of appreciation, the Minister then happily reacts to the King rejoicing with his wife just before the Cat leaves the painting as a farewell.

==Trivia==
*His voice actor, David Ogden Stiers, also voiced the [[Archdeacon]] from ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', who curiously is also another member of the clergy.
