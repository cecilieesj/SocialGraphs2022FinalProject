{{Quote|This penguin's got a plan!|Pip}}

'''Pip''' is a penguin and one of the two main characters of the television series ''[[T.O.T.S.]]''. He is a T.O.T.S. baby deliverer and is [[Freddy (T.O.T.S.)|Freddy]]'s best friend and partner.

==Background==
===Appearance===
Pip is a black and white penguin. He has blue irises, a golden yellow beak and golden yellow feet. Pip wears his T.O.T.S. uniform, which is a blue collared shirt with the insignia of T.O.T.S., white buttons, and navy blue details on the shoulders. He also wears a light blue cap with the insignia of T.O.T.S.. When he goes to sleep, he wears teal pajamas and a nightcap, patterned with snowflakes. For Halloween, he dressed up as an ice cube.

When he was a baby, Pip wore a white diaper with a blue trim and a yellow collar. He also had on a tiny blue cap and a blue bib with four white circles on it.

===Personality===
When it comes to delivering babies, Pip is willing to lend a wing. He is the one who uses a map, and his sense of smell, to find the way during deliveries. He also comes up with solutions to any troubles that pop up before or during a delivery.

Pip is the more logical one of team Pip and Freddy. He studies the T.O.T.S. instruction manual all the time. He also stresses out if the rules are not followed.

At times, he puts his own desires before the baby. An example was when he neglected Percy the Peacock's egg because he was focused on winning the Easter Egg Hunt.

==Trivia==

*In "[[You've Gotta Be Kitten Me]]," he easily gets emotional.
*In "[[Back to Cool]]," he has a brotherly relationship with a baby penguin named Penn.
*In "[[Hug-A-Pip]]," [[Mr. Woodbird]] made a lovey for a snow leopard baby named Lucy that's modelled after him.
*In “[[Lend Me Your Paw]],” Freddy mentioned that he (Pip) is older than him (Freddy).
*In "[[Seas the Day]]", he can't use his sniffer when wearing his underwater mask, since it would be the only thing he'd smell with it on.
*He is the only main character in the show to have needed a voice change.<br />
