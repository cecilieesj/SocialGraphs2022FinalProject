}}'''Nanny Maim'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398784/</ref> is a minor villain from the animated television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''.

==History==
A former head of an English academy for Nannies, her school went out of business as the practice of using strict nannies to raise children became less fashionable andÂ popular. She was not happy and decided that she would prove it. To this end, she developed a machine that turned people into babies and began to steal pacifiers, claiming she could make more money 'making babies unhappy than happy'. Many victims of this machine were from a local town, and anyone who spoke of what went on in the old academy were often abducted, even if they had tried to dodge the question.

Ironically, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] was able to defeat Nanny Maim by using her own babysitting skills to pacify her minions using gentle methods, then reverting them to their original age with the machine while they were calm and distracted. Lacking combat skills of her own, she was easily detained afterwards by the police. She claims that the super strength exhibited by the babies was the product of a strict nanny.
