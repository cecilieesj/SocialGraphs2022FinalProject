}}'''The Arab''' is the main antagonist of the Goofy and Donald's cartoon ''[[Crazy with the Heat]]''.

==Role==
He along with the Oasis Soda Fountain first appeared before Goofy as a hallucination.

He offered Goofy drinks but every time Goofy tried to drink the hallucination disappears for a short time.

This happened multiple times and as Goofy was angry and tired of it and wanted to leave, but the Arab orders him to owe him six bucks and forced Goofy to carry a stack of dishes, but thanks to Donald all the dishes got broken and the Arab, angry at this, attacks them with a sword, and Donald and Goofy escaped on a camel.
