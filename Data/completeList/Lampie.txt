==Role in the film==
Lampie is first seen exiting the pub after having had a few drinks. As he clumsily rides his bike on the way home, he comes across a boy named [[Pete (Pete's Dragon)|Pete]]. Then he meets [[Elliott]]. He doesn't know Elliott is a dragon until he finally comes to full realization, starts panicking, and runs back into the pub in terror. He tries to convince everyone in the pub of Elliott's existence while singing the musical number "[[I Saw a Dragon]]" and drinking more beer but to no avail until his daughter, [[Nora]], arrives to take him back home.

Later at the lighthouse, Nora tells her father to calm down to get some rest after his excited discovery of seeing a dragon just before Nora puts Lampie to rest. The next day, Lampie walks by Pete who recognizes him as the boy with his dragon Elliott just before his daughter tells him to calm down just as Pete explains that the dragon's name is Elliott much to Lampie's fear to which Lampie calms down and agrees to return to the pub to apologize. Later at home, Lampie warns Nora and Pete that dragons are not allowed on the lighthouse by order of the government. Nora then discusses with Lampie that Elliott cannot be in the Town of Passamaquoddy because she would fear that Elliott could cause the same trouble he did when walking with Pete just before having breakfast and doing cleanup on the lighthouse to which as Pete leaves to show Elliott a picture of Paul, Lampie discusses with Nora about Elliott before going to the hardware store.

At the pub, Lampie arrives and meets Dr. Terminus and Hoagy and discusses with the two so Terminus would know anything about dragons to which while discussing about a real fire-breathing dragon, he asks Lampie that what he needs is a vet to which Terminus discusses to know if there is a real dragon in Passamaquoddy to which Lampie agrees as while discussing with him, Terminus denies that he cannot meet Elliott at this moment and has to make an appointment with a young woman interested in nursing career. As Dr. Terminus leaves, Lampie discusses with Hoagy about a plan to see Elliott and after devising the plan, he takes Hoagy to the rocky area where Elliott would be at. Lampie then convinces Hoagy that this cave is the area where Elliott is at as Lampie warns Hoagy to not let Nora notice this. Lampie then discusses with Hoagy about Elliott's abilities to which while exploring, the two gasp in fear which also frightens Elliott a bit. As Lampie says Elliott's name, Elliott overhears him as Lampie tells Hoagy to be brave when talking to a dragon. However, Elliott ends up breathing fire a bit during a short belch, frightening the two away.

The next day, Lampie wakes up after hearing a loud foghorn blast just as he helps Pete paint the house just as Nora and her father explain that the lighthouse is Pete's new home while Elliott is to live in the cave as Nora sings the musical number "Brazzle Dazzle Day". Later at the docks, Lampie, Pete, and Nora catch a lobster only to find out that the Gogans have returned, interrupting their plans to catch seafood just as the three stand up against the Gogans to which Elliott manages to help ward off the Gogans to save Pete, Nora, and Lampie. That night, Lampie approaches Pete telling him that Elliott found Paul to which Lampie explains that he trust his evidence if it were for Elliott followed by Nora telling Pete to stop talking about make-believe.

Later, Hoagy sees the ship where Paul and the sea captain are at only for the fire at the lighthouse to be extinguished by a crashing wave just as Nora tells Lampie to to ignite the lamp. Later, Nora warns Lampie that the ship where Paul and the captain are at is about to hit a reef to which Lampie alerts his daughter to sound in the alarm just as Elliott manages to breathe fire to ignite the wick inside the lighthouse's lamp to rescue Paul and the sea captain.

The next day, Lampie, Nora, and Paul walk across the town of Passamaquoddy as the townsfolk are happy that Elliott saved the town. He later attends the mayor's ceremony where he thanks Elliott for saving the town. At the end of the film, Lampie sings a reprise of "Brazzle Dazzle Day" along with Paul and Nora as they stroll across the lighthouse. He later bids Elliott a farewell, along with Pete, Nora, and Paul.
