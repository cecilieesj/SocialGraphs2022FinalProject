|status = Active}}'''Medusalith "Medusa" Amaquelin''' is a member of the [[Inhumans]], wife to [[Black Bolt]], and sister to [[Crystal Amaquelin]]. Medusa is best known for her long, thick head of red hair, which she can psychokinetically wield like countless extra appendages.
Medusa was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Background==
===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
Medusa's most notable feature is her unusually long and luxurious red hair (six feet in length when fully relaxed) the strands of which are no thicker than the average strand of human hair and just as soft when she wills it to be. However, each strand possesses greater tensile strength and durability than steel wire of the same thickness, and Medusa has the psychokinetic ability to wield all of them like countless extra appendages. With concentration, she can move her hair in almost any manner imaginable.

{{Stubsection}}

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
She and the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family are mind-controlled by Maximus where she is used to declare war on [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Once [[Maximus the Mad|Maximus]]' crown is removed by [[Spider-Man]], Medusa and the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family are freed from his control. Medusa accompanied the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family when they confront Spider-Man and Triton outside the abandoned city of Atarog. When Spider-Man begged forgiveness for trespassing while explaining why they did that, Medusa interpreted for Black Bolt stating that they are here to give them a ride back to the Triskelion while thanking them for protecting Atarog.

===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''===
She is among the Inhumans that get affected by a plague that causes crystals to grow on their body. Medusa is freed from her stasis by [[Star-Lord]] when the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] are brought to Attilan by Lockjaw. She helps the Guardians of the Galaxy when Maximus the Mad uses his mind-control technology on [[Black Bolt]], and when [[Ronan the Accuser]] plans to destroy Attilan. Once those threats are thwarted and the plague is eliminated, Medusa thanks the Guardians of the Galaxy on Black Bolt's behalf. Medusa helps the Guardians of the Galaxy when Maximus tricks his way out of his imprisonment.

===''[[Avengers Assemble|Avenger: Ultron Revolution]]''===
Medusa appears with Black Bolt, Gorgon, Karnak, and Lockjaw at the time when an Inhuman ship carrying Seeker and the Alpha Primitives crashes into the mountains near Maple Falls. During the Avengers' fight with the Inhumans, Falcon engaged with Medusa. When Inferno hatches from his Terrigen cocoon, the Avengers and the Inhumans had to work together to stop Inferno. In the episode "The Inhuman Condition," Medusa is among the Inhumans that are captured by Ultron. She is later freed by the Avengers.
