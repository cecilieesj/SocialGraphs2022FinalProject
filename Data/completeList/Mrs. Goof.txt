'''Mrs. Goofy''', also known as '''Mrs. Geef''', was the wife of [[Goofy]] and mother of [[Max Goof#Goofy Junior|Goofy Junior]] in the 1950s ''Goofy'' shorts.

==History==
While her face is hidden from the viewers, her red hair is shown and her voice is heard. She appeared to be slender and rather tall, with light fair skin similar to Goofy's muzzle where his whiskers extend outward. Not much is known about her, except for the fact that she was nearly as goofy as her husband and known for her undesirable driving skills.

She later appeared in the [[1977]] picture book "[[Goofy Minds the House]]", in which both she and Junior were redesigned to more closely resemble Goofy's design. More recently, however, she has since faded into obscurity and never appeared again in any modern Disney media (see "Trivia" below for information pertaining to Goofy's wife in ''Goof Troop'').

*''[[Cold War]]''

==Trivia==
*When the television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' came about in [[1992]], the concept of Goofy's son was reworked from Goofy Junior into [[Max Goof]], while Goofy's wife was curiously absent, with Goofy himself depicted as a single father with no mention of his wife/Max's mother ever given by the show or its related media.
*[[:File:Early Character Art for Goof Troop, including a design of Max's mother simply labelled as 'Mrs Goofy'?.png|Early concept art for ''Goof Troop'']] depicts a woman labeled as 'Mrs. Goofy?', suggesting that she was at least considered at one point to be included in the series. However, it is likely that she was scrapped early on in the series' development as the other characters shown are still drawn in their earlier designs.
*[[:File:The last paragraph speaks about Max's mother, and gives an insight of a potentially pitched way of how she died..png|Early production documents for ''Goof Troop'']] contain a proposed explanation for the absence of Goofy's wife, proposing that she may have fallen off a cliff while Goofy was taking her picture during a visit to the Grand Canyon. However, this was a very early idea that never made it into the series itself, along with other early concepts such as the inclusion of [[Goofy's Father]] as a Grandpa character, P.J. and Pistol having an obnoxious older sister named Patti, and Pistol's real name being "Precious". All of these (including the proposed death of Goofy's wife) were ultimately discarded from the series' development and it's release.
*Nonetheless, there is a very widespread misconception that it was once stated in ''Goof Troop'' that Max's mother had passed away through unknown circumstances prior to the series' beginning, with Goofy allegedly telling Max "She's up there with the stars." or "She's up there amongst the stars." However, this statement was never actually given in any episode of ''Goof Troop'', being the product of longtime speculation and misremembered hearsay.
*Officially, when inquired about Max's mother, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 Disney's Guest Services] once declared there to be "no definitive answer" as to "who Max's mother is and where "Mrs. Goofy" went", ultimately making the fate and identity of Max's mother a complete enigma that remains unexplored and unanswered to this day.
[[file:Geeft les Koken.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The mother of the ice age family seen in this comic may possibly provide an idea of what Max Goof's mother might look like.]]
*Likewise, in December [[2020]], when asked directly about the identity of Max's mother, ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' director [[Kevin Lima]] stated "We talked about Max’s mother casually, but there’s never been any conclusive evidence of who (or what) she might be."<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1337846851253354496 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Dec 12, 2020]</ref> and "It’s all speculation. There is no concrete answer to this question."<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1338163949007728643 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Dec 13, 2020]</ref>
*In a short two-page Dutch comic strip titled "Goofy geeft les over... Koken" ("Goofy Teaches About... Cooking"), originally published on [[March 7]], [[2003]], Goofy gives Max a brief history lesson about cooking. When he describes how cooking was done in the ice age, there is a family of three cave people shown consisting of a father, a mother, and a son. The father resembles Goofy, the son resembles Max, and the mother resembles a female version of Goofy with eyelashes and a bone for a hairbow (a la {{WikipediaLink|Pebbles Flintstone}}). Since the father and son are based on Goofy and Max, and since the mother resembles a female counterpart of Goofy in the same way that [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[Daisy Duck]] resemble female counterparts of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]], respectively (in that they both have eyelashes and hairbows to distinguish themselves from their male counterparts), the mother seen in this comic may very well provide a glimpse as to what Max's mother might look like.
