'''Spider-Gwen''', also known as '''Ghost-Spider''' (real name '''Gwen Stacy''') is a teenage superheroine with powers similar to [[Spider-Man]] from [[Marvel Comics]].

Gwen Stacy was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Spider-Gwen wears a black bodysuit with white areas that form a spider design, a white hood with the interior lining being magenta with cyan web patterns, matching magenta-and-cyan designs on her upper arms, and cyan soles to her boots.

==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
A native of Miles' dimension, Gwen Stacy assumed the role of Spider-Woman after Miles was transported to [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s dimension. Using technology stolen from her [[Captain George Stacy|father]]'s robot program and with the help of her world's version of [[Aunt May|May Parker]], Gwen became a superhero in Miles' absence by simulating spider powers despite having no spider powers of her own. However, due to her activity, she also had to deal with her father's pursuit of vigilantes.

When Miles returns along with Peter, Gwen helps them recover the remaining Siege Perilous piece, which was at the police station. Gwen goes to visit her father in order to distract him while Peter and Miles recover the piece. However, this fails when [[Wolf Spider]] attacks the station and soon takes Rio Morales hostage at Miles' home. After rescuing Rio, Peter, Gwen, and Miles confront Wolf Spider in his underwater lair. Wolf Spider claims the Siege Perilous and starts to drain the life-force of every spider-based character in the multiverse. During the battle, Miles and Gwen are claimed in the process, but Peter tricks Wolf Spider into claiming his life, as holding all the life-forces at once proves to be too much for Wolf Spider to handle. Wolf-Spider soon shatters, allowing the life-forces to return to their bodies. The three Spiders then leave the lair but run into Gwen's father who learned of his daughter's superhero life after speaking with Rio. George accepts Gwen's role and the two then reconcile.

===''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''===
Gwen Stacy is a student at [[Horizon High]] and friends with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], [[Miles Morales]], and Anya Corazon. She is voiced by [[Laura Bailey]]. She was inspired by her uncle Raymond Warren (later revealed to be the villainous Jackal) to pursue science. She often assists Spider-Man in fights using her quick wits and genetic knowledge.

During the "Spider Island" arc, she was one of the first people affected by Jackal's spider chemicals spread into the air and gained spider superpowers. With her fans calling her "Spider Gwen", she assists Spider-Man in combating criminals until the chemicals cause her to mutate into a Man-Spider. She is later cured when Spider-Man spreads the cure for the city by exploding Osborn Academy.

===''[[Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors|Marvel Rising]]''===
Gwen appears in the [[2018]] franchise, with [[Dove Cameron]] reprising her role. In this continuity, she will be referred to as [[Spider-Slayers|Ghost-Spider]].<ref name="Collider">{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/marvel-rising-secret-warriors-movie-series-cast/#squirrel-girl|title=Marvel Announces Animated Feature Film ''Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors''|website=Collider|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref> She first appears as the protagonist of the ''Marvel Rising: Initiation'' shorts that precede the animated film, where she is on the run from the police and other superheroes after Ghost-Spider is framed for the murder of Gwen's friend, Kevin. She gains the trust of [[Ms. Marvel]] and [[Squirrel Girl]] following an encounter with the heroes before Ghost-Spider is inevitably captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Quake]] and [[Patriot (Rayshaun Lucas)|Patriot]]. However, she escapes with the help of Quake who discerned Ghost-Spider's civilian identity.

She returns in the special ''Marvel Rising: Chasing Ghosts'' followed by ''Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron''.

===''[[Spidey and his Amazing Friends]]''===
Gwen appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series, voiced by [[Lily Sanfelippo]]. As Ghost-Spider, she defends New York City from villians alongside her friends, Peter (Spidey) and Miles (Spin). Like the ''Marvel Rising'' incarnation, Gwen has Gwen Poole's partially dyed pink highlights in her hair. She loves drumming, reading detective novels, and is really good at figuring out clues.

==[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]==
Gwen Stacy does not appear in the MCU, but the version that appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' films (played by [[Emma Stone]]) is mentioned in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''. Gwen's Peter Parker, [[the Amazing Spider-Man]], tells his [[Spider-Man|MCU counterpart]] about the death of his girlfriend, describing her as "his [[Michelle Jones|MJ]]", the girlfriend of the MCU Peter. Gwen's Spider-Man explains that he will never forgive himself for his failure in saving her. While trying to move on from the loss and be the hero Gwen wanted him to be, he eventually became rageful and bitter. 

Not wishing his younger counterpart to suffer and end up like him, the Amazing Spider-Man watches with fondness the relationship of this universe's Peter and MJ. At the Statue of Liberty, during the final battle of the film, MJ falls off the scaffolding and her Peter fails to reach her because of the interference of the [[Green Goblin]]. Horrified that his younger self might suffer the same as he did, he jumps and saves MJ, preventing her to die in a very similar way that Gwen did. Saving MJ from the same fate Gwen endured, makes the Amazing Spider-Man emotional and he almost cries while holding MJ when he safely lands with her on the ground.

== Disney Parks ==
=== [[Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure]] ===
There are several references to Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman in the queue for this attraction where she is identified as a member of the ''Worldwide Engineering Brigade''.  Gwen's locker is located within the WEB facility with painted on feminist quotes, science jokes, and the logo for her band ''The Mary Janes''.  Additionally, Gwen's skateboard is locked up in the foyer with her Spider-Gwen color-scheme and, "The Mary Janes" printed on it.  She is indirectly referenced on a notice-board featuring a poster for drummer-auditions in a punk band called ''The Gamma Rays'' which has Gwen's color-scheme.

==Trivia==
*Spider-Gwen was planned to be released as a figurine for the game ''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition|Disney Infinity 3.0]]'' prior to being canceled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://infinityinquirer.com/2016/06/24/here-is-your-first-look-at-the-now-cancelled-spider-gwen-disney-infinity-figure/|title=Here is your First Look at the (Now-Cancelled) "Spider-Gwen" ''Disney Infinity'' Figure|website=Infinity Inquirer|date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>
*Her appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' is Dove Cameron's second animated role, the first being as [[Mal]] in ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]]''.
*The primary version of Gwen Stacy in the Marvel Comics was the college girlfriend of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] who was tragically killed during a battle between Spider-Man and the [[Green Goblin]]. Her death is considered one of the most iconic moments in comic book history.
*Before Gwen Stacy's superhero persona of "Spider-Gwen" made her television debut in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Gwen Stacy has appeared in animation before in ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series'' and ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'', and in the live-action movies ''Spider-Man 3'', ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', and ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'', where she was played by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] and [[Emma Stone]] respectively.
**Unlike the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' incarnation, her comic version was actually superpowered, hailing from an alternate dimension where she was bitten by the radioactive spider, rather than Peter Parker, who to get vengeance on bullies, transformed into the [[Lizard]]. In a battle that left Peter dead, Gwen was devastated, and sought to honor him by being a hero. This depiction of her reappears in ''[[Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors]]'', albeit replacing Peter with an Inhuman named Kevin as her best friend.
*Ghost-Spider also appears as a main character in the Sony computer-animated film ''{{WikipediaLink|Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse}}'', voiced by [[Hailee Steinfeld]]. However, the film is purely a {{WikipediaLink|Sony Pictures Animation}} project and has zero involvement from Disney nor Marvel Studios.
