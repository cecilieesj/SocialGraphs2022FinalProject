'''Pico''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]’s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''. He is a cheeky keel-billed toucan who is a friend of [[Antonio Madrigal]]. 

==Background==
When Antonio first received his gift to communicate with animals, Pico became his first animal companion. The toucan thusly acts as the leader of Antonio's menagerie, and was responsible for inviting the rest of Encanto's wildlife into the Madrigal family. 

==Trivia==
*Pico is [[Alan Tudyk]]’s ninth consecutive role in the [[Disney Animated Canon]].
**Tudyk previously voiced another bird character in the canon, being the chicken [[Heihei]] in ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]''.
*Despite having an official name, the credits simply list Pico as "Toucan".
*Pico’s name translates to “beak” in Spanish.
