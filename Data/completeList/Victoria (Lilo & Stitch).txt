==Physical appearance==
Victoria has fair skin with freckles and brown hair tied in a ponytail (she gets her hair cut by [[Clip]] into a new style in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''). She wears an off-white shirt, red shorts, and black sandals as her regular clothing. She also wears a traditional hula costume when attending hula classes.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
In "[[Swapper (episode)|Swapper]]", Victoria moved into [[Kokaua Town]] and joined [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s hula class. She first met Lilo and [[Stitch]] at their lemonade stand where she asked for some, but Stitch drank it all. When she and Lilo were starting to become friends, [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] attempted to befriend her so that she would not be Lilo's friend, claiming that she was weird. However, despite Mertle's best efforts, Victoria revealed that she also liked weird things and decided to become Lilo's best friend, to which Mertle angrily responded by saying, "We would never tolerate anyone who actually has fun with Lilo." As a result, Mertle ditched Victoria who then decided to stay with Lilo as her friend.

Victoria appeared briefly in the episode "[[Slick (episode)|Slick]]" where she, Lilo, and the other girls competed against each other to sell the most amount of candy bars for their hula halau.

In "[[Snooty (episode)|Snooty]]", she became frightened of [[Snooty|Experiment 277]], a large purple bat-like experiment designed to mine and enrich Snootonium, which she believed was a vampire. After Lilo discovered it was an experiment, she tried to convince Victoria not to slay it, but to catch it and try to make friends with it. But after it put Stitch out of commission, she refused to believe Lilo and decided to team up with [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] to slay the experiment (who, unknown to her, was intending to use her as bait). Later, however, after Lilo showed up and saved her from Gantu, she realized her mistake and saved Snooty from Gantu. Furthermore, when Snooty cleared Victoria's sinuses, she decided to keep him as a pet.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", she appeared with Mertle and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the other hula girls]] in Lilo's dream where they all treated her nicely at first, but then treated her very badly along with the other girls when the dream turned into a nightmare (turning into a giant zombie with the other girls).

She made a very short appearance at the end of "[[Wishy-Washy (episode)|Wishy-Washy]]", where she, Lilo and the other girls all graduated to intermediate hula.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Victoria was seen first getting a new hairstyle at [[Clip]]'s [[Beauty Parlor|beauty salon]], and later walking Snooty before the latter was snatched by a [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clone]], much to her confusion.

==Trivia==
*Victoria is revealed to like the color orange and hate the color pink, just like [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]].
*Since Victoria is the caretaker of [[Snooty|a genetic experiment]], it is unknown if she is under the official protection of the United Galactic Federation as Lilo and [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] are.
