==Background==
The Baron rules the city of Vardaros, residing in a luxurious castle with his daughter, [[Stalyan]]. He is a deeply feared member of the criminal underworld and has allied himself with other thieves such as Flynn and Lance to carry out his bidding throughout regions beyond Vardaros itself. The Baron, however, does not appear to partake in actual operations on the field. He instead spends the majority of his time at his castle, feeding his swans and wallowing in luxury. Almost no one ever sees him.

Unsurprisingly, he cannot be trusted and has betrayed his accomplices before. He, however, is not immune to being betrayed, himself—Flynn, Lance, Angry, and Red are all known to have crossed the Baron at least once. He holds special disdain for Flynn, who, at one point, broke Stalyan's heart by refusing to marry her. Those who cross the Baron are subjected to a slow and painful death at the bite of a venomous Kai spider he keeps in his ring.

==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==
===Season one===
The Baron is first mentioned in "[[The Return of Strongbow]]" where, eight years in the past, Weasel betrays Flynn and Lance during a royal caravan robbery. As he makes off with the goods, Weasel notes that his actions were "Baron's orders". Eight years later, Lance ropes Flynn (now going by his real name, Eugene) into robbing the Baron's treasury, which they accomplish.

In "[[Big Brothers of Corona]]", the Baron sends Weasel, a guy known as "the cutter", and 2 other men to find and capture two young thieves who crossed him. The girls, [[Angry and Red]], plan to steal from Corona so they may use the money to pay for travel expenses to escape the Baron's clutches. Unfortunately, Weasel finds them, though Eugene and Lance turn themselves in exchange for the girls' freedom, knowing the Baron would much prefer the heads of his two most hated adversaries. Weasel agrees, but before he can make the delivery, he and his men are defeated by Angry and Red.

===Season two===
In "[[Beyond the Corona Walls]]", Eugene and his friends make a stop in Vardaros during their travels for resupply. The cutter tells the goons to "spread the word, Flynn Rider's in town". Then the Baron asks if Flynn is in Vardaros, and the Weasel says he is. The Weasel asks if he can dispose of him, but the Baron tells him that he wants to settle things with Flynn properly and sends the Weasel to bring Flynn to him. Eugene, Lance, and [[Shorty]] are taken to the Baron's castle, where the former is interrogated by a bitter Stalyan. She reveals to still have feelings for Eugene, however, prompting the Baron to make a proposition—Eugene must keep to his original promise and marry Stalyan, or he, Lance and Shorty will perish. To get his point across, the Baron unleashes his Kai spider upon Lance and it bites his hand. With no other choice, Eugene agrees to marry Stalyan in exchange for the antidote from the Baron as a wedding present.

During the ceremony, the wedding is crashed by Eugene's girlfriend, [[Rapunzel]], and her accomplices—[[Adira|one of whom]] manages to free Eugene and Maximus. Furious, the Baron engages in battle with Eugene and successfully pins the latter down. As the Baron prepares to unleash his Kai spider, Shorty's clumsiness causes the spider to be startled and ends up biting the Baron, instead. Fatally infected with the spider's venom, the Baron desperately searches for the anti-venom, but it had already been stolen by Rapunzel's chameleon, [[Pascal]], and used to cure Lance. The Baron, nevertheless, accepts his oncoming death, and tries to strike Eugene down in vengeance, but is thwarted by Rapunzel. With the battle over, Stalyan tends to her father, vowing to find more anti-venom and settle the score with Eugene afterward.

===Season Three===
Up to the events of "[[Flynnpostor]]", it is revealed the Baron had become disfigured by the spider venom. He has lost his entire criminal organization, and his daughter has moved on without him. With nothing left to live for, all he wants is to get revenge on Eugene. He shackles [[Brock Thunderstrike]] to a stake, then Eugene comes down. Hearing the name "Eugene" makes him think that Eugene is the real Flynn Rider. He shackles Eugene to the same stake and tries to kill them both by drowning them but they manage to get out. Later Brock knocks him out with a frying pan. His attempts are foiled and he is put in jail by Eugene, who became [[Corona]]'s new captain of the guards.
