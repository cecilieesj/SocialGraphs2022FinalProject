'''Oscar Proud''' is one of the main characters from ''[[The Proud Family]] ''franchise.

==Personality==
[[Penny Proud|Penny]], [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|BeBe and CeCe]]'s father is considered a failure by many. He is the longtime rival of mogul [[Wizard Kelly]].

He is the owner of a factory named Proud Snacks (which makes anybody who eats them sick, except Peabo, who is the only person who likes them). Penny shows early signs of this as well and [[Suga Mama]] repeatedly makes references to Penny "taking after her daddy."

He loves his family very much but has a strong weakness for beautiful women. He often flirts with other women and almost cheats on his wife [[Trudy Proud|Trudy]] with Wizard Kelly's gorgeous wife. Oscar also has problems with Trudy ruining his fun and perfect moments. In spite of his rivalry with Wizard Kelly, he does enjoy coming and going to his stores and restaurant for his amusement.

==Background==
Oscar Proud was born on May 18, 1965, to his father [[Percy Proud|Percy]], and his mother [[Suga Mama]], during his childhood, his parents often favored his older brother [[Bobby Proud]], over him, which made [[Oscar]] very jealous of him.

He attended Willy T. Ribbs Junior High, where won the [[1977]] Spelling Bee and played on the basketball team leading them to the state championship where he would lose to [[Wizard Kelly]]. 

His met [[Trudy Proud]] in college and they married shortly after having their daughter [[Penny Proud|Penny]], on June 4, 1987.

Oscar is best friends with [[Felix Boulevardez]], his neighbor from across the street and the two often get wrapped in get-rich-quick schemes together. They also have a lot of things in common, including sports, watching TV, and flirting with attractive women, which usually ends them in trouble with their wives.

Some running gags throughout the series include Oscar getting into trouble, causing trouble, people complaining about his nasty snacks, yelling Trudy's name whenever seeing ridiculous, and getting into arguments. He also gets attacked regularly by various animals. Sometimes Oscar would get beat up for no reason throughout the series.

==Relationships==
*[[Trudy Proud]] - Trudy is Oscar's wife. While they do love each other deeply, they have had their obstacles. Oscar  often get fed up with Trudy's bossy behavior towards him and Trudy does get fed up with his childish demeanor. Oscar tends to flirt with attractive women he barely knows but he never intended on actually cheating on his wife. Despite their obstacles, they are caring parents who do love each other and work together to raise their kids well.
*[[Penny Proud]] - Penny is Oscar's oldest daughter. Being a teenager, Penny does have her moments of rebelling against her father but there is no doubt the two of them are really close. Oscar refers to Penny as "Baby Girl" and is extremely overprotective of her. Penny is very loving towards Oscar but does get irritated when he says she can't date boys.
*[[Suga Mama]] - Oscar's mother. They do have a complicated relationship but at the end of the day, they are still family. There have been episodes that prove the two really do love each other and look out for their well-being but most of the time, they are often seen insulting each other or Suga Mama being outright abusive towards him. It's revealed in "Penny Potter" that Suga treated Oscar the way she did because she was treated the same way growing up, although she never really noticed it before.
*[[Bobby Proud]] - Oscar's older brother. Oscar has always been in his brothers shadow. He was often ignored by his family while Bobby got all the love and affection that a child needs growing up. Despite this, Bobby and Oscar themselves appear to be pretty close. Bobby often helps Oscar out with his business (like providing the music when he was going to pitch his latest snack creation).

==Trivia==
*Oscar looks identical to his late father, [[Percy Proud]].
*Penny, Trudy, Oscar, Suga Mama, Dijonay, BeBe, and CeCe are the only characters to appear in all episodes.
*When paired with [[Felix Boulevardez]], their names are a reference to Oscar and Felix from the play turned movie and television show ''The Odd Couple''. Ironically, the Oscar and Felix there were known for being total opposites while the Oscar and Felix in ''The Proud Family'' are very much alike.
*Despite being a married man, Oscar frequently hits on women other than his wife. He does love Trudy dearly but tends to do this as Trudy's bossy attitudes tends to make him rather irritated. This habit is unusual for a children's show, this implies that he attempts to commit adultery, even though he never would come around to actually doing it.
*Oscar gets into a lot of trouble, mostly indirectly and the tastes of his snacks, and sometimes he would just get beat up for no reason.
*In ''Louder and Prouder'', Oscar's voice is noticeably deeper and raspier.
*In the ''Louder and Prouder'' episode "Father Figures", Oscar is shown to be homophobic. Despite this, he approves of Penny's friendship with Michael even with full knowledge that the latter is gay.
*In "[[Old Towne Road]]", he reveals that he is not a fan of the song "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X.
