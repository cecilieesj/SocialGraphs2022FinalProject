He was a pipe-fitter who was one of a group of people called the Undergrounders, who were stuck living in the underground caverns beneath [[Danville]], which they named Subterranis per his suggestion. Scott developed a quirky personality, frequently declaring anyone he encountered to "be their leader". Although [[Milo Murphy]] and his friends would help the Undergrounders return to the surface world, Scott chose to stay in Subterranis. He has since made various cameos in later episodes.
