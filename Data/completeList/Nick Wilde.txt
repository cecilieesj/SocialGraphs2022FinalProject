{{Quote|Never let them see that they get to you.|Nick Wilde to [[Judy Hopps]]}}
'''Nick Wilde''' is the deuteragonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2016]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''. He is a con-artist fox in the city of [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] who finds himself compelled to aid Officer [[Judy Hopps]], a rabbit, in her investigation. Despite their differences, Nick forms a friendship with Judy, who helps him realize he can be more than his stereotype. Nick makes good on this lesson by becoming a police officer and Judy's partner.

==Background==
Nick came from a poor background living with his mother (his father is never seen or mentioned). As a child, Nick had a dream of joining the local Junior Ranger Scouts, for the goal of receiving genuine acceptance. When he was eight or nine years old, his mother scraped up enough money to buy a brand new scout uniform, allowing him the opportunity to join the division. Though he was the only predator there, Nick attended his initiation with confidence and zeal, but unknowingly walked into a trap. The "initiation" turned out to be a cruel prank and Nick was ridiculed, shoved to the ground and muzzled by the other scouts for being a fox (as foxes are considered among the vilest and most untrustworthy species of mammals in the Zootopia world). After running outside to escape his tormentors, Nick broke down in tears, developing a triggering fear of muzzles and dislike towards prey and specist mammals. From that moment forward, Nick vowed to never expose his true vulnerability to others, resulting in the fox presenting himself as stoic and unflappable.

As another result of this experience, Nick declared that if the world viewed foxes as nothing more than vile and untrustworthy scoundrels, he should not only accept it but embrace it, subsequently doing so by becoming a successful con artist. During his teenage years, Nick was sent to juvenile detention, where he met a quick-tempered fennec fox named [[Finnick]]. Though the two were initially rival con-artists, they became best friends and business partners at adulthood.<ref name="Nick">[[:File:Nick and Finnick backstory book.jpg|Nick and Finnick backstory]]</ref>

At some point during his status as a con artist, Nick fell in with [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]], a feared arctic shrew crime boss, developing a stable partnership with him. Mr. Big liked and trusted the fox, welcoming him into his home and even introducing him to his beloved grandmother, whose cannoli they dined on when Mr. Big allowed Nick to stay for dinner. However, Nick later took advantage of Big's trust by selling him a very expensive wool rug secretly made from the fur of a skunk's rear end. Feeling betrayed and disrespected, Mr. Big turned Nick away, threatening to kill him if they ever met again.

By the start of the film, Nick appears to be well-off, claiming to have made $200 on a daily basis since the age of twelve (though the accuracy of these claims is questionable). He often works and splits the day's earnings with Finnick.

===Official Description===
:''Nick Wilde is a charming, small-time, con artist fox with a big mouth and a lot of opinions. But when a rabbit cop outsmarts him, he finds himself actually helping her solve a mystery.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://movies.disney.com/zootopia|title=Zootopia|date=October 25, 2015|publisher=Disney|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

===Development===
When the story was first pitched, Nick served as the film's protagonist. He was a savvy, wanted fox on a mission to clear his name, with no-nonsense Lieutenant Judy Hopps assisting him in achieving this goal.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Keegan, Rebecca|date=August 9, 2013|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-d23-disney-animated-feature-zootopia-20130808-story.html|title=A fast-talking fox is framed for a crime he didn't commit in Walt Disney Animation Studios' "Zootopia" due in theaters in 2016|accessdate=March 10, 2016|website=LA Times}}</ref> Much like his role in the film, Nick was every bit as sarcastic and cynical, with a strong dislike towards the city of Zootopia, which was more of a dystopian society, with direct abuse and cruelty against predators. This would eventually lead to the story facing major overhaul late in production, as the filmmakers felt the tale of optimistic Judy Hopps, a starry-eyed bunny with ambitions to achieve her dreams in what she believes to be a wondrous city, Zootopia, would make for a more compelling story in terms of tying it into the overall message of bias and preconceived notions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-disney-fixed-a-huge-mistake-with-zootopia-just-one-1753845684|website=io9|title=How Disney Fixed a Huge Mistake With Zootopia, Just One Year Before Release|date=January 20, 2016|author=Lussier, Germain|accessdate=March 10, 2016}}</ref>

Nick was characterized slightly differently, as evidenced by his appearance. Several pieces of art show Nick as being classy and well-dressed, sporting a blackish blue suit<ref>[[Nick Wilde/Gallery#Concept Art|Zootopia Concept Art gallery]]</ref> while the character [[Clawhauser]] wore the green Hawaiian shirt Nick wears in the film. Over time, Nick would be given the Hawaiian shirt,<ref name="Clawhauser">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/653670531204386816|title=That time when Clawhauser was named Hugo & was wearing Nick's shirt.

A key story element in the early stages of the film centered around predators being forced to wear electric shock collars, as a means to keep their "aggressive nature" under control. Nick was one of the victims of this cruelty, and it was Judy who would eventually grant Nick his freedom, as a symbol of trust, while learning predators are not as dangerous as they may seem.<ref>''The Art of Zootopia''</ref> This directly tied into another major story element scrapped from the film, in which Nick was the owner of an illegal, indoor amusement park called "[[Wild Times]]". With the entrance disguised as a medical clinic, Wild Times was a park built by Nick for predators‚Äîthen known as "chompers"‚Äîwhere they were allowed to remove their collars and enjoy freely being themselves.<ref name="Blog">Lechner, Matthias."[http://www.matthiaslechner.com/zootopia.html ZOOTOPIA]." (Blog). Retrieved March 21, 2016.</ref> This version of the story delved deeper into Nick's backstory. As a child, he was primarily seen with his hapless, but always loving father, who dreamt of starting a family business with Nick. He was also shown to have been friends with Finnick since childhood, as the two were in the same elementary class. Despite the development, the filmmakers felt the deeper Nick's past was explored, the darker the film became, which further influenced the story's eventual revision.<ref name="Imagining">''Imagining Zootopia'' (April 3, 2016). Documentary.</ref>

===Personality===
Nick is generally charismatic, sociable, street-smart, wise-cracking, and highly cunning. A shifty, sly, and mischievous fox, traits supposedly common to all foxes, Nick is easygoing and slick, easily conning, and tricking others through his charm and friendly demeanor for money. He nearly always has a sly smile on his face and seems unfazed throughout most of the events.

Due to his troubled history, Nick grew to be cynical, devious, and prejudiced himself, and due to the events, he developed a fear of muzzles and a dislike towards the prey. Unlike Judy, he viewed the world of Zootopia as an abysmal place, where dreams are nothing more than far-off fantasies, and those who strive to become something more than they're stereotyped to be are simply wasting their time and energy. Nevertheless, he kept a somewhat positive aura by embracing and exploring his strong points, which were his wits, intelligence, and ability to con practically everyone he came across. He also maintained a strong sense of humor, as he often uses wisecracks as a coping mechanism when found in a troublesome situation. As a result of his past, Nick grew to be uncaring towards the opinions of other mammals, no matter how cruel, giving him a sense of strength and independence. These traits would ultimately play a crucial role in solving Zootopia's deadliest conspiracy and would lead Nick to understand that it is possible to become something more than you're stereotyped to be.

Though he appeared to be uncaring to those around him, Nick was sympathetic towards those who experience prejudice, as he did in the past. Witnessing firsthand the trials and tribulations that Judy was wrongfully forced to endure while fighting to prove her worth on the [[Zootopia Police Department|police force]], Nick became a firm supporter to the bunny, subsequently proving himself to be quite fearless and protective when it comes to those he cared about.

However, Nick's affection for Judy would also act as his weakness, bringing about his vulnerability and rendering him capable of becoming strongly affected by the viewpoints of someone else. He is quite resentful towards those he held a personal trust towards, particularly the ones he personally believed to have accepted him. Said anger was present when Judy publicly stated the feral disease to be due to the predators' biology, which caused Nick to feel betrayed towards their friendship when she had essentially reinforced the prejudice of predators, foxes included. Even so, his laid-back nature makes him a quick forgiver, as his care for others ultimately overrides his occasional bitterness.

Ultimately, thanks to his positive experiences with Judy, by the end of the film, he manages to regain a lot of the optimism he had as a child and no longer saw Zootopia in an unambiguously negative light, especially after, similarly to Judy, he manages to become the first fox to become a police officer as a result of helping her solve the case, since thanks to his first-hand experience, he now saw that it was possible to be more than what prejudiced individuals think you're capable of being and find those that see and appreciate you for who you truly are. Despite his attitude softening considerably and being more openly nice to others, he still maintained his sharp wit, and was prone to making both sarcastic remarks and engaging in banter with Judy, such as quipping if all bunnies were bad drivers or if it was just her while they're on a stakeout. The big difference from before was that now he was only doing it as playful teasing since at this point, the two of them have gained a lot of respect for each other and their respective species. 

As collected as he appears to be, Nick doesn't handle intense situations particularly well compared to Judy (who to be fair, is a trained officer), who generally maintains her composure and takes charge of situations when things go haywire. In contrast to this, Nick often goes into an immediate panic when in danger, becoming anxious, cowering in fear, and pessimistically jumping to the conclusion that he'll soon meet his demise, seen several times throughout the Otterton case. Nevertheless, he was unwilling to abandon Judy in these situations, against her wishes, and even before their relationship matured; this would hint at Nick's selflessness before his true nature was revealed to Judy.

Nick has a fondness for coffee as he was seen drinking one after Mayor Lionheart's arrest. He also shows a liking towards blueberries when he ate some that Judy got from her family's farm, commenting on how tasty they are.

===Physical appearance===
Nick is a fox with a slim build. He's covered in red-orange fur with a cream underbelly up to his muzzle. He has dark auburn fur on his feet, his hands, the tips of his ears, and at the tip of his tail. He has green eyes and a dark purple nose.

Nick professionally wears a light green Hawaiian shirt, a dark indigo necktie with red-and-blue stripes, and a pair of khaki pants. While helping Judy during her investigation, he wears a junior ZPD badge sticker over the pocket of his shirt, originally a gift from Judy for Finnick before the latter humorously passed it onto Nick. The sticker is removed after Judy's press conference when Nick feels hurt by her.

After Nick graduated into a police officer, his fox-size uniform is navy blue with sleeves, a peaked cap, a high collar, and pants with a gold aiguillette and the ZPD insignia on his shoulders, along with having a black tie and a utility belt filled with various paraphernalia. He's also shown wearing police sunglasses.

===Abilities===
*'''Fox Physiology:''' Nick is an anthropomorphic fox.
**'''Animal Smell:''' Nick has an excellent sense of smell.
**'''Night Vision:''' As foxes are nocturnal, Nick can see in the dark.
*'''Anthropomorphism:''' Along with all animals in a world without humans, Nick evolved to the point he walks on his back legs, uses human resources like technology, and partakes in human-related activities.
**'''High Intellect:''' Nick is highly intelligent and cunning. Nick uses his wits to survive in the streets of Zootopia, however, he can be outsmarted as proven by Judy. Nevertheless, Judy Hopps herself truly admit that Nick is her "key witness", meaning without Nick Wilde, she will most likely fail her mission.
***'''Master of Deception:''' Nick lives up to being a "sly fox", using his charms and friendly demeanor to trick others. This first appeared when Nick pretended to be a father for a fennec fox which led Judy into buying him a Jumbo-pop. He also outsmarted Bellwether by replacing the night howler pellets with blueberries and pretended to be savage once he was shot by them.
***'''Business Savvy:''' Nick was a con artist who conned others for money. Nick also has permits to transport and sell goods, even using clever wordplay to avoid false advertising.
*'''Street Smarts:''' Growing up in the streets of Zootopia, Nick developed wits to survive in the city. This proved to be useful, as Nick was able to find out where Manchas was taken when the wolves took a secret passageway through the tunnels which lead to the Cliffside Asylum.

==Appearances==
===''[[Zootopia]]''===
[[File:Zootopia Nick's Popsicles.png|thumb|left|250px|Nick selling "pawpsicles" as part of his latest scheme.]]
On an average day, Nick and [[Finnick]] were in the midst of their latest scheme. He is first seen snooping about [[Savanna Central]], and eventually entering [[Jumbeaux's Caf√©]], unknowingly being followed by Officer [[Judy Hopps]], a rookie of the Zootopia Police Department, as she believed that Nick, being a fox, is up to no good. Inside the caf√©, Nick is denied service due to his species, though Nick claims he means no harm, and is simply looking to buy a [[Jumbo-pop]] as a birthday present for his son (Finnick, disguised as a toddler). The shop owner, [[Jerry Jumbeaux Jr.]], refuses again, prompting Judy to intervene. She does so by threatening to shut down Jerry's establishment for health code violations, and out of fear, Jerry complies with Judy's demands by allowing Nick to buy the pop. With his luck running strongly, Nick furthers his scheme by claiming to have left his wallet at home, prompting Judy to pay out of sympathy. Nick then thanks Judy for her services, before he and Finnick leave the scene.

They head to [[Sahara Square]] to further their plot, which is revealed to be an elaborate scheme in which he and Finnick meltdown the Jumbo-pop to create dozens of miniature pops ([[pawpsicle]]s), selling them to lemmings at less than the original price, and recycling the popsicles' sticks to sell to mice for construction in [[Little Rodentia]]. After the work for the day is complete, Nick and Finnick split the profits and part ways, just before Judy reveals to have witnessed their entire scheme unfold, feeling foolish for having fallen for Nick's trickery. Out of anger, Judy threatens to arrest Nick, but the fox retorts by claiming he's done nothing illegal, having all of the required permits and paperwork in check to allow such schemes to take place. He subsequently berates Judy on her failure as a police officer and giving her the "reality check" that Zootopia is not a utopia where anyone can be anything, but a dystopia where you are only what stereotypes say you are, and nothing will change that. Finally, to add insult to injury, he tricked her into stepping in wet cement.

[[File:Unless you can help me solve this case.png|thumb|250px|Nick finds himself under the legal authority of Judy Hopps.]]
These words strike Judy, and the following day, she becomes determined to prove herself, as her boss, [[Chief Bogo]], also has negative feelings towards a bunny cop. She receives the opportunity when she volunteers to help solve the missing mammals case of [[Mr. Otterton|Emmitt Otterton]], though Bogo only allows her 48 hours to do so, or face resignation. After investigating, Judy finds that Nick was one of the last who saw Otterton, and labels him as a key witness. She finds both Nick and Finnick in the midst of another scam, and asks for information on Otterton's whereabouts, due that Nick sold him a pawpsicle shortly before his disappearance. When Nick refuses to help, Judy threatens to arrest the former for felony tax evasion, which she hustles him into admitting to having committed, using her [[Carrot Pen|carrot pen with a voice recording function]] to do so.

With his luck run out (along with Finnick teasing him by the way Judy hustled him), Nick begrudgingly joins Judy's mission, hoping to retrieve and dispose of the carrot recorder once their job is complete. He confesses that he only knows where Otterton went following their interaction, but neglects to inform Judy that the location is a naturist club, wanting to make her as uncomfortable as possible, as a means to exact revenge for her trickery. At the club, Judy, despite being horrified by the nude animals, manages to push through and gain information‚Äîthe license plate of the car Otterton was last seen in‚Äîfrom the club's owner, [[Yax]]. However, being that she is not yet in the city's system, Judy uses Nick to run the plate, claiming she'll release his bind once her case is over in a matter of hours. Nick once again retaliates by taking Judy to the DMV run by sloths, where his friend [[Flash]] takes the majority of the rest of the day running the plate, according to plan.

[[File:Zootopia-42.png|thumb|left|250px|A nearly fatal encounter with Mr. Big.]]
They find the car to be in [[Tundratown]], though the lot is closed for the day by that point. When confronted about his schemes and wasting the day on purpose, Nick admits that he believes Judy's investigation to be a joke, claiming it should be a "real cop" searching for Otterton in her place. He then notes that Judy must back down as she doesn't have a police warrant to enter the closed premises, meaning their partnership is over. However, Judy throws the recorder over the fence, making Nick rush to get it, thus violating trespassing laws. This legally allows Judy to enter under "probable cause" (by digging a hole under the fence), and she successfully retrieves the pen before Nick, thus leaving her in charge once more. As the two search through the car, Nick realizes that it belongs to [[Mr. Big (Zootopia)|Mr. Big]], the most feared crime boss in Tundratown, who has a grudge against him for a business transaction gone wrong. Nick attempts to escape, only to find himself and Judy captured by Mr. Big's polar bear henchmen. They are taken to the crime boss' mansion, where Judy interrogates the arctic shrew, accusing him of being a suspect in Mr. Otterton's disappearance. In response to this and Nick, Mr. Big orders to have the two frozen to death, only to have a change in heart when his daughter, [[Fru Fru]], arrives and explains that Judy saved her life earlier. Mr. Big allows the two to live, and invites them to Fru Fru's wedding as honored guests. There, Mr. Big gives information on Otterton's disappearance, advising that Nick and Judy travel to the [[Rainforest District]] to question [[Mr. Manchas]], the last person to have seen Otterton.

[[File:Nick and Bogo Zootopia.jpg|thumb|250px|With his patience thin, Nick scolds Bogo for his ill treatment towards Judy.]]
When they find Manchas, he is in a state of deep fear, feeling reluctant to allow Nick and Judy inside, though he reveals the events of Otterton's disappearance, explaining that he went savage and attacked him, exclaiming something incoherent regarding the "[[night howlers]]". Nick cleverly convinces Manchas to allow himself and Judy inside, to which the latter complies, but before they can undergo further questioning, Manchas suddenly loses his sanity and becomes savage himself. Nick and Judy flee and are fiercely pursued by Manchas. Judy manages to evade the jaguar, but Nick is left cornered near a drop-off. Manchas lunges to kill Nick, but Judy chains the jaguar's ankle to a post, saving Nick's life; much to his surprise. Chief Bogo and his police force later arrive onto the scene, only to find that Manchas is nowhere to be found. Bogo accuses Judy of failure, and requests her badge, revealing to Nick that she was pressured to solve the case in a mere two days or face resignation. Angered by the unfair treatment, Nick steps in to defend Judy, calling out Bogo's bigotry and noting that she still has ten hours left to solve the case. This forces Bogo to stand down, and from this point, Nick establishes himself as Judy's supportive ally, now with the knowledge that his enlistment was out of desperation, rather than spite.

[[File:Muzzled Nick.png|thumb|left|250px|A flashback depicting Nick's past.]]
Nick and Judy take their leave on a cable car, and after a moment of silence, Judy thanks Nick for his compassion. Nick responds by revealing his traumatic childhood experience that would lead to his stoic nature, conning lifestyle, and sympathy towards the oppressed and underestimated, in turn providing Judy with a better understanding of his previously harsh attitude. He immediately regrets doing this, as he broke his vow to keep his vulnerability under wraps; he makes an attempt to change the subject, but Judy merely comforts him on the matter, thanking him for sharing his story. Nick doesn't acknowledge her words, as he suddenly gets the idea to uncover what happened to Manchas by using the city's traffic camera systems, which are plugged into just about every area in each district.

Later that morning, they visit [[Bellwether]], the assistant to [[Mayor Lionheart]], who grants them access to the city's traffic cams. They discover that Manchas was captured by wolves (which Judy assumes is what Manchas meant by "night howlers"), and Nick cunningly tracks their path through hidden roads to an abandoned hospital outside of town called Cliffside. Judy, impressed by Nick's actions, congratulates the fox and notes that he has the potential of being a valuable addition to the ZPD, though he playfully brushes this off. Once the two head out, they eventually find the asylum to be heavily guarded by wolves and filled with imprisoned predators who have fallen under the mysterious "savage" affliction. The operation is revealed to be run by Mayor Lionheart, who Nick and Judy eavesdrop on, learning that he wants to keep the imprisoned predators a secret to prevent public panic, and by extension, the loss of his position. When discovered, Nick and Judy escape and report their findings to Bogo, who arrives with his police forces and arrests Mayor Lionheart.

[[File:Judy reaches for fox repellent .jpg|thumb|250px|Judy's near-use of the fox repellant confirms her bigotry to Nick.]]
Following these events, Judy is hailed a hero, and a press conference is held in regard to the situation. Nick advises a nervous Judy to remain calm, and moments before it's time for her to speak to the press, Judy offers Nick a position on the police force as her partner. Nick, touched that someone sees something beyond his species, takes it into consideration, and proudly looks on as she speaks about her latest victory. When asked why the predators have gone savage, however, Judy, at a loss for answers, suggests that it may have something to do with "biology", which is taken as a serious sign that predators are reverting back to their ruthlessly primitive and aggressive ways. A hurt Nick takes extreme offense by this, feeling Judy, someone he has grown to trust, has done nothing but labeled all predators as "savages" which, in technicality, she did. While confronting Judy on the matter and going as far as to ask her if she thought he would try to eat her, Judy starts to feel threatened and actually started to reach for her fox repellent, confirming that she, too, sees Nick as a potential savage, much like the rest of the world. A betrayed Nick then leaves the department, returning the application and declining Judy's offer to join the force, thinking that Judy doesn't want a "predator" for a partner. When Judy takes a look at the application, she finds that it was filled out entirely. Judy tries to catch up with Nick, but the press blocks her way and asked her if she was threatened by him.

[[File:Nick and Judy reunite.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Nick and Judy's heartfelt reconciliation.]]
Following these events, Nick returns to his normal life in the streets, reuniting with Finnick and finding himself lounging about in solitude in his spare time. Three months after the press conference,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/729031671933075456|title=Hi Julie! üëã From press conference to making up it was about 2.5-3 months. üê∞‚õàüê∫|website=Twitter|author=Moore, Rich|date=May 7, 2016|format=Tweet|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> Judy suddenly returns and with a breakthrough in the case, needing Nick's help to solve it and save the city. Nick declines, which prompts Judy to confess how foolish she's been, and how regretful she is for causing so much trouble for innocent predators while, most importantly, betraying Nick in the process and even calls herself a dumb bunny. Knowing her words are genuine, Nick forgives Judy, teasingly recording her confession on her carrot recorder, which he has held onto. The two share a warm embrace to further solidify their reunion, and with the case back on track, Nick and Judy take their leave to follow the night howlers, which Judy has discovered are actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals.

They track down [[Duke Weaselton]] for information. Duke had stolen "moldy onions" on Judy's second day at work; they were actually night howler buds. When Duke refuses to cooperate, the pair brings him before Mr. Big, who threatens to ice the weasel unless he tells them what they wanted to know. Duke reveals that the flowers were sold to a ram named [[Doug (Zootopia)|Doug]], who operates a secret lab hidden in the subway tunnels. Nick and Judy find Doug and learn that the flowers are being used to create a serum which he has been injecting into predators via a dart gun, turning them savage. Judy hijacks the lab (which is on a still-functional train) and tries to take the evidence to Bogo. Doug's assistants, Woolter and Jesse pursue, and though they are defeated, the train is derailed and destroyed.

[[File:Savage Nick .jpg|thumb|250px|A supposedly savage Nick closing in on Judy.]]
Nick, fortunately, reveals to have saved the evidence containing the dart gun and its night howler toxin pellet, and the two make way to Bogo through the history museum. There, they encounter Bellwether, who is revealed to be the true mastermind behind the villainous operation. She sends her henchrams to capture Nick and Judy, and though they make a break for it with the evidence in hand, Judy is injured in the process. Nick refuses to leave her and tries to carry her to safety, only to be thrown into a pit-like exhibit by the sheep. There, Bellwether regains the dart gun and shoots Nick with it so that he will become feral and kill Judy. Bellwether subsequently calls Bogo to make it all look like another "savage attack", but both Judy and Nick reveal to have gotten the best of Bellwether, as the drug pellet was actually just a blueberry, which they switched before Bellwether could regain the gun. With Bellwether's confession of criminal activity recorded on the carrot pen, Bogo and his force arrive and arrest her and her goons.

[[File:Officer Nick Wilde.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Officer Nick Wilde, during his graduation ceremony.]]
In the end, Judy is reinstated as a member of the Zootopia Police Department. Nick, with a change of heart towards his life, joins as well, becoming the first fox officer. At Nick's police graduation ceremony, Judy herself gives Nick his Z.P.D. badge, exchanges salutes with him as an official welcoming into the force, and subsequently takes him on as her partner. The epilogue shows that Nick has become a welcomed member of the force, and even a liked companion of Chief Bogo, who gives both Nick and Judy the task of tracking down a street racer as their first assignment (though not before jokingly regulating them to parking duty). While staking out, the relationship between Nick and Judy is shown to be stronger than ever, with Nick getting Judy to admit that she loves him; sentiments he returns with a warm smile. Eventually, their perp zooms by who, ironically, reveals himself to be Flash, much to Nick's surprise and amusement.

==Trivia==
*Nick's last name, Wilde, is a play on the word "wild", given the fact that most foxes are wild animals.
*His middle name "Piberius" is adapted from James Tiberius Kirk, ''Star Trek''<nowiki/>'s main character.
*His actor, [[Jason Bateman]], finished recording his voiceover work on [[September 16]], [[2015]].
*In earlier drafts of the story, Nick and Finnick worked at a fast food restaurant in [[Little Rodentia]] called Chez Cheese.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Julius, J., Lasseter, J., Howard, B., & Moore, R.|date=2016|title=The Art of Zootopia|publisher=Chronicle Books|pages=85}}</ref> Another version had them working at a factory called Bug-Burga.<ref name="Imagining" />
*According to Nick's job application for the police force, he is 4&nbsp;ft (1.2 m) tall and weighs 80&nbsp;lbs (36&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Application" />
*Nick's tax forms show some of his personal information:<ref>[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/9/98/Zootopia_Nick%27s_Tax_form.png/revision/latest?cb=20160519215147 File:Zootopia Nick's Tax form.png]</ref>
**His "benefits number" is [tel:555-16-2234 555-16-2234].
**His legal address is 1955 Cypress Grove Lane.
***The number [[1955]] refers to the year [[Disneyland]] was opened.
**He was committing tax evasion as his records were all zeros, despite earning income through his cons and scams.
*The pattern of Nick's shirt is nigh-identical to the wallpaper in the hallway of his childhood home.
*Since real-life red foxes are nocturnal and being in direct sunlight could damage their eyesight, Nick has a pair of sunglasses.
*Ironically, the original protagonist for ''Zootopia'' was going to be a jackrabbit spy named Jack Savage. To avoid confusion with the ''[[Gigantic]]'' character with a similar name, Jack Savage was changed to Nick,<ref>"[https://www.facebook.com/Disney/videos/10153524916315954/ 'Rich Moore and Byron Howard Q&A' on Facebook]". (March 17, 2016). ''Facebook''. Retrieved March 18, 2016.</ref> and subsequently Judy.
*Along with Finnick, Nick was also friends with [[Clawhauser]] and a [[Dr. Badger|badger]] character.<ref name="Blog" /><ref>AtGoogleTalks (March 4, 2016)."[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuLbuR1afNQ Disney's "Zootopia"|Talks at Google]". (Video) ''YouTube''. Retrieved March 21, 2016.</ref> In the final film, neither Clawhauser nor the badger associate with Nick.
*Several pieces of concept art label Nick's father as "John Wilde". In the final version of the film, Nick's father is never mentioned, so his canonical name is unknown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/719219524797624320|title=@silverknyght In one of Matthias Lechner's dev art it was. But we are undecided right now.|website=Twitter|author=Howard, Byron|date=April 10, 2016|format=Tweet|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}</ref>
*On Nick's filled out ZPD application form, at the bottom, one question asks if he's been arrested or charged in the past. It's seen that he checked "Yes", but then scribbled it out and checked "No" instead and in bold. Given Nick's past, it's highly likely that he indeed got in trouble with the ZPD at some point. It seems that whatever legal troubles he may have had in the past, they weren't notable enough to prevent him from becoming an official police officer.
*During renovations of the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] building, beginning in [[2014]], Nick was one of the character silhouettes featured on the wall mural.
*Nick and Flash went to high school together, and were both members of the track team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/722628441946763264|title=Nick did go to high school.

*In one version of the story, Nick's residence was a leaky basement apartment in the [[Rainforest District]].<ref name="Blog" />
*The handkerchief that Nick uses to patch Judy's leg wound during the climax is the same neckerchief that was part of his Ranger Scout uniform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/723728264343080961|title=GOOD üëÅ!!! It most certainly is!! üëèüëèüëè (reply to @_rich_moore is the handkerchief Nick uses at the end of the movie the same one from his old junior ranger scout uniform?)|website=Twitter|author=Moore Rich|date=April 22, 2016|format=Tweet|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>
*Nick seems to suffer from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) or a Panic Disorder triggered by muzzles. This is seen at Judy's press conference when he looks at the pictures of the savage predators being muzzled; he is visibly horrified at the sight and promptly has a flashback to his traumatic childhood event when he was muzzled.
*According to ''Zootopia: The Essential Guide'', Nick's top three secrets are:
*#Secretly wants to be seen as more than a sly fox.
*#Wanted to be a Zootopia Junior Ranger when he was young.
*#Bullied by mean prey kids as a cub.
*Nick seems to have knowledge in first aid, as he was seen patching Judy's leg wound by using a neckerchief.
*Nick's handwriting resembles [[Walt Disney]]'s.
*Nick has a top speed of approximately 100&nbsp;mph, shown in the scene where he gets Judy to look the other way, and then is shown at a much farther distance.
*There are clues that indicate Nick wasn't hit by the night howler serum and instead by blueberries:
*#When Nick was hit, a visible splat is seen and stays there. The night howler serum is absorbed into the skin without residue.
*#Nick's eyes remain the same, unlike afflicted animals whose eyes become like that of their real-life counterparts.
*Nick is implied to be 32 years old in the film during his accidental confession of his tax evasion. He stated to have started when he was 12, to which Judy then multiplies his income per year by 20.
