'''Little Brother''' is the dog of [[Fa Mulan]] and a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1998]] animated feature film, ''[[Mulan]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Mulan]]''===
In the first movie, Little Brother was [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]]'s dog that helped her out with the chores. In a rather weird way, he would get them done. He also disturbs [[Fa Zhou|Mulan's father]], who was praying. During the end of the movie, he joined Mulan's ancestors' ghosts at the party along with the chickens.

===''[[Mulan II]]''===
In the second movie, Little Brother watches Mulan training in the field. As [[Lesson Number One|a musical number]] is played, Little Brother plays with the little girls as they learn how to fight.

===Other appearances===
Little Brother makes a small cameo in ''[[Tarzan]]'' when several gorillas gather around [[Archimedes Q. Porter]] and shake him upside down, causing many items to fall from inside his pockets, one of them resembling Little Brother.

==Trivia==
*Little Brother's voice actor, [[Chris Sanders]], also voiced [[Stitch]] in the ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' franchise.
*Little Brother is the third dog to be owned by a [[Disney Princess]], with [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s dog [[Bruno (Cinderella)|Bruno]] being the first and [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]' dog [[Percy (Pocahontas)|Percy]] (in [[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World|the sequel]]) being the second.
*The name "Little Brother" is possibly a reference to Mulan having a little brother in the original ''Ballad of Mulan''. Aptly enough, Mulan may have named her dog this because she considers him her adoptive "brother."
* Although Little Brother never appeared in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|2020 remake]], the scene where a young Mulan chases a chicken across the village pays homage to the scene where Mulan tells Little Brother to feed the chickens across the village.
