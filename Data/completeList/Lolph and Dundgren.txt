'''Lolph and Dundgren''' are Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron operatives from the year 207̃012. These two work for the [[Time Baby]]. They are heavily implied to be the Squadron's top agents.

== History ==

=== Season 1 ===
In "[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]", shortly after [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] arrive back in the present after their time-traveling adventure, Lolph and Dundgren come to the site to arrest [[Blendin Blandin]], who is charged with the twins' "violations of the time travelers' code of conduct." Blendin tries to explain the situation as the agents drag him away, but they do not believe him, especially after he tries to convince them that Mabel's pig is their leader. After [[Stan Pines|Stan]] challenges Lolph to try and dunk him, Lolph blasts the dunk tank with his laser arm cannon, successfully knocking Stan down in the process. The agents then return to their own time with Blendin and hand him over to the [[Time Baby]].

=== Season 2 ===
In "[[Blendin's Game]]", Lolph and Dundgren were in charge of bringing Blendin in after he escaped from the Infinetentiary. However, upon being caught, Blendin invokes Globnar and selects Dipper and Mabel as his opponents. The pair are then ordered to bring Dipper and Mabel to the Globnar arena, but the twins manage to escape to the past when Mabel tricks Lolph into thinking that she was one of his ancestors. Escorting a restrained Blendin, they follow the pair back in time to ten years before their time of origin, and hunt them through Gravity Falls until the Pines turn themselves in.

In "[[The Last Mabelcorn]]", a picture of them from "Blendin's Game" is shown as Bill mentioned picking his next pawn.

In "[[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]", Lolph and many other members of the Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron, are vaporized by [[Bill Cipher]] when trying to stop him from destroying space and time, leaving Blendin the only one left

== Trivia ==
* <span>Despite his apparent death, however in the Gravity Falls: </span>''Journal 3''<span> it was revealed that the Squadron used holograms of themselves to confront Bill Cipher in the present, meaning the real Loph is still alive and well.</span>
