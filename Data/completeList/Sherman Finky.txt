'''Sherman Finky''', or simply '''Mr. Finky''', is a recurring character from the animated TV Series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the social studies teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] where [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] attends and has a habit of trying to be "hip" with the students.

==Background==
Sherman Finky is the social studies teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]]. He typically sends [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]], and occasionally [[Milo Kamalani]] and [[Nicky Little]], on the majority of their wacky misadventures due to the fact that his lessons revolve around trying to get his students to be more socially active. In "[[Peer Counselor P.A.]]", he gets Pepper Ann to try and listen to other students so that she can be more aware of their problems and in "[[Career Daze]]", he assigns Pepper Ann, Milo and Nicky to be a middle school principal, stock broker and butcher, respectively, as it was supposedly what their results indicated. He overall has a lot of faith in Pepper Ann, despite her misgivings, and actually shows genuine care for her and her friends.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Finky is still a teacher at the school, though he and the rest of the staff are disappointed in the fact that there is nothing significantly different about them after all these years.

===Personality===
Finky considers himself the "hip" teacher and thus is overly friendly and supportive to those around him. While not shown as much, it is implied that he is, ironically, not socially aware of the fact that people consider him something of a dork. He rarely gets angry, but has been shown to get irritated at times from the likes of Pepper Ann herself. 

===Physical appearance===
Finky is a tall Caucasian man with long brown hair that is balding on top. He wears glasses that he always has rested on his forehead, a tucked in short sleeved blue shirt with pocket, red necktie, black belt and slacks and red and white sneakers.

==Trivia==
*In an effort to be seen as cool and contemporary to his students, has a tendency to use words such as "fresh" and "fly". He also drives a motorcycle to school.
*He appears to have a crush on [[Carlotta Sneed]], though it is never reciprocated.
*In "[[Career Daze]]", he is sporting a rather obvious toupee, yet no one acknowledges it.
