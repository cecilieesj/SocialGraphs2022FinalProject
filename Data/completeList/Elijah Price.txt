===''[[Unbreakable]]''===
Born in 1960, Elijah Price was diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type I. He was bullied by people and was nicknamed "Mr. Glass". His mother gave him plenty of comic books to read. By 2000, Elijah Price became fascinated with comic books and plotted several terrorist attacks to find a superhero. They all had but one survivor. He met David Dunn, who works for security. Elijah convinces David and his son that David is a superhero. Once David touches Elijah, David learned that Elijah is the terrorist behind several incidents. Elijah was locked up for his delusional behavior.
===''[[Glass]]''===
16 years later, he was turned in to Dr. Ellie Staple, who tries to tell him, David Dunn and a new supervillain, Kevin Crumb that they are living delusions of grandeur. Joseph told David that Elijah killed Kevin Crumb's father at the train crash, making Elijah both the creator of a superhero and a villain. He was badly wounded by Kevin after he learned about his father's loss.
