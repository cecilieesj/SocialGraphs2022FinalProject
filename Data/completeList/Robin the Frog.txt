'''Robin the Frog''' is a small Muppet frog. He is [[Kermit the Frog]]'s nephew. He debuted in the [[1971]] TV special ''[[w:c:muppet:The Frog Prince|The Frog Prince]]'' and has appeared in almost all Muppet productions since ''{{WikipediaLink|The Muppet Show}}'' (but is notably absent in ''Muppets Tonight''). One of Robin's most famous moments was singing "[[w:c:muppet:Halfway Down the Stairs|Halfway Down the Stairs]]", a song based on a poem by [[Winnie the Pooh]] creator A.A. Milne. He also has an important role in [[w:c:muppet:Episode 212: Bernadette Peters|episode 212]] of ''The Muppet Show'', when he was feeling sad for being so small until the guest star [[Bernadette Peters]] and all of Robin's Muppet friends sing the song "[[w:c:muppet:Just One Person|Just One Person]]" to cheer him up. He loves to spend time with his Uncle Kermit.

According to the ''{{WikipediaLink|Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies}}'' episode "[[w:c:muppet:Episode 109: Close Encounters of the Frog Kind|Close Encounters of the Frog Kind]]", his mother is Kermit's older sister.
