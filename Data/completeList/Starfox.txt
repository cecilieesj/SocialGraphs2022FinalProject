'''Starfox''' (real name '''Eros''') is a superhero from [[Marvel Comics]] and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. He first appeared  in the post-credit scene of ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'' and is the adoptive younger brother of the supervillain [[Thanos]]. He is also the adoptive uncle of [[Gamora]], [[Nebula]], and the [[Black Order]].

Starfox was created by Mike Friedrich, Jim Starlin, Mike Esposito and Joe Sinott.

==Background==
Eros, like all other Eternals, was created millions of years ago, by leader of the Celestials Arishem the Judge. Sometime after his creation, he was sent to the distant planet of [[Titans|Titan]], homeworld of the Titans, a highly evolved race of tall humanoid beings with incredible strength and lifespans lasting millennia. 

Eros met and was adopted by A'lars, one of the leading members of Titan's leadership, becoming the adoptive older brother Thanos. Eventually, he defied Arishem and left both Titan and his family behind, instead deciding to travel the cosmos as an explorer and superhero under the new name of Starfox.

Sometime following his departure from Titan, the planet was left virtually uninhabitable, due to civil war and resource exhaustion caused by the sheer overpopulation of its intelligent population. This left Starfox and his brother Thanos, who was also off world at the time after being exiled for his suggestion of culling half the planet's population to avert the disaster, as the sole survivors of Titan, with Thanos being the last of the Titans. Sometime during his travels, Starfox created Pip Gofern, also known as Pip the Troll to be his life-long companion. Pip joined Starfox on his journeys, becoming his best friend, companion, and majordomo. During one of their adventures together, Starfox fought a mighty adversary called Black Roger, whom he killed in a mighty battle.

===Personality===
Starfox seems to be the opposite of his adoptive brother. While Thanos was philosophical, serious, scientific, and amoral, Starfox is hedonistic, fun loving, jovial, lighthearted, and adventurous. 

His powerful craving for adventure causes him to be exceptionally brave. This could be seen when he was even willing to break the laws of his adoptive homeworld by fleeing to space, despite knowing that doing so would make him a criminal on Titan as well as becoming an enemy of his creators, the Celestials, the most powerful beings in the universe. Also unlike Thanos, who possessed a more to the point mentality, Eros seems to have a flair for the dramatics, enjoying flashy entrances. 

He is shown to have a very close friendship with his creation and sidekick Pip the Troll. He is also shown to be polite and cordial, besides be willing to help others. This is seen as he promised to aid Druig, Thena, and Makkari with helping find the other Eternals that were abducted by Arishem. 

==Appearances==
===''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]''===
Starfox makes his first appearance in the post-credits scene of the Eternals. In late 2023, Starfox and [[Pip the Troll|Pip]] learn of Arishem's abduction of the majority of the surviving Eternals on Earth, following their saving of the planet by preventing the Celestial Emergence. Starfox then has Pip transported to the Eternal starship ''Domo'' where Starfox makes his dramatic entrance as Pip lists his various epithets. Though the three remaining Eternals, Druig, Thena, and Makkari are suspicious of Starfox upon learning that he is Thanos's brother, they nonetheless decide to hear him out. Revealing that he has a Celestial Communication Sphere with him, he reveals to his fellow Eternals that he knows where their friends are being held and offers to to help them in finding and rescuing them from Arishem and the other Celestials in space

== Trivia ==
* In the original comics, Starfox was a member of the [[Avengers]] and is the biological rather than the adoptive brother of Thanos.
* In the comics, Starfox possesses the power to stimulate the pleasure centers of an intelligent being's brain. This made him a controversial figure among fans and critics at the time, since he would often use this power to make female characters fall in love with him, including the superheroine She-Hulk. This eventually led to him being removed from the Avengers and, for a time, being listed in any other Marvel issues.
*Like many of the other Eternals, Starfox's birth name is derived from Greek Mythology. In mythology, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros Eros] is the Greek god of love better known by his Roman name of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid Cupid]. This ties into Starfox's seduction power from the comics, since Eros is said to possess the ability to forcibly make mortals fall in love with one another with his magic arrows.
