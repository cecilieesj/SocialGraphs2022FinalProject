'''Kate Wetherall''' is the tritagonist in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. She is a very active girl who carries a bucket of tools and is very hands on with tasks.

==Background==

===Personality===
Kate is a very loud and athletic girl. She is the most adventurous and resourceful child in the group and seems to be more willing to confront issues head on as opposed to sitting back and waiting. While the other children have high intellect, she is more physically adapt, but she is very welcoming to their skills and is willing to work with and manage situations with others. 

Kate can be very headstrong and stubborn, and often relies on her bucket of tools a bit too much, to the point of distraction if she doesn't have it. Due to her previous abandonment, she often feels the need to prove to others and herself that she can handle things on her own. However, she soon grows close to the members of the Mysterious Benedict Society.  

Kate often wishes to follow "action hero" tropes, such as scaling a tower or naming a team after herself. It is unknown how much of that she would actually be able to pull off- while she is very young, she does also have circus training.  

===Physical appearance===
Kate has shoulder length dirty blonde hair that sticks out from under her green beanie, which she wears even in bed. She has a stripped shirt, jeans and sneakers and wears a yellow jacket with stars on it that she got from the circus.

===Abilities===
Kate is a physically active girl and is capable of performing acrobatic maneuvers and fit through narrow spaces. She carries a bucket with her that has numerous items in it (rope, screwdriver, flashlight, etc.) that she finds use for.

==Trivia==
*Each of the four children feature a dominant color of some kind. For Kate, it is the color yellow.
*In the original book series, Kate had long blonde hair done in a ponytail and wore a red and white stripped shirt. She was also noticeably the tallest in the group. Additionally, she also has the ability to figure weight, length and size by merely looking at something.
