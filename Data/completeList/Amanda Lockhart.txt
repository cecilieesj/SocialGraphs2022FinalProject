She is one of the two unofficial Kingdom Keepers along with her "sister" [[Jessica Lockhart|Jessica]]. Their goal is to stop the Overtakers from controlling the parks.

==Biography==
Amanda was born in Maine. Being a fairlie, she had special abilities other humans didn't have. In her case she can levitate objects, persons or herself. When the military started studding, she was sent to a special house. However, Amanda escaped with her friend Jess and went to Orlando, where they lived in an abandoned church. Here she teamed up with the Kingdom Keepers and helps them in their duty to save the magic from the parks.

As the story progresses, her relationship with Finn becomes mutually romantic. However, due to her power to push things away leaking into her relationships, this accidentally causes her to distance herself from him at times; Finn laughs at the problem, considering himself her yo-yo. How strong their love for each other is can be shown with the example that when Finn was put under a spell by the Evil Queen to kiss Jess, ensuring she would sleep forever, and not be able to use the dreams of the future to help the Keepers, his feelings for Amanda caused him to kiss her. Amanda didn't resist the kiss, showing she had been waiting for him to do so, and was later awoken by piercing her finger on a spike of a water wheel. Another example, perhaps as one to show how strong love can be, is that when Amanda had drained herself to hold back a tidal wave Ursula created, Finn's kiss to her cheek gave her energy.

In ''The Insider'', Amanda attends Senior Prom with Finn. Both still love each other, but find it awkward to express. Finn is pulled away from their romantic night by the Imagineers, for a mission that ended up failing. She and Jess are later flown out to Disneyland by the Imagineers, who give them internships and help getting into college.

After Wayne is murdered by Judge Doom, Amanda attempts to help Finn recover, but is unable to as he was already suffering from the loss of Dillard Cole three years prior. She then joins the Keepers in their battles against the Overtakers, who wish to ignite the park and burn it to the ground.

When Finn succeeds in frying Chernabog to death instead, Amanda is hysterical upon finding his DHI form is damaged from the heroics. She hugs him happily after Meg and Rapunzel heal him.

==Trivia==
*There are two role players, [[Alyssa]] and [[Jamie]], who are in a somewhat battle to be her. Both are very nice to each other regardless.
*She is from Maine
