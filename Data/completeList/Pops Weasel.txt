He first appears in the episode "[[Pops Goes the Weasel]]". A thief and con-artist, he goes around [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|Fairy Tale Forest]] conning people out of their cupcakes by offering to give them what they want. But what he gives them instead leaves a lot to be desired. For example, he's been known to supply books without words or badly done paintings. It took the team work of [[Big Bad]], Goldie, and Bear to trick the weasel into returning the cupcakes to their friends.
Pops later returns in "[[The Wolf Who Cried Wolf]]". After finding out Big Bad has taken all the food from the picnic and made up a bandit to blame, Pops decides to snatch the food from the secret stash, knowing Big Bad will get the blame. After Pops is subdued, he is forced to give all the food back.
