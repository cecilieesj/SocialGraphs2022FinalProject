'''Reynard "Reynie" Muldoon''' is the main protagonist in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. He is a young orphan with a highly advanced intellect and the ability to solve problems while also leading his friends in the titular society.

==Background==

===Personality===
Reynie is a very down-to-earth child, though some people have described him as weird. While he definitely will make some peculiar decisions that a child his age would not usually make, he is practically smart enough to take care of himself. He at times will doubt his own intellect and will need the encouragement of his friends and allies to press on. He is a very quick puzzle solver and can solve riddles in a matter of seconds.

===Physical appearance===
Reynie is described as being "average" and thus has a typical appearance of a dark haired boy with "average" features. He is usually wearing a sweater vest, shorts and high socks with plain shoes.

===Abilities===
Reynie is something of a prodigy and a fast puzzle solver. There are numerous instances that imply that he has intense mathematical ingenuity, higher than average observational skills and is multilingual.

==Trivia==

* Each of the four children feature a dominant color of some kind. For Reynie, it is the color green.
* Reynie sticks relatively close to his novel counterpart. Out of all the characters, he is the least developed. This is somewhat joked about within the series when he tells the other children that he will tell a joke to Dr. Curtain, only to be told by the other children that he is not funny.
* His name, Reynard, is taken from the French name Renard, which means Fox. This could be a reference to his intellect.
*Ms. Perumal teaches Reynie how to speak Tamil. Mystic Inscho, Reynie's portrayer, not only can speak Tamil in real life, he can also speak Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Cantonese. Additionally, Inscho shares his character's knack for being a prodigy as he is a fast memorizer and attends college courses at a young age.
