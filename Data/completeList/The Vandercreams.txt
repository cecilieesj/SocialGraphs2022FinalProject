==Role in the series==
When Lucky begins to feel crowded on the Dearly Farm, Perdita suggests that he spend the summer with the Vandercreams. While Pongo has some concerns about this, Perdita seems to suggest that Lucky will begin to miss the others, after spending some days with them.

When Lucky arrives at their estate, he is introduced to the couple, as well as their human butler, Gielgud.

While the two are well meaning, being Dalmatians of high class, they eat at a table, rather than the floor. When served with kibble cocktails, the couple express concern with how Lucky scoffs his down, before expressing shock at how he usually eats from a trough.

They then show him a room, just for him. Later that night, Beamer picks up a message for Lucky via the "Twilight Bark" from Pongo and Perdita, asking how he is. Lucky asks Beamer to reply that he is enjoying himself there.

The next day, the Vandercreams arrange a play date for Lucky at the Dog Park (for their kind of dogs). After the play date, though, Lucky begins to miss the other Dalmatians at Dearly Farm. Beamer notices something wrong when Lucky seems reluctant to eat, and Coco's suggestion that he try the chicken makes Lucky more concerned as it reminds him of [[Spot]].

When Lucky asks if she and Beamer would like to watch ''Thunderbolt'' with him, she comments how ''Thunderbolt'' is an unsophisticated program, with Beamer joking that he'll want them to watch a cattle pull next.

The two watch Pongo, Perdita and the other Dalmatians arrive to pick up Lucky, who is happy to see them.

==Trivia==
*It is unknown whether either Coco or Beamer is related to either Pongo or Perdita, but it implies they are more closely related to Perdita, as she seems more knowledgeable about the two.
*Coco always refers to Lucky as some type of baked good.
