'''Rhombulus''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''. He is one of the members of the Magic High Commission.
==Background==
Not much about Rhombulus' past is known, but he is part of the Magic High Commission and created by Glossaryck. He also imprisoned Eclipsa, the Queen of Darkness (Star's ninth great-grandmother).

===Personality and Traits===
Rhombulus has a very short temper and will quickly engage those he thinks have insulted him. Rhombulus' snake hands have minds of their own, and they sometimes act as the voice of reason for Rhombulus' reckless ideas.

===Physical Appearance===
Rhombulus is a muscular creature with diamond-shaped crystal for a head and eye, and snake arms. These particular items were all that remained of him after magic was erased at the end of the final episode.

===Powers and abilities===
* '''Crystal manipulation''': Rhombulus can generate crystals from his snake hands or eye, which can trap people and objects in crystal or be fired as crystal projectiles. He states that at their full strength, they are as hard as diamonds. He can also crystallize his snake hands to use them like brass knuckles.
* '''Super strength''': Rhombulus has superhuman, or at least above-average, physical strength, capable of flipping a large table and hurling it through a glass window. In "[[Crystal Clear]]", he is able to break his own crystals.

==Trivia==
*Rhombulus' name is a portmanteau of "rhombus", a four-sided shape, and Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome.
*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Rhombulus was created by [[Glossaryck]] to serve as the Magic High Commission's muscle.
*According to storyboard artist Sabrina Cotugno, he and [[Lekmet]] are "live-in boyfriends with some communication issues".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arythusa.tumblr.com/post/157411868962/when-you-say-love-is-forbidden-does-that-include|title=Tumblr Boyfriends Post|website=Tumblr|date=February 18, 2017}}</ref> This combined with the fact that Rhombulus has a crush on [[Moon Butterfly]], implies that he is bisexual.
