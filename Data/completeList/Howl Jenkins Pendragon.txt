'''Howl Jenkins Pendragon''' (born '''Howell Jenkins''') is the titular deuteragonist of ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
At the beginning of the movie, he was rather vain, and did not really seem to care about a lot of others besides himself. He was still kind enough to let [[Sophie Hatter|Sophie]] clean the castle, and even tried to break the curse on her. Not to mention he had taken in [[Markl]] as both his ward and apprentice. As time goes on, he becomes more gentle and caring for everyone, Sophie included.

===Physical appearance===
Howl is renowned for his stunningly handsome features, and a gaudy sense of style. At the beginning of the film, Howl had blonde hair, but because of an incident while Sophie was cleaning Howl's bathroom, Howl briefly had orange hair, before it turned black. In the book, Howl had naturally black hair.

==Appearances==
===''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]''===
Howl Jenkins Pendragon was born in 1873 supposedly in [[England]], but resides in the hills of the imaginary country Ingary.
