Later, Charles tells Meg and her mother to introduce [[Mrs. Whatsit]] to her to which the crow outside is revealed to be Mrs. Whatsit.

The next day, Charles and Meg explore an abandoned cottage and encounter another crow inside whom Meg believes she is Mrs. Whatsit, but it is actually a real crow just before the two leave home as a pair of glasses watches over them. Later, Charles and Meg encounter Calvin who is offered to go to their mother's house to which he plays a game of Boggle with Charles while Dana continues researching the tesseract. That night, he hears Mrs. Whatsit again to show Calvin to find his missing father, [[Mr. Murry|Dr. Jack Murry]], as Calvin is also urged to join in the search. The three arrive at planet Malik's third star Uriel, which is at the planet Malik as it is known Charles, Calvin, and Meg went to this planet via tesseract. As the trio picks up the blue flowers, Charles and the rest board on Mrs. Whatsit in her Pegasus-like creature form and look at the distant darkness that senses a great danger to the universe if not stopped.

That night, Charles and the rest of the trio overhear the three Mrs. Ws talking about Charles discussing their curiosities about them to which Meg overhears. During the conversation, Charles goes into a conversation with Mrs. Whatsit, [[Mrs. Who]], and Mrs. Which, who discuss about the troubles of darkness and Mr. Murry who is lost in the planet Camazotz. He is then sent to go with Calvin to find the Happy Medium who would help them on their journey. During their journey, the three encounter glowworms which helped the three give them light just as the three find the Happy Medium. After learning about Mrs. Murry sad for her husband's loss, it leads Meg, Charles, and Calvin to travel to the planet Camazotz to find Mr. Murry via tesseract.

Later, Meg and Charles use the power of the tesseract to the planet Camazotz to rescue their father from the evil cybernetic organism called [[It]], followed by Calvin joining in. Upon arriving, the three end up getting ambushed by the Man with Red Eyes at the Central Central Intelligence. As the dangers quiet down, Calvin and the rest of the children pass through a neighborhood of Camazotz's residents playing in the dark. Arriving at a movie house, the three discover many merchandise related to It, who rules over Camazotz at the Central Central Intelligence headquarters as a local Camazotz resident girl points the trio to It's headquarters. After discussing with a Camazotz resident teen about It, Meg, Charles, and Calvin approach the Central Central Intelligence headquarters to face It.

Arriving at the Central Central Intelligence, Charles asks a receptionist to know what is the procedure to enter to which he tells him fill out the "A" and "B" forms and put the "A" form in the "S" slot and then wait for the door to open to which Charles himself feels his that his father is there just as the three enter Room K07 without filling the forms required to access by following an agent nearby without getting caught by the security guards. Later when Calvin is placed into a lab where his dreams of being a basketball player are being used as a trap by the laboratory employees, Charles helps free Calvin alongside Meg to which as the three encounter an image showing Meg and Charles' father inside, Meg patiently puts on the glasses given by Mrs. Who as Meg uses them to enter the image. As the image disappears, Charles and Calvin could not catch up with her due to the fact that the image Meg entered disappeared. Suddenly, Man with Red Eyes then gives a new order at Camazotz about all grief, illness, and conflict banished to which as he arrives there, his father warns himself to avoid putting It into his thoughts as he can be a trap. The Man explains to Charles about his different abilities to which his father confronts him, much to his father's warnings.

Meg then tells Charles to remember what Mrs. Which says to which he decides to face his fears in dealing with him, much to Meg's warning. However, the Man with Red Eyes uses the power of tesseract to create a gap which separates Charles from his family, including Calvin. Facing him, the Man gives Charles a bad influence about him to which upon seeing the books he placed via tesseract, it is revealed that the Man with Red Eyes has taken over Charles' mind, turning him into his servant, much to his father telling him to avoid trusting him to which Meg warns him that he is actually taking control of him to which when Charles tells his father that his mother would have seen the astronaut Valentina Tereshkova shown by the Man with Red Eyes, Jack then tells Charles to think of what his mother says to which his father becomes stunned by the Man's tesseract.

Still dealing with him, Charles keeps hearing advice from Meg and her father about not trusting the Man with Red Eyes to which ignoring him, he suddenly becomes under control of him, much to the warnings given out by his father, alongside Meg. Noticing Meg stuck midair due to Charles Wallace under It's evil forces, Calvin tells Meg's father to put on Mrs. Who's pair of glasses to save Meg from the tyranny of It to which while using the glasses, Charles (still with his mind under It's control) reacts to Meg, her father and her friend Calvin escaping, still with Charles Wallace in Camazotz behind while being under control by the Man with Red Eyes. After Meg, her father, and her friend Calvin, have arrived at Ixchel and after Meg follows the advice from Aunt Beast, Meg, her father, and Calvin discusses with Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who about finding plans to rescue Charles from the darkness to which it is explained that the three cannot, due to It's powerful forces to which it is explained that grace would be the only hope of rescuing Charles from the Man with Red Eyes.

After Meg returns back to Camazotz, Meg arrives at the spot where Charles Wallace is at where he is at a dining room with It. As Meg confronts It, Charles Wallace explains to Meg that he obeys the negative influence of It to which Meg denies, explaining that It is the one talking to him and putting him under control to which as Meg faces It. While planning to free Charles, Meg begins counting the numbers the elements of the periodic table from one to thirteen in order to which a vision of Calvin suddenly appears to distract Charles and get him out of It's influence. Meg approaches Charles again who now finally understands what Meg is really saying about the bad influences from It to which Meg suddenly hugs Charles to help him escape from It, much to his rage.

Having returned back to the real world at home, Charles Wallace approaches Meg's mother who is happy to see Meg back after not seeing her for a long time, alongside Charles Wallace to which while Meg's mother is preparing pineapple for Charles Wallace, he recaps about his adventures through the power of tesseract. Later as it is known that everything else around Meg in this dimension is not real, it is known that Meg returning to the real world is an illusion . Later after Meg finds herself at the Westover Community School, the Man with Red Eyes tells her that Charles Wallace is her enemy to which Meg denies, explaining to him about It doing his evil plans toward him. Later after a Meg finds herself at Camazotz again, Meg tells Charles that what It is telling him is a threat to which Meg attempts to use her love for Charles to free him, but Charles refuses to trust her. After trying so hard to trust Meg about that she loves him, Charles Wallace is finally free from It's control, which in turn destroys the Man with Red Eyes himself and It itself.

With Charles Wallace finally free from It, he and Meg leave Central Central Intelligence after Meg tells the Camazotz inhabitants that they are now free, the two see a sunlight from a distance just as the two travel via tesseract to return to the real world with the two happily reuniting with each other. Thereupon, Charles happily reunites with his mother who also reunites her husband and Meg. Later when the three Mrs. Ws appear in front of their allies, Mrs. Which praises Charles about much what he expected, even though he gave the three too much just as Mrs. Which praises him and just as the three of them leave. After the three Mrs. Ws all leave together, Charles Wallace explains to the twins Sandy and Dennys that the three women he saw represent consciousness, goodness, energy, and light who helped Meg and her allies throughout their adventures just as he shares his experience about the adventures he had with Meg and Calvin with his mother and father walking alongside him.
