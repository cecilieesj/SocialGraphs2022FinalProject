'''Sir Glossaryck of Terms''' (or simply known as '''Glossaryck''') is the living embodiment of the [[Magic Instruction Book]] for [[Star Butterfly]]'s [[Royal Magic Wand|magic wand]] in ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''. Although very wise, he is known to be often very silly and playful at times. He can sometimes be an annoyance and appear to help at all, when in fact he actually does in his own strange way. His wisdom often doesn't make sense at the start, but it eventually becomes clear once his lessons have been learned.
== Background ==
Glossaryck has been the magical mentor for the queens of Mewni for centuries. He has appeared in every one of the queens' tapestries, showing his significance to the queendom. He is also the single most powerful being in the universe, and he created many other powerful beings, including [[Hekapoo]], [[Lekmet]], [[Omnitraxus Prime]], and [[Rhombulus]].

=== Physical Appearance ===
Glossaryck is a very small, blue man with a long white beard. He has an very long nose, six fingers on each hand, and a gem implanted on his forehead. He usually, though not always, wears a yellow-brown robe.

== Powers and abilities ==

* '''Levitation''': Glossaryck can hover in place at a fixed height and aerodynamically maneuver along the air.
* '''Telekinesis''': Glossaryck can move objects telekinetically; his ability to levitate may be a manifestation/extension of this. His telekinesis is powerful enough to move an entire portion of a building, as demonstrated in "Page Turner".
* '''Teleportation/astral projection''': Glossaryck can teleport himself and others to other locations, or project the consciousnesses of himself and others to other locations, as demonstrated in "[[My New Wand!]]" and "[[Page Turner]]".
* '''Shapeshifting''': Glossaryck can morph his body to suit his needs. In "My New Wand!", he enlarges his hands, and in "Page Turner", he enlarges his legs in order to quickly climb a flight of stairs.
* '''Photokinesis''': Glossaryck can project light from his forehead gem to light up dark areas, as demonstrated in "My New Wand!" and "Bon Bon the Birthday Clown". In the latter episode, he tells Janna that it is "not natural", suggesting that he had the gem implanted in him (later confirmed in "Crystal Clear"). He also uses this offensively against [[Rhombulus]] in "Page Turner".
* '''Clairvoyance/omniscience''': Glossaryck seems to possess some form of clairvoyance. In "My New Wand!", he is apparently aware that Marco reading Star's journal would cause her to "dip down", and in "[[By the Book]]", he seems to predict the episode's course of events. In "Crystal Clear", Glossaryck is the most powerful, all-knowing being in the universe according to Rhombulus. In "Book Be Gone", Glossaryck even knew that Ludo would throw the book in the fire thereby presumably killing him as he is bound to the book. However, his knowledge has its limits, such as in "Page Turner" when he doesn't expect to end up on back on the first floor after climbing the Bureaucracy of Magic's stairs.
* '''Construct creation''': Glossaryck can form objects or magical constructs from his forehead gem, such as meatball subs in "[[Star on Wheels]]", methods of defense in "Page Turner", apples in "[[The Hard Way]]", and an umbrella in "Conquer".
* '''Immortality''': [[Into the Wand|"Into the Wand]]" reveals that Glossaryck is virtually immortal, having served and guided many past queens of Mewni. In ''Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension'', it is stated that he was the first living being the universe had ever birthed, thereby putting his age beyond even sextillions years, so as to round it to at least the amount of a googolplex.
* '''Omnipresence''': In "[[Swim Suit]]", Glossaryck shows that he can be in two locations at one time.
* '''Life creation''': According to ''Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension'' and "[[Meteora's Lesson]]", Glossaryck created [[Omnitraxus Prime]], [[Lekmet]], [[Rhombulus]], [[Hekapoo]], and Reynaldo the Bald Pate.
* '''Healing''': In "[[Yada Yada Berries]]", it is revealed that he can undo the petrification effect of the eponymous berries instantly.
* '''Time travel''': In "Meteora's Lesson", Glossaryck states he can travel through time but without a passenger (unlike [[Father Time]] and Reynaldo the Bald Pate).

==Trivia==
*The reason for Glossaryck's voice change was due to Jeffrey Tambor being accused of inappropriate misconduct, though he later denied the allegations.
