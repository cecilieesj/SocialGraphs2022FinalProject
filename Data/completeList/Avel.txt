Avel is only seen during the part where [[Corey the Manticore|Corey]] is being interviewed by the police about her incident with [[Ian Lightfoot|Ian]] and [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]] at the [[Manticore's Tavern]] to which [[Laurel Lightfoot|Laurel]] arrives during the conversation, telling Laurel that his conversation with Corey has gone crazy. Corey attempts to help, but Avel gives Corey some questions about what she did during the incident with Ian and Barley. Laurel asks him if he is an expert on manticores to which he doesn't know much about them, telling him to have a private conversation with Corey. However, Avel only notices the charred mascot costume during the incident while telling the two to have a short conversation. His further fate is unknown.
