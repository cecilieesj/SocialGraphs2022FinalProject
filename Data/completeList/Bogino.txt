'''Bogino''' is a character featured in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. She is a red panda who is part of [[Domog]]'s pack.

==Background==
Like all the red pandas part of [[Domog]]'s pack, Bogino is shown to be nervous whenever a ghost arrives in the bamboo forest to threaten the red pandas. She also worked together with Bunga and his friends to defeat Chuluun.

==Role in the series==

==="[[Ghost of the Mountain]]"===
After [[Bunga]] grabs some Tuliza for Kion, Bogino and the other red pandas gaze upon him as he and the other red pandas chant "Sonessen Khun" believing the honey badger is their protector. [[Anga]], [[Kion]], and the rest of his team witness the red pandas chanting for Bunga. Looking at the red pandas cheering for him, the group arrives to the spot where the red pandas prepare a throne for him. Later, the leader of the red pandas, Domog, arrives in front of the red pandas as they chant for him to which Domog tells the [[Lion Guard]] to learn the legend of the ghost of the mountain as he explains that only "Sonnesen Khun" can save the red pandas from the ghost. Later when Domog allows Bunga to bring followers to help him fight the ghost of the mountain, Bogino and the other red pandas bid a farewell to find and defeat the ghost and save the red pandas to wish them good fortune.

Later after the Guard discovers that the ghost of the mountain is actually a snow leopard named [[Chuluun]] and Chuluun starts chasing them in the bamboo forest, the Lion Guard decides to stop Chuluun before she attacks the red pandas. Just as Bunga and the Lion Guard confront Chuluun, she retreats back to the snowy mountain. Bunga then devises a plan to help find and defeat Chuluun in order to save the red pandas just as Bogino and the rest of the red pandas arrive and work together to defeat Chuluun.

Arriving at the snowy mountain, Bogino and the other red pandas surround Chuluun under Bunga's command, along with the Lion Guard and [[Makini]] just as Bunga uses his stench ability to defeat her and save the red pandas from Chuluun's devious plans with teamwork. Bogino and the other red pandas cheer for Bunga for completing his task of saving the red pandas. Later when the Lion Guard finds the [[Moja Kwa Moja Stone]] in the bamboo forest, the Lion Guard then follows the path to the next landmark marked on the stone. Bogino and the other red pandas bid a farewell to the Lion Guard for helping save them from Chuluun with teamwork; however, Chuluun is shown to have survived her battle against Bunga.

==Trivia==
*"Bogino" means "short" in Mongolian language.
*Interestingly, Bogino is the only named red panda whose name does not start with a "D".
