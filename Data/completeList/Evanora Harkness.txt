====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In Salem, [[Massachusetts]], [[Pre-1922|1693]], Evanora has her daughter, [[Agatha Harkness|Agatha]], lead to trial, accompanied by the witches of her coven. She watches, as Agatha's hands are [[magic|magically]] bound, and tied to a stake. Evanora asks her daughter if she's a witch, and Agatha confirms it to be true. She narrates the charges being held against Agatha, of betraying her coven, by stealing knowledge above her age and station, and practicing the darkest of magic. Agatha denies this, but Evanora silences her. The witches begin chanting, and as Agatha begs for her mother's help, Evanora joins in. The witches hands glow blue, and Evanora watches on, as they fire beams of blue magic towards her daughter. She observes, as Agatha initially begins screaming in pain, but her volume lessens, as her magic begins polluting that of the other witches, turning the beams fired at her, violet. Evanora witnesses members of her coven rapidly aging, as they continue blasting away at Agatha, with beams of violet magic. She levitates in the air, and recites an incantation, and fires at her daughter, with a blue beam, assisting her coven. Agatha manages to free herself from the constraints placed on her, and spreads her arms, releasing a wave of energy, that kills all the members of the coven. Evanora continues levitating in the air, as she looks upon her daughter. Agatha pleads with her mother, claiming that she can be good, but Evanora disagrees. She summons another burst of blue magic at her daughter, and fires at her chest, as a crown made up of energy, appears on her head. Agatha begins polluting the beam, and a violet light, emitting from her, begins climbing towards the beam, until it reaches Evanora. Evanora 's magic weakens, and her crown disappears, as she begins to rapidly age. She falls dead to the ground, and Agatha takes her mothers pendant, before flying off.

Hundreds of years later, [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] induces Agatha into a nightmare, where she returns to Salem, bound at the stake, and surrounded by her dead coven. The witches all begin to rise, chanting "witch", at Wanda, and Evanora rises to point directly at her, and pronounces her as the Scarlet Witch, and a Harbinger of Chaos. Evanora approaches her, as her coven tie Wanda to the stake, in place of Agatha. Wanda then proceeds to blast Evanora, and the other witches back.

==Trivia==
*Evanora is also the name of the [[Evanora the Wicked Witch of the East|Wicked Witch of the East]] in the film, ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''.
*While Agatha disguises herself as Agnes in [[Westview]], Evanora's pendant can be seen accompanied with all of her outfits.
*In Agatha's induced nightmare, a crown of magical energy is conjured on Wanda's head, similar to Evanora's.
