'''Denise''' is a pig who features in the [[2015]] [[ABC]] series,Â ''[[The Muppets (2015)|The Muppets]]''. She serves as Head of Marketing on ''Up Late with Miss Piggy'', and happens to be dating the show's Executive Producer, [[Kermit the Frog]].

==Background==
In an interview with ''Extra'', Kermit says they met because she's one of the people who had the idea for the Muppets to do a new show, and they hit it off. Speaking with ''Entertainment Tonight'', Kermit admits he's got a thing for pigs because he finds their curly tails attractive.

Her first appearance occurred on September 1, 2015 in a promo with Kermit and [[Ken Jeong]]. The two are engaged in light conversation on the studio lot when Kermit's attention is shifted to Denise who rides by on a scooter. She holds her glasses and doesn't speak, but locks eyes with Kermit in the brief spot.

Throughout the much-publicized break-up between Kermit and [[Miss Piggy]], the topic of his new love interest has come up on occasion. In an Audi commercial, the former couple take a business lunch, and Piggy dismissively refers to Denise as Dennis more than once. She goes so far as to stage a Paparazzi stunt to make her jealous of Kermit and Piggy's continued attention in the press.
