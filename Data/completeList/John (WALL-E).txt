'''John''' is a human passenger aboard the ''[[Axiom]]''. He has blond hair and is featured in the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''.

==Role in the film==
While about his usual business around the ''Axiom'', John presumed that [[WALL-E (character)|WALL•E]] was a waiter bot to take away his drink. Unfortunately, WALL-E's hesitation made him fall over. Afterwards, a couple of Stewards go to their area and told him to wait for assistance. WALL-E helped him before following the MVR-A carrying [[EVE]].

While at the windows, John noticed WALL-E space dancing with EVE. The other human next to him, [[Mary (WALL-E)|Mary]], also met the robot. Upon seeing each other, they quickly fell in love. They are later seen on the Lido Deck late at night when no one else is around, playfully splashing in the pool, against the objections of a robotic lifeguard that John playfully splashed to shut it up, shorting it out in the process.

When AUTO tipped the ship over to prevent The Plant from being placed inside of the Holodetector, Mary and John saved a bunch of babies that fell out of their hoverchairs as they themselves were, he then observed with the rest of the ''Axiom'' Passengers as Captain McCrea stood up and charged at AUTO and deactivated him to right the ship again. He then helped with bringing The Plant over to the Holodetector as the ''Axiom'' made its jump heading back to Earth. John then departed the ''Axiom'' with the rest of its passengers, becoming one of the first humans to have ever stood on Earth in over 700 years.

==Trivia==
*John is the first Pixar character that [[John Ratzenberger]] portrayed who shares his first name.
