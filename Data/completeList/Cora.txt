She is the oldest daughter of [[Queen Emmaline]] as well as [[Oona]]'s older sister.

==Role in the Series==
Cora is first seen outside [[Oona]]'s shipwreck hideout with Sven and [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], who she takes an instant shine to. She then tells Oona that their mother, [[Queen Emmaline]], wants them to go back to the Merroway Cove throne room. Queen Emmaline says that a human vessel is in the cove and [[Plank]] suggests that Emmaline remove the Floating Palace out of the Cove. Cora agrees with Plank because she thinks that humans are dangerous and that they might harm Oona and her family. When Sofia admits that she's a human and that the ship is her family's ship, Cora starts acting negatively towards Sofia despite Oona's protests on her friend's behalf, though, as her mother, she doesn't act as antagonistic toward Sofia as Plank does because of her sister's obvious affection for Sofia.

When Oona is captured by the [[The Sea Monster|Cedric the Sea Monster]], Sofia goes back to Queen Emmaline and tells her about Oona. Cora, Plank, and Emmaline all think that Sofia is lying and that her human family has kidnapped Oona after Plank made these accusations despite the fact that there is evidence against it, like the fact that Sofia and Oona are friends and the fact that Sofia knows that such a thing would anger Emmaline to the point where she would sink the ship with her family on board in retribution. Sofia is given until sundown to get Oona back and return her to Merroway Cove before Emmaline uses her Trident to sink the Floating Palace. After time is up and Oona doesn't come back, the Queen and Plank go up to the surface and conjure up a storm to sink the Floating Palace. Cora asks her mother if she can come, but the Queen says that it's too dangerous and that she must stay underwater.

[[Ariel]] helps Sofia to realize that both humans and merpeople care about their families and they must work together to save both. Sofia realizes that she needs Cora's help to save Oona. At first, Cora doesn't believe that Oona was taken by the Sea Monster until [[Sven (Sofia the First)|Sven]] says that he saw it with both his eyes. Sofia says that the only way to save Oona is by working together. Cora then believes Sofia's story and goes with her to the cave where the Sea Monster was and reveals that the comb Oona wears has the power to control the ocean. Their mother gave Oona the comb so no one would its power, but Oona doesn't know what her comb can do and that their mother should have given it to  her because ''she'' knows how to use the comb. When Sofia gets Oona's comb, she throws it overboard where Cora is waiting, then Cora raises the comb and chants "Waters rise at my command!" Then a huge wave blasts the Sea Monster out of the cove and Oona is rescued. Oona then thanks Cora for rescuing her and afterward she, Emmaline, and Plank all apologize to Sofia for their behavior.

At the very end, [[Princess Amber|Amber]] was talking to Cora, mentioning about her seashell headband, until [[Prince James|James]] does a cannonball into the water, to Amber's annoyance.

Cora makes a nonspeaking appearance at the end of the episode, "[[Cool Hand Fluke]]" as she watches her sister's band perform at the party in the mermaids' honor.

In "[[Return to Merroway Cove]]", Cora is rehearsing for a big show that Queen Emmaline is putting on for the Enchancia Royal Family. However, she is later told by Oona and Sofia that Oona tried to create a sea twister with her Mermaid Comb, but lost control over it when it got too big for her to handle. Despite knowing they need to tell Emmaline about it, Cora instead opts to use Emmaline's Trident to try and stop the sea twister. This fails, but luckily, Emmaline arrives, having been warned of what happened by Sven, and is able to subdue the sea twister herself. Nevertheless, she is extremely disappointed in Cora and Oona for their irresponsibility with the Trident and Mermaid Comb, and grounds them as punishment. However, because they told her the truth and apologized for their actions, she delays the start of their punishment until the next day, so they can still perform in the water show.

==Trivia==
*Like a lot of older siblings, Cora likes pushing her little sister's buttons in a way Oona doesn't find funny.
