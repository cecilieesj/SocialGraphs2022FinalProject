'''Winnie Jackson-Foster''' is the protagonist of the [[2002]] film, ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]''.

==Biography==
Winnie is a wealthy girl who runs away from home and encounters the Tucks, a family of immortals. She develops a deep love for [[Jesse Tuck]], a one-hundred-four-year-old boy trapped in a seventeen-year-old’s body for all of eternity. A greedy man known as [[The Man in the Yellow Suit]] has a plan based on childhood stories he heard from his grandmother about a family of immortals. He set out to find them and sell the water they drank from for huge amounts of money. [[Mae Tuck]] foils his plans when she clubs him in the head with a shotgun. In the end of the film Winnie helps Mae escape from prison and chooses not to drink from the bottle but instead to die like all other mortals. In the late 1900s, Jesse rides up to the tree on a motorcycle and visits Winnie’s grave under the spring.
