==Role in the Series==
In his debut ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]'', Lyste also had a few run-ins with the local rebels, the crew of the ''[[Ghost (starship)|Ghost]]'' in particular. One such incident involved the sabotage of a speeder bike as well as the theft of a few cargo crates. Despite Lyste and his men's efforts to stop the attack, the rebels were successful in their heist.

Sometime later in "[[Fighter Flight]]", Lyste was in the town of Kothal where he attempted to pressure local farmer [[Morad Sumar]] into selling his farmland to the Empire. After Sumar expressed disinterest in the prospect, Lyste took his troops to the farm later that day, where he forcibly evicted Sumar, his wife, and their Aqualish farm helper, destroying their home with his troop transport's cannons. The farmer, his wife, and the farmhand were later freed while in transit by [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]] who had seen the smoking ruins of the farm from the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter they had recently stolen.

He also met Princess [[Leia Organa]] in "[[A Princess on Lothal]]", who had arrived with three Hammerhead Corvettes to support the civilian population of Lothal with supplies. Lieutenant Lyste gave the princess the necessary land permit and escorted her to the planet. He knew that Alderaan ships had often fallen into the hands of the rebels in the past. For this reason, the lieutenant had the task of avoiding the abduction of the three Corvettes by insurgents in all circumstances. He not only escorted the three ships from patrolling body groups but also anchored them with gravitational locks and placed [[AT-AT]] combatants aside. At the end of the night, the crew succeeded in kidnapping all three ships and transporting them to the rebel network. That Princess Leia actively supported the insurgents and deceived Lyste from the outset, the officer did not recognize.

In "[[An Inside Man]]", Lyste was later assigned to the Lothal Imperial Factory, where he reported directly to [[Thrawn|Grand Admiral Thrawn]].

Later in "[[Through Imperial Eyes]]", Lyste, along with [[Agent Kallus|Kallus]], capture a shuttle fleeing from Lothal containing Ezra Bridger (although Lyste is not aware of Bridger's identity) and informs Thrawn. He meets with Kallus, the Colonel [[Wullf Yularen]] and is charged to find the rebel spy Fulcrum. In order to protect himself and his friends, Kallus switches his code cylinder with Lyste's and frees Ezra. He then manipulates Lyste by saying that Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]] is the traitor. He is convinced of this when he witnesses Pryce fight [[Kanan Jarrus|Kanan]] and [[Rex]], who are disguised as stormtroopers. He then stuns Pryce and is ecstatic to have caught the "traitor". He quickly realizes his mistake, however, when Ezra mocks him and reveals he made the wrong choice, finally recognizing Bridger. Before he can fire on Ezra, he is tackled by Kallus who frames him as Fulcrum. The Rebels flee just before Yularen and his soldiers arrive, and Lyste is subsequently arrested.
