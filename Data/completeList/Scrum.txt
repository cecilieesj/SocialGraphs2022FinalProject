{{Quote|Boys! There ain't much been given to me in my brief, miserable life, there's the truth of it. But by God, I'll have it said that Scrum had himself a kiss from [[Tamara (Pirates of the Caribbean)|a proper mermaid]]!|Scrum|Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides}}
'''Scrum''' is a character in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]].

==Background==
Scrum shows a joyful personality. He uses his trusty instrument, the mandola, to entertain his listeners with cheerful shanties.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]''===
Scrum first appears during the scene when [[Captain Teague]] rescues a fugitive [[Jack Sparrow]] from the redcoats under the tyranny of [[King George II]] where he entertains customers using his mandola at the Captain's Daughter pub, just as Jack plans on recruiting him, thinking the real Jack Sparrow is an imposter. When the imposter is revealed to be [[Angelica]] after a confrontation in a plan to find the [[Fountain of Youth]], their conversation is interrupted when Scrum warns Angelica and Jack about a group of redcoats hunting for Jack Sparrow. Jack and Angelica manage to escape from the redcoats with [[Joshamee Gibbs]], [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]], and the rest of the ''HMS Providence'' crew on their way to find the Fountain of Youth.

Boarding the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''', Jack proves himself to Scrum (who also introduces himself to Jack) that he is the real one to prove himself that he is not an imposter. Honored by Jack who welcomes him on board the ''Revenge'', Scrum tells him that there is a group of vicious captain and his crew on their way to the Fountain of Youth on board the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' to which Jack explains the captain and his crew on their way to the Fountain is no other than Captain [[Blackbeard]], the captain whom all pirates fear because of his zombified crew making him almost difficult to defeat thanks to this. Scrubbing the deck, Scrum explains that Captain Blackbeard has an army of zombified minions, making it complicated for the crew to defeat Blackbeard.

Talking about mutiny, Jack devises a plan about trying to face and defeat Blackbeard who would come out an any time to face against Jack, Scrum tells that the ship he and his crew saw was the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' seeing its name on the back of the ship just as Jack explains that death could be common amongst his fellow crewman whenever Captain Blackbeard arrives at the Fountain of Youth just as Scrum plans to take Blackbeard's ship with the rest of the crew. During an ambush between the Dauntless and the zombie pirates on the ''Revenge'', Scrum and the rest of the crew gaze upon Blackbeard putting the crew in mutiny using his sword to hang Jack's crew. After the ambush stops, Scrum looks at the cook preparing to escape Blackbeard's ship for safety but notices Blackbeard's devious plans to the cook which is the use of Greek fire from the ship, turning the crew member into a zombie.

When Jack talks to Angelica about Blackbeard's plan about a ritual in the Fountain of Youth, Scrum plays his instrument over Jack and Angelica's conversation on their way to Whitecap Bay to get the mermaid's tears for the ritual. Arriving there, Scrum is then warned about mermaids who could drag victims with their singing and kill them just as he sings "[[My Jolly Sailor Bold]]" again while on a boat to wait for a mermaid to get the tears for the Fountain ritual. As Scrum tries to fall in love with a mermaid just as some mermaids swim towards the crew on boat, one of them, [[Tamara (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Tamara]], reveals her gnashing fangs just as the mermaids attack the crew at Whitecap Bay. During the battle against the mermaids, the mermaids prepare to drown the surviving crew members alongside Scrum. Using powder barrels and nets to catch a mermaid and get the tear for the ritual, Scrum and the rest of the crew manage to survive the battle against the mermaids just as they retreat due to Jack Sparrow igniting the inside of the tower, causing it to emit an explosion.

Surviving the battle at Whitecap Bay, Scrum and the rest of Jack's crew proceed towards a tropical forest where Blackbeard requires two chalices for the ritual, followed by the crew arriving at the Spanish camp at a deep jungle where Blackbeard is discussing with the crew about tears from [[Syrena]], the crew manages to get tears from her just as Scrum and the crew continue proceeding to the Fountain.

Having found the chalices and on their way to the Fountain and discovering water on the ceiling, Jack offers Scrum to help him reach the top just as Scrum and the rest of the crew crew notice Jack finding himself in the Fountain of Youth. During the battle against Blackbeard and his undead crew, Angelica tells Scrum to give her the chalices and the tear of the mermaid to which Jack prevents him as Angelica's plan for the ritual was actually a trap as she was linked to Blackbeard due to his betrayal to the crew.

With Blackbeard dead and Barbossa as the new captain of the Queen Anne's Revenge, Scrum and the rest of the crew set sail for [[Tortuga]] as the new captain of the ship just as he becomes part of Barbossa's crew.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===
Scrum was one of the pirates involved in one of the failed attempts in piracy. Ever since the robbing of the bank in Saint Martin, Scrum loses faith because Jack only earned them one piece of gold from the bank. When it comes to Jack who is to be killed via guillotine, Scrum and the rest of Jack's crew arrive saving him before he is sentenced to death via guillotine, alongside [[Carina Smyth]] who is sentenced to be hung for illegal witchcraft. With Jack and Carina rescued, Scrum and the rest of Jack and Barbossa's crew set off to seek the [[Trident (Hercules)|Trident of Poseidon]].

During their quest to find the Trident of Poseidon, the crew ends up getting ambushed by a ghost ship known as the ''[[Silent Mary]]'' to which Gibbs found out that the Royal Navy ship the ''Essex'' was following the ''Dying Gull''. To avoid punishment, Scrum accepts his role as the captain as the Royal Marines attack him in revenge. With the ''Black Pearl'' finally released from the ship in the bottle, Scrum and the rest of the crew went back on board the ship in order to continue to find the Trident and defeat [[Captain Salazar]] who is dying to seek revenge against Jack Sparrow in an ultimate battle between his undead crew and Jack's crew at the Tomb of Poseidon. With the trident destroyed and Salazar defeated for good along with Barbossa who sacrificed himself to defeat Salazar, Scrum and the rest of Jack's crew mourn for Barbossa's sacrifice. Scrum later became part of the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' where Jack Sparrow retained his position as the captain of the ''Pearl''.

==Trivia==
*In an early script for ''On Stranger Tides'', Scrum played a cheerful tune during the part where Barbossa became the new captain of the Queen Anne's Revenge where he sails it during the end of the film. It is not known if it is cut in the final version nor is it known that scene was filmed. Scrum's actor Stephen Graham did mention playing the mandola in an interview.
**However, in the ending cutscene of the ''On Stranger Tides'' campaign in ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]'', this scene is likely inspired by the early screenplay where Scrum uses the mandola as an electric guitar in victory to know that Barbossa is now the new captain of the ''Revenge'' instead of singing as no character is ever heard talking throughout the game.

* It was never stated why and how Scrum joined Jack Sparrow's crew in Dead Man Tells No Tales as he followed Barbossa at the end of the previous movie.
