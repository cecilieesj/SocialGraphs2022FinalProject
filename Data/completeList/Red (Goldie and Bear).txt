She travels between her home and her grandmother's house to deliver muffins. She tends to be stopped by [[Big Bad]] all the time and every time she out-thinks him. She is the cleanest child in the forest and does not like getting dirty. She can also be snobby, and enjoys hanging out with other fine, tidy people, like Rapunzel, who gets her hair braided by her.
