}}'''Baby Herman's Mother''' (or '''Mrs. Herman''') is a minor character in the [[1988]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', who took a major role in the short films that spun off from it. She is not seen again for the rest of each of these films, and just like Mammy Two-Shoes from most of her appearances in early ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, her head is not shown. She often threatens to kill Roger if he messes with Baby Herman
 
==Trivia==
*On set in the film, she is revealed to be just a pair of oversized mechanical legs with a skirt draped around them.
*Her screen time in all of her appearances are limited to just small cameos at the beginning (especially the three [[Tummy Trouble|Roger Rabbit]] [[Trail Mix-Up|theatrical]] [[Roller Coaster Rabbit|shorts]]).
