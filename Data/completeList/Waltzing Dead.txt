==History==

===Background===

====The Haunted Mansion====
These twelve individuals were ballroom dancers who died and came to haunt [[Haunted Mansion (location)|the Haunted Mansion]]. It is unknown if (but believed that) they had some affiliation with the manor during their lifetimes.

=====Couples:=====
*A blonde woman in a yellow dress with a blonde moustached man in a grey suit.
*A pale-pink haired man in an aqua suit with a pink haired woman in a pink dress.
*An orange haired man in a grey suit with an orange haired woman in an orange dress.
*An aqua haired man in a grey suit with a turquoise haired woman in an aqua dress.
*A purple haired man in a salmon suit with a purple haired woman in a violet gown.
*A man in a green suit with a woman in a green dress.

====[[Phantom Manor]]====
These twelve men and women were residents of [[Thunder Mesa]] who were attendees of the wedding of [[Melanie Ravenswood|Mélanie Ravenswood]]. The wedding came to be a disaster with the groom mysteriously disappearing, having been murdered by [[the Phantom]] of the manor. In death, the ballroom dancers haunted Ravenswood Manor in an eternal wedding dance.

==Appearances==

===The Haunted Mansion===
The ballroom ghosts can be seen in the ballroom scene of the Haunted Mansion, dancing in couples to the pipe-organ music of the [[organist]]. They fade in and out of sight as they dance, all while being transparent. The effect behind their appearance is achieved with an effect known as ''Pepper's Ghost'', in which their figures' reflections are projected onto a plane of glass in-front of the guests.

===Phantom Manor===
In Phantom Manor, the ghosts are seen in the ballroom of Ravenswood Manor where they dance to the doomed wedding of Mélanie Ravenswood. Their appearance in the ride is practically identical to that from the Haunted Mansion.

===Parades===
Cast-members portraying the ballroom ghosts will often appear in [[Halloween]] parades at the [[Disney Parks]].

====[[Mickey's Boo-to-You Halloween Parade]]====
In this [[Walt Disney World]] parade they are part of the 3rd group, appearing behind the float holding the [[Hitchhiking Ghosts]]. Cast members are asked to fabricate fictional backstories for the dancers and including elements of these histories in their costumes (E.G. if one of them was poisoned, their hand might be on their throats, or if one of them was electrocuted, they’ll shake when they dance)

====[[Frightfully Fun Parade]]====
In this [[Disneyland]] parade, they are part of the first group and are very similar to their Boo-to-You incarnation.

====[[Mickey's Halloween Celebration]]====
The ballroom dancers appear in-front of the, "Illusion Manor" float in this [[Disneyland Paris]] parade. They are themed much more heavily with the backstory of Phantom Manor in this parade and have brighter costumes.

===Mystical Spirits of the Blue Bayou===
In this event held at the [[Blue Bayou Restaurant|Blue Bayou restaurant]] in [[New Orleans Square]], the female ghosts are named the Bayou Belles and are summoned as entertainers by [[Dr. Facilier]].

==Other Appearances==

===Film===

====[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]====
In this film, the ghosts are seen to have been attendees of a Mardi Gras party held in Gracey Manor by [[Master Gracey]] on the night that his [[bride]], [[Elizabeth Henshaw|Elizabeth]] died. When Master Gracey's ghost confronts Elizabeth's reincarnation [[Sara Evers]] about this in the 2000s, the ghosts of the ballroom dancers materialize around the two which scares Sara.

===Printed Materials===

====The Ghost Gallery====
In the 1990s, cast-members of the Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World created a backstory for the attraction as a means of answering guest questions. All of this backstory was recorded on paper and while unofficial, has since influenced both the original Haunted Mansion's official and semi-official features as-well as adaptations based on the Haunted Mansion.

In this story, the ballroom dancers were six couples invited to a party in Gracey Manor hosted by [[Madame Leota]] in the year 1909. When they denied her and her lover Master Gracey attention, she used magic that caused them to uncontrollably dance until dying of exhaustion.

===Video Games===

====[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]====
The ballroom ghosts appear during the boss-fight with [[Constance Hatchaway]] in this video-game. They can be attacked by the player using a flashlight.

====[[Disney Crossy Road]]====
The ballroom dancers are NPCs in this video-game's Haunted Mansion levels, being obstacles to be passed.

==Trivia==
*Due to the reflection used in their effect, the women are leading the men in their waltz. When questioned about this, imagineer [[Blaine Gibson]] described it as a, "Screw up" while [[Xavier Atencio|X. Atencio]] rationalized it as them simply being ghosts and not adhering to social mandates.
*There were originally intended to only be six dancer animatronics which would be reflected to look like twelve. However this effect didn't work as intended so six more figures were made. Due to this, some early promotional material for the ride shows only half the amount of dancers than there are in the final ride.
