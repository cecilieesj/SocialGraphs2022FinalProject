==Role in the film==
In the beginning, when [[Oliver]] is left all alone and his box home is ruined, Oliver tries to find shelter in an alley, only to find three vicious alley dogs searching for food. When the alley dogs spot Oliver, they begin to chase him, so as to eat him. Luckily, Oliver escapes by jumping over a fence while the dogs remain behind the fence. They aren't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this until somewhere in the climax when Oliver is with his dog friends singing ''[[Streets of Gold]]'', another vicious alley dog jumps into the scene and chases Oliver until he is scared off by [[Dodger]] and the gang's growling and runs away like a yellow cowardly dog. He isn't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this.
