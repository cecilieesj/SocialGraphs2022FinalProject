The '''Minstrel''' is a minor character that appears in the [[1959]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. He is one of [[King Stefan]]’s servants, where he served as the minstrel of the [[King Stefan's Castle|castle]].

==Background==
===Personality===
The Minstrel is mainly shown to love wine and music. He is shown to be drunk, so he probably often becomes very drunk behind King Stefan's back and is also shown to like his musical performances.

===Physical appearance===
The Minstrel is shown to be a slender man with light brown hair. He is shown to have a slender long pointy nose and darker eyebrows than his hair. He shown to wear a yellow and orange (only with the strpies) shirt with a black color that matches his tunkhose. He is often shown holding his banjo.

==Role in [[Sleeping Beauty|film]]==
As King Stefan and [[King Hubert]] wait for [[Aurora|Princess Aurora]] to return, Hubert feels like celebrating and summons the Minstrel to serve them wine and play music for them as they [[Skumps|sing and toast]]. He secretly helps himself to a few drinks and ends up getting drunk and falls asleep under the table with his feet sticking out and his head inside the mandolin.

Later, when the [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|fairies]] put everyone in the [[King Stefan's Castle|kingdom]] to sleep, Merryweather spots him after regaining consciousness, only to be put back to sleep by a wave of Merryweather's wand. Afterwards, Minstrel isn't seen again for the rest of the film. However, it can be assumed that he possibly wakes up from his slumber after [[Maleficent]]'s demise and [[Prince Phillip|Prince Philip]] kissed Aurora, which breaks Maleficent's curse and awaken the whole citizens of the kingdom.

==Trivia==
* In an upcoming Season 2 episode of [[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]], [[Oscar Proud]] dresses as the Minstrel at a Princess Ball event.
