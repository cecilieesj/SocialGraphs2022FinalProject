==AppearancesÂ ==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
At the Cube, a normal Samson visits [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]. During the breakout, the failures in the Cube cause Samson to get exposed to Gamma radiation, becoming super-strong and green-haired. Samson saves Banner from debris, but is attacked by [[Zzzax]], which causes Banner to get angry and turn into [[Hulk]], who fights his way out and takes Samson to safety.

Some time later, Samson accompanies [[Avengers|the Avengers]] to investigate the Gamma dome surrounding the Cube. He and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] end facing an augmented [[Wrecking Crew]] while [[Black Panther]] destroys the Gamma generator.

When the [[Leader]] activates a bigger Gamma dome in Las Vegas, Thor and Samson remain unaffected. Samson is beaten, but the Leader is defeated by Thor, Hulk, and [[Hawkeye]].

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
[[Spider-Man]] imagines Doc Samson giving anger therapy to [[Wolverine]] and [[Sabretooth]]. The therapy fails as both mutants fight with Spidey trapped between them.

===''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''===
Samson tries to teach [[Skaar]] to behave, and when it doesn't work with therapy, Samson uses hypnosis. However, Skaar returns to his barbaric self when hearing the word "please".
