====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
He is first seen in the [[Generation Why|first episode]], dribbling a basketball, down the school hallways. As [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] passes by, he playfully blocks her with the ball, before quickly moving out of the way.

Another day during school, Paul is once again dribbling the ball down the hallways when he comes across Kamala. As he tries to block her path with the ball once again, Kamala intercepts it from him, spinning the ball over her head, and returns it back to him.

He later attends a party, among his fellow classmates, hosted by [[Zoe Zimmer]]. He sees Kamala and offers her a drink, and she questions if there's any alcohol in it, but he claims its just orange juice. When Kamala takes a sip, she begins to gag, and Shawn adds there is also vodka in it, and walks off smiling. He begins talking to Zoe, when the partygoers are alterted by the incoming arrival of police. He and the others all run away, before they can get into trouble.
