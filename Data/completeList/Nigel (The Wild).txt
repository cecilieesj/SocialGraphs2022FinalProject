==Role in the film==
Nigel is a very feisty and immature koala who's recognized by the [[Central Park Zoo|New Yorks Zoo]]'s famous plush koala toy, which he hates intensely, and is tired of being called "cute and cuddly" by his crazed fans. However, when Nigel is abducted by wildebeests upon reaching [[Africa]], they worship him and make him their king, and their leader [[Kazar]] dubs him as the "Great Him." Nigel soon sees the error of his ways when the wildebeests attempt to eat his zoo friends and escapes with the others. He is good friends with [[Larry (The Wild)|Larry]] but often angers [[Bridget]] and [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] with his mild, dry humor. He treats [[Ryan]] fairly well and has a very evident personality clash with [[Benny (The Wild)|Benny]], most likely because Benny is softhearted and responsive, while Nigel is delusional and lazy, although he does mean well. He is last seen dancing on the boat with his zoo friends as it sails home, and [[Breaking the Fourth Wall|breaks the fourth wall]] just before the credits roll.
