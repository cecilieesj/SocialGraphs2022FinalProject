|quote = }}'''Vacation Van Honk''' is a recurring character in ''[[DuckTales]]''. He is an anthropomorphic goose who lives in [[Duckburg]].

==Background==
Vacation Van Honk, in concept, is a "recurring extra"; though he has little characterization, this permanent tourist and globe-trotter is persistently encountered by the Ducks wherever they go. Although Van Honk has made few appearances, he attended Scrooge's surprise birthday party, implying that he is a close friend of the family.
==Appearances in the series==
He appeared in the episode "[[Sir Gyro de Gearloose]]", where he is one of the Duckburg residents complaining about Gyro's inventions malfunctioning.

In "[[Sweet Duck of Youth]]", Vacation was seen among Scrooge's family and friends at Scrooge's surprise birthday party.

He also appeared in "[[Magica's Shadow War]]" and "[[Duckworth's Revolt]]".
==Other appearances==
Though largely forgotten since the end of ''[[DuckTales]]''<span>'</span>s original run, Van Honk has made a few cameos in comics in his role of recurring bystander, such as in the 2004 story ''The Beagle Boys and the Last Pirate''.
