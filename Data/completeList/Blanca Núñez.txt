'''Blanca Núñez''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. She's [[Gabe Núñez|Gabe]]'s mother and [[Roberto Núñez|Roberto's]] wife.

==Personality==
Blanca is a very passionate and supportive woman. She is shown to love baking and olaball as much as her husband Roberto. However, she is more accepting of her son's choice of career and more understanding of Gabe's need to be his own man than Roberto as shown when she nodded to her son's words to her husband in the aftermath of the olaball game.

==Role in the Series==
Blanca first appeared in "[[Olaball]]" in her husband's bakery baking empanadas for the Peace Festival. She happily greets her son when he enters the bakery. She grows concerned as her husband and son somewhat have a spat. When Gabe turns to leave, Blanca goes after him. Gabe tells her "I wish just once I could make him happy." Blanca tells him she understands and tells him "You make me happy Mijo." At the olaball game, she hands out the empanadas as a concessioner. She is overjoyed when Gabe scores the winning point and when Roberto accepts her son's decision to stay in the Royal Guard after he rescues Isabel and Caterina.
