{{CharacterStub}}As Scott undergoes a major transformation into becoming Santa Clause, including major weight gain, quickly greying hair, and a beard that immediately grows back after shaving, he goes to see Dr. Novos for a physical and possible explanation of these massive changes. Dr. Novos finds no diagnosible issue with Scott's health, and suggests Scott simply cut back on his cravings for sweets for the weight gain. He also suggests the beard is a hormonal imbalance, and the grey hair is simply from being middle-aged. When he uses his stethoscope to listen to Scott's heart, he hears it beating to the beat of "Jingle Bells".{{The Santa Clause}}
