'''Ellie the Elephant''' is a character from the [[Jungle Cruise]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Ellie is an Indian elephant which was adopted as a calf by one [[Trader Sam]] during the [[1930|1930s]].  Sam brought Ellie along with him to the Amazon rainforest where he did work with the [[Jungle Navigation Company]].  Ellie also sometimes accompanied Sam's cousin and business-affiliate [[Chief Nah-Mee]] in his east-coast operations.

=== Development history ===
Ellie originally only appeared in Disneyland's Jungle Cruise where she stood at the feet of Trader Sam while he tried to sell shrunken heads.  In [[2021]] the attraction was updated to removed racist stereotypes such as was the case with Trader Sam.  Sam's outpost was replaced with, "Trader Sam's Gift Shop!" which is to feature Ellie.  It is unknown at time of writing if Ellie is to also be installed in the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s Jungle Cruise for the same scene.
