When their [[The Woodcutter|father]] went missing, the siblings sought out to look for him and ran into the [[The Evil Queen#Once Upon a Time|Evil Queen]] who offered to help if they help her.

The children manage to sneak in the witch's house but Hansel eats a cupcake, awakening the witch. But they are able to get out of the gingerbread house alive and deliver the bag to the Evil Queen, which had contained the [[Poisoned Apple#Once Upon a Time|Poisoned Apple]]. She offered to let them stay with her, but Hansel and Gretel declined and tell her to find their father instead. The Queen became angry and sent them back to a forest, and it is revealed that the Queen was the one who kidnapped their father. When the Woodcutter informs her that his children refused to stay with her because "family always stays together", the Queen tells him that they can be together if they can find each other, forcing the Woodcutter to search for the children as well.

In [[Storybrooke]], they are '''Nicholas''' and '''Ava Zimmer''', the 12-year old twins of Michael Tillman, the auto shop owner. Their mother Dory passed away and have been living on their own ever since. They are first seen shoplifting for food and frame [[Henry Mills]] for it. [[Emma Swan]] investigates what happened, and goes on to interrogate the twins. When she learns they are orphans, Emma sympathizes with them since she also has no parents. She goes on to look for them using a compass Dory used to keep and goes to Mr. Gold to ask him if someone had purchased the item before.

[[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]] gives her the name of the man, Michael Tillman. He denies the children are his, but recognizes the compass. He wants nothing to do with them especially since he was unaware of their existence until now, and cannot accept the responsibility. If Ava and Nicholas' father continued to reject them, they would be taken to Boston to be placed into separate children's homes. Emma calls Michael to fix her car before they leave. Ava notices that her compass needle is moving. Tillman arrives in his tow truck and realizes that the children are his. He hesitates but then agrees to be their father, and then goes to his children.

They narrowly escape and tell their father Ivo, about the [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West]], who left them for dead. Hansel tried to retaliate against Zelena only for her to burn parts of his arms.

The experience leaves Gretel thinking about her future and ways to protect herself. While Gretel learns candy-based [[magic]], Hansel eventually leaves her to travel the realms, under the name Jack. When [[Henry Mills|Henry]] arrives in the [[Magical Forest]], he makes friends with Jack and bonded. After fighting off giants, Jack makes plans to head over to [[Agrabah]] as Henry decides to leave for [[Storybrooke]].

Gretel attacks Drizella and as the two fight, Drizella fatally stabs Gretel in the back enabling Drizella to pass the initiation.
