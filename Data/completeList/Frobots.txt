It can shoot multiple smaller Frog-Bots similar to its design for reinforcements from its shoulders and back. It has incredible strength befitting its size and built in tadpole missile launchers in its arms and chest.

== Role in the Series ==
=== Before ===

=== Season 2 ===
King Andrias finally got the Calamity Box then used it to power up his [[Newtopia Castle|castle]] enabling to to fly. Then, it sent out a signal to reactivate the Ruins of Despair causing them to and create and army of Frog-Bots under the giant newt king's command.

=== Season 3 ===
The Frog-Bots were seen guarding the flying castle while  Andrias sent a [[Silver Frog-Bot|special silver one]] to earth to terminate Anne. He also sent a gigantic bronze one to take care of Sasha and wipe out [[Wartwood Swamp|Wartwood]] but was destroyed. Sometime during late winter the Frobot army became so massive that King Andrias was nearly ready to invade Earth.  When [[Anne Boonchuy]] returned to Amphibia she was horrified to see the Frobots spreading terror across the land and imposing Andrais' tyrannical rule on the innocent inhabitants.
