== Role in the Series ==
Sally Tugbottom is the true founder and hero of Brighton and the older sister of Ezekiel Tugbottom. Unlike her brother, she actually likes turnips, and any attempt she made at getting him to eat them usually leads to someone-- herself included-- being hit in the head when he tosses one away. She befriended a bear by treating it's wounded paw, cut firewood and lit fires for those incapable of doing it themselves, and when a tornado came through the town and her brother froze in terror, she used a lasso to pull him to safety. After that,she lead the charge to rebuild the storm-ruined town. Up until the time she became a ghost, Sally had long been oblivious as to how Exekiel "shamed the proud Tugbottom name" by taking the credit for her hard work until Scratch told her everything, prompting her to lasso her brother's tornado form, pin him down with help from the ghost of the bear she befriended, and drag him away by where his ear once was, giving a lecture on how his desire for praise and glory is not what being a hero is really about. After her statue is made in place of her brother's, Sally thanked Molly McGee for exposing the truth and carrying on her true legacy, saying she'll "rest easy" knowing that Brighton is in good hands.
