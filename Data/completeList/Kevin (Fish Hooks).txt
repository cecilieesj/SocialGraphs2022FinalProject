[[File:Kevin.jpg|thumb]]'''Kevin''' is a fish who goes to [[Freshwater High]], but was held back a grade. He appears in the show ''[[Fish Hooks]]''.
==Role in the Series==
Kevin came out of nowhere after [[Milo (Fish Hooks)|Milo]] thought when he'll get held back, he'll still have his friends. Milo, [[Oscar Fishtooth|Oscar]], and [[Bea Goldfishberg|Bea]] didn't know who he was. Kevin claims he has gone to all the adventures with Milo, Bea, and Oscar, but since he got held back a grade, no one ever recognizes or sees him, which made Milo realize he has to study to not lose all his friends. Milo, Oscar, and Bea still forgot who he was and he swam away crying ("[[Fail Fish]]").

==Background Information==
*Even though he claims he was held back, the adventures he went on with Bea, Oscar and Milo happened in [[Mr. Baldwin]]'s class.
*He is most likely in the 9th grade since he is said to have been held back.
