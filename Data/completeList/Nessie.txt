'''Nessie '''is the protagonist in the [[2011]] Disney short ''[[The Ballad of Nessie]]''. She is a homeless creature that attempts to find a home.

==Background==
===Personality===
Nessie is a sweet and beautiful creature. She gets sad very easily when something awful happens to her. For example, [[MacFroogle]] taking over her home to make it a golf course.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Ballad of Nessie]]''===
Nessie once lived a peaceful life in a small pond with her rubber duck McQuack, until Tycoon [[MacFroogle]] paved it and the surrounding land over to create a golf course. Though so distressed that she wanted to cry, she was dissuaded from this course by an observing bird and so decided instead to find a new home. However, every attempt proved fruitless, and each observer she encountered expressed the same sentiment against crying as the bird. Finally, after a long journey without success, Nessie broke down and cried a literal flood of tears; once they were spent, she discovered to her astonishment that they had produced a perfect new home for her: [[Loch Ness]], where she and her rubber duck, MacQuack would live peacefully forever afterwards.

===Other appearances===
A Nessie plush appears in two scenes in ''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice]]'', first on the screen of the elves as the toy that [[Timmy Terwelp]] wants, and then among [[Grace Goodwin]]'s toys.

Nessie can be spotted in two scenes as a figurine in the holiday short ''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]''. She is first spotted during the musical number "[[That Time of Year]]" and later during the scene when the sled is on fire.

Nessie's face is seen on the back of a newspaper in ''[[Monsters at Work]]'' in the episode "[[The Big Wazowskis]]". The paper says "Nessie's Secrets Unloched", implying that she is the Loch Ness Monster that Mike had mentioned in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' who had gotten banished in the first place along with [[Bigfoot]] and the [[Yeti (Monsters, Inc.)|Abominable Snowman]].
