|quote="Plutz!"}}'''Colonel Neopard''' is an anthropomorphic leopard mercenary from [[PKNA]]. He travels along universe and other dimensions, aboard of his ship, Dame Elentari, making war for his clients with his droids army.

He frequently utters the words "Plutz", "Grabbaga plutz" and "Cysssa". When [[the Duck Avenger]] wants to know what those mean, he whispers the meaning, which leaves the Avenger shocked and saying "You can't say something like that in a Duck Avenger adventure!"
