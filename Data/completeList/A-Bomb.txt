'''A-Bomb''' is [[Hulk]]'s best friend and an enthusiastic S.M.A.S.H. teammate. He is voiced by [[Seth Green]].
Rick Jones was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Background==
===Biography===
Rick Jones's alternate identity, A-Bomb, was created when Rick stole [[Red Hulk]]'s Sandblaster in an attempt to help [[Hulk]] stop an invasion by Annihilus. He accidentally overloaded the vehicle's gamma core and the resulting explosion transformed him into a blue gamma powered hulk-like superhuman.
===Personality===
Since before and after he became A-Bomb, Rick has been the best friend of Hulk, and one of his most devoted advocates.

In order to improve Hulk's image, Rick utilized special cameras for a web-show in order to show the world the side of the Hulk that he sees, a good person who wants to do the right thing. Of course, this led to Rick wanting to film some of the action Hulk got into, much to Hulk's chagrin as he didn't want Rick getting hurt.

However, Rick persisted, leading to him getting exposed to gamma-radiation, which is what transformed him into a "blue hulk". Despite the transformation, Rick (who gave himself the name A-Bomb) did not change on the inside.

He remains a somewhat immature but loyal friend to Hulk, but has something of a fanboy-side whenever he meets another hero, like Thor or Spider-Man.

===Powers and Abilities===
Aside from his superhuman gamma-powered strength, he possesses a near impenetrable armored skin, has the ability to turn into a rolling wrecking ball, and can blend to blend into his surroundings like a chameleon.

===Equipment===
* '''Cameras:''' A-Bomb uses these cameras to film the adventures/exploits of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. in his goal to improve Hulk's image

* '''Various Gamma-related Weapons/Gadgets''':
