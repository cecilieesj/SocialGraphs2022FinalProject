'''Peter's Grandfather''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[1946]] animated short ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', a segment of the animated feature film ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Grandpa seems a bit rough, but it is because of the fact that he is living in [[Russia]]'s cold winter with a dangerous [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] running about and a grandson named [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]] who thinks he can best it with a popgun.

==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
Grandpa only appears toward the beginning of the segment. He stops Peter from going off to find the dastardly wolf with his popgun, scolds and spanks him, and tells him that if he tries to go after it, he could very well end up getting eaten. To scare him further, he makes a wolf's evil fangs with his beard to show him the shadow puppet of the wolf on the wall. Peter turns around and tries to shoot it, but tricking him, he easily grabs Peter's cap and popgun from him and storms off. However, when he falls asleep in his chair by the fireplace, Peter manages to get his things back and sneak outside.

==Trivia==
*In the children's book based on the segment, it is revealed that after Peter returns, having successfully captured the wolf, Grandpa is pleased with him and glad to see him safe, despite his disobedience. Peter also promises to listen to and never disobey Grandpa again.
*Grandpa is represented in the music by a bassoon.
