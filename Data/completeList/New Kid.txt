[[File:Chyna's_crush,_the_new_kid.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''New Kid'''<span style="line-height:19.5px;"> is a student at </span>[[Webster High School]]<span style="line-height:19.5px;"> whose name is unknown. He appears only in </span>The PhANTom Locker<span style="line-height:19.5px;">. </span>Chyna<span style="line-height:19.5px;"> is always trying to talk to him because she has a crush on him. She wrote him a song, titled "</span>Hey, New Kid<span style="line-height:19.5px;">", although she never performed it for him, most likely because she was too nervous or maybe she took </span>Olive<span style="line-height:19.5px;">'s advice of changing it because it was too "spitty". She attempted to leave a note in his locker stating that she had feelings for him and asking if he liked her back. She ended up putting it in the locker next to it, though, which belonged to </span>Angus<span style="line-height:19.5px;">. </span>

Upon receiving it, he wrote on it, gave it back to Chyna<span style="line-height:19.5px;">, and when she read it, it said "no", much to her anger. </span>Angus<span style="line-height:19.5px;"> comments "Don't hate the player, hate the game" and walks away. It is unknown</span><span style="line-height:19.5px;"> if </span>Chyna<span style="line-height:19.5px;"> still has feelings for him. He was not credited but is portrayed by Payton Scott.</span>
