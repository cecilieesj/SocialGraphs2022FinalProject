'''Silvermist''' is one of the major fairies in the ''[[Disney Fairies]]'' franchise. Silvermist is a talented water fairy of East Asian origin. She looks on the positive side of life and acts as an influence between [[Tinker Bell]] and [[Iridessa]].

==Background==
===Personality===
She is a water-talented fairy who is best described as sweet, silly, and sympathetic. Her sympathetic personality can be seen in many situations, such as when Terence is angry with Tink in ''Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure''. She is always ready to lend an ear to a fairy friend in need and gives them good advice for some reasons and not in some ways. But she usually gives more good advice than not. She's a really good fairy to be friends with.

Silvermist has a delightfully eccentric way of seeing everything. Very much a free spirit, she often listens to her heart more than her head. That's why she's rather silly for some reasons. She's an easygoing fairy who is eager to please and makes friends easily. Her sense of loyalty is unmatched, and it often rubs off on Tink.

Silvermist's guilty pleasure is listening to rumors and Never Land gossip from the Babbling Brook. In ''Silvermist and The Ladybug Curse'', it is mentioned that Sil is the only fairy in Pixie Hollow who does never believe in curses and other fairy superstitions.

===Physical appearance===
Silvermist appears to have an Asian appearance with a slender model and wide hips. She has long, straight black hair with a slightly dark blue hue to it and almond-shaped eyes. She wore a one-shouldered blue dress that appears to be made from painted leaves, as seen in ''Tinker Bell''. In ''Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure'', she wears a white and blue gradient dress with matching shoes.

In ''Tinker Bell and The Great Fairy Rescue'', she wears a dress made of blue pea petals, which has a big yellow spot in the center-right.

In her original design, Silvermist wore a sky blue one-shouldered dress.

[[File:Silvermist001a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Silvermist in ''Tinker Bell''.]]
Silvermist is first seen at Tinker Bell's arrival to Pixie Hollow along with the other fairies from her talent and others. As Tinker Bell sits up, dizzy and confused, Silvermist comes and comforts her. She, Rosetta, Iridessa, and Fawn quickly befriend Tinker Bell upon her first day in Pixie Hollow. At one point in the film, Tinker Bell makes the decision to change her talent. Silvermist is the first to offer aid, though she still believes Tinker Bell should accept her talent. Silvermist takes Tink into the ponds to teach her how to put water drops on spider webs. However, since Tinker Bell is destined to be a tinker fairy, this fails.

After the water-talent disaster, Silvermist views on the sidelines as Tinker Bell attempts to learn other talents from Iridessa, Fawn, and Rosetta. When all of that fails, Tinker Bell stumbles upon a ballerina music box. Silvermist, Rosetta, Fawn, and Iridessa watch in silence as Tinker Bell tinkers the music box to restoration, proving that her talent is just what she's good at. At the film's climax, Tinker Bell accidentally destroys the preparations for spring, preventing the fairies and sparrow men from journeying to the mainland and changing the season.

Tinker Bell redeems herself, however, and Silvermist offers to help by using Tinker Bell's innovations to repair all the damage. In the end, Silvermist and the others journey to the mainland, with Tinker Bell tagging along to return the music box she found.

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]''===
[[File:Silvermist009a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Silvermist in ''Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure''.]]
Silvermist plays a smaller role and is seen proceeding with her daily duties for the seasons at the film's start. Later on, Silvermist runs into Terence, who has just left from an argument with Tinker Bell. Silvermist advises him to give Tink some time to cool off. The next day, Tinker Bell asks Silvermist for extra pixie dust, but she must save as much pixie dust as possible for the trip to the mainland. Before Tink leaves, Silvermist tells Tinker Bell to try asking Terence, hoping the two will work things out.

Afterward, Silvermist is seen training tadpoles to blow bubbles as practice for the upcoming celebration of the blue harvest moon. In the end, Silvermist is present when Tinker Bell was able to use shattered pieces of the legendary moonstone to create billions and billions of blue pixie dust.

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue]]''===
[[File:Silvermist-disney-females-25678522-1920-1080.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Silvermist in ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue''.]]
In ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue'', Silvermist and many other fairies and sparrow men traveled to the mainland to attend the summer-long Fairy Camp. On the first day, while collecting water drops, Silvermist claims the water feels grouchy, foreshadowing a storm. That night, Tinker Bell is captured by a human girl named Lizzie. Vidia rallies together Silvermist, Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Clank, and Bobble, to rescue Tink. Unfortunately, Silvermist's predictions of a storm were correct, and by the looks of it, the rain was getting stronger.

Clank and Bobble think of a plan to create a boat, and the rescue mission proceeds. At one point, the group came face to face with a waterfall. Silvermist was able to rescue them. When they finally reach Tink, Lizzie's father plans on taking her to a museum for study, but Vidia is captured instead. Lizzie helps the fairies help her father understand the error of his ways and brings peace between fairies and humans. Silvermist is lastly seen in the end, attending a picnic with the fairies, Lizzie, and her father.

===''[[Secret of the Wings]]''===
[[File:foto-silvermist-de-campanilla-el-secreto-de-las-hadas-2-035.jpg|thumb|250px|Silvermist in ''Secret of the Wings''.]]
Silvermist has seen water-skating and enjoying herself with her friends in Pixie Hollow as usual on an ordinary day. Later on, however, Silvermist and her friends rush to the doctor after they hear Tinker Bell crossed the border to the forbidden Winter Woods and got her wings frozen. The healing talent fairies heal them rather quickly, however, and Tinker Bell tells her friends about a peculiar event that took place when she crossed. When she crossed the border, her wings began to glow. Silvermist does never exactly believe the story, just as the rest of her friends don't. Tinker Bell decides to seek the keeper of fairy knowledge for more information. Since the keeper resides in the Winter Woods, Tinker Bell crossed over again and learned that her twin sister Periwinkle is near when her wings glow.

Tinker Bell and Periwinkle become close friends over just a day. When Tink returns to Pixie Hollow, she immediately tells her friends about the tale. Silvermist finds the story to be breathtaking and offers to help when Tink gets the idea to create a snow-making machine that will allow Periwinkle to visit the warm regions of Pixie Hollow. The next day, Silvermist and the others give Peri a tour of Pixie Hollow. Silvermist also shows Peri her water ability during a ride in the creek. Eventually, the heat becomes too much for Peri, and the frost fairy is forced to return home and never see Tink again by orders of Queen Clarion and Lord Milori, the ruler of the Winter Woods.

After Silvermist and the others returned to Pixie Hollow, the snow machine, left at the border, begins to go berserk. Silvermist and the others destroy it, but the machine has already frozen parts of Pixie Hollow. The damage causes the balance of the seasons to be thrown off, putting all fairy life in danger. Silvermist and her friends evacuate the fairies and animals to shelters throughout the Hollow. Silvermist and her friends stay inside the Pixie Dust Tree when everyone else is safe, which is in danger of being destroyed because of the immense cold.

Tinker Bell then thinks of an idea to save the Pixie Dust Tree. Pixie Hollow would be saved if Periwinkle and the frost fairies can use their magic to preserve the tree in an ice blanket of sorts. Tink rushes to the Winter Woods and retrieves Peri and the others. After using lots of power, the Pixie Dust Tree is saved. Pixie Hollow's warm climate is restored within minutes, and all is good. Queen Clarion and Lord Milori then abolish the border law, allowing warm fairies to cross over when their wings are preserved, and allowing Tinker Bell and Periwinkle to stay united as sisters.

She flies towards the duo and then introduces herself to Alice, however, once she notices Will and recognizes him, she slaps him twice. She tells Will he's bold for returning to Wonderland, stating that a lot of people are looking for him. Will tells Alice that they may need to walk around the lake, but Silvermist happily offers to take them both, stating she is a professional and she doesn't let old, personal feelings get in the way of her work. She then uses her magic to fly the duo across the lake. As she takes them across, Will comments that he always liked flying with Silvermist... among other things. Disgusted, she drops Will into the water and refuses to rescue him, forcing Alice to jump in after him. Once they make it to the shore after riding a turtle, Silvermist returns to Will after hearing of the bounty on him by the [[Caterpillar]].
