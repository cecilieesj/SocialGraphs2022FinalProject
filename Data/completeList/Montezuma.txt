[[File:Cortes_vs_Montezuma.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration from ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow: The Sword of Cortes''.]]'''Moctezuma I''' (c. 1398-1469), also known as '''Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina''', '''Huehuemotecuhzoma''', or '''Montezuma I''', was the fifth Aztec emperor and king of Tenochtitlan. He appears as a character in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' tie-in books as a ghost.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow]]''===
Montecuhzoma served as Cortés' subordinate, believing him to be the god [[wikipedia:Quetzalcoatl|Quetzalcoatl]] in human form. His faith was such that Montecuhzoma remained loyal to Cortés even when the conquistador began to dominate the Aztec empire and massacre its people. It was believed the Sword of Cortés may have forced Montecuhzoma's loyalty. He was stoned to death by his own people for urging them to retreat rather than fight Cortés' armies.

He was said to have died loyal to Cortés, though it was known that his spirit, locked within the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam, held a grudge against his former leader. When [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] released Montecuhzoma's spirit from the eye, Montecuhzoma challenged the spirit of Cortés, forming two Swords of Light to battle Cortés' Sword. Montecuhzoma disarmed his foe, and bodily carried Cortés into the air, before plunging into the sea, defeating Cortés.

Before departing, Montecuhzoma's spirit healed the dying Tumen, then flew off to the northwest.

==Trivia==
*[[Montezuma (Chihuahua)|Montezuma]] a.k.a. Monte from ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'' was named after him and his role as leader of the Chihuahua tribe was based on him.
