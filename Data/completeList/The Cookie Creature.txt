}}The '''Cookie Creature''' is an antagonistic little creature who lives in the walls of the Sinclair family's house.

The creature steals cookies from [[Baby Sinclair]], much to the disbelief of [[Frances Sinclair|his mother]], who assumes the baby has actually just eaten the cookies. Baby wages war on the creature in the "[[Nuts to War]]" episode of ''[[Dinosaurs]]''. But when Baby follows the creature, he finds that she was only feeding her young.
