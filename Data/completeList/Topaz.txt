'''Topaz''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', played by [[Rachel House]]. She is the personal guard of [[Grandmaster]], acting as his personal assistant. Topaz is fiercely loyal to the Grandmaster. 

While on the service of the Grandmaster, she carries around a staff that can fire energy blasts powerful enough to melt her enemies, something she is often eager to do, much to the Grandmaster's chagrin. Topaz also dislikes [[Valkyrie]], another subordinate of the Grandmaster, for receiving the Grandmaster's favor. After the revolution on [[Sakaar]] begins, Topaz leads the chase after [[Thor Odinson]], [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], and Valkyrie trying to escape in fighter ships. A distraction in the battle disorients her and she perishes when her fighter crashes.

Topaz was created by Mike W. Barr, Mark Heike and Ken Branch.
