}}'''Councilor Chang'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/dragons/chang.htm</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0144367/?ref_=tt_cl_t5</ref> is a minor character and villain from the animated television show, ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

==History==
Chang is a dragon from China like [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]], as well as a Dragon Councilor at [[Draco Island]].

She first met [[Jake Long|Jake]] as one of his examiners during the "Test of Flight" challenge. Unbeknownst to anyone, she was a double agent for the [[The Dark Dragon|Dark Dragon]] and had been for centuries<ref>[[Dragon Summit]]</ref>. In fact it was later revealed she orchestrated the legendary battle between Lao Shi and the Dark Dragon in which Lao Shi emerged the victor, incapacitating Fu so that her master could fight him without interference,<ref>[[Hong Kong Nights]]</ref> and years later she once again led Lao Shi into a trap, this time in the sewers, where she double-crossed him. Revealing her loyalty to the Dark Dragon, she trapped Lao Shi in sphinx hair netting and summoned her master, again knocking out Fu when he attempted to help. However, she was defeated by Jake, who had enlisted the help of [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]] and [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]] and a few magical creatures to rescue Lao Shi.

Her next encounter was when she, along with fellow councillors [[Councilor Kulde|Kulde]] and [[Councilor Andam|Andam]], were captured by the [[The Huntsclan|Huntsclan]] to be executed as part of [[Huntsgirl]]'s initiation test<ref>[[The Halloween Bash]]</ref>.

Months later, after being outed as an agent of the Dark Dragon, Chang escaped from prison and picked up an animal guardian sidekick named [[Bananas B.|Bananas B]]<ref>[[Nobody's Fu]]</ref>. Chang appeared again with Bananas B as they sought to steal hydra scales and a phoenix feather. Foiled by [[Haley Long]] during her brief stint as the substitute American Dragon, Chang pretty much seemed to know who [[Sun Park]] was, which as a former member of the Dragon Council made sense.

She was last seen with Bananas B during the Dark Dragon's gambit to mentally enslave the entire Dragon Council during a solemn ceremony in Hong Kong<ref>[[The Hong Kong Longs]]</ref>. She was captured in a sphinx hair net during the ensuing combat, and probably sent back to jail after that.

==Trivia==
*When Chang was younger, she bore an unusual resemblance to [[Jasmine (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Jasmine]]<ref>[[Dragon Breath]]</ref>.
*In Season Two, Chang had such a change in character design, she didn't even look like she belonged on the [[The Dragon Council|Dragon Council]] anymore. In fact, her appearance, human and dragon, looked like somewhat of a cross between [[Maleficent]] and [[Queen Narissa]]. Another character who underwent a drastic character design was the Huntsman.
*Chang is similar to [[Demona]] from "[[Gargoyles]]":
**Both are the same species as the main protagonist ([[Goliath]] and [[Jake Long]])
**Both betrayed the person they loved for their goals (Goliath and [[Luong Lao Shi]])
**Both believed their species should rule the world (Gargoyles and Dragons)
**Both have been shown to transform into human, though Demona uses a spell to turn human.
