==Mighty Ducks==

Duke is a former notorious jewel thief on Puckworld. He reformed after he saw how [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]] and his people were taking over Puckworld. Duke has used a Puck Blaster in some episodes, but he mainly uses a golden sword called a Ducksaber (or sometimes just a 'saber'). He also carries lock picks and a grappling hook attached to his wrist. Duke has a Brooklyn accent and is pretty level-headed, albeit egotistical at times. He also has an eyepatch. He was the leader of a gang called the Brotherhood of the Blade. He remains the most experienced of all the Ducks and possesses a good balance of skill with confidence. 

Duke wears an eye patch over his right eye due to a sword accident. He also has a chip in his beak, which is probably from a fight he got into. His jersey number is 13.
