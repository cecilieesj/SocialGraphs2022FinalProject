The Johnson family greatly respects her, as the Johnson Family Picnic is held on her birthday every year.

==Personality==
It is shown that Hildegard hates losing. She initially disliked [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]. She then changed her mind about her when she returned Annabelle Johnson to the family.

==History==
Hildegard was part of the rollerskating derby early in her adult life. Her team, the Saskatoon Slashers, won against the Tri-State Bombers. Ever since then, [[Betty Jo Flynn|Betty Jo]] and Hildegard have been enemies. After a re-match in Phineas and Ferb's roller rink, the race ends in a tie. They still disagree about who won the race ("[[Crack That Whip]]").

During the Johnson's Family Picnic, Hildegard had her 85th birthday. She says that she doesn't like Candace, but she changes her mind when [[Candace Flynn|andace]] brings to the picnic Annabelle, the long lost member of the family. She recognizes Annabelle's status as a member of the family due to Anabelle's birthmark which is the letter "J" ("[[Run, Candace, Run]]").

==Relationships==
===Family===
====[[Suzy Johnson]]====
Suzy seems to admire her grandmother, as Suzy has shown compassion, the latter even hugging her grandmother. During Hildegard's rematch against the Flynn-Fletcher family, she automatically asked Suzy, indicating that she is somewhat aware of her granddaughter's darker persona ("[[Crack That Whip]]").
====[[Jeremy Johnson]]====
Hildegard seems to command great respect amongst her grandson, as he sportingly "battled" against the Flynn-Fletchers ("[[Crack That Whip]]").
====Annabelle Johnson====
When Annabelle was little she ''"wandered off''", but when Candace brought her to the Jonhson's family picnic, Hildegard was so overjoyed that she changed her opinion of Candace ("[[Run, Candace, Run]]").
===Flynn-Fletchers===
====[[Betty Jo Flynn]]====
Hildegard and Betty-Joe are rivals from their days in the Tri-State Roller Rink. Hildegard pulled a dirty trick to win, and Betty-Joe accused her of cheating. The two mellowed and found common ground (or at least attempted) for the sake of their grandchildren ("[[Crack That Whip]]").
====[[Candace Flynn]]====
Hildegard said that she didn't like Candace, likely for being the granddaughter of her old rival. She took a liking to Candace when she brought back Annabelle ("[[Run, Candace, Run]]").
