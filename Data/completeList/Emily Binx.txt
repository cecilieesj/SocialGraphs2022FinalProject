==Role in the film==
One morning in Salem, [[Massachusetts]] on Halloween<ref>According to Gilbert in ''[[Hocus Pocus 2]]''.</ref> in 1693, Emily is lured out of her home by the beautiful singing of the witch, [[Sarah Sanderson]]. Entranced by her voice and deaf to [[Thackery Binx|Thackery]]'s frantic cries, she willingly follows Sarah into the woods all the way to the [[Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|Sanderson Sisters' cottage]]. Bewitched, she sits docilely in a chair and obediently drinks their [[Life Potion|life potion]], failing to recognize Thackery when he barges in to rescue her.

The potion causes Emily's life force to become visible, allowing the sisters' to steal it in order to restore their own youth and vitality. In seconds, they are once again youthful and Emily is reduced to a withered husk. She stirs feebly for a few moments but soon dies of age.

Three hundred years later, Emily's spirit finally welcomes Thackery to the afterlife, complaining that she's waited for him a long time. The sisters had cursed him to live forever in the form of a black cat, but with their deaths, the curse is broken and he is at last allowed to reunite with Emily and they cross over into the afterlife.
