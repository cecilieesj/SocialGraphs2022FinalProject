==History==
===''Cars 2''===
At the Radiator Springs Grand Prix, Raoul ÇaRoule first appeared on tv during [[the Mel Dorado Show]] when all the racers where forming the [[World Grand Prix]] logo. He didn't make a physical appearance until the [[Tokyo]] welcoming party for the World Grand Prix where he and the other racers reacted to Mater causing a scene. Later Raoul can be seen doing pre-race movements before the race in Tokyo starts. He was positioned in the first grid for the race and when it began he was seen 4th place but dropped to 5th shortly. After the hairpin Raoul was shown to be catching up in the dirt section in [[Tokyo Grand Prix|Tokyo]]. He was also seen passing [[Francesco Bernoulli]] by using the same skill that [[Lightning McQueen]] used to pass him gaining second but after heading back on asphalt he dropped positions drastically. He finished in last place in Tokyo. In [[Porto Corsa Circuit|Porto Corsa]] he could be seen in the last position when the race started. Later he was shown to be ahead of [[Miguel Camino]] and [[Rip Clutchgoneski]] when the racers headed down towards the Casino Bridge. He reappears later trying to stop himself from crashing into the pileup with Rip Clutchgoneski but fails in the process. He didn't finish the race as a result. In London he could be seen ahead of Rip in 10th place still holding the position after they raced through the [[Admiralty Arch]]. Raoul ÇaRoule also appears in the [[Radiator Springs Grand Prix]] race, admiring the crowd with Rip Clutchgoneski. During the race he was shown off having fun jumping through the dirt as the WGP racers watched him. He was later seen in 4th place but his position dropped to 5th due to [[Mater]] passing him with his rockets.

==General information==
===Physical appearance===
Raoul is a 1999 [[Citroën]] C4 World Rally Car based on [[wikipedia:Sebastien Loeb|Sebastien Loeb]]'s Citroën C4 Hymotion4 WRC.﻿ During the production of the film, Citroën contacted Pixar complaining Raoul looked too much like their hatchback. Character art director Jay Shuster had to make a diagram of the character pointing out all the differences, and how the cars weren't the same. He has a top speed of 124.3&nbsp;mph, with a 0-60 time of 5.5 seconds. His engine type is a 1.6 liter turbocharger 4-cylinder. He has a horsepower of 300, with an all wheel drive. He is painted in the French national colors, blue, white and red, with the letters "[[GRC]]", an allusion to the WRC, the [http://www.wrc.com World Rally Championship], written in blue across the white column. He has chrome rims, in which some spokes are painted red. Written on his tires is the phrase "Rouler Vite", which translates to "Roll Fast" in French, or more in context, "Drive Fast". A smaller inscription reads P210/70R18 99S.

===Personality and traits===
Raoul is humble and confident out on the track, and remains friendly to other racers and cars off the track. While he races, Raoul has an enthusiastic attitude, often shouting words of accomplishment out loud.

===Powers and abilities===
Raoul is one of the most talented French rally cars in the world, and as such, was invited to the World Grand Prix to compete against ten of the other greatest champions around the globe. ''Cars 2: The Video Game'' reveals that he is a lightweight racer, and has little physical power, but he makes up for that with his incredible speed.

==Official profiles and statistics==
"''Raoul ÇaRoule, also known as the World's Greatest Rally Car, was born in Alsace, France. A restless soul, Raoul joined the famous Cirque du Voiture French circus where he learned Gymkhana – a graceful, drift-filled motorsport that taught him pinpoint timing and an unparalleled ability to navigate tricky courses with ease. He's the first car to ever win nine consecutive rallies. Raoul is confident he can use his rally experience to pull ahead of his fellow World Grand Prix racers during the three courses' touchy dirt sections, especially with his fans in the stands waving banners that read, "ÇaRoule Ca-Rules!''"

==Trivia==

[[File:Frenchversion.JPG|thumb|200px|Raoul in the French version of ''Cars 2''.]]
* A French version exists in which Raoul ÇaRoule replaces [[Jeff Gorvette]] as the car Lightning McQueen meets at the World Grand Prix welcome party along with [[Lewis Hamilton]].
*The French rally racer character in ''Cars 2'' (that ended as Raoul ÇaRoule in the final film) was first supposed to be a female car, named Michèle, in allusion to Michèle Mouton, that finished second in 1982 in WRC. After the character was changed to a Sebastien Loeb-inspired racer, he was first named Sebastien.
*Raoul ÇaRoule is one of the racecars who did not have their engine explode in any of the races. However he does end up in the pileup caused by [[Shu Todoroki]].
*Raoul is the slowest World Grand Prix racer, with the top speed of 124.3&nbsp;mph as mentioned, as he's usually shown in the back of the pack. Despite that he's usually seen ahead of Rip Clutchgoneski and was seen in front of Miguel Camino during the Porto Corsa race. At the start of the Tokyo race, he was seen in the 4th or 5th positions. However, despite his slow speed, he is incredibly fast on dirt.
*In the DS version of [[Cars 2: The Video Game|''Cars 2: The Video Game'']], Raoul's engine is exploded by [[Grem]] at the Germany race.
*Raoul's last name, ÇaRoule, literally means in French "It Rolls", which could be translated more in context as "to go fast."
*His hauler is named [[Andre]], who never appeared in the movie, but instead it has been released as a Stunt Racers playset.
