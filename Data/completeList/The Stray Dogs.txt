'''Rufus, Alfred and Ford''' are minor antagonists from Disney's [[1955]] animated feature film, ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.

== Appearances ==
===''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''===
Rufus, Alfred, and Fordâ€™s only appearance in the film is after [[Lady]] runs away after being muzzled by [[Aunt Sarah]]. She ends up in the trainyard alley where they reside. The three suddenly emerge, begin chasing, and viciously barking at her. However, [[Tramp]] notices what is going on and rushes after the dogs. The strays corner Lady in a dead-end alleyway, but Tramp intervenes and manages to distract and fight off all three of them before they could attack Lady.

==Trivia==
*Much of their barking was recycled audio from the [[Hunter Dogs]] in ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''.
