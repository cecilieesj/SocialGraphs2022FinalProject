The '''Carnivorous Plant''' is a character featured in [[Mystic Manor]].

==History==

===Background===
The carnivorous plant is described an oversized Venus flytrap<ref><small>As seen in the Mystic Manor guide seen in the attraction's queue, one of the exhibits featured in the Solarium section is labeled as ''''Venus flytrap'''"</small></ref> with a monstrous-looking appearance. It lives in the Solarium area of the Mystic Manor attraction. When Albert begins playing with the two of its miniature heads, the bigger plant turns its head and ferociously roars and attempts to attack the guests but misses. 

==Role in Mystic Manor==
The large carnivorous plant and its two miniature heads are featured in the Solarium area where it attempts to distract Albert with its smaller heads and the largest head prepares to attack the guests. The plant then roars at the guests just as the vehicles arrive at the Slavic-Nordic Chamber. Because it is a trackless ride each time guests ride the attraction after passing the Solarium, the guests will still arrive at the Slavic-Nordic Chamber albeit on a mirrored scene. The next scene where guests see Albert shows that the plant failed to catch him.

After Albert finally closes the [[Balinese Music Box|music box]], all the artifacts in the Mystic Manor are brought to their lifeless forms, so it is likely that the Carnivorous Plant and its smaller heads in the Solarium were reverted to motionless forms.

==Trivia==
*A man-eating plant was one of the ideas originally going to be used as an exhibit for the unbuilt [[Museum of the Weird]] attraction prior to the project being canceled with some of the ideas later ending up in the [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]] attraction.
*While the Mystic Manor attraction does not feature any ghosts, the Solarium area where the Carnivorous Plant lives is a possible reference to the conservatory scene from the original Haunted Mansion attraction.
