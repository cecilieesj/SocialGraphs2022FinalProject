====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Rasheed attends the Islamic Masjid of Jersey City. When nominations open up for the Mosque Board, Rasheed puts himself forward as an applicant.

He attends the mosque, with his best friend [[Yusuf Khan|Yusuf]], and the pair sit in the front row, while the [[Sheikh Abdullah|Sheikh]] is giving his lecture. In the middle of his sermon, the Sheikh asks two of the girls, sitting behind the partition to keep quiet, and Rasheed turns around, when [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], Yusuf's daughter, expresses how it's difficult to concentrate, when they can't see him.

After the lecture is over, Rasheed can be seen conversing with Yusuf and other members of the mosque.

He attends the Eid Al-Adha festival, when [[Nakia Bahadir]] hands Yusuf a poster, in favor of her vote, for the Mosque Board. Rasheed sees this and questions what Yusuf is doing. That evening, Rasheed and the others attendants of the festival are alerted to the screams of a young boy, and find [[Hameed]], hanging by a curtain from the window of the mosque tower. He watches in fear, as Hameed falls, but the heroine Night Light arrives, and creates an energy cronstructs mid-air, which Hameed safetly lands on. Before Hameed can safetly climb onto the roof, the construct shatters, so Night quickly creates various smaller constructs, to cushion his fall. Nonetheless, Hameed gets injured, afer falling onto the hood fo a car, and Rasheed and the others in the crowd, gather around him.
