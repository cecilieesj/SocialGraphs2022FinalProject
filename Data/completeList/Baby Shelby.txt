'''Shelby the Turtle''', commonly referred to as '''Baby Shelby''', is a green turtle who first appeared in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===
Shelby makes his debut in the cartoon "[[Donald's Shell Shots]]" where Shelby is meant to take a photo at the mall. However, [[Donald Duck|Donald]] is the photographer and matches wits with Shelby. Shelby would later go on to star as an adversary for the duck much like [[Chip and Dale]] or his nephews. Shelby also went on with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] in the cartoon "[[Babysitters]]".

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Shelby is often seen causing trouble for [[Donald Duck]], or rare to [[Mickey Mouse]]. He doesn't speak, but he is famous for his trademark laugh. He also can speak in thought as seen in "[[Donald's Pool]]". Shelby's mother, [[Mrs. Turtle]], is overprotective of her son and will often yell if she can't find him, or if she gives someone an order.

==Trivia==
*Baby Shelby resembles a child turtle in the Pluto cartoon "[[Pluto's Surprise Package]]". It could be possible that this is in fact the "prototype" Shelby as they look exactly alike with different color schemes.
