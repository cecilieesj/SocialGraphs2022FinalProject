'''Mpishi''' is a harrier hawk that served as the main antagonist in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' episode, [[Ono and the Egg]].

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Mpishi is a well-built harrier hawk with grey feathers, with some white and a few black feathers on her underbelly. Her wings are also black toward the tip. Her beak is white, tipped with black. Orange surrounds the bottom part of her brown eyes. Her legs and talons are also orange with black claws

===Personality===
Mpishi is described as a "gourmet", eager to try new food, mainly small animals like tree hyraxes, red rock hares, bats, chameleons, snakes, and even baby hammerkops. She also has a great dislike for carrion, preferring her food to be fresh.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Ono and the Egg]]''===
Mpishi tried all the food in her territory to which she decides to try out fresh food instead, to which she went to the [[Pride Lands]] to eat fresh food. She first chases hyraxes and catches one and attempts to eat him. [[Ono]] chases hers and tells her to drop the hyrax, but she misunderstands and says doesn't want to share it. Ono pulls one of her tail feathers to distract her, causing Mpishi to crash into a cliff and eventually saves the innocent hyrax from his demise. [[Kion]] asks her why she's in the Pride Lands, to which she says she came to try new food in the landscape around her. Kion tells Mpishi that here in the Pride Lands, all the animals respect the Circle of Life as he tells her to return to her territory. Mpishi lies saying she'll go after she catches something new.

Mpishi next appears hunting during a storm, where she spots some red rock hares trying to escape a mudslide and goes after them. When the [[Lion Guard]] shows up, she stops, but realizes she has an advantage as they're not watching the rest of the animals then leaves.

Mpishi later flies around the area where Ono and [[Ona|the newly hatched hammerkop]] were resting at, but couldn't find anything to eat there. She then noticed [[Mwoga]] flying behind her and accusingly asked if he was following her. He admitted that he was and that where she was going, there would be leftovers for him. She agreed and stated that hawks like her were excellent hunters. After introducing each other, Mwoga asked Mpishi what she was doing in the Pride Lands and outside her territory. She explained that she tried all the food in her territory, she went here to try something new to eat, but the Lion Guard kept preventing her from doing so. She stated that she could use some help outwitting them and asked Mwoga if he would like a fresh meal.

While trying to rescue the newly hatched hammerkop, the Guard, along with help from [[Kulinda]], decides to rescue her only for her to be captured by Mpishi. The Guard decides to find Mpishi and stop her from eating Kulinda's daughter to which Ono and Kulinda work together to stop Mpishi from eating her the baby hammerkop only for Mpishi to throw her into Mwoga. Devising a plan to stop Mpishi and Mwoga, [[Bunga]] climbs a tree to the top to tackle Mwoga just the Kion tells him to return to [[the Outlands]] just as Kulinda and Ono fly into Mpishi, defeating her and reuniting Kulinda with her daughter once again and telling Mpishi to leave the Pride Lands at once before she breaks the Circle of Life. Following his orders, Mpishi retreats to her territory.

==Relationships==
===Friends===
====[[Mwoga]]====
Mpishi was at first cautious of Mwoga, who silently followed her without a word. After learning that the vulture as merely hoping to score a meal, she relaxed.

The two appear to get along very well, and have been shown capable of accepting each other's opinions on food, agreeing to disagree on what is "[[A Real Meal]]."  They are also happy to team up, and work well with coordinating their movements and improvising when necessary. 

===Enemies===
====[[Ono]]====
Ono never liked Mpishi as when he first met her, as she invaded the Pride Lands and attempted to eat a hyrax there. She later kidnaps Ona, but this time, with the help of Mwoga. They nearly succeed in eating her until he and Kulinda work together to defeat her, upon which he demands Mpishi to leave. Mpishi has not tried to steal another animal from the Pride Lands ever since as she believes no food is "worth the aggravation", and hasn't dealt with the egret since and looks like she won't any time soon.

====[[Kulinda]]====
Kulinda dislikes Mpishi, since she does her antagonistic attempt in trying to kidnap and have Kulinda's chick Ona for her next meal. But thanks to Ono's help she was able to drive her off saving Kulinda's chick.

====[[Ona]]====
As a predator of the harrier hawk, Mpishi once tried to eat Ona. Despite this, Ona was unaware of her cruel intentions, and saw much of the sky high frolics as an adventure.

====[[Kion]], [[Bunga]], [[Fuli]] and [[Beshte]]====
When Mpishi tries to get a delicious meal in the Pride Lands, she first goes after Pim but the Guard comes and stops her. She also sees hares almost being trapped in a mudslide. Mpishi tries to get one thinking no one will see it missing until the guard shows up again. Later, she goes after Kulinda's baby Ona but the guard stops her a third time.
