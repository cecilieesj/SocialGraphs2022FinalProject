==Personality==
Vince is the most athletic student at [[Third Street School]] and is very popular. He can also get very competitive at times. He and [[T.J. Detweiler|T.J.]] are the closest friends in the whole gang, and he's considered his "right hand". He is also one of the most sarcastic members of the gang, along with T.J. and [[Ashley Spinelli|Spinelli]]. His rival when it comes to sports is [[Erwin Lawson]], the school bully. However, unlike Vince, Lawson is more of a sore loser and unintelligent. He often stands up to bullies on the playground, making him very well-respected among the other students.

He has an older brother in the eighth grade named Chad, who was considered one of the coolest kids in school. However, in reality, he is actually a nerd. Everyone on the playground is surprised until Chad stands up to a bully who's troubling the main six.

==Trivia==
*Along with T.J. and Spinelli, he is one of the only kids in the gang with a sibling.
*In some episodes, Vince seems to have a crush on both of his female friends in the main six, Spinelli (who's confirmed to have a crush on T.J.) and [[Gretchen Grundler|Gretchen]] (who may feel the same way about Vince).
*According to the creators, he's considered to be the most attractive of the boys of the main six.
*In the 1996 unaired pilot, he had a different hairstyle and outfit. He went through ten different hairstyles until the creators decided on one.
*In Japanese, Vince is voiced by Miyu Irino, who also voiced [[Sora]] in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.
