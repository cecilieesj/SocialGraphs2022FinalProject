'''Tommy Maximoff''' is a character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] who is featured in the [[Marvel Studios|Marvel]] [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]''. An alternate version of the character, originating from Earth-838, was featured in ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.

He is the son of [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision]], and older twin brother of [[Billy Maximoff]]. He was conceived through the effects of Wanda's chaos magic, which also granted him super-speed, similar to his [[Quicksilver|uncle]]. Tommy was born in [[Westview]], following his mothers accelerated pregnancy, and further aged himself up. As each episode passed, he adapted into a new time period, staring from the 1970s, to the present. After Wanda removed the Hex that barricaded the town, Tommy and his brother were seemingly erased from existence. He first appears in the third episode, "[[Now in Color]]", and is portrayed by Gavin Borders and Jett Klyne.

Tommy Maximoff was created by Steve Englehart and Richard Howell.

==Background==
===Personality===
At a young age, Tommy is shown to be mischievous and boisterous. His behavior was only amplified, by his "uncle", whom he looks up to, a great deal. He believes himself to be the cooler of the twins, and enjoys activities, which often lead into him getting into trouble. Despite this, he also has a caring side. He immediately noticed, the troubled look on his brothers face, when Tommy sensed Vision was in danger, and went on to call his mother, without knowledge of what was happening. While he gets into squabbles with his brother, ultimately, he cares about the well being of his family.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''Age Acceleration''': The ability to age at a rapid speed, faster than normal. Tommy first displayed this power in the womb, during his mothers pregnancy with him, and his twin brother. The pair seem to have control on it, as they were able to age themselves up by five years, willingly.
*'''Super Speed''': The ability to run at an accelerated rate, much faster than an average person.

==Appearances==
===''[[WandaVision]]''===
Following [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] and [[Vision]]'s arrival into [[Westview]], Wanda quickly becomes pregnant. Her powers speed up the process of pregnancy, and she gives birth, not long after, with the help of [[Monica Rambeau|Geraldine]]. When Vision returns home, she hands the baby over to him, and he names the boy Tommy. Unexpectedly, Wanda gives birth to [[Billy Maximoff|another son]], afterwards unaware she was pregnant with twins. The Doctor declares the babies healthy, and Wanda puts them to sleep, in a crib. When they begin crying, she sings a Sokovian lullaby to lull them. After Geraldine leaves, the twins are picked up by Wanda and Vision, who hold them while watching TV.

Wanda tries to soothe Tommy, who is refusing to sleep. She rocks him up and down in her arms, alongside Vision, who is holding Billy. She places him in his crib, alongside his brother, and tries to hush the twins, by giving them pacifiers, but they both spit them out, and continue crying. Agnes arrives and attempts to put the babies to sleep. She prays lavender, on them, which is supposed to have a calming effect. While Wanda and Vision begin talking privately, the twins leave their crib, and age up to five years. Their parents greet them, and Wanda picks up Tommy. During some time, Tommy and Billy come across a stray dog, and take him in. They place him in the kitchen sink, to clean him off, and Billy voices his concern for the dog, who seems not to like the water, but Tommy insists they have to clean him, so their mother will let them keep him. Wanda enters the kitchen, and Tommy and Billy quickly stand in front of the sink, in an attempt to hide it, but she finds him anyway, after hearing it bark. Wanda asks what he's doing there, and Tommy innocently states hes in the doggie paddle. When Billy asks if they can keep him, Wanda informs them of the responsibilities required in looking after a dog. Vision arrives in the kitchen and greets his family. At the same time, [[Agatha Harkness|Agnes]] arrives, with a kennel, Tommy and Billy can give the dog. She asks if they named him, and after the dog begins messing with an electric socket, causing sparks to fly, they settle on Sparky, as suggested by Agnes. Wanda conjures a collar, and hands it over to Tommy, to place on the dog. Billy asks Vision if Sparky is their dog, but their parents affirm, that they don't think the pair will be able to be responsible for a dog, until they're ten years old. Tommy and Billy look at each other, smiling, and the twins age up, another five years, now reaching ten years old. Tommy and Wanda, later watch Billy perform tricks, he trained Sparky to do. They applaud him, and Tommy insists on showing their father, but Wanda reveals that he's at work, as he was in need of a distraction. Tommy asks questions what he needed a distraction from, and when Billy asks is it was from them, Wanda explains to them, that as a couple, they aren't always on the same page, but it's temporary, and compares her relationship, to theirs, because, despite their fights, they will always be brothers, because family is forever. Tommy asks if Wanda had a brother, and she tells them, she does, but he is far away from them, which makes her sad. While she is talking, Sparky runs to the door and begins barking. Wanda opens it, and Sparky runs out, so Tommy, Billy and Wanda follow, to see where he went, and the three see an imaging drone in the air. A voice emerges from it, asking their mother to talk with them. Once the drone is gone, Tommy and Billy walk around the neighborhood, searching for their pet. They run into Dennis the Mailman, who reassures them their mother wont let him get far, and when they reach Agnes' house, they find her emerging from her bushes, holding Sparky, dead and covered in a sheet. She claims she didn't want to come, until she wrapped him up, and explains he died, after eating leaves from her azalea bushes. She apologizes to Tommy and Billy, who begin crying, and Wanda quickly goes to them, urging the pair, not to age themselves up. She explains that she knows the urge to run from their grief is powerful. Tommy, expresses that his mother can fix anything, and asks her to fix the dead. Wanda tells them, there are rules in life, and they cant rush aging, because it's convenient, or reverse death. Billy tells her, she stated family was forever, and Tommy adds, that Sparky was a part of their family, and asks her to being him back. Vision arrives and console his sons.

Tommy appears, in the sixth episode's opening sequence, with a camera in hand, going through his house, and filming various characters. Billy addresses the audience, about the sentimental aspects of Halloween, but Tommy dismisses this, and concentrates on the candy, as well as getting to scare people. Billy asks Tommy where his costume is, and he tells him, he is already dressed, as the cool twin, before labeling him, a "dorkasaurus-rex". They stumble upon their uncle, asleep on the couch, and Tommy, who holds Pietro in high regard, even admires the way he snores. He tells Billy he is going to wake him up, but Billy tells him not to, as he is afraid Pietro is a vampire. The twins begin bickering on whether or not this is true, when Pietro runs towards them, with his super speed, mimicing a vampire, and begins chasing them, also drawing the attention to their mother. Wanda walks down in her Halloween costume, and tells the boys, she's dressed as a Sokovian fortune teller. Pietro begins commenting on this, and Tommy labels it as "cool", before Pietro calls it lame, and Tommy retracts his last comment, and repeats what Pietro said. The three of them then proceed to playing video games and drink soda, when Vision discloses to Wanda that he can't go trick-or-treating with them. Pietro hears this, and offers to take his place. After Vision leaves, Pietro asks where she keeps her water balloons, so he can fill them with shaving cream, and blames the idea on Tommy, whom he incorrectly calls Billy. When Wanda points out Pietro isn't even wearing a costume, he scoffs, takes Tommy's hand, and the pair both return, with matching outfits, in a matter of seconds. They begin trick-or-treating, and Pietro uses his super speed, to help Tommy and Billy get candy at a faster rate, but they also begin smashing jack-o'-lanterns and covering people in silly string, so Wanda makes them return the candy they took. They later find someone, giving away full-sized candy bars, and Tommy goes to tell Pietro, while Billy asks his mother, if they can go. As he does, Tommy displays super speed, and runs to the house and back, in a second, to the excitement of his family, and in particular Pietro, who's abilities, he seems to have inherited. Wanda tells him he can take it slow, but Tommy is hyper with excitement, and begins running circles around her. She pulls him aside, and tells Tommy to take his brother with him, to his disappointment, and before they leave, she tells the pair not to go past Ellis Avenue. Later, Tommy runs in his brothers direction direction, but Billy manages to stop his speed, with his hand, showcasing he has new powers too. Tommy marvels at this, but Billy shushes him, while trying to concentrate, and Tommy asks if he's okay. Billy suddenly runs for his mother, and Tommy follows. Billy tells Wanda that Vision is in trouble, and Pietro makes a witty retort, on Vision can't die twice. This angers Wanda, and she uses her powers to blast Pietro, to Tommy's shock. He watches on, as Billy uses his powers to locate their fathers whereabouts.

[[File:WandaVision Episode 7 Photo 3.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
The morning passes, and Tommy and Billy begin play video games. As they do so, the controllers, alter into older versions, before changing into joysticks, and then turning into Uno cards. The pair head to their mothers room and Tommy asks if she's going to come down. Tommy wonders whether their mother is sleeping, and she tells the boys she's resting her eyes. When Billy complains about hearing noises, she repeats that she's resting her eyes, so they return downstairs. They fight over a Wii remote, when Wanda comes down, in her robe, and she walks past them, without intervening. The pair exchange a look, between each other, seeing their mother in this state. While Tommy and Billy play video games, Wanda asks if the boys have seen their dad. Tommy replies they haven't and Billy suggests they go look for him, but Wanda simply tells them that if he doesn't want to be there, there's nothing they can do. She tells the boys that the man they thought was their uncle, is actually an impostor, and when Tommy asks who he is, she fails to give an answer. She confesses to them, that as their mother, they expect her to have all the answers, and she has none, and emphasizes this point. She admits she's starting to believe everything is meaningless and, Tommy and Billy look at each other, in concern. A knock is heard and Agnes arrives. She grows worried upon viewing Wanda's behavior, and suggests taking the boys. Tommy and Billy are reluctant to go, but Wanda claims she'll be fine. The boys settle on Agnes' couch, and and she sits inbetween them. Tommy asks if she thinks their mother will be okay, and Agnes reassures the two, that they don't have to worry, because Wanda can do anything and she's a super-mom.

Unbeknownst to Billy and Tommy, Agnes is an alias, used by the witch, Agatha Harkness. She takes the twins hostage, and uses them to blackmail Wanda. When she refuses to cooperate with her, Agatha conjures the screams of Tommy and Billy, who beg for their mother. When Agatha learns of Wanda's true nature, she returns to Tommy and Billy, and places them in a choke, with a magical wire attached their throats, as she levitates in the air. Wanda reaches them, and the boys call out for her, pleading for that she save them. Agatha strengthens her hold on the boys, and confronts Wanda, as she continues choking them.

[[File:WandaVision Episode 9 Photo 4.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Agatha lands on the ground, and the boys attempt to run towards their mother, but she pulls the wires against their throat back, pushing them, onto the ground. Wanda blasts her back, and orders them to return to their room, though the pair insist on helping, until Agatha rises back, and urges them to listen to their mother. She instructs the twins to leave, and Tommy uses his speed, to take himself and his brother away. They try peering through the window, to see if they can catch their parents in action, when Tommy notices Billy's unusual behavior. He asks his brother what's wrong, and Billy reveals he had a vision of his mother in trouble, prompting them to leave her for assistance. While on their way, Wanda begins lowering the barrier that surrounds Westview. As Tommy and Billy are the result of Wanda's magic, they too, begin fading, with the Hex. The boys fall to the ground, shouting for their mothers help, and upon seeing them, she restores the Hex to its original state, also restoring them back in the process. The boys reach their parents, and Wanda shields them from an attack by Agatha, in turn, losing some of her power to the witch, also resulting in her hands regressing. Agatha swoops in, while White Vision and [[S.W.O.R.D.]] also arrive on scene. Wanda and Vision tell the pair that while they may not have prepared them for this fight, they were born for it. Vision takes on his white counterpart, while Wanda battles Agatha, and she has them handle the military. The men leave their vehicles, and aim their firearms, so Billy uses his power, to immobilize the agents, while Tommy runs besides the agents and disarms them. The pair however, fail to see Director Hayward, who leaves his car, and tries shooting at them, when [[Monica Rambeau]], jumps in front, to protect them. Tommy watches as the bullets pass through her, emerging without their momentum,. Monica praises the boys powers, and Billy returns the compliment, while Tommy smiles at his brother. Vision exits the library, having ended his conflict with his white counterpart, and the boys reunite in their fathers arms. Tommy observes, Wanda and Agnes take their battle into the sky, with Agatha appearing to be on the triumphant side, as she drains Wanda's magic, leaving her almost lifeless. Tommy and Billy call out for her, and Vision pulls their faces into his chest, to shield them. Wanda manages to best Agatha, transforming into the Scarlet Witch, and returns the two to the ground, victorious in battle. With the conflict resolved, Tommy witness her transform Agatha, into her fake persona of Agnes. They run to embrace her, and the family return home. Vision puts Billy to bed and comments on the day they've had. Wanda and Vision tell the boys they're proud of them, and she reminds the two that a family is forever, and they couldn't truly leave each other, even if they tried. She and Vision kiss the boys goodnight, and before they leave, Wanda thanks the boys for choosing her to be their mother. She shuts off the lights, and closes the door, as Tommy and Billy prepare for bed. As they do, the Hex begins drawing in on itself, until it eventually disappears, and Tommy and Billy, seemingly fade away from existence.

Sometime after this, Wanda begins studying the ''Darkhold'' while astral projecting, and she hears the cries of Billy and Tommy, calling out for her.
