'''Meg and Peg''' are identical twin sisters who appear in the ''[[Sofia the First]]''. They often get mixed up for one another, though they claim to be completely different. They were the newest members of [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia's]] [[Buttercups|Buttercups troop]] until Amber joined.

Meg and Peg make their second appearance in the episode, "[[Mystic Meadows]]" along with the other Buttercups as they visit the retirement home for retired sorcerers. In "[[Buttercup Amber]]" they have shown that they can act independent of one another, seeing as one spotted Mossy and the other stood there in shock.

==Trivia==
*Technically, Meg's full name is "Megan."
*Peg's name came from the French word for a daisy or a pearl.
*They are voiced by the same person who originally voiced [[Ruby Hanshaw|Ruby]] in ''[[Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess]]'', who like them is also a Buttercups scout and friend of [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]]. Fiona Bishop also voices a Princess.
*Meg and Peg are the second twins to appear in the series, the first was [[Princess Amber|Amber]] and [[Prince James|James]] who are also fraternal twins. Also, the second twins to have blond hair.
*For some reason, they are always shown wearing their Buttercup uniforms even when not on Buttercup missions.
