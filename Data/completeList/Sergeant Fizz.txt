==Background==
===Personality===
Sergeant Fizz is a by-the-book, no-nonsense Genie Patrolman. He follows all 204 Genie rules to the letter and expects all Genies to follow this lead. He has also taken it upon himself to enforce the rules. As the sole member of the Genie Patrol, he is shown to have superb detective skills as shown when he deduced where Kazeem would head after spotting a birthday party.

==Appearances==

=== ''[[disney:Sofia_the_First|Sofia the First]]'' ===
Fizz first appears in "[[New Genie on the Block]]" after [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] enters the Genie Patrol's HQ and confirms he's the only one on the Patrol. After hearing about [[Kazeem]] and how he went rogue, he makes Sofia his partner and together they take off to him. The two find him at a birthday party granting wishes. Fizz explains the Genie Rules to him like how he can only grant three wishes for the one who let him out and demands he get back in his lamp but the young genie refuses to listen and flies off. The pair chases after him until Kazeem tricks some kids into making a wish that traps Fizz in his lamp leaving Sofia to deal with Kazeem herself since a Jinn spell can only be undone by the genie who cast the spell. The trapped Fizz urged Sofia not to give up and told her she could find a way to stop the young jinn.

Sofia eventually gets Kazeem to obey her and Fizz is released from Kazeem's lamp via Sofia's first wish. Fizz is pleased when Kazeem apologizes to him and is even more so when he undoes all his other wishes via Sofia's second wish and when Sofia uses her final wish to make him a member of the Genie Patrol.

== Trivia ==
* Sergeant Fizz, being a member of the Genie Patrol with Kazeem, after a while began to treat him like a son, but he did not show it to the outside, only showing his attachment to him. However, he was very happy that Kazeem returned to him after purging him of Omar's crimes.
