'''Devon''' is a minor character in [[Pixar]]'s [[2022]] animated feature film, ''[[Turning Red]]''. He is a clerk at the Daisy Mart, who [[Mei Lee|Mei]] has a brief crush on.

==Background==
===Personality===
Devon is a store clerk at the Daisy Mart, and appears to be a typical apathetic teenager. There isn't much to know about him, but he is presented to be a tired, overworked teen, who barely gets surprised unless something weird is presented to him.

He is also known as the average e-boy who is only surviving on Ramen noodles and is very tired and overworked. Although by [[Ming Lee|Ming]], he is described as a person who "doesn't wear sunblock and does drugs all day".

===Physical appearance===
Devon is a 17-year-old boy with fair skin, a large nose, freckles scattered across his face and bags under his blue eyes. He has dark brown hair that is covered by a light blue, camouflage bucket hat and wears small, silver hoop earrings, and a puka shell bead necklace. Devon is seen wearing his Daisy Mart uniform with his name tag, which consists of a light blue polo shirt with a maroon collar, sleeve trims, and wide vertical lines on the sides. He also wears jeans and flip-flops. 

==Trivia==
*Given that he is at the [[4*Town|4★Town]] concert, it could mean his tired expression was due to working overtime to be able to afford a ticket.
