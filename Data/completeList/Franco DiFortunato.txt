==Background==
===Personality===
Franco DiFortunato is a mischievous, crafty, and witty showman with a gambling motif. He's full of himself and his powers. He promises the Tremaines that they can win big or lose it all. He flatters Lady Tremaine and compliments her on her wickedness frequently. Franco doesn't seem to care much for Anastasia or Drizella. When Cinderella and Prince Charming reunite, he forces the Tremaines to be his servants for the rest of their lives. He runs off to bargain with an evil queen being chased by seven dwarfs up a mountain. Despite it all he seems to be something of a magical slimy businessman first, villain second, speaking rather friendly with Cinderella and the Prince after they reunite and he curses her step-family. His business card says, "Need a happy ending? Would you like to win the lotto? To change your luck or make a buck, call Franco Difortunato!"
===Powers===
Franco DiFortunato has considerable magic skill at his disposal. He turned back time to before Cinderella was able to put on the [[Glass Slipper]], and shrunk her to the size of a mouse. The shrinking spell was undone by the Fairy Godmother. His greatest act of magic was to turn Anastasia and Drizella into graceful, beautiful women, but this failed to prevent Cinderella from meeting Prince Charming. When these attempts failed, Franco cursed the Tremaines to be his servants for life.

===Songs===
Franco sings "''[[It's Never Too Late]]''", parts of "[[In a Moment]]", and "It's Never Too Late" (Reprise).
