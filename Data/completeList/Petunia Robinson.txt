She is a hand puppet controlled by [[Fritz Robinson|Fritz]].

==Physical appearance ==
Petunia is a wooden hand puppet with tan skin, short auburn hair, and black eyes with purple eyelashes. The light blue stuff on her arms resembles a spring toy. She is seen wearing blue stud earrings and a green sleeveless dress with a white collar and two red buttons in the middle.

==Trivia==

*Since she's a puppet on [[Fritz Robinson|Fritz]]'s hand, there are several ideas what this could mean:
**She's a split personality in Fritz's mind and the puppet is just a way to focus the personality.
** It actually has a human mind inside it, but Fritz needs to move it so she can speak.
**It's a substitute for his wife, who has either died or divorced him and left him mentally shattered.
* Given that Fritz has two children, Tallulah and Laszlo, the 3rd seems more accurate, although they could be adopted.
**The second, while possible, is unlikely, due to Fritz generally speaking out of this corner of the mouth, while he moves the puppet.
*When she goes for a drive, she usually takes the Harley, according to [[Bud Robinson|Grampa Bud]].﻿

==Quotes==

*"Don't you sweetie me! I'm going for a drive!"
