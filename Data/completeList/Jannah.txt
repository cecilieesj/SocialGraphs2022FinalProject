'''Jannah''' (formerly known as '''TZ-1719''') is a supporting character introduced in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''. Like [[Finn]], Jannah is a former [[First Order Stormtroopers|First Order Stormtrooper]] who lived on Kef Bir after her defection. Upon meeting Finn and his comrades, Jannah and her group of other defected stormtroopers joined the [[Resistance]] in their fight against the [[Sith Eternal]] and [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]].

==Background==
Taken from her family as a child by the [[First Order]], Jannah, known as TZ-1719, was trained to be [[First Order Stormtroopers|stormtrooper]]. While being groomed as a stormtrooper, TZ-1719 was trained in archery under the tutelage of [[Captain Phasma]].

During the Battle of Ansett Island, TZ-1719 and a group of stormtroopers were ordered to fire on civilians. However, instead of obeying their orders, TZ-1719 and the stormtroopers saw how innocent the civilians were and refused to kill them, seeing how evil the organization they served in truly was. This caused TZ-1719 and her group of stormtroopers to defect from the First Order where they settled on the planet of Kef Bir, with TZ-1719, taking the name "Jannah."

===Personality===
As a former stormtrooper for the [[First Order]], Jannah has a sense of honor and justice. When ordered to kill a group of innocent civilians, Jannah refused and disgusted with the First Order's cruelty, defected from the remnants of the [[Galactic Empire]].

==Trivia==
* Jannah is the second known stormtrooper to defect the [[First Order]] in the sequel trilogy, the first being Finn.
** Jannah is also the second known stormtrooper to be a female, the first being [[Captain Phasma]].
* Jannah is the first supporting female character to be black.
*John Boyega on his twitter account, and Naomi Ackie in an interview, confirmed that Finn and Jannah have a romantic interest in each other in ''Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker''.<ref name = "Vanity Fair">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-naomi-ackie-jannah-interview|title=Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Naomi Ackie Knows What You’re Thinking About Jannah and Finn|website=Vanity Fair|date=December 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name ="tweet">{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/JohnBoyega/status/1256623980196347905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1256623980196347905&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscreenrant.com%2Fstar-wars-rise-skywalker-finn-loves-jannah-rey%2F|author=Boyega, John|title=This warrior stole Finn’s heart after 9.
