'''Myrna Jablonski''' is a character featured on ''[[Raven's Home]]''. She was the owner of the [[Apartment Building|apartment building]], and makes her only appearance in "[[The Baxters Get Bounced]]". She is portrayed by Peggy Miley.

==History==
At an unknown point in time, Myrna has a child, whom she calls [[Mr. Jablonski|Phil]]. Unknown circumstances lead her to raising the child by herself. She is the owner of an [[Apartment Building|apartment building]] but eventually retires making her son the landlord.

One day while resting in her apartment, she wakes to find two children have snuck in, looking for their drone. They are initially frightened by her, but they get over their fears after realizing she's just a normal woman and not a witch. Myrna bonds with [[Tess]] and [[Levi Grayson|Levi]] over cake and showing her family albums to them, and organises a game of mahjongg with Levi for later. She, however, discovers Levi left his drone, and so goes to the apartment to return it to him, only to find her son Phil tied up. She witnesses them explain themselves, and how they are unable to pay the rent, and before her son can throw the family out, Myrna intervenes forbidding her son to do so, or raise the rent, commenting on how she too was a single mother and wishes she had a best friend to help her. She later invites everyone at 3B over to her apartment, and three mothers bond of photos of their children.

Sometime later, she sells the building to Mitch.

==Trivia==
*She had a reputation of being a witch by some of the other tenants, including [[Tess]] and [[Raven Baxter|Raven]].
