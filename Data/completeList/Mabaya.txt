==Role in the series==
Like all rogues, Mabaya is almost constantly angry and tramples anything that he sees for almost no apparent reason. He is easily recognized by his broken right tusk and glowing red eyes. How he became rogue is unknown. Some say he inherited it or that it is because of a terrible childhood or he ate something toxic. Its also possible that he has some kind of sickness. Episodes featuring Mabaya usually require [[Tantor]] to overcome his fears and face down the renegade in an elephantine match of strength.

In "[[Tarzan and the Rogue Elephant]]", after Mabaya plows through an elephant herd, Jabari and many other elephants are forced to move to where [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] lives to escape its path. Jabari befriends Tantor and they bond over their mutual fear of things; however, when Jabari says that the African Violet causes an elephant to go rogue, Tantor (who has eaten these flowers for years) is convinced he is a rogue, and even more so after Mabaya stampedes through the jungle, causing him to run away. Jabari learns that the flower doesn't make an elephant go rogue and Tarzan has gone after Mabaya, finding himself no match for the rogue elephant. Tantor must overcome his fears to help both his friend and the jungle.

In "[[Tarzan and the Missing Link]]", he returns to get revenge.

==Trivia==
*Unlike the other elephant characters in the series, Mabaya never says a word and only roars.
*His name means 'evil' in Swahili
*The term "rogue (bull) elephant" is simply a myth, it's basically bull elephants in a periodical state called "musth", which is an Indian word for "intoxicated".
