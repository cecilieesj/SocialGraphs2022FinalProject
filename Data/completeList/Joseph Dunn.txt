Joseph wanted to prove to David that he is invulnerable by trying to shoot at him with a gun. David yelled at his son and disarmed the gun.

16 years after Elijah Price got arrested, Joseph decided to help his father with his superhero career.

As Joseph told David the information, David died from drowning.
