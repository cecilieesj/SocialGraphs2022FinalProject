'''Prince Edward of Andalasia''' is the tritagonist in Disney's [[2007]] feature film, ''[[Enchanted]]''. He is both voiced and portrayed by [[James Marsden]], and is one of the only characters to be portrayed in live-action and animation.

==Background==
Prince Edward was raised in [[Andalasia]] and born to a royal family. After his mother died, his father the King married [[Queen Narissa|Narissa]] which made her the queen of Andalasia. But when his father died, she feared for the day that Edward would get married, and she would lose the throne forever. So she forced him to hunt down trolls with his servant [[Nathaniel]].

===Personality===
{{Dialogue2|Narissa|Don't you think that's a bit melodramatic, dear?|Edward|I don't know what 'melodramatic' means.|attr=Narissa to Edward}}Edward is handsome and brave, but a little clumsy when he enters [[New York City]]. He is also somewhat slow. He is set on his goal to find and bring [[Giselle]] back home to get married and presumably live happily ever after. He is described by James Marsden as "very pure, very simple-minded and naive but innocently narcissistic."

While Giselle and Edward appear to be perfect for each other at first, it turns out they do not have many things in common. Edward had a tendency for violence (misguided or not), while Giselle herself did not. In addition, he was not as intelligent as Giselle herself, as while Edward was not able to understand Pip after he came with him to New York City, Giselle was able to understand him perfectly. And while Edward intended to protect Giselle, he also planned to kill Robert in order to do so, something she herself would never do.

Ultimately, he decided that while he and Giselle were not made for each other, he also did not mind marrying someone who was as masculine (if still a woman) as he was.

==Appearances==
===''[[Enchanted]]''===
When we're first introduced to Edward, he's an adventurous young man "hunting trolls" with his assistant, [[Nathaniel]], to whom he confesses that he's actually tired of an active life and wants to settle down. After rescuing Giselle from a troll he declares that they "will be married in the morning". After [[Giselle]] is "banished" to New York, Edward follows with the intent of rescuing her but is unprepared for the urban environment of New York City. He threatens a construction worker believing the man has knowledge of Giselle's disappearance. He disrupts traffic by jumping atop a bus and "slaying" it with his sword (thinking it's a "steel beast", which leaves its driver in fury for stabbing her bus, which is an emotion rare to the citizens of Andalasia), refers to every citizen as a "peasant", gets hit by bicyclists when he breaks into song, mistakes a television for a "magic mirror", and misinterprets [[Pip]]'s warnings about Nathaniel.

After finally finding Giselle, he's perplexed that she doesn't harbor the same feelings she had for him earlier (it turns out that they have less in common that they thought, such as their difference in intellect) but agrees to go on a "date" with her which ends with them going to the "King and Queen's Ball". However [[Queen Narissa|Narissa]], Edward's stepmother appears from Andalasia and tries to kill Giselle by giving her a poison apple. Edward finally learns of Narissa's true evil nature from Nathaniel and threatens to take her back to Andalasia, put her on trial and strip her of her crown. After Giselle and Pip defeat the evil queen (who transformed into a dragon and made off with [[Robert Philip|Robert]], the man Giselle fell in love with) Edward goes back to Andalasia with [[Nancy Tremaine]], a former fiancée of Robert, and they get married and are crowned king and queen of Andalasia.

===''[[Disenchanted]]''===
Nancy and Edward magically appear in Monroeville via a magic wishing well in Giselle's backyard. Upon seeing Giselle's new shambles of a house, he suggests adding a turret with a balcony and a moat.

==Trivia==
*He shares similarities with both [[Prince Eric]] and [[Prince Phillip]] as they both wanted to marry maidens who had beautiful singing voices whom they had only known for a day. However, unlike them, he does not marry his intended "true love" due to his film's more realistic approach to romance.
*He is the second prince to carry off his "true love" on a horse into the sunset. [[The Prince]] is the first.
*James Marsden portrayed the role of Richard White in ''Superman Returns''. While on top of the bus, there is a billboard advertising the film. His co-star [[Amy Adams]] is also known for her role as Lois Lane in ''Man of Steel'' and ''Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice.''
** Interestingly, the ''Superman Returns'' character Marsden portrayed shares [[Richard White|the same name as the voice actor of]] [[Gaston]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.
** In the same sequence, there is an advertisement for the musical ''Hairspray''; in the same year as ''Enchanted'', Marsden portrayed Corny Collins in the film adaptation of the same musical.
*He is the first prince to not end up with the main princess. Instead, Edward ends up with [[Nancy Tremaine]], who was the fianceé of [[Robert Philip]], who ended up with the protagonist [[Giselle]].
