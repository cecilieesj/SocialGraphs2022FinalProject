'''The Woodpecker''' (named ''''Snicklefritz'''' by Timon) is the main antagonist of the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' episode "[[Mozam-Beaked]]". 

==Background==
===Personality===
The Woodpecker is rather funny, clever, and loudmouthed. He can also be rude and annoying to [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]].

===Physical Attributes===
He has the typical appearance of a woodpecker: black with red head feathers and a white belly.

==Role in the show==
==="[[Mozam-Beaked]]"===
While Timon and Pumbaa are taking a nap behind a tree, they find the Woodpecker pecking on it. When the Woodpecker refuses to stop, Timon and Pumbaa try various ways to catch him.

Their first attempt is for Timon to climb up a ladder with Pumbaa guarding it, but the Wodpecker flies down to bother Pumbaa. They do the same for their second attempt, only this time they are using a metal ladder. Their third attempt is using a construction vehicle, their fourth attempt is the bird bath, and their final attempt is for the Woodpecker to peck everything made of wood.

When Timon and Pumbaa finally catch the Woodpecker, the bird tells the two that if they do not let him go, he will have the two of them arrested.

Timon and Pumbaa take a taxi to Bora Bora to throw the Woodpecker into the volcano. The Woodpecker tells the duo that he was only pecking on the tree to catch bugs. So the three go back to the tree and Timon and Pumbaa release the Woodpecker and they try to peck on the tree as well.

==Trivia==
*The Woodpecker was voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]], actor of [[Iago]].
