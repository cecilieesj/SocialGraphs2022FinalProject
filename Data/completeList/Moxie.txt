'''Moxie''' is a student at Kuzco Academy who appears in [[Girls Behaving Oddly|''Girls Behaving Oddly'']].

==Role in the series==
[[Malina]] joins her crowd after she apparently got an A- instead of an A+ on her report card. After Malina realizes that she can still be herself even if she doesn't get all A+'s on her report card, she decides against joining in on scheme with Moxie and her friends.

Eventually, it's revealed by Mr. Purutu that Moxie's a straight-A student like Malina is and turns out to not be as much of a "bad girl" as she portrays herself. When Malina, [[Kuzco]] and [[Kronk]] express surprise at Moxie having a 4.0 GPA, she explains that she prefers to keep her grades a secret to avoid being "hassled" for them.

In the end, Malina and Moxie do become genuine friends, especially once Malina invites Moxie to join the cheerleading squad with her, which Moxie accepts, partly because she needs another extracurricular activity in order to have a better chance of getting accepted into the university she wants to go to after high school.

Moxie was often seen accompanied by two other girls. These two girls make a non-speaking cameo in another episode, but Moxie herself has not appeared again since "[[Girls Behaving Oddly]]".
