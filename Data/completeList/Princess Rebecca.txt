==History==
In "[[Festival of Lights]]", while Rebecca is on a cruise ship with Ari and Miriam, a storm occurs and water starts filling in. Rebecca throws a hook to shore near Avalor and hacks down the mast to make it into a makeshift bridge to the beach. Afterwards, she and her family are allowed in the castle by Elena and her family and welcomed, but they cannot go back to Galonia due to the condition of their ship. Rebecca explains that they were on their way home to celebrate Hanukkah. Miriam reveals that their menorah is still on the ship. Elena offers to help them celebrate Hanukkah, despite being unfamiliar with the tradition. While Miriam sleeps, Rebecca tells Elena and her family all about Hanukkah.

While Ari and Isabel go off to make a dreidel, [[Luisa]] has Elena and Rebecca taste the food. Rebecca is more worried about the sauce because Rebecca said it should be orange, but they have no oranges, so Luisa used Anoki berries. Rebecca and Elena set out to La Vida Dulce for chocolate on Migs and Skylar. Eventually, Elena and Rebecca finish making the chocolate. As the princesses have a snack, a guard comes in and reports that the Galonian ship's cargo has washed up ashore. Elena and Rebecca look for the menorah and finally find it only to find it broken. They take it back to the Palace and to Isabel's workshop to fix it. Elena and Rebecca set everything up outside, but Rebecca sets it up the way her family does it and tests out the dreidels to see which one spins better only to break the menorah into even more pieces than before. When Rebecca sadly tells her grandmother what happened, she is surprised she likes how everything is different: she likes the sauce even better when it is not sweet, and she also likes how the metal dreidel spins for so long. She even likes the menorah Ari and Isabel made and tells her granddaughter that they have to make do with what they have. The royals then celebrate Hanukkah together.

In "[[The Birthday Cruise]]", Rebecca, along with [[Mateo]] and [[Princess Valentina]], are invited by Elena to go on [[Princess Chloe]]'s birthday cruise. They happily welcome Chloe and are determined to make it her special day, but Elena and Rebecca are concerned for Chloe when it becomes clear the activities are bothering her. They eventually wind up in the Foglands, where an evil cursed sea nymph named [[Maliga]] forces them to throw her a party. Rebecca and the others are able to trick her and leave her tied up, but she uses her powers to escape and prevents them from going anywhere. After Chloe offers to stay with Maliga in exchange for her letting her friends go, Maliga has a change of heart and lets Chloe go as well; the curse on Maliga is broken, allowing her to return home. Rebecca and the others accept Chloe for who she is, and they do-over her birthday with what Chloe wants.

In "[[Coronation Day]]", Rebecca, her family, and many other royals congratulate Elena on how far she has come on the day of her coronation and 20th birthday. However, Avalor winds up falling into the hands of the [[Four Shades of Awesome]], so Rebecca, along with Valentina, Chloe, and [[Prince Alonso]], helps the Royal Family of Avalor against them. After all the Four Shades are defeated, Rebecca and her family are among the numerous attenders of Elena's coronation that evening, in which Rebecca dances with her brother Ari.
