'''Robot''' is an antagonist in theÂ [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[PJ Masks]]''. He is [[Romeo]]'s self-created personal servant. His most notable ability is his very long and stretchy arms and legs which are often used to quickly get them from place to place. It is around three-to-four times larger than Romeo. It is one of the few inventions made by Romeo that has the ability to speak.
Robot also serves as the main villain sidekick.

==Personality==
Robot is very respectful and performs tasks for Romeo and brought by Romeo from place-to-place. Similar to how [[Luna Girl]] is with her [[Moths]], Romeo tends to mistreat him and acts stubborn toward his warnings about the PJ Masks although he has treated Robot kindly on a few occasions. It is possible that he is the only friend of [[Romeo]]. He also loves Christmas.
