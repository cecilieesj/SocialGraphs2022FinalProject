He is designed to annoy entire planets with his nonstop talking.

==Background==
===Personality===
Squeak fulfills what he was programmed to do, which is to annoy enemies by talking constantly. Although not malignant like most experiments, he is very energetic and can talk for hours on end without stopping, tiring out, or even showing signs of needing to breathe. Despite being programmed for nonstop talking, Squeak seems to have some level of self-control as shown when he annoyed the original [[Leroy]] by talking incessantly, to which Leroy threateningly shot a blast at him, causing Squeak to immediately become quiet.

===Physical appearance===
Squeak is a small red mouse-like experiment, wearing a blue hat, vaguely resembling animator Chuck Jones' character {{WikipediaLink|Sniffles}} from the Warner Brothers' ''{{WikipediaLink|Merrie Melodies}}'' series.

===Powers and abilities===
Squeak can speak fluently and go on talking nonstop for a considerably long amount of time. He can talk extremely fast in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, hence his name.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 110 was the 110th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to irritate people and entire populations by talking nonstop. 110 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 110 was activated and captured by Jumba.

In "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]", [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] revealed 110 inside a container and proceeded to test a new device called the Evil-liminator, designed to turn bad experiments to good (in 110's case, make him less talkative). However, the machine failed, simply exploding, and 110, named Squeak, continued to blabber on incessantly, causing [[Pleakley]] to shout at Squeak to stop talking.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Squeak was one of the experiments in [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s dream.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Squeak, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Squeak participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but was briefly threatened by the original Leroy's plasma gun when Squeak wouldn't stop talking. He also made a referee whistle sound when [[Kixx]] punched a Leroy clone over one of the stadium's goalposts.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Squeak made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Frenchfry]], [[Pix]], [[Tickle-Tummy]], and [[Houdini]] after [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] kicked them out for being considered useless. He made a later appearance, along with [[Shrink]], [[Clip]], [[Nosox]], and [[Retro]]. He made a third appearance in aiding [[Stitch]] in battle against [[Dark End]]. He also appeared in the special, ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.

==Trivia==
*According to [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s experiment profiler in the ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' DVD, Squeak's high-pitched voice is comparable to "dentist drills in blender".
*Squeak is one of only four known experiments that wears a hat, the other three being [[Derrick]], [[Frenchfry]], and [[Slick]]. The top of Squeak's hat gets torn off when the Evil-liminator explodes, exposing the fur underneath, but the base remains on his head. Considering that he reappears in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'' with a fresh hat, it can be presumed that he can take it off, but that is never shown.
**Regarding the other hat-wearing experiments, it is unknown if Derrick can remove his hat or not, and Frenchfry's "hat" appears to be a part of his head, while Slick is wearing a true hat that he can remove.
*Squeak was activated off-screen.
*According to what he says in [[Spike (episode)|his debut]], Squeak's astrological sign is Leo, implying that he was "born" on a day from the period of [[July 23]] to [[August 22]].
*His favorite flavor of ice cream is pistachio.
*Squeak talks in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, hence his name.
**He is also one of the few known experiments that can speak fluently.
*Additionally, he is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*Squeak is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''Leroy & Stitch''.
*Squeak's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is red in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.
*Squeak appeared in two anime episodes. In the English dub, he is called "Squeak" and "Squeaky" in different episodes.
**In "Hämsterviel's Epic Secret", he was referred to as "Squeaky" throughout the episode and is credited as such in the credits.
**In "Experiment-a-palooza", he is referred to as both names by [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]]. Squeak also mentions Lilo and that she had given him his name, but he prefers to be called "Experiment One-One-Oh".
***Additionally, Squeak mentions [[Clip]] and [[Nosox]]'s primary functions when they are activated in the dub, whereas Stitch mentions them by name. Later in the same episode, Squeak mentions [[Retro]]'s name and primary function.
***He also states that his favorite number is 57, and the number 10 is his second favorite.
