'''Clarice''' is an anthropomorphic chipmunk who made her debut as the love interest of [[Chip and Dale]] in the short ''[[Two Chips and a Miss]]'', released on [[March 21]], [[1952]].

==History==
Clarice works and sings at a nightclub called the Acorn Club in her debut short. Her beauty and talent catches the interests of both Chip and Dale, who proceeded to compete for her affections - the first time Chip and Dale have ever worked against each other. Despite the short going on to become one of Chip and Dale's most beloved, Clarice would not appear in any future animation (sans in archived footage of the short when played on ''[[Walt Disney anthology series]]'' and ''[[House of Mouse]]'') for 69 years until reappearing in the 2021 [[Disney+]] series [[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life|Chip n Dale Park Life]]. Regardless, the trope of Chip and Dale competing for the affections of an attractive female would become somewhat of a staple, specifically in ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''.

While Chip and Dale have been at the Disney theme parks since 1955, Clarice was present during [[Disneyland]]’s opening ceremony on [[July 17]], [[1955]] and was a meetable character throughout the 1950s. She eventually disappeared from the parks in [[1961]]. She later returned to the parks in [[2005]] and was exclusively found at the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]], where she's very prominent. Clarice later started appearing at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and the [[Disneyland Resort]] in Spring [[2009]]. She eventually became prominent at [[Disneyland Paris]] in the early 2010s and at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

In Japan, Clarice has been regularly featured in media and merchandise involving the ''Mickey Mouse'' franchise. She would often feature as the definitive love interest of both Chip and Dale (in the same vein as what [[Minnie Mouse]] is to [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], and [[Daisy Duck]] is to [[Donald Duck|Donald]]). An example of this is the [http://www.unibearsity.jp/ ''Disney UniBEARsity''] spin-off franchise. Clarice appears in the story ''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=eUBK6rTtzjQ Two Bears and a Kiss]'', in which she was responsible for providing Chip and Dale the materials to make their teddy bears.

==Appearances==
===''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]''===
Clarice appears in the animated series, marking her first proper appearance in animation since her debut short in 1952.<ref name="chip"/>

[[File:Clarice in Chip 'n' Dale- Park Life.jpg|thumb|250px|Clarice in ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]].'']]Clarice's character undergoes a radical redesign with a tomboyish look. Clarice has no clothes and instead possesses an undercut with two flowers shaved into the sides of her head, as a nod to her classic look. She also has her own set of buck teeth that are held together, just like Chip's, but are slightly uneven with one tooth being longer than the other.

Clarice is much more well-off than her previous incarnation and is constantly putting up with Chip and Dale's ineptitude, though she will help them out if necessary. Unlike Chip and Dale, who live in a tree, Clarice lives in a car engine that somehow ended up in a tree. She is a messy, almost barbaric, person, yet is also very constructive chipmunk who is constantly tinkering and fixing things. Her relationship to the boys is also more platonic, though they do admire her for her respective abilities.

==Video games==

Clarice made her first live appearance at [[Disneyland]] in [[1955]] and was present at Disneyland until disappearing in the early 1960s. Nowadays, she rarely appears in the North American parks, her most recent appearance being during the reopening ceremony of the [[Disneyland Railroad]] on July 28, 2017, but is extremely common at the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]], as she is a widely popular character amongst Japanese audiences. She also gained similar popularity with French and European audiences beginning the 2010s where she became prominent at Disneyland Paris for shows, parades, and meet and greets. As a result, Clarice has become an unofficial seventh member to The Sensational Six in Europe and Japan.

She also appears for the park's latest Christmas parade "Mickey's Dazzling Christmas Parade"  together with Chip and Dale.

During Disneyland Paris' 25th Anniversary Celebration in 2017, Clarice was given a special anniversary outfit for the first time alongside other Disney Characters during that celebration. When the park celebrated it's 30th Anniversary in 2022, Clarice was given her own anniversary outfit alongside Mickey and friends.

=== [[Disneyland Paris|Disneyland]]  ===
Clarice returned to the Disneyland Resort in 2009 after a 50 year absence for the street show "Celebrate! A Street Party".

==Trivia==
*Though Clarice is the same as Chip and Dale in that her fur is brown, some Japanese promotional art gives her fur a more yellowish tone.
*Back when Disney Characters appeared at the Ice Capades shows held in 1955 which were later borrowed for Disneyland's opening ceremony, Clarice was depicted without clothes (just like Chip and Dale) instead wore an apron, and was barefoot and only kept her flower around her head.  She also shared the same design as the costumes for Chip and Dale but with half-closed eyelids.
