After [[Maria Rambeau]] fell ill with cancer, Dr. Highland began her treatment. She became acquainted with Maria, and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau]]. Some time in [[2018]], a cancer procedure was performed on Maria, and Dr. Highland assigns her with a clean bill of health, ready to be discharged. She passes this information onto Monica. Later that day, the [[The Blip|Blip]] occurs, in which half of all life in the universe, vanishes. Dr. Highland is amongst those who survive.

Maria's cancer eventually comes back, and Dr. Highland learns of her passing, which occurs two years later.

Another three years pass, and the vanished suddenly return. The hospital is brought into chaos, at this unexpected event, and a confused Dr. Highland runs into Monica, who is unaware any time has passed. She explains to her that her mother died three years ago, two years after she disappeared.
