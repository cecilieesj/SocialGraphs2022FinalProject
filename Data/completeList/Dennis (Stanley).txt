==History==
He is an orange goldfish with a [[United Kingdom|British]] accent and one of [[Stanley Griff|Stanley]]'s three pets, the other two being [[Harry (Stanley)|Harry]] and [[Elsie]]. In fact, he is Stanley's best friend who gives him learning about animals to help him with his everyday problems, which interest him. He also has to point out the flaws in Stanley's ridiculous solutions. He has musical talent. Occasionally, he is shown to be playing the music for songs featured within the episodes of ''Stanley''. He even [[Breaking the Fourth Wall|breaks the fourth wall]] in almost every episode by either encouraging the viewers to do something fun or by asking them questions corresponding to the given topic.

==Trivia==
*Dennis usually spins around before asking questions.
*Dennis made a cameo in an episode of ''{{WikipediaLink|Pinky Dinky Doo}}''. He can be seen in a fish tank in the pet store. [[Harry (Stanley)|Harry]], [[Elsie]], [[Porkchop]], [[Stinky]], and [[Flick Duck]] appear as well. Just like Dennis, Harry and Elsie, the other three characters are from shows that [[Jim Jinkins]] has created (''[[Doug]]'' and ''[[PB&J Otter]]'').
*It is revealed in the episode "A Boy's Best Friend is His Fish" that Dennis' breed of fish is a {{WikipediaLink|Comet (goldfish)|Comet}}.
*In one episode, Dennis explains that rabbits are rodents, which is not exactly real.
*He has a similar personality to [[Cogsworth]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.
*He wears glasses to read.
*Dennis is the only one of Stanley's pets mentioned in the show's [[My Man Stanley|theme song]], which asks, "Who's proud to say his best friend is a fish?"
