'''Cassandra''' is a major character in the Disney animated series, ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. She is a close friend of [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]' and to a lesser extent [[Icarus]], who is hopelessly in love with her, during their time in [[Prometheus Academy]].

==Background==
===Personality===
As a result of her constant visions of doom and inability to prevent them from coming to pass, Cassandra is permanently gloomy and deeply anti-social. However, she does find some pleasure in her funny, cunning, sarcastic comments, which are always there when someone makes a mistake. That said, Cassandra is very loyal to her friends, and often acts as a mentor for Hercules in times of need, bringing patience to Icarus's "Icarus-ness." Cassandra's not opposed to lying to get out of doing things that she'd rather not do (like going on dates with Icarus) and has also claimed to have no interest in having children (but, ironically, is shown to be surprisingly good with kids). Also, while Cassandra may not be romantically interested in Icarus, she does care about him as a friend.

Cassandra's parents are Vic (her dad) and Evelyn (her mom), who, in contrast to their daughter, have much perkier and more upbeat personalities (and are also much more chummy with Icarus, much to Cassandra's dismay). But in "[[Hercules and the Parent's Weekend]]", it's shown they can be just as gloomy as their daughter.

After graduating from the Prometheus Academy, Cassandra would eventually become the most famous Prophet in all of Greece.

===Physical appearance===
Cassandra has a narrow face, pale skin, pointy chin, red lips, thin unibrow, long, magenta hair, lavender eyelids, and aqua green eyes.

She wears an indigo Greek dress with azure neckline and belt, and wears a light blue headband.

===Powers and abilities===
Cassandra has the involuntary ability to see the future (usually disasters), but is cursed so that no one ever believes her. When Cassandra has a vision, her eyes turn green and swirl around. A running gag is that when Cassandra makes sarcastic comments, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and [[Icarus]] listen, but when she has visions, they rarely believe her. In Greek Mythology, this is called the Cassandra truth.
