'''"The Juicer"''' is a former bully from [[That's So Raven]] & [[Cory in the House]] 

== That So Raven ==
The Juicer is a guy at Cory's school, who bullies the other students, and vandalizes various objects. He earned his nickname due to his strange ability to extract liquid from various objects such as heads, paper bags, cigarettes, paper and even a duck sculpture.

In his first appearance in the Season 4 episode Juicer Consequences, he told Cory he has flunked 7th grade four times. His trademark is stealing the other students' lunches. If a fellow student refuses his wishes, then he claims he will "juice" (or extract the liquids from) his or her head (which is how he got his nickname, though this is never completely shown in the series).

It is said he can get the "juice" out of anything, which is proven when he squeezes "juice" out of a basketball in the episode [[Mad Hot Cotillion]], and later when he "juices" a brown paper shopping bag in the episode [[Teacher's Pet|Teacherâ€™s Pet]].

He appears in the Season 4 episodes [[Juicer Consequences]], [[Mad_Hot_Cotillion]], .[[Teacher's Pet (That's So Raven)|Teacher's Pet]],  as well as the last episode [[Where There's Smoke]].

== Cory in the house ==
The Juice only appeared in episode [[And the Weenie is...]]. Cory and his band were going to play a DC3 concert at the school bash, but Cory's afraid The Juicer will ruin it and make him look like a weenie again from San Francisco. The Juicer thought Cory was going to throw him a birthday party, which almost ruined the school bash DC3 was going to do. The Juicer didn't like how his birthday party and cake was made, he wanted to Juice everyone's head. Cory told the juice that he's not going to allow him to Juice his friends. Cory asked the Juicer if "Is that going to make people like you, or throw you a surprise party". The juicer replied but it work on you, and Cory replied back well it will not work again. The Juicer agreed that he will stop bullying, and even tries to make real friends by not scaring them and just being nice. Afterwards the Juicer enjoyed the bash of DC3's concert.

:(''Cory is handing out flyers of his band's gig; one person takes a flyer and squeezes the "juice" out of it'')
:'''Cory''': (horrified) There's only one person who can do that. (looks up and sees The Juicer)
:'''The Juicer''': (menacingly) Hello, weenie. '''Cory''': (shocked) The Juicer?!
:'''The Juicer''': Well, what's the matter, weenie? You're not happy to see me!
:'''Cory''': (terrified) No no, I am. It's just, I didn't expect to see you here, at my new school, so far away from San Francisco, where you should still be.
:'''The Juicer''': Yeah, well, I'm on my seventh grade trip. Fifth year in a row. Yeah, I can practically give the tour myself, so I thought I'd take you up on your offer to stop by anytime I was in town.
:'''Cory''': I never offered that! I didn't even tell you where I was gonna be staying!
:'''The Juicer''': Yeah, well, (''takes out a thermos'') luckily I was able to juice it out of your weenie friend Larry.
:'''Cory''': (''looks at The Juicer's thermos in horror'') Is that Larry in there? (''fake crying'') He was so young!
:'''The Juicer''': Relax! It's green tea. It's loaded with antioxidants.
