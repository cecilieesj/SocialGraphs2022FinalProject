For years, she has been a fan of Canina's acting, and hopes to one day be as talented as her idol. But when Canina says that her talent only comes once in a lifetime, Zsa Zsa becomes resentful and seeks to replace the big star. She goes so far as to set up "accidents", such as locking Canina in her room and electrifying the giant dog food can.

Zsa Zsa strands Canina in Taxidermia so as to off her and take her place.

==Trivia==
*Zsa Zsa is based on [[Wikipedia:Zsa Zsa Gabor|Zsa Zsa Gabor]], whose sister [[Eva Gabor|Eva]] voiced [[Duchess]] in ''[[The Aristocats]]'', and [[Miss Bianca]] in [[1977]]'s ''[[The Rescuers]]'' and its [[The Rescuers Down Under|1990 sequel]].
