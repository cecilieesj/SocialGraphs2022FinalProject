'''Daniel''' was [[Dr. Vile]]'s apprentice; despite not liking it, nevertheless, had no choice because he needed the money for his poor family, in ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)]]'', until he started bonding with [[Sebastian]], who was going to be used as another subject for his master's experiments, and he decided to leave his job and go find a better one after his former master's electric waterwheel, which caused pollution to the ocean and everyone to fall sick, was destroyed by [[Ariel]] after she threw a monkey wrench in it.
