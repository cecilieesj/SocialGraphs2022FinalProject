'''EG-86''' is a GNK series power droid, or Gonk droid, who appeared in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episode, "[[Blood Sisters]]". He works for the [[Rebel Alliance]], specifically [[Bail Organa]], acting as a spy for the rebels and gathering whatever Imperial information he can.

==Background==
EG-86 is a rebel spy, using his appearance as a harmless Gonk droid to slip past Imperial security and gather vital information for the early members of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. Following one such spy mission, EG-86 was retrieved by rebel members [[Sabine Wren]] and [[Ezra Bridger]], who were ordered by [[Bail Organa]] to bring him to the planet Alderaan. However, the rebels were intercepted by a [[Mandalorian]] bounty hunter and former friend of Sabine, [[Ketsu Onyo]], who attempted to kidnap EG-86 for her employers, the Black Sun. When the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] eventually showed up, Ketsu helped the rebels escape, delivering EG-86 safely to Alderaan.

==Trivia==
*EG-86 is the first Gonk droid to appear in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.
*EG-86 was not originally a Gonk droid when development for "[[Blood Sisters]]" began.
*EG-86 is the first Gonk droid in the Star Wars universe to have a featured role.
