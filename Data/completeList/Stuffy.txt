'''Stuffy''' is one of the main characters from the [[2012]] [[Disney Junior]] show, ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''.

==Background==
===Appearance===
Stuffy is a slender stuffed blue [[Dragons|dragon]] with a red collar around his neck, two slender antennae, and has rosy cheeks. He wears a Band-Aid (with a red heart in the center) on his chest when injured and sometimes appears in other outfits, such as a pirate costume in the episode "[[All Washed Up]]" and winter clothes in "[[Chilly Gets Chilly]]".

===Personality===
While being brave and intelligent sometimes, Stuffy is rather clumsy, though he doesn't always trip and fall successfully. Whenever he does so, everyone often laughs at him. However, when Stuffy causes a frequent accident during a patient's check-up or at any other time, he seems loyal and truthful to [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] or anyone else.

==Role in the series==
Stuffy is a slender stuffed blue dragon who always tries his best to be the bravest dragon of all. He unexpectedly hurts himself when [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] and the toys are playing a game in the episodes "[[The Right Stuff]]" and "[[Un-Bur-Able]]". Stuffy says he isn't afraid of anything (except spiders), and when he tells himself he is brave, a noise startles him.

Stuffy's favorite game is protecting castles from monsters and brave knights. He dislikes tea parties until he is part of it in the episode "[[Tea Party Tantrum]]" when Doc and [[Lambie]] laugh at him for sipping from his teacup loudly. Also, in the episode "All Washed Up", Stuffy and Lambie are pretending to be pirates in the game "Find the Hidden Treasure" (because of this, Stuffy is dressed as a pirate in the said game).

==Trivia==
*While busy working on ''[[The Doc Files]] ''TV series, [[Robbie Rist]] was unable to voice Stuffy, so [[Ben Schwartz]] had to fill in for him.
*When Stuffy tells himself he is brave, he does not succeed at that when something scares him.
*Stuffy is the first toy to adopt a toy pet as his own.
*In "[[Bringing Home Baby]]", it is revealed that Stuffy was given to Doc by her parents on Halloween night.
*Stuffy's design is based on ''[[The Reluctant Dragon]]'' film from [[1941]].
