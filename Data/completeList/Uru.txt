'''Uru''' is the Queen of the Pride Lands that is mentioned in ''[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures]]''.

==Background==
Uru was the second named queen of the [[Pride Lands]]. She was the mate of [[Ahadi]] and the mother of [[Mufasa]] and [[Scar]]. She was the paternal grandmother of [[Simba]] and the great-grandmother of his sons [[Kopa]] and Kion. She is also the great-grandmother of Simba's daughter Kiara.

During the events of the book, Ahadi mentions that Uru had set off to search for a new water source during a drought, leaving him to care for their sons and the kingdom.

[[Rafiki]] later mentions that Uru had managed to find a water source and save the kingdom.

Uru is mainly absent from the story due to her quest. She is first mentioned by Ahadi when he tells Rafiki that she is searching for a new source of food and water for the Pride Lands. She is later mentioned by Rafiki himself as he relates the story to Kopa, explaining that Uru found a lake at the western edge of the Pride Lands that saved many animals from dying of thirst.

===Personality===
Though her personality is not explored, it can be assumed that Uru is dauntless and dutiful, willing to separate from her family in order to save her subjects.

==Trivia==
* It is possible Uru is the daughter of Mohatu, which would maker her the first named Reigning Queen of the Pridelands.
*Uru was mentioned in ''[[The Lion King]]'' by [[Zazu]] when he was confronting [[Scar]] over his absence during [[Simba]]'s presentation.
*Uru is also the name of the metal that [[Thor Odinson|Thor Odinson's]] famous [[Mjolnir]] is made of.
