'''Cissy Rooney''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is an air-headed teen who is friends with [[Trinket St. Blair]] and attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and her friends.

==Background==
Cissy is the best friend of [[Trinket St. Blair]] and has known her since kindergarten. A typical air-head, Cissy follows Trinket around and rarely, if ever, thinks for herself. She seems to think that she befriended Trinket after assuring her that a pony she once had knew it was friends with her before it died, but cannot recall if it was real or from a television show. Nevertheless, she has taken this to heart as the true reason why the two have been longtime friends. Aside from that, Cissy very rarely gets much attention or screen time, though every now and then will reveal something unusual about herself, the most notable being in "[[Crush and Burn]]" where she revealed that her air-head persona is a ruse.

Besides Trinket, Cissy is shown to get along with [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and finds her more approachable than her best friend. However, Pepper Ann has a tendency to make backhanded and passive-aggressive insults to her which fly above her head. It is slightly implied that the other students find her annoying, with the exception of Trinket, and will try to stay out of her way.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Cissy starts working at a boutique. Despite her rather simplistic future, she is very happy as she is around the things that she likes. She has apparently kept tabs on her middle school friends.

===Personality===
Cissy is sweet, but not the brightest bulb in Hazelnut which is made very much apparent by her tendency to speak with inserting words such as "like" and "for sure" in the middle of her sentences like a typical valley girl. She will drone on about her interests whether anyone is listening to her or not, though she is apparently oblivious to this. In "Crush and Burn", Cissy admits that she is actually very intelligent and only acts dumb so as not to come off as intimidating, implying that she is very self-conscious about herself.

===Physical appearance===
Cissy is a tall and slender Caucasian girl, possibly the tallest girl in Hazelnut, who has short, frizzy blond hair. Besides her small dot eyes, she also has full pink lips. She wears a hot pink shirt with a small cyan mark on the chest that has her midriff showing, red capri pants and pink sneakers.

==Trivia==
*It is unknown whether Cissy is also wealthy, or simply friends with Trinket because of their shared interests.
*Cissy's family is never shown as she is usually seen at Trinket's house.
