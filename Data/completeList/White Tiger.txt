|quote = }}'''White Tiger''' (real name '''Ava Ayala''') is a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] trainee and the current successor in her family's legacy to bear the name. Originally a lone hero, she joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in an effort to become a right-hand woman to [[Nick Fury]]. With the rest of her group, she embarked on many missions and developed further as a hero. Throughout her time with the rest of the group, she rediscovered her hatred for [[Kraven|Kraven the Hunter]] for the murders of her father and grandfather and overcame her desire to kill him herself with the aid of [[Spider-Man]]. She controls herself naturally and helps the others with that too.

==Background==
===Personality===
After becoming White Tiger, Ava was forced to control her powers by maintaining composure and keeping her calmness during situations. She could never allow herself to embrace her savage powers. On one occasion, she did just that and came into conflict with the man responsible for her father and grandfather's demises. During this time, Ava acted polar opposite of how she usually did and did not care about keeping herself in any well-groomed matter, once drinking out of a carton and burping loudly in front of her teammates. She had also become uncharismatic, as she told the group they were out of milk and walked off. Ava generally felt regret for the power that her amulet had placed on her and even considered it to be the only thing that made her important.

Frequently during missions, White Tiger displayed a level of impertinence towards her teammates. She would often bring up the grades of the others and throw their own flaws back in their faces, like when she and [[Spider-Man]] were alone together facing Taskmaster and she reminded him that he never trained after claiming the impending fight to be the moment he had been training for. Of the group, Ava considered studies towards school or academics, in general, to be her most important factor, as she would make sure to complete her homework before going off to face a villain or stop nefarious actions of others. During a flight to Latveria, she revealed to Spider-Man that she was finishing her homework.

===Physical appearance===
[[File:Ava_Ayala.png|thumb|200px|left|Ava Ayala (White Tiger's secret identity.)]]
Aya Ayala is a dark-skinned woman of average height who has a slender yet muscular body, brown eyes, brown hair reaching mid-back, ripped broad shoulders, toned stomach, toned back, large breasts, and long muscular legs. She usually wears a green, pink, or blue tunic with a white or purple long shirt underneath, a black or brown sash belt around her waist and wears strapped black high heels.

As White Tiger, she wears a very form-fitting white colored cat-like suit that highlights her muscular body, with claw markings on her waist and shoulders, it also has yellow eyes, with her hair sticking out in a long, high ponytail. When under the effects of Kraven's drum, her eyes are razor and her hair is frizzed up.

In season 3 ''Web Warriors'', White Tiger gains a modified form of her costume; her formerly gray stripes are now jagged black rather than linear. Three sets of stripes are across her face and two above her eyes giving the impression of eyebrows. The outline around her eyes has become thicker and curved pointing downward while her ears have become slightly pointier. Her belt is no longer present, and the White Tiger Amulet rests on her chest instead if hanging by her waist.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''White Tiger Amulet:''' As the latest White Tiger, Ava's powers come solely from the White Tiger Amulet, an artifact that gives her tiger-like abilities. During many battles, though her powers can be used for her rare instances of being a solo act, they benefit greatly from the reliance of others.
**'''Enhanced Reflexes:''' White Tiger has catlike reflexes, and she has been shown to rely heavily on it, especially while dealing with larger and much stronger opponents. However, her reflexes have not always benefited her and have caused her to be easily attacked and overpowered by opponents like Klaw.
**'''Claws:''' Thanks to her Amulet, White Tiger has claws and can slice through anything.

====Abilities====
*'''Master Acrobatic:''' White Tiger is an athlete-type able to easily dodge enemy attacks and fight enemies.
*'''Peak Human Agility:''' White Tiger has peaked agility able to leap high and run fast enough to catch the enemy with ease.

===Weapons and Equipment===
*'''Electrified Claws:''' Given a new upgrade from S.H.I.E.L.D., White Tiger has electrified claws able to shock opponents in hand-to-hand combat.
*'''S.H.I.E.L.D. Tiger Claws:''' S.H.I.E.L.D. gave Ava a new weapon that resembles a mechanical tiger claw. It is able to do deal more damage than her regular claws and can hold small pieces of objects inside it. Her first and only time using these claws was against [[Venom]] during his third appearance in the city.

==Role in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''==
[[File:Ava_becoming_White_Tiger.png|thumb|250px|Ava becomes White Tiger.]]
Ava was born to Hector Ayala, the first White Tiger. Ava became White Tiger after her father was heavily injured by Kraven the Hunter during the latter's seeking of his power. Her father passed the Tiger Amulet down to her and instructed that it not fall into Kraven's hands, in fear that the tyrant would become even more powerful. She took the Tiger Amulet, every day enduring its willingness to drive her into becoming wild and uncontrolled. She then became the White Tiger and eventually joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] shortly after becoming a hero.

She moved into the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and met [[Sam Alexander|Nova]], [[Iron Fist]], and [[Power Man]] after doing so. Soon enough, S.H.I.E.L.D. has uncovered her past and kept it in their records.

===Spider-Man's joining===
[[Spider-Man]] took Nick Fury's previous advice to him in stride and went to join S.H.I.E.L.D. on his own freewill. During his battle against several automated robots, White Tiger watched his fight. She criticized his fighting style, stating that he was merely going around the combatants and smashing them. As Nova questioned Nick Fury for testing Spider-Man without his consent, White Tiger mocked him for still believing himself to be in charge and called him cute. As the four analyzed him, White Tiger referred to him as someone with low self-esteem and an identification with bugs merely because he named himself Spider-Man. As Iron Fist compared Spider-Man's criticism to the group's unknowing of him, White Tiger stated that she would clean the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier for a month if Spider-Man were to join. White Tiger also stated she would clean toilets as well, following Iron Fist's questioning of such. She high-fived the three shortly afterwards.

Spider-Man made his way of the Helicarrier, on a motorcycle designed for him and was having difficulty using it. Luckily, White Tiger and the others came to his aid, in which she piloted the motorcycle after he was removed from it by Nova. As Spider-Man asked whom they were, she introduced herself and explained her capabilities to him. She tried to introduce Luke by his real name but was cut off by the latter in mid-speech. Luke instead wanted to identify himself as Power Man, something White Tiger opted to let him do. She returned to the Helicarrier with Spider-Man and her group and was ecstatic to win her bet after he chose to not join the group. Soon enough, Spider-Man was cornered by the Frightful Four sans Trapster and was having a difficult time facing the three by himself. To even the odds, White Tiger and her teammates came to his aid.

She jumped on him and was told by Spider-Man that their help was unneeded, as he believed he was on the verge of winning. White Tiger did not agree, instead removing the device placed on Spider-Man's chest by the group and soon enough, was struck from behind by [[Ulysses Klaw|Klaw]]. She continued to fight him and mocked the villain before being struck in the mouth and knocked unconscious instantly. As she began to fall headfirst, Spider-Man saved her. She was not easily impressed, citing that she could save herself before being placed with her teammates as Spider-Man alerted them of their real priority: protecting the civilians. She abided by his decision and protected the civilians as he faced the Frightful Four alone. During her protecting of the civilians, she was struck in the back alongside Nova and Power Man by Wizard. She later met with Spider-Man as his alter ego Peter Parker during a day at his school and introduced herself.

====Doctor Doom capture====
As Peter and Sam were sent to detention, Ava had already been sent there at the instructions of [[Agent Coulson|principal Coulson]]. After a tunnel ride, she emerged in costume and announced her presence before stopping to notice Spider-Man and Nova bickering before walking off. She briefly questioned where the group had been sent before hearing a transmission from Nick Fury. After noticing the group was underwater, she concluded that she loved working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and met back up with the others. As Spider-Man and Nova settled their differences by having a bet to see who could destroy more robots, White Tiger made an irritated remark while standing on the sidelines with Iron Fist and Power Man.

As White Tiger yearned for respect, she concluded that the group should bring in someone from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most wanted list after Spider-Man brought up all the villains he had defeated during his year of being a superhero. As she looked through the database, she wanted the group to make sure they found a villain they could handle. Just then, Nova requested the group go after [[Doctor Doom]] and sped off as the others pursued him. As they were aboard a ship, White Tiger urged them to turn the ship off, claiming as fact that the group was not going to go after Doctor Doom. Spider-Man agreed with her, much to her relief. However, as she moved in, the ship's door shut and took off. As they flew off, she concluded that she hated the entire group. Spider-Man became worried and started to check in on the others as the ship flew. After Spider-Man asked if she was trying to create a battle strategy, White Tiger revealed she was merely doing her homework before the battle.

Within hours, the group arrived at Latveria and were attacked by several Octobots. During the battle, she sliced through one of the Octobots and regrouped with the others after the remainder were destroyed. Soon enough, the group was attacked by Doctor Doom himself, whom emerged from his castle. To their surprise, Nova was able to defeat Doom with several blasts. In their ships, White Tiger and the others returned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and discovered that Doom was merely a robot replica with several inside of the one they captured. As White Tiger pursued a lone Doombot, she concluded that they were splitting up to do the most damage and believed the group would need to contain them. As Spider-Man asked her how fast she could reach the core, White Tiger revealed it to be below them and told the others to follow her coordinates.

As White Tiger and the others made their efforts, Nova was ultimately the one who stopped the Helicarrier from being destroyed. As the group was scolded by Nick Fury for their actions, Spider-Man was the first of them to admit fault. However, White Tiger and the others soon followed and admitted their own involvement. As the group received a taunting message from the real Doctor Doom, Nova prepared to depart for Latveria. She and the others chased after him.

====The Symbiote rising====
As she and the rest of the group made their presence in Peter's life known, they started to deteriorate his friendship with [[Harry Osborn]]. As Peter and Harry briefly talked, Ava and the rest of the team requested his presence during a meeting and dragged him away from Harry. In actuality, the group simply wanted to laugh at Spider-Man's previous exposure of his underwear in his presence. Ava questioned Peter as to why she had to hear of Peter's accident from Nick Fury and not him, of which Peter reminded her he had just arrived. As the group continued to stick their matters into Peter's personal life, Ava was in attendance with the others to Harry Osborn's party. During which, the group briefly held an exchange with [[Mary Jane Watson]] and Ava showed disgust at Sam's eating of the nachos. As the symbiote started to wreak havoc, Ava ordered an evacuation as she grabbed Mary Jane, in an attempt to escort her to safety.

[[File:41-1.jpg.png|thumb|250px|White Tiger fights Venom.]]
During the symbiote's tenure, it enveloped Nova. As the four came across their ally-turned-foe, White Tiger asked Spider-Man on how the group would be able to prevent the symbiote from causing any harm without harming their teammate. As Power Man attacked it, he ripped the symbiote off of Nova. As he himself was enveloped, White Tiger screamed out his name in horror. She fought against the symbiote when it later came into play after taking Iron Fist as its host and watched as Spider-Man allowed himself to be taken.

Spider-Man was able to defeat it after he shocked it. Shortly afterwards, White Tiger and Power Man laughed at Iron Fist's exposed body and were confronted by Harry Osborn on the whereabouts of Peter. Three of the four made insults about him, with Ava's receiving an awkward silence as she tried to make fun of him for only being a ninety-eight percent average.

====Meeting and rescuing Iron Man====
[[File:White_Tiger_and_sheltered_group.png|thumb|left|250px|White Tiger and the rest of the group cover their eyes of the glowing light]]
Spider-Man was chased by [[Living Laser]] throughout New York. Fortunately for him, the group came to his aid. As they stood, White Tiger voiced her hope that they would be able to defeat Living Laser without destroying the city. As White Tiger and the others prepared to be vaporized, Living Laser disappeared before their very eyes. As she heard a sound, White Tiger made it known that she was hearing a familiar sound. As [[Iron Man]] arrived, Spider-Man wondered what he and Nick Fury were talking about.

White Tiger believed it to be something related to security. As Spider-Man stared at Iron Man, she asked him if he was done. Later on, she trained with the rest of her team sans Spider-Man. Though the group argued over doing so, she concluded that if Spider-Man was late, they should train without him. However, Power Man cited that Spider-Man would show up, continuing by stating he always did. White Tiger believed that he mistook showing up for showing off. She continued by stating that there was no Spider-Man in team. After concluding their training, White Tiger corrected Nova before Spider-Man arrived in a new Iron Manlike suit. In a matter of days, Ava and the other members of the group began to despise Spider-Man's new suit, mainly due to his inability to control it. They confronted Nick Fury over it, with Ava stating that his suit had been throwing the group off in the field recently. As the group discussed their crisis with Nick Fury, the Living Laser showed up again. With Fury's decision to send them, White Tiger asked about Spider-Man's involvement before Fury revealed he was only sending them in.

White Tiger and the others went to confront him. As Spider-Man arrived to aid them, White Tiger openly questioned what Peter was doing there. Despite their combined efforts, the five proved ineffective towards beating him and the Living Laser escaped. As she walked away from him, White Tiger told him that he couldn't control the suit, even calling his own worst enemy in that suit. As Peter later arrived at the at the Helicarrier, Ava asked him what he was doing. After Spider-Man explained his failure and apologized to the group, Ava and the others surprised him by their statements relating to helping him. She told him to merely ditch his armor, as she and the others believed he worked better without it.

====Taskmaster====
Spider-Man chased [[Batroc|Batroc the Leaper]] in New York. Ava as White Tiger came to his aid and told him that Nick Fury requested that he report back to S.H.I.E.L.D., much to Spider-Man's annoyance. Spider-Man told her not to be so official, instead to go after lone criminals. As she attacked Batroc the Leaper, he dodged her and soon enough, she fell flat on her face before getting up and seeing Spider-Man stop Batroc in his tracks. Ultimately, Batroc was sent leaping headfirst into a broadcast of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. At Midtown High School, she partook in a P.E. exercise and failed to please her new teacher. Feeling her failure to be an unjust, she forced Peter to come with her to the school the next day, that being a Saturday. However, Peter slept in bed and only woke up when Ava called him.

She questioned where he was before he swore to her that he'd be there. She simply told him to hurry up before he appeared before her shortly after her statement, much to her annoyance. Finally, in costume, she and Spider-Man came in front of the school and found the doors locked. As White Tiger thought the two should call for backup, Spider-Man urged her not to, citing that the two would be able to win the fight on their own. As they entered, they finally realized why Ava failed the test. Their gym instructor was really [[Taskmaster]], whom was trying to find out who Spider-Man was among the students. After learning the truth, Ava did not feel bad about failing the test. She did, however, fail to defeat Taskmaster, whom copied her every move and was left dangling to her certain death until Spider-Man came to her aid.

The two trapped Taskmaster in the school's gym and attacked him, this time with each other's weapons. To their surprises, White Tiger started to enjoy using Spider-Man's technology and later joined him to talk with Danny and Coulson. Shortly after her fight with Taskmaster, she sat with Luke, Peter, and the others as Mary Jane announced that she had gotten an interview with Spider-Man. Shortly after aiding him, Ava ate lunch with the group and Harry as [[Mary Jane Watson]] announced while recording them that she had gotten an interview with Spider-Man.

====Spider-Man impersonator====
An impostor with similar powers to Spider-Man started to save the city as a vigilante, which garnered the attention of Nick Fury. White Tiger was present for the meeting alongside the rest of her group and along with everyone else sans Spider-Man, she was more than willing to allow the impostor onto the team. As Spider-Man continued to berate the group for their decision and sneezed as he walked out, White Tiger hoped that she would not catch his cold. Spider-Man went and defeated [[Venom]], after doing so coming to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and discovering White Tiger and the others had contracted his cold. Along with the others, she chased him off, angry over catching his cold.

====Trip to Asgard====
Ava and her teammates went on a field trip to a museum to see the Norn Stone. However, the stone started to glow and soon enough, a Frost Giant emerged from its space. Ava and the others desperately tried to defeat it, after getting into their costumes. However, the group was unable to do any type of substantial damage until the arrival of [[Thor Odinson|Thor]]. Thor easily defeated the Frost Giant and regarded the group as mere children, much to their anger and frustration. After Thor transformed into a frog from touching a crystal made by [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] designed to do so, White Tiger went with the other members of the group and Thor to Asgard to fight Loki. They arrived and were soundly captured after doing so.

Determining White Tiger and the others couldn't win, Spider-Man had Thor teleport the group away from the battle. After retreating, they sought help from the Troll King. After Thor apologized for earlier statements he made to the former, Eitri supplied the group with additional weapons, giving White Tiger a bow and arrow. During their next battle with Loki, White Tiger used it to fight off several of the Frost Giants until Spider-Man successfully tricked Loki into undoing his spell on Thor by reverting him to normal. After the group returned to Earth, White Tiger and the others gladly allowed Spider-Man to receive the goat Thor had given them in thanks for their cooperation.

====Venom's true identity====
[[File:Ava_angry_at_Spider-Man_about_not_telling_her_and_the_others_who_Venom_was.png|thumb|left|250px|Ava frustrated with Peter.]]
The Venom symbiote emerged for the third time and caused Nick Fury to assemble the group to face it once again. As Spider-Man revealed that he knew who was inside of the symbiote and wouldn't say whom, White Tiger urged Nick Fury to allow her to attack him. Spider-Man was placed on bench for the mission while White Tiger and the others were allowed to go. As the group prepared to get suited up, White Tiger explained that Venom had been sighted at Oscorp towers.

As she and the others descended into their pods, they were trapped in webs and concluded they were those of Spider-Man. They eventually got out and made their way to the tower, where they encountered Spider-Man and Venom. As the group attacked Venom, Spider-Man asked them sarcastically what had took them so long. White Tiger asked him if he was surprised that the group made their way through his webbing so soon before Power Man told her to focus on their mission instead of Spider-Man.

As Spider-Man continued to throw the group off, he explained they didn't have to hurt Venom and they could still save him before White Tiger concluded that whoever was inside of Venom was long gone as she took out her S.H.I.E.L.D. issue tiger claws and charged at him alongside the rest of the group sans Spider-Man. During the four's simultaneous attack on Venom, she climbed up his shoulder and kicked him the back. She soon followed her assault by slashing rather harshly against his back, urging Spider-Man to ask what she was doing before Nova answered for her by stating the group was doing their job. After their assault, Venom escaped. Spider-Man asked her and the others if they had let Venom get away, only for Ava to reveal she had taken a sample from him. As Norman Osborn confronted the group about their presence in his lab, White Tiger held the sample behind her.

She and the others privately confronted Spider-Man about his decision to help out Venom, of which she questioned so dearly why he had been trying to protect him from the attacks of his teammates and partners. Spider-Man reluctantly revealed to the group that Harry was Venom. After Spider-Man asked if they understood his logic for not telling them, Ava was convinced that he chose not to do so due to his loyalty as the best friend of Harry. She and the others held of Venom as Spider-Man prepared an antidote for the symbiote. Their mission a success, they managed to get it away from him for the time being.

====Daily Bugle stakeout====
She and the rest of her group would next be assigned to stakeout duty in watching out for [[J. Jonah Jameson]], whom was under attack by the [[Beetle]] after slandering the latter in the media despite Spidey's protests. She and the group continued their stakeout until they noticed Mary Jane Watson on her way to the building. White Tiger and the others made their way of the roof and into the Daily Bugle itself, splitting up as they did so. During their watch, she and the others split up in order to watch the building from all sides. However, she, Iron Fist, Nova, and Power Man were defeated by Beetle one by one. The four all regain consciousness later and joined Spider-Man during his own face off with the villain.

After rejoining Spider-Man, she attacked Beetle on her own. During the attack, she was caught by Power Man after a direct hit from the Beetle and grabbed by him as well, ordering him to let go before the others helped her. After defeating him, White Tiger and the rest of the group prepared to take him to prison as Spider-Man conversed with Mary Jane over saving her life. Their mission a success, White Tiger and the rest escorted Beetle to prison.

====Sandman encounter====
She and her teammates pranked fellow team member [[Spider-Man]] while the latter slept in bed. The group had [[Sam Alexander|Nova]] call Spider-Man on his cell phone and claim to have been in his hardest battle and desperately needing help. As they anticipated, Spider-Man ran out and slipped on ice, causing White Tiger and the others to laugh at him. After laughing at him, she and the others informed Spider-Man that they had come to retrieve him. The group decided to head off to a deserted tropical island. As they arrived, they changed out of their costumes and into beach clothes. Ava played volleyball with the rest of the team and easily dominated her allies, gloating after winning as well.

During their fun, she and the others came in contact with a boy named Sandy. Sandy claimed to have been stranded on the island and urged the group to chase him. Despite their initial unwillingness, they went along and did so. Along with the others, she started to complain over chasing him. Her main complaint is that of her hair being covered in sand and needing to wash it. She and the others decided to go back to their ship, only for Sandy to discover their desire to leave and his revealing to be the criminal [[Sandman]] as he seized their ship and caused them to retreat. The five ran off into a maze and were soon enough, found by Sandman. She ran off with the others and managed to get into the ship once the group worked as a team and subdued Sandman. However, Sandman hid as sand on their ship and managed to get off. The group was forced to go after Sandman, whom had changed into a large form and was making his way onto New York.

White Tiger and the others chased him as he continued to make his way into the state. With the help of Nova, she and the others succeeded. Though Sandman was incarcerated, the group was still subjected to a partly-clothed cold bath by Nick Fury, whom was trying to make sure the group did not have any small particles of sand still on them and also trying to punish them for going to the tropical island without his consent.

====Cleaning up====
During an attack on New York, Ava instructed Iron Fist to aid her in saving a few children from being killed by collateral damage during the battle. She and the rest of her team were scolded by [[Nick Fury]] for the collateral damage of the battle and were given a new task in the form of joining Damage Control and cleaning up their own messes. While she and the others displayed distaste in their new job, Spider-Man and Nova claimed to have uncovered a nefarious secret about the group. She and the rest of the team did not believe them and carried on their own individual work until finally being allowed to resume their jobs as superheroes.

====Spider-Ham====
Spider-Man was turned into a pig by [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], as an act of revenge for his previous assistance of [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] in reclaiming his body. Ava and her teammates were at school while Spider-Man was chased around by several Asgardians, hellbent on eating him and laughed at him when they saw him. After their mocking of him, Ava and the rest of her team fought of several of the Asgardians determined to eat Spider-Man and were successfully in keeping the latter from harm's way.

====Training with Captain America====
She and the rest of her team received training from [[Captain America]], whom easily overpowered the five. During the training session, she was tied against a pole with Luke after being bested in battle. Spider-Man was the last to be taken down and shortly after his defeat, the group received another round with the veteran hero. She fought him by herself and was propelled against Power Man, whom himself had been defeated earlier. After their session reached its climax, Captain America left his shield in front of the group. She and the others started to converse on their match and discussed their enjoyment towards meeting him before Captain America's shield was projected out of the S.H.I.E.L.D.

Helicarrier after Power Man failed to catch it when Spider-Man threw it at him. After Spider-Man went to retrieve it, Captain America returned and asked her and the rest of the group what had become of his shield in his absence. She and the others explained and Captain America went with Spider-Man to retrieve it.
====Frightful Four encounter====
White Tiger and the rest of her group sans Spider-Man came into conflict with the Frightful Four. As they continued their four-on-four duel, Spider-Man arrived and aided the group. Soon enough, the Frightful Four were put on the verge of losing and retreated, but not before leaving a multitude of Octobots to fight them. As they battled them, White Tiger expressed her disbelief that the group could be so easily deceived. The group defeated them and White Tiger gloated over the team's victory, as well as Spider-Man's statement that the robots were difficult before wondering where he had wandered off to.

As it turned out, Spider-Man had been captured by [[Doctor Octopus]]. She and the rest of the group tried to find a way to him, eventually setting their sights on using an Octobot to track his location and lead them there as well. After the Octobot started to take off, she ran after it with the others and told Nova to move. As they arrived, they found themselves facing the Green Goblin. As the group fought him, White Tiger found herself on the receiving end of a blast of his and hit the ground after being shocked. After Spider-Man fought and narrowly escaped the Green Goblin, she returned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier alongside him and the others, where she was treated for her injuries.

====Destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier====
Against Spider-Man's wishes, White Tiger and her allies joined him in facing the Goblin. As Power Man explained, White Tiger and the others had stopped always taking orders and started to do what they thought was best, a trait of Spider-Man's that seemingly passed down to them. As Spider-Man continued his running from the Goblin with Harry, White Tiger and the others joined him in his evacuation. After Luke and Spider-Man successfully brought the Goblin to a state of unconsciousness, White Tiger contacted Nick Fury and the others and explained they had taken the Goblin down and were awaiting extraction before Spider-Man reminded the group of his earlier sentiments that they be left out of what he believed was his own fight. Soon enough, she and the other members of the group sans Spider-Man were shocked after the Goblin placed his hand in water and used it to carry over electricity to them.

She and the rest of the group fell back to get Harry to safety. The group took Harry to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, where they celebrated their seeming victory over the Goblin's destruction, only for the latter to crash into the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and attack everyone inside as well. Ava and the others fought off the Goblin, her jumping over a thrown piece of the Helicarrier and stood with her team as Harry reunited with his mutated father. Though she and the others tried to keep Harry from his dad, they were met with hostility as Harry transformed into [[Venom]]. After failing to stop the Goblin as a team, she evacuated the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier with her team sans Spider-Man and mourned over his seeming death saving them until he revealed himself to still be alive by showing up behind them. She and the others rushed to help him stand, as he was still weakened from his battle. However, a new problem emerged. With the Helicarrier down, White Tiger had nowhere to live. Spider-Man allowed his teammates to move in with him and she and the others were introduced individually to his May Parker.

===Living in Spider-Man's home===
Following the destruction of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Ava and the rest of her team moved into the home of Spider-Man, whom was the only one to not reside at the Helicarrier.
====Lizard and Electro====
[[File:White_Tiger_season_2_da.png|thumb|189px|Ava shortly before being neutralized.]]
During an investigation into a warehouse abandoned by [[Doctor Octopus]], Ava alerted Spider-Man of an impending threat and dispatched to fight it off. However, as she approached it, she was knocked unconscious as it speeded off to similarly attack and defeat the likes of [[Sam Alexander|Nova]], [[Power Man]], and [[Iron Fist]]. Following Spider-Man's failure to capture Doctor Octopus, whom revealed himself after defeating the four, she and the others were rushed home by Spider-Man and changed back into their regular clothes. Upon May Parker's arrival into the house, she and the others greeted her. Ultimately, Spider-Man chose to help Connors with his research and in the process resulted in the creation of [[Lizard (Spider-Man)|the Lizard]]. She and the rest of the group came to Spider-Man's aid. They proved successful and were able to revert him back to his former state.

Later, she and the rest of the group resided in the living room of the house before Spider-Man arrived. As he asked her to talk to him, she shushed him and explained that she was trying to listen to an online lecture. As the house's power went out, Ava openly expressed her sadness over not being able to listen to the online lecture. Instead, she observed [[Electro]] on her laptop and his speech regarding the power outage. As Iron Fist spoke, Ava questioned how Electro had become immensely powerful before Spider-Man urged the group to get dressed. In their mix up of clothes, Ava ended up with Power Man's costume while Spider-Man had hers.

She watched as Spider-Man struggled to gain control of his motorcycle and later questioned why Spider-Man could just web-sling the entire group before he revealed to her that his web shooters ran on electricity. White Tiger began to become embittered over the group's sudden disadvantages before Iron Fist explained to her that their loss of power forced them to explore the meaning of life. Shortly after his statement, Spider-Man hit his head directly into a stop light and the entire group fell to the ground. Spider-Man suggested the group goes old school and as a result, she and the others were pushed there by Power Man. After Power Man made a comment regarding the group needing to lose weight, Spider-Man exclaimed that White Tiger had been eating more desserts than the others. Angered by this rather rude comment, White Tiger pressed her claws into Spider-Man's shoulders and caused him to verbally express his discomfort. The group came to a stop, caused by several citizens angered over Spider-Man supposed involvement in their lack of electricity. The group started to throw thrash at him, as well as White Tiger and the others.

She and the others were dragged off by Spider-Man's Electro controlled motorcycle, where she screamed as it went at a high speed. She and the others briefly appeared before the moon before falling into a gutter. As they landed, White Tiger expressed her anger at Nova, whom she believed nearly killed them. Before Nova could issue a response, he was stepped on by Batroc the Leaper, whom White Tiger uttered the name of in response to his appearance. Though she and the others tried to subdue him, they fell individually to his powers and he succeeded in getting away. She chased Spider-Man with the others after the former had spotted Electro. She managed to dodge an incoming bus, which Power Man stopped from moving as Nova was hit. The group continued to help out those in the city until Electro revealed himself to them. His use of electricity caused Spider-Man to shoot webs at his teammates against his own will, resulting in Ava and the others being hit. After Electro escaped, Spider-Man asked if they noticed anything about Electro that they could use to their advantage.

Ava noted the way he had talked, to which Iron Fist responded by explaining that he had become more focused on his actions as he continued to use his powers. The group successfully took down Batroc the Leaper and were confronted by Electro after doing so. During their battle with Electro, White Tiger and Iron Fist were chased by several of his clones. As they regrouped with Nova and Power Man, they attacked the clones together and later, she punched Spider-Man on the shoulder after he defeated Electro. The group returned home and she joined the others in making fun of Spider-Man.

====Reunion with Kraven the Hunter====
During a training session, Ava became rampant and attacked Spider-Man without hesitation. Nova moved in to stop her but was quickly defeated and tossed aside as she ran into the streets and caused havoc. During her destruction of property, she ate several foods rather maliciously. After waking out of her trance, she claimed to have not remembered anything during her previous state of being and remembered only hearing a drum beat before losing control. By the next day, she became careless towards keeping herself in any type of redeemable condition and instead, became disgusting to her teammates as she drank from the carton. She went out and tried to attack a man wearing a rat costume before being pushed away by Spider-Man. She urged him to leave her alone, something Peter did not want to do. Spider-Man stated that she was family and the team wasn't going to let her fall like that.

She dusted him off and continued on her pursuit. She eventually found Kraven the Hunter, barely dodging a trap after Spider-Man came to her aid and pushed her out of the way. Though Kraven merely wanted her Tiger Amulet, White Tiger would not give it up and tried to fight him on her own. Despite Spider-Man's aid, she was less than willing to allow him to aid her and told him to leave her to face her own enemy. Spider-Man continued to ignore her wishes and fought by her side. As Spider-Man continued to question her, she revealed to him her motive for hating Kraven, being the fact that he had killed her father, as well as his own father. After Kraven managed to get her Tiger Amulet, Spider-Man believed the two to have won before White Tiger revealed that they had lost.

After Kraven stole her amulet, White Tiger was forced to resort to her own strength. Despite her initial unwillingness to do so, she found herself trying to fight off Kraven and several of the tigers he had attracted since becoming mutated by the Tiger Amulet. She succeeded in retrieving it and quickly overpowered Kraven. He was still unwilling to give up and she and Spider-Man took turns attacking him. After Kraven laid weakened, White Tiger prepared to finish him off before Spider-Man stopped her. Taking this as a mere obstacle, she ordered him to get out of her way. However, Spider-Man would not do so and instead revealed to her the story of how he lost his uncle. She related to him and chose to merely have Kraven incarcerated for his crimes. The two later talked privately, with Ava giving Spider-Man a hug for his involvement in stopping her old enemy. However, their conversation was cut short by the meddling of Nova, whom had spent his time recording the two. She then chased after him, soon followed by Spider-Man, whom himself wanted to get the two fighting on video.
