'''Celia Mae''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2001]] animated film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' She is [[Mike Wazowski]]'s Gorgon-Cyclops-Medusa-like girlfriend.

==Background==
Celia is the receptionist at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]], which means she takes calls from monsters and may click buttons for monster voicemail. Celia often calls [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] "'''Googley Bear'''" and "'''Googley Woogley'''" and even calls [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] "'''Sulley-Wulley'''", Mike often calls her "'''Schmoopsie-poo'''" and Sulley, in return, calls her "'''Celia-Weelia'''".

===Personality===
Celia is normally a sweetheart, especially to her boyfriend Mike. While she may have an explosive temper when angered, she can calm down almost immediately and quick when she is told the truth by Mike (after witnessing the statements Mike said are true).

The snakes that make up her hair do not speak but express their emotions with the sounds they make. When they're happy, they make chirping noises. When they're mad, they rattle and hiss. They often reflect whatever emotion Celia feels: when she is happy or mad, they likely feel the same way. Regardless, they still appear to have minds of their own as shown when they briefly express terror when Celia considers getting a haircut and relief when Mike respectfully objects.

===Physical appearance===
Celia is a slender, light, magenta monster with sentient purple hair that resembles 5 snakes whose tails act like her earrings. She wears a green slick, sleeveless dress with a scale print design and a blueish green puffy collar. She has a single aquamarine blue eye. Celia has one thing in common with her boyfriend: they both have one eye. Their eyes are also of similar colors.

==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''===
In the first film, Celia is celebrating her birthday, so Mike invites her to a Japanese restaurant called [[Harryhausen's]], she is later heard announcing [[Randall Boggs]] as the top scarer, before telling everyone to forget it when [[Sulley]] gets more screams in a sleepover. Later she goes to her birthday date with Mike, but due to [[Boo]] being in the restaurant, the place is decontaminated by the [[CDA]]. One device that is made to make a large dome that would get rid of fatal germs, but could harm people without CDA armor, which is why Celia comes back to work the next day with serious injuries. She and her snakes are very upset with Mike about how the date was ruined. Mike kisses her to try to make her feel better, but she angrily slaps him. Largely because of her hostile actions towards Mike, she also unknowingly exposed Mike as having at least some knowledge about Boo's presence in the Monster world towards Randall (as he was barely seen in the Newspaper headline photo), which forced Mike to flee from Celia. She later confronts him again with a near-tackle. While Sulley is hurriedly dragging them, Celia demands that Mike immediately explain what is happening or they're done. Mike instantly caves and tells her all about Waternoose and Randall's secret plot involving Boo (it was truly Randall, and not Mike, who ruined their date when he tried taking Boo to the Monster world). Initially, Celia doesn't believe a word he says but is then startled by Boo revealing herself. After hearing Mike reassure his love for her and seeing Randall following them, Celia now believes him that it was Randall who let Boo in, now realizing it was him who ruined their date (albeit indirectly), not Mike. She helps them by subduing Randall with a crowd after she feign-announces him breaking the all-time scare record, buying Sulley and Mike some time so they can get to Boo's door.

At the end of the film, Celia is shown to have fully recovered and reconciled with Mike and tells him that a box full of magazines has just arrived. Both she and Mike are surprised to see that Mike has made the cover of the magazine. She kisses him and her hair tickles his face.

The year before the film takes place, she and Mike are supposed to have won the 7-legged race at the year's company picnic.

Celia also appears in the company play "[[Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me]]" that her boyfriend has written, directed, and produced. She is seen having dinner with Mike during the restaurant scene and sings with the rest of the cast at the play's finale.

===''[[Monsters University]]''===
While absent from the film, a picture of Celia is seen along with her phone number in Mike's locker towards the end of the film.

=== ''[[Monsters at Work]]'' ===
Mike's first order of business after taking over the company is to promote Celia to a Laugh Floor Supervisor position.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
Celia appears in attractions based on the film such as [[Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!]] at [[Disney California Adventure]] and [[Monsters, Inc. Ride & Go Seek]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

===[[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]]===
Celia makes a minor appearance in the ride. Her voice is heard over the intercom telling the guests when they can enter the laugh floor.

==Trivia==
*Celia's name may be a play on the word "Cecaelia." It might also refer to Scylla, a monster in Greek mythology known for snatching up those who strayed too close to her with mouths attached to tentacle-like limbs (somewhat like Celia's snakes).
*An early model of Celia showed that she was originally going to have a twin head named Welia.
**Sulley actually called her Celia Welia near the beginning of the film.
*According to the book ''Monsters Inc.: The Essential Guide'', the five snakes serving as Celia's "hair" are named Amelia, Bobelia, Ophelia, Cordelia, and Madge.
*Celia makes a cameo at the end of ''[[Monsters University]]'' in a photo. Her phone number can also be seen.
*It is implied that Mike may have met Celia sometime after getting a job at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]].
*Celia having snakes for hair may have been a nod to the Greek mythology legendary figure, [[wikipedia:Medusa|Medusa]]. However, unlike Medusa who is bitter and can turn people into stone, Celia is kind and does not have any abilities.
**A subtle reference to Medusa's petrification abilities was utilized in the movie when Celia approached Mike just before Randall discovered Mike's unknowing involvement in intercepting Boo, as Mike froze in terror while Celia was storming towards him in fury over the ruined date and glaring directly at him.
*Celia's age, according to the handbook, is likely 24, making her at least three years younger than Mike.
*The read-along version never shows any of the scenes in which Mike makes up with Celia. This could fool the reader into thinking that Celia didn't appear again.
*In ''[[Monsters at Work]]'', in the episode "[[The Damaged Room]]", Celia sounds disappointed upon hearing Mike say he is immune to "kids' cuteness", but praises him when this is not the case. Based on her reaction, it is implied that she might want kids of her own with him.
