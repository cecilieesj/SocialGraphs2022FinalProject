'''K.C.''' (stands for '''Koala Casey''') is a koala who runs the nursery. She is also the only non-bird member at T.O.T.S..
==Personality==
She is a free spirited and caring young koala. She can handle multiple babies at the same time and knows tons of tricks to get babies to do what she wants.

K.C. enjoys spending "koala-ity" time with each baby, to help her understand what tricks work with each baby. In Season Two she has joined Pip and Freddy on delieveries, thanks to her "It Can Fly" helicopter pack.

==Appearance==
She is a light purple koala with a blue headband with a rainbow on it, hazel eyes, a magenta sweatshirt, a light blue skirt and yellow earrings. She also has very pink hair, rainbow socks and orange sneakers.

==Trivia==
*Her name is often misspelled as Kacey.
*K.C. is an expert climber, like most koalas.
*She almost never gets a sick day. In "[[Nursery Schooling]]", she got a case of the koala kachoos, which is a koala cold that only koalas get.
