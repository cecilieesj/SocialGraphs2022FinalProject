'''Bob Cratchit''' is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]'s underpaid clerk in the classic story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. Although a central figure of the tale, his passive character is overshadowed by that of [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. Cratchit is Scrooge's employee, a low-paid clerk with a large family. Though he is treated poorly by Scrooge, he is shown to be very loyal to his boss.

== Role in the film ==
Cratchit retains a loyalty to his boss despite the protestations of his wife. His youngest son, [[Tiny Tim]], is a cripple, and it is partly through concern for his plight that Scrooge makes the transformation from miser to philanthropist.

Bob Cratchit spends a normal day at work shivering, due to Scrooge rationing coal. Bob gets to the point of begging Scrooge to take Christmas Day off, so he can spend time with his family.

When [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]] is showing Scrooge the joy of Christmas, he shows how Bob Cratchit's family, despite being poor, are still grateful about the Christmas spirit.

When [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come]] shows Scrooge his future, it is shown that Bob Cratchit's youngest son, [[Tiny Tim]], died due to the lack food and medical help he needed thanks to Scrooge underpaying Bob Cratchit.

== Trivia ==
* In the album ''The Walt Disney Players: Dickens' A Christmas Carol'', the role of Bob Cratchit is played by [[Mickey Mouse]]. Mickey reprised the role for the 1983 cartoon ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''.
* In the ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'', Cratchit is played by [[Kermit the Frog]].

* In 2012, Kermit the Frog mistakenly confused Bob Cratchit with [[Captain Abraham Smollett]], to be the character he played on ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' several times during his promotional tour for ''[[w:c:muppet:Die Muppets (film)|Die Muppets]]'' in [[Germany]].

* In the movie, he turns out to be Charles Dickens.
