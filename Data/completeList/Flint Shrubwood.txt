'''Flint Shrubwood''' is an antagonist in ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. He appears in the episode "[[For a Few Sovereigns More]]".

The best bounty hunter in the land, he can track anything or anybody, even [[Gummi Bears]].

Shrubwood is hired by [[Duke Igthorn]], to capture a Gummi Bear. However, when Igthorn refuses to pay him for the capture of [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], he takes the Duke for ransom.

After Igthorn and Cubbi escape, Shrubwood hunts them, until he manages to acquire the pay that the Duke had refused him. Having acquired the gold, he lets both Igthorn and Cubbi go.
