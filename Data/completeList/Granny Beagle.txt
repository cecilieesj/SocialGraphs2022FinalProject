}}'''Granny Beagle''' is the grandmother of the [[Beagle Boys]], who appears in printed material only.

She has been featured in a number of comics, and acts as the leader of the Beagle Boys at times. She is usually the one to come up with schemes, either it be for a great heist or to break out of jail.

==Appearances==
Granny Beagle first appeared in the gag comic from ''The Beagle BoysÂ ''issue of February [[1967]], illustrated by [[Tony Strobl]] and Steven Steere.

In this comic, the Beagle Boys are in prison and expecting a visit from their granny. The prison guard remarks that they "maybe they'll feel more cooperative after a reunion with her". This assumption soon turns out to be wrong, as Grandma Beagle decides to break the walls of the prison with a pickaxe in order to see her grandchildren. The other prison guard exclaims, "she won't even ''visit'' according to regulations!"

==Trivia==
*Grandma Beagle's appearance varies depending on the source. In some comics, she has white or grey hair, and in others her hair is either blonde or red.
*According to some instances of the [[INDUCKS]] database, Granny Beagle is actually Auntie Beagle, and vise-versa. Because of their nearly identical designs, differentiating can be diffult; however, they have two distinctly different relations from the Beagle Boys: grandmother and aunt.
