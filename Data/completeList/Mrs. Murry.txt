At the beginning of the film, Dana Murry is described as a brilliant inventor according to Meg narrating to herself. Meg returns home upon hearing her mother calling her. The next day when Meg and [[Charles Wallace Murry|Charles Wallace]] return home, Ms. Murry uses the Internet and researches what tesseract is, to which she tells her daughter that she researched a new school for her called Again, explaining to Meg that she would find a Happy Medium someday. That night, Dana walks to her children explaining that she couldn't sleep as it is almost midnight. Later, [[Mrs. Whatsit]] enters the house and transforms from her crow form to her human form and has a conversation with the Murry family, where she explains to Dana that there is one such thing in the real world as a tesseract just before she leaves and transforms back to her crow form.

The next day, Sandy and Dennys head off for soccer practice just as she tells her children that no one is allowed to leave. After taking the twins to soccer, Dana returns home with the groceries in her bag. Later when Meg, Charles, and Calvin encounter the Happy Medium in his cave, he tunes in to Meg's family home where Meg's mother feels sad that her husband disappeared, hoping that he would return sometime, leading Meg, Charles, and Calvin to rescue Meg's missing father at Central Central Intelligence at Camazotz.

She then later appears when Meg returns to the real world with Charles Wallace, where Meg approaches her mother who is happy to see Meg back after not seeing her for a long time, alongside Charles Wallace to which while Meg's mother is preparing pineapple for Charles Wallace, he recaps about his adventures through the power of tesseract. Meg then explains to her mother about what really happened to her father to which Meg starts to realize that everything around Meg in this dimension is not real, as everything she feels around her is an illusion as she finds herself back at Camazotz again.

After Meg rescues Charles Wallace from the Man with Red Eyes (and It, the being itself), Meg and Charles Wallace return to the real world via tesseract with their father back in the real world where Mr. Murry's wife finally reunites with her husband just as she is happy to see Meg and Charles Wallace back where Mr. Murry explains to his wife that Meg saved him just as he praises Calvin for helping him as well. After Mrs. Ws praise Meg for her heroism alongside Charles Wallace, Mrs. Murry walks alongside her family mingling with each other while listening to Charles Wallace sharing his experience about the adventures he had with Meg and Calvin.
