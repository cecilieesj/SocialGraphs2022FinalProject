'''Karen''' is a VIP tour guide at [[Disneyland]]. She appears in ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''.

==Background information==
According to a video interview, the Karen in the game is based on the VIP tour guide that showed developers around the park, providing them with facts as they went around. The developers were so grateful that they asked her to be apart of the game. Apparently "signing her rights" away, Karen can be found in all around Disneyland, providing players with tidbits of Disneyland history and facts. Unlike the other meet-and-greet characters, she cannot be hugged, high-fived, danced with, sign autographs, or have pictures taken, unlike the real-life Karen.
