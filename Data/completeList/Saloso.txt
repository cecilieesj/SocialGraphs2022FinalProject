==Background==
Saloso and his malandro cronies were once territorial creatures that clashed with the peaceful sirenas over control of the seas of Cornado. The sirenas turned the tide and banished them to the shipwrecks of their enemies and kept them away through the coral alarms installed, which produced a debilitating sound for the malandros, throughout their kingdom.

===Physical appearance===
Saloso is a shapeshifter, but his default form is a river dolphin. Like the other malandros, anything he shapeshifts into is usually pink, including non-aquatic creatures such as humans.

==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==
When word got out that the sirena royal family decided to form a peace treaty with the humans, the sirenas' general, Daria, went to Saloso for his help, as they shared a common enemy in humans. Saloso at first denies the offer but changes his mind when Daria cut a deal with the malandros leader: if they helped Daria sabotage the unity pact, they get the coastline north of the city and can leave their dilapidated quarters. Saloso agrees to help Daria as long as she deactivates the coral alarms when they arrive, which she agrees to. After Daria leaves, Saloso orders Torpe to follow Daria to destroy all the deactivated alarms.

Onshore the next day, Daria meets with the malandros and proceeds with the plan. Taking the form of a human, Saloso plants himself on board [[Naomi Turner]]'s ship docked nearby while Torpe turns into a sirena. Once King Pescoro prepares to sign the treaty with [[Princess Elena]], Torpe pretends to be a sirena and sings to Saloso, pretending to be entranced, and accuses the sirena of leading him into danger. Convinced that the sirenas are still vile, the humans prepare to attack the innocent sirenas nearby, canceling the peace treaty. During the dissent, Saloso turns back and infiltrates the palace with the other malandros with no coral alarm to stip them. There, they capture the royal family when they return. Daria furiously confronts Saloso, stating that this wasn't part of their deal. Saloso simply laughs and unabashedly reveals Daria's treachery to the shocked sirenas. Ocho uses his ink to confuse the river dolphins and helps Daria and [[Princess Marisa]] escape, prompting Saloso to send the malandros after them.

Marisa returns with assistance from Elena and her friends. Using the [[Scepter of Light]], Elena tries to restore the coral alarms until Saloso and the other malandros arrive to attack the group. Saloso's minions narrowly incapacitate Elena's friends, but Elena successfully regrows the coral alarm, and it emits a noise that agitates the malandros. Saloso swears his vengeance as he retreats with the other river dolphins.
