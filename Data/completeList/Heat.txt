He is designed to fire orange heat lasers from the black oval-shaped bulb on his forehead. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]".

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Heat is an alien experiment that resembles a mix between a dog and a koala. He has small black eyes, thick arms and legs, a triangular nose, and a black oval on his forehead. His fur is red-orange while his underbelly is orange. 

===Powers and abilities===
True to his name, Heat is able to shoot out beams of heat energy from the oval-shaped bulb on his head.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 609 was the 609th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to shoot orange heat rays from the large bulb on his forehead. 609 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

609's pod eventually made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Hammerface|033]], [[Thresher|544]], and [[Plasmoid|617]], was discovered, stolen, activated, and named Heat by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in "[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]".

Back at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his duplicates after seeing that he had been split into four.

Heat engaged one of the clones in a duel. The clone picked up the couch to use as a weapon, but as he only possessed one-fourth of the original Stitch's strength, picking it up was a struggle for him. Seeing his chance, Heat used his heat ray to carve a hole in the bottom of the couch, and due to the sudden imbalance, it collapsed on top of the clone. Gantu then picked the latter up and placed him in a containment orb.

After capturing Stitch and his clones, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Dupe]]. When Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Heat into a hundred replicas. However, as the original Heat's power was divided among them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.

Presumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge the weakling Heat clones into the original.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Heat was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.

Heat reappeared in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Heat, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Heat participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by firing heat lasers at attacking Leroys.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Heat made an appearance in a later episode of the ''Stitch!'' anime along with [[Swapper]], both of whom [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] used in another plot. Heat was mistaken for [[Splodyhead]] by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]. Swapper switched [[Stitch]] and [[Hiroman]]'s bodies. Then, when Heat attacked, Hiroman required to figure out how to use Stitch's abilities to win. Heat later appeared in the special, ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.

==Trivia==
*Heat is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].
**Heat (alongside Hammerface, Thresher, and Plasmoid) was named by Gantu.
*Even though we saw Heat in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form along with Plasmoid, Thresher, and Hammerface, he was the only one activated onscreen.
*Heat is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*In the English dub of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime episode "Swapper 2.0", Heat is erroneously referred to as [[Splodyhead|Experiment 619/Splodyhead]], with Pleakley referring to Heat as "Experiment 619", and with Jumba adding, "Also known as Splodyhead!"
**The end credits not only also make this same error, but it also misspells Splodyhead's name as "Splod'''e'''yhead".
