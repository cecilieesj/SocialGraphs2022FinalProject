The '''Catbus''' is a supporting character in ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and a studio icon for [[Studio Ghibli]].
The Catbus is first seen making its bus rounds. [[Mei Kusakabe|Mei]] and [[Satsuki Kusakabe|Satsuki]] are waiting at the bus stop alongside [[Totoro]], when the Catbus arrives. Totoro boards the Catbus, and they leave the station. The second time the Catbus is seen is after Mei gets lost attempting to take corn to her sick mother in the hospital. Satsuki has been searching for a while, when she finally resorts to seeing Totoro. He calls the Catbus for her, and he takes her to Mei. After Mei has been found, he brings them to the hospital to bring their mother the corn. It is shown that the Catbus has others in his species, as shown by the exclusive short film, "Mei and the Kittenbus", all modeled after passenger vehicles. It is implied that the Kittenbus is his child.
