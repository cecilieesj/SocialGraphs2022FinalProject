Makini and Fuli then bring Kongwe pn their way to Pride Rock, despite that she walks very slow telling Fuli to be very patient, hiding in her shell, while Makini and Fuli push her to the canyon gorge with Fuli thinking of a faster way to get back to Pride Rock and the faster way to get to Pride Rock is to choose the path leading to the Backlands albeit to keep an eye out for Makucha where upon encountering him and trying to get past, Makucha suddenly attacks the three. Fuli tries to catch him but is unable to as Kongwe gives her advice to observe the leopard by watching him. Fuli manages to follow the wise tortoise's advice and successfully catches Makucha, making him retreat. Upon doing so, Kongwe feels satisfied of the cheetah listening to the tortoise's advice.
