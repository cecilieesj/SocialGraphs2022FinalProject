Claude has green feathers and speaks in a [[Britain|British]] accent, while Clyde has red feathers and speaks in a Southern dialect. Their perch is Citrikua, a fictitious Tiki God of Health, named to evoke the Florida Citrus Growers that sponsored the original Sunshine Pavilion.

The two tell a story about how they first discovered the Sunshine Pavilion during a flight through the jungles of Adventureland, with Clyde making various animal sounds as Claude describes the things they encountered.

==Alter-egos==
When Orlando and Tokyo had their Tiki Rooms undergo their respective overhauls, the toucans were recast as new characters:
*For [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Under New Management]], they became Hollywood agents named William (voiced by [[Don Rickles]]) and Morris (voiced by [[Phil Hartman]]), who represented [[Iago]] and [[Zazu]] and were very enthusiastic about them taking over the Tiki Room.
*In [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]], they became a hip-hop group named 2-Can, who was perched on a DJ record player with Citrikua being equipped with a boom-box. The Toucan preshow was not kept when the attraction was turned into [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]] and was instead replaced by narration describing the Tiki Room.
