'''María Vasquez''' is one of the two main protagonists in ''[[West Side Story]]''. She is a young [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] girl who was raised in [[United States|America]] in [[New York City]] by her older brother [[Bernardo Vasquez|Bernardo]]. 

==Background==

===Personality===
María is a fiercely independent 18-year-old girl who desires to have a life of her own away from the harshness of New York City's gentrification. She is shown to be slightly subservient to her brother Bernardo, but upon meeting Tony aims to make her own decisions. She is proud of her Puerto Rican heritage, but wants to embrace her home in America. María despises the violence that her brother takes part in and is motivated to escape such debauchery with Tony; unaware of the bleak conclusion that awaits him.

==Trivia==
*Prior to [[Rachel Zegler]] portraying María, she was played by seven actresses. When the original Broadway show opened back in [[1957]], María was portrayed by Carol Lawrence and then by Marlys Watters when the show opened on the West End the year after. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, Natalie Wood portrayed her with her singing dubbed over by Marni Nixon. In the [[1980]] Broadway revival, she was played by Josie de Guzman, Josefina Scaglione in the [[2009]] revival, and then by Shereen Pimentel in the [[2020]] revival.
