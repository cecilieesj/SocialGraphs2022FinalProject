'''Klutzy the Crab''' (Clubpenguinus Crabus) is a villainous crab and the secondary antagonist of the MMORPG, ''[[Club Penguin]]''.

He saved [[Herbert P. Bear]] from drowning when he first arrived on Club Penguin Island after traveling from the North Pole on an Iceberg. Since then, he has been involved in a lot of Secret Missions as Herbert's evil sidekick. As revealed in The F.I.S.H., Klutzy is male and is probably Herbert's best friend.
