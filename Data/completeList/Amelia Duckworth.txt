“What if, instead of, Softball: The Musical, we call it, Amelia: The Musical?”|image=Queen Of Dumb.jpeg}}'''Amelia''' is a Vuuugle star and character from ''Bizaardvark'', and her channel 'Perfect Perfection' is based off of beauty.

== Personality ==
Amelia is an extremely egotistical beauty and lifestyle guru. She is also extremely dim-witted, and only cares about herself (as shown mainly in seasons 1 and 2). Her lack of intelligence becomes more obvious later in the show. However, she easily becomes friends with Paige and Frankie. She is primarily a good friend towards Paige and Frankie, though believes Bernie and Dirk to be relatively gross and simple, as shown often. There is actually no doubt that Amelia is oblivious to what other people think about her, because she thinks she is perfect and believes that the world revolves around her, when really, she is imperfect and foolish. Examples of her imperfection and unintelligence are shown. For example, in ''PK In Da House'', she lets out a huge burp and rubs her stomach. She seems more mature in the first season of the show. In ''Paige's Birthday Is Gonna Be Great'' Amelia assigns everyone jobs for the party except the DareMeBro duo so they attempt to get ice but only end up with a machine full of water, showing that Amelia doesn't find them smart.

==Appearance ==
She has blonde, wavy hair, and has a thin structure. In half of Season 2 and Season 3, she has bangs. She also has blue eyes.
