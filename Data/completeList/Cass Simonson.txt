[[File:Cass_Simonson_Model_Sheet.jpg|thumb]]'''Cass Simonson''' is a background character of the [[Disney XD]]'s series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.

==Biography==
She attends [[Norrisville High]] School as a student.

==Trivia==
*She is based on production coordinator Jenava Hudek.
*She was dressed up as a pumpkin in "[[Night of the Living McFizzles]]".
*She is apparently very good at playing video games, as in "[[Weinerman Up]]", she has either second, third, or fourth place on all the scoreboards in Greg's Game Hole.
*Cass, Heidi Weinerman, and Cynthia are seen talking together during the montage of Randy wasting smokebombs in "[[Silent Punch, Deadly Punch]]".
**In the same episode, as she's walking with the Nameless Girl with Red Shirt and the Nameless Cowbell Player, they come across Bucky crying, watch in surprise as he gets stanked and becomes a monster, and run away screaming.
*In "[[House of 1,000 Boogers]]," she and Nameless Girl with Blonde Ponytail are seen chatting, looking apalled at Randy and Howard drinking from the choco-fountain, and getting a bucket of water poured over them by Bash and his friends, much to their annoyance.
*She is one of the girls whom [[Dickie]] checked and threw away because she wasn't Tawny in "[[Stank'd to the Future]]". Randy caught her before she slammed into the ground.
*At the club in "[[Sorcerer in Love 2: The Sorceress' Revenge]]", Cass is seen chatting with [[Theresa Fowler]].
*She is one of Howard's victims in "[[Escape from Detention Island]]", getting stuck to the ceiling in the cafe-tastrophe.
*In "[[Evil Spirit Week]]" in the final photo she is also photo-bombing the picture, doing the old time boxer next to Randy while he is doing invisible sandwich.
