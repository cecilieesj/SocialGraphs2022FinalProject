==Background==
When the crew of the [[U.S.S. Palomino|Palomino]] arrives at the command tower, Maximilian is the first robot to approach them and almost threatens to eliminate them until Dr. Reinhardt orders him to stand down.

He assists Captain Holland, Pizer, and V.I.N.CENT require the parts they need to repair their ship but shows no trust toward the visitors, especially when he catches Holland snooping around.

When [[Kate McCrae|Kate]] and Alex try to escape after finding out Reinhardt's dark secret, Maximilian engages them and kills Alex much to Reinhardt's disgust.

When the [[U.S.S. Cygnus|Cygnus]] is on the edge of destruction, Reinhardt orders him to prepare the Probe Ship but instead goes after the crew of the Palomino, leaving his master pinned down against a huge monitor. He takes them by surprise and shoots [[B.O.B.]]. V.I.N.CENT fights him off while the crew escapes to the Probe Ship. He nearly destroys V.I.N.CENT until he drills through his circuitry and lifelessly gets sucked away into the black hole.

Reinhardt and Maximilian are merged together and are last seen standing upon a hellish landscape.

===Personality===
Although he doesn't express what he thinks in words, his sharp stiff body language does the talking. He shows no trust toward strangers especially when they are considered as guests. Even though he is [[Hans Reinhardt|Reinhardt's]] loyal number one, he's also known to be disobedient and will do as he pleases when he kills Dr. Durant or ignores Reinhardt's cry for help.

==Trivia==
*The Basher [[Beetleworx]] takes on the form of Maximilian in [[Tomorrowland|Tomorrow City]] in ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.
*Maximillian is cited as one of the inspirations for the Omnidroid in ''[[The Incredibles]]'', which was released 25 years later, in [[2004]].
*In the film, Dr. Reinhardt is trapped within the body of Maximilian, in hell. Thus, a character played by [[Maximilian Schell]] spends eternity...in Maximilian's shell. However, the robot was already called Maximilian (in the script) before the actor Schell was cast. So the names are a coincidence.
*A popular fan theory suggests that the brain of [[Frank McRae]] (Kate's father) was used to create Maximilian, in punishment for McCrae's attempted revolt against Reinhardt, and that the angel shown in the final scene is McCrae ascending to Heaven.
