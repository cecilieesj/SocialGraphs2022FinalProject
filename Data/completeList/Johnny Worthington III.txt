'''Johnny "The Jaw" Worthington''' is the main antagonist of the [[2013]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Monsters University]]''. He is a Satan-like Monster with purple fur, two fangs (where his nickname originated from), and a muscular body.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Johnny Worthington has reason to be supremely confident—he's the top Scare student at Monsters University and president of the best fraternity on campus, Roar Omega Roar. Johnny comes from a long line of MU Scarers and respects the school's legacy, traditions and most of all, the system by which Scaring excellence is judged. He may have been born with a silver spoon in his jaws, but this monster's no softy.''<ref>[http://www.bvifinland.fi/uploads/text/MONSTERS_UNIVERSITY_Production_notes_with_credits_FINAL_05-31-13.pdf ''Monsters University'' Production Notes]</ref>

===Personality===
As president of RΩR, the premiere campus fraternity, Worthington is very selfish and egotistical and only interested in having "the most elite" Scarers in his fraternity, inviting [[James P. Sullivan]] to join, as the latter comes from a family of successful Scarers, but mockingly denies [[Mike Wazowski]] and suggesting he joins a fraternity that's "more his speed."

Worthington clearly cares more about his fraternity's reputation (taking grades and academics into account), when he threatens to kick Sulley out of RΩR if he doesn't beat Mike in the final exam. When Mike and Sulley are both kicked out of the Scaring Program by Dean Hardscrabble, Worthington and his frat-boys leave without a word to Sulley.

His rivalry towards Mike escalates when, right before the Scare Simulator, Worthington arrogantly tells Mike not to take losing so hard and that "he never belonged in the Scaring Program anyway." Mike wins the Scare Games due to Sulley's tampering of the settings, thus humiliating and surprising RΩR in its defeat. Worthington is not a sore loser as he accepts defeat, offering Sulley back to their group in Randy's place only for Sulley to reject his offer and give him the trophy since he is more concerned in rescuing Mike.

Despite his arrogance, sets art director Robert Kondo explains that he has something to lose, is afraid of failure and has a tradition to live up to.

==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters University]]''===
Johnny Worthington first meets [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] and [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] after the two have been led to the Greek row by [[Archie the Scare Pig]]. As other fraternities are trying to get Sulley to join them, Johnny welcomes Sulley and takes him to be a [[Roar Omega Roar]]. When Mike tries to attract his attention, Johnny "kindly" tells him that he would be better with [[Oozma Kappa]], the weakest-looking fraternity.

As the semester goes by, the RΩRs are increasingly disappointed by Sulley and feel threatened by Mike as Mike is doing extremely well in the Scare Program as Mike is getting good grades due to taking the material seriously and working hard while Sully does poorly as he dismisses the need to know “that stuff” to the point where he doesn’t learn anything about Scaring that he doesn’t already know. Johnny finally signifies to Sulley that if he fails the final exam to Mike, he will be removed from RΩR.

Johnny is with the RΩRs on the subscription day for the [[Scare Games]] and laughs when Mike presents himself to the competition. The RΩR have great success at the games, coming first at all challenges. However, against all odds, Oozma Kappa somehow stays in the competition after two rounds.

The OKs are invited to a party at the RΩR house that will actually be their doom. In front of everyone present, Johnny congratulates the OKs of how good they did in the Scare Games and invites them to the stage. But when OK are on stage, Johnny tells his brothers to spill on them paint, glitter and flowers. [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] spills bunny dolls on them and [[Chet Alexander|Chet]] photographs them. Johnny and the RΩRs open a stand next day and massively sell products featuring the embarrassing picture, supposedly to collect funds for a "good" cause. He tells them that no matter what, they'll never be real scarers, to which they took to heart.

When they see the OKs continue to perform better and better at the Scare Games, Johnny and his crew are increasingly upset but hope to get the last word at the final race, which tests how scary a monster really is. At the last race, the fight between OK and RΩR is intense. Johnny is highly irritated by Randy's failure. Johnny is on the last and decisive face-off, where he is against Mike. Confident of his win, he repeats one last time to Mike his place is not here and then proceeds to get a near-perfect score. But Mike gets the maximum score, a full scream can, beating Johnny and bringing the victory to OK, much to Johnny's shock.

Following the race, Johnny tries to bring Sulley back to RΩR at the place of Randy, but Sulley refuses and gave the trophy to him, then heads off to save Mike from both entering the door lab and end up stuck in the real world, leaving Johnny and his gang utterly confused.

During the credits, it is shown that Johnny got a job as a scarer at Fear Co.

===''[[Party Central]]''===
Johnny Worthington briefly appears in ''Party Central''. He enters the hall of the RΩR house, preparing to greet his guests, but he is shocked to see instead the room empty of both monsters and supplies.

==Trivia==
*The RΩR house's interior was based on a backstory Johnny had.
*In [[Disney Tsum Tsum (game)|Disney Tsum Tsum]], Johnny could be fought as a boss during the Japan Pixar Story Books Event in March 2020 and the International Pixar Storybooks Event in May 2020. He was erroneously referred to as "Johnny Washington" in the International version.
*Like [[Chef Skinner|Skinner]], Johnny technically both loses and wins, since while he loses the Scare Games, it is revealed that Sulley cheated by setting the difficulty to easy so that makes RΩR winners by default. Unlike Skinner, who ultimately loses in the end despite having shut down Gusteau's, Johnny ultimately wins in the end since they are the true winners of the Scare Games since Sulley cheated, although he and his team never knew about it despite losing. As a result, the winner remains disputed or deduced by viewers.
*Nathan Fillion would later voice [[Sterling]] in [[Cars 3]].
*His name might be similar to [[Honest John]]'s real name, John Worthington Foulfellow.
