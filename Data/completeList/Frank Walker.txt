'''John Francis "Frank" Walker''' is the main protagonist of the [[2015]] film, ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''.

He is a cranky inventor and an ally to [[Casey Newton]].

==Official Description==
"Frank is a disenchanted grump who was a bit of a dreamer as a young boy, a smart little scientist kid. Young Frank goes to a place that he thinks is the greatest in the universe and he believes the world is going to be much better off because of it. He finds out that those things were untrue and becomes probably the most cynical person one could be. He isolates himself on his family farm and plans to spend the rest of his life there but is forced to deal with his past because of situations that happen in the film."

==Tomorrowland (2015)==
In the beginning, Frank explains his story.

==Trivia==
* If the movie does happen in 2015, it makes Frank 58 years old at the time. He's implied to have benefited from the recipe of Tommorowland's protein shakes to delay his aging.
