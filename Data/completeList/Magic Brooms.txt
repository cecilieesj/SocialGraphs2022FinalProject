The '''Magic Brooms''' are characters from [[Walt Disney]]'s film ''[[Fantasia]]''. They are the main antagonists in "[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]" segment.

==Background==
===﻿Designs===
The brooms are besom brooms with brown handles and yellow bristles. They have been animated by magic, and have sprouted thin, brown arms and four-fingered hands as a result. Their bristles are their "legs". The brooms are constantly seen carrying one brown bucket of water in each hand. Each bucket has a silver handle and two silver hoops around them.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''===
In the short, one broom is brought to life by [[Mickey Mouse]]. He had done the spell in order for the broom to do his work, instead. The plan goes by smoothly until Mickey falls asleep and wakes up hours later once the building is flooded. Mickey tries to stop the broom but it does not work. Mickey then grabs an ax and chops the broom into pieces. From the two halves, as well as the scattered splinters, an entire army of water-carrying brooms arises, and the entire room is soon filled with water. Eventually, Mickey's mentor [[Yen Sid]] comes and ends the chaos.

===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===
The brooms made a cameo appearance in the film, sweeping at the [[Maroon Cartoons|Maroon Cartoons Studio]] while a man plays "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" on a saxophone.

===''[[Darkwing Duck]]''===
Two brooms made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode "[[Hot Spells]]". When they appear, Beezelebub is peeved that they don't clean windows.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
In the television series ''[[House of Mouse]]'', the brooms make cameos along with many other Disney characters. In the show, the brooms work at the club as its janitors as well as its means of extinguishing fires and are frequently seen sweeping with modern brooms as a joke. In the episode "[[Donald's Lamp Trade]]", one of the brooms (taking a role similar to [[Magic Carpet]] when he follows [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] in the [[Cave of Wonders]]) follows Donald and they end up walling off of [[Pride Rock]] and go flying.

===''[[Tangled]]''===
A Magic Broom made a cameo appearance as a regular broom at the Town Square.

===[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (film)|''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' (film)]]===
A modernized version of the Magic Brooms appear. Besides the brooms, mops, sponges and spray cans join in on attempting to "clean" [[Dave Stutler]]'s lab. Unlike previous incarnations where they pay no heed to the apprentice and mindlessly fulfill what they have been asked, the cleaning products in this version are mischievous and downright antagonistic with a spray can spraying Dave in the face when he attempts to stop them. They all cease moving once [[Balthazar Blake]] arrives to stop them.

===''[[Kingdom Keepers]]''===
In ''[[Kingdom Keepers II: Disney at Dawn]]'', the Broomsticks follow Finn around Hollywood Studios. In ''[[Kingdom Keepers V: Shell Game]]'', they attack the DHI base with buckets of acid but are thwarted by [[Charlene Turner]].

=== ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'' ===
In ''Once Upon a Time'', the magic broom is an enchanted, walking broomstick that [[Rumplestiltskin]] used in order to find the [[The Apprentice (character)|Sorcerer's Apprentice]] in the town of [[Storybrooke]].

==Video games==
===''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]''===
The Brooms appear as enemies in this game.

===''[[Fantasia (video game)|Fantasia]]''===
The Brooms appear as enemies in this game as well.

===''[[Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge]]''===
The Brooms also appear as enemies in this game first encountered in the Palace levels usually in the slippery ice parts.

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Magic_Broom_KH3D.png|right|250px]]
The Brooms appear in both ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as housekeepers (and occasionally guards) of [[Disney Castle]]. As before, the Brooms are silent, but it is because they are so busy that they never talk to Sora and company. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', the Brooms arrest and remove [[Pete]] at [[Minnie Mouse|Queen Minnie]]'s command. They also appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' in Symphony of Sorcery, and play a role similar to their appearance in ''Fantasia''.

===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===
The brooms appear in the ''Fantasia''-based transition stages and in the ending credits animation chasing a Blotling. They also serve as the inspiration for the [[Sweepers|Sweeper Blotlings]]. A lifeless broom can be seen in Yen Sid's studies during the opening. The Magic Brooms reappear in the sequel, ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.

===''[[Disney Infinity]]''===
The Magic Brooms appear in ''Disney Infinity'' as enemies, however, several seem to aid Sorcerer Mickey as one of his attacks. In the 3DS version, they appear as cameos on the game board moving space turning them into coin spaces.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Brooms_WDW.jpg|thumb|250px|The brooms at Walt Disney World.]]

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
They were seen along with Mickey Mouse's float in the ''[[Celebrate A Dreams Come True Parade]]'' at the [[Magic Kingdom]].

The brooms also have topiaries at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

In ''[[Mickey's PhilharMagic]]'', when Donald accidentally loses the sorcerer hat, he journeys off into different Disney films including Fantasia where the brooms splash the water in the buckets onto Donald eventually leading him to ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. This attraction also shows 2 exclusive broom variations: a tiny broom with a single normal-sized bucket (which Donald took so the broom wouldn't splash him), and an enormous broom with a single and equally giant bucket (which it used to flood over Donald after it got him to return the tiny broom's bucket).

In [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]' version of ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', the brooms make minor cameos during the floating bubble sequence.

===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===
In [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s version of ''Fantasmic!'', they appear marching on the Sorcerer's Hat stage during the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence opening the show.

They also appeared at [[Remember... Dreams Come True|Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland]] opening scene before Mickey takes the balcony on the [[Cinderella Castle]] in shadow note.

===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===
Multicolored variants of the Magic Brooms appear in the ''Fantasia'' scene of ''[[Voyage to the Crystal Grotto]]'', dumping water on Sorcerer Mickey.

==Other appearances==
*[[Genie]] from [[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]] impersonated one of the brooms (though still retaining his face) in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|tv series spin-off]].
