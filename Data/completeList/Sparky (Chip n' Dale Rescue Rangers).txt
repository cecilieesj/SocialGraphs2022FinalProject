'''Sparky''' is a laboratory rat who appears in the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode, "[[Does Pavlov Ring a Bell]]".

== Appearance ==
Sparky is a tall rat in a labcoat, thin except in the haunches and almost gangly. His light, short hair is tousled and spiked in all directions due to an excess electrostatic charge he always carries. His light-colored eyes and constricted pupils give him a look of intelligent mania.

== Personality ==
Sparky is scatterbrained, spaced-out, and easily distracted, even more so than Gadget, and suffers occasional memory lapses that cause him to essentially repeat himself. His exposure to electroshock may aggravate his problems. Like [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]], he does not perceive social nuances very well and is unaware of the destructive tendencies of Gadget's inventions, seeing them as experiments to be played with and tweaked. Despite his shortsightedness, Sparky has a strong ethical code and believes firmly that science is to be put to good use. He also considers himself to be a genius. He is later enraged when he learns that [[Professor Norton Nimnul]] is abusing it and instantly turns against Nimnul.

== History ==
Sparky was a laboratory mouse, who was used in the experiments of Professor Norton Nimnul. As a laboratory mouse he developed a pretty high charge of static electricity. He has been conditioned by Nimnul to operate as an automaton when he hears the sound of a whistle. His standard action in this condition is to find and hotwire an alarm bell to activate Buzz, a currently-tested guinea pig, who Nimnul used for the reflexes of robbing banks.

The [[Rescue Rangers]] first meet him when he is inside a pile of junked electronics when Gadget, looking for parts, mistakenly pulls his tail. Sparky shares a common interest with Gadget Hackwrench in both science and physics, and Gadget is happy to be understood by someone and enjoys his company. This skyrockets the jealousies of [[Chip and Dale]]. After leaving Nimnul's charge, he leaves for MIT with his cohort, Buzz.

== Trivia ==

* Sparky's voice actor, Danny Gans, also voiced [[Moose and Rocco|Rocco]] from the ''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'' episode "[[Out of Scale]]".
