They only strike during the winter and manage to escape without being seen (their photo on the wanted posters is so blurry due to them moving so fast).

==Background==
Sheriff Callie first gets word of the bandits' thievery at the town of Junctionville. When she investigates, she finds that everything silver has already been takenâ€”and the only things left behind are tracks left by their ice skates. Callie follows the trail back to [[Nice and Friendly Corners]] and deduces they will be after the trophy for the Silver Skates Ice Contest. She spots Sneaky and Speedy in the audience, and when they catch sight of her, they split. They nab the Silver Skates trophy, and also grab Callie's ice skates so she can't pursue them on the slippery ice. But Abigail Crane is still wearing her skates, and goes to catch up with [[Deputy Peck]], who then notices Sneaky and Speedy with the trophy. Abigail and Peck decide to pair up to stop the bandits, and corner them by using the Quadruple Lasso Loop. They skate a figure eight around the bandits so fast that they end up cutting the surrounding ice, trapping the brothers on a pair of ice floes. Callie then lassoes the Silverado Brothers and then puts them "on ice".
