{{Quote|I'm not gonna fight your war! I'm gonna end it!|Captain Marvel to [[Talos]]|Captain Marvel (film)}}

'''Carol Danvers''', also known as '''Captain Marvel''', is a superheroine from [[Marvel Comics]]. An Air Force lieutenant turned Colonel and a Captain in the [[Kree]] army after an explosion from a lighter-than-speed engine powered by the [[Tesseract]] gave Carol cosmic powers, which she uses as a protector of the universe, taking the mantle of Captain Marvel from the heroic Kree who invented the engine (and befriended Carol), [[Mar-Vell]].

She has appeared in several Marvel animated series. She debuted in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as the titular protagonist of the [[2019]] live-action film ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' and also appeared in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.

Carol Danvers was created by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan.

==Background==
Born as Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel grew up engaged in numerous sports and activities. However, she grew estranged from her father because he thought none of her hobbies were healthy for females to be involved in (given Carol was born in the mid-1960s). After becoming disconnected from her family, Carol joined the United States Air Force, where she met [[Maria Rambeau]] and became her best friend. Thanks to her hardships in childhood, she had an unquenchable thirst to prove herself, which allowed her to conquer the trials she faced during her training in the US Air Force. Later on, she became the godmother of Maria's daughter, [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]]. Around this time, she befriended a scientist named Wendy Lawson and her "cat", [[Goose]]. She helped Wendy in developing an experimental light-speed engine for an aircraft that could aid in ending wars. Higher, Further, Faster

===Personality===
Before becoming a superhero, Carol was dedicated and proud in her work and achievements, never allowing the antics of others to distract her or others from their more important and urgent matters. She believed in keeping a professional level in dealing with other coworkers. Even without powers, she was shown to be brave and bold, constantly getting back up every time she fell and refusing to give up in the face of overwhelming odds. Only when a situation seemed disastrous did she even consider changing her mind. She protected and helped others. She was shown to have a dry wit and a short temper. She also seems to be quick to judge others.

The explosion that gave her powers not only stripped her of her memory, but also her personality, as she was consequently led by the Kree, particularly Yon-Rogg, to believe that her name was Vers, they had given her her powers by implanting a device on her neck (which was actually limiting them), and could strip them by removing it, that the Kree were "noble warrior heroes" and the Skrulls were evil aliens who would use their shapeshifting abilities to destabilize civilizations across the universe. This, combined with her training under Yon-Rogg's mentorship, resulted in Carol becoming an unemotional, naive warrior. Her strength as a warrior had also been increased by a blood transfusion from Yon-Rogg, transforming her into a human-Kree hybrid.

When she regained her memories, she also saw Kree and Skrulls alike for their true nature, realizing that she had committed war crimes on the Kree's orders, and actively began seeking redemption by finishing Mar-Vell's work, which involved helping the Skrulls find a new home planet, and fighting with them against the Kree. Since she retained her training as Vers and her newer memories, instead of being the original, flawed Carol Danvers or the trained Vers alone, she became the best of both.

===Powers and abilities===
====Powers====
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Captain Marvel is superhumanly strong to an unknown limit. 
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Captain Marvel's skin, bones, and tissue are far denser and resistant to damage when compared to an ordinary human. Like her physical strength, Captain Marvel's maximum durability has been compared to Hulk and Thor, who are both incredibly durable themselves. Her durability is increased by the fact that she is able to absorb energy, both by the fact that most energy-based attacks are rendered ineffective, and because the absorption of said energy actually increases the amount of damage her body is capable of taking.
*'''Longevity:''' Thanks to a Kree blood transfusion in the 1990s, Carol ages extremely slow; remaining in the prime of her late 20s for many decades. Even in her late 50s/early 60s in 2023, Carol still remains youthful as she did 30 years ago.
*'''Flight:''' Captain Marvel is able to soar through the air at high speeds and with great maneuverability. Her top speed is unknown. Her flight speed could presumably be increased by the absorption of energy.
*'''Energy Manipulation:''' Carol's altered physiology has endowed her with the ability to naturally harness all forms of energy and to utilize in battle.
**'''Energy Projection:''' Captain Marvel is able to project bursts of energy from her hands as a form of ranged combat.
**'''Energy Absorption:''' Captain Marvel is able to absorb various kinds of energy. This energy serves to increase her other abilities, allowing her to become far stronger, take more damage, fly faster, and produce even more powerful energy blasts. This power also means that most energy attacks are rendered completely ineffective against Captain Marvel, leaving foes with such powers defenseless against her.

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''====
While she doesn't physically appear in ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Captain Marvel was alluded to when the device [[Nick Fury]] uses to send a "Code Red" on, right before he and [[Maria Hill]] fade away, displays her insignia as a mean to summon Captain Marvel back to Earth quickly for the emergency situations [[Thanos]] caused.

====''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''====

====''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''====
[[File:Avengers-endgame-movie-screencaps.com-885.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Captain Marvel rescues [[Iron Man]] and [[Nebula]] after the two get stranded in outer space, returning them to Earth. She is then informed of Thanos succeeding in wiping out half of the universe's population with his [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. Captain Marvel was saddened to discover that [[Nick Fury]] was among those killed from Thanos's snap. Captain Marvel then attended to Iron Man when he collapsed after angrily arguing with [[Captain America]] on their failure to stop Thanos. Furious with Thanos's action, Captain Marvel attempted to go confront and kill Thanos herself, only to be relent when the Avengers tell they work as a team. After locating Thanos, Captain Marvel informed the Avengers that if they use the [[Infinity Stones]], they can revive everyone killed by the snap and they would be able to win with her on their side. When questioned by [[War Machine]] on her absence from Earth, Captain Marvel dryly responded that she had a responsibility to a multitude of other planets that did not have the protection of the Avengers. They all then agreed upon the mission. [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] tested Captain Marvel by summoning Stormbreaker in front of her, which she did even flinch from. Thor became impressed with Captain Marvel where she joined the remaining Avengers in finding and confronting Thanos.

[[File:Avengers Endgame - Women 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Later, after [[Hulk|Hulk/Bruce Banner]] uses the Infinity Gauntlet to undo the snap and bring everyone back to life, Captain Marvel joins the rest of the heroes in their fight against [[Thanos]] and his army of [[Chitauri]], Outriders and the [[Black Order]]. Captain Marvel and a team of heroines fight off against Thanos's army while Captain Marvel attempts to take the Infinity Gauntlet to into a quantum tunnel in [[Scott Lang]]'s van. However, Thanos destroyed the van before Captain Marvel can reach it, preventing her from returning the [[Infinity Stones]] to their proper timelines. As Thanos attempted to take the Gauntlet, Captain Marvel flew towards him. The two then fought, but when Thanos grabbed her arm, he threw her away. Captain Marvel then rushed back to stop Thanos, who now wore the Gauntlet, but she was able to stop him from snapping his fingers.

As Captain Marvel held his fingers apart, Thanos attempted to headbutt her, but it did not affect her. Captain Marvel then used her superior strength to overpower Thanos, pushing him down as she levitated above him. However, Thanos removed the [[Orb|Power Stone]] from the Gauntlet and used it to increase his strength as he punched her, sending her flying away. However, Thanos was prevented from snapping his fingers by Iron Man who removed the Infinity Stones from the Gauntlet and put them on his own, wiping out Thanos and his army by snapping his own fingers.

After the defeat of Thanos and his army, Captain Marvel attended Iron Man's funeral, along with the Avengers and other heroes she fought alongside, to pay her respects. She also reunited with Nick Fury for the first time in years before she returned to space.

====''[[WandaVision]]''====
Captain Marvel never appears in the series, but she is mentioned. In the fourth episode, "[[We Interrupt This Program]]", [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] hears Carol's voice, in her head, after being resurrected, via the [[Avengers: Endgame|Blip]]. In the fifth episode, "[[On a Very Special Episode...]]", [[Jimmy Woo]] argues, that the only person who came close to killing [[Thanos]] besides [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]], was Captain Marvel, and [[Darcy Lewis|Darcy]] recalls how she gained her powers from an infinity stone, like Wanda. Monica's expression hardens, after hearing mention of Carol, and she tells Darcy and Jimmy that they're not talking about her. In the [[All-New Halloween Spooktacular!|sixth episode]], [[Director Hayward]] mentions Monica's past with Carol Danvers, when accusing her of advocating on the behalf of super-powered individuals. In the [[Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision)|seventh episode]], Monica can hear Carol's voice, amongst others, as she passes through the Hex.

====''[[What If...?]]''====
Captain Marvel first appeared as a cameo character at the end of episode "[[What If... The World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?]]", summoned by Nick Fury, after he found Captain America frozen in ice.

She reappears in the seventh episode "[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]", where she was summoned by Acting Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[Maria Hill]] to put a stop to Thor's party antics. She first arrived in Paris to confront the Party God.

In the [[What If... Ultron Won?|eighth episode]], Ultron invades [[Xandar]]. She attempts to put a stop to him by ramming him to the planet's core, but was killed by Ultron when he unleashed the power of the Infinity Stones, destroying multiple planets in the system.

In the first season finale "[[What If... The Watcher Broke His Oath?]]", Captain Marvel from the third episode reappears at the end of the episode, fighting against [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] and his army alongside Captain America and Nick Fury; she is shortly joined by another version of [[Black Widow]] from another universe.

====''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]''====
[[File:Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings - Mid Credits scene.png|thumb|250px]]
Captain Marvel appears in the films mid-credit scenes. [[Wong]] escorts [[Shang-Chi]] and [[Katy Chen|Katy]] to the Sanctum Sanctorum, where both Captain Marvel and [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] are, via hologram, and the group discuss the nature of [[Xu Wenwu|Wenwu]]'s Rings. Bruce questions whether it could originate from the [[Chitauri]], but Carol is unfamiliar with it. She asks how long Shang-Chi's father possessed them, before he obtained them, and he reveals it was for roughly a thousand years. Bruce discloses that the rings are much older, and a holographic beating light is shown, symbolizing the Rings, acting as a beacon transmitting a message, though they remain oblivious to where. Carol is suddenly called away, and apologizes, for having to abruptly leave. She tells Kate and Shang-Chi, they can contact her, via Bruce, but once she leaves, he states he doesn't have her number, and she frequently does that.

====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x01 - Generation Why - Captain Marvel Explosion.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Whilst Captain Marvel doesn't appear in the [[Generation Why|first episode]], an animated version of her can be seen, amongst the other heroes, as [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] narrates the final chapter, in her 10-part series, about the battle against [[Thanos]]. She describes how Captain Marvel blasted through Thanos's fleet and punched him in the face, and while they don't know where she is, having left Earth, she hopes to find something out, during AvengerCon. Kamala also sports a shirt with Captain Marvel and Valkyrie in the episode and her bedroom is decorated with images of the heroine. For AvengerCon, Kamala takes part in a Captain Marvel cosplay competition, and has a costume prepared, airbrushed to match Captain Marvel's colors. At the event, there are various pieces of memorabilia in reference to her, including a large statue, which Kamala admires.

An illustration of Captain Marvel can seen in the opening title of the [[Destined|third episode]]. When Kamala learns of the huge risk involved in helping the Clandestine return to the [[Noor Dimension]], she states that Carol Danvers wouldn't wait, and she'd punch a hole in space and time and to help them now.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x06 - No Normal - Carol in Kamala's Room.jpg|thumb|250px]]
She is mentioned in the [[No Normal|final episode]], when [[Yusuf Khan|Yusuf]] tells Kamala that her name is derived from the word "Kamal", which means Marvel in Urdu, and Kamala is excited at the prospect of sharing the same name with Carol Danvers. She physically appears in the mid-credits scene of the episode. When Kamala's [[bangle]] begins to glow, Carol is mysteriously transported into Kamala's bedroom through unknown means, swapping places with Kamala. She breaks through Kamala's wardrobe door, and recovers, to the shock of finding herself in a room filled with memorabilia of herself. She panics and makes an exit.

===Marvel Animated Universe===
====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====
[[File:Tumblr mw8nxzPXhf1rl14rno6 1280.png|thumb|left|250px|Carol Danvers as Ms. Marvel as she appears in ''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''.]]
Carol Danvers appears as a member of the United States Air Force's 102nd Squadron under the call sign "Warbird". In the present day, she works alongside Dr. Philip Lawson in a special satellite base in Colorado. After an attack by a 459 Sentry, Lawson revealed himself to be a Kree warrior/scientist known as Mar-Vell. During the battle, an explosion caught both Marvel and Danvers in the middle, causing Danvers to be exposed by the cosmic energy flowing around Mar-Vell. Carol was transferred to a hospital for recovery, where she discovered she had gained powers from her exposure. She was later tasked as second-in-command to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Extra-Terrestrial Division known as S.W.O.R.D.

Later, Danvers returned to S.W.O.R.D. as second-in-command at Damocles Base. As the Kree landed their ship and got on the ground, Carol questioned Captain Marvel's motives behind allowing the Kree to invade her planet, as she had thought all the time he was in space he was fighting for the rights of the planet. She was quickly brushed aside by a few Kree soldiers. When the Kree attacked, she teamed up with Iron Man, "Captain America", and The Hulk against Ronan and the now-enemy known as Mar-Vell. After the battle, both were imprisoned in Area 42 and Iron Man offered Ms. Marvel a spot on The Avengers as a reserve member, which she excitedly accepted.

Later, [[Ultron]], a previous foe of the Avengers, returns with a new AI: Vision. The robot attacked a few Avengers in Wakanda and faced Carol when he abducted Wasp. While saving Wasp, she encountered a few robotic versions of the Avengers, including a robotic version of herself. This leads to confrontation between her and her robotic counterpart, resulting in her as the winner. After Vision saved Wasp and defeated Ultron, she welcomed Vision to join the Avengers, after repairs.

During the Galactus invasion, Ms. Marvel participated with Iron Man's team to infiltrate the flagship. Her link with S.W.O.R.D. was useful in the coordination of forces. When hope seemed lost, she returned to New York to fight Galactus on the ground until the team was successful.

====''[[Avengers Assemble|Avengers Assemble: Ultron Revolution]]''====
[[File:Captain Marvel AUR 005.png|thumb|250px|Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel as she appears in ''Avengers Assemble''.]]
She is first seen in the episode "Avengers World" on a holographic globe as one of the heroes [[Iron Man]] and Captain America consider potential Avengers. Later, in the episode "Captain Marvel", she teams up with [[Captain America]], [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], and [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] to battle a group of [[Kree]] soldiers led by Galen-Kor who are planning to give the recently-emerged Inhumans to the Kree Empire and even plan to give them Captain Marvel as a bonus. Throughout the episode, she and Captain America display a friendly rivalry, calling each other "Army" and "Air Force" respectively. However, they eventually put aside their differences and defeat the Kree. Captain Marvel then thanks the Avengers for their help and has grown closer to them, to the point where they even made her a reserve member.

In the multi-part season three finale, the Avengers disassembled and cut their ties to the United States government after learning that the government intended to register Inhumans. The team's government liaison, [[Truman Marsh]], recruits a new group of heroes to form the government-sanctioned Mighty Avengers, including Carol, [[Black Panther]], the [[Vision]], [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[Ms. Marvel]], and [[Songbird]]. Carol was glad to find a protege in the young Ms. Marvel, who had named herself after Carol. Marsh sent them to stop Baron von Strucker. They did so, but not without help from the [[Black Widow]] and Iron Man. Carol criticized the original team, calling them "vigilantes" and "renegades". Later, Marsh sent them to intercept three runaway Inhumans. They were met by the Avengers, who had come to warn the runaways of the raid. Carol tried to reason with Captain America, but she and his team stood firm. Neither side would give in, and a brawl broke out between the two Avengers teams. Captain Marvel went toe to toe with Captain America. The battle ended in favor of Carol's side. While Black Widow managed to escape, the rest of the renegade Avengers were taken into custody.

Soon after, it became apparent that the Inhuman registry had never been intended to protect people; in fact, any registered Inhuman became a target of mind control. Marsh attempted to force Ms. Marvel to register, despite the fact she had already vowed her loyalty to him and the United States government. Horrified, the older heroes on the Mighty Avengers decided this was the last straw. While the girl went into hiding, her teammates quit working for Marsh and sought out the other Avengers team, now also joined by [[Medusa Amaquelin|Medusa]] and [[Black Bolt]]. Unfortunately, by the time Captain Marvel found the girl, it was too late and Ms. Marvel had already succumbed to mind control. Carol tried to break Marsh's hold on Ms. Marvel, reminding the girl of how much she admired Captain Marvel but had no success. Ms. Marvel was eventually freed when Vision removed the registration device. Carol and all the other Avengers returned to Avengers Tower, only to find Marsh there waiting. She gasped when she sees Marsh morph into [[Ultron]]. The real Truman Marsh was long dead and Ultron had been manipulating everyone all along and declared he was finally ready to take over the world with his army of sentries and mind-controlled Inhumans.

The Mighty Avengers and the Avengers worked together against Ultron and his army, but the sentries regenerated as fast as they were getting destroyed. Iron Man developed a plan and took Falcon, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Black Panther, the Hulk, and Captain Marvel to [[Howard Stark|his father]]'s lab. Carol worked with the Panther and the Hulk to protect the lab from the Inhumans Karnak, Gorgon, and Inferno, while Ant-Man, Falcon, and Iron Man successfully broke Ultron's control over the Inhumans. However, while Ultron had the heroes distracted, he stole a new body for himself from [[Wakanda]]'s armory and traveled to the source. All the Avengers pursued, and the villain was seemingly defeated. Unfortunately, Ultron managed to transfer himself into a new body at the last second: Iron Man's. Carol and her teammates were horrified to realize that Ultron had successfully hacked Iron Man's very mind. [[Doctor Strange]] managed to work a spell to keep Tony Stark alive and stop Ultron, but it kept him trapped halfway between the Dark Dimension and the natural world. The Avengers vowed to honor their friend's sacrifice and find a way to bring him back. In the meantime, Carol formally accepted the offer to join the Avengers, her first order of business was to restore peace in New York City.

==Trivia==
*Originally, the character was labeled as '''Ms. Marvel''' in the comics and other media, partially due to the fact that {{WikipediaLink|DC Comics}} has [[w:c:warner-bros-characters:Captain Marvel|a character of the same name]] (later renamed "Shazam" for DC Comics media) and partially due to the fact that she originally worked alongside a man who previously held the codename Captain Marvel, whose real name was [[Mar-Vell]]. In [[2012]], Carol officially assumed the "Captain Marvel" title. In the comics, prior to becoming Captain Marvel, she also previously went by the codenames '''Binary''' and '''Warbird'''. Currently, the character [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]] uses the codename ''Ms. Marvel'' in the comics and other media. The DC Captain Marvel had a movie released in 2019, ''Shazam'', set in the DC Extended Universe. Due to Marvel owning the rights to the Captain Marvel name, Captain Marvel in ''Shazam'' is never called as such or given any superhero name (the closest being when [https://warner-bros-characters.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Marvel_Jr. Freddy Freeman] calls him "Captain Sparklefingers").
*In ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'', a poster of Captain Marvel can be seen, in Kamala Khan's bedroom. This image comes directly from the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]], ''Captain Marvel'' (2016) — Issue #4.
*While Carol was originally perceived as the strongest MCU character and Avenger, it was confirmed by [[Kevin Feige]] that [[Scarlet Witch]] is the strongest character in the MCU and that she almost defeated Thanos by herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-strongest-mcu-hero-kevin-feige/|title=Scarlet Witch Is Strongest MCU Hero, Says Kevin Feige|website=Screenrant|date=[[December 30]], [[2019]]}}</ref>
*A Captain Marvel comic is seen in the trailer for the [[2022]] [[Elvis Presley]] film.
