'''Grey Gargoyle''' is a supervillain from [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel Comics]] who can turn people into stone.

Grey Gargoyle was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Appearances==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
Grey Gargoyle first appears as a prisoner in the Big House, warning [[Whirlwind]] about not try to escape.

He's among the inmates who escape when the Big House malfunctions and uses his powers to turn a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent into stone.

Grey Gargoyle would later re-appear as a member of the Masters of Evil. He turns Karnilla into stone to help [[Enchantress (Marvel)|Enchantress]] and [[Skurge|Executioner]] to steal the Norn Stones. When he asks for his reward, Executioner approaches him, axe in hand. He is apparently killed.
