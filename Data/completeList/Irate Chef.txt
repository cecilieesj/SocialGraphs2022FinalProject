==Bio==
He used to work at a jungle restaurant named [[Mudka's Meat Hut]]. He is first seen in the kitchen with [[Kuzco]], trying to focus on his cooking while growing greatly irritated with the latter's open complaints about the food and preference for something "edible on the menu". [[Kronk]] later enters the kitchen and asks the now-angered chef about his "policy on making special orders". At this instant, the chef finally reaches his breaking point and he quits his job in a rage, feeling completely offended and criticized on his cooking and deciding that there was "no respect for anyone with vision." He then gathers his supplies and storms away, leaving Kronk to cook the meals himself, temporarily. This doesn't help either, as Kuzco and Yzma wouldn't make up their minds about their orders, so the first chef ended up quitting in perfect timing. Eventually, Kronk rejoins Yzma in their hunt, and it is unknown what became of the restaurant afterwards (for the remainder of the film).
