== Background ==
Demurra is a princess who was central to the ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' episode "[[The Hero]]". She was "kidnapped" by [[King Draykor]], and her supposed lover [[Sir Brad Starlight]] set out to save her with the help of [[Wander]] and [[Sylvia]]. But it turned out that she and Draykor were in love and were planning to get married, and Brad was a former flame from their teen years. Despite having the appearance of a stereotypical fairytale princess, her personality is radically different, for she is a realist, as she explained to Brad one can't expect life to be like a fairytale and how real romance takes a lot of work and communication. She is also a very capable person, since she saved herself from the much larger Brad after he attempted to kidnap her from Draykor.
