He is a [[Centaurs|Centaur]] and the general of [[Aslan]]'s Army against the evil [[Jadis the White Witch|White Witch]] during the Long Winter.

==Role in the film==
Oreius was a loyal servant of Aslan, going to his side even before the promised human monarchs arrived. Likely he was one of the Narnians who recruited his countrymen for service in Aslan's army. He, Aslan, and the rest of the Narnians gathered together at Aslan's Camp in 1000 NY, where he was made Aslan's general. He was present at the first arrival of [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] at Aslan's Camp. Shortly after their arrival, he rushed to the aid of the future queens when they were attacked by two wolves. The sisters were, however saved by their brother, and Oreius and his soldiers were commanded to follow the fleeing wolf Vardan to the White Witch's camp. They did so, quickly storming the encampment and rescuing [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]]. They quickly returned him to safety at Aslan's Camp.

The next day, Oreius was wakened early to be told that Aslan had gone away in the night and been killed by the Witch at the Stone Table. He was present when Peter confirmed Aslan's disappearance. Despite the death of his king, he affirmed his loyalty by asking the prince for orders. Later that day, the entire Narnian army marched to the Battle of Beruna, with Oreius and Peter leading them. Oreius fought beside the prince during the initial attack. When the army retreated, Oreius was ahead of the prince as the army rushed into the gorge they had chosen as their secondary battlefront. When Oreius was made aware that Peter had been thrown off from his unicorn and wounded, and faced a serious threat from Queen Jadis herself.

Oreius rushed back along with a rhinoceros to save him, much to Peter's warning that she might petrify the two of them; the rhino started ramming several enemies, but tiny creatures known as Ankle Slicers torn down the rhino. Oreius then leaps out and kills an ogre preparing to strike him. Suddenly, as he fought to reach his ruler's side, [[General Otmin]] of the White Witch's Army attempted to stop him and engaged in a duel with him. As Otmin is preparing to kill Oreius, the Centaur General manages to dislodge the Minotaur General by placing a sword on his back, killing him. When Oreius is planning to reach the Queen, he attempted to kill her while avoiding the polar bears, and was suddenly turned to stone.

Shortly afterwards, Oreius was revived by Aslan. He was present at the coronation of the Kings and Queens, and presumably served them afterwards as well. At some point, he married and had descendants.
