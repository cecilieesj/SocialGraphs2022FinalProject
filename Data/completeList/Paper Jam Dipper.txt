'''Paper Jam Dipper''' was supposed to be Clone #4 of the [[Dipper Clones]], but the paper he is printed on gets jammed, causing him to turn out looking nothing like the other clones. He is also unable to speak properly. At the end of "[[Double Dipper]]", he and the other clones disintegrate due to the fact that water is their weakness.

==Background==
===Personality===
Paper Jam Dipper tends to be too friendly with other clones and makes a lot of noise. No one can understand what he says, and one can only guess by the way he says it. He seems to be good friends to [[Tyrone]].

When he, along with the other clones, were exposed to water and began disintegrating, he admits it would be best for him, showing he was aware he wouldn't have a chance to make any effort in life.

===Physical Appearance===
Paper Jam Dipper is a deformed clone. He has rounded teeth, wrinkled skin, a large stomach, and is taller than the other clones. The color on Paper Jam Dipper is a little faded and dark (separate).
==Role in the series==
Paper Jam Dipper was created by accident in an attempt to clone the fourth [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] for a plan to steal [[Robbie (Gravity Falls)|Robbie]]'s bike, distracting him and giving Dipper a chance to ask [[Wendy (Gravity Falls)|Wendy]] to dance. He is excluded from all plans, and is disintegrated with clones 5-10 when the original Dipper sets off the emergency sprinklers.

==Trivia==
*A cracker can't fit into his mouth if it's being held vertical.
*His speech is garbled and can only be understood through the caption.
**Also, when he disintegrates, the caption shows he refers to himself in third-person.
*He seems to say "Nang", like the [[Klimpaloon]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.
