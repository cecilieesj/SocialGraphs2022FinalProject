== History ==

=== Background ===
These animals are a group of Eastern gorillas which inhabited the jungles of the Congo in the 1930s.  They were known for their frequent plundering of [[Jungle Navigation Company]] outposts.

=== Development History ===
The gorilla raiders were designed by [[Marc Davis]] for the Jungle Cruise though have been subject to many changes over the years.  When the Jungle Cruise first opened in [[Disneyland]], the gorillas were not engaging in a camp raid but rather were watching guests from the shrubbery.  In [[1977]]/[[1978]], the Jungle Cruise was refurbished to install the new comedic scene.  At-least one of the removed gorilla audio-animatronics would be repurposed into the [[Yeti]] for [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]].  A tableau which would be altered showed a gorilla fighting with a crocodile half-submerged in the river.  Due to issues with the crocodile audio-animatronic, this would be changed to the gorilla trying to grab a floating crate of bananas just out of reach.

== Appearances ==

=== [[Adventure Trading Company]] ===
The gorillas are referred to in the Daily Gnus newspaper and journalist Thompson J. Gazelle as performing an adaptation of Hamlet as the ''Adventureland Gorilla Theatre Company''.

=== The Jungle Cruise ===
The gorillas are encountered in raided camp scene of this attraction showing a JNC outpost taken over by the apes.  One gorilla tries on a pith-helmet in a mirror, another plays with its baby, one observed photographs and one by the river unknowingly shoots at guests with a revolver.

In the queue for the [[Magic Kingdom]] version of the ride, they are mentioned by [[Albert Awol]] in his radio-announcements.  At one point he mentions the gorillas having, "Borrowed" their projector (again) causing JNC staff to not be able to attend their, "[[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and Me" movie-night.  Albert also has a trivia question about, "How many gorillas does it take to destroy a base-camp? AnÂ average of 8 minutes for a family of gorillas to destroy a typical base camp".  He also can be heard trying to contact the owner of the jeep turned over by the gorillas in their sacking.

==== [[Jingle Cruise]] ====
During the seasonal Jingle Cruise overlay, the gorillas are seen ripping open a variety of Christmas presents.  The radio-announcements of the queue mention how this base was being used for storing the Christmas presents intended for the JNC's skippers.

=== [[Skipper Canteen]] ===
There is a book by Thompson J. Gazelle in this restaurant titled, "Gorilla Theatre".

== Other Appearances ==

=== [[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]] ===
These gorillas are the antagonists in the camp mini-games of this video-game's Jungle Cruise levels.  Here, the camp raided by the gorillas was collecting precious artifacts which the player must recover.  The player must play monkey-see-monkey-do with the gorillas to trick them into removing the precious relics which they pillaged from the camp.

== Trivia ==

* In [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]'s version of the ride, the song ''[[Trashin' the Camp]]'' from [[Tarzan (film)|Tarzan]] is played from a vintage radio.  This is done to allude to a scene from Tarzan where a group of gorillas raid a British explorer's camp.
*The gorilla holding a rifle to its face in curiosity is referenced in the film Tarzan when one of the gorillas steal's [[Clayton]]'s rifle and examines it in a similar fashion.
*A common skipper joke refers to the gorillas as the in-laws to skippers.
