{{Quote|We don't live in a world that's fair. We live in this one. And I'm doing everything I can to make it a better place.|Matt Murdock|Nelson v. Murdock}}
'''Daredevil''' (real name '''Matt Murdock''') is a fictional superhero from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the protagonist of the [[2015]] [[Marvel Television|Marvel]]/[[Netflix]] television series ''[[Daredevil (Netflix Show)|Daredevil]]'', and its [[2024]] [[Disney+]] revival ''[[Daredevil: Born Again]]''. He also appears in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' as Peter Parker's lawyer, and returns in ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'', ''[[Echo (TV series)|Echo]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man: Freshman Year]]''. He is played by [[Charlie Cox]].

In his civilian life, Matt is a morally-driven brilliant lawyer with his partner and best friend [[Foggy Nelson]] and his secretary/love interest [[Karen Page]], and combats criminals and injustice both legally and vigilantly, making enemies out of those such as crime boss [[Kingpin|Wilson Fisk]], aka the Kingpin, and the evil ninja clan [[The Hand]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Daredevil was briefly the leader of the [[Defenders (team)|Defenders]], a temporary team of fellow vigilantes consisting of [[Jessica Jones]], [[Power Man]], and [[Iron Fist]].

Daredevil was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Bill Everett.

==Background==
Matt Murdock began as the normal son of champion boxer "Battlin'" Jack Murdock, until he lost his sight in an accident while saving an old man from being ran over by a cargo truck hauling toxic waste. However, in losing his sight, the chemical waste also amplified his other senses, granting him superhuman sensory, allowing him to hear things miles away, see through feeling vibrations, and smell something particularly potent in order to anticipate danger. Following the murder of his father, he was taken in by the cold, elderly ninja master [[Stick]], and trained in martial arts, in addition to overcoming his trauma and fear, he uses both to become the costumed vigilante Daredevil, wearing a red-and-black costume evocative of a traditional devil.
===Personality===
Matt maintains an idea of justice and righteousness that he carries with him through work as a lawyer by day and a vigilante by night. While professional, Matt is not without a sense of humor and is very easygoing with his friends. Quips about his blindness don't bother him, and he even frequently jokes about it himself. Despite this, when under stress, Matt pushes the people around him away, attempting to take all responsibility upon himself to fix Hell's Kitchen. Although he tries to be a pillar of strength and support for the people around him, Matt can only take so much pressure before he breaks down.

As Daredevil, Matt is cruel and ruthless towards criminals. Although he refuses to kill, Matt is not afraid to break bones or torture his targets to get what he is after, even if his targets are not criminals themselves. Due to his extremely violent nature as a vigilante, Matt realizes that he has the potential to become the very thing he hates and takes care to never cross that line.
