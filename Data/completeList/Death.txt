'''Death''', also known as the '''Countess''', is the main antagonist of the book'' [[Beauty and the Beast: Lost in a Book]]''. She is the living personification of death and the sister of [[Love (Beauty and the Beast)|Love]], with whom she is constantly waging bets.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Death takes the form of a woman, human-like in appearance with pale, porcelain skin, blood red lips and long dark hair. Like her sister, she has green eyes. In all her forms and guises, whether it be Death or the Countess, she always dresses in black clothing with black jewelry. Her perfume is myrrh, a scent used to anoint the dead. When angered, her nails curve to resemble talons.

===Powers and abilities===
Death is a very powerful being and a force to be reckoned with. She is immortal and will exist as long as things die, rot and decay. Time is meaningless to her as she remains in a state of eternal youth.

Death possesses vast magical powers. She created the enchanted book, Nevermore which acted as a gateway from the Beast's castle to her domain. Death is a master of illusion. She can enchant a painted backdrop and a dying, withered land to become a beautiful estate, turn ruined shacks into a chateau and a summer house, vultures into human servants, make strings invisible and even change a piece of land into a vast illusion of Paris. Her illusions have substance and can distort one's sense of taste, time and touch. However, the illusions have their limits. The glamoured puppets still felt as cold as a bloodless body and needed their strings to move while the lions remained as heavy as a stone statue.

Death can bring life to objects, specifically artificial representatives of life like stone lions and hounds, automatons, puppets, and marionettes. Depending on the amount of magic she used on these objects, some will gain their own personalities and the ability to act independently. Most, like the hounds and people, were created only to serve the Countess and act as backgrounders in the illusion but Henri and Otto were given more in order to act as real people. Otto even gained a heart, mind and a will of his own.

Despite all her power, Death cannot take someone before their time nor can she kill someone. However, if someone were to enter her domain, that would be a different story.
