She is a brilliant scientist and a gifted medic who helps [[Luke Cage|Luke]] in his battle against crime with her impressive knowledge of chemistry, biology and medicine. She is the daughter of [[Black Mariah]], one of Luke's most notorious enemies, but she refuses to go the same dark path as her mother, and she wishes for nothing more than to see the streets of Harlem free of crime.

Tilda Johnson was created by Steve Englehart and Alan Weiss.

==Trivia==
*In the ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'' episode "[[For Pete's Sake (Luke Cage)|For Pete's Sake]]", Tilda refers to [[magic]] as science they don't understand. This phrase was also used by [[Jane Foster]] in ''Thor'' and Dale [[The Broken Circle|in]] ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''.
