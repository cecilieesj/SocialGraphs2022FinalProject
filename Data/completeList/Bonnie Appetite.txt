She appeared on the two smaller stages that flanked the main one, singing and introducing all of the show's acts. She appeared in three outfits during the show, Betty Crocker-like duds, a formal showgirl-style tuxedo, and a Carmen Miranda-style outfit.

==Role in the show==
===Introduction===
Bonnie Appetite appeared first, solo singing "[[Meal Time Blues]]" to the audience. This was where she wore a housewife-style dress, has her hair in a bun, and was surrounded by cookbooks. She looked quite sad while performing this number, to associate with the theme of the song. The lights turned off, and the next performance came.

===Act 1===
She then sang, along with the [[Kitchen Krackpots]], "[[Chase Those Meal Time Blues Away]]", in her showgirl attire. There was a ragtime introduction from the Krackpots, and then Bonnie said, to the audience, "Thank you all for coming to my kitchen". The Krackpots then reappeared, out of the floor, in the ending.

===Act 5===
Bonnie Appetite reappeared in act five, in the "[[Veggie, Veggie, Fruit, Fruit]]" performance. Bonnie Appetite, now in a Carmen Miranda-style carnival outfit, and perched upon a crescent moon that descended from the ceiling, sang her parts of the song.

===Finale===
Bonnie Appetite and the other cast members sang "[[Kabaret Finale]]", which was a medley of the previous songs. All of the cast came back out and Bonnie said good bye before the curtains with the Kraft logo covered the stage.
