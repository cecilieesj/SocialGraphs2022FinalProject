'''Mother Olm''' is a character of the 2019 series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

== Background ==
Mother Olm is the oldest and wisest olm in [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] and resides in the underground city Proteus.

Two olm guards escort [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]], and the Plantars to Mother Olm’s inner sanctum. When the rebels reach their destination, [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] eagerly starts hitting a gong and Mother Olm reveals herself and she is enormous even compared to her fellow olms.

When they tell her about [[King Andrias]] and the destruction he is causing on the surface, Anne brings up the [[Calamity Box]] which Mother Olm remembers something important, but because of her advanced age she can’t remember what. In order to help her to fully remember the gang has to enter Mother Olm’s head though her ear (Which Sasha is reluctant about because she finds it disgusting) and apply a Dr. Yohan’s special brain cream directly to her brain. Hop Pop chooses to stay behind due to his insecurities about his age. While waiting Mother Olm assures that Hop Pop he still has value.

After they reach the brain (and finding the corpse of Dr. Yohan) the gang applies the cream. Just as they are about to leave, a colony of Batsquitos living in the olm’s head attack, the gang leads the Batsquitos out of the brain but fall into the nose. As the Batsquitos fly out of Mother Olm’s ear Hop Pop learn that the kids are in trouble. Using his horticultural knowledge, Hop Pop finds and combines various plants to make Mother Olm sneeze the kids out saving them. With that, Hop Pop’s confidence is restored and is now comfortable with being old.

After realizing the cream expired and was useless Hop Pop realizing that before he forgets something he writes it down causing Mother Olm to remember that the prophecy they were looking for was on the ceiling the whole time; "Three stars burning bright, come from beyond to expel the night. Whether they fight or embrace the fall, their choice shall determine all". When Anne mentions that Andrias stole the music box Mother Olm informs the gang that Sasha and [[Marcy Wu|Marcy]] should have powers similar to Anne but were taken away because Andrias is misusing the powers of the gems in the music box, then she explains that in order to regain the power that is rightfully theirs they must get the music box back from Andrias. When Anne asks what the prophecy is for Mother Olm tells everyone that they were meant for a greater purpose but those who wanted to use the power of the gems for conquest and with their arrogance and greed created an "[[The Core|unnatural thing]] that does not sleep and will not die" and the human girls are destined to save all amphibians from the "worst version of themselves". Anne thanks Mother Olm for all her help while Sasha asks for a shower but is horrified when Mother Olm gargles a huge cup of tea and spews it all over the gang.

Weeks later, Mother Olm reports to Anne, Sasha, the Planters, Grime, and the resistance that King Andrias was lying about planning to invade the Earth in a few days and that Andrias plans invade Earth tonight.

Following the thwarting of Andrias' invasion, Mother Olm surfaced as the Core was driving the moon towards Amphibia. Mother Olm told Anne, Sasha and Marcy that to stop the Core, they would have to tap into the power of the three gems but doing so might exhaust their power, preventing them from returning to Earth. She then privately spoke with Anne, telling her that if the worst were to come to pass, she would need to use a "secret spell" to unite the power of the gems into herself but doing so would kill her.

Following the Core's destruction, Mother Olm was among those mourning Anne's sacrifice before witnessing her being resurrected by the Cosmic Guardian, looking happy to see that Anne was alive.
