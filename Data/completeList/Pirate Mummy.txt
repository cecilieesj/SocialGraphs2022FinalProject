The Pirate Mummy first appeared in the episode "[[Treasure of the Pirate Mummy's Tomb]]".Â [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and crew accompanied by [[Captain Flynn]] venture into the Pirate Mummy's Tomb in the search of the golden ankh which has the power to free Flynn's ship The Barracuda from the sands of the Never Land Desert unknown that [[Captain Hook]] overhears the pirates and decides to claim the ankh for himself he comes up with a scheme disguising himself and [[Mr. Smee]] as mummies to scare Flynn and the others away. While Hook sets his sneaky plan into motion, the Pirate Mummy overhears them entering the tomb. Later, the pirates enter the chamber of the ankh, and Hook and Smee were revealed as the mummies that chased the heroes earlier. Captain Hook grows so impatient with the ankh nowhere in sight that he begins throwing various levers, sealing everyone within the chamber, and revealing the real Pirate Mummy, much to the fright of the other pirates. Much to their surprise, the Mummy was more afraid of them and was no threat to the pirates. Jake asks if they could borrow the ankh to assist Captain Flynn, but Captain Hook demands the ankh for himself and tried pulling another lever, believing it would grant him the treasure, but instead forces sand to fill the chamber. Thinking, Jake asks for the ankh, which the Pirate Mummy reveals, and informs him how to use the power of the ankh to rescue everyone from the sand. But even after the ordeal, greedy Captain Hook was still determined to have the golden ankh, much to the annoyance of the Pirate Mummy, who pulls another pirate booby-trap, sending Hook and Mr. Smee flying out of the Pirate Mummy's tomb.

The Pirate Mummy is last seen lending Jake and his crew the golden ankh's power to free Captain Flynn's ship and allows the young pirates to visit his tomb anytime they like.
