'''Amanda Binder''' is [[Cliff Binder|Cliff]]'s wife and [[Kenny Binder|Kenny]]'s mother in ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]''.

==Role in the film==
Like Cliff, Amanda does not like [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]] because of his imagination about [[Trantor]] and other trolls. She tells Kenny to remain at home for safety on Halloween, but he disobeys her when he tries to rescue Briarville's citizens from Trantor's terror. He eventually becomes one of Trantor's wooden dolls after the other trolls disappeared whenever Ernest, [[Mike Murdock]] and the children squirted or poured milk at them. After Ernest defeats Trantor, Amanda, along with Cliff, reunites with Kenny who is a normal person once again.
