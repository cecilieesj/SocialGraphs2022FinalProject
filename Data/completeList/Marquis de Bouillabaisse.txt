The '''Marquis de Bouillabaisse''' is a minor antagonist in ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. He appears in the episode "[[May the Best Princess Win]]".

==History==
An evil, diminutive pirate, he loves his piranha pets, one of which will eat anything. His dream is to take over [[King Jean-Claude|Jean-Claude]]'s kingdom, and the world.

When [[Princess Marie|Marie]] and [[Princess Calla|Calla]] ride out to see who is the best, the two end up in a river and are captured by the Marquis and his thugs. Believing this is the best way to make Jean-Claude surrender, he grabs the princesses' handkerchiefs and shows them to their fathers. He tells Jean-Claude and [[King Gregor|Gregor]] to surrender by nightfall if the kings want to see their children again. The Marquis tells his hostages that he will feed them to his ravenous piranhas if the Kings fail to submit.

Meanwhile, as [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]], [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]], and [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]] are making their way back home, they come across the Marquis' encampment. Sunni spies the horses that Marie and Calla were riding, and deduces that the two are in trouble. When the Marquis returns, Calla comes up with a way to turn the tables on him.
