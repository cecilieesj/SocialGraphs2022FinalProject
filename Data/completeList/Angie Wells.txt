{{Quote|This is Scout Commander 15-09. I proudly report my mission is complete. For centuries we've been without a home, but I found Utopia, the perfect new planet for our people.

'''Angie''', also known as '''The  Alien Scout''' and '''Grandma Angie''', was an alien who made her debut in Disney's ''[[Zombies 3|ZOMBIES 3]]''. She was the scout of the aliens, until she crashed on Seabrook, on Planet Earth. She was [[Addison Wells]]' maternal grandmother.

She decided to keep their alien ancestry a secret in order to keep her family safe, before ''Zombies 3'' only Eli and Missy knew the truth, but they kept to themselves, until Missy revealed it to Addison.

She used to wear blue and silver alien clothes.

== Biography ==

=== Early Life ===
Angie was born on the aliens' home planet until it was destroyed. At some point, she became The Alien Scout.

=== Finding a New Home ===
One day, Angie's scout ship ran out of fuel, ending up crashed on Seabrook, Earth. A male young human named Eli helped her, nursed her to health and gave her shelter.

=== Starting a New Life ===
With no chance of returning to the Mothership, Angie was forced to hide her alien identity under a blonde wig and, due to being away from her alien people, her blue hair grew white and she lost her stardust powers. At some point, Angie joined Eli at Seabrook High, where she fell in love with cheerleading. She became part of the cheer squad and created the Seabrook Cup.

=== Forming a Family ===
When they grow up, Angie and Eli fell in love and got married. They had a daughter whom they named Amachenta Wells, but nicknamed her "Missy". When Missy grew up, she formed a family of her own as well, marrying Dale and having a daughter named Addison Wells. Angie and Addison were very close, sharing a love for cheerleading, and loved each other very deeply. At some point, Angie considered Addison "her most precious thing", so she used her (Addison's) DNA as coordinates of the perfect utopia for the aliens to find. She then passed away due to her old  age.
