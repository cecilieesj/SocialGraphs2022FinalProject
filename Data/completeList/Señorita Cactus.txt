At one point, she was going to be the third member of the ''[[Woody's Roundup]]'' gang but was eventually replaced with [[Jessie]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 2]]''===
In the early version of the film just like [[Stinky Pete]], Señorita Cactus did not like children and wished to be kept on display rather than being played with. In the original climax of the film, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] and the other toys would've hijacked [[Al McWhiggin|Al's]] car while he was preparing to leave for the airport and tried to get [[Woody]] out of the trunk. Señorita Cactus and [[Stinky Pete]] would've tried to stop them, only for them to fall out onto the street and get picked up by two kids on bikes.

Despite being deleted from the final film, numerous "Señorita Cactus" boxes can be seen within [[Al's Toy Barn]].

=== ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''===
A Señorita Cactus box can be seen in the background during the part where Woody, Buzz, Rex, and Trixie arrive at Mason's house and follow a [[Dimetrodon|Dino-Hound]] toy to the Battlesaurs area.

===''[[Toy Story 4]]''===
Señorita Cactus made a cameo appearance in ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' when Woody and [[Bo Peep]] enter the ''Tiki Frenzy'' pinball machine in search of [[Duke Caboom]]. This makes it the first time the character appears in a physical manner in a Pixar film.

==Trivia==
* "Señorita" means "Miss" in Spanish. This means her name in English is "Miss Cactus".
