'''The Koozebanian Phoob''' is a blue alien creature from the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Planet_Koozebane planet Koozebane] who is interviewed by [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_205:_Judy_Collins episode 205] of ''The Muppet Show''. It was performed by [[Jerry Nelson]].

The Phoob is a very unfortunate creature, because it is known as the most delicious creature on Koozebane. Luckily, the Phoob has hit upon a survival strategyâ€”it evolves very quickly into whatever is nearby. The sketch ends with the Phoob "evolving" into a clone of Kermit, causing the two Kermits to fight over which is the real one.

While episode 205 is the Phoob's introduction, he could be seen in the audience during [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Talk_Spots Talk Spot] in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_119:_Vincent_Price episode 119] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie's_Comedy_Acts Fozzie's Monologue] in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_122:_Ethel_Merman episode 122]. In [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_208:_Steve_Martin episode 208] he appeared in the audience. The Phoob also makes an appearnce in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/At_the_Dance At the Dance] skecth of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_311:_Raquel_Welch episode 311].

The blue version of the Phoob can be seen in one of the windows at the port in ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''. This version also appears in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_Go_to_the_Movies The Muppets Go to the Movies]'' and both versions can be seen on background monitors on ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Jim_Henson_Hour The Jim Henson Hour]''. Both versions can be spotted in the "Waste Deep" PSA for [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Better_World_Society Better World Society].

In [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/I_Love_Muppets I Love Muppets], [[Gonzo]] lists a number of creatures on the show. When he mentions the name Phoob, however, a picture of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Snerfs the Snerfs] is shown instead.

The green version of the Phoob has most recently been featured walking [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Backstage backstage] as [[Rowlf the Dog|Rowlf]] plays the piano after the "Bang, Boom, Splat and Pow" sketch in "Kermit's Story," the first in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Roger_Langridge Roger Langridge's] four-issue run of ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show_Comic_Book The Muppet Show Comic Book]''.
