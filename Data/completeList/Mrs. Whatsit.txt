Mrs. Whatsit is first seen in her crow form where she pecks the window outside at the Westover Community School, much to Mr. Porter looking at [[Meg Murry|Meg]] getting distracted upon observing the crow. When Meg is at class at the Westover Community School, she hears Mrs. Whatsit in her mind as she tells her to meet her at the haunted house.

Mrs. Whatsit appears in her crow form again pecking the window again to which she flies away again. Charles Wallace then tells Meg and her mother to meet Mrs. Whatsit, to which they don't know who she is. Later on, Whatsit transforms from her crow form to her human form just as Charles Wallace stares at her. Charles asks her to know what she was doing on a wild night, to which she tells him that wild nights are her glory, explaining that she caught the most marvelous downdraft, excited to meet people in the real world as well as smelling hot cocoa in the kitchen. Meg gives her the cocoa to which she is impressed with it, just as she is happy to meet Meg's mother. She then explains to Dana that there is one such thing in the real world as a tesseract just before she leaves and transforms back to her crow form.

Later that night when [[Calvin O'Keefe|Calvin]] comes in, Mrs. Whatsit appears on television asking Charles and Meg to find Mr. Murry immediately, as well as telling them to bring Calvin to find him. Mrs, Whatsit appears again and transports the three to Uriel, the third star as the three hold each other together to arrive at the planet. Arriving at a mysterious planet, Whatsit then encounters Who, to which she is very happy to meet her, explaining that she and Mrs. Who are young as Mrs. Who likes to quote others. Meg asks her to know where she is at, to which she explains that the area she and her friends are at is Uriel, the third star of the planet Malik in the spiral nebula Messier 101. She explains to Meg that it was the tesseract that brought the three to Uriel, explaining that the tesseract acts as a gateway through the galaxy, explaining to the three about the process known as a wrinkle in time to which just as she disappears, Mrs. Whatsit tells the three to pick some blue flowers behind the three. She then appears in her Pegasus-like form, explaining that she can't rename herself every time she transforms. She then asks the children to board her, just as she flies across the ocean for to the three to arrive on another spot where they see another dimension that can be a danger which could affect the universe if not stopped upon seeing the distant darkness, which would be the spot to find Meg's missing father.

That night, Mrs. Whatsit discusses with Mrs. Which and Mrs. Who about Mr. Murry trapped on the planet Camazotz, explaining that someone must save him and the others trapped before it is too late, just as the three Mrs. Ws continue discussing about Charles Wallace who be the only one who would help save Murry, alongside Calvin to which Meg overhears.

Mrs. Whatsit is later present during a conversation with Meg and the other children about Dr. Murry lost on the planet Camazotz as it is explained that many warriors, especially those on Earth, have won the battle just as she explains that this is the reason why she sent the three to Uriel as Charles alone cannot defeat evil. She sends Calvin and Charles to a nearby cave to find the Happy Medium who would help the two on their journey, followed by Meg joining in.

Upon encountering the Happy Medium, he notices the three Mrs. W's sadness of what happened while Mrs. Whatsit explains that sometimes, children can triumph over the darkness' evil forces with faith and hope. After seeing Meg's mother hoping that her husband would return via H.M.'s crystal ball, the three decide to get to Camazotz to find him. Later before transporting Meg, Charles, and Calvin to Camazotz, Mrs. Whatsit is present with Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which approaching the trio, where Mrs. Who explains to them that they will be watching them when they arrive, but they will be unable to see them as they cannot help them just before the three arrive at their destination.

Back at the Happy Medium's cave, Mrs. Whatsit, alongside Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, watch footage of Meg and her group entering the Central Central Intelligence headquarters via footage tuned in by H.M.'s crystal ball. Later when Charles is dealing with the Man with Red Eyes, H.M. fearfully reacts to what he did with Calvin, alongside Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Who.

Later at Ixchel after Mrs. Which studies Meg's human passion due to her plans to rescue Charles Wallace, she, Mrs. Which, and Mrs, Who, arrive at the area where Meg's father is being kept warm to which while discussing with Meg, her father, and Calvin about a plan to rescue Charles, Whatsit explains to Meg that she wants nothing from her that she does with without grace, explaining that only grace would help save Charles. After following the advice from her father and her friend Calvin, alongside the advice from Mrs. Which and Mrs. Who, Meg approaches Mrs. Whatsit who explains to her that she feels happiness in her mind, which the darkness does not have to which she explains that only her faith that she is to find for herself just as Meg travels back to Camazotz again via tesseract in order to help her save Charles and finish her goal in defeating the Man with Red Eyes.

After Meg returns to the real world after rescuing her missing father as well as saving Charles Wallace from the forces of It, Mrs. Whatsit suddenly appears in front of Meg's mother alongside Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which just as Charles Wallace introduces his mother to the three of them. Mrs. Whatsit praises Meg for completing her goal to which Mrs. Whatsit explains to her that her time has come for her to say goodbye to her. After Mrs. Which and Mrs. Who both leave together, Mrs, Whatsit follows alongside them leaves with the other two Mrs. Ws.
