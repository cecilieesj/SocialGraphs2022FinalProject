They are a pair of kelpies, Scottish mythical creatures that appear as horses to lure victims into the sea and drown them.

==Role in the series==
Appearing in the episode "[[The Missing Links of Moorshire!]]", Briar and Bramble introduce themselves to the McDuck family and [[Flintheart Glomgold]] when the group gets themselves trapped in an enchanted golf realm. The two offer to give the group a tour of the course, but [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] figures out their true nature. Briar and Bramble resort to other methods of persuasion and sway [[Scrooge McDuck]] and Glomgold to continue the competition by promising whoever wins the tournament the Druid's Cup. Throughout the game, Briar and Bramble observe the competitors while continuously tempting the ducks to enter the waters (and almost succeed with a gullible [[Launchpad McQuack]]) but they fail to convince the group, much to the kelpies' displeasure.

At the final obstacle, the ducks discover that the mist covering the realm has a petrifying effect. Emerging from the mist, the kelpies, who are immune to the mist, offer to save the group by carrying them on horseback but are declined once again, thus they leave the ducks to succumb to the mist. After [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] emerges as the game's victor, the group is sent back to Moorshire where the kelpies present Dewey and Scrooge a joint Druid's Cup trophy. They suggest the group enter the water to celebrate but recognize that the ducks have made it clear they have had enough of their antics, so the kelpies retreat back to the sea.

==Trivia==
*The kelpies are references to the show ''[[w:c:mlp:My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic|My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]''. In addition, their coat and voice actresses are shared with two of the show's main characters, albeit with their roles switched: 
**Briar, who is pink, shares her [[Tara Strong|voice actress]] with [[w:c:mlp:Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]], a purple pony.
**Bramble, who is purple, shares her [[Andrea Libman|voice actress]] with [[w:c:mlp:Pinkie Pie|Pinkie Pie]], a pink pony. However, her inflections are closer to that of [[w:c:mlp:Fluttershy|Fluttershy]], who has the same voice actress.
