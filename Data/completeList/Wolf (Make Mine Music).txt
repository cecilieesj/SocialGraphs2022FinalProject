==Background==
===Personality===
The wolf is an ominous creature, dangerous and deadly enough that everyone seems to fear him except, of course, [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]]. His first instinct upon seeing Peter is, of course, to attack relentlessly, and he refuses to give up his prey even when it is high in a tree out of his reach.

===Physical appearance===
The wolf is a huge predator with mangy gray fur, big yellow eyes, a vastly exaggerated maw and fangs, large paws complete with enormous claws, and a scraggly triangular build with a larger upper body than lower, his body becoming much more slender towards his waist and hindquarters.

==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
In ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', the wolf relentlessly pursues Peter and his animal friends in an attempt to eat them. [[Sonia]] eventually ends up being separated from the rest of the group, and the wolf leads her on a long chase and seemingly devours her. Determined for revenge, Peter organizes a plan to capture him with [[Sasha]] distracting him, while Peter and [[Ivan]] tie him up with a rope that the young wolf hunter had. At the end of the segment, he can be seen in the victory parade hanging on aÂ pole that [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir]] carry.

===''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]''===
{{Quote|A hungry wolf had found the flock!|[[Sterling Holloway|Narrator]]}}
In ''Lambert the Sheepish Lion'', the wolf tries to eat [[Mrs. Sheep]], [[Lambert Lion|Lambert]]'s adoptive mother. When he hears Lambert roaring at him for attempting to do so, he drops his vicious streak and becomes incredibly cowardly (to the point of running for cover) and emits [[Goofy]]'s trademark yell when he is pushed off a cliff by Lambert. The narrator also shows sympathy for him when he points out that he clung onto a berry branch during his fall and that he wouldn't starve, making him seem more pitiful than threatening.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
On the show, this wolf and the [[Big Bad Wolf]] are the same character, being the werewolf side to [[Little Red Riding Hood|Red]], ironically Peter's lover.

==Trivia==
*He bears a great resemblance to the [[Wolf (The Sword in the Stone)|wolf]] from ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.
*He is represented in the music by a [[France|French]] horn, but it is not mentioned in the short.
