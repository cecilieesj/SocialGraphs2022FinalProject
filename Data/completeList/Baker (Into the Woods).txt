The Witch appears telling the Baker to get the Cape which makes the Baker nervous. His mind is jumbled and can't remember what is he gonna collect, never knowing that his Wife followed him to the Woods. The two again argued for why the Wife needs to follow or not, they stop arguing when the Baker's Wife saw ''The Cow as White as Milk''. They talked to Jack, the owner of the cow for the price which is no less than five pounds, the Baker's Wife lied to get the Cow. They trade 5 beans for a cow. After that, the Baker ordered his wife to go home. The Baker continued his search for Little Red who has the Cape.

He left the house, when asked by the Grandma if what kind of hunter is you, he answered "I'm a Baker". Little Red's Grandmother go inside the house. When he is going to left he was stopped by [[Little Red Riding Hood (Into the Woods)|Little Red Riding Hood]] and the girl sang "I Know Things Now", thus, giving the Cape to him. The Baker kissed the Girl as a sign of thanking. The Baker sleeping was waked up by Jack and telling him the Giant "[[Giants in the Sky]]" and giving him the 5 Gold Pieces to get Milky White back. He told him that he cannot buy Milky White back, but Jack was already walking. He stumbled across his wife, telling her that they had two items left to find, the Wife protested one, the Baker now getting what his Wife means anxiously questioned where is the cow, replying to him that she lost the cow, the two again argues. The Witch interrupted their arguing and tells them to get the cow back, the Witch disappeared and the two said sorry to each other, and the Baker ordered his wife to go back to the village.

Later, the Baker begs to compare [[Florinda]], [[Lucinda (Into the Woods)|Lucinda]], and the Stepmother to the corn he is holding, but he fails.

The Baker explained to his wife the 5 Gold Pieces. They argued, they were stopped by Milky White lying to the ground, Jack announced Milky White was dead. As they were talking with his wife in the morning, they were interrupted by a shake on the ground caused by Jack chopping down the beanstalk, thus, making the Giant fall.

The Baker successfully get a new cow and his wife successfully get the slipper. The Witch arrives, she hesitates that the cow was white as milk, she touched it and it was covered by dust. She demands why is the cow isn't white as milk, they explained they had but it died. She ordered the Baker and his Wife to bring her to the cow, so she can bring it back to life. Just that Jack and his mother was there to observe how the Witch bring Milky White to life, after bringing it back, she orders to feed the cow with the hair, slipper and cape. They followed what she orders, Jack's mother helped feeding the items and Jack was milking it. When there's no milk coming from the cow, the witch cried while shouting "Wrong Ingredient". The Baker and his Wife explained they had a Cow as White as Milk where the Witch agrees, the Cape as Red as Blood where the Witch also agrees, the Slipper as Pure as Gold where the Witch certainly agrees, and the Baker told her she compared the hair to the corn, his Wife interrupted that she pulled that from a maiden on a tower, the Witch questioned what were she doing there, and told them she touched that hair, and told them she cannot touch the ingredient. The Baker and his Wife grieved but then Jack shouted that the corn's hair will help to milk the cow, the Witch agrees. They fed it to the cow, and the cow milked. The Witch drink the milk which turned her to her beautiful youth, and successfully reverse her mother's curse and the Baker and his Wife now has a baby.

When attending the Prince and Cinderella's wedding, they thanked Cinderella for giving the slipper, while Cinderella looking to them confused. While they continue to celebrate, the ground shake again. The Prince told them to go to their villages and he will investigate the problem. Back to the woods, they realize this isn't the woods that they explored before and that there were no path. They encountered Little Red sitting on a tree, tired of finding her grandmother because she's moving in with her after her mother was missing and her house was fallen. They promised to help her finding granny. The group stumbled upon the Royal Family claiming that a giant teared the castle apart. [[The Giant (Into the Woods)]] then appeared demanding the lad who killed his husband, the Witch then appears to tell that they will get the boy, just not move. Then, Jack's mother arrives argues with the Giant making it angry. The Steward pulled Jack's mother causing it to slowly die. Before she die, she told the Baker and his Wife to promise not let the Giant touch Jack. They agreed to split their ways and let Little Red take care of the baby.
