'''Russell Remington''' is a character from the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Big City Greens]]''. He is husband of [[Rashida Remington|Rashida]] and the father of [[Remy Remington]] who is the best friend of series protagonist [[Cricket Green]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Russell is a true football coach both off and on the field. He is an extrovert in that he displays a loud and boisterous attitude and always makes metaphors and jokes relating to his profession. He also appears to be a very conceited man such as in "[[Dinner Party (Big City Greens)|Dinner Party]]" where he autographs things with ''I'm #1''. Russell does however show a well disciplined and responsible side as well and cares very deeply for his son's well being.  

===Appearance===
Russell, as well as his wife Rashida, resemble older versions of Remy. He is a tall and full looking man with short blue hair and a goatee. He is always seen in a nice blue suit complete with pink undershirt and tie and gold cuff links. He also noticeably has small stub earrings.

==Trivia==
* Russell used to play for the Big City Bengals, the local football team.
* Russell despises crabs simply because one pinched him.
