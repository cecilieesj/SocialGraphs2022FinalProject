'''Cuthbert Coot''' is [[Donald Duck]]'s cattle rancher cousin, who was introduced in [[Carl Barks]]' comic story "Webfooted Wrangler" (also known as "Donald Learns the Ropes"), first published in April [[1945]].

==Background==
In Don Rosa's Donald Duck family tree (first published in [[1993]]), he is included as a member of the Coot Kin and more specifically as son of Casey Coot and his wife Gretchen Grebe, which makes him a nephew of [[Grandma Duck]], a brother of Donald's [[Fanny Coot|Aunt Fanny]], a first cousin of [[Quackmore Duck]], a first cousin once removed of Donald Duck and an uncle of [[Gus Goose]].

==Trivia==
*In the original German translation of "Webfooted Wrangler", Cuthbert is Donald's uncle instead of his cousin.
