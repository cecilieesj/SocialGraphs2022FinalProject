'''The Spot''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]]. He was a brilliant scientist researching the Darkforce Dimension when an explosion in his lab mutated his body so that several portals to pocket dimensions are now grafted onto his body. He decided to use his new found powers as a supervillain, with his supervillain name being a reference on how the portals grafted onto his body look like black spots. When a prize was put on [[Spider-Man]]'s head, he was one of the many supervillains try to cash on the hit on Spider-Man, but thankfully Spider-Man ended up defeating him.

The Spot was created by Al Migrom and Jim Mooney.
