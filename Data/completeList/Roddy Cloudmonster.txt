==History==
Roddy's first appearance was in "[[New Monsterkid on the Block]]", when his family moved to Roarsville. [[Henry Hugglemonster (character)|Henry]] decided to invite Roddy over to play a game of Huggleball with the rest of his friends. But Roddy started causing trouble for everyone. When Henry and friends stood up to Roddy and told him how he had been acting like a bully, Roddy suddenly felt so bad about it. Henry resolved the problem by having a chat, and afterwards, Roddy played a game of Huggleball while riding on clouds he had created.
