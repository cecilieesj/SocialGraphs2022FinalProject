'''Eduardo Villanueva''' is a character who appears in the [[2007]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.

==Background==
A gruff and proud individual, Villanueva was notorious for bar fights and also responsible for the brawl that occurred during the fourth Court meeting.

As the Pirate Lord of the Adriatic Sea, Villanueva is a Spaniard who traveled to many ports of the Seven Seas. He had gray hair with black streaks over his beard, a black hat with a white feather, a necklace, and a brown leather coat with golden embroidery, over a white faded shirt.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
In a plan to consult the pirate lords of the [[Brethren Court]] at Shipwreck Cove to fight against [[Davy Jones]] working for [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], Villanueva and the rest of the pirate lords are present with [[Jack Sparrow]] and his crew attending under command by [[Hector Barbossa]] where all the pirate lords hand their pieces of eight to bind [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]] in a plan to fight Davy Jones under command of Lord Cutler Beckett. During a plan to fight against Davy Jones and free Calypso, Villanueva and the other pirate lords refuse to listen and fight each other in a brawl, believing Calypso is a threat to the Brethren Court. Barbossa, however, stops the fight, clarifying that it was the First Court who imprisoned Calypso, planning to release her. Jack Sparrow takes part in a speech devising a plan to fight against the [[East India Trading Company|EITC]]'s forces while Barbossa summons [[Captain Teague]] who later arrives to deal with the plan.

As Captain Teague arrives, he shows Jack's crew and the Brethren Court the Codex to which all the pirate lords vote for themselves and as [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] plans to fight against the EITC, Villanueva and the other pirate lords accept Elizabeth's request in a plan to fight against the EITC. Later when Elizabeth commands all the pirates to raise their flags to prepare for battle, Villanueva is present with the pirate lords who also raise their flags to prepare to fight against Davy Jones and the EITC under Elizabeth's command. After Davy Jones falls to his death during battle at the maelstrom and Lord Cutler Beckett is defeated for good, Villanueva and the other pirate lords celebrate their freedom from the EITC, alongside [[Tai Huang]] and his men and the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' in victory.

==Other Appearances==

===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===
In the opening cavern sequence of this ride, the skeletal corpses of the Brethren Court members can be seen sitting at a table, Villanueva being one of them. It is unknown how they died or what they were doing on [[Treasure Cove]], which lead to their apparent deaths.

==Trivia==
*His last name "Villanueva" translates as "new town" in Spanish.
*The flag used by Villanueva's crew is the same flag related to the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard]].
*Although Sergio Calderón calls his character "Villanueva", the credits for ''At World's End'' credit him as "Vallenueva". His first name "Eduardo" was used in the video game adaptation of ''At World's End''. In the rest of his appearances, he was called "Eduardo Villanueva" or simply "Villanueva".
