'''Scud''' is the secondary antagonist of the [[1995]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story]]''. He is is [[Sid Phillips]]' pet bull terrier.

==Personality==
Scud is an aggressive bull terrier that helps his owner, Sid Phillips, torturing toys for fun by chewing the toys and wrecking their parts. Scud is an obstacle for Woody and Buzz as they try to escape Sid's house and reunite with Andy Davis, and Scud obsessively pursues them, showing also to be very tough. He was also implied to be abused by his owners, or at least Mr. Phillips, as he walked away in fear when he noticed Mr. Phillips sleeping nearby, thus preventing him from mauling Buzz.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story]]''===
Scud was very aggressive and he liked to help Sid torture toys for fun. He was first seen with Sid, who blew up a [[Combat Carl]]. Later, when Sid returned home from [[Pizza Planet]] with [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], and an [[Little Green Men|Alien]] in his backpack, Scud lunged into Sid's backpack for toys to chew, and Sid tossed him the alien.

When Woody tried to escape from [[Sid's House|Sid's house]], he encountered Scud, who was asleep halfway down the stairs, forcing Woody to retreat. Unfortunately, his pull-string hoop was caught in one of the curls of the railing as he crept down the upper-level hallway. The hoop then snapped off from the railing, triggering Woody's sampled voice, and Scud woke up and charged toward Woody and Buzz. Buzz told Woody to split up and Woody hid in the closet while Buzz hid in another room. Scud snuck into the room where Buzz is but was forced to back away when he caught sight of Sid's father sleeping on a La-Z-Boy and leaves before Buzz sees the TV commercial for Buzz Lightyear toys and learns that he is a toy for the first time.

Later, when Sid took Buzz out of his room, Woody attempted to give chase. He was able to catch the door before it closed, but as he opened the door again, he was confronted by Scud standing on the far side of the hallway. Catching sight of Woody, the vicious dog charged toward him, prompting Woody to dart back into Sid's room and hold the door shut to prevent Scud's entry. While Scud stationed himself outside the door, ready to attack any toys that emerged out of Sid's room, the [[Mutant Toys|mutant toys]] helped Woody realize the plan to save Buzz from Sid's clutches. The toys tricked Scud into running clear out of the house by sending out the Frog to distract the dog. While chasing after the Frog, Scud knocked down Sid's sister [[Hannah Phillips|Hannah]]―who had just answered the door (only to find Ducky out on the front porch, ready to catch the Frog)―as he jumped onto the front porch. Legs lifted Ducky and the Frog back up through the rafters, with Scud barking at them. He was then subsequently locked out of the house by Hannah who was annoyed at his stupidity.

When Woody and Buzz, after leaving Sid's house, ran after the [[Eggman Movers|moving van]] to catch up with [[Andy Davis|Andy]] and his toys, Scud eyed them and snarls with fury and decides to chase them as revenge for getting him locked out. While Buzz had already made it onto the van, Woody was still trying to climb up a hanging strap; it was during this when Scud caught up with him and attempted to pull him down. Buzz fought Scud off, allowing Woody to climb aboard the moving van, but leaving Buzz behind. Woody dug the [[RC|RC Car]] out of storage and used him to try to drive Buzz back before the other toys still believe that Woody is up to no good as they try to attack Woody. Scud refused to give up and chased Buzz into an intersection with oncoming traffic. At the same time, Woody tried to prove his innocence to the other toys, who ambushed him while controlling RC, forcing him to do spins and spontaneously jump. Unfortunately for Scud, as he entered the intersection not noticing the traffic light in his direction is already red, he triggered an accident in which all the cars crashed into each other, forming a circle that trapped Scud as the angered drivers told the trapped dog to move out of their zone. Buzz was able to escape on RC while Scud was left behind, desperately trying to find a way out to get Woody and Buzz and Buzz realizes that he's saved at last. It is unknown what happened to Scud afterwards.

==Trivia==
*Unlike Scud's portrayal in the film, actual bull terriers are usually gentle and non-threatening dog breeds.
**This is evident during the first onscreen appearance of Scud when Sid blows up Combat Carl directly in front of the dog, causing him to hide in fear and then lash back out angrily at the crater where Combat Carl was.
*In the [[Toy Story (Original Treatment)|earliest draft of ''Toy Story'']], Scud was a hairless pink dog named '''Baby''' who belonged to a young couple who bought the main toys for him to play with. His comeuppance resulted in him landing in a recycling bin and being taken out.
*Out of all the dogs Woody knows, Scud is the only one he is enemies with.
*According to sound designer Gary Rydstrom, Scud's sounds came from dogs (including Rydstrom's own dog, Buster; in which the name would be used for Andy's new dachshund in the sequel), tigers, lions, and elephants.<ref><https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGObAl6SLNU</ref>
