'''Mrs. Rockwaller''' is the mother of [[Connie and Lonnie Rockwaller|Connie, Lonnie]], and [[Bonnie Rockwaller]]. She 
appeared once in the Season 1 episode "[[Downhill]]" of ''[[Kim Possible]]''.

==Personality==
She is shown to have a very different personality from all her daughters, in that she lacks their abrasive attitudes and seems genuinely gregarious and friendly. Mrs. Rockwaller is also shown to be talkative and slightly over-protective of her Bonnie, and to seemingly be unaware of her daughter's cold attitude toward others. Her marital status is unknown.

Mrs. Rockwaller calls Bonnie "Bon-Bon" and "Pumpkin" as pet names â€” much to Bonnie's chagrin, as well as Ron's amusement. Since discovering this, Ron has teasingly called her "Bon-Bon" whenever he gets the chance.
