'''Brad Van Beck''' is a minor character in [[PKNA]]. He is an actor in the Channel 00 soap opera 'Anxieties', playing the main character, Perceval.

==Comic History==
He is first mentioned in "[[PKNA 0: Evronians]]", when [[Donald]] is watching 'Anxieties' and finds Van Beck has been replaced by [[Sean LeDuck]], as it turns that Van Beck has disappeared. When LeDuck goes to writer Sam Plot's house, he finds [[Evronians]] who explain that they abducted Brad Van Beck as an experiment to see if the actors of 'Anxieties' can work as a catalyzer of the viewers' emotions.

Brad Van Beck physically appears in [[PKNA 15: Set, Action|Issue 15]], which is mostly about the 'Anxieties' cast. Brad is shown to still be a prisoner of the Evronians, albeit having TV and good food. When [[Zoster]] brings the rest of the cast as prisoners, he gets into an unending argument with Sean LeDuck about who deserves to be Perceval. After the Evronians are defeated by [[The Duck Avenger]], filming of 'Anxieties' resumes with both actors playing long-lost twins, both named Perceval.
