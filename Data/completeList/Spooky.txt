He is designed to terrify entire populations into submission by morphing into their worst fears; his forms are distinguishable by his glowing green eyes and hissing voice. His one true place is scaring trick-or-treaters on Halloween and (for the rest of the year) haunting the old, abandoned mansion.

==Background==
===Personality===
Spooky causes chaos by fulfilling the purpose he was programmed for: terrifying his enemies by turning into their worst fears. However, he went further by directly harming his victims, aside from just scaring them, and seems to be more dangerous than most experiments. Originally malicious and slightly sadistic, he often chooses to not only provoke fear in his victims, but also cause other mental trauma such as sadness and terror. He tends to slither and hiss like a snake, despite his most common form of being a blob. When people are brave enough to stand up against his scares, Spooky becomes annoyed and apparently powerless against them. However, after being reformed, Spooky only scares people for fun on Halloween. He is also loyal and helpful to his friends, joining [[Stitch]]'s rebellion to fight off [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]].

===Physical appearance===
Spooky's default form is a green blob-like experiment with glowing, olive-green eyes, a wide mouth with a turquoise tongue, two stubby arms and legs, and three round, stubby spikes on his back. When he changes into other forms, the mimics, as convincing as they appear, are distinguishable by his glowing green eyes and hissing voice.

Spooky also appears to have a monstrous, secondary form assumed for combat and intimidation purposes. In this form, he is larger than normal, his spines grow longer, he gains eye stalks and claws, and his mouth becomes a reptilian jaw with jagged teeth. According to [[Stitch's Great Escape!]], the form is called "Spookymorp".

===Powers and abilities===
Spooky can shapeshift into his victims' deepest, darkest fears by taking the form of any person, animal, or object. He can also transform into substances other than solid objects, such as water or a twister. Spooky's body also gives him slime-like properties, for he can slither like a snake and turn elastic when moving.

In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, it is also revealed that Spooky has some limited form of telepathy to read his victims' thoughts and discover their worst fears after being modified by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 300 was the 300th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to terrorize his victims by morphing into their worst fears. 300 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 300's pod landing on a house roof.

On Halloween night, a gust of wind caused 300's pod to roll down the roof's rain gutter and into a rain barrel, activating the experiment. 300 then noticed a mouse and scared it off by turning into a wild cat. When a dog attacked 300 because of the cat form, the latter frightened the dog away by turning into a dogcatcher, then fled the scene in his elastic form.

300 shortly after attacked a children's Halloween party at [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s [[Kaiāulu Hale|school]], scaring [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]] off by turning into a headless Lilo, then terrifying [[Moses Puloki|Moses]] by turning into a giant spider. Presumably after this, 300 lurked somewhere inside and waited for his next victim.

Lilo and [[Stitch]] later arrived to discover the party in disarray. When Stitch entered the kitchen to raid the fridge, 300 locked himself in the kitchen with Stitch and almost drowned the latter by turning into floodwaters. However, 300 was forced to retreat up through an air vent when Lilo noticed his presence, relieving Stitch.

Sometime later, 300 arrived at the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where he terrified [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] by turning into [[Cobra Bubbles]] and claiming he came to take Lilo away. However, when Lilo and Stitch returned to the home and noticed Cobra to be 300 from his hissing voice, they exposed 300, named Spooky, as an impostor, forcing him to hurry off again.

Lilo, Stitch, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and [[Pleakley]] followed Spooky into the old mansion, where he surprised and terrorized Lilo by turning into a clown. Stitch unintentionally fell into an indoor swimming pool after Lilo's shriek startled him. Spooky then chased after Lilo in his clown form, scaring her to the point where she clung to a high pillar screaming for help. 

While Stitch attempted to save a helpless Lilo, he lost his grip on the pool's diving board and sank to the bottom. However, he overcame his aquaphobia by singing "[[Aloha ʻOe]]" (a song that Lilo taught him as a coping tactic), and after emerging from the pool, he managed to rescue Lilo in the nick of time.

Meanwhile, Spooky defeated Jumba and Pleakley by turning into their worst fears: [[Mrs. Pleakley|Pleakley's mom]] and Jumba's ex-wife, but Stitch saw and attacked Spooky's latter form. When Spooky noticed that Stitch had successfully faced his fears, and was thus undaunted by any other scary transformations, the former turned into a bat and attempted to escape up the chimney, but was ambushed and captured in a containment orb by Stitch.

Spooky then found his one true place scaring trick-or-treaters on Halloween and (on other occasions) haunting the old, abandoned house.

In "[[The Asteroid]]", Spooky was one of the six experiments that Stitch convinced to come with him and Lilo to save Earth from an approaching asteroid (Spooky briefly morphed into one to clarify). Along the journey, [[Kixx]] kicked the back of Spooky's seat, causing the latter (using his nightmarish morphing ability) to retaliate. Spooky later attempted to use a monstrous form to scare Pleakley into giving him free soda, but Pleakley only replied with an order for Spooky to return to his seat.

Spooky was one of the experiments in "[[Checkers (episode)|Checkers]]" that joined Stitch in a rebellion against [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]. Spooky even morphed into Gantu for clarification.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Spooky, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Spooky participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by using nightmarish forms to scare Leroys.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Spooky made an appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime where he was released by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] along with [[Toons]] to scare the children of a summer camp. It is shown that he uses a form of telepathy to read his victim's mind and discover their worst fears. In "Shogun", it is shown that Spooky was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
Spooky makes a cameo in the pre-show of [[Stitch's Great Escape!]] when [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] shows guests a quick look at the "criminals" of the galaxy (which are all experiments). However, he does not appear in his true form, but rather the form he used on [[Pleakley]] shown in "[[The Asteroid]]". Underneath the image, his name is rendered as "300M/Spookymorp" (presumably meant to be "Spookymorp''h''") in [[Tantalog language|Tantalog]].

==Trivia==
*Spooky was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.
*Spooky is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having glowing, olive-green eyes instead.
*Spooky is one of the few known experiments whose powers Stitch is vulnerable to.
*Spooky and [[Morpholomew]] are the only known experiments that have shapeshifting/transforming abilities.
*Spooky is shown to have the ability to speak, although he appears to be only capable of speaking fluently when shapeshifting into something that can talk.
*Jumba referred to Spooky as "X-300" (ex three hundred) and mentions that his impression of Jumba's ex-wife is frightening.
**Disney has used "X-" (X with a hyphen) in promotional material as a shorthand prefix for "Experiment".
*Unlike most experiments, Spooky's number is pronounced as a whole number ("three hundred") instead of three individual digits (which in his case would have been "three-oh-oh") as per the norm for the experiments.
**The only other experiment seen in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]] whose number is also referred to as a whole number is [[Woops]] (Experiment 600). This implies that experiments whose number is divisible by one hundred (100) are the primary exceptions to the normal by-digit pronunciation of experiment numbers.
*Spooky's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is green in the original series. In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, it is red.
