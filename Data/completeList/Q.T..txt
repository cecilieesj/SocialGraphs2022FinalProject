==Personality==
He isÂ a slow-witted, but good-natured orangutan who is the resident strongman and calliope player (in earlier episodes, he was accompanied by a small pink creature while playing the calliope). He makes friends easily and has other talents, like kite making. He sometimes doesn't know his own strength, which sometimes results in some misfortunes.

Q.T. joined the circus following Lilli.

Q.T. is one of the few characters who actually consider Sebastian a friend, the other being Fair Dinkum's little sister Matilda.
