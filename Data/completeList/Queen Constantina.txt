Ha!"}}'''Queen Constantina''' is the of [[King Maximilian]]'s wife and [[Prince Christopher]]'s mother of the [[1997]] film ''[[Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella]]''. In this version, she seems to take over the role of [[The King (Cinderella)|The King]] from the [[1950]] [[Cinderella|film of the same name]].

==Role in the film==
Queen Constantina writes at her desk as she waits for her son, [[Prince Christopher]], to answer her summons. When he arrives, she informs him that she's inviting all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to a ball where hopefully he will be able to select a bride. Seeing that he clearly isn't overjoyed by this turn of events, but not understanding why, she asks her husband, [[King Maximilian]], to talk some sense into him. He tells him that all they want is for him to be happy, but Queen Constantina exclaims that happiness has nothing to do with getting married. Of course, she adds, they ''want'' him to be happy, but their primary concern is for him to find a bride and produce an heir. He tries to explain that he wants to fall in love with someone in his own way, but Queen Constantina states that there's no reason he can't do so at the ball. Noticing that she hasn't heard a word he's said, he exits the room.

Spying their servant [[Lionel (Cinderella 1997)|Lionel]]'s jacket peeking out from behind a curtain, Queen Constantina drags him into the room, quells his attempts at telling her that Prince Christopher doesn't seem too thrilled at the idea of another ball, and commands him to write down their proclamation. Soon, she sends him off to inform the kingdom of the ball as well as order various necessities for it.

On the day of the ball, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina are overseeing the preparations and Prince Christopher is not at all happy about it. He confronts them and demands that they cancel it by telling everyone that they are very ashamed of themselves for going behind his back. Queen Constantina is appalled at the very idea of being ashamed, as is King Maximilian. But before they can really get arguing, Lionel uses his diplomacy skills to arrange a compromise. Although Prince Christopher will go to the ball (to Queen Constantina's satisfaction), if he fails to find a bride there he will be allowed to find one in his own way in his own time without any interference from King Maximilian and Queen Constantina (to the latter's alarm). Speechless, she tries to appeal to King Maximilian, but he believes that its a fair agreement. Reluctantly, she agrees to the terms. Prince Christopher is so happy he kisses her cheek, hugs King Maximilian, and gives Lionel a grateful pat before he takes his leave. Lionel reassures King Maximilian and Queen Constantina that he can feel in his bones that Prince Christopher will find a bride at the ball, but Queen Constantina says he "will feel it in his bones if he doesn't" and slaps him off his ladder. Glancing unconcernedly at him, she and King Maximilian depart.

Later that evening, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina presided over the ball from their thrones, watching Prince Christopher dance unenthusiastically with various maidens. Queen Constantina is certain that he is bound to find ''someone'', but King Maximilian isn't so optimistic. However, Queen Constantina turns out to be right when the mysterious [[Cinderella (1997 character)|Cinderella]] arrives and sweeps a mesmerized Prince Christopher off his feet. King Maximilian and Queen Constantina are very intrigued by her as they watch her dance with him.

After it becomes clear that Prince Christopher is positively spellbound by Cinderella and no one else, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina join in the dancing in order to meet her. Deftly switching partners, Queen Constantina slips into a dance with Prince Christopher as King Maximilian slides into a dance with Cinderella. Prince Christopher is worried that King Maximilian is intimidating Cinderella, but Queen Constantina smugly mentions that it shouldn't matter since he thought he wouldn't find anyone at the ball before they switch partners again. Queen Constantina asks Cinderella about her family, hoping to be introduced to them, but she becomes uncomfortable with her questions and runs outside, nearly stepping on Lionel, whom [[Cinderella's Stepmother|Cinderella's stepmother]] accidentally threw to the ground in her attempt to get close to Cinderella. Prince Christopher, fretful that Queen Constantina somehow scared her off, ''does'' step on Lionel as he quickly follows her. Completely bemused at this unexpected reaction, King Maximilian and Queen Constantina wander off to discuss Cinderella after glancing unconcernedly at the once-again fallen Lionel.

The next time King Maximilian and Queen Constantine see Prince Christopher, he's pushing past them to chase after Cinderella. Unfortunately, he is unable to catch her this time.

The next morning, a very concerned King Maximilian and Queen Constantina ask Prince Christopher to eat something. He declares that he won't do so or rest until he finds Cinderella, despite Queen Constantine's warning that he knows nothing about her except that she's beautiful, and she says that all the women at the ball were equally beautiful. He rejects the idea, explaining that she's unlike any girl he's ever met. Although Queen Constantina wonders how he could know something like that after only one night, she recognizes that he is determined to find her again and so she orders Lionel to help Prince Christopher in his search.

Soon enough, Queen Constantina is happily standing alongside King Maximilian as they attend Prince Christopher and Cinderella's wedding.
