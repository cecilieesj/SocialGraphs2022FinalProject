'''Darr Gordy''' is [[Dutch Gordy|Dutch]]'s younger brother and a member of the KaneCo Cadettes, from the show [[Motorcity]].

==History==
He is Dutch's brother and new cadet to Kane, most likely replacing [[Mike Chilton|Mike]]. At first it looked like he was going to turn in the Burners, but after seeing Dutch save some deluxians he reconsidered and was made a Burner...technically. He is now another inside connection to Kane.
