'''Glimmer''' is a character from the ''[[Disney Fairies]]'' television special ''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''. She is a storm-talent fairy.

==Background==
As mentioned above, Glimmer is a storm-talent fairy and has dedicated most of her time to training for the Pixie Hollow Games. Her constant training even prevents her from traveling to the Mainland with the other fairies. It took her three tries to actually become the partner of [[Rumble]] for the Games. Like Rumble, she is in it to win, but unlike her partner, she is not conceited.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===
Glimmer is the partner of renowned storm-talent sparrowman [[Rumble]] in the Pixie Hollow Games. Together, they prove to be an unstoppable force throughout many of the competitions. They came in second during the first event, which made Rumble upset and caused Glimmer to have to boost his ego. During the rest of the games, they came in first many times. At the last event, Rumble cheated by using her lightning powers to zap [[Rosetta]] and [[Chloe (fairy)|Chloe]]'s cart wheels. Glimmer decided not to cross the finish line, which made Rosetta and Chloe win, since both team members had to cross the finish line together in order to win.

===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''===
Glimmer can be seen beside [[Clank and Bobble|Clank]] in the audience in the Four Seasons Festival.

==Trivia==
*Glimmer shares the name and appearance of a character from ''The Hunger Games''.
