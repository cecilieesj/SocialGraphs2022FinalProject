She wanted him to arrest her but declined that Princess is even here, not knowing Freddy and Gracie brought her back this time. Avery jokingly wanted the officer to search the house and if Princess is here, he can arrest her and her family.

When Tyler told her, Avery stalled them long enough to leave their house, while leaving Officer Thompson apologizes for their toilet.
