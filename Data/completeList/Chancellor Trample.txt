'''Chancellor Trample''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode "[[The Road to Macadamia]]".

He is a power-hungry vulture who seeks to unsurp the throne of King Amok in order to gain the riches of the royal house of Macadamia.

==Biography==
At first, Trample plans to do this by secretly raising taxes to make the king unpopular and the kingdom's citizens and coffers poor. At the time of [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[King Louie#TaleSpin|Louie]]'s arrival, he hatches another scheme to marry Amok's daughter Princess [[Lotta Lamour]], as the three of them attempt to uncover the plot despite him having his own small army of Royal Guard rhinos at his command.

When Trample's plans go awry, he confesses his crimes, begging to be locked up and tortured rather than having to endure any more of Baloo and Louie's antics, which all parties agree to heartily.
