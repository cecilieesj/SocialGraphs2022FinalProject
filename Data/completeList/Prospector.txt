:''Not to be confused with "[[Stinky Pete]]" from the [[Toy Story (franchise)|"Toy Story" franchise]] who is also known as "The Prospector".''
The '''Prospector'''<ref>Page 4 of "America Sings" soundtrack book</ref> is a character from the defunct [[America Sings]] attraction at [[Disneyland]].

==History==
===Background===
The prospector is an anthropomorphic dog who sings the song "Who Shot the Hole in My Sombrero?". He is shown to be riding on a mule while singing a song about who exactly shot a hole in his hat caused by an unknown outlaw who fired a bullet on his hat to receive a hole.

===Development history===
The prospector was created in the former [[America Sings]] attraction which opened on [[June 29]], [[1974]] at [[Disneyland]] where he appeared in the attraction's second act focused on the Old West. America Sings later closed on [[April 10]], [[1988]] where the Weasel and the rest of the animatronics would be moved to [[Splash Mountain]] in order to retheme the former "America Sings" building to "[[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]]". However, while the prospector himself does not appear in the attraction, his mule can be seen during the "[[How Do You Do?]]" sequence. The reason why the prospector didn't appear in Splash Mountain is unknown.

As of [[2020]], Splash Mountain is slated for closure in order to remove references to ''[[Song of the South]]'', due to outdated cultural depictions from the film itself which the attraction is based on to make way for a [[The Princess and the Frog|''Princess and the Frog'']]-[[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|themed attraction]]. Therefore, it is unknown of what will replace the mule which the prospector rode on in the rethemed version of the attractions at the California version.

==Appearances==

===[[America Sings]]===
The prospector appears singing the musical number "Who Shot the Hole in My Sombrero?" where he is seen sitting on his mule while singing a song about an unknown culprit who fired a hole in his sombrero. After singing, [[the Weasel]] pops out of a TNT barrel next to him just before the attraction loops into the "End of Billy the Kid" sequence performed by the [[Boothill Boys]].

===[[Splash Mountain]]===
While the prospector himself doesn't directly appear in the attraction, his mule does make an appearance in the Disneyland version of the attraction where it can be seen during the "[[How Do You Do?]]" sequence.

==Trivia==
*Originally, the prospector was inserted with a Mexican accent during an early version of the recording of the song "Who Shot the Hole in My Sombrero?",  but the press didn't like it and ordered a change for the accent. The song was re-recorded in the final version of the attraction where he speaks in a Texan cowboy accent.
**Despite this, the audio track of the prospector speaking with a Mexican accent still exists on the [[1974]] [[America Sings (soundtrack)|LP recording of the attraction]].
