After practice in the Locker room Destiny's friend and teammate Carolyn Smith goes up to Destiny and asks her if she is okay.

Destiny goes into Coach Korn office after practice crying and tells him that he really hurt her feelings when he fat-shamed her in front of everybody. Marvyn Korn tells Destiny that he’s sorry that he said that and he didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. Then Destiny tells him that she doesn’t play Basketball because she loves it.
