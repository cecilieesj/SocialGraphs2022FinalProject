===''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''===
Due to the costs and fines [[J. Thaddeus Toad|Toad]] had accumulated due to the recklessness of his manias, MacBadger had agreed to put his affairs in order but soon found himself at his wits' end having to record costly sums for damages and destruction as well as keep debtors away until he had the money for them. Ratty and Moley come at his urgent request, asking them to try and reason with Toad as he has yet another new mania: he's out "rampaging about the county" in a canary yellow gypsy cart with a horse named [[Cyril Proudbottom|Cyril]].

After Toad's arrest, MacBadger is called as a witness for the prosecution, who reveals to the court that Angus had cut off Toad's allowance due to his recklessness (even though all MacBadger could say before the [[The Prosecutor|prosecution]] put words in his mouth was "Well, uh..."). After Cyril's testimony about Toad trading Toad Hall to a pack of [[weasels]] for a motorcar, MacBadger faints and Ratty and Mole try to revive him.

On Christmas Day, after Toad seeks refuge in Ratty's house after escaping from prison, MacBadger arrives with urgent news: the weasels have overtaken Toad Hall with [[Winkie]] as their ringleader, in possession of the deed to the property. After a reunion with Toad, Angus reminds him that, in order to prove to the law that he was innocent, they had to get the deed back from Winkie as proof. So the four friends sneak into Toad Hall via a secret route and engage Winkie and the weasels in a deadly game of "keep away" with the deed. After escaping, MacBadger is proud to see that, in the midst of all the confusion, Toad had secured the deed and disguised it as a paper airplane.

New Year's rolls around and Angus, Ratty and Moley toast to the new year (and to the reputedly reformed Toad). However, their joy is cut short when they see that Toad has relapsed again, flying about with Cyril in an old airplane. MacBadger faints again as if to say "Here we go again..."

===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===
Although Ratty, Mole and Toad have sizeable roles in the re-acting of Charles Dicken's [[A Christmas Carol|''A Christmas Carol'']]'', [[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' MacBadger's role is a brief cameo.  He is briefly seen dancing at Fezzwigs' during [[Scrooge McDuck|Ebenezer Scrooge]]'s past as he remembers his past and his sorrows.
