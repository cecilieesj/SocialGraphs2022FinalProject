'''Lanny Onasis'''Â was Matt's best friend from the show ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''.

He never spoke on-screen, but Matt seemed to have no problem communicating with him. He was a direct descendant of Crispus Attucks. In the episode "[[Movin' On Up]]," Matt and Lanny try out for cheerleading, but do not take the position on the squad because there is only room for one of them and they do not want to split up.
