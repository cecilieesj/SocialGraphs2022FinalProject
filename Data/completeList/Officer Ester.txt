==Role in the film==
Officer Ester was working at desk when [[Officer Lloyd|Lloyd]] turned in for the night. Not knowing [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] and [[Rhino]] are sneaking in to free [[Mittens]], she assumes the doors sliding open are Lloyd sneaking back in to ambush her, and threatens to use her pepper spray on him. When she returns to find her truck blown up, she sprayed [[Officer Martin|Martin]] when he came out, scaring her, thinking that he and Lloyd are the cause of it.

==Trivia==
*Ester made a ironic comment that she "feels like she's working with toddlers", knowing that she suffers from {{WikipediaLink|dwarfism}}.
*Ester makes a cameo in ''[[Big Hero 6]]'' as a portrait on [[Sergeant Gerson]]'s desk.
