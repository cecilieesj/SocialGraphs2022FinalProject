{{Quote|I told you there'd be consequences!|Lizard to [[Spider-Man]]}}

The '''Lizard''' is the alter ego of '''Dr. Curtis "Curt" Connors'''. He appears as an antagonist in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', played by [[Rhys Ifans]], reprising his role from ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.

The Lizard was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.

==Background==
===Personality===
Connors loves to make inventions based from anything or anyone, creating new weapons and technologies for S.H.I.E.L.D. He's inspired to build new inventions based from others like [[Spider-Man]].

===Physical appearance===
Connors is a Caucasian man a lab coat. He has brown hair and blue eyes.

As the reptilian alter-ego, the Lizard is a large humanoid that is taller. His tail and tongue are incredibly long, the latter allowing the Lizard olfactory abilities, and has sharp claws and teeth.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Curt himself has the normal physical strength of a human male of his age, height, and build that engages in little regular exercise. While transformed, he possesses sufficient superhuman strength. He can overpower normal humans, turn over standard vehicles such as cars and vans, he is even slightly stronger Spider-Man who himself is stronger than normal humans as well.
*'''Superhuman Speed:''' While transformed, Curt can run and move at speeds greater than that of the finest human athlete and can reach a top speed of about 45 miles per hour. He is shown to be slightly slower than Spider-Man.
*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' While transformed, Curt's advanced musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair him.
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' While transformed, Curt's scaly skin and superhumanly enhanced bodily tissues provide him much greater resistance to physical injury than an ordinary human. He can withstand great impact forces, falls from great heights, and small caliber bullets without sustaining injury.
*'''Superhuman Agility:''' In his transformed state, Curt's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete. He is slightly less agile than Spider-Man.
*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Curt's reflexes are similarly enhanced while transformed and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite the Lizard's physical durability, he can sustain physical injury. However, if injured, his body is able to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. While transformed, Curt's healing powers are developed to the point where he can fully regenerate missing limbs, just like many known reptile species.

====Abilities====
*'''Genius-Level Intellect:''' Curt has a genius-level intelligence and is an expert in reptiles as well. in his transformed state, he can talk and is still intelligent albeit twisted.
*'''Advanced Hand-to-Hand Combatant:''' Although he has had no formal combat training, his powers alone coupled with his natural savagery in his transformed state make him a formidable combatant.

[[File:Lizard's_arm.png|thumb|250px|left|Connors partially through his mutation.]]
When Spider-Man received a tour around the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier from Fury, Curt Connors showed up to reveal that he worked on several Spider Gadgets he had been working on. He showed the Spider-Cycle and gave it to Spider-Man for a ride.

After Spider-Man was rescued by S.H.I.E.L.D., he brought a piece of [[Doctor Octopus]]' tentacle with it, which made Curt enthusiastic of its technology.

After S.H.I.E.L.D. raided one of Doctor Octopus' secret labs, Connors discovered a stash of mutagenic animal DNA Octavius planned to use to develop super-powered individuals. Dr. Connors planned to use this DNA for a different purpose - restoring human bodies. Namely, regrowing his own arm after losing it when Goblin attacked the Helicarrier.

Ignoring Spider-Man's warning about using it for such purposes, Connors took a serum of lizard DNA, growing back his lost arm. While it initially gave him great strength, Connors soon lost control of his mutation, transforming into a giant lizard creature. Spider-Man, with the help of his teammates and Dr. Octopus, was able to put an end to the Lizard's rampage, transforming him back into Doctor Connors.

Otto later captured the doctor and used a special device to control him as the Lizard and made him part of the Sinister Six. Spider-Man eventually caused Connors to resist the control and he forced Otto to the ground. However, the Lizard managed to escape into the sewers.

[[File:The Lizard.png|thumb|250px|right|A fully transformed Lizard.]]
Since then, the Lizard had begun stealing equipment from Midtown High School. One night during a storm, he abducts [[Phil Coulson]], [[Mary Jane Watson]], and [[Harry Osborn]]. Spider-Man ventures into an abandoned subway tunnel to rescue them with the help of [[Stan Lee|Stan]] the Janitor, where it is revealed that the Lizard was using the stolen equipment to build a machine that would enable him to keep his Dr. Curt Connors side dormant. After defeating him, Spider-Man attempts to bring back the Conners side, but inadvertently allows the Lizard to render his Dr. Connors side dormant and escapes after being repelled by Spider-Man and Stan.

In the episode "Return of the Sinister Six", the Lizard is fitted with an armored outfit created by Doctor Octopus using stolen OsCorp technology and had been apparently placed under his control. Spider-Man and Iron Patriot (Norman Osborn) encounter him in the sewers where they discover an antidote recipe that the Lizard must have written after the latter's escape from the battle. Lizard later accompanies Doctor Octopus to Ryker's Island to free Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Rhino, and Scorpion to assemble the new and armored Sinister Six to attack Spider-Man. When the rest of Spider-Man's team arrive and Iron Patriot, Spider-Man fights Lizard within Ryker's Island and tries to get through to him. Eventually, Spider-Man successfully restores him back to Connors then he thanks Spider-Man for restoring him to normal. However, Norman is changed back to the Green Goblin as a price and captures Spider-Man's team.

When Spider-Man goes after Green Goblin to rescue his team, Connors supplies Spider-Man with an antidote for Green Goblin. After Spider-Man restores his teammates with the antidote then defeats Green Goblin, Connors determines that it will take some time to revert Green Goblin back to normal.

Connors is later turned back into a Lizard by Doctor Octopus and gains the ability to turn other people into lizards just by biting them. Although Spider-Man once again reversed the mutation, Octopus would continue to use Lizard serum to transform Crossbones into the Lizard for his new Sinister Six.

====''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''====
[[File:Lizard No Way Home.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Lizard in Sanctum cell in ''Spider-Man: No Way Home''.]]
Due to [[Doctor Strange]]'s botched spell to make the world forget the secret identity of [[Spider-Man]], Lizard was transported out of his home dimension. Strange later captures him prowling the sewers, making him the Sanctum's first prisoner. He soon crosses eyes with a freshly captured [[Doctor Octopus]] and scares the Peter Parker of that dimension as well.

Later, as [[Sandman]] and [[Electro]] are captured, Lizard is surprised to see Electro again since he knew him when he was Max Dillon, especially noting that his physique from before was dismal. Electro then revealed to everyone how Lizard had attempted to turn New York into a city populated by mutant lizards, an act that Lizard called the next step in evolution. He then became confused when Strange revealed that most of the prisoners had died in their respective dimensions while confronting Spider-Man. Peter takes pity on these villains and stops Strange from sending them home until he finds a way to save them from their fate.

Peter moves the villains to [[Happy Hogan]]'s apartment, though Lizard chooses to stay in a FEAST truck. When [[Green Goblin]] turns the other villains (except Octavius, who was already cured) against Spider-Man and attacks him, Lizard witnesses this and escapes the truck, scaring J. Jonah Jameson who took him for a dinosaur, who took him for a dinosaur. Lizard briefly lashes out at Peter while reminding him that he had warned him of the consequences.

Lizard, Electro, and Sandman travel later that night to Liberty Island to confront Spider-Man who teams up with two other displaced Spider-Men, one of whom is [[The Amazing Spider-Man|the same Spider-Man who defeated Lizard years before]]. As the battle began, Lizard immediately attacked his nemesis until he was stuck in synthetic webbing. Once freed, the reptile chases Ned Leeds and MJ Jones through a portal briefly taking them to a lab before returning to the Statue of Liberty. He then lunges at his Spider-Man yet again, only to bite into a cure specially designed to undo his mutation, once again bringing him back to Curt Connors. Following the Green Goblin's defeat, Connors is taken home by Strange before reality collapses.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Curt Connors didn't work for S.H.I.E.L.D. and lost an arm during a war, he used a formula derived from lizard DNA (because of the reptilian ability of regenerating lost limbs) to re-grow his arm, but took side effect that changed him into a lizard and became known as the reptilian supervillain of Spider-Man, the Lizard.
*Although Connors was voiced by Tom Kenny in season 1, [[Dee Bradley Baker]]'s start to voicing Connors is a reprisal of his role from the previous ''Spider-Man'' animated show ''The Spectacular Spider-Man''.
*The shot of Lizard turning back into Curt Connors in ''No Way Home'' is an unused take from ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.
*The Lizard is the only one of the villains in ''No Way Home'' whose design was not changed from his debut film in some capacity. But his facial look has changed a little bit, His teeth are more sharp than in the 2012 film and on the top of his head appear to be small bumpy fin like ridges.
**[[Green Goblin]] gets rid of his mask and replaces it with a purple hood like the comics.
**[[Doctor Octopus]] gains Stark nanotechnology on his tentacles.
**[[Sandman]] can no longer turn back into his human form and is now fully made of sand.
**[[Electro]] was completely redesigned to better match the mainstream version.
*Like in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', Lizard's right hand only has four fingers due to his arm being amputated prior to his transformation.
*Lizard and Sandman are the only two displaced villains in the MCU who haven't died before.
*Like [[Sandman]]'s actor [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Rhys Ifans]] did not physically appear on the set of ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''. Instead, Infans just recorded his lines and old footage from their respective films of their transformations were used instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-sandman-lizard-return-explained/|title=Sandman & Lizard Actors Didn't Return For Spider-Man: No Way Home|website=Screen Rant|date=[[April 16]], [[2022]]|access-date=[[April 20]], [[2022]]}}</ref>
