He is designed to zap a pink ray that changes anyone's appearance into something ridiculous. Also, the new dorky clothes cannot be taken off the victim unless the horns are rotated upside-down, after which every victim will automatically be restored to normal. He appears in ''[[Stitch!]]''.

==Background==
Experiment 122 was the 122nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to zap a pink ray from his horns that changes anyone's clothing into something ridiculous. 122 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.
===Physical appearance===
Dorkifier is a pink and white calf-like experiment with two horns, a red nose and purple hooves.

===Powers and abilities===
Dorkifier can cause victims to look dorky by zapping them with a pink ray from his horns. The new dorky clothes can only be taken off when his horns are turned down.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch!]]''===
In his eponymous debut, Dorkifier was accidentally sent to [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]], who originally intended to send [[Hertz Donut]] in yet another attempt at capturing [[Stitch]]. However, Hämsterviel was in a rush and selected the pod for 122 instead of 022. After his activation, Dorkifier used his powers to change Gantu's uniform into dorky civilian clothes. Dorkifier then escaped and went on a rampage, changing other people's appearance into something ridiculous, including Stitch, [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Hiroman]]. 

Later, after a long chase, Dorkifier is captured by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], and Stitch reverses Dorkifier's effects by turning down his horns, reverting everyone's dorky clothing to their original clothing. In "Shogun", it is shown that Dorkifier was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in Jumba's vault.

==Trivia==
*His name in [[Japan]]ese is ドーキファイ, which translates directly to Dokifi (pronounced dough-key-fai). This is how the pronunciation of Dorkifier was localized into Japanese.
*Altering the position of Dorkifier's horns in order to reverse his powers is the same way to reverse the effects of [[Shoe]]. Also, the closeness of their numbers (113 and 122) and movable horn feature may suggest that Jumba had been inspired by the same DNA source when creating both. This would be a similar concept to how Jumba reused some for Twang's DNA when creating [[Bragg]].
*Dorkifier's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue.
