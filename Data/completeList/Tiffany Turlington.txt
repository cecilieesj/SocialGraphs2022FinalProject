[[File:Char 31875.jpg|thumb]]'''Tiffany Turlington''' is a dog, who fell off a plane like [[Brandy Harrington]] and [[Mr. Whiskers]] in the [[Brandy & Mr. Whiskers|animated series of the same name]]. She is claimed to be very rich and has said to have visited many different places. Brandy, feeling the need to prove she's good friend material, lied to Tiffany about the places she'd been too when she really never had. While Brandy has a musical leash, she has one with a tracker bug. She also claims to be from Texas.

==Physical Description==
She is very similar in appearance to Brandy and shares many interests with her. Tiffany has dark-colored, curved ears (similar to pigtails), brown fur, and green eyes. She usually wears a blue short-sleeved shirt that exposes her stomach, black pants, and blue platform sandals with blue stripe. She also wears a light blue bikini. She, like Brandy, wears what appears to be a collar on her neck.
