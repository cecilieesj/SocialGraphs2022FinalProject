'''Delgado''' is the deuteragonist of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2008]] live-action film, ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', the main tritagonist of the [[2011]] [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2|sequel]], and a minor character in the [[2012]] [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3: Viva la Fiesta|sequel]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]''===
Delgado is a police dog who was once a member of the police force where he was after a Doberman Pinscher named [[El Diablo]], but he has lost his sense of smell after he and his former partner were ambushed by Diablo. Unable to help his injured partner, Delgado got kicked out of the force. 

He meets [[Chloe]] after he rescues her from a dogfight with Diablo. She thanks Delgado for saving her and asks him if he could help her find her way back to Beverly Hills. Delgado refuses at first, but after Chloe insists that she was dognapped and being pursued by Diablo, the police dog reluctantly helps her by keeping her from being detected.

Along the way, Chloe constantly pesters Delgado by asking him agitating questions. Later, while Delgado was asking for help from one of his German Shepherd friends, Chloe gets tricked by a rat named [[Manuel]] and an iguana named [[Chico]], who talk her into giving them her diamond collar. When Delgado finds out, he quickly becomes furious with her because that collar was evidence to where she lived.

Later, Chloe and Delgado become stranded in a desert after jumping off a train they stowed away on earlier. They eventually encounter a large group of stray Chihuahuas led by [[Montezuma (Chihuahua)|Monte]], who save them from three vicious mountain lions. Chloe and Delgado then stay for a short time at the Chihuahua pack's birthplace.

After some time, Chloe and Delgado arrive at a national park in [[Mexico]], where Chloe is recognized by an employee. Unfortunately, Chloe is found and taken away by El Diablo to [[Vasquez]] and his henchman, [[Rafferty]].

Sometime later, the same rat and iguana from before help Delgado by presenting him with Chloe's collar. Delgado sniffs it several times before he gets his sense of smell back as he goes to find Chloe. He eventually finds Diablo and defeats him by pinning him to the ground, although Diablo manages to slip away. Shortly after, Delgado becomes a member of the police force again and bids Chloe farewell before he leaves with his new partner.

===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]''===
Delgado reappears in the second film, where he saves [[Papi Jr.]] from a deadly fall. [[Papi]] and Chloe, along with [[Sam Cortez|Sam]], discover him and thank Delgado for saving their son, with Papi stating that he is forever in his debt. Sam calls Delgado's owner who is wrapping up a big case and won't be able to pick him up for a few weeks, so Sam lets Delgado stay with Papi and Chloe's family in the meantime.

Later, Delgado, along with Papi, Chloe, and [[Pedro (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Pedro]], participate in a dog fashion show to win a large cash prize for Papi and Chloe's family to save Sam and [[Rachel Ashe|Rachel]]'s family home, although Delgado is the first one to be disqualified for unknown reasons. Though Papi had initially won, because of the lack of breed papers, he is disqualified as well. Due to these actions, the dogs lose to an arrogant [[France|French]] poodle named [[Appoline]], much to their chagrin. 

Delgado's main role is that he finds [[Alberto and Antonio]] (Degaldo's sons) whom he had regretfully abandoned as puppies at a police station, due to an incident in the past. Later, after helping capture the [[Robbers|bank robbers]], Chloe and her family eventually explain to Delgado's sons why he did it, and they accept this from their father, thus earning him a place in Beverly Hills in the [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] force for a while, and giving him and his sons more time to catch up a little.

===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3: Viva la Fiesta|Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3]]''===
Delgado has a smaller role in the third film. He shows up at the hotel garden that was vandalized by accident, listening to Papi about his plan to expose [[Jenny (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Jenny]] for her evil acts. After Papi and Pedro make her trip and fall in a puddle of peanut butter, Delgado is seen dangling [[Mr. Montague]] from a tree. He then drags [[Oscar (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Oscar]] into a police car. He is later seen at [[Rosa]]'s quinceañera, celebrating with everyone else.

==Etymology==
*The name '''Delgado''' means "thin" in Spanish. 

==Trivia==
*The dog that portrayed Delgado is named '''Sam'''.
*It is unknown on what happened to Delgado's wife, although she could have possibly died after giving birth to [[Alberto and Antonio]].
**It is also possible that she was killed by the bank robbers as Delgado had been told that his family would be targeted for revenge.
*If viewers look in a deleted scene of the first DVD movie, Delgado is seen eating crickets (much to [[Chloe]]'s disgust) and says "Tastes like chicken", the same line [[Timon]] said in ''[[The Lion King]]'' with a young [[Simba]] being disgusted at Timon eating a grub.
