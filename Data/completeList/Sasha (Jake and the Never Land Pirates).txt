'''Sasha ''' is [[Red Jessica]]'s pet Bengal tiger from the [[Disney Junior]] animated series [[Jake and the Never Land Pirates|''Jake and the Never Land Pirates.'']]'' ''

==Role in the series==
Sasha first appeared in the episode, "[[Hook and the Itty-Bitty Kitty]]". In this episode, [[Red Jessica]] called for [[Captain Hook]]'s presence, much to the lovestruck captain's delight. Unfortunately for him, he was called over only to catsit Red Jessica's hydrophobic kitten, [[Rosie (Jake and the Never Land Pirates) |Rosie]], while she ran errands on the sea. But as soon as Red Jessica's departs, Captain Hook loses Rosie in the jungle of [[Crimson Isle]], and so needs the help of both his and [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]]'s crew to find her. They finally found the kitty playing on top of the sleeping tiger, Sasha, and Captain Hook had to muscle enough courage to rescue Rosie from Sasha's grasp. Sasha awakened with a roar, and the pirates escaped using [[Izzy]]'s [[Pixie Dust |pixie dust]] before Red Jessica got back. When Red Jessica returned, she was delighted to see that Hook has taken a liking to her kitten, and decided to introduce him to her other "kitty"- her tiger Sasha, which sends Hook fleeing back to the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]].
