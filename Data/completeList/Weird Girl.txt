'''Weird Girl''' is a supporting character in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2012]] film ''[[Frankenweenie]]''. She is one of [[Victor Frankenstein]]'s classmates and is well known for her eerie gaze, and strange personality. She is 12-years-old.

==Description==
Weird Girl doesn’t fit in well with the other kids. She delivers ominous pronouncements in a monotone voice with an unnerving stare. Her constant companion is her fluffy white cat [[Mr. Whiskers (Frankenweenie)|Mr. Whiskers]], whose unblinking gaze matches her own. The other kids give them a wide berth—especially when Weird Girl rambles about Mr. Whiskers’ dreams.
