'''Peter "Pink-Eye Pete" Ogilvy''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is a student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] who has a notorious condition and thus, is constantly avoided by [[Pepper Ann Pearson]].

==Background==
Peter Ogilvy, better known as Pink-Eye Pete is the most unpopular student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]]. [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] considers him a nuisance and is always trying to avoid him. Ironically, the reason for his condition is entirely her own fault. In "[[Dear Debby]]", it is revealed that Pepper Ann sent him to the nurse's office to check his hangnail, unaware that it was under quarantine for pink eye. Since then, he has been viewed as a pariah; made all the more worse by the fact that all of his hobbies just so happen to involve him looking through things (binoculars, microscopes, etc.). He apparently has owned up to his pink eye, as he took great offense at Pepper Ann mocking him for it in "[[T.G.I.F.]]".

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Pink-Eye's pink eye finally clears up and instead sports a full mustache. He also seems to remember [[Gwen Mezzrow]], unlike [[Stewart Walldinger]].

===Personality===
Pink-Eye Pete is a very optimistic student. Despite his condition, he maintains a very positive attitude to the point that he might be oblivious as to how others view him. In addition, he might also be oblivious to the fact that his condition somewhat tampers with a more reasonable social life. Based on the fact that he still likes Pepper Ann, implies that he still thanks her for sending him to the nurse's office to get his hangnail removed. He has however somewhat accepted his condition as he took offense when Pepper Ann called him out on it, showing that he does have some pride in it.

===Physical appearance===
Pink-Eye Pete is a lanky Caucasian boy with short dirty blonde hair, a small white dot eye and, of course, his large, pink swollen eye. His ill-fitting clothes include a brown button up shirt with a pea green collar, dark green pants and brown shoes.

==Trivia==
*Pink-Eye tells Pepper Ann that his pink eye should clear up in "two weeks tops". The condition usually lasts 7 to 14 days, so technically he is correct. However, he ends up having it for much of his youth, implying that he probably keeps contracting it.
