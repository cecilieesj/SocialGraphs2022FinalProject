==Role in [[Darkwing Duck|the series]]==
Derek Blunt was the most legendary secret agent employed by S.H.U.S.H., star of sixteen major motion pictures (including ''[[wikipedia:Live and Let Die|Live and Let Spy]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Goldfinger|Goldfeather]]''), twenty-three novels, and an entire toy line. He was the only agent in the history of S.H.U.S.H. to capture the villainous [[Phineas Sharp]], and he prided himself on having done so without the use of any gadgets or gimmicks. When Sharp escaped from prison and stole the master list of S.H.U.S.H. agents, [[J. Gander Hooter]] called Blunt out of retirement and partnered him with [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]], much to the elder agent's disgust. Initially spiteful of one another (Blunt of Darkwing because of his overreliance on gadgets and Darkwing of Blunt because of his "phobia of modern technology"), the two eventually learned to get along after Darkwing saved them both from one of Sharp's deadly traps the Role of 007.

Blunt is mentioned in the comic story "[[Orange is the New Purple]]", in a scene where Darkwing shows Launchpad (actually a disguised [[Camille Chameleon]]) a crime-fighting manual that he has been working on; Darkwing says that he's hoping to get Blunt to write the foreword.

==Trivia==
*Blunt's name is a spoof of the [[James Coburn]] character [[wikipedia:Derek Flint|Derek Flint]], star of the spy parodies ''[[wikipedia:Our Man Flint|Our Man Flint]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:In Like Flint|In Like Flint]]'' as well as a reference to his personality, as he speaks his mind without any regard to how his opinions may offend or upset others.
*Much of the character seems to have been inspired by Ian Fleming, the creator of [[wikipedia:James Bond|James Bond]] (Fleming himself was never a secret agent, but worked for British Naval Intelligence during World War II).
