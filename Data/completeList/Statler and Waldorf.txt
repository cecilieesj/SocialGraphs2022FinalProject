==Background==
Statler and Waldorf share the [[Statler and Waldorf's Box|stage left balcony box]] in [[the Muppet Theater]], and the two delight in heckling every aspect of ''[[w:c:muppets:The Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]''. They usually have the last word, with a final comment at the end of most (but not all) episodes. Statler and Waldorf are especially unforgiving to [[Fozzie Bear]]. The pair do not consider themselves members of the Muppets despite their close association with them. However, it is revealed in ''[[w:c:muppets:A Muppet Family Christmas|A Muppet Family Christmas]]'' that the two critics were friends with Fozzie's mother, Ma Bear.
Waldorf is the one with the [[wikipedia:pug|pug]]-like face, mustache, and white hair. In almost all productions, Statler appears on the audience's right and Waldorf on the left.

==Appearances==
===''Muppets Tonight''===
In the first season, Statler and Waldorf are seen watching the show from the living room of what appears to be a retirement home. In the second season, they watch the show on a portable television from various locations, including a golf course and a ski lift.

===''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''===
Statler and Waldorf share a joint role of [[Jacob Marley]] by playing the ghosts of Scrooge's business partners, [[Jacob Marley|Jacob and Robert Marley]]. As in the story, they appear to [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] to warn Scrooge of his impending visits by three spirits. True to the characters playing them, they heckle at Scrooge's expense.

===''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''===
In the film, Statler and Waldorf are the mermaid figureheads of the Hispaniola, although fully sentient like the other characters. Near the end of the film, they have a rare heroic moment, saving Captain Smollett (Kermit) and Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy) when they fall off a cliff because, as Waldorf says, "it was too late to save the movie".

===''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''===
Statler and Waldorf appear as the [[Kalidah Critics]], strange beasts who shout insults at anyone attempting to cross a treacherous bridge. Their primary victim is, appropriately, Fozzie Bear playing the [[Cowardly Lion]].

===''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''===
The duo takes on a featured role in the film. In the beginning, they give the villain [[Tex Richman]] a tour of [[Muppet Studios]] and share with him the fine print of the Muppet contract. <br>{{Dialogue2|Statler|If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were reciting some sort of important plot point.|Waldorf|I hope so. Otherwise I would've bored half the audience half to death.|Statler|You mean half the audience is still alive?|attr=Statler and Waldorf after explaining the contract}}<br>Of course, Statler and Waldorf are unaware that Tex plans to raze Muppet Studios and drill for oil, which would mean the end of their balcony - and their heckling. The two eventually find out about Richman's true intentions and decide to help raise money by attending the telethon. When special guest [[Jack Black]] stated that he was "being held captive by these weirdos", Statler replied: "Now you know how we felt for the past 40 years".

When the studio fails to raise enough money, even Statler and Waldorf are saddened about this, since the other Muppets were still their friends, despite their heckling. However, when the Muppets realize their fans still love them and will help them get back on top even without their name, Statler and Waldorf are happy again (though they would be happier when [[Life's a Happy Song|everyone else wasn't singing]]). After Gonzo manages to make Richman laugh, he gives Statler and Waldorf back the theater and name.

===''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''===
The duo travel with the Muppets while watching their touring show. When watching [[Miss Piggy]]'s performance of the [[Macarena]], they claim it has made the show even worse, managing the impossible and causing them to applaud the show for the first time.

===[[Muppet Babies (2018 series)|''Muppet Babies'' (2018)]]===
Statler and Waldorf appear as the neighbors of Miss Nanny's daycare. While they are less antagonistic than they were in the ''The Muppet Show'', they do make occasional snide remarks towards the Muppet children.

==Trivia==

*Statler and Waldorf were named after two [[New York City]] hotels—the Statler Hotel (which was renamed the [[wikipedia:Hotel Pennsylvania|Hotel Pennsylvania]] in [[1992]]), and the [[wikipedia:Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Waldorf's wife, [[w:c:muppet:Astoria|Astoria]], completes the set.
*Early in ''[[W:c:muppet:The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years|The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years]]'', Statler claims Waldorf has had a pacemaker for over 30 years.
*The Waldorf puppet appeared as P. Fenton Cosgrove in the 1975 Muppet Meeting Films "''The Muppet Introduction''" and "''Just a Few Announcements''".
