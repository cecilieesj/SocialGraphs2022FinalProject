|partner=[[Seb Matthew-Smith]] (boyfriend)}}'''Carlos Rodriguez''' is one of the main characters in the [[Disney+]] Original Series ''[[High School Musical: The Musical: The Series]]''. He is [[Miss Jenn]]'s godson. He was a sophomore at [[East High School]] in Season 1 and Season 2. In Season 1, he was the Choreographer for [[East High School]]'s fall production of ''[[High School Musical]]''. In Act Two, he played [[Chad Danforth]] for a little bit in ''[[High School Musical]]''. In Season 2, he was the Co-Choreographer with [[Gina Porter]] and was casted as [[Lumiere]] in [[East High School]]'s spring production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.

==Background==
Carlos is the Captain of the color guard and the student choreographer of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. Beyoncé is his iPhone lockscreen wallpaper, and he already has his Tony Award for Best Choreography speech written out. Carlos thinks of the drama teacher as a peer — he eats lunch in her office, and has been drinking espresso since 3rd grade. All of this, even though Carlos still sleeps with a stuffed elephant, and is terrified of failure. His most-used app is Starbucks. Voted “Most likely to stage a flash mob on a field trip.”<ref name=":0">‘High School Musical’ TV Series Reveals Plot, Character Details (yahoo.com)</ref>

===Development===
Original Carlos name was going to be "Vikram."<ref name=":0" />

===Personality===
Carlos is bold and confident. He'll work as hard as necessary to achieve his dreams, even if times are hard. At the same time, though, Carlos is shown to doubt himself and to have trouble standing up to characters like EJ. In the first season, Carlos struggles to connect with his peers while juggling being both their choreographer and close to Miss Jenn. It's said he didn't have friends before the school's production of High School Musical: The Musical began, and this isolation is evident in the beginning of the series. However, by opening night of the musical, he appears to be close with many of his classmates and even has a boyfriend Seb Matthew-Smith.

===Physical appearance===
Carlos is an Mexican teenager with brown eyes, black hair and medium skin.
