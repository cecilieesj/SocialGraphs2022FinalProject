'''Anita''' is a supporting character in ''[[West Side Story]]''. She is the girlfriend of [[Bernardo Vasquez]] and adoptive sister figure of [[María Vasquez|María]] who displays a playful, yet stern attitude.

==Background==

===Personality===
Anita is a very playful and joyous woman who enjoys the life that she has, no matter how flawed it might be. Despite all the terrible and potential danger that surrounds her, she is confident enough in her abilities to get her through the day. She is dearly devoted to Bernardo and María and loves them unconditionally, even though the former has a habit of disregarding her concerns. However, she also displays sorrow and anger when things begin to crumble and fall apart around her.

==Trivia==
*Prior to [[Ariana DeBose]] portraying Anita, she was played by six actresses. When the original Broadway show opened back in [[1957]], Anita was portrayed by Chita Rivera who reprised the role when the show opened on the West End the year after. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, [[Rita Moreno]] portrayed her with her singing dubbed over by Betty Wand for the number "[[A Boy Like That]]". In the [[1980]] Broadway revival, she was played by Debbie Allen, Karen Olivo in the [[2009]] revival, and then by Yesenia Ayala in the [[2020]] revival.
**Moreno would go on to play [[Valentina (West Side Story)|Valentina]] in the [[2021]] film adaptation.
**Both DeBose and Moreno before her have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for the same role in the two film adaptations.
