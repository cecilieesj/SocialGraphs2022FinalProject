'''Feathers Galore''' was [[Dr. NoGood]]'s ex-minion and a beautiful woman who appeared in ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[Double-O-Duck]]". Her name is an homage of the James Bond character, Pussy Galore.

==DuckTales==
When Launchpad is told to look for someone called "Feathers" in New Delhi, he happens upon a night club. The emcee introduces the star of the show, Miss Feathers Galore. Feathers comes out on stage in belly dancer attire, and walks up to Launchpad, believing him to be [[Bruno Von Beak]]. She tells him to meet her upstairs in five minutes.

Five minutes later, Launchpad heads up to Room 407. He finds Feathers on the sofa, in a beautiful satin dress. Feathers tried to kill Launchpad using poisonous lipstick, but Launchpad managed to escape the hotel room.
