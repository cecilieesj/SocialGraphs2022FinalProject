'''Lady Octopus''' (real name '''Carolyn Trainer''') is a fictional supervillain in [[Marvel Comics]]. She appears in the [[2017]] ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series and in ''[[Spidey and his Amazing Friends]]'' under the name '''Doc Ock'''. 

Lady Octopus was created by J.M. DeMatteis, Angel Medina, Larry Mahlstedt and Randy Emberlin.

==Background==
===Powers and abilities===
*'''Tentacles:''' Lady Octopus wears a special harness, similar to the one used by the original [[Doctor Octopus]], which incorporates four strong and highly-resistant mechanical appendages, which can be extended or retracted at will. These "tentacles" can lift weights far greater than any human, be used as a means of transportation, and have superhumanly fast reaction time.
*'''Genius-Level Intellect:''' Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus possesses a genius-level intellect, and studied robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.

==Appearances==
===''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''===
Lady Octopus made her television debut in the 2017 Spider-Man series episode "Between an Ock and a Hard Place". This version has a Ph.D in electronics, which she used to fake her criminal record and have herself put in a cell next to [[Doctor Octopus]] in superhuman prison, the Cellar, where he manipulates her into obtaining crystals for a modified neuro cortex device for mind enhancement. After Spider-Man defeats her, she learns she had been manipulated and seeks revenge. To achieve this, she and Spider-Man fight Doc Ock and put her former idol into a coma. Following the fight, she relinquishes her tentacle harness and leaves.

===''[[Spidey and his Amazing Friends]]''===
Lady Octopus appears as one of the main antagonists in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series, ''Spidey and his Amazing Friends'', voiced by Kelly Ohanian. She is loosely based on the early adaption of the character from her comic book debut in the mid-90s. She uses her genius intellect and her mechanical tentacles to cause trouble. She occasionally shows up with a new invention to help her with her devious plans, only for them to be taken away by the Spiders.

Doc Ock is proud of her superior intelect and villainy, and tends to loudly brag about it, She is also overconfident in her diabolical schemes to become rich or takeover the city, and gets very annoyed when things don't go her way. However, she is shown to have a caring side, especially towards her small octobot assistant CAL. As seen in "[[CAT-astrophe]]", she was worried for him when he was being chased by a giant [[Bootsie]] (whom she accidently made big with her Octo-Sizer).

==Trivia==
*An alternate universe version of Lady Octopus appears in ''Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'', voiced by [[Kathryn Hahn]]. This version is a female variation of Otto Octavius named Dr. Olivia "Liv" Octavius. However, this is unassociated with Disney in any way, purely a Sony Pictures Animation project.
*Lady Octopus was first introduced in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995).
