'''Smitty''' is a minor antagonist of the [[1941]] Disney animated film, ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''.

===Physical appearance===
Smitty is a tall, slender young boy with buck teeth, freckles, and curly orange hair. He wears a blue jacket with red innards over a white and lime green striped long-sleeve shirt, blue pants with a red patch on the seat, and brown shoes. He also wears a beanie matching his shirt by colors.

=== Personality ===

==Appearances==
=== ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''===
Smitty is among the children attending the circus, as well as the leader of a young group of mischievous boys. When they see [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], they immediately begin laughing at him due to his abnormally large ears. Smitty first mocks the elephant by holding up his jacket in imitation of Dumbo's ears. While Dumbo thinks that Smitty is simply playing around, [[Mrs. Jumbo]] immediately realizes what’s going on and moves him out of the way of the bullies. Smitty then goes off limits by going over the safety ropes and entering the pen, dragging Dumbo from under her by his tail, and blowing in his ear much to Mrs. Jumbo's shock. After Dumbo tries to escape him, he grabs the other ear, stretches it, and lets it go, hitting Dumbo in the face. Having had enough of Smitty’s abuse, Mrs. Jumbo grabs the bully as he tries to escape and spanks him, she then throws a bale of hay to chase off the other bullying kids. 

As a result of not having seen the kids provoke the elephants, this causes a commotion among the circus staff, culminating in Mrs. Jumbo being locked up and separated from her son. Although Smitty is never seen again, it is possible that he got in trouble for his actions once the circus found out.

==Trivia==
*He is similar, both in looks and personality, to [[Lampwick]] from the 1940 film, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''.
*Smitty apparently re-appears in a book by Golden House books, taking place after the film, where he learns that it isn't right to bully others.
