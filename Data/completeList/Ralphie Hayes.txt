[[File:Screen_Shot_2012-07-17_at_4.23.42_PM.png|thumb]]'''Ralphie Hayes''' (a.k.a. The Dog Food Guy) is a minor character who appeared in the episode Kangaroos & Chaos. He was a teen actor on a commercial that was selling dog food. Many people have mistaken [[Austin Moon]] for him, because they look alike, except the dog food guy has an afro. For this reason Austin became concerned that he would be regarded as a has-been and rushed [[Ally Dawson|Ally]] into writing a new song for him. He is portrayed by [[Ross Lynch]].
