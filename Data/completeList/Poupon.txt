==Trivia==
*Like his brother, his name comes from a type of French mustard.
*Like Dijon in the episode [[Attack of the Metal Mites]], he mispronounces [[Flintheart Glomgold]]'s name.
*It's unknown if he is older or younger than his brother, though considering how much taller he is than Dijon, it's most likely the former. It's likely though that they're twins.
*According to some dialogue when Dijon and Poupon reunite, it's revealed that Poupon was always the moralistic brother while Dijon was always a thief ever since the two were kids.
