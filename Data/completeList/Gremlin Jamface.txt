'''Gremlin Jamface''' is a [[Gremlins|Gremlin]] from ''[[Gremlins|The Gremlins]]'' book. He later appeared in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two|Epic Mickey&nbsp;2: The Power of Two]]. ''In the game, he acts as the caretaker of the projectors, replacing Gremlin Markus from the first game. He is first encountered in [[Mean Street]] North, where he tasks [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] with finding scrap metal so that he can repair the windmill, allowing them to progress.

==Trivia==
*Gremlin Jamface originally intended to appear in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', but was scrapped early on in development. His only known appearance was in an unreleased gameplay prototype created for Game Informer #199, the issue that officially revealed ''Epic Mickey'' as its cover story. ​​​​​​
**Though he does not appear in the final game, his dialogue can still be found within the game's code. <ref>https://u.cubeupload.com/RampantLeaf/gidemoinfo.png</ref><ref>https://epicmickey.fandom.com/wiki/User:Oswaldiscool/Findings_Sandbox</ref>
**According to the leftover code, Gremlin Jamface was originally green.
*In the novel, he is one of only three Gremlins to be named.
*His official ''Epic Mickey 2'' profile states he invented the Projector Screens Network. This contradicts ''[[Epic Mickey: The Graphic Novel]]'', where [[Gremlin Gus]] states that [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] created them.
