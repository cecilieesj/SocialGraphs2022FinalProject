'''Jerry''' (credited as '''Floor''' '''Manager''') is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2001]] animated film, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' Jerry is the floor manager for [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]] He is a supervisor of Scare Floor F, where [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] and [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] work.

==Role in the film==
Jerry is the floor manager for [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]] He is a supervisor of Scare Floor F, where [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] and [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] work.

He first appears in a commercial for Monsters, Inc. that Mike and Sulley watch in their apartment room.

He counts down the amount of time left in seconds (he has 7 fingers on each hand) until it is time for the monsters to go into the human world to scare the children to harvest energy.

When [[George Sanderson]] exits a child's room with a sock attached to his back, [[Charlie Proctor|Charlie]] alerts to Jerry, who rushes over to activate the alarm that summons the [[CDA]].

When [[Celia Mae]] falsely announces [[Randall Boggs]] had just broken the all time scare record, Jerry and many other monsters excitedly surround Randall which gives Sulley and Mike time to call [[Boo|Boo's]] Door.

He is last seen near the entrance to the factory among the other monsters watching [[Henry J. Waternoose III|Waternoose]] get arrested by the CDA.

==Trivia==
*He has seven fingers on each hand, which explains why he starts the countdown at 7.
*He is briefly seen in ''[[Mike's New Car]]''; when the titular car is acting up due to Mike trying to find the right switch, Jerry sees this and runs away in fear.
