==Appearances==
===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===
The Bookworm appears only in the episode "[[Library Brouhaha]]". He appears as the main antagonist of the episode, when [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] arrives at the library which is run by [[Rita Book]], they want to eat The Bookworm whole, he hits Pumbaa with a mallet which makes him scream loudly in pain and they get kicked out by Rita. Then he manages to replace the pillows by horns in Timon and Pumbaa's feet and once more, they're caught by Rita.

After Timon and Pumbaa put earmuffs at Rita, they start chasing The Bookworm and even he manages to ask help to Rita who doesn't hear anything. Suddenly they're hit by a book and sucked in the world of books. After a long chase in that world and being brought back at the real world into the hospital, he is once again chased by Timon and Pumbaa, then Rita Book, now a nurse tells them to be quiet. Eventually, The Bookworm breaks the fourth wall giggling at the audience in the iris out and he is finally caught and obviously eaten by Timon and Pumbaa in halves. Due to this, the Bookworm didn't appear in another episode, due to being killed eaten by Timon and Pumbaa.
