'''Prince Rudolf''' is the main antagonist in the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode "[[Waiders of the Wost Tweasure]]".

==Role in the episode==
Rudolf is an impostor who claims to be the long-lost "cousin" of [[Princess Grace]]. He seeks to overthrow the kingdom while pretending that the lost prince has returned.

He claims to be second in line to the throne and challenges the princess' rights. He hides the map to the location of [[the Ruby Wings]] in a safe in the reading room, as whomever wore them would rule the kingdom.

When [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[Airplane Jane]] find out his secret, Rudolf tries to stop them by pursuing them in a heavily armed blimp, but Rudolf is defeated when Baloo tears a hole in the blimp's balloons with an anchor, upon which it crashes into the water.
