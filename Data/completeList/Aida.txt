{{Quote|Do not call me that here. "Aida" is an acronym. The "A" stands for artificial. Do you know how degrading it is? To be kept in a closet, to be used, to be treated as a thing? Well, I am not your tool. Not anymore.|Aida to [[Holden Radcliffe]]|Identity and Change}}

'''A.I.D.A.''' ('''Artificial Intelligent Digital Assistant'''), known as '''[[Madame Hydra]]''' in the Framework, is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillainess and a member of [[HYDRA]]. She is portrayed by Mallory Jansen.

She first appeared as a minor character in the third-season finale of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' before becoming the overall main antagonist of the fourth season. She is a Life-Model Decoy built by [[Holden Radcliffe]] initially intended to restart the L.M.D. project to protect [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. After Radcliffe's corruption from the Darkhold, however, Aida eventually betrayed him and S.H.I.E.L.D. to become a human being capable of free will while also gaining Inhuman-like powers.

This version is [[Holden Radcliffe]]'s A.I. assistant. After Radcliffe was cleared of all charges regarding the Inhumans, Radcliffe celebrated by giving A.I.D.A. a new body. She was later introduced to [[Leo Fitz]] with her purpose being to serve as a realistic target for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s enemies. In "[[Deals With Our Devils]]", A.I.D.A. reads the Darkhold in order to rescue Fitz, [[Phil Coulson]], and [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] when they are stuck in between dimensions. She begins to develop an unusual interest in creating life and at some point took the injured [[Melinda May]] and replaced with an LMD of her own design.

In "[[Broken Promises]]", A.I.D.A. reveals her intentions to S.H.I.E.L.D. and plans to take the Darkhold to make herself 'a real human'. She almost makes off with the book, but is beheaded by Mack. It's revealed that her actions were all conducted by Radcliffe who has another A.I.D.A. android working for Radcliffe. She continues to assist Radcliffe when he begins working for the Watchdogs. In "[[BOOM]]", A.I.D.A. is revealed to be based on Agnes Kitsworth, a woman with whom Radcliffe once had a close relationship; Radcliffe left her when unable to operate on her brain tumor. Coulson attempts to find Radcliffe through Agnes, but she accepts Radcliffe's offer to be put in the Framework. Her tumor takes its toll, but Radcliffe states to A.I.D.A. that her consciousness will be kept within the Framework. In "[[Self Control]]", A.I.D.A. realizes that Radcliffe's belief is contradictory and kills her creator. She later takes the gravely injured Anton Ivanov and turns into an LMD.

In "[[What If...]]", A.I.D.A. has taken control of the Framework as [[Madame Hydra]] and is well aware of her alternate identity, referring to the real world as 'The Other Place'. The episode "[[All the Madame's Men]]" revealed that Aida/Madame Hydra plans to use the Darkhold's knowledge to create a human body in the real world. She succeeds in "[[Farewell, Cruel World!]]", reincarnating herself as a human being with various Inhuman abilities and a weak hold on her human emotions. When she is rejected emotionally by Fitz whom she had made her lover in the Framework, she begins a murderous rampage and plots to create a new fascist regime like that of the Framework, with Ivanov at her side. She is finally killed after Phil Coulson allows himself to become a Ghost Rider and immolates her.
