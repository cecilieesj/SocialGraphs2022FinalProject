'''Foxy Loxy''' is a major antagonist of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[2005]] animated feature film ''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''.

==Background==
Foxy and her best friend [[Goosey Loosey]] bully [[Chicken Little]] and his friends throughout the movie. She and Goosey Loosey seem to love tormenting students.

It is worth nothing that they are only shown being mean to Chicken Little, [[Runt of the Litter]] (who has a crush on her despite this), [[Abby Mallard]], and possibly [[Fish Out of Water (Chicken Little)|Fish Out of Water]]. The two don't actually appear to hate them or wish them dead.

Foxy Loxy is the class monitor and baseball star at Oakey Oaks and believes that only three things are important enough to care about: being popular, being famous, and having good hair (according to the official site). Although she often seems cruel, she actually shows some signs of kindness like when she tells [[Buck Cluck]] that no one blames him after it looks like Chicken Little lied about seeing a UFO.

==Appearances==
===''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''===
Foxy and her friend are first seen during "[[One Little Slip]]" where she and [[Goosey Loosey]] pelt acorns on [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]] while trying to catch up with the bus. She later appears where she is marked present during [[Mr. Woolensworth]]'s class and later during a game of dodgeball. Little, however, stands up against Foxy and her companion Goosey who bully him and cause him to be launched to a window, causing him to accidentally activate a fire alarm and put himself in trouble.

When Chicken Little signs up during a game of baseball, Foxy constantly keeps winning countlessly until after Little trains hard, he successfully wins against Foxy, causing Little to be proud of himself. Later on, when Chicken Little discovers an unusual UFO on Earth even though he saw it and tells the citizens whom they don't believe in him, Foxy tells Little's father Buck Cluck that no one blames him just as the citizens leave. When the aliens invade Oakey Oaks the next day, Foxy and Goosey attack an alien robot and are beamed into their capture chamber, where Chicken Little and Buck Cluck find her apparently so scared she is sucking her thumb and clutching her tail like a blanket after being captured by the aliens.

An error in reconstitution results in her personality being altered into a far sweeter and more gentle one when her brainwaves are slightly scrambled after she was restored (the aliens offer to turn her back to normal, but she and Runt seem to like herself better that way, so they refuse, and she is left that way). Foxy seems to be fully aware that she has had her mind altered and still seems to remember everything but does not want to go back. Later on, Foxy seems to have become Runt's girlfriend and is last seen dancing with Runt during the end credits, once again accompanied by her friend Goosey Loosey.

==Printed material==
A Disney comic called 'What a Scoop' reveals that she and Goosey Loosey still play with dolls.
