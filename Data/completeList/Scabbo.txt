[[File:Scabbo.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Scabbo''' is a member of the [[Goth Fish]] group in the series ''[[Fish Hooks]]''. His name was revealed in the episode, "[[The Dark Side of the Fish]]".

==Personality==
Scabbo does not smile at all, as this is shown in the school picture day. The Photographer told Scabbo to smile, but he didn't obey him. Then the photographer replied, "Good, good" and got his picture taken quickly ("[[Bea Stays in the Picture]]").

==Personal life==
When [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] joined the Goth Fish group, he had to go through an initiation, and when Razor told him to throw the things that represents his happiness into the pit, Scabbo and [[Bleak Molly]] started moaning, mysteriously ("The Dark Side of the Fish").

==Physical appearance==
He is dark, like the other Goth Fish, and wears a shirt with a fish skeleton on it.
