==Role in the film==
One day, James met the stray dog Winston on the other end of a French fry. The film follows their growing friendship over a 12-year span based on the meals (some accidentally spilled) they eat â€” all seen from Winston's point of view. But one day, a woman named Kirby enters James' life. 

Kirby tried to help him and Winston adopt a healthier lifestyle. While James accepted the change, Winston was less than receptive. This continued until Kirby broke up with James. Heartbroken, he sought comfort in junk food which initially delighted Winston.

Over the course of time however, Winston notices how depressed James was without Kirby. Against James' wishes, Winston runs to the steakhouse where Kirby worked to get James to chase after him. James ran after Winston and was about to take him home when Kirby reconciled with him and eventually married him, having a son and a daughter.
