He is the crush of [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Hansel is friendly and has a strong Norwegian accent. Blue-eyed and dreamy, Hansel is always leaving Dolly feeling tongue-tied. Flirtatious, cool and popular, Hansel is blissfully unaware that he is Dolly's crush.

He also shares a love of the arts with his poetry buddy Dylan (though he is a bit of a hipster, commenting on how he finds hip-hop too mainstream and finds chasing cats to be so cliche) and enjoys getting into character in the role-playing board game Poodlewolf.

He has also been seen to practice yoga with the feline, [[Constantin]].

===Physical appearance===
Hansel is a black-and-white husky with light blue eyes with a bluish-gray collar that has a tooth-shaped dog tag.

==Role in the series==
Hansel first made a small appearance as a part of the chain of the World Wide Woof to relay [[Dylan]]'s message to his sister Dolly asking how she was doing taking care of their younger siblings on her own in "[[Walkies on the Wild Side]]".

He made his first official speaking appearance in "[[May Contain Nuts]]", observing Delgado and Dolly doing stunts at the skate park with the Dalmatian family and several other dogs.

In "[[Winter Funderland]]", Hansel comes to Dolly's snow party, commenting on how all the snow reminds him of home, implying that he was born in another country before moving to [[London]]. He is seen with giving the other Dalmatians sleigh rides about the house. Soon, when things become too cold, he helps Dylan bring the backup power generator to the heater.

In "[[Poetry Scam]]", Hansel is interested in Dylan's poem which Dolly recited in a panic in an attempt to impress him. He ends up inviting Dolly to a poetry performance later that night. In the end of the episode, he is seen walking off with Dylan, speaking more about poetry.

In "[[Girls' Day Out (101 Dalmatian Street)|Girls' Day Out]]", Hansel is at the animal spa, practicing yoga with Constantin. Dolly accidentally trips over Hansel, who then tries to remember her name.

He is seen as one of the contestants for the tenth annual Nose Off in "[[The Nose Job]]", where is able to get the scent of pepper in the first round, but later mistakes the scent of a walnut for the scent of almond. He is later seen when Dylan tries to send a message about saving [[Diesel]] on the "World Wide Woof"; however, the signal gets messed up by the time it gets to him, and he thinks the message is about shaving a weasel, and then about scratching evil, when Dylan tries using the "World Wide Woof" again later in the episode.

In "[[Don't Push Your Luck]]", he is one of Dolly's rivals in a skateboarding competition. When Dolly forfeits the competition to get rid of [[Big Fee]], Hansel becomes the winner.

Hansel appears in "[[Poodlewolf]]", when he arrives at the house to pick up Dylan for a poetry slam. Dolly, however, wanting to spend time with Hansel, raises Dylan's game timer and tells Hansel that Dylan asked her to go with Hansel instead. Throughout the episode, Dolly tries to avoid Hansel seeing her with Dylan, whose extended game time has caused him to have his mind trapped in the game. During the climatic battle with Lord Furball (played by Constantin), Dolly initially hesitates to show herself because Hansel is watching, but ultimately helps Dylan, which restores his mind to normal. Dolly then tries to explain to Hansel, but Hansel tells Dolly that he is actually a fan of "Poodlewolf", too!

In; "[[The Longest Night]]", Hansel invites both Dylan & Fergus to spend the night in the park with him, for the titular "Longest Night", a Nordic tradition where male Huskies get back to nature. When Dolly offers to come with them, Hansel explains it is for "Alpha Males only" (also recalling a time where he once let Big-Fee join, which resulted in his tail being used as a tissue), angering Dolly, Roxy & Snowball. Later that night, Dylan has brought Dawkins along and Diesel asks to join too. Hansel takes down the tent Dylan set up, since they're supposed to be roughing it, and together the group stargaze, tell campfire stories, howl like wolves and attempt to hunt using a kibble bag built to resemble an elk (though only Diesel is successful at getting to it). Later that night, Dolly, Roxy & Snowball, angered by the misogynistic attitude of the "Longest Night", set up a prank to scare the group, based on the Ice Troll story that Hansel told. Soon, when Diesel is "abducted", the male group search for him, before coming face to face with the Ice Troll (actually a puppet built using trash bags). Dylan is the only one to face it, because Diesel is in trouble, while Hansel cowers with the others. Dolly, Roxy & Snowball reveal themselves. They are impressed with Dylan's bravery, but mock Hansel's cowardice. Hansel then admits to the group that he actually hates the entire "Alpha Male" thing, but felt pressured to do so cause he comes from a long line of macho huskies, while he himself prefers being a poet. Dolly, Roxy, Snowball & Big Fee are then welcomed to join the "Longest Night", with the group howling again.

In "[[Poodlefall!]]", Hansel joins Dylan & Dawkins in a game of "Poodlewolf", which also makes Dolly join so she can be with Hansel. Dolly's actions, however, lead to Dylan's player character getting killed. When everyone holds a funeral for the character, Dolly initially scoffs since it is just a toy, but Hansel confronts her over this, explaining how important Dylan's character is to him, convincing Dolly to try and resurrect Dylan's character. Hansel then joins in help Dolly & Dawkins in completing the quest to allow them to resurrect Dylan's character, also helping Dolly get in to the character of the game.

In; "[[Dotty Dancing]]", Dylan goes to Hansel to teach him some dance moves, but when Dylan seems unable to learn the "Husky Hustle", Hansel suggests Dylan stick by him in a "Coolness By Association" type way...though he advises Dylan keep some distance, since the opposite may apply too.

==Notes==
*According to the show creators, while Dolly may have a crush on Hansel, Hansel himself is actually interested in her brother, Dylan, hinting that Hansel maybe homosexual or bisexual.
** Hansel appeared along with Dolly, Da Vinci, Deepak and the Dimitri Trio on a Pride Month image uploaded by series director Miklos Weigert in 2021, suggesting that Hansel is indeed LGBTQ.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/MikWeigert/status/1400543326579867651|title= Dalmatian Pride|date= December 23, 2021}}</ref>
