'''Bobo''' is a spirit monkey who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. He is a non-spirit guide [[chanul]] who hopes to become a spirit guide but tends to give terrible advice to humans.

==Role in the series==
Bobo was kicked out of Spirit Guide school for poor judgment. He went to the Màzico stalks to steal one but was caught by [[Cacahuate]]. Bobo used the Màzico to tie up Cacahuate and then took his stripes so he could not follow him. He went to [[Avalor]] to help humans where he met [[Elena Flores|Elena]] and [[Mateo]]. Mateo wanted to meet his spirit guide so Bobo thought he could send him to the [[Spirit World]] to meet him. He used his Màzico to send Mateo away and left to help more humans. At the castle, he went around giving people bad advice and ended up making trouble. To stop his hazardous activities, Zuzo and a few other spirit guides enter the castle to apprehend Bobo, leading to a chase around the castle.

Eventually, Zuzo and the spirits corner Bobo; at that moment, Elena, Mateo, and Cacahuate return from the Spirit World giving Bobo the opportunity to escape. However, Elena uses the [[Scepter of Light]] to catch Bobo with [[Chancellor Esteban]] in the library. She uses the scepter to blast Bobo with a blazing spell away from Esteban, causing him to release the Màzico back as the other Spirit Animals surround Bobo. Bobo realizes the trouble he's caused for the humans and admits that he is not cut out to be a spirit guide. However, Elena offers Bobo to become King of the Zanies, which Bobo eagerly accepts. Back in the Spirit World, Zuzo gets Bobo acquainted with the Zanies who accept Bobo as their king. Together, Bobo leads the Zanies through the Shadow Tunnels to meet the Shadow Spirits.
