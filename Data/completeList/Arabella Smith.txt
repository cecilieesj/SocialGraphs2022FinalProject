'''Arabella Smith''' is a character from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' franchise.

==History==
Arabella Smith was born and raised on the island of [[Tortuga]] in the [[Caribbean|Caribbean Sea]]. Her father was the alcoholic keeper of a tavern known as the Lucky Bride and her mother Laura Smith was an infamous pirate captain who was supposedly killed by the pirate  Left-Foot Louis. While working as a barmaid in the Lucky Bride as a 15 year old, she befriended a young [[Jack Sparrow]], who she left Tortuga with in search of the legendary ''Sword of Cortez''.

Arabella became a trusted crew-mate of Jack Sparrow during his youth, having even served as first-mate of his vessel ''The Barnacle''. Arabella went on many adventures with the young Sparrow and became romantically involved with fellow crew-mate [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Willian "Bootstrap Bill" Turner]]. She also eventually discovered that her mother Laura was alive and had simply abandoned her alcoholic husband and the port of Tortuga. Following this, Arabella left Jack's crew and served aboard her mother's vessel ''La Fleur de la Mort''.

In adulthood, Arabella became a successful pirate captain in her own right. She eventually returned to Tortuga where she took ownership of the Lucky Bride and transformed it into, "The Tortuga Tavern" to serve her fellow buccaneers. At some point she married and had a child who went on to become well versed in the family business of piracy as was documented by the [[East India Trading Company]].
