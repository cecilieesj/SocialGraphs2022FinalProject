==Appearances==
===Marvel Animated Universe===
====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
Mysterio appears in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' episode the "Moon Knight Before Christmas" voiced by Paul Scheer. Quentin Beck is portrayed as an old half enemy of Spider-Man and former stage magician who is presumed dead (fake) after an encounter with Spider-Man when he fell off the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man dove into the river and only found Mysterio's helmet at the bottom of the river while his body is nowhere to be found. Since that incident, Spider-Man gave his helmet to Doctor Strange for safekeeping at the Sanctorum. Following his death, his daughter Frances Beck (voiced by Mary Kate Wiles) uses his helmet in an attempt to exact revenge on Spider-Man as a female Mysterio only to discover that Quentin Beck's soul is trapped within the helmet. Recalling [[Doctor Strange]]'s saying "The Enemy of the Enemy" is my friend, Spider-Man casts the spell that would enable Frances' pursuer [[Moon Knight]] to enter when it comes to Mysterio summoning evil elves, giant gingerbread men, snow monsters created from snowmen, and animated toys. Using a specific wand that the Moon told him to wield, he stabs the helmet with the wand. Spider-Man pretends to follow the Moon by telling Moon Knight to free Frances from the helmet's control. After ending up inside the helmet where he sees Quentin in the helmet as a result of a deal with [[Dormammu]]. As Quentin states that his soul is lost, Spider-Man persuades Quentin not to give up. As a result, Quentin Beck, Frances Beck, and Spider-Man return to reality. Quentin and Frances later attend a dinner with [[Aunt May]] alongside Spider-Man and Moon Knight.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
====''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''====
Mysterio is the main antagonist of ''Spider-Man: Far From Home''. A former Stark Industries employee, Quentin Beck was the inventor of B.A.R.F., a holographic system that made use of illusions. However, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] fired Beck for being unstable. After Stark's sacrifice to beat [[Thanos]] during the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Beck took it upon himself to seek revenge on Stark's legacy.

With the help of a team of former Stark employees, Beck creates four cybernetic monsters known as [[the Elementals]] and takes on the identity of a tragic warrior from Earth-833, an alternate Earth that was ravaged by the Elementals. He unleashes the Elementals upon the world, pretending to defeat them to gain public approval. He first "defeats" [[Sandman]] in Mexico, getting the attention of "[[Talos|Nick Fury]]," and Cyclone in Morocco.

In Venice, Beck first encounters [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] while defeating [[Hydro-Man]]. Beck later officially meets Parker on a secret mission, explaining his fabricated story, and attempts to recruit Parker to "defeat" [[Molten Man]]. Though Parker refuses, Fury sends Parker and his school to Prague, where Molten Man resides. After a brief bonding moment, Spider-Man helps Beck "defeat" Molten Man, and passes on Stark's sunglasses to Beck, believing he deserves it. Unknown to Parker, Beck has been seeking control of Stark's legacy. Parker eventually realizes that Beck has been deceiving him, and goes to warn "Fury" of Beck in Berlin. But "Fury" turns out to be an illusion of Beck's, and Beck traps Parker in a series of illusions before making a getaway.

Beck, having learned of Parker's classmates who were in on his secret, discretely sends them to London, where he plans on using an illusion of the fused Elementals to kill them. But Spider-Man, having broken free, intercepts Beck and eventually subdues him. In a last-ditch effort to kill Peter, Beck orders his drones to shoot him. Peter kicks the drones back, causing a stray bullet to hit Beck, mortally wounding him. Shortly before his death, he tries to shoot Peter in the head after distracting him with another illusion. As he dies, Beck orders his associates to download footage from the drones and alter the footage to frame Spider-Man for the attacks, after which he exposes Spider-Man's secret identity to the world.

====''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''====
Mysterio is mentioned at the start of the film when Peter is dealing with Mysterio outing his identity as Spider-Man and for being framed for the death of the villain.
