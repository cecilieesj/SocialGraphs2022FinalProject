'''Ray-Gon''' is a character featured in the [[2014]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated special, ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''. He is an anthropomorphic Scelidosaurus serving as an armorer for the [[Battlesaurs]], providing armor for them to help them get ready for battle.

==Background==
As an armorer, Ray-Gon is capable of providing the best battle armor for the Battlesaurs, showing a gentle personality towards Battlesaurs, unlike other Battlesaurs who have a fierce personality. Besides his duty in providing armor for the Battlesaurs, he is also seen serving the Cleric during the battle at the Arena of Woe. However, ever since Reptillus reformed after getting used to playtime, it is likely that Ray-Gon got used to playtime after Reptillus was used during playtime by Mason and Bonnie.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''===
When [[the Cleric]] encounters [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], [[Rex]], and [[Trixie]] at Battleopolis, he finds Rex and Trixie without armor as unusual dinosaurs to which he sends the two to the armory where  Ray-Gon is seen preparing armor for a Brute to which he readies him for battle. As [[Reptillus Maximus]] introduces Trixie to Ray-Gon who finds Trixie a unique dinosaur amongst the Battlesaurs. Ray-Gon, controlling a pair of mechanical arms, shows Trixie a room full of battle accessories where Ray-Gon gives Trixie a battle outfit, followed by Rex who asks Ray-Gon to make him ready for battle, which is a pair of mechanical arms just before Reptillus shows Trixie the landscape of Battleopolis around them. He then briefly appears during the "Battlesaurs Theme Song" sequence where he pops out with the other Battlesaurs just before they celebrate after singing their theme song.

At the Arena of Woe, Ray-Gon and two Brutes are seen bringing the Goliathon to the arena as commanded by the Cleric. There, Ray-Gon uses his hammer to tap the button on the Goliathon, which ferociously roars and enters the arena. However, after Trixie was unable to hit the Goliathon's button to release Woody and Buzz inside the Goliathon due to the Goliathon blocking her attack, the Cleric and the other Battlesaurs see Bonnie's name on Trixie's foot which the Cleric considers it the mark of obedience to which the Cleric summons Ray-Gon to give him a control for the Supplicator which controls Rex who has mechanical arms.

Later during playtime with [[Mason]] and [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]], Ray-Gon freezes with the other toys at the playroom. There, he is seen placed on the Goliathon who races with a dinosaur skeleton used by Mason. Ray-Gonnis not seen again after that, though it is likely that he got used to playtime after Reptillus was used during playtime by Mason and Bonnie.

===Other appearances===
Ray-Gon also appears briefly in the fake opening of the ''Battlesaurs'' "cartoon" which is found as a bonus feature in the [[2015]] Blu-ray releases of ''Toy Story That Time Forgot''. In it, he is seen giving Reptillus some armor.

==Trivia==
*Originally, Ray-Gon was originally going to be redundant with his screen time being limited to being a background character but for the final cut, it was decided that Ray-Gon would be given a great way to integrate him in the TV special to support Trixie's plot, considering of how important he was throughout the animated special's plot, making him a supporting character in ''Toy Story That Time Forgot''<ref>''Toy Story That Time Forgot'' Audio Commentary (Blu-ray Disc; 2015).</ref>
