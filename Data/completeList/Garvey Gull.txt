|quote = }}'''Garvey Gull''' is a comic book character in [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]] comics. Garvey is a mischievous, homeless orphan friend of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. Donald doesn't think much of him. The character was designed by artist Daniel Branca. Garvey's arch-enemey is a rat-faced railway security guard who views Garvey as an outlaw and wants to drive him off the railway where he works.

In Europe, Garvey's (British) English name is Sonny Seagull. Garvey is his name for American media.
