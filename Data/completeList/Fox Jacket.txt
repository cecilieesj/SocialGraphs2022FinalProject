The '''Fox Jacket''' is a talking piece of trendy apparel in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[[Slave to Fashion]]". He was puppeteered by [[Allan Trautman]] and voiced by [[Tim Curry]].

Purchased by [[Charlene Sinclair]] (with financial assistance from [[Mindy (Dinosaurs)|Mindy]]), the jacket is part of a clothing line which literally says "I'm better than you." The newly acquired status symbol, which speaks with a snooty British accent, begins encouraging Charlene to reject her old friends, steal [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl's]] credit card and in general inveigles Charlene into a near Faustian bargain in exchange for temporary popularity.

The fickle jacket eventually wearies of Charlene and attaches itself to the more likeminded [[Heather Worthington]].
