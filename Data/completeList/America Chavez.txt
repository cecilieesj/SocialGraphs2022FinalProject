==Background==
America Chavez is a young girl from outside of our Multiverse – specifically, the Utopian Parallel, a singular dimension unlike anything we’ve ever known. America is being hunted for her power – the ability to open star-shaped holes in reality, allowing her to travel through the Multiverse and into other realities. 

America opened her first portal as a child and has spent years traveling through the Multiverse since she first fell into a universe that bears a resemblance to ours. During her accidental travels, she’s traveled across 72 universes, on a journey to find control over her powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/xochitl-gomez-america-chavez-mcu-doctor-strange-multiverse-of-madness-interview|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Xochitl Gomez on Embodying America Chavez and Journeying into the Marvel Cinematic Universe|website=Marvel|date=[[April 27]], [[2022]]}}</ref>
