==Biography==

===='''Early Years'''====
Jan ran the sports shop when he was younger with his brother Hans, when Gordon Bombay got older, he worked for Jan and was paid a minimum salary. Jan left back to Scandinavia to let Hans run the shop while he took care of their mother.

===='''D2: The Mighty Ducks'''====
In D2, Jan picked up Bombay from the bus station when he came back to Minnesota. He let Bombay know that Hans had switched places with Jan to see their mother in Scandinavia. The next day, Jan contacted the Junior Goodwill Games committee and told them that Gordon would be interested in coaching a team under their company. When Gordon woke up he served him and Charlie Hasenpeffer and eggs for breakfast.

When Don Tibbles came to talk to Bombay about coaching under Hendricks. Jan encouraged Gordon to round up the Mighty Ducks and leave to the Goodwill Games in LA.

Jan, later on witnessed Gordon yelling at Team USA with his “Icelandic” hairdo on the TV. Which Jan described as he looked like he just “came out of the shower”. Jan closed the shop temporarily for the first time in years and traveled to Los Angeles to reinvigorate Gordon’s waning spirit in team USA. He let Bombay know that he only told the committee that he was a man who loved to play, and not one who would win at all cost. He also said that Gordon was the "Minnesota Miracle Man".

After encouraging Gordon to “be that man”. Jan then assisted Bombay in coaching Team USA, for the final game against Iceland, and even provided the team with brand-new ducks jerseys. Which the Ducks used at the final game and used in D3: The Mighty Ducks.

===='''Later Years'''====
Jan went on to open up a skating rink known as the Ice Palace. When he died he bequeathed the Ice Palace to Gordon Bombay in his will. Bombay is now the current owner and manager, although he admits that the skating rink saw better days under Jan's oversight.

==Legacy==
Jan designed the next logo of the Mighty Ducks, which would become the most popular logo, used to instantly recognize the Ducks. His passing would also have a big effect on Gordon's life as he keeps the Ice Palace open after Jan's passing.
