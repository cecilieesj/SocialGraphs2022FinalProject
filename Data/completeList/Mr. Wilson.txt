During school hours, Mr. Wilson calls [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] over the intercom, jokingly stating she's in trouble, before quickly clarifying he just wants to talk.

She enters his office, and he tells her he understand the past couple of hectic weeks shes had, regarding her behavior in class. He reveals her teachers have reported her lack of focus in class, when Kamala begins to zone out of their conversation. He quickly snaps at her to pay attention, having only started the meeting thirty seconds again, and asks for her cooperation. She apologises, referring to him as "Mr Wilson", and he tries approaching her in a relatable manner, by referring to himself as Gabe, as Mr. Wilson was his father's name, though the latter also happened to share the same first name too. He moves the conversation back to Kamala's academics, and discusses the importance in thinking of the future, in regards to college admissions, SATs, essays and applications. He questions whether she volunteers, as it can help with applications, but clarifies, she should do it to help people, even though it be useful. Upon seeing Kamala's daunted face, he assures her that he isn't trying to scare her, and she questions if she has to figure out her whole future before lunch. Before the meeting ends, he gives her the task to look at herself in the mirror and ask herself, "[[Reflection|who is the girl I see, staring straight back at me]]". Kamala points out he's reciting lyrics from ''[[Mulan]]'', which he confirms. He concludes his point by stating that as of now, Kamala seems divided, unsure of where she is, and while fantasy may be fun, she needs to pull herself together, and join reality.

He later calls in [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]], and informs him that he's been accepted into the Early Immersion program at CalTech, where he'd be attending next semester, with a scholarship included. Bruno is at a loss for words, and Mr. Wilson encourages him to accept the offer. He uses ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''The Devil Wears Prada'' as an analogy for Bruno's offer, comparing him to the protagonists of the films, who have also been given life-altering offers, and urges him to accept.

After the masked superheroine Night Light evades capture by the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]] and saves a group of onlookers, her recorded actions go viral. Mr. Wilson records a tiktok of himself, where he praises her, and tells his audience he is shaking at her heroics.

==Trivia==
*Mr. Wilson's initials and surname are a reference to ''Ms. Marvel'' comic creator, G. Willow Wilson.
