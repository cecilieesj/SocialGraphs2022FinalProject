[[File:Char_61135.jpg|thumb]]'''Shelly Klutzberry''' (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) is Shelton's older sister who hasÂ fewer appearances than her brother. She resembles her brother, but doesn't change appearance when her glasses are taken off. In "[[Late Night with Todd & Riley]]", she is first mentioned as Shelton's sister and also we learn she loves [[Dustin Dreamlake]]. Though never mentioned, she has presumably already had her bar mitzvah.
