{{Quote|[[Penny Proud|You]] don't know how I feel, how it hurts when people laugh at you, make you feel different, like you're a freak of nature. You don't know how it feels to go home and cry because people who you thought were your friends really aren't. You don't know how it feels to be ridiculed because you're you. Well, I'll tell you, Tookie. If being a sissy means you're a good student, a sensational designer, a fabulous basketball player, who schooled you on the court, and a loyal, caring friend then I'm cool with it, 'cause that's who I am.|Micheal Collins to Tookie and Penny|Who You Callin' a Sissy}}
