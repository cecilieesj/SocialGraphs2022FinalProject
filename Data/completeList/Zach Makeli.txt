}}'''Zach Makeli''' is a cowboy in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. He is a five-time rodeo champion of the [[Kokaua Town]] fair.

==Role in the series==
Zach appeared in "[[Sprout (episode)|Sprout]]" as [[Stitch]]'s opponent in the rodeo. He is shown to be stern and firm with pride in his streak of bull riding and is not intended to lose the sixth time to Stitch.

During the competition, Zach manages to win the rodeo with a high score to prove it. However, when Stitch shows off his incredible skills, Zach glares at him. When it then looked like Stitch was going to win, Experiment 509 ([[Sprout]]) erupted and started running rampant. When Stitch makes his way towards the real Sprout, Zach helps him by giving him a lasso, showing a side of compassion.

In the end, Zach gives Stitch the championship cowboy belt, saying that a real cowboy either wins fair and square or he loses fair and square, showing Zach his belief in honor and fairness.
