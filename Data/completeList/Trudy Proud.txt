'''Dr. Gertrude "Trudy" Parker-Proud''' is one of the main characters of ''[[The Proud Family]]''.

==Role in the series==
Trudy is the beautiful, intelligent, and kind veterinarian mother of [[Penny Proud|Penny]], [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|BeBe and CeCe]]. She comes from a relatively wealthy and very brainy family, with her father, [[Dr. Vincent Parker|Vincent Parker]] also being a doctor, and her sister, [[Diana Parker|Diana]] being a famous actress. She married [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] after he won the [[1977]] Spelling Bee Championship because she felt that he was worth it. She was also a debutante like her daughter, Penny.

Trudy is often caring for her children as well. Since Trudy makes more money than Oscar, she asserts dominance over him at times and often goes into a rage when he does not do what she wants. Although she always catches Oscar with other women, she never seems to even consider divorcing him. She does have a mean spirited side, as she openly talks and jokes about cheating on Oscar, and flirts with other men in front of him without caring at all. However, she would never even think of doing it. Also, when she is diagnosing [[Mariah Carey]]'s monkey, she hides the fact that her last name is Proud (calling herself "Dr. Trudy"), since the monkey got sick from eating Proud Snax and she doesn't want to get shunned for being married to Oscar.

Trudy gives good advice and is often the voice of reason for Penny and Oscar. However, she does not appreciate Oscar acting like a jerk or Penny misbehaving. She can also be a bit possessive of her kids when she and Oscar argue and usually refers to the kids as "hers" and sometimes threatens Oscar when he corrects her. 

Her best friend is [[Sunset Boulevardez]], because they share a few things in common: They are both strict mothers and wives with teenage daughters, they do not like it when their husbands act dumb and idiotic and they do not like their husbands flirting with other women even though they do the same thing with attractive men. 

==Relationships==
*[[Oscar Proud]] - Trudy's husband. She is aware of Oscar's constant flirting with other women and understandably hates it. Despite this, she does tolerate him and it's clear the two still love each other. They are both caring parents and they do work together to raise their kids.
*[[Penny Proud]] - Trudy's oldest daughter. Out of the two parents, Trudy does a much better job at reaching out to Penny, understanding her, and giving her the advice that she needs.
*[[Suga Mama]] - Trudy's mother-in-law. While there have been a few moments where Suga Mama drives Trudy crazy, the two of them get along very well. They have a pretty healthy mother/daughter-in-law relationship. Suga Mama gets along much better with Trudy than her own son, Oscar..
*[[Bobby Proud]] - Trudy's brother-in-law.  There will be a few moments where Bobby understandably annoys Trudy (particularly in the episode "Tiger Whisperer") but other than that, they still treat each other like family. They also seem to be very accepting of each other as family members as they often introduce and refer to each other as their "brother/sister-in-law" without any hesitation. They seem to get along even better in ''Louder and Prouder'' as Bobby helped made some helpful modifications to Trudy's new company car.
*[[BeBe & CeCe Proud]] - Trudy's baby twins. She is clearly affectionate and loving towards them the way a mother should be. She is often see with them.

==Trivia==
*Trudy's one of only seven characters to have appeared in every single episode of the series, the other six are:
**Oscar, Trudy's husband.
**Penny, Trudy's older daughter.
**CeCe, Trudy's younger daughter.
**Bebe, Trudy's son.
**Suga Mama, Oscar's mother and Trudy's mother-in-law.
**Dijonay, Penny's best friend.
*Trudy and Sunset do have a habit of flirting with attractive men, similar to how their husbands do it with other women. The difference is they don't do it nearly as often and they usually do it to teach them a lesson.
*Trudy gets mad at Oscar for flirting with other woman, unaware it's partly her fault for being so bossy that it irritated him into doing it.
*Her maiden name is the same as her actress' last name, Paula Jai Parker.
