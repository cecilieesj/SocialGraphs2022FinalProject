On the night of [[July 4]], [[1986]], Larry is listening to music in the study, which is situated on the second floor of his house. Suddenly, a [[David Freeman|12-year-old boy]] he has never seen before bursts in.

A concerned Larry asks the boy if he can help him, but he seems to be in a confused state and rushes out of the study. Larry follows him, assuring him that no one will hurt him and asks for his name and address. He then bursts into tears, asking for his parents. Larry then tells Janet to call the police, who come to escort the distressed boy to the station.
