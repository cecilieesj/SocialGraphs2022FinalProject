==Appearances==
===''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''===
After Melody hears a mother penguin yelling for someone to save [[Baby Penguin|her baby]] in the danger of being eaten by a hammerhead shark, a group of penguins arrives to rescue her before she gets eaten. Soon when [[Tip and Dash]] came in and Tip became extremely frightened due to him seeing the predator, all the other penguins fell as Dash fell on the icy platform flipping the penguin chick back to her mother due to Dash's weight. The hammerhead shark then leaps to the platform launching all the penguins including Tip and Dash into the icy cliff. Soon as the ice cracked, the ice fell down on the shark's head; the shark is completely crushed by falling ice, but it could be presumed the shark survived. This could be because the shark was frozen when crushed by ice. Afterwards, all the other penguins get upset at Tip and Dash, because the two abandoned the mother's chick and almost risking them getting eaten by the shark as well as calling the duo useless heroes.
