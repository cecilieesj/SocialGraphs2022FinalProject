== Role in the film==
As [[Mr. Beaver]] takes the Pevensies to his family's home, Mrs. Beaver happily reunites with her husband, happy to see him back just as she prepares to make supper for the Pevensies. During supper, her husband tells her that there is hope that Aslan is on the move to return to Narnia. The beavers then tell the prophecy that the Pevensies will come to Narnia to defeat the White Witch in order to restore peace. Later when Jadis' Secret Police arrives to destroy the beaver dam, the beavers manage to escape from the dam being destroyed. Having escaped from the wolves, Mrs. Beaver kindly helps heal an injured [[Fox (Narnia)|Fox]] who was wounded during the ambush to which the Fox asks the group that Aslan has asked him to recruit more troops to destroy the White Witch and her minions to which Mr. Beaver explains that he can't go to war without Peter as a plan to follow the prophecy.

Arriving at the Great River, Mrs. Beaver explains that the river is frozen over a hundred years in a plan to find Edmund at the White Witch's courtyard. The beavers then the lead the three Pevensies to escape from the White Witch using a sleigh of reindeer just as the Pevensies and the beavers hide beneath an alcove to which as the Pevensies and the beavers leave the alcove and approach [[Father Christmas]] who kindly gives the gifts to the Pevensies. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver later arrive at the frozen river where the ice starts to crack and the season of spring arrives during a confrontation against Maugrim and his wolf pack. Mrs. Beaver and her husband ended up surviving the frozen river just as the beavers and the Pevensies arrive at Aslan's Camp where the group meets their ruler [[Aslan]] just as the members of Aslan's army bow to meet their ruler.

After the White Witch is defeated, Mrs. Beaver and her husband later give crowns to the Pevensies who become kings and queens of Narnia. With the Pevensies dubbed as rulers of Narnia, the beavers cheer for them during their coronation.
