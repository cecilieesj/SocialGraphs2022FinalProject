Sir Finnegan is a knight of Irish origins who teaches James how to be a knight. At first, he treats James harshly, saying that he has gone through eight squires already, calling James "little prince." However, after James learns from Tilly that his rough treatment is to help him get a taste of the toils of being a knight, James enjoys his job and is welcomed by Finnegan when the knights parade.
