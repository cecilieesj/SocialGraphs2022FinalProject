'''Kevin's Babies''' are [[Kevin]]'s babies in the [[2009]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Up]]''. They are a trio of small exotic birds that Kevin finds after finally escaping from [[Charles Muntz]].

==Role in the film==
[[Kevin|Kevin's]] babies are seen at the end of the film with their mother, Kevin. The three of them are small and look like Kevin. Kevin spits out [[Carl Fredricksen|Carl's]] cane, and the babies spit out the tennis balls, all of which Carl lets them keep as a gift. As soon as Carl and [[Russell]] leave Paradise Falls, Kevin's chicks remain with their mother in Paradise Falls.
