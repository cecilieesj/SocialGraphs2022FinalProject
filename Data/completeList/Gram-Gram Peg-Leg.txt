'''Gram-Gram Peg-Leg''' is [[Pete]]'s grandmother, who always wanted Pete to go into the entertainment business, rather than become a crook. According to her grandson, she used to sing "[[Boom-Da-Boom]]" to him when he was little.

She made her animated debut in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Pete's One-Man Show]]", where she was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. 

At the end of the episode Pete brings her into the House of Mouse to be his audience during his one-man show, after the rest of the club's guests have left.

In the ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' episode "[[Chef Goofy on the Go]]", Pete's grandmother '''Grammie''' appears. Pete asks Mickey and his friends to help him save his Grammie who is hanging from a cliff. In addition, Grammie also appears in the background in a couple more episodes.

== Trivia ==

* As a joking nod to Pete's own peg-leg and his alias "Peg-Leg Pete", Gram-Gram is depicted with a missing leg and is wheelchair-bound in her debut appearance in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Pete's One-Man Show]]".
