'''Cabbie McHale''' is a major character in the [[2014]] [[Disneytoon Studios]] animated feature film, ''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''.

==Background==
===Official Bio===
A jolly old ex-military transport plane, Cabbie used to drop airborne utility vehicles behind enemy lines in Korea. Now he drops the Smokejumpers at [[Piston Peak National Park|Piston Peak]]—it’s a lot like combat, but nobody’s shootin’ at him. With a payload of 10,000 pounds and a maximum takeoff weight of 74,000 pounds—Cabbie can carry the smokejumpers up to 2,000 miles away.<ref name="DIMeetChars">[http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2014/03/10/meet-the-characters-from-planes-fire-rescue/ Meet the Characters from Planes: Fire & Rescue]</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''===
In ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', Cabbie is a [[Smokejumpers]] member, an organization working to fight against wildfires. He first appears at [[Piston Peak National Park|Piston Peak]] with [[Lil' Dipper]], [[Windlifter]], and the [[Smokejumpers]]. He is later seen flying Pinecone, Blackout, Drip, Dynamite, and Avalanche inside his cargo hold. When they arrive at the site of a wildfire, Cabbie opens his cargo hold and allows the Smokejumpers to jump out of him while commenting that "he will never understand why they want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane." He is later present in the main hangar, where he, [[Dusty Crophopper|Dusty]], Lil' Dipper, Windlifter, and the Smokejumpers watch an episode of ''[[CHoPs]]'' (parody of ''CHiPS''). When the episode is over, Cabbie comments that the show stinks. He later helps Lil' Dipper, Windlifter and the Smokejumpers tackle additional wildfires and is last seen taking part in the [[Propwash Junction]] Corn Festival by racing against Dusty.

==Trivia==
*He sports a design based on a Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, a transport plane commonly used in aerial firefighting<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue">[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-fire-rescue-fun-facts-70822/ 'Planes: Fire & Rescue' Fun Facts]</ref><ref name=Honeywell>[http://aerospace.honeywell.com/blog/fighting-wildfires-with-second-chances/ Fighting Wildfires with Second Chances]</ref>
