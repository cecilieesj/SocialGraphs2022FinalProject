==Background==
===Physical Description===
Iron Joe has light tan, ruffled, and unkempt fur, and dark brown stripes. A section of his tail fur has also been bitten off, presumably by a hyena.

===Personality===
Based on his brief appearance, Iron Joe is very paranoid as he is seen shivering and screaming while standing rigidly upright on a rock, protecting the meerkat colony.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Lion King 1½]]''===
He is seen when [[Ma]] directs the audience's attention toward him when convincing her son, [[Timon]], to go on sentry guard for his colony. As the current guard on sentry duty for Timon's [[Meerkat Colony]], Iron Joe gets carried off shortly afterward and is replaced by Timon. After that, he is never mentioned again, although it is likely he, along with the rest of the meerkat colony, were taken to the jungle Timon took his family to.

==Trivia==
*Joe closely resembles [[Uncle Max]].
*Joe's fate is unknown, but after two members of Timon's [[Meerkat Colony|meerkat colony]] came and took him away, he most likely went to "[[Hakuna Matata (location)|Hakuna Matata]]" later, just like his other descendants.
