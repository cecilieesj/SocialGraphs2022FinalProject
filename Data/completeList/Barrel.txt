'''Barrel the Brave''' is a minor character in the [[2019]] animated series ''[[Amphibia]]''. He is one of the former friends of [[King Andrias]] along with [[Leif]].

==Background==

===Personality===

===Physical appearance===
Barrel is a light green horned toad with a mint green belly. He also has light yellowish eyes with red pupils, and sharp dark green teeth. His clothing consists of bronze armor with a fur collar next to his shoulder pads and brown leather underneath.

==Role in the Series==
===Before===
Over 1,000 years before the events of the show, [[King Andrias]] was friends with a frog and a toad.

However, it is implied that Andrias' friends stole the [[Calamity Box]] from under his watch, hid it on Earth and stopped Newtopia's years of development. As more time went by, Amphibia forgot about Newtopia's old legacy.

===Season 2===
He only appears in a torn portrait that was hidden away deep within Andrias' [[Newtopia Castle|castle]] and in a flashback when Andrias revealed his true dark agenda.

He used to be the owner of a warhammer that years later would end up in the hands of [[Sasha Waybright]] and [[Captain Grime]].

=== Season 3 ===
As revealed in "[[The Core & The King]]", he was best friends with Andrias and [[Leif]]. But things changed after Leif had a vision involving the destruction of Amphibia. After Leif's concerns were ignored by [[King Aldrich]], Leif stole the music box. Barrel tried to stop her but soon came to realize that not only he cannot betray his friend despite what she did, but that her vision shows a great danger to their world and what she's doing is right. Barrel allows Leif to escape but is banished from Newtopia by Andrias for his failure to capture Leif and is ordered to keep those outside of Newtopia in line and establishing the future role toads will have as enforcers.
