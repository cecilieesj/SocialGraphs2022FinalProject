== Physical description ==
Tim Treadless is a Next-Gen 2017 Race Car SA-3 that uses Lightyear tires. He has a dark brown livery at the front, black cabin and sides and orange back and roof. He has white stripes on the sides and white number 28 in the flames on his sides and the roof. On his hood he has the logo of Nitroade painted on it. He has black hubcaps and his eyes are grey.

== Personality ==
Tim Treadless is a high-tech next-generation race car. He is intelligent, friendly and fast. Around 2015â€“2016 he was selected as one of the 10 candidates training to become a racing driver for Biggs Racing team with Ray Reverham as a trainer. He lived and trained in the Biggs Industries Racing Complex located in Los Angeles, California, United States. He was a captain of the team. He had good relations with all teammates, excluding Jackson Storm who was the last to join the team. During their first meeting Storm said that he was better at the race simulator and Treadless could learn from him, which started tensions between two. Additionally all other racers thought about Storm's addition to the team as a marketing move to promote the Super Corsa 3 video game, given his e-sports past.

One day during training, Jackson pulled out too aggressively on the turn bumping into Tim and denting his body. Jackson claimed that it was an accident after what he left. The following day, 4 of the trainees left the program, due to the competitive and stressful environment that Jackson has created in the team. Since then, Reverham had intensified the training program, while Treadless got focused on improving himself with a goal of beating Jackson's achievements. One day, Tim and Storm convinced Stats to wire to simulators together allowing them to race each other. Doing so, they broke their trainer's simulator-room rules. For the most of the simulated race Jackson stayed on first position with Tim constantly staying on his tail and at the end of final lap they got locked in and pushed down a straightaway, with Tim winning by a few centimeters. It was the first time anybody beat Jackson's time at the simulator. All teammates were cheering for his victory and when they were celebrating, Storm claimed that Treadless cheated after when he headed for the building's main entryway, where he started spinning in place burning the rubber and generating smoke that activated a fire alarm and sprinklers. After that Reverham ordered him to apologize to Tim and others. Eventually, Axle P. Biggs, owner of the Biggs Industries and racing team, had decided on selecting Tim Treadless as a team racer, despite Storm having better achievements in training, as he believed that Jackson wasn't suitable to represent brand due to his behavior that he presented throughout the training.

== Appearences ==

=== ''[[Cars 3]]'' ===
Despite being selected to become a racer of Biggs Racing, the team never joined the Piston Cup Racing Series, and Tim Treadless joined the Nitroade team instead. He replaces the previous racer, Phil Tankson and races with the number 28. Tim joined the Piston Cup series in the mid-season of 2016, debuting at the Motor Speedway of the South. Later, he is seen finishing 10th at the Grandol Oil Co. Raceway, 4th in Mood Springs Sputter Stop 350 at the Georgia Super Speedway and 9th in Bumper Save Gears and Glory 450 at the Heartland Motor Speedway. He competed in the race at the Los Angeles International Speedway during which Lightning McQueen had crashed. During that, he was next to McQueen when he hit the wall and went airborne. Both Tim and Harvey watched in shock as McQueen went flying. The next year, he competed in the Florida 500 at the Florida International Super Speedway where he started from the 20th position. During the race he got caught up in the wreck, hitting Cam Spinner and getting pilled into him by Ryan Laney. He received heavy damage and wasn't able to finish the race.

== Trivia ==

* Racing number 28 was also used by: Aiken Axler and Phil Tankson.
* Although he has grey eyes in the ''Cars 3'' film, his official artwork depicts him with blue eyes, and Mattel's 1:55 diecast toy model, with brown.
* His 1:55 diecast toy model depicts him with an orange spoiler, although in the film he is depicted with a black spoiler.
* In the scene of collision during Florida 500, before he was hit, Tim's spoiler was similar to that of Ryan Laney or Jim Reverick's.
* His 1:55 scale die-cast doesn't have the rookie stripes like the other Next-Gen racers.
** This is actually accurate to the movie as Tim lacks the rookie stripes in the film as well.
* He is so far the only Next-Gen racer to have any form of a backstory besides Jackson Storm and Cruz Ramirez.
