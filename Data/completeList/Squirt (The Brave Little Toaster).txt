'''Squirt''' is one of the major characters from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''. He is a nozzle-sprayer at a sink.

==Role in the film==
He is first seen when he helps unscrew something stuck on the end of his mother [[Faucet]]. He later watches Faucet fill [[Robbie McGroarty|Robbie]]'s bottle before the gang leaves to go to [[Mars]]. Near the end of the film, he is dripping and Faucet thinks he's crying, but he tells her that he actually needs a new washer. She then tells him that maybe [[Santa Claus|Santa]] will bring him one. At the end of the film, Squirt and his mother are asleep.
