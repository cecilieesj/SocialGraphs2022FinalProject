'''Swala''' is a gazelle that appears in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Swala is an argumentative gazelle who does not initially trust [[Kion]]. Over time, she comes to accept him as a leader and puts her faith in him. She is hot-tempered and quick to blame but learns to put her quarrels with [[Muhimu]] aside to help her give birth to a son. She is sarcastic and will resort to physical violence if she needs to.

==Role in the Series==
===''[[The Mbali Fields Mirgration|The Mbali Fields Migration]]''===
When Swala and her herd get into a fight with Muhimu and her herd, the Lion Guard rushes to put a stop to the argument. Once there, [[Bunga]] gets sat on by an actively fighting Muhimu, who continues squabbling with Swala until Kion steps forward, roaring for silence. With the herds now paying attention, he and [[Beshte]] explain that the grazing grounds in the Pride Lands are open to everyone, but Muhimu and Swala explain that there's only one small patch of grass left for them to share.

After Kion consults with his father, [[Simba]], he announces to the herds that he will be leading them to Mbali Fields, and the two herds cheer for him. With Kion in the lead, the combined herds follow the [[Lion Guard]] through the [[Pride Lands]].

=== ''[[The Trail to Udugu]]'' ===
Swala and her herd are trying to climb a large clump of rocks up to some grassland. Ono notices this and relays the information back to the Lion Guard and Simba who is temporarily leading the Lion Guard whilst his son searches for Udugu. Since Simba realizes how unstable the rock is, he orders the Guard to follow him to Swala.

When Swala notices the impending lion, the dust being kicked up blurs her vision. Since she is unable to see what is approaching her she panics, and she and her herd start to run up the unstable rock formation. As they do so, the rocks tumble and fall, narrowly missing Simba beneath.

The herd then start stampeding on the high ground, right for  Mbuni's Flock and their eggs. Soon, Ono swoops down to her and requests that she slows down. Due to the stampeding hoofs around her, she is unable to hear and asks Ono to speak up. He does so, but it's still not enough. Annoyed that she can't hear his words, she abruptly stops and demands that her herd do the same so that she can hear him. They calm down and Swala asks Ono to repeat what he said, but since Ono was just trying to stop them anyway, he tells her not to mind and flies away.
