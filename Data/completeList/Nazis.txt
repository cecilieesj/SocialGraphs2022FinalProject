The '''Nazis''' are an evil historic organization which appeared as the villains in large amounts of Disney properties.

== Background==
The Nazis (short for '''Nationalsozialistische''' meaning the '''National Socialist German Workers' Party''') were a real life organization in [[Germany]] which rose to power in the fallout of World War I by using hatemongering, advocating for white/Aryan German supremacy and an adamant hatred towards Jewish people and people of color, namely Romani people (also known as Gypsies or Gipsies). In [[1933]], the Nazis took over Germany's parliament via the Nazi Adolf Hitler who had risen to power and had been appointed as chancellor and later dictator of the nation.

In [[1939]], the Nazi party invaded [[Poland]] for resources and territory. As a result, Germany was declared an enemy of [[Britain]] and [[France]] which resulted in what would become World War II. This war would be split between two major factions spanning the globe, the Axis (which were supporters of Hitler's dictatorship and included [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]), and the Allies which opposed the Nazis.

In [[1941]] Hitler and the Nazis began the Holocaust in-which they began arresting Jewish people, Romani people, people of color, the disabled, and people of the LGBTQ+ community such as gay people. They subsequently began forcing them into prison-camps and death camps where they would be kept in inhumane conditions and executed.

By the end of the war in [[1945]], the allies defeated the Axis and the Nazis and their organization was dissolved making Germany free and independent again.  But the damage which they left were immeasurable with millions having been killed by the Holocaust alone. Hitler is recorded to have died in 1945 by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound due to the fear of Russian Soviets invading Germany. Horrifically, while the original Nazis of Germany were dealt with, large amounts of their supporters persisted into modern day across the world due to hatred and fear mongering.

==Film Appearances==
===''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''===
They stage an amphibious landing near [[Pepperinge Eye]] under the command of [[Colonel Heller]] in the Wehrmacht, who lies that "This is no invasion, this is just exercise." [[Miss Eglantine Price]] first attempts to show her witchcraft by transforming the commanding officer into a "nice, white rabbit", but can't remember the spell and her claim to be a witch is taken as nonsense.

Later, however, she casts a powerful [[Substitutiary Locomotion|spell]] which causes old British military uniforms and suits of armor to be [[Knights|occupied]] by their ghosts, a slew of soldiers from history such as Redcoats and Highlanders rise up, causing the Nazis embarrassment as well as defeat. However, when the Nazis blow up her workshop, the spell is broken when Miss Price (who was flying nearby) is caught at the edge of the explosion and is blown into nearby bushes, thus losing her concentration on the spell.

As the mortified Nazis are leaving the land, the Home Guard appear at the coast and fire shots as the Nazis retreat back to the Kriegsmarine submarine that brought them to [[England]]. Presumably, they return to their native country of Germany or another Nazi-occupied area.

===''Indiana Jones''===
====''Raiders of the Lost Ark''====
The Nazis are the main antagonists of this film set in [[1936]], attempting to get their hands on the Arc of the Covenant from Jewish faith to try and weaponize it to use in the war. They travel to Egypt to try and find the ark and kill both Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood in their own search for the ark. After Jones' finds the Ark, the Nazis make the mistake of opening it and are horrifically but cathartically killed by the Jewish God for their crimes against the Jewish people.

====''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''====
This film in [[1938]] has Indiana Jones racing against the Nazis to try and find the Holy Grail after they kidnap his father to try and extract information from him. By the end of the film, the Nazis are defeated thanks to the Grail's temple collapsing on them.

===''[[The Rocketeer]]''===
The Nazis are the primary antagonists in this film set in 1938. In it they attempt to smuggle a jet-pack only for it to wind up in the ownership of an American stuntman named [[Cliff Secord]] who quickly becomes an enemy of the Nazis. This leads up to a battle over the skies of [[Hollywood]] where the Rocketeer manages to kill the Nazis in a fiery explosion.

===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
The MCU features a branch of the Nazis called [[HYDRA]].

==Shorts and television==
===''[[Education for Death]]''===
This was a [[1943]] short-film made to inform western audiences on how Nazis conditioned soldiers from a young age such as the film's protagonist [[Little Hans]].

===''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]''===
This 1943 short was made to mock the Nazis and other members of the Axis. Much of the short revolves around [[Donald Duck]] stuck in a nightmare where he is a Nazi weapons-manufacturer. It should be noted that while this short was noble in its effort against the Nazi party, it also contains a racist caricature of Japanese general [[wikipedia:Hideki Tojo|Hideki Tojo]], however, it should also be noted that Hideki and his Japanese forces were principal members of the Axis and that every villain in the short is exaggeratedly caricatured, in addition to the fact that this is a World War II propaganda cartoon.

===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
[[HYDRA]], the MCU's branch of the Nazis, appears in ''[[Agent Carter]]'' and ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''

===Marvel animated shows===
[[HYDRA]], Marvel's branch of the Nazis, appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'', ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''.
