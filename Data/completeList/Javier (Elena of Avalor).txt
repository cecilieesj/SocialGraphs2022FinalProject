==Background==
===Personality===
Javier is an insolent whelp. He is extremely full of himself to the point where he's extremely rude and arrogant. Because of this, his classmates don't like him at all because they find him insufferable. He hates Princess Isabel due to seeing her as a threat to his "popularity". He's also dishonest, willing to resort to cheating and sabotage. He's also immature to the point where he's also a bit bratty.

===Physical appearance===
Javier is a dark-skinned teenager with black hair and amber eyes.

==Role in the series==
Javier makes his debut appearance in "[[Class Act]]" as the main antagonist.

He is used to being the youngest in Professor Ochoa's class and fancies himself as the best in the class. Because of this, his classmates find him arrogant and don't like him at all. When Isabel arrives, Javier immediately identifies her as a threat. He is rude and condensending to her the entire time. He even lies about supplies she needs being out of stock. He finally crosses the line when he steals the clamp on Isabel's machine, causing it to fall apart. He is smugly satisfied when she leaves but is horrified when she comes back and builds a new machine that the Professor is impressed with. When Professor Ochoa picks her project he throws a tanturm that enables the theft of the clamp to get discovered. Professor Ochoa punishes him by suspending him.

In "[[Norberg Peace Prize]]", it is mentioned that Isabel and Javier have since learned to work together, but that it does not mean they are friends or even like each other.
