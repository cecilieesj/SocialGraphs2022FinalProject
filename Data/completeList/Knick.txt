}}'''Knick''' is the title character of ''[[Knick Knack]]''. He is a snowman who tries to get out of the ''Nome Sweet Nome, Alaska'' snowglobe to join the party of other knick-knacks. Knick is the official name of the character, as said by [[John Lasseter]] in the short's commentaries from the ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''Pixar Short Films Collection'' DVDs.

==Role in the short film==
Unlike all the other knick-knacks, Knick feels unsatisfied of living in his snow globe, so he plans on trying to escape his snow globe to join the other knick-knacks as he plans to escape in order to fall in love with the Sunny Miami knick-knack. He grabs an igloo and uses it to break the snow globe, but his attempt was unsuccessful. He then does several attempts to escape his globe like using a hammer and his carrot nose to break through, a jackhammer, a cutting torch, and several TNT explosions, in which none of them are successful.

Though none of the plans he did are successful, Knick notices his globe being perched on a ledge because he used the explosions while trying to escape. Knick finally escapes his snow globe and is finally free while falling, but ends up falling into a fishbowl. Knick then discovers a mermaid knick-knack named "Sunny Atlantis" as he tries to fall in love with her, but the snow globe lands on him, capturing him the second time and feeling frustrated that he ended up in his snow globe again.
