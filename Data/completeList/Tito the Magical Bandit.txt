When he was a young man, he sang on the street but the people who passed by him kept moving, they used his case to toss their trash into. No praise, no fame, no cheers, no cash.
But that all came to an end when he found his magical guitar to put people in trances. He can hypnotize people by playing his music. After putting Elena and her friends under his spell, Isabel works with her friends to help foil his scheme and break his guitar, freeing Elena and friends from his trance.
