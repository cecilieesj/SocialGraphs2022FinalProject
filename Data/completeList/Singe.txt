==Role in the Series==
Singe makes his first appearance in "[[The Royal Dragon]]". He first appears at the annual Dragon Roast 'N' Toast as an attendee. He is very impressed with Sizzle's talents. When Crackle claims that Sofia is the Royal Dragon of Enchancia, Singe starts fawning over her and is very impressed with her flying. However, during the flight, Sofia is revealed to actually be a human girl which reveals that Crackle was lying about everything. Consequently, when Crackle tells the group about Sir Oliver he doesn't believe her, only to discover too late that Crackle is telling the truth this time.
