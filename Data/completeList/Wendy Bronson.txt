'''Wendy Bronson''' is a character in the [[2008]] Disney fantasy-comedy film ''[[Bedtime Stories]]''. She is the daughter of [[Marty Bronson]], the sister of [[Skeeter Bronson|Skeeter]] and the mother of [[Patrick]] and [[Bobbi]]. She is portrayed by [[Courteney Cox]].

==Background==
As kids, Wendy and Skeeter grew up and worked in their father's motel; The Sunny Vista Motel. After it was sold to Barry Nottingham, it was unknown where Wendy went to live as Skeeter stayed at the Motel. At some point in her young adult years, she met and married a guy and had two kids, Patrick and Bobbi. It was later revealed that she and him got a divorce. In the movie Wendy was shown to be that of a health nut as during Bobbi's birthday she only served gluten-free wheat cake and didn't like him bringing fatty food. She refused to have Skeeter take the kids fishing or playing poker.
