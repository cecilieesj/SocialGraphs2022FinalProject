The '''Tooth Fairy''' is a legendary creature for all children and adults in the [[Fairy Tale Forest (Goldie & Bear)|fairy tale forest]]. When a kid loses a tooth, they put it under their pillow for the tooth fairy to collect, and in the morning, they get a shiny gold coin. [[Bear (Goldie & Bear)|Bear]] lost his first baby tooth and tried to get to sleep so the Tooth Fairy could come and get his tooth. But [[Jack and Jill (Goldie and Bear)|Jack and Jill]] wanted to stay up all night. In the end, Bear's tooth finally gets to the Tooth Fairy.
