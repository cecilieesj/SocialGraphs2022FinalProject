'''Ellie Steckler''' is a deuteragonist of the [[2022]] [[Disney+]] original film, ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. She is a young police officer who wishes to prove herself useful to the force, following a bad lead.

==Background==

===Personality===
Ellie is dedicated to her work but being young is also wide-eyed and clearly wet behind the ears. She is a fan at heart as she adores the chipmunks and their television show; being the inspiration behind her wanting to join the force. 

==Trivia==
*Ellie is similar to [[Eddie Valiant]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' as both of them are private detectives who work in the law enforcement for Toons in animated/live-action hybrid films, except that unlike Eddie Valiant who hated Toons, Ellie is the complete opposite as she is shown to be a huge fan of Chip and Dale and their television show.
**She is also in a way similar to that of [[Miranda Wright]] from ''[[Bonkers]]'' as both of them are female police officers who work alongside animated Toon characters (Chip and Dale for Ellie, [[Bonkers D. Bobcat]] for Miranda).
*In earlier promotional trades, her name was initially '''Ellie Whitfield'''.
*Ellie claims that ''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'' didn't air in Albany and that her grandmother would record the episodes for her to watch. In reality, the series definitely aired on all public network television all across America.
*Her favorite episode from ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' was "[[When You Fish Upon a Star]]".
