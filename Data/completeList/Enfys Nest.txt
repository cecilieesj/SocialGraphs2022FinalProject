'''Enfys Nest''' is a supporting character in ''[[Solo]]'' and is initially falsely presented as its main antagonist. She is a brave and noble member of the yet-to-be-officially-founded  [[Rebel Alliance]] who pretends to be a dangerous marauder in order to mask her true objectives. Once she clarifies who she is and her intentions, she helps [[Han Solo]] defeat [[Dryden Vos]] and [[Tobias Beckett]]. Later, she offers Han a position in the Rebel alliance, but Han declines. Han would eventually join the rebellion many years later and become one of its leaders.
