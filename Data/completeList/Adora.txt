'''Adora''' is one of the twelve Star Darling students at Starling Academy and also one of the supporting characters and protagonists in Disney's ''[[Star Darlings]]''.

==Background==
===Official Description===
''No detail is too small for Adora. She loves analyzing and examining everything. She’s cool, clearheaded, and also has stellar style. Whether she is trying to create a new sparkly fabric or stardust eyeliner, Adora is dedicated to the science of fashion!''
===Personality===
If there was one word to describe Adora, it would be logical. With a calm mind and laser focus, she analyses the world around her with facts and reason, the tools she uses to make it better. Adora <span>is also rather introverted and at her happiest when she can be alone, conducting chemistry experiments, creating cutting edge fashions, or a little of both! </span>Although a kind and polite girl, Adora's preference for cold, hard logic makes her aloof, unable to empathize, and annoyed when her peers think with their hearts instead of their heads.

== Appearance ==
Adora’s theme color is sky blue. She is a slender teen girl with dark skin, blue eyes, lips, and hair held in a bun. Her outfit consists of a dark blue striped sweater under a long sky blue jacket with star patterns and jeans with a star belt. Her accessories consist of her star-charmed watch, a blue star necklace, and a blue side purse with a star design. 

On Earth, Adora’s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of sky blue. Her skin loses its sparkle, and her outfit changes to normal human clothes. The only item that remains the same is her star-charmed watch.
