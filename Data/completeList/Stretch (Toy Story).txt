'''Stretch''' is one of the tertiary antagonists of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[2010]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. She is a glittery purple rubber toy octopus and was one of [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s henchmen at [[Sunnyside Daycare]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Stretch is a purple rubbery octopus toy at [[Sunnyside Daycare]]. When [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys first arrive at Sunnyside, she shakes hands with [[Hamm]], [[Slinky]], and [[Barbie]]. Stretch starts out as one of [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s minions, helping with the capture of Andy's toys with her tentacles (at one point, [[Jessie]] attempts to escape, but Stretch catches her and throws her in one of the cells). Later, she and her cohorts catch Woody and his friends trying to escape Sunnyside via the garbage chute, and prepares to push them into the dumpster should they not admit defeat. However, when [[Woody]] and Lotso have a heated argument about [[Daisy (Toy Story 3)|Daisy]], Lotso's former owner, Stretch is seen to visibly cringe at Lotso's true demeanor being revealed. After Lotso destroys [[Big Baby]]'s old pendant, he angrily orders Stretch to push Woody and his friends into the dumpster, which Stretch is now reluctant to do. Eventually, Lotso is thrown into the dumpster by Big Baby, and Stretch is petrified and shocked at what has happened. She then quickly leaves the area, letting Andy's toys escape and leaving Lotso to his fate in the dumpster.

During the closing credits, she is seen happily greeting a bunch of new toys that are donated to Sunnyside in a box that includes an [[Emperor Zurg]] action figure and uses her tentacles to lift them out of the box and lower them safely onto the floor. She is also seen hanging out at a "beach party" in what has used to be "The Box" and later at a disco party in the [[Butterfly Room]]. The next day, after [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] places her backpack in the rack, Stretch sneaks out from behind a lunchbox above Bonnie's backpack to place a letter from Ken to Woody, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], and the toys living at [[Bonnie's House|Bonnie's house]] into the backpack to let them know that Sunnyside has become a happier place for everyone.

==Trivia==
*Stretch appears to be based on the {{WikipediaLink|Wacky WallWalker}} toys from the [[1980]]s.
*[[Whoopi Goldberg]] also voiced [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Shenzi]] in [[The Lion King (franchise)|''The Lion King'' franchise]].
