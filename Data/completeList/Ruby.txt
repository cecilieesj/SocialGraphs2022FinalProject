==Background==
===Physical Description===
Ruby is an {{WikipediaLink|Afghan Hound}} who also lives among [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]]'s gang of junkyard dogs. She is also the only other female dog member besides [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]].

===Personality===
Ruby seems to have a disturbing attraction to [[Scamp]]. It may be because she is one of [[Tramp]]'s past girlfriends, or so she says. Whether or not this is true is unknown. She even admits to Scamp that she has "a bad case of puppy love." She eventually leaves [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]] with the other junkyard dogs, minus Buster, and gets adopted by a family.

==Trivia==
*Ruby greatly resembles [[w:c:balto:Sylvie|Sylvie]] from the {{WikipediaLink|Universal Pictures}} animated film, ''{{WikipediaLink|Balto (film)|Balto}}''.
*Ruby's attraction to Scamp is similar to [[Tito]]'s attraction to [[Georgette]] in ''[[Oliver & Company]]''.
*Her "puppy love" may stem from the fact that she likes puppies in general.
