'''MC Honey'''Â is a rapper that [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] helped out in the past. As a result, she is always happy to see Team Possible, and helps them however she can. 


==Biography==
MC Honey credited Kim with being the reason for much of her success. Kim presumably helped recover a stolen demo tape for her. In return, MC Honey gave Team Possible a ride while they were in pursuit of a teleportation module supposedly stolen by Professor Dementor.<ref>Hidden Talent</ref>

After he overheard Shego listening to one of MC Honey's songs, Dr. Drakken thought his hypnotizing shampoo would sell better if it got mentioned in a rap song, and attempted to get MC Honey on board with the idea. She refused to cooperate with him.<ref>[[Rappin' Drakken (episode)|Rappin Drakken]]</ref>

MC Honey was one of several celebrities framed for theft by [[Camille Leon]] and arrested. Team Possible revealed Camille to be the real thief and had her arrested.<ref>[[Trading Faces]]</ref>
