He was a friend of [[Héctor]] in the [[Land of the Dead]].

== Role in the film ==
After agreeing to enter a music contest to meet [[Ernesto de la Cruz]], Héctor takes [[Miguel Rivera]] to his friend Chicharrón to get a guitar. While there, Héctor and Chicharrón share some banter and a final drink together, as Chicharrón is slowly fading from the Land of the Dead because he has no relatives to remember him in the Land of the Living. Héctor asks for [[Chicharrón's Guitar|Chicharrón's guitar]], but Chicharrón demands Héctor sing Chicharrón's favorite song, "[[Everyone Knows Juanita]]", in exchange for the guitar. During the song, Chicharron notes that Héctor is not singing the correct lyrics, to which Hector explains that there are children present (Miguel). When Héctor finishes the song, a satisfied Chicharrón embraces his final death and his spirit fades into oblivion, with only his hat left in place. While Héctor finishes the drink he shared with Chicharrón to honor him, Miguel is astonished by Chicharrón's disappearance, but he agrees to use Chicharrón's guitar in the contest to save Héctor from succumbing to the same fate.
