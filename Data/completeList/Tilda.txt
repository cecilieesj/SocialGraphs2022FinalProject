}}'''Tilda''' is a character in the [[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]] segment of the film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]].''
==Description==
Tilda is one of the young maids of Sleepy Hollow, who like the other women of the village, shows a liking to [[Ichabod Crane|Ichabod]].

== Appearances ==

=== [[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]] ===
Tilda first appears asking someone what’s the new school master’s name, which she is told by him, Ichabod Crane. She then appears when Ichabod makes her along with two other girls sing. During the party organized by [[Baltus Van Tassel]], [[Brom Bones]] notices Tilda has no dance partner and decided to use her as a way to swap her with [[Katrina Van Tassel|Katrina]]. This comically backfires as Tilda, excited about having someone to dance with, will not let go of him.

She is last seen listening to Brom's story of the [[Headless Horseman (song)|Headless Horseman]] and singing a few parts. Though not seen, she leaves for home after the party ends.

===[[House of Mouse]]===
Tilda briefly appears in the [[House of Mouse]] episode "[[The Three Caballeros (House of Mouse)|The Three Caballeros]]", where she and the [[Bimbettes]] are seen running after [[Jose Carioca]] and [[Panchito Pistoles]], having been swooned by the pair.
