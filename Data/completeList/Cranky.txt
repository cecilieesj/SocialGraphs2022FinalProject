He is also the main character in ''Where's My Water? ''in ''[[Where's My Water?|Cranky's Story]]''.

== Appearance ==
Cranky takes on the appearance of a anthropomorphic obese light green alligator (not as light compared to Allie) and he is the largest alligator in the sewer, towering over [[Swampy]] or [[Allie]]. He has purple ring-like bags on his eyes, 12 teeth sticking out (6 on each side) of his mouth and a distinctive blue scar on his belly. In addition, Cranky's mouth tends to be more "wavy" compared to Swampy and Allie who have simple looking mouths. Cranky's claws, toes are blue and his round, but pointy scales are also blue. Cranky's skin shows dark patches of mud and food, his belly is almost white and shaped like a square. His tail look's a lot like Allie, except it's longer, thicker and pointer; but unlike Allie, the tail faces inward. Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Cranky has four fingers and two toes. 

In the second game, Cranky is very similar in looks to his original counterpart, the only difference is that he is slightly darker and has a shadow like line that runs from his chest to the base of his tail.  

== Personality ==
Cranky is the largest alligator in the sewer. He is always hungry, eats anything and has an issue with algae. As his name suggest, he is very cranky and always shown with an angry face. He is also the leader of the sewer gators.

He was formerly in a relationship with Allie in the first game, until she abandoned him when Swampy gave her a purple bow. He sabotages Swampy's shower and bullies him whenever he gets the chance and he doesn't show aggression towards Allie.

In the second game, he is no longer an antagonist, but rather an "anti-villain"; with his original traits such as being lazy and disrespectful. He also seems to have a pet crab, only appearing in the main menu or at the Beach. Like Allie, he is somewhat portrayed as an adult, however Allie is more sensible then him. Even though as an adult, Cranky is often seen being "empty-headed" and he mainly cares about his food.

Cranky always has an issue with Algae that covers his "food" in his lair. Therefore, he relies on a old pipe that drips out Purple Water to clear off his plate. Despite having an enormous appetite, Cranky is shown to be incredibly strong, as seen in some cutscenes where he helps out Swampy build a special instrument for Allie as a special gift by carrying planks of wood, pipes and several other objects..

In Where's My Water?: Swampy's Underground Adventures, Cranky often uses the other alligators (notably [[Pushy and Shovey]]) as his minions to perform "dirty work". Like in the games, he eats just about anything he can find from chicken legs to briefcases. Cranky is very lazy and very rarely shows love to other alligators like Swampy as seen in the episode

==Role in ''[[Where's My Water?]]''==
Cranky causes trouble for [[Swampy]] in every chapter in any way he can. Cranky hates to eat vegetables and will eat anything he finds in the sewer. He lives even deeper then Swampy does and holds the title of leader of the alligators. Cranky and his gang spend most of their days tormenting Swampy. The reason for such behavior is caused by Cranky's hatred of humans. Since both Swampy and the humans bath, Cranky feels that Swampy has no role in their society. He originally had a relationship with the sewer's female resident [[Allie]] but she left Cranky for Swampy, causing even more tension between the two gators.

===''[[Where's My Water?#Cranky.27s Story|Cranky's Story]]''===
Cranky appears as the main character of the spin-off which is an in-app purchase in the first game. Here, players must assist Cranky in retrieving his "junk food", much like how they gave Swampy his bath water in the original game, but using purple poison water to remove the algae from his food. If the player uses regular water or runs out of poison water, he or she will fail and the level must be restarted. The story has 4 chapters and a potential 5th on the artist's site.

* "Cranky's First Course": Cranky runs out of poison water and his food remains covered in algae in his lair.
* "Hunger Pains": Swampy and Allie celebrate Cranky's Birthday, but Cranky is still hungry.
* "Bulking Up": Swampy decides to help Cranky get some exercise to get him back in shape in the city's subway yard, but all Cranky wants to do is eat.
* "Overstuffed": Swampy and Allie are on a dock using bait at the end of their fishing rods to feed Cranky. But as Cranky keeps swimming, he misses the bait and pulls on the rods, even Allie's rod come loose from her grip. The dock starts to collapse while Swampy and Allie watch helplessly. The ending shows Cranky with a full stomach sleeping.

== Eating Habits in WMW & WMW2 ==
In the first game, Cranky eats his food in nearly the same way every time. He rocks back and then forth while lifting one leg at the same time. He either chomps his food in 2 different ways or swallow it whole. After he swallows, Cranky puts his hands on his belly.

In the second game, Cranky stretches his body and bends down rather then rocking back and then forth while lifting one leg at the same time, then he chomps 12 times and then swallows it. After he swallows, Cranky does not put his hands on his belly just like in the classic game.

== Trivia ==
* Like [[Swampy]], Cranky is also voiced by Justin T. Bowler
* Cranky is well known for his cackling like laugh
* Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Cranky has four fingers and two toes. But real gators have''' '''5 toes on the front legs while the back legs have only 4 toes.
* If you tap on Cranky in the Pirate Cove area of ''Where's My Water? 2'', he will swallow an alarm clock, causing his eyes to tick until he spits the clock out, a reference to [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile]] from ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.
