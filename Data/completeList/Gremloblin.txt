The '''Gremloblin''', is a mythical creature and the main antagonist in ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' episode, "[[Boss Mabel]]". He is half gremlin and half goblin, who can make people see their worst fears if they look right into his glowing eyes.

According to [[Journal 3|the Journal]], using water against him should only be as a last resort, as water only makes him more angry. When he looks into his reflection, and thus looking into his own eyes, he sees his worst fear: becoming like his father. This causes the Gremloblin to run back to the forest in terror.
