[[Robbie Sinclair|Robbie]] had a crush on Caroline, and usually the episodes she was in were centered on the young Sinclair's affections for her. Her face was puppeteered by [[Julianne Buescher|Julianne Buescher,]] while her body was performed by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Townshend Star Townshend]. Buescher also voiced her in her premier episode; however in all episodes past that point, Caroline was voiced by Jessica Lundy.



Caroline was first seen in "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_210:_How_to_Pick_Up_Girls How to Pick Up Girls]," in which Robbie gets help from [[Spike (dinosaur)|Spike]] on how to impress her. His new-found animalistic behavior disgusted her greatly. Robbie also embarrassed himself by doing [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Mating_Dance the Mating Dance] for Caroline in front of all his classmates ("[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_302:_Dirty_Dancin%27 Dirty Dancin']").

Nevertheless, Robbie managed to befriend Caroline and even ask her out - after swallowing a dose of [[Thornoids]] - in "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_316:_Steroids_to_Heaven Steroids to Heaven]." After their disastrous date, marred by Robbie's thornoid-induced rage, Robbie switched his romantic attentions to [[Wendy Richfield]], daughter of [[Bradley P. Richfield|B.P. Richfield]].

During her first appearance, Caroline was green with spots, like [[Mindy (Dinosaurs)|Mindy]] (for whom the identical puppet suit was always used). For the third season, a light brown, crested dinosaur with pink stripes was used for female characters. In most appearances (including Caroline Foxworth), Julianne Buescher puppeteered and supplied the voice. Jessica Lundy supplied the voice for other incarnations of the character (when performed by other puppeteers).
