===Powers and abilities===
====Powers====
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' As a merman, Alex is far more durable than normal humans and even certain aquatic/marine creatures; for example, he is able to withstand the immense underwater pressures.
*'''Speed Swimming:''' As a merman, Alex is capable of swimming much faster than normal humans and even certain aquatic/marine creatures in terms of undersea travel or sea travel; for example, he was able to get to Prince Eric's kingdom from [[Atlantica]] in less than a day.
*'''Underwater Breathing:''' As a merman, Alex is able to metabolize oxygen from the water, which negates the need to surface; although he is certainly more than capable of breathing on land.
*'''Aquapathy:''' As a merman, Alex is capable of speaking with aquatic fauna; as he can understand and communicate with aquatic/marine creatures.

==Trivia==
*He sorta bears a little bit of a resemblance to the human boy Melody danced with at her 12th Birthday Party.
