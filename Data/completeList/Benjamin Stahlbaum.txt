===''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''===
As [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] and her brother [[Fritz Stahlbaum|Fritz]] go downstairs to receive presents during Christmas Eve, their father Benjamin gives the three gifts to them: toy soldiers for Fritz, a dress for [[Louise Stahlbaum|Louise]], and a silver egg for Clara to which she is unable to open it. Feeling glum about her gift, Benjamin explains to his daughter that it is important to maintain traditions as family, especially when Christmas arrives, much to how Clara is feeling frustrated in attempting to open Marie's last gift.

On their way to the party, Benjamin tells Clara to be on her best behavior in the party while telling Fritz to have good table manners and Louise to make new friends while dancing and arriving at Godfather [[Drosselmeyer]]'s mansion, Benjamin gives his family members' names in order for them to attend the party. Later, Benjamin is disappointed with his daughter explaining to her that she didn't follow what her father said to her, much to Clara feeling troubled by what her father said to her. He later appears briefly when Clara travels to the Palace of the Four Realms and enters the Palace's clockwork area where Clara sees her father looking downcast in the real world just as Clara returns back to the Palace.

After Clara returns home, she reunited with her father explaining to her that life has been difficult without Marie in the Stahlbaum family's life. Clara shows her father the opened egg, which reminds her father that the music was the very first one he and his wife first danced to just as Clara and her father dance, followed by Louise and Fritz joining in the dance. Back at home, the Stahlbaum family dances together to the waltz along with the other party guests.
