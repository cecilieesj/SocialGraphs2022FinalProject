==Background==
===Personality===
As his name suggests, Jitters is nervous and worrisome, though he is loyal to Bonkers. As a result of his bad luck and frequent physical injury to his person, he often utters, "I hate my life".

==Appearances==
===''[[Raw Toonage]]''===
Jitters used to work at Wackytoon Studios acting in ''He's Bonkers'', segment to ''Raw Toonage''. He played the role of Bonkers' pal who always got into trouble. In real life, Jitters tries to avoid Bonkers, because Jitters ends up at the wrong end of the stick every time they meet,  squeezed by an anvil, ran over by a bulldozer, or blown to pieces by a bomb.

In the short "[[Get Me to the Church on Time]]", he marries an elephant named Tanya.

In one episode Jitters hosted the show, doing stunt work for [[Ducktales]], [[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]], [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]], and [[TaleSpin]].

===''[[Bonkers]]''===
Jitters mainly appeared in the Miranda episodes.
