'''The Teds''' are a group of ground squirrels who appear as the main antagonists of the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' episode "[[You Ghana Join the Club]]".

==Background==
===Personality===
The Teds are rude, obnoxious, and sneaky, as they show up to kick Timon and Pumbaa out so they can build their club. They also repeatedly trick Timon and Pumbaa go to the [[Savage Lion|lion]], hoping that he will eat them both.
===Physical appearance===
The Teds are small, different-colored ground squirrels. One of them is blue with cream blue chest, another one is pink with cream pink chest, another one is purple with cream purple chest, another one is blue-green with cream blue-green chest, and another one is orange with cream orange chest.

The Teds' tails and lines on their sides are darker versions of each one of their skin colors.

All of the Teds wear a fez with a "T" at the top, which stands for their names.

==Role in the series==
While [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] are relaxing near a pond under a shady tree, the Teds show up to build their club called "Club Ted!" They kick Timon and Pumbaa out and tell them that they can't join unless their names are Ted, which gives Timon an idea.

Timon and Pumbaa go to the Teds and tell them that their names are Ted. The Teds tell them that in order to join, they have to put jingly bells around the neck of the [[Savage Lion|savage lion]]. They are really hoping that the lion will eat them both.

After Timon and Pumbaa manage to put the jingly bells on the lion, the Teds come up with another plan. They make Timon and Pumbaa go back to the lion to remove the jingly bells, telling them that they need proof that the two put it on him.

After Timon and Pumbaa take the jingly bells from the lion, who was taking a shower and removed it when he was about to go in, the Teds come up with another plan to have the lion eat Timon and Pumbaa. They make the two put a suit on him.

After the lion attacks Timon and Pumbaa, the two go back to the Teds. The Teds are about to make Timon and Pumbaa go back to the lion to remove the suit, but the two brought the lion with them so he can realize that the Teds have been making them go to him. He then attacks the Teds.
