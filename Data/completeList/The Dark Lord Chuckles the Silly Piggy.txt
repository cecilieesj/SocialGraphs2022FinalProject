==Background==
He is an evil pig with a high-collared cape (and equally high voice) bent on ruling [[Udrogoth]]. He is the main antagonist of the show. Chuckles lives in a castle on the outskirts of the kingdom. His schemes usually rely on a particular gimmick (like giant clams, giant ducks, evil pastries, or evil furniture). Catchphrase: (whenever he gets hurt) "Ooh, my little piggy [insert body part]". It was also revealed in one episode that he has a nephew named Knuckles the Silly Piggy, who wanted to be the Harvest Hog instead of a dark lord of evil.
===Powers and Abilities===
Chuckles possesses the Mystic Amulet of Hogswineboar This grants him amazing mystical powers such as telekinesis, shape-shifting, blasting magic to rival [[Lula]]'s, and conjuration.The amulet is the source to all of Chuckles magical powers and with out it Chuckles is powerless. Even with out resorting to magic Chuckles is also a whiz with technology, as evidenced by the constructing Mecha-Dave. He can devour power of the gods and unleash bolts of lightning.

==Role in the series==
In the episode "[[Pet Threat]]," [[Faffy]] is sad because the family forgot to get him anything during Dragon Appreciation Week, so [[Dave Barbarian|Dave]] buys Faffy a diseased weasel for a pet. The diseased weasel gets all of Dave's attention, so Faffy runs away. The weasel turns out to be Chuckles The Silly Piggy in disguise, who wants to steal The Magical Grape of Bohbobidoboh hidden in Faffy's bedroom.

In the episode "[[The Terror of Mecha-Dave]]", Dave fears he has been brainwashed to act like a bully by Chuckles the Silly Piggy.

In the episode "The Way of the Dave", [[Candy Barbarian|Candy]]'s quest for an ultra-trendy antler hat takes her outside of the kingdom and in direct conflict with Chuckles the Silly Piggy.

In the episode "[[Termites of Endearment]]", Vermites destroy Dave's boutique only to find out that they are being controlled Chuckles who has has form alliance with the Vermites Queen.

In the episode "[[The Princess and the Peabrains]]", Candy makes her friends princess while she haves fun and all. Meanwhile, Chuckles and his kind nephew are planning to take over Udrogoth (not to mention that his nephew doesn’t want to be a Dark Lord what he really wants to be The Harvest Hog).

In the episode "Night of the Living Plush", Chuckles discovers that Candy needs plush toys, and disguises himself as a piggy doll. After Candy buys him and takes him home, she immediately leaves and buys more. Meanwhile Chuckles, using his amulet creates an army of plush animals, in an attempt to conquer Udrogoth.

In the episode "Shake, Rattle, & Roll Over", Dave decides to get Faffy trained, so Chuckles disguises himself as a dragon trainer in order to steal the magical Combat Rattle.

In the episode "A Pig's Story", Chuckles has a plan that can't fail; he kidnaps the Storyteller and forces him to read narration in which Dave loses! Chuckles soon finds himself not only Master of the World, but also the new star of "Dave the Barbarian", which has been renamed "The Dark Lord Chuckles the Silly Piggy Will Destroy You All Variety Hour." But when the Storyteller gets laryngitis, it looks like the winner will be whoever can find the best new narrator.

In the series finale "[[Happy Glasses]]", when Chuckles sets to defeat Dave once again, he invents glasses that make whoever is wearing it see the world the way they really want it to be like. Chaos is started when the glasses are worn by [[Fang Barbarian|Fang]], [[Oswidge]], [[Candy]], [[Faffy]] and [[Dave]].

*The name of Chuckles' amulet, The Mystic Amulet of HogSwineBoar is named so because hogs, swine, and boars are all synonyms for the word 'pig')
*Whenever Chuckles laughs he talks in the middle then continues to laugh.
