'''Jaeger Clade''' is a character from the upcoming [[2022]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Strange World]]''. He is no simple farmer like his son; he is more of a larger-than-life explorer.

== Biography ==
=== Official Description ===
{{Quote|Jaeger Clade is Searcher’s larger-than-life explorer father. He has long dreamed of venturing beyond the mountain ranges that surround Avalonia. His dream became an obsession he never lost sight of—even when a major misstep landed him in a strange world far from his family. The one-and-only Jaeger just wants to leave a legacy... He's like one of those guys on the covers who wear white shirts that were ripped fighting an alligator. He is an awesome character. But what if that guy was your dad? That seems way less awesome.|Qui Nguyen describing Jaeger<ref>[https://whatsondisneyplus.com/strange-world-inside-scoop-on-the-characters-environments/ Strange World: Inside Scoop On The Characters & Environments]</ref>}}

=== Early life ===
According to the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], Jaeger was stuck on Avalonia for a long time so he grew a long beard and sported a spear. He eventually goes back to normal when he soon grows just a mustache.

== Trivia ==
* He bears a very close resemblance to famous Hollywood actor [[Sam Elliott]].
