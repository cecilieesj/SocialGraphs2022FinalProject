== History ==

Skip Dockmonkey was a skipper for the [[Jungle Navigation Company]] during the [[1930]]<nowiki/>s where he was known for his sense of humour and recklessness.<ref>https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/08/dateline-adventureland-hunting-for-laughs-with-skip-and-birdwatching-with-tiki-kiki/</ref>  These assets made him a recipricantt of the Piranhahaha Juju at the Adventure Trading Company.  On occasion, Skip also worked as a journalist for ''The Daily Gnus'' newspaper, namely when the boats ''The Mekong Maiden'' and ''The Magdalena Maiden'' went missing.



However, Skip briefly lost his job at the Jungle Navigation Company when he lost a shipment of rare, "Elephant Jujus" being transported for the Adventure Trading Company.  Skip managed to get his job back when he taught aspiring Adventure Trading Company members skipper humour to persuade the managers to give him back his job.  Around [[1938]], Skip worked within the headquarters of the JNC which had been turned into the, "Skipper Canteen" by JNC president [[Alberta Falls]].

By around the [[1940]]<nowiki/>s, Skip got promoted to the position of manager for the Jungle Navigation Company.  Between then and [[1960]], he was put in-charge of managing the ''Enchanted Tiki Bar'' of JNC affiliate [[Trader Sam]] in Polynesia.  Skip also assisted Sam in opening up the Grog Grotto, a sister-location for the Enchanted Tiki Bar allocated near a Polynesian Village along the [[Seven Seas Lagoon]] and Nanea volcano.
