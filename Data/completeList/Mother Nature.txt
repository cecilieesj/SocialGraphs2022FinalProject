== Appearances ==

=== ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'' ===
Mother Nature is first seen at a meeting of the Council of Legendary Figures held at the [[North Pole]]. She votes no on a name change for the Tooth Fairy and listens as [[Scott Calvin|Santa]] tells them that [[Charlie Calvin|Charlie]] got on the naughty list and his dilemma of staying at the North Pole and dealing with Charlie.

She later serves as the officiate at Santa's wedding to [[Carol Newman-Calvin|Carol Newman]].

=== ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'' ===
Mother Nature is called to an emergency meeting at the North Pole after [[Jack Frost]] puts signs around 270 malls in the Northwest saying "Merry Frostmas!". She proposes disciplinary action against Jack for attempted upstaging of Santa and violating the Legendary Figures code of conduct. Instead, Santa agrees to Jack's idea of learning under Santa and helping out around the North Pole rather than a suspension. Mother Nature allows the motion to pass, and Jack is placed under the direction of [[Curtis (Santa Clause)|Curtis]].

She is later summoned to the North Pole by Charlie to help the elves build the toys because they are behind schedule. After [[Lucy Miller|Lucy]] reveals that Jack Frost froze her parents, Santa asks Mother Nature to help thaw them, but she declines, saying that her powers do not work on the magic of other Legendary Figures. She watches as Lucy hugs Jack, warming his heart and making him good.
