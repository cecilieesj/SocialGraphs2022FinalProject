The '''Spider''' is a minor character in Disney's [[1948]] movie, ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]''.

==Role in the film==
The Spider appears somewhere during the song ''[[Stick-to-it-ivity]]'' when being observed by the historical Scottish King Robert Bruce while trying again and again to build a web until he succeeds when Robert doubts his web efforts to the last minute, singing the song after his web success, and performing a traditional Highland sword dance on Robert Bruce's sword, therefore, encouraging the king to pick up his sword and return to battle again after facing defeat twice by the English, which finally leads to his victory based on a true historical Scottish event.

==Trivia==
*In the real historical event, Robert Bruce witnessed the spider's web efforts done 3 times in a mountain cave on top of him and the spider was in fact a female, thus, encouraging the king to fight for the 7th time against the English.
*The spider bears a strong resemblance to [[Grumpy]].
