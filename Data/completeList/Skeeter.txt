'''Skeeter''' is a female athletic Muppet who originated from the animated series ''Muppet Babies'' as [[Scooter]]'s tomboyish twin sister. Unlike the other babies, Skeeter was created specifically for ''Muppet Babies'' as an addition for the show's female figure [[Miss Piggy]]. With Miss Piggy being the only major female character in ''The Muppet Show'' cast, Skeeter was introduced to balance Piggy's ultra-feminine role.

Like many female Muppets, Skeeter was performed by male actors. [[Howie Mandel]] voiced the character for the first two seasons of ''Muppet Babies'', after which [[Frank Welker]] took over the role. In the reboot version, she is voiced by [[Cree Summer]], making it the first time she was ever voiced by a female.

== Background ==

===Personality===
Skeeter is energetic, gutsy, and spirited but, at times, can be a bit of a show-off. Skeeter and her brother Scooter would occasionally show signs of sibling rivalry in the nursery, with Skeeter often calling her brother a "nerd." While Skeeter often expressed interest in being an athlete and/or gymnast, her brother was more interested in computers and books.

Despite her tomboyishnesss, she had a rivalry with Miss Piggy, where they would often fight for the feminine roles.

==Later appearances==
After ''Muppet Babies'', Skeeter made few appearances in Muppet-related media. In ''MuppetZine'' issue 3 (1993), ''Muppet Babies'' storyboard director Scott Shaw wrote:

:''"As for the adult Skeeter, Henson Associates art director Michael Frith once explained that she's now a famous explorer, never seen again after an expedition to the jungles of the Amazon!"''

When asked in 2009, "Whatever happened to Skeeter?", Muppet writer Jim Lewis said:

:''"Ahh, Skeeter. I wasn't there for the creation of the "Muppet Babies" animated series, but I suspect she was added to the show so there'd be another (dare I say, more balanced than Baby Piggy) female character on a show aimed at kids. We threw around various bizarre scenarios about what happened to Skeeter after "Muppet Babies," but none of these were ever confirmed. Frankly, I suggest contacting the Federal Witness Protection Program for more info. Let us know what you find out."'' <ref>[http://articles.muppetnewsflash.com/2008/03/ask-jim-lewis.html Ask Jim Lewis]</ref>

In an interview with Kermit the Frog on the Disney podcast [[Inside the Magic]] #468, he explained that Skeeter's been on meditative retreat since becoming a Buddhist. <ref>http://www.insidethemagic.net/podcasts/468/</ref>

Baby Skeeter appeared on a season 2 episode of ''[[Muppet Babies (2018 series)|Muppet Babies]]'' episode along with her brother scooter.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgORhVtWdeM</ref>

===''Family Reunion''===
Skeeter appears in ''The Muppet Show Comic Book'' during the "Family Reunion" story arc, written by Roger Langridge and illustrated by [[Amy Mebberson]]. Initially, the dialogue throughout the four-part story avoids using her name. Langridge cites that an arrangement was made between [[Boom! Studios]] and Disney, and the character is referred to as "Scooter's sister" in the story. (She finally signs a letter at the end of the story, as "Skeeter.") Much like her role on ''Muppet Babies'', she has a complicated relationship with [[Miss Piggy]]; in one moment she appears to extend an olive branch, but in the same beat, plants an immature sign on Piggy's back. During her time at [[the Muppet Theater]], she affectionately refers to Scooter as a nerd, manipulates [[Andy and Randy Pig]] as pawns in a practical joke on Piggy, takes a misplaced interest in [[Robin the Frog|Robin]]'s well-being, and poses as [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]]'s girlfriend. As the story comes to a close, Skeeter heads back to college to finish her degree in archaeology, while also revealing that she is Agent X, an assistant for world-famous detective Wormwood Soames.

In a recent interview with ToughPigs.com, Langridge mentioned that he was talking about having Skeeter return for one of the story arcs.

Adult Skeeter also makes a number of background cameos in ''[[Muppet Sherlock Holmes]]'', as well as a brief cameo in the background of an illustration in ''[[Green and Bear It]]''.

In 2011, Amy Mebberson stated that she is "determined to re-establish Skeeter as [a member of the Muppet] canon if it kills me."<ref>[http://amymebberson.tumblr.com/post/13225108585/concept-comic-strip-for-mini-muppets-yes-i-am "Concept comic strip for 'Mini Muppets'" post on Amy Mebberson's Tumblr]</ref>
