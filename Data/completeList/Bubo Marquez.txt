'''Bubo Marquez''' is a deleted character from the [[2021]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''. He was originally [[Isabela Madrigal]]'s love interest, before being replaced by [[Mariano Guzmán]].

The directors said they removed him because they felt he was too cliched and unlikable. Many people even commented that he is the continuation of the ‘hot girl, dorky guy’ trope which some are considering a toxic, unrealistic message that has been peddled to audiences for decades.

He was seen in the ''Isabela Goes Into The Woods'' scene. He was described as a city man who was kicked out from his family for being too nerdy, and had a modern look that contrasted with the traditional feel of the Encanto villagers. He would of brought a comedic tone to his scenes including him with a fish-out-of-water vibe and his dorky personality.

<u>YouTube video Description</u>: "When Mirabel sees her sister head for apparent danger in the woods, she races to save her, and encounters the surprise of a lifetime!"

Uploaded to YouTube by ''Antoine Harrak'', the deleted scene introduced by heads of story Jason Hand and Nancy Kruse sees Mirabel follow Isabela into the woods after she catches Isabela, the eldest sibling of the family, eventually sneaking out. After seeing a mysterious figure grab her sister, Mirabel chases the pair down in a tense sequence, believing her sister has been attacked by what appears to be a wild animal, only to discover it is a pretty small man called Bubo Marquez. Isabela checks to see if Bubo is hurt, before kissing the man as Mirabel watches in disgust. Isabela asks Mirabel to go home and not tell Abuela Alma (Botero), with Mirabel discovering her sister planned to leave with Bubo.
