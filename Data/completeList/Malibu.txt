'''Malibu''' is a [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] in the [[Labyrinth Clan]]. He is the clone of [[Brooklyn]]. 

==Background==
===History===
[[Thailog]] and [[Demona]] commissioned [[Anton Sevarius|Dr. Anton Sevarius]] to create Malibu as a part of their clone clan. Sevarius and Thailog aged Malibu to his peak physical age, leaving him radically discolored. Demona named him, and Thailog programmed him simply to "obey Thailog." Like the rest of the clones, Malibu was sent against the [[Manhattan Clan]], but he was defeated. Talon adopted the clones, and planned to teach them to think for themselves and "to use verbs."

When Thailog stormed the Labyrinth, Malibu quickly succumbed to his will. He and his clan-mates held [[Claw]] at bay, then departed to [[Castle Wyvern]] to reclaim [[Delilah]]. At the castle, Malibu battled the Manhattan clan until Delilah proposed that each cloned gargoyle decide for itself whether to reaffirm its allegiance to the [[Labyrinth Clan]] or to return to Thailog's control. Malibu decided to stay with Delilah in the Labyrinth.

===''The Goliath Chronicles''===
<small>Note: this section is not canonical, as the current comics series invalidate the history.</small>

In the Goliath Chronicles, Malibu contracted a degenerative virus that was supposedly the result of a flaw in the cloning process. The Manhattan Clan brought the Clone Clan to Dr. Sevarius for help, but he tricked them into chasing after an escaping Thailog, and, while doing so, Malibu petrified. His statue was placed atop a building, awaiting the time when a cure for their condition can be found.

==Characteristics==
Malibu looks much like Brooklyn, but the artificial aging changed his coloration, giving him teal skin, red-and-white wings, blackish-green hair, red eyes, black teeth, and a white mouth. His brow ridges are also more pointy than Brooklyn's. He sounds like Brooklyn when he speaks as well. Malibu's eyes glow red, not white, as most male gargoyles' do.

==Notes==
*Malibu was named by Demona after the famous "surf and sand" division of Los Angeles as a way to contrast with Brooklyn's name and express, in her opinion, the ridiculousness of Brooklyn's name choice.
