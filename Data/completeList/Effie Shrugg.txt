'''Effie Shrugg''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is an intimidating, yet intellectual 8-9 year old who befriends [[Pepper Ann Pearson]], but hides a malicious intent actions to further her status in life.

==Background==
Effie Shrugg, based on her appearance in "[[Effie Shrugged]]", is an 8 years and 11 month old girl who skipped several grades due to her mass intellect. Being a child prodigy, she gained a respect for the works of Charles Dickens and Charles Darwin, the latter of whom influenced her beliefs. She eventually became a student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] and befriended [[Pepper Ann Pearson]]. Finding her being something of an outcast, Effie immediately took her under her wing before revealing her belief in "survival of the fittest" and her bullying tendencies. Horrified, especially when she goes after her friends, Pepper Ann convinced her to "evolve" into something better. Just as she achieved this realization, Effie is accepted into an Ivey League college to achieve her dream of being an attorney.

Effie reappears, in spirit form, in "[[A Valentine's Day Tune]]" as the spirit that forewarns Pepper Ann that she will be haunted by the spirits of Valentine's Day past (Stan "The Cookie" Cookerstein), present ([[Brenda (Pepper Ann)|Brenda]]) and future (Vera Groober-Schwartz).

===Personality===
Effie gives the impression of being rather monotone and disinterested, but in actuality is very intelligent and highbrow. She is willing to be very comforting and supportive, but only to those that she deems as worthy. She has a rather malicious side, as she considered bullying a necessary action to achieve a high status among her peers. However, she can be dealt with via intellectual conversations and was able to see the error of her ways when Pepper Ann called her out on her belief. Overall, she is very passionate about her gifts and abilities.

===Physical appearance===
