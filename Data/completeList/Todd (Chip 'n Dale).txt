==Appearances==
===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===
Todd is the none-too-smart son of [[Mrs. Sweeney]]. He would like nothing better than to impress his mother by acquiring as many wild birds as possible to fill his mother's pies. He's pretty much a pretty much a full-grown adult man, but acts more like a little naive boy and even dresses like one. Due to his lack of smarts, though, he often turns up the magnetism on his mother's solar-powered electromagnet to high levels who told him not to. Because of this, Mrs. Sweeney often berates him for risking exposure to the authorities. 

==Trivia==
*Todd is named for [[Wikipedia:Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]], the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
