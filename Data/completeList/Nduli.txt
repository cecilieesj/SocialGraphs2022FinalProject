Nduli was the member of Makuu's Float, until the guard woke him and the rest of the float up, which caused him to disobey their leaders orders and go and search for their own water, and thinks that the spot Makuu picked was horrible and after being told to leave if Kiburi doesn't like it, he instead calls for a mashindano to become leader but luckily, was unable to defeat Makuu.
