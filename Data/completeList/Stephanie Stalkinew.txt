'''Stephanie Stalkinew'''<ref>[https://photo.kidzworld.com/images/2016517/4bf29893-327f-4446-a76a-9816ddd029d8/zootopia-stephanie-stalkinew.jpg Name seen on poster]</ref> is a character who appears in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''.

==Background==
Stephanie is one of the original fourteen missing mammals. Not much of her personality is known other than living in Zootopia, as it is shown that she was put in savage mode caused by the side effects done by the [[night howlers]].

While the actual Stephanie was seen as one of the predator animals that have gone savage, her model was reused for one of the incidental protesters led by [[Gazelle]]'s peace rally, despite being in a savage state at the time.

==Role in the film==
Stephanie is shown as one of the predators seen on [[Chief Bogo]]'s bulletin map when [[Judy Hopps]] attends her first day at the [[Zootopia Police Department|ZPD]]. Eventually, Judy and [[Nick Wilde]] find Stephanie who was held captive at the [[Cliffside Asylum]] where she and all the other missing mammals have gone savage where the predators are transferred to another hospital, alongside a police raid occurring inside.

While the actual Stephanie is seen in savage mode, her model was reused during the breaking news of a peace rally led by [[Gazelle]] for an unnamed leopard. She is seen protesting with Gazelle and the other predators to provide peace and justice for the predators to which as she protests holding a sign reading "Pred pride!" in front of an angry mob of rioting animals, a rioting pig confronts her, telling her to return to the '''forest''' to leave the prey alone, which made the protester defensive, denying to him saying that she is from the '''savanna''', much to Judy trying to stop the argument between the two protesters while Gazelle comments about Zootopia in a state of disaster.

Near the end of the film, a photo of Stephanie can be briefly seen on [[Doug (Zootopia)|Doug]]'s transit map.

Following [[Bellwether]]'s arrest when a cure for the [[Night howlers|night howler]] sickness is developed, it is likely that Stephanie and the rest of the savage predators have been cured following the night howler business shutting down.

==Trivia==
*Stephanie's last name is likely a pun on "stalking you", referring to a leopard stalking its prey.
*Stephanie's model was used again in the ''[[Zootopia+]]'' episode, "[[Dinner Rush]]" for one of the incidental customers, a mother leopard and her three cubs. However, it is unclear if that leopard is really Stephanie or not.
