When used by someone, it will actually seem as if that person disappeared for one decade. Luckily, he has a reset button that will bring the time traveler back to the original time they started in.

==Background==
===Personality===
Rather than being a troublesome experiment, Skip is rather wobbly and clumsy and enjoys exploring his surroundings. He is also surprisingly happy-go-lucky and easygoing, often smiling and not caring about being confined. Unlike most of his cousins, he doesn't cause trouble on purpose, but tends to cause unforeseen consequences when someone activates his powers. He seems slightly dazed at times, not paying attention to what others are saying and not being observant of his surroundings.

===Physical appearance===
Skip is a plump, purple hourglass-shaped experiment with a large head, on top of which is two green dots forming the button to activate his power. He has small white eyes with black pupils, a red nose, and a wide mouth.

===Powers and abilities===
Skip can transport himself and anyone near him ten years into the future each time his button is pressed; they will also age ten years with each "skip". However, the people who travel with him will be absent during the ten years skipped. Luckily, Skip also has a reverse setting that sends him and his user back to the present day by pressing his button while he's upside down.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 089 was the 89th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was originally designed to skip time ahead by ten minutes (because Jumba was too impatient to wait for his microwave to reheat his leftovers), but there was an error in his programming; when the button on 089's head was pressed, he instead skipped ahead ten years. 089 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point, Experiment 089 was activated and then taken in by the [[Aloha Animal Rescue|dog shelter]].

When [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] went to visit the pound and asked the [[Susan Hegarty|dog pound lady]] if there had been any new "dogs" brought here lately, the latter presented 089 to Lilo. She then adopted 089 from the dog shelter and took him back to [[Lilo's House|her house]]. After [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] explained 089's powers to Lilo, she named him Skip. Having grown tired of childhood restrictions, Lilo used the experiment to skip her and [[Stitch]] ahead ten years and become a teenager.

When Lilo discovered that adolescence was much more difficult than childhood, she used Skip to flash forward another ten years and become a full-fledged adult. However, Lilo, Stitch, and Skip were sent into an alternate future where [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] was supreme ruler, with [[Kokaua Town]] renamed "Hämsterviel Ville" as his capital. Lilo was puzzled by this setback, but before she could investigate further, Stitch and Skip were captured by [[Clink]] and taken to [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], despite Lilo's best efforts to protect them.

When Lilo returned home, a tattered Jumba explained that while she and Stitch were gone for twenty years, their house was repossessed to cover unpaid parking tickets regarding [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s [[X-Buggy|dune buggy]] that Lilo had borrowed as a teen ten years from the current day. Jumba then added that since then, Hämsterviel had taken power and captured all the other experiments because Lilo and Stitch were not here to do it themselves. Unfortunately, Nani had to work for Hämsterviel to pay off any debts.

Later on, Stitch and Skip were rescued by Lilo, Jumba, and [[Pleakley]] while Gantu was distracted. Lilo then used Skip's reverse function, which Jumba revealed, to return her and Stitch to the present. After this experience, Lilo realized that being a child actually had its advantages, and that she and Stitch must continue with their experiment hunting to prevent such a horrible future from occurring again.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Skip was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 531 instead of 089.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Skip, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Skip did not participate in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], instead choosing to retreat with the weaker experiments.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.
