The pack is led by Reirei and includes her mate and pups, including Dogo and Kijana.

== History ==

=== [[The Kupatana Celebration]] ===
Reirei uses her son Dogo to gain access to the Pride Lands. Once there, she feigns naivety on the ways of the Pride Landers in an attempt to feast on all manner of foods and creatures. She manages to persuade Kion into allowing her into Kupatana, where she and her pack cause havoc before Simba orders them to leave.

=== [[Too Many Termites]] ===
Reirei and Goigoi discover some aardwolves living next door to them after being accidentally kicked out by the Lion Guard. They try to soothe Mjomba's Pack and get their guard down, but the Lion Guard arrive to right their wrong just in time, saving the aardwolves from the two jackals.

=== [[Babysitter Bunga]] ===
Reirei and her pack attack Muhimu's Herd as a training course for Dogo and Kijana, but they are quickly stopped by the Lion Guard and told by Kion to leave, which they do. They return to the Outlands and partake in some more training, and Reirei decides that her kids are ready to return to the Pride Lands.

When they reach the Pride Lands, they end up at the Watering Hole, where they find the adults relaxing. After overhearing Muhimu speak of their little ones being at Hakuna Matata Falls, the pack quickly make a move over there, leaving Goigoi to deal with the bulk of the Lion Guard.

When they reach the falls, they attack the kids while Reirei stops Bunga from interfering. But since he taught them Teke Ruka Teleza, they easily fend the jackals off. When the rest of the Guard catches up to them, Kion orders Reirei and her pack to never attack Pride Lander kids ever again to which she agrees. After seeing their numbers, the jackals flee back into the Outlands.
