'''Capitaine Chevalle''' is a character who appears in the [[2007]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.

==Background==
Chevalle is a vain pirate wearing elegant clothing.

Hailing from Marseilles, the trade capital of [[France]], Chevalle was the pirate Lord of the Mediterranean Sea. He used a golden stick and also wore a silver ring on his left hand. He also wore a purple coat and a blue waistcoat, alongside a tricorn hat he wears on his head.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
In a plan to consult the pirate lords of the [[Brethren Court]] at Shipwreck Cove to fight against [[Davy Jones]] working for [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], Chevalle and the rest of the pirate lords are present with [[Jack Sparrow]] and his crew attending under command by [[Hector Barbossa]] where all the pirate lords hand their pieces of eight to bind [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]] in a plan to fight Davy Jones under command of Lord Cutler Beckett. During a plan to fight against Davy Jones and free Calypso, Chevalle and the other pirate lords refuse to listen and fight each other in a brawl, believing Calypso is a threat to the Brethren Court. Barbossa, however, stops the fight, clarifying that it was the First Court who imprisoned Calypso, planning to release her. Jack Sparrow takes part in a speech devising a plan to fight against the [[East India Trading Company|EITC]]'s forces while Barbossa summons [[Captain Teague]] who later arrives to deal with the plan.

As Captain Teague arrives, he shows Jack's crew and the Brethren Court the Codex to which all the pirate lords vote for themselves and as [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] plans to fight against the EITC, Chevalle and the other pirate lords accept Elizabeth's request in a plan to fight against the EITC. Later when Elizabeth commands all the pirates to raise their flags to prepare for battle, Chevalle is present with the pirate lords who also raise their flags to prepare to fight against Davy Jones and the EITC under Elizabeth's command. After Davy Jones falls to his death during battle at the maelstrom and Lord Cutler Beckett is defeated for good, Chevalle and the other pirate lords celebrate their freedom from the EITC, alongside [[Tai Huang]] and his men and the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' in victory.

==Other Appearances==

===[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure]]===
In the opening cavern sequence of this ride, the skeletal corpses of the Brethren Court members can be seen sitting at a table, Chevalle being one of them. It is unknown how they died or what they were doing on [[Treasure Cove]], which lead to their apparent deaths.

==Trivia==
*Chevalle has a striking resemblance to [[Captain Hook]], a villain from the Disney film, ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''. He also resembles Ren√© Rottingham, a minor character from the novel, ''The Curse of Monkey Island''.
*Chevalle's name is derived from "Cheval", the French word for "horse".
