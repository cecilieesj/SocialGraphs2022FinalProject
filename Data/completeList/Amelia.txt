== Background ==
===Appearance===
Amelia is a tall and thin girl with long, wavy brown hair and dark green eyes.

===Personality===
Amelia is shown to be shallow and snobbish. She only showed interest in [[Ron Stoppable]] when he had his new haircut, losing that interest when he gave up the haircut. She also expressed relief when Ron stated that he wasn't a pink sloth, because a pink sloth was supposed to be her soulmate and she didn't want Ron to be her soulmate.

==Relationships==
===Romantic===
====[[Ron Stoppable]]====
Amelia has shown interest in Ron Stoppable when he did things which made him unusually popular, such is when he got a new haircut, became a notable yellow journalist, and became a millionaire from his naco royalties.

In all instances she lost interest in him as soon as he lost his popularity. She also expressed relief during the Animology craze when Ron stated that he was not a pink sloth, because a pink sloth was supposed to be her soulmate and she did not want Ron to be her soulmate.

====[[Brick Flagg]]====
Amelia had dated and dumped [[Brick Flagg]] sometime prior to Ron writing the article about Kim liking Brick.
