{{Quote|A man!|Lena's first reaction to [[Eddie Valiant]]}}
'''Lena Hyena''' is a minor character in the [[1988]] film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. She is a crazy and ugly [[Toon]] woman who [[Eddie Valiant]] encounters in [[Toontown (Who Framed Roger Rabbit)|Toontown]] after mistaking her for [[Jessica Rabbit]].

==Background==

===Personality===

===Physical Appearance===
She has pale skin, with several freckles on her face and big, unkempt red hair, which initially resembled Jessica's hairstyle. She has large green eyes, accented with shimmering lavender eye shadow and long dark eyelashes. Her nose is a rather large and slightly pointed with large nostrils. She has big lips, and wears bright red lipstick. She is missing a few teeth and the ones she has are yellow and rotten. Her body is extremely lanky and gangly. Her skinny legs are noticeably unshaven, and her bosom is very saggy. She also appears to have a very visible Adam's apple. Like Jessica, her ensemble consists of a red sequined strapless dress that reveals a lot of cleavage with a low back, sweetheart neckline, and high thigh slit, though unlike Jessica's, her slit is parted on the right side. In addition, she wears elegant purple opera gloves and large green colored stilettos. She is also revealed to wear polka dot bloomers under her dress.

==Appearances==
===''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''===
[[File:Lenaeddiekiss.jpg|thumb|left|250x|Lena kisses Eddie, much to his disgust.]]Eddie pursues Jessica into Toontown believing she just committed murder. After crashing into Jessica's vacant car, Eddie looks around and spots a silhouette of a woman resembling Jessica in an apartment window. Eddie heads inside the complex, and finds the apartment suite. After coming up to the door to the apartment, Eddie looks through the keyhole, and sees the woman pulling out a negligee from a suitcase. Thinking he has her cornered, Eddie proceeds to intercept, slowly opening the door. The woman, still holding up the negligee, turns her head slightly to see who is at the door. In an instant, the stunning woman immediately reveals herself to be an ugly toon hag named Lena Hyena. Upon seeing Eddie, Lena becomes immediately smitten, while he is utterly horrified by her appearance. Believing he has come out of romantic intent, Lena sprints towards Eddie, puckering her red lips for a kiss. At the last second, Eddie slams the door in her face before  trying to find a place to hide. Lena's lips impale the door before she effortlessly knocks it down with a single kick. She calls out to Eddie, who has escaped into a men's room, which is out of order.

Eddie discovers the restroom is non-existent leading to open-air miles high in the sky and plummets countless stories. Just as he's about to hit the street below, Lena appears out of nowhere and catches him.  With the object of her affection now within her grasp, the ugly toon has her way with him, planting a big wet kiss on his cheek, much to his disgust.  The recoil from her kiss sends Eddie flying down the street. Still madly passionate for him, she continues after him, intending to force herself on him even more. As she makes her way towards him, Eddie quickly tears a street line and places it towards a brick wall, to which she mindlessly follows, flattening upon impact.  She is seemingly knocked out by this, and isn't seen again for the rest of the film. 

===''Roger Rabbit's Toontown''===
Lena appears in the ''[[Roger Rabbit]]'s Toontown'' issue, "The Kissing Bandit" where it's revealed she's actually been a long-time friend of Jessica's. In the issue, Jessica visits her in Toontown as she's pursued by a Toon Wolf, who's overly smitten by her. He keeps confusing her for Jessica in his multiple attempts to kiss her, much to his horror. He runs away not knowing what to learn from his shenanigans. Unaware she had a cold, he instantly gets sick after kissing her so many times.

==Trivia==
[[File:Abner_Delivery_Lena'46.jpg|thumb|154px|Lena the Hyena was finally revealed in a [[1946]] drawing contest; rendition by [[wikipedia:Basil Wolverton|Basil Wolverton]].]]
*Lena has been confused with '''Lena the Hyena''', a character from the 1946 comic strip ''[[wikipedia:Li'l Abner|Li'l Abner]]'' by [[wikipedia: Al Capp|Al Capp]] as they both have near-identical names and are comically hideous. There's been a long-standing rumor that she was loosely adapted from or was, at least, referencing that character.
*Lena's scene was heavily inspired by a segment from the [[1943]] [[Wikipedia:Tex Avery|Tex Avery]] short ''[[Wikipedia:Red Hot Riding Hood|Red Hot Riding Hood]]'' where Red's Grandma chases the Wolf after he mistakes her for Red, and her attempting to kiss him. It also references the moment when he runs through a door and almost falls off a very tall apartment building.  Unlike Grandma, Lena actually succeeds in kissing Eddie.
*The scene contains references to Disney's ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''; the doorknobs on Lena's floor resemble [[The Doorknob|the one]] in the film and the graffiti on the bathroom wall reads, "For a good time, call ALLYSON "WONDERLAND", the best is yet to be."
*The fact that [[Judge Doom]] was in a nearby alley (which Eddie entered after he knocked Lena out) and didn't try to kill him (like he did in the alley), implies that if she caught him, she would have kept him till at least after midnight that night (and when Toontown legally belonged to Doom).
*Originally, when Lena kissed Eddie after saving him from the fall, she was to stick her tongue in his ear and it would come out through his other one, but that was cut because they thought it was too much.  Storyboards of her scenes also showed that her kiss was going to leave a giant lipstick mark on Eddie's cheek.
*The painting of a sunset in Lena's apartment was used in ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' as an actual sunset.
*There's a picture of a rabbit that seems to be repulsed by Lena in her apartment. Presumably the only male she was able to catch, it is often mistaken for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s cartoon star ''Screwy Squirrel''.
*The end of Lena's bed has a repulsed face on it.
