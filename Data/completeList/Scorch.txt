==Role in the series==
Scorch is a ferret who is owned by [[Cruella De Vil]], in which his mistress often takes him wherever she goes. Due to this, Scorch is often Cruella's only true line of defense when it comes to preventing the Dalmatians from foiling her schemes, which is the reason Scorch has developed a true sense of hatred toward the Dearly Dalmatians. He also has a habit of trying to eat the [[Dalmatian Puppies|puppies]]' chicken friend [[Spot Chicken|Spot]].

However, Cruella seldom acknowledges the hard work that Scorch does for her, though she does genuinely love Scorch and she does what she can to make him happy, though she also uses Scorch as a scapegoat for her failures and she enjoys abusing Scorch in order to take away her frustrations.

Despite the apparent disdain in their relationship, Scorch is a loyal pet to Cruella and she permits him to sleep on her pillow, which is a distinguishable characteristic since Cruella has animosity towards all animals, being a fashion designer and so forth. Unlike the other animals, however, Scorch doesn't communicate by using words (except for a brief moment in the episode "[[You Slipped a Disk]]" where he says, "Thank you!"), as he mostly just growls and hisses; though despite this fact, he is quite capable of communicating with other animals, as he merely remains silent because he prefers not to say words. In his spare time, Scorch likes to perform reconnaissance on the [[Dearly Farm]], as well as to look for an easy meal to steal from the vicinity, though he also enjoys being pampered by Cruella and living the good life in her mansion.

==Trivia==
*Scorch is the first De Vil pet in Disney adaptations.
*In early concepts, Scorch was originally going to be named "Scratch".
*Scorch bears some similarities to [[Felicia]] from ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', such as both being a pet to the main antagonist (Cruella for Scorch; [[Ratigan]] for Felicia), both having the same color scheme, and both wishing to eat another character (Spot for Scorch; [[Bartholomew]] for Felicia).
