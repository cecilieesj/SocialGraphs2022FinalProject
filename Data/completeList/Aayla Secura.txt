At one point, she kicked apart a battle droid while twirling her lightsaber, behind an unidentified Jedi killing a Geonosian. They were eventually cornered by droids, but were saved by Master Yoda and the Clone Army. Secura fought in the following battle, and is seen fighting alongside [[Kit Fisto]]. She also made an advance on a Core Ship near the end of the battle. Secura was made a general in the Clone Wars.

===''Revenge of the Sith''===
Aayla is first seen meeting with [[Mace Windu]], [[Yoda]], Ki-Adi-Mundi, and Clone Commander [[Cody (Star Wars)|Cody]]. While on Felucia with her clone troopers, Chancellor Palpatine ordered the execution of Order 66 after he was revealed to be the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious. Her clones pointed their blasters at her and began to fire, killing her before even hitting the ground. Even when she fell to the ground, they continued to pummel her with laser blasts.

===''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''===
Aayla's voice, along with several other Jedi of the past, gives encouragement to [[Rey]] so she can defeat and destroy [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] once and for all.

==Television Appearances==

Aayla appeared as a supporting character in some episodes. In one episode, she is stranded on a neutral planet with Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Captain Rex, and Commander Bly.

Aayla appears as a walk around character at [[Star Wars Weekends]]. Additionally her actress, Amy Allen, appeared to sign autographs at some of the events over the years.

==Trivia==
*In ''Star Wars'' Legends, prior to the Clone Wars, Aayla began a romantic relationship with Jedi Master [[Kit Fisto]]. However, the relationship didn't last very long due to the fact that she was far more dedicated to the Jedi Order then she was to Kit. She decided that the order was more important than her relationship with Kit, though they would still have romantic feelings for each other.
