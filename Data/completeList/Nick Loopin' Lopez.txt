==Background==
===Official Description===
By 1978, Nick “Loop’n” Lopez was America’s favorite helicopter cop, featured on TV’s CHoPs, a show about two California Helicopter Patrol choppers. Nick, the troublemaking macho young officer, got the nickname “Loop’n” from his signature inside loop, which no other helicopter could perform.<ref>[http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2014/03/10/meet-the-characters-from-planes-fire-rescue/ Meet the Characters from Planes: Fire & Rescue]</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]''===
In ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', Nick appears in an episode of ''[[CHoPs]]'' that [[Dusty Crophopper]] and all of the firefighters except [[Blade Ranger]] were watching called "''Disco Inferno''", where he helps Blazin' Blade to catch a criminal named Chuck Shocks and save a female car named Pinta from a burning studio. Afterward, Sergeant "Rhodey" Rhodes Graeter tells him and Blade that they did a good job, and Nick states to Blade that Pinta has a sister named Peggy.

While Blade was being repaired after he got injured upon protecting [[Dusty Crophopper|Dusty]] from a fire, [[Maru]] tells Dusty that Nick was killed in a severe accident during the filming of ''CHoPs''<nowiki>'</nowiki> 139th episode caused by a cross-breeze and Blade was unable to save Nick in time, resulting in the show being canceled, and Blade to quit his job as an actor and train under [[Mayday]] and later move to [[Piston Peak National Park]].

==Trivia==
*"''CHoPs''" is a parody of ''CHiPs'', a real TV show that Nick's actor Erik Estrada starred in as highway patrolman Francis "Ponch" Poncherello.
**Nick and Blazin' Blade Ranger have the exact same helmets as Estrada and Larry Wilcox in the show ''CHiPs''.
**Coincidentally enough, ''CHiPs'' was cancelled after 139 episodes due to low ratings.
**Earlier in the show's run Erik Estrada was injured in a severe accident and sat out a few episodes. However, unlike Nick, who perished, Estrada actually eventually survived and recovered from that accident, which is why he is there to voice Nick today.
**Nick is based on Ponch from the original show personality wise.
*Originally, Nick was called Loopin' Lance Gyro.
