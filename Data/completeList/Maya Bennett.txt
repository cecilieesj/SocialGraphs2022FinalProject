==Story==
===The Suite Life on Deck===
In "My Oh Maya", Zack fell in love with Maya. However, his usual flirting ways does not work with Maya, and so he uses [[Cody Martin|Cody]]'s six month plan to win her heart. Zack starts a Kettlecorn Mulch Festival, hoping Maya will get reminded of home and be Zack's girlfriend, but does not like it at all and stomps on Zack's foot. Cody suggests Zack befriend Maya to start with before developing into lovers. At the end of this episode, Maya agrees and they became friends.

In "Das Boots", Zack, Maya, [[London Tipton|London]], and [[Woody Fink|Woody]] are trapped in London's shoe submarine. When they learn that they only have 30 minutes of air left, Zack tells Maya that he wants to be more than just friends. She confesses that she likes Zack more than a friend as well. However, once they are saved from the submarine and Zack asks her out on a date, Maya refuses, and says that she confessed because of "lack of oxygen".

In "Party On!", Maya tells Zack that her birthday is soon so he makes a party for her. However, while she is convinced that the party is hers, it was actually for London and Mr. Moseby as well. At the near end, she figures out the truth, and is touched by Zack that he is willing to go through so much trouble for her. She then kisses Zack and they become a couple.

In "Love and War", Maya and Zack start dating. The boys tell Zack that he will be having to change his ways for Maya. Zack does not believe them then, but Maya hints Zack on his status still being "single", and that he should change it to 'in a relationship' to which Zack obliges. Later, Zack has to travel between the guys and Maya, for he has promised Cody and Woody he'd be there for the game, and also Maya that he'd be there when she recites her poem. At the end, Zack gets caught by Maya and she tells him that he does not have to change for her.

As mentioned in "Senior Ditch Day", she has been sick. Maya is also mentioned in "My Sister's Keeper", while meeting Willa, Zack becomes attracted, but Cody tells him that he's "in relationship". Maya is also mentioned several times in "Twister" during the episodes Zack was looking for a nice gift for her because it was close the day of their 3 month anniversary.
