== Appearances ==

=== ''[[Three Blind Mouseketeers]]'' ===
They are the titular characters of the short. They are first seen chanting upon themselves with their catchphrase, "all for one and one for all"!, then subsequently going to get cheese.

Unknown to them, but there enemy for many years, Captain Katt has set mouse traps within cheese he has left out. However, all three evade the traps that he set out, eating the cheese with a toast with wine, the corks hitting and waking Katt up.

With Katt chasing them upon him waking up, he flees upon seeing many mice together with one of them (in reality it is only the mouseketeer's reflection), causing Katt to run away, bringing celebration with themselves with wine.
