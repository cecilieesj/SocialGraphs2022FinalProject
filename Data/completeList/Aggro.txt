'''Aggro '''is the secondary antagonist in the third season of ''[[Miles from Tomorrowland]] ''and the second-in-command of [[Silas|Commander Nemex]]. He usually aids Nemex in his plans of stealing all of the Tomorrowland Transit Authority's technology and conquering the universe, but most of his ideas end up thwarted by [[Miles Callisto]] and [[Mission Force One|company]]. He is usually the one Nemex blames for Nemesystems' failures, even if it wasn't his fault at all! Though he sees himself as a hero, he is mainly a bumbling fool, though he is even smarter than his commander at times.
