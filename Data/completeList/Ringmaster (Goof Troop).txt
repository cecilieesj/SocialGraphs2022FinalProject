The '''Ringmaster''' is a one-time character and the main antagonist of the episode "[[Three Ring Bind]]" from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]'s animated series, ''[[Goof Troop]]''.

==Background==
==='''Physical Appearance'''===
The Ringmaster is a tall and slender anthropomorphic dog with tan skin, six freckles in his face, half bald with brown hair, a brown nose, a thin mustache, thick black eyebrows, and wears a very tall red hat with a black stripe, white opera gloves, black boots, almond cream pants, a red suit coat with golden epaulets and golden buttons on front and back, a red bowtie, a white tuxedo with two black buttons and a purple shirt.

==Role in the episode==
At the beginning of the episode, after [[Pete]] promises [[P.J.]] and [[Max Goof|Max]] to take [[Pistol Pete|Pistol]] into a real circus, P.J. knocks on the Ringmaster's ticket window and he said that the circus was closed because of Pistol. Max knocks on his window again and he said there was no circus and not closed, but they're always to be closed from this moment on. He asked and told Pistol, P.J. and Max that if they're not out of here in ten seconds, he's going to have Giblet the Clown sit on them. He threatens to turn a group of Pistol's circus animals (including Kitty the lion, Annie the elephant, Kong the monkey, Puppy the seal, and Boris the bear) into puppy chow. After Pistol freed the circus animals, the Ringmaster and Giblet the Clown followed them in hot pursuit. When the circus truck was accidentally crashed over a bridge, her animals helped Pistol to safety.

Having overheared The Ringmaster and Giblet's plot to turn the animals into puppy chow, Pete stood up to the Ringmaster by grabbing him by the suit and warning him that he is not gonna turn the animals that saved Pistol into dog food, and shoving his money into the Ringmaster's mouth. He told the Ringmaster that they are now his animals, ordering him to get his cage and his truck out of his sight, but the Ringmaster reminded him that his truck was down in the moat after spitting the money out. Pete kicked both him and Giblet in their butts and send them falling off a bridge and into the moat below. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards.
