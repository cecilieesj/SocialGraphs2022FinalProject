'''Shansa''' is a character who appears in the film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''. She is a mysterious witch who helps others find hidden information about difficult tasks.

==Background==
Shansa was rumored to have used supernatural characteristics to help others find hidden information (for instance, she helps [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] about the information about the [[Trident (Hercules)|Trident of Poseidon]] whom [[Captain Salazar|Salazar]] is dying to seek for to take revenge against [[Jack Sparrow]]). Despite having a mysterious nature, Shansa was worried when Barbossa plans to look for treasure as she might feel worried about Salazar's plan.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''===
When [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] receives urgent messages from Murtogg and Mullroy about the pirate fleets being sunk by [[Captain Salazar]], he enters a dark passage and pays some treasure to the prison guard to get help from a witch to whom the witch he is facing is Shansa. Shansa offers Barbossa some tea for him to which Barbossa decides to take it as a pass. Shansa explains whenever someone meets her, they have to pay the witch. Barbossa then tells Shansa that he even saved her from the gallows before she died just as she warns Barbossa that he will come in fear of her as Salazar's undead crew have taken command of the sea. Shansa then warns that Captain Salazar is not looking for Barbossa, but rather [[Jack Sparrow]]. She explains that Jack will search for the [[Trident (Hercules)|Trident of Poseidon]] with [[Carina Smyth]] aboard the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. While Barbossa explains that the trident is not on the treasure map, Shansa tells him that the Trident of Poseidon is Jack's only hope as the undead crew is destroying the sea. She then warns Barbossa if retiring to a countryside is worth retiring for to which he decides to remain in his position as a pirate instead. Asking Shansa about this, she explains that Jack held his compass who would help Barbossa find treasure and should he betray Jack, Barbossa would face his greatest fear - Captain Salazar. Asking of how Shansa found Jack's compass, she explains to help Jack find the Trident of Poseidon and the treasure will come back to him. Afterwards, Barbossa makes a deal with Shansa to help Jack.

Later, Shansa is later brought to the prison cell where Carina was held captive where Lieutenant Scarfield tells her about Salazar's plan to find Jack Sparrow who saved Carina Smyth from being hung after being accused for illegal witchcraft. Scarfield asks Shansa to help the marines but Shansa warns him that ships are burned at nighttime due to Salazar's evil plans. [[Scarfield]] then urges Shansa to read what is on the wall before she is sentenced to be killed to know where Jack is going. Shansa then tells the marines that their destiny should be followed through the stars to follow the ''Dying Gull''. Her further fate is unknown.

==Trivia==
*Shansa is the second character to be a witch in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series; the first is [[Tia Dalma]].
*Shansa was inspired by the Sea Widow, a character who was only in Terry Rossio's original script for the fifth film. However, for the final version of the film, the Sea Widow was replaced by Captain Salazar. Interestingly, both of them are main villains seeking revenge against Jack Sparrow.
