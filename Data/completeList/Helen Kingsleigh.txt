As Alice returns from Asia to London, she happily reunites with her mother. As a nearby head manager named James Harcourt approaches Alice's family, Alice explains that she encountered complications on the way back from Asia to London as Harcourt explains to Alice that Lord Ascot passed away while she was at sea. Back at home, Alice talks with her mother about Hamish's proposition to which she explains that Hamish has been married last year. She and her daughter arrive at the Ascots' residence and encounter Hamish who is now married with Alexandra as the new Lady Ascot. Hamish offers Alice to retire the vessel in order to redeem the house to which Alice refuses much to Alice's mother noticing her daughter's refusal. During an argument, Alice is told that she must face the changes the company will do to the ''Wonder'', warning her that [[Time]] is going against her and Alice is not using time management properly, to which Alice refuses and ends up in a sorrowful mood about her argument instead of accepting the changes the company will do with the ''Wonder'' with Time being an obstacle to Alice.

She next appears when Alice ends up in the asylum explaining to her that she has been acting strangely to which Alice escapes from Dr. Bennet and a group of workers and into the Ascots' residence so she can use the [[Chronosphere]] in a plan to save [[Tarrant Hightopp]]'s life.

Later when Alice returns to the real world after reuniting Tarrant with his missing family, Hamish and Harcourt tell Helen to sign the deed immediately to which Alice explains that Time is not an enemy, telling her mother to do so, saying that the ''Wonder'' doesn't matter because she loves her mother more. After Hamish insults Alice by calling her headstrong and dubbing her as "everyone's clock", she tells him off by saying that he's not a nice man and that she's glad Alice rejected his proposal. Helen takes the contract and rips it in half and tells Hamish that Alice can do whatever she decides to choose and ''so'' can she and bids them a good day. Though having lost the house, Helen is able to start a new life and business with her daughter, in which they will run a better and more successful trading company than the Ascots, which she proclaims they will run out in a year. With Alice's company repossessed, Alice and her mother prepare to set sail once again as Harcourt joins alongside the two onboard the ''Wonder''.
