The '''Weather Toons''' are a group of [[Toon]] weather icons. They appeared in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode "[[Weather or Not (Bonkers)|Weather or Not]]".
==Role in the episode==

Originally, these five Toons worked at the weather studio, broadcasting the weather forecasts. One day, the studio noticed they were missing.

The Weather Toons staged their own disappearance to frame the people at the weather studio so they'd get arrested for kidnapping. The reason for this was because the Weather Toons knew they were capable of so much more than just weather forecasting. They had disguised themselves as a butler named Rhett and managed to lure [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]], [[Lucky Piquel|Detective Piquel]], and the weather studio into a creepy mansion. Bonkers managed to trick them, and they ended up getting rolled up in a weather map. They were later arrested for their crimes.

==Trivia==
*Toony Tornado mentions that he wanted to portray the tornado from ''The Wizard of Oz''.
