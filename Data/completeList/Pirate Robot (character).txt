'''Pirate Robot''' is an antagonist and one of the nighttime villains, but sometimes an anti-hero, in the television series ''[[PJ Masks]]''. He first appeared in the Season 5 [[Pirate Robot|titular episode of the same name]].

==History==
Pirate Robot was originally intended to be created as a chef for Romeo, who had grown tired of Robot's poor cooking. Just as Romeo had loaded the necessary components into a machine that would assemble the robot, Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos, who were playing pirate, infiltrated the Sky Factory. In the chaos that followed, Night Ninja's pirate hat fell into the machine and was accidentally added to the concoction, thus resulting in Pirate Robot's creation. Pirate Robot immediately turned on his creator and became a villain on his own right.

==Personality==
Pirate Robot acts like a stereotypical pirate. He frequently uses pirate jargon, though with a robot-related spin on the usual phrases (for example, he says "shiver me circuits" or "shiver me screwdrivers" rather than "shiver me timbers").

Like pirates, he is interested in finding treasures. Despite being created by Romeo, he has no loyalty towards his creator and ditched him quickly after his creation.

He is on friendlier terms with the PJ Masks than most other villains, and Owlette in particular admitted that she considered him funny in "Pirate Robot."

==Motives & Abilities==

===Motives===
Pirate Robot is mainly motivated by his desire to find treasures. Whenever he thinks there is a treasure to be found, he will do anything to get his hands on it.

===Powers & Abilities===
*'''Swordsmanship''': Pirate Robot is shown to be an expert swordsman with his spatula.
*'''Telescope eye''': His right eye can turn into a telescope.

==Physical appearance==
Pirate Robot wears a pirate hat with a skull and fork and knife as the crossbones and pirate boots. His pirate hat contains a chicken he names Hornswoggle that occasionally pops out stating a combination of pirate quotes and cooking instructions.
