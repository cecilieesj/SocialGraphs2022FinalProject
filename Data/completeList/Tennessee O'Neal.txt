==Role in the film==
He quit the band with the love of his life Trixie. He said that Trixie left him and started dating a panda instead ([[Fred Bedderhead]]: "What's with the pandas? They get everything."). He then tried to be a marriage counselor, but he broke down in tears over losing Trixie during his sessions with clients. Even though Tennessee agreed to rejoin the band for Beary, his anxiety attacks about seeing Trixie again nearly killed him, and revealed that Trixie didn't leave him but he broke up with her. When they reunite at last by singing a duet together and rekindle their marriage.
