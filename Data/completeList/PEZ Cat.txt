'''PEZ Cat''' is a character who appears in the [[2013]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated special, ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''. She is an anthropomorphic [[Pez]] dispenser with a cat head whom [[Jessie]] encounters at the [[Sleep Well]] motel.

==Background==
PEZ Cat, as her name implies, is a green [[Pez]] dispenser with a gray cat head wearing a pair of eyeglasses. Fearful of [[Ronald Tompkins]] and his pet iguana [[Mr. Jones]], she alerts the other toys that the coast is clear. Due to her inability to walk and her lack of arms, PEZ Cat is only capable of moving by hopping. Later when the transport to Billy's house arrives at the Sleep Well motel, she no longer feared Ron and his pet iguana.

==Role in the short==
When [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], [[Jessie]], and the rest of Bonnie's toys find themselves in a cabinet at the Sleep Well motel at [[Ronald Tompkins|Ron]]'s office, PEZ Cat alerts the other toys that the hotel manager is not there to which the toys suddenly encounter [[Combat Carl]] a couple of other toys inside the cabinet. After Combat Carl's smaller counterpart Combat Carl Jr. tells [[LEGO]] Bunny to assemble a staircase and as Carl Jr. tells PEZ Cat to know if either Ron or Mr. Jones is around to which she explains that neither one of them is present, giving Carl Jr. a chance to open the cabinet doors with the paperclip handed out by Pocketeer to which Carl Jr. was unable to unlock the cabinet doors. Seeing Ron's computer showing an eBid image of Woody on it, PEZ Cat explains to Carl Jr. that she couldn't see the image properly just before Ron returns to his office just before planning to sell Woody. Later with Woody placed into a transport box, Ron goes back to his office again where he plans to sell Jessie much to PEZ Cat having trouble looking at what Ron is doing now. However, with Jessie places outside the cabinet due to Ron talking to a tow truck manager to help him take care of a guest whose vehicle received a flat tire. PEZ Cat then tells the toys that Ron left his office again which gives Jessie the chance to open the cabinet doors but cannot reach the knob. When Jessie plans to get Woody out of the box to help her open the cabinet door, PEZ Cat notifies Jessie that there is a delivery woman entering.

Later after Jessie notices that Woody is being taken away, Combat Carl tells PEZ Cat and the other toys to think hard before Ron returns by going inside the boxes themselves as said by Jessie who is outside. However, when Jessie frees herself with a paperclip and later frees Woody from his box, the two return to Ron's office again where PEZ Cat reacts to their return along with the other toys. She then faces Mr. Jones where she manages to get Combat Carl's missing hand and as she attempts to retrieve [[Mr. Potato Head]]'s missing arm inside the iguana's mouth, PEZ Cat's reacts to it in disgust just as Jessie manages to find Mr. Potato Head's missing arm. Later when Bonnie sees the curtain leading to Ron's office being yanked off by Mr. Jones holding Jessie who is holding Mr. Potato head's arm, PEZ Cat and the other toys once again freeze (however, Mr. Potato Head manages to retrieve his missing arm back).

After [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] and [[Mrs. Anderson|her mother]] check out of the motel, and after Ron gives Bonnie her toys so that she can return home with them, PEZ Cat leaves with the rest of the other toys as they wait for the transportation to Billy's house. During the credits, PEZ Cat tells the other toys that the transport has arrived just as she escapes with the other toys as commanded by Combat Carl into the Ship It transport truck.

==Trivia==
*She is the second PEZ dispenser to appear in the ''Toy Story'' franchise; the first is [[Mutant Toys#Ducky|Ducky]]. However, Ducky is a mutant PEZ dispenser whose head is placed on another toy's body, while PEZ Cat is a normal PEZ dispenser.
*PEZ Cat has a major animation limitation based on the toy she is designed after, due to the fact that PEZ Cat herself has no arms and has a telescoping neck which she uses to see a better view.
