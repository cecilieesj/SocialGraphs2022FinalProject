|quote=
}}'''Skippy''' is a small, furry, animatronic alien creature from a species known as a Fluthmugoon Cliffhugger (scientific name Skipicanthropus Moronicus) who has appeared in two [[Magic Kingdom]] attractionsâ€” The [[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]] and [[Stitch's Great Escape!]].

== Appearances ==

===[[ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter]]===
Skippy's first and only appearance in ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter is when he is forced to demonstrate [[Tomorrowland|''Tomorrowland'']]'' Interplanetary Convention Center''<nowiki/>'s "practically painless" teleportation system. The creature's charred and disoriented appearance after being teleported a short distance across the room suggests the technology is flawed. While teleporting Skippy back across the room, [[S.I.R.]] pauses the process, demonstrating how the technology can be used to suspend subjects in teleportation indefinitely.

===[[Stitch's Great Escape!]]===
Much like its predecessor, ''Stitch's Great Escape!'' includes a demonstration of the transport system, with another comical appearance of Skippy. In this ride, the mangled Skippy is repurposed as a new character known only as the "doughnut guy", who is portrayed as being a slob and enemy of the United Galactic Federation. This allows both versions of the previous Skippy to appear at the same time.

==Video games==
Skippy makes a cameo in the mobile game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'', appearing as part of the game's representation of Stitch's Great Escape!. He appears in silhouette form in a yellow clouded teleportation tube on either side of the attraction's entrance, popping in and out every few seconds.
