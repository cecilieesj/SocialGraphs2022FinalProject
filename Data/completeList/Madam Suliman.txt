'''Madam Suliman''' is the main antagonist in the film adaptation of ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]''.

==Appearance==
Madam Suliman has platinum colored hair with mini hat and gray eyes. She has a red dress with beige fur trim along the ends. 

== Personality ==
Like other Miyazaki films, antagonists are not really evil villains. Suliman is no exception. She is clever and at times manipulative, she doesn't want to cause any harm but often has to seem antagonistic to [[Howl Jenkins Pendragon|Howl]] and that spreads to [[Sophie Hatter|Sophie]] and the others as well.

By the end of the movie, she realizes Howl has found his one true love and decides to put an end to the war.
