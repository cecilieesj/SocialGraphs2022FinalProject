}}'''Faloo '''is a character from the Disney [[1990]] movie ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', sequel to the [[1977]] film ''[[The Rescuers]]''. She is voiced by Carla Meyer, who also voiced [[Cody's Mother]] in the film.

==Role in the film==
In the movie, Faloo is a female kangaroo and a friend of Cody's and calls out to him with the warning call if an animal has been caught so he can save them. When Cody hears her calling one morning he asks her who's been caught and Faloo replies that her name is [[Marahute]] the Great Golden Eagle (an animal he didn't know). Faloo also tells Cody that he's the one who can reach her as Marahute is caught on a cliff in a poacher's trap. Cody tells her he'll get the eagle loose, and rides on Faloo's back. When they reach the cliff, Faloo tells Cody to be careful. Faloo is only seen again for a short period of time after this when Marahute swoops down after Cody rescues her and she gives Cody a ride. Faloo is seen looking up in amazement as Cody and Marahute fly off. Faloo is not seen throughout the rest of the film.

==Trivia==
*Although this is unknown Faloo might have been a lost relation or mate of another kangaroo named [[Red (The Rescuers)|Red]] who Cody meets while imprisoned at [[Percival McLeach|McLeach]]'s lair, but that remains unknown.
*In one of the book adaptations of the film, Faloo's fur is brown.
*Despite being a female Kangaroo, she lacks a pouch, probably because she has yet to give birth.
