'''Black Barty''' is a pirate who appears in the video game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''. He was voiced by [[Troy Baker]].

He appears as a meet-and-greet character along the [[Rivers of America]] in [[New Orleans Square]] and also serves as the players' guide in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' mini-game.

==Background==
Black Barty was a pirate and an enemy of [[Blackbeard]] during the 18th century. With the player's help, he goes about hunting treasure before Blackbeard can acquire it.

Black Barty came to [[New Orleans Square]] in 1817 where he was a compatriot of historic smuggler [[Jean Lafitte]]. He ended up cursed, in the modern times, and relied on the player character to do quests to help him find his way.

==Trivia==
*Black Barty was very likely made to serve as an analogue to [[Jack Sparrow]] from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series. This is evident in his design and personality, as-well as him recreating many of Jack Sparrow's positions from the ride. It is likely that the game-developers couldn't acquire rights to use actor [[Johnny Depp]]'s likeness for the game.
**Additionally, Blackbeard in this video-game heavily resembles Jack's nemesis [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] from the films with a beard not even being included in his design.
*Black Barty takes his name from historic pirate Bartholomew Roberts although they bare little-to-no resemblance to one another.
**Roberts himself was once conceived for the Pirates of the Caribbean as a character who would be featured prevalently in it and connect it with [[the Haunted Mansion]] though his (fictional) ghost of [[Captain Gore]].
**Artwork made by [[Marc Davis]] for Bartholomew Roberts would be adapted into the character of the [[Auctioneer]].
