==Background==
===Personality===
Though Lekmet only speaks in goat sounds, his personality comes through largely in his mannerisms. He shows a deep level of care for his companions and mainly serves as an observer to Rhombulus' conflict with Glossaryck.

===Physical Appearance===
Lekmet mainly bears the appearance of an anthropomorphic goat. He has pale cream fur, yellow eyes with diamond-shaped pupils, four brown horns (two pointed straight upward, two curled on the sides of his head), a long gray beard, and large bat-like wings. He wears a long brownish-gray cloak.

== Powers and abilities ==
In "[[Starcrushed]]", Lekmet is shown to possess some form of healing/restoration powers. He revives the other Magic High Commission members and restores their strength after Toffee absorbs their powers and renders them unconscious.

==Trivia==
*According to ''[[Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension]]'', Lekmet was created by [[Glossaryck]] so that Mewmans would have an understanding of the impermanence of existence.
