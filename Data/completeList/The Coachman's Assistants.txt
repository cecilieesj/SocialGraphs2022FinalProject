==Appearances==
===''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''===
While the boys enjoy themselves in the fairground area of the Island, [[the Coachman]] cracks his whip, ordering his assistants to shut and lock the main doors, preventing the unwitting boys from escaping. He then orders them to prepare crates. They are next seen loading donkeys- the naughty boys transformed -into these crates, under the Coachman's watchful eye. The donkeys are then sold as labor.

Their appearance is never completely revealed; they are shown only in shadow, save for their glowing yellow eyes, and they never speak. However, it can be discerned from the silhouette of a minion that they have arms resembling that of a gorilla; they are also whipped by the Coachman, suggesting that they are beasts. However, the fact that the Coachman refers to them as "blokes" suggests a certain amount of humanity. Their history and reasons for obeying the Coachman are unknown, and they carry out their master's orders with golem-like efficiency and obedience.

===[[Pinocchio (2022 film)|''Pinocchio'' (2022)]]===
The minions appear in the 2022 remake in the same role. In this film, they're portrayed as fog-like Shadow Monster or demon that captured boys and girls that have turned into donkeys and have them shipped off to the salt mines. 

When [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]], and [[Jiminy Cricket]] escape the island the Coachman and his goons chase them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail. 

== Trivia ==
*The Coachman's assistants do get a comeuppance in the ''Pinocchio'' Super NES video game; they are trying to prevent Pinocchio from fleeing but Pinocchio destroys them like whirling at the end of the song "[[I've Got No Strings]]".
*It is unknown if the assistants are actual black creatures, or if they are real human beings dressed in dark costumes, or possibly gorillas. In the remake, they are made of dust and can materialize and dematerialize at will. 
*One assistant had black pupils when he opened the gate when the Coachman threw Alexander into the pen where the boys still talked.
*The Coachman's assistants had no counterparts in the original story; apparently it was a one-man operation.
