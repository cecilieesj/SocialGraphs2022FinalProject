He returns alongside the rest of the Fantastic Four in the episode "The Private War of Doctor Doom". He and [[Hulk]] have a somewhat childish rivalry because Thing never beat him in a fight. He joins the New Avengers in the episode of the same name after the regular Avengers are trapped by [[Kang|Kang the Conqueror]]. Thing and the Fantastic Four assist the Avengers while battling [[Galactus]] and his heralds in the season 2 finale "Avengers Assemble".

When Spider-Man, mind-switched into Hulk's body by [[Mesmero]], ends up in town, he is attacked by Thing, who was summoned by [[Nick Fury]] to try and contain the Hulk.
