The '''Mutant Toys''' (sometimes referred to as '''Sid's Toys''') are supporting characters who appeared in the [[1995]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Toy Story]]''. They were built by [[Sid Phillips|Sid]] from mixed pieces of several toys that belonged to him and [[Hannah Phillips|Hannah]]. They live in his house, hidden in the dark corners of his room.

==Background==
<tabber>
Babyface=
{{Main|Babyface}}
Babyface is constructed with a one-eyed baby doll head attached on the top of a spider-like body made from an erector set. He is the leader of the mutant toys. He is also known as Babyhead and Spider Baby.

{{Main|Hand-in-the-Box}}
Hand-in-the-Box is a Frankenstein-like hand stuck on the spring of a musical Jack-in-the-Box that plays "Pop goes the Weasel". The spring is actually the same model as [[Slinky]]'s.

Rockmobile is a strange combination between three toys; Rocky Gibraltar, Combat Carl, and an unknown housefly/mantis hybrid. He uses the arms from Rocky's torso to walk with Carl's torso atop controlling Rocky's legless body with a steering wheel. His Carl's head was replaced by that of an unconfirmed insect.

==Role in the film==
When [[Woody]] and [[Buzz Lightyear]] first encountered them, they saw them dragging Hannah's Janie Doll and Sid's toy Pterodactyl away and the two thought they were cannibals who were going to eat them, especially when they blocked the escape route for the duo. Holding Buzz, Woody pushed the button on his back to make his arm chop to back them away as they tried to escape after Buzz realizing that his laser isn't working after aiming it at the mutant toys as he is still unaware that he is a toy. It was later hinted that they blocked the exit for the two new arrivals on account that Buzz and Woody risked encountering and getting torn apart by Scud who was just outside of Sid's room.

However, when the mutant toys later placed Buzz's severed arm back in place, as well as taping the heads of Hannah's Jane doll and Sid's toy Pterodactyl back to their correct bodies, Woody was stunned to see that they were actually quite harmless, and not cannibals as he had initially thought them to be. After Sid took Buzz (whom he had strapped his new rocket to) outside to be blown up, the mutant toys agreed to cooperate with Woody in his plan rescue Buzz from Sid's clutches while also seeing this as their own chance to get revenge on him.

Working together, they first drove Sid's dog, [[Scud]], who had stationed himself outside Sid's room, away and out onto the front porch so they could safely escape into the backyard. Once outside, they moved into their final positions, from where they emerged out, surrounding Sid, as Woody told him how much they don't like being mutilated and that they'll find out if he didn't take good care of his toys because "we toys can see everything." Woody then scared Sid away with his own voice, "So play nice," and caused him to retreat in fear of his own toys (considering everything he had done to all of them).

They all rejoiced victoriously and Buzz thanking Woody for saving him, but the celebration is cut short as Woody and Buzz witness Andy's mom's car leaving Andy's old house next door as Woody and Buzz start to leave Sid's house as the mutant toys are last seen seeing Woody and Buzz leave for Andy's car as Woody and Buzz bid farewell to the mutant toys.

==Disney Parks==
The Mutant Toys have made several non-walkaround appearances in the theme parks.

One of the games in [[DisneyQuest]]'s Create Zone was Sid's Toy Maker, which allowed guests to create their own mutant toy and purchase the parts to actually build their creation.

At [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], large statues of the Mutant Toys are installed to decorate [[Toy Story Land (Hong Kong Disneyland)|Toy Story Land]] for the Halloween season.

==Trivia==
*They are based on mutant hybrid species known as "Beast Folk" from ''The Island of Dr. Moreau''.
*Even though they technically aren't mutant toys, Hannah's Janie doll and the Pterodactyl toy were temporarily "mutated" when Sid replaced Janie's head with the Pterodactyl's in an attempt to "make her better". Both parts were separated seconds after and put back to their original places by the other mutant toys later (around the time before they fixed Buzz).
*In Episode 1 of ''Woody's Big Escape'', [[Babyface]] and Ducky were apparently renamed to "Spider Baby" and "Duck Man" for unknown reasons. Roller Bob and the Frog are the only names unchanged, despite the fact that Woody says Ducky's name in the film.
*The mutant toys had appeared in [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s room in a number of shorts in ''[[Toy Story Treats]].'' However, they are not considered to be canon since the toys belonged to Sid, and Woody, Buzz, and the others had already moved to their new home with Andy.
*In ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]'', there is a card of the mutant toys.
*None of the mutant toys can speak, and there is no given reason, although Ducky makes quacking noises, and Legs makes weakling fishing poles noises.
*The one of them named [[Shakes]] was scrapped in the movie.
