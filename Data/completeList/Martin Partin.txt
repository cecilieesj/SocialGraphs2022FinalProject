{{Quote|Ooh! Pretty impressive, isn't he?|Martin Partin}}
'''Martin Partin''' is a television host and the main antagonist in the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' episode "[[TV Dinner]]".

==Background==
===Physical Description===
Martin is a short and obese man with a large pointy nose and a wrinkled forehead. Being a host of a television show relating to wildlife, he wears a brownish-gray shirt with its sleeves rolled up along with a large pair of green pants which is tighten by a black belt. Martin also has a tortoise on his head which he uses as a hat.

===Personality===
While being recorded, Martin passes himself off as a generous man who shows strong loyalty toward wild animals, as he makes comments on how impressive the armadillo star is on every one of his performance.

However, while not on camera, Martin is revealed to be an arrogant jerk who shows no respect toward others. He constantly bullies and shouts at his cameraman Ron, even for asking him a pretty valid question about the armadillo. He also rudely turns down Shenzi, Banzai and Ed whenever they try to get involved in his documentary show.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''===
===="[[TV Dinner]]"====
Martin Partin filmed his show, ''Kingdom of the Creatures'', with an armadillo as the star. Partin's cameraman, Ronald, had doubts about armadillos shoving turkeys out of the ground with shovels and other things. However, Partin simply went with it and shouted at Ron that the armadillo was the star of the show and that he deserved a big, juicy steak for lunch. [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]] noticed the armadillo enjoying its meal and tried to join Partin's documentary show so they could have steaks too.

While Partin did the second take about how the armadillo protected himself from predators, Shenzi appeared and performed a ballet dance. Partin yelled, "Cut!" and talked to Shenzi, who tried to convince him to give her some steaks. But Partin took her down by spinning her away.

On the third take, Partin talked about what the armadillo did during the rainy season. Then BanzaiÂ appeared and performed a singing act. Partin yelled, "Cut!" again and sarcastically praised Banzai for his performance. He then abruptly turned him down like he had done to Shenzi.


On the fourth take, Partin talked about how the armadillo did not take himself seriously. Then Ed appeared and performed slapstick comedy. However, like his cohorts, he got taken down by Partin. The hyena trio then suggested that they become directors for the television show.

Later, the armadillo got a movie deal and left the Serengeti, forcing Partin to find another animal star. The host then saw the hyenas return and nervously offered them jobs as actors. However, the hyenas decided to become directors and eat Partin. With the hyenas as the show's new hosts, they made a fifth take, with Partin in a cooking pot.

It is unknown if the hyenas ate him or not, leaving him with a unknown fate.
