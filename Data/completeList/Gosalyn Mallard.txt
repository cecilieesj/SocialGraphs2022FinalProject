'''Gosalyn Mallard''' is [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]]'s adopted daughter and one of the main characters in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' TV series.

==Background==
{{Quote|Gosalyn Mallard's pluck and spirit touched the heart of this stoic sentinel of the shadows, and I adopted her... a decision I've never regretted, even when it's cost me thousands of dollars in home repairs.|Darkwing's description of Gosalyn|Darkwing Duck: The Definitively Dangerous Edition}}
Gosalyn is the orphaned granddaughter of Professor Waddlemeyer, a brilliant scientist. She would later become a ward of the court and was placed in an orphanage. After coming into contact with [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]], they grew close, and he chose to adopt her, returning to the civilian identity he had previously left behind. Gosalyn is a tomboyish girl, and very energetic and spunky. Darkwing has stated that caring for her is more difficult than fighting evil, and his greatest fear is Gosalyn getting hurt. She has a desire to become either Darkwing's sidekick or a hero in her own right. To this extent, she would develop two superhero identities, the Crimson Quackette and Quiverwing Quack. Her best friend is [[Honker Muddlefoot]], who is aware of the true identity of Gosalyn's father.

According to an interview with the show's creator, [[Tad Stones]], Gosalyn was partly based on what he believed his then two-year-old daughter would be like when she grew older.

===Personality===
Gosalyn starts out as spirited, caring, and brave. She has also shown to be pushy, spunky, and tomboyish. In the second cliffhanger, her personality has become sassy and sarcastic, and she gets very jealous of her father getting to go on adventures all the time. In the overall TV show, she is seen as being mischievous, quick-tempered, loud, inconsiderate, and rebellious, though she also displays a sweeter side to herself, which she shows when wishing her father to get her something, or when worrying about him.

According to behind the scenes info, contemporary teen activists served as inspiration for her personality in the 2017 ''DuckTales'' reboot, thus giving her a fierce/strong sense of justice/right and wrong in the reboot. Like Darkwing Duck in the reboot, she is facing her own fear of never being good enough; yet, this doesn't stop her from being the best hero she could be.<ref name="Tumblr">[https://suspendersofdisbelief.tumblr.com/post/188610102926/what-will-gosalyns-new-personality-be-based]</ref>

===Physical appearance===
Gosalyn is a young preteen duck with cream-colored feathers, red hair that she wears in pigtails, green eyes, an orange bill and webbed feet. She wears a long lavender jersey with a pink collar and sleeve cuffs, and a big white number one on the front, magenta Converse sneakers, and white socks with pink toes and heels.

In the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]], her hair and feathers are slightly darkened and her hair is wavier, and she wears it in a ponytail. She wears a jade green bomber jacket with a hooded lavender T-shirt underneath, black jeans, and gray sneakers. She is confirmed to be of partial Hispanic descent in the reboot.

==Appearances==
===''[[Darkwing Duck]]''===
In the pilot episodes, Gosalyn is kidnapped from her orphanage by the nefarious [[Taurus Bulba]]. Her grandfather, Professor Waddlemeyer, had created a secret weapon, and Bulba believed that Gosalyn, as the last living relative, knew the arming code. Gosalyn would be rescued by [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]], who hides her in his secret hideout atop a tower on the Audubon Bridge. Unbeknownst to Gosalyn, Prof. Waddlemeyer had secretly taught the code to her in a [[Little Girl Blue|lullaby]] he used to sing to her each night. When she passed it on to Darkwing, the hero discovers that their meeting wasn't a coincidence, but destiny. Bulba learns of the secret and is nearly able to carry out his threat. Darkwing, with the help of his sidekick, [[Launchpad McQuack]], is able to save Gosalyn and the world. Darkwing would choose to adopt her, and returns to his civilian identity of Drake Mallard and buy a home in the suburbs to live in. He often struggles with reigning in Gosalyn due to her energetic nature and his ego, but cares for her deeply.

One recurring theme is Gosalyn's desire to become a hero. In the episode "[[Trading Faces (Darkwing Duck)|Trading Faces]]", Gosalyn would get the chance to become Darkwing Duck when the two switch bodies. In "[[The Quiverwing Quack]]", Gosalyn would take up the identity of Quiverwing Quack, an archery themed heroine. She would best Negaduck, but would become a target in order for Negaduck to regain his reputation as Public Enemy Number One. Though Gosalyn is usually tomboyish, in the episode "[[Slaves to Fashion]]", Binkie Muddlefoot would attempt to make her more ladylike and have Gosalyn dress up for a school dance. While there, she would fall under the influence of a spray made by [[Tuskerninni]], which makes her act like a stereotypical lady.

In "[[Time and Punishment]]", Gosalyn is sent into the future, where Darkwing went mad with depression after Gosalyn went missing; believing she had run away because he did not allow her to help him that night against Quackerjack and Megavolt. One night, he comes across someone who was in need and reminds him of Gosalyn. Rediscovering his purpose, he becomes a much more public menace and deadlier than many of his foes such as Steelbeak and Negaduck. However simply defeating the supervillain menace of [[St. Canard]] is not enough for Darkwarrior; and he becomes a militaristic dictator, declaring martial law over St. Canard. He would punish anyone for minor offenses. Launchpad is no longer a sidekick to him because Darkwarrior accused him of being too soft on crime after he said criminals should be arrested before they were sent to the electric chair. Gosalyn is able to travel back to her present and that future never happens.

===''[[Raw Toonage]]''===
Gosalyn hosts an episode of ''Raw Toonage'', where she is trying to get [[Ludwig Von Drake]] to build her a gigantic monster.

===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
Gosalyn first appears in the episode "[[Let's Get Dangerous!]]". This version is portrayed as biracial with Latin-American ancestry.

Gosalyn first appears entering McDuck Enterprises and just as Darkwing, Launchpad, and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] enter, Darkwing thinks she is working for Taurus Bulba. Later, she arrives at the interview between Darkwing and Dewey and just as she curiously looks at the merchandise of Darkwing Duck, Drake suspects her of being a criminal who is working for Taurus Bulba, to which Gosalyn introduces herself to him. Gosalyn then clarifies about her relationship between her grandfather Dr. Waddlemeyer under Bulba's to which, after talking about the flashback, Gosalyn devises a plan to find her missing grandfather and stop Bulba from taking over the world. After Darkwing asks her if she has proof of any of this in order to find her missing grandfather, Gosalyn risks herself to find Waddlemeyer by herself. Dewey then decides to help Gosalyn find Waddlemeyer just as she joins Darkwing, Launchpad, and Dewey on their mission.

Arriving at Bulba's office, she discovers a Pezerton Science Award trophy given to Taurus Bulba and Thaddeus Waddlemeyer, to which it is known that the trophy is linked to Gosalyn's plan. Later, Gosalyn overhears Bulba telling his tragic flashback about his relationship with Waddlemeyer; feeling enraged, she takes the Ramrod key from Bulba in a plan to find her grandfather. Gosalyn then explains to Darkwing that she now has proof for Bulba being responsible for Waddlemeyer's disappearance, which would be that Waddlemeyer is trapped in another dimension. In a fit of rage, Bulba chases Gosalyn out of McDuck Enterprises to which Darkwing does a surprise attack on him. Just as Darkwing notices Gosalyn falling, she manages to tie Darkwing's cape to his feet for the two to land safely at the spot where Launchpad is standing at. Gosalyn then continues planning to find the Ramrod key once again.

Later at Darkwing's headquarters, Gosalyn, Drake, and Launchpad listen to the news about [[Bushroot]], [[Liquidator]], [[Quackerjack]], and [[Megavolt]], who are summoned by Taurus Bulba and are wreaking havoc in the city of St. Canard, just as Darkwing explains that he is not feeling confident in saving the city, with W.A.N.D.A. explaining to him that fear doesn't make Darkwing confident. Gosalyn then devises a plan to work together and fight against the supervillains.

Meanwhile, as Bushroot, Liquidator, Quackerjack, and Megavolt plan to find Darkwing and defeat him to accomplish Bulba's task, Gosalyn, Drake, and Launchpad are at the toy warehouse Cranky Frank's, where the three notice Quackerjack preparing to chase them. The three manage to escape from Quackerjack and Liquidator during the chase, and escape into Darkwing's headquarters. Darkwing scolds Gosalyn to obey what he says, much to Gosalyn feeling remorseful about her argument.

Gosalyn later overhears his conversation with Fenton just as Darkwing and Gosalyn rest together. Their rest, however, is interrupted when W.A.N.D.A. gives Gosalyn and Darkwing a warning about the Ramrod being powered up for the last time, so they make plans to face Taurus Bulba and stop him from destroying St. Canard. Later, Gosalyn asks W.A.N.D.A. to search for where Darkwing is currently at, as she and Launchpad notice Liquidator, Quackerjack, and Megavolt attacking Darkwing who is fighting in a single combat. Gosalyn devises a plan for Launchpad to help save Darkwing from Taurus Bulba. Gosalyn and Launchpad later enter Bulba Supervillain Solutions at the Ramrod area and plan a surprise attack against him in order to save Darkwing. Having rescued him, Darkwing, Gosalyn, and Launchpad plan to fight against the supervillains and save the city of St. Canard from destruction. Gosalyn then inserts the Ramrod key in order to find Waddlemeyer, but her plan provides her no results in finding her missing grandfather. [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] and the nephews, having been trapped in one of the other realms, are sent back to the real world via the portal, notice the Ramrod malfunctioning, and the rift becomes unstable and will destroy everything if overused. Gosalyn manages to stop the rift from destroying reality, but feels remorseful that she couldn't find her grandfather.

Back at home, Gosalyn shows Drake the photo of her relationship with Taurus Bulba and Thaddeus Waddlemeyer, and Darkwing asks Gosalyn if she could work together with him, which she happily accepts. Later, when Darkwing, Gosalyn, and Launchpad overhear a recent crime happening in the city of St. Canard, the three plan to return to the city and stop crime once again.

She makes her second and last appearance in the series finale, "[[The Last Adventure!]]", where she makes part of the team assembled by Scrooge to infiltrate FOWL's headquarters beneath Funso's. Later she takes part in the final assault against [[F.O.W.L.]] in the Lost Library of Alexandria, alongside Darkwing, Launchpad and B.O.Y.D vs [[Steelbeak]].

==Printed media==
===''[[Darkwing Duck (comic book)|Darkwing Duck]]''===
In the [[Boom! Studios]] ''Darkwing Duck'' comic series, Gosalyn is attending a private school while her father was forced to retire from crimefighting after the company Quackwerks takes hold of the city. When Honker is arrested, Gosalyn is the one to convince her father to retake the identity of Darkwing Duck.

While Darkwing investigates, Gosalyn manages to convince [[Launchpad McQuack]], Darkwing's former sidekick, to return, despite the two ducks have had a fallout. Gosalyn and Launchpad manage to return to St. Canard just in time to rescue Darkwing from Quackwerk's crimebots.

Later on, during a confrontation with Taurus Bulba, who was behind Quackwerks and its various schemes, Gosalyn manages to take control of the [[Gizmosuit|Gizmoduck suit]]. In the suit, Gosalyn, calling herself Gosmoduck, is able to destroy Taurus Bulba by shorting out his current body, but is believed to be killed in the resultant blast. Though Darkwing mourns briefly, he is overjoyed when it is revealed that Gosalyn survives. In the aftermath, she is allowed to keep the suit, but Darkwing restricts her usage to emergency situations. However, during [[Crisis on Infinite Darkwings|the next adventure]], the Gizmosuit is damaged and destroyed.
