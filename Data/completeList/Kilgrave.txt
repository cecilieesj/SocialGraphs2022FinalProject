'''Kevin Thompson''', better known as '''Kilgrave''' (also known as '''Purple Man''' in Marvel Animation) is a supervillain from [[Marvel Comics]]. In all of his incarnations, he has the ability to control minds, which he uses to further his villainous schemes. Since Disney bought Marvel he appeared in an episode of ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' controlling Tony Stark. A much darker version appeared in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', wherein he uses his powers to inflict suffering on others such as forcing people to kill or maim themselves in various brutal or gruesome ways. He also used his powers to abuse women, such as he did with Jessica Jones (leading to her retiring from superheroics and turning to hard drinking as a means of coping).
Kilgrave was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Joe Orlando.
