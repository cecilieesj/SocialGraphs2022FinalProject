She was living under the supervision of [[Professor (Chip 'n Dale)|a professor]] who was trying to prove that gorillas can save people. '''Boots''' is a little kitten and Kookoo's best friend. They appeared in the episode; "[[Gorilla My Dreams]]."

==Role in the episode==
After Boots was kidnapped and held hostage by [[Fat Cat]], Kookoo was forced to steal valuables for the fat feline criminal. Luckily, the Rescue Rangers (except [[Dale]], who was left with Kookoo to keep her company) helped Boots to get free and return him to Kookoo. Unfortunately, Fat Cat unnoticeably kidnapped Dale and seeing that Kookoo was interested in Dale as a new best friend, he decided to hold Dale hostage to force Kookoo again to steal jewels; especially the world's largest diamond of a wealthy old lady. With some luck, the Rescue Rangers defeated Fat Cat and his minions, saved Dale, and seeing that Boots and Dale were okay, Kookoo gave up her "life of crime" and finally proved to the professor and everyone else that gorillas can save people when saving the rich old lady from falling off a skyscraper.

==Trivia==
*Boots bears a striking resemblance to [[Spunky]] from the Rescue Rangers episode; "[[Catteries Not Included]]." The only major difference is their color scheme.Â 
*Kookoo and Boots are based on the late gorilla [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla) Koko] who had been taught to communicate with humans via sign language, as Kookoo has been taught to actually speak, and her cats, especially a kitten Koko herself named [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ball All Ball].
*The scene in which Kookoo climbs up the skyscraper is a parody on the several ''King Kong'' movies.
