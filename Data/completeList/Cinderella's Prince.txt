'''Cinderella's Prince''' is one of the six tritagonists from the film, [[Into the Woods|''Into the Woods'']]. He is loosely based off the Prince from the tale ''Cinderella''.

==Background==
Cinderella's Prince is the elder of two royal brothers. He is handsome, charming, brave, and for the most part, kind. He also gets along well enough with his brother that they tease each other without malice over their respective issues with women. But, by his own admission, he was "raised to be charming, not sincere." This leads him to be a womanizer, a reputation that the citizens of the kingdom are aware of. 

Cinderella's Prince is on an endless quest to find his bride, Cinderella.  He does not remain faithful to her, as he kisses the Baker's Wife. When Cinderella found out, she and the Prince part ways as they go on with their separate lives. 

==''Into the Woods''==
The King throws a massive ball, requiring that all eligible maidens attend. Cinderella attends and dances with the Prince for a while. But, around midnight, she runs away from the castle. The Prince, enamored with her, follows on horseback with a few soldiers. In the woods, the group runs into the Baker's Wife. He asks if she has seen Cinderella, but she tells him she has not. He tells the Baker's Wife that it is dangerous to be alone in the woods at night, and heads off with his men to continue searching.

The following morning, he meets up with his brother near a stream. He tells his brother about the beautiful girl he met at the ball, but she ran away from him. When Rapunzel's Prince starts talking about the beautiful girl in the tower, Cinderella's Prince teases him, mostly about his beloved's name. Rapunzel's Prince teases back over a girl running away from him. The pair of them sing "Agony," and Cinderella's Prince rips his shirt open for dramatic emphasis. The two princes vow to marry the girls they pine for.

On the third night of the festival, Cinderella runs away again. Thinking ahead, the Prince covered the front stairs with tar, so Cinderella could not escape. After some thought, Cinderella slips out of her shoe and runs, leaving a clue for the Prince. He takes the shoe out of the tar, and follows again on horseback. In the woods, him and his men run into the Baker's Wife. The Steward, who was traveling with the Prince, notices that the Wife has one of Cinderella's gold slippers. He tries to take it, but she begs to keep it, saying everything will turn out well for everyone soon. The Prince says that they only need the one slipper and leaves.

Later that same evening, he travels from house to house, putting the gold slipper onto various women's feet to find a match. He reaches Cinderella's house, and after Florinda and Lucinda mutilate their feet to try and fit the slipper, he notices Cinderella. He recognizes her and puts the slipper on her. 

The following day, he and Cinderella are married, but the festivities are interrupted by loud crashing and the ground shaking. The people panic, and he calms the crowd down by telling them it was just an earthquake. He heads off to investigate the "earthquake," but while taking a break in the woods, he meets the Baker's wife again. They talk for a bit, and she tells him that the "earthquake" was actually a giantess. He calls her brave for being out in the woods alone of her own accord, then starts flirting with her. She tries to resist his advances, but eventually they start making out while one of Cinderella's bird friends watches. Afterwards, he tells the Baker's Wife he will not forget her, and rides off to slay the Giantess.

Eventually, he meets back up with Cinderella. The bird from earlier has told Cinderella what it saw, and she confronts him. He brushes the situation off, saying, "I was raised to be charming, not sincere." Cinderella decides it would be best if they split up, and the Prince reluctantly agrees. He says he will always love "the girl who ran away." When Cinderella says she will always love "the faraway prince," he looks somewhat hurt. He does not appear for the rest of the movie.
