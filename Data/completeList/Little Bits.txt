|alias=Babycakes, Bits}}'''Little Bits''' is a character from "[[The Stray]]". She's a kitten who is hired as a bounty hunter by [[Lord Hater]]. She used her natural hypnotism abilities to lure [[Wander]] into a trap, and is the main antagonist in her debut episode. She mostly stays silent as part of her deceptive cover, but when she talks, she speaks with a cute lisp. As of "[[My Fair Hatey]]", she is one of Lord Dominator's prisoners.
==Abilities==
Little Bits uses her cunning mind to manipulate others. She has the power to control the thoughts and actions of her adversaries by putting them into a trance through eye-contact. Those with particularly protective or empathetic natures are more susceptible to fall under her hypnosis, as she uses her cute, vulnerable appearance as leverage through her mind-control. In the episode "The Stray", this ability was demonstrated on Wander.
