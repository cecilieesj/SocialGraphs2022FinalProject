==Role in the short==
In the short, Alec is trying to get a carrot from [[Presto DiGiotagione|Presto]]. He must go through a wizard's purple hat with white stars and moons to come out of Presto's magic top hat.

After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that the top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept in Presto's dressing room with Alec, so that when Presto reaches into the top hat, his hand appears out of the wizard's hat, allowing him to grab Alec and pull him out of the top hat. He intends to feed Alec a carrot, but realizes that he is late for the show and rushes onto the stage without doing so.

Presto tries to start the performance, but Alec refuses to cooperate until he is given the carrot. Presto then spends the rest of the show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.

Alec cleverly turns the hat's magic against his master in painful and humiliating ways, such as putting the magician's finger in a mouse trap and later into an electrical socket (which causes him to dance wildly) and having his head sucked into a vacuum kept offstage. On the other hand, Presto antagonizes Alec by turning one carrot into a flower and smashing another into a pulp (causing Alec to retaliate with the vacuum and the electric socket respectively). The audience interprets these shenanigans as part of the act and applauds with increasing approval.

Eventually, Presto can take no more and chases Alec backstage, catching his foot in a rope that lifts him up to the fly space above the stage when he mistakenly releases the weights holding down some stage props. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls along with a piano and some suspended scenery. Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the carrot (and many more), as well as second billing on the posters advertising the act.

==Trivia==
*The [[Pixar Ball|Luxo Ball]] can be seen under Alec's left ear at 2:34 in ''Presto''.
*Alec's name is a play on the stock magic trick incantation: "Abracadabra, alakazam!"
*With the exception of light blue eyes, Alec holds similarities to Illumination's Secret Life of Pets character Snowball.
