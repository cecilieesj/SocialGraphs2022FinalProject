He is a teenager who was affected by Terragenesis, turning him into an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] with the power to absorb energy and converting it into fire blasts, and transform into a monstrous dragon/bull hybrid. He was caught in the crossfire of the Inhuman Registration Act, and was later mind-controlled by [[Ultron]], but he was freed from Ultron's control by [[Avengers|the Avengers]].

==Trivia==
*Haechi's appearance in ''[[Avengers Assemble]]'' is the character's first adaptation, outside of the comics.
