==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, the '''Aloadae''' (or '''Aloadai'''; Ancient Greek: Ἀλωάδαι) were '''Otus''' (Ὦτος) and '''Ephialtes''' (Ἐφιάλτης), sons of Iphimedia, queen of Aloeus, by Poseidon, whom she induced to make her pregnant by going to the seashore and disporting herself in the surf or scooping seawater into her bosom. From Aloeus they received their patronymic, the Aloadai. They were strong and aggressive giants, growing by nine fingers every month nine fathoms tall at age nine, and only outshone in beauty by Orion.
