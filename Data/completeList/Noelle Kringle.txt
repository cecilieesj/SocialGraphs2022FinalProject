She is the daughter of [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]] and [[Mrs. Claus|Mrs. Kringle]]. Noelle is feisty, but also kind and friendly. After her father steps down as Santa Claus, Noelle's brother Nick takes the mantle.

As Nick struggles with training for his new role, Noelle advises him to go away from the weekend. But when Nick does not return to the North Pole, Noelle along with an elf named Polly (who was the childhood nanny of Noelle) leaves to find her brother and bring him back in time for Christmas Eve. In the end, Noelle ultimately ends up being the next Santa Claus (and the first female Santa in 24 generations).
