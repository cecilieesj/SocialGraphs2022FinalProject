'''Phoebe Dickens''' is a character from the video game ''[[Guilty Party]]''.

==Official Biography==
Daughter of [[Dorian Dickens|The Commodore]] and [[Olivia Dickens|Olivia]]. Unlike her big brother [[Max Dickens|Max]], she enjoys detective work so much that she's training with the FBI. This irks the Commodore because he doesn't consider the Feds on a par with the Dickens Detective Agency, and worries that Phoebe might be dulling her edge.

If she is, it's hard to tell; she is tall, athletic, and probably the most energetic of the detectives, apart from the kids. As a result of her FBI training, or perhaps her experiences as the mother of "Kid Riddle," she will occasionally snap into an extremely serious during a tense investigation. Not a mom you want to mess with.
