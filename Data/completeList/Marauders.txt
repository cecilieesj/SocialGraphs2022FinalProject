}}'''The Marauders''' are [[Zorasto]]'s men who aid him in his task of marauding, stealing, killing and robbing in the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' TV series episodes "[[The Sands of Fate]]" and "[[Riders Redux]]".

==Role in the show==
===''[[The Sands of Fate]]''===
The marauders show up to attack the [[Riders of Ramond]] to rob their cargo. Their fight always ends up opening a chest and making a crystal fall, which makes them and the riders vanish and repeat the day over and over again. [[Abu]] later becomes a marauder and [[Carpet]] becomes their ride. They plan on defeating the riders once and for all. Later that day, [[Iago]] catches the crystal and Abu and Carpet are back to normal and the marauders are defeated by the riders.

===''[[Riders Redux]]''===
Zorasto and the marauders later returned now wielding the [[Sands of Time]] in order to rob travelers blind without them even noticing. In the end however they were defeated by Aladdin.
