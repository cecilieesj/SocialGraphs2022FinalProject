|quote=}}'''Sauron''' is a supervillain from the Savage Land.

Sauron was created by Neal Adams, Roy Thomas and Tom Palmer.

==''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''==
Sauron leads an army of dinosaurs with lasers against [[Hulk]]'s team. When [[Devil Dinosaur|one dinosaur]] gets freed of Sauron's control, it befriends [[A-Bomb]] and helps defeating Sauron.

When Hulk faces [[Leader]] in the Negative Zone, the gamma villain reveals he was the one who provided Sauron with lasers.

Sauron is part of the Agents of C.R.A.S.H. to discredit Hulk and his team.

==Trivia==
*He shares his name with [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Sauron Sauron], the main antagonist of ''[http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings#Films The Lord of the Rings]'' series.
*Despite being called a dinosaur, Sauron is not a dinosaur, but rather a Pterosaur, a possible relative of the Pteranodon.
