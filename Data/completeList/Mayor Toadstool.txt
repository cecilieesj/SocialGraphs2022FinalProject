==Background==
===Personality===
Mayor Toadstool is a shady mayor. He cheats out everyone for his own greedy desires and cares more about his image. He considers everyone, especially Anne and the Plantars, beneath him and is not afraid to openly voice his disdain for them. He is remarkably clever however and a quick plotter; loving to cash in on an opportunity when it falls in his lap.

He does show off a reasonably honorable side however. He was willing to hold up his end of any deals or bargains that he took part in. He will also risk his life to protect and save the people of Wartwood, though he admits it is for his own greedy benefit (though judging by the manner of how he said it, he probably meant it in a joking manner). However, Anne's heroism inspired him to reformed himself.

===Physical appearance===
Mayor Toadstool is a large light green toad with smooth skin and large eyes. He wears a maroon jacket with dark elbow patches and gold designs on the jacket's edges. He also wears a lilac cravat, a white undershirt, puffy dark gray pants, and dark brown shoes.

In addition, Mayor Toadstool has five gold rings on his fingers, two of which have red gemstones and one of which has a light blue gemstone. He is even frequently seen walking around with a curved gold cane.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Anne or Beast?]]", Mayor Toadstool is first seen listening to [[One-Eyed Wally]] describe his encounter with a monster in the woods. Toadstool then declares that the creature should be caught and dealt with as that is the 'right' thing to do for his citizens as everyone applauds for him. Toadstool then organizes a mob to hunt down the monster who turns out to be a human girl named [[Anne Boonchuy]]. After Anne saves the mob from a giant red mantis, Toadstool and the mob tries to run Anne out of town, only to be stopped by [[Sprig Plantar]]. Toadstool then begrudgingly allows Sprig's grandfather, [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]] take Anne in into his home and leaves with the rest of the mob.

In "[[Hop Luck]]", Mayor Toadstool is holding Wartwood's annual potluck where he taste-testing all of the competitors' dishes. He approaches the last delicacy which belongs to the Plantar family. He compliments their dish consisting of a tomato, but after tasting it, he informs that while it is the best dish they made so far, it still tastes the worse. This causes Anne and the Plantars to lose the potluck and sit in the shame-cage.

In "[[Breakout Star]]", Mayor Toadstool learns his poll numbers have dropped down and when he sees Anne being praised by the townsfolk for having pimples, he gets an idea. Mayor Toadstool invites Anne to act as a spokesperson for him and she accepts, as this means that people will stop being afraid and frightened of her. When Anne wakes up one day to discover her pimples are gone, she gets the Plantars to help her find replacements for her acne. When Anne arrives in time to give a speech to Wartwood's citizens, Toadstool is displeased to hear Anne was with the Plantars and points out that due to her new status she shouldn't be hanging out with the lower class anymore. Anne nods and says she understands before heading out onto the stage to give a speech. However, Anne removes her berries in front of everyone much to their shock and Toadstool humiliates himself by calling the citizens "idiots," asking how he would get their votes now before being pelted by fruit.

In "[[Toad Tax]]", Mayor Toadstool and Toadie meet with [[Bog, Fens, and Mire]] and gives them a list of names of the civilians who hadn't paid their taxes to the toads of [[Toad Tower]]. However, Toadstool has been secretly keeping the tax money all to himself and hide the money in a statue of himself. This causes Bog, Fens, and Mire to bully the citizens and steal their belongings as punishment for not paying their taxes. When Sprig discovers Toadstool to be hoarding the money, the mayor chases Sprig, but the young frog is able to reveal Toadstool's crimes to the citizens and tax collectors by showing where Toadstool had been keeping the money. As Toadstool claims he was keeping the money to "buy" the citizens' favor, Toadstool is pelted by fruit again as he pardons himself of his crimes.

In "[[Children of the Spore]]", Toadstool is one of the many people who had fallen under the mind control of [[Apothecary Gary]]. Toadstool and everyone else under Apothecary Gary's control attack the Plantar farm and try to capture Hop Pop, the only frog in Wartwood who is not under the effects of the mind-controlling mushroom spores. However, Hop Pop is able to trick Apothecary Gary by having [[Bessie (Amphibia)|Bessie]] eat the mind-controlling mushrooms growing onto everyone's heads, including Toadstool's. After Apothecary Gary's defeat, Toadstool and everyone else is free from his mind control where Toadstool questions why he is at the Plantar farm and what day it is as he heads back home.

==Trivia==
* He shares similarities with [[Prince John]] as both were greedy corrupt official who collecting taxes from poverty to become the richest in the world. Their differences are that Prince John is a villain and didn't redeem himself while Mayor Toadstool isn't and does redeem himself.
*Unlike the other toads shown throughout the series, Mayor Toadstool does not have pointed teeth.
* According to Matt Braly, he and Toadie are in love, inferring that they are indeed a couple.<ref>https://twitter.com/radrappy/status/1527350652803829762?s=21&t=FJUKAMMnw8xVwcY4KlQXpg</ref>
