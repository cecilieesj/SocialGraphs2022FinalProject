}}'''Vero''' is a character in the third season of the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]].

==Background==
Vero is described as being kind towards the McDuck family who arrives at Mervana the first time. However, when it comes to Scrooge McDuck's negative attitude, he tells him to give up his negativity to find inner truth.

==Role in the series==
Vero was introduced in the Season 3 episode, "[[The Lost Harp of Mervana!]]".

When the McDuck family, with the exception of [[Della Duck|Della]], arrives, Vero and [[Aletheia]] happily greet him just as Aletheia explains that all the inhabitants underwater are free from suffering just as the two take them to another area called "Mervana". On their way, Vero tells [[Scrooge McDuck]] to find truth by himself just as the two arrive in Mervana. Arriving there, Vero and Aletheia explain the backstory of [[King Honestus]] seeking his destiny of truth but never returned after telling his people to escape the lands, telling them that honesty is the first step of seeking truth just as Vero brings in a drum ceremony for the McDucks in finding honesty. During arts and crafts time, Scrooge does his own fish tail design linked to money to which Vero finds out that this crafted fish tail is not linked to seeking the truth, but suddenly becomes overjoyed upon seeing the fish tail crafted by [[Donald Duck]], impressing him and Aletheia. Aletheia and Vero tell the McDucks that they are all truthful and polite in Mervana with the exception of Scrooge who has a negative attitude preventing him from finding the truth. As a result, Scrooge is forced to go back to the arts and crafts section to redo his fish tail to find inner truth.

Looking at Huey and Dewey's fish tails, Vero prepares for the ritual sacrifice to seek the truth within and give up negativity while Scrooge begs him and Aletheia to give him another chance to seek the truth. Scrooge, however, chooses to sacrifice just as Aletheia and Vero accept this. Asking the two where the Harp is at, Vero explains that King Honestus would sometime return. Honestus, however, arrives in his monstrous fish form terrorizing the Mervanans. Escaping, Louie tells Vero alongside Aletheia that Honestus himself turned into a monster, telling the two to believe in Mervana in their hearts.

Vero, Aletheia, and the other citizens of Mervana fight against a corrupted King Honestus. During battle, Vero, the McDucks (this time with Della joining in), and the rest of the Mervanans escape from the ancient tower where Louie, Webby, and Mrs. Beakley found the Harp of Mervana. Vero, Aletheia, and the rest of the Mervanans, lose their tails and have their feet revealed, alongside King Honestus who reverts to his normal form just as the Harp warns him to rebuild his kingdom with hard work as punishment just as Vero, Aletheia, and the rest of the Mervanans plan to conquer their fear of land and adapt to a new life from sea and land to rebuild the fallen kingdom by working together to rebuild it just as the McDucks leave Mervana.

In "[[Escape from the ImpossiBin!]]", Vero is one of the victims telling Scrooge McDuck and his family that the Harp of Mervana is stolen by a group of Eggheads working for [[F.O.W.L.]], an evil organization taking rare artifacts that the McDucks have found.

==Trivia==
*Vero's name comes from the Latin word "verus", meaning "true" or "correct".
*Vero's green color scheme is most likely a reference to voice actor [[Greg Cipes]]' role as Beast Boy, whom he portrays in Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go, and Young Justice starting with season 3
