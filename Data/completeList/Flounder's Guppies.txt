They are the five children of [[Flounder]]. [[Ariel]] meets them when she resumes her mermaid form to search for [[Melody]]. Their names are never given, but they resemble Flounder closely enough that Ariel mistakes one of them for her friend. It is unknown if they have a living mother or where she is, as she is not at all mentioned. They last appear in the end during the song "[[Here On The Land and Sea|Here on the Land and Sea]]" to which they bring a whale a trumpet to blow during the celebration.
