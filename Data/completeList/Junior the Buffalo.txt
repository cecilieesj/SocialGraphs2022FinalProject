'''Junior the Buffalo''' is a minor antagonist in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2004]] animated feature film, ''[[Home on the Range]]''.

==Personality==
Junior is a very serious-minded and imperturbable buffalo. He also doesn't take kindly to trespassers, namely those who are not "cows", according to him. He talks in a deep, ominous voice and tries to maintain his composure when agitated. Like [[Grace]], Junior is also immune to [[Alameda Slim]]'s yodeling, but for Junior, it's because he is a bison, and Slim's yodeling only affects cattle; whereas Grace (who is a cow) is tone-deaf. He also seems to have a bit of a crush on Mrs. Calloway, as he behaves in a rather flirtatious manner towards her (like when he is complimenting her hat).

==Role in the film==
Junior is Alameda Slim's valiant "steed". Unusual for a villain's sidekick, he is portrayed as neither good nor evil, just simply doing his job. He is very polite to cows and even flirts with Mrs. Calloway upon seeing her by complimenting her hat. He also tires of [[Buck]]'s arrogance when the horse attempts to get through [[Echo Mine]]'s entrance, despite Junior saying repeatedly, "Cows only."

Later in the film, [[Maggie]], [[Mrs. Calloway]], and Grace show up along with [[Lucky Jack]] (a jackrabbit who helped the cows reach Echo Mine), and Junior lets all four of them pass. When Buck questions Junior about this, the buffalo states, "They're cows," and when Buck brings up the rabbit, Junior replies, "Well, obviously, he was with the cows." Buck tries convincing Junior that he was with the cows too, but to no avail.

Sometime later, Buck tricks another horse into leaving his post so he could get back with [[Rico]] and then gloats. However, Buck is overheard by Junior who snorts angrily, as he had been right behind him. Junior is later seen chasing Buck around Echo Mine. He is shown to be immensely strong and survives a considerable fall after the cows inadvertently push him down the mine shaft. Junior soon makes his way out of the mine shaft and continues chasing Buck, but turns away after hearing Slim, who had been captured by the cows, calling for him.

At the end of the movie, Junior has left the services of Alameda Slim (since Slim is in jail) and arrives, along with [[Barry and Bob]], at [[Patch of Heaven|Little Patch of Heaven]], where he courts Mrs. Calloway. He also dances with all the other farm animals as they celebrate [[Pearl Gesner|Pearl]]'s farm being saved and re-opened.

==Trivia==
*Junior is similar to [[Rico]] as they both have deep, ominous voices and are completely obedient.
*When Junior gets pushed and falls down the mine shaft, his yell is supplied by the classic [[Goofy]] holler sound effect.
*In some storybooks, while Junior is depicted as surviving his fall into the mine shaft, he is never seen at the end, leaving unknown what happens to him after [[Alameda Slim]]'s arrest.
*Junior's name may possibly come from William Lance LeGault Junior, the son of his voice actor, William Lance LeGault.
