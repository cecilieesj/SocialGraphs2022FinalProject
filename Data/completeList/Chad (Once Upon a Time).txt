'''Chad''' is a character on the [[ABC]] series ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. He is first mentioned, in the season seven episode, "[[The Eighth Witch]]", and debuts in his only appearance, in "[[Chosen]]". He is the fiance of [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Kelly]]. He is portrayed by [[Kip Pardue]].

==History==
In [[San Francisco]], Chad meets [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Kelly]] and the two eventually fall in love and get engaged. However, one day close to their wedding, Kelly, who now remembers her past life as Zelena, reveals that she is still in love with Chad and is reluncant to lie to him.

After Zelena returns to [[Hyperion Heights (location)|Hyperion Heights]], Chad calls her multiple times and leaves her a few messages, but she, unsure of what to tell him, doesn't pick up.

Chad calls Zelena on their anniversary and tells her he misses her, but she ignores his call once more. Later on, Chad is lured to Hyperion Heights by [[Hansel and Gretel|Nick]], who poses as a doctor from [[New York City]] and lies to him about Zelena getting into a cycling accident. After kidnapping Chad, Nick calls Kelly through Chad's number and tells her that if she ever wants to see Chad again, she will do exactly what he says.

After Nick has Chad moved to the basement of Roni's, Zelena finds him, only for Nick to try and kill her. She overpowers him, but instead of killing him with his knife, she declares she's not that person anymore and knocks him unconscious. Zelena then frees Chad and confesses mostly everything, including who she really is. Instead of returning the ring, Chad tells her that, when he proposed to her, he signed up for everything, including the things he didn't know and that whoever she was as Zelena, she's different now. The two reconcile with a kiss, and the police arrive to arrest Nick. As she and Chad are going back to San Francisco, Kelly says her goodbyes to Roni and [[Robin Hood (Once Upon a Time)|Margot]].
