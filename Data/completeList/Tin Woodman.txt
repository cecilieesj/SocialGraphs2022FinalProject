After Dorothy returned home to [[Kansas]] in ''Return to Oz'', the Tin Woodman had been turned into stone by the [[Nome King]], but thankfully Dorothy defeats him and restores the Tin Woodman to his regular form.

[[File:GonzoTin.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gonzo as the Tin Thing.]]
In ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'', [[Gonzo]] plays a character called the '''Tin Thing''', an obvious spoof of the Tin Woodman. Like the story, he was turned into a robotic, computerized being without a heart by the Wicked Witch so that he could not love [[Camilla]]. Despite the handicap, he proves to be a useful companion to [[Dorothy Gale (The Muppets' Wizard of Oz)|Dorothy]] and the others, showing great friendship throughout.

===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===
The Tin Woodman made a brief cameo in the ''Phineas and Ferb'' episode "[[Wizard of Odd]]". However, [[Candace Flynn]], in the Dorothy role, quickly ignores him in favor of the talking tree played by [[Jeremy Johnson]].

===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===
In the ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse'' episode "[[The Wizard of Dizz]]", the Tin Woodman is portrayed by [[Mickey Mouse]].

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
The Tin Woodman made a brief cameo in the show. When [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin of Locksley]] meets [[Will Scarlet]] in the Land of Oz, the Tin Woodman rests along the [[Yellow Brick Road]] nearby. He appears again in the episode "[[Where Bluebirds Fly]]".
