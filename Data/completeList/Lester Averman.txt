'''Lester "Les" Averman''' is a hockey player from Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. He plays forward and wears number 4. He serves as a goofball and deadpan snarker of the team. He can contribute on the ice but has trouble dealing with opposing enforcers. Averman is the second most injured person in the series, tied with [[Guy Germaine|Guy]].

== Biography ==
In ''[[The Mighty Ducks]]'', he is first shown to be playing a prank by filling a broken handbag with dog waste and leaving a dollar bill tucked half way out to attract an unsuspecting person. He tried to avoid playing in the game by acting as a commentator, giving everyone nicknames. Most of the early games involved Averman being knocked down by a larger, tougher player in the face-off for the puck. Thanks to Coach Bombay's help and exercises, he began doing better at handling the puck and passing it to the other teammates. In ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks|D2]]'', he was working as an usher at a local movie theater when Charlie stopped by to recruit him for Team USA. He admits to not practicing while Bombay was gone, saying that he knew they were forgetting something. Averman was part of the [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)|Team USA]]. He later attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''. He is portrayed by Matt Doherty.

After D3, Averman became a limo-driver for a person he describes "makes a lot more money than him". He re-united with the other Ducks at Twin City Slice before the Spirit of the Ducks gala, and even broke out a bit of his old dialect of speech. However, like the others he was put off when Bombay was dismissive of the other Ducks and him and did not want to go to the gala. [[Evan Morrow]], at the gala however, let Averman and the others know that Gordon was not invited, and that the committee was embarrassed by him. With this new knowledge, Averman drove his boss's limo into the Ice Palace to get Bombay. Which he remarks "he learned from the best" when doing so.

When he and the Ducks arrived at the gala, he encouraged the others to chant Bombay's name after they each took turns giving him praise. He later on is seen playing with the Don't Bothers at the Ice Palace along with the rest of the Ducks.

== Playing Style ==
Lester's playing style resembles that of a Playmaker. He often passes and sets up shots for the better scorers.
