==Background==
Previously, Sahara belonged to [[Sultana]], who was the only one who could tame Sahara, even though many have tried and failed. Sahara doesn't even allow the Sultan to come near him unless he has an apple for him.

The Sultan states that Sahara was Jasmine's Mother's favorite horse and he visits Sahara every day to be reminded of her beauty, courage, and strength.

===Personality===
Sahara is feisty and haughty, yet very loyal to his owners. He isn't very friendly and is easily angered.

Sahara has no problem being aggressive and violent to anyone who tries to tame him or gets too close to him, even having a dislike for Jasmine, initially. Before Jasmine tames him, the only person he seems to put up with is his care-taker [[Hakeem]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''===
The ''Follow Your Dreams'' installment is the only film that Sahara is ever seen or mentioned in. In the film one night, a dizzy [[Abu]] accidentally lets Sahara out of his stable. Jasmine, Abu, [[Carpet]] and [[Iago]] go in search of him in order to prevent [[Hakeem]] from getting fired.

After searching for some time, they find Sahara at an Oasis in the middle of the desert. Jasmine attempts to tame him while singing the song "[[I've Got My Eyes on You]]". After what seems like many hours, Jasmine is finally able to tame Sahara and she rides him home. He even seems friendly with her and fond of her.

Later on, the Sultan is amazed that Jasmine was able to tame Sahara and comments that she reminds him of her mother and Sahara becomes Jasmine's horse.
