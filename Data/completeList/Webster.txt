'''Webster''' is a dictionary, one of [[Beast]]'s servants and a character in ''[[Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World|Belle's Magical World]]'', the third film installment in the ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' franchise.

==Role in the [[Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World|film]]==
Webster is the castle's writer, who was transformed into a dictionary. While he means well, he has a rather long tongue, often speaking out of the right moment. This leads to the other servants, particularly [[Lumiere]] and [[Cogsworth]], to dislike him greatly. During the first segment of ''Belle's Magical World'', he infuriates the Beast by giving unwanted synonyms to [[Belle]]'s insults during a row, leading the Beast to strike him. Wracked with guilt after Belle and the Beast stop speaking to each other, he forges a letter of apology from Belle with his two best friends, [[Crane]] (a set of paper sheets) and [[Le Plume]] (a quill). He is exiled from the castle when the Beast finds out, but amends are made after Belle brings him back.
