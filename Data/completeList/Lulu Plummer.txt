She also belongs to a troop called the Fireflies, who are bullied by another troop called the Bear Troop but in the end they beat the latter up for being so mean to them.

==Personality==
Lulu is kind of mischievous to [[Shane Wolfe]], and asks him lots of questions. One night, when she follows him down the hall, she asks him why his boobs are so big, but he tells her that they are not boobs.

When Lulu walks into the playroom with Shane, she asks him if her boobs will get as big as his someday. However, he replies with, "I think it's time you went nappy-poo in beddy-bye land." His words greatly embarrass her. With that she storms off to her room, declaring, "Disrespectful. And I think I was '''interested''' in you!"

==Role in the film==
Lulu is first seen peeking round the door and screaming when she sees Shane, and closes it. She hides behind the banister, afraid of him at first. On the night after [[Julie Plummer|Julie]] leaves, she screams and he follows the sound. He then sees her playing a video game. She is awakened by his whistle between [[Zoe Plummer|Zoe]] and [[Seth Plummer|Seth]] and when the whistle is blown she has an accident  in her huggies princess pull up with the Ariel design on the pull up and when she pees in her Huggies princess pull up the water in her princess pull up which she peed in makes the graphics on the pull up fade   And then she says. "Oh no! My Pull-Up is wet. I peed in my Huggies Princess Pull-Up. At the table, she copies Shane when he says, "Peter farted." Then she tells him, "I need to put on a new Pull-Up." So she goes to the bathroom and does so.

Later in the film, Lulu reappears in the living room, complaining that her siblings have something to do the next day. She crosses her eyes to show Shane, but it upsets [[Tyler Plummer|Tyler]]. With Shane on the phone, she shushes him. She is seen again with her siblings in the garage staring at their minivan. She is buckled in her car seat between Peter and Tyler, but when she's chased by [[Mr. & Mrs. Chun|Mr. Chun]] later in the film, she is seen sitting in the front beside a desperate Zoe.
