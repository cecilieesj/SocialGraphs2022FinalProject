'''Chloe Cluck''' is the deceased wife of [[Buck Cluck]] and the deceased mother of [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]]. She is implied to have died prior to the events of the film. She is only mentioned a couple times in the [[Chicken Little (film)|film]], mainly by Buck.

==Role in the film==
When [[Buck Cluck]] comes home from picking his son up from detention at school, she is briefly seen in a family photo, while Buck Cluck is saying "Oh, Chloe, if only you were here... you'd know what to do". Near the end of the film she was mentioned one more time by Buck when he said. "Y...Your mom, she was... You know, she was always good with stuff like this."

==Trivia==
*Her son, [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]] bears a striking similarity to her in appearance. He has her eyes, eyebrows and feather color.
*There is a deleted scene in which Chloe Cluck is alive. She would have also been alive in the unused summer camp story that wrote Chicken Little as a girl instead of a boy. Her voice actress would have been [[Estelle Harris]].
*Her passing seems to be relatively recent, as the photograph has Chicken Little and Buck looking the same age they are in the film's present day.
*In the 2006 DVD Trivia Game "Where's [[Fish Out of Water (Chicken Little)|Fish]]?", her name was incorrectly spelled as "Cloe".
