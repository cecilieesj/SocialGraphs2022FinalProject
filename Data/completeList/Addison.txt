'''Addison '''(portrayed by Rachel Kathryn Bell) is a character that appears on ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]''.

She was Woody's wife for the marriage project that Miss Tutweiller assigned. She is most easily recognized by her very long hair and is first seen in "[[International Dateline]]". She is last seen in "[[Graduation on Deck]]". Woody and Addison go to prom together and share their first kiss.
