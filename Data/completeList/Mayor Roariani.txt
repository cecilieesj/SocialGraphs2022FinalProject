}}'''Mayor Roariani''' is a character from the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Henry Hugglemonster]]''. She appears in the episode "[[Roarsville Rules]]".

She first appears at the podium in Roarsville, making her speech about becoming the city's new mayor (Swifty Hugglemonster was the previous mayor). Just as Roariani was about to read from the rule book, Captain Hollander arrived to take her to the monster mayor's meeting in Growlsburg. Roariani left someone else in charge until she returned. Everyone agreed to put [[Henry Hugglemonster (character)|Henry]] in charge of the rules.

When Mayor Roariani returned from the meeting, she arrived to find Roarsville in a mess. Henry explained how hard it was to be a mayor and how everyone had trouble with the rules. Everyone volunteered to restore the city to the way it was, but Roariani allowed them to keep the hugglejuice fountain [[Cobby Hugglemonster|Cobby]] had built earlier. She later shared a cup of hugglejuice along with Henry.
