She has the same personality as Deuce Martinez and has a notable interest on him. They are really alike in many ways. Dina Garcia is portrayed by Ainsley Bailey.

==Personal life==
Dina comes from a very rich family (it was stated that her father owns the mall in [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Match_It_Up Match It Up]). She is currently in a relationship with [[Deuce Martinez]]. Dina has a pet pig named [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Pinkie Pinkie] and had an unnamed hamster that married a mouse and is now raising a happy family. She mentioned once, in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Glitz_It_Up Glitz It Up]", that she is [http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Don_Rio_Garcia Don Rio Garcia] 's only daughter, implying that she might have a brother(s). Her father loves her and makes sure that she will find somebody nice. When she found Deuce, he was more than happy. It is shown in "[http://shakeitup.wikia.com/wiki/Jingle_It_Up Jingle It Up]", that Dina is not a good singer when Deuce tried to trick her into not caroling with him and his family. Dina is much like her boyfriend, Deuce, as she sells items around the school and wears colorful headphones around her neck a lot. She possesses a New Jersey accent.

==Relationships with other characters==

===[[Deuce Martinez]]===
[[Deuce Martinez|Deuce]] is Dina's boyfriend. They met in "Match It Up" and have been together ever since. Dina is described to be the female version of Deuce. They both dress alike and both sell things to other people. Like Deuce, Dina has Cuban blood in her, seeing as her father is Cuban (but her mother maybe German). He has met both of her parents: [[Don Rio Garcia]] and Mrs. Garcia on different occasions and gained their trust and respect. They have the support of Deuce's friends: CeCe is the one that set them up and Rocky has said that the two are perfect for each other. Dina calls him "Baby", "Sweetie", and "Deucie". They are the only canon couple in the show, having celebrated their one-year anniversary in "Review It Up".

=== [[Rocky Blue]] ===
[[Rocky Blue|Rocky]] is a friend and schoolmate of Dina. She and CeCe are the two who brought Dina and Deuce together. Rocky had a 'she's perfect for Deuce' look on her face during "Match It Up". They are good friends, as seen in "Review It Up" when Rocky and CeCe tried to help Dina come up with a gift to give Deuce for their one-year anniversary. During "Jingle It Up", they saw each other at the mall while Rocky noticed the tree for underprivileged kids. When Rocky said she was going to play Santa to a needy kid, Dina said she was a wonderful person, wished more people were like her, and was proud to call her a friend. However, when the tree fell on Rocky, Dina ran away.

=== [[Cece Jones]] ===
[[CeCe Jones|CeCe]] is a friend and schoolmate of Dina's. She is also one of the main reasons that Dina is with Deuce. CeCe set them up through her "CeCe's Single No More!" relationship service in "Match It Up" after Savannah broke up with Deuce. She said that she wants Dina to be with [[Deuce Martinez|Deuce]] and will stick with him no matter what dead end job he has. They are good friends, as seen in "Review It Up" when CeCe and Rocky tried to help Dina think of a gift to give Deuce for their one-year anniversary.

=== [[Tinka Hessenheffer]] ===
[[Tinka Hessenheffer|Tinka]] is a friend and schoolmate of Dina's. They grew closer in the episode "Spirit It Up" after Deuce told Dina that maybe they should give Tinka a chance because Gunther went back to his home country.
