==Background==
Cagliostro lived in Massachusetts, where he owned and operated a laboratory in a tower. He spent years preparing for his experiment with a machine he had created called the Metamorphitron, which could conceivably beautify ugly creatures. At some point, he created a monster named [[Torgo]] and made him his assistant.

===Personality===
Being a mad scientist, Cagliostro has an evil and maniacal side. Despite being rather antagonistic, he does not regard his work as harmful or monstrous, as he disliked turning [[Pumbaa]] ugly. When his assistant Torgo became a beautiful woman, Cagliostro decided to marry her and become the happiest man on Earth. Therefore, it is possible that he reformed.

===Physical appearance===
Cagliostro is a short, stout, and hunch-backed man. He has pale green skin, with black hair, two bits of black mustache, and large black eyes with yellow sclerae.

==Role in the series==
Cagliostro declares himself ready for his experiment. He orders Torgo to catch [[Timon]] and Pumbaa and bring them to him. When Torgo does so, Cagliostro tells the two friends that he's going to turn them into the world's most beautiful creatures. Timon tells the doctor that he's already beautiful but that Pumbaa could use some improvements. Cagliostro then puts Timon in a cage.

Pumbaa is put in the Metamorphitron by Torgo. However, the Metamorphitron turns Pumbaa ugly instead of beautiful, much to Cagliostro's shock and depression, as he realizes that his experiment had failed. After telling Torgo to put Pumbaa in the cage with Timon, Cagliostro takes out a picture of [[Albert Einstein]] and asks him what he could have possibly overlooked. Albert Einstein "whispers" into Cagliostro's ear and tells him to check the math. Cagliostro tells Torgo that they have work to do, and the two go upstairs.

Meanwhile, Timon and Pumbaa make a plan to turn Pumbaa back to normal and then escape the laboratory. After they succeed in getting out of the cage, Pumbaa tries to turn back to normal. In the process, Timon gets caught by Torgo and tries to escape. He gets into the Metamorphitron with Pumbaa and, as a result, becomes ugly, while Pumbaa is turned back to normal.

When Torgo catches Timon and Pumbaa, Timon makes a plan to have the monster turn on his master. Timon convinces Torgo that Cagliostro would soon replace him with another monster, causing him to be enraged and dislike the doctor. When Cagliostro finds Torgo destroying the Metamorphitron and tries to get him to stop, the laboratory explodes and Torgo turns into a beautiful woman. This makes Cagliostro fall in love and decide to marry her, thus becoming the happiest man on earth.
