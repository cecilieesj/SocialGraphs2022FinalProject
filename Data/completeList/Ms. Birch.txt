'''Ms. Birch'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/characters/birch.htm</ref> is a character from the animated series ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. She is [[Hayley Long|Hayley]] and [[Olivia Mears|Olivia]]'s new teacher at the School for Gifted Children, replacing [[Ms. McGuire]] from Season 1.

==Physical Appearance==
Ms. Birch is a slim middle-aged woman (probably around 40-50 years old). She has about shoulder-length dark gray hair tied into a low bun. She wears a teal vest over a plain white shirt, a long dark blue skirt, and a pair of black shoes. She also has a pair of eyeglasses resting at the tip of her nose and a tear-shaped necklace around her neck.

==Personality==
Being a grade school teacher, Ms. Birch is a very friendly and kind person, especially towards children. She stands in front of the school gates every morning to welcome the students in. She constantly praises everyone, and even holds Haley in very high regard and seems to favorite her over other students, as shown when she restlessly waited for her to arrive at school when she came in late<ref name="switch">[[Switcheroo]]</ref>. She always tries to see the positive side of things and will rarely lose her smile.

Although she still retains her positive attitude, Ms. Birch later develops a better sense of discipline towards her students in response to [[Jake]] (trapped in Haley's body) causing constant havoc during class hours<ref name="switch">[[Switcheroo]]</ref>. For example, in the very same episode before this ordeal, she accepts Haley's late entry to school without giving out a sanction. It is no longer the case when Ms. Birch makes a quick reappearance<ref name="being">[[Being Human]]</ref>.

==Episode Appearances==
*''[[Switcheroo]]'' (first appearance)
*''[[Being Human]]'' (final appearance)
==Quotes==
*"Good morning, gifted children."
*"You have a very special sister there, young man."
*"I want you to paint something that inspires you. Reach deep into your gifted souls."
*"''Bonne chance'', ladies!"
*"Well, we've never needed detention at this school." ''(receives egg on her face)'' "...Until now."
*''(disdainfully, to Jake in Haley's body)'' "You're not gonna start throwing paint, are you?"
*"A healthy lunch makes for healthy feet."
