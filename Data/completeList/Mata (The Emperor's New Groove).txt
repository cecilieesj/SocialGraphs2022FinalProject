You're not really gonna listen to Llama Boy, are you?"}}'''Mata''' is a character that was intended to be used in Disney's animated feature ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]],'' then titled ''Kingdom of the Sun,'' as the considered tritagonist. She would have been voiced by Laura Prepon.{{Citation needed}}

==Intended role==
Mata was originally to have been a love interest for [[Kuzco]] who would have aided him on his journey, and later married him. She appears to have had a sarcastic personality, which included calling Kuzco "llama boy".{{Citation needed}}

She was designed by Joe Moshier, while Sandro Cleuzo was to have been her supervising animator. The name Mata was eventually used for [[Mata|the waitress at Mudka's Meat Hut]].{{Citation needed}}

[[Malina]], Kuzco's love interest from the TV series seems to be based on Mata.Â {{Citation needed}}

== Trivia ==
* Despite being drawn only in sketches, Mata bears a slight resemblance to [[Shanti]] in ''[[The Jungle Book 2]].''
* With [[Kuzco]]'s love interest [[Malina]] being based on Mata, whose name would be eventually used for the [[Mata|waitress]], ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'' only partially made good on the ''Kingdom of the Sun'' concept.
* If seen closely, Mata resembles the brides Kuzco was to pick out, possibly inspired by her design.
