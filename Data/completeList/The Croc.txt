The crocodile looks very similar to the American Crocs, [[Brutus and Nero the Crocodiles|Brutus and Nero]], from the film ''[[The Rescuers]]''.

==Role in the series==
The Croc appears as a main threat to the cubs in the episode "How the Panther Lost His Roar." After [[Baloo]] and the other cubs fail to get [[Bagheera]]'s voice back, they head to the river for a swim. Bagheera declines his friends' offer and stays behind. Sometime later, the Croc shows up in the river while [[Arthur and Cecil]] both plot to feast on the cubs, after the crocodile finishes them off. Just as the Croc is about to eat the cubs playing in the river, Bagheera saves them by grabbing the crocodile's tail, but the Croc breaks free and charges toward the cubs. The cubs dodge the crocodile who then crashes intoÂ a tree and faints. Bagheera also gets his voice back after that.

The Croc reappears as a minor threat to both Bagheera and [[Kaa]] in the episode "The Great Kaadini."
