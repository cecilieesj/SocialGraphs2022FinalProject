Carter also appeared in ''Muppets from Space'', as a resident of the Muppet Boarding House and makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''.

The puppet was later recycled as Faversham, [[Miss Piggy]]'s butler (played by [[Steve Whitmire]]), in an appearance on ''Donna's Day'' on September 1, 2000. He converses via telephone with [[Kermit the Frog]] and informs him of Piggy's absence (and also passes on several kisses).

In the third installment of [[Disney Drive-On with The Muppets|Disney Drive-On]], the Carter puppet appears as an elderly Disney animator, the 10th Old Man (in reference to the group of animators known as "The Nine Old Men"). Played by [[Bruce Lanoil]], he's still at work animating the title character from ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953, although the original animation drawings shown were done by [[Milt Kahl]]). He mistakes [[Walter]] for "Mr. Disney" and recalls how he was supposed to get ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' animator [[Marc Davis]]' office.

The puppet's design appears to be reworked from an old lady puppet that was used as part of [[w:c:muppet:Geri and the Atrics|Geri and the Atrics]] on ''The Muppet Show''.
