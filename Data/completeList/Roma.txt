==Background==
Roma made his debut appearance in "[[Ivy's True Colors]]". He was Ivy's only friend on her island. She took him in and cared for him.

He first appears with Ivy while she is looking her butterflies. While Princess Ivy is rude to Sofia, Roma told her she is not so bad. [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and Ivy worked out a compromise and agreed to help each other. After they helped out Gruff the bear, they walked to the other side the island and found the butterflies. However, it turned out they were the helping [[Miss Nettle]] make a cure for the deep sleeps. They ask to burrow Ivy's butterflies, but she refused. Roma led them to the butterfly room and they released them.
