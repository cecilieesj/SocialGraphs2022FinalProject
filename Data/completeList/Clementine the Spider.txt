'''Clementine the Spider''' is a character who appears in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. She is a giant spider that lives in the Nazca Realm.

==Background==
According to [[Mono]], Clementine is described as the scariest of all the Nazca guardians. Clementine's lair is located by the Nazca Gyroscope where she rests inside it. Inside her lair is a large room full of spider webs. It is then known that Clementine likes having a peaceful nap without anyone disturbing her and anyone who yells out loud at her lair would be troubled by the giant spider's anger due to Clementine herself being easily irritated after waking up. 

When [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] wakes up Clementine to send her to go after [[Xandra]], the Caballeros, Mono, and [[Hanzy]], Clementine easily wakes up in an irritated mood instead of following Sheldgoose's orders. This indicates that Clementine was trying to have a peaceful nap rather than listening to Sheldgoose. As she emerges from her lair, Clementine feels overwhelmed that she cannot get a good rest from all the commotion she is hearing. Xandra, José, Panchito, and Donald work together draw a bed for Clementine to which she feels overjoyed, giving the spider a good rest so that Xandra and her allies can continue going after Felldrake.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Nazca Racing]]", [[Mono]], [[Xandra]], [[José Carioca|José]], [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Hanzy]] arrive at Clementine's lair where Mono describes her as the scariest of all the Nazca guardians. Before Donald attempts to leave, Xandra explains that Donald should stick together with her allies by walking quietly past Clementine's lair without disturbing her, just as the six sneak past the web without getting noticed by Clementine where the group arrives at the Nazca Gyroscope area to stop [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]]'s evil plans.

During the race against [[Baron Von Sheldgoose|Sheldgoose]], Felldrake, and [[Leopold the Horrible|Leopold]], the three end up at Clementine's lair where Sheldgoose tells her to come out so that she can go after Xandra, the Caballeros, Mono, and Hanzy. Suddenly, Clementine wakes up from her nap, feeling very furious that Sheldgoose distrubed her nap. As, Mono, Xandra, Josè, Panchito, Donald, and Hanzy attempt to escape, the six suddenly blocked by Clementine as she attempts to eat them just as she attempts to crush Xandra. Feeling enraged, Clementine shoots a web at Donald, just as she attempts to smash Xandra, José, Panchito, and Hanzy, across the lair. Hanzy attempts to get Clementine some rest but she can't listen due to her being overwhelmed to which José offers her to draw something to give her a good rest. Xandra, José, Panchito, and Donald draw a bed for Clementine to which she feels overjoyed, giving the spider a good rest. José then draws a sleeping mask for Clementine while Donald finds himself stuck in a spider web to which his friends plan to rescue him (Donald manages to get free from the web which Clementine threw at her).

==Trivia==
*She is the only guardian of the Nazca Realm that does not appear in real-world form.
