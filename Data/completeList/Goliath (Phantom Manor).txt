'''Goliath''' is a character from the [[Phantom Manor]] attraction at [[Disneyland Paris]].

==History==

===Background===
Goliath is an animate dog corpse that is seen in the grounds of [[Ravenswood Manor]]. He is shown to have an aggressive personality to guests, snarling at unwelcomed visitors who pass by him when at the grounds of the Ravenswood Manor.

===Development History===
Goliath's animatronic had been modified at least three times ever since Phantom Manor opened at [[Disneyland Paris]] on [[April 12]], [[1992]]. On the opening day, Goliath had a snout which resembles that of a coyote and had red eyes over time to give the attraction a frightening theme. Over time, Goliath's design has been modified where his appearance was toned down to make his appearance less intense since the [[2012]] revamp of the attraction. In the [[2019]] revamp of the attraction, Goliath's animatronic became more stocky where his jaw remained realistic and his eyes became green.<ref>https://phantommanorlegends.wordpress.com/tag/goliath/</ref>

==Appearances==

===[[Phantom Manor]]===
When guests arrive at the graveyard scene after passing through [[the Phantom]], they pass through Goliath who snarls ferociously at the guests, implying that he shows an aggressive personality to visitors who pass by him which guests manage to evade the undead dog just in time. This can imply that Goliath is shown to have a hostile, aggressive attitude for visitors who arrive at the Ravenswood Manor grounds 

===Other appearances===
In the ''[[Let's Go to Disneyland Paris]]'' volume, a brief shot of Goliath is seen during the "[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]" sequence where he is seen ferociously snarling at guests riding at Phantom Manor.

==Trivia==
*Goliath appears to be Phantom Manor's counterpart to the [[Caretaker]]'s dog as well as the [[Hellhound]] from the original incarnation of [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|the Haunted Mansion attraction]] at [[Disneyland]], due to his similar-looking appearance.
*In an unused version of a background story for Phantom Manor, it is said that Goliath was the pet of a now-deleted character Arthur Ravenswood where Arthur became sick and the dog was accompanying his owner's side. Additionally in the cemetery of Phantom Manor, Goliath would have received his own tombstone reading, "Goliath, faithful dog and protector, 1859-1867".
