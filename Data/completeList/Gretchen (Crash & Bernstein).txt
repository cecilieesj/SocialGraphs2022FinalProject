'''Gretchen Phlerger''' is the mother of [[Gerry]] and is very similar to her son.

Like her son, Gretchen is very annoying and can sometimes be rude. She can be very sweet and is very artistic. When Crash Bernstein knocks over some shelves of pottery, she gets very angry and yells at Mel, Crash, and Wyatt to get out which makes Gretchen and her son stop seeing them.

When she first met Mel she put on hand sanitizer before shaking her hand and gave her flowers and took the pot that it was in. After realizing how annoying and terrible Gretchen is, Mel apologized to Wyatt and crash for making them hang out with Gerry and then tries to ignore them.
