'''Smokey Bear''' (often called '''Smokey the Bear''' or '''Smokey''') is a mascot of the [[United States]] Forest Service created in [[1944]] to educate the public about the dangers of forest fires. Prior to Smokey's creation, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] loaned the ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]'' characters to the Forest Service for a similar awareness campaign the previous year. He made a cameo in Disney's [[Humphrey the Bear]] cartoon short, ''[[In the Bag]]'', as well as in the {{WikipediaLink|Academy Awards|Academy Award}} winning short, [[It's Tough to Be a Bird|''It's Tough to Be a Bird'']].

Smokey makes a brief cameo as one of the potential ideas for symbols of {{WikipediaLink|Julius Caesar}}'s two empires.
