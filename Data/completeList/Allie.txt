{{Quote|Hm hm hm hm hm, hm hm hm|Allie}}
'''Allie''' is a major character from the popular Disney mobile app ''[[Where's My Water?]]''.

== Appearance ==
Allie takes on the appearance of an anthropomorphic, slender, light green alligator that walks on two legs. She is slightly taller than Swampy but shorter than Cranky. She is easily recognized by her purple bow on her head as well as a purple choker around her neck. Allie's bow is slightly redesigned. Allie also has purple claws, pointy scales and toes. She also has purple eyeshadow with two eyelashes. Allie has four teeth, two on each side (sometimes two on the right and one on the left), three spots on each leg and two faint stripes on her tail. Her belly is yellowish green with a distinctive hourglass shape resembling that of a dress. Her "S" shaped tail look's a lot like Swampy, except its longer and has a ball like tip at the end. Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Allie has four fingers and two toes.

==Role in ''[[Where's My Water?]]''==
In the game, Allie is the only female alligator to inhabit the city sewers. Being the only female, it is no surprise that Allie is the girlfriend of the clan's alpha male [[Cranky]]. In spite of their relationship, Allie gets rather annoyed by Cranky's rude and abrasive nature. Unknowing to Allie, an alligator misfit named Swampy has feelings for her, and tries his best to impress her. Though Allie finds his human-like qualities to be rather strange, she eventually lightens up to Swampy and begins to return the feelings. This angers Cranky which prompts him to make several attempts to sabotage their romance. Thanks to Allie's quick thinking, he ultimately fails.

In the next game, Allie is a musically gifted alligator and she likes to play her steam powered organ, she can also play a flute, trumpet and ukulele flawlessly.  She finds many items unique and loves to explore them. She is charming and sweet toward both Cranky (despite his disgusting habits) but particularly and most notably to Swampy (because he is her boyfriend). Rather than being aggressive as her original counterpart, Allie is fearful under most circumstances. Like Cranky, she is somewhat portrayed as an adult. Although she loves to play with Swampy in certain Cutscenes. Allie is virtually identical to her original counterpart, the only difference is that she is slightly darker and has a shadow that runs from her chin to the base of her tail.

In Swampy's Underground Adventures, Allie is seen to play music through various instruments less frequently. She tends to be a wise and kind alligator in the show. She takes charge when necessary, almost "mothering" the other alligators, mostly Swampy and sometimes Cranky. She is one of the most tolerant alligators in the Sewer, and is often the piece maker of the Sewer's alligators.

===''Allie's Story''===
Allie also appears as the main character of the spin-off which is an in-app purchase in the first game, the story has 4 chapters. Here, players must assist Allie in helping her tune her steam powered organ, much like how they gave Swampy water to take a bath and Cranky purple water to dissolve his food. However, instead of water or purple water, players must use steam to help her. If the player uses water or purple water, he or she will fail and the level must be restarted. 

* "Warming Up": Swampy and Cranky build a huge organ as a special gift for Allie in her new organ room. 
* "Tuning In": Allie performs in a jazz concert while Swampy brings her food and Cranky takes a role of a security guard blocking two gators 
* "Rising to the Top": Allie performs in a rock concert awaking the city while Swampy serves out popcorn and t-shirts alongside with Cranky guarding the gate asking an alligator to pay a pair of fish. 
* "Symphony in Steam": In a theater, Allie performs as the conductor of an orchestra while Swampy and Cranky hold flowers as they watch Allie from behind the curtains. The ending shows Swampy and Cranky (unseen) throwing flowers and a fish to Allie for a great musical performance.

==Trivia==
*Allie is well known for her distinctive hum that sounds like a "Yoo hoo".
*It's possible her full name (Allie Gator) could actually be a pun of "Alligator", which makes sense being that she is one.
*Some fans predicted that her story might involve using a slimy fluid called Ooze, as Swampy used Water, and Cranky used Poison but no one used mud, though it's not clear how Mud would effectively be used.
*It was confirmed, however, that Allie's story actually uses steam, '''not''' ooze.
*As shown in Allie's Story she has a passion for music.
*Allie is voiced by Rebecca Metz
*She seems to resemble a caiman.
*Just like all the Alligators in the sewer, Allie has four fingers and two toes. But real gators have 5 toes on the front legs while the back legs have only 4 toes.
