'''Elvira''' was a deleted character from ''[[The Aristocats]]''. She was [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamillie's]] maid who assisted [[Edgar Balthazar|Edgar]] in his scheme to get rid of the cats. She and Edgar were to have sung a deleted song entitled "How Much You Mean to Me/Court Me Slowly" in which the butler would have attempted to propose to her so that he could have access to her share of Madame's fortune. For her part of the song, Elvira was to have instructed Edgar to court her based on the way her marriage handbook said.
