'''Cleo''' is [[Geppetto]]'s pet goldfish in [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]]'s [[1940]] animated film, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''.

== Background ==

=== Personality ===
Cleo is affectionate, innocent, sweet, obedient, and loyal.

=== Physical appearance ===
Cleo is a small and slender goldfish with four orange fins. The scales on her upper body are orange while her lower body's scales are yellow. Her face is a peachy color which has powder blue eyelids, purplish-brown eyes, rosy cheeks and red lips.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pinocchio]]''===
Cleo is always seen in her fishbowl, often reacting or responding to a situation through silent smiles and water twirls. She appears to be very affectionate, specifically toward Geppetto and Figaro (who seems to hold a mild dislike toward her). When asked by Geppetto whether or not the name "Pinocchio" sounds any good for his latest puppet creation, Cleo shows her distaste, but the name goes through, anyway. Later on, when [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] is given life by the [[Blue Fairy]], he is sent off to school along with the other children. Excited to have a family, Geppetto sets up a delicious dinner, including a small piece of cake for Cleo. Unfortunately, Pinocchio does not return, resulting in Cleo, Geppetto, and Figaro heading out to find them. The trio ends up in the belly of [[Monstro]] the Whale, and eventually, give up any hope of escape. As such, Cleo begins to build her own tombstones, knowing she will perish, along with her loved ones, should they not escape or manage to eat. Surprisingly, Pinocchio arrives and concocts a way to free them. The plan succeeds but results in Pinocchio's demise. Geppetto, Cleo, and the others return to their village home and mourn the death of the little wooden boy, only to find his act of bravery granted his revival (via the Blue Fairy). Once this realization dons upon Cleo and the others, a celebration is held.

===''[[Figaro and Cleo]]''===
Cleo played a role in the short under the care of a woman by the name of [[Mammy Two Shoes|Aunt Delilah]] (Mammy Two Shoes). Here, Figaro tries various methods of trying to get Cleo for his supper, only to be stopped by Delilah each time.

===Other appearances===
The model sheet for Cleo was reused for the featured fish solo dancer in the "Arabian Dance" segment of "The Nutcracker Suite" in ''[[Fantasia]]''. Though her fins were made longer to make her a more graceful and sensual dancer.

In ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', Cleo appeared briefly, having an encounter with Jiminy, the film's host.

In the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' television series]], Cleo also made a cameo in an episode inside the whale with [[Figaro]], while Genie looked like Geppetto.

Cleo makes a cameo in ''[[DuckTales]]'' as [[Gyro Gearloose]]'s fish.

Cleo has appeared in the [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]] (specifically in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', and ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'') as is a background character who is often found alongside [[Geppetto]].

Cleo also made occasional appearances in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. In "[[The Mouse Who Came to Dinner]]", she makes a cameo sitting with Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Figaro clapping after the cartoon.

Cleo makes a cameo on the last page of issue #7 of the ''Darkwing Duck'' comic book, along with [[Sebastian]] and [[Dory]], reacting in shock to the return of the monstrous Paddywhack.

==Live-action appearances==
