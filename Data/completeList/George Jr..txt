==Role in the films==
===''[[George of the Jungle]]''===
Junior is born toward the end of the film and he is revealed to have inherited George's clumsiness of bumping into things when he accidentally bumps his chin on an overspreading branch in the treehouse.

George and Ursula then show him to the land (a preference of ''[[The Lion King]]'').

=== ''[[George of the Jungle 2]]'' ===
Five years have passed and Junior is being taught by George his duties as heir apparent to the jungle throne.

However he prefers vine surfing to George's vine swinging.

On his birthday, George gives Junior a spear which he shows great appreciation for. However his grandmother, [[Beatrice Stanhope]], has come for a visit and showers him with loads of expensive gifts. She is secretly planning to break George and Ursula up and teams up with George's enemy, [[Lyle Van de Groot]], to destroy Ape Mountain so he can have her as his wife.

Ursula is later hypnotized into believing Lyle is her husband and is forced to go to [[San Francisco]].

George however manages to free Ursula from the hypnotism, defeat Lyle and Beatrice and save Ape Mountain.

He is then seeing George and Ursula getting remarried and George promising him that he will try to spend more time with him.

He is finally seen with George heading for the treehouse for lunch with the latter crashing into the side of it.
