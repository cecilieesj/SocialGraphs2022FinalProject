|quote = }}'''Red Bat''' is [[Fethry Duck]]'s superheroic alter ego. His first appearance and origin story was "Who Is the Red Bat", published in Brazil on [[1973]] in ''Edição Extra #53''.

==Role in the comics==
Since the early [[1970]]s, Fethry has occasionally donned superhero garb and called himself the '''Red Bat''' (not related to the villain of the same name whom [[Mickey Mouse]] faced in his heroic guise as "Plastic Mickey"). Occasionally, [[Gloria]], Fethry's girlfriend (created by Gerson Luiz Borlotti Texeira), would team up with the Red Bat as another costumed crime-fighter called the '''Purple Butterfly''' (Borboleta Purpurea). Even Fethry's nephew, [[The Duck Family|Dugan]], has donned a costume and called himself '''Red Bat Junior'''.

==Trivia==
*Fethry/Red Bat wears different colors of the same blouse, depending on which country the story is published in (e.g. in Brazil, his blouse is generally yellow; in the Italian comics, he usually wears a red one; and, in the comic books of [[Egmont Group|Egmont Publishing]], the traditional color of his blouse is pink).
*It is revealed in "The Health Nut" that Fethry/Red Bat wears a stocking cap because he was convinced by a self-help book author that one's head is healthier when it is kept hot.
