The '''Wax figures''' are living wax sculptures that appear in the ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' episode "[[Headhunters]]". They were stowed away in the [[The Mystery Shack|Mystery Shack]] by [[Stan Pines]] ten years ago, and attempted to murder Stan for leaving them in storage.

==Background==
===Personality===
The wax figures share similar personalities and mannerisms with the historical figures they were based on despite being aware of their replica status. But they can fully cooperate with each other and share the same opinions and feelings, including enjoying time together and getting revenge on Stan for locking them away. The wax figures' curse allows them to only come alive during a waxing moon, so they are only active during the nighttime.

==Role in the series==
When [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]], [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] discover the room the figures were kept in, Stan explains the history of the figures as once being the star attraction at the Mystery Shack. The group decide to reopen the wax museum again, although Wax Abraham Lincoln had melted beforehand, so Mabel decides to create a [[Wax Stan|wax replica of Stan]] to replace it.

The next day, the family has a grand re-opening of the Wax Museum. However, due to false advertising from Stan, the conference is cut short and the crowd bitterly leaves. That night, Stan leaves Wax Stan in his chair while he went to the bathroom. Wax Sherlock Holmes then comes and beheads Wax Stan believing he was Stan, and is forced to leave with Wax Stan's head after discovering his error. During Wax Stan's funeral, the twins discover that the culprit had a hole in their footprint just like Wax Stan's shoes and the rest of the wax figures have. It is then that they realize that the wax figures murdered Wax Stan, and the wax figures behind them come to life and threaten to kill Dipper and Mabel. Wax Sherlock Holmes reveals that Stan bought them from a garage sale ten years ago for the Mystery Shack's wax attraction, but were then abandoned by Stan when sales dropped, so they wanted revenge against Stan. The wax figures then try to kill them, but the twins manage to destroy all of them and reclaim Wax Stan's head. However, Wax Larry King survives with only his head intact and roams the vents of the Mystery Shack.

During "[[Weirdmageddon]]," Wax Larry King's head is present among the survivors in the Mystery Shack. He is used as the flag topper of the rebels' flag.
