'''Saoirse Bullion-O'Callaghan''' is a major characters in ''[[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]]. ''She is the mystery girl who comes to the Enchanted Tiki Room to steal [[Michael]].

== Background ==
Saoirse came to the Enchanted Tiki room to steal one of the [[Enchanted Tiki Room Birds|birds]]. Her father was neglectful of her, and she believes that this will get her to pay attention to her. She faced many trials to get there, such as stowing away in luggage or hiding in trains. When she reached the Tiki Room, she took [[Michael]] and put him in a cage.

The other characters chased her around the island into a temple, where she came clean about her story. She was almost kidnapped by a strange being, but was let go when he realized that he was in the wrong place. She was forced to go back home empty handed until the [[Orange Bird]] gave her a present - two tickets for the Tiki Room.

After her and her father reconcile when he realized the error of his ways, they returned to the Tiki Room together.

== Trivia ==
* Given her name, it is likely that she is a descendant of [[Barnabas T. Bullion]] and his family from ''[[Disney Kingdoms: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]''. Notably, she has [[Abigail Bullion]]'s red hair.
