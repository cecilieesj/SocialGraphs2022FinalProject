}}'''Fall-Apart Rabbit''' is a friend of [[Bonkers D. Bobcat]] who appeared in the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episodes directed by Robert Taylor. He is a yellow bunny with detachable body parts (somewhat like [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]), and as his name suggests, they tend to fall off easily. In the series, Fall-Apart worked as Bonkers' stunt double at Wackytoons Studios until his show was cancelled. He mostly appears in the Lucky episodes.
