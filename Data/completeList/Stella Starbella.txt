== Background ==
Stella made her debut in "[[The Loose Screw]]". She is an elderly and somewhat senile superheroine who has been fighting crime since her youth. Despite her feeble appearance, she was once the greatest heroine in the galaxy and the arch-enemy of the galaxy's former greatest villain, [[Mandrake the Malfeasant]].

== Personality ==
Starbella is a very feeble and possibly senile old woman who often says nonsensical things. Despite this, she is still a very heroic and competent crime fighter who, despite her mental state, is still a great superhero in peak physical condition.

She joins Wander and a group of rebels to fight [[Lord Dominator]] in "[[The End of the Galaxy]]".

== Trivia ==
* She is based on and is an amalgamation of Stella Star (from the cult classic ''Starcrash)'' and Barbarella (a space-travelling comic book heroine).
