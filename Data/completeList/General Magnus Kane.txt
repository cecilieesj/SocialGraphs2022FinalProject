== Biography ==
General Magnus Kane is the dictatorial leader of Costa Estrella. He is planning to unite Costa Luna and Costa Estrella under his rule as ''Presidente de la República de la Costas'' (President of the Republic of the Coasts).

== Role in the film ==
During [[Rosie Gonzalez|Princess Rosalinda]]'s coronation rehearsal, General Kane appears and throw a sword at the crown where the archbishop was holding. He objects to the coronation as he thinks that Rosalinda is too young to be ruler of a small country and declares himself be the ruler instead. He then summons his army soldiers who raids the castle and kidnaps everyone there. Rosalinda and her mother, [[Queen Sophia]], flee with an agent named Joe Mason, who is part of an organization known as the Princess Protection Program, and helps Rosalinda escape the country on a helicopter. As the queen watches them leave, General Magnus appears before her and assures her that Rosalinda will return and he will capture her by then. He then orders one of his men to take the Queen away.

Later, General Kane plots to marry Queen Sophia, in order to lure Rosalinda out of her hiding place so that he could put them both in exile. After discovered General Kane's plan via [[Chelsea Barnes|Chelsea]] and [[Brooke Angels|Brooke]], Rosalinda is distraught and makes up her mind to leave without anyone knowing besides [[Carter Mason|Carter]]. Carter knows what will happen if Rosie goes back, so she asks her to do her one last favor and stay until after the homecoming dance. Rosie agrees to wait to return to Costa Luna until after the dance. Unbeknownst to her, Carter calls Rosalinda's royal dress designer, Mr. Elegante, and asks him to send 2 dresses as part of a plan to save Rosie, the Queen, and Costa Luna. To carry out their plan, Mr. Elegante pretends to betray Rosie's whereabouts to General Kane in order to lure him to [[Louisiana]]. Carter's plan is to use herself as a bait to get General Kane to expose himself. He then flies to Louisiana with his henchmen in order to try to abduct Rosie. As part of Carter's plan, she poses as Rosie by wearing a dress of the same color that General Kane was informed that Rosie would be wearing, and is taken away to his helicopter. Unbeknownst to him, Major Mason and his Princess Protection Program agents have sneak their way into the helicopter and then arrest General Kane along with his henchmen, turning him over to the international authorities.

== Trivia ==
* His country, Costa Estrella, literally means "Star Coast" in Spanish.
* In one scene when General Kane tells Queen Sophia about his evil plan to become the new ruler of Costa Luna, the queen angrily replies that her people will never accepted it. Kane then tells her that the people of Costa Estrella had also had the same statement 20 years prior to his ruling over the country, implying that General Kane, somehow, is not the country's rightful ruler.
* It is unknown what happened to his country after his arrest.
* Kane is a fictional character. However, if he were real, he would be the first ruling head of state in history who had been arrested on foreign soil, and would also be the first ruling head of state who had personally traveled to another country to abduct someone.
