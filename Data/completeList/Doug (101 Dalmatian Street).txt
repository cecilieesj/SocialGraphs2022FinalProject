'''Doug''' is a character from ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''. He is an American Dalmatian who moved to [[London]] to become a firefighter dog. It is there he met and married [[Delilah (101 Dalmatian Street)|Delilah]], a descendant of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]. The two also have a large litter of puppies from previous marriages which, when combined together, make a total of 99.

==Background==
In some early concepts, Doug was planned to have an appearance almost identical to Pongo, with black ears and a red collar. Whether or not he was originally planned to be Pongo before being altered is not known at this time.

==Role in the series==
Doug is a regular in the series; while he works all day as a fire dog, his eldest pups, stepson [[Dylan]] and daughter [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]], watch over their miscellaneous younger siblings.

In the episode "[[Dog's Best Friend (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dog's Best Friend]]", Doug returns home from the night shift before he gets glomped by the puppies. He tries to get some sleep but is woken from the sound of a human, which Dee-Dee and Dizzy adopted for Dylan. He tries to tell Dylan what a big responsibility a human is, but gets trampled when he mentions the park. Later, when the food machine is out of control, Doug tries to keep the situation calm but gets covered by bowls and kibble. Doug then advises Dylan on what to do about the human they have adopted.

In "[[Boom Night]]", Doug helps fit earmuffs onto the other pups during the titular event to protect the children from the disruptive sounds before he and Delilah head to their respective jobs. Doug is more anxious than Delilah about the night, vocally questioning why the humans do it every year. Before he heads to work, Doug gets tearful and calls for a group hug from all the pups. He is later seen in a fire truck, howling in rhythm to the siren, where he almost notices Dolly and Dylan outside.

In "[[Snow Day (101 Dalmatian Street)|Snow Day]]", Doug is off work with London being closed due to snow. As such, he decides to prep his kids for a family outing in the park when they ask to go. He first tries to get the pups into warm winter wear by being "The Hat Reindeer", placing wool hats on the heads of his children one at a time. He and Delilah agree to a contest against Dylan and Dolly to see who gets the pups prepared the fastest.

In "[[A Summer to Remember]]", Doug and Delilah start the family vacation off dealing with their children constantly asking if they are in Cornwall yet until they arrive. Upon getting to the beach, he and Delilah try to have some romantic alone time, only for the pups to interrupt them.

In "[[Fetch (101 Dalmatian Street)|Fetch]]", Delilah & Doug are celebrating their anniversary. According to Doug, the two had their first drink together by the pond in the park.

==Trivia==
*While all the other puppies refer to him as "Dad" or "Father", [[Dawkins]] still refers to Doug by name, suggesting that Dawkins is one of his stepsons.
**Dawkins does refer to Doug as "Dad" in "[[Balancing Act (101 Dalmatian Street)|Balancing Act]]", but not in Doug's presence.
*Compared to other adult Dalmatians, particularly those who appear in family pictures around the house where he resides, Doug is a very muscular Dalmatian.
*In the first episode, "[[Dog's Best Friend]]", Doug mistakenly said that 100 human years would equal 700 dog years. This calculation was based on the myth that 1 dog year equals 7 human years. In reality, the first year of a dog's life is equal to 15 human years. The second year for a dog equals about nine years for a human (a 2-year-old dog is 24 years old in dog years). And after that, each human year would be approximately four years for a dog. 100 human years is equal to 416 dog years.<ref>https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/</ref>
