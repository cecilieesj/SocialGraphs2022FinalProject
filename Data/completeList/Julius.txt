'''Julius''' is a gigantic monster that first appeared in the [[1995]] short, ''[[Runaway Brain]]''. Bearing striking physical and vocal similarities to [[Pete|Peg-Leg Pete]], Julius was created by the wicked [[Doctor Frankenollie]]. As part of the mad doctor’s experiment, Julius’s brain and body were swapped with an unsuspecting [[Mickey Mouse]], leading to citywide chaos as Julius pursues Mickey’s girlfriend, [[Minnie Mouse]].

==Role in the short==
Julius is unleashed from his lair under Frankenollie's lab to switch brains with Mickey Mouse and the experiment was done successfully although it killed Frankenollie in the process, however, Julius and Mickey not only switched brains but bodies as well. In Mickey's body, Julius was able to view Mickey's wallet where he finds a picture of Mickey and Minnie. He develops feelings for her and rushes out to find her. He spots her at a shopping store and enters to proclaim his love. Minnie thinks it is Mickey she is talking to, and when the real Mickey in Julius' body enters to save her, she attacks him. Mickey is able to explain and battles Julius while Minnie is safe on top of a skyscraper. Mickey and Julius end up being electrocuted on cable wires, switching back in the process. Now that Julius is in his rightful body, he has a better chance of destroying Mickey and getting Minnie. Still, Mickey manages to free Minnie from his grasp. He is accidentally knocked off the building by Minnie, but is pulled up repeatedly like a yo-yo as he is tied to a rope attached to a moving Hawaiian girl's arm on a billboard. In the end, Mickey and Minnie use Julius to pull a raft to Hawaii for vacation.

==Video games==
===''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''===
Julius appears as a secret boss in the game, located in [[Traverse Town]]. He emerges from a sewer grate below to the surface to attack [[Sora]] or [[Riku]]. After defeating him, he retreats back to the sewer grate in sudden panic, and Sora or Riku earn the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Ultima Weapon|Ultima Weapon]] [[Keyblade]]. He's the first secret boss in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series to be a Disney character that is not exclusive to the series. Why he attacked the boys, or how he found his way to Traverse Town, is unknown.

As with other past secret bosses having some importance in the story of the next game (such as [[Sephiroth]] being part of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' story or [[Young Xehanort]] from ''Dream Drop Distance''), he doesn't seem to share this factor.

Much like Pete himself in the Japanese versions, Julius by proxy is voiced by the late Tōru Ōhira.
