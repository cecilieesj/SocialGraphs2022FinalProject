== Role in the Series ==
=== "[[The Little Guy (The Lion Guard)|The Little Guy]]" ===
Hodari wants to be a crocodile. He asks [[Makuu]] if he could be part of [[Makuu's Float|his float]]. Makuu says no and Hodari runs off. He meets [[Shupavu]] and [[Njano]] and they say that they know another crocodile. Hodari asks [[Kiburi]] if he can join [[Kiburi's Float|their float]]. After doing the crocodile inanition spar Hodari joins them. They soon head into the [[Pride Lands]] but is stopped by the [[Lion Guard]]. Hodari gets confused when [[Beshte]] tells them that they're bad guys. Hodari gets mad at him and leaves. Kiburi's float soon fights Makuu's float and Hodari knows he's on the wrong side. He sees Beshte and Beshte says that he'll always be his friend until the Pride Lands end. Hodari soon helps Makuu get out of the fight he's having with Kiburi. [[Kion]] soon uses his [[Roar of the Elders]] on Kiburi's float. Hodari then becomes a member as Makuu's float.

== Relationships ==
=== Friends ===
====[[Beshte]]====
Hodari and Beshte are good friends. Beshte tells Hodari to follow his dreams of being a crocodile. Hodari asks Beshte if he would introduce him to Makuu. When Hodari asked to join his float they laughed at him. Hodari briefly fell out with Beshte when the gecko fell into Kiburi's trap, and believed that Beshte was just angry at him for following his dream with a crocodile that Beshte did not approve of. However, later, when Kiburi betrayed Hodari, he was surprised to hear that the hippo still cared for him despite his actions, and helped him to save Makuu.

====[[Makuu]]====
At first, Makuu gives doubts about Hodari, and thinks his dream of being a crocodile completely ridiculous but when Kiburi nearly ended his life, Hodari reminded him to use a new move they had been practicing, and was able to get Kiburi off himself.

After the fight, Makuu asked Hodari if he still wanted to join the float, as a thank you for saving his life, to which Hodari happily accepts and is announced an honorary crocodile.

As of now currently, they seem to be on friendly terms, with Makuu respecting Hodari for saving him and for showing the bravery and the heart of a crocodile and it looks like the gecko respects him as well.

==Trivia==
*Unlike most reptiles in the series, Hodari is capable of standing and walking on his hind legs.
*Hodari is based on an endangered African gecko called the William's dwarf gecko.
**In real life, geckos don’t have eyelids and therefore can't blink, with the exception of banded geckos and leopard geckos.
