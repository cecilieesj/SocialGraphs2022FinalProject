Despite other chiefs being depicted as dogfaces, the Grand Mogul has a bill. A running gag about the character is that "Mogul" (or another one of his countless pompous titles) is an acronym with a different meaning each time. 
== Trivia ==
* In the ''Junior Woodchucks'' comic ''Let Sleeping Bones Lie'' (written by [[Carl Barks]], published in ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #358), the Grand Mogul's full name is given as Philodemus Gentlefogg.
* While it is likely that the Grand Mogul is a Goose (due to his full name being specified as Bertie '''McGoose''' in Italian Disney comics), it is unknown to which species he belongs.
**In Carl Barks' ''The Hound of the Whiskervilles'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #29), Scrooge briefly refers to a group of clansmen as members of the "Clan McGoose".
