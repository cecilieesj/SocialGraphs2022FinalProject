'''Lieutenant Commander Theodore Groves''' is a British Royal Navy Officer under [[James Norrington|Commodore Norrington]]'s command in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''.

==Plot==
He is present when [[Jack Sparrow]] steals the H.M.S. ''Interceptor'' and notes Sparrow's cleverness, saying "That's got to be the best pirate I have ever seen", the opposite of Norrington's oft-stated opinion that Sparrow is "without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". He is absent in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean:  Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'', but reappears in the third movie. Between the events of ''Dead Man's Chest'' and ''At World's End'', Lieutenant Groves is appointed as [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett's]] second-in-command aboard the H.M.S. ''Endeavour''. He stars in ''At World's End'' aboard the ''Endeavour'' and is present when Captain Jack Sparrow makes a daring escape from Cutler Beckett's grasp. He admiringly wonders if Jack plans everything out or just makes it up as he goes along but is scared off by a glare from Beckett. During the final battle, he asks Cutler Beckett for orders as the H.M.S. ''Endeavour'' was being pounded by the [[Black Pearl|''Black Pearl'']]'s and the [[Flying Dutchman|''Flying Dutchman'']]'s cannons. Beckett remains in a state of shock during the entire battle, forcing Lieutenant Groves to order the crew to abandon ship. Somehow he is picked up by the Armada and saved by the British soldiers. Groves later resurfaces in the events of ''On Stranger Tides'', and is promoted to Lieutenant Commander while working under [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] to find the [[Fountain of Youth]] aboard the H.M.S. ''Providence''. He accompanies Barbossa on the shores of [[Whitecap Bay]], only to be stranded there with the beach party as flesh-eating [[Mermaids (Pirates of the Caribbean)|mermaids]] tear the Providence apart along with its crew. He scolds Barbossa for not helping the crew as the ''Providence'' is attacked by the mermaids but Barbossa warns him to remain silent.[[File:Grovesshot.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Theodore Groves' death]]While Captain Jack Sparrow and Barbossa were held captive by the Spaniards, Lieutenant Commander Groves snuck through the Spanish picket lines (aided by a distraction Jack Sparrow made in a daring escape) and freed Barbossa from his bonds, although he lost his wig during the venture. He reached the Fountain of Youth with Barbossa and fought off [[Blackbeard]]'s crew seeing his fellow generals and soldiers being rapidly killed by the crew. The fight is stopped by the sudden arrival of the Spanish. Trying one last time to get a British victory in the quest, Groves stood defiantly on top of the fountain claiming the Fountain to be property of the British Empire while holding a British flag. But at the same moment, the Spaniard shot Groves. When the Spanish began destroying the Fountain of Youth, Groves' body was being carried away by two British officers.
