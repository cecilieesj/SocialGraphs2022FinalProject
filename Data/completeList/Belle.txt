'''Belle''' is the female protagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1991]] animated feature film, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. She is the only daughter of [[Maurice]], an inventor with whom she resides in a small [[Village (Beauty and the Beast)|French village]]. The townsfolk labeled Belle an outcast because of her free spirit. She is also a proud bibliophile, her favorite genres being fantasy and adventure. Belle's passion for fantastical stories, coupled with her outcast status, left her yearning for a life of adventure outside her small village. She unexpectedly gets her wish when she becomes the [[Beast]]'s prisoner in order to save her father's life.

Belle is also the fifth official member of the [[Disney Princess]] line-up.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Far-off places, daring sword fights, a prince in disguise, Belle longs for so much more than a "normal life" in this small, provincial town - a town where girls don't aspire to more than marrying well. Still, adventure is the last thing on her mind when she rides her horse, Philippe, into the forest to find her beloved father, who is missing. Thinking only of her father, she makes a bargain with a Beast who holds her father captive in his castle. Though the Beast now holds the key to Belle's prison, he doesn't have the key to her heart, and her yearning spirit won't be kept prisoner. But after he risks his own life to save hers, she begins to see past his appearance. She realizes that deep inside him there might be something more than she - or he - has ever dreamed.''

===Development===
When production first started on ''Beauty and the Beast'', Belle's characterization was initially slightly closer to that of the original tale, being slightly timid yet also caring. In the first draft, she also had to contend with [[Belle's Sisters|two elder sisters]] who, similar to in the original tale, utterly hated her because she received more attention than them, especially regarding [[Belle's suitors|potential suitors]]. In the second draft, she largely retained the traits from the first draft, although she also had a sister named [[Clarice (Beauty and the Beast)|Clarice]] (whom, unlike her sisters in the first draft, genuinely cared for Belle's well-being) as well as a snobbish aunt named Marguerite (who would have been the movie's equivalent of Belle's wicked sisters from the original tale and first draft). However, after the [[1989]] storyboard reel was presented, then-Disney Chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered it to be rewritten from scratch, both due to viewing it as too dark and dramatic, and because he envisioned a Broadway-like film with a "feminist twist" to the original tale. To accomplish this, he hired [[Linda Woolverton]], who at the time had just started film screenwriting and her only other experience with Disney was writing some episodes of their various Saturday Morning cartoons. Woolverton based Belle on Katharine Hepburn's role of Jo March from the film adaptation of the book, "''Little Women''", and avoided using the Jean Cocteau film as a template for Belle and the film, even going as far as to avoid seeing the film. She also gave Belle a love of literature to show her open-mindedness. She also made sure to make Belle a feminist in order to have her stand apart from [[Ariel]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', as she didn't want "another insipid princess", taking notes from the women's movement to create her character. Paige O'Hara requested that Belle, similar to Jerry Orbach's handling of Lumiere in the same film, possess a French accent, although unlike Orbach, Disney refused the request.

===Personality===
[[File:Beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-356.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Belle reading a book.]]
Belle has gained a significant amount of intelligence over the years due to her love of books, which provided her with an elevated vocabulary, an active imagination, and an open mind. She is very confident and outspoken in her opinions and seldom likes being told what to do. Despite all this, she doesn't have very many friends. Her smarts and free-thinking attitude make her stand out from her fellow townspeople, who regard her as a little odd behind her beauty.

Belle is known throughout the village for her beauty, with one villager commenting that it has no parallel, but she isn't vain or concerned about her looks, although she knows it. She is only too aware that her fellow citizens think of her as "odd" and "peculiar".

Belle appears less concerned about her or others' appearances and is able to look past appearances into their personality. In addition, Belle pays very little attention or concern to her appearance, unlike the very rude and arrogant Gaston. This is how she manages to break the [[Beast]]'s curse and bring love and laughter to the castle.

Belle is somewhat of a free woman for her time and resists being mistreated, undermined, humiliated, demeaned, or controlled by anyone, especially and specifically by [[Gaston]]. She does not appear to be receptive to Gaston's description of marriage together, such as having six to seven sons or rubbing his feet. Even when agreeing to live under the Beast's control, she acts independently.

Belle willingly listens to, takes advice from, and admires her father [[Maurice]] since, throughout most of her life, he's the only person who has believed in her unconditionally. She also considers the opinions and directions of the Beast, because, like Maurice, he is able to treat her as an equal (the Beast eventually learned how throughout the course of the film). Belle also seemed to have a good relationship with [[The Bookseller|the bookseller]], presumably because of his encouraging her to pursue her love of literature.

Belle's compassionate heart and warm nature also embeds in an impressively brave woman that neither listens nor cares about what the other townspeople say about her. She refuses Gaston's wedding proposal and remains the only girl to resist his "charms" due to his rude, sexist demeanor instead of mindlessly lavishing over him based purely on the physical. Her most triumphant moments in the movie are when she willingly trades her freedom for her father's without much hesitation, and manage to stand up against the Beast at certain points. However, like any human, Belle does fear things, such as wolves, Beast's castle, family disappearance, etc. The Beast also, at first, manages to make the situation of her predicament as a prisoner, never to see her father or dreams again, come crushing down in tears. Especially when her captor himself is 10 feet, easily angered monster which commands her entire life. Nevertheless, the unconditional love Belle places to those close to her, including the Beast eventually, make her strong enough to risk her life for theirs.

Belle is quite stubborn when it comes to stating and upholding her opinions and maintaining her ideas. Even though she says that she dreams of adventure, she also states that she wishes for a friend who accepts her for who she is. This is because everyone in town criticizes her for doing her own thing and can't understand her, making her feel like she can't fit in. However, even when people give her a hard time, she never changes but comes to a better understanding of herself. This makes the biggest difference when she breaks the spell and charms the Beast just by being herself.

The Disney comic ''New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast'', set a few years before the first film's events, implies that Belle didn't believe in the supernatural despite her love of fairy tales. This is evidenced while she explores a part of the Black Forest before encountering an owl and thinks that there aren't any mythical creatures in there. This is also supported in the film, where she yells "this is impossible" in shock after accidentally bumping into the Wardrobe in shock upon discovery that Mrs. Potts and her fellow servants were living objects.

Belle is quite witty and uses this trait to her advantage to outsmart people. When in an argument with the Beast, Belle held her ground and challenged each of the Beast's points with a cunning comeback, such as "If you hadn't frightened me I wouldn't have run away" or "You should learn to control your temper". Each of these statements left the Beast stunned and at a loss for words. Belle managed to think of these comebacks without much thought or hesitation. When [[Lumiere]] and [[Cogsworth]] attempted to lead Belle's curiosity away from the West Wing, she challenged them by saying the West Wing wouldn't be forbidden if the Beast wasn't hiding something in it, also briefly stunning them. Belle's logic may also have helped her save Maurice by realizing that something was going on in the castle that she wanted to find out. Soon, in the West Wing, she almost discovers the Beast's true identity, though she briefly forgets it in the end.

Belle has a strong sense of character and uses this trait in a variety of ways, often to her own advantage. On Belle's first night in the castle, following the "[[Be Our Guest]]" sequence, she develops an urge to explore the castle and asks for a guide. Observing Cogsworth's "authoritative" personality, she immediately knows that Cogsworth would be the best candidate. At first, Cogsworth is quite reluctant to the idea, but when Belle says she is sure he knows everything about the castle, he agrees. Similarly, she also has a strong sense of deductive reasoning, as she deduced from the animate objects' interactions that the castle in which she was imprisoned was enchanted without anyone telling her beforehand.

She is also implied to have deduced Gaston's true role in locking Maurice up. This, however, was contradicted when she exposed the Beast's existence to a congregated mob despite the high likelihood that they would turn and kill the Beast due to their current emotional state, as well as being shocked by Gaston and the villagers doing exactly that. This makes Belle feel so guilty that she resolves to stop Gaston and save the Beast, her true love.

Belle's personality transforms throughout the film. At first, she frequently dreams about a life of adventure and romance, not realizing that sometimes adventures might take a turn for the worse. As Belle begins to spend more time with the Beast and their relationship blossoms into a strong friendship, she begins to fall in love with him without realizing it.

===Physical appearance===
Like her namesake, Belle is known in her village for her beauty, mainly her outer features. Belle has long, brown hair, most often tied back in a low ponytail with a blue ribbon, and possesses captivating hazel eyes, full pink lips, rosy cheeks, a heart-shaped face, and a sculpted figure. One of her more distinct features is the strands of hair that are constantly slipping loose from her ponytail and falling in front of her face - she is often seen brushing them back into place when nervous or trying to be polite.

Throughout the film, Belle wears various outfits depending on the occasion:

Her primary outfit is a medium-length cerulean blue sleeveless dress with a white long-sleeved button-up shirt underneath, a white apron on her waist, a white petticoat, and brown ballet flats on her feet. Her hair is tied in a low ponytail adorned with a medium blue ribbon. When she goes to the Beast's castle, she wears a dark blue cloak. Belle's hair is loose twice in the film, the first time when the ribbon on her ponytail is torn off by one of the wolves, and the second when she removes the ribbon before finding the Beast during his fight with Gaston.

The day that Belle was gifted the castle's library, she wore a green dress (similar to the color scheme of [[Ariel]] from ''The Little Mermaid'') with a matching hair ribbon, a white petticoat underneath the dress and black ballet flats, and outside when she was tending to Philippe and [[Sultan (Beauty and the Beast)|Sultan]] she added her traditional dark blue cloak.

When she was reading to the Beast, Belle wore a pink/rose dress (similar to [[Aurora]]'s from ''Sleeping Beauty'') with a matching hair ribbon, a white petticoat, and red ballet flats and when she was outside teaching the Beast to feed the birds she added a red cloak with white fur trim.

Her most elaborate and iconic dress is a golden ball gown with a simply designed bodice, wrapped off-the-shoulder sleeves, long yellow opera gloves matching her outfit, a gold wide-hemmed floor-length skirt made of 8 triangular panels and a multiple-layered white petticoat with scalloped edging on the hemline, and yellow high-heeled shoes. This is the dress she wears while sharing her first dance with the Beast in the "[[Beauty and the Beast (song)|Beauty and the Beast]]" sequence, and their second dance after the curse is broken. With this outfit, she wears some of her hair in a neat bun, but the majority of it trails down her neck in a beautiful, flowing motion resembling a ponytail.

In ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]'', Belle wears a long deep red winter coat with a white fur collar, belt, and folded sleeves while wearing her primary outfit with short brown gloves and brown boots with white fur cuffs. At the end of the film, set after the curse was broken, Belle wears a deep red rose dress which resembles the color of a red rose with light yellow bell-bottoms at the sleeves and deep red roses-like decorations with green leaves, a deep red hair ribbon, a pearl necklace, a light yellow lining connected to her bodice and the end of her dress skirt, a deep red bow on the waist back of her dress, a white petticoat, and deep red high-heeled shoes.

Overall, when she first enters the Beast's castle, her outfit wasn't adapted to the castle, but as the film moves on, her outfit started progressively shifting to more formal and elegant dresses, signifying her growing more attached to the castle and its inhabitants as the Beast reforms into a well-behaved gentleman.

===Abilities===
*'''Peak-Human Agility:''' Belle displays a few notable athletic abilities despite having spent her life in the village. She can ride her horse, Philippe, at quite stunning speeds with ease and skill, such as in the Black Forest when she managed to outrun the wolves for a time and even causing one wolf to veer into a tree. During the opening song, while reading her new book, she also managed to effortlessly sweep aside a water downpour from gutters that was about to hit her, deflecting it onto a nearby signpost, all without even looking up from her book, implying that she was keenly aware of her surroundings.
*'''Peak-Human Strength:''' Despite her slim figure, Belle seems to have considerable strength. She may have lifted the Beast, as evidenced by the Beast being placed onto Philippe's back, although this was never shown on-screen. Later on, she was able to pull the Beast up onto a balcony. In addition, she also was revealed to have rescued her father from the elements and presumably place him onto Philippe while he was still unconscious. Both the Beast and Maurice are each presumed to weigh considerably more than Belle, making her rescue of them quite a feat.
*'''Peak-Human Stamina:''' Belle also appears to have tireless reserves of stamina and considerable resilience to cold, likely due to her young age, able to survive fording icy water for a short period of time (in ''Enchanted Christmas'', she proved to be a capable swimmer when she rescued Chip), and she can walk back to the castle having given her cloak and Philippe over to the injured Beast after the wolves were driven off. In the ''Marvel Comics'' serial, she even managed to withstand the cold long enough to tell Chip about how she and her father went to the fair and won the first prize before passing out, just as Beast ultimately managed to trace her location via holly bushels hitting him when she let go of them.

==Appearances==
===''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''===
[[File:Beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-160.jpg|thumb|250px|Belle in ''Beauty and the Beast''.]]
Belle is a beautiful young woman living in a small unnamed village in [[France]]. She first appears at the beginning of the film (after the prologue) as she emerges out of the cottage she lives in and heads to a bookstore in the village, aware that the villagers are noting her peculiarity and how she doesn't fit in with the rest of them due to her love of books and withdrawn nature. At the bookstore, Belle returns a book she has borrowed and takes the one she perceives as her favorite. While heading back home to the cottage, she is pursued by a conceited, arrogant, muscle-headed hunter named [[Gaston]], who eventually stands in her way. Gaston takes the book from Belle, drops it into a mud puddle, and tells Belle to get herself out of reading and pay more attention to "more important things" like him. Just then, an explosion comes out from the basement of her cottage, prompting Belle to run back home.

Descending into the basement and coughing her way in, Belle finds her father, [[Maurice]], who is about to give up on [[Maurice's Machine|his latest contraption]] that he has built. Belle faithfully tells her father how she has believed he will get the machine working, win first prize at the fair, and become a world-famous inventor. Inspired by his daughter's beliefs, Maurice re-works on the machine, and once he thinks he has done fixing it, he gives it a test run. To both Belle and her father's surprise, the test run goes successfully. Belle waves goodbye to her father and wishes him luck as Maurice, riding on their horse [[Philippe]], goes off to the fair with the invention.

The following day, Belle is happily reading when she hears a knock on a door. She uses the periscope, only to find that Gaston is on the porch, much to her dismay, but nevertheless lets him in. Gaston then dirties Belle's book for the second time and reveals that he wants to make her his little wife and the mother of six or seven handsome little boys; Belle is disgusted by this idea and slips away from Gaston who continues to approach her. As Gaston has Belle cornered at the door and is about to plant a kiss on her, Belle opens the door as she swings around, causing Gaston to fall forward into a large mud pond outside. Belle then throws Gaston's boots out in front of her door before closing it and waits for him to leave. After the furious and humiliated Gaston storms off, Belle goes outside to feed the chickens, shocked in disbelief at how Gaston has asked her to marry him. Not wanting to be the wife of that boorish, brainless man, she runs off into an open field, where Philippe finds her, still hitched to the trailer carrying Maurice's invention, but without Maurice. Seeing Philippe without her father, Belle pleads for Philippe to take her to where her father is after unhitching Philippe from the trailer.

[[File:beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-2515.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"Take me, instead."]]
Belle rides Philippe through a [[The Black Forest|dark forest]] to a mysterious castle in the possibility of finding her father. She finds her father locked away in a dungeon and begs the master of the castle to free him due to his poor health, offering her own freedom in exchange for her father's, over the latter's protests. When the master agrees on the condition that she has to stay with him forever, she asks the master to step into the light, revealing himself to be a hideous [[Beast]]. Although Belle is terrified by the Beast's visage, and Maurice pleads for her to reconsider, not wanting to lose her in becoming the master's prisoner in his place, she promises to remain as the castle's prisoner and the master fulfills ''his'' end of the bargain by immediately releasing and sending Maurice back to the village in an enchanted palanquin. The master is deeply moved by her beauty and affection towards her father, and can't help but feel touched by her boldness and bravery, as well as feeling some remorse for not allowing Belle to say her goodbyes to her father whom she may not see again. The master then shows Belle to her room where she is initially terrified by the décor and gargoyles. He allows her to go about the castle but warns her not to go into his lair, the West Wing, which he cryptically labels as forbidden. When the Beast brings Belle to her room, he orders her to join him for dinner before slamming the door shut and storming off. Belle throws herself onto her bed and breaks down in tears over being separated from her father forever and trapped in the scary castle by the master.

Later, Belle is visited by [[Mrs. Potts]] and [[Chip Potts|Chip]]; she is shocked and surprised that a teapot and a teacup are alive (the [[Enchantress]] who turned the prince into a beast also transformed his servants into household objects) that she backs into a [[Wardrobe]], who is also alive. She accepts tea from Mrs. Potts, and after the teapot and the teacup leave, the Wardrobe decides upon a dress for Belle to wear for her upcoming dinner with the Beast, but Belle declines just as [[Cogsworth]] - the head servant who was turned into a mantle clock - arrives to inform her that dinner is ready.

The Beast is enraged upon learning from Cogsworth that Belle isn't joining him for dinner, storms over to Belle's room and bangs on the door, ordering her to come out to dinner. The two then have a heated shouting match which results in the Beast finally granting her wish to be left alone ''again''. Back in his lair, the master is shocked to find that Belle still grudges him for his mistreatment of her and her father, causing him to doubt if he will ever break the spell. Meanwhile, a little later, Belle, feeling hungry, emerges out of her room and makes her way to the castle's kitchen, where she meets Cogsworth, his assistant [[Lumiere]], and Mrs. Potts, who all agree to feed Belle (despite their master's protests) and entertain her with a [[Be Our Guest|marvelous musical number]].

[[File:beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-5197.jpg|thumb|250px|Belle discovering the enchanted rose in the West Wing.]]
After the dinner show, Belle applauds the entertainers and servers for putting on a spectacular performance. Having figured out that the castle is enchanted and wanting to see more of the castle, Belle asks Cogsworth to show her around. Belle comes across a staircase leading to the West Wing during the tour, but Cogsworth and Lumiere stop her and coerce her from going into the room she is forbidden to step into by showing their library; however, her curiosity of the West Wing gets the better of her. Taking advantage of a brief distraction from the two servants, Belle enters the room and discovers it's beaten down, ransacked and sickly. There she sees a torn picture of a young man and a glowing rose. She takes the glass off the rose and tries to touch it. Just then, however, the Beast arrives and is furious at Belle for disobeying him. Belle tries apologizing, but the master screams at her to get out while destroying some of his own furniture in the process. The master calms down, realizing his mistake too late and hangs his head in guilt and shame. Terrified as well as having had enough of the master's ferocious temper and the castle itself, Belle escapes the castle (rushing past Cogsworth and Lumiere) and runs away.

In the woods, she and Philippe encounter [[Wolves|a pack of frightening and savage wolves]], who chase after her and the horse. The wolves quickly catch up and knock Belle off Philippe, while Philippe gets his reigns wrapped around a tree branch, trapping him. Belle takes a tree branch to use as a weapon to defend herself and protect Philippe, but the wolves bite it in half when she attempts to hit them, rendering her helpless and defenseless in no time. Just as she is about to meet her apparent demise, the Beast intervenes and attacks the wolves, rescuing Belle and forcing the animals into retreat after flinging one of them, possibly the alpha, into a tree hard enough to knock it out, if not kill it by breaking its spine on the trunk, terrifying the other wolves into fleeing in fear. However, one of the wolves managed to injure him in the process before they flee in terror of his wrath. Coming to realize that the Beast has saved her life, Belle chooses to help the master - who has collapsed from exhaustion and the wounds left by the wolves - back to the castle over running away and leaving him in the woods to suffer. While she tends to the wounds that the master got from the wolves, the two then get into another heated argument about who was at fault (including Belle ignoring the Beast's orders of not going to the West Wing), with Belle winning the argument by ordering him to control his temper, overcoming her fears and conquering his ferocious temper. She then thanks the Beast for saving her life, to which the master, realizing the good deed he has done while noticing her kindness, starts feeling good inside himself.

[[File:Beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-7457.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Belle expressing her comfort and love for the Beast during their ballroom waltz.]]
As a token of his appreciation, the Beast, at Lumiere's suggestion, shows Belle the castle's enormous [[Library (Beauty and the Beast)|library]], which strikes her interest so much that he gives it to her as a gift. In return, Belle helps him act more like a gentleman, and the two eventually form a healthy friendship, bonding over suppers, reading, and playful outings in the snow. Over time, the Beast falls deeply in love with her, but fears that she will never love him in return. On a special night, however, an evening date is conceived, and the two eventually fall in love, though neither express their feelings verbally. After a waltz in the grand ballroom, Belle expresses the longing for her father and wishes for a way to see him once more. The master tells her that there is a way and shows Belle the magic mirror he had used previously, which is capable of showing anything the user wishes to see. Belle asks the mirror to show her father, and it reveals Maurice to be lost and sick in the woods trying to find his way back to the castle, apparently dying, a sight that shocks and worries her. With no choice, the Beast grants Belle freedom for the safety of her father. As a way to remember him, he hands her the mirror, which she accepts before thanking him for his kind gesture and departing in haste, changing back into her civilian clothes from her ballgown and riding away on Philippe as the master lets out a mournful howl as he watches her depart.

After returning to the village with her rescued father and nursing him back to good health, [[Monsieur D'Arque]], the head of a mental asylum, arrives to apprehend Maurice because of his claims about the Beast. It's soon revealed that Gaston was behind the asylum's arrival, in hopes of forcing Belle to marry him in exchange for her father's freedom. Belle refuses, and Gaston goes ahead with taking Maurice to the asylum. Thinking fast, Belle fetches the mirror and begs for it to show her the Beast, then turns the mirror to the villagers to reveal his existence, proving Maurice's sanity. Unfortunately, as she assures the intimidated crowd that the Beast isn't dangerous, Gaston senses Belle's romantic feelings for the master and mocks her for being in love with a monster, to which Belle angrily retorts by labeling Gaston as the real monster, making him snap in a furious rage. Out of spite and jealousy, Gaston snatches the mirror from Belle, declaring that she is just as crazy as her father, convinces the villagers that the Beast is a threat, and rallies a mob to attack the master. Shocked, Belle tries to stop Gaston from going through with his plans, but he perceives that she is against him and has her and Maurice locked in their cellar to prevent them from warning the Beast. Just then, after the mob's departure, Chip (who stowed away in Belle's satchel) uses Maurice's wood-cutting invention to free them, allowing them to rush to the castle on Philippe.

Belle arrives at the castle while Gaston takes on the Beast and attempts to stop the former from hurting the latter. The Beast, seeing Belle return, summons up the strength to fight back while Belle rushes into the castle and up the stairs. Arriving at the balcony, she calls to the Beast and reaches out for him to take her hand. Just as the Beast takes hold of Belle's hand, and they embrace each other, a jealous Gaston stabs the Beast in the back, causing the master to jerk backward in pain, which then causes Gaston to lose his balance and fall to his death in the process. Belle manages to grab hold of the Beast and pull him up onto the balcony. The master smiles at seeing Belle, who ensures all will be well with their reunion at hand. Unfortunately, the weak Beast with his dying breath can only express gratitude overseeing Belle one last time before he passes away in her arms, succumbing to the mortal wounds. Belle begs him not to leave her and, sobbing over the master's corpse, admits her love for him mere seconds before the last petal falls from the enchanted rose just in time.

[[File:Beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-9705.jpg|thumb|250px|Belle succeeds in breaking the spell, thus returning the master to his true, human self.]]
As Belle continues sobbing over the loss of her love, shimmering beams of light fall onto the Beast. The Beast's body then begins to float in the air and is enshrouded in a fog. Belle watches mysteriously as the Beast's fore-paws, hind-paws, and furry head respectively transform back into hands, feet, and head of a Prince for the master turns into his human self. The Prince then turns to Belle, who initially looks at him skeptically but then recognizes him from the torn portrait's blue eyes. The master and Belle share their first kiss, a kiss of true love, which subsequently breaks the additional spell placed on the castle and its inhabitants: the dark, scary castle is restored into its original, shining state, all the master's servants are transformed back into their human selves, and the Black Forest surrounding the castle is transformed back into the beautiful forest it was before. The film ends with Belle and the master dancing in the ballroom with her father and his servants watching happily. A stained glass window of her and the master is also depicted on the castle.

===''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]''===
[[File:Normal 03enchantedchristmas 062.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Belle in ''Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas''.]]
A midquel taking place during the winter segment of ''Beauty and the Beast''; this is the story of Belle's attempt to bring back to the castle the one ceremony the Beast hates most: Christmas. At the point the movie is supposed to take place, Belle still considered herself a prisoner in the castle, and wasn't truly friends with the Beast at that point, though she had begun to accept him. This takes place not too long after she was saved from the wolves and after the Beast gave her the library as a gift. She had started to warm up to the Beast a little and was more willing to reach out.

Belle is first seen walking through the castle in a pleasant enough mood when she runs into Chip, Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts. Belle asks Chip about today, and he doesn't know. She informs him and the others that it's the day before Christmas, to which Lumiere quickly cuts off before encouraging her to go out on the castle grounds.

At Chip's suggestion, Belle decides to go ice skating. After grabbing a pair of ice skates and a coat from the rack, she heads outside, where she finds the Beast just walking around. She bids him a good morning which causes him to lose balance on the ice and fall. Belle goes to check on him, and the two get into an awkward conversation about him slipping.

After putting on her skates, Belle begins skating, inviting the Beast to join her. Beast is reluctant at first, but Belle shows him the basic steps of skating, and eventually, he starts trying.

Belle watches as the Beast gets better at skating, much to her amusement. With his improvement, the two started skating together. Things seem to go well until interference from Fife causes them to slide into the snow after he grabs the Beast's cape. Belle and Beast emerge from the snow, and Belle cheerfully makes a Christmas angel. She shows it to the Beast, but he sees his own monstrous shape in the snow, gets enraged by it, and storms off in a fury. As he goes, Belle doubts if she should keep trying to reach him as it seems he is now worse than he was before, though Mrs. Potts tells her not to lose heart.

Later, Belle walks with Chip through the halls and asks him about the Beast's grumpy disposition. She is surprised when Chip tells her that the Beast is always that way, even at Christmas. She's even more surprised when Chip asks her about Christmas, telling her about the great traditions that occur on the holiday. One tradition she mentions; presents; gets Chip excited, and she tells him that everyone receives a present on Christmas, including the Beast. Chip asks Belle what she plans to give the Beast, and she doesn't really know him well enough to know what he would want. At Chip's suggestion, Belle decides to give the Beast a handmade storybook. As she makes it, [[Stories|she hopes that her story will help the Beast overcome his sorrows and pains and, hopefully, they will understand each other better]]. After she completes the story, she picks up Chip, confident that the Beast will like his gift, and assures him that they will have Christmas in the castle.

Later, Belle is washing dishes with the enchanted objects in the kitchen, where Cogsworth immediately rejects the notion of having Christmas due to the Beast forbidding it. Belle responds, saying Christmas can't be forbidden by anyone. Cogsworth tells her that Christmas is a painful reminder of the Beast's past and that bringing it back would only torture him even more, but Belle believes that it would actually do him some good. Cogsworth continues to reject, but Belle, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, and Chip bring up the Christmas feast, with Belle mentioning cranberry sauce. Eventually, Cogsworth agrees, and Belle suggests decorating the castle. Lumiere tells her that he knows someone who can help.

With Lumiere and Chip in hand, Belle travels up one of the castle towers to the attic. There, she and the two are greeted by a series of enchanted Christmas decorations lead by a Christmas angel named Angelique. After some flirting, Lumiere introduces her to Belle as the castle decorator. He then tells about their plans for a Christmas celebration, but Angelique refuses, not wanting to get disappointed again. Belle pleads with her help then, for they need her help to decorate the castle before Christmas, but Angelique still refuses, saying that nothing will change, but [[As Long As There's Christmas|Belle believes it will]].

After several attempts to get the Beast to agree, the Beast finally approves of the idea and allows Belle to prepare for Christmas, though he still bears a grudge, for Christmas is the day the Enchantress cast the spell on him and the castle residents.

Belle goes out into the woods with advice from Forte to get a suitable tree for Christmas, but she falls into thin ice and almost drowns. Fortunately, she is rescued by Beast, who is enraged at her because Forte told him earlier that she was trying to escape from him again.

Belle is then thrown into the dungeon to rot by an angry Beast who accuses her for her betrayal. Cold and demotivated, Belle was almost about to break down into sadness, until the Beast's servants, including Angelique, visit her in the dungeon [[As Long As There's Christmas|to comfort her]], while they [[A Cut Above the Rest|sing a song to cheer her up]]. The Beast then finds the book that Belle had written for him earlier in the West Wing and decides to set Belle free, and they both continue to prepare for Christmas. But Forte doesn't give up there, even going as far as to attempt to bring the whole castle down with ''Beethoven's Symphony No. 5'' in order to prevent the spell from breaking, as it can't if everyone is dead. Fortunately, the Beast stops him in time by crashing his keyboard to pieces. Sadly, the Beast mourns the loss of his old friend, and Belle comforts him.

Later, Belle, Beast, and the castle servants proceed with the Christmas celebrations just as planned, much to the former's happiness.

The viewers are soon taken back to the actual Christmas taking place, and Belle is presented with a gift from her husband: a rose.

[[File:normal bellesmagicalworld 723.jpg|thumb|250px|Belle in ''Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World''.]]
In this movie, Belle is the only human character. She meets three new enchanted object friends, named [[Webster]], [[Crane]], and [[Le Plume]], and is about to solve problems in all four segments. The film serves as a sequel to ''The Enchanted Christmas'', taking place before Gaston's death. Because the segments of the movie were originally intended to be used for a TV series, Belle had a slightly darker complexion than usual. Only this time, she is shown to be very different from she was later in the chronological story. She is more naive, stricter, and still defiant of the Beast's rules, while being easily be brought down by the things that go wrong in the castle.

In the first segment, "The Perfect Word", a falling out between Belle and Beast leads to the banishment of the aforementioned servants, Webster, Crane, and LePlume, forcing Belle to rush out and rescue them.

In the next segment, "Fifi's Folly", it's Lumiere's anniversary with Fifi, yet he doesn't know the proper way to confess how he truly feels. Belle assists him by taking the role of Fifi and practicing what he's going to do for their date. Fifi sees the two and believes Lumiere is leaving her for Belle. Eventually, all is straightened out.

In "Mrs. Potts' Party", Belle strives to cheer up a depressed Mrs. Potts, whom she has notably come to look as a motherly figure, though the rivalry between Lumiere and Cogsworth causes trouble. This segment was also included in ''[[Belle's Tales of Friendship]]''.

In the fourth and final segment, "A Broken Wing", Belle finds a wounded bird and takes it in. She spends most of her time hiding it from Beast originally until he grows to like. After a while, another problem brews as the bird is healthy once more, but Beast wants to keep it for its singing. Belle convinces him to let it free. In the end, they become closer, and their intense romance buds anew.

In "[[The Stolen Cartoons]]", [[Donald Duck]] accidentally served [[Lumiere]] as Belle's evening meal, much to the latter's confusion.

In "[[Mickey and the Culture Clash]]", Belle attempted to read a book that Mickey was balancing on his head, but her hand was slapped away by Mortimer Mouse. She then asked what the commotion was about, and was informed by Clarabelle that Minnie was looking for someone more sophisticated than Mickey. It was the only time she spoke in the show.

In "[[Ask Von Drake]]", Belle was seen sitting with Beast during [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|Disney character head count]].

In "[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]", when Jiminy mentions the possibility some characters may not have children, the camera pans to Belle and Beast. Belle can also be seen in recycled crowd shots, cheering alongside Mrs. Potts and Chip.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
{{Quote|And best of luck finding your [[A Place Called Slaughter Race|song]].|Belle's goodbye to Vanellope}}
[[File:Ralph Breaks The Internet 66.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Belle with Rapunzel in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''.]]
In ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'', Belle appears alongside the other [[Disney Princess]]es as netizens in [[Oh My Disney]]. Working as a [[cast member]], Belle and the princesses meet-and-greet with net users. On one particular day, the backstage room of the princesses is infiltrated by a glitch named [[Vanellope von Schweetz]]; Belle is seen reading a book when Vanellope arrives. Belle jumps into action in defense, believing Vanellope to be a threat, and arms herself with her book. Belle lays down her defense when Vanellope claims to be a princess as well. When [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]] asks Vanellope what kind of princess she is, Belle and [[Rapunzel]] ask her if she has ever been kidnapped or enslaved. Though she has not, Belle (along with other princesses) relates when Vanellope reveals that she does not have a mother.

Shortly after, the princess becomes enamored with Vanellope's "gown", and switch into more comfortable modern attire to match. Belle dons a yellow tank top with a black silhouette of the Beast's head that reads "BFF" (meaning "Beast Friends Forever"), golden pants, and brown ballet flats. While lounging, Belle continues reading her book. Ariel, meanwhile, expresses her excitement over wearing a shirt (and briefly asks Belle what the clothing is called). She starts to break into song, but Vanellope's confusion cuts her off. As Vanellope has never had a song, Rapunzel advises her to sing about what she desires most. Vanellope's song about a steering wheel is less than stellar, but Belle tries to avoid any criticism and asks if the steering wheel that Vanellope mentioned is a metaphor. Vanellope explains that she's being literal. As the princesses prepare to get back to work, [[Merida]] tries to send some advice in an unintelligible Scottish accent; in during which means, Belle makes an awkward face.

During the climax, Belle and the princesses leave Oh My Disney after the [[Internet]] is taken over by a virus. After the virus has been neutralized, the princesses spot [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]] plummeting from the air. Belle, Ariel, [[Tiana]], and [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] use their gowns as parachutes to safely descend Ralph to the ground, where the princesses are able to formally meet and befriend him.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - Season 3 - Belle.jpg|thumb|250px|Emilie de Ravin as Belle in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
Belle is a primary character of the hit [[ABC]] fantasy television series ''Once Upon a Time'', where she is portrayed by Emilie de Ravin.
Belle is the only child and daughter of Sir Maurice, whose town will be destroyed in the Ogre Wars. [[Rumplestiltskin]] offers to protect them if Belle becomes his servant forever. Her father and her fiancée Gaston (Sage Brocklebank) refuse to agree to his terms, but Belle accepts the deal. Over time, the pair fall in love, and Rumplestiltskin asks her to go out and buy straw, expecting that she won't return. On the road, she meets [[the Evil Queen]] Regina and learns that true love's kiss will break any curse, including the one on Rumplestiltskin. Belle returns to the castle and kisses him, and he starts changing back into a human. However, he learns that she met the Queen and becomes convinced that she is a spy; this stops the transformation. In his rage, he rejects her love and locks Belle in his dungeon. He then breaks all of his dishware, except the cup that she accidentally chipped. He throws her out of his castle, stating that his power is more important to him than she is. She admonishes him for not believing that she loves him and promises that he will regret it when he is left with an empty heart and the chipped cup. She then leaves and he doesn't see her again. Belle is later seen giving advice on love to [[Grumpy]] then known as Dreamy.

Her storyline in the Enchanted Forest involved [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] in one episode. The two of them hear of a fiery monster causing trouble in the Enchanted Forest. Belle hunts it down and douses it with water. The monster then writes "save me" on the ground. Belle uses fairy dust to help the creature and it turns back into its true form, [[Prince Phillip]]. He thanks Belle for saving him and reveals to her that [[Maleficent]] cast a spell over him to keep him away from his true love [[Aurora]]. Belle then introduces Phillip to Mulan and leaves them to help her true love, Rumplestiltskin. However, soon after she is taken prisoner by [[The Evil Queen|Regina]]. In another episode, Hook goes to Belle's jail cell after hearing that she could be Rumplestiltskin's weakness. He asks her to help destroy him, but she refuses to do so. Hook then knocks her out and leaves.

According to the Queen, Belle was allegedly shunned by her town for her association with Rumplestiltskin and was imprisoned and tortured until she threw herself off a tower and died. However, this is later proven false by her existence in [[Storybrooke]], where Regina keeps her locked in a secret room underneath the Storybrooke Hospital.

She is eventually released by Jefferson. He tells her to find Mr. Gold, who is actually Rumplestiltskin, and to tell Gold that Regina held her captive. She finds Gold but doesn't remember who he is. When the curse on Storybrooke is broken, she regains her memories and professes her love for Rumplestiltskin. He then takes her to his shop, where she makes him promise he won't kill Regina. After Gold releases the Wraith to seek out vengeance on Regina, Belle storms out of the pawnshop, frustrated by his play on words. Later, she comes back to him, where he shows her the [[Chip Potts|chipped cup]] and she says she will stay with him as "he's a monster".

At the beginning of "[[The Crocodile]]", Belle has a dream that Mr. Gold turns into Rumplestiltskin/The Dark One and throws a pickaxe into Leroy's chest. When she wakes up, she sees Mr. Gold in the basement of his house doing magic. The next morning, Belle asks him what he has been doing. Mr. Gold just says "Magic is Power."

Later, her father, [[Maurice|Moe/Maurice]] sends [[Mr. Smee|Smee]] to "kidnap" her, so she could see her father but Moe finds out she still loves Mr. Gold. To fix this "little" problem, her father handcuffs her to a mining trolley and rolls it down a hill, so she can have her memories erased (because when a person crosses the town border, they lose all memory of their true selves). She is rescued by Mr. Gold, Prince Charming/David Nolan, and Red Riding Hood/Ruby. However, once she is rescued, she says she doesn't want to see Mr. Gold and Moe ever again.

Mr. Gold gives Belle the key to the Storybrooke Library and then explains everything from being a coward to Baelfire. He starts to go but Belle stops him, wanting to go with him for a hamburger at ''Grannies'', to which he happily agrees.

Sometime later, [[Jiminy Cricket|Archie]] is supposedly killed by Regina. Belle, along with the other townspeople, attends Archie's funeral where Mary Margaret gives a eulogy in remembrance of him. Afterward, Belle meets up with Mr. Gold in which he happily tells her the option for crossing the border works. She expresses wishes to go with him, but he regretfully says the option is only enough for one person. She heads to the library, later on, to sort through books and notices a stranger standing in the corner and recognizes him as the man who broke into her cell in the Evil Queen's palace, [[Captain Hook]]. In a state of panic, she runs from him but is unable to escape the building. Belle pushes a bookshelf, which topples and pins him to the floor as she scurries into the elevator. Pulling out her cell phone to call Mr. Gold, she is able to tell him about the man trying to kill her, but when she attempts to give more details, Mr. Gold is unable to hear her through the bad reception. Belle doesn't return to the library until Mr. Gold operates the switch to open the elevator shaft.

Reunited, they hurry back to the pawnshop together. On the way there, Belle demands to know Mr. Gold's history with Hook. Hesitantly, he finally tells her Hook stole his wife, Milah, from him years ago. When she asks what happened to his wife, Mr. Gold can only say that she died. When Mr. Gold's cloak is stolen by William Smee, Mr. Gold wants to get back. He gives her a loaded gun to keep in case she ever needs to use it to protect herself. While Mr. Gold is away, Belle goes back into the library. There she finds a knot left behind from Hook and searches through her books about it. Reading the books, she realizes the knot comes specifically from a ship.

Heading to the harbor, she looks up at the seagulls and is surprised to see one of the lands and stand on something invisible. Suspecting something is there but can't see it, Belle takes a pinch of dust and throws it over, revealing stairs leading up to an invisible ship. She goes up the steps until she passes a barrier that leads her onto the ship's visible deck. Belle opens a door below deck and discovers Archie tied up. She uses a sword to cut him free and urges him to get back to town. Then, she proceeds to rummage around the shelves hoping to find Baelfire's cloak. In her distraction, she had put down the gun, and just then, Hook makes himself known to her. She lunges for the gun, but Hook is faster. He threateningly points the gun at her forehead, and while they converse, he reveals to her a truth Mr. Gold didn't tell her―that he killed Milah by ripping out her heart. Belle still believes in Mr. Gold and asserts that she knows he has changed and has good in him even knowing this. She hits him with a rowing paddle and runs away to the above deck while taking the cloak with her.

Mr. Gold shows up to save Belle and proceeds to beat Hook bloody with his cane. Belle pleads that they should leave, but Mr. Gold can't contain his anger at Hook's presence. Finally, he stops when she reminds him of the hope she had in believing he changed and that if he has, to walk away right now. They leave Hook's ship.

That night, Mr. Gold and Belle are at the town border. He uses the potion on himself and steps to the other side of the borderline while his memory stays intact. Belle is very pleased the potion will allow him to find his son. She promises to wait for him in Storybrooke. The heartfelt moment is interrupted when Belle is suddenly shot and pierced in the shoulder, causing her to trip and fall over the border into Mr. Gold's arms and thus lose her memories. Hook is then revealed to be the shooter, stating that now Gold knows how it feels to lose someone he loves. Mr. Gold yells her name in anguish, but she stares at him in confusion, asking, "Who is Belle?"

She is in a frantic and frightened state after she becomes amnesic. Mr. Gold is worried about her injuries, so he magically heals them. Belle is confused and asks him how he did it. An ambulance arrives at the scene and takes Belle to the hospital. While laying in the hospital bed, Mr. Gold tries to trigger her memory with true love's kiss. It's unsuccessful, and Belle screams at Mr. Gold.

Later, Mr. Gold arrives at the hospital with the chipped cup, which he magically charmed. He gives it to Belle in hopes that she remember her past from the Enchanted Forest. The plan doesn't work. Belle is confused and unsure when he mentions magic and tries giving the cup back to Mr. Gold, but he insists she tries. Belle becomes angry and throws the cup, shattering it to pieces. She asks him to leave one final time, and Mr. Gold finally leaves her room in tears. For the time, Belle remains in the hospital until she gets a call from Mr. Gold, who tells her that he knows she doesn't remember who she is, but that she was a beautiful woman who loved an ugly man, and adds that she creates goodness in people. Belle begins to tear up at his words, but he hangs up before she can respond. She is then visited by Regina, who is displeased to hear Mr. Gold will help her. Thinking quickly, she bends down to pick up an item and instead conjures a little red card of the town bar, The Rabbit Hole, and asks if it belongs to. Though Belle says no, Regina suggests she should take a better look at it. Belle glances down at the card, exclaims she remembers who she is. In reality, Regina gave her false memories to replace the memories she lost as Belle. With the false memories, she assumes a new personality and a new name, '''Lacey'''.

In the final episode of Season 2, Grumpy gives Mr. Gold some magic from the [[Blue Fairy]] to help restore Belle's memories. Mr. Gold restores the chipped cup and pours the magic into it. Belle drinks from the cup and her memories come back. After [[Henry Mills]] is kidnapped Mr. Gold decides to go rescue him and tells Belle to look after Storybrooke while he is gone.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x07 - Child of the Moon - Belle Storybrooke.png|thumb|left|250px|Belle in her Library at Storybrooke.]]
In Season 3, Belle had been appearing to Mr. Gold as a vision to guide him through Neverland but it's eventually revealed that she is actually Peter Pan's shadow in disguise. Back in Storybrooke, the real Belle has a difficult time accepting that Rumplestiltskin is gone. Then, with the help of the Dwarfs and the Blue Fairy. She casts a protection spell over the town. Sometime later, Belle meets [[Ariel]]. Belle questions Ariel as to why she has come to Storybrooke to which Ariel replies she came from Neverland on a mission for Mr. Gold. Belle is then shocked and relieved Mr. Gold is alive and Ariel tells Belle Mr. Gold needs him to save everyone.

The two head goes to Mr. Gold's shop where Belle is able to use the Sand Dollar given to her by Ariel from Mr. Gold to find the item capable of defeating Pan. However, after finding the item which has turned out to be [[Pandora's Box]] they are ambushed by [[John Darling|John]] and [[Michael Darling]] now working for Pan and the two of them tie Ariel and Belle up and take the item to destroy it. In order to get out of the ropes, Belle removes Ariel's bracelet which allows Ariel to wiggle free from the ropes and undo Belle's bindings. Ariel then puts the bracelet back on and go after John and Michael.

Belle and Ariel find Michael and John just before they destroy the box. Belle is able to stop them by activating a mine cart on the tracks, which throws Michael and John off their feet. Using the time to her advantage, she grabs the box and kicks their gun away. John and Michael tell Ariel and Belle that Pan has [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]] hostage and if they don't do his bidding he will kill her. Ariel and Belle promise they will help save their sister. Ariel and Belle then go to the coast where she parts ways with Belle and returns to Neverland with Pandora's Box.

When Ariel returns to Storybrooke, Belle helps her reunite with [[Prince Eric]]. Mr. Gold and Belle also reunite, but it's only for a few days. Pan casts a curse to destroy Storybrooke and its residents, but Gold stops him and disappears. Regina then casts a spell to send everyone from the Enchanted Forest, including Belle, back to the world they came from.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 3x22 - There's No Place Like Home - Belle Wedding.png|thumb|250px|Belle at her wedding to Gold.]]
In the Enchanted Forest, Belle and [[Neal Cassidy|Neal]] return to the castle try to find a way to bring Rumplestiltskin back to life. They meet Lumiere in the library, and he tells them they must use a key to open the Vault of the Dark One. When they reach the vault, Lumiere reveals that he has been working under [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena the Wicked Witch of the West]]. Baelfire still decides to open the vault despite Belle's warning and his life is exchanged for Rumplestiltskin's. A new curse is later cast and everyone in the Enchanted Forest, including Belle, returns to Storybrooke. After a long battle, Zelena is defeated and taken to jail.

In the mid-season finale of Season 4, "Heroes and Villains", Belle learns that Gold chose power over love and so uses his dagger and a gauntlet to make him unfreeze Emma and Mary Margaret and give Hook his heart back. The two then go to the town line where Gold tries to apologize, but Belle doesn't believe him and that he won't ever change and then uses the dagger to banish Gold from Storybrooke. Gold cries out for Belle as she cries over what she has done.

When Gold returns to Storybrooke he stops by the pawnshop and sees that Belle has gotten together with [[Will Scarlet]]. Later, to get the dagger back from Belle he takes Hook's appearance and tricks her into giving it to him. Soon Gold, as Hook, goes into the pawnshop and asks her if she is over Gold. She says no but says that Will makes her happy.

As Gold's condition worsens, being consumed by the Dark One's powers, Belle confesses to him that she doesn't love Will. The Apprentice removes the darkness from Gold's heart, though he remains in a comatose state while the darkness is taken in by Emma Swan.

With the other residents, Belle transports to the Enchanted Forest, taking Emma to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove her darkness.

After her memory is restored, Belle remained in Storybrooke but is unaware that Gold, who traveled with Emma to the Underworld to rescue Hook, has reclaimed the powers of the Dark One, and is unaware that she is pregnant with their first child, which is tied to a contract that Hades is using due to Rumplestiltskin having made a deal with a healer back in the Enchanted Forest in exchange for saving Baelfire. Unfortunately, after she is sent through a portal along with Zelena and her daughter, Belle learns the truth from Gold about his reacquired powers and her pregnancy as well as the contract, putting her life and that of their unborn child in jeopardy once again. Motivated by Hades, Gaston moves against Rumplestiltskin with plans to kill him, reuniting Belle with her ex-fiancé. After confronting Gold about his murder of Gaston decades earlier, Belle intends to help Gaston move on, only to learn that Gaston blames her for his death. In an attempt to rescue Rumplestiltskin, Belle inadvertently pushes Gaston into the River of Lost Souls. Consumed with guilt over what she did to Gaston, Belle places herself under a sleeping curse, believing it would give Gold time to protect their child from Hades. Before falling under, Belle makes a Gold promise to return her to her father. It later turns out that Gold's kiss of True Love can't break the spell; Belle had begun losing faith in him again. Later in a dream, Belle's future son, [[Gideon (Once Upon a Time)|Gideon]], helps Belle wake up from the curse. However, the [[Black Fairy]] speeds up Belle's pregnancy and kidnaps Gideon. Eventually, the Black Fairy is defeated, Belle forgives Rumplestiltskin for all of his wrong-doings and Gideon is able to restart his life. Belle, Rumplestiltskin, and Gideon then spend many happy years together in another realm and when Belle becomes very old, she dies peacefully. Rumplestiltskin then begins searching for the Guardian so he can be free from the Darkness and reunite with Belle in the afterlife.

In his search for the Guardian, Rumplestiltskin goes to the [[Magical Forest]] and meets [[Alice]], a Guardian. He brings her to Belle's coffin, where she begins destroying the Dark One's dagger with her magic, but Rumplestiltskin, not wanting her to absorb the Darkness, tackles her, restoring the Dagger and ruining his chance to reunite with Belle. A new Dark Curse is later cast and Rumplestiltskin is sent to [[Hyperion Heights (location)|Hyperion Heights]]. After his memories return and both [[Mother Gothel]] and [[Dr. Facilier]] are defeated, Rumplestiltskin travels to the Wish Realm where he takes out his own heart in order to save the dying [[Captain Hook|Wish Realm Hook]] by giving it to him, which destroys the evil Rumplestiltskin from that realm. Rumplestiltskin then dies and is happily reunited with Belle in the afterlife.

[[File:desc 03060.jpg|thumb|250px|Belle in ''Descendants''.]]
Belle appears in the [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] ''Descendants''. She is played by [[Keegan Connor Tracy]].

She and the Human Beast serve as the parents of the major character, [[Ben (Descendants)|Ben]]. Sometime after breaking the curse on her Prince, she and the Beast became the King and Queen of the idyllic kingdom of [[Auradon|The United States of Auradon]], one large kingdom uniting all the famous kingdoms, set in the present day, and inhabited by various iconic Disney characters and their children. When Ben, who is soon to be King, states he wants to grant the children of the Isle of the Lost a second chance as his first proclamation, she is understandably worried, but she remains supportive of her son's endeavors and pushes her husband to do so as well.

[[File:Emma Watson as Belle 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Emma Watson as Belle in the 2017 live-action remake.]]
Belle appears in the [[2017]] live-action adaptation, played by [[Emma Watson]]. In this version, Belle isn't only a bookworm, but also an inventor - she uses her inventions for everyday chores such as laundry, which in turn provides her with time to catch up on her reading. Her backstory with Maurice is also expanded upon, as this version of the story confirms that the death of [[Belle's mother]] was the result of the black plague, forcing Maurice to take Belle (who was still an infant at the time) and flee [[Paris]] for safer havens towards the town of Villeneuve in the French countryside. As a result of his wife's passing, Maurice is somewhat overprotective of Belle and has reservations over her dreams of experiencing adventure within the outside world. As such, he created music boxes that represent different countries to allow her to "see the world" without actually having to leave their provincial town of Villeneuve.<ref name="omd">{{Cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/news/2016/11/03/belle-gets-a-new-backstory-for-live-action-beauty-and-the-beast/|title=BELLE GETS A NEW BACKSTORY FOR LIVE-ACTION BEAUTY AND THE BEAST!|website=Oh My Disney|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> The fate of her mother (with her father's vague response on the former), left Belle puzzled and led her to seek out for answers; something that she would not discover for many years later, upon her time with the Beast, which he later showed her through a book given by the Enchantress as a means of traveling anywhere it desires, which she used it to transport them toward her childhood home in Paris and found out her mother's tragic fate, causing the Beast to realize his misjudgment of Maurice and made an apology to Belle for his earlier mistreatment to her father. The discovery of her mother's tragedy would be crucial for having Maurice and Belle making amends with each other, with Belle's widen understanding of why Maurice was so overly protective of her.

Belle is introduced in the opening of the film, singing the musical number named after her. While exploring the surrounding landscape, the people all seem to show interest in her. Encountering Gaston, he requests her to go on a date with him, to which Belle decides not to. Belle walks into her father Maurice in his workshop just as Maurice explains to Belle that the village is small, which is safer than larger villages and after a conversation between Belle and her father, Belle asks him for a rose like the one in his painting just as Maurice storms off to the marketplace to find a rose for her. As Maurice leaves, Belle returns to the village around her, teaching a nearby girl how to read, to which she then approaches Gaston again who tells her to give advice to the villagers, explaining to her that she would never marry him even though the village around Belle's world is small. After the conversation, Belle sings a reprise of the song named after her, longing for a great adventure in the world around her.

When Philippe arrives towards Belle, the horse is worried that he recently discovered something mysterious her father Maurice encountered, causing Belle to ride on him to get to the Beast's Castle. Arriving there, Belle encounters Lumiere and Cogsworth, who are commenting about Belle's plan to break the curse. Belle uses Lumiere as a torch to protect herself in order to find her father. Encountering Maurice, he warns her to escape before the Beast finds her. Belle then asks the Beast to find her father, to which the Beast denies her father's actions. Approaching the Beast, Belle spends a minute alone with the Beast, requesting him to see her father just as Belle notices the Beast taking her father away. Afterward, Lumiere escorts Belle to her room, who later introduces himself to Belle, just as Cogsworth approaches his conversation with Belle.

While exploring outside, Lumiere tells Belle that she can explore any part of the castle except for the west wing just as Belle is taken to her new room in the castle, to which it is known that the castle is now her new home just as Belle encounters Plumette, Madame De Garderobe, and Froufrou inside her new room as she encounters them in awe.

The Beast then requests Belle for a dinner invitation in the dining area, but she rejects his offer for locking her in the tower. She later gets an invitation from Mrs. Potts to go to the dining area, explaining that she would feel better after dinner just as Belle is told to go to dinner to which Belle is taken to the dining area where Lumiere and the other objects perform the musical number "Be Our Guest" in front of Belle, satisfying her.

After the musical number "Be Our Guest", Mrs. Potts talks to Belle, telling her that the Beast is willing to be set free by finding someone to fall in love with. After talking to Mrs. Potts, she tells her son to go to bed. Belle then looks at the damaged picture of the royal family's castle and arrives at the spot where the Enchanted Rose is at, only for the Beast to confront her as he angrily roars at her to get out of the castle. Belle then plans to leave, but Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Froufrou try to stop Belle from leaving, but Belle leaves. Escaping, Belle rides on Philippe while a pack of wolves prepares to attack. The Beast then arrives and fights against the pack of wolves, shooing away the wolves. Belle comforts over the injured Beast as he is taken to the castle, where he is told to help her only if he controls his temper. While taking care of the Beast, Mrs. Potts tells Belle the Beast about his tragic loss of his mother and having to be raised by his abusive father just as the Beast calms himself while resting. Later after singing the musical number "[[Days in the Sun]]", Lumiere explains to Belle that if the last petal falls, the Prince will remain a Beast forever and the castle residents become inanimate objects.

With the Beast healed, he takes Belle to the library as she looks at the library around her in excitement. Later, Belle and the Beast walk outside together just as the couple looks at the frozen lake around them. Belle then teaches the Beast how to be gentle to Philippe and later sings the musical number "Something There" just as she and the Beast start a relationship with them. Later, Belle thanks the Beast for saving her from the wolves just as Belle talks to him about the villagers thinking Belle is funny. Back at the library, the Beast shows Belle a book from the Enchantress related to the curse she cast on her. Belle later takes the Beast into Paris, where she sings to him that her childhood in Paris is gone just as she remembers her tragic flashback about her mother who died from the plague just as the Beast apologizes to her for calling her a thief.

Belle wears a ball gown at the Beast's castle while the Beast wears a formal suit just as she and the Beast dance together during the musical number "Beauty and the Beast" as Mrs. Potts sings in front of the dancing couple.

Belle tells the Beast that her father taught her how to dance as the couple arrives at the balcony. Showing empathy to Belle, the Beast gives her the Enchanted Mirror to Belle help her find her father. Upon seeing Maurice being attacked by an angry mob, Belle is tasked to find her father and rescue her.

As Belle leaves the castle to find her father, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Plumette are worried about Belle planning to find her father just as they all leave sadly, as the Beast sings the musical number "[[Evermore]]". Belle walks across Gaston in front of Maurice who is being threatened just as Belle shows proof about the Beast to the townspeople. During this moment, Belle finds out that Gaston betrayed her about the Beast being a hideous monster as Gaston is aggressively planning to kill the Beast as Belle is locked into the carriage. Afterwards, Gaston sends an angry mob to kill the Beast. Belle and Maurice plan to escape the carriage in an attempt to warn the Beast that Gaston has sent in the mob to kill him. Belle then rides on Philippe to return to the castle.

Arriving back at the Castle, Belle notices Gaston hurting the Beast just as Gaston tries to finish his plan to kill the Beast. After the Beast reunites with Belle, she comforts him after being injured. Gaston, however, falls to his death while Belle tries to protect the Beast. Belle ends up crying over the Beast's motionless body as the last petal falls.

As the last petal falls, Agathe arrives at the spot where Belle cries over the Beast's dead body as Agathe uses her magic to restore the Enchanted Rose as the Beast is transformed back into his normal form, the Prince whom Belle manages to recognize as her beloved by looking into his eyes before sharing a kiss with him. With the spell broken and the castle fixed, the Prince and Belle dance in the ballroom with the other castle residents.

===''[[The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast]]''===
[[File:TNAOBATB Young Belle.jpg|thumb|250px|A younger Belle, as seen in ''The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast''.]]
This comic serial took place a few years before the events of the first film, with both stories being reprinted in ''[[Disney Princess Comics Treasury]]''.

In the first issue, in a flashback during the first storyline, "Bewitched", Belle briefly witnessed the Prince being unkind to an old lady, resulting in her asking her father whether men are all monsters. In the second storyline, "Bothered", she learns from Maurice that their pet pig, Pierre, was an essential component to a truffle harvester before he tells her to put her King Arthur book away, so she can play outside with the other village children. Belle attempts to refuse, citing that she has more enjoyment imagining King Arthur's court. Ultimately, she did go out, resulting in her being reluctantly forced into becoming the "galley prisoner" by several boys playing pirates. She attempted to get out, only to find a bear (implied to actually be the Enchantress in disguise) snarling and about to attack her. She eventually was unintentionally rescued by Maurice with a test run with the Truffle Harvester. Belle later makes an appearance in the ending of the third storyline, "Bewildered", as a reflection on the enchanted mirror.

In the second issue's first storyline, "Elsewhere", she and Maurice were on their way back from the fair (not being allowed to participate after one of Maurice's inventions ripped the dress of one of the judge's wives). She eventually got curious about a path and went down it despite her father's insistence that she not go down that path. She managed to find an owl, which Maurice attempted to capture for one of his new ideas, although it disappeared despite capturing it. They then fled after finding a wolf nearby (both the wolf and the owl were implied to be the Enchantress in disguise). Belle noted she had a funny feeling she'll eventually go down that path in an act of foreshadowing.

===[[Beauty and the Beast (Marvel Comics)|''Beauty and the Beast'' (Marvel Comics)]]===
This comic serial took place during Belle's stay at Beast's castle, similar to the midquels above.

In the [[A Chance For Romance|First Issue]], while looking for the book ''Lost at Sea'', she heard the Beast roaring (which nearly got an animated Ladder to drop her due to fright, also implying that this wasn't the first time Beast made a huge roar). Belle then spent her time reading the book until Chip and Mrs. Potts (after the former had to loudly interrupt her reading) informed her of Beast's rising temper and foul mood, which is nearly spoiling the planned surprise party for the Wardrobe. Belle then decided to tell Beast just what she thinks of him. After telling the Beast off, the latter admitted that he was in a foul mood because he had woken up from a dream about becoming handsome and discovering he was still ugly. Belle then assured him that it was the inside that counts, not the outside. Belle then offered to have Beast come down to aid with Wardrobe's surprise party, with Beast, after initially refusing, deciding to do so for Belle.

The [[Wardrobe's Big Surprise|second issue]] picks up right where the first issue left off. Belle tells him to be gracious, at least during the Wardrobe's surprise party when the Beast snaps for his dinner. During the actual dinner, however, Belle reacted with disgust when Beast ended up chowing down the meal like an animal. Sometime later, Belle thanked Lumiere for the soup and planned to have the rest of dinner by the fire, although after Beast snapped at her to stay at the table, she then sternly told Beast that she'll stay only if he eats with a utensil and not slurp the meal (which Beast did reluctantly). Belle then was horrified that Beast (who had second thoughts to attending the party anyway) demanded the party be canceled when he learned the Wardrobe wasn't coming down, and instead suggested that she go upstairs and try to convince Wardrobe to come down as the servants worked very hard for it. Belle then learned the Wardrobe wouldn't come down because she was depressed as, being a wardrobe, she viewed herself as useless as she had plenty of dresses and no one to wear them. She then offered to try on one of the dresses, and then deliberately left behind the tiara to lure the wardrobe downstairs for the surprise party. She then watched the opera.

The [[The Wishful Walk|third issue]] occurs the morning after the party, Belle proceeded to go for a walk on the grounds, alone, despite the servant's suggestions that someone accompanies her. While walking on the grounds, Belle accidentally bumped into the Beast (who had secretly gone outside in an attempt to walk with her at the servants' suggestion), which ended up spoiling the event with them getting into a severe argument. Eventually, they made up and decided to play with the leaves and snow. Aside from this, one of [[the Bimbettes]], Laurette, disguised herself as Belle in a wife auction organized by Gaston, fully anticipating that Gaston would want Belle. She then pretended that she fully submitted to what Gaston wanted in a wife, but then her disguise was spoiled by her sisters (not realizing that "Belle" was actually Laurette). Although Gaston was initially upset at this outcome, he eventually forgave it and figured Belle may have simply not been aware of what happened.

[[File:Belle Marvel Cover.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Belle and Beast on the cover of one of Marvel's ''Beauty and the Beast'' comic stories.]]
The [[Almost Amour!|fourth issue]] picks up right where the third issue's Belle story left off. Lumiere planned to have Belle and Beast attend the Glorious Harvest Gala Festival, even writing invitations for them. However, although Belle got her invitation, Beast's invitation ended up blown into the fire and burned. She later learned of this when Chip opened the window enough for Lumiere and Cogsworth's loud blame game to pierce her reading in an attempt to warn her of what happened (with Belle assuming that Beast threw the letter into the fire). She then told off the Beast for burning the letter and implied that she misjudged Beast, although she eventually learned that the reason why Beast did so was that he couldn't read the letter even if he wanted to, having long forgotten how to do so. Belle then offered to teach him to do so, and then attended with him the Gala Festival, having supper and then offering to have her look at the stars.

The [[Lyrical Love#Part 1|fifth issue]] has Belle teaching Beast how to read. However, the difficulty ended up frustrating Beast to a huge extent, causing them to have a huge argument and resulting in Belle storming off. Belle then mentioned the complexity of the Beast's dual nature and commented that she wished that she was back at the village (then flashing back to [[Belle (song)|the beginning of the film]]).

The [[Lyrical Love#Part 2|sixth issue]] picks off where the fifth issue left off: Belle, after reading a book, comments it's great to have a library, so she could go off on adventures, even if it's her imagination and pities the Beast for keeping himself locked up in the castle and his mind, being too stubborn to let her teach him how to read. She then got a message from Lumiere from the Beast, although she eventually deduced that Lumiere actually composed the Beast's message for the Beast and not the Beast himself. She then thanked Beast for his thoughtfulness but would appreciate it more if Beast himself actually wrote the poem. Beast was reluctant since he wasn't a poet. Eventually, after Beast unconsciously began to do poetry, she then let Beast attempt to read when he requested it.

The [[Dove Tales#Part 1|seventh issue]] starts with a daydream by Belle about a time at the village where she helped Maurice fix up an egg-sorting contraption just as the latter was about to give up due to it failing and resulting in eggs splattering, citing her confidence in him. After successfully fixing it up, Maurice then notes that a dove was nearby, meaning that their lives will get better. She then is in her room, mentioning she misses him. Afterward, she agrees to play with Chip in the snow (as everyone else was too busy to do so with Chip). She then taught him how to build a snowman, and eventually decided with Chip to get holly bushes to help prepare for Christmas. Unfortunately, the blizzard unexpectedly gets worse, with Belle and Chip eventually getting lost in the forest and thus unable to return to the castle due to the severity of the storm.

The [[Dove Tales#Part 2|eighth issue]] picks up where the seventh issue left off. Belle, lost in the storm, offered to tell Chip a story about her past as a way to keep themselves awake and thus avoid freezing to death, although she eventually passes out. Luckily, the bushels managed to hit Beast as he was searching for her, resulting in him tracking down her location and saving her and Chip in time. She then learned Beast tended to her side and never moved, with her thanking him. Beast then thanked her for saving his life as she taught him that his life wasn't "meaningless" after all. In her flashback, Belle and Maurice, with their egg-sorting contraption, went out of the village to the fair. However, they eventually got themselves lost (due to the Bimbettes switching the sign to go the other way to deliberately get Belle off the course). They just barely managed to get to the fair (after Maurice deduced they were actually supposed to go South, not North), and also won as a last-minute entry. She then returned to the village with Maurice, with Gaston greeting them (to the Bimbettes' chagrin).

In the ninth issue, because of guilt for rarely saving her and Chip, Beast had her stay in bed and make breakfast in bed for her. However, this eventually proved unnecessary due to Belle having fully recovered and coming downstairs to thank Beast. Belle then offered to do something in return for Beast, with the servants planning to make a portrait of her. She changed her various outfits and eventually settled on a pink outfit, thanks to Beast's compliment earlier. However, during the painting process, she had a sad look that Beast and Chip noticed when the painting was unveiled (it's strongly implied her melancholy was due to homesickness, more specifically, her missing her father).

In the tenth issue, occurring the next day, Belle ended up playing in the snow with Chip (as she had promised to play with him in the snow again after a day passed), although while gazing at the sky, she saw a dove and began to feel sad for her father again. She then had a snowball fight with Chip, accidentally striking Beast (who was on his way to converse with Belle to figure out how he can make her feel better after getting the hint from the portrait earlier that she was melancholic) on the muzzle with a snowball. She apologized to Beast, and after a comment from Chip about getting Hollies, inadvertently supplied Beast with the idea to decorate the castle with lots of hollies to make her feel better. Belle then, after dinner, discovered Beast's decorations after Beast led her to them.

In the eleventh issue, set an unspecified time after the prior issue, Belle was reading with Beast in the library when she discovered it was a bit chilly, and eventually discovered the cause was because the door was ajar. However, she then discovered that because of the earlier snowstorm, her favorite book was ruined. Her devastation was made even worse when Beast obliviously insulted her book in an attempt to make her feel better, leaving without a word while crying to herself and also being unwilling to eat at dinner with the Beast. She also explained to the Wardrobe what the story was about, with the Wardrobe also explaining that before books, there were storytellers, with Belle acknowledging that nothing can take it away from her.

In the twelfth issue, picking up where the prior issue left off, Belle expressed some uncertainty about the Beast, especially given his inconsistent nature, and is struggling to understand him. Later, Belle finds the Beast arriving at the library, and he attempts to tell her something. However, before the Beast could begin to explain, the Wardrobe (who decided to make an opera thanks to what Belle told her earlier) basically started an opera in the library, causing Beast to skulk off. Belle then pursued him and tried to find out what he wanted to tell her, and he revealed he had repaired her favorite book and apologized for the earlier comment.

In the thirteenth and final issue, Belle helped prepare a cherry pie for dessert for a meal she and Beast were having, to thank him for repairing the book earlier. She later put it on the windowsill for it to cool off after it was done being baked. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to her, Sultan, while jumping in and out of the window while forced outside by the servants, ruined the dessert and proceeded to eat it up. Despite this and Beast and her learning the bad news, Beast wasn't the least bit upset, and in fact, was touched that Belle even made him dessert in the first place. As a result, she and the Beast shared a moment near the fireplace, with the servants witnessing it.

Besides the main comic serial, the [[Winter Wonderland|fifth issue]] for the anthology series ''[[Disney Comic Hits!]]'' had her as a child sledding alongside Gaston and the Bimbettes, suggesting that she had initially been friends with Gaston and the Bimbettes prior to the events of the first film and that Belle may have moved to the village when she was very young (at least around Chip's age, according to her). She also ended up being given by Beast a sleigh ride as her Christmas present, with it being implied that Chip suggested the present to him.

===''[[Disney Adventures]]''===
Belle appeared in at least two stories for Disney Adventures magazine, both being in the Twelfth Volume:

In the first story, ''Time Flies!'' Belle informed an agitated Cogsworth that dinner was only a few hours away (as he was under the belief that dinner was actually supposed to happen by that point and the staff was late), and then discovered the cause at the wrong time: Cogsworth's wind up key was stolen as a prank (revealed to be by Lumiere). This story was later reprinted in ''Disney Princess Comics Treasury''.

In the second story, ''[[Sittin' Pretty!]]'', Belle made an appearance in the ending of the comic, where she was amused at the servants' attempts to give Beast a makeover, noting he looked ridiculous, as well as adorable, catching Beast off-guard. Beast also went through the makeover because he was ranting about how Belle can love him when he looks hideous.

===''[[Kilala Princess]]''===
[[File:Kilala Princess - Belle.png|thumb|left|250px|Belle in ''Kilala Princess''.]]
In the manga series ''Kilala Princess'', the main characters Kilala, Prince Rei, and Princess Sylphy enter the world of "Beauty and the Beast" looking for magical gems to activate the Magic Tiara's power and awaken the princess within Kilala. When Belle first meets them, Kilala immediately asks to shake her hand. They become fast friends, and Belle asks the Beast to let them stay in the castle and work. Sylphy's egocentric attitude initially makes it unbearable for everyone, but it improves over time. When Cogsworth accidentally loses the pocket watch that the Beast planned to give to Belle, Kilala and Rei go into town to find it. Though they manage to retrieve the watch, in a broken condition, the amber stored inside is stolen by Gaston.

The Beast remains unaware of this incident, and when it breaks in his hand, he bursts out angrily and hides in his room. In order to cheer him up, Kilala, Rei, and Sylphy steal back the lost gem from Gaston. Kilala then tells him why he wanted to give Belle the watch in the first place, and that it doesn't matter if the gift is broken. Belle accepts the broken watch and gives the gem to Kilala as a token of gratitude, and turns into a gem of the [[Magic Tiara]]. She is last seen witnessing Kilala receive her own gem: an emerald.

===''[[The Beast Within: A Tale of Beauty's Prince]]''===
Belle appears in {{WikipediaLink|Serena Valentino}}'s novel "The Beast Within" with a much-reduced role. She first appears at a ball thrown by the Prince, where he is drawn to her but is discouraged to do so by Gaston, who mentions that she is the daughter of a crazy inventor and that all she talks about is books. Inspired by this, the Prince then goes to a prettier girl named Tulip, whom he decides to marry. Later, she appears in events that are canon to the film, however, the wolves are sent by the sisters of the [[Enchantress]], who desire to kill her so the Prince will remain a beast forever. However, in having the Beast save Belle, they inadvertently set into motion the events that lead to the Beast's redemption and his and Belle's happily ever after.

===''Disney Princess: Royal Weddings''===
In this book featuring the wedding between Belle and the Prince, Belle decided that, since the Prince had spent time unloved during the curse, she might also do something to show the Prince is indeed loved. She then secretly invited the village to the wedding. During the ceremony, she then received a book from the Prince, so they could "write their future adventures together".

==Video games==
===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Belle KHII.png|right|150px]]
Belle is a character in the series and plays a pivotal role as one of the [[Princesses of Heart]].

In the first ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' game, Belle was captured by [[Maleficent]]'s forces while she was living with the [[Beast]], and was placed into an enchanted sleep alongside the other Princesses at Maleficent's stronghold in [[Radiant Garden|Hollow Bastion]] while her world was consumed in darkness by the [[Heartless]]. Her heart was used to open the Final Keyhole, which would open the door to darkness itself, and briefly stolen as well by [[Ansem, Seeker of Darkness]] to craft his own dark [[Keyblade]]. This caused Beast, who survived the destruction of his world and followed Belle through sheer willpower, to have a vision of Belle being turned into a Pureblood Shadow Heartless, infuriating him and causing him to attack the Heartless, separating him from [[Sora]] as he faced [[Riku]]. However, Belle's heart is later restored when Sora pierces himself with Ansem's Keyblade to release [[Kairi]]'s heart from his body, destroying Ansem's Keyblade and releasing the Princesses' hearts, and she is able to awaken (at which point she can be found not conversing with the other Princesses in the Castle Chapel, but rather in Maleficent's library), and finally, reunites with the Beast. As thanks for helping her and the Beast, Belle grants Sora the Divine Rose Keychain for his Keyblade to use in his battles. After Sora seals [[Kingdom Hearts]], Belle and the Beast are able to return home.

An illusion of Belle also appeared in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', who acts cold towards the Beast in order to prevent Maleficent from stealing her heart. After the villain's defeat, she apologizes for deceiving the Beast, which the Beast forgives.

The real Belle appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days|358/2 Days]]'' alongside Beast in [[Beast's Castle]], where their peace was threatened by [[Xaldin]], who intended to take the Beast's heart.

Her role is greatly expanded in the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Xaldin of [[Organization XIII]] had continued to play on the Beast's anger to plunge his heart into the darkness to create a powerful Heartless and Nobody to use for the Organization's plans, resulting in him sealing his servants in the dungeon while Belle holed up in her room in the East Wing. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy arrive and reunite with her, they are able to calm the Beast with support from [[Cogsworth]]. Belle tries to confront Xaldin on her own, but is met with a Heartless attack in the form of the Pureblood Shadow Stalker/Dark Thorn Heartless, which chases her into the ballroom before she escapes to safety on the outside balcony, leaving the Heartless to face Sora and the Beast, corrupting the ballroom with darkness to give it an advantage against them by turning the ballroom's own elements, such as the columns and chandelier, into weapons it could use against the Keyblade wielder and the Beast. After the creature was defeated, and Xaldin taunts the heroes briefly before retreating, the Beast apologizes to Belle, who accepts it, but scolds him for not trusting her. She later goes on a date with the Beast and prepares to dance with him in the ballroom until Xaldin interrupts the dance, much to Belle's annoyance at having her date ruined by Xaldin as he summons his personal Dragoon [[Nobodies]] to fight Sora and the Beast while Belle takes cover on the outside balcony with the servants. After Xaldin leaves, the Beast realizes that his enchanted rose is in danger, and arrives in the West Wing to find Xaldin had stolen it. He finds himself in despair after this discovery, and asks Belle to leave out of shame for his actions when he takes his frustration out on her before Sora intervenes and reprimands him for blaming her for what happened. Returning to her room in the East Wing and changing from her ballgown back to her regular clothes, Belle finds the rose on her balcony later on, but it's revealed to be a trap by Xaldin, who kidnaps her and forces the Beast to choose between her and the rose to leave behind. Beast chooses Belle, but Belle suddenly fights back against the Organization member and takes back the rose, forcing Xaldin to have to fight Sora, Donald, Goofy, and the Beast instead after losing both of his bargaining chips thanks to Belle. After Xaldin is defeated, Belle returns the rose to the Beast, who then asks her to stay with him in his castle, to which she happily accepts. The credits reveal that the Beast has transformed back into his human form of the Prince, apparently ending the Beauty and the Beast story arc in the series.

===''[[Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey]]''===
Unlike the other Princesses are featured in the game, Belle and her world play a minor role and acts as a mere mini-game. Belle and Lumiere are featured in the world and ask the player to eliminate the game's enemies (Bogs) before Beast finds out about their presence.

===''[[Disney Heroes: Battle Mode]]''===
Belle appears in the mobile fighting video game as a new and unlockable character with ten tokens, despite not having a basic attack, her ability to read gives her energy, in addition to doing a little jump to provide a shield does not It was present in the film but the stick that she used to protect herself from wolves is present as well as Maurice's invention.

Belle appears as a meet-and-greet character in [[Fantasyland]]. She also takes part in the ''[[Mickey's Soundsational Parade]]'' and ''Princess Fantasy Faire'' mini-games. She is normally found outside the ''Princess Fantasy Faire'', across from where [[Ariel]] stands by ''[[It's a Small World]]'', and her first request upon speaking with her involves recovering several of the Beast's books that blew away in a thunderstorm. After they are found and returned to her, she then asks the player to see if they can find more, as ten more books are scattered around the park in the various lands that can be returned to her when they are all recovered. Her final request is to replace some of the Beast's pictures that he wrecked when he lost his temper one day. Completing her tasks unlocks her at the ''Princess Fantasy Faire'' as one of the Princesses the player can dance with.

==[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Musical]]==

A [[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Broadway musical adaptation of the film]] premiered on Broadway on April 18, 1994, at the Palace Theatre with [[Susan Egan]] as the original Belle. Since then, many actresses including Deborah Gibson, Toni Braxton, [[Andrea McArdle]], Jamie-Lynn Sigler, [[Christy Carlson Romano]], and Ashley Brown have played the role on Broadway. The show closed on July 29, 2007, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater with [[Anneliese van der Pol]] as the show's final Belle.

Overall, Belle's role was the same as in the film, although some differences included Belle politely refusing Gaston's hand in marriage instead of tricking him into falling into a mud pool, joining [[Lumiere]] and dancing along with the dishes and silverware during the ''[[Be Our Guest]]'' musical number instead of just sitting at the dining table and merely observing the spectacle, and her being injured by the Beast when she entered the West Wing before fleeing instead of merely being scared off. Additionally, her role is expanded in the musical with songs "[[No Matter What]]" (cut in touring productions), "[[Home (song)|Home]]" and "[[A Change in Me]]".

Belle is also without Philippe in the stage version, instead of knitting a "lucky" scarf for Maurice to wear during his trip to the fair. Maurice is attacked by wolves before becoming a prisoner within the Beast's castle. His scarf is lost in the woods, and eventually found by LeFou. When LeFou is spotted in town with the scarf, he reveals to Belle the whereabouts in which he found it, prompting her to search for her potentially endangered father.

When given the library, Belle also reveals "King Arthur" to be amongst her favorite stories.

[[File:Tumblr mhouiyjNYd1qlt206o1 1280.png.jpg|thumb|250px|Belle in Disneyland.]]
===[[Disneyland Resort]]===
At [[Disneyland]], Belle can be spotted on a float in [[Mickey's Soundsational Parade]]. At the [[Fantasy Faire]], Belle tells her tale with help from Lumiere, Mister Smythe, and Mister Jones in the Royal Theater.

Belle appears in the original version of [[World of Color]] in [[Disney California Adventure]]. She appears in the opening during the theme of the show shown ball dancing with Beast. She later appears starting the show's finale as she confesses her love for Beast, and he transforms into a handsome prince.

Belle is also prominently featured in [[Paint the Night]] parade, as part of a ''Princess''-themed float, alongside [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and [[Rapunzel]].

Belle also frequently appears for meet-and-greets, both in her blue and gold dresses. More recently, though, the blue dress has been the only one seen due to the gold dress causing back issues to cast members.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
In the former show held at the [[Magic Kingdom]], Storytime with Belle, Belle would tell her story to an audience, some of which were chosen to act as characters in the story. The show then became part of the attraction, [[Enchanted Tales with Belle]]. In the same park, she can be seen making daily appearances in the first float of the [[Festival of Fantasy Parade]]. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Enchanted Tales with Belle is currently closed, but expected to reopen in full before the end of the [[Walt Disney World 50th Anniversary]] festivities.

Belle has her own spell card in the attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]] known as "Belle's Mountain Blizzard".

In [[Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], Belle appears and plays out her same role as in the film. In the same park, Belle can also be found in [[Fantasmic!]], during the princess-themed medley. It also appeared at Disneyland Park (Paris) until 1997.

For meet-and-greets, she has made appearances with Gaston in the Magic Kingdom's New Fantasyland and alone at [[Epcot]]'s [[World Showcase]] around the France pavilion. Most of the time, she's seen in her blue peasant dress. However, during Epcot's ''Festival of the Holidays'', she'll wear her red and gold dress from ''The Enchanted Christmas''. Since her attraction in New Fantasyland is still undergoing reopening due to the coronavirus pandemic, Belle can still be found in her cottage that the attraction starts at for meet-and-greets, though due to concerns from [[Cast Member]]s regarding her gold ballgown, she regularly appears in her blue and white village clothes, and her red and gold dress seen in the sequel when the weather is cold enough to recommend it. When she could still wear her gold ballgown during cold weather, she wore a long-sleeved multi-layered winter version with a caplet to keep her shoulders and arms warm, with thicker, insulated versions of her gloves.

===[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]===
Belle is featured towards the end of [[Once Upon a Time (Tokyo Disneyland)|Once Upon a Time]], where she and Beast share a dance before the latter is attacked by Gaston. After Gaston's death, Belle is present to witness the Beast's transformation into a human. Belle and Beast also appear as the centerpiece for the ''Beauty and the Beast'' unit of [[Main Street Electrical Parade|Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights]].

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===
In Paris, she, who presented by Rosie and Louis, holds a mask while entering [[The Starlit Princess Waltz]] as part of the 25th Anniversary, and its 2019 Christmas season, The Royal Sparkling Winter Waltz. Princesses hold fans and switch them and dance with Beast/Adam and princes.

At the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]], Belle appears in [[Mickey and the Magician]], sharing a ballroom waltz with Beast during Lumiere's segment of the show.

===[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]===
Belle is featured in the [[Flights of Fantasy Parade]], along with the other Princesses on the Swan airboat, called ''Romance Takes Wing''. She has also featured in the [[Paint the Night]] Parade as part of a ''Beauty and the Beast''-themed float.

===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===
Belle is featured on the ''Beauty and the Beast'' display in [[Voyage to the Crystal Grotto]]. A statue depicting Belle and Beast can also be found in the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel.

===[[Disney Cruise Line]]===
In [[Disney's Believe|Believe]] aboard the [[Disney Dream]], Belle appears alongside Mrs. Potts in Lumiere's segment of the show.

==[[Disney Princess]]==
Belle's popularity and strong characterization led her to become a member of the ''Disney Princess'' franchise.

===Redesign===
[[File:Bella.20.png|right|250px]]
Belle received many changes in her late [[2012]] redesign.

Her gown now possesses the same gold color from the film instead of the yellow color in the previous franchise, however, the bottom half is now decorated with glittery designs of roses.

The off-the-shoulder part of the dress is made of cream-colored organza and pinned in the front by three pearls of varying sizes. Her evening gloves match the color and material of the dress's shoulders.

In early redesigns, Belle's sleeves were covering her shoulders instead of revealing them.

===[[Palace Pets]]===
Belle's Palace Pets are Teacup, Petit, Rouge, Booksy, Page, and Lacy.

==Differences from the source material==
*"Beauty" or "Little Beauty" was just a nickname, not her actual name. Her actual name was never mentioned.
*Beauty's characterization in the original tale is depicted as kind, pure-hearted, but slightly timid. Belle on the other hand, while kind and pure-hearted like in the original tale, is also quirky, intelligent, open-minded and rebellious.
*Beauty had (besides three brothers) two older sisters in the original story. According to screenwriter [[Linda Woolverton]], she had removed Belle's sisters to keep the focus on Belle's strained relationship with Gaston, as well as to avoid confusion with [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]] and [[Anastasia Tremaine]] from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.
*She at one point lived in a mansion, her father being a wealthy merchant before he lost all his fortune at sea. Then the family had to move and live in a small farmhouse. [[Beauty and the Beast Original Screenplay|Early development in the film]] had originally intended to use this backstory, but it ended up cut.
*In the original tale, Belle didn't mind that she lived a boring life as a peasant after moving to the country (while her sisters constantly complained about it), while in the Disney film, it's the exact opposite, as she expressed boredom towards the provincial life in the opening song.
*The Beast received Beauty graciously and informed her that she was a mistress of the castle and that he was her servant. They would hold lengthy conversations, and he would give her lavish clothing and every night ask her to marry him, but she would always decline.
*In the original story, her father sold her off to the Beast, due to her sisters refusing the Beast, as well as Belle ultimately accepting it due to blaming herself since it was her simple request for a rose that put her in that situation in the first place. In the movie, Belle volunteered to be taken prisoner for Maurice's freedom, with Maurice being unwilling to let Belle make that sacrifice.
*While looking upon a mirror soon after her arrival, Beauty sees a vision of her father returning home.
*While in the castle, Beauty would dream of a handsome prince asking her to marry him. Belle became convinced that the Beast was holding the prince captive somewhere in the castle. She looked but never found him.
*Beauty asks to see her family again and promises to return in 8 days' time instead of being permanently released from imprisonment by the Beast with no fixed deadline to return back to the Beast's castle.
*Beauty returns to the castle because she finds out that the Beast is dying from a broken heart in her much longer absence which was achieved by the Beast's instructions to place her ring on a table when she wanted to return.
*At the end of the story, she and the Beast get married and the sisters are punished by a fairy in Beauty's dreams to become statues for the malice in their hearts but are to return to their present shape after they recognize their faults. Something similar occurs in the 1988 draft, although her sisters are instead turned into animals, alongside Belle's suitors.

==Trivia==
[[File:Belle golden dress with book.png|thumb]]
*Belle is the only Princess who has a name with one syllable.
*Belle's name means "beautiful" in French (not "beauty" which is said "beauté" in French). Her complete given name in the tale is "La belle enfant" ("The Beautiful Child").
*She is the only person in her village to wear blue.
*Her hair always falling down resembles her strangeness to the other villagers.
*Belle's movements maintain an air of elegance. This was at the request of the story writers and producers of ''Beauty and the Beast'', where they studied the movements of ballerinas during the course of Belle's development. Like ballerinas, Belle walks diligently and swiftly on her toes no matter what types of shoes she is wearing or where she is located. She can subconsciously navigate her way through a crowded street while reading, without colliding with any other people or objects (although having several near-misses), at one point even deflecting water that was about to pour on top of her while she was reading without once looking up.
*Belle's eyes were originally going to be gray, but in the final cut, they were hazel.
*Belle is currently the only official Disney Princess to have hazel eyes.
*In the New Fantasyland, Belle's cottage shows a picture of her reading with her [[Belle's mother|mother]]―a beautiful woman with wavy, light brown hair, blue eyes, and wearing a pink dress. One wall in the cottage also has height marks up until her 18th birthday, suggesting she maybe 18 years old during the films. Based on this painting, her mother, when she was still alive, probably looked exactly like Belle but with lighter hair and blue eyes.
**The New Fantasyland attraction also implied with the height wall that Belle may have been born in the village, which contradicted a theory stemmed from a brief lyric in the opening song, that implied that Belle and her father had moved to the village sometime prior to the events of the original film.
**The book Belle viewed as her favorite was also shown in the attraction to be "le Songe d'une femme" (lit. "the dream of a woman"), as a possible nod to ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. It also revealed that, at least by the events of the movie, she had at least two copies of ''Sleeping Beauty'': The one her mom read to her when she was a child (thus explaining why it was her favorite, as well as why she loved reading), and the other being the book she got from the bookstore during the opening song.
**In addition, James Baxter, Belle's supervising animator, mentioned that Belle was "a few years older than Ariel," implying that Belle was at least 18 years old as Ariel is stated to be 16 in her own movie.
*Before [[Paige O'Hara]] got the role of Belle, the producers first considered [[Jodi Benson]], who was best known as the voice of Ariel, to voice Belle. Benson, however, did voice Belle in Disney's ''[[House of Mouse]]''.
*Belle is the only Disney Princess with a singing voice to not sing her film's main theme song during the film itself (Mrs. Potts, a supporting character, sings the song instead). Although, Paige O'Hara individually recorded her own version of ''Beauty and the Beast'' and performed it several times live, outside the film itself.
*In ''Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World'', Belle tells the Beast the ''Cinderella'' fairy tale during the first segment.
*In the beginning of the original 1989 storyline, found on the Diamond Edition DVD, Belle's birthday is celebrated, and the cake reads "Happy 17th Birthday Belle", providing evidence that she is 17 in the movie, or at least that she was originally planned to be 17.
*Belle was nominated for AFI's 100 Year...100 Hero and Villain list, one of the three animated heroes and one of three Disney animated heroes, along with [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]], and [[Buzz Lightyear]]. Unfortunately, none of them made the cut.
*A costume of Belle, as well as the rest of the Disney Princesses (excluding [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]], [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], [[Merida]], and [[Moana (character)|Moana]]), has been released on the video game ''Little Big Planet 2'' as downloadable content from the PlayStation Store.
*In the comic adaptation of the film, Belle wears her pinny more often and her ponytail like Gaston's stays intact even though it's raining.
*One poster for the film for some reason showed Belle in a pink-and-purple dress resembling Rapunzel's.
*In the ''[[Gargoyles]]'' episode "[[Eye of the Beholder (Gargoyles)|Eye of the Beholder]]", [[Elisa Maza]] dresses up as Belle for Halloween and shares a relationship with Goliath, similar to Belle's relationship with the Beast. However, Goliath is a beast turned into a human, unlike the Beast, whose circumstance is the polar opposite.
*In the climax of ''[[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'', [[Elizabeth Henshaw]]'s ghost appears in a golden dress with opera gloves similar to that of Belle's iconic ensemble. Her love interest [[Master Gracey]] is dressed in a blue jacket with gold trim similar to that of the Beast's outfit.
*Paige O'Hara, the first voice actor for Belle, does a fan artwork of Belle on her official website and sells the artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Paige O'Hara|url=http://www.paigeohara.net/artwork.htm|title=Paige O'Hara - Website}}</ref>
*The books Belle has read are ''Jack and the Beanstalk'', ''Sleeping Beauty'', and ''Romeo and Juliet'' (the last of which is only in "[[Human Again]]" on the Special Edition). She was also shown to have read the tale of ''Cinderella'' in ''Belle's Magical World''. In the musical (and in the storyboard), she has also read ''King Arthur''.
*In ''The Enchanted Christmas'', the book that Belle wrote and wrapped together was the original tale for ''Beauty and the Beast''.
*Contrary to popular belief, it's not made clear whether Belle was actually born a peasant, as she implies that she wasn't born in her home village in the opening song, but rather moved there. In addition, her owning books at her cottage implied that she is, or at least was, considerably wealthy (as back in the time period of the film, books were considerably expensive).
**In the musical, specifically the song "[[No Matter What]]" one of the lyrics had Maurice stating "''You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class ... crème de la crème''", implying that Belle was part of the social upper class. This was also supported by Belle having a portrait of her and her mom in the Enchanted Tales of Belle attraction.
**Similarly, it was never stated where Belle had moved from other than it presumably being another location in France. The book "Belle's Discovery" as well as the live-action remake would later state that she had originally lived in Paris.
*Belle being carried by the Prince near the end of the film is a reference to the poster of ''It's a Wonderful Life'' where George Bailey holds his wife.
*Belle's blue peasant outfit closely resembles the one worn by an extra during the third act of ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966), though this is almost certainly coincidence.
*In the activity book ''Wedding Wishes'', Belle ended up tossing the bouquet to the Bimbettes.
*Belle is the only main character in her village who wears blue. The animators wanted to accentuate how out of place she seems, so they paid extra close attention to her wardrobe, making sure that Belle would be the only member of the town to wear blue, whilst the other townsfolk sported more rustic and earthy colors such as red, green, orange, gray, and brown.
*The green and rose dresses Belle wears can be briefly seen stored on the left side of the [[Wardrobe]] and displayed to Belle during her first night of captivity when she was asked to join the Beast for dinner.
*In the fifth issue of Marvel Comics, when Belle rejects Gaston in the flashback and the triplets enviously note Gaston's obsession with Belle, they state that she doesn't even go to dances at the village. This was a subtle reference to the original tale, where Beauty preferred to stay at home reading good books, which often got her mocked by her sisters, who by contrast liked to go to balls, public walks, and plays.
*Although Belle is explicitly stated in the film to have no parallel regarding her looks, it seems that her appearance can be replicated, as Laurette (one of the Bimbettes) managed to disguise herself as Belle well enough to completely fool Gaston in the third issue of Marvel Comics.
*Belle is mentioned in the [[Disney Channel]] original movie ''[[Smart House]]''.
