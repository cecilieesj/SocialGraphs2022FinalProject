'''Bambino''' is the main character from the [[2012]] Disney•[[Pixar]] animated short, ''[[La Luna]]''. He is a young child who curiously discovers the moon during a quiet night on the ocean along with his father Papà and his grandfather Nonno.

==Background==
Bambino wears a white short sleeved shirt, brown overalls, and a pair of brown boots. Besides those he wears, he also wears a brown newsboy cap, just like what Papà and Nonno are wearing

==Role in the short==
Bambino and his family sail on sea on a quiet night where his grandfather Nonno gives him a hat just as Papà and Nonno argue about keeping Bambino's hat straight. Seeing the moon rising near them, Papà gives Bambino a ladder for Bambino to climb to which Bambino climbs up to the moon as Nonno tells him to continue further. Noticing that the ladder is not high enough for the moon, Bambino feels no gravity while at the top of the ladder and finds himself on the moon where he sees many stars around him. Arriving at the moon, Bambino's father tells him that he will rescue him to help him get down back to their boat to which upon grabbing the anchor, he notices a shooting star pass by as he touches it just as his father and grandfather arrive.

Bambino is later given a bristly broom by his father, telling him to sweep the stars like what Nonno is doing just as his family members argue to know which broom Bambino should choose so he can help the two sweep away the stars. As Papà and Nonno are still arguing, Bambino hands them their brooms, but they ignore him as they continue to argue until they see another shooting star pass by, which is a bigger one just as they curiously see the biggest star they have ever seen. Papà and Nonno attempt to get the big star out of the moon, to which Bambino hits it and notices the glow upon hitting it. Bambino then climbs on the star and gently hits it with a hammer he found in the bucket as the big star shatters into regular-sized stars as Papà and Nonno look at Bambino who is safe all along as the two react in joy. Bambino then uses a rake as he, Papà, and Nonno work together in cooperation in sweeping away the stars before returning back to their boat. Bambino, Papà, and Nonno happily observe the half moon in the sky after having an adventure on the moon.

==Trivia==
