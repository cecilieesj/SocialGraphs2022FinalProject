{{Quote|Liv Amara is 23 and runs her own biotech company. In other words—totally hardcore.|[[Go Go Tomago]] on Liv}}
'''Liv Amara''' is a character who appears in ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''. She is a self-made billionaire and the founder of [[Sycorax]], a biotech company, who was placed into cryogenic stasis after experimenting on herself with life-threatening parasites. While in suspended animation, her clone, [[Di Amara]], impersonated her, tasked to save her life no matter what.

==Background==
Having garnered tremendous success at a young age, Liv Amara is one of [[San Fransokyo]]'s most renowned billionaires (though Alistair Krei is more or less neutral). Her expertise is biotech, which her company specializes in.

At an unknown point, Liv Amara created genetically engineered symbiotic organism called parasynths. When she proposed her findings to the scientific community, doctors refused to let her carry out trials. So, Liv decided to test the parasynths on herself, which resulted in life-threatening consequences. The parasynths unexpectedly evolved to attack human cells and started deteriorating Liv from the inside. Doctors were unable to save her, and only had weeks to live. With no options left, Liv, before confining herself in cryo-state, created a genetic duplicate named Diane "Di", whom she entrusted to find a cure at Sycorax. The duplicate took on her identity. Little did she know that her clone was going to extreme measures to save her.

Thanks to SFIT students [[Hiro Hamada]] and [[Karmi]], a cure was provided, and Liv was revived. However, instead of being thankful, Liv was mad and ashamed at Di's unethical, destructive behavior and subsequently turned her over to the San Fransokyo Police Department. Following the arrests of Di and her assistant [[Chris (Big Hero 6)|Chris]], Liv presumably regained ownership of Sycorax.

==Trivia==
*Liv and Di's names are a play on the words "Live" and "Die."
**Her name is also Scandinavian for "life". This references Liv's occupation, her benevolent personality, and her goal to improve life.
