The '''ID9 Seeker Droid''' (also referred as '''Parrot Droids''') is a small Imperial probe droid that appears in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.

They may be small in size, but ID9 seeker droids are dangerous and deadly when used for nefarious purposes. Resembling probe droids, ID9 seekers had a half-hemisphere dome with a threatening red eye. They could hover and crawl on their pincers, imitate other droids, and were outfitted with electro-shock prods that could incapacitate mechanical beings and harm organic lifeforms. The [[Seventh Sister]], one of the Empireâ€™s Inquisitors, employed a small army of ID9s in her efforts to capture rebels and [[Jedi]].
