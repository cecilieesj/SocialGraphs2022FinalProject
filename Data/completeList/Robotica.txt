}}'''Robotica''' is a robotic maid created by [[Gyro Gearloose]] in the show ''[[DuckTales]]''. Her first and only appearance was in the episode [[Metal Attraction|"Metal Attraction"]].
==Biography==
After [[Bentina Beakley]] goes to [[Scrooge McDuck]] to complain that she is being overworked, Gyro takes it upon himself to create a robotic maid to assist her. Named Robotica, the maid makes a poor first impression when her callous personality scares the children. The inventor determines that he can fix this issue by giving her a new set of emotions. Robotica makes a 180 degree turn, now filled with enthusiasm and affection. And no one is more of a recipient of these feelings than [[Fenton Crackshell|Gizmoduck]], whom she develops an immediate crush on.

Unfortunately, Fenton Crackshell is having romantic issues of his own with his love interest, [[Gandra Dee]]. After several attempts to break it to Robotica that he is not interested in her, he finally puts his foot down while the two are in the tunnel of love. Furious that Gizmoduck has another woman, the maid first assaults Mrs. Beakley before finally deducing that Gandra Dee is the one. Robotica abducts Gandra and binds her in front of the Money bin. She plans to destroy both the rival and the bin with a giant missile so that Gizmoduck - with no job and no girlfriend - will be completely free to spend all of his time with her. However, when the metal hero moves to sacrifice himself to save Gandra's life, Robotica then jumps in front of the missile to save his.

Fortunately, Gyro manages to rebuild Robotica from the wreckage and manages to give her a more balanced set of emotions. Content, the former maid finds a new job, as well as a potential new love interest, at the "Econo-Lube and Perm Boutique".
