[[File:Angel3.jpg|thumb]]'''Angel''', the mysterious guitar-strumming musician, guides the Cheetahs as they explore Barcelona. He pops up at all the right places, with a glint in his eye and a folk song at his fingertips. Although he's very modest about it, Angel is very well connected to the Barcelona music scene. This calm, curly-haired new friend helps the Cheetahs out in very surprising ways. He is also the love interest of [[Galleria Garibaldi]].

==Background==
Not much is know about Angel, except that he is related to someone connected in the Barcelona Music Festival.

==Events==
===[[The Cheetah Girls 2]]===
When the girls arrive in Barcelona, they do some shopping before resting in a Cafe. Soon they hear a guitar playing and meet Angel, who accompanies them around Barcelona as they sing to the entire city, and he becomes Galleria's love interest ("Strut").
The Cheetahs go to the Dancing Cat, a local Spanish night club where all the new artists perform their songs, which includes Angel ("Why Wait") ("A La Nanita Nana").

The Cheetah Girls' dreams are in serious trouble. While they were performing Step Up, Lola convinces the Dancing Cat's manager to pay the Cheetah Girls money. The competition will only allow amateur performs to compete. Accepting payment from the Dancing Cat makes the Cheetah Girls professional performers. Angel, who was present during the entire exchange, investigates.

Right before Chanel is going to get changed to perform with Marisol, the Festival Director informs that the Cheetah Girls are able to perform after getting a tip. Everyone is surprised when they see that the informer was his nephew, Angel. He informed that Lola tried to sabotage the Cheetahs, and his uncle reinstates the girls as the Cheetah Girls. Lola tries to dispute, but the Director will not hear it. Marisol finally tells off her mother, saying she is quitting the competition because she loves to sing and her mother is just desperate to make her a star. The Cheetah Girls then perform "Amigas Cheetahs", and as a surprise, bring Marisol onto the stage, along with Joaquin's dancing crew, Angel on the guitar and the Director on the trumpet. Their song is a hit with the crowd.

==Physical Appearance==
Angel is a Spanish male. He has a tangle/curly mix of blond and brown hair. He also has a sort of build.

==Trivia==
