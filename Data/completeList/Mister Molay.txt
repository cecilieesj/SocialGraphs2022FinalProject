'''Mr. Molay''' is a comics character who first appeared in the story ''[[The Crown of the Crusader Kings]]'' in ''[[Uncle Scrooge]] #339''.

==History==
In that story he is known to be the head of The International Money Council. He and his associate [[Maurice Mattressface]] confiscate a crown from Scrooge McDuck and his nephews. He also appears in the story titled ''[[The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter From Home]]'', in which he and Maurice plan to steal the treasure from Scrooge's old ancestral castle and using Scrooge's sister Matilda to get it. Later in that story Maurice betrayed Mr. Molay.

Mr. Molay has only appeared in these two stories. He is named after Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Knights Templar.
