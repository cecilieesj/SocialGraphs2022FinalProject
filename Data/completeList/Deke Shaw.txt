'''Deke Shaw''' is a character on the [[ABC]] series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. He is portrayed by Jeff Ward.

==Personality==
Deke is the ultimate survivor and roguish scavenger, the guy who can get people what they need, but at a price of his asking. With his sharp mind and quick wit, he is both a real asset in a tight spot and a hard man to trust.

==History==
Deke was the last naturally born human in his timeline. The Kree began sterilizing humans through the food; thus they created humans through genetic engineering.

==Trivia==

* To help send Team Coulson back to their properly time-space through the [[Quantum Realm]] (as normal time travel with the monolith would only take them further into the alternate future), Deke elected to stay in the alternate 1980s to activate the device and help rebuild Victoria Hand rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. as its new director.
