|quote = "I'm Tour Guide Barbie!"<br/>"[[Matterhorn Bobsleds|Remain seated please. ''¡Permanecer sentados por favor!]]"''}}'''Tour Guide Barbie''' is a supporting character in the [[1999]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, [[Toy Story 2|''Toy Story 2'']]. She briefly helps [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys on their adventure to rescue [[Woody]] from [[Al McWhiggin]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 2]]''===
While [[Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog]], [[Rex]], and [[Hamm]] are driving around Al's Toy Barn in a toy car looking for [[Al McWhiggin|Al]]'s office, where they plan to find [[Woody]], they come down the Barbie and Hamm asks them for help. Tour Guide Barbie dives in the car with them agrees to help them. She takes them down the Hot Wheels Aisle and then the [[Buzz Lightyear]] Aisle where they come across [[Utility Belt Buzz|Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear]], thinking it's [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s [[Buzz Lightyear]], and give him a lift.

In the [[Outtakes|bloopers]], she says goodbye to the viewers, before complaining about her cheeks killing her, having to smile so much.

==Trivia==
*When the toys arrive at the [[Buzz Lightyear]] aisle, Tour Guide Barbie mentions [[1995]] retailers didn't order enough Buzz Lightyear toys to meet demand. 1995 is the year the first [[Toy Story|''Toy Story'']] movie was released.
**This is also based on a real event. Because of the success of the first ''Toy Story'', Buzz Lightyear toys had a higher demand than retailers expected.
