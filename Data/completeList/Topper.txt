He is designed to give off a bright light with which to pose as an invasion-signaling beacon to the [[Galactic Armada]]. His one true place is as a Christmas star.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Topper is a small yellow-orange star-shaped creature with a little white-tipped antenna on his head, small dark blue eyes, a thin mouth, white-tipped limbs, and a white marking on his belly.

===Powers and abilities===
Topper can produce a brilliant light visible even from space that helps alien fleets locate him.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 025 was the 25th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel's]] funding. He was designed to use his bright light to pose as a beacon for an invasion to the [[Galactic Armada]]. 025 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

025's pod was found by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] on Christmas Eve, which he planned on having gift-wrapped and sent out to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] as a Christmas present after [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] suggested it.

Meanwhile, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was attempting to teach [[Stitch]] about Christmas when the latter soon noticed a woman putting 025's pod in a gift box. Stitch hastily grabbed what he thought was the gift-wrapped pod, but when he tried to tell Lilo, she ignored him.

When Gantu later dropped by to pick up 025's pod, the same woman who had gift-wrapped it earlier hinted that there was a mishap involving Stitch, much to Gantu's anger. He then swore to avenge Stitch for stealing Hämsterviel's holiday gift.

In an attempt to find the pod, Stitch stole countless presents from every house and the local mall on Kauai. Lilo assumed Stitch was selfishly hoarding Christmas gifts for himself, but after the latter was captured and interrogated by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], Stitch revealed what he was really trying to do. Shortly after, Gantu attacked the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]] and managed to make off with all the stolen presents.

Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, and [[Pleakley]] located the experiment pod in [[Kokaua Town|town]], where the four tussled with Gantu dressed in a [[Santa Claus|Santa]] outfit. Lilo and Stitch snatched the gift-wrapped pod from Gantu, although he retrieved it after a long chase. When Gantu then attempted to crush Lilo for meddling, she reprimanded him until he admitted that he intended to give 025's pod to Hämsterviel as a Christmas present.

Just then, a little girl asked Gantu for a mere Christmas gift, believing he was actually Santa. Forced to comply, Gantu ended up giving 025's pod to her and later distributed presents to other children, thereby honoring the true spirit of Christmas.

After Jumba discovered 025 to be harmless, Lilo activated 025 in a fountain. She then named him Topper, shared him with the little girl seen from before, and gave him a one true place atop the local Christmas tree (actually a decorated Pleakley) as a Christmas star, while Topper's bright light unintentionally signaled the [[Galactic Armada]].

Topper reappeared in "[[Elastico (episode)|Elastico]]" as one of the audience members for Lilo's hula dance.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Topper was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 591 instead of 025.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Topper, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Topper participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did. However, it is presumed that he wouldn't have been able to be very effective, due to the fact that his powers are deemed useless.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Topper made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as one of the experiments in [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]].

==Trivia==
*Topper was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.
*Topper is one of the rare experiments to not have black eyes like most experiments, having blue eyes instead.
*Topper's primary function is to use his bright light to signal the alien attack fleet. However, on the Disney site, it is incorrectly stated that Topper's light is designed to keep people awake.
*Even though Topper found his one true place atop a Christmas tree, it is unknown what he does during the other seasons.
**It is possible that he stays with the little girl whom he was given to for the rest of the year.
*Topper's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is white.
*His number is a likely reference to Christmas Day ([[December 25]]).
