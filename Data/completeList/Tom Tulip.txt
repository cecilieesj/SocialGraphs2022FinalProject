'''Tom Tulip''' is Chuck and [[Bobby (Hey Vern, It's Ernest!)|Bobby]]'s younger brother in ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]''. They were hoping to take advantage of [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]] by selling him a variety of fake troll traps, but one backfires on [[Mike Murdock|Mike]] and [[Matt Murdock]] who were being mistaken for trolls by Ernest. At that moment, he gets fired from his job as a garbage collector by [[Mayor Murdock]] and [[Cliff Binder]]. Nobody believed him until [[Trantor]], along with other trolls, attacked near [[Francis Hackmore|Old Lady Hackmore]]'s mansion. He was played by John Cadenhead
