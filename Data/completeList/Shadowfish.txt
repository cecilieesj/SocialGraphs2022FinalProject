'''Shadowfish '''are mysterious ghost-like entities that appear in ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
Originating from another world, the Shadowfish were captured and studied for their nigh-impervious durability by the rulers of [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] which led to the creation of an entity known as the "[[The Core|Core]]."

===Physical appearance===
They resemble aquatic and single-celled creatures.

===Powers and abilities===
The Shadowfish can float, phase trough solid objects and have extreme acidic digestion abilities. They can become solid upon seeing their reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces, but will be vulnerable to physical attacks in this form.

==Role in the series==
===Season 2===
They appear in "[[The Sleepover to End All Sleepovers]]", while exploring the basement of [[Newtopia Castle]] Anne, Marcy, Sprig, and Polly encountered the Shadowfish. The children discovered that they are able to be defeated by making them look in the mirrors, transforming them from phantom form to solid, allowing them to hit them, and the shadowfish are forced to flee after enduring many hits.

Near the end of "[[The First Temple]]", they briefly appear roaming the stairwell as [[King Andrias]] goes to meet [[The Core|his master]].

===Season 3===
In "[[Olivia & Yunan]]", when [[Lady Olivia]] and [[General Yunan]] attempt to rescue Marcy the duo  encounter chained-up Moss Man and some Shadowfish roaming in the hallways; Olivia deduces that this was where the newts' ancestors kept their otherworldly prisoners.
