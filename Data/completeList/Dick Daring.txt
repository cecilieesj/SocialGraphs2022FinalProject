{{Quote|LOOK OUT, BELOW!|Dick}}

'''Richard Marion "Dick" Daring''' is the father of [[Todd Daring]] and [[Riley Daring]] and husband of [[Agent K]].

==Appearance==
Dick has Elvis like, jet black hair, black eyes, and fair skin. His outfit appears to be a red, white, and blue suit with a black belt around it that has a golden circle and a yellow star in the middle, along with black heeled boots.

==Background==
He is the siblings' world-famous daredevil adoptive father. He is a semi-former stunt artist, and is constantly working on new tricks. His appearance resembles that of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evel_Knievel Evel Knievel]. He is also rather immature, and is seen having a teddy bear known as "Evel Bearnievel". He thinks that C.A.R. is his best friend, though C.A.R. doesn't see it that way. Dick bought Riley a mule named Prince Cinnamon Boots instead of a horse like she wanted. Like Todd, Dick isn't smart at all. In "[[The Spy That Wasn't Riley]]", we learn that Dick is afraid of clowns and tries to force Todd to be a stunt man instead of a circus clown for his career. In "[[She Works Hard for the Movies]]", we learn that Dick was in a movie back in the 1970s. We also hear Dick sing his first true song; "[[Space Training Montage]]" in "[[Space Family Daring]]". It is also revealed in one episode that he is a better cook than K.
