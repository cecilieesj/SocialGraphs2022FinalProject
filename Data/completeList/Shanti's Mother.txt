'''Shanti's Mother''' is a character who is first mentioned in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1967]] animated feature film, ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' and appears in its [[2003]] sequel, ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Shanti's mother is a warm and caring woman who is very devoted to her family and cares deeply about her daughter. Much like Shanti, she is introverted, sweet and in the song "My Own Home" it is implied that she values work ethics and therefore has raised Shanti to be hard-working and patient. According to Shanti, her mother has grounded her multiple times. Since Shanti herself is generally obedient and respectful of authority, this statement may imply that her mother is somewhat of a disciplinarian.

She is a close friend to Messua and is frequently seen with her and the village leader. She also accompanied her to search for her sons in the jungle, as well as to search for her own daughter.

As with Messua and Ranjan's father, Shanti's mother is aware of Shanti and Mowgli's romantic feelings and is fully supportive of them both.

===Physical appearance===
Shanti's mother bears much physical resemblance to her daughter. She is a beautiful slender woman with olive skin, brown eyes, red bindi on her forehead, golden earrings, thick black eyebrows, and a long black hair covered by a pink headscarf.

In addition to that she wears a traditional Indian sari, colored in pink and with a purple drape wrapped around her waist and shoulder.
