'''Fethry Duck''' is the slightly mixed-up, extremely eccentric cousin of [[Donald Duck]] and a regular supporting character in the ''Donald Duck'' comic book series. Fethry often unwittingly annoys others via his peculiar vision on the world.

==History==
[[File:Fethry2.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Donald and his cousin in the latter's debut, ''The Health Nut''.]]
Fethry was originally created by the [[Disney]] studios, by [[Dick Kinney]] (writer) and Al Hubbard (artist) for a number of stories intended for the European market. Although this makes him an American invention, his first appearance was first printed in the Italian ''Topolino'' #453 in the story "The Health Nut", published on [[August 2]], [[1964]].

His first appearance in the USA was not until [[1966]] in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #304. Only in the early 2000s was Fethry genuinely accepted into the American comic books, whereas he has always been a fairly popular character in Europe (especially Italy) and Brazil.

Since his introduction, Fethry has been a recurring character in ''[[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]]'' and ''Donald Duck'' tales. In his earliest adventures, he supposedly lived in another state (possibly [[New York City]] or [[California]]), and visits via airplane. However, since [[1964]], he has been shown living in [[Duckburg]] on occasions. He is also closely associated with the hillbilly [[Hard Haid Moe]] and Donald's pet cat Tabby, who strongly dislikes Fethry and his antics (though Fethry is always completely oblivious to this).

In the Brazilian Disney comics, Fethry soon became one of the most popular members of the Donald Duck character cast, and he starred in various comics with him as the titular character. Some of these comics gave him a secret identity named "Morcego Vermelho" (The [[Red Bat]]), created by Carlos Edgar Herrero (artist) and possibly Ivan Saidenberg (writer). Fethry's stint as Morcego Vermelho ran in ''Almanaque Disney'', ''Edição Extra'', and a few other Disney comic book series from [[1973]] to [[1990]]. The ''Red Bat'' stories remained a Brazilian phenomenon, but a few stories have made it to Europe, mostly Italy. The Brazilian comics also provide Fethry with a nephew, [[The Duck Family|Dugan]], and a girlfriend, [[Gloria]].

==Appearances==
===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
Fethry made his first animated appearance in the reboot's season two episode "[[The Depths of Cousin Fethry!]]". He works as the caretaker for the McDuck Sublab, and knows a Friendly Krill named Mitzy.

He comes back in the season finale "[[Moonvasion!]]", helping in saving the Earth along with Mitzy, and appears at least once more in the series' finale episode "[[The Last Adventure!]]”, where he attends [[Webby Vanderquack]]‘s birthday party and accidentally slips up the news to Della that [[Donald Duck|Donald]] is going on a worldwide vacation with Daisy.

==Trivia==
*Kinney and Hubbard created this character to be a beatnik (meaning "a person who rejects or avoids conventional behavior") member of the [[:Category:Duck Family|Duck family]].
*Fethry wears different colors of the same sweater depending on which country the story is published in (ex: in Brazil, his sweater is generally yellow; in the Italian comics, he usually wears a red one; and, in the comic books of Egmont Publishing, the traditional color of his sweater is pink). The 2017 version of ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' has him wearing a yellow sweater with a red jacket.
*It is revealed in ''The Health Nut'' that Fethry wears a stocking cap because he was convinced by a self-help book author that one's head is healthier when it's kept hot.
*In [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]], Fethry is a former [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]].
