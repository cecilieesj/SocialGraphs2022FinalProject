He is voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/American-Dragon-Jake-Long/Councilor-Kulde/</ref>.

==History==
Councilor Kulde is the Dragon of Norway and the administer of the Dragon test: Judgment in fire. Like [[Councilor Andam]], he believes [[Jake Long|Jake]] has much potential as a dragon. This most likely stems from the fact that Jake once sacrifices his own victory to save [[Fred Nerk]] when he is captured by the [[The Dark Dragon|Dark Dragon]], even though Jake knows that if he loses he would lose Lao Shi as a teacher. Initially, Kulde's color scheme was mostly just blue, while later it was mostly a pinkish purple.

==Apprentices==
Kulde may have an apprentice or partner, as he is seen doing the fall of faith with a young orange dragon<ref>[[Keeping Shop]]</ref>. Other dragons also did this with their partners or apprentices. Lao Shi did it with Jake.

==Episode Appearances==
===Season One===
*"[[Dragon Summit]]" (first appearance)
*"[[The Halloween Bash]]"
===Season Two===
*"[[Being Human]]"
*"[[The Hong Kong Longs]]" (final appearance)

==Trivia==
*"Kulde" means cold in Norwegian.
*Kulde breathes ice instead of fire.
