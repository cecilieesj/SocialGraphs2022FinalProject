==Development==
Roland was created by Brandon Seifert and his name is a tribute to the concept designer of the Museum of the Weird, [[Rolly Crump]].

==Background==
Little is known of the background of Roland Keep. His own niece and nephew had never been introduced to him prior to the night of their parents' kidnapping. He claims to be a Warden and seems to know an exceptional amount about the Museum of the Weird, and the Shadow Society.

==Abilities==
Roland Keep in his debut is shown to be an expert at fighting with magical items, proficient with a sword, and very knowledgeable of the mission of the Wardens. Since losing his legs in a mystical fire, he has been the brains behind [[Maxwell Keep|Max]] and [[Melody Keep|Melody]]'s mission to find the [[Grandfather Coffin Clock|Coffin Clock]].
