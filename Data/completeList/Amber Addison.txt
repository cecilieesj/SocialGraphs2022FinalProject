'''Amber Addison''' is a bully from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' at Seaview High who's in [[Miley Stewart|Miley]], [[Lilly Truscott|Lilly]] and [[Oliver Oken|Oliver's]] grade.

She is the main antagonist of the first season and a minor character in the other three.

==History==
Amber and her best friend, Ashley DeWitt, are one dimensional characters for the most part (or at least Ashley is). Of the two girls, Amber's the more dominant and intelligent one of the two, and she also has a much better singing voice than Ashley. Both girls are shown to be huge fans of Hannah Montana.

It is eventually revealed that up until she started middle school, Amber used to be "the geeky kid with the glasses" who everyone bullied, which is her most embarrassing secret (that even Ashley doesn't know, even though she's supposed Amber's best friend). From that, it can be assumed that Amber's mean and sour disposition probably stems from her getting bullied all the time as a kid.
