==Role in the [[Gargoyles|series]]==
When Beth's older sister, Elisa, was shot, Beth was in Flagstaff, Arizona, attending school. Her family was unsure whether or not she would need to fly out to [[Manhattan]] to see her ailing sister. It seems she did not return to [[New York City]] because Elisa made a full recovery. She did, however, come out to visit shortly after the disappearance of her brother, [[Derek Maza]]. She was enjoying her sister's cooking when she noticed a winged figure at the window of Elisa's top-story apartment. Elisa made a joke, distracting Beth and their parents, returning the conversation to a jovial tone.

When Elisa was "enjoying" her Avalon World Tour, one of her stops was at Flagstaff University, where Beth was studying her Native American cultural heritage. With Elisa, [[Angela]], and [[Goliath]], Beth helped put a stop to [[David Xanatos]]' construction that threatened to destroy a site honoring Coyote the Trickster, which proved part of a scheme to capture the [[Child of Oberon]] to force him to grant the billionaire immortality.

==Trivia==
*Beth fully appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Gargoyles'' before she did on the [[Gargoyles|television series]].
