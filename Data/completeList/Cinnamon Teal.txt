==Appearances==
===''[[DuckTales]]''===
Cinnamon is a female spy who appeared in the ''DuckTales'' episode "[[Spies in Their Eyes]]", where she hypnotized [[Donald Duck]] into stealing a computer link from the Navy's secret sub. After Victor Loser betrayed her, she helped [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|nephews]] prove that Donald was innocent.

===Boom! Studios comics===
In the 2011 ''[[DuckTales (Boom! Studios)|DuckTales]]'' comic book by [[Boom! Studios]], Cinnamon, now apparently a criminal again, appears in the "Rightful Owners" arc. She assists [[John D. Rockerduck]] to win a bet he made with [[Scrooge McDuck]] on who is [[Duckburg]]'s biggest philanthropist. She hypnotizes [[Gladstone Gander]] (who is now named Agent X) so Rockerduck can have his luck on his side and win the bet with it. Gladstone is well known about his unpredictable and unimaginable luck, so John D. Rockerduck is more than sure that he will win the bet, but Cinnamon has other plans, as her powers grow as she says that soon she won't have any need for Rockerduck.

Cinnamon reappears in the ''DuckTales''/''Darkwing Duck'' crossover story "[[Dangerous Currency]]", where she is a member of the "League of Eve-il" along with [[Magica De Spell]], [[Ammonia Pine]], and [[Camille Chameleon]]. They form an alliance with the [[Phantom Blot]], the Fearsome Four, and the [[Beagle Boys]]. After [[Negaduck]] is revealed to be the source of the slime/ink contaminating St. Canard, the villains all fuse with him. This ultimately proves to be a bad move, though; when Slime Negaduck is banished back to the Wasteland at the end of the story, he ends up taking all the other villains with him. It should be noted, however, that "Dangerous Currency" was never approved by Disney and is not considered canon (this likely applies to "Rightful Owners" as well).

*She shares a name with a species of duck called the "Cinnamon Teal", although she bears no resemblance to the usually brown-feathered bird.
