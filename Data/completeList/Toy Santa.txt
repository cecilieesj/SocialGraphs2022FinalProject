'''Toy Santa''' is [[Scott Calvin]]'s toy replacement double that eventually becomes the main antagonist of ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]''.

== Role in the film ==
Toy Santa is created by [[Curtis (Santa Clause)|Curtis]]' duplicating machine, against Bernard's wishes, and appears as just a life-sized toy. Shortly afterwards, when [[Scott Calvin|Scott]], Curtis, and [[Bernard (Santa Clause)|Bernard]] filled him in on what to do as [[Santa Claus]], he became accustomed of his job. Initially, although he has an edge compared to Scott, he seems to be doing okay. However, he finds himself following the rules in the handbook too strictly, and insists on re-checking the naughty-nice list twice. Bernard insists that the naughty-nice list has already been checked twice by Scott so he does not need to worry about it. However, after refusing to listen, Toy Santa, having no sense of grace, slack or mercy in his plastic heart, deems all children are naughty, because of their minor infractions of rules. Curtis and Bernard try to explain to him that he is holding children to unreasonably high standards, especially at Christmas time, but it falls on deaf ears.

Toy Santa creates a toy soldier, enlarges it with the machine, and makes a whole army of them. He becomes a dictator and tells everyone not to make any more toys and to give every child coal. Bernard has had enough, and exposes Toy Santa as a fraud, and desperately pleads that the elves not listen him or allow him to ruin Christmas, but the toy soldiers incapacitate him, and Toy Santa places him under house arrest. Then, he and his soldiers dump coal on the conveyor belts. Curtis manages to escape to Earth and tells Scott everything. Later, the two return to the [[North Pole]], but Toy Santa has a soldier tie them up with a ribbon and sets out. During the final battle, Scott and Chet pursue him to keep him from leaving. Eventually, after they crash, he is taken by the elves and ended up being "reduced" at the machine.

In the closing credits, Toy Santa ends up being small and is teaching other small Santas how to dance.

== Trivia ==
* During the final battle, he says "You're a sad strange little man" to Scott, which is an obvious reference to ''[[Toy Story]]''. [[Buzz Lightyear]], also portrayed by Tim Allen, also says the line during the scene where he and [[Woody]] are arguing at the [[Dinoco]] gas station after noticing that [[Andy Davis|Andy]] left them behind. Another indirect reference is when Bernard declares that the Toy Santa is a toy, similar to how Woody exclaimed to Buzz that he was a toy in that same scene.
