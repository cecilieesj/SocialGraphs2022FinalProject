==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
Bayard plays a somewhat minor part in the film. He is first seen at the [[Red Queen]]'s castle being held back by the guards as he is told by [[The Knave of Hearts]] to find the scent of a human girl and that if he did so, his wife and pups along with everyone else would go free; although this was a lie Bayard failed to look past, for he agreed and followed Alice's scent to [[Tarrant Hightopp|The Mad Hatter]]'s, [[Thackery Earwicket|The March Hare]], and [[Mallymkun|The Dormouse]]'s tea party. Scenting Alice in the teapot Hatter has hidden her in, Bayard growls at the Hatter, who tells him, 'Down with Bloody Big Head'. At this, Bayard turns away and leads the Knave of Hearts in a different direction.

Bayard is later on seen with Alice and taking her to the Red Queen's castle and then back later on as he follows Alice, who is then riding the [[Bandersnatch]], back to the [[White Queen]]'s castle. Then, Bayard is briefly seen looking through a telescope and at his returning wife, [[Bielle]] and their four pups. At the end of the film during the battle, he is seen with the Dormouse on his back as they are cornered by [[The Jub Jub Bird]], whose head is soon crushed by a falling boulder and Bayard and the Dormouse manage to escape.

===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===
Bayard and the rest of Alice's friends return in this film when Alice arrived back at Underland, where it is explained that Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter, is in risk of dying. During the conversation, Bayard shares his story of him investigating in the Tulgey Woods to investigate something strange to which he and Thackery felt sad when he notices a small paper hat to remind him of his family lost during the Horunvendish Day event. When Alice returns and reports the sad news about the Hatter, Bayard and the rest of Alice's friends react in worry and fear that they would lose their best friend if he dies. Alice is then tasked to travel back in time to find the Hatter's missing family and save his life before he dies to which Alice and her friends travel to Time's Castle to help save the Hatter who is in the risk of dying by using a Chronosphere to travel to the past Horunvendush Day event and save the Hatter's family from death before it is too late, just as Alice's friends wish her good luck in helping save the Hatter.

As the lapse in Underland becomes disastrous due to Alice taking the Chronosphere, Thackery and the rest of Alice's friends react in shock due to Alice taking the Chronosphere from the Grand Clock of All Time as the White Queen hopes Alice returns in time.

A past version of Bayard appears amongst the crowd during the Toomalie Day event, where she and the rest of the crowd felt worried about the failed coronation of Iracebeth. A puppy version of Bayard also appears in the past Fell Day event playing with a kitten version of Chessur.

In the present, Bayard and the rest of Alice's friends are gathered near Tarrant lying in his bed gazing at the Hatter who is in the risk of dying just as he and the rest of Alice's friends mournfully leave as the Hatter's hair becomes completely white. Alice manages to save the Hatter from dying when she talks about his missing family still alive just as the Hatter happily wakes up.

After the Hatter is brought back to life and Alice makes a plan to find his missing family, Bayard and the rest of Alice's friends arrive at the Red Queen's castle to find the Hatter's family to make him feel happy. Upon arriving, they end up getting jailed by the Red Queen in a jail made of vegetables, much to the Red Queen's notorious plans. Ultimately, a vegetable woman frees them from the jail cell, freeing Alice and her friends in a plan to return to take Time back to his castle and retrieve the Chronosphere to save Underland before it perishes. As the lapse continues to become disastrous in Underland, Mally and the rest of Alice's friends bring Time back to his castle just as Wilkins says that only the Chronosphere can stop this disaster. Bayard and the rest of Alice's friends end up getting engulfed by time rust along with everyone in Underland. With the Chronosphere back in place, Bayard is brought back to life along with everyone caught in time rust. Alice then leaves Underland just as Bayard watches Alice returning to the real world alongside the rest of Alice's friends.

==Trivia==
*At one point in the sequel, ''Alice Through the Looking Glass'', during the scene where Alice and her friends are trying to find Tarrant's family, Bayard can be heard shouting "Zoinks!" while he, Mally, and Thackery attempt to open a room only for the three to fall. According to the sequel's director, [[James Bobin]], "Zoinks" did not originate from the Victorian English language or from Lewis Carroll's works; instead, it originated from the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise, which is Shaggy Rogers' catchphrase.<ref>''Alice Through the Looking Glass'' Audio Commentary (Blu-ray).</ref>
**Coincidentally, Bobin, himself is a fan of the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise.
