'''Bill''' is a tree hugger in ''[[Dog With a Blog]]''. He is portrayed by Brendan Hunt.

==Background==
===Biography===
After an argument with Chloe, Tyler, and Avery, Stan runs away. During his hike, he met Bill, a tree hugger, who he thought he would be his new owner. When Bill did not find his name tag, he decided to name him Doris Steinberg, then change it to Morris Steinberg.

Bill poses as a stereotype hippy. He loves trees to the point of hugging them, he even tell Stan a "secret" that the trees like it, he even likes tickling trees more than hugging them.

After making a bad choice, Stan attempts to go back to his family until Bill wraps a rope around him like a leash. Bill planned to hike to his car, drive to Santa Fe, then to Washington D.C. so I can scream at the Washington monument, "What do you have to do with George Washington? You look nothing like him!", then he and Stan will get a hot dog.

At the end, Avery and Tyler found him, Bill stated it was for the best, he stated when he got to New Mexico to check out the space museum, and he would of put him in the kennel.
