'''Captain Cleaver''' is a deleted character from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. He's a tough, gruff [[Toon]] human police captain from [[Toontown (Who Framed Roger Rabbit)|Toontown]] and the head of the T.P.D. Homicide Division.

Cleaver is very combative with [[Eddie Valiant]] in terms of who's going to solve the [[Marvin Acme|Acme]] case. One can only imagine what sort of twists a Toon human in an angry and confronted match over jurisdiction would have generated, and it's not only a good example of why this film works, but also why people have always wanted a sequel.

In the screen tests, he was voiced by [[Jack Angel]].

He is based on Captain Cleaver from the novel ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?''.

==Quotes==
*(Pulling out his gun and poking Valiant) “Get off the [[Roger Rabbit]] case. I got [[Jessica Rabbit|the Wife]] pegged as the killer, and I’m an inch away from proving it. You keep poking around you’re liable to screw up my play...and that would make me ''very'' unhappy.”
