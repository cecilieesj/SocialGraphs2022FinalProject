'''Budderball''' is a golden retriever puppy who appears, along with his siblings, in the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' film series]].

==History==
Budderball is the chubbiest and presumably the oldest of the Buddies. He enjoys eating and wears black ink on his face to look like a football player. In addition, he also sports a red football shirt. When his paw is pulled, he passes unbearable gas. Because he is best known for being a glutton, this sometimes causes his younger siblings and himself to wind up in trouble. He also got on [[Santa Paws]]' naughty list for eating the family's Thanksgiving turkey, but was eventually taken off. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Bartleby Livingston, a rich but lonely boy who was seemingly a bully at first, though all he truly wanted was a friend, which is why Budderball decided to stay with him.

==Trivia==
*Usually, Budderball passes gas when his paw is pulled, but there are times he does it by himself.
**In an outtake of ''[[Snow Buddies]]'', he farts by himself and claims it was a chili cheese dog he had for lunch.
**In ''[[Spooky Buddies]]'', after Budderball eats pickled eyeballs, [[B-Dawg]] signals him to fart on the [[Halloween Hound]] before he can suck out Budderball's soul.
**In ''[[Treasure Buddies]]'', he farts by himself after eating dynamite explosives when he mistook them for stinky cheese.
*He is very similar to [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'', [[Broadway]] from ''[[Gargoyles]]'', [[Rolly]] from the ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'' franchise, and [[Circus Bugs#Heimlich|Heimlich]] from ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', as all five love food and have gluttonous appetites.
*He is also very similar to [[Pumbaa]] from [[The Lion King (franchise)|''The Lion King'' franchise]] in that they both have farting problems.
