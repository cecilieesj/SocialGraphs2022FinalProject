'''Henry Casey''' is a friend of [[Jack Conroy]] in ''[[White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf]]''. He lives and bonds together with [[White Fang (character)|White Fang]]. He was the one seen by Lily, child of Moses. His love interest is Lily.

He gave Lily a white cloth when he returned into the tribe. Lily taught him how to use his bow. He was the one who planted the dynamite into the rocks that blocks the path of the animals. He also dreamed what Moses dreamed about, White Fang, Lily, but in that dream, also him.

==Trivia==
* The scene where Henry Casey falls into a river and down a waterfall is based off John Thornton falling into a river and drifting down the current from ''The Call of the Wild'', another novel written by Jack London.
