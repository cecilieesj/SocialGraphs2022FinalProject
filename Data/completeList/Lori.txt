'''Lori''' is a ''[[Fillmore!]]'' character and an X Middle School student. She is voiced by Shanie Calahan.<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Lori/</ref>

==Personality==
Lori seems like the type to lose her cool and become irritated if something gets in the way of her favorite activity, which is meditation exercises. Therefore, it can be speculated that normally, she may be relaxed and mellow most of the time, unless there's something that spoils her mood, then that all changes.

==Physical Appearance ==
She's a teen, caucasian girl with shoulder-length blonde hair and green eyes. Her apparel includes a pink bandana, a medium slate blue tank top with a small, white V-collar, a long, olive green skirt, and brown sandals.

==A Wurm In Our Midst==

She seems to be a hippie. In "A Wurm in Our Midst", after her meditation session is interrupted by Tony Clementina as he's passing through it while being followed by [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]], irritably she says, "Excuse me, we're meditating here!" Tony then tells her, "Excuse yourself, sister", before taking off once again.
