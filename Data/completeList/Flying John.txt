He tires of his wife [[Killjoy Margaret]]'s bossiness and over-pampering of her dog [[Foo-Foo]] and he just wants to have fun with his life. He is inspired by and named for John Culhane, the same as [[Mr. Snoops]] from ''[[The Rescuers]]''.



==Personality==
Unlike his boss Margaret who is overbearing, John is very fun-loving, vivacious, and childish, playing with a road-side monkey and imagining himself having all sorts of fun. But due to working for Margaret, he is quite miserable as he never gets to enjoy what he wants to do and instead has to give into her commands. At the end of the segment, he is overjoyed and ecstatic, so he dances with some showgirls during [[Duke (Fantasia 2000)|Duke]]'s Jazz debut.

==Appearances==
===Fantasia 2000===
John first appears leaving an upper-class apartment building with his wife, [[Killjoy Margaret]], and their dog, Foo-Foo. He starts playing on a hopscotch board that two kids have drawn on the sidewalk but stops when  his wife glares at him.

Later, they pass an organ grinder with a monkey. John stops to plays with the monkey, copying his movements and dancing with him.  [[Killjoy Margaret|Margaret]] angrily pulls him away and he reluctantly follows her into the pet shop, Le Pampered Pooch. Inside, John balances a toy bone on his nose but soon finds himself laden down with all of the items that his wife picks out for Foo-Foo as she tosses them to him. Putting them aside, John goes over to the window and watches the skaters at Rockefeller Center while fantasizing about what it would be like if he were free to do whatever he wanted. He is soon pulled out of his happy daydream by the pet store employee who gives him the bill which is several pages long, much to his annoyance. 

Towards the end of the segment, John is forced to carry all of [[Killjoy Margaret|Margaret's]] purchases as they walk home. As they pass by the construction yard, [[Killjoy Margaret|Margaret]] is accidentally snagged on a hook by [[Joe (Fantasia)|Joe]] and lifted into the air. John briefly wonders where she went before spotting a poster promoting a talent night at a jazz club.

At the end of the segment, John is shown happily dancing in a with some girls in the the club's chorus line.
