'''Miss Ringwald''' (Senorita Ringwald, but dubbed "Dory" in Latin Spanish) is the poetry teacher of [[Norrisville High]] and she is voiced by [[Annie Potts]].

==History==
She appeared in the episode "[[Stank'd to the Future]]". Her prom date was [[Dickie]] (back in 1985). Her first name is Mary Elizabeth, but people tend to call her "Tawny". As a teenager, she was going to the prom with Dickie, but he stood her up (in reality he was [[Stank|stanked]] by [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]] and frozen by [[Mac Antfee]], the ninja of 1985). Years later, she was still heartbroken over his disappearance, brought to tears just by his memory. But when Dickie was unfrozen and de-stanked, the second time, by her presence, and brought to his normal age, the two re-united and continued their relationship.

==Trivia==
*She was seen crying at the beginning of "Stank'd to the Future", yet she didn't get stanked by the Sorcerer, which is odd.
*The question as to how she got her nickname, Tawny, is unknown as pointed out by Randy.
*Her first name is Mary Elizabeth.
*Her Voice Actress Annie Potts voiced [[Bo Peep]] from ''[[Toy Story]]''.
