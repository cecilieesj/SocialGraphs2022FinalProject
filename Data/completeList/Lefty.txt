Lefty first appears when Lewis accidentally rings the doorbell, later When [[Bud Robinson]] shows [[Lewis Robinson]] around in the future, they come across Lefty again, who opens the door. Lewis thinks that he's a monster until Bud clears things up. Bud then asks Lefty where to get to the garage, so Lefty suggests asking [[Franny Robinson]].
