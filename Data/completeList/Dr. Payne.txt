==History==
His first appearance is in an episode where Trudy takes the kids to the doctor, and his second is when Trudy and [[Sunset Boulevardez|Sunset]] take [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] and [[Felix Boulevardez|Felix]] to a day spa, and the two men think they are going to be with a nurse with a very voluptuous figure, but they end up with Dr. Payne and his third is when he helps [[Suga Mama]] get back in shape a week before she marries [[Clarence Saint-John|Clarence]]. His fourth is when he helped Oscar with his injuries after a hard day at the zoo. His fifth when he tried to cure a wrestler named Mongo after eating some Proud Snax. His sixth is when he helped Penny and Oscar after suffering some accidents and helped Suga Mama with her vision problem. His seventh is when he was treating Penny and her friends, who later fell ill after they tested Proud Snax, until Suga Mama was able to cure them with her own snacks, Get Up And Go Bars.

His appeared in the [[The Proud Family Movie|2005 movie]], where he made some non-speaking cameos.

He returned in ''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder|Louder and Prouder]]'' in the episode "[[Bad Influence(r)]]", where, upon seeing Penny's passive-aggressive social media post about Suga Mama, he forcefully takes her to fat camp.

Despite his name, and his giant figure, he is a good doctor, and does treat his patients with the care they need. All his house calls are expensive, especially for Oscar. He also seems to use very violent methods when treating Oscar that no one else seems to ever have gotten. Unlike Oscar however, he treats Suga Mama with great respect and calls her "Suga Bear". He even refers Penny as "Itty-Bitty". Hence, he tells Oscar to respect his "sweet little Suga Mama".

==Trivia==
*Dr. Payne is the only doctor the Proud family's HMO had to pay for, but it was the best they could do.
*His name is a pun to "pain"
*Dr Payne seems to like Suga Mama more then Oscar.
*The way he talks is an obvious reference to [[Mr. T]].
