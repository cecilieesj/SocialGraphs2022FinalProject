}}'''Fanny the Goose '''(born '''Fanny Coot''') is the mother ofÂ [[Donald Duck]]'s cousin [[Gus Goose]]. She was first mentioned in the Donald Duck comic strip of May 9, [[1938]] by [[Bob Karp]] and [[Al Taliaferro]], where Gus first appeared. This comic was an adaptation of the animated short ''[[Donald's Cousin Gus]]'', which Gus' mother was also mentioned. Her surname wasn't revealed in both media, where she identifies herself in a letter to Donald as '''Aunt Fanny''', implying that she was originally meant to be a sister of one of Donald's parents. When Carl Barks created his Duck family tree for personal use in the 1950s, he included Gus as a nephew of [[Luke the Goose]], making him a distant "cousin" of Donald's. In Mark Worden's illustrated version of Barks' first tree, Gus' unnamed mother appeared on a portrait.

However, when Carl Barks drew a new tree in the 1990s, he included Fanny as [[Grandma Duck]]'s daughter and Donald's father [[Quackmore Duck]]'s sister.

In Don Rosa's 1993 ''Duck Family Tree'', she is featured as a daughter of Casey Coot and his wife Gretchen Grebe, and therefore a niece of Grandma Duck, and first cousin of Donald's father. According to this same tree, Fanny married [[Luke the Goose]], and then became the mother of Gus Goose. On this tree, Fanny was placed as the sister of [[Cuthbert Coot]], Donald's cousin from the [[Carl Barks]] comic <nowiki/>''Donald Learns the Ropes''<nowiki/>.

Aunt Fanny and her husband made a brief cameo appearance in ''[[Dangerous Currency]] ''(2011).

For Gus Goose's 80th anniversary in 2019, Fanny and her husband appeared in two new comics: ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=H+2019-162 Hoe Gijs bij Oma Duck Kwam]'' (a short prequel story that tells how Gus came to live with Grandma Duck) and ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=H+2019-175 The Birthday Party]'', where she appears in a sequence about Gus' childhood.
