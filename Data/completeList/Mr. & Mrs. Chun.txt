They are the Plummers' next door neighbors and North Korean spies who are after Howard's GHOST program.

==Role in the film==
The Chuns are first seen reprimanding Shane for not keeping the Plummer kids under control, as well as for a troll doll they found in their pool filter. Then, after Shane tries to stop Helga from leaving, to no avail, Mrs. Chun reassures him that she'll come back.

On Monday night, the Chuns, dressed as ninjas, break into the Plummers' house to get their hands on the GHOST, but are fought off by Shane. This leads the kids to realize there are people who mean them harm, and they begin to warm up to Shane, who, in turn, realizes they've been getting off on the wrong foot. 

As Shane talks with [[Captain Bill Fawcett]] about his future, considering that the time he spent with the kids has brought out his more caring side, they are confronted by the Chuns, armed with guns, who demand the two-pronged key that Bill and [[Julie Plummer|Julie]] acquired in Zurich. Shane promptly disarms them before being knocked out by Bill. Bill then binds and gags Lulu, Seth, and Zoe, leaving Mr. Chun to keep an eye on them, while he, Mrs. Chun, and Julie go down to the vault. Unfortunately, Mrs. Chun gets her eyebrows singed by flamethrowers upon entering.

Meanwhile, Lulu manages to distract Mr. Chun by crossing her eyes when Tyler looks at her, which always upsets him. While he is distracted, Lulu, Seth, and Zoe untie themselves, and Zoe tells Peter to spray his juice drink in Mr. Chun's face; as he recoils, Zoe trips him, Seth kicks him in the back, and Lulu kicks him in the groin. Then they lock him in the nursery. He tries to unlock the door, before Seth sprays him and bashes him in the face with a fire extinguisher. After reviving Shane in the garage, the kids use the minivan to go get the authorities. Mr. Chun gets out of the nursery and takes the black Ford Bill and Julie used to get to the house to go after them. In the ensuing car chase, Zoe rams his car, making him turn so it is facing and being pushed backwards by their car. He then attempts to shoot them, but Seth throws a diaper on his windshield, causing him to drive through a car dealership and crash. 

Shane gets to the vault as Bill threatens to shoot Julie if she doesn't open it and he promises to help him do so in return for sparing the family. Using the "Peter Panda dance" to overcome the numerous booby traps, Shane reaches the vault. A fight breaks out between him, Julie, Bill, and Mrs. Chun, ending with Shane opening the vault using the words "Say goodnight, Peter Panda," knocking Bill out with its door just as he is about to shoot him, and Julie punching Mrs. Chun. 

Mr. Chun returns armed with a machine gun just as the police are holding Shane and the Plummers at gunpoint. He orders them to put their guns down, and demands the GHOST. Shane puts it down at his feet and then quietly tells Gary to attack his balls, which he does. [[Claire Fletcher]] then leaps on and subdues him. The police and FBI then arrest Bill and the Chuns.
