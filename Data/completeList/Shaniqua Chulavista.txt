==Background==
Shaniqua is a very popular singing sensation amongst teenagers. Her latest hit is titled ''Baby, Don't Be Frontin'''.<ref name="tooth">[[The Legend of Dragon Tooth]]</ref> She is the main attraction of NYC's 3rd Annual Hip-Hop Video Awards, and plays at the ceremony's finale. Her song is even broadcast on several TV screens in the streets of [[New York City]].

===Personality===
From what is shown in the show, Shaniqua is an all-around cool woman. She enjoys her time onstage as well as her fans, whomever they may be. Even the over-exaggerated enthusiasm of her fans do not affect her mood. She's always seen with a smile on her face.

After her concert, Shaniqua somehow meets [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]] and [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]] and gives them a ride home in her limo, acting friendly with them and offering champagne.

===Physical appearance===
Shaniqua is a brown-skinned woman with long black hair. Her popstar outfit is consisted of a pink midriff-baring shirt with loose sleeves and a pair of blue jean shorts. She also wears white knee-high boots with pink straps, two bracelets on her right wrist, two large earrings, and a necklace.
