==Role in the film==
Jenny had just relocated from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to Salem, [[Massachusetts]] with her family. On Halloween, she and Dave go to a party. While they're there, Max takes Dani to the [[Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|Sanderson sisters' cottage]], where he accidentally resurrects them. Horrified, he and Dani go to the party where they try to warn Dave and Jenny. Even though the [[Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]] have stalked them to there, so that Max can prove his mistakes, nobody buys it. The sisters, especially [[Winifred Sanderson|Winifred]], give a spellbinding performance, but in reality cast a bewitchment upon the party guests to make them continuously dance until they should die. Dave and Jenny are both victims of the spell. 

At 5am, Max goes to see Dave and Jenny, but he becomes alarmed when he realizes that they still aren't back. This is because they are still under the sisters' spell, and the sisters aren't gone, even though Max attempted to burn them in the school's pottery kiln. At sunrise, they turn to dust, and their spell is broken. An exhausted Dave and Jenny return home.
