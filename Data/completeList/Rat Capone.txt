'''Rat Capone''' is a character from the animated series ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. He is the leader of a gang, which includes a muscular mouse ([[Arnold Mousenegger and Sugar Ray Lizard|Arnold Mousenegger]]) and a lizard ([[Arnold Mousenegger and Sugar Ray Lizard|Sugar Ray Lizard]]).

==Appearance==
Capone is an obese rat who wears purple gangster clothes and a black hat. He bares a strong resemblance to Francis, the leader of the [[Spy Rats]] from the episode "[[Double 'O Chipmunk]]".

==Role in Series==
The two crimes the Rescue Rangers cartoon describe are his illegal handling of the cheese within the Rangers' city, and his stealing gold, which he had once tried to build a gold castle, but the Rescue Rangers prevented him from doing so. He appears in the episodes "[[Mind Your Cheese and Q's]]" and "[[The S.S. Drainpipe]]". He has a particular fascination with [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]], whom he constantly tries to make his moll, despite her resistance and spunk, which he hates to no end.

==Trivia==
*Though "The S.S. Drainpipe" is usually listed before "Mind Your Cheese and Q's" on most episode lists, "Mind Your Cheese and Q's" is actually first chronologically because that is when the rangers first come across Capone and his gang. In "The S.S. Drainpipe", both groups remember meeting each other.Â 
*Rat Capone was named after an American gangster Al Capone.
*Capone's appearance, voice, and mannerisms are based on character actor Edward G. Robinson who was famous for playing gangsters in movies like "Little Cesar" (1931) and "Key Largo" (1948.) Robinson was also the inspiration for the villain Big Boss in the DiC animated series "C.O.P.S"
