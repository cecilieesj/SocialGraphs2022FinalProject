|quote = "All we need...is a champion."}}'''Mirana of Marmoreal''', also known as the '''White Queen''', is a fictional character from the novel ''[[Wikipedia:Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by Lewis Carroll. She is based upon the chess piece of the same name and appears as the tritagonist of [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2010]] movie ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and the deuteragonist of its sequel, ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''. She is also the younger sister of the [[Red Queen]].

===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
The White Queen appeared in the [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2010]] film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. Her given name in the film is Mirana of Marmoreal. She is stated to be the rightful ruler of [[Underland]], but her eldest sister Iracebeth, the [[Red Queen]], usurped and claimed the crown as her own. The film makes no reference to a White King, and as such it is likely this version of the White Queen is unmarried and rules alone. It is interesting to note that she is able to complete the potion that allows Alice to shrink by spewing in her own "Wishful Thinking" for the final installment of the needed ingredient. When she moves, she does so gracefully, giving the illusion that she is perpetually dancing. In [[The Mad Hatter|Tarrant]]'s flashback, she was at Witzend village when the [[Jabberwocky (2010)|Jabberwocky]] burned it down. She was led out of the village, but lost her crown out of confusion. She is later seen when [[Bayard]] comes to tell her that [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]] is at the Red Queen's castle at Salazen Grum. She forgives him as Alice will also find the [[Vorpal Sword|Vorpal sword]]. When Alice goes to Marmoreal on the [[Bandersnatch]], she hands over Mirana the Vorpal sword, which is now with the armor. Since Alice is too big, she makes Pishsalver with disgusting ingredients. After Alice drinks it, she becomes the right size. She is then at the chessboard-like battlefield with her army when she gives Iracebeth one more chance for peace, but she declines. Mirana then set forth her chosen champion Alice to battle the Jabberwocky. After Alice slays the Jabberwocky, she reclaims her crown and banishes Iracebeth and the Knave to the [[Outlands]].

===''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''===
The White Queen returns in the sequel with Anne Hathaway reprising her role.

The White Queen is present in a conversation with Alice's friends in Underland. When Alice notices something wrong with the Hatter who is in the risk of dying, she and the rest of Alice's friends escort her to [[Time]]'s castle where she is tasked to find the Chronosphere and travel back in time to find evidence of the Hatter's family. Later when all of Underland starts perishing, the White Queen and the rest of Alice's friends notice of what Alice has done, just as the White Queen wishes her good luck.

As Alice travels to the past Toomalie Day event, she encounters a past version of Mirana who is crowned as Princess, much to Iracebeth being unfit to be ruler under King Oleron's command as she seeks revenge on the citizens. Princess Mirana later talks to Tarrant's father explaining that all of Witzend laments the day of her sister's incident, giving the present Alice evidence that if this evidence never happened, the Hatter would be saved.

As Alice travels to the past Fell Day event, younger versions of Mirana and Iracebeth are at their home disagreeing with each other just as their mother warns that they will not receive anymore tarts if they argue with each other. Young Mirana later grabs the last tart without letting her mother notice her just as she denies of what she is doing with the last tart she ate, hiding the crumbs under her bed. Later as Iracebeth and Mirana's mother arrives, she tells Mirana to tell the truth about what she did bad to which she denies that she wasn't the one, causing her sister Iracebeth to be punished just as Mirana stares on the floor by her bed.

At the present, the White Queen is seen amongst Alice's friends gazing upon the Hatter in the risk of dying. However, as the Mad Hatter is revived after Alice believes in him, the White Queen follows alongside Alice to help the Hatter find his missing family at the Red Queen's castle. Later, the Red Queen takes her sister to the past Fell Day event just as the two queens stare at the younger versions of themselves being scolded by their mother Queen Elsemere. She later notices the present Red Queen being turned into rust, followed by the past version of herself and Queen Elsemere the latter being turned into rust.

When Alice and the Hatter find the [[Chronosphere]], Mirana and her sister (who was turned into rust) board the Chronosphere and travel through the Ocean of Time back to Time's castle as the time rust continues engulfing across Underland.

As Alice, the Hatter, the White Queen, and the Red Queen travel to Time's castle, the time rust continues spreading across Time's castle as the White Queen and the rest of Alice's friends are turned into rust as the rust continues spreading across the universe. As Alice manages to return the Chronosphere back in place to restore Underland, Mirana is restored back to life along with everyone in Underland. Later, Mirana recaps her past flashback of what she did to Iracebeth as a child, apologizing to her for lying just as she and her sister get along.

During the credits, the White Queen and the Red Queen are seen in 2D animation as she and her sister get into a fight over her crown to which Mirana retrieves it. She later appears attending the tea party during the credits along with the other residents of Underland.

===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===
In this show, the White Queen is the good persona of the ex-[[Red Queen|Red Queen Anastasia]]. Alice mentions her, when reading to her daughter.

==Trivia==
*The White Queen in this film is almost different from the way the author Lewis Carroll originally envisioned her. Originally, she was pictured as "sweet, gentle, fat, and stupid" yet still endowed with a queenly dignity; in short almost like a slightly doddering fairy godmother.
*In the book she appears in, ''Through the Looking-Glass'', there was no indication she was related to the Red Queen, although at least one of the pawns in her chess army was her youngest daughter, Lily (who did not appear in the Disney film).
*Her actress, [[Anne Hathaway]], was offered the part of Alice, but she turned it down because it was too similar to previous roles she played.
