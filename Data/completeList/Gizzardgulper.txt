The "'''Gizzardgulper'''" is one of the nine man-eating giants that live in Giant Country. He is burly with a beard and wears a helmet. The Gizzardgulper is also the only man-eating giant to wear long pants rather than a cloth or shorts and is shorter than the rest of the tribe, standing 39 feet tall. He is the "jock" of the group.

He, along with the [[Fleshlumpeater]], [[Bloodbottler]], [[Meatdripper]], [[Manhugger]], [[Maidmasher]], [[Bonecruncher]], [[Childchewer]], and [[Butcherboy|Butcher Boy]] enjoy snatching and gobbling up little children at night while [[The BFG (character)|The BFG]] delivers dreams to the children.
