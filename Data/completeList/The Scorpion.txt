'''The Scorpion''' is the sole antagonist of ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''. It is a tiny red one living in the Szalinskis' backyard. Though small, it was huge when the kids were shrunk to 1/4 of an inch tall.

==Role in the film==
When the Szalinski kids, joined by the shrunken Thompson ones, climb inside a [[LEGO]] brick to sleep for the night, they didn't know they were in the scorpion's territory. It didn't take long for it to notice them and approach. When it found out that prey was mere steps away, it attacked. The kids quickly ran away, but it blocked [[Ron Thompson]], intending to make him a meal. It knew the others were getting away, but didn't follow. They were far away and Ron was an easier meal. He snuck deep into the LEGO piece and the scorpion stuck a claw in and snapped at him, trying to catch him. At the same time, [[Antie]], an ant that the kids had befriended earlier, heard the commotion and returned to the scene.

As the scorpion was about to grab Ron, [[Russ Thompson, Jr.]] returned with a flaming torch and threw it at its tough armor. It turned around for a brief moment, but turned back to Ron when he got out of the LEGO. It approached the helpless kid and was about to eat him when Antie approached it and bit its leg. This infuriated it, who turned its attention to him. It released its rage on him, trying to grab and sting him, but he was too fast. It didn't care, he just wanted him dead.

The scorpion finally cornered Antie and in a blinding rage, snapped wildly and finally grabbed hold of him. It raised its stinger over him. He gave one final yell when he was impaled by it and thrown away. Meanwhile, the kids had grabbed sticks and rocks and raced over to the scorpion. Seeing that it stung Antie was the last straw. Ron threw a stick and the scorpion got hit in the eyes, making it bellow in pain and anger. It was bombarded with rocks and another stick got stuck in its chest. It pulled out one of the sticks and backed off. What happened to it afterward is unknown, but it is possible that it died from the wounds it received. Another possibility is that was sucked into the lawnmower and torn to shreds the following morning.
