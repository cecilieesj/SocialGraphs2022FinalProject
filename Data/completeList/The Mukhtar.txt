He is the last surviving member of a race of Mukhtars, otherwise known as Genie hunters and therefore was originally [[Genie]]'s enemy until he later reformed and they became allies.

==Role in the series==
The Mukhtar appears in two episodes, "[[Genie Hunt]]" and "[[The Hunted (Aladdin)|The Hunted]]". In the former of these, he is hired for one of [[Genie]]'s former masters, [[Ajed Al-Gebraic]], to capture Genie and put him into his service again. In the latter, he is hired by [[Mozenrath]] to capture Genie so he can entrap him in the [[Crystal of Ix]] and steal his powers, but ends up turning on Mozenrath and helping [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] rescue Genie after he saves him from a giant monstrous killer plant inside Mozenrath's palace. At the end of the episode, Genie and the Mukhtar part as friends.
