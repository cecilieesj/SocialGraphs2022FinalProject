==Background==
==='''Physical Appearance'''===
The Germlings are small (at first), but large germs who have pale faces and skin with green spots, reddish orange eyes and brown bags on their eyes, bad teeth just like their boss, [[Dr. Tobar]], orange bird-like feet with claws and brown demon-like tails.

==Role in the episode==
The germ-loving scientist [[Dr. Tobar]] planted them inside [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s brain as part of his plan to spread germs to infect others. Tobar walked Donald's body to the stadium to initiate his plot. But [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] intervened before Donald could sneeze. At this point, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] showed up, and Tobar turned the Germlings on them. Louie opened a bag of instant molten lava, and the resulting explosion destroyed them once and for all.
