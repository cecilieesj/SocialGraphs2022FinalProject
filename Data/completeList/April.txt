==Background==
April is a girl that works at Hamburger On A Stick who initially dislikes Brad, but she really enjoys [[Kick Buttowski (character)|Kick]] and only agrees to date Brad when Kick promises to be there. Kick shows up to help Brad make her like him back. However, after Brad angers Kick too many times, he ends up on his own. When April catches Brad and Kick fighting, she loses interest in him and tells him off. She then takes Brad's Golden Access Card and leaves him to go to the theater with Kick to see OctoCop: Eight Arms of Justice since she is a big fan of Rock Callahan.
