==Role in the film==
Details about her early life are unknown, aside from being born a stray. However, it is known that she eventually joined up with [[Riley (Homeward Bound II)|Riley]] and his gang of stray dogs. She apparently has a rivalry with [[Ashcan and Pete]], two vicious junkyard dogs, given her comments to them.

She meets [[Chance]] (who turned tail and fled earlier, due to mistaking Riley's gang as reinforcements for Ashcan and Pete by [[Sassy]]) when she tried to bring him back to [[Shadow]] and Sassy. While chasing him, she hinted that she seemed attracted to him by commenting, "Cute butt!" After tackling Chance in an alley, Delilah explains why she was chasing him. The two dogs get more acquainted and later spark a romance together.

Unfortunately, Riley eventually finds out, much to his displeasure. Delilah refuses to listen to Riley when he tells her that she shouldn't be with Chance because he is a housepet. She also refuses to listen to Shadow when he tells her how Chance behaves at home. However, due to Chance's unruly antics, he is soon captured by [[Jack and Ralph]], two dogcatchers who drive a blood-red van. She also ends up having her paw run over by the blood-red van, ultimately inspiring [[Bando]] to attack the drivers due to viewing that as a personal affront to him, although the injury was comparably minor. 

Although Delilah and Riley's gang save Chance from the blood-red van and its drivers, she is forced to turn down Chance on account of what Riley and Shadow had said. This hurts Chance as he storms off heartbroken. Shadow tries to stop him from leaving, but Chance angrily tells Shadow off and berates him, Delilah, and Sassy before he continues on his way. This makes Delilah feel terrible for what she had said to Chance as she helplessly watches him depart and vanish.

Delilah eventually decides to quit Riley's gang (which he presumably allowed her to do) and travels over to the Seavers' house, using her smell and heart to find Chance. When she arrives and encounters him at last, she apologizes to Chance for what she had said, and confesses her love for him and how much she missed him. Chance is overjoyed to see Delilah again, and the two dogs greet each other affectionately. [[Jamie Seaver|Jamie]] then befriends Delilah and asks his [[Laura Seaver|mother]] and [[Bob Seaver|father]] if she can stay (seeing why Chance was so sad in the first place), as do [[Hope Seaver|Hope]] and [[Peter Seaver|Peter]]. Their parents ultimately agree, and she is adopted as a member of the Seaver family, much to Chance's delight.
