'''Cindy''' is a character from the [[2018]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated short, ''[[Bao]]''.

==Background==
In [[Mom (Bao)|Mom]]'s allegorical dream sequence, [[Dumpling (Bao)|Dumpling]] introduces Cindy to the mother as she sees the ring on Cindy much to Mom's shock about Dumpling spending more time with the fiancée than her. As Dumpling prepares to continue going on a date with Cindy, Mom feels worries that Dumpling is spending more time with Cindy than Mom just as Mom prevents her from doing so, feeling furious that he must stay away from Cindy.

In the real world, it is revealed that Cindy is dated with Mom's [[Son (Bao)|real son]] as Dumpling was not Mom's real son as the whole sequence where Bao introduced Cindy to the mother was actually an allegorical dream. After the mother's real son reunited with his mother, Cindy is shown to have joined Mom and her family in making dumplings after the son happily reconciles with his mother.

==Role in the short==
Cindy makes two appearances in the short. She is first seen during the part where Dumpling introduces her to Mom. Upon seeing the ring on her, Mom feels shocked about Dumpling who is dating with Cindy just as she sits next to Mom who is feeling worried about Dumpling dating with her. As Dumpling prepares to go on a date with Cindy, Mom worriedly prevents Dumpling from continuing to date with her, much to her frustration with Dumpling. It turns out that this event was actually an allegorical dream.

After Mom reunites with her real son in the real world and the mother and son reconcile with each other, Cindy appears again in the real world as she shows the mother and her son the dumplings she made perfectly just as she kindly teaches them how to make dumplings properly. During the epilogue, Cindy is seen watching Mom teaching her son how to stir fry food just like her and later in a family photo depicting Cindy, alongside Son, Mom, and [[Dad (Bao)|Dad]].

==Trivia==
*Her name is confirmed by [[Domee Shi]], the director of the short in the audio commentary of ''Bao'' on the ''[[Pixar animated shorts compilation videos|Pixar Short Films Collection: Volume 3]]'' home video.<ref>"We definitely redeemed Cindy in the end." ~ [[Domee Shi]]</ref>
