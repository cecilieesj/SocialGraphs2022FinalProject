'''Quirin''' is the leader of the small village of [[Old Corona]] on the mainland of [[Corona]] and [[Varian]]'s father in the show, ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''.

==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==
===Season one===
Quirin is a close friend to Corona's king, [[King Frederic|Frederic]]. He also worries for his son, as most of his inventions lead to trouble, sometimes life-threatening, despite being well-intentioned. As the number of the [[Black Rocks|black rocks]] continue to grow to the point of destroying his village, he promises the villagers that he will alert the King of the problem. Varian goes with him to Corona and is shocked to see his father lying about the state of their village, causing him to believe that Quirin is running away from their problem. Quirin sees this and tells Varian to, once again, stay away from the rocks and refrain from interacting with them; in which Varian disobeys. Before Quirin catches Varian in the act, he takes a quiet look through a hidden trunk that contains items from his secret past, along with Quirin taking the time to look at the family portrait of him, his wife and Varian was a baby.

When Quirin gets sealed in the amber that was caused by Varian using an alchemical solution on the rocks, along with the letter that he had written to his son, Varian, embittered by Rapunzel's decision to save Corona over Quirin, makes it his mission to save him, no matter who or what got in his way.

After receiving a letter from Varian in "[[The Quest for Varian]]", Rapunzel sees what has happened to Quirin and begins to blame herself for not being able to help him when Varian first asked for her help to save him. In "[[The Alchemist Returns]]", Varian steals the [[Sundrop Flower|magic golden flower]] from [[Corona Castle]] and puts it on his drill in an attempt to free Quirin from the amber, only for it to fail. He then comes to the realization that the flower's magic is now within Rapunzel.

In "[[Secret of the Sun Drop]]", it is revealed in a flashback that on the night of [[Rapunzel]]'s birth, prior to Frederic's acquisition of the Sundrop Flower, Quirin had warned the King against removing the flower, as it would cause unimaginable consequences. In the present, Varian uses Rapunzel's hair as the tip of his drill in his second attempt to free his father, only for it to fail once more. After Varian's defeat, Frederic vowed to find a way to free Quirin and help his son.

===Season two===
In the prologue of "[[Beyond the Corona Walls]]", it is revealed that Quirin once served King Edmund alongside his associate, [[Adira]]. After the black rocks ravaged [[The Dark Kingdom|their kingdom]], rendering it uninhabitable, both Quirin and Adira were ordered to leave and keep anyone from finding the opal responsible for the devastation.

In "[[Rapunzel and the Great Tree]]", it's revealed that Quirin and Adira served under King Edmund as part of a small group called the Brotherhood, known to be his most trusted and skilled warriors. In the past, shortly after King Edmund's failed attempt to destroy the Moonstone, Quirin and Adira discuss the situation as the king becomes bedridden. Quirin agrees the Moonstone must be kept a secret and reminds her it's their duty to guard that secret and up hold King Edmund's dying wish. Adira disagrees and believes the solution is to locate the Sun-Drop to neutralize the opal's power. However, their discussion is interrupted by [[Hector (Tangled)|Hector]], a fellow member of the Brotherhood, who strongly disagrees with Adira and believes the Sun-Drop to be nothing more than an urbane myth. Hector proceeds to threaten Adira if she chooses to seek out the Sun-Drop, warning her if they meet again, friend or foe, he will end her life. In the present day, when Adira reveals the Brotherhood's existence to Rapunzel and her friends, she confesses Quirin is a member.

In "[[Destinies Collide]]", a flashback shows the Dark Kingdom being evacuated since the kingdom is no longer safe or inhabitable. King Edmund orders everyone to leave and never return. Quirin and a young servant woman remain at King Edmund's side, but question if he is sure about his decision. King Edmund remains firm that everyone must leave. Quirin proceeds to witness the servant woman retrieve King Edmund's [[Flynn Rider|infant son]] who will also be sent far away from the Dark Kingdom to be kept safe. Afterwards, Quirin, Adira and Hector are later seen leaving the Dark Kingdom and go their separate ways to ensure the Moonstone continues to remain a secret from the rest of the world while King Edmund remains behind to continue his family legacy to protect the opal.

===Season three===
In "[[Rapunzel's Return]]", Quirin was mentioned a few times and had a chemical named Quirineon after him by Varian. At the near end of the episode, he was finally free from the amber when Rapunzel used the Moonstone Incantation. Following Varian's success in stirring Rapunzel from her trance, he proceeded to embrace his father. As Varian inquired about Quirin's letter, which had disintegrated, he just smiled and said that he is proud of Varian and always has. He and Varian joined the others in celebrating Corona's liberation afterward.

In "[[Be Very Afraid]]", Varian has a nightmare about Quirin being resealed in the amber while the angry people of Corona tell Varian that it is his fault as he tried to reach for Quirin's stretched out hand, until Varian wakes up from his dream. Afterwards, Varian goes outside to find Quirin safe, free, and happy as he wishes his son a good morning while pushing a cart. With the nightmare still fresh in Varian's mind, the new red rocks causes Varian to see terrifying visions of Quirin calling out to his son for help, while the amber is once again re-casing him in it. After Rapunzel and Varian defeat the red rocks, Quirin is seen standing beside Varian as the people that were mean to him earlier thanking his son for saving the day; which makes Quirin proud to be Varian's father.

Once Cassandra got her hands on a magical stone in "[[Race to the Spire]]", she uses its power and connection to the Brotherhood in order to control the minds of its members, like Quirin. As his eyes and the mark on his hand glowed blue after Cass awakened the stone's power, and from the way Quirin smiled after Varian says hello to him, without noticing anything different about him, it's appears like Cassandra's corruption did not work on him.

In "[[Once a Handmaiden...]]", Quirin meets with his son and King Edmund after Cassandra destroys the castle with her black rocks and takes over the kingdom, being there for Rapunzel when she awakens.

In "[[Plus Est En Vous]]", he joined Rapunzel, her friends, his son, and the people of Corona on storming the castle to take down Cassandra and defeat Zhan Tiri with a portal Demanitus used once. He even put on his old armor from his days as a knight of the Dark Kingdom. Eugene noticed the brotherhood mark on Quirin's hand and was worried that he was as brainwashed as Adira and Hector. But when he talked to Varian about it, Varian refused to believe that his father might turn on him and the others. But Eugene was proven right when Quirin, under Cassandra's control, tried to turn on the portal to suck everyone inside. But as he attempted to pull the lever, a stun mechanism in his helmet was triggered in time to stop him. When he was unconscious, Varian revealed that he thought about what Eugene said and decided to take precautions. However, when Eugene and his father left to check on Rapunzel, Hamuel accidentally activate the portal and everyone except Quirin got transported to the Lost Realm. Then Hector's pets removed the helmet from Quirin, waking him up. He fought Eugene and King Edmund along with his old teammates. When Edmund destroyed the Mind Trap, Quirin snapped out of Cassandra's control and freed his son and everyone else from the Lost Realm. Once Zhan Tiri was destroyed and peace was restored to Corona, he worked alongside with Varian to provide the kingdom with hot running water, a goal which Varian had tried to accomplish in "[[What the Hair?!]]"

==Trivia==
*The mark on Quirin's left hand is the emblem of [[The Dark Kingdom]]. It was featured invisibly on the shadowy figure's hand at the ending scene of ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tangledbea.tumblr.com/post/167669605614/|title=Tangled Before Ever After - Tangled the series|website=Tumblr|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref> and also on [[Adira]]'s hand seen at the end of "[[Secret of the Sun Drop]]".
*Despite being Varian's father, he still calls Quirn sir sometimes.
*It's unknown what happened to Qurin's wife/Varian's mother as neither Quirin or Varian have ever mentioned her.
