'''Kijimunaa''' is a young yokai in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime who is friends with [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and [[Stitch]]. He sometimes is a coward, but he does best to keep up. Kijumunaa is a wise and thoughtful yokai. He knows every yokai and every inch of the island. Like all yokai, Kijimunaa gets his existence and power from the [[Spiritual Stone]]. His special power is sneezing because his nose is powerful enough to blow anyone away.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Kijimunaa is a short brown yokai with prominent nostrils, plump cheeks with red spots on them, and very long red hair tied up by a rope. The hair is so long that it covers his small eyes, which can lead to some viewers falsely assuming that his nostrils are his eyes, although he has no apparent trouble seeing. He has an "outie" navel (belly button) and short limbs, with five fingers on each hand (which are humanoid in shape) but only one toe on each foot. He always wears a leafy skirt held in place by a rope acting as a belt, with a knot tied to his right of his waist. Underneath, he wears what appears to be white briefs, likely due to ''Stitch!'' being a children's program.
