'''Constance Goldman''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is a geeky, yet friendly classmate of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]]'s who attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with her and her friends.

==Background==
Constance Goldman is a classmate of [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]]'s who admires her for her rebelliousness and confidence. Usually being a background character, she finally gets attention in "[[Considering Constance]]" when she surmises the urge to partner with Pepper Ann on a project. She begins to to shadow Pepper Ann which boosts her confidence enough to allow her to finally get even with the lunch lady, but soon she begins to act more as Pepper Ann's assistant. With enough confidence, she finally asks out [[Lamar Abudabe]] and it is implied that they stay together.

In her home life, Constance lives with her single mother Denise, whom she calls by her first name, yet has a very strong and loving relationship with. She is usually seen as the most active girl in Hazelnut and is apparently very good at completing various tasks and projects, as evidenced when she paired up with Pepper Ann. She is the only girl, besides [[Gwen Mezzrow]], who shows no negative or antagonistic tendencies towards Pepper Ann and genuinely wants to reach out and be her friend.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Constance changes her appearance somewhat, being noticeably prettier, though she still wears glasses, and helps out with community activities in Hazelnut.

===Personality===
Constance is a very charming and witty young girl. In the first episode focused on her, she is shown to be very shy and slightly self-deprecating and is afraid of trying things. Following her close interaction with Pepper Ann, she becomes much more assertive, but also somewhat submissive to her. She eventually becomes confident enough to handle herself; becoming much more pleasant and honest. Later episodes show her being very down-to-earth and approachable while also still maintaining an eager demeanor.

===Physical appearance===
Constance has a very average looking Caucasian girl of average height. She has a slight chin and looks rather plump, orange hair with two pigtails that stick up and big thick round glasses. She wears a pink shirt with a dog's face on it, magenta pants, light pink socks and brown shoes.

==Trivia==
*Constance is called "Consty" for short by Pepper Ann. This is unusual as a more appropriate shortened version of the name would be "Connie".
