==History==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
Ka-Zar teams up with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine]] to save Zabu from Kraven the Hunter and [[Taskmaster]] when Spider-Man comes looking to recruit him to the New Warriors. Ka-Zar uses various hand-made weapons including a spear, bowie knives and wrist mounted weapons with retractable blades. Spider-Man assists him in rescuing Zabu. In this show, Ka-Zar has difficulty surviving in the city, much like how Spider-Man isn't used to the Savage Land. After Kraven the Hunter's defeat, Ka-Zar and Zabu join the New Warriors. In the episode "New Warriors", Ka-Zar gains an upgraded version of his wrist weapons along with a bo staff.
