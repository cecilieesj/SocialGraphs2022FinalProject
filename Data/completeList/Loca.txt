==History==
Loca is a member of Alana's (and, later on, Bianca's) posse. She is rough and does the "bad work" for Alana (and then Bianca). She is a tall girl whom nobody dares to mess with. She is also romantically interested in Eddie; she likes to give him arm punches every time she sees him. Loca was with Alana and Muffy when they joined Raven's protest against Principal Lawler's decision to require all students to wear school uniforms.

During Raven's sleepover, Raven told her and the others that she was psychic, but they thought it was part of her practical joke when it really was not.
