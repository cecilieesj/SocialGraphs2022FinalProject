She is [[Finn Whitman|Finn's]] mother and at first showed no belief in the Keepers' nighttime adventures in the Disney Parks. But since she helped them solve a code to find [[Wayne Kresky|Wayne]] and later free him by distracting security in the [[Kingdom Keepers III: Disney In Shadow|third book]], she became supporting of them and usually provides transportation to Walt Disney World if the Keepers need it. In the fifth book, she is captured by [[the Overtakers]] who put a spell on her to spy on the Keepers after a troubled night at [[Typhoon Lagoon]]. She also has an encounter with Finn aboard the [[Disney Dream]] later on. A curious thing is, after five books her name is still unknown to the readers, though we know that of Finn's dad (Donald), who plays a much minor role in the novels. Shortly after, Wayne had informed Finn that Mrs. Whitman was ok. At the end of the book, she was also with the other Keepers gaurdians.
