'''Tiny Cowboy''' is a famous British pop band of which [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] and [[Stacy Hirano|Stacy]] are fans. They are mentioned a few times during the series before finally making their first appearance in "[[Meatloaf Surprise]]" in which they sing [[Meatloaf]].

==About==
Tiny Cowboy was first mentioned in "[http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Robot_Rodeo Robot Rodeo]" by Candace and Stacy, who wanted to go see a live Tiny Cowboy concert. The chances of them going were dim at first, but [http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Dr._Hirano Stacy's mom] agreed to let them go. However, it is unknown whether they went or not.

In the episode "[http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Meatloaf_Surprise Meatloaf Surprise]", Candace and Stacy went to an auction, as Candace was bidding on a limited edition Tiny Cowboy bobblehead. Candace eventually left Stacy to bid for her, while she went off to bust [http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Phineas her brothers] for their bouncy house. Candace never ended up getting her bobblehead, and was very discouraged. [http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Linda_Flynn-Fletcher Linda] then introduced her to this year's 'Meatloaf Kings', which turned out to be Nigel and Adrian, the lead vocalist and guitarist of Tiny Cowboy, respectively. Candace was shocked to meet them. Nigel and Adrian revealed that they love music, but their true passion is meatloaf. Candace and Stacy then got the chance to perform [http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Meatloaf Meatloaf] with them on stage.

Candace was also wanting to go to another Tiny Cowboy concert in "[http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Mommy_Can_You_Hear_Me%3F Mommy Can You Hear Me?]", and they were also mentioned again in "[http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/The_Curse_of_Candace The Curse of Candace]".
