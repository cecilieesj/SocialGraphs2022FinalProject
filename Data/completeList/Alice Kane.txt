'''Alice Kane''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is a student at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] and the arch-rival of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]]. She is highly intellectual and lives to make Pepper Ann miserable.

==Background==
Alice Kane is a student at Hazelnut Middle School who thrives on belittling [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] whom she insultingly calls "P-Ann". Her first major appearance was in "[[The Big Pencil]]" where she planned to once again show up Pepper Ann with her science project as her entry from last year was a major hit. Ironically, her latest project, despite her overconfidence, was not as practical and she begrudgingly accepted her defeat against her arch-nemesis. Later, appearances had her once again being very insulting towards Pepper Ann and getting shown up by her for one reason for another.

In "[[Alice Kane Went Down to Calcutta]]", Alice discovers that she is moving to Calcutta, [[India]] due to her father's job and decides to make it up to Pepper Ann. Despite what appears to be genuine feelings to make up for their terrible relationship, Pepper Ann refuses to believe her even though there is clear evidence to her wanting to change. This culminates in Pepper Ann destroying her tickets, only to learn she was telling the truth. However, in a bizarre twist of fate, Pepper Ann's actions indirectly affected a series of events that resulted in Alice, not only staying in Hazelnut with her family, but also terminating her friendship with Pepper Ann on live TV, much to her pleasure.

Alice is absent in "[[The Finale]]", though due to the fact that she did not show up for the middle school reunion, it is possible that she finally moved away for real.

===Personality===
Alice is a snooty overachiever. She considers herself better than everyone in every aspect. While her primary target is Pepper Ann, she has also shown some dominance over other classmates such as [[Pink-Eye Pete]] whom she tried to mold into someone else. She has little respect for those around her and wishes for everyone to act to her standards. However, she is honorable as she was willing to admit defeat to Pepper Ann and was willing to make amends with her when she thought she was leaving, only to turn back to her devious self when her family was given to opportunity to stay in Hazelnut.

===Physical appearance===
Alice is a tall, possibly Asian, girl with a brown bowl cut hair and large ponytail sticking out the top and held by a yellow scrunchy. She wears large, round, red glasses and wears a blue dress with light green collar, belt and accents. She wears light violet leggings, white socks and rather unusual looking yellow shoes with pink soles.

==Trivia==
*The voice actress who portrayed her, Lauren Tom, would later voice Numbuh 3/Kuki in ''Codename: Kids Next Door'', which was created by the show's lead character designer Tom Warburton.
*While never specified, it is possible that Alice is supposed to be Asian, based on her voice actress.
