'''Squeaks''' is a caterpillar in ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''. Throughout the film, [[Dinky and Boomer]] try to catch him in an attempt to eat him, but by the end, he transforms into a butterfly and flies away.

==Role in the film==
Squeaks is a caterpillar who never seems to get a rest from [[Dinky and Boomer]]'s restless hunt. The birds, who both want to devour the caterpillar, are constantly after him up until the last part of the movie when he transforms into a butterfly. 

During the winter season, Squeaks pops up from a snowbank not before a freezing wind makes him shiver. He was able to outsmart Dinky and Boomer by entering Widow Tweed's cottage through a lock hole in the door and warm himself by the fire. Then Dinky and Boomer vow to catch Squeaks after the winter season is over as they flew south. Sometime later when springtime had come again, Squeaks gets watered by Widow Tweed's watering can on a plant (which he presumably munched on), causing him to sneeze flying into a draining pipe, getting Dinky and Boomer's attention. Boomer forces the caterpillar out of the pipe by pecking at it, and he quickly hides in on of the electric telephone glass. Boomer tries to peck the glass, but gets eletrocuted along with Dinky. Squeaks makes his getaway by crawling onto a telephone pole line beeping each time he crawls.

At the last act, Dinky and Boomer ae just about to corner Squeaks, but suddenly they are blinded by a light. Squeaks comes out of the tree, now transformed into a butterfly, much to the two bird's surprise. Not only do the two birds not realize who he is (although they remark that his eyes look familiar), but they are now unable to catch him. Squeaks is happy he has nothing to run or hide from anymore, and greets [[Big Mama]], who recognizes him in butterfly form, before flying off.

He is green with big eyes. As a butterfly, he has blue and purple wings and his face and body look the same as in his caterpillar form, except blue instead of green.
