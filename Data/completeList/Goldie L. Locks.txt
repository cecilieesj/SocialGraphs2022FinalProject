'''Goldie Locks''', more commonly known as '''Goldie''', is the female protagonist of the [[2015]] Disney Junior animated series ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. She is an eleven-year-old girl who befriends [[Jack A. Bear|Bear]] after she breaks his favorite chair. She always travels with [[Frog]] and plays with Bear every time is an adventure. Goldie is more emotional and impulsive, while Bear is more logical. This has given them a few communication errors in their friendship, such as when Goldie developed "Pinocchio-itis" when she had to fib to keep Bear's surprise gift a secret, thus making Bear mistakenly see her as dishonest. Goldie is a skilled inventor, and able to make complex machines with simple supplies even if they do not work all the time.

Goldie has apricot skin, blue eyes and long blonde hair that is styled into curly locks at the back. She generally wears a pink headband with a pink bow, a blue elbow-length dress with a pink ribbon on the front, a white collar and a pink belt, long white socks with pink trim and pink Mary Jane shoes.
