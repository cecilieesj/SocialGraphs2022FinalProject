He is designed to produce trails of slippery slime in order to trip up enemies. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]".

==Appearances==

===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===
Experiment 390 was the 390th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to leave slippery slime trails for enemies to trip on. 390 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 390's pod landing in a sleeping tourist's belly button at a [[Birds of Paradise Hotel|hotel]].

The man later awoke and flicked 390's pod into the nearby swimming pool, activating the experiment.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
In "[[627 (episode)|627]]", 390 was tracked down and captured in a containment orb by [[Stitch]]. However, [[627]] was able to abduct 390 from Stitch and hand the experiment over to [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]]. 390, named Slimy, was later seen hanging out at [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], where he shook his slime all over [[Reuben]], much to the latter's disgust.

Slimy reappeared in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Slimy, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Slimy participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Slimy made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as an image on a computer screen.

==Trivia==
*After [[Reuben]] and [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]], Slimy is tied with [[Digger]] for the most appearances of experiments that debuted in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''. Both appeared in two different episodes of ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' as well as ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''. Though Slimy briefly appeared on a computer screen in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime.
*Slimy is one of three known limbless experiments, the other two being [[Zap]] and [[Cloudy]].
**However, unlike Zap and Cloudy, who are capable of levitating in the air, Slimy crawls on the ground similar to slugs and snails, which inspired Slimy's design.
*Slimy's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is red.
*Strangely, Slimy seems to change from dark green in ''Stitch! The Movie'' and light green in the series to dull blue and dirty clear. It is unknown how or why this happens, but he is shown twice in ''Leroy & Stitch'' like this, and his original green version did not appear. It is possible that it was a general recolor in order to fill out the group of experiments to make it appear as if there were more experiments than were actually designed.
*Slimy also changes in size from large in ''Stitch! The Movie'' to small in "[[627 (episode)|627]]". It is unknown if there was a reason for this or just a change in animation style.
*Slimy is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
