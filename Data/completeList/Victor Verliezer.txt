He is the CEO of V-Tech Corp Inc. and the false inventor of Cybernetic Individual Domestic Droid (C.I.D.D. for short).

== Role ==
In the episode "[[A Clockwork Origin]]", [[Milo Murphy|Milo]], [[Zack Underwood|Zack]] and [[Melissa Chase|Melissa]] visit V-Tech to see a new product presented by Victor. After a demonstration from C.I.D.D. fails, he escapes and Victor tries to capture him. As the three characters run after C.I.D.D., they realize that the robot was invented by a man named Clyde Rickenbacker. Just as C.I.D.D. reunites with Clyde, he is captured by Victor, who is distracted by Zack's faulty app.

The three characters are chased until they reach V-Tech, where it is revealed that Clyde was tricked into giving away his rights to his inventions after he turned away. Milo, Zack and Melissa open a live-stream of Victor mocking his customers, causing his company, V-Tech, to be destroyed.

== Trivia ==
* He is the second villain to appear in the series, after [[King Pistashion]].
* He is similar to [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', as they are both antagonistic geniuses, and are involved in technology. However, unlike Doofenshmirtz, who is very capable of creating his own technology and is very sympathetic in nature, Victor hold no empathy and tends to steal other peoples' inventions so that he can pass them out as his own.
* The word "Verliezer" is the Dutch word for "Loser". His name is strangely unchanged in the Dutch dub.
