'''Anybodys''' is a supporting character in ''[[West Side Story]]''. He is a trans youth who wants to be accepted as a member of the [[Jets]] despite how everyone views him.

==Background==
===Personality===
Anybodys is one of the toughest people on the streets of [[New York City]]. Unfortunately for him, none of the [[Jets]] can see past his orientation; he was assigned female at birth, but identifies as a male. He does not let this get him down and will go to great lengths to prove his worth. Because of how he is treated by the Jets, he is shown to be much more compassionate than the others and tried to warn [[Anita (West Side Story)|Anita]] of the Jets' intent and tried to protect [[Tony (West Side Story)|Tony]] from danger; apparently empathizing with his situation.

==Trivia==
*Prior to iris menas portraying Anybodys, he was played by numerous other actors. In the [[1958]] West End production, Anybodys was played by Maxine Gordon. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, Susan Oakes portrayed her.
**In all previous adaptations, Anybodys is portrayed as a tomboy; a girl who acts like a boy. In the [[2021]] film adaptation, Anybodys is presented as trans, a boy who was assigned female at birth.
**The film was banned in multiple Middle Eastern countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait, due to the fact that the character was played by a transgender actor. However, it was eventually released in cinemas in the United Arab Emirates around a month later.
*He is the first trans character to appear in a Disney-related film.
