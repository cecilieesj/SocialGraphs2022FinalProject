==Background==
===Personality===
Katrina is treated like a princess by everyone in Sleepy Hollow and, while a very cheerful, graceful, kind, demure, smart, poised, and elegant young woman, appears to be rather oblivious to the fawning attitude of everyone around her, and seems somewhat carefree and frivolous. According to the original author, Washington Irving, she is "blooming, plump as a partridge, ripe, melting, and rosy-cheeked." However, this treatment may have left her a little spoiled, or at the very least unaware of the problems around her. Additionally, it is said that she had constantly hoped for “some champion to appear, to take and feel open with. Against the boisterous Brom.” 

===Physical appearance===
Katrina is a very beautiful young woman who bears a striking resemblance to [[Cinderella]]. She is regarded as the most beautiful, most blooming, and most stunning person in Sleepy Hollow. as well as the prettiest, loveliest, finest, and fairest in all of New York City. She wears a beautiful dress consisting of dark pink short-gown with matching peplum, an aqua stomacher with a couple of laces crisscrossing it, white trim on her sleeves, a sweetheart neckline and pink skirt, a white petticoat and matching Dutch-style hat, black ballet shoes, a bustle beneath her dress, and carries a lime parasol. She has blue eyes, fair skin, pink lips, rosy cheeks, thin black eyebrows and matching eyelashes, and strawberry-blonde hair.

On Halloween night at a party at her house with Ichabod Crane, her hair is pigtailed with blue ribbons. She dons a dress consisting of a dark pink bodice with matching peplum, pink short sleeves, white brims on her sleeves,  a wide v-neckline and pink skirt, a petticoat in the same color, a black band tied around her neck, a bustle beneath her dress, and shoes of the same color

On her wedding day on a day after Halloween, she sports a beautiful wedding dress consisting of periwinkle short-sleeved bodice with matching brims on her sleeves and blue skirt, a white Juliet cap with a clear white veil attached to it, a bustle beneath her dress, and a bouquet of lilies.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''===
In the film, Katrina Van Tassel is a very lovely, fair and beautiful young woman who is the daughter of old [[Baltus Van Tassel]], the richest farmer in the county. Katrina attracts many of the young men in Sleepy Hollow who offer to do anything for her like setting up her picnic for her or carry her groceries home for her. Soon [[Ichabod Crane|Ichabod]], a charming yet greedy schoolteacher, bumps into her. Ichabod fell for her after witnessing her looks (and of hearing of her father’s vast riches) and offers to carry her groceries home for her, but Ichabod's rival [[Brom Bones]], who also had feelings for Katrina, sees this and pushes Ichabod into the mud. He puts Katrina on his horse and carries her groceries home for her, but soon Ichabod catches up to them and takes Katrina home again. When they arrive at Katrina's house Ichabod kisses Katrina's hand and leaves, but Brom is outside waiting and Ichabod runs back in and gives Katrina some flowers; she places one in Ichabod's shirt pocket. Ichabod leaves again but is grabbed by Brom suddenly, though Katrina manages to distract Brom in order for Ichabod to escape happily home. Soon Katrina's father is having a Halloween Party and she invites Ichabod, who dances with her at the party. During the dance, Brom manages to steal Katrina from Ichabod for a short period of time but Ichabod manages to get Katrina back and together they steal the whole dance together, causing everyone except for Brom Bones to clap for them. Shortly after the dance Brom Bones tells a story about him meeting the [[The Headless Horseman|Headless Horseman]], who rides in Sleepy Hollow every Halloween night looking for a new head. The story frightens Ichabod and Katrina laughs at his scared reactions. After the party as Ichabod rides home he has a mysterious encounter with the Headless Horseman and disappears from Sleepy Hollow. Katrina winds up marrying Brom Bones.

*Katrina bears some resemblance to [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]].
*Katrina is the only lead character in Disney animation with Dutch origin.
