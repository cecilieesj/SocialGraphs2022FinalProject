One night, Faizaan goes to the beach with his friends, and brings along his guitar. As he's tuning the strings, he greets his friend, [[Red Dagger|Kareem]], who is walking over to join them, with a [[Ms. Marvel|girl]]. She makes fun of Kareem's nickname "Kimo", and Kareem informs her they all go by nicknames, so when asked what hers is, she replies to "Sloth Baby". Faizaan chuckles at this and gives admiration, labelling it as cool, which she thanks him for. He asks if she's ready for the best meal of her life, as the group pass around bags of biryani. Once everyone starts eating, Faizaan plays his guitar and starts singing.
