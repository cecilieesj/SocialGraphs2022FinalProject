'''Br'er Gator''' or '''Br'er Alligator''' is a character who appeared in the attraction [[Splash Mountain]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Br'er Gator is a resident of [[Chickapin Hill|Splash Mountain]], being a large somewhat anthropomorphic alligator.

=== Development History ===
Br'er Gator is a character originating from the [[Uncle Remus|Uncle Remus stories]], namely the fables ''Why the Alligator's Back Is Rough'' and ''[[Br'er Rabbit|Brother Rabbit]] & the Gizzard-Eater''. In these stories, Br'er Gator traditionally served as an antagonist and enemy to the archetypal trickster-hero of Br'er Rabbit.

In one of these stories, Br'er Gator attempted to eat Br'er Rabbit only for the rabbit to trick him into lying in a fire which caused his back to grow course.  In another story, Br'er Rabbit used fake rumors to make the gator insecure enough to agree to ferry Br'er Rabbit across the river for free.

Br'er Gator was adapted into AA form for the attraction Splash Mountain, a ride based on ''Song of the South'', which in turn was based on the Uncle Remus stories.  In [[2020]], the attraction was slated to be removed, due to public disapproval of apparent stereotyping.

== Appearances ==

=== Splash Mountain ===
Br'er Gator appeared twice in Splash Mountain, first during the ''[[How Do You Do?]]'' musical number. Br'er Gator was seen fishing in the waters of Splash Mountain as [[Br'er Frog]] casually laid on his back. The gator was seen again near the end of the ride, sticking his head out of the water to bite the tail of [[Br'er Fox]]. As the fox attempted to pull [[Br'er Bear]] out from the briar patch, Br'er Gator attempted to drag the fox underwater to eat him, much to Br'er Fox's dismay.

== Trivia ==
* Br'er Gator from the ride has received online popularity due to the spreading interest in ''submechanophobia'', the irrational fear of mechanical objects (namely animatronics) submerged in water.
