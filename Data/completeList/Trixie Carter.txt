==Background==
[[File:Trixie Carter2.jpg|thumb|250px|Trixie Carter as she appears in Season One.]]

Trixie is an African-American girl living in [[New York City]]. Her best friends are [[Jake Long]] and [[Arthur Spudinski|Spud]]. She is Jake's best bud and the only female friend. She is ''fully'' [[New York City]]. Carter currently attends [[Millard Fillmore Middle School]]. Trixie loves helping Jake protect the magical community.

===Personality===
She is sassy, vivacious, feisty, and somewhat of a tomboyish character. Although initially annoyed at Jake for how long he kept his secret from her, she loves helping to protect the magical community. She is supportive of both Jake and Spud, but for a while, she has shown a dislike and distrust toward Rose and was a bit unsupportive of Jake's feelings for her,<ref>[[Being Human]]</ref> but soon started to accept their relationship. She even comforted Jake when the two of them broke up during the school's Valentine's Day field trip event.<ref name="love">[[The Love Cruise]]</ref> After Rose nearly sacrificed herself to save Jake and every magical creature in the world,<ref name="home">[[Homecoming]]</ref> she tried to help Jake to move on.

She is also a trustworthy friend because even though Jake's grandfather did not initially trust her and Spud, they kept Jake's dragon secret.<ref>[[Professor Rotwood's Thesis]]</ref>

She can be very rude and inconsiderate because she threw away her long time friendship with Spud and Jake just to be with the "cool" girls and have girl talk with the cheer squad. But in the end, she saves both of her friends and proves to be considered loyal.<ref>[[Bring It On (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Bring it On]]</ref>

===Talents, Interests, and Abilities===
Trixie has a great talent in cheerleading and acrobatics, although her fiasco with the Millard Fillmore Middle School cheer squad has turned her off from using them.<ref>[[Bring It On (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Bring it On]]</ref> She enjoys {{WikipediaLink|skateboarding}} and hanging out with her friends. She also has a big interest in money, as well as great interest in biology, and aspires to become "Doctor Trixie Carter".<ref>[[Dreamscape]]</ref><ref>[[A Ghost Story]]</ref> She is also able to hold her bladder for a long time as seen in a camping episode where she holds it a whole weekend.<ref>[[Camp Mugwomp]]</ref>

==Relationships==
===Family===
Trixie lives at home with her mother and grandmother, although her mother is sometimes away for long periods as she is either an airplane attendant or an airline pilot. At these times, her grandmother acts as Trixie's primary caregiver, always asking her if she or her friends want something to eat. It has never been confirmed, but Trixie's grandmother may live with her.

It is established in that her father works for the military and is a fighter pilot.<ref>[[Hairy Christmas]]</ref> Trixie's family appears to be wealthy. It is shown that her mother often buys Trixie designer clothing when she is in other countries, but Trixie rarely wears them as they are not her style.<ref>[[Bring It On (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Bring it On]]</ref>

===Love Interests===
Early on, she maintained a celebrity crush on [[Denzel Washington]], often calling out his name and asking him to "wait for me".

Later she developed a more realistically obtainable obsession with another student in her school named [[Kyle Wilkins]].<ref>[[The Love Cruise]]</ref> She constantly boasts about her crush and will let everyone know about it.

She also once accidentally flirts and date with this one boy at a video game convention who she doesn't know and who is wearing a costume so she doesn't know who he is, thinking he was someone her age. She totally freaked out when she found out the truth about him. He turns up to be around 8 years, his height was boosted up by the help of his bulky costume, and the little brother of Kyle Wilkins.<ref>[[Haley Gone Wild]]</ref>

However, some fans speculate that she has a crush on Spud. Going with the clich√© of friends who started dating, there was constant hinting that she might actually have romantic feelings for Spud, but she and Spud say flat out that they are "friends and nothing more."<ref>[[Homecoming]]</ref>
