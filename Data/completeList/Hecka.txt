}}'''Hecka''' is a character in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]].

==Background==
According to [[Launchpad McQuack]] (who took over the wrestling commentator's spot), Hecka is described as a wrestler who originates from Nifleheim who has collected over 10,000 undead souls. She is accompanied by her pet wolf Fenrir.

Later when Jormungandr reveals that he doesn't have to use his hands during a wrestling match, Hecka found out that this is not what wrestlers did back then just as she, her pet wolf Fenrir, and Strongbeard turn against him for breaking the rules about wrestling.

==Role in the series==
Hecka and her pet wolf Fenrir are introduced in the Season 3 episode, "[[The Rumble for Ragnarok!]]".

Hecka and Fenrir are introduced as the second contenders that [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey Duck]] faces due to [[Scrooge McDuck]] injured by angry spectators who threw a chair on him after defeating [[Strongbeard]]. During battle, Hecka attempts to defeat Dewey to which Scrooge tells him to trust his instincts while Webby tells her to leave Scrooge along. Enraged, [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] prepares to defeat Hecka, but her defeat is prevented when her pet wolf Fenrir tackles her to which Dewey thinks Hecka is cheating during a wrestling match. Dewey manages to get back on the ring during a wrestling match to fight against the contenders to which Webby tackles both of them. However, after she and Fenrir defeat Dewey, the two leave the arena just the final round begins with [[Jormungandr]] facing the McDucks himself.

Later when Jormungandr mentions that he doesn't have to use his hands during the match, the fans turn against him, alongside Hecka, Fenrir, and Strongbeard who are all disgusted upon hearing Jormungandr's actions that are against the rules. Fortunately, Dewey manages to defeat Jormungandr during a tough match.

==Trivia==
*Hecka is based on the Norse goddess Hela who reigns from the realm of death in Norse mythology. However, despite being inspired by her mythological counterpart, the name change is because "Hela" is the source word for "hell", which would possibly be considered inappropriate for a television show and to make the name family-friendly for a kid-friendly series, her name was substituted as "Hecka".
