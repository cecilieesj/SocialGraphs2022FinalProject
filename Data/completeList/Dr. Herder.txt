}}'''Dr. Lowell Herder''' is a pediatrician who appears in the fourth season ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_406:_Terrible_Twos Terrible Twos]." His face was operated by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/David_Greenaway David Greenaway], his body was puppeteered by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Fisher Tom Fisher] and his voice was provided by [[Michael McKean]].

The Sinclairs seek the doctor's help when [[Baby Sinclair]] turns two years old. [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] requests a sedative, but while the physician can dispense dangerous drugs at will, he chooses not to in this instance.

Following the examination, Dr. Herder instead recommends setting concrete boundaries, specifically by walling the child inside a cave for a year.
