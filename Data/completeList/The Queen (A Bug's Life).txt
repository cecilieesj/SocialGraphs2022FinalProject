'''The Queen''' is the royal ant queen of [[Ant Island]], the mother of [[Atta]] and [[Dot]], and a major character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[1998]] film ''[[A Bug's Life]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
The Queen is a very kind, caring individual with a good sense of humor. While her daughter [[Atta]] gets very stressed about becoming queen and is concerned with every detail, the Queen is more relaxed and can make a joke out of situations that aren't super serious. She is also nicer to [[Flik]] than most of the colony, just like her younger daughter [[Dot]]. However, when she discovers Flik's deception, she admonishes him for his lies and stops Dot from going after him after Atta exiles him. She forgives him later, though after he saves her from being executed by Hopper and having the courage to stand up to Hopper and his grasshoppers.

==Role in the film==
The Queen is the ruler of the ant colony. She is an elderly lavender ant who is due to give up her crown to her eldest daughter, [[Princess Atta]]. She also admonishes her younger daughter, [[Dot]], for trying to fly before her wings grow in. She has a pet aphid named Aphie, whom she adores. She is also shown to have a possible romantic relationship with another elder ant, Cornelius.

When Flik accidentally destroys the pile of food made for the grasshoppers, they are forced to create a second pile. The Queen consents to have Flik travel to Bug City to keep him out of the way. When Flik returns she is surprised to see him return with other bugs whom he claims are “warriors”. When they save Dot from an evil bird, the Queen puts her trust into them, and consents to have a fake bird constructed to scare off the Grasshoppers.

When [[Circus Bugs#P.T. Flea|P.T. Flea]] arrives looking for his [[Circus Bugs|troupe]] and blows [[Flik]]'s cover in the process, she banishes them along with Flik and firmly but kindly stops Dot from reaching Flik. However, Flik's banishment was a fatal mistake which leads to putting the entire colony in danger. The Queen is very beloved by her people, so [[Hopper]] decides to teach the ants a lesson about disobedience by plotting to kill her.

She later participates in the magic act of the circus troupe to distract Hopper, in which she is placed into a Chinese Cabinet (actually, she stowed away hiding under [[Circus Bugs#Dim|Dim]]'s wings) and cackles while observing the chaos the fake [[Bird (A Bug's Life)|bird]] has caused amongst the grasshoppers. However, the plan is immediately disrupted by P.T. Flea who mistook it for a real bird and sets it on fire, accidentally aiding Hopper in the process. When the Queen learns of Hopper's plot to kill her, the colony, including the Queen, expresses shock and horror, as well as listen to Flik's inspirational speech. She charges at the grasshoppers in a rage and expels them from the colony, leading Hopper to get killed by the real bird and her chicks, and thus ending his reign of terror and insult on the ant colony.

At the end of the film, the Queen removes Atta's tiara and replaces it with her own larger crown, signifying her daughter's position as the new queen as Atta passes her tiara to Dot.
