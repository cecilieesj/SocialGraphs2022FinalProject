They are legendary spirit misfits who attacked [[Maru (location)|Maru]] in ancient times, as well as the main antagonists of the series finale, "[[Coronation Day]]".

==Background==
Centuries ago, the Shadows of the Night broke through from their world and into the [[EverRealm]]. The Maruvians used the Jewel of Maru to defeat the Shadows, but the pulse of magic was so powerful it also sent all the Maruvians to the Spirit World, which in turn goes as far as to destroy the kingdom of Maru as well.

Ever since then, the Shadows remained imprisoned in the Shadow Gateway leading to the EverRealm, which is located near Nueva Vista. Their actions in nearly destroying Maru become extremely well-known.

==Powers and Abilities==
Cahu is the Time Shade. As such, she can manipulate time itself, including slowing people and attacks down to evade them. Using the sand from her hourglass, which is the source of her powers, and makes her hair flow, she can turn people and objects into stone murals. She can also hover.

Vuli is the Chaos Shade. His face changes according to his emotions, yellow for happiness, blue for sadness, and red for anger. By touching people he can influence them to spread chaos and turn allies against each other.

Yolo is the Animal Shade. He can turn himself and other people into any creature he desires using blue flames.

Hetz is the Weather Shade. His abilities include changing the weather and summoning lightning bolts. His ability can be turned against him as he is vulnerable to lighting himself, as demonstrated when Isabel used a lightning rod to make him electrocute himself.

==Role in the series==
In "[[The Jewel of Maru]]", Amaláy, the Royal Wizard of Maru, explains to Elena about the Shadows of the Night, and that she is now a spirit guarding the Jewel of Maru.

In "[[Coronation Day]]", [[Ash Delgado|Ash]] and her group set their sights on looking for the Shadow Gateway, the barrier keeping the Shadows of the Night out of the EverRealm. [[Chancellor Esteban|Esteban]] is apprehensive as the Shadows of the Night nearly destroyed the Kingdom of Maru, to which Ash tells him that is why she wants to recruit them. When Esteban question how she can be sure the Shadows will help them she states to him that they will do so out of gratitude for freeing them.

When they arrive at the Shadow Gateway thanks to [[Chatana]], Ash is given enough time to open the Gateway through which she and Elena fall in with [[Flo (Elena of Avalor)|Flo]] going after them. Following the defeat of Chatana, [[Pili]], and [[Tziloco]], the Shadows of the Night come through and ask Esteban if he freed them. Esteban lies and says he did. He also tells them Elena's group is attacking him. The Shadows overwhelm Elena's group forcing them to retreat. The Shadows rename themselves the Four Shades of Awesome. The Shades introduce themselves as Hetz, Vuli, Yolo, and Cahu. They pledge themselves to Esteban and vow to make him King and the five of them set off to conquer [[Avalor]].

When Esteban introduces them to Avalor, the Four Shades of Awesome launch their attack. Isabel's leadership enables them to send Hetz back to the Spirit World by getting him to blast himself with his own lightning attack. Unfortunately, the other Shades prove to be way too powerful and they are quickly beaten back.

Esteban and Cahu enter Avalor Palace much to the shock of Francisco and Luisa. After Esteban and Luisa have an argument, Cahu turns her and Francisco to stone. Furious at this turn of events, Esteban demands that she change them back only for Cahu to tell him he keeps making the same mistake: trusting those who pretend to listen. Cahu reveals that the Shades were just using Esteban.

Elena's group takes down Vuli and Yolo and sends them back to the Spirit World by having Mateo enchant Gabe's sword, which he uses to paralyze them in place, after which Mateo blasts them with a spell powerful enough to kill them. However, Cahu proves to be way too powerful. Before she can turn Elena to stone, Esteban takes the hit for her, causing Elena to finally forgive Esteban. Her forgiveness activates her emotion magic which changes Esteban and everyone else in Avalor back. Furious at this turn of events, Cahu tries one final attempt to turn Elena into stone, only for Esteban to destroy her hourglass using the [[Scepter of Light]]. Just as she tries to retrieve her power, Esteban and Elena stop her and combine their magic to send Cahu back to the Spirit World, before returning.
