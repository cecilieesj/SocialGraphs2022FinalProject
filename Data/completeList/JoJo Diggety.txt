'''JoJo Diggety''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the police officer uncle of [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] and [[Moose Pearson|Moose]], [[Janie Diggety|Janie]]'s husband and Ned's father.

==Background==
JoJo Diggety is a cop in Hazelnut who is married to [[Janie Diggety|Janie Lilly]]. Together, they have a son named Nedward, or Ned for short. JoJo's background has hardly been delved into, but his job just so happens to be somewhat the morally opposite of his wife's, in that she is a protester and activist who occasionally balks against the law while JoJo himself is a police officer who maintains the law. His niece, [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] was convinced that his job as a cop was all about facing danger, but in contrast, his job mainly has him focusing on minor issues such as waking someone up, getting a cat out of a tree and helping someone parallel park. He does not mind however as he likes to help the community.

JoJo and his family are absent in "[[The Finale]]", though it can be assumed that he still lives in the other half of the duplex.

===Personality===
JoJo is a good natured man with a sense of morality that is befitting with his job. He always keeps up a good sense of humor and plays it loose with his family. However, he will put his foot down if they or anyone else is going against the law, revealing that he does have a strict and disciplined side as well. Nevertheless, he loves his family unconditionally and is always happy to help them out whenever they need it.

===Physical appearance===
JoJo is a large chubby Caucasian man with curly blond hair with a bald spot on top. He has a large black fuzzy unibrow and a noticeable five o'clock shadow. He is usually seen in uniform with a light blue shirt, his silver badge displayed, dark blue tie and matching pants and black shoes.

==Trivia==
*JoJo is constantly craving soy-based or fat free foods, which all places seem to just so happen to have. Despite this, he maintains his rather large appearance.
