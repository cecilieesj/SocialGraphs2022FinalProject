==Deleted/Unused Characters==
Many additional characters were planned, or at least considered, for inclusion in the film but were ultimately omitted or dropped due to legal issues and/or production limitations. Others managed to appear or make it into the final film, but were either cut out or replaced later on during production and development.
[[File:8422.Acme-7.jpg-500x0.jpg|thumb|304x304px]]
Many of those listed characters can be found in the storyboards for the unproduced scene of Marvin Acme's funeral.

==Special Edition DVD Cameos==
Numerous characters that did not make cameos in the film made a few on the menus of the Special Edition DVD.

'''Note''': Most characters can be seen in the second disc.

*[[Lady Tremaine]] from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''*
*A [[Bread-and-Butterflies|Bread-and-Butterfly]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''*
*[[Elliott]] from ''[[Pete's Dragon]]''*
*[[Kuzco|Emperor Kuzco]] from ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''*

(*) Denotes anachronisms; these characters (or, in the cases of characters such as Tinker Bell and Marvin the Martian, the animated versions of them that appear in the film) were created or adapted to cartoons after 1947. But as screenplay writer Peter S. Seaman said, "The aim was entertainment, not animation history." It has also been argued that the characters may have "existed" in the Toon world before being "discovered" and featured in real productions.

==Trivia==

Those characters are Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Lampwick from ''Pinocchio'', Willie the Giant, Screwy Squirrel (who was also mentioned in the film), and Felix the Cat (who was also intended to appear in the film on his own).
*The Dinosaurs from ''Fantasia'', Mary Poppins, Piglet, Thomas O’Malley, and Beaky Buzzard appear in the film, but only silhouettes of them were shown.
*Some cartoon characters didn’t have a cameo in the movie, but they are mentioned in it by other characters. Those characters are [[Alice]] from ''Alice in Wonderland'', [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]], Screwy Squirrel (who also appears in a poster shown in the film), {{WikipediaLink|Chilly Willy}}, {{WikipediaLink|Dinky Doodle}}, and {{WikipediaLink|Raggedy Ann}}.

Coyote, Sylvester, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales, Droopy Dog, and Woody Woodpecker) in addition to those who did not make the final cut (such as Chip and Dale, Pepé Le Pew, Petunia Pig, the Tasmanian Devil, Hector the Bulldog, Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Rocket J. Squirrel, and Bullwinkle J. Moose).
*There were also cartoon cameos in the Roger Rabbit shorts that were released some years after the movie. The characters appearing in the shorts are Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, [[The Mad Doctor (character)|The Mad Doctor]], the [[Three Little Wolves (characters)|Three Little Wolves]], {{WikipediaLink|Raggedy Andy}}, and Droopy Dog in ''[[Tummy Trouble]]''; Clarabelle Cow, Pinocchio, and [[Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' in ''[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]''; Tinker Bell, [[Evinrude]] from ''[[The Rescuers]]'', the [[Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', and the Boy from ''[[Off His Rockers]]'' in ''[[Trail Mix-Up]]''.
*Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck also appeared with the ''[[w:c:muppet:Muppet Babies|Muppet Babies]]'' versions of [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Miss Piggy]], and [[Gonzo]], and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger (who were also intended to appear in the film) in the anti-drug TV special, ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' two years later in 1990.
*The novel ''{{WikipediaLink|Who Censored Roger Rabbit?}}'' by Gary K. Wolf (the novel on which the film is based on) mentions original characters from American comic strips, including Dick Tracy (who was originally intended to appear in the film on his own), {{WikipediaLink|Snoopy}}, [[Wikipedia:Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] and {{WikipediaLink|Dagwood Bumstead}}, {{WikipediaLink|Beetle Bailey}}, and {{WikipediaLink|Hägar the Horrible}}.<ref>https://www.mouseplanet.com/8606/The_Roger_Rabbit_That_Never_Was</ref> Bugs Bunny also appears and other characters, such as Petunia Pig are mentioned.
*In the 5th issue of the [[Roger Rabbit (comic book)|comic series based on the film]], there was an appearance of a character named Percy Pig, which shares the same name of the [[Wikipedia:Percy Pig|candy mascot "Percy Pig"]]. However, the comic was published in 1990, while the candy product with the same name was created 2 years after, in 1992.
