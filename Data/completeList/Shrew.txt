==Role in the episode==
[[Kaa]] tries to eat the Shrew until she mentions something about a treasure in a place known as the Middle Jungle, so, Kaa spares her and returns to his friends to tell them the news. However, they don't know how and where is the Middle Jungle, so, they send out Kaa back into the jungle to find and bring back the Shrew to tell them more even if it means somewhat threatening to eat her when she starts mocking and letting out sarcastic comments.

Later, the Shrew appears in the treasure room when [[Whitehood]], the giant cobra treasure guardian, tries to eat them. Then, she begins to mock and tell him off. Try as much as Whitehood can to silence her, make her leave him alone, and probably eat her, the shrew continues on mocking Whitehood until she reveals to everyone that he is not as poisonous or as young as he used to be, which eventually leads to Whitehood finally and regretfully confessing to the cubs that his poison actually dried up long before their births, his fangs are "just a memory", and his defeat at the end.
