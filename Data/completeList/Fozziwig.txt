'''Fozziwig''' is the version of [[Fezziwig]] featured in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''. He runs the [[Fozziwig and Mom Ltd.|Fozziwig Rubber Chicken Factory]] and was [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]]'s first employer. With his mother, Fozziwig also presides over the annual Christmas party. It's at one such party that young bookkeeper Ebenezer is introduced to [[Belle (A Christmas Carol)|Belle]], a friend of the family.

An elderly Fozziwig, with a beard and an ear horn, is seen again when Scrooge returns to the present, residing in a sort of Victorian-era nursing home alongside [[Sam the Eagle (Muppets)|Scrooge's headmaster]].
