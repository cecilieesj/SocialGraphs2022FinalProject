'''Tunu''' and '''Wema''' are young hyenas that appear in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. They make their debut in "Lions of the Outlands", and are members of [[Jasiri's Clan]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Due to the situation concerning the watering hole, Tunu and Wema are observed to be very shy and timid hyena cubs, who are afraid of all lions from both the [[Outlands]] and [[Pride Lands]], even after [[Kion]] exerts kindness and warmth toward them. They are very playful with their clan mates. They look up to Jasiri feeling safe in her presence even if in imminent danger.

== Role in the series ==
=== [[Lions of the Outlands]] ===
The young hyenas are seen playing with Madoa. Soon, Madoa catches sight of Jasiri walking toward them with Kion. Although Madoa greets Kion politely, Tunu and Wema hide behind a nearby stone. After Kion eventually notices them, he tries to greet them and gently coax them out, but they back down in fear. Madoa reveals that all they have ever known are bad lions, hence the apprehension. She then explains the need for their watering hole to be returned for the sake of the young ones in particular.

After Kion defeats [[Zira]], and returns the watering hole back to [[Jasiri's Clan]], Tunu and Wema are once again playing together. When Wema notices Kion she runs over to him, with Tunu following her. Noticing the two youngsters, Kion tries once again to kindly reach out to them, believing them to be unafraid of him now. But after taking a swift glance toward each other, the pair once again hide behind a nearby rock. Jasiri tells Kion to take it as a compliment because he really is fierce after all.

==== [[Rescue in the Outlands]] ====
In the Outlands, Jasiri plays with Tunu and Wema. Janja watches from afar and orders his clan to attack the trio. The clan launches their attack, and Jasiri desperately attempts to protect the pups from harm. In the midst of the fight, Janja forces the three into an open steam vent, where lava is steadily rising to the surface. As the clan gathers round, preventing any attempt at escape, Jasiri's sister Madoa resolves to get Kion's help.

Presently, the Lion Guard arrives and engages in a fight with the hyenas, and Janja and his clan are effectively steered away from the edge of the steam vent. With the hyenas out of the way, Kion orders Beshte to push a large rock into the lava flow, which allows Jasiri, Tunu, and Wema to clamber to safety.

Later, Jasiri thanks the Lion Guard for their help and expresses concern over how overzealous Janja and his clan had been. Kion blames the dry season for Janja's odd behavior, and the two groups depart, with Jasiri returning the pups to their clan.
