He and [[Suga Mama]]'s pet poodle, [[Puff]], don't get along very well, but like Puff, [[BeBe & CeCe Proud]] enjoy playing with him.

==Role in the series==
Coco is first seen arriving with his mistress, [[Maureen Parker]] and her family, the Parkers to the Proud family's home for the twins, [[BeBe & CeCe Proud]]'s baptism. Then, a small squabble begins between Coco and [[Suga Mama]]'s pet poodle, [[Puff]] as they growl at each other.

Later, Coco is seen the next day playing touch football with the Parkers against the Prouds. After the Parkers lose the first round, they use Coco to help them win the second round with a touchdown; much against the Prouds' rules since they consider it cheating.

==Trivia==
*During the scene where Coco and Puff at each other, Coco is seen wearing purple pants as well when in fact, he never wears pants at all.
