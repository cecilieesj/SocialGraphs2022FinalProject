==Background==
===Personality===
He is a very loyal and faithful horse that tends to get frightened rather easily. In the first movie, he becomes afraid of a loud sound from the burning village and gets startled when a burnt staircase collapses, then disappears during the avalanche. In the sequel, he gets scared of being grabbed unexpectedly and becomes disgusted after [[Yao, Ling, and Chien Po|Yao]] kisses him, then disappears once again for some time. Besides that, he is usually a calm, quiet horse and is very well-tamed.

===Physical appearance===
He is based on the traditional [[China|Chinese]] horse models. He is white with gray dapples, a short black mane, and a docked tail. He is always seen with a saddle and bridle.

==Trivia==
*He doesn't have a given name in the movie.
*His dapples form a [[Hidden Mickey]].
*He has white hair, which represents the traditionally "masculine" [[Wikipedia:Yin and yang|yang]]; whereas [[Khan|Mulan's horse]] has black hair, which represents the traditionally "feminine" [[Wikipedia:Yin and yang|yin]].
*His tail is styled like Shang's topknot.
