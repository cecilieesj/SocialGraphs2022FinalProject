'''Terra Snapdragon''' is the Head Witch of the Plant Coven in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
Terra is one of the longest serving Coven Heads, with an ongoing career that spans at least three decades. As the Head Witch of the Plant Coven, she is an integral part to [[Emperor Belos]]'s plans for the Day of Unity and is tasked with recruiting new witches to her coven.

===Personality===
On the outside, Terra seems calm and jovial with a grandmotherly sort of charm, but on the inside, she is merciless and enjoys toying with her prey, revealing a sadistic and manipulative personality. She is also entirely loyal to Emperor Belos. She was even more outwardly ruthless and critical when she was younger, but still maintained her false friendliness and maternal charm.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Magic:''' Like all witches, her connection to magic comes from a sac of magic bile attached to her heart. Having earned the rank of coven leader, she is undoubtedly very powerful.
**'''Plant magic:''' As leader of the Plant Coven, Terra can cast spells that allow her to control and manipulate plant life. She can even use her plant magic abilities as a means of transportation.
**'''Mind control''': She can summon a special plant and use its leaves to create a tea that either brainwashes others or at least maintains an existing brainwashed state. Unbeknownst to her, Raine used bard magic (changing the chemistry of the tea via whistling) to secretly neutralize the tea to maintain their cover as a spy.
**'''Plant travel:''' Terra can use vines or other plant matter to travel underground or through water.

==Trivia==
*The name "Terra" is Latin for "earth", a word which is present in most romantic languages, such as Italian and Portuguese. The term is derived from the name of the primordial goddess of the Earth in Roman mythology. A snapdragon is a genus of plants known as Antirrhinum.
