==Background Information==
Pim is a troublemaker and thus hates goody-two-shoes [[Debbie Berwick]]. She is a mischievous girl who was constantly up to no good and was even prone to megalomania. She is especially known for liking to pull pranks on people, mainly on Phil, Debbie, and [[Neil Hackett|Vice Principal Hackett]]. She tries to make Phil miserable whenever she could. She hung out with [[Lil Danny Dawkins]]. She also tries to avoid Debbie and Candida. Repeatedly in the show, she looks for ways to dominate the world. Even though she often causes trouble for Phil, and has a tough attitude, she also cares about him but keeps it hidden most of the time. She is two years younger than him.
