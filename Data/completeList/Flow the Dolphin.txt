==Appearances==
===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
Flow first appears in the episode ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Rescue|Jake's Never Land Rescue]]''. When Jake asked Marina and Stormy how to restore [[Cubby]]'s map, the young mermaids told him that only the magical ink of the [[Golden Squid]] was capable of doing so. To reach the Squid, the young mermaids summoned Flow to escort Jake through the depths of the Never Sea. All the while, Jake wore a snorkel shell to enable him to breathe underwater.

When Jake and the dolphin reached the squid, Jake asked the creature if it would lend any ink for the map. Alas, it only made the squid angry and chase after the two. But the dolphin proved to be much faster and outran the squid. When the squid got stuck between the rocks, Flow moved Jake close enough to tickle the squid with her tail fluke. The squid laughed so hard, it released a trail of ink.
