'''Lionel '''is the servant of [[King Maximilian]], [[Queen Constantina]], and [[Prince Christopher]] and a supporting character of the [[1997]] film ''[[Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella]]''.

== Role in the film ==
When Prince Christopher returns from a secret venture out into the kingdom, a frantic Lionel reprimands him for leaving yet again as he helps him get dressed in his royal clothes. Although he may believe he was perfectly safe, Lionel isn't so sure King Maximilian and Queen Constantina would agree with his clandestine outings. He's even more upset about his repeatedly having to lie to the King and Queen to cover up for the Prince, even going as far as to wish the Prince would just kill him upfront, as his fate for covering up, if he were to be caught, would be much worse.

As Prince Christopher meets with King Maxmilian and Queen Constantina, Lionel stands behind a curtain and happens to overhear their conversation about the ball they are planning to throw in order to find him a bride. After Prince Christopher exasperatedly walks out, Queen Constantina catches sight of a part of Lionel's jacket peeking out from the curtain and brings him in. He attempts to tell her that Prince Christopher doesn't seem happy about the ball, but she interrupts him with an order to write down their proclamation. Soon he is proceeding throughout the market informing the kingdom about the ball and ordering food and other necessities.

On the day of the ball, Lionel is helping to decorate the ballroom by hanging garlands of flowers from its walls when he is nearly knocked off his perch as an angry Prince Christopher confronts King Maximilian. Lionel uses his diplomacy skills to arrange a compromise: Prince Christopher will go to the ball, but if he does not find a bride there he will be allowed to find his true love in his own way without any interference from King Maximilian no matter how long it takes. Queen Constantina reluctantly agrees after King Maximilian convinces her that it's fair, and Prince Christopher is so happy he kisses her, hugs King Maximilian, and gives Lionel a grateful pat before he takes his leave. Lionel reassures King Maximilian and Queen Constantina that he is sure Prince Christopher will find a bride at the ball, but Queen Constantina says he "will feel it in his bones if he doesn't" and slaps him off his ladder.

At the ball, Lionel dutifully delivers eligible maidens for Prince Christopher to dance with, but though he is trying to be as polite as he can he is clearly unmoved by any of them. Lionel is soon cornered by the [[Cinderella's Stepmother|Stepmother]], who unsuccessfully does her best to charm him into giving her daughters, [[Calliope]] and [[Minerva]], special preference. She then tries to flirt with Lionel, even going as far as to suggest the two of them hook up as a couple. Lionel initially seems to agree, but then he rebukes her, by claiming that the only something he wants between them, is a continent.

When its Minerva's turn to dance with Prince Christopher, she tries to get him to appreciate her poetry so forcefully he frantically signals to Lionel to take her away. Knowing he's no match against her strength, he, in turn, signals the guards. Even so, she does her best to cling to him before she is dragged away.Â Calliope dances with him next, and she laughs so hysterically at everything he says she snorts uncontrollably. She, too, is quickly taken away by Lionel, and like Minerva, she does her best to cling to Prince Christopher before she is dragged away. Unnerved by these experiences, he speeds up the rate of exchanging partners to the point where Lionel tries to bring each new girl as fast as he can. Prince Christopher even absent-mindedly dances with him before glancing up and catching sight of [[Cinderella (1997 character)|Cinderella]].

Later that evening, Lionel is snatched into a dance by the Stepmother as an excuse to get close to Prince Christopher and Cinderella. She keeps shoving Lionel's head out of the way in order to get a better view, at one point accidentally shoving him so hard he falls flat on the floor. Not missing a beat, she snags a series of other dance partners and makes a beeline for Cinderella, who panics and escapes into the palace gardens, nearly stepping on Lionel, who's still lying on the floor. Prince Christopher, worried for Cinderella, follows her and ''does'' step on Lionel, flattening him once again.

When the palace clock strikes midnight, Cinderella runs as fast as she can out of the palace. Prince Chistopher tries to chase after her, but Lionel briefly slows him down as does the rest of the crowd. Unable to catch up to her, he is left with only her [[Glass Slipper|glass slipper]] as a clue to her identity.

The next day, Prince Christopher hasn't slept or eaten since the ball. Lionel reports that no one seems to know who the mysterious girl is or where she's from. Undaunted, Prince Christopher is determined to find her if he has to have every eligible maiden in the kingdom try on the glass slipper to find whom it fits. Queen Constantina orders Lionel to do as he says, and so they embark on their quest. As Prince Christopher observes, Lionel places the glass slipper on a series of feet, none of which fit. Eventually, they find themselves at the Stepmother's house. Calliope tries it on first and pretends that it's a perfect fit, but Lionel sees through her charade and tickles her heel (which pokes out from it) before slapping her foot away. Minerva then sticks her foot in Lionel's face, who chokes a little from the odor. He tries to put the glass slipper on her foot, but it clearly doesn't fit her either. An irate Minerva puts Lionel into a headlock, yelling that it fit perfectly at the ball and that he must have shrunk it. Yanking himself free from her hold, Lionel asks the Stepmother if there are any other eligible maidens in the house. She herself sits down and presents her foot. Lionel believes she is too old, but she snatches the glass slipper from him, puts it on, and it fits.

A stunned Lionel is at a loss for words, but Prince Christopher refuses to accept it. The Stepmother's elated shrieks turn to ones of pain as she yells that the glass slipper is cutting off her circulation. Bashed by her insults, Lionel nevertheless hurriedly wrenches it off with Calliope and Minerva's help. Prince Christopher asks if they're ''sure'' there are no more eligible maidens in the house, and they deny it while quickly and conspicuously attempting to block the locked kitchen doors. Lionel asks the Stepmother for the key, and after they stare each other down he glances away as she very reluctantly reaches into her decolletage to produce it. He surreptitiously cleans it with his handkerchief before using it to unlock the doors, revealing nothing but an ordinary kitchen. Prince Christopher prepares to leave but is stopped by the Stepmother, who absolutely begs him to take Calliope or Minerva as his bride. Meanwhile, Lionel struggles to reclaim the glass slipper from the much-taller Calliope. Losing patience, Prince Christopher orders the chaos to stop and marches out the door, running right into Cinderella. Wishing to place the glass slipper on her foot himself, he silently asks Lionel for it. As it fits perfectly, her stepmother screams in despair and collapses into Calliope and Minerva's arms. Lionel, with no small amount of satisfaction, tells her to be quiet.

Soon enough, Lionel is happily attending Prince Christopher and Cinderella's wedding, smiling as they share a kiss.
