'''Fentruck Stimmel''' is a dark green-skinned foreign exchange student from ''[[Disney's Doug]]''. He is from a fictional country called Yakestonia. He is not prominent in the Nickelodeon show until the [[Disney]] version. In the Disney Christmas episode, he thinks Christmas is Halloween, and Halloween is Easter, so he gets his holidays mixed up. He was known for his bizarre cultural greetings and other traditions. For instance, when greeting someone he would place his hand under his armpit and make "toot" gestures, while stomping his right foot and saying "Zwooba, zwooba, zwooba!". At one point, he gave [[Doug Funnie|Doug]] a jar of fresh Yakestonian air as a gift. He is voiced by Fred Newman.
