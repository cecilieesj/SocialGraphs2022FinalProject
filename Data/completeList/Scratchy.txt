==Background==
===Physical Description===
Scratchy is an old-timing junkyard dog like [[Sparky (Lady and the Tramp)|Sparky]] who appears to have fleas on him all the time. He is a scrawny brown mongrel with a tan belly, dark brown ears, a few messy hairs stringing on the top of his head, and a slight loss of fur on his left arm and tail. He also has wound burns on his right shoulder and right hind leg, leading to his hunched posture.

===Personality===
He doesn't talk or do much else other than scratch himself each time he has fleas and help his friends out with something. He eventually leaves [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]] with the other junkyard dogs, minus [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]], and gets adopted by a family along with [[Sparky (Lady and the Tramp)|Sparky]].

==Trivia==
*Scratchy doesn't talk, thus making him the only silent junkyard dog.
*His name was revealed in a DVD/[[Disney Blu-ray|Blu-ray]] bonus feature.
