'''Herbert P. Bear''' (full name: '''Herbert Percival Bear, Esquire'''), or just '''Herbert''', is a polar bear and the main antagonist of ''[[Club Penguin]]''. He is also one of the few main characters who is not a penguin.

Unlike real-life polar bears, Herbert hates cold weather, cannot swim and is a vegetarian. Since his first appearance, Herbert has been trying to make a warm paradise out of [[w:c:clubpenguin:Club Penguin Island (location)|Club Penguin Island]], to live in peace and quiet. Each scheme he comes up with, fails, but he hopes that one day a scheme of his will work so he can destroy Club Penguin's environment.

==History==
Herbert was born in the Arctic Circle, aging around the cold, which he hates, so he eventually abandoned his home and headed out to look for a better place to live. He traveled on a small iceberg, but the ocean currents carried him all the way to [[w:c:clubpenguin:Club Penguin Island (location)|Club Penguin Island]], which coincidentally was on the other side of the world. He tried to paddle away from Club Penguin since it was covered in snow, but he tipped his iceberg (which further supported the rumor of tipping Club Penguin's Iceberg) and fell off into the water. Unable to swim, Herbert tried to survive, and then he was rescued by a crab named [[Klutzy]] who heard Herbert's cries and he soon befriended, despite liking the penguins and [[puffle|puffles]] unlike Herbert.

Over time, he soon grew to despise people. Klutzy was caught but he got away in the Questions for a Crab mission. In the sixth mission, he traps the player penguin agent and tells his monologue about his time on Club Penguin and how he got there, finishing by revealing his ongoing plan and leaves. Herbert, along with Klutzy, try to cut the Ski Lodge in one of his schemes to both keep warm and harm the penguins. After the player penguin agent defeats him for the first time, by making them both sink into the frozen lake behind the Ski Lodge, along with the woodchopper, Klutzy rescues Herbert from drowning again, and Herbert shouts at the player penguin agent by using their spy phone to call Gary's spy phone. If players click on the letter in G's pocket in the newspaper (April 11, 2008 edition) and you turn all the puffles black then you will see a letter Herbert has written to the players saying that "time" is about to run out, resulting in mission 7 in which he makes the clock malfunction by taking out certain parts of it, including the main gear.

He also steals your [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Spy_Phone Spy Phone] when he traps you in a cage in Mission 6 (The cage is in a cave that Herbert and [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Klutzy Klutzy] live in). You used that same cave for shelter in Mission #2 except Herbert renovates it to be more of a living place).

In Mission 8, he uses his new giant drill creation to dig holes in the underground, resulting in quakes that damage Club Penguin, and eventually drills into the Boiler Room then tries to steal its namesake boiler, but the player penguin agent arrives, spotting him red-handed, and after they talk to each other, Herbert hits the boiler out of rage, making it starting to leak, then he escapes, thinking it was about to explode, and gets lost in his own tunnels.

In Mission 9, agents locate his secret woodland base at the other side of the frozen pond behind the Ski Lodge. Following Gary's orders, the player penguin agent hides a camera over there, and they spy on Herbert together until he soon discovers the camera.

In Mission 10, Herbert tries to steal a Golden [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Puffle Puffle] from the Night Club, not knowing it is a fake. A trap is set for him when he tries to get it and is caught. Unfortunately, he tricks [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rookie Rookie], saying that he requests to make one last call. When Rookie gives him the phone, Herbert uses the teleport button to escape. It is unknown where he went. However, he left behind some type of seeds.

In [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_11 Mission 11], he hacks into the PSA data and nearly reveals it to the whole island. On his computer that he stole from [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Gary%27s_Room Gary's Room], he was about to reveal the secret of the PSA, when the agent pulled out the plug of the computer. Then he teleports a 'gift' and the agent to the HQ. The 'gift' turns out to be a popcorn time bomb. The agent, along with Rookie, Dot, and Gary come out safely but he blasts the HQ and Sport Shop with the time-bomb.

His ultimate plan in Club Penguin is to terrorize all [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin Penguins]' lives and finally use the resources on Club Penguin (including trees, buildings, inventions, Hot Sauce, etc.) to become warm. Another reason is to destroy the environment, as revealed by [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rookie Rookie].

==Herbert's Inventions==
:''See [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Herbert%27s_Inventions List of Herbert's Inventions]''

Herbert P. Bear has made machines to arouse chaos in [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Island (location) Club Penguin Island]. He has made a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Mechanical_Woodchopper Mechanical Woodchopper], an [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Earthquake_Driller Earthquake Driller], and he put together the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Electromagnets#Electromagnet_3000 Electromagnet 3000]. He also created the "[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Popcorn_Explosion Popcorn Bomb]" which destroys the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin_Secret_Agency PSA]'s [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/HQ HQ]. He also rebuilt the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Proto-Bot_10000 Ultimate Proto-Bot 10000].

==Trivia==
*Before the events that took place in ''[http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Herbert%27s_Revenge Herbert's Revenge]'', Herbert didn't know about the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Elite_Penguin_Force Elite Penguin Force].
*He was the "Yeti [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin Penguin]" in the April 1, 2010 [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Times newspaper].
*Herbert was in a high security cave, hibernating in the Tallest Mountain before escaping when the island tipped in January 2011. He apparently ended up in the Wilderness as seen in Puffle Trouble.
*It is probable that Herbert crossed from the Arctic Circle to Club Penguin by the Atlantic Ocean, as he says "The climate did get warmer", meaning the pass through the Equator (Central America). Also, the position of the island is down below Argentina, South America.
*It is possible that he was the one that revealed the EPF's identity to the Club Penguin Times as said by the Director in the very same issue they were revealed as the source mentions the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin_Secret_Agency PSA] vanished off the island nearly one year ago and he was the only one other than EPF and former PSA agents to know about it and it was mentioned by the source of the letter.
*Apparently, helping save the island meant nothing to him because revealed in a new EPF message, he said that did nothing to make him nicer. It seems now as if Herbert will never stop until he gets the island.
*Herbert's plan is to warm up Club Penguin to make it into his own little tropical island resort for him and Klutzy, but he's trying to get rid of the EPF so that all he has to get rid of are ''useless penguins'' as he says.
*Herbert sometimes was good and be most strong than ever.
*Herbert was caught by the EPF during the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Snow_Race Great Snow Race] in ''Operation: Hibernation''.
