{{Quote|You are all weirdos!|Sam the Eagle}}
'''Sam the Eagle''' is a blue bald American eagle Muppet who is extremely patriotic. He frequently tries to inject culture into the Muppets' productions with little or no success.

==Appearances==
Sam remained active beyond ''The Muppet Show'', appearing in every Muppet movie to date. In ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'', Sam played the young Scrooge's headmaster. In ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'', he played Samuel Arrow.

In ''Muppets Tonight'', he hosts a segment called "The Eagle's Nest".

Sam is the only Muppet character that made a crossover appearance on ''The Animal Show'' as a special guest in the episode "Bald Eagle" where Jake the Polar Bear invited him to talk about eagles. Sam was disgusted on how eagles were in the wild and left. Later on in the show, after Armstrong the Chicken Hawk stormed off when he was scheduled to sing about eagles, Sam the Eagle returned, telling Stinky and Jake that he doesn't have enough money to get his car out of the parking garage. Jake says that they will take care of it if he sings a song. Sam the Eagle sings the song "I'm an Eagle" in front of some of the background animals. Armstrong comes in during the song stating that eagles have been upstaging him and Sam states that he will mention how good chicken hawks are in his song, which he does.

Concerned about his thinning feathers – he is a bald eagle, after all – he recently started using Propecia, as shown in ''It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie'', which results in him having extra feathers on his scalp. The extra feathers are gone by the end of the film as he has apparently stopped using Propecia.

In ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', he portrayed a guard at Emerald City working for the Wizard.

In June 2008, Sam appeared in the viral video "Stars & Stripes FOREVER!" with [[Animal]], [[Beaker]], [[Bobo the Bear]], [[the Swedish Chef]] and [[Crazy Harry]].

Sam briefly appears in the December 2008 special ''[[A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa]]'' to deliver a public service announcement stating that reading other people's mail is a federal offense, discouraging [[Fozzie Bear]] and [[Gonzo]] from reading the letters that were addressed to Santa Claus.

In Muppet Vision*3D, he creates an act called "A Salute to All Nations (But Mostly America)".

In the 2011 film, ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'', Sam appears working as a news anchor, declaring "everything stinks" on WGF News, a thinly-veiled parody of [[Wikipedia:Fox News Channel|Fox News Channel]]. He also sings "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" in a barbershop quartet skit with [[Rowlf]], [[Beaker]], and [[Link Hogthrob]] during The Muppet Telethon.

He is also known for his catchphrase "It is the American Way," although he did have to change it slightly in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' to take into account the setting (the story taking place in Great Britain), when Gonzo/Charles Dickens, being forced to break character of the narrator, has to point out in his ear that the story took place in Britain, not America, after he made the mistake of using his usual catchphrase. He was originally going to have a slightly bigger role in the movie, where he sang [[Chairman of the Board]], but this ended up cut by the film's release, although it can still be found in the soundtrack.

Sam appears in ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' as an agent of the CIA, where along with [[Jean Pierre Napoleon]], a French Interpol agent trying to solve the case of the plot to steal the Crown Jewels.

Sam appears prominently in the 2015 ABC mockumentary series ''The Muppets''. Here, he begins to develop a crush on [[Janice]], which brings out his immature side. Most notably, before Christmas, he attempts to get a kiss from Janice under the mistletoe he has hung in the office, but misses his chance when [[Chip (The Muppets)|Chip]] interrupts him and makes conversation as Janice walks past. However, at the end of the episode, Janice praises Sam for talking to Chip, knowing he has a difficult time making friends (unaware that Chip had actually ruined Sam's attempt to woo her), and kisses Sam on the cheek, leaving him stunned.
