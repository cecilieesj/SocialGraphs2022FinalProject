'''Hathaway Browne''' is a character from [[Pleasure Island (Downtown Disney)|Pleasure Island]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Hathaway Browne was an American aviator during the early half of the 20th century.  He was extremely handsome and charismatic in-addition to having been something of a lady's man.  Due to his suave persona and good looks, Browne found work as the spokesperson and mascot for the, "Jinkies" cereal brand.

Prior to the [[December 31|New Year's Eve]] of [[1931]], Hathaway was brought in as a member of the, "Adventurers Club", a society of globetrotters which was founded by the wealthy [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]], a former member of the much more stuffy [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers|''Society of Explorers and Adventurers'']].  Every New Year's Eve, the club partook in a competition known as the Balderdash Cup to see who had the best adventuring story and from 1931 to [[1936]], Hathaway was the winner of this award.

In [[1937]], Hathaway's winning-streak was broken by a new member named [[Emil Bleehall]].  Hathaway would also befriend one [[Trader Sam]], an affiliate of the Adventurers Club.  At some point following 1937, Hathaway went on an expedition with fellow members [[Pamelia Perkins]], [[Colonel Critchlow Sunchbench]], Prof. Fletcher Hodges, and Emil Bleehall.  During their absence they left many possessions from their base in [[Lake Buena Vista]] in the safekeeping of Trader Sam while Hathaway only left Sam a box of Jinkes cereal in an act of narcissism.

In the early [[1940]]<nowiki/>s, Trader Sam began to sell Browne enchanted alcoholic brews to use as plane-fuel for his plane, "The Moth".  Hathaway would frequent Trader Sam's bars as a result of this.  In [[1941]], Pleasure Island was destroyed by a hurricane and the Adventurers Club seemingly had to relocate.  In the 1940s, Browne and other Adventurers Club members befriended a fellow-aviator in the form of one [[Jock Lindsey]], a member of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.  Browne attended the [[1955]] opening of Lindsey's bar in the [[Florida]] town of [[Disney Springs (town)|Disney Springs]] and was a frequent customer of it.

==== Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar ====
Browne is featured alongside his plane on two photographs framed in this bar with a message from him to Trader Sam.

==== Trader Sam's Grog Grotto ====
In this bar is a photograph of Hathaway Browne with a message to Sam reading, "''There is a man, a handsome man. As adventurous as he can be. And our friend Trader Sam, actually knows this man… it’s me''".

===[[Jungle Cruise]]===
In [[2021]], the crashed plane at the Magic Kingdom version of the attraction was given lettering reading "'''The Amazing Hathaway Browne'''".

== Trivia ==

* Hathaway's plane, "The Gipsy Moth" is named for the real life 1920s plane ''de Havilland DH.60 Moth''.  This name is controversial as it is named after a racial-slur directed at Romani people and used as an offensive pejorative term implying sneakiness or criminal activities.  Ironically, the plane implied to be the moth was added into the Jungle Cruise amidst a refurbishment supposedly for removing racism from the attraction.
*[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] plays the part of Hathaway in the ''[[Epic Mickey]]: Tales of the Wasteland'' story "The Rubbish Cup", an homage to the Adventurers Club.
