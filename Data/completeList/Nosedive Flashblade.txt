==Biography==
Nosedive Flashblade is [[Wildwing Flashblade|Wildwing]]'s younger brother who initially was not intended to be part of [[Canard Thunderbeak|Canard]]'s resistance; however, Wildwing makes Canard take Nosedive with them: "If you want me," says Wildwing, "Then my brother's part of the deal." Once they reach Earth, Nosedive becomes an official member of the team, both on the hockey team and the crime fighting team. Nosedive is by far the team's most impulsive and immature member who is similar to Michelangelo of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''. His character may have been influenced by Michelangelo—the two series were initially penned by the same writer. Nosedive is more childish and easy-going than the other Ducks, and often looks toward his older brother for support and protection. Nosedive can be very likable, making friends with teammate [[Check "Grin" Hardwing|Grin]], and humans [[Thrash & Mookie|Thrash and Mookie]]. He wears body armor, but not as much as Wildwing. He usually uses a Puck Blaster and rides a Duckcycle. His jersey number is 33.
