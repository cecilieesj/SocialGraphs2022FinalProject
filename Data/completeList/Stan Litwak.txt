'''Stanley "Stan" Litwak''', or better known as '''Mr. Litwak''', is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2012]] animated feature film, ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'' and its [[2018]] [[Ralph Breaks the Internet|sequel]]. 

==Background==
Mr. Litwak is the owner of [[Litwak's Arcade]], where the film takes place. He isn't aware of anything that goes on in [[Game Central Station]]. Because Litwak depends on a customer base for his livelihood, he must keep gamers, such as [[Moppet Girl]], satisfied. Should customers complain of glitches and the games cannot be repaired, Mr. Litwak withdraws it from his arcade, leaving those game characters "unplugged", their version of homeless and unemployed. The same goes for games which have not generated a high level of customer support. The flip side is that should a game be both functional and popular, it stays at Litwak's Arcade, and thus the game characters are assured of being "plugged".

Litwak is shown to be a "realist" element to the film; a man in the real world trying to own and operate his business. He does, however, feel an emotional connection to the consoles and characters (likely due to working with many of them for so many years). When he forcibly unplugged both ''[[TurboTime]]'' and ''Roadblasters'', Litwak was noticeably hurt. When ''[[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Fix-It Felix Jr.]]'' no longer had its "malfunction", meaning it no longer needed to be unplugged, Litwak was unabashedly overjoyed.

===''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''===
In the film, Mr. Litwak is the friendly owner and operator of Litwak's Arcade. When one of his [[Moppet Girl|customers]] tells him that ''[[Fix-It Felix Jr. (video game)|Fix-It Felix Jr.]]'' is malfunctioning, due to [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]]'s quest for a [[Medal of Heroes|medal]], he takes a closer look at the console screen and noticed all the [[Nicelanders]] in a panic, before refunding the girl's money. The girl asks him what will happen to the game and he tells her that someone will have to take a look at the game tomorrow, but if they cannot fix it then the game will have to be unplugged. He labels the machine as "out of order."

In [[Fix-It Felix Jr.|Felix]]'s story of Turbo and [[King Candy]]'s story of the fate of ''Sugar Rush'', players (two boys and Moppet girl, respectively) call Mr. Litwak, who places "out of order" signs to the games gone wrong (''RoadBlasters ''and ''[[TurboTime]]'', respectively).

The next day, when he finds out that the game's working correctly, he's quite pleased as it means he won't have to unplug it at all.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
Six years after the events of the first film, Litwak purchases a Wi-Fi router for the arcade, and plugs it into [[Game Central Station]], which links the video game characters to the digital world of the [[Internet]] in which the Surge Protector warns the video game characters that going to the Internet world can be very dangerous. During a gameplay of Sugar Rush, two customers [[Swati and Nafisa]] tell Mr. Litwak that Vanellope chosen as their roster is not working properly (not because of her ability, but because of a fight with the steering wheel moving itself when Ralph created a new path to help Vanellope win), he then attempts to put the wheel back in place in which the part ultimately breaks. He then plans on ordering a new part for Sugar Rush, but tells the customers involved with the incident that TobiKomi, the video game company that made ''Sugar Rush'', went out of business years ago and the last steering wheel was only on [[Ebay|eBay]] when Swati shows Litwak the item being sold. He then explains that buying the replacement of the steering wheel is very expensive and thus cannot afford it. After telling the customers about this, he then unplugs the game, leaving Vanellope and all the other residents of Sugar Rush homeless.

Meanwhile, Litwak then sets up the Wi-Fi network for the arcade linking to the Wi-Fi router he purchased, activating the digital world of the Internet where Ralph and Vanellope see an avatar of Litwak himself entering the Internet world. Throughout the events of the film, Ralph and Vanellope manage to earn enough money to get the steering wheel for Sugar Rush before it gets unplugged and removed by Litwak.

==Trivia==
*He is seen throughout the film dressed like a football referee. This is also the work uniform of game technicians at the franchise Dave & Buster's, who check to see that arcade cabinets are fully functional, as well as replenish games that dispense prize tickets when the supply is exhausted.
*His appearance and dress also seems to be a reference to Walter Day, the founder of Twin Galaxies, an organization that records world record high scores on arcade games.
*Mr. Litwak is the only named human in the film.
*In ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'', Mr. Litwak's name is listed on his nametag as Stan. In the sequel, it's listed as Del.
*His line from the original film "I'll have someone look at it tomorrow but if he can't fix it, it might be time to put old Ralph and Felix out to pasture, like my nana." when the ''Fix-It Felix. Jr.'' game is malfunctioning presumably implies that his nana is very likely to be deceased.
*His Wifi password is highsc0re.
*His first name is never revealed throughout either the first or second film.
