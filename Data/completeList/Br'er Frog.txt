== Appearances ==

=== ''[[Song of the South]]'' ===
Br'er Frog appeared fishing in this film before getting upset at [[Br'er Rabbit]] when he freed a fish he'd caught and stored in a can during the "[[How Do You Do?]]" sequence. After the song, he proceeded to interact with [[Uncle Remus]], disapproving of the rabbit's recklessness. During a reprise of "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" at the end of the film, Br'er Frog appears where Br'er Rabbit passes through him to join with the children just as he happily joins skipping around with the children, followed by a number of animated animals who join alongside him.

== Disney Parks ==

=== [[Splash Mountain]] ===
Br'er Frog notably appeared in the attraction Splash Mountain where he was voiced by actor [[James Avery]].  He first appeared in the beginning of the ride as a sort of host for the ride, being a grandfather whose grandchildren are pleading for him to tell them a story about Br'er Rabbit.  He was seen smoking a pipe on the ride's first lift-hill, introducing the attraction's story and filling in the niche of Uncle Remus.

Br'er Frog was later seen again within the ride itself, laying atop the back of Br'er Gator as the gator went fishing.  He sang the song "[[How Do You Do?]]" during this scene.  He could later be seen again alongside [[Saddlesore Swanson]] later on in the ride, playing a bass. He sang the song "[[Everybody's Got a Laughing Place]]" with the [[Pansy, Poppy, and Petunia|possums]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] version; additionally for the finale version, he sang "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]] with a turkey.

=== [[Mark Twain Riverboat]] ===
Br'er Frog had a narration segment on the Mark Twain Riverboat in [[Disneyland]] while passing Splash Mountain on the [[Rivers of America]].  The captain of the Mark Twain turns to Br'er Frog to explain the people logs passing over [[Chickapin Hill|the mountain]] to which he responds, "I told Br’er Rabbit he better mend his ways! I told him [[Br'er Fox|Br’er Fox]] and [[Br'er Bear|Br’er Bear]] gonna toss him over the falls, all the way to that there [[Briar Patch|briar patch]]. Huh, funny thing is, folks seem to love splashin’ down that big old drop".
