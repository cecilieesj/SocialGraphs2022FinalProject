}}'''Fresh-Up Freddie''' is a character created by Disney as an advertising spokesman for 7-Up in [[1957]]. He was voiced by [[Paul Frees]]. He was eventually replaced by another 7-Up mascot named Spot.

==Creation==
Leo Burnett Agency created the Freddy ad campaign for 7-Up and its sponsorship of Disneyâ€™s prime time [[Zorro]] TV series. The Disney studio made the commercials and designed the character (essentially a hybrid of [[Panchito]] and the [[Aracuan Bird]] from [[The Three Caballeros]]).

==History==
He gave viewers lessons about how to plan successful parties and picnics by having a plenty of 7-Up on hand. Fresh-Up Freddie often was dressed in human clothes. Freddie also appeared in Zorro 1957 series commercial intermissions. Here, he was put against Pete the Cat. Fresh-Up Freddie also had a minor merchandise of his own.
