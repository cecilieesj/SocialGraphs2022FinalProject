'''Big Mike'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398733/?ref_=tt_cl_t8</ref> is a minor character on the show ''[[Kim Possible]]''. He was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]].<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Kim-Possible/Big-Mike/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004951/</ref>

==History==
He is a regular in detention at [[Middleton High School]]. He appears to get along well with his other detention mates, [[Vinnie]] and [[Junior (Kim Possible)|Junior]]

Big Mike doesn't speak much. Until he helped [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] with [[Shego]] he did little more than growl or speak in single words.

Big Mike is a very sensitive and loyal person. He whimpered when it looked like Kim was going to get blown up and sat on Shego when she tried to stop [[Ron Stoppable]] from removing the nanotick.

He also appears to have befriended the cheerleaders as he was seen socializing with [[Tara]] and [[Hope]] during a school dance.

==Appearances==
*''[[Tick-Tick-Tick]]''
*''[[Queen Bebe]]''

==Trivia==
*Most of Mike's appearances do not show above his shoulders, so his face was only seen twice.
*Big Mike appears to be afraid of rodents, as he jumped onto his chair and screamed when "escaped mutant vermin" Rufus infiltrated detention to spring Kim.
