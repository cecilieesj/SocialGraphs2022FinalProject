'''Gloria Estefan''' is a baby penguin character who first appeared on ''The Muppets'' in the episode "Swine Song." Miss Piggy adopts it during her trip to Argentina between episodes 10 and 11 of ''The Muppets''. He is given his own poncho to wear, and has bonded with Uncle Deadly, who has become his unofficial guardian. He enjoys martinis, ice cream, and throwing up on suede shoes.

Gloria Estefan's gender is unclear as Piggy uses male pronouns, while Uncle Deadly uses female pronouns in "Swine Song." In a promo for "Got Silk?," Uncle Deadly discusses Gloria Estefan and uses male pronouns. The penguin is named Gloria Estefan because it's the first Spanish name Piggy could think of.
