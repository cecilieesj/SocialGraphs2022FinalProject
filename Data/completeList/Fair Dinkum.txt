He is a koala who serves as ringmaster of the circus. He has an Australian accent. There are a few things that he is afraid of - heights (so he's scared of flying) and drowning in the water being a few of them.

==Trivia==
*His name comes from the Australian phrase, "''fair dinkum''".
*Fair Dinkum being afraid of heights could be considered ironic as in real life, koalas spend most of their days up in eucalyptus trees.
