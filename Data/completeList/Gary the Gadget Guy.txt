'''Gary the Gadget Guy''', commonly known as '''Agent G''', is an inventor in ''[[Club Penguin]]'' and the former owner of the Sports Shop. He likes wearing a white lab coat and his special curved spectacles, and enjoys eating Fish Dish pizza, and is often seen drinking coffee. Unlike other penguins, his eyes are merely two black dots obscured by his glasses. He is also a member of the [[Elite Penguin Force]].

==Inventions==
Some of his inventions are around the Club Penguin island for public use, but most were in the [[w:c:clubpenguin:Gadget Room|Gadget Room]], like the [[w:c:clubpenguin:Test Chamber|Test Chamber]] and the [[w:c:clubpenguin:Crab Translator 3000|Crab Translator 3000]]. Gary ends most of his inventions with a number like 1000, 2000 or 3000 (Mainly 3000). 1000 is the prototype and 3000 is the complete version. It is probable that his projects receive copious funding from the [[w:c:clubpenguin:PSA|P.S.A.]], since Gary would be unable to afford all required components without some source of financial support. Many of Gary's inventions have been proven as failures, such as the [[w:c:clubpenguin:Ski Lift 1000|Ski Lift 1000]], therefore suggesting that his inventing skill is not as good as he lets on.

==Trivia==
*Gary has at least six lab coats: one that he wears, another in the [[w:c:clubpenguin:Gadget Room|Gadget Room]], three on a coat hanger in his [[w:c:clubpenguin:Gary's Room|room]] and one on the ground next to the coat hanger.
*Gary has a collection of the first 32 ''Club Penguin'' hidden pins, which is missing the Soccer Ball pin.
*He likes extra cheese and anchovies on his pizza.
*When people make a big crowd around him, he will get nervous and try to hide or leave.
*Gary mentions that he likes coffee and mathematics.
*Gary wears an indestructible lab coat.
*Gary has been seen writing with both flippers.
