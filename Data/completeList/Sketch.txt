'''Sketch''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is a cool eighth-grader whom [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] ends up befriending after she is accidentally mistaken for someone in her class.

==Background==
Sketch is an eighth-grader who hangs out with her friends Poison, Tank and Hush and converse in "eighth-grade lingo" that is composed of shorthand and slang. In "[[Sketch 22]]", she mistakes [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] for another eighth-grader after seeing her perform a complex skating move and invites her into her social group. When she learns the truth, she casually accepts this and honors her for being true to her friends. Since then, she has been welcoming to Pepper Ann and, by extension, her friends. It is implied that Sketch's entire social clique is familiar with [[Stewart Walldinger]] due to his technical knowhow.

===Personality===
Sketch is "cool" and "chill" most of the time; acting very nonchalant about a variety of situations while also being mildly impressed with the occasional cool trick and talent. She speaks in an unusual slang that apparently other eighth graders speak. An example being, "We're cramming bio in the eighth-grade lounge after clock out. Want a with?" (translation: We're studying biology outside after school ends. Want to come?). Despite her cool status, she easily makes friends with everyone including seventh graders, as long they are cool in her eyes.

===Physical appearance===
Sketch is a tall, brown skinned girl with pink lips and large purple hair that covers one of her eyes and blue bead earrings. She wears a blue shirt that is ripped at the top and bares her midriff, a yellow bead necklace, wristbands, black torn pants and large pink boots.

==Trivia==
*For some odd reason, Sketch is absent in "[[P.A.'s Life in a Nutshell]]" despite her friends Poison and Hush making an appearance.
*Despite [[Craig Bean]] being in the same grade as Sketch, the two of them do not share any of the typical eighth-grade mannerisms.
