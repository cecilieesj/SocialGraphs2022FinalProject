'''Yan Lin ''' is [[Hay Lin]]'s grandmother and previous member of Guardian of the Veil. She kept the Heart of Kandrakar safe until it could be passed down to the next generation. She remains a big help to both the Guardians and the Council of Kandrakar. She owns the Silver Dragon where her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter [[Hay Lin]] works at.
As opposed to the comic book version, Yan Lin didn't die after the Guardians received their powers.
