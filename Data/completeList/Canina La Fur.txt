She is the [[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers|Rescue Rangers]]' client in the final two episodes, "[[A Chorus Crime]]" and "[[They Shoot Dogs, Don't They]]".
The first time she was their client was when her tap shoes were stolen by [[Professor Norton Nimnul]]. The scientist was using them to make a group of penguins tap dance a chorus.

The second was when she was shooting a commercial in Taxidermia. Her stand-in, [[Zsa Zsa Labrador]], attempted to get rid of Canina and take her place.

==Trivia==
*Her name sounds alike to Sasha La Fleur from ''All Dogs Go to Heaven''.
