===''[[Hocus Pocus 2]]''===
The film begins in [[Pre-1922|1653]] with The Witch Mother, scouring the sky in the form of a bird, as she watches over the town of Salem.

When the young [[Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]] enter the forbidden woods, she gazes them from afar. The young girls become fearful of their surroundings, and The Witch Mother, tries to lure them, with a [[Come Little Children|song]]. When [[Winifred Sanderson|Winifred]] beckons her [[Sarah Sanderson|sister]] back to her, The Witch Mother transforms into her human form before them, and grabs hold of Sarah by the neck. [[Mary Sanderson|Mary]] and Winifred attempt to rescue their sister, but The Witch Mother summons a gust of wind through her hand, to hold them back. The Witch Mother prepares to feed Sarah a [[Life Potion|potion]], but Winifred loosens her grip on Sarah. The Witch Mother grabs Winifred in retaliation, but fearfully let goes, upon sensing her. Upon taking a closer interrogation of Winifred, she comes to realize the young girl differs from the other children she's eaten, and is feared by the townspeople, due to her corruption. The Witch Mother takes note of young Winifred's temper, and on the raw power she holds. She informs the girls the woods they entered is feared upon, because it's a sacred space for witches such as herself, to charge their magic, and displays her powers before them. The Witch Mother declares Salem to be run by fools, and will one day be ruled by the likes of them. She gifts the girls a [[Manual of Witchcraft and Alchemy|spellbook]], and wishes Winifred a happy sixteenth birthday. As the girls explore the books pages, they come across a spell, entitled "Magicae Maxima", which makes a witch all-powerful, but The Witch Mother warns them against using such a spell, and has them promise not to do so. The Witch Mother comments on the luck they have in their relationship, as a witch needs her coven, for which she no longer has. Before Winifred can give her thanks, The Witch Mother disappears before them.

In [[2022]], [[Becca]], [[Izzy (Hocus Pocus)|Izzy]], and [[Cassie Traske|Cassie]] defeat the newly-risen Sanderson sisters, while The Witch Mother flies above them.
