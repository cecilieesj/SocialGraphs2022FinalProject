'''Sprites '''are magical creatures that appear in the television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

Sprites are small fairies that have bug antennae and butterfly wings and wear pants, shirts, and shoes. They live in a Sprite Village in [[New Jersey]] woods.

==History==
Two Sprites were possibly killed or captured by [[the Jersey Devil]] in the beginning of "[[The Long Weekend]]". A Male Sprite tells [[Jake Long|Jake]], [[Trixie Carter|Trixie]], and [[Arthur "Spud" P. Spudinski|Spud]] to come with him to show the Sprite village and tell them about the Great Evil will arrive. An Elder Sprite says that the Stars tell the Sprites that in 100 years the Evil will arrive and attack the Sprites for seven consecutive nights. The second Elder Sprite says the Evil is the Jersey Devil who will raid the supplies and pillage their food stores leaving them to starve during the Winter Season. After the Jersey Devil falls over a cliff and dies, the Sprites make a hero statue of Jake's Dad, saying that he is their greatest hero after the Jersey Devil was killed. The Sprites appeared in "[[The Long Weekend]]" and "[[The Hunted]]".
