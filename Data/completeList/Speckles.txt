'''Speckles''' is the hidden true main antagonist later the supporting character of the [[2009]] live-action film, ''[[G-Force]]''. He is a star-nosed mole who served as the team's cyber intelligence specialist. 

==Appearances==
===''[[G-Force]]''===
Prior to the events of the film, Speckles once had a family, though they were later killed by exterminators so they would make way for a new golf course. Joining the [[G-Force (team)|G-Force]] team as the cyber intelligence specialist, Speckles was initially a friend of [[Darwin]] the guinea pig, helping the protagonist in infiltrating [[Leonard Saber]]'s mansion to retrieve important data on a weapon codename known as Clusterstorm. When the FBI decides to shut the unit down after finding out that the evidence from Saberling are just blueprints of the coffee machine, he and the rest of the G-Force team escape and are transported to [[Elia's Pet Shop]]. Speckles then attempts to play dead in a attempt to escape, but backfires when one of the humans throws him in a garbage truck. During the climax of the film, Speckles revealed to Darwin that he hid in a soup can after being thrown in the garbage truck and was the one who created Clusterstorm, via manipulating Leonard Saber, and that his family and home were destroyed by humans, as well as sabotaging G-Force's presentation to ensure that they didn't find out about the sinister plot. As a result, Speckles vowed to get revenge on humans by bombarding the Earth with space junk and debris. Ignoring Darwin's pleas, he turns all of the household appliances into a large robot and ruthlessly attacks and overpowers most of the FBI agents by having space debris rain down on them. When Darwin tells him to shut down the project, he refuses, so he summons a Saberling Blender to attack the former, losing his PDA in the process. Continuing his revenge plot on humans, Speckles then grabbed the FBI Command truck that was carrying Marcie, Ben, Kip, and a wrongfully captured Saber inside, threatening to kill them.

However, Darwin manages to break Speckles free from his insanity by saying that even though his family is gone, Speckles is still a part of the G-Force team, which had become his family, one he was close to destroying like what had happened to his old family long ago. Horrified by this realization, Speckles tries to shut down the robot he created but fails to do so. Luckily, Darwin manages to destroy the robot by inserting a virus-infected PDA (which was recovered by Mooch). He is also saddened when the team finds [[Hurley]] and believe him dead, saying that it's all his fault for an innocent life to have died under his blind obsession for revenge, and is later relieved when they learn that Hurley had survived.

At the end of the film, Speckles is assigned into removing the malicious chips inside thousands of appliances but promises to join the team again if they would have him once he was done (which they probably would).

==Trivia==
*When acting as Mr. Yanshu, he speaks in a deep, disguised voice similar to [[Darth Vader]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''.
*Speckles is one of the few members of G-Force to not be a Guinea Pig, but as a mole due to his cyber intelligence.
*Due to his poor eye sight he needs glasses to see.
