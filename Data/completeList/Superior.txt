'''Superior '''is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', played by Zach McGowan.

His real name is '''Anton Ivanov''', and he is the leader of the Watchdogs, a criminal organization that target [[Inhumans]] due to their prejudice against Inhumans. He also has a vendetta against [[Phil Coulson]] due to an incident in his days with the SVR causing his squadron to be arrested, imprisoned and tortured, although Coulson himself doesn't recall the incident.

He tried to kill [[Patriot (Jeffrey Mace)|Jeffrey Mace]], the Inhuman head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], only to be thwarted (although he did manage to expose to the public Mace's status as an Inhuman). He later teamed up with AIDA to obtain the Darkhold, hoping to use the dark magic of the Darkhold for his evil schemes. This put her in a confrontation with [[Quake]], an Inhuman superheroine and S.H.I.E.LD. agent. Quake used her vibrational powers to collapse the pillars in the bulding, killing Superior. However, after AIDA became [[Madame Hydra]], she downloaded Superior's mind into a Life Model Decoy body, bringing Superior back to life as an android. Later, Superior was upgraded so he would have full command of an army of Life Model Decoys. Quake and [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes/Ghost Rider]] managed to destroy most of these LMD drones, but Superior managed to escape. He was later killed for good by [[Yo-Yo]].
