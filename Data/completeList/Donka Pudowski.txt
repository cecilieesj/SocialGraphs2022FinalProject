'''Donka Pudowski''' is a supporting character in the [[2021]] [[20th Century Studios]] and [[Locksmith Animation]] animated feature film, ''[[Ron's Gone Wrong]]''. She is the grandmother of [[Barney Pudowski]], and [[Graham Pudowski|Graham]]'s mother.

==Background ==
A Bulgarian immigrant and former anti-communist, she seems pretty odd to Americans (but not to be look odd to Europeans, Slavs including Russians, Czechians, or Belarusians). Donka lives in the town of Nonsuch with her son [[Graham Pudowski|Graham]] and her grandson [[Barney Pudowski|Barney]]. Throughout her life, Donka lived with Barney and during birthday parties, the music Donka usually listens to is traditional Bulgarian music with songs covered by Bulgarian musician, Zany Bogomil. However, when it comes to Barney telling Donka about [[Ron]], the glitchy B-Bot he received as a late birthday present, Donka is very kind to her grandson and occasionally gives advice to Barney that to remember what his uncle Boris told him: "The smart man can pickle anything, even a glove" in order to help Barney with his life.

==Role in the film==
Donka is first seen calling her grandson [[Barney Pudowski|Barney]] who is excited that it is his birthday today just as she gives him a beanie made of goat wool to which Barney explains about the allergies to which Donka denies, followed by [[Graham Pudowski|Graham]] giving his son a Junior Rock Hammer Set manufactured by Geo Genius 2000 just as Donka unwraps the table to reveal the food made for the party, Donka plans to play a song recorded by Zany Bogomil which Barney listened to at the age of six to which Barney explains that no one is coming. When Barney talks to his father about having a Bubble Bot for his birthday, Donka explains to Barney that buying a B-Bot is very expensive to which Barney hears someone calling for a Bubble delivery only for Barney to receive a fake B-Bot pranked by Rich Belcher alongside Alex and Jayden. Later, when Donka and Graham arrive at the Bubble store to get a Bubble Bot for Barney, Donka asks Bree to trade her goat for a B-Bot to which Bree sends a message explaining that the store does not accept goats as money in order for them to get a B-Bot for her much to Barney's parents who are worried that they cannot get one at this moment.

The next day after Barney receives his Bubble Bot for his birthday, Donka then dances in her family's kitchen to traditional Bulgarian music just as [[Ron]] studies her dancing. As Barney tells his grandmother that Ron is glitching, Donka suggests Barney to reset Ron, to which Barney explains that doesn't work. Donka attempts to fix him using her drill, to which Barney explains that it would only make it worse. Donka explains to her grandson that Barney should take Ron with him outside in order for him to make friends.

Later, Donka then takes Ron to the Bubble store along with Graham and a police officer who believes that Ron is dangerous. Discussing with Bree about Donka who spent her money for Barney's gift, Ron is taken to be destroyed and, much to Barney's worry, manages to save him from being destroyed by the crusher. Furthermore, throughout the film, Donka, and her son Graham later approach Barney who was diagnosed with asthma at a hospital and while at the hospital, Marc Weidell, creator of the Bubble Bot, approaches and attempts to fix Ron's problems, but Marc cannot access the CEO account due to [[Andrew Morris]] having his current position as CEO.

Later at Bubble HQ, Donka arrives at the employees only area where she deploys Graham, Barney, Ron, and Marc to get to the cloud storage area to which Donka brings in her goat to help Barney get to the cloud storage area for him to fix Ron just as Donka's goat bites the wires to distract the guards which suddenly interrupts a presentation where Andrew is speaking in front of the audience. Later, Donka approaches Andrew where two security guards show Donka's goat to him just as Andrew threatens to send in security to arrest Barney for trespassing. Barney's plan to update all the B-Bots with Ron's original code was successful. Three months later, Barney shows his classmates the chicken feet which Donka packed him for lunch, just as Barney and his classmates share the food his grandmother packed him for lunch.
