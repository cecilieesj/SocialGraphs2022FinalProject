'''Eudora''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2009]] animated feature film, ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. She is the mother of [[Tiana|Princess Tiana]] and the wife (later widow) of [[James (The Princess and the Frog)|James]]. She is her daughter's confidante and wants her to be happy. She also doesn't want her daughter to overwork herself. According to [[Eli La Bouff|Mr. La Bouff]], Eudora's the finest seamstress in all of New Orleans, having made most of [[Charlotte La Bouff|his daughter's]] dresses (Eudora's very well-respected by the La Bouff family).

==Appearances==
===''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''===
In the beginning, Eudora tells the story of ''The Frog Prince'' to her daughter, Tiana and her best friend, [[Charlotte La Bouff]] while finishing up a dress she's sewn for Charlotte. After finishing the story and the dress, Eudora prepares to leave and revokes the little girls for playing roughly with the La Bouff's pet kitten. Eudora is then greeted by Charlotte's father, [[Eli La Bouff]] and promised the wealthy sugar baron to sew a dress for Charlotte like the princess from ''The Frog Prince'' wears after Charlotte made a request for it. Eudora and her daughter leave the La Bouff mansion and head home where Eudora works at her sewing machine while her husband [[James (The Princess and the Frog)|James]] and Tiana cook some gumbo. After James is satisfied with the gumbo's taste, Eudora agrees with her husband on their daughter having great cooking skills and joins her family in having gumbo with their neighbors. Later, as Eudora and James tuck their daughter to bed, she encourages Tiana to keep wishing on the [[Evangeline|Evening Star]] to make her dream of owning come true before James tells her that she also has to work hard to make her dreams come true. After kissing Tiana good night, Eudora and James go to bed.

Years later, James had passed away. After Tiana makes enough money to buy an old sugar mill for her restaurant, Eudora presents her daughter James's old gumbo pot as a gift to help her get started. The two embrace and comfort each other over James's death as he passed away long before he could see his dream coming true. As the two explore inside the old sugar mill, Eudora expresses her concerns about Tiana overworking herself and tries to get her daughter to understand that although her father never achieved his dreams, he still had the love and support of his family which was better. Eudora then expressed she now wanted Tiana to find love and marry so she could have grandchildren, but Tiana remains determined to get her restaurant where Eudora gives in to keep supporting her daughter in achieving her dream. 

At the end of the film she is seen at the (second) wedding of Tiana and [[Prince Naveen|Naveen]], followed by being seated with the king and queen of Maldonia in a carriage leading ahead of the married couple and last seen sitting at a table with Naveen's parents in [[Tiana's Palace|Tiana's restaurant]], reading a menu with a picture of her, Tiana, and James together.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Eudora appears in the show's seventh season episode "[[Greenbacks]]", portrayed by Robin Givens. In the series, she is a noblewoman, who was formerly wealthy  and is facing financial disaster.

After the death of her husband, Queen Eudora is forced to auction items of her castle to pay taxes after the King of their land raises them. Eudora suggests to her daughter that if she found a Prince to marry, then their financial problems may be solved. After Princess Tiana finds out that Prince Marius is just a commoner named Robert, Eudora consoles her daughter, regretting for ever telling Tiana to get married to solve their financial problems. She is later seen attending her daughter's coronation in the episode "[[A Taste of the Heights]]".
