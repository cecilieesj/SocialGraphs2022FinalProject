'''Fujimoto''' is the main antagonist in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s [[2009]] animated film ''[[Ponyo (film)|Ponyo]]''. While he's depicted as the main antagonist, Fujimoto isn't really a villain. He's just an over-protective and an over-controlling father who just wants to prevent his [[Ponyo|daughter]] from wanting to turn into a human. But in the end, Fujimoto saw that he was wrong, and then he lets Ponyo become human while she's staying with [[Sosuke]] and his family right after he was asking Sosuke to take good care of her.

== Biography ==
Originally a human, Fujimoto serves as the Guardian of Sea Life. Being the husband of [[Granmamare]], Fujimoto is the father of [[Ponyo]] and her sisters. He's shocked to find out that Ponyo is in the care of a young boy named [[Sosuke]], and he has to retrieve Ponyo back before it's too late. Although, he's successful the first time, Ponyo would escape again, thus it was upsetting the balance of nature. Running out of time, Fujimoto had to find a solution to bring Sosuke and Ponyo to Granmamare and restore the balance of nature.

== Appearance ==
Fujimoto is a tall, lanky man. He seems to wear pink and blue makeup. His biggest and most notable characteristic is his long, orange hair. Fujimoto's clothing attire is a vertical-stripped jacket and a pair of black pants.

== Personality ==
Although Fujimoto takes the role of the antagonist in the film, he's not considered a villain since his intents are only for the greater good of the world. For example, if [[Ponyo]] is on earth without her father in her care, then the force of nature becomes unbalanced and upset. Fujimoto had never any intent to attack [[Sosuke]], but had to since had to since Ponyo was outside of his care.

Fujimoto hates humans since he's disgusted by the pollution that they have caused to the ocean. Although, his hatred seemed to lessen once he allowed Ponyo to live with Sosuke.

Although he's hard on his daughters, he loves them deeply despite his hard exterior. He also shares a deep love with his wife [[Granmamare]], who serves as the Goddess of Mercy and the Queen of the ocean.

Once Ponyo turned human, and the balance of nature was restored, Fujimoto eventually wished Souske good luck and the best for him and his daughter.
