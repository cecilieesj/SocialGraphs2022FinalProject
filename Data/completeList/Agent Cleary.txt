==Background==
===Personality===
Agent Cleary is agent for the Department of [[Damage Control]]. He follows orders as directed, bringing Parker and his associates in for questioning, determined to gather answers for their alleged crimes. Despite the large amount of public support, for Spider-Man, and the perception of heroism, he's been associated for the past number of years, prior to his accusations, Cleary is focused on his fulfilling the requirements of his job.

During his questioning, he displayed how tactful he can be, approaching each of Peter's associates in different methods. Whilst MJ, is unmoved by the authority he holds over her, he reminds her of the potential risks she faces, and how she may jeopardize her future. He approaches Ned under a false sense of security, by conferring him in a friendly demeanor and undermining the severity of the accusations held against him, until he manages to gather substantial evidence. With May being more mindful of Cleary's behavior, he talks to her in a straight-forward manner, stating what she's been accused of, and brings her character into question, having allowed Peter to act as Spider-Man.

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]''====
After [[Mysterio]]'s death, footage produced by Beck is released, accusing [[Spider-Man]] of the drone attack in London and his murder, as well as exposing his identity, as Peter Parker. Following this revelation, Agent Cleary of the Department of [[Damage Control]] and his men arrive to the Parker Residence, with a warrant for the arrest of Peter Parker. They are met with resistance from [[Aunt May|May]], but move past her, as they enter the premise, and gather evidence, in light of Peter's alleged crimes.

Cleary brings Peter into the station, for interrogation. The accused, protests for his innocence, claiming the drones killed Mysterio, but Cleary reminds him they were in his belonging. Peter's friends soon arrive, and Cleary detains them for individual questioning.

He begins with [[Mary Jane Watson|MJ]], who tells him she wants a lawyer. Cleary addresses her by her full name, and she quickly informs him, she doesn't go by Watson. Before he can ask why she wants a lawyer, if she has nothing to hide, MJ completes his sentence and also speculates why he'd wonder why she wants a lawyer, as she'd have nothing to hide, should she be innocent. Cleary tells MJ to just answer his questions, and following his review on her file and her background, questions why she'd risk her future, to help a vigilante.

Cleary's next line of questioning is with [[Ned Leeds]]. He and his associate use a tactic of playing friendly, to build a rapport, apologizing for keeping him waiting, and offering a snack for his inconvenience. Ned refuses to say anything to him, which Cleary accepts, but wants to quickly ask him something, under the assumption MJ was the one to tell Ned, that Peter was Spider-Man. Before he can continue on, Ned corrects him, revealing he knew of Peter's true identity, before MJ, and acted as his "guy in the chair". Cleary relates to this, telling him that half his men also act in a similar position, and Ned further divulges that he helped Peter find the [[Vulture (Marvel)|Vulture]], hack into his suit, and get into space. In light of Ned's admissions, Cleary concludes that he was Spider-Man's main accomplice in his illegal vigilantism. Ned then proceeds to request his words be stricken from the record.

As May's interview begins, she informs Cleary that he can't hold them, without charges. Cleary advises her to get a lawyer, and informs her of the potential child endangerment indictment she may face, as Peter acted as Spider-Man, while under her supervision, and to her encouragement, and questions who as a person, would do that.

A spell is later enacted by [[Doctor Strange]], erasing the memory of Peter Parker, from the world, including that of Cleary.

====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
After a video of a [[Ms. Marvel|young cosplayer]] using powers at AvengerCon, surfaces online, [[Sadie Deever|Agent Deever]] reports it to Cleary. Upon seeing the footage, he decides she must be brought in.

Damage Control bring in [[Zoe Zimmer]], a prominent social media figure, for questioning. Zimmer was called in, because she was seen in the footage, being rescued by the enhanced individual. Agent Cleary approaches her with an air of admiration. He claims to be a fan of her content, and pair briefly discuss her videos, before he steers the conversation into the events at AvengerCon. He drops his friendly disposition and questions if the enhanced tried to kill Zoe. She denies this, and states that she saved her life. Cleary then implies that Zoe orchestrated the incident, for her social media, and she planned it, with the enhanced individual, who may possibly be her sister, seeing as how they look similar. Zoe denies sharing any likeness with her, when Agent Deever arrives to continue the interrogation. Devever manages to identify the cosplayer as a South Asian girl, and Cleary calls her over to announce a tri-state sweep, in search of every temple, community center and mosque. He asks she be respectful, as the FBI are already surveilling them.
