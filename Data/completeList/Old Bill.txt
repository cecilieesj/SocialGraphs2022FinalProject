'''Old Bill''' is a character from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''.

==History==

===Background===
Old Bill was a pirate who served in the [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|crew]] of the [[Wicked Wench]]. Bill partook in the pirate's raiding of Puerto Dorado on the island of [[Isla Tesoro]]. During the raid, Bill was amongst the pirates who got extremely drunk with Bill drinking alone and trying to get alley cats drunk with him for company.

===Development History===
Old Bill was created for the [[Walt Disney World]] version of Pirates of the Caribbean in the [[Magic Kingdom]]. Following the ride's opening in [[1973]], Old Bill's scene would be integrated into the original [[Disneyland]] version of the ride.

==Appearances==

===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===
Old Bill appears right before the flaming town scene in this ride, being seen near a bride drinking rum. As he drinks he attempts to give rum to several scared stray-cats while mockingly encouraging them to partake in the drink and laughing to himself.

==Other Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===
Old Bill appeared in a deleted scene in this film. He appeared in a pub called the ''Captain's Daughter'', drinking rum while trying to give the drink to a stray cat. His dialogue was very reminiscent of that from the attraction in this unused scene.

==Trivia==
*A [[vinylmation]] figure would identify him as, "'''Patches'''". This figure also put a scar under his eyepatch, implying an ocular wound. While he often is shown with an eyepatch over his right-eye in the ride it is unclear if he wears it to hide a wound or to adjust his eyes for darkness as sailors historically did.
*A [[2006]] action-figure identified him as being, "'''The first-mate'''".
