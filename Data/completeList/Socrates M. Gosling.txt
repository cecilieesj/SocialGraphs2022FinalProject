|family=[[Donald Duck]] (uncle)<br>[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] (cousins)<br>Uncle Gus (father; probably)}}'''Socrates M.''' '''Gosling''', also known''' '''as''' Cousin Sock''',''' '''is a kid genius who is [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]'s cousin.

He was first mentioned in an episode of [[Al Taliaferro]] ''Donald Duck'' newspaper strip, when [[Donald]] tells to Huey, Dewey, and Louie he has just received a telegram from their "Uncle Gus" telling cousin "Sock" will come to visit Donald and the nephews. The "Sock" nickname makes the kids believe their cousin is some kind of bully, so they train and get glasses so that they won't be punched.[[File:Socrates_first_appearance.jpg|thumb|left|210x210px|Sock and his cousins in the ''Donald Duck'' newspaper comc strip.]]

However, when "Sock" arrives by train, the kids find "Sock" is short for Socrates, a brainy bespectacled cousin. Later strips show Socrates as a foil to Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

After his departure from the Taliaferro comic strips, Socrates has reappeared in various other ''Donald Duck'' comics.{{CharacterStub}}
