}}The '''Humpback Whales''' are the primary stars of the "[[Pines of Rome]]" segment in Disney's [[1999]] film ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', sequel to the 1940 film ''[[Fantasia]]''. These humpback whales are capable of flying in the skies.

=== Papa Whale===
The leader of the humpback whales, Papa Whale is the most responsible for the joys in the iceberg in the starry night. He once sprayed water out of his spout to fend off the seagulls.

===Mama Whale===
The wife of Papa Whale. She finds her baby trapped inside the iceberg and helps him escape because she is a very protective mother.

===Baby Whale===

The baby whale appears among the character drawings decorating the outside of the building (though it has been replaced by more recent Disney characters) and on one of the seals on the walls of the Sorcerers Workshop, which was among a few that were later each became part of a wheel for a phenakisticope (the whale's phenakisticope movie shows it doing a flip out of the water when the wheel is spun). The symbol for the whale in the latter representing the movie it came from is a treble clef that is also a [[Hidden Mickey]].
