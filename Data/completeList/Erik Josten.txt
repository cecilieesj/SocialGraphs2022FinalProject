'''Erik Josten''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]] who appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble]]''. He was genetically modified with ionic rays, which gave him the ability to grow as tall as a skyscraper, superhuman strength, and invulnerability. He decided to use his powers as the supervillain '''Goliath''', joining the Masters of Evil to defeat the Avengers.
He later resurfaces as the superhero '''Atlas''', helping the Avengers defeat the [[Growing Man]].

Erik Josten was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and Don Heck.

==Powers & Abilities==
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' His natural super strength is beyond human limits. It rivals the strength of a calm & collected Hulk. His strength enhances as he grows in size & mass. 
* '''Size & Mass Enhancement:''' His physiology has the ability to enhance its mass & physical size upon will. This also enhances his strength & durability to greater limits.
** '''Superhuman Durability:''' As his physiology increases, so does his natural resilience to damage. He can withstand powerful strikes from beings with great superhuman strength such as Hulk, and strong hits from Thor's hammer Mjolnir with minor discomfort.
* '''Hand-to-Hand Combat:''' He displays great combat skills & athletic prowess in combat. He has trained under Baron Helmut Zemo / Citizen V in further hand-to-hand combat skills. 

== Appearances ==
He first appears as a member of the Masters of Evil in his Goliath alias in the episodes "Adapting to Change" and "Under Siege", and then appears as a member of the Thunderbolts while assuming his Atlas alias in the episode "Thunderbolts", and as both personas in the episode "Thunderbolts Revealed".
