'''Fidella''' is [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra's]] horse in the show, ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''. She also sometimes serves as [[Rapunzel]]'s horse when riding alongside [[Maximus]].

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Fidella is a light brown coated horse with a dark brown braided mane and tail. She has a tan muzzle, tan fur above her hooves, and blue eyes. She wears a distinct saddle with the sun symbol of the Kingdom.

===Powers and abilities===
Like other horses, Fidella is incredibly fast, outrunning humans easily. She is also shown to be able to walk over and avoid tripping over obstacles, as she got past a group of rabbits that were blocking her and [[Rapunzel]]'s path.

===Weapons===
As a horse, Fidella lacks the means to wield weapons properly and relies on her hooves and teeth.

== Appearances ==
=== ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]'' ===
Fidella is first seen (mounted by Rapunzel) racing with Eugene and Maximus the border wall while being pursued by the Royal Guards, she has gotten Rapunzel to the wall first and helps her to climbs to the top, after that they raced back to Corona for the welcoming ceremony.

That night, she helps her owner Cassandra to sneak Rapunzel outside Corona.  During their outing, a mysterious rock causes Rapunzel's golden hair to grow back, just before the area rapidly begins to fill with [[Black Rocks|black rocks]] sprouting from the ground, the bridge beneath them begins to crumble apart, the gang survive and head back to Corona before Rapunzel's coronation. 

===''[[Tangled: The Series]]''===
Fidella returns in the series and still serves as Cassandra's horse. Fidella doesn't appear too much in the first season but it is shown in "[[Max's Enemy]]" that Maximus appears to have a crush on Fidella and gets jealous when a new horse, [[Axel (Tangled)|Axel]] impresses Fidella. After Axel's defeat, Fidella is shown to be impressed by Max revealing Axel's true colours and that he is the horse to [[Lady Caine]].

Fidella joins Rapunzel, Cassandra, Eugene, Shorty, Lance and Hook Foot on their journey to [[The Dark Kingdom]] and both horses pull the [[Rapunzel's Caravan|caravan]]. Fidella and Maximus often help the gang in their situations.

After Cassandra's betrayal, Fidella serves as Rapunzel's horse at times and sometimes also as [[Varian]]'s horse. Fidella is used by Varian in the penultimate episode, "[[Once a Handmaiden...]]" and again in the series finale, "[[Plus Est En Vous]]" after the defeating of [[Zhan Tiri]]
Fidella leaving Corona with reform Cassandra to find her own destiny.

==Trivia==
*It is shown in "[[Max's Enemy]]" that Maximus has a crush on Fidella.
*Fidella is shown to be [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra's]] horse but is sometimes used by Rapunzel and Varian.
