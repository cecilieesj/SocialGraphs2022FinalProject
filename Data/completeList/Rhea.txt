The '''Rhea''' is a large flightless ostrich-like bird that appears in the [[Mickey Mouse]] short ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''.

==Role in the short==
Mickey rides the bird to the "Cantina Argentina", a local bar, where he gets intoxicated and smokes cigars for some relaxation. At some point [[Pete]] proceeds in kidnapping Minnie and attempts to escape on his horse. Mickey gives chase on the rhea. He soon catches up to his rival, and they proceed to fight with swords. Mickey emerges the victor of this joust. The finale of the short has Mickey and Minnie riding the rhea into the distance.
