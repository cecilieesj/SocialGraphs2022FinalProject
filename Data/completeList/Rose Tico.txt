==Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''===
After the Resistance escapes from the First Order while evacuating from [[D'Qar]], Rose is first seen mourning for her older sister, Paige, who had sacrificed her life to destroy the ''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought ''Fulminatrix'' so the [[Resistance]] can flee. Rose guards the escape pods where she meets [[Finn]], a Resistance hero she greatly admires, attempting to flee in one of the pods. After Rose stops him by stunning him with an electro-shock prod, Finn tells her the [[First Order]] had found a way to track the MC85 Star Cruiser ''Raddus'' through hyperspace. The two formulate a plan to disable the tracking device on the First Order's flagship, the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]'', which will allow the ''Raddus'' to escape. With help from Resistance droid [[BB-8]], Rose and Finn set off on an unauthorized mission to the casino city of [[Canto Bight]], located on [[Cantonica]], to find a master codebreaker to assist them.

Although Finn is impressed by the superficial beauty and debauchery of Canto Bight, Rose reveals to him the dark underpinnings of the lavish casino city, pointing out the fortunes of the city's rich inhabitants is supported by child slavery, weapons dealing, and other immoral activities that result in the suffering of others. Rose and Finn are arrested for their illegal entry into Canto Bight, and in prison they meet [[DJ]], a code breaker who along with BB-8 helps them escape and agrees to assist them in disabling the ''Supremacy''<nowiki/>'s tracking device. The four escape Canto Bight with the help of some of the enslaved children there, and Rose gives one of them Paige's Rebel Alliance ring to inspire his trust. Rose and the others return to the ''Supremacy'' and infiltrate the ship disguised as First Order officers, but are captured by [[General Hux]] and [[Captain Phasma]] before they can disable the tracking device. DJ betrays Rose and Finn, informing the First Order of their plan and providing information about the Resistance in exchange for his release and a monetary reward.

Phasma attempts to execute Rose and Finn, but BB-8 helps them escape and fight their way to freedom, killing Phasma in the process. Meanwhile, the surviving Resistance forces escape to an old Rebel Alliance base on the nearby planet [[Crait]]. Rose, Finn, and BB-8 board a stolen ''Xi''-class light shuttle and fly to Crait. Along with Finn and [[Poe Dameron|Poe]], Rose pilots a ski speeder in a defensive battle against First Order forces, during which they try to destroy a superlaser siege cannon before it can destroy the door to the base. Finn attempts a hopeless suicide attack against the cannon, but Rose saves his life by crashing her speeder into his, knocking him off course and seriously injuring herself in the process. When Finn asks why she saved him, she confesses her feelings to him by saying that the only way they will defeat the First Order is saving what they love, rather than fighting what they hate. She then kisses Finn before falling unconscious from her wounds. Finn brings Rose back to the base, and her unconscious body is taken aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' along with the other Resistance survivors. Inside the ''Falcon'', Finn takes care of Rose and covers her with a blanket while she receives medical attention, as they flee Crait and escape from the First Order.

=== ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' ===
During the events of [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]]' return, Rose was tasked by [[Leia Organa]] with studying the specifications of ''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers in case they had similarities with the [[Sith Eternal]]'s fleet, the Final Order. She was offered by [[Finn]] to accompany his group in searching for a [[Sith wayfinder]], but due to her assigned task, she declined. When Leia died after reaching out to [[Kylo Ren|her son]] through [[the Force]], Rose attended he funeral with the other members of the Resistance.

Rose was later present at the Battle of [[Exegol]], and was part of the assault led by Finn and [[Jannah]]. When Finn and Jannah stayed behind in an attempt to disable the transmitter of the ''Resurgent-''class Star Destroyer ''Steadfast'', Rose was hesitant to leave Finn, but eventually left with persuasion from Beaumont Kin and Kaydel Ko Connix. Once Sidious was defeated at the hands of [[Rey]] and the ''Steadfast'' was destroyed through the efforts of Finn and Jannah, Rose informed [[Poe Dameron|Poe]] that they did not board the lander, leading Poe to go rescue them, only for Finn and Jannah to be rescued by [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[Chewbacca]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Once the Resistance returned to base, Rose celebrated the Sith Eternal's defeat and gave Chewbacca a hug.

==Trivia==
*According to ''The Last Jedi'' novelization, the baffler technology developed by Rose helps the Resistance ships in their escape.
*After her debut in the ''Star Wars'' franchise, the actress [[Kelly Marie Tran]] was victim of racist comments and intense cyberbullying, which led her to delete all her social media accounts.
**As a reaction to her online harassment, many fans started support campains to the actress and her character with fanart. Some of the fanarts created were later gifted to Kelly Marie Tran by the fans during a BUILD live interview for the ''The Rise of Skywalker''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://youtu.be/eUqWMFHPhJo?t=1688|title=Kelly Marie Tran Talks About The Highly-Anticipated Film, "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"|website=Youtube|date=[[December 9]], [[2019]]}}</ref>
