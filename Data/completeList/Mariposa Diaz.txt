'''Mariposa Diaz''' is [[Marco Diaz|Marco]]'s baby sister who appears in the fourth and final season of ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''.
While Marco was away on [[Mewni]], Rafael and Angie decided to have another baby. Marco would not be aware of this until he and Star were invited to a baby-shower in "[[Marco Jr.]]" At the time, they were expecting a boy, but turned out to be a girl once she was born. Mariposa is very close to her brother, and by "[[Gone Baby Gone]]" becomes friends with [[Meteora Butterfly]].

==Trivia==
*Her first name is [[Spain|Spanish]] for "butterfly".
*She is similar to [[Hana Stoppable]] from [[Kim Possible]], as both are the younger sisters of the male protagonist and are shown to have a great fighting potential.
