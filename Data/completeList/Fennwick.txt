He is a cyclops who is one of the construction workers preparing to tear down the fountain containing an extremely rare [[Phoenix Gem]].

==Background==
Not much of Fennwick's personality is known other than his duty as a construction worker. It is shown that Fennwick cannot deny himself from tearing down the fountain containing a Phoenix Gem much to [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]]'s protests.

==Role in the film==
Fennwick is first seen in a video footage of [[Barley Lightfoot]] trying to prevent an ancient fountain he is trying to prevent from being torn down, but the construction workers refuse as they plan to continue demolishing the site of the fountain. Later during the climax of the film where Barley prepares to insert the flower-shaped piece from one of the raven statues at [[Raven's Point]], Fennwick and a fellow woman elf prepare to stop him from getting onto the fountain, but much to Barley's rebellious plan, he manages to fend them off. Just as the construction workers call the police to arrest Barley for trespassing, Barley inserts the piece onto the fountain unleashing a rare [[Phoenix Gem]] containing a curse spreading across New Mushroomton to reveal an [[The Curse Dragon|enormous artificial dragon]]. It is unknown what happened to Fennwick afterwards, even after the curse is broken.

==Trivia==
*[[John Ratzenberger]] previously voiced a construction worker named "[[Construction Foreman Tom|Tom]]", a character from the [[2009]] Pixar film, ''[[Up]]''.
*This is (possibly) [[John Ratzenberger]]'s last role in a Pixar film.
