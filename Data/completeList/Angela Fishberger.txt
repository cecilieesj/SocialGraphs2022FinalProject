'''Angela (pronounced angel-a) Fishberger''' is a video-game obsessed nerd. She is similar to [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] in some ways.

==Personality==
Angela is an adventurous girl who is capable of doing dangerous and risky things. She is also love playing video games like Oscar does, but she plays video games more than he does. She's so addicted to video games that she sometimes doesn't focus on important things.

==Personal Life==
Angela made her first appearance as being Oscar's rival in a debate showdown. Throughout the whole practice, they have gone through dates and activities such as diving, parasailing, riding or wild animals and such. She also somewhat resembles a stalker, and Oscar believes she is trying to make him lose the debate battle. Yet, in the end, Angela is a very obsessive scrapbooker and was only trying to take pictures of Oscar for sentimentality. (''[[Send Me an Angel Fish]]'')

She later made an appearance in "Guys' Night Out" which Oscar and her officially become boyfriend-girlfriend. Shiloh is Angela's crazy best best friend and she looks like Milo. (''[[Guys' Night Out]]'')

When Oscar asked Angela to the prom, she said she wasn't interested in prom, but she agreed to go with Oscar. However, she brought a virtual reality video game helmet to the prom and played than spending time with Oscar. Oscar shut off the video game helmet asking if she would dance with him and wanted her to be with him. Angela said she is but Oscar said she's not and only playing her dumb games. Angela was hurt by that, but to make things worse, Oscar accidentally called her "Bea" when he said he wanted to have one dance with her and Angela broke up with him and ran away from him but not before going up to Bea and shouted "He's all Yours, BEA!" then she cried and ran out of the prom. She was seen about to throw away her video game helmet until Jumbo came out when his robotic date abandoned him. Jumbo saw Angela and said her helmet was cool and they fell in love. (''[[Fish Prom]]'')
