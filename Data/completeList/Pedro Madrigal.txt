'''Pedro Madrigal''' is a minor character in the [[2021]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film, ''[[Encanto]]''. He was the late patriarch of the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal]] family, husband of [[Alma Madrigal]], father of triplets [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]], and the maternal grandfather of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]], [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]], [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]], and [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]. He dies at the start of the movie where he sacrificed his life to a band of ruthless soldiers, saving his family and causing them to be gifted with magic.

==Background==
Aside from the fact that he was a shopkeeper when he met [[Alma Madrigal]], Pedro's past prior to becoming Alma's husband is unknown. At an undefined point in the past, he met Alma during a celebration for [[Wikipedia:Day of the Little Candles|Day of the Little Candles]] in their village,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468264875193298948|title=Pedro's info|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref> where they fell in love and eventually got married. Sometime later, Pedro lived with his wife blissfully with children on the way. During the day of the triplets’ birth, a conflict struck his town and he was forced to leave his home with his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1489962723307708416|title=Pedro's death & Triplets' birthday Part 1|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=February 5, 2022|access-date=February 5, 2022}}</ref> During the conflict that same day, Pedro sacrificed himself to the conquerors who were chasing after the escaping villagers, allowing Alma and their children to escape but at the cost of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1504961910579490817|title=Pedro's death & Triplets' birthday Part 2|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=March 18, 2022|access-date=March 18, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1504977247433900035|title=Pedro's death & Triplets' birthday Part 3|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=March 18, 2022|access-date=March 18, 2022}}</ref>

Immediately after his death, the [[Miracle Candle|candle]] Alma held onto was imbued with magic, and a miracle helped her and her three children, [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]], and [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]], as well as the villagers survive. The miracle also created [[Casa Madrigal]] in an Encanto, where Alma became the matriarch of their family and passed down the magic of the candle to her and Pedro's descendants, as well as preserving the town. Pedro is still remembered fondly by his wife, who remains loyal to him and often prays to him when in need. A portrait of Pedro is hung in the Casita, and Alma keeps a locket with his picture around her neck at all times.

===Official Description===
:''Abuelo Pedro was Alma's husband and the patriarch of the family. He died fifty years ago, when he and Abuela Alma left their home in search of a better life. Abuela Alma attributes the miracle of the Madrigal family to his sacrifice.''

==Appearances==
===''[[Encanto]]''===
Pedro is seen in two flashbacks throughout the entire film. In the beginning of the film, Pedro and his wife are shown to have been forced to leave their home with their newborn children during an attack. When the young family and other runaway villagers arrive at a river, Pedro was slain by a group of soldiers. Following her husband’s death, Alma's candle transformed into a [[Miracle Candle|magical candle]], which brought to life the village of [[Encanto (location)|Encanto]] and the sentient Casa Madrigal.

Later in the movie, after Casa Madrigal is destroyed following the loss of its magic, a heartbroken Mirabel, whose argument with Alma resulted in the loss of the family's magic and home, runs away and inadvertently ends up at the river where her grandfather was killed. Abuela finds Mirabel there and confesses that she had not been able to come back to the river following the tragedy. During the "[[Dos Oruguitas]]" flashback sequence, Pedro is seen to have met and fallen in love with Alma, and they married. The couple then had triplets before an armed conflict forced them to evacuate their home. Pedro, Alma, their three infant children, and a group of surviving villagers had just reached the river before the following soldiers caught up with them. Pedro bravely distracted the soldiers to buy his family and community some time to escape, although this selfless act was at the cost of his own life. His widow, Alma, was later gifted a miracle, and she raised her family alone in Casa Madrigal within a safe haven for them and their community. Though Alma acknowledges that the loss of the magic and their family's fractured state are both her fault, not Mirabel's, her granddaughter maturely understands her strictness was a resolve to ensure their family and community's safety. Mirabel further assures Alma that, in spite of her mistakes, suffered through a broken heart to raise their family and lead their community alone, and that it was not too late for them to make things right. The pair hug and reconcile, with Alma saying that when she asked Pedro for help, he sent her Mirabel. Afterwards, Mirabel, Alma, the rest of the Madrigals, and the entire town work together to rebuild the Casita.

==Trivia==
*Pedro's name is derived from "Peter" but is translated to Spanish and Portuguese.
*Pedro's age when he crosses the river is confirmed to same as Sebastián Yatra's when he recorded the song, [[Dos Oruguitas]]. Taking in consideration his birthyear (1994) and the year in which the songs were recorded (2020), this would mean Pedro would have been 26 years old before his death.<ref>https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468801430752358402</ref>
*Pedro is the only member of the Madrigal family to have no speaking lines.
*It's been theorized that after Pedro died, his soul had went into the [[Miracle Candle|candle]] and becoming [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]].    
*According to the movie's junior novelization, Alma (secretly) sees much of Pedro in Mirabel.
**Mirabel, Bruno, and Camilo, in different ways, seem to inherit his humorous personality.
