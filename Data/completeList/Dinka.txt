'''Dinka''' (portrayed by Sam Lerner) was born on April 18th, 1996 is a Glendovian exchange student, in ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]''. He is only 14 years old and wishes to have a beard as thick as his sister's and as great as his father's. He appeared in "Sonny Get Your Goat", in which he filled in for [[Tawni Hart|Tawni]] while she was in Glendovia. While Tawni was under the impression that she was in a comedy exchange program, Dinka, a dedicated cashier, thought he was in a cashier exchange. He is extremely proud of his job, and takes great offense when [[Grady Mitchell|Grady]] calls a cash register boring.

==Trivia==
*Interestingly, [[Nico Harris|Nico]] and Grady would have been the first "Check It Out Guys". In "Sonny Get Your Goat", Dinka would have been the third one not the first.
*Dinka was originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
