'''Charlie Proctor''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2001]] animated film, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and its [[2013]] [[Monsters University|prequel]]. He is the assistant of [[George Sanderson]].



==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''===
Assistant of [[George Sanderson]], Charlie has blue skin and two octopus like arms, and also four tentacles that act as feet. He has snail eyes that pass through two holes in his workman's hat. He is also very friendly and admires [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] and [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]]'s work, and states that George is like an older brother. Despite his friendly attitude, he'll often freak out and overreact when a certain object from a human child appears on George, following by him screaming "2319!", resulting in the [[CDA]] showing up in order to take control of the situation. Besides helping out in problems like this, Charlie also has an important role in the company, as assistant maintenance.

During the movie, he congratulates [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] for exceeding Sulley's score but immediately congratulates Sulley instead when Sulley earns a big score that exceeds Randall's score after scaring a children's slumber party. He praises Mike for the scores he and Sulley earn. When Mike asks Charlie about George, he says that George's doing great and that they are like brothers but he immediately panics and screams "2319!" when he sees a sock on his back. The [[CDA]] agents then arrive and decontaminate George.

Later, he and George are at his locker when [[Boo]]'s toys, which Sulley put in George's locker when he accidentally left it open, fall on George, prompting Charlie to scream "2319!" once again, summoning the CDA who rush out of the bathroom stalls and jump on George to decontaminate him again. Later, when Sulley bursts out of the door he and George are using, George has another human sock stuck to his body, causing Charlie to scream "2319!" out again, though before he can finish speaking, a fed-up George takes off the sock, stuffs it into Charlie's mouth, before tossing him through the door and slamming it then casually walking away. 

Charlie makes it back to [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]] since George simply left the door turned on at the station after throwing Charlie through it. Shortly after, he is seen rushing over to Randall with all the other monsters who excitedly surround him after [[Celia Mae|Celia]] falsely announces that Randall just broke the all time scare record in an attempt to help stop him. He is last seen among the employees who watch their CEO, Mr. Waternoose, get arrested by the CDA. He most likely works on the Laugh Floor in the end, though he is unseen.

===''[[Monsters University]]''===
Charlie briefly appears at the end of the film. When Mike and Sulley are about to enter the Scare Floor on their first day as a Scare Team, various monsters are seen, including Charlie, who is seen talking to George.
