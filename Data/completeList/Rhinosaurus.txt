The '''Rhinosaurus''' is a mechanical rhinoceros created by [[Willem Viceroy]]. It serves as the primary antagonist in the episode "[[McFear Factor]]".

==Role in the episode==
The Rhinosaurus was created to turn one's greatest fears against them as part of the plan to capture the Ninja. Its horn is an emotional sensor which can detect one's greatest fear. Once it zaps a victim with its horn, its back end produces a gas which forms a phobioid (an embodiment of one's fears).

Once the Rhinosaurus was unleashed upon [[Norrisville High]], it started zapping the students at random, causing panic among the school grounds as the phobioids ran amok. Naturally, [[Randy Cunningham]] transformed into the Ninja and went to stop the trouble. But when the Rhino zapped Randy, it manifested a group of chickens - which Randy dreaded. Paralyzed with fear, Randy was beamed up with the chickens and the Rhinosaurus into [[Hannibal McFist]]'s hover ship.

Randy was then locked inside a glass dome along with the chickens. McFist congratulated the Rhinosaurus for capturing the Ninja, treating it like a pet. But the robot accidentally scanned Viceroy and McFist and created manifestations of their fears. While the villains were preoccupied, Randy used the [[NinjaNomicon]]'s words of wisdom to devise an escape plan. When the Rhino noticed Randy embracing his fear, it created a gigantic rooster in an attempt to scare him again. However, Randy mounted the rooster and rode it out of the hovership with the Rhino and several Robo-Apes in pursuit. The Rhino and the Robo-Apes ended up plummeting to the ground. With the destruction of the Rhinosaurus, the phobioids all ceased to exist.

The Rhinosaurus makes a minor appearance in "[[Escape from Scrap City]]", implying it was junked after its defeat.

==Trivia==
*Rhinosaurus, rusted over, makes a minor appearance in the episode "Escape from Scrap City."
