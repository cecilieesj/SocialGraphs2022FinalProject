==History==
Johnny decided to move to a house in the woods in order to work on his music on his own. However upon arriving there, he discovered that the woods were populated by Sprites, small fairy-like creatures with magical powers. The Sprites had never revealed themselves to any human before, but soon took a liking to Johnny due to his friendly and winning personality. Together, he and the Sprites began having many adventures together and became friends in the process.

==Personality==
Although an adult himself, Johnny is fun-loving and still connected with his childhood, allowing him to be an excellent role-model and mentor to the Sprites. He is a fantastic musician, able to compose and sing songs on the spot. He believes in himself and is able to provide belief and encouragement to the Sprites and those around them to believe in themselves as well. He believes in the power of the problem-solving and creative thinking, and has learned from his friend Gwen that "you never know what you can do until you try out something new."

==Trivia==
*Johnny first appeared in the ''Johnny and the Sprites'' shorts, performed by John Tartaglia, who also performed the recurring neighbor character of "Miss Moldystew." The shorts would prove popular enough to be made into a full series program which lasted two seasons on Playhouse Disney, though the Miss Moldystew character only appeared in the shorts.
*John Tartaglia first gained fame through the Broadway stage show ''Avenue Q'', an adult parody of ''Sesame Street'', and many of his fellow original cast performers on ''Avenue Q'' also appeared in guest roles on ''Johnny and the Sprites'', while many other members of the show's crew worked behind-the-scenes on the series. Additionally, ''Avenue Q'' performer Natalie Venetia Belcon (Gary Coleman) appeared on the series in a regular role as Gwen.
