'''Mr. Pricklepants''' is a supporting character in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], first appearing in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. He is a stuffed hedgehog toy.

==Personality==
He wears lederhosen and usually views himself as a thespian. Mr. Pricklepants was made in Germany and is from the Waldfreunde collection of premium imported plush toys like [[Wikipedia:Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is from Japan. He is the ''de facto'' leader of [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]'s toys and takes playtime as a job in acting. He warns Woody of how dangerous Lotso is and helps him get back to [[Sunnyside Daycare]]. In the credits, Mr. Pricklepants welcomes Woody and his friends to Bonnie's house and is seen playing Romeo in a version of Romeo and Juliet with one of the [[Little Green Men|Alien]] toys as Juliet.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Mr. Pricklepants is a thespian hedgehog in lederhosen who says that he's "trying to stay in character," even when [[Woody]] tried inquiring as to his whereabouts. As [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] began playtime with her toys, she spits a jellybean onto Mr. Pricklepants in response to one of Woody's automated voices mentioning poison. He noted how well Woody did at playtime and figured he must have been a classically trained actor, whereas Woody says it came naturally to him due to his years with Andy. Once Bonnie went to sleep, her toys helped Woody chart a path to [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s [[Andy's House|house]]. But when he mentions passing a message to his fellow toys at [[Sunnyside Daycare]], Bonnie's toys become alarmed and ask how he escaped. Mr. Pricklepants describes Sunnyside as "a place of ruin and despair, ruled by an [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|evil bear who smells of strawberries]]." He points out [[Chuckles the Clown|Chuckles]] to testify. Despite their warnings that it's too dangerous to return to Sunnyside, Woody went anyway and rescued his friends. His warnings were valid, as Woody found himself under the iron fist of Lotso. The next day, Woody returns to Bonnie's house with his friends, having been donated by Andy. When Andy leaves, Mr. Pricklepants is seen talking with [[Hamm]].

In the end credits, he plays Romeo, alongside an [[Little Green Men|Alien]] who is playing Juliet.

=== ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' ===
Mr. Pricklepants only appears briefly in the fourth installment, only at the beginning and end. He is first seen throughout the "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]" sequence, being played with by Bonnie.

Two years after the third film, Mr. Pricklepants now lives with the rest of Andy's toys with Bonnie being their new owner. He first appears with the rest of the toys waiting in the closet for Bonnie to finish her breakfast. The toys are cramped and annoyed with one another. He, along with many of the other toys, is played with more prominently than Woody, who Bonnie neglects. When Bonnie arrives in her room, she plays "town", and casts Mr. Pricklepants as the "baker" while leaving Woody alone in the closet. Woody watches in sadness as the other toys are played with. Suddenly, Bonnie's father walks in and tells her to get ready for kindergarten orientation, much to her dismay. When Bonnie asks if she can bring a toy (namely Jessie) with her, Mr. Anderson says toys aren't allowed in school. After they leave, the toys are about to get up when Dolly tells everyone to freeze, since Bonnie always forgets something and could be back any second. Woody comes out of the closet to speak to Dolly. Before talking to him, Dolly is seen dealing with Mr. Pricklepant's complaints about being cast as the baker, saying that the hat-shop owner is "the role he was born to play". Dolly quickly shoos him away and tells him to go back to his bakery, much to his sadness. Despite Dolly's protests, after seeing Bonnie crying under her bed when she comes back into the room, Woody decides to sneak into her backpack to keep an eye on her. During her orientation, she creates Forky, a spork who suddenly comes to life.

When Bonnie returns and drops her backpack off in her room, Woody climbs out and is scolded by the rest of the gang for breaking the rules. But Woody alleviates the situation by saying that not only did Bonnie have a great day in class and they're all going on a road trip (to which the Aliens "ooh" in excitement despite not going), but Bonnie made a literal friend in class. Woody pulls out Forky and introduces him to the gang. Like the others, Mr. Pricklepants is both shocked and confused by both Forky's existence and his love of trash. When Woody says that Forky is the most important toy to Bonnie right now, Mr. Pricklepants questions this by obviously saying that he is a spork. They then watch in confusion as Woody fishes Forky out of the trash, saying how he'll keep an eye on his during the road trip.

A year later after Woody leaves the gang to join [[Bo Peep]] as a lost toy, Bonnie drops off her backpack after her first-grade orientation. Jessie emerges from the bag and is barraged with questions by the other toys. Jessie interrupts everyone by saying Bonnie made another new friend and introduces the gang to [[Karen Beverly]], a toy knife Forky becomes smitten over.
