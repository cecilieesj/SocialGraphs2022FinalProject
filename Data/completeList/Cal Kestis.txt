'''Cal Kestis''' is the protagonist the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]''. He is a Jedi Knight and one of the few Jedi who survived the Great Jedi Purge.

==Background==
===Personality===
Having been raised in the Jedi Order, Cal is a selfless individual with a strong moral compass and a deep-seated sense of honor. He is usually calm and collected and shows great respect for all lifeforms and even droids, no matter how hostile they act towards him. Despite his heroic qualities, Cal was heavily traumatized by Order 66 and the subsequent death of his master, refusing to talk to anyone about it for many years. After confronting the vision of his master on Dathomir a second time, however, Cal accepted the events of the past and grew from the experience, becoming wiser and even mentor-like to everyone he meets. Cal's compassion even extends to people he's never met, as seen when he destroyed the Jedi holocron, making it harder for the Empire to find other Force sensitives.

==Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]''===
Cal Kestis is a former Jedi Padawan who managed to survive Order 66 and go into hiding. Five years into the Galactic Empire's reign, Cal scrapes out a living in the scrapyards of the planet Bracca alongside his friend and co-worker, Prauf. One day, while helping disassemble a Republic cruiser, Cal and Prauf come across a Jedi starfighter on the top of the wreck, reminding Cal of his time in the Jedi Order. Suddenly, the ship collapses out from under them and Prauf nearly falls to his death, but Cal uses the Force to save him. On the train ride home, Cal makes plans to leave Bracca as soon as possible and Prauf agrees to keep his secret safe. 

Following a dream about his master, Jaro Topal, the train is stopped and Cal and the other passengers are ordered outside for questioning. A probe droid had spotted Cal using the Force, prompting the Empire to send two of its Inquisitors, the Second Sister and the Ninth Sister, to hunt him down. The Second Sister demands that the Jedi come forward or she will have all the scrappers killed. Despite Cal's insistence, Prauf confesses to being the Jedi and the Second Sister kills him without hesitation, causing Cal to attack her in anger. The Ninth Sister drops Cal off a cliff, but he manages to land on a passing train. Fighting his way to the front, Cal is nearly killed by an Imperial fighter, but is saved by the ''Stinger Mantis'', whose leader, Cere Junda, urges him to keep moving. At the end of the line, the Second Sister catches up to Cal and nearly kills him, but the ''Mantis'' crew saves him just in time.

Once safe in hyperspace, Cal is properly introduced to the crew of the ''Mantis'': Cere Junda (another Jedi survivor) and Greez Dritus (the captain and pilot). Cere explains that she plans to rebuild the Jedi Order using a holocron containing the names and locations of Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy, hidden away in a temple on the planet Bogano. Having nowhere else to go, Cal agrees to help. On Bogano, Cal makes the acquaintance of BD-1, a friendly droid that used to belong to another Jedi named Eno Cordova, and slowly begins to heal his connection to the Force. Exploring the planet, Cal discovers that Cordova was investigating an ancient race of Force-sensitives called the Zeffo. 

Inside the temple, Cal learns from an old recording of Cordova that in order to receive the holocron, he’ll need to find the tombs of three Zeffo Sages, one on the planet Zeffo itself and another on the dark world Dathomir. Back at the ''Mantis'', Cal learns that Cordova was Cere’s old master and asks why she stopped being a Jedi. She explains that an event in her past changed her perspective, but still believes that reforming the Jedi is the best chance of defeating the Empire. Cal agrees, and orders Greez to set course for Zeffo.

Upon arriving, Cal investigates a strong Imperial presence on the planet.
