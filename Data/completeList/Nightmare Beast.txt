The '''Nightmare Beast''' is a character that was featured in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]]. It is a large black monster serving as the antagonist of the fictional video game, ''Legends of Legend Quest Dereznaroth''.

==Background==
The Nightmare Beast serves as an enemy featured in the ''Legends of Legend Quest Dereznaroth'' video game. It is known to be an obstacle to players causing negativity throughout the game and any players who are not careful may get struck by its laser blast.

===Physical Appearance===
The Nightmare Beast is an airborne monster enemy with six eyes, each having five eyes surrounding its center eye, black and red spikes, two small dragonlike wings, and six black tentacles.

==Role in the series==
First appearing in the Season 2 episode, "[[Happy Birthday, Doofus Drake!]]", [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey]] and his mother [[Della Duck|Della]] enter a video game as their characters' avatars where they notice the Nightmare Beast destroying a rutabaga field (one of the players' important resources) to which upon noticing the monster destroy the crops, Huey attempts to face the monster that destroyed the crops. As Della takes on the monster, Huey decides to level up to become stronger to face the monster by approaching a glowing spot to strike the Beast in super power mode. Attacking the monster to save his mother, Huey continues striking it before it attempts to have another chance to attack just before it disappears. The sequence fades to Della and Huey in the real world after defeating the monster.

The Nightmare Beast makes a brief appearance in the Season 3 episode, "[[The Phantom and the Sorceress!]]".  It briefly appears where it pops out of the television ejecting [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]], [[Lena Sabrewing|Lena]], and [[Violet Sabrewing]] out of the television while playing ''Legends of Legend Quest Dereznaroth''. It ferociously snarls at the children just before [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] uses a platter to reflect the Nightmare Beast's laser attack to intercept its attack and counter the monster, defeating it and sending it back to its own game.
