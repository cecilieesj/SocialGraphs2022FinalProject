'''Jeremiah Tortoise''' is an elderly Tortoise, who was introduced in the third season of ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''.

==Role in the series==
The old tortoise works in the [[Woodland Valley Post Office]]. Jeremiah is also the sole proprietor of the Woodland Valley General Store. Avuncular but slightly absent-minded, Jeremiah recalls the days when [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]] was attending high school. The tortoise is friends with [[Doc Hogg]] and is the great-grandson of Woodland Valley founder Hephaestus Tortoise. Jeremiah is the judge for the Annual Woodland Valley Storytelling Festival. Regarding his age, Jeremiah quips that he is old enough to not remember how old he is. In ''[[Grandma Flutter's 100th Birthday]]'', Flutter states that he is 112 years old.

The puppet was recycled from Penelope the Yellow-Footed Tortoise, and was also used as one of the pet shop animals in ''Kermit's Swamp Years,'' sans hair and goatee. It was subsequently used in ''Puppet Up!'' shows.
