'''King George III''' is a major antagonist featured in the [[2020]] film ''[[Hamilton]]'' as the King of Great Britain who believed that the Colonies would not be successful in their revolution.

==Appearance==
After [[Alexander Hamilton]] argues with Samuel Seabury, (“Farmer Refuted”) the ensemble sings that a message from the king will arrive shortly. Sure enough, King George III shows a strong assumption that he will win the Revolutionary War ("You'll Be Back").

However, following America's success, the king becomes rather irritated and sad, saying that America cheated on England with France and that he is now fighting with France and with Spain, referring to the [[wikipedia:Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|Anglo-French War]] and [[wikipedia:Anglo-Spanish War (1796–1808)|Anglo-Spanish War]] respectively. ("What Comes Next?").

Once [[George Washington]] steps down, King George learns of this and questions who might replace him. A soldier brings news that John Adams, will be Washington's replacement, and the king recalls having met him years ago in 1785, believing him to be a "little guy" that the Americans will eat alive. Musingly anticipating Adams' presidency, King George wishes him luck ("I Know Him"). 

While King George does not sing again, during “The Reynolds Pamphlet,” the king jeers at Alexander Hamilton alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]] and James Madison. The three of them throw pieces of paper around the stage and mock Hamilton.

The songs of George III are widely considered as light comic relief but each one has a purpose in setting the scene for the next section of the show and phase of Hamilton’s life. He first appears after the characters have been introduced, to threaten the colonies. This introduces the Revolutionary War which highlights Hamilton as the military man and concludes with “The Battle of Yorktown”. He then re-appears to give warning about the political difficulties he believes the new nation will face post-independence. This precedes the next section where military battles are replaced by political battles and Washington declares “Winning was easy... governing’s harder”. In this section the audience sees Hamilton the politician. King George’s final appearance is to offer grudging respect for Washington and to mock his replacement John Adams, introducing a period of chaos for Hamilton beginning with “The Adams Administration”. This is where the audience witnesses his decline.

King George III is perceived in the show to be insane, claiming that "When push comes to shove, I will kill your friends and family, to remind you of my love.” In fact, the king did suffer bouts of insanity which many have claimed to have been porphyria, and some say that his medicine, which contained large amounts of arsenic, worsened his condition. <ref>https://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Spring10/king.cfm</ref>
