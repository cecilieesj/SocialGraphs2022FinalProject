The '''Orange Bird''' is a character created by Disney for the [[Florida]] Citrus Commission as a mascot and has been a prominently featured character in [[Magic Kingdom|Magic Kingdom's]] [[Adventureland]] at the [[Sunshine Tree Terrace]] located near [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]. 

==History==

=== Background ===
The Orange Bird is a small bird resembling an orange, or possibly an orange with the features of a bird.  Regardless, the Orange Bird used to live up north in the United States before deciding to migrate to [[Florida]] for its high quantity of citrus to eat.  It would come to live in the Sunshine Tree of [[Adventureland]].

Unlike other birds, the Orange Bird is incapable of singing or speaking and instead communicates with orange-colored thought bubbles. He is mocked by other birds as a result of this and Orange Bird generally looks for friends wherever he goes.

=== Development History ===
The Orange Bird was created in [[1970]] as a mascot for the Florida Citrus Commission in exchange for them sponsoring the Tiki Room attraction at Magic Kingdom. Accompanied by singer [[Anita Bryant]], the two appeared in ads for Florida oranges and Bryant narrated a record album telling the character's story. After the Anita Bryant ad campaign was dropped in the late 70s, the Orange Bird had a solo career and appeared in a few educational shorts in the [[1980]]s such as ''[[Foods and Fun: A Nutrition Adventure]]'' and ''The Orange Bird and the Nutrition Bandwagon''. Eventually, the bird would fade into obscurity when Disney and the FCC severed their ties in [[1987]].

Years later, at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] in [[2004]], the Orange Bird would experience a revival as the Japanese became infatuated with the character and the character received a lot of merchandising to coincide with Japan's annual Orange Day on [[April 14]]th of that year. The Orange Bird soon returned to appearing regularly on merchandise in the US as well.

Eventually, on [[April 17]], [[2012]], the Orange Bird made a proper return to the [[Sunshine Tree Terrace]].

[[File:OrangeBirdMarvel.png|thumb|250px|The Orange Bird in Disney Kingdoms.]]
The Orange Bird appears in ''[[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]]''. Initially cameoing as a stuffed animal in the first issue, the Orange Bird appears in the flesh in the second issue, where he offers to fill in for Jose after he decided to quit. His inability to actually sing results in him being turned down, but the macaws are thankful for his offer anyways.

In issue three, Wally meets the Orange Bird while strolling through the island and sees him as a Guardian Angel to help him with his troubles. However, he is not very good at interpreting the Orange Bird's picture bubbles, leading him to make bad decisions.

In the final issue, the Orange Bird offers Saoirse the simple wordless advice of actually talking to her father and creates tickets for a stay on the Enchanted Tiki Room island for her and her father to help bond.

==== Little Golden Books ====
The Orange Bird's self-titled Little Golden Book places the Orange Bird and the Sunshine Tree in an orange grove in Florida where he has befriended the grove's farmer and birds resembling the [[Aracuan Bird]], [[Sonia]], and [[Professor Owl]]. When the farmer's cat Clementine bullies the birds on the farm, the Orange Bird is able to use his thought bubbles to imitate the farmer to get her to back down, just in time for the farmer himself to step in and bring the cat back inside.

The Orange Bird makes a cameo in the ''[[Inside Out]]'' book, ''[[The Bing Bong Book]]''.

== Trivia ==

* It was widely speculated that Orange Bird had Autism, until [[Bob Chapek]] denied that the character had any disabilities in a 2020 interview.
