==History==
Like [[Timothy North]], Farnsworth was an actor in ''The Fearless Ferret''. He portrayed the supervillain White Stripe and he also went delusional as North did when they believed the adventures of the Fearless Ferret were all real and they were the hero and villain their roles were. When [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] went as the Fearless Ferret, Farnsworth went back as White Stripe to destroy Ron. To destroy the reputation of the Fearless Ferret, White Stripe stole every stinky thing and put all the stench from it into a giant skunk balloon and pop to stink up the Fearless Ferret convention. He went back to normal in the end and joined North in the crowd of cheering fans in the convention.
