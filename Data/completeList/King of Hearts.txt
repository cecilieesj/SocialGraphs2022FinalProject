Hmm?"|shorts=|designer=|actress=|model=|awards=|fullname=|alias=|affiliations=|pets=|minions=|powers=|paraphernalia=|weapons=|possessions=|partner=[[Queen of Hearts]] (wife)|status=Active}}The '''King of Hearts''' is the meek and tiny husband of the temperamental [[Queen of Hearts]] from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1951]] feature film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

==Background==
The King of Hearts is the consort of the Queen of Hearts, and, unlike most instances, is generally the lesser of the two monarchs. He is much smaller than his wife, as well as meeker. While he tries to please his wife, at the same time, he is one of the few people who is able to change her mind about anything, such as altering [[Alice]]'s beheading to a trial instead. He seems to act more like a son to his wife than a husband, as he asks her to put Alice on trial in a childlike manner, and she pats him on the head like he were a child after taking his suggestion for the trial, as well as using him as a shield against an oversized Alice.

=== Physical appearance ===
He is shown to be much small than the Queen wearing a long red robe (though he wears a rather large crown for him). He has orange hair with a darker mustache. He is also shown to often be holding a heart, held on by a stick.

== Appearances ==

===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
The King makes appearances during the later portion of the film. He is seen as the timid husband of the Queen and is shown to get a lesser greeting from the audience often asking the [[White Rabbit]] for a greeting (this becoming a running gag during the end of the film). Upon him and the Queen meeting Alice, he is the one that declares her being a girl.

When the Queen gets mad at Alice stating "Off with her Head!" though the King asks the Queen to give Alice a trial (at least a little trial), with the Queen conceding.

At the trial later on the King is present once again asking the White Rabbit to introduce him, the rabbit conceding. After the Queen says the sentence first and the verdict, the King says that they should bring in some witnesses. When the [[Mad Hatter]] says it is his un-birthday, the King tells him that it is her un-brithday too, exciting the Queen. After Alice gets larger and then shrinks the King partakes in the search of Alice, though then he ceases to exist as Alice wakes up, realizing it was all just a dream.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
The King of Hearts appeared several times alongside the Queen and other Wonderland characters in the audience of the [[House of Mouse (nightclub)|House of Mouse]]. In [[Goofy's Valentine Date|''Goofy's Valentine Date'']], the sponsor was Queen of Heart greeting cards with the King briefly appearing in his gag of being lesser than the Queen, he is then seen thrown away as a croquet ball by the Queen.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Prince Henry Mills is the son of [[King Xavier]]. He is the husband of [[Queen of Hearts|Cora Mills]] and father to [[The Evil Queen|Regina Mills]]. In the [[Enchanted Forest]], he marries Cora after she demonstrates the ability to spin straw into gold. He is later the loving but weak father of the Evil Queen, Regina, and serves as her royal valet in the Enchanted Forest. Henry is supportive of Regina, but does not protect her against the manipulations or actions of her mother. He is later held captive in [[Wonderland]] by Cora as leverage against Regina, who eventually rescues him. However, when [[Rumplestiltskin]] informs Regina she must retrieve the [[heart]] of who she loves most to enact his dark curse, she kills him. In [[Storybrooke]], Regina appears to have cared a great deal for her father, naming her adopted son [[Henry Mills|Henry]] and turning his tomb into a large mausoleum. After his death, Henry was sent to the [[Underworld]].

Years later while trying to find [[Captain Hook|Hook]], Regina meets him, who apologies for her actions back in the Enchanted Forest. Later, Cora threatens to send him to Hell. When at the entrance to Hell, Regina tries to persuade her mother not to send her father to Hell which she starts to do. What Cora doesn't know is that Henry was spared upon his unfinished business of Regina being free of her mother. Henry then meets his grandson Henry. Before heading to [[Mount Olympus]], Henry tells his grandson to watch over his daughter and to remember who she is.
