'''Owlbert''' is [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]]'s [[palisman]] in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
Eda made Owlbert (with her father's help) from the branch of a palistrum tree, a tradition that has become rare due to overharvesting. Eda often uses him to either steal from the human realm or as a distraction against opponents. Despite being an enchanted object used to cast magic, Owlbert has a sense of independence and can attach and reattach from his staff either by command or on his own free will. He has a very close bond with Eda, who is shown to be protective of him.

===Physical appearance===
Owlbert bears the appearance of a typical owl, displaying brown-toned feathers, golden-yellow eyes, and orange feet. A staff-binding interlock is located underneath his right foot that allows him to detach from atop of Eda's staff.

==Trivia==
*The name Owlbert is a play on the name "Albert".
*Owlbert shares the same name as a [[1988]] children's book title ''Owlbert'' written by Nicholas Harris.
*According to Eda's mug shot in "[[Once Upon a Swap]]" her staff (with Owlbert on top) is a total of 5'9" (1.75m) tall.
