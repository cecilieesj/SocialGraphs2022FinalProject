}}'''Harry the Duck''' is introduced during the third season of ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' in the episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_303:_Lost_and_Found Lost and Found]."
Harry really looks up to [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear]], but has trouble relating to him informally. He calls him "Mr. Bear," despite Bear's assurances that it's okay to simply call him "Bear."

In contrast to the other characters, Harry is still working on speaking without making animal sounds. Therefore, his speech is sometimes punctuated by loud quacking.

Harry lives with his mama at the Otter Pond, although they call it the Duck Pond. He often visits the Big Blue House to play, though.

In the fourth season, Harry became a big brother when his little sister, Hallie, hatched.
