'''Skippy''' is a blind squirrel who appears in the ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' fourth season episode titled ''[[The Amazing Skippy]]''. Skippy and [[Treelo]] are good friends and Treelo introduces Skippy his friends at [[The Big Blue House]]. Skippy wears sunglasses and uses a cane. Treelo, the kids in the Big Blue House and his friends think of him as "amazing" because of his keen abilities with senses other than sight. Skippy generally enjoys the same sorts of things that the other kids do, such as games like hide-and-seek, and going to the movies.

The puppet was recycled from squirrel [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Gabe Gabe] on ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Telling_Stories_with_Tomie_dePaola Telling Stories with Tomie dePaola]'', and reappeared even later on ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Puppet_Up!_-_Uncensored Puppet Up! - Uncensored]''.
