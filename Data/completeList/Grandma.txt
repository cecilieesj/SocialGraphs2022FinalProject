===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Granny appears in ''Once Upon a Time'', portrayed by Beverley Elliott. As a girl, a wolf killed her father and brothers and then also transformed her into a wolf. The other aspects of the curse faded with age, but her heightened senses remain. Her granddaughter [[Little Red Riding Hood|Red]] inherited the family curse and is also a wolf, though Granny received an enchanted red cloak from a wizard, to prevent her transformation. When her granddaughter begins a relationship with a man called [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]], she disapproves. As news of a wolf killing villagers becomes known, Granny warns the others not to fight the monster. Red and Snow White believe Peter is the wolf, until Granny informs [[Snow White|Snow]] of her curse. By the time she and Snow find Red, she had already killed Peter. Later she assist Snow, Red and the seven dwarfs assault King George's castle to rescue Prince Charming. Granny is transported to the real world when [[The Evil Queen|the Evil Queen Regina]] casts her curse. 

In Storybrooke, she is known simply as Granny and is the owner of Granny's Bed and Breakfast and Cafe. Her health problems prevent Ruby (Red Riding Hood) from leaving town, who assists her grandmother as a waitress. Their relationship is initially hostile as Granny disapproves of Ruby's behavior and provocative attire. Ruby becomes tired of her grandmother and quits her job, though she eventually returns and apologizes to her. She reveals her plans to allow Red to take over when she retires. Granny's memories are returned when the curse is broken by Emma Swan, and she embraces her family and friends. After [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] enacts the original curse once more, Granny, along with the other inhabitants, are returned to their original worlds. When Snow White and [[The Prince|Prince Charming]] enact a new curse as part of their plan to stop [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]], the Wicked Witch of the West, Granny is sent back to [[Storybrooke]].
