'''LaCienega Boulevardez''' is a supporting character from [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[The Proud Family]]''. She is Penny's nemesis and later frenemy.

==History==
She is the Latina frenemy of [[Penny Proud|Penny]]. She is rich, beautiful, and was once voted the most popular girl at school. She once started a rumor about Penny and nerdy boy [[Myron Lewinski|Myron]] because she was mad that Penny did not invite her to a party she threw. She is 15 years old. 

==Physical Appearance==
LaCienega wears a red cardigan, a pink shirt, and blue jeans. She even has long brown hair with a red flower hair-clip to match her cardigan. She also wears blue shoes and pink socks that match her jeans and shirt respectively. She also wears a red bracelet that correlates with her jacket and flower. It's usually seen on her left wrist but on her right in some ways.

In the reboot, LaCienega no longer a bracelet and instead wears a magenta-colored hair clip. 

==Personality==
LaCienega appears to be very conceited, but deep down, she's sensitive, unsure and a bit jealous of Penny because she's a grounded individual. Penny is usually stuck with her and they consistently fight one another. Early in the show, LaCienega was able to convince Penny's family that she was a very cute little lady, when in fact, she was arrogant, vain, selfish, snobbish, and obnoxious. In later episodes, Penny's mother seems to have caught onto LaCienega's "perfect angel" routine and she starts to let her true colors show more often. Penny and LaCienega mainly hang out with each other due to their parents and grandparents are best friends and they share the same group of friends, but eventually they get used to each other and began enjoying each other's company. Deep down, she likes Penny quite a bit, but is too arrogant to outright show or admit it. She is also a founding member of an R&B girl group called L.P.D.Z. 

LaCienega has plenty of flaws in her personality and is particularly a problem for Penny, but deep down she is very sensitive and cares a lot about her family and friends, even Penny. For example, She, along with Dijonay showed concern for Penny's safety by looking after her while Gary was aggressively hitting on her at a high school party they attended after winning the Hip Hop Helicopter Dance Contest. She once risked her safety and freedom to help her grandfather Papi Boulevardez from Happy Endings Retirement Home due to her perents will never seem to care as much about his well being as she did. She's also a hard worker. Like Penny, she too gets straight A's in school and also likes to keep herself and all of her belongings neat. She gradually becomes nicer towards the end of the original series while still retaining her iconic sassiness.

==Trivia==
*LaCienega's name translates to "the wetlands" or "the swamp" in Spanish.
[[File:LaCienegaKarate.png|thumb|right|150px|LaCienega with normal-sized feet.]]
*It was revealed in "[[Love Thy Neighbor]]" that LaCienega has big duck-like feet and she's also a good swimmer and that she seems to wear water shoes when she goes to the beach or to the pool.
**Ironically, although she is ashamed of her big feet, when LaCienaga was crowned the winner in a beauty contest by [[Wizard Kelly]], she was supremely confident on stage wearing a yellow swimsuit and being barefoot.
**​However, in other episodes, LaCienaga's feet are normal sized instead of large.
**#In "[[Hip-Hop Helicopter]]", LaCienega's feet are shown to be normal size when she, Penny, Zoey, and Dijonay wore their skimpy outfits on live TV.
**#​In "[[A Star is Scorned (The Proud Family)|A Star is Scorned]]", LaCienaga's feet are shown to be small when she is wearing platform sandals.
**#In "[[Crouching Trudy, Hidden Penny]]", When LaCienega was barefooted for almost the entire episode, her feet are shown to be normal.
**#In "[[Psycho Duck]]", when Penny saved Chester from drowning, LaCienega's feet are small.
**However, in "[[Raging Bully (The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder)|Raging Bully]]", LaCienega's feet are shown to be big again when she is hanging from "Suga Mama's Drop of Doom" ride at Snackland.
*LaCienega and [[Sunset Boulevardez|her mother]] are named after {{WikipediaLink|La Cienega Boulevard}} and {{WikipediaLink|Sunset Boulevard}}, two Los Angeles area arterial roads that meet in West Hollywood, California.
**Her aunt and cousin are also named after streets in Los Angeles, Melrose Avenue and La Brea Avenue, respectively.
*LaCienega used to have more of a Spanish accent, but finally, her voice became more loud and raspy.
*Ironically, LaCienega has shown herself to be a better friend to Penny than Dijonay on several occasions, such as in [[The Camp, the Counselor, the Mole, and the Rock]] where LaCienega offered Penny her breath mints and lip gloss so that her breath would never smell bad in the event she got to kiss Tory. She also covered for Penny as promised when her dad angrily rushed in to pull Penny out of camp and ground her, while Dijonay eagerly sold Penny out.
*In "[[Father Figures]]", she still has not forgiven [[Michael Collins]] for making fun of her big feet.
