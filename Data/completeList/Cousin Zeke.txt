'''Zeke''' is [[Pete|Pete's]] southern cousin from the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' cartoon short, ''[[Mickey's Cabin]]''. Like his cousin, he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].

==Role in the short==
After getting tricked into saving Pete from a snowstorm, Mickey is captured and snowbound with Pete and his cousin Zeke, who have stolen an ATM. However, Mickey outwits the two cousins with various techniques, for example, getting the cash out of the ATM, checking the food freshness, framing each other, dividing out the money, and lastly, trapping them in jail. After they both realize they are in jail, Zeke and Pete begin to blame each other.

== Trivia ==
* Zeke is not to be confused with [[Big Bad Wolf|Zeke Wolf]], the main antagonist in the ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'' cartoons. Co-incidentally, both characters are currently voiced by Jim Cummings.
