|quote= "As your gift for Christmas this year, I hope you get the measles! You have a heart that's made of stone! Take this you weasel!"||birthday = July 8th, 1999|games = ''[[Just Dance: Disney Party]]''}}'''Chyna Anne Parks''' is a musical prodigy and the main protagonist of the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[A.N.T. Farm]]''. Needless to say, she can play several instruments including the guitar, violin, and piano. She is a talented singer and surprises people with her strong, beautiful voice. Her other talents are dancing, cheerleading and drama. Never afraid of a challenge, she sees high school as an exciting place. Unfortunately, she needs to drag her new friends, Olive and Fletcher, out of their shells to experience it. She is teased by Lexi because Lexi sees her as a threat. Chyna is usually playing instruments or being mischievous.

==Personality==

Chyna is an optimistic, witty, bright, and outgoing girl who loves to stand out. She is not meek. However, her father doesn't like her going to parties or hanging out with boys. Most of the time, Chyna is shown trying to find a place where she feels she belongs, usually dragging Fletcher and Olive to join.
Chyna usually gets Olive and Fletcher to join in with events, such as organizing prom and the ANTernet. She also doesn't like people feeling left out or upset when she can do something about it. She also doesn't like to let people down. However, when she does this she tends to find out she's being conned.

==Season 1==

In TransplANTed, she's immediately excited by the look of her new school, with a bonus of cute guys. At the [[A.N.T. Farm]], [[Gibson]] welcomes her. Chyna then meets Olive, who immediately starts giving out facts on China's ''(the country)'' Dynasties. Chyna thinks her talent is talking but Olive says she has an [[Wikipedia:eidetic memory|eidetic memory]]. Chyna then meets [[Angus]] and almost launches a missile controlled by a joystick, thinking it's a game. She proceeds to see Fletcher carrying a human sculpture to her confusion. Fletcher explains that he's an artist, and is sculpting the class for an assignment. In music class, Chyna accidentally sits in Lexi's chair, so Lexi pushes her off it to see if this ''"Chyna is breakable"''. [[Mr. Zimbaldi]] notices Chyna on the ground and helps her up, seeing that she's a new prodigy. He then asks her to play something on the violin, which Chyna wows everyone with. During signups, Chyna mocks Lexi. Olive then yells at Chyna not to mess with the big kids. During lunch, Chyna overhears Lexi and Paisley discussing Lexi's party tonight. Eager to go, Chyna invites Olive and Fletcher to join her. Upstairs, she has Fletcher make wax figures of themselves so they can sneak out. At the party, Cameron catches Chyna there, but she noticed he was supposed to be at church. Cameron explains that he paid [[Angus]] to rig the tracking device on his phone. She then finds a super hyper Olive who just drank a bunch of Red Viper that Lexi gave her. Olive then knocks into Fletcher who crashes the stereo, ruining the party. Chyna then plays guitar and performs, saving the party, and enraging Lexi. Then, [[Darryl Parks|her Dad]] shows up with [[Gibson]] and crashes the party. The next day, Chyna surprises Olive and Fletcher when she has a whole music station set up and says they're gonna need a lot more wax figures if they want to have some more fun.

In ParticipANTs, Chyna and Olive search for extracurricular activities to join. Chyna and Olive come up to the Cheerleading table where Lexi is. Lexi thinks Chyna should tryout for Cheerleading, so she and Olive do. At tryouts, Olive fails when she uses a super long cheer on wolves, while Chyna accidentally launches her shoe at Paisley's face. Unbelievably, Chyna makes the squad, but Olive doesn't. At the [[A.N.T. Farm]], since Lexi says Chyna needs to practice, she cheers everything she says, annoying Olive. She then takes a raincheck to get a weave with the other Cheerleaders, leaving Olive looking for a new friend. At practice, Lexi wears Chyna out with several exercises, leading to Chyna losing her voice, which is exactly what Lexi wanted so she can't tryout for the school play. At tryouts for the school play, Chyna's injured and ugly, but she still tries. She gives a heartbreaking speech which lands her the lead role, which was the same speech by the Hunchback Of Notre Dame.

In The PhANTom Locker, Chyna has a crush on a High Schooler, and later helps Olive get over her fear of her ''"haunted"'' locker, by tricking her into getting into her locker at night, but later finds out that Cameron was the ghost, after Olive moves into her locker and ''"organizes"'' it for her.

In StudANT Council, Olive tricked Chyna into running for student council because she didn't want to. Chyna thus gets mad at Olive and tricks her into running for student council. Then they both try to not get elected by doing bad things. Later on, Cameron is named A.N.T. Farm representative. In Bad RomANTs, Chyna and Fletcher help [[Gibson]] get back together with his girlfriend, Sophie. In The InformANT, Chyna digs through the trash to get a Free-Village bag and is accused of shoplifting by [[Darryl Parks|her dad]]. So, she makes his think that as revenge when she finds out.

In ReplicANT, she begins to like [[Nigel]], a new kid in the A.N.T. program, and Fletcher gets jealous. In ClairvoyANT, she convinces Cameron he's psychic after he feels down about not having a talent. In ManagemANT, she almost becomes famous when Hippo, a record producer, sees her perform Soccer Ball on the Internet. He changes her name, makes her wear a ridiculous costume, and almost makes her film a music video for his song, Lunchtime before he comes to his senses and lets her perform Unstoppable. In PhilANThropy, she saves [[Gibson]] from being fired by doing a Save Gibson web-a-thon. In FraudulANT, she helps Fletcher retrieve a painting his idol, Zanko, stole and passed off as his own. In The ReplacemANT, she gets Olive as her history teacher, and tries to get rid of her with the rest of the class after she becomes too mean.

In MutA.N.T. Farm, Chyna experiences her first day in the "MutA.N.T. Farm" and helps separate the barrier between the regular kids and the MutANTs. In cANTonese Style Cuisine, Chyna meets Madam GooGoo (spoof of Lady Gaga), after Madam Goo Goo hears Chyna singing a new "Happy Birthday" song that Chyna wrote, and gets her phone number. However, when the A.N.T.s go to a fortune factory, Chyna realizes she lost Madam Goo Goo's phone number in the vat of dough. But the problem is, she has to search all the fortune cookie, with the help of [[Olive Doyle|Olive]], [[Fletcher Quimby|Fletcher]] and Angus, before anybody else finds it. To sneak in back to the fortune factory, Chyna and Olive disguise themselves as workers. Eventually they find the fortune cookie with Madam Goo Goo's phone number in it, after Madan Goo Goo appears in the fortune factory, and Chyna confesses to her that she lost her phone number, and Madam Goo Goo randomly opens a fortune cookie to write down her number again and finds her number already written on the paper. At the end of the episode, Chyna and Madam Goo Goo perform the birthday song for one of the cheerleaders birthday. ("Born This Day by Madam Googoo and Chyna Parks, a parody of Lady Gaga's "Born This Way").

In IgnorANTs Is Bliss, Principal Skidmore makes Chyna write a speech for an Open House for the perspective A.N.T.'s and their parents. After [[Cameron Parks|Cameron]] accidentally breaks her A.N.T. Pad, (which is where she kept her speech safe), [[Olive Doyle|Olive&nbsp;volunteers]] to help Chyna record her speech (since Olive remembers every word from what Chyna wrote on her speech, since she has an eidetic memory). But when a deafening noise (caused by Fletcher) makes Olive lose her memory, Chyna, Fletcher, and Angus go to great lengths to get her memory back before Principal Skidmore dismisses her from the A.N.T. Program and sends her back to kindergarten. At the end of the episode it is shown that Olive did lose her memory, up until the point when she got trampled in the hallway, then her memory came back. She doesn't want to leave kindergarten but later feels bad when an angry Chyna finds out and leaves Olive's kindergarten class when she thanked her by making her re-write her speech again. Later at the Open House, Chyna's speech gets out of order when Fletcher knocks into Chyna, and she says some of the speech that didn't sound right. Olive steps into the A.N.T. Farm and helps her best friend deliver the speech. After the speech is done, Olive apologizes and they hug.

Farm, but while at the slumber party, she gets a video chat request from [[Lexi Reed|Lexi]], and it turns out that all of the girls that Chyna invited are at [[Lexi Reed|Lexi]] slumber party. Chyna then lies that her slumber party has a world famous stylist and a sushi chef. But when everybody from [[Lexi Reed|Lexi's]] party shows up at Chyna's house, Chyna tells them that [[Fletcher Quimby|Fletcher]] ''(who was at Chyna's house because he wanted to be at the slumber party, because it's an all girl party, and to get closer to Chyna)'' is the world famous stylist, and since [[Fletcher Quimby|Fletcher's]] talent is art, he shows them that he does do a good job on hair.

At the end, they save the jack-in-the-boxes and they hug the orphans.

In Some EnchANTed Evening, after Chyna learns that [[Fletcher Quimby|Fletcher]] has a crush on her, she lies about having a boyfriend, then later finds a fake one, for the double date that [[Olive Doyle|Olive]] set up for [[Fletcher Quimby|Fletcher]] and his girlfriend and Chyna and her boyfriend.
