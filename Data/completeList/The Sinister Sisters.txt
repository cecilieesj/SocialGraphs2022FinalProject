[[File:Sinister Sisters.jpg|thumb|250px|Sapphire, Sage and Scarlett Sinister]]
'''Scarlett, Sapphire, and Sage Sinister''' are all evil witches attending [[Witch University]] and the daughters of [[Silas Sinister]]. While Sapphire and Sage act as the twin-followers, Scarlett acts as the ring-leader. They secretly defy the "No Magic" rule by using their powers whenever there is no teacher watching. They work with a few professors and their father to make [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]] open a box with the Cromwell family's ultimate magic in it. In the end, their plan backfires and they lose their family's magic and become humans as punishment for their father's crimes.
