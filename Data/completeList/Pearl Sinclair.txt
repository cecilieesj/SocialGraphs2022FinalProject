She was voiced by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Susan_Norfleet Susan Norfleet], her body was puppeteered by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Fisher Tom Fisher] and her face was operated by [[Rickey Boyd]].

Pearl is a successful country singer, having set out on her own not long before the death of their father some 18 years ago, leaving Earl to drop out of school and work as a tree pusher to support their mother. He resents her for running out on the family and for having a life of freedom and the thrill of performing.{{MuppetWiki}}
