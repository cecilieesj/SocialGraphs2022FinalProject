He was voiced by Tim Hodge.

==Role in the short film==
Mactavish tells the other workers about the deadline that if they do not continue building the railroad to the other side of the mountain, they could lose their jobs. When John arrives, Mactavish tells him to know when he started building railroads, in which John tells him that he built railroads recently as he helps the railroad industry; Mactavish is later seen working with Polly to build the railroad until he and the other workers notice a steam drill arriving. When Mactavish tells the operator about the contract of the workers and their deadline, the operator grabs it and burns it in the engine. After John finishes his challenge against the steam drill, he and the other workers are seen cheering for John. Later after John Henry collapses and dies, Mactavish, Polly, and the other workers are later seen mourning John's death.

==Trivia==
*Tim Hodge uses a Scottish accent when voicing Mactavish. He stated on his [https://web.archive.org/web/20070223060646/http://www.timothyhodge.com/voiceactor.html official website] that the voice lines used in the final product had a less accurate accent, mainly due to his more authentic takes being unintelligible.
