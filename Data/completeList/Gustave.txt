==Role in [[Doc McStuffins|the series]]==
Gustave first appeared in the episode ''Gulpy, Gulpy Gators!''. [[Doc McStuffins (character)|Doc]] and Donny were playing a game of Gulpy Gators (A game similar to Hungry Hungry Hippos) as Donny added more marbles, stuffing the green gator as Doc takes the game to the clinic, her stethoscope activates all the toys and the gators came to life, as the toy gators started chomping on everything until one gator toy named Gustave explains why is he so full of marbles.

Doc recalls another time Gustave's appetite gets the better of him in the ''[[The Doc Files|Doc Files]]'' short episode ''Gustave Gator's Gulp''. The little gator's groans in pain awaken Sir Kirby who tries to help him as the other toys get annoyed by the noises Gustave is making as Doc discovers that Gustave had swallowed jacks inside him instead of marbles as Gustave is diagnosed with gunk-inside-a-tude as Doc removes the jacks out of Gustave's belly.

Gustave plays another role in the episode ''Don't Fence Me In'', where the marbles from the Gulpy Gators game scatter across Doc's backyard, and while tries to get some of them, he gets his head stuck in the fence.

==Trivia==
*His voice actor, Stephen Stanton, has voiced characters such as Randy Rabbit in The Garfield Show, Jimi Stringer/Nitroblast in Hero Factory, Judge Pobun in Breadwinners, and Bonita in Psychonauts.
