'''Glut''' is a {{WikipediaLink|great white shark}} who is a minor antagonist in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. He is only seen at the beginning, following the introduction of [[Ariel]].

==Appearances==
===''[[The Little Mermaid]]''===
Glut is first seen swimming around the sunken ship, where he finds [[Ariel]] and [[Flounder]] inside. He immediately attacks the duo and begins a chase, but ends up getting his head stuck in the ring of an anchor. When Flounder calls Glut a big bully and blows a raspberry at him, he responds back by his chomping teeth, frightening Flounder, and swims away with Ariel. He is never seen again during the rest of the film.

In an original draft for the movie, Glut managed to survive and escape from his predicament and would fight Ariel and Flounder again while they are chasing the wedding ship to stop [[Prince Eric|Eric]] and "Vanessa"'s wedding. Flounder musters up the strength and courage to trick Glut into getting Ariel close enough to the ship for her to get up onto it and then he manages to bite the barrel she was on (which is later revealed to be a gunpowder keg) as Flounder manages to escape from the results. It is implied that Glut died in the ensuing explosion.

===[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|''The Little Mermaid'' (TV series)]]===
Glut appears in ''The Little Mermaid'' television series occasionally. Several great white sharks that resemble him appear as well.

==Video games==
===''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]''===
Glut is a minor character in ''Kingdom Hearts'' in Atlantica. He mainly appears around the Sunken Ship and attacks Sora and company while they are there. When the friends are searching for Ursula's lair, he attacks in an attempt to eat them. Upon being defeated, he flees. However, he still remains around the Sunken Ship after Ursula's defeat. [[Sora]] is able to battle him because if he goes into the area, he will attack.

In the manga adaptation of the game, when he attacks Goofy, he bites onto his shell, breaking his teeth.

===Other games===
Glut appears as a boss fight for the video game spin-offs ''[[The Little Mermaid (video game)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Ariel: The Little Mermaid]]''

In ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', [[Mizrabel]] uses an illusion of Glut in her army of minions.

Glut also appears as a boss in ''[[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]]''.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
===''[[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]''===
Glut is possibly revived and is now a pet/minion of Ursula. When the park guests must stop her from flooding [[Cinderella Castle]], she summons him to devour her foes. Fortunately, they are able to defeat and chain him up with magic. The dark magic Glut left behind allowed the guests and [[Sebastian]] to track down Ursula.

==Trivia==
*Despite sharks and other fish not having vocal cords and as such not being able to produce any sounds, Glut is clearly heard growling, snarling, and even roaring in his scenes. However, this may have been added for dramatic effect. His growling noises were provided by [[Frank Welker]]. This may also be a possible reference to the infamous roaring shark of ''Jaws: The Revenge''.
**Glut chasing Ariel and Flounder through the ship may also be a reference to a similar scene in the aforementioned film, when the shark ruthlessly chases Michael Brody through a sunken ship and Michael barely escapes.
*His death in the deleted scene may have been a reference to the climax of the original ''Jaws'' film.
*Glut is like [[Undertow]] from the sequel, as they are both villainous sharks. However, Undertow can talk, while Glut does not talk.
