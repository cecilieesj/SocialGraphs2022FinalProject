'''Mother Rabbit''' is an anthropomorphic rabbit character who appears in ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''. She is the widowed mother of [[Sis]], [[Skippy (Robin Hood)|Skippy]], [[Tagalong]], and eleven other children.

It is unknown how or when her husband died, but that can be implied that [[Prince John]] chopped off his head some time ago.

==Background==
===Personality===
She is a kind and loving mother. She appears to be very self-sacrificing, as it is mentioned that she had scrimped and saved to give Skippy a single farthing for his birthday. However, she is not afraid to speak her mind, as when she rebukes the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] for taking it as taxes.

===Outfit===
She is seen to be wearing a lavender shawl, a mauve dress (which touches her bare feet), a lilac apron and glasses.

==Appearances==
===''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]''===
Mother Rabbit is shown to be a widow with a number of children. She first appears at a birthday party she is hosting for her son, Skippy. As she is giving him his birthday present, the Sheriff walks in, much to their horror. When Skippy finds that his present is a single farthing, the Sheriff confiscates it for tax purposes. Mother Rabbit rebukes him as heartless, but it doesn't faze him. As they are talking, a blind beggar walks into the home, and the Sheriff tricks him by taking the money he has before leaving. Mother Rabbit kindly tells him to come in, sit down, and rest himself, and he reveals himself to be [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]. After presenting Skippy with a bow, arrow, and his own hat as a present, he, Sis, Tagalong, and [[Toby Turtle|Toby]] happily run off to play. Robin stays behind to give Mother Rabbit a small sack of money, then disguises himself. As he leaves, Mother Rabbit blesses him.

Later in the film, she is seen at the archery tournament that Prince John holds. She and her children are shocked when Robin is captured and about to be executed, however, he isn't. That night, she is celebrating his victory in [[Sherwood Forest]], even dancing. At some point afterward, she and her children were imprisoned for their inability to pay taxes (and she is feeding one of them in jail in the meantime). Thanks to Robin and [[Little John]], they were able to escape. Mother Rabbit is separated from Tagalong at one point, as they are rushing out of the castle. However, Robin goes to save her, and she is reunited with her mother (as while the gates are suddenly shut Robin gives her to Little John through a small open space). In the end, Mother Rabbit appears in the end at Robin and [[Maid Marian]]'s wedding and doesn't seem to notice that Skippy has snuck off on the carriage in order to watch over Robin's future kids.

===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===
She has a cameo in the scene when [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] passes her as he runs happily through the streets at Christmas.

===''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''===
Mother Rabbit appears as Mrs. Rabbit on the show. She is the [[White Rabbit]]'s wife in this version. Similarly to his original version, she live in a kingdom under the tyrannical reign of an evil monarch, the [[Red Queen]] replacing [[Prince John]].
