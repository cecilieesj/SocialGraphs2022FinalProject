'''Jamie Townsend''' is a ''[[Fillmore!]]'' character. He is an [[X Middle School]] student who is an antagonist.
==Appearance==
Jamie is a Caucasian boy with a brown flattop and square, gray-framed glasses. He wears a green vest, orange buttoned shirt with folded collar, blue jeans, and brown shoes.

==History==
Jamie has his first prominent role in <ref>Red Robins Don't Fly</ref>, when he's among the classmates invited to a party by a girl named Jenna. Later, while he's selling candy at a table in the school's hallway, one of the [[Red Robins]], [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] (who goes undercover as a scout), confronts him about this. Subsequently, he's seen wrapped up in toilet paper. This is done in retaliation for him cutting in on their business-and-sales turf or territory. Finally, when Jamie is seen in class again towards the end of the episode, Jenna tells Ingrid that she hasn't been invited to her party because she's "still too new". A timid Jamie then volunteers and offers to give up his place on the guest list to Ingrid, knowing well of the Red Robins' capabilities from the previous, aforementioned incident.

His other prominent role is in <ref>This Savior, A Snitch</ref>. In this, he started up his own macaroni catering company, as he tells [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]]. When Fillmore confronts Scooter McAllister, who corners Jamie in the kitchen and the former two then end up backstage at the macaroni art ceremony, and the latter pushes the statue of Principal Folsom made of macaroni to him, the former is forced to choose stopping the statue from falling apart, but he fails to do so. After being brought into the principal's office for questioning and being accused of destroying the statue out of spite for macaroni (which he denies), he returns to the Safety Patrol Headquarters. He finds Jamie being interrogated about the incident. Fillmore tells Jamie to back him up on that, but he lacks the courage. Following that, he watches Fillmore on a monitor and he informs someone on a walkie-talkie that the coast is clear. When Fillmore and Ingrid are running through the school's hall, Jamie motions and tells them to come into a room. When they come in, they find Scooter and his thugs with Jamie. It's revealed that Jamie was in on having Augie and Fillmore set up for the destruction of the macaroni statue, he explains why he did it and how it all came into play. Expecting to find Augie there also when stepping out of the shadow, he's surprised to find that it's actually Ingrid instead, dressed in Augie's clothes and Augie makes it to the hearing in Ingrid's clothes, concluding that the plan backfired.
