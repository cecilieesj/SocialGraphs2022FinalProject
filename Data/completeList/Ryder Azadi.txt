'''Ryder Azadi''' (formerly known as '''Prisoner X10''') is a major protagonist in the [[Disney XD]] animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.

==Background==
Ryder hailed from the Outer Rim planet of [[Lothal]], where he served as its governor during the early days of the [[Galactic Empire]]'s rule there. Despite being a member of the Imperial government, Azadi supported underground revolutionary broadcasts that were made by [[Ephraim and Mira Bridger]]. As a result of his actions, Ryder was charged with treason and incarcerated in an Imperial prison, along with the Bridgers. Ryder was given the label "Prisoner X10" while he was imprisoned.

===Personality===
Although Ryder served as an Imperial governor, he supported the revolutionary broadcasts made by Ephraim and Mira Bridger, a decision that led to him being charged with treason and incarcerated in an Imperial prison.

==Trivia==
*He is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]], who previously voiced Savage Opress in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.
*His name in development was Vol Freilus.
*He may have been [[Arihnda Pryce]]'s immediate predecessor.
