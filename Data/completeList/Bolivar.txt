}}'''Bolivar''' is a cumbersome, non-anthropomorphic St. Bernard dog belonging to [[Donald Duck]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Alpine Climbers]]''===
He first appeared in the [[1936]] [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon ''[[Alpine Climbers]]'' where he is a rescue St. Bernard who comes to the aid of Mickey, Donald and Pluto in the Alps. He rescues [[Pluto]] from freezing in the snow, after which the two are found by Mickey and Donald to be drunk on Bolivar's own brandy. Bolivar is unusual for a Disney character in that he is not anthropomorphised beyond showing an unusually broad range of facial expressions; he is actually represented with the characteristics of his species.

==Comic History==
Later on he appeared in the newspaper comic strips by Bob Karp and Al Taliaferro as Donald's pet dog. Ever since 1938, Bolivar has been a prominent member of the Duck family. He was a recurring character in [[Carl Barks]]' comics, as the family' pet dog and companion for [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey Dewey, and Louie]], and appears now and then in recent stories (the Disney artist Daniel Branca had Bolivar as one of his favourite characters).

In some comic strips, Bolivar had a son named Behemoth.

Bolivar has also been called Bornworthy and Bernie, possibly to avoid any political implications (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar Simón Bolívar]). Nevertheless from [[1992]] onward the original name Bolivar has almost always been used in the United States.

==Trivia==
*While Bolivar did not return to animation, a look-alike named Toliver appeared in ''[[More Kittens]]'' ([[December 19]], [[1936]]).
**Also, another St. Bernard puppy named [[Ronnie]] appeared in at least two Pluto featurettes: ''[[The Purloined Pup]]'' ([[1946]]) and ''[[Pueblo Pluto]]'' ([[1949]]).
