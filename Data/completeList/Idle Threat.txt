'''Idle Threat''' is a character in the ''[[Cars Toons]]'' episode ''[[The Radiator Springs 500½]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Idle is painted black, with space frames that are red, and brown eyes. According to director Rob Gibbs, Idle's model is a Class 1 dune buggy.<ref name=EW>[http://family-room.ew.com/2014/03/13/cars-short-radiator-springs-500/ Lightning McQueen revs his engine off-road in Pixar's new Radiator Springs short -- EXCLUSIVE]</ref> His tires, which are large ones, do not have rims, and four headlights are carried on his roof rack. There is a red arch shape that contains a black arch-shaped line in it on his hood. He also has several sponsors such as Mood Springs, Clutch Aid, Nitroade, Lil' Torquey Pistons and Re-Volting, which are all the same ones that sponsor some of the [[Piston Cup]] racers.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars Toons]]''===
Idle Threat makes his debut appearance in ''[[The Radiator Springs 500½]]'', where he travels to [[Radiator Springs]] with [[Sandy Dunes]], [[Shifty Sidewinder]] and [[Blue Grit]], wanting to have a race against [[Lightning McQueen]]. McQueen agrees to this, having seen that the off-road racers are making insults about [[Stanley (Cars)|Stanley]], the town's founder. Before the race starts, [[Mater]] tells them the course, so to make sure they know where to go.

When the race starts, Idle and the others are all battling for first place, and soon come to a fork in the path. Mater had told them to turn left, but he confused them when he said that it is right, not letting them know that he literally meant "correct". Due to the confusion, they all turn right, not knowing that they are going the wrong way. Rather than going along the race track, they all fall down cliffs, drive through a cactus patch, get covered in soot while going through the Tailpipe Caverns, and come across a spooky forest, where they all get freaked out by all of the corpses, and rush back to Radiator Springs, still unaware that they went on a different route.

==Video games==
===''[[Cars: Fast as Lightning]]''===
Idle appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Cars: Fast as Lightning'', being available in downloadable content released in September [[2015]]. Players can use him to race against other characters, and he can be seen strolling around Radiator Springs. Along with Sandy, Blue Grit and Shifty, Idle does not have a race track like the other playable characters. Additionally, players need gems to unlock him.
