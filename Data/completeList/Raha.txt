'''Raha''' is an adult male Zebra that resides in the Backlands. He is the brother of [[Starehe]] and a member of [[Dhahabu]]'s herd.

== Appearance ==
Almost identical to his sister Starehe, Raha is a medium built zebra with a white body covered in black stripes. The tips of his ears are black and his inner ears are pink. He has black eyes and a grey muzzle. A few strands of his mane dangle over his head.

== Personality ==
Raha has been shown to be a very energetic and enthusiastic zebra, carefree to the point of being naive. It takes a lot for him to become upset, but he is open to forgive others. Like his sister, Raha is very loyal to his queen Dhahabu wishing to follow her wherever she goes. And when she's in danger, he will fight any enemy that poses a threat to her showing his protective side.

== Role in the Series ==

=== ''[[The Golden Zebra]]'' ===
Raha made his appearance in the Season 2 episode The Golden Zebra. The Lion Guard meets Rah and his sister Strahee while looking for Dhahabu. After meeting the Lion Guard they sing a song called "[[Fabulous Dhahabu]]" so they can introduce Dhahabu. The guard is in shock when they first meet Dhahabu since she's a golden zebra. Kion then explains about the water shortage in the Pride Lands. He asks if they can share Dhahabu's Watering Hole but Dhahabu gets worried. Kion says that they'll do something for them in return. Dhahabu says that they can bring her herd their favorite food a Tamboa plant. The Lion Guard then plans to find the plant that Dhahabu requested in order to share her water in return. he Lion Guard retrieves the plant for Dhahabu as requested by her to share the water hole, but Dhahabu refuses because one of her rules about the water hole is a secret. Kion then asks Ono to look at the water hole that Dhahabu's herd grazes at in which Ono explains that the reason why Dhahabu refuses to see is that the water hole is dried up. Feeling sad of herself after the zebras are unhappy that the water hole dried up. After getting the water back into the Watering Hole the Pride Landers come to share their water.

=== ''[[The Queen's Visit]]'' ===
Dhahabu's herd comes into the Pride Lands for a visit. While walking towards Pride Rock they sing "[[Prance With Me]]." Simba welcomes Dhahabu's herd into the Pride Lands and says that they will be continuing the celebration at sundown. Dhahabu goes on a tour with Kiara, Tiifu, Zuri and the Lion Guard. She tells her zebra herd to go frolic and romp and enjoy the Pride Lands. Starehe and Raha bump into the guard and tells them that they're looking for Dhahabu. They weren't happy about being away from her. Ono tries to find her but it turns out that she's surrounded by jackals. The two zebras spring into action to save their friend however she doesn't see it. She only sees the Lion Guard and asks for Fuli, Tiifu, and Zuri to be her guards forever. It makes the zebras more upset until the jackals come back again. They attack the jackals and become the new bodyguards for Dhahabu.
