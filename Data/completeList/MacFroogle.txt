==Background==
MacFroogle is described as a greedy developer who builds a massive mini-golf course over Nessie's old pond. He is shown to ignore anyone who demands to get the lake back, such as Nessie protesting to get her lake back.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Ballad of Nessie]]''===
MacFroogle is introduced as a tycoon developer who plans on building his own golf course in Scotland, leaving [[Nessie]] to search for a new home, to no avail. When Nessie finally breaks down in tears over her misfortune, crying for weeks on end, her tears grow into a huge lake known as "Loch Ness". He later appears during the credits, floating on his sign, crying over the destruction of his own golf course, due to Nessieâ€™s tears flooding over his golf course as well.
