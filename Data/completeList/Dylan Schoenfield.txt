A reformed dork, she now has the coolest boyfriend, the most popular friends, and a brand-new it bag that everyone covets. But when she accidentally tosses her Serge Sanchez bag into a fountain, this princess comes face-to-face with her own personal frog, self-professed film geek [[Josh Rosen]].
In return for rescuing Dylan's bag, Josh convinces Dylan to let him film her for his documentary on high school popularity. Reluctantly, Dylan lets F-list Josh into her A-list world, and is shocked to realize that sometimes nerds can be pretty cool.

During the film-making, she is pretty rough on him, but soon they become super close. After being dumped by [[Asher Dumetz]], she starts to like Josh and they kiss and date at Spring Formal.
