'''Candice''' is a character in the ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' video game ''[[Cars: Race-O-Rama]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Candice is easily spoiled, as her father deals with getting her what she wants. If she fails to do something successfully, she would ask her father to get her something new for next time, determined that she would do better next time. She is keen to brag, thinking that a well-known racecar like [[Lightning McQueen]] would not beat her at her hometown of Santa Carburera. Additionally, she is one to care about being glamorous, as she sometimes complains during races that her paintwork has got scratched. In the end, she felt sorry about how she behaved toward McQueen.

===Physical appearance===
Candice has the color pink painted all over her body, and has blue eyes, and chrome rims and door handles. Her model is based on the Porsche 911 Carrera, like [[Sally Carrera]]. On her rear end is a license plate that says "SO HOT".

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars: Race-O-Rama]]''===
Attempting to win the Race-O-Rama series, [[Chick Hicks]] hires Candice, El Machismo and [[Stinger]] to be challengers for Lightning McQueen to race against at their hometowns, as he is planning to become [[Radiator Springs]]' new leader once he wins the trophy. Candice is the first of Chick's apprentices to compete against McQueen, wanting to win at her home track while getting a lot of attention from the paparazzi. Nevertheless, thanks to a recent new customization, McQueen beats Candice in the race. Infuriated, Candice phones her father to ask for new paint, tires and lots of other stuff this instant. Acting in response, her father agrees to get everything sorted, and she happily leaves to do shopping, though she has to make her way through the press.

In the end, McQueen wins the Race-O-Rama series, while Chick plans to come back for revenge. Sometime later, Candice, El Machismo and Stinger come to McQueen to say they are sorry about their ways earlier, having started to think that they like McQueen's way of racing. In return, McQueen gives them permission to visit his racing academy any time they want.
