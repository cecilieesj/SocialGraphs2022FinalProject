'''King Amok''' is a character who appeared in the Disney animated series, ''[[TaleSpin]]''. He is the aged and congenial rabbit monarch of the Kingdom of [[Macadamia]] and red fox lady [[Lotta Lamour|Princess Lotta Lamour]]'s father in the episode "[[The Road to Macadamia]]".

== Appearance ==
He is a tan flemish giant rabbit with long ears, black glasses, and black whiskers on his muzzle, along with a pink tone around his muzzle, hands, feet, and ears. He has two molar teeth sticking out, and has brown eyebrows. He is even cross-eyed. He is dressed as a cross between a king and a court jester.

== Personality ==
He appears at first as not too bright but is a shrewd leader who is manipulated by his scheming Royal Chancellor Trample to consider abdicating his throne by making him believe he is too incompetent to rule the people, and to almost allow Trample to marry Princess Lotta against her wishes in order to restore faith in the monarchy. After the plot fails, Amuck frugally rewards Baloo and Louie with the cargo order of ten sacks of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and an invoice for $192.12 that they came for in the first place, instead of the rich reward they expected.

== Trivia ==

* King Amok's personality is likely the inspiration for the [[The Sultan|Sultan]] in ''[[Aladdin]]''.
