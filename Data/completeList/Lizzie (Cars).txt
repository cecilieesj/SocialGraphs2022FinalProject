'''Lizzie''' is a supporting character in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' franchise. She was the wife of [[Stanley (Cars)|Stanley]], the founder of the town of [[Radiator Springs]].

==Background ==
===Official Description===

:''When Lizzie first rolled into [[Radiator Springs]] in 1927, it was love at first sight - love for the town and love for [[Stanley (Cars)|Stanley]], the town founder. But she kept Stanley on the soft shoulder for months. Until one day, she realized that Stanley's vision for a new oasis in the desert had enraptured her, too. From that day on, the two became the inseparable heart and soul of the town.''

:''Lizzie is a Radiator Springs original. She's a little old lady, but still an active businesswoman who uses her moxie to sell bumper stickers, mud flaps, and other Route 66 memorabilia from her curio shop. She's as feisty as she is brash. Lizzie's unswerving frankness and offbeat comments keep the townsfolk and tourists on their toes, even though she has no idea what she's just said.''

===Personality===
Lizzie is one of the oldest living citizens of Radiator Springs. She is very old and fragile and she has a tendency to forget things very quickly. However, despite her forgetfulness, Lizzie is very witty where she makes sassy comments such as noting how unclean [[Luigi's Casa Della Tires|Luigi's shop]] is and how crazy McQueen is for talking to himself. Despite her sass, Lizzie is very kind-hearted and grandmotherly as she does care for her friends.

When Lizzie was married to Stanley, she was shown to be very much in love as she was a devoted wife. After Stanley passed away, Lizzie continued to miss and mourn for him, wishing he could see how the town he built was brought to life, thanks to McQueen.

===Physical appearance===
Lizzie is a 1923 Ford Model T 2-Door Sedan painted entirely black, with headlights that have a gray tint. She has a spare tire attached to her trunk but with a chrome interior instead of her four black rims.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars]]''===
Lizzie owns the Radiator Springs Curious shop and has been living in Radiator Springs ever since the town got off the map. She is first seen sleeping at her shop when race car [[Lightning McQueen]] drives into Radiator Springs and accidentally destroys the town's road. When he's brought up to court the next day, Lizzie angry glares at him and supports [[Sally Carrera]]'s decision to have Lightning fix the road. As Lightning fixes the road by pulling [[Bessie]], Lizzie asks [[Red (Cars)|Red]] to move aside so she can watch Lightning work by calling him a "hot rod," implying she's developed some sort of a crush on him. When two cars arrive at Radiator Springs, Lizzie puts a bumper sticker on the back of the male car as a "way to remember 'them' by" and looks disappointed when they left.

When Lightning makes the road worse by trying to speed up his progress, Lizzie watches [[Doc Hudson]] challenge Lightning to a race and witnesses McQueen lose the race by falling into a cactus pit after failing to make a turn onto the dirt track. The next day, Lizzie joins the town's residents in driving on part of the new road that Lightning finished. She comments to [[Luigi]] that the new road makes his [[Luigi's Casa Della Tires|shop]] look like a dump, offending Luigi until he realizes that she is right. When Lightning continues to work on the road, Lizzie comments him that people will think he's crazy if he keeps talking to himself which Lightning sarcastically thanks her giving him the tip, causing Lizzie to say that she wasn't talking to him.

At Flo's V8 Café, when Lightning tries to explain to everyone that Doc is really a famous race car, Lizzie bursts into laughter and does not believe him while commenting how red Lightning is getting. Lizzie then watches Lightning leave with Sally to go out for a drive instead of running off.

When Lightning finally finishes fixing the road, Lizzie seems saddened as she believes Lightning left, but becomes overjoyed when she sees that he hasn't left. When Lightning does a shopping around town, Lizzie shows him around her shop and gives him three bumper stickers. After Lightning gets a makeover, he tries to signal Lizzie to turn on the radio and the town's fixed neon lights though she forgets so Red does it for her. Everyone begins to party around and have fun where Lizzie mistakenly cruises with Lightning, thinking he asked her when he asked Sally. Lizzie talks to Lightning about her life, but he manages to get away from and reunite with Sally, thanks to [[Mater]]. Lizzie, noticing how well the town came back to life, is seen talking to the statue of her husband, saying: "Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this.", implying that she still misses him.

When Lightning is suddenly taken away by the press due to being informed by Doc, Lizzie becomes depressed and sadly walks into her shop, turning off her lights. Doc, regretting her decision, tells everyone of his time being a race car and grabs a handful of Radiator Springs' residents to support McQueen at the race in California while Lizzie, Red and Sally stay behind. As Lizzie, Red and Sally watch the race on TV, she forgets that Doc is at the race she yells for Doc to "come have a look at this fellow on the radio" who looks just like him (it was). Lizzie then watches Lightning forgo his chance to win the Piston Cup by helping the injured [[The King (Cars)|King]] cross the finish line, fondly remarking "That's my hot rod."

Lizzie is seen in the end credits where Radiator Springs is back on the map due Lightning setting up his racing headquarters there and enjoys spending time with her friends.

===''[[Cars 2]]''===
Lizzie is a minor character in the second movie. She appears with the other townsfolk greeting Lightning back to Radiator Springs, unaware that he had been gone.

In the end, Lizzie is seen with [[Mack]], listening to Mater to tell his adventures in defeating a criminal organization of cars known as "[[Lemons]]" and witnessed the arrival of British agents [[Finn McMissile]] and [[Holley Shiftwell]]. After hearing Holley keeping a dent and deeming it "valuable," Lizzie remarked she was crazy as Mater while Mack commented that Mater and Holley make a great couple.

===''[[Cars 3]]''===
Lizzie returns in the third movie, first appearing taking a nap on her porch. She says goodbye to Lightning when he leaves to go to the Rust-eze Racing Center, though she thinks he is going to college. She also watches the Florida 500 on television with Red and Sheriff and, during the credits, trains with Lightning, Mater and Cruz at the Racing Center.

==Video games==
===''[[Cars: The Video Game]]''===
In the first chapter of the story, Lightning visits Lizzie at her Curio Shop and finds her looking at her postcards. However, he knocks over a shelf, which starts a chain reaction resulting in a fan blowing the postcards out the door. Lightning goes out to find them, but when he finds them all and returns them, Lizzie has forgotten that they were lost.

She can usually be found driving around Radiator Springs earlier in the story, then in Tailfin Pass later on. However, she does not appear in any races, nor is she a playable character.

===''[[Cars: Radiator Springs Adventures]]''===
Lizzie appears in the Radiator Springs Curios activity in ''Cars: Radiator Springs Adventures''. She is on her front porch watching the paint dry when Lightning comes to look for some things to decorate his racing headquarters. She agrees to help, but due to her tendency to forget how she organizes everything, Lightning has to help her put everything back. Lizzie also appears in a Legends Race.

===''[[Cars: Mater-National Championship]]''===
In ''Cars: Mater-National Championship'', as Lightning competes in the various races and events, Lizzie rewards him with stickers in which there are seven in total. Once Lightning has completed all of the events, he takes them off and puts them on a sign in front of his Racing HQ. Once again, she does not appear in any races or as a playable character, but she also does not appear driving around Radiator Springs.

===''[[The World of Cars Online]]''===
Lizzie can be found parked outside of her shop in ''The World of Cars Online''.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Lizzie's Curio Shop appears in [[Cars Land]] as a store where guests can purchase various ''Cars''-themed merchandise. Lizzie herself appears in [[Radiator Springs Racers]], once again taking a nap in front of her store when the guests arrive in Radiator Springs.

==Trivia==

*Lizzie appears in ''[[Cars Mater-National]]'' giving stickers to Lightning after completing certain tasks.
*Lizzie is a 1923 Ford Model T 2-door sedan.
*Her name comes from the fact that the Ford Model T's nickname was the "Tin Lizzie."
*Lizzie is the oldest car to appear in the movies; Stanley is older, but is only shown as a statue.
* Lizzie was married to Stanley as seen from Mater's Tall Tales: [[Time Travel Mater]].
* She's the widow of Stanley, who worked as a radiator cap salesman and the town's patriarch.
*It is unknown how old Lizzie actually is, but given Radiator Springs was founded in the 1910's and she was around by 1927, it is believed she is late mid-late 90's - or possibly 100 - by Cars 3.
