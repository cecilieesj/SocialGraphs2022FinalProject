The '''Baby Parasaurolophus''' is a minor character from Disney's [[2000]] CGI film ''[[Dinosaur]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Dinosaur]]''===
In the [[Nesting Grounds]], the baby Parasaurolophus sees a dinosaur's nest and sniffs one of the eggs (presumably [[Aladar]]'s egg), but [[Aladar's Mother]] shoos it of. It then runs to the other nests, but also gets shooed off by the dinosaur mothers guarding them. The Parasaurolophus later runs through the river through a flock of [[Ichthyornis]], and it visually perceives a [[wikipedia:Longisquama|Longisquama]]. It then chases the flying lizard and runs into the forest. The Parasaurolophus comes in close proximity to the Longisquama, but it flies up to what appeared to be a tree. The Parasaurolophus then sees a couple drops of saliva landing on a tree branch and notices what and where the Longisquama landed on: the nose of a vicious and bloodthirsty [[Carnotaurus]] that has been aroused. The Parasaurolophus then runs out of the forest in terror and gets chased by the Carnotaur, which it tries to evade. Luckily for the young dinosaur, the Carnotaur ran past it to catch a bigger meal. It is unknown what happened to the Parasaurolophus after that, as it is not seen again for the rest of the film.
