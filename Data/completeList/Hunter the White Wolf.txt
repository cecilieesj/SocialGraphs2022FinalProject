===="[[The Panther and the Wolf]]"====
The [[T'Chaka|King]] and [[Ramonda|Queen]] of [[Wakanda]] take in Hunter, and he grows up, living as the adopted brother of [[Black Panther|T'Challa]] and [[Shuri]]. Hunter eventually takes his mother's pendant and leaves the royal family. While Shuri still regards him as her brother, this causes a rift between Hunter and T'Challa, who accuses him of being a thief.

One night, while observing [[Wakanda]] from a distance, Hunter is ambushed by Black Panther who charges him of betraying the royal family. Annoyed by the accusation, Hunter dismisses T'Challa, attempting to leave, and a chase pursues between the two brothers. Hunter is bested by T'Challa, who demands information on the Shadow Council, an organisation who want to take down T'Challa as king, who approached him. Hunter offers to give a list of every Shadow Council operative within Wakanda, but escapes before he can deliver. Their chase eventually leads to a room occupied by [[M'Baku]] and his men. Hunter escaped before they can capture him, and he eventually finds his way back to T'Challa. The pair squabble with each other, until joined by Shuri who bring them to sense. Hunter informs his siblings that he gained the trust of [[Erik Killmonger|N'Jadaka]], before stealing his list and betraying him and learning that moles and traitors are embedded in every level of Wakandan society. Shuri urges T'Challa to allow Hunter to help them, and they head to T'Chanda's estate. While there, the three reminisce of their childhoods and the fun times they spent together. Before they can get the list, M'Baku arrives, having followed them, and a battle between the four takes place. They eventually best him, by working together, and Hunter gives T'Challa the list. Before Hunter leaves, T'Challa reminds him that the palace is his home.
