'''Pedro''' is a young mail plane, a character and the protagonist from the [[Pedro|animated short of the same name]], segment of the [[1943]] package film ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''.

==Background==
Pedro is a small airplane who lives with his mother and father in Chile. In spite of his duty in doing the mail route and studying aviation, his parents warn him to be careful of various obstacles along the way such as going past [[Aconcagua]], the mountain feared by all planes, and of course, bad weather. When Pedro finally reunites back to his parents at the end of the segment, his parents become proud of Pedro of finishing the task, causing Pedro to become satisfied of himself.

==Appearances==
===''[[Saludos Amigos]]''===
Pedro is the main protagonist of the segment with the same name who wishes to be like his father, [[Papa Plane]], who carries the mail between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. He goes to school to study aviation, including geography about the mail route between Santiago and Mendoza just like what Papa Plane did. Since his parents can't do the mail route, he takes off to Mendoza where his first task was to pick up the mail there. He then arrives at the Upsallata Pass where he flies perfectly until he sees [[Aconcagua]], the highest mountain that he must avoid in his path.

Going past Aconcagua, Pedro suddenly arrives in Mendoza where he picks up the mail. He suddenly feels overjoyed that his parents would be proud of him for completing the task. He follows a nearby condor back to Aconcagua as he forgot his responsibilities of what his parents told him like avoiding downdrafts and Aconcagua. Pedro then encounters him again and is suddenly afraid of him and the storms. He is then caught between a heavy rainstorm, losing vision on his way back to the airport, making it more challenging for him to return to there. He suddenly runs out of gas and is lost in the heavy storm. After his parents believe he is gone, he is revealed to have survived the storm and arrives back to the airport, carrying the mail safely only to find out that it is actually a postcard, making his parents proud and completing the task as he feels satisfied with himself for finishing it.

===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===
Pedro is the red cartoon plane flying to [[Toontown]] with [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] during the final scene.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Pedro makes several cameo appearances as a guest in ''House of Mouse''. In ''[[Mickey and Minnie's Big Vacation]]'', he was seen getting [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] on stage. In ''[[Donald Wants to Fly]]'', he was seen again entering the House of Mouse and sees [[Donald Duck|Donald]] flying above him.

==Trivia==
*When Chilean comic artist Pepo saw Pedro for the first time, he didn't feel that he represented the Chilean culture, which inspired him to create his most famous Latin American comic book series, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorito Condorito].
