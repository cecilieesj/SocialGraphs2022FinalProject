== History ==
In "Sweet Home Hannah Montana", Siena and Jackson start out as being friends, but throughout the season, Siena shows to have true feelings for Jackson and cares for him for who he is. In "Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office," she shows to have an immediate interest in Jackson and asks him out, even admitting to him that boys have always asked her out before, but that was the first time she herself had to ask. In "California Screamin'," Jackson admits to Siena that even though he wants to be more than just friends with her, he still feels insecure because he is not like the other guys she dates. Siena admits to Jackson that he is right, because he is "way better," and they share their first kiss. In "De-De-De-Do, Da-Don't-Don't-Don't Tell My Secret," while visiting Jackson, she mistakenly thinks Jackson is cheating on her with Hannah Montana after seeing Miley outside in her Hannah disguise through the kitchen window. In the end, to save their relationship, Miley shows Siena her closet. This results in Siena finding out that Miley is really Hannah. She later visits Jackson at his new job as a video game tester and comments on his and Miley's relationship.
