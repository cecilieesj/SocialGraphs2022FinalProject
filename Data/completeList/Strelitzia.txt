'''Strelitzia''' is a [[Keyblade]] wielder who appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Union χ]]''. She is a member of the Dandelions and the younger sister of Lauriam, the somebody of Marluxia.

After the First Keyblade War, Strelitzia was chosen to lead a Union and she was given a book with laws set by Master Ava, However, Strelitzia was struck down and had her book stolen by Darkness, who was possessing [[Ventus]]. While Ventus took her place as Union Leader, Strelitzia mysteriously disappeared and was assumed dead. Lauriam also became a leader and searched for his sister with no avail. 

Eventually, Strelitzia is revealed to be alive, having actually been transported to the world Quadratum.

==Background==
===Personality===
Strelitzia is a quiet and shy girl, and seems to have a high opinion of the Player, regarding them as a friend and is really kind and caring.

===Physical appearance===
Strelitzia has long blonde hair that framed her face, the bangs falling to her forehead beyond her eyebrows, while the rest of her hair is tied by two ribbons. She also has fair skin and green eyes, and wears a white dress with black straps that falls to her shoulders, with a tied ribbon in front. In addition, Strelitzia has matching sleeves and boots.

===Powers and abilities===
Strelitzia wields the third upgrade of the Starlight Keyblade and more superior in magic compared to brother.

==History==
===''Before Kingdom Hearts Union χ''===
After missions on occasion Strelitzia would meet with her brother Lauriam in a field of flowers where she would talk to him about being union leaders and for advice on how to approach Player.

===''Kingdom Hearts Union χ''===
Having been a Keyblade wielder for the past two years, Strelitzia had been fighting a long time and seen many friends come and go. Even so, there is one person, Player, who she would consider to be a friend who has remained. Strelitzia saw Player as they sat and waited for [[List of Kingdom Hearts characters|Ephemer]], holding their Chirithy and crying when Ephemer did not show.

Strelitzia saw Player from time to time after that and began to follow them instinctively. Though she could never muster the courage to engage with Player, she could sense that there was something special about Player—as they saw things differently than everyone else. Although Player did not know her, Strelitzia came to see them as a friend, and looked forward to the day the two of them could talk to one another.

Later, Strelitzia was inducted into the Dandelions and was trained by Ava to prepare for the world outside. One day, Ava approached Strelitzia personally, explaining to her how the world would soon come to an end, asking that Strelitzia become one of five Dandelions to succeed the Foretellers as Union Leaders following the events of the Keyblade War; providing her a collection of laws by which the Union Leaders would be required to follow.

Strelitzia soon came to have her doubts about becoming a Union Leader because she didn't feel right about leaving those who were not Dandelions to take part in the Keyblade War. Realizing that Player is not one of the Dandelions, Strelitzia resolves that she has to tell him the truth about the fate of the world. The next day, Strelitzia and her Chirithy learn that Player was last seen by an abandoned house and go to investigate - though Player is nowhere to be found. Suddenly, someone comes out from the shadows and attacks both Strelitzia and her Chirithy, stealing Strelitzia's book of laws given to her by Ava. In her last moments, Strelitzia recalls how she really wanted to speak with Player, carrying her Chirithy in her arms as she fades and her heart is released.

Then Lauriam dreams about her in their usual flower field but this time sees her in a white coat but before she could say anything she flew up into the sky. Sometime later Elrena's Chirithy alerts the Union Leaders that it saw someone of Strelitzia's likeness with Luxu in the square inspiring Lauriam to believe that she is still alive.

===''Kingdom Hearts IV''===
Strelitzia exists in Quadratum under unknown circumstances, and meets [[Sora]] in an apartment to explain that she found him and he has been sleeping for seven days, and explains that for both of them, Quadratum was something of an 'Afterworld'.
