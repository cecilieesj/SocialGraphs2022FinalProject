The '''Super-Adaptoid''' is a robot with the powers of the [[Avengers]], and is one of the Avengers' enemies.

The Super-Adaptoid was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and Gene Colan.

==Powers and Abilities==
'''Mimicry''': The Adaptoid can copy the powers, appearance, and equipment of any superpowered being in close proximity to it. It then becomes a duplicate of that being, visually indistinguishable from it. Given the opportunity, it can copy up to eight different beings at one time, combining their attributes in a seemingly random fashion, but all these attributes turn green. The main picture, for instance, shows the Adaptoid with Captain America's shield, Thor's chest medallions, and Iron Man's ribbed armor.

==''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''==
In tie-in comic books, the Super-Adaptoid appears. When [[Captain America]] and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] go to stop [[A.I.M.]] from stealing a Stark warehouse, the A.I.M. agents send the Adaptoid after them. At first, the Adaptoid looks like a featureless gray robot until he copies [[Mjolnir]] and takes a green color. When [[Hawkeye]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] arrive, the Adaptoid also copies their powers and features. The Super-Adaptoid defeats most of the Avengers save for Captain America and Thor, but Captain America finds the Super-Adaptoid's weak spot on his chest, so he has Thor call the Adaptoid's attention with lightning while Cap reaches and hits the Super-Adaptoid's weak spot.

==''[[Avengers Assemble]]''==
In this series, the Super-Adaptoid is created by [[Justin Hammer]].  He first was destroyed by the Avengers team easly, but was able to adapt and gain each of there powers.  Super-Adaptoid later served as a battle suit for [[M.O.D.O.K.]] as part of the [[Red Skull]]'s league of villains, and later a proxy form for [[Ultron]]'s corruption towards other machines.
