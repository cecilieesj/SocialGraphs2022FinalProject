The '''giant squid''' is a minor antagonist in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]Â animated film, ''[[Finding Dory]]''. It is an enormous squid that [[Dory]], [[Marlin]], and [[Nemo]] encounter on their way to find [[Charlie (Finding Nemo)|Charlie]] and [[Jenny (Finding Nemo)|Jenny]].

==Role in the film==
After accidentally landing from the California Current into the wreckage of a sunken container ship, crabs keep shushing [[Dory]], [[Marlin]], and [[Nemo]] as they swim along. Dory finally sees the squid's eye and its fearsome beak inside the shadows of a sunken shipping crate. As Marlin begs for the squid to let them go, it chases Dory, Marlin, and Nemo around the wreckage. The squid grabs and nearly eats Nemo, but he, Marlin and Dory escape from being eaten by the giant sea predator when it becomes stuck in a sunken shipping crate during its pursuit of the trio; thus the squid is crushed when the crate falls on top of it.

The giant squid is later seen in the end credits, though only its eye is shown from inside the crate. However, this may only be for the credits, and thus the squid's fate is unknown. In that scene, Hank hides inside the crate the giant squid is hiding at as Hank escapes from it.

==Trivia==
*The giant squid in ''Finding Dory'' is bioluminescent. In truth, it is unknown if giant squid are even able to create bioluminescence as they do not have photophores (the light-producing organs many bioluminescent creatures have). They do, however, have the ability to change color using chromatophores, as all squid and octopuses do.
**The giant squid in Finding Dory is also a mixture of blacks and blues, likely to make it appear more alien and menacing. In reality, giant squids, while able to change color like octopuses, are actually brick red (the red color helps hide them in dark water as it makes them harder to see) and can turn white. They also shine a bright gold or silver color when light hits them, as evidenced by Tsunemi Kubodera when he filmed one in 2013.
*In reality, giant squid prey on deep-sea fish and other types of squid (including other giant squid), not reef fish like in the film.
*Due to its tentacles having hooks on its tentacles in addition to suckers, it could likely be a [[wikipedia:Colossal squid|colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'').  
*If you look closely in the second shot after the squid is crushed, its tentacle (which is potruding from under the fallen crate) is moving, clearly showing that it is indeed still alive.
*The squid's beak in the film is actually upside down; in reality, the giant squid's beak has an underbite rather than an overbite. This is also true of the giant squid in ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.
*According to the app game ''[[Finding Dory: Just Keep Swimming|Just Keep Swimming]]'', the squid's name is Gary.
