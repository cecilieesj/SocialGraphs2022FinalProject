'''Finder''', also known as '''Experiment 158''', is an illegal [[Experiments|genetic experiment]] created by [[Jumba Jookiba]] and a character in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]]. He is designed to sniff out and uncover any lost or missing person or item; he can also fly by spinning his ears like helicopter blades to ensure optimal tracking potential. Upon success, he honks like a party blower. His one true place is operating a "Lost and Found" service at [[Lahui Beach|the beach]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Finder is a very beneficial and resourceful tracker who has a knack for uncovering any missing person or thing. Unlike most experiments, Finder does not cause chaos or mischief with his powers. However, he is a bit competitive as shown when he and [[Stitch]] argued over which direction to go while tracking down an escaped [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]], and gave a huge grin when [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] favored his advice over Stitch's. Aside from this, Finder appears to be very calm and collected when finding lost individuals or items.

===Physical appearance===
Finder is a red aardvark/numbat/shrew-like experiment with little arms and legs, a small, stumpy tail, a long snout, a little mouth, black eyes, and large rabbit-like ears.

===Powers and abilities===
Finder can quickly track down any missing person or thing by using his elongated snout and sense of smell. He can also spin his ears like helicopter blades, allowing him to fly to the detected missing object or individual. Upon success, he honks like a party blower. He also seems to have some sort of knowledge of written languages, regarding his crossing out "Lost" on the "Lost and Found" sign.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 158 was the 158th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel's]] funding. He was designed to track down and detect any missing person or item. 158 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch |Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 158 was activated.

[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] encountered 158 at an unspecified location in Kauai, where the former eventually took him [[Lilo's House|home]] and named him Finder.

Finder demonstrated his amazing powers by finding [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s missing keys in the fridge, which made Stitch envious. The latter then attempted to outdo Finder by shredding the sofa cushion and uncovering a few buried items. However, Lilo concluded that Finder was better at finding stuff than Stitch.

Later, Lilo used Finder for show-and-tell at [[Kaiāulu Hale|hula school]], where he quickly found all of [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|the hula girls]]' lost belongings, much to [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]]'s jealousy.

The [[Grand Councilwoman]] later contacted [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] to report that [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] had escaped from [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]] and traveled to Earth. Lilo selected Finder for tracking down the fugitive, but a competitive Stitch set out to upstage Finder by beating him to the punch. When both cousins debated over which trail led to Hämsterviel after searching through a jungle, Lilo went with Finder, despite Stitch's protests.

Finder deftly tracked Hämsterviel to [[Mertle's House|Mertle's house]], but Lilo began to doubt Finder's accuracy. Earlier, however, Mertle had found Hämsterviel outside a pet shop, mistook him for a talking gerbil, brought him home, and placed him in a cage for show-and-tell. When Mertle tried to cover up for Hämsterviel (after Lilo dropped by to question his presence), Lilo was convinced that Finder had made an error.

After discovering that Finder did uncover Hämsterviel's whereabouts, Stitch burst into Mertle's bedroom that night and attempted to ambush the caged fugitive, but the latter blasted Stitch with a makeshift plasma cannon, knocking him unconscious. The ruckus alerted [[Mrs. Edmonds]], who quickly noticed Stitch and took him to the [[Aloha Animal Rescue|dog shelter]].

The next day, Lilo and Finder arrived at the pound to retrieve Stitch, who revealed to them that Finder had indeed tracked down Hämsterviel. Beforehand, Stitch admitted that he was jealous of Finder and wanted to prove himself to Lilo.

Lilo, Stitch, and Finder returned to the Edmonds' home to discover that [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] (having joined the hunt for Hämsterviel when the Grand Councilwoman offered to reinstate him as captain if he succeeded) had fled with Hämsterviel in [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], but also kidnapped Mertle. Thus, Stitch decided to team up with Finder to rescue her. Using his helicopter-like flying ability, Finder tracked down Gantu's ship while carrying Stitch, who then disabled the spacecraft, thereby saving Mertle.

Hämsterviel was arrested, but due to Gantu's blunder, the Grand Councilwoman did not reinstate him to his former position. However, when Mertle felt heartbroken over losing her new "pet" whom she named Milton, Lilo requested the Grand Councilwoman to let Hämsterviel stay on Earth until after show-and-tell at school, albeit in shackles.

Shortly after, Finder found his one true place operating a [[Lahui Beach|beach]] "Lost and Found" service, drolly crossing out "Lost" on the sign with a red marker.

In "[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]", Finder's picture was seen in [[Lilo's Experiment Book|Lilo's experiment logbook]].

In "[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]", Finder was one of the wanted fugitives who had already been captured in an alternate future where Hämsterviel ruled Earth.

In "[[Ploot (episode)|Ploot]]", Finder was one of the second team of experiments (along with [[Babyfier]] and [[Drowsy]]) formed to try and stop [[Ploot]]. However, Ploot was easily able to defeat them, forcing the three experiments to retreat.

In "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", Finder was one of the experiments that joined Lilo and Stitch on a mission to rescue Gantu's captive experiments. Finder helped break into the ship, and after the rescue team successfully freed the captive experiments, he was seen playing with them in Lilo's obstacle course.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Finder, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Finder participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Finder is Experiment 158; his correct number was shown on the Experiment Tracker mini-poster included with DVD and VHS copies of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' and in the experiments list seen in the end credits of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''. However, in [[Finder (episode)|his debut]], he is erroneously called 458, most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]], but in "[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]", he is correctly referred to as 158.
**If Finder maintained the number he was originally referred to as canon, he would have been the only 4-series experiment to have been featured in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''.
*Finder was activated off-screen.
*Finder's left ear is inconsistent in his appearances. While he is portrayed as having a notch on the outer rim of his upper right ear (similar to Stitch), his left ear is drawn either with or without a notch around the same relative spot between scenes.
*Finder is the only experiment to have appeared in ''[[Stitch Jam]]'', but not in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime itself.
*Finder's ears appear in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab]]''.
