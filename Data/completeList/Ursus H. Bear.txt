'''Ursus H. Bear''' is a character who was featured in the [[Country Bear Jamboree]] attraction at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
Ursus H. Bear was the founder of Grizzly Hall. He lived during the years from [[Pre-1922|1848]] to [[1928]] and founded Grizzly Hall throughout his lifetime after a restful hibernation and rounded up a group of musicians to entertain guests throughout the show<ref>[https://youtu.be/iGy14dVj4Mg Country Bear Jamboree Audio Guide by Lou Mongello (info heard from 4:25 to 4:42)]</ref>. However, years later, the main stage of Grizzly Hall features a plaque decorated in a Victorian style portrait, dedicated to Ursus' legacy decorated with two golden angels (represented as bears to match the attraction's theme) on it.

==Appearances==
===[[Country Bear Jamboree]]===
The Country Bear Jamboree attraction first opened in [[1971]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Frontierland (Magic Kingdom)|Frontierland]] where a plaque dedicated to Ursus' legacy was displayed on the main stage throughout the show. Due to the success of the attraction at Florida, the Country Bear Jamboree attraction was later constructed at [[Disneyland]] at [[Critter Country|Bear Country]] (now [[Critter Country]] as of 1992) and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] at [[Westernland]], still featuring the main stage with the plaque dedicating to Ursus H. Bear.

===Ursus H. Bear's Wilderness Outpost===
Ursus' name has become the subject for use in the former Ursus H. Bear's Wilderness Outpost Shop in [[Critter Country|Bear Country]] located at [[Disneyland]] to which not only the Country Bear Playhouse attraction dedicates Ursus' legacy but also the Wilderness Outpost which has Ursus' name on it to pay tribute to the founder of Grizzly Hall. The shop opened at [[1972]] at Disneyland and later became Crocodile Mercantile in [[1988]], which later closed in [[1995]] to become [[Pooh Corner]].

==Trivia==
*Ursus' first name is Latin for "bear", which quite fits his name.
*Ursus H. Bear is one of the two bears that were not featured as performers in the [[Country Bear Jamboree]] attraction. The other one is Rufus, another bear whose voice is only heard during the [[Country Bear Vacation Hoedown|summer]] and [[Country Bear Christmas Special|Christmas overlays]] where only his loud footsteps and heavy breathing are heard when he climbs the stairs to fix something that has gone wrong throughout the overlays.
*Ursus' plaque has been sporadically featured in the attraction poster for the original Country Bear Jamboree overlay featured in Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, and Tokyo Disneyland.
