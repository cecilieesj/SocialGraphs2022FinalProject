'''Pharaoh Boy''' is a villain from ''[[PJ Masks]]''. He appeared from the portal discovered from the museum. He makes his debut in [[Pharaoh Boy (episode)|Pharaoh Boy]].

==Official Website Description==
The original boy king, who has found a portal into our world - in the museum. Pharaoh Boy is a total megalomaniac - like Romeo but with strange ancient Egyptian powers and a conviction that he was born to rule. He wants to take over the city and rule for all time - thatâ€™s his one wish, and he pursues it determinedly. This is a boy king to be reckoned with.  <ref>https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pj-masks-season-four-springs-into-action-this-may-with-special-extended-episode-heroes-of-the-sky-301048467.html</ref>

===Motives & Abilities===  
Pharaoh Boy's motives include taking control of others to do what he says and ruling the world.

*'''Staff of Ra''': Pharaoh Boy owns this staff which grants him various magical abilities, like turning people into his loyal servants or possessing other creatures. He can also combine his staff with the [[PJ Masks (team)|PJ Masks]] powered projectiles. Since the staff is the source of all his powers, losing the staff renders Pharaoh Boy powerless.
*'''Music Skills''': Pharaoh Boy has excellent music skills. He was able to use his Saxophone to take control of the [[Fly Bots]] and to control his magic Boomerangs using his impressive musical tune.
