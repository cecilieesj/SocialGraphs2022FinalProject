'''Rhonda Kazembe''' is a major supporting character in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. She is one of Nicholas Benedict's top agents and very helpful ally to the children.

==Background==

===Personality===
Rhonda has a lighter sense of humor compared to her associates. She can be pretty perky, but is just as serious about her mission as everyone else. She displays a certain fondness for the children and is very supportive of them. She apparently is a good judge of character as she accurately figured that Reynie, Sticky, Kate and Constance would offer a wild solution to her lost pencil test.

===Physical appearance===
Rhonda is a woman of Zambian descent and has a habit of changing her hairstyle to suit the situation; her strangest of all being making her hair green to pose as a student. She also wears bright colorful clothes to accompany her ever changing style.

==Trivia==
*In the original book series, Rhonda Kazmbe was described as being "above 17", implying that she is rather young. She is also the adopted daughter of Mr. Benedict.
