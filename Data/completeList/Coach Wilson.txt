== Biography ==
Coach Wilson is the coach of the Warriors at Eden Hall, who led his team to 10 state championship victories. He is first shown on the stage sitting next to Rick Riley's father. Later, he is shown a bit later coaching his team in the ice rink and steering then away from the ducks to prevent a brawl between the teams on their first day. 

He is shown later in the final game encouraging his team to show the Ducks why they don't belong in the school. His villainous side is shown when he encourages the Warriors to badly beat up the Mighty Ducks, by just saying "That's Hockey" and shrugging when [[Ted Orion|Coach Orion]] complained about his tactics.

When the Ducks win, he shakes Orion's hand after the game showing redemption and stating that they will get the Ducks next time.
