'''Joyless "Joy" Jenkins''' is a character featured in the [[2019]] [[Blue Sky Studios]] film ''[[Spies in Disguise]]''. As the director of H.T.U.V. and [[Lance Sterling]]'s superior, Joy seems to be firm and strict, plus she has every confidence in him.

==Role in the film==
Joy is first seen watching [[Lance Sterling]] send in a few drones spying on [[Katsu Kimura]] tasking Lance to find the briefcase with the [[M9 Assassins|M9 Assassin]] inside where she describes it as an indestructible robot which never stops chasing its enemy just as she warns him that a group of Yakuza agents is approaching, explaining to him that he shouldn't cause another failure like he did in Kyrgyzstan to which she asks Lance to wait for backup to help him on his assignment to which Lance instead decides to deal against Kimura's henchmen himself.

Arriving at H.T.U.V, Lance arrives at the conference room and shows the briefcase he retrieved from Kimura to Joy only to find out that it is empty to which according to Marcy Kappel, agent of Internal Affairs, tells her about the accusations of Lance stealing the M9 Assassin, followed by her fellow backup agents Eyes and Ears entering the room. As Marcy tells her guards to take Lance to custody, Joy defends him explaining that she trusts him just as Marcy explains the only thing to be trusted is facts.

Seeing footage of [[Killian]] (wearing Lance's face) stealing the M9 Assassin provided by Eyes, Joy explains to him that this can't be true, despite the fact that the real Lance has no robotic claw, causing Lance to panic and escape.

Later while at Venice, [[Marcy Kappel]] talks to Jenkins via hologram, explaining to her that she lost the database, telling her to put everyone to safety to which Marcy argues with Eyes and Ears about Killian disguised as Lance to which Jenkins explains to the three that it would be safe to say that Marcy's investigation is never going anywhere just as Marcy finds a blue pigeon feather.

Back at the atrium at H.T.U.V., Joy then looks at Geraldine who somberly looks at her, believing that they lost [[Walter Beckett]] and Lance during their assignment. Later, a fellow technician tells Joy that according to the satellite feed on the computer, he notices dozens of M9 Assassin drones approaching and attacking the agency as Joy tells Geraldine to put the agency in lockdown due to the ambush. Joy is then given a club by one of the guards to help fight against the M9 Assassin models. The M9 Assassin drones suddenly burst in as Joy strikes one, but they are soon deactivated due to Walter gaining access to Killian's system and disabling the drones just as the agency celebrates.

Joy later talks to Walter and Lance on a computer screen on the SUV where she apologizes to Lance for accusing him of being a villain, accepting Lance to help the agency for their future with Walter joining in.
