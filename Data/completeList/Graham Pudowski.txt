'''Graham Pudowski''' is a supporting character in the [[2021]] [[20th Century Studios]] and [[Locksmith Animation]] animated feature film, ''[[Ron's Gone Wrong]]''. He is the diligent and loyal father of [[Barney Pudowski]], and the son of [[Donka Pudowski]]. He was claimed to used to have a wife, but then she passed away before the events of the film.

His voice actor recently voice acted as Mr. Krupp/Captain Underpants in DreamWorks' 2017 animated film ''Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie.''

==Background==

Barney’s devoted, goofy, and charismatic dad, Graham Pudowski, (voiced by ''Hangover'' colleague star [[Ed Helms]]) is a nerdy gag-gift salesman who does his best to provide a comfortable life for his [[Barney Pudowski|son]]. And although he sells his novelty wares and gift items the world over, he can’t seem to save up enough money to buy a B*Bot for his son. But he keeps trying, working long hours to give his family what they want and fill in the gaps of his quests—trouble is, though, those long hours might be loaded with good intentions, but they also might be pushing father and son further apart.

==Appearance==
Graham is a tall, confident man with fair skin; who wears full frame black circled glasses, a grey attire with a dark beige colored tie wrapped around his white shirt choker, and sports grey pants and black shoes. He has brown hair that stands up, a slender face, big ears, a large nose, a hard-to-see partially shaved beard, brown eyebrows, and orange colored eyes.

== Role in the film==
He is seen quite often throughout the film. He works hard to afford nice, proper, and new things for Barney and puts thought into Barney's birthday present, remembering his [[Barney Pudowski|son]]'s interests and buying a rock collecting kit to help him in his hobbies. Best of all, Graham tries desperately to get a B-Bot, knowing how much Barney wants one, and does his best to obtain Ron.

Graham is a kind man as well as a funny one, often seen trying to sell his ridiculous gadgets, like a toy unicorn that poops out slime. He supports Barney and Donka as best he can, and although some younger members of the audience might not understand how much he loves his family, the adults in the audience will certainly be able to relate to Graham's struggle to make his family happy.

==Trivia==

*Graham's name is derived from the slang term "grand home", and also means "gravel," or "grey home" from the Old English ''grasgham''. Most of the original bearers of this surname came from the city of Grantham.
*His head shape looks rather similar to [[Oscar Proud]]'s head shape from the 2001 Disney show ''[[The Proud Family]].''
