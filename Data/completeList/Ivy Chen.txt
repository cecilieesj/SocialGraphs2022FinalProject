'''Ivy Chen''' is a main character on theÂ [[Disney Channel]] show ''[[Raven's Home]].'' She is a teen resident of San Francisco and Victor's backyard neighbor. She is also Alice's babysitter and Booker's classmate at [[Bayside High School]]. She is portrayed by Emmy Liu-Wang.

==Personality==
Ivy is enterprising, thus capable of handling any situation. She takes no nonsense, and when accused of being wrong at anything, Ivy will do everything in her power to be ultimately proven right. She has a sarcastic wit, but in a gentle fashion. She believes doing things for others as how to show one cares. She has a taste for the horror genre, and is obsessed with the authentic history of the infamous prison on Alcatraz Island.

== Trivia ==
*Originally, the role was meant for a single character named "Jamilla," (for the character's original sides, click [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51c301b6e4b0b7d8b4b378eb/t/60c3ed5f4514102cb0d16145/162345302493 here]) as Booker's love interest and neighbor. Her mother "Nancy" would have also been a main character. However the producers decided to split the attributes of the part, creating "Ivy" as the friend and neighbor, and "Cami" for the love interest when they decided Alana and Raven should not be neighbors.
*From Victor and Alice, Ivy knew all about Raven and her twins, [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Nia]] and Booker.
*Her surname Chen was revealed in "[[The Grand Booker-Pest Hotel]]."
