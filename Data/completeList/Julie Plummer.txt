== Role in the film ==
Julie is the recently widow of Professor Howard Plummer, who was working on a top secret government project called GHOST. She travels overseas with [[Captain Bill Fawcett]] to retrieve his safe deposit box while [[Shane Wolfe]] looks over her children.

Unfortunately, Julie can't retrieve the box unless she figures out the password Howard used and she and Bill end up staying longer than expected. After several weeks, she finally figures it out (my angel), retrieves a key from a box, and is on her way home. Meanwhile, Shane calls Bill and says that he found the GHOST in a secret vault underneath the garage.

When Julie and Bill arrive home, Shane and the latter go to the garage, where the former says he is rethinking his career. Two ninjas arrive armed and pull off their masks, revealing themselves as the Plummers' North Korean neighbors, [[Mr. & Mrs. Chun]]. Bill suddenly knocks Shane out, revealing himself to be a double agent. Mr. Chun restrains and guards the children while Bill and Mrs. Chun take Julie down to the vault. They open the door but a dangerous security system prevents them from going further. Shane is awaken by the children who escape and heads down to the vault.

Bill threatens to kill Julie if she doesn't open the vault. Shane interrupts saying that she doesn't know how to activate it. Bill then forces him to open it. After he subdues Bill, Mrs. Chun prepares to attack him from behind, but Julie knocks her out with one punch. She and Shane then discover a tiny chip--the GHOST project itself.

With Bill and the Chuns arrested, Shane, Julie, and the children watch [[Seth Plummer|Seth]]'s performance of ''The Sound of Music'' as the film ends.
