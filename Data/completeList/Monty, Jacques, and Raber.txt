'''Monty, Jacques, and Raber''' are a trio of vicious, rabid stray dogs who appear as minor antagonists in Walt Disney Pictures' 2006 CGI film, ''[[The Wild]]''. These vicious mutts have no place as man's best friend.

== Background ==

=== Physical Appearance ===
The dogs shown are three different breeds, all of which are rabid and show no fear of man or the protagonists. Their names are Monty, Jacques, and Raber. Monty is the white poodle (the alpha of the pack), Jacques is the Rottweiler, and Raber is the brown boxer. The dogs each have rows of sharp teeth, covered in foam from frothing at the mouth. With the rabies virus controlling them, they show no fear of anyone. It's possible they turned rabid after being left by their owners, forced to live on the streets of New York City, and possibly been bitten by a carrier who had the rabies virus.

=== Personality ===
Not much is known about the dogs' history but it's possible they use to be lovable mutts who were loyal to their owners until they were abandoned by them. As their life on the streets increased, the dogs grew more aggressive and fierce as they chase away any intruders, including humans away from their territory. Then, at some point in their life, they had been bitten by possibly other rabid dogs, or another carrier and became infected with rabies. The virus turned them into rabid, vicious animals who show no fear of man or animal, no matter what size.

== Appearance ==
Monty, Jacques, and Raber first appeared after [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]], [[Bridget]], [[Larry (The Wild)|Larry]], and [[Nigel (The Wild)|Nigel]] narrowly escaped from being crushed by the compacter of the [[Hoyt Sanitation Truck]] on Fifth Avenue after they scared the truck's driver. After the protagonists walk down the street looking for the Statue Of Liberty, the dogs appear behind the truck and Bridget comment that they should be fun for Samson. Instead of standing his ground, Samson tells Nigel to grab on to Bridget as Larry holds onto her back and they make a run for it. The animals find an alley, which also has a dead end and watch the dogs run past them, thinking they're scot free. Nigel even teases that they're stupid and that they could've taken them. 

However, that all changed when dogs finally found them and begin slowly approaching them, growling viciously and showing they're frothy, sharp teeth. Larry tries to improvise by barking back but his impersonating bark has no effect on the dogs who have better barks. Bridget isn't afraid and tells them that even if they got bark, Samson's got roar and tells Samson to show them. Samson tries to dig deep and be the lion but the sight of Monty frothing at the mouth took away his chance. The animals reach the dead end as the dogs slowly close in on them, then Samson spots the sewer gutter and tells Larry to coil, which he does and grabs on. Then, Samson pokes Bridget's rear which sends Larry up to a beam, allowing him to open the gutter. Samson tells Bridget to jump down, followed by Nigel, Samson himself, and Larry as the dogs start to run towards them. Larry gets stuck at the small opening of the gutter as Jacques and Raber run towards him, but manages to squeeze through just as the dogs stopped and continue barking as well as Monty squeezing his head through the opening, looking down. 

It's unknown what happened to the dogs after the protagonists escaped. It's possible they may have continued roaming through the New York City streets until being captured by animal control and taken to an Animal Quarantine Center where they were tested and possibly, euthanized.
