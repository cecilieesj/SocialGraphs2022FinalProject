}}'''Tank''' is the (former) secondary antagonist in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''.
==Role in the film==
Tank was formerly [[Bradley Uppercrust III]]'s right-hand man and the new leader of the "Gamma Mu Mu" fraternity at [[Max Goof]]'s [[Unnamed college|college]]. After Bradley blasts Max and Tank into a giant X-Games logo, Tank helps Max win the X-Games after Max saves him. Reforming after Max won the X-Games competition, Tank, acting in revenge on Brad for his betrayal and nearly getting him killed during the competition, grabs Brad and throws him into the [[ESPN]] blimp, or as he put it, "get on the last jet to nowhere." As a result, he later became the new leader of the Gammas and possibly has the team stop cheating and compete fair in future competitions.
