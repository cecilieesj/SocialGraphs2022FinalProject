In "Tattler's Tale", she tells Honey Buttowski lies about Kick because she hates him and wants to see Kick punished, but then Kick rallies some of his friends and even foes to thwart their common enemy Ms. Chicarelli. She is a secondary antagonist in Season 1 and a primary antagonist in Season 2.

In the episode "Detained", before she retired she used to have the record for giving the most detentions in Mellowbrook Elementary School history.
