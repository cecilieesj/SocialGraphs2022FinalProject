'''Skyler''' is a recurring character of the [[Disney Channel]] series, ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]''. She is friends with [[Teddy Duncan]] and is also the girlfriend of [[PJ Duncan]]. She was portrayed by [[Samantha Boscarino]].

==Personality==
Skyler is not the smartest person you'll ever meet. She doesn't catch on very fast and gets confused easily. When [[Spencer Walsh|Spencer]] and her went out Spencer claimed to Teddy that Skyler and he were cousins and told Skyler that he and Teddy were cousins when she saw Teddy's picture in his wallet.

==Personal life==
Skyler was Spencer's love interest some time after he started dating Teddy ("Girl Bites Dog").

She seems to be just as upset about her break-up as Teddy was. But later became friends with Teddy besides thinking she was odd ("[[Teddy's Broken Heart Club Band]]"). She also likes the Gurgles just like PJ.

==Relationships==
===Brock===
Skyler's past boyfriend, Brock, is captain of the wrestling team. Skyler is sad whenever he texts her. ("[[Teddy's Bear]]")
===Spencer Walsh===
Skyler dated Spencer for an unknown amount of time, but they started going out sometime after Spencer and Teddy became a couple. They broke up after Skyler found out he was cheating on her with Teddy Duncan.
===PJ Duncan===
At first, she pretends to dislike him in front of Teddy. She quickly turned around and mouthed the words "call me". She appears to be dumber than PJ throughout the series. Skyler's "dad" was watching PJ when they first started to date, but later in the episode, PJ finds that he is just hired to pretend to be her father after he claims that he is the one for Skyler in "Monkey Business". In her last appearance PJ in the City, she and PJ break up after she moves to New York, although PJ tries to follow her. He took on Brock just for Skyler ("Teddy's Bear").
===Teddy Duncan===
Teddy and Skyler are friends. They performed together with PJ and The Vibe in the Battle of the Bands. They were both dating Spencer at the same time. Spencer had told Teddy that Skyler and he were just cousins. They first met each other in "Girl Bites Dog" at Spencer's job. When they found out that they were both dating Spencer, Skyler poured Spencer's new smoothie on his head and Teddy shoved pie on a stick in his face.
===[[Ivy Wentz]]===
Skyler became Ivy's friend in "Teddy's Broken Heart Club Band". She and Ivy, as well as Teddy, made a video together- but they ended up not publishing the video. It is unknown if they met each other again. Ivy was probably unaware of Skyler and PJ's relationship.

*She and her new boyfriend PJ claim that they never get the look Teddy gets when she has an idea.
*She likes the Gurgles, just like PJ when he introduced it to her.
