The character is essentially meant to serve as an obvious character replacement, following the revelation that Roz was, in fact, the actual head of the [[Child Detection Agency]] and therefore unable to continue her job at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]]

==Background==
===Personality===
Roze is identical to Roz in every way. She is grumpy, never smiles and always is shown to be very displeased with everyone and everything. According to Roz, Roze is not as "bubbly" as her which is shown by her being more verbally antagonistic towards Mike and belittling him every chance she gets. In "[[The Vending Machine]]", she claims to have an infectious smile.

===Physical appearance===
Roze has the same physical appearance as Roz with some notable exceptions. Her hair is pink with some grey spots in it, implying that she dyes it, with a small tuft hanging on the front left side. She lacks her sister's glasses as well as the mole on her chin and wears a green V-neck vest with gold stitching on it.

==Trivia==
*Her voice actor [[Bob Peterson]] also voiced [[Roz]] her twin sister.
*She apparently has more hair than just on her head; something that disturbs Tylor.
*In "[[It's Laughter They're After]]", Mike insinuates that she and Roz might actually be the same person.
