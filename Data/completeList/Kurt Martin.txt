'''Kurt Martin''' is a minor recurring character in ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]''. He is the biological father of [[Zack Martin|Zack]] and [[Cody Martin]] and ex-husband of [[Carey Martin]]. He is played by Robert Torti

==Story==
Though heard briefly in a video in "Poor Little Rich Girl", Kurt is formally introduced in "Dad's Back", where he visits ex-wife Carey Martin and his kids, Zack and Cody. Though Kurt does not stay long to visit, Zack stows away on his rock band's tour bus after a playful comment by Kurt, telling Zack to come live with him on the road. Despite being on the road, Kurt has to find time to take care of Zack and help him with his homework, and eventually get him back to the Tipton.

Kurt appears again at Christmastime, where he was supposed to take Zack and Cody snowboarding, but was snowed in at the hotel instead, where Cody tried unsuccessfully to get him and Carey back together, "like a family."

Kurt and Carey are currently divorced, though they visit Zack and Cody together on the S.S. Tipton in "Mom and Dad on Deck", saying that they'd love to move onto the ship with the boys. Enjoying their freedom, Zack and Cody hatch a plan to get rid of their parents, and though Kurt and Carey discover this, they eventually decide not to move onto the boat.

==Personality==
Kurt is really a happy-go-lucky guy who is a kid at heart. He is also an open-minded father and can be mindless at times. His creativity in buying Zack and Cody gifts revealed in both ''Suite Life of Zack and Cody'', and ''Suite Life on Deck''. In the former title, he bought Cody an ancient Chinese calculator, and gave Zack his lengendary guitar. In the sequel, he got Zack and Cody a car since they are "out in the ocean, nothing can stop [him from teaching them how to drive]." Overall, he is a loving dad and possibly husband. However, his mindlessness is often viewed as irresponsible, and that is possibly why Carey, his ex-wife and mother of Zack and Cody, left him in the first place.

==Trivia==
*In "Mom and Dad on Deck", Kurt Martin is accidentally written as "Rick Martin" in the credits.
