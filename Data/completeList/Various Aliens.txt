==Trivia==
*In ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', it reveals several aliens whose genes were used to create [[Stitch]].
**The claws of a Fearsome Manglyoid Upmoridian Four.
**A Goo Gobbling Booger Beast's habit of picking its nose with its tongue, which explains Stitch's habit of picking his nose with his tongue.
***[[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]] and [[Angel]] have also picked their noses with their tongues, implying that a Goo Gobbling Booger Beast's template was also used in their creations.
****[[Leroy]] has picked his nose with his tongue as well, since he is a cloned counterpart of Stitch and has the same genetic template as him. This would also extend to [[Leroy Clones|his clones]].
**The eyes of a People Eating Puss Monkey.
***Also, the experiments that have blank eyes (mainly Angel, [[627]], and Leroy) imply that the People Eating Puss Monkey's template was also used in their creations.
****[[Spooky]] even changed into a similar-looking creature several times.  
**An alien with a lot of teeth.
**A Bottom Feeding Scum Sucker, which is possibly where Stitch's appetite comes from and the possession of spikes on the back.
