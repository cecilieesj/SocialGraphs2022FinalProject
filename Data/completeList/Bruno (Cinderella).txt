{{Quote|Bruno... Bruno! Dreaming again?|[[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] to Bruno|}}
'''Bruno''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]]'s [[1950]] animated feature film, ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''. He is Cinderella's loyal pet bloodhound.
==Background==
When Bruno was a puppy, he was given to a younger Cinderella as a gift from her father. After the latter died, Bruno and Cinderella grew up together under the hand of her evil stepmother, [[Lady Tremaine]], who has two daughters, [[Anastasia]] and [[Drizella]], and a cat, [[Lucifer]], whom Bruno hates because of the way he treats Cinderella and his taunting and manipulations.

===Personality===
Apart from his friendly nature, Bruno is very loyal and understanding to Cinderella. However, he has little patience for Lucifer, whom he doesn't like, which usually causes him to get sent out of the house due to Lady Tremaine's rules. At the end of the first movie, he gets his revenge by scaring Lucifer out the window.

===Physical appearance===
Bruno is a big slender bloodhound dog with red-brown fur covering most of his body (in the sequel it seems to be brighter though due to the animation style). He has a black nose, floppy ears, a tail, light-brown eyes, sharp nails that are usually always sticking out, and three little hairs like [[Goofy]]'s on his head. He is also shown to have fierce teeth (often shown to Lucifer) and yet also he has a friendly face to him.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''===
Bruno first seen during the prologue when Cinderella is a child (with himself being a puppy), he is seen happily alongside her, [[Major (Cinderella)|Major]] and [[Cinderella's Father|her father]] at the Château, showing that Cinderella's father loved her, giving her what she wanted, though staying kind.

Years later, Bruno first appears sleeping in the kitchen, dreaming about chasing [[Lucifer]] (having a disdain for him). When [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] wakes him up, he is happy to see her, but she then tells him how it is bad that he has caught Lucifer (as he was enjoying the fact that he had caught Lucifer in his dream) in his dream and that he should learn to be nice to cats, which is an idea he does not like. She tries to point out that Lucifer has his good points, but she can't think of any, which causes Bruno to laugh at Lucifer's expense. Lucifer then scratches Bruno on the face, causing him to growl at him, and then Lucifer pretends that Bruno has hurt him. This results in Cinderella sending Bruno outside, though with a kind lecture. However Cinderella seems to know the truth of what happened when she also sternly lectures Lucifer, as she believes he provoked Bruno.

Later that night, Bruno watches Cinderella run outside to the garden, wearing her torn-up dress (destroyed by Anastasia and Drizella due to the bead and sash which they threw away earlier and not wanting her to go to the ball due to manipulation from Lady Tremaine), to cry on the bench nearby. He and [[Major (Cinderella)|Major]] look sad for the fact about what happened to her and that she is not going to the ball. Then they see a fog with sparkling stars is heading to her, which turns out to be the entrance of her [[Fairy Godmother]]. Bruno is turned into a human footman by her for [[Pumpkin Coach|Cinderella's pumpkin coach]] to take her to the ball, sitting next to Cinderella.

On the stroke of midnight, when the spell is broken, Bruno is turned back into his true form of a bloodhound as they need to rush away from the guards, leading to a chase scene. Alongside Cinderella, Major, and the mice, he runs behind the bushes, away from the [[Royal Guards (Cinderella)|palace guards]] who go past the [[pumpkin]] and smash it (though it was already returned to its true form). He is shown to be happy and pleased that Cinderella had fun at the ball and danced with [[Prince Charming]], smiling.

Near the end of the film, [[Lady Tremaine]] has locked Cinderella in her bedroom, and [[Jaq and Gus]] have stolen the key from Lady Tremaine, but Lucifer has trapped it and [[Jaq and Gus|Gus]] under a teacup before he can free her. Realizing that Bruno may be the only one who can get rid of Lucifer, Cinderella tells her [[Birds (Cinderella)|bird&nbsp;friends]] to fetch him and to allow Bruno to finally catch the cat he hates the most. They fly down to the shed and try to wake him up, with Major helping them (by neighing at him because he wouldn't wake up). He then follows them as he rushes into the chateau and, after being helped by them to get inside, scrambles up the tower staircase to arrive just outside Cinderella's room, where he catches Lucifer. He then lets out a growl, scaring Lucifer into jumping out the window. He jumps on the windowsill attempting to bite Lucifer and watches him fall to the ground below, finally getting back at him while allowing the mice to finally free Cinderella from her room. He is last seen joining Cinderella and [[Prince Charming]] alongside Major on their honeymoon.

===''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]''===
[[File:Cinderella2-disneyscreencaps com-866.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Bruno in ''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True'']]
Bruno returns in the second film, however with a much smaller role than he had in the original, serving more of a cameo than a supporting role than he did before. Bruno is also only shown twice in the film and only in the first segment of the film, ''Aim to Please''.

He is first seen alongside [[Jaq and Gus]] and [[Mary Mouse|Mary]] reuniting with Cinderella, just returning to the [[King's Castle|castle]], his new home after Cinderella's wedding, he is seen licking Cinderella, her laughing, seeming glad to be reuniting. He is then seen the next morning, when the snobbish chief of servants of the palace [[Prudence]] comes to wake up Cinderella, put is shocked to be licked, by Bruno, sleeping in her bed, panting, much to the annoyance of Prudence and shock of the ladies-in-waiting [[Beatrice and Daphne]].

===Other appearances===
Bruno makes an appearance in his human form in the ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Walt Disney Presents]]'' episode "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (Walt Disney Presents episode)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]" alongside [[Major (Cinderella)|Major]] (also in his human form) and Cinderella, riding on the [[Pumpkin Coach]].

Bruno also makes an appearance in Cinderella's ''[[As Told by Emoji]]''. He is first seen when the Fairy Godmother arrives alongside Cinderella, [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq, and Gus]] as they are transformed, Bruno into a footman. He is then seen at the stroke of twelve, turning back into his true form and is subsequently confronted by [[Lady Tremaine]]. He then appears in the end alongside the other characters appearing, beside Cinderella and [[Prince Charming]].

==Trivia==
*Bruno was used against [[Lucifer]] at the end of the first movie, but for some reason, he was never used against [[Pom-Pom]]. In fact, Bruno is only seen twice in the second film with a minor role.
*Bruno does not appear in the [[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time|third]] film, nor in the [[Cinderella (2015 film)|live-action adaptation]]. This could be due to budget limitations, or possibly a lack of purpose in the story.
*Bruno is one of several bloodhounds from Disney animated canon movies, including [[Trusty]], [[Towser]], [[Copper]], [[Napoleon and Lafayette|Napoleon]], and [[Stella (The Princess and the Frog)|Stella]].
*Although he is not a major character, he is a very important character, as he was the reason that Lucifer was chased out so Cinderella could retrieve her happy ending, being pivotal to the ending.
