'''Kimballum Horriblus''' is the official name retroactively assigned to the '''Sea Serpent''' from the defunct attraction, [[World of Motion]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Kimballum Horriblus is a species of sea-serpent documented as having lived in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Monaco.  Around 1492, it terrorized Spanish/Italian colonist [[Christopher Columbus|Crist贸bal Col贸n]].  The only known documentation of the animal was performed by sailor and scientist [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] on a map created for the ''[[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]''.

=== Development history ===
The sea serpent originally appeared in the attraction World of Motion where it terrorized a depiction of Crist贸bal Col贸n.  The creature's figure was later moved to the queue of the Hollywood Studios Backlot in [[Disney California Adventure|Disney's California Adventure]] along with other props from World of Motion.  Eventually, this figure was dismantled and removed.  The appointed name of Kimballum Horriblus was created for the [[Skipper Canteen]], being a tribute to imagineer [[Ward Kimball]] who worked on World of Motion.
