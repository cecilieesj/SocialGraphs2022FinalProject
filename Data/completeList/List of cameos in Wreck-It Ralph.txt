**In the same scene, they must pull themselves out using vines made of [[Wikipedia:Laffy Taffy|Laffy Taffy]], which gets attracted to anything they find funny.
*Several [[Wikipedia:Oreo|Oreo]] cookies act as guards at King Candy's castle. Their "Oreo" chant is, in turn, a reference to the guards of the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West in ''The Wizard of Oz''.
*In one of the scenes that take place in Litwak's Arcade and Family Fun Center near the beginning of the film, a soda with a cup that reads ''Subway'' is shown on-screen on an arcade game. (That means this movie partnered up for the first time.)
*One of the arcade games in Litwak's Arcade is a made-up game called ''Undead Apocalypse'', made by Crosman and Airsoft.
*The Sorceress bears a resemblance to the [[w:c:battletoads:Dark Queen|Dark Queen]] from ''[[w:c:battletoads:Main Page|Battletoads]]'' with the coloration of [[w:c:darkstalkers:Lilith|Lilith]] from ''[[w:c:darkstalkers:Main Page|Darkstalkers]]''.
*The Konami Code is used as the password to unlock the game vault.

Helen Chen, one of the visual development artists for the film, was originally supposed to have a cameo as a caricature, however due to unknown reasons she was scrapped.

==Mentions and Allusions==
*[[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Piglet]], [[Rabbit]], [[Eeyore]], [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]], [[Kanga]], and [[Roo]] from the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh series]]'' (names appeared on a screen board of the ''Food Fight'' arcade cabinet ['''Note''': Eeyore also made a cameo on his own in the movie.])
*[[Captain America]] (mentioned during an interview with Groot)
*[[Red Skull]] (mentioned during an interview with Groot)
*[[Drax the Destroyer]] (mentioned during an interview with Groot)
*[[w:c:mario:Mario|Mario]] (mentioned by Felix in the 30th Anniversary party. ['''Note''': Mario was intended to have a physical appearance in the film alongside his brother, [[w:c:mario:Luigi|Luigi]]. However, the producers could not find a place to work them into the story that felt right for their significance.])
*[[Aerith]] from ''[[w:c:finalfantasy:Final Fantasy VII|Final Fantasy VII]]'' (referenced and written in graffiti as ''Aerith Lives'' on a subway wall in Game Central Station)
*[[w:c:streetfighter:Sheng Long|Sheng Long]] from the ''Street Fighter'' series (his name appears as a graffiti at the portal leading to ''Sugar Rush'')
*[[w:c:pacman:Jr. Pac-Man|Jr. Pac-Man]] (mentioned by Vanellope)
*[[w:c:laracroft:Lara Croft|Lara Croft]] from ''[[w:c:Tomb Raider|Tomb Raider]]'' (given sarcastically by Wreck-It Ralph as his name when trying to get past the [[Surge Protector]]) ('''Note''': Lara Croft was intended to have a physical appearance in the film. However, the producers could not find a place to work her into the story that felt right for her significance.)
*[[w:c:theportalwiki:GLaDOS|GLaDOS]] from ''[[Wikipedia:Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' ''(Incorrectly pronounced as "Gladys")''
*[[Wikipedia:Leeroy Jenkins|Leeroy Jenkins]] (shown as graffiti on the Terminal Wall as "Leeroy" and later "Jenkins")
*[[Wikipedia:Zero Wing|Zero Wing]] (referenced in graffiti on the Terminal Wall as ''[[Wikipedia:All your base are belong to us|All your base are belong to us]]'')
*[[Tron (character)|Tron]] from ''[[Tron]]''

==False rumored cameos==
These are characters that people believe to have seen in the movie while not actually being there. Most of these can even be found in many lists of cameos around the web.
*[[Mary Mouse]], [[Perla and Suzy]] from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'': It was believed that one of them was on Cinderellaâs hand when she met Vanellope, but it was actually a completely different mouse, who was seen along with the other 3 mice in the film while cleaning Cinderellaâs outfit with a feather.
*[[Maximus]] from ''[[Tangled]]'': a white horse in Game Central Station was rumored to be Maximus, but it's actually a generic white horse with no similarity to him other than its color. Oddly enough, "The Gamers Guide", a special feature in the Blu Ray version of the movie that shows some of the hidden easter eggs, also highlights the horse.
*Lian-Chu from ''[[Wikipedia:Dragon Hunters|Dragon Hunters]]'': It was believed that he made a cameo, but a closer look shows that it is actually Vladimir from ''Tangled''.
*[[Sora]] from ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'': One of the sprites in the gameplay scene of ''Tapper'' was believed by many to be Sora. It was actually proven to just be one of the many generic cowboys in the game, only with matching colors to Sora. Had he appeared, Sora would've been the only Disney character originating from a Disney game to appear in the film, though graffiti of his crown necklace appears in the portal to ''[[Sugar Rush]]''.
*[[w:c:finalfantasy:Moogle|Moogle]] from the ''Final Fantasy'' series: In one of the first renders of Game Central Station, some white and red shapes were believed to be Moogles with their pom-poms. The same image viewed in higher definition shows those shapes to actually be the shirts and pants of generic sport games characters.
*[[w:c:zelda:Deku Link|Deku Link]] from ''[[w:c:zelda:The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'': It was believed that he made a cameo, but a closer look shows that it is actually Bentley Bear from ''Crystal Castles''.
