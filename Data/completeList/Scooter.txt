'''Scooter''' is a male humanoid Muppet who serves as a "gofer" backstage on ''[[w:c:muppet:The Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]''.
==Background==
Scooter serves as a "gofer" backstage on ''The Muppet Show'', and appeared from the first produced episode through the end of the series. Possessing glasses with eyes embedded in the lenses and generally wearing a green track jacket, Scooter is a vaguely humanoid character of unknown heritage (as cited in ''Of Muppets and Men'', when pressed about his family, he explained that his mother was a parrot but he didn't know about his father).

Scooter's position at [[The Muppet Theater]] is as general aide and gofer. Although initially hired because his uncle, J. P. Grosse, owns The Muppet Theater, Scooter holds on to his job through both nepotism and efficiency. Scooter had been around since the first (production) episode, but his proper introduction, including his hiring and identification as J. P. Grosse's nephew, occurs in episode 106. Scooter's family connections served as a running gag, especially during the first season.
