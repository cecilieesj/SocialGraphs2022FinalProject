==''Lifted''==
One night, Stu is able to take control of the UFO, and attempts to capture a human named [[Ernie]]. Inexperienced, Stu makes several unsuccessful attempts before [[Mr. B]], a more experienced alien, takes over. Upset over his failures, Stu begins to cry, but Mr. B offers him the chance to take control of the ship once more and fly the two back home. Ecstatic, Stu begins to lift the UFO up higher for a moment, then accidentally lets it fall and completely crushes the house (leaving behind only Ernie in his bed). Finally, the two blast off.
