'''Kyle Cooper''' is a tight end for the [[Boston Rebels]] in the film ''[[The Game Plan]]''. Like many of the players, he took a liking to [[Peyton Kelly]]. When he heard she was named after a scientist rather than a football player, he said "That's stupid". Peyton responded by saying that "'Stupid' is a mean word." When the Rebels lined up for their final play in the championship game, a New York Dukes defender taunted Cooper and asked if he was stupid. Cooper responded to the defender in the same fashion that Peyton responded to him. On the play, Cooper blocked the defender, put him on his back and yelled "Stay off my quarterback!" His block gave [[Joe Kingman]] the time he needed to throw the winning touchdown pass to [[Travis Sanders]].
