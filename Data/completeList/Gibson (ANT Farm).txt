'''Henry Gibson''' is a character from the live-action television program, ''[[A.N.T. Farm]]''. He is the A.N.T Farm's counselor, tutor, and therapist all rolled into one. He's also the founder of the A.N.T. program after being inspired by kids with special talents. Gibson is his last name.

==Personality==
Gibson is goofy, crazy, and childlike. He often hides things in his hair, which creeps or grosses most people out. However, he is friends with all of the A.N.T.s, and is very fair, caring, and easygoing at most points. He is one of the less smart people in the series who can be nice and positive, the other being Paisley.

Sometimes, Gibson can maybe be a little bit annoying, or even just plain creepy, he puts things in his hair, like licorice, or tissues. At other times Gibson is the only person who really cares about any of the A.N.T.s. So he is a blessing to all of them.

==Appearance==
Gibson has curly hair. He is almost always seen wearing a striped top and basically anything else. As seen in pictures, below he has a yellow and black striped umbrella, so you can practically call him a "bumble bee".
