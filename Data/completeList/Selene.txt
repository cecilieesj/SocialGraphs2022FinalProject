She is the Greek goddess of the moon who has a relationship with [[the Duck Family]] and is an old friend of [[Della Duck]].

==Role in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|series]]==
Before her appearance, Selene was indirectly mentioned whenever an item called the [[Spear of Selene]] was brought up. Selene made her proper debut in the episode "[[The Spear of Selene!]]" when [[Scrooge McDuck]] and [[Donald Duck]]'s return to [[Ithaquack]] incurred the wrath of the Greek pantheon's leader, [[Zeus (DuckTales)|Zeus]]. She was sought after by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey Duck]] and [[Webby Vanderquack]] for info on [[Della Duck]]. Expecting Della to be among them, Selene left a cryptic message hoping to attract Della, which Dewey and Webby find. After they enter Selene's sacred temple, Selene surprises the kids only to find not Della, but her son Dewey. Dewey asks Selene about the Spear of Selene, but since she has not seen Della in a long time, Selene knows nothing about the item or the fact that Della has disappeared. Without enough information from Selene on his mother, Dewey gets frustrated with his unanswered questions. Selene reassures Dewey that Della cared about her family and would do everything to help them; she gives Dewey her "sphere of Selene" to help him on his quest and urges him not to give up on finding Della.

In following episodes, the Spear of Selene was revealed to be not a spear, but a rocket ship Della named presumably in honor of Selene, the same rocket she ultimately became lost in while in space.

Selene returned in "[[Treasure of the Found Lamp!]]", allowing Scrooge and Webby use of her temple to distract [[Dijon|D'jinn]] while the boys were searching for his lamp in [[Duckburg]]. As part of their madeup trials, Selene and Scrooge posed in a minotaur costume to present D'jinn with a riddle that he ultimately solved. Lastly, as Selene desperately stalled D'jinn by keep the door to her sanctum from fully opening before the trio were informed by the triplets that [[Ma Beagle]] had the lamp. Selene then slipped into her garden through a secret passage and pretended to await D'jinn and told him this new information.

Selene appeared again in "[[Moonvasion!]]" where Zeus forbade her and [[Storkules]] from assisting Scrooge against the Moonlanders though she apologizes to Della for not being able to help. She and Storkules eventually stand up to Zeus and after having him tied-up, she appears in [[General Lunaris]]' ship to inform him that Storkules is using his strength to restore the Earth back to its original position (after Lunaris used a planetary engine to change its orbit so it would orbit the Moon) and that his ship will now orbit the Earth as a second moon with him in it.

==Trivia==
*In mythology, Selene's role as a lunar deity is often shared with {{WikipediaLink|Artemis}}, and sometimes {{WikipediaLink|Hecate}}.
*This version of Selene is a sibling of Hercules (in this case [[Storkules]]).
