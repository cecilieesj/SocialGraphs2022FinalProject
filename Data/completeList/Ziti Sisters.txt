Ziti Sisters was a wild wacky group of Italian sisters each with their own "offering" to the world. Rosalia is the Fashionista, Katia is the Musician, Paulina loves History and Art, Theresa is Romantic while Carmella Loves Song and Dance. They used to roam the [[Italy Pavilion]].

The sisters will teach the audience many things about Italy including the dance, fashion, culture, art, and music.
