'''Pele''', the Goddess of Fire and Volcanoes, is one of the Tiki Goddesses in the pre-show of [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Pele is the short-tempered goddess of fire and volcanoes, in traditional Māori myth she is also affiliated as the mother goddess of the Pacific islands.  Some cultural practices include making offers to Pele at the Halemaʻumaʻu crater with flowers, food and gin.  Some regions even have Pele as the feature of a sort of urban-legend where she appears on the roads of the Pali highway at night to stop cars and trucks with her powers and can only be passed by feeding pork to her dog.
