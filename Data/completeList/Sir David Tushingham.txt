'''Sir David Tushingham''' is a pompous, British-accented latter-day paleontologist who appeared twice on ''[[Dinosaurs]]'', hosting clip show episodes. He was played by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Paxton_Whitehead Paxton Whitehead]. In "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_216:_The_Clip_Show The Clip Show]," Sir David offers the viewers a tour of an archeological dig while discussing different aspects of dinosaur culture. According to the documentary-style titles, Tushingham received his Ph.D. from Oxford Community College.

In "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_322:_The_Clip_Show_II The Clip Show II]," Sir David displays a more hucksterish side, acting as host for an infomercial promoting his "Famous Paleontologists' Home Study Course."
