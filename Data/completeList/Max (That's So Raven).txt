==Season 1==
After [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] had a vision of the correct answers to Senorita Rodriguez's Spanish test, Eddie begs for the answers. Raven wouldn't give them up so Eddie cut ties with Raven and only hung out with Max.
Max was dim-witten and tried to fit a basketball into the locker by putting it on its side. Max later reappeared when Tanya Baxter became a teacher at the school and developed a crush on her.
