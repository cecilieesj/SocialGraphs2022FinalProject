==Appearances==
===''[[Avengers Assemble|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]''===
Dante Pertuz is a teenager of Inhuman heritage. When an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] ship carrying [[Seeker]] and the Alpha Primitives crashes into the nearby mountains, the Terrigen Fog was released from the ship and Dante is among those affected, causing him to undergo Terrigenesis. During his metamorphosis, both the Avengers and the Inhumans find his Terrigen Cocoon inside a building and fight over it. However, during the scuffle Dante emerges as an unstable Inferno and went on a rampage. The Avengers and the Inhumans work together to fight Inferno until Hulk and Lockjaw return with a Terrigen Crystal to use on Inferno and the Alpha Primitives, restoring themselves as the Terrigen Fog disperses. Now in control of his abilities, Dante befriends the Inhumans where he takes up their offer to live part-time on Attilan.

In "The Inhuman Condition", Inferno had obtained a special suit that could withstand his powers. He is among the Inhumans that were captured by Ultron, although he is later freed by the Avengers. In "The Kids Are All Right", Captain America and Iron Man find Inferno fighting a stray Ultron robot where their fight leads them to a hotel. With help from Inferno's new friend [[Ms. Marvel]], Captain America, Iron Man, and Inferno destroy the Ultron drone. Captain America later gives Inferno and Ms. Marvel a tour of Avengers Tower which is disrupted when Iron Man's old enemy Ghost attacks. Inferno and Ms. Marvel work with Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Falcon to defeat Ghost.

In the episode "Civil War, Part 1: The Fall of Attilan," Inferno is still getting control of his powers. At the time when Maximus was being taken to be imprisoned, he mind-controls Inferno into losing control so that his fire can set off the Terrigen Bomb that would level New Attilan. After Hulk breaks Inferno from Maximus' control, Inferno turns himself over to Truman Marsh's Guardsmen.

In the episode "Civil War, Part 4: Avengers Revolution," Inferno is among the Inhumans who are mind-controlled by Ultron using the Registration Disks on their necks. During the fight at an old facility that was previously used by Howard Stark, Hulk subdued Inferno in order for Iron Man to test the frequency that would negate the Registration Disks that Ultron is using to control the Inhumans. This experiment was a success.

===''[[Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors]]''===
Inferno appears in the Marvel special ''Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors''.
