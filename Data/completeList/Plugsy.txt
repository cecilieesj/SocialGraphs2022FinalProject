==Appearances==
===''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]''===
Plugsy is a pear-shaped lamp with a light bulb upgrade, who is a current ally to the [[Cutting-Edge Appliances]]. He tries to prevent his former allies, [[Toaster]] and his gang, from letting the Master ([[Rob McGroarty|Rob]]) take them to college. When Toaster and his fellow appliances arrive at the Master's new apartment, Plugsy pretends to welcome them. However, Plugsy and the Cutting-Edge Appliances trick them, and Plugsy himself kicks Toaster and his gang into a dumpster in order to force the Master to take him, Two-face Sewing Machine, Hand Mixer and [[T.V.]] instead. However, due to T.V.'s intervention, the Master finds out that his appliances are gone and rejects his mother's new appliances, saying he prefers his "oldies but goodies." Plugsy puts on a disappointed face and is heartbroken over the whole matter.
