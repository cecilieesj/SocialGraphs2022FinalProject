==Appearances==
===''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''===
Robert Gonzales was an agent, who dedicated his life to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. During his career as agent, Gonzales met Coulson at the Triskelion. After exposure of HYDRA to the world, he sent Bobbi Morse and Alphonso Mackenzie to infiltrate into Coulson's [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and get Fury's toolbox. When Lance Hunter discovered the true alliance of Morse and Mack, Mackenzie decided to take along with Gonzales to talk. Gonzales explained to Hunter hat this was the "real" SHIELD where there were no secrets. After Hunter escaped from the "real" [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Morse was asked by Gonzalez how they should act; she replied that the real threat was Coulson and his secrets and that they must neutralize the threat.

When his men took control over Coulson's SHIELD facility, Gonzales asked Coulson to open Fury's toolbox. Coulson refused this request, Gonzales asked an agent to carry the toolbox to Anne Weaver, Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz to open it. Suddenly, Melinda May broke into Coulson's office and knocked out Gonzales, allowing Coulson escape.

After surrender, Coulson asked Robert Gonzales help in their fight against HYDRA. Gonzales agreed, but on condition that the Council decide if they should help. Gonzales revealed to Morse accepted Coulson's request only to catch gifted people. He was surprised when Coulson revealed that [[Nick Fury]] was still alive.

After a successful mission, Gonzalez thought Coulson could be a great leader. He later went to meet Jiaying, the leader of the inhuman. He was compared his scars of war with her, which angered Jiaying. This comparison led to Jiaying to do something crazy, she murdered Gonzales in cold blood. Gonzales tried to use his gun against her but he became petrified before making a shot.
