'''Arizona Goof''' (original Italian name: Indiana Pipps) is an archaeologist and a cousin of [[Goofy]]. Arizona has a weird habit of not using beds, doors, or stairs. Instead, he sleeps in a tent, enters and exits houses through windows, and climbs floors by a rope. Arizona is fond of a specific brand of liquorice candy (the brand is called ''Negritas ''in original Italian language version, Tuju in the Finnish language translation), which he never travels without and is addicted to the taste of, but which everyone else finds horrible. Arizona's car is an old jeep which he has named affectionately as Gippippa. Arizona has a rival archaeologist, Dr. Kranz, who is greedy and shameless, and not above resorting to criminal behavior.
Arizona Goof received his English name in his first American comics appearance ([[1991]]). In a couple of [[2005]]–[[2006]] appearances, the character was inexplicably renamed "Arizona Dipp." But more recent uses (Disney Digicomics, [[2009]]–[[2010]]) have restored his traditional English name.  
The character Arizona Goof was created by writer Bruno Sarda and artist Massimo De Vita in [[1988]], as a spoof of the film character [[Indiana Jones]].
