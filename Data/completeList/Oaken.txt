{{Quote|Hoo-hoo!|Oakenâ€™s signature greeting}}
'''Oaken''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2013]] animated feature film, ''[[Frozen]]'' and its [[2019]] [[Frozen II|sequel]]. He is the humble shopkeeper of [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna]].

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Oaken runs [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna]]. But since [[Elsa]]'s massive winter storm hits in mid-July, he finds himself with a surplus of summer supplies. Deal-seekers beware: though he's good-natured and helpful, if you cross him, Oaken won't hesitate to throw you out of his humble establishment.''

==Appearances==
===''[[Frozen]]''===
After [[Anna]] ventures into the mountains in search of [[Elsa]] and loses her horse and cloak, and freezes her dress solid in the process, she arrives at [[Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna]]. Oaken, the store owner, excitedly greets her and offers her half-off prices on items, such as swimsuits, clogs, and homemade sun balm for his "Summer Blowout Sale" (a result of the sudden winter storm caused by Elsa). Due to the frigid weather, however, Anna asks for winter gear like boots and dresses for her trip.

Oaken points her toward his winter department, which, despite a very limited selection of supplies, has all the gear she needs. Anna decides to purchase the clothes and asks Oaken if any other woman (referring to Elsa) had come by. While Oaken responds that no one else but Anna has been crazy enough to brave the storm other than herself, [[Kristoff]] enters the trading post covered in a layer of snow so thick that it covers all but his eyes.

Oaken welcomes Kristoff with the same promotion for his summer supplies, but like Anna, Kristoff turns down the offer and asks for the remaining winter items along with some carrots for his reindeer [[Sven]]. Kristoff, inadvertently informs Anna that the blizzard is coming from [[the North Mountain]], from which he recently returned.

As Anna realizes that her sister could be on the North Mountain based on Kristoff's description, Oaken gives a high price for Kristoff's items, to which Kristoff protests, due to the little amount of money he has. As a result, Kristoff calls Oaken a crook, an insult that causes Oaken to rise and be shown as very tall before he throws Kristoff out of his store without selling a thing. After this, Oaken returns to his amiable attitude toward Anna. He apologizes for the violence, then gives her a can of lutefisk to eat and lets her buy warm clothes and boots for her journey. Aided by Oaken, Anna purchases Kristoff's items along with hers to persuade him into guiding her to the North Mountain.

===''[[Frozen Fever]]''===
Oaken made a brief cameo appearance in the animated short, taking place after the events of the film. When Elsa comes down with a cold, Oaken (shown to have a portable business called Oaken's Cloakens within the city) offers the queen a cold remedy of his own invention, only to have Elsa deny it, while Anna accepts (out of concern for Elsa's health).

===''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]''===
When [[Olaf]] visits Wandering Oaken's while gathering holiday traditions, Oaken invites Olaf to join in the "holiday sweat" with him and his family. Being a snowman, the sauna heat melts Olaf. Oaken gathers the snowman in a bucket and throws him back into the cold, which re-freezes him instantly. As a keepsake, Oaken provides Olaf with his festive waist towel.

Oaken reappears again during "[[When We're Together]]", ice-skating in nothing but his towel and hat.

===''[[Frozen II]]''===
Oaken appears in a cameo role, first during "[[Some Things Never Change]]". He gives Kristoff a manicure, places a pumpkin on a table as the [[Arendelle|Arendellian]] citizens prepare to have a big feast together in the town square, and sings and dances along with everyone else after Elsa promises the flag of Arendelle will always fly.

When traversing through the main chamber of [[Ahtohallan]], Elsa comes across snowy manifestations of figures from the past. A manifestation of Oaken appears from when he meets Anna and Kristoff.

Oaken later appears with the rest of the Arendellians and the [[Trolls (Frozen)|trolls]], watching a giant tidal wave approaching to destroy Arendelle as a result of the [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] in [[the Enchanted Forest]] being destroyed. However, Elsa manages to use her powers to stop the wave, saving Arendelle, much to Oaken's and everyone else's relief.

===''[[Once Upon a Snowman]]''===
In the midquel set during ''Frozen'', after Olaf is brought to life, Oaken appears when Olaf enters his store. When he asks Olaf what he needs, Olaf replies he needs a sense of self, due to not knowing his name, then notices his lack of a nose. So Oaken asks Olaf if he wants a nose, to which Olaf says yes, but mentions doesn't have any money, though Oaken says that's all right. Olaf asks Oaken if he is carrying any carrots, but Oaken explains that he just sold the last batch, so he decides to help Olaf find a nose by having him try a variety of other objects. One of the objects is a stereoscope that features images of summertime. Olaf is immediately taken by the concept of summer, so Oaken gives him a summer sausage to use as his nose.

===Other appearances===
An emoticon version of Oaken briefly appeared in the ''Frozen Fever'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 4x06 - Family Business - Photography - Oaken and Belle.png|thumb|left|250px|Oaken talking to Belle.]]
Oaken made a cameo in [[Family Business (Once Upon a Time)|the sixth episode of the fourth season]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.

A woman, [[Belle]], makes her way toward Oaken's shop, and once inside, she has placed a map of Arendelle on the front desk for Oaken to look at. Having learned Belle wishes to search for trolls, Oaken warns the girl that they're dangerous. Belle clears it up, stating that she meant [[Trolls (Frozen)|rock trolls]], not bridge trolls, and Oaken replies that they're harmless. As Anna enters the shop, Belle asks the man if he can direct her to them. Oaken bluntly tells her no, having not ever met them. He then calls out to Anna, waving. Belle is confused, replying that Oaken just said they were nice. Belle sighs, asking him to please help her, as she just lost her mother. Oaken apologizes but states that trolls can't bring life. Oaken tells the girl he can help sooth her, however, asking if she's tried the sauna yet. Belle says no, and prepares to leave when Anna asks her if she needs any help. The two gals then introduce themselves and Oaken offers Belle a half-price visit to the sauna as she is a friend of Anna's.

===[[Disneyland Resort]]===
Oaken makes a brief appearance during ''[[Frozen: Live at the Hyperion]]'' at [[Disney California Adventure]]. He is seen throwing Kristoff into the ground exclaiming, "This is what you get for calling me a crook!" before giving his signature "Yoo-hoo!" to the audience and leaving.

In [[2021]], Oaken debuted as a walkaround character in [[Disneyland]], greeting guests during the Merriest Nites holiday event.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
In the queue for ''[[Frozen Ever After]]'' in [[Epcot]], Oaken (as an animated character) makes an appearance looking out from his sauna window and exclaiming various phrases on multiple occasions. He also serves as the ride's spokesperson.

==Trivia==
*In the Polish version of the film, Oaken speaks in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorals Podhalan dialect].
*Chris Williams' wife is from Scandinavia, which is how Williams found the inspiration for Oaken's accent.
*Two wooden troll statues sit next to the entrance of Oaken's shop. It is unknown if Oaken carved them himself and is aware of their existence or if he simply believes in them.
*Oaken's shop features one of the prime cameos in ''Frozen''. While Anna is entering his shop, there is a [[hidden Mickey]] plush toy on one of the cabinet shelves.
*Despite being a minor character, Oaken is actually quite popular among fans, especially for his "Hoo-hoo! Big summer blowout!" quote. He is viewed as one of the funniest characters in the film.
*He is the only minor character to appear in all ''Frozen'' media and one of the six characters to appear alongside Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven.
*Oaken's last name is unknown, unless "Oaken" is his last name, then his first name may be unknown.
