==Appearances==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
Glenn Talbot appeared in the episode "Nightmare in Red" as a colonel and member of [[Red Hulk|General Ross]]'s Hulkbusters unit. Talbot accompanied the General Thaddeus Ross to Helicarrier to have a meeting with the Director of SHIELD, [[Maria Hill]]. During the meeting Talbot told Hill that Hulk is a fugitive protected by disguised individuals. Later, he was responsible for arrest Hulk.

===''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''===
Glenn Talbot is a United States Air Force colonel and later brigadier general who hunts active [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents after the organization's disbandment.
In "[[Shadows]]", while he spent time with his wife and son, Coulson informs him that Creel try to kill him, Talbot does not believe him and breaks the phone. Creel suddenly appears and tries to kill him but is saved by Skye and May. When he enters in his truck, Talbot finds Melinda May.
Coulson asks him to help him but the General is not willing to help then Coulson shoots a tranquilizer. Talbot then wakes up in his truck and call its base to increase the security.

In "[[A Fractured House]]", a group of mercenaries led by Marcus Scarlotti attacked the United Nations headquarters while he gave a speech. Later, Senator Ward and General Talbot have a conversation. He tells the Senator that he knows that his brother was HYDRA agent, but he will not reveal it. After capturing Scarlotti and his group of mercenaries, he informs agent May that Julien Beckers was captured when he tried to leave the country.

Agent 33 disguised as Carla Talbot was able to infiltrate to a military base. Talbot thinking that was his wife, Carla gave her the permission to enter the base. Shortly afterwards, Carla called him to say she was going to be late because of traffic, Talbot realized that a spy was in his base. He himself was in charge of questioning the staff, however Agent 33 had already taken another look. Later, he told [[Phil Coulson]] and [[Melinda May]] that [[Agent 33]] and [[Grant Ward]] had been released [[Sunil Bakshi]] for unknown reasons; Coulson promised he would capture the duo.
