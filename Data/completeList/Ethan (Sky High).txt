==Background==
===Abilities===
'''Self-Liquification:''' Ethan can melt into a small orange puddle (which earned him the nickname "Popsicle"). When in his puddle form, he is slippery and unaffected by people stepping on him. As a puddle, he is still mobile.

===Physical appearance===
His wardrobe is made up of mostly red, orange, and yellow. He dons black rimmed glasses to help him see. His clothing choices are loose, sporty styles.

===Personality===
Ethan is the intellect of the group. When under pressure, he stammers and tends to say positive comments, as seen during his Power Placement exam and after being subjected to a swirlie from Lash and Speed. He is sensitive to the term "Sidekick" and refers to it as "Hero Support".
When with his friends, he's upbeat and enthusiastic.

==Role in the film==
Ethan is called up after Zach for Power Placement. Coach Boomer places him in the "Sidekick" class after deeming his power to be lackluster for a "Hero" classification.

In the end, he gets hailed as a hero by tricking Lash and trapping his head in a toilet. He also uses his powers to cause Speed to slip while he is running, giving Warren the opportunity to pelt him with a fireball. He is last seen at Medulla's redone Homecoming Dance.
