'''Douglas Twinkmeyer''' is the patrol officer of [[Pistol Pete|Pistol's]] preschool, and formerly the Chief of the Safety Patrol, from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

===Personality===
He is a conspiring and smart kid, and is reportedly a know-it-all. Unfortunately, he also has wicked and prideful intentions.

===Physical appearance===
Douglas is a short anthropomorphic dog with red hair and freckles. He wears a tan collared shirt that is too small for him, dark tan pants, brown shoes, and glasses. However, he occasionally wears a blue shirt (also too small for him), jeans, and white shoes. 

While playing baseball, he wears a golden yellow team jersey with red accents, red sports pants with golden yellow stripes down the sides, white shoes, and a red baseball cap.

While on patrol duty, his outfit is the same as what he normally wears, with the addition of a red sash around his left shoulder with a badge on it.

While as his "Mr. Big" persona, he slicks his hair back and switches his prescription lenses for a pair of tinted shades, and also wears 3/4 length brown gloves.

===Role in the series===
His first appearance is in the episode, "[[Lethal Goofin']]", where he attempted to eliminate a sought-after baseball card down to a single copy by hiring [[Tooth and Nails]] as his henchmen. He was later caught and demoted from Chief of the Saftey Patrol status to patrol at the preschool. This ultimately destroyed his status as the most respected kid in school. 

While this is his only major appearance, he can be seen in the background of numerous other episodes, such as in "[[Take Me Out of the Ball Game (Goof Troop)]]", where he can be seen on the team with some other children. He is also seen laughing at Goofy with the other students in his and [[Max Goof|Max's]] class in "[[Educating Goofy]]". He also makes an appearance in "[[Queasy Rider]]".

==Trivia==
*Despite being the most respected kid in school (and formerly Chief of the Safety Patrol), Douglas is behind a scheme involving bullies beating up other kids, stealing their milk money, etc., something he is in charge of stopping other kids from doing.
*A scene in Lethal Goofin' mistakenly has him wearing his gloves from his Mr. Big disguise while being in his Safety Patrol uniform.
