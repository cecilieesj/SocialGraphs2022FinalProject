==Background==
Strongbeard is described as a strong wrestler, due to his beard giving him strength. In spite of his physical ability, his beard also helps punch his opponents during a wrestling match.

Later when [[Jormungandr]] reveals that he doesn't have to use his hands during a wrestling match, Strongbeard found out that this is not what wrestlers did back then just as he, Hecka, and Fenrir turn against him for breaking the rules about wrestling.

==Role in the series==
Strongbeard is introduced in the Season 3 episode, "[[The Rumble for Ragnarok!]]".

Strongbeard is introduced as the first contender that [[Scrooge McDuck]] faces. Just as Scrooge prepares to defeat him, Strongbeard throws him and Scrooge realizes he has a string of hair from his beard, causing Scrooge to grow strong and defeat him during the match. The crowd, however, boos for Strongbeard's defeat just as one of the spectators throws a chair at Scrooge for being the most hated person by all of Valhalla.

Later when [[Jormungandr]] mentions that he doesn't have to use his hands during the match, the fans turn against him, alongside Strongbeard, Hecka, and Fenrir who are all disgusted upon hearing Jormungandr's actions that are against the rules. To help [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] win against Jormungandr, he fetches him a piece of his beard to give him strength, causing him to defeat Jormungandr during a wrestling match in order to save the world.
