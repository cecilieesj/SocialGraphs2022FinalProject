'''Jack-in-the-Box''' is a minor character seen in [[Toy Story 3|''Toy Story 3''.]]

== Cameos ==

===''Toy Story 3''===
Jack-in-the-Box is one of the toys at Sunnyside Daycare. He is a Jack in the Box toy who is first seen popping out of his box when Andy's toys fall onto the floor after they accidentally knock the box they are in off the counter.

It is unknown whether he is allied with Lotso and his gang or not, but he is most likely not as he is never seen with him.

In the end credits, he is seen welcoming more toys, including an Emperor Zurg action figure, who arrive in another box of donated toys. He is also seen at a "beach party" in a sandbox and later at a disco party in the Butterfly Room.

== Trivia ==

* There was a mutant Jack-in-the-Box which had a hand pop out in ''Toy Story'' called "[[Mutant Toys|Hand-in-the-Box]]."
