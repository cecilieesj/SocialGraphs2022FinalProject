The clan's tartan is mainly red and green, similarly to real-life Macintosh tartans. The clan's emblem is the lyre. According to the promotional vignette ''A Royal Bash'', the Macintoshs have a legend relating to their symbol, which states that a magical tune played on the lyre slayed 1,000 [[Clan Dingwall|Dingwalls]]. Macintosh is the name of a real Scottish clan, but is also the name of Apple's line of computers, a tribute to [[Steve Jobs]], to whom the film is dedicated.{{PixarWiki}}
