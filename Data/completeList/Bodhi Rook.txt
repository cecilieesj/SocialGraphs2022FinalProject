'''Bodhi Rook''' is a character who appears in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' anthology film, ''[[Rogue One]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Although Bodhi is a very experienced pilot, he has a tendency to be tense and hot-headed. Even though he was an Imperial pilot, he secretly despises the [[Galactic Empire]] and their evil ways. When trusted with an important message by [[Galen Erso]], regarding the Death Star plans and a flaw in its design, Bodhi shows to be brave and selfless, besides having a sense of justice, honor and good morals, despite knowing that he will be considered a traitor and might killed if the Empire discovers that he is helping the [[Rebel Alliance]]. 

===Abilities===
*'''Expert Pilot:''' Bodhi is extremely skilled in piloting most types of flying crafts.

==Role in the [[Rogue One|Film]]==
Bodhi is a defecting pilot who was sent by [[Galen Erso]] to the [[Rebel Alliance]] to communicate the message about the construction of the [[Death Star]]. However he is captured on [[Jedha]] by [[Saw Gerrera]]'s henchmen and brought in as a prisoner to be interrogated, which involved being tortured by a bor gullet. After captain [[Cassian Andor]], [[Baze Malbus|Baze]], [[Chirrut ÃŽmwe]] and [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]] are brought in, he is able to verify to Cassian that he is the pilot.

After the destruction of Jedha, he flees with the other rebels and joins Captain Andor after crash-landing on the Imperial base of [[Eadu]]. He later agrees to ally himself with Jyn's crew, Rogue One, and commandeers an impounded [[Imperial Shuttle]] out of [[Yavin 4]], the Rebel Alliance headquarters.

On [[Scarif]] to obtain the Death Star plans, he plays a crucial role to help communicate and project the Death Star plans out of Scarif and to the Rebel Alliance. He was killed after a grenade was thrown onto the ship.
