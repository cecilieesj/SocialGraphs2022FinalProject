'''Blind Pew''' is a threatening pirate who hunts for [[Billy Bones]] in ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''. As in the original ''[[Treasure Island]]'', Pew is after the treasure map, accompanied by other former members of [[Captain Flint]]'s crew. In contrast to the novel, where Pew's blindness enhanced his sinister qualities, his disability renders him a comic figure, grasping at a moose head and mistaking [[Jim Hawkins (Muppet Treasure Island)|Jim Hawkins]] for a girl. He also speaks with a French accent.

Blind Pew visits the [[Admiral Benbow Inn]] to give Billy Bones the black spot, indicating that Bones will soon die. He later returns with a gang of pirates, searching for Bones' treasure map. A lamp gets knocked over in the ruckus, setting the inn ablaze.

Pew is last seen wandering blindly through the flames, saying, "I think I smell something burning, no?" His fate is unknown.

He also appeared in the [[Muppet Treasure Island (video game)|''Muppet Treasure Island'' video game]] and as a gulag (sans eyepatches) prisoner in ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]].''

Blind Pew's hands were operated by [[Bill Barretta]].
