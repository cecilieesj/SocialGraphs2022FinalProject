==Appearances in ''Oz'' media produced by Disney==
===''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''===
In the film prequel, the Scarecrow's origins are explained; he was one of the scarecrows being fabricated by the Ozians as a false scare tactic during the retaliatory attack on the Emerald City.

===''[[Return to Oz]]''===
When Dorothy left [[Land of Oz|Oz]], the Scarecrow became the king of the Emerald City, but the [[Nome King]] took over Oz with the aid of [[Mombi]] by imprisoning the real ruler, [[Princess Ozma]], and using Dorothy's [[Ruby Slippers|ruby slippers]] to turn everyone into stone. The Scarecrow avoided this but was imprisoned by the Nome King. After Dorothy encountered him in the Nome King's mountain, he disappeared and was turned into an ornament by the Nome King. He is freed from this form by Dorothy while trying to free the Nome King's prisoners and they reunite. He helps her find [[Tik-Tok]], [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], and [[The Gump|the Gump]]. Unfortunately, the Nome King arrives, is angered by being nearly beaten, and tries to eat the group, starting with Jack. However, [[Billina]] appears in Jack's head and lays an egg that falls right into the Nome King's mouth, killing him, as eggs are poison to Nomes. Quickly, Dorothy uses the ruby slippers to return her, Jack, the Scarecrow, Billina, Tik-Tok, and the Gump back to the Emerald City and free the Ozians from the stone curse. The Scarecrow celebrates along with his revived friends to Dorothy's victory, and witnesses the return of Princess Ozma. He says goodbye to Dorothy as she departs from Oz once again, but knows that she can return anytime if she wants.

==Appearances in other Disney media==
===''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''===
[[File:KermitScarecrow.jpg|thumb|250px|Kermit as the Scarecrow]]
In ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', the character was portrayed by [[Kermit the Frog]]. Rescued from a field where he was tormented by crows, he joins Dorothy in the hopes of acquiring a brain. [[Glinda the Good Witch of the South|Glinda]] (played by [[Miss Piggy]]) appears to be smitten with him.

The Scarecrow puppet is differentiated from the regular Kermit puppet in that it is made from green burlap instead of fleece.

It should be noted that Kermit also played the role of the Scarecrow in "The Wizard of Foz," a comic in the fourth issue of ''[[w:c:muppet:Muppet Magazine|Muppet Magazine]]''.

===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===
[[File:Baljeet_singing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Baljeet as the Nerdcrow]]
In the episode "[[Wizard of Odd]]", [[Baljeet Tjinder]] appears in [[Candace Flynn]]'s ''Oz''-inspired dream as the '''Nerdcrow''', an obvious spoof of the Scarecrow character. Unlike his counterpart in the original story, all Nerdcrow wants is to be considered cool. In the end, [[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]] give him a pair of sunglasses to fake it.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===
In the episode "[[The Wizard of Dizz]]", the Scarecrow is portrayed by [[Goofy]].

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 5x16 - Our Decay - Scarecrow.png|thumb|250px|Scarecrow on Once Upon a Time]]
The Scarecrow appeared in the episode [[Our Decay]]. He is captured by a flying monkey, and brought to [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West]]. Needing his brain for a time-travel spell she plans to enact, Zelena is about to remove it when suddenly Dorothy arrives, now an adult. He runs behind her from protection, and they flee together. The group camp outside a building, and when the Scarecrow comes out from there, he is shocked to find Zelena. She freezes Dorothy so she is no longer able to protect him, and rips out his brain.
