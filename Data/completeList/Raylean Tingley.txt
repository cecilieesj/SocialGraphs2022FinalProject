She is voiced by [[Michelle Horn]]<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Raylean/</ref> in the episode "[[Of Slain Kings on Checkered Fields]]".


==Background==
===Personality===
One notable trait that would best describe Raylean is her zealousness or fanaticism when it comes to her idolization of Checkmatey. She is also very obsessed with him. Additionally, she can be quite ecstatic and excitable.

===Physical Appearance===
Raylean is a caucasian teen girl. She has long, brown hair and brown eyes. She wears a shirt with varying shades of pink (a darker shade on the collar, a lighter shade under it and on the sides) and the front of it is white, jeans and black shoes.

==Of Slain Kings on Checkered Fields==
She launched a fan club devoted to Checkmatey and is its president, as mentioned in <ref>Of Slain Kings on Checkered Fields</ref>. As such, she is possibly his biggest fan and she constantly gives shout-outs to him when a concert is held at the school. When she is in the hallway trying to recruit new members, she sees [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] passing through and asks if they'd like to join. They decline due to being on duty. Later, when the two sleuths find a card with Checkmatey's name under a door to one of the dressing rooms, they spot someone wearing a hoodie and whose face is obscured by the hood in the hallway. They go after the hooded person, believing that person to be a suspect. While fleeing, the hooded person steals one Chess Club member's stilts and uses them to reach over the railing on the second level of the school in one room and continues to flee from there. Once Fillmore and Ingrid catch the suspect and remove the hood, it's revealed to be Raylean, who was the one who put the card under Checkmatey's dressing room door in an attempt to meet with him. After exhilaratingly telling Checkmatey she loves him, she is put out the door. She reappears after Checkmatey escapes Ingrid's home, which was being used as a safe house, and he returns to the auditorium to perform for a few kids there. Raylean is once again seen cheering him on fanatically.
