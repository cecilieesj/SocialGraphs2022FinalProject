==In the Show==
Jessica and Janice are identical twins from Great Britain. They speak <span style="font-weight:normal;line-height:1.5em;">a </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">quite </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">posh British accent, so some people don't understand exactly what they are saying. When one says something like "Oh that was good"</span><span style="font-weight:normal;line-height:1.5em;">,</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> the other says "No really good", and then "Yes, really really good"</span><span style="font-weight:normal;line-height:1.5em;">.</span>

[[Zack Martin|Zack]] really likes the two girls and often tries to impress them, even sometimes by dissing [[Cody Martin|Cody]]. However, much to Zack's dismay, the girls end up liking Cody more because of his sensitive personality.
