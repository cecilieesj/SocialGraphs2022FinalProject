'''Isabella Finch''' was a legendary explorer. She was the chief of Woodchuck Exploration and also one of the co-founders alongside [[Clinton Coot]]. She is also the grandmother of [[Bradford Buzzard]]. She was featured in pulp adventure books, called the "The Collected Adventures of Isabella Finch", during [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s childhood where she defeated the Fever Beast of Tibet and the Swiss Swarmy of Microbeesia. She once fought the Nandi Bear, a massive and ferocious bear with claws the size of a man. She owned the ancestor of the Tittertwill Bird of Knowledge.

== Role in the series ==
Isabella left a journal of information about her adventures, including the Missing Mysteries, which she could never find. The diary is found by [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his family, who set out to find these lost artifacts, before the members of the evil organization [[F.O.W.L.]] to find, because [[F.O.W.L.]] wants these lost artifacts for their own evil plans.

== Personality ==
Isabella was a daring individual with a thirst for adventure who went on dangerous expeditions to explore the unknown. She also wanted her grandson, [[Bradford Buzzard|Bradford]] to follow in her footsteps by dragging him alongside her on these quests, though this had the opposite effect on him.
