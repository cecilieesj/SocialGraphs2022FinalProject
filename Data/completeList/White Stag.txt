The '''White Stag''' is a character who appears in the [[2005]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Walden Media]] adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]].

==Background==
The White Stag is a mythical deer whose origins and whereabouts are unknown. According to Narnian legend, it is said that those who catch the White Stag would be granted wishes.

==Role in the film==
While the conversation about the sighting of the White Stag being spotted in Narnia as reported by [[Tumnus|Mr. Tumnus]] was not shown in the film, the White Stag appears during the end of the film where [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]], who were crowned as kings and queens of Narnia, ride on their horses across the Narnian forest of the Western Woods where they attempt to catch him. Throughout the chase, the Pevensies were unable to catch the Stag and unintentionally found their way back to Earth via wardrobe into [[Professor Digory Kirke]]'s mansion.

==Video game appearances==
===[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)|''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (video game)]]===
In the Game Boy Advance version, the White Stag appears during the end of the game where his sprite is actually a palette swap of the reindeer sprite rather than having a unique sprite. Like in the film and original story, the Pevensies were unable to catch the Stag, only to find themselves in the real world into Professor Digory Kirke's mansion.

==Trivia==
*In the Disney adaptation of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', the White Stag's face is never seen and the only scene where he appears is his back view.
*Aside from the White Stag, the white reindeer used by [[Jadis the White Witch|Jadis]] were the only other known breed of white deer said to have existed in the ''Narnia'' universe.
