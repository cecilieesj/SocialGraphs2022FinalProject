'''Sparky''' is the name given to the female caveperson taken in by [[Robbie Sinclair]] in the ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' episode "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_206:_Employee_of_the_Month Employee of the Month]." She was played by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Hanna_Cutrona?action=edit&redlink=1 Hanna Cutrona].

Rescued from the dissecting table at [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_LaBrea_High_School Bob LaBrea High School], Sparky becomes the Sinclair family's pet before eventually being returned to the wild.

As with [[Ling Ling and Chang Chang]], the dinosaurs are unable to distinguish genders amongst cavemen and assume that Sparky is male. Upon Sparky's release, Robbie and [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] are pleased to find that "he" has found a bearded "lady friend."{{MuppetsWiki}}{{Jim Henson's Dinosaurs}}
