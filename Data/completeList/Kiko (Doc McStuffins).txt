|quote = "Arigatou gozaimasu!"}}'''Kiko''' is an action figure from [[Japan]] that [[Dottie McStuffins|Doc]]Â was given by her grandmother, who had been there to visit some friends during "The New Girl".

As an action figure, Kiko was made to be very flexible and is known for her action kicks! But it is unknown if she was based on a character in a cartoon (or Anime, in Japan) or if she is simply a toy doll.

==Personality==
Kiko shows qualities one may find in a tomboy. As in, a girl who doesn't exactly act like a girl. She's very loud and loves to have fun! She seems to also be just a bit of a bragger, and keeps saying that because she's an action toy she's good at practically every challenge that may come to her. She isn't really modest and keeps pointing out her specialties to others, and she seems to like praise and showing off.

But at the same time, Kiko is not entirely senseless. She understands that she has limits and isn't that stubborn about it. Having easily admitted to her problem the moment she noticed it and eagerly accepted the advice Doc gave her.

It's possible she also happens to be smart, considering she is Japanese and speaks Japanese. But, she easily spoke English upon meeting the others for the very first time. Though it's also possible that any toy can speak any language.

==Appearance==
Kiko is a small action figure that vaguely resembles a Japanese girl. She has olive skin and big blue eyes, along with pink cheeks and peach colored lips. Which may or may not be makeup. Her hair is black and worn in a bob-cut with uneven bangs and a pair of yellow goggles worn on the top of her head.

Kiko's attire is very colorful and consists of a crimson dress with loose brown belt around her hips and a gold amulet bucket with a small dragon or snake depicted on it. As well as a brown vest with dark blue sleeves and lighter blue cuffs at her wrist. Her boots are dark blue and they match her sleeves.

==Trivia==
*Kiko's Voice Actress has voiced another Japanese girl previously, this being Ami from "Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi". She is also known as the voice of Jenny Wakeman from "My Life as a Teenage Robot", who is an action robot girl and also happens to be a mix of Kiko and Ami.
