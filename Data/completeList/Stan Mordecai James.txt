'''Stan Mordecai James''' is the James-Jenning family's pet dog and main protagonist of ''[[Dog With a Blog]]''. He also blogs and talks. He keeps his secret of doing so from [[Bennett James|Bennett]] and [[Ellen Jennings|Ellen]], and the only people who knows that he can are [[Avery Jennings|Avery]], [[Tyler James|Tyler]], and [[Chloe James|Chloe]]. He is voiced by [[Stephen Full]].

Stan is always there to help his friends and is closest to Avery who considers him her best friend.

Every night, when his family is asleep (which is the safest time he can), Stan enters in his adventures/misadventures, and his experiences (as well as those of his family) into his blog, much like a journal, while adding and editing pictures of himself, his family or friends, etc., while also adding his personal thoughts.

Stan often mentions past experiences (involving flashbacks), including some questionable or just plain ridiculous.

Originally, Stan didn't want to reveal he could talk, due to his talking leading to bad experiences with past owners, but he soon came to realize how much the kids cared for him after they found out, and they help protect his secret from their parents as they don't want people to take him away and be experimented on.

After a year of finding love, Stan finally falls in love with Princess (voiced by [[Ashley Tisdale]]), the poodle of his dreams, and eventually marries her.

==History==
===Early life===
Stan's past is a troubled (and confusing) one. He had three past owners, all who attempted to spread Stan's secret that he can talk. His first owner was a regular civilian male who was arrested by authorities when he tried to tell them his dog could talk, but they didn't believe him (in addition, Stan had his mouth full of peanut butter). His second owner was a mad scientist that attempted to experiment with him but Stan was able to break free upon realizing and fled with a poodle. Finally, there's Ian Calloway, another scientist who was good at hiding his true intentions from society and planned to reveal Stan's secret by finding out what makes him talk. In fact, he was very good at lying, he made up his own side of the story that he was raising Stan since he was a puppy and took good care of him until he ran away. It was then that Stan somehow managed to evade Ian much of his puppyhood and end up at the shelter where Bennett would adopt him.

===Life with the family===
In the James-Jennings House live three kids. Tyler, the only boy of the family and attracts the girls. Avery, the middle child and the smartest, and socially responsible girl of the family. And Chloe, the youngest and cutest red-headed little girl with a big imagination.

Before Stan became a part of the family, Bennett, the father and child psychologist, and Ellen, the humorous mother who doesn't really appreciate animals, were having trouble with having the kids live with a blended family. On a day they were all not getting along, Bennett surprised the kids with a special gift he hopes will help them get along better. And in the picture arrives Stan, a dog who was rescued at the shelter.

Stan was more than happy to be with the family, he couldn't get a grip of himself when he was starving of food in the kitchen. Only Avery and Tyler were present when there jaws dropped in awe as they saw Stan talk right in front of their very eyes. One hour later, they both question each other how can Stan talk?

Stan tells them his story that his previous owners attempted to exploit him because he could talk.

==Personality==
Stan is an energetic, wisecracking, humorous trouble-maker who loves his new family, and must keep his marvelous ability to speak a secret. Stan's canine point of view, whether in the home, in the yard or on his blog, helps the kids navigate both their new sibling situation and ultimately, becomes the tie that binds the family of six (Tyler, Avery, little sister Chloe, Mom, Dad and himself). Even though he talks and likes a lot of "human" things, Stan is still pure dog at heart. STAN is also helpful to his family even in circumstances that don't look like he would be involved. He chases his tail, barks at mailmen, ardently approaches poodles and is not so wild about cats. In some episodes he wants to be treated like a "human" and sometimes he only wants a real friend. Although the series hasn't progressed very far, it's clear to that Stan soon realizes that his own family are his true friends, and that he should trust them, even though he has not yet revealed to Ellen and Bennett that he can speak. He also likes poodles, and is somewhat a player among dogs.

==Physical appearance==
Stan is a 4-year old (28 in dog years) Border Collie mix, with a funny sense of humour, and has the ability to talk. He is a dog with white fur, brown and black spots, and his left ear pointing up while his right faces down.

He has two tattoos under his fur, one being a pink unicorn and the other, according to Stan, being too embarrassing to talk about.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Stan of the House]]", he had many previously mentioned owners who tried to tell the world Stan could talk. One of them attempted to do a science experiment on Stan to figure out what made him talk and become famous, while another was identified as insane since the public thinks that talking dogs are impossible and are fiction.
**In "[[Stan's Old Owner]]", its revealed that [[Ian Calloway|Doctor Ian Calloway]] is one of Stan's owners who attempted a science experiment on him.
*Stan said some first words to the characters.
**Stan's first words towards Avery and Tyler were "Give me the stinkin' food, I'm drooling a pool over here!"
**Stan's first words towards Chloe were "This is Awesome! And to celebrate, let's get snout deep in kibble."
**Stan's first words towards Grandma James were "Robert! I know what you're thinking, Robert is an odd name for an orange monkey."
**Stan's first words towards Karl were "Could you give me a second, I'm wondering if I should talk."
**Stan's first words towards Bennett and Ellen were "It's going to fall on you, get out of the way."
*A dog named Kuma played Stan in the first five production episodes before his owner quit the show because his owner didn't get along with one of the trainers named Steve, and also how Kuma was treated by Disney. A brand new dog named Mick was dyed brown and black to look the same and took his place in the sixth production episode.
*Kuma and Mick, the dogs who portray Stan, are natural blonds.
*Kuma has two nearly erect ears, the brown one is raised up but it bends down at the top. On his website it said Kuma weighs 45 lbs. Mick (the dog who replaced Kuma) has one ear that is completely flat (the brown one). Mick has a black nose, while Kuma's is brown and Mick is also bigger than Kuma. The greatest difference in the two dogs is training level! Kuma has been a celebrity dog for many years while this is Mick's first job ever.
*Stan's black ear is normally up, which could be a birth defect.
*Stan resembles a Border Collie, so he could be a mixed-breed. In "[[Dog with a Hog]]", Stan is an eighth terrier and a quarter cat. In "[[Dog Loses Girl]]", one eighth shepherd and one eighth bloodhound. In "[[Stan's Old Owner]]", he's also one eight boxer.
*In "[[Who's Training Who?]]", Stan breaks the fourth wall when he states he's part of the family for comic relief.
*Since Stan's grandmother on his mom's side is a cat and he doesn't like cats, Stan and his grandmother possibly didn't like each other.
*Stan loves to tell jokes as he used to be a stand-up comedian.
*Stan has his own blog. Avery, Tyler, and Chloe didn't know because he blogs while the family is sleeping until "[[The Kids Find Out Stan Blogs]]".
**In "[[Stan's Secret Is Out]]", Bennett and Ellen find out.
*In "[[World of Woofcraft]]", his online game name in Realm of the Tower is Poodlelover152.
*In "[[The Fast and the Furriest]]", Stan crashed the family car twice. Once by accident because he wanted to feel human and, again on purpose, to prove Tyler's innocence. He also thinks a dog license is the same as a driver's license.
*He didn't know that [[Max Edlstien|Max]]'s last name was Edlstien until Season 3.
*In "[[Stan Talks to Gran]]", Nora James (Tyler, Chloe, and Avery's grandmother and Bennett's mother) learns that Stan can talk.
*In "[[Stan Makes His Mark]]", the doctor said that he has another 9 years "63 dog years". Since he is 4 (28 in dog years), he might live to be 13 "91 dog years", but it could be longer for talking dogs.
*In "[[Karl Finds Out Stan's Secret]]", Karl knows Stan's secret too as he was spying on the family in the episode Nora knows.
*In "[[Avery Schools Tyler]]", Stan stated he has a Chicago accent with a "little surfer dud" mix in.
*In real life, dogs can't talk because they lack the mental ability to connect sounds with words.
