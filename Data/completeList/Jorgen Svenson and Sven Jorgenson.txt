'''Jorgen Svenson''' and '''Sven Jorgenson''' are minor characters who appear in the television series ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. They appeared in the episode "[[Hercules and the Twilight of the Gods]]". They were formerly heroic Vikings that died and become part of the Hall of the Slain Heroes of Valhalla. They hosted [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] in Valhalla and witnessed the events of the Ragnarok.
==Trivia==
*They were both voiced by actor [[William H. Macy]].
*As they are dead heroes that ascended to Valhalla with distinctive Minnesotan accents, they serve as a joke about the "Minnesota Vikings" football team.
*They seem to be brothers, their appearance are the same, but their supposed surname cancels out the hypothesis.
