'''Santa Claus''' is a traditional, secular figure of Christmas good cheer, who is the best known (at least in modern times) mascot of Christmas, developed in the [[United States]] as an amalgam of the story of St. Nicholas and various other seasonal folk heroes, with many aspects provided by the classic poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas".

==Background==
The Santa Claus myth is based largely on the Dutch holiday of "Sinterklaas" (a hastily pronounced "St. Nicholas", who comes down the chimney on the fifth/sixth of December) and the imagery of the Saint in question carried over to his [[North Pole]] incarnation. (Note that in several countries in Europe, Sinterklaas and Santa Claus are considered two entirely different characters, each with their own elaborate holiday).

It is unknown where Santa came from, but he is traditionally depicted as a festively overweight old man with a beard, who wears a red suit with white trim and a matching cap, black boots, and a black belt. Sometimes, he is seen with buttons on his shirt. He lives at the North Pole in a large workshop staffed by elves which produce toys year round, and every Christmas Eve he sets out in a flying sleigh pulled by eight reindeer (occasionally nine depending on how foggy the sky is, as he occasionally brings Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer along) and delivers toys and other gifts to the children of the world out of the improbably large sack he carries with him, entering their houses by the chimney, filling their stockings, partaking of whatever food and drink the family left out for him, then leaving how he came in.

As the most prominent figure associated with Christmas, Santa appears in many Christmas specials and movies, including several produced by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. His portrayal in them varies in many ways.

During the Christmas season, characters will occasionally dress as Santa at [[The Annex]] in [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

Santa is referenced in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]" by [[Drax the Destroyer]] as "a fat bearded man in a hoversled powered by underfed moombas".

In ''[[Dave the Barbarian]]'' they don't celebrate Christmas, they celebrate something called the Harvest Festival which has a Santa Claus-like figure known as the Harvest Hog.

For this "summer run", Santa did not require the full complement of reindeer to pull the sleigh.

In ''[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]'', Phineas and friends finish delivering gifts across [[Danville]] and find the sauna being used in the rest stop for Santa that Phineas and Ferb built atop the Flynn-Fletcher house. Santa chuckled, seemingly expecting for all of this to happen. He also reads Phineas' letter, saying all Phineas wished for was to be like him. Santa is also Phineas' greatest hero, delivering gifts to everyone in one night, something even he possibly couldn't do. He then takes Phineas' gift with him, thanks the kids for doing Danville for him then leaves. The next morning, Phineas and friends find gifts under their trees, all from Santa. Santa is a hero to Phineas as he is able to deliver toys to all the children around the world in one night. ("Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!")
