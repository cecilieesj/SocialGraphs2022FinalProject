{{Quote|"Wanna get rich playing video games?"|Spamley's catchphrase in advertisements.}}
'''Spamley''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2018]] animated feature film, ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''. He is a netizen residing in the [[Internet]] that works as a pop-up advertiser.

==Background==
J.P. Spamley is a living spam algorithm that acts akin to a salesman; he spends his days trying to promote easy ways to earn money by playing video games to net users. Spamley is not very successful in his field, however, as he is often either ignored or confronted by pop-up blockers; his abysmal living condition in comparison to more successful netizens like [[Yesss]] is a testament to this.

Spamley is often accompanied by his sidekick, [[Gord]], who uses his extendable arms to help promote Spamley's business.

===Personality===
While Spamley may seem obnoxious and shifty at first, he is actually a genuinely friendly netizen who is simply doing his job. He takes a keen interest in [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]] and [[Vanellope von Schweetz]] and wants to help them reach their goal of earning money so that they can get their ''[[Sugar Rush]]'' steering wheel on [[Ebay]]. Spamley further sympathizes with Ralph when he admits that he is afraid of losing Vanellope. While his actions are questionable, he is a nice and sometimes helpful person.

==Role in the film==
J.P. Spamley first appears as a pop-up promoting about how video games can get people rich. When Ralph and Vanellope meet him by the plaza at eBay, Spamley offers his help so the duo can choose a game. He then directs the two to his website called "Lootfindr" website which is a large truck. Inside, after taking care of a bug, Spamley calls his assistant Gord to help the duo where he hands out two Lootfindr pop-up ads to the two. Upon looking, Spamley tells him that the ads the two receive are not enough to buy the steering wheel in the eBay area. When Vanellope talks to him about the money garnered by playing the games shown on Spamley's ads and she asks him to know if he has an ad that gives out plenty of money for the steering wheel, Gord hands him an ad that is worth a lot of money for playing a game called "[[Slaughter Race]]" in which she agrees to find [[Shank]]'s car at ''[[Slaughter Race]]'', and Spamley lets her and Ralph go to that game and complete the mission.

After Ralph has paid for the ''[[Sugar Rush]]'' steering wheel at eBay, Spamley helps Ralph rescue Vanellope after she said she wanted to stay with Shank in ''Slaughter Race'', and [[Gord]] leads them to the Dark Net, where Spamley introduces Ralph to [[Double Dan]] and Little Dan, who power up an insecurity virus named ''Arthur'' to slow down ''Slaughter Race''. Spamley then tells Double Dan to not let the virus get out of ''Slaughter Race''.

After the Ralph virus clones dissolve, Ralph falls down to the ground, and Spamley and Gord drive up to save him, but he crashes through the car, due to his weight, so the [[Disney Princess]]es succeed in rescuing him instead. Much to Spamley's amusement, Ralph is put into a deep sleep until he is kissed by [[Prince Naveen]] (in his frog form).

==Trivia==
*Spamley's name is a portmanteau of the word "spam" and the name "Stanley".
*Even though [http://mariowiki.com/Mario Mario] did not make an appearance in the final version of ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'', a few [http://mariowiki.com/Question_Block ? Blocks] can be seen in the background, when Spamley takes Ralph and Vanellope to his Lootfindr website.
*A running gag in the film is when Spamley shouts "Gord!" and Gord constantly appears next to the other characters.
*Bill Hader was uncredited for his role as Spamley for some unknown reason.
