Tate first appeared in "[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]", where he tries to discipline his father, the local kook, by spraying water on him about upsetting on seeing [[Gobblewonker|the legendary Gobblewonker]] that attacked his boat but didn't believe him.

It was later revealed that he and Old Man McGucket do not have a close relationship and have drifted apart, causing his father to construct the robotic Gobblewonker to attract attention from him.
