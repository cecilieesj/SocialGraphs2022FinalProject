He is designed to use his tentacles to squeeze the life out of his victims.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''===
Experiment 489 was the 489th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to squeeze the life out of his victims with his tentacles. 489 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 489's pod landing on top of a buoy.

Later, a tidal wave splashed over the buoy, activating the experiment.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
At an unknown point after this, Experiment 489 was presumably captured, tamed, and named Huggo.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
All 624 experiments, including Huggo, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, Reuben, and Gantu arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

It is unknown whether or not Huggo participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Huggo is one of only two 4-series experiments that have their image, name, number, and function confirmed, the other being [[Mary (Lilo & Stitch)|Mary]]. Interestingly, both debuted in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]''.
*Huggo is one of the only known experiments with six limbs; in this case, they are tentacles. [[Splodyhead]] has six limbs: two arms and four hind tentacles and uses either four or all six for locomotion. [[Swapper]] also has six limbs, but only uses two or four for locomotion.
*Huggo and [[Thresher]] have very similar heads/faces. Perhaps they were created using some of the same DNA.
*Huggo, [[Clink]], and Thresher are the only known experiments with stalked eyes, a trait common in the invertebrates that all three are inspired by.
*Huggo and [[Yin]] are the only known experiments based on cephalopods. Though given Huggo and Thresher's uncanny resemblance, Thresher may also be cephalopod-like.
*In one scene, Huggo's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] was green, and in another, it was red.
**On a similar note, Huggo has appeared in different colors. In ''Stitch! The Movie'', he was red, but in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', he was blue.
*Huggo is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*He is also one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*With only one brief animated scene and no other appearances in [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|the franchise]] (apart from his image being used in ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'' and erroneously referred to as Experiment 144), Huggo most likely has the least amount of screen time out of all the fully confirmed experiments. (The aforementioned Mary has a briefer, less animated scene in ''Stitch! The Movie'', but she also appears animated in ''Leroy & Stitch''.)
