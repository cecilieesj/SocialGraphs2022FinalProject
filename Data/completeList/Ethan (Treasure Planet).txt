[[File:Ethan.png|thumb]]'''Ethan''' was a deleted character in ''[[Treasure Planet]]''. He was voiced by [[Jeremy Suarez]].

In his deleted scene he was admiring Jim's solar surfer, he had a scooter but it was busted. Jim had a look at it and was about to fix it when his father (also a dropped character) fixed it for him.

==Behind The Scenes==
* Several seconds of his scene was animated and colorized.
*[[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] state his scene was to demonstrate that while Jim has a rebellious side with adults, he has a softer side around children.
*Despite his scene being removed in the final film, Ethan and his father can still be seen attending the [[Benbow Inn]]'s reopening ceremony during the film's finale.
