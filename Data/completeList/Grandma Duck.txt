}}'''Elvira Coot''', nicknamed '''Grandma Duck''' (first name given as '''Elviry'''<ref>https://inducks.org/story.php?c=W+WDC+121-04</ref>, '''Elvira'''<ref>[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58127/2082411-l_us.jpg ''Donald Duck Family Tree'' (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #600, 1993)]</ref><ref>[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OiaLUD5pIP4/VjKOYrF7iFI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/TXAAbDykbZ8/s1600/grandpabeagle_027.jpg Excerpt from ''Nonna Papera e Nonno Bassotto la strana coppia'']</ref> or '''Abigail'''<ref>https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+CP++++5-06</ref><ref>https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+WDC+173-10P</ref>) is the grandmother of [[Fethry Duck]] and [[Gladstone Gander]] and the paternal grandmother of [[Donald Duck]], as well as the [[:Category:Duck Family|Duck family]] matriarch. In most stories, she is simply referred to as '''Grandma'''.
==Background==
Grandma is [[Humperdink Duck|Grandpa Duck]]'s wife and the mother of [[Quackmore Duck]] ([[Donald Duck]]'s father), [[Daphne Duck]] ([[Gladstone Gander]]'s mother), and [[The Duck Family#Eider Duck|Eider Duck]] ([[Fethry Duck]]'s father). According to ''[[The Invader of Fort Duckburg]]'', Grandma and her husband used to be nicknamed "Ma and Pa Duck". [[Walt Disney]] confirmed that [[Ludwig Von Drake]] was the brother of Donald's father, which would make him Grandma Duck's son, as well.<ref name="drake">{{Cite web|url = https://d23.com/did-you-know-8-genius-facts-about-ludwig-von-drake/|title = DID YOU KNOW? 8 GENIUS FACTS ABOUT LUDWIG VON DRAKE|date = September 22, 2016}}</ref> However, the ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]]'' episode "[[The Donald Duck Story]]" specified that the Drakes were the paternal side of Donald's family and the Ducks were the maternal side (with Donald taking his mother's name), and therefore confirmed that Grandma and Ludwig are unrelated to each other, and would make Grandma Donald's maternal grandmother. According to ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Ludwig's mother is an off-screen Austrian lady, voiced by [[April Winchell]].

According to her debut appearances in [[Bob Karp]] and [[Al Taliaferro]]'s Donald Duck newspaper comic strips, Grandma was an American pioneer and came west in a covered wagon.<ref>https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=YD+43-12-11</ref><ref>https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=YD+51-01-19</ref> The strips also portrayed her as having lived through the American Civil War, when some of the money she has been "saving for a rainy day for quite a spell" turns out to be confederate money.<ref>https://inducks.org/story.php?c=YD+43-10-06&search=Money%20Taliaferro%20GD</ref> A later strip also shows that her husband, Grandpa Duck, was a soldier who fought in the Civil War.<ref>https://inducks.org/story.php?c=YD+48-04-10</ref>

Grandma runs the [[Grandma Duck's Farm|Duck Family Farm]], which is the center of the family's annual holiday gatherings, with said gatherings usually arranged by her. These are always merry, warm, and interesting occasions. Grandma Duck is a great cook and is often praised for her sublime cooking skills.

She is depicted as driving a Detroit Electric automobile. She is extremely old-fashioned, being against many current trends. However, she did persuade herself to buy a television set after seeing other farmers use it. So far, however, she has only been shown watching farm reports, news, and weather updates. Another example of her old-fashioned ways was when she tried to usher out a vacuum cleaner salesman by saying she has done just fine cleaning with her broom. In this case, the salesman was actually a gunman who then holds Grandma hostage as well as Daisy Duck (who was visiting), and demands their purses and other possessions.
[[File:Elvira-0.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px]]
Grandma's first name "Elviry" (a rural pronunciation of "Elvira") was mentioned in an untitled [[1950]] comic (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #121) and later used by Don Rosa in his ''Duck Family Tree'' and ''[[The Invader of Fort Duckburg]]''. However, in an untitled [[1953]] comic by Frank McSavage and Carl Fallberg (published in ''Walt Disney's Christmas Parade'' (Dell) #5), as well as the [[1955]] comic story ''Ridin' the Rails'' (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #173-175) Grandma's first name was said to be "Abigail".

According to numerous European stories (including [[Marco Rota]]'s ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=I+HBP+++1-1 From Egg to Duck]'', created in honor of Donald's 50th anniversary in 1984), Grandma is [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s older sister. Occasionally they have also been portrayed as being cousins, a now rarely enforced tradition. According to the Donald Duck family tree [[Carl Barks]] sketched out for personal use in the 1950s, Scrooge is the brother of Elvira's daughter-in-law<ref>http://goofy313g.free.fr/calisota_online/trees/ducktrees/treebarks50s.JPG</ref>. For this relationship, there is no word in the English language.

Grandma Duck's parents made a brief appearance in Grandma's flashback in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #161 ([[1954]]). In Don Rosa's [[1993]] ''Duck Family Tree'', her parents' names are given as Clinton Coot and Gertrude Gadwall, while her grandfather was said to be [[Cornelius Coot]], the founder of [[Duckburg]] (introduced by Carl Barks in ''Statuesque Spendthrifts'', first published in [[1952]]'s ''Walt Disney's comics and Stories'' #138). She was also given a brother called Casey Coot on this tree.

==History==
[[File:Gramma Duck.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Grandma Duck in [[Carl Barks]]' ''You Can't Guess''.]]
Grandma Duck was introduced to the Disney comics by [[Al Taliaferro]] in the Donald Duck newspaper comic strips. She made her very first appearance in [[1940]], on a portrait in [[Donald's House|Donald's house]], behind which Donald tries to hide his money from burglars.

In [[1943]], Grandma Duck visits Donald and the nephews in person in a series of newspaper strips, and from then on became an occasionally recurring character in the strips. Taliaferro found inspiration for her in his own mother-in-law, Donnie M. Wheaton. Aside from newspaper gags, Grandma also got an increasingly more prominent role in other Donald Duck comics, where she could be seen living on her farm with Donald's country cousin [[Gus Goose]] as her farmhand. However, Gus is very lazy and does not work much. In some stories, especially older ones, [[Jaq and Gus]], the two mice from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', live at Grandma Duck's farm.

==Appearances==
===''[[Walt Disney anthology series]]''===
[[File:GrandmaDuck.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Grandma Duck in her first animated appearance, "This is Your Life, Donald Duck".]]
Grandma made her animated debut in the [[1960]] ''Wonderful World of Color'' episode "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (animation)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]", where she was voiced by [[June Foray]]. The episode depicted her great difficulty in raising Donald, a strong-willed and ill-tempered duckling from the moment he was hatched.

===Cameos===
Grandma also made a non-speaking cameo as a guest at Fezziwig's party in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' ([[1983]]), and a speaking cameo (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' ([[1987]]), reading the newspaper in her rocking chair, and looks notably more aged than her comic self. She has one line, praising Scrooge McDuck for donating an expensive trophy to a forthcoming soccer tournament. In the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[Horse Scents]]", Grandma can be seen very briefly among the spectators of the horse race, leaning on a cane.

==Video games==
Grandma Duck had a minor appearance in ''[[Donald Duck no Mahō no Bōshi]]'', in which her pet bird, Pippi, has escaped and was consequently captured by [[Pete]]. She offers to pay Donald to sneak into Pete's house to retrieve the bird, as one of the optional jobs Donald may take during the first portion of the game, and explains the controls for deactivating noisy objects so that Donald does not attract the attention of Pete's watchdog, [[Butch the Bulldog|Butch]].

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Grandma Duck's farm was the inspiration for a children's petting farm as part of Mickey's Starland at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in Walt Disney World, where Minnie Moo, a cow with a Mickey Mouse-shaped marking, was featured. Grandma also joined Donald at ''Donald's 50th Birthday Parade'' in [[1984]], one of Grandma's rare Disney Park appearances. [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s [[Toontown (Tokyo Disneyland)|Toontown]] has a baby care center themed as a daycare operated by Grandma.

==Trivia==
*In most comics, mainly the Italian, Grandma was said to be Scrooge’s older sister (which would make him Donald’s grand-uncle) as they seemed closer and have connection with each other. They also raised Donald together while he was an infant when he was orphaned, unaware they’re biologically related. In the [[1987]] Disney version of the board game ''Trivial Pursuit'' however, she was featured in the question: "Is [[Scrooge McDuck]] the son of Grandma Duck?" (the correct answer being no).
