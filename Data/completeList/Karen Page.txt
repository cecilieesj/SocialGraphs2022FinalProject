Karen Page first appears in her apartment, surrounded by police, with a knife in her hands over the bloodied body of her date. She is arrested and brought into custody. A new and financially struggling legal firm, Nelson and Murdock debate whether to take her case, considering the evidence against her was so certain, that it would be difficult to build a case in her defense. They agree, and she becomes their first case in court. Murdock agrees to protect Page by letting her stay at his apartment, and she is given a job at the firm.
