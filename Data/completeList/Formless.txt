'''The Formless '''are the army of the [[The Skeleton King]] and are the primary antagonists during the first season of the [[Jetix]] show, ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]''.

They do not speak or have any expressions, they're basically zombies made out of ooze that the Skeleton King commands at his will on his ship, the [[Citadel of Bone]]. On the ship, he keeps a tank of ooze that makes his army to which to send to [[Shuggazoom]] to attack it. The Formless are very stupid and not very powerful, but when a large group of them come together, they can make a giant formless monster to attack the city. When a formless is defeated, it will melt back into ooze. The formless areÂ usually seen riding on motorcycles into the city.
