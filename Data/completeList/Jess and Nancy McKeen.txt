'''Jess''' and '''Nancy''' '''McKeen''' are [[Kari McKeen]]'s parents, who appear in a deleted scene of ''[[Incredibles 2]]''.

==Development==
Jess and Nancy were originally planned to appear in a scene along with their daughter just after her memory was wiped by [[Rick Dicker]] after her prolonged exposure to [[Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]]'s powers and her constant phone messages that she left to the Parrs prompted Bob and Helen to visit her to get the full details about what happened with Jack-Jack. Jess has mentioned that Kari's been acting strange since the incident, which is proven true as she answers the Parrs questions with blissful denial.

Nancy appears to be the more lenient of the parents as she treats the Parrs more fairly while Jess is the more strict parent and mildly antagonizes the Parrs about Kari, though he  does have a empathetic side as he gave his condolences to what happened to the Parr's residence (which was blown up by [[Syndrome]]'s plane) before closing the door on them.

The scene was cut because the directors felt it wasn't necessary.
