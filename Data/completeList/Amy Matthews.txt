==Character Information==
Amy is the know-it-all mother of Eric, Cory, Morgan, and Joshua. She married Alan at the age of 20, and is still happily married. She is probably the calmest family member and always offers advice to her husband and children. She often has to have talks with Alan, due to the fact that he is very impulsive, and often says things he does not mean. She is generally a very understanding and nice person who only wants the best for her children. Throughout the series, it has become noticeable that she has a closer relationship with Cory and is firmer with Eric, while Alan is closer to Eric and is tougher on Cory.
