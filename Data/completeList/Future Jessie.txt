[[File:Jessie-future-008.jpg|thumb|left|264px]]In the episode, she warned her present-self about what was going on in the future; Bertram-bots were trying to taking over the world. However, it turned out that Jessie and the others were already stuck in the future; by meeting their doom from a cyborg version of Mrs. Kipling. After Future Jessie rescued them, the Bertram-bots then captured Future Jessie, they set out to the apartment building to rescue Future Jessie and take down the power source in order to defeat the Bertram-bots for good. In the kitchen, they found out that Bertram himself was responsible for the chaos. After the final battle, future Jessie bidded everyone farewell and told her present-self that Emma was the one that invented time-travel.

However, it was just a story told by Ravi on what would happen if Luke made purple paint explode on Bertrams kitchenwares. It is unknown whether the Jessie in the future was real or not.

==Trivia==
*The fact about how she came from 60 years in the future meant that Future Jessie might have been 79 years old.
