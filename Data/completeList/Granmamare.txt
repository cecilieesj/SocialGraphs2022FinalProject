Granmamare was slender, wears a cyan dress, has very long, flowing red hair and brown eyes, purple eye shadow, and red lipstick. She wears a long, billowing pale blue dress far longer than her body when she is under water. Her dress changes between long-sleeved and tank dress, and the length shortens to floor-length when she is on land.

She also wears a ruby magenta necklace with gold spacers, a similar circlet with a large red glass drop focal bead in the center, two 3-drop red sea glass earrings, and two golden bangles on her right arm. She can also change her size. She is seen changing from a giant sea goddess to a human-sized woman. Though she changes size, she still maintains her complexion and appearance.

==Film==
Granmamare passes Koichi and his sailors underneath their ship, and later, she greets [[Fujimoto]] in his vessel.

She narrated part of the movie that talked about [[Ponyo]] becoming human forever. She meets [[Lisa (Ponyo)|Lisa]] under the water along with the retirement home underneath a protective air bubble. Then she meets Lisa's son [[Sosuke]] when he has Ponyo in his bucket, and she starts to test if Sosuke accepts Ponyo to love her.
