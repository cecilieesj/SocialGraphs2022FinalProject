'''Brat''' is half wild boar, half dragon and [[Crocosaurus|Croc]]'s chief sidekick. He is voiced by [[Bill Scott]].

==Personality==
Brat sputters, babbles, and grunts in his speech, but Croc understands what he is saying. Like Croc, he is very lazy and has a strong dislike toward the Wuzzles coupled with a desire to have the best of what they have without applying any effort toward acquiring it. As his name implies, Brat is very bad-tempered and is often shown throwing tantrums when he does not get his own way. He is also greatly lacking in intelligence, and his incompetence often sees himself and Croc falling victim to their own devices, which in turn occasionally sees the two of them falling out.
