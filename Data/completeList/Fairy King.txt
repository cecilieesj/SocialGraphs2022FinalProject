==''[[Strange Magic (film)|Strange Magic]]''==
Some time after his eldest daughter and heir Marianne breaks off her engagement to her fiancé [[Roland]] after catching him kissing another fairy girl on their wedding, the King tries to get her to forgive Roland, but to no avail (although it is never shown or implied if he ever found out about him cheating on her). 

The King later comes to Marianne when she is training with her fairy servants. He talks to her about finding a boy as he doesn't want her to be alone, but she says that she needs no man and is strong on her own.

After his youngest daughter [[Dawn]] is captured by the [[Bog King]], the King grants Roland a small army to go to the Bog King's castle to rescue her.

The King later tells his guards how you shouldn’t judge someone by what they look like, only to contradict himself as he looks on in surprise and faints as Dawn kisses her best friend [[Sunny (Strange Magic)|Sunny]] after he admits his love for her.
