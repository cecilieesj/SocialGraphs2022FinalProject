She debuted in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_216:_Cleo_Laine episode 216] of ''The Muppet Show'', where she sat in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Theater the Muppet Theater] audience. Fozzie insinuated himself into all the acts that evening, but when he looked out into the audience at the end of the show, he found that his mother fell asleep.

She later joined her son in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_410:_Kenny_Rogers episode 410], where she danced as Mother Brown in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/UK_Spots_(The_Muppet_Show) UK Skit] "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Knees_Up_Mother_Brown Knees Up Mother Brown]." She's also mentioned in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_503:_Joan_Baez episode 503], standing off-stage (unseen) during Fozzie's comedy act.

Ma Bear later went on to play a key role in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/A_Muppet_Family_Christmas A Muppet Family Christmas]'' (which took place in her [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Grizzly_Farm farmhouse]) and was also prominent in ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]''. Her last appearance to date was portraying [[Fozzie Bear|Fozziewig's]] mother in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''. However, a picture of her and her son can be seen in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppets_from_Space Muppets from Space]''.

A younger version, known as [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mrs._Bear Mrs. Bear], was seen in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Kids_Books Muppet Kids books] ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie%27s_Last_Lap Fozzie's Last Lap]'' and ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie_Bear,_Star_Helper Fozzie Bear, Star Helper]''.

Her extended family includes her younger son, [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Freddie_Bear Freddie]; [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie%27s_Uncle her brother (or brother-in-law)] who left Fozzie his [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie%27s_Studebaker car] when he hibernated; her [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie%27s_Grandpa father (or father-in-law)], who played baseball with Fozzie; her [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozzie%27s_Cousin nephew], who watches Fozzie's comedy act; and her husband [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Bear Mr. Bear]. She is also good friends with [[Statler and Waldorf]], whom she invited to [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Grizzly_Farm her house] for Christmas and later invited them along when she went to [[Walt Disney World]] with Fozzie and his friends.

Ma Bear's influence is present in Fozzie's life, even when she's unseen. She taught her son to always wash his hands after using the bathroom, even when using [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Invisibility_spray invisibility spray]. In "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_Stocking_Stuffer_Smorgasbord The Muppets Stocking Stuffer Smorgasbord]," Fozzie reveals that the Christmas sweater he is wearing was knitted by his mom. She made sweaters for everyone in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/A_Muppets_Christmas:_Letters_to_Santa Letters to Santa]'' as a wrapped giftâ€”two of them are seen in the special itself as Christmas gifts for [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Claire Claire] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Claire%27s_Mom her mom].

Though she does not physically appear in [[Muppets Most Wanted]], she is mentioned in the end credits when her son [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie says]] "Movie's over, Ma. You can go home."
