== Background ==

=== Personality ===
Andy starts the series as a meek young man with a fondness for reading, calligraphy, and puzzles. Only knowing Ned through reading about his adventures, he ended up being selected as his grandfather's heir/successor in an effort to build up the "Lostmore Spirit" of adventure inside of him.

== Trivia ==

* Andy's surname is an homage to historic explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley, most famous for uttering the line, "Dr. Livingston, I presume" in his meeting with the more famous missionary David Livingstone.  This line is frequently homaged and satirized in [[Jungle Cruise]] media with Sir Stanley and Dr. Livingston even being mentioned by [[Albert Awol]] in the [[Magic Kingdom]]'s ride queue.
