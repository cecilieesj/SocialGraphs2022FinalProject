==Background==
===Personality===
Benny is a strange child. He is the youngest in his circle of friends (which include Cricket and [[Tilly Green]], [[Remy Remington]], [[Kiki (Big City Greens)|Kiki]], and [[Weezie]]). Despite this, he seems unusually well adjusted and has a pretty high vocabulary for his age. He can be pretty grim such as in "[[Swimming Fool]]" where he claimed that the last kid who jumped from the high dive had caused a "b[l]oodbath". Conversely, he acts like a typical 5 year old as he enjoys the ''Croblins'' film series and sometimes causes stress for his mother by acting like he does not know her.

===Appearance===
Benny is a tiny child, much smaller than Cricket or Remy. He has yellow skin and a small blue tuft of hair on his head. He has an oval shaped head and puffy cheeks. He typically wears a simple cyan colored shirt and red pants with black shoes.

==Trivia==
* Benny seems to have a speech impediment as his l's and r's are occasionally replaced with w's like [[wikipedia:Elmer Fudd|Elmer Fudd]].
*He somewhat resembles Stewie Griffin from ''Family Guy''.
*Benny is the only kid in Cricket and Tilly's social group to actually be voiced by a child actor, at least at the time of recording. [[Gabriella Espinosa]] comes close, though her voice actress is in her late teens, again at the time of recording.
