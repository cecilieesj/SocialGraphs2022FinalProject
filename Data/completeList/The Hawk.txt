===Avery's First Breakup===
Tyler accidentally crashed The Hawk's truck by removing the blocks from under the tires, not knowing what they were for. Left with nowhere to sleep, Tyler offered for him to come to the house, but his parents did not want him there, so he hid The Hawk from them by keeping him away at all costs.

He lives in the food truck, so he does not appear to have that great of a job, or a large amount of money.
