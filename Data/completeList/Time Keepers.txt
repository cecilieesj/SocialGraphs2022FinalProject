'''Time Keepers''' are characters from [[Marvel Comics]] that appear in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''. They are known for being the creators of the [[Time Variance Authority]] and dictators of the proper flow of time in the Multiverse. However, they are later revealed to be mindless androids that are being controlled by the real one behind the TVA, [[He Who Remains]]. 

==Background==
According to the TVA's propaganda, Time Keepers are all-knowing creatures that appeared a long time ago and ended the Multiversal War by reorganizing the Multiverse into the [[Sacred Timeline]], and then created the TVA and all its workers to help them protect it. 

However, the true ruler and creator of the TVA is [[He Who Remains]]. He is the one in control of the organization and created the Time Keepers, which are in reality androids, to be the organization's puppet rulers while he went to the [[Citadel at the End of Time]], and stayed there controlling and watching everything from behind the scenes.

With this, the members of the TVA are unaware that they are not creations of the Time Keepers, but are actually [[Variants]] that were kidnapped from their timelines and had their memories erased. Believing that these three figures are their true leaders, the people of the TVA follow the organization's ideology and the orders of the Time Keepers, even though most of them have never seen them in person. The original TVA also has statues of them at their headquarters as a homage to the founders of the organization.

[[File:Time Keepers protect the Sacred Timeline - Loki EP1.png|thumb|left|250px|The Time Keepers protecting the Sacred Timeline in the animated video narrated by Miss Minutes.]]

In the [[Glorious Purpose|first episode]], after [[Loki Laufeyson#Variant L1130|Loki]] is captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]], he watches an animated video narrated by [[Miss Minutes]] in which the Time Keepers appear. Miss Minutes explains that a long time ago there was a Multiversal War that almost destroyed everything, until the all-knowing Time Keepers appeared and brought peace to the Multiverse by reorganizing it into a single timeline, the [[Sacred Timeline]]. Since then, the Time Keepers protected and preserved the proper flow of time, and anyone or anything who deviates from the path they created are called [[Variants]]. These Variants create events that could branch off the timeline, leading to another Multiversal War. To avoid this, the Time Keepers created the TVA and all its workers to fix the mistakes on the Sacred Timeline. 

In the [[The Variant|second episode]], [[Mobius|Agent Mobius]] asks [[Ravonna Renslayer|Judge Ravonna Renslayer]] about the Time Keepers, stating that he never really met them. Ravonna tells him that the Time Keepers are monitoring every aspect of their current criminal case, which involves the hunt of the Loki Variant, [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]]. According to Ravonna, they never have been so involved with a case and really want the Variant to be caught.

In the [[The Nexus Event|fourth episode]], the Time Keepers are seen when Ravonna goes talk to them at their chambers. Ravonna is very anxious when she leaves their chambers and Mobius is waiting for her outside. He asks her what they said, Ravonna is uncomfortable and says that it is already jarring to talk to them, but now it is even worse. Ravonna states that they blame her after the Variant invaded their headquarters with the intent to get to the Time Keepers and then disappeared along with Loki, the Variant she gave Mobius permission to leverage. Later, after Loki and Sylvie are captured on [[Lamentis-1|Lamentis]], Ravonna tells Mobius that the Time Keepers want to personally oversee the pruning of the two Loki Variants and want him to be there. She also tells him that the case is finally solved and the Time Keepers are happy for this. However, Sylvie and Loki tell Mobius and [[Hunter B-15]] about all the TVA members being Variants who were kidnapped from their timelines and not creations of the Time Keepers.

Mobius learning the truth results in Ravonna ordering him to be pruned, before taking Loki and Sylvie to see the Time Keepers inside their chambers. There, Ravonna stays close to the pair holding a Time Twister connected to their Time Collars to prevent Sylvie and Loki from attack the Time Keepers. The Time Keepers ask Loki and Sylvie if they have anything to say before being killed. Loki replies that he has lost count of how many times he was killed and tells them to do their worst. They say that they are not intimidated by Loki's defiance, but Sylvie states the Time Keepers are scared of them. When the Time Keepers deny this order them to be deleted, Hunter B-15 appears and uses her [[TemPad]] to release Sylvie and Loki from their Time Collars.

[[File:Loki - 1x04 - The Nexus Event - Sylvie with the android's head.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sylvie and Loki discover that the Time Keepers are actually androids.]]

Ravonna tell the guards to protect the Time Kepeers, but Sylvie and Loki join forces and manage to defeat all of them. Then, one of them tells Sylvie that they should talk, but she refuses and beheads him. Sylvie prepares to attack the two remaining Time Keepers, but Loki looks at the head that fell near his feet and tells Sylvie to wait. The two remaining Time Keepers start to malfunction and then go limp. Upon inspecting the Time Keepers head Sylvie sees that it is just a mindless android and the other two are deactivated as soon as she beheaded the first one. This makes Sylvie frustrated that she did not kill the rulers of the TVA and Loki questions who really created the organization.

In the [[For All Time. Always.|final episode]] of the season, when Sylvie and Loki encounter [[He Who Remains]] at the [[Citadel at the End of Time]], he tells them that the Time Keepers are not really the creators of the TVA and also did not end the Multiversal War, as he was the one who actually ended the war after weaponizing [[Alioth]] and reorganizing the timelines. Later, when Sylvie sends Loki back to the TVA, he realizes that it is a new version of the organization because at the statue area, where is placed statues of the founders (the three Time Keepers in the original), there is a statue of [[Kang]] (who is a Variant of He Who Remains).
