==Background==
===Personality===
Mother Gorilla is caring and maternal. When she sees [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] in danger from [[Quint|Congo Quint]], she saves their lives and takes them in as her own. Despite her relatively gentle nature, she has a nasty temper, as seen when she attacks Quint and Timon and Pumbaa for having deceived her.

===Physical description===
Mother Gorilla is a large gorilla with a potbelly and a dark brown pelt. She has a tan face, chest, hands, and feet as well as blue eyes. She wears red lipstick, dangly golden earrings, and a pink, blue-spotted bikini top.

==Role in the series==
When Quint gets Timon and Pumbaa, she drops him away, saves Timon and Pumbaa and takes them home. A male gorilla knocks on the doors and asks her to marry him, and she accepts. While she goes get her wedding dress, the male gorilla goes to talk with Timon and Pumbaa, they act like babies, but the male gorilla reveals that he's actually Quint himself in a costume. Timon and Pumbaa get shocked when they see Quint unmasked, but they cannot escape from him. When Quint almost captures Timon and Pumbaa from Mother Gorilla, she gets back with her wedding dress and starts to talk with him about the wedding, mistaking with a real male gorilla. While Quint is still tricking Mother Gorilla pretending to be the male gorilla, Timon goes behind him and zips down the costume, showing his true face. Mother Gorilla gets angry and kicks Quint out from her home. 

Timon and Pumbaa think they are finally safe from Quint, but Pumbaa is not happy with the fact that they are tricking the Mother Gorilla and wants to tell her the truth, but Timon convinces him that they are safer that way and that "nice guys finish last." Later that day, three female gorillas knock on the door and the female gorilla opens it to them to see the "new babies". They cuddle them until the Mother Gorilla shows Timon and Pumbaa her surprise: three male baby gorillas that she brought to play with them.

Pumbaa is not comfortable with the idea and decides to tell the Mother Gorilla the truth. At the mention of "taking advantage of their maternal instincts for their own personal safety and comfort", she gets really anger and chases Timon and Pumbaa alongside her friends. She and her friends surround them, all of a sudden, a net falls down traps the gorillas and Quint appears with a gun. He points it to Timon and Pumbaa claiming that he finally got them and when he pulls the trigger, the gun takes a picture, revealing that Congo Quint is actually a wildlife photographer and the gun is actually a camera.

Quint claims that he's going to be iconic with that picture and that all magazines will want it in their cover. While Quint is going home, Mother Gorilla and her friends grab him from the net and starts to hit him on the ground.
