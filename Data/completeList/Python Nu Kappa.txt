===Official Description===
:''Pretty in pink, the sisters of Python Nu Kappa (PNK) are not to be underestimated. Led by their fearless queen bee Carrie, these ladies are smart, cold-hearted, and merciless. Covered in pink from head to toe, the PNKs sweet exterior quickly turns terrifying when the [[Scare Games]] begin.''

==Trivia==
*Their Greek abbreviation (PNK) is an obvious reference to their sorority color and style (pink). It is parodied from the Greek abbreviation "ΠΝΚ": Pi Nu Kappa.
*The PNK members resemble succubi, demonesses said to seduce mortal men.
*They all have three eyes, and the same hair, skirt, and legwarmers. The only differences are their colors.
*PNK was the third team to be eliminated in the [[Scare Games]], which happened during the Don't Scare the Teen event. During the event, three members scared a teen each, and the entire team got boxed in, making victory impossible.
*The PNK members and are the only sorority girls to actually speak in the [[Monsters University|film]]. All of the members of [[Slugma Slugma Kappa|EEK]] and [[Eta Hiss Hiss|HSS]], except Carla and Rosie, only say the sound effects their teams are named after.
*According to the ''Monsters University'' Essential Guide, all of the members of PNK want to work at a crematorium and have eyes that all light up in the dark, although one of them possesses fire-breathing.
*All PNK members that speak are voiced by [[Beth Behrs]].
