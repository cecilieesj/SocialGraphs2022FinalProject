==Role in the series==
Cinder makes her debut appearance in "[[The Royal Dragon]]". She first appears as an attendee of the annual Roast N' Toast with other dragons, including [[Crackle]] and [[Sizzle]]. She is impressed with Sizzle's talents. When Crackle claims that [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] is the Royal Dragon of [[Enchancia]], Cinder starts fawning over her and is impressed with her flying. During the flight, Sofia is revealed to actually be a human girl which reveals Crackle was lying about everything. Consequently, when Crackle tells the group about [[Sir Oliver]], Cinder doesn't believe her only to discover too late that Crackle is telling the truth. She gets saved by Sofia, Crackle, and Sizzle.
