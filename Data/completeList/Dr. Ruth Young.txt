In addition to being Jill's mother, Ruth was a primatologist who specialized in the study of gorillas, which was ultimately how her daughter met [[Mighty Joe Young (character)|Joe]].

She is later fatally wounded by [[Andrei Strasser]], who also murders Joe's mother. Before she dies, Ruth tells Jill to take care of Joe, to which Jill agrees. Years later hers and Joe's mother's murders would later be avenged when Joe tosses Strasser towards the electrical wires over an electric junction transformer that electrocutes him and thus putting an end to his poaching spree forever.
