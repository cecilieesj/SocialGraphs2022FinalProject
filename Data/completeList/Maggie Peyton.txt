'''Maggie Peyton''' is the protagonist of ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]''.

==Role in the film==
Maggie loves racing, but her overprotective widowed father, [[Ray Peyton, Sr.]], tries his best to keep her away from the life of racing because of a life threatening accident she had long ago.

The day after graduation, Ray Sr. brings her to Crazy Dave's junkyard to buy her a car. When [[Herbie]] sees her and her passion for racing he grew a liking towards, and after many attempts to gain her attention, she buys the little car.

During her first drive, she thinks about sending Herbie back because of his unexplained and embarrassing tricks on her, but after he helps her beat the NASCAR champion [[Trip Murphy]] in a road race, she changes her attitude toward him and they become friends.

She secretly enters Herbie in a drag race posing a masked race driver named Maxx. Unaware to them, the whole thing was set up so Trip could learn about the little car's secrets and get even. When Herbie sees Maggie take a joyride in Trip's NASCAR and say it was the best ride ever, he becomes quite jealous and deliberately loses their final race to Trip. Maggie reluctantly reveals her identity to public, and loses Herbie, who gets taken to a demolition derby.

Maggie manages to save him, and after her brother, Ray Jr., gets hurt during practice, he suggests Maggie should take his place, but Ray Sr. is still against it. However, they proceed to go ahead with it, and fix up Herbie for the race. Together, they take on the toughest tricks that the other drives throw at them and win.

Maggie and her closest friend, [[Kevin (Herbie: Fully Loaded)|Kevin]], later become a couple and share their first kiss.
