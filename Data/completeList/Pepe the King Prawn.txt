'''Pepe''' is a Muppet prawn who speaks with a Spanish accent and loves to flirt with beautiful women.

He was born as Pepino Rodrigo Serrano Gonzales in Málaga, [[Spain]]. After some time as a chef, he went to Hollywood to pursue an acting career. He is happy with being a king prawn and will be enraged when called a shrimp. He often ends his sentences with "okay?". In Hollywood, Pepe hopes to earn a number of Oscars.

At the start of his career with the Muppets, he appeared on ''Muppets Tonight'' as a sidekick to [[Seymour (The Muppets)|Seymour the Elephant]]. After ''Muppets Tonight'' ended, Pepe went on to become a permanent member of the group and one of its core characters. Since then, he has been in all following Muppet productions and is usually paired up with [[Gonzo]] and [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]].
