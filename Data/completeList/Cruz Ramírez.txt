==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Cruz may be on Jackson's side of the age gap, but she is on Lightning's side of the conflict. As a lifelong fan of McQueen, she is optimistic, sunny, fierce, and friendly — and now, she is his new, younger coach, coming to Lightning's aid with stars in her eyes when he shows up at the Rust-eze Racing Center.''<ref name="EntertainmentWeekly">{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cars-3-first-look/ |title=Cars 3 first look: Meet Pixar's new millennials |last=Snetiker |first=Mark |date=January 5, 2017 |website=Entertainment Weekly |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars 3]]''===
Initially, she is recruited by [[Lightning McQueen]] to help him train for the upcoming ''Florida 500'' and defeat the next-gen rookie racer [[Jackson Storm]], the main antagonist of Cars 3.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/30/sneak-peek-exclusive-cars-3-new-character-cruz-ramirez/84981778/|title=Sneak peek: 'Cars 3' zooms ahead with new character Cruz Ramirez|date=May 30, 2016|work=USA Today|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref>After a series of attempts which prove to be unsuccessful to train McQueen at the Rust-eze Racing Center, the two participate in a series of events including unwittingly entering and winning in demolition derby and training at Thomasville with [[Doc Hudson]]'s former mentor, [[Smokey]], she races in the Florida 500 herself as McQueen's replacement sporting his number, which she eventually wins jointly with McQueen. After the race, she politely turns down [[Sterling]]'s offer to join the race team, possibly in retaliation for underestimating her skills and joins [[Dinoco]]'s racing team sporting Doc Hudson's old number (51), with McQueen serving as her crew chief.

===''[[Miss Fritter's Racing Skoool]]''===
In the short, Cruz and McQueen celebrate her win at the Florida 500 and put her trophy next to the other trophy she earned at the Crazy Eight, only for both of them to see a commercial on the television featuring [[Miss Fritter]], talking about her racing school. The sound waves caused by Miss Fritter<nowiki>'s yelling at the end of the commercial knock over Cruz's Crazy Eight trophy and smash it to bits, much to Cruz's dismay just as McQueen tells her ''Maybe that wasn't such a safe place after all.''</nowiki>

===''[[Cars on the Road]]''===
In the ninth and final episode of the short-series, Cruz Ramirez is attending the wedding of her cousin Mateo who happens to be the groom of Mater's big sister [[Mato]], during the events of the episode between Mater and Mato, Cruz acts as the certified referee, certified family psychiatrist and a certified wedding officiant, Cruz's last appearance in the episode is when she wishes Mater and [[Lightning McQueen|McQueen]] well as they depart on their drive back to [[Radiator Springs]].

===Other appearances===
In the ''Stig vs Lightning McQueen'' short, Cruz, McQueen and [[Mater]], all in [[LEGO]] forms, travel to the ''Top Gear'' test track to race with the Stig. However, at the end of the race, a replica of the Leaning Tower of Pisa collapses on top of the Stig, and Cruz and McQueen can only watch as Mater unsuccessfully tries to get him back to his original shape.<ref>{{cite web|work=www.topgear.com|title=Watch: Lightning McQueen vs The Stig… in Lego!|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/movies/top-gear-tv-cars-3-lego-video|date=April 13, 2018|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Her face seems to look a little like [[Sally Carrera|Sally]], but her body is shaped like a Jaguar F-Type.
*Cruz's license plate is licensed in Texas and reads "C01 06A"--which includes Cristela Alonzo's initials, "CA", and birthday, [[January 6]].
*When Cruz tells the story about how she wanted to become a racer, and how she used to watch McQueen on TV fly through the air, this references the original Cars film where McQueen avoids a huge crash caused by Chick Hicks by jumping on Claude Scruggs' tires to get through the wreck.
