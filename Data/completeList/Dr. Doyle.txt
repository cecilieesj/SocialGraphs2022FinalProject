'''Dr. Doyle''' is a well known anthropologist who came to Africa to study the Waziri. At first, Professor Porter assumed she was a man, but when he saw that she was a woman, he was instantly smitten by her. So much so, that he went through great lengths to find a "fountain of youth" in order to become younger for her. In the end, the two formed a romantic relationship any way.

She later returned to Africa to spend time with the Professor, but that time, she brought her nephew, [[Ian]] with her.
