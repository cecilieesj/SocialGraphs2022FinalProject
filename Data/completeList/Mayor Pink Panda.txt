}}'''Mayor Pink Panda''' is the stuffed animal mayor of a village in Plush Toy World.
Mayor Pink Panda is a pink plush panda, including a heart-shaped light pink chest with a heart texture. She has dark blue googly eyes, and she wears a teal hat with a light pink flower attached.

==Personality==
Unlike the rest of the denizens of the Plush Toy World, Mayor Pink Panda isn't usually happy. She is a tad world-weary, though such wear and tear (as it were) likely comes from the stress of running a city. Regardless, she can be friendly when she wants to.
