|quote = }}The '''Zealots''' are a group of [[Marvel Comics]] characters who are sorcerers and followers of [[Kaecilius]]. They are united by the intention of bringing [[Dormammu]] to Earth. Curiously, out of over ten Zealots, [[Lucian|Lucian Aster]] (portrayed by [[Scott Adkins]]) is the only one to be identified, despite characters like "Blonde Zealot" (portrayed by Katrina Durden), "Brunette Zealot" (portrayed by Zara Pythian), "Tall Zealot" (portrayed by Alaa Safi), and "Nervous Zealot" (portrayed by Dean Ridge) being equally prominent characters.
