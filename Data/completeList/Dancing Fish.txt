==Leader==
Morgan is the leader, and has never been stanked with the other members. She doesn't like it when they cry over getting kicked off the stage in the talent show auditions during "[[So U Think U Can Stank]]", but she is proud of them on when they succeed, like in "[[Evil Spirit Week]]".

==Other Members==
*The girl with purple hair which covers one eye and a pink tank top. She is a yellow monster when she is stanked.
*The girl with reddish-brown hair with one pant leg rolled up and a green hat. Randy called her out as "Green Hat" in "[[Viva El Nomicon]]". She is a dark purple monster when she is stanked.
