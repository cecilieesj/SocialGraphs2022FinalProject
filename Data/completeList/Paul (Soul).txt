'''Paul''' is a minor antagonist in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]]'s [[2020]] animated feature film, ''[[Soul]]''. He is a bully to the film's protagonist, [[Joe Gardner]].

==Background==
Paul is a run-of-the-mill naysayer, always belittling others for their happiness and confidence. His favorite guy to spread doubt upon is [[Joe Gardner]], who has aspirations of playing in a band, to which Paul tries to bring him down, but luckily for Joe, he knows that Paul's insults are completely idle and he doesn't give them the time of day.

==Role in the film==
Paul is one of Dez's customers who goes to his barbershop where he hears [[Joe Gardner]] (being controlled by [[22]]) about [[Dorothea Williams]] to which Paul makes a rude comment about Joe while Dez tells him to ignore what he says to him. When Joe (controlled by 22) talks about having no style, Paul interrupts the conversation to which Joe continues talking to Dez. He then interrupts again upon hearing Joe talking about performing with Dorothea Williams to which Joe (controlled by 22) explains to [[Mr. Mittens]] (controlled by Joe) that Paul is criticizing to cover up his own failed dreams just before Joe leaves. He then appears again outside a mart shop where Joe gives him a lollipop. [[Terry]] then opens a portal for Joe to fall in only to find out that she caught Paul instead, sending Paul back to the real world just as he ends up being frightened by her upon looking at Terry on a bag of potato chips telling him to stay away from processed foods. He is not seen again after that.
