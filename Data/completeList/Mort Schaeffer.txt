'''Mort Schaeffer''' is a character featured in the Disney Channel animated series ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'' and voiced by [[Greg Cipes]]. As a student at Jefferson County Middle School and one of [[Milo Murphy|Milo's]] classmates who tends to be very spiritual, he is the fourth member of the band Just Getting Started.

==Personality==
As a very spiritual person who practices New Age beliefs, Mort knows the properties of rose quartz and talking about having a blocked chakra. In "[[Going the Extra Milo]]", it is possible he may be a vegetarian, as he wagered his "vegan cheese sticks" to see if Milo and Zack would make it to school on time. Unlike [[Bradley Nicholson]], he acts more civil around Milo and treats him like a friend. Even though Bradley's condescending attitude and lack of understanding or agreement with Mort's beliefs occasionally leads to friction, both seem to be friends.

==Appearance==
Much taller and stockier than the majority of the students, Mort has a long, rounded face with a prominent nose, light skin, and dark eyes. His brown hair is shaved at the sides and the back, leaving him with a thick mohawk. He wears a dark, navy blue T-shirt over a light gray long-sleeved shirt and pair of blue jeans with folded cuffs. His shoes are red sneakers with white soles and gray laces.

==Trivia==
*The outside of Mort's house has 17 wind chimes.
*Mort's football jersey number is 7.
*Mort collects [[Wikipedia:Quartz|rose quartz]].
