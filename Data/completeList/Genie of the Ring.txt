In an early concept of ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', there were going to be two genies like in the original story - [[Genie|the genie of the lamp]] and a genie of the ring. Not much is known about the genie of the ring. According to Streetrat.net, [[Jafar]] would have gotten his hands on the ring and used the genie against [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]]. It is assumed that the genie of the ring was also to be male. The genie of the ring character was ultimately replaced by a [[Magic Carpet|magic carpet]]. <br />
