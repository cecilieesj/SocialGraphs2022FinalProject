{{Template:Infobox character||rides = ''[[Country Bear Vacation Hoedown]]''||image = RandySkunk.jpg|name = Randy the Skunk|voice = [[Frank Welker]]}}'''Randy''' is a skunk who appears in the [[Country Bear Vacation Hoedown]]. He appears on top of [[Henry|Henry's]] hat at the end of the show, in place of Sammy. He loves to tap dance, much to the chagrin of Henry.

He keeps trying to break into the theater throughout the show and the bears can be heard off-stage running here and there from time to time, trying to get away from him. In the finale, once he manages to get on to the top of Henry's hat, he reveals that he only wanted to break into show-business with the bears.[[Category:Characters]]
