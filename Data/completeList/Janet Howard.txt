}}'''Janet Howard''' is [[Larry Howard|Larry]]'s wife in ''[[Flight of the Navigator]]''.

==Role in the film==
On the night of [[July 4]], [[1986]], Janet answers a knock on her front door and finds a [[David Freeman|12-year-old boy]] she has never seen before on the doorstep.

The boy asks where [[Helen Freeman|his mom]] was, but Janet tells him he must have the wrong house and asks if he's lost. He suddenly rushes past her and runs through the house, shouting desperately for his parents, and a concerned Janet follows him. He then runs upstairs and bursts into the study where Larry is listening to music, before reemerging, followed by Larry, and bursting into tears. Larry then tells Janet to call the police, who come to escort the distressed boy to the station.
