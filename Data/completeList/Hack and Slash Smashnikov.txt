==Trivia==
*Their choice of weapons are a play on their names; for instance, an axe typically "hacks" and daggers are known to "slash".
*Their last names, along with their accents, suggest that the two are of Russian descent.
*They are featured with the other villains in the show's [[DuckTales Theme|intro]].
