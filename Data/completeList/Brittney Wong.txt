'''Brittney Wong''' is a character in the [[Disney XD]] show ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''.Â She is a "mean girl" cheerleader who attends [[Echo Creek Academy]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Brittney is a stereotypical, vain, rich girl who apparently became head cheerleader only because her dad made a large donation to the school. She is shown to have a dislike for [[Star Butterfly|Star]], calling her a "pesky magical foreigner" from "Moo-ni", and cares more about herself than others. In a subversion of usual "mean girl" characters, Brittney does not actively antagonize Star, as she in fact wants as little to do with Star as humanly possible in order to ensure that Star does not upstage her.

===Physical appearance===
Brittney has black hair that reaches down to her waist, a light skin tone, and brown eyes. She dresses in a white and purple shirt with a purple skirt and purple shoes with white socks. Her cheerleading uniform is yellow with a white stripe, the initials E.C.A. (Echo Creek Academy) inside and red trim.

==Role in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]]==
Brittney first appeared in "[[Match Maker]]" before getting a bigger role in "[[School Spirit]]", where her personality and grasp on the school was put on full display. She immediately took a dislike towards [[Star Butterfly]] due to her massive personality that clashed with her more perfectionist ideals. In "[[Brittney's Party]]", it is revealed that due her wealth and status, she can be very controlling as her party bus was no fun until Star and [[Marco Diaz]] showed up; something she did not want to happen. Ironically, everyone begins having fun including [[Ludo]] who had come to destroy Star, but was distracted by the party as well. During this time, Brittney and Ludo bond over their shared hatred of Star, with Brittney going so far as to admit that she hopes he destroys her.

Since the first season, Brittney's role rapidly diminished over time, most likely due to the fact that the series began to move away from the high school setting in favor of the more fantastical scenarios. In "[[Mr. Candle Cares]]", Brittney apparently admits that she thinks her life has peaked in high school, though before Mr. Candle could offer advice, [[Tom Lucitor]] ends his charade of being a guidance counselor. She also gained some weight, via depression, in "[[Collateral Damage]]" after Star accidentally destroys a statue of the school mascot. She did attend Star's end of the school year party in "[[Starcrushed]]", most likely because she just wanted to party. Her final appearance was in "[[Cleaved]]"; being among the students to witness the strange portal opening in the sky.
