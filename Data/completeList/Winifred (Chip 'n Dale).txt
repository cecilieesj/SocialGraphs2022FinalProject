'''Winifred''' is a one-time character and the main villain of the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode, "''[[Good Times, Bat Times]]''".

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
She is a short and overweight lady with pale skin, green eyes and red hair, red eyebrows and a large nose. She wears a lavender, white-collared outfit with a white button and a white apron, an indigo jacket and a bandana with yellow stars and light blue moon-like shapes and dark lavender and white shoes with red circles on the sides.

==Role in the episode==
At first she was a cleaner in a library, where she acquired a liking for reading books about magic, but she was fired due to spending more time reading than cleaning and Winifred was forced to make her home in an old laundromat. Reading these books, however, made her understand the basics of magic which allowed her to talk with animals, enchant items, and create sparks of energy. However, these powers were incredibly weak compared to an actual witch, so to become a real witch, she had to make a spell which required several items with the help of some animals named [[Bud (Chip 'n Dale)|Bud]], [[Lou (Chip 'n Dale)|Lou]], and [[Foxglove]] that she had made her familiars.

With the help of her assistants, Winifred was able to get the first few ingredients for her spell. But while obtaining one of the items, Foxglove encountered the Rescue Rangers and fell in love with Dale, causing her to be torn between sides. When Winifred found out the Rangers had the last item she needed, she captured Dale and Foxglove (who had finally turned on her). However, the other Rangers arrived, defeated Bud and Lou, and ruined the spell.

Winifred was later arrested and is made a janitor at the prison.
