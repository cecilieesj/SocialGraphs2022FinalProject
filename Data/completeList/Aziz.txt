== Appearance and abilities ==
Aziz is a small and ugly man, later turned to a goblin-like creature who can use his breath for almost anything, including attack, create illusions of entire deserts, or even turning people into small slug-like beings. It is apparent in the episode "''[[Destiny on Fire]]''" that these powers come with a price, as throughout the episode, Aziz seems to have a short breath and eventually goes on fire.

==History==
===''[[Aladdin (TV series)]]''===
[[File:Char_17480.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Aziz; prior to his transformation]]Aziz first appears in the two part episode "''[[Seems Like Old Crimes]]''" as a part of a small traveling circus along with his friends [[Minos and Fatima|Fatima and Minos]]. They use the monkey [[Abu]] to pickpocket their audience, but eventually hire the young Aladdin to do this instead. When Aladdin objects to stripping innocent citizens of all their money, Minos brings him in on their plan to steal the fabled Destiny Stone. Aladdin, Minos, Fatima and Aziz go to the ruins where the Destiny Stone is kept. When the trio attempt to steal the Destiny Stone, they are instead trapped inside, while Aladdin and Abu escape. Many years later, the three of them escape. Aziz has become a goblin, Minos has become a minotaur and Fatima has become a harpy. With their new found powers, the three of them go on a crime spree in [[Agrabah]], eventually setting their eyes on conquering the city and getting revenge on Aladdin for causing them to be trapped for many years. They eventually return to the temple where the Destiny Stone was held, where after a brief conversation with [[Jasmine]], Minos and Fatima, who have mutual love for each other decide not to kill Aladdin, which causes Aziz to turn against them and attack them with his magic breath. The Destiny Stone thus turns Minos and Fatima back into humans, while Aziz prefers to keep his powers and escapes. Aziz is defeated in the episode "''[[Destiny on Fire]]''", where he uses his breath to transform all of Agrabah's people to slug-like creatures and take over the palace as well as bind Aladdin and [[Razoul]] together with a magic handcuff after noticing their own personal dislike towards the other; he even prevents the duo from rescuing [[Jasmine]] and [[The Sultan]], who are both bound and gagged. Eventually, Aladdin and Razoul noticed that overuse of Aziz's magic breath causes his body to ignite. When they have him try to destroy each other, Aziz eventually explodes and turns into three stars in the sky.

==Trivia==
*"Aziz" means "along with honor" in Arabic, which is ironic given his evil nature
