'''Mandrake the Malfeasant''' is a character from ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''.

==Background==
He is an elderly supervillain and one of the top ten villains in the galaxy according to the Galactic Villain Leaderboard with 15 planets under his rule. Despite his feeble and weak persona, he was once the most feared and powerful villain in the galaxy, as well as the arch-nemesis of the galaxy's former greatest heroine, Stella Starbella.

===Personality===
Mandrake acts like a senile old man, usually appearing quite forgetful and feeble, as well as sickly to the point where he may even appear as though he is gravely ill or dying. Despite this, he is still a very evil and competent villain who, while having fallen from the top spot in his old age, is still one of the most notorious villains in the galaxy.

==Relationships==
