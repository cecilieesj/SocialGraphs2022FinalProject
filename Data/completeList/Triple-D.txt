They are alongside their 96 other siblings in [[Delilah (101 Dalmatian Street)|Deliliah]] and [[Doug (101 Dalmatian Street)|Doug]]'s litter, and are a trio of over-the-top triplets referred to as Triple-D that are distinguished by their collars.

The three consist of '''Destiny''' (❤), '''Dallas''' (♦️), and '''Déjà Vu''' (⚫).

==Biography==
These fiery triplets can often be seen in commercials, magazines and on social media.

Destiny is the smartest of the three and is very concerned about what happens in the world.

Dallas loves getting dressed up and likes getting pampered. 

Déjà Vu is a real dreamer who follows her sisters everywhere.

==Role in the series==
Triple-D are a trio of identical-looking pups, outside of their collars. Because of this, they are all referred to by one name. They help Delilah and Doug bring in the house money by doing advertising campaigns.

They are said to have over-the-top personalities and seem very fond of glomping onto [[Dylan]], as shown in "[[Boom Night]]" and the opening titles.

The three also finish each other's sentences, as shown in "[[Dog's Best Friend (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dog's Best Friend]]", when they question whether [[Dizzy & Dee Dee]] could have found a "shinier" human after bringing one home.

In "[[Power to the Puppies]]", the three act as the news coverage for the snap election for top dog of the house. They are also the major voice for the other puppies after [[Diesel]] becomes top dog, informing [[Dolly (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dolly]] that the other pups shall not listen to her, since Diesel is top dog, and inform her on the new "Presidential Dig" that Diesel has made for himself.

In "[[Snow Day (101 Dalmatian Street)|Snow Day]]", they were among the puppies that Dylan and Dolly helped to get ready for the snow outside. In an overdramatic way, they expressed their displeasure of Dolly using their expensive puppy shampoo as oil for the sled. After [[Deepak]] got sprayed with the shampoo, making him quite slippery and bouncy, they commented how he was "gonna have such a glossy coat."

In "[[Perfect Match]]", they tell Dolly to fight for what's hers and have a laugh when Dolly attacks Dylan and [[Roxy]] with hose water, thinking they have become boyfriend and girlfriend.

In "[[Crushed Out]]", they were in charge of giving Dylan a gothic makeover, and later helping Dylan with his dinner date with Portia.

In "[[The Woof Factor]]", their occupation as advertising stars is revealed, and the adverts they are doing that day are so they can pay to repair the hole in the roof which [[Dawkins]] made by trying to create an indoor rocket-powered elevator. However, it turns out they got double-booked that day so Dylan, Dolly and Deepak acted as replacements for them.

In "[[My Fair Dolly]]", they gave Dolly a glamorous and fancy makeover so she could prove herself to beat [[Clarissa]] at a dog show competition.

The three are the stars of the short "[[Diva Pups]]", where they appear to be hosting a livestream of themselves. However, things get out of paw when the three begin competing for likes.

In "[[A Date with Destiny...Dallas and Déjà Vu]]", during shootings for viral videos, Dallas was targeted by [[Hunter De Vil]] for a fur sample to see if Triple-D were related to [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]].

In "[[The Dog House]]", they help Dolly and [[D.J.]] build a human.

==Trivia==
*In "[[The Woof Factor]]", it is revealed that Destiny will only eat "Probiotic Beauty" Kibble.
*Triple-D appear to be excellent stylists, judging by the makeovers they gave Dylan and Dolly, which includes changing the color and pattern on various places on their fur and changing Dylan's ears from rounded to pointy.
*According to "A Date With Destiny...Dallas & Deja Vu", Hunter De Vil confirms that Triple-D are related to Pongo and Perdita, meaning the three come from Delilah's side of the family despite their lack of English accents.
*It is implied that Dallas and Déjà Vu are not fully toilet-trained, Dallas says she's not limo-trained when Destiny comments that she smells a leak, and later Déjà Vu has shown to be flatulent on several occasions.
