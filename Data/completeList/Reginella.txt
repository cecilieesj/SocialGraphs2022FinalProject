They love each other, but their different responsibilities keep them apart.

==Background==
Donald is deep-sea diving when he is captured and taken prisoner by alien ducks who live in a bubble under the sea. Reginella understands that he will never be one of them and decides to send him back to the surface. Donald thinks that the experience was a dream, but then sees the medallion that Reginella gave him as a token of love. Donald then sadly throws it in the sea.

Reginella later finds the medallion thrown by Donald Duck, and all his feelings toward him return in her mind. Meanwhile her people's scientists tell her that her home planet is going near the earth for a limited period of time, so they could go back to home. Reginella urges the scientists to build a rocket so they can return home. The rocket is almost ready, but to finish it is needed an electronic piece easily available on the surce. So all the citizens of her civilization donate to her, a part of their future life to permit her to get to the surface. Reginella buys the partm but while she is crossing a park to return to her people she finds Donald Duck, their respective feeling suddenly emerge again and they escape in a chalet in the outskirts of Duckburg.

Meanwhile Pacificus is getting slowly away, so Reginella's people try to return home without their queen, but because this causes some discord between them the machines refuse to work, situation get starkest also because their protective bubble is crumbling for the proximity of Pacificus and start to fall. Reginella hears to the radio about some strange tellurics movement around the Silent Bay (where her people live) so, moved by sense of duties, write a farewell letters to Donald Duck and returns home with her people.
