The '''Buccaneer''', better known as '''Bucky''', is a supporting character in [[Disney Junior]]'s [[2011]]-[[2016]] television series ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''. Bucky is [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]]'s living pirate ship, a close friend and his main transportation.

==Background==
Bucky is a playful pirate ship that has a mind of his own. He communicates through the ringing of his bell and is fully understood by [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and the others. Most of his roles in the show are rather minor with a few exceptions in which he uses his features to assist Jake and his crew. Despite his often small roles, Jake, [[Izzy]], [[Cubby]], and [[Skully]] deem Bucky their greatest treasure. It is also revealed in the episode "[[Skybird Island is Falling!]]", that Bucky has the ability to form his sails into a hot air balloon to fly. In the episode "[[Undersea Bucky!]]", it was revealed that Bucky has the ability to transform into a submarine. 

==Appearances==
===''Jake and the Never Land Pirates''===
One of Bucky's most significant roles to date is the episode "[[Bucky Makes a Splash]]". Here, Bucky is stolen by [[Captain Hook]] who needs a new ship after his ship, the Jolly Roger was going to crash. Jake and his crew sneak on board Bucky to defeat Captain Hook, but instead, the Captain gets the upper hand, or rather, hook until Bucky washes them away with his water cannon.

Another episode that centered around Bucky was "[[Bucky's Anchor Aweigh!]]".Â Here, Jake, Izzy, Cubby, [[Marina]], and their friend Mr. Octopus planned on giving Bucky a golden anchor as a gift. However, Captain Hook and Mr. Smee swipe the anchor taking it back to [[The Jolly Roger]]. Enraged, Bucky sails off himself in top speed after the sip, leaving Jake and the crew behind. Hook manages to lose Bucky but the Never Land pirates manage to catch up to him using a small boat. Once on board Bucky, they travel to the Jolly Roger and take back the anchor.

In the special episode ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Jake Saves Bucky|Jake Saves Bucky]]'', Captain Hook forces Jake and his crew to race the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] for the ownership of Bucky. Naturally, Hook decided to cheat, and Bucky was then owned by the villainous pirate. Jake, Izzy, Cubby, and Skully call [[Peter Pan]] for help. They learn that if they can retrieve the golden bell, Bucky would be theirs once more and they will win the race. The crew set out to the Island of Bells and battled a fire-breathing [[The Dragon (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Dragon]] to obtain said bell. They head back to the Jolly Roger, retrieve Bucky, and all is well.

The Buccaneer makes his final stand in the Season 3 finale, ''[[Captain Jake and the Never Land Pirates: The Great Never Sea Conquest|The Great Never Sea Conquest]]''. When the evil shark [[Lord Fathom]] is freed from his prison and invades the Never Sea, Bucky and the rest of Jake's crew attempt to stop him. However, Fathom sends them packing through waves. Soon, Jake assembles a team of Pirate Captains to stop Lord Fathom. However, the second attempt ends in utter failure, with Bucky's sails being ripped and getting damaged in the fight. Throughout the second half of the episode, Bucky is absent, as Jake becomes an official pirate captain and resurrects the ancient battleship; The Mighty Colossus, and uses it to vanquish Lord Fathom and the [[Strake]]. Near the final scene, Bucky is shown being towed by the Colossus, with the pirates promising to fix him up and make him as good as new.
