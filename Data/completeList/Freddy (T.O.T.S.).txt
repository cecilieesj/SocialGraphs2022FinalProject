'''Freddy''' is a flamingo and one of the two main characters in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[T.O.T.S.]]''. He is a T.O.T.S. baby deliverer and [[Pip (T.O.T.S.)|Pip]]'s best friend and partner.

==Background==

===Personality===
Freddy really loves his job in T.O.T.S. and loves it more when comes to delivering babies. Freddy is silly, fun loving, and full of excitement. He does get confused about things easily. He can also be very encouraging and kind to others. 

Freddy is the more caring partner of Team Pip and Freddy. He enjoys playing with the babies and taking care of them. 

Because of this, he sometimes notices things other fliers miss. An example, when everyone was delivering bunnies and his and Pip's bunnies got mixed up with JP's, he figured out who was who based on traits he noticed while playing with them.

===Appearance===
Freddy is a tall, coral pink flamingo with dark yellow eyes and purple parts of the feathers of his wings. He has a golden yellow beak with the tip being black. Freddy wears the T.O.T.S. uniform, which consists of a blue buttoned shirt with the insignia of T.O.T.S., white buttons and a collar with the same colors of the shirt, and navy blue details in the sleeves, accompanying a light blue cap with the insignia of T.O.T.S.. He wears high navy blue sneakers. When he goes to sleep, he wears yellow pajamas and a nightcap, patterned with pineapples. For Halloween, he dressed up as a palm tree.

When he was a baby, Freddy wore a white diaper with a blue trim and a blue collar. He also had on a blue bonnet and blue booties with white toes.
