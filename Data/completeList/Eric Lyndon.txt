==History==
Eric is convinced by Uriah to join the Dunnsters, as he is good at playing the saxophone. Hay Lin thinks that he has a musical name, and gets very nervous when he's around. The result of this is that she once accidentally turned invisible and made her bike float in mid air. Eric saw both these things, but seemed to think they were illusion. Eric has shiny black hair and dark eyes.
==Story==
A new boy in town, Eric lives at the Heatherfield Observatory with his grandfather, Zachary Lyndon, who is an astronomer. He is crazy about science and technology and his brain is bursting with imagination. He owns an electric scooter and loves to play basketball with Nigel and the other boys. His mother and father are named Louise and Charles. Hay Lin met them when she spilled soup on them in Silver Dragon restaurant. Louise and Charles travel to an island in the middle of the ocean. Hay Lin and Eric met when she was roller-blading and ran into his motor scooter.

Eric soon moves to Open Hill and develops a long-distance relationship with Hay Lin.
==In the animated series==
Hay Lin sees Eric while making a delivery, well, it's love at first sight! When she first sees him her bike starts flying and she can't get it down! A bus comes and once she finally gets down, her crush is gone, which could be a good thing considering she's covered in Chinese food. Nearing the end of the 2nd season Nerissa nearly kills Eric by having him hang from a fake sun in the new shopping mall. The guardians and Matthew rescue him and defeat Nerrisa.  Eric awakens to see the mall lobby in shambles. Hay Lin then kisses him when he makes a compliment on her braces.
