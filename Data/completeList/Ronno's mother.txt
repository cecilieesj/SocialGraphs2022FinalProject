'''Ronno's mother''' is a very minor character in ''[[Bambi II]]''. She is only seen when she calls [[Ronno]] after he made fun of young Prince [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]], makes her son scold her for embarrassing him, when he is trying to make new friends to whom he apologizes. She is mentioned when Ronno calls her while on the run from the [[Hunter Dogs|man's dogs]]. The last time she is mentioned, it is near the end of the movie that Ronno calls her out when he is bitten on the nose by a turtle.
