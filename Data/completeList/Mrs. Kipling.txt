'''Mrs. Kipling''' is [[Ravi Ross]]' pet Monitor Lizard who appears in the series ''[[Jessie (TV series)|Jessie]]''.

==Description==
Mrs. Kipling is a seven-foot long monitor lizard that Ravi had brought from [[India]] when he immigrated to the [[United States]].

In the episode "[[The Secret Life of Mr. Kipling]]", it is revealed that Kipling is actually a female monitor lizard and has laid twelve eggs. The names of Mrs. Kipling's twelve babies are Mowgli, Sanjay, Gupta, Slumdog, Kumar, Ravi Jr., Scooter, Rikki, Tikki, Tavi, Mohandas, and Padma.

Mrs. Kipling also appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "[[Halloween Night at the Museum]]", in which [[Morgan le Fay]] turns her into a dragon after Morgan attempts to steal the sword Excalibur after Jessie Prescott accidentally frees her from her imprisonment. Chasing after Ravi and his siblings, Ravi appeals to her better nature mid-chase and Mrs. Kipling refuses to hurt her owner and friend. Having regained control of Mrs. Kipling, Ravi uses her to help Jessie defeat and imprison Morgan le Fay once more. She reverts to being a monitor lizard again afterwards.

==Trivia==
*Mrs. Kipling is named for Rudyard Kipling, the author of ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' and many short stories. 
*Mrs. Kipling is portrayed by a male Asian water monitor named Frank.
*Mrs. Kipling is an Asian water monitor, one of the largest monitor lizards in the world. Like in the show, these very intelligent lizards can be kept as pets and can become extremely tame with constant handling, but are best handled and cared for by experienced handlers due to their large size and great strength, space and habitat requirements, sharp talons, whip-like tail, and powerful jaws filled with sharp teeth and venom.
*Along with [[Joanna the Goanna]], [[Kenge]], and [[Ora]], Mrs. Kipling is one of the very few monitor lizards to appear thus far as a Disney character.
