'''Kevin''' (A.K.A. '''Kilgore''') is a boy, about Avery's age, who plays Realm of the Tower with "Poodlelover152" (Stan).

==History==
In "[[World of Woofcraft]]", [[Avery Jennings|Avery]] enacts "Poodlelover152" for [[Stan Mordecai James|Stan]] during the Realm of The Tower gameplayers gathering, where Avery realizes Kevin isn't just a game nerd and starts to connect with him. However, during a prolonged final battle, Avery and Stan fight over him, and he kills Poodlelover152. Stan and Avery annihilate him afterwards.

Kevin likes art, and his personality is somewhat similar to Avery (high tempered, creative, sometimes takes extreme measures). His first and only appearance was "World of Woofcraft".
