'''Mrs. Boonchuy''' is a supporting character in the [[2019]] series ''[[Amphibia]]''. She is the mother of the protagonist, [[Anne Boonchuy]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Most of Mrs. Boonchuy's personality is only referred to by her daughter, [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], throughout the series. What is known about her is that she is very strict and is a very disciplined woman. When Anne was an infant, it was heavily implied that she would get aggravated by her daughter's "high-spirited" personality and would look for things for her to do so that she could have some peace and quiet. By the time Anne became a teenager, Mrs. Boonchuy seems to have gotten over her daughter's wild side and was more calm about it. She is very protective of her to the point that she would not let her try genuine Thai food; claiming that her "California stomach" was incapable of handling the rich flavor. It is possible that she is out of touch with modern American culture as Anne had a tendency to mock her strange old fashioned tastes.

===Physical appearance===
Mrs. Boonchuy resembles an older Anne. Much like her, she is a tall slender woman of Thai descent and bronze skin. When Anne was young, her hair was done in a shoulder length messy style, almost like Anne's hair in the series, but flatter. She at some point grew it out and put her hair up in a pony tail with a knot featuring a small butterfly on it. To indicate her age, she has crow's feet around her eyes.

Her main wardeobe is a purple blue sweater, a pair of light color jeans, and a pair of greenish yellow earrings. At home she walks around barefoot, and while out she wears a pair of pink crocs.

For the most part, she wears her gold wedding ring.

==Role in the Series==
===Before===
Mrs. Boonchuy was born in Bangkok, Thailand where she met and fell in love with Mr. Boonchuy, the two married and moved to Los Angeles, California in the United States. The couple had a daughter named Anne and later owned a cat named Domino. She and her husband own a restaurant called Thai Go. On the day of Anne's 13th birthday, Anne was missing along with her friends: [[Sasha Waybright]] and [[Marcy Wu]]. 

===Season 3===
Five months after Anne went missing, Mrs. B was cooking until she heard a knock at the door, she went to go open it and to her surprised it was Anne who finally came home only to bring home some company. Anne introduce the Plantars: [[Sprig Plantar]], [[Polly Plantar]], and [[Hop Pop Plantar]] to her and her husband. Anne explains to her parents that she, Sasha, and Marcy were transported to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] a world full of amphibians by [[Calamity Box|a mysterious music box]]. Anne told her and her husband that they were at the third Temple charging the third gem until a portal appear which sent Anne and the Plantars to Earth. Though Mrs. B suggested sending the Plantars to the Government, but Mrs. B and her husband decided to let them stay for a while.
