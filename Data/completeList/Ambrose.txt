'''Ambrose '''is from the [[Silly Symphony]], ''[[The Robber Kitten]]''. He also makes a cameo alongside [[Dirty Bill]] in ''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Robber Kitten]]''===
Ambrose is his mother’s only child and he lives only with her, due to his father’s previous death (someone threw a boot at him). Maybe his father absence made Ambrose dislike being correct and honest, because the kitten only thinks about being a robber some day and hates obeying his mother, who wants him to go to school and have a nice future.

One day, his mother asks him to have a bath, but he doesn’t listen to her and decides to runn away from home in order to become a criminal. In the woods next to his house, Ambrose meets the evil bandit known as Dirty Bill and tries to rob him, but gets surprised to find out who he really is and reveals himself to be Bill’s fan. Then, the villain invites Ambrose to make a criminal duo with him and the kitten happily accepts, telling Bill a false story that he robbed an entire diligence by himself. Attempting to get the supposedly stolen money, Dirty Bill tries to kill Ambrose to steal his bag, imagining that the money is there. When Ambrose notices that he’s in trouble, he gets scared and desperate and gives up being a criminal and runs back home, leaving a bag full of cookies to Bill, who is very confused to find that there wasn’t any money in the bag. 

Later, Ambrose regrets his stupid decision, has his bath and promises to obey his mom from then on.

===''[[Mickey's Polo Team]]''===
Ambrose is seen alongside Dirty Bill, cheering in the crowd, amongst the other Silly Symphonies characters. It is unknown if Ambrose is back to his life of crime or if they’re only friends. 

==Trivia==
*Ambrose is similar to the fairytale character ''Puss in Boots''.
