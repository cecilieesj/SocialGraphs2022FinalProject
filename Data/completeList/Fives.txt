Fives made his debut in the episode "Rookies". He could be seen in the Rishi Outpost with his squad called Domino Squad protecting it to make sure it will not fall into the hands of the Separatist, but fails after the Separatists killed half of the members from Domino Squad and overwhelming the base. Soon, Captain Rex invites him and Echo, the remaining members of Domino Squad to join the 501st Legion after their service on Rishi Moon. 

After that, Fives participated in the Battle of Kamino where he and Echo were promoted to ARC Troopers after the battle. Fives also participated in multiple battles such as Battle of Lola Sayu, Battle of Umbara and Battle of Ringo Vinda. After his friend, clone trooper Tup murdered [[Jedi]] general Tiplar, Fives starts his investigation on the inhibitor chips (chips that were in every single clone's mind). He would be soon framed by [[Palpatine]] for attempting to murder him. He found his friend Kix and instructs him to tell [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Rex (Star Wars)|Captain Rex]] to meet him which they did. Fives traps Anakin and Rex in a ray shield, fearing they will not listen to his story. Halfway through his story, Palpatine sent Commander Fox and a bunch of Shock Troopers to his location to arrest him, Fives takes Rex's blaster attempting to shoot Fox but Fox shoots him in the heart before Fives could do anything to stop them. Fives soon dies in Rex's hand after saying all he wanted was to do his duty. He would later appear in the episode "The Bad Batch" and "Unfinished Business" as a picture with him, Echo, Rex and Cody.

==Trivia==
*His appearance in a picture was exclusively added to the episode "The Bad Batch" and "Unfinished Business" in Season 7 of [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]].
*"Fugitive" is the only Clone Wars episode where Rex is not present with Fives, excluding "Clone Cadets" in flashbacks.
*Fives is neither seen nor mentioned at all in Season 2 or 5 in ''The Clone Wars''.
