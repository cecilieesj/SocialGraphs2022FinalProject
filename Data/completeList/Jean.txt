|quote="I have to know this stuff if I wanna be a famous scientist someday."||birthday = |alignment = Good}}'''Jean''' is [[Captain Crandall]]'s sister in the show ''[[Teamo Supremo]]''. Crandall and his teammates often turn to her for advice on how to defeat the current villain if they are having trouble doing so. She is always able to give them some sound advice, which she says that she has to know if she wants to have an occupation some day (said occupation is always different each time she uses the phrase).
