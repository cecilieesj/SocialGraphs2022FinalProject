'''Earl''' is the owner of Earl's Auto, a car lot, from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] 1992-1993 animated series, ''[[Goof Troop]].''
==Background==
He is [[Pete|Pete's]] rival who gets on his nerves various times throughout the series. He also convinces him to participate in a race.

===Personality===
Earl seems to enjoy picking on his rivals, as evidenced by his interactions with [[Pete]] in the episode "[[Rally Round the Goof]]". He is very arrogant; however, he appears to have a good business-sense, as someone ironically asked Pete for directions to Earl's car lot, indicating that Earl may offer better service than Pete.

===Physical appearance===
Earl is a heavy-set anthropomorphic cat with dark brown fur. He wears a blue jacket, a white collared shirt, and a red-and-orange striped tie.

===Role in the series===
He is mostly mentioned by name, rather than seen. [[Pete]] and a man mention him in the episode "[[Inspector Goofy]]", with his first and only physical appearance being in the episode "[[Rally Round the Goof]]". He gets Pete to compete against him in a race, but loses. 

He is mentioned once again in the episode "[[Goof Fellas]]".

==Trivia==
*Another character by the name Earl Yokel makes an appearance in the episode "[[Major Goof]]". He is also the owner of a car lot; however, his physical appearance differs from that of Earl. It is unknown if he is the same character redesigned, or a completely different person.
