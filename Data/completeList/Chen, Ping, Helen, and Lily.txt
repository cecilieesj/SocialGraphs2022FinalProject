===Powers and abilities===
All four aunts have the ability to transform into red pandas, but only when their respective jewelry pieces are destroyed. Unlike Ming, they and Grandma are more emotionally stable in their panda forms and channel positive energy when they're seen this way.

==Trivia==
*Lily is Mia Tagano's first feature film role.
**This is the second character in the film to have an actress' first film role, following Mei's voice actor, Rosalie Chiang.
*There was some initial confusion over Helen's place in the family line.
*All of the aunts are adorned in varying green jade colors. Ping's is the most prominent as she is, most likely, the oldest of the group while Lily's has a more faded color scheme as she is the youngest.
*Due to Chen and Ping being Ming's sisters, it is possible Ming is younger than them, but it is unknown if Chen or Ping is older.
*Lily is actually Mei's cousin, but due to their age difference (Lily being in her 20s and Mei 13) it is understandable for Lily to be more of an aunt-figure to Mei than a cousin since they are not peers.
*Ping bears a striking resemblance to the late Hong Kong actress, Lydia Shum.
