He is designed to turn entire civilizations into harmless insects. Those turned into bugs can understand all other insects and arachnids; only Jumba's technology can reverse the process. His one true place is on a farm, protecting farmers' crops by turning rocks into aphid-eating ladybugs.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Bugby is a light-green mosquito-like experiment with four purple eyes, four wings, and six teal legs.

===Powers and abilities===
Bugby can fire a purple laser from his stinger that causes any people hit to turn into bugs and any giant insects hit to revert to the normal size of bugs. Anyone turned into a bug can communicate with all other insects and arachnids. His ray can also, if reprogrammed, turn inanimate objects into bugs instead of people.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 128 was the 128th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel's]] funding. He was designed to turn people into harmless insects. 128 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 128's pod landing in the middle of a farm crop.

When the crop was being irrigated via sprinklers, 128's pod was sprinkled, activating the experiment. 128 then took flight and traversed the island of Kauai aimlessly.

After a while, 128 was attacked by an eagle but defeated it by turning it into a dragonfly. 128 then fluttered off laughing but accidentally flew into [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s jar. Unaware that 128 was actually an experiment, Lilo named him Bugby and took him [[Lilo's House|home]], where she placed Bugby in her makeshift bug city, Bugopolis.

When [[Stitch]] grabbed Bugby and attempted to eat him, the latter turned Stitch into an ant in self-defense.

Later, when Lilo noticed Bugby loose in her bedroom outside of Bugopolis and went to check on the other bugs, Bugby turned Lilo into a ladybug.

Shortly after, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] went up to Lilo's room to bring her gravel muffins (which Jumba deemed inedible), and the two discovered Bugby, which actually intrigued Pleakley. When Jumba then tried to warn Pleakley about Bugby, the latter turned Jumba into a stink bug and Pleakley into a praying mantis.

The four later befriended a [[Chaps, Manny, and Sperk|dung beetle, spider, and caterpillar]], though the trio believed Stitch was evil since he ate insects like them. However, when the three real bugs were in danger of insect-hating [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and the exterminator, Stitch rescued them and eventually had a change of heart about eating bugs.

After a few setbacks, including a tussle with an aggressive wild cat, the gang used a special machine on [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]] to revert to normal (and enlarge the three real bugs to human size). When the exterminator showed up, thinking the vermin crawled into here, the leader of the giant bugs told the exterminator off, scaring him away.

Bugby then attacked, reverting the giant insects to their original size. However, Lilo and Stitch were able to recapture Bugby in Lilo's jar before he could turn her, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley back into bugs.

Shortly after, Jumba reprogrammed Bugby to turn inanimate objects into bugs instead of people. The latter then found his one true place on the same farm where he was first activated and turned assorted rocks into aphid-eating ladybugs, thus helping farmers protect their crops from unwanted pests.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Bugby, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Bugby participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] probably by turning attacking Leroys into insects.

However, the Leroy clones soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.
