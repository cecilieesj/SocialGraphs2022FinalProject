'''Anda and Kata''' are two female moose, or moosettes,Â in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2006]] animated feature film, ''[[Brother Bear 2]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Brother Bear 2]]''===
Anda is slightly slow but interested in finding a mate who suits her best interests. She is a lighter brown than Kata, and at the end of the movie, Anda becomes Rutt's mate while Kata is Tuke's mate.

At first, they are not interested in Rutt and Tuke and ridicule their foolish attempts to attract them, most notably when Kenai pretends to be a "big, hungry, scary, bear". Rutt and Tuke even end up getting a female buffalo after them thinking it to be a moosette.

Anda and Kata are not interested in Rutt and Tuke until Koda runs to them, saying he's playing with his friends, and Rutt and Tuke ask them where he is. Finding this adorable, the moosettes are a bit more attracted to the moose, but when Rutt bellows out awkward poetry, the moosettes quickly settle for Tuke, but after seeing Rutt's sensitivity, settle for him. But, eventually, Anda mates with Rutt while Kata gets Tuke.

== Trivia ==

* Despite the moosettes each having official names as shown in the end credits, none of them are addressed by one another or any of the other characters in the film by name, the latter simply referring to them as "the moosettes."
