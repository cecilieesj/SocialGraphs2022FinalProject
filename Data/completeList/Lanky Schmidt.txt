'''Nick "Lanky" Schmidt''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2001]] animated feature film, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and its [[Monsters University|2013 prequel]]. He is a former scarer at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]] and is currently a jokester. 
==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''===
Lanky is a scarer at Monsters, Inc. and ranks tenth on the Scarer's Leaderboard. He first appears at the Hidden City Cafe, eating a bagel. Later on, he arrives at the factory and, along with the other scarers, slowly approaches his station. He witnesses the [[Child Detection Agency]] arrive and winces when they decontaminate fellow scarer, [[George Sanderson]]. That night, Lanky and fellow scarer, Bob Peterson eat dinner at [[Harryhausen's]], where a human [[Boo|child]] is spotted. Amid the mayhem, Lanky is interviewed over the situation, where he exaggerates that the child flew over him and blasted a car with "its laser vision."

The next day, Lanky is briefly seen at a water fountain with Claws Ward as [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] makes his way through the factory in search of [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]]. Later, Lanky and several other monsters approach and congratulate scarer, [[Randall Boggs]], when it is believed that he has just broken the all-time scare record. After [[Henry J. Waternoose III|Waternoose]] is arrested, Lanky is among the monsters gathered outside the factory. Finally, at the end of the film, Lanky is seen at the Laugh Floor, now having become a jokester.
===''[[Monsters University]]''===
A younger, smaller Lanky appears as a background character in the prequel. He first appears when Mike arrives at the [[Monsters University (institution)|Monsters University]] campus. Later, as Mike promotes [[Oozma Kappa]], Lanky is among the monsters who listen to the presentation. During the end credits, Lanky's scare card appears, revealing that he is 6' 9", 163 lbs and is from Creespville.
===''[[Monsters at Work]]''===
Lanky is a recurring character in the series, who uses a bow as a way to amuse children.
