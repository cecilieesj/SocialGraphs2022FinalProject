'''Skye''' is an enthusiastic flying unicorn who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series, ''[[Sofia the First]]''. He has a noble personality and is protective of [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] and [[Princess Amber|Amber]], calling them his princesses. He is a colt who has just earned his wings, so he struggles with flight at times.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Skye is a young flying unicorn with a white coat and light crystal blue mane, eyes, and tail. He has a long, shiny blue and white horn. He has small, rounded white wings and cloven hooves. Around his neck is a gold collar with sapphires and aquamarines.

==Role in the Series==
Skye makes his debut appearance in ''[[The Mystic Isles]]''. He first appears when [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]], [[Princess Amber]], and [[Prisma]] arrive on the Isle of Unicorns. He gets himself stuck in a tree after he fails to teach himself how to fly with his newly-gotten wings. After Sofia gets him out, Skye offers to accompany them on their quest before giving Sofia and Amber a tour. During the trek through the Isle of Dancing Deserts, Amber finds an orange stone that she tries to get powers from, including the ability to fly which Skye also asks for, but fails. In frustration, Amber strikes the bridge that connects the Isle to the Isle of Crystals three times, causing it to collapse with them on it. They get saved by [[Orion (Sofia the First)|Orion]], one of the Protectors. After finally arriving on the Isle of Crystals, Sofia and Amber get Prisma's Terra Crystal and return it to Prisma, who reveals that she was the evil Crystalmaster they came to stop all along. After landing safely from the Crystal Vortex Prisma sent them in, Skye's wings and horn vanish. Orion appears and tells them that the only way to undo the harm Prisma's caused is to destroy her Terra crystal. Skye says that's impossible but Orion assures him it is with the right magic, which Sofia deduces to mean a Shattering Stone. After getting one, the group uses it to destroy Prisma's Terra Crystal and her powers, which gives Skye his wings and horn back. When Prisma attempts to escape, Sofia and Skye give chase during which Skye finally learns how to fly. They nab Prisma and turn her over to the Protectors, who offer to train Sofia to be one of them. After Sofia accepts the offer, Skye takes her and Amber home on the scenic route so they can really explore the different Isles together.

Skye makes his second appearance in "[[The Mystic Isles: The Mare of the Mist]]". He first appears when he arrives in EnchanciaÂ having improved his flying skills since the last time he and Sofia met. He meets [[Minimus]] and explains to Sofia that since she is incapable of unassisted flight the other Protectors have decided that she needs a Protector Steed and Skye has volunteered for the job to which Minimus volunteers for the job too. This causes numerous spats between the two that eventually leads to trouble that makes them reconcile. Sofia decides that Minimus will be her Protector Steed for the [[EverRealm]] and Skye will be her Protector Steed for the Mystic Isles.

Skye next appears in "[[The Mystic Isles: A Very Mystic Wassailia|A Very Mystic Wassalia]]" where he aids Sofia on a mission to help the Rompkins and next helps her and [[Chrysta]] deliver Wassalia gifts between the Isles. He is perplexed when he and Sofia find out that Chrysta has no family and spends Wassalia alone every year. So the two of them gather up the other inhabitants of the Mystic Isles to surprise Chrysta with a big Wassalia party and show her that they are all her family.

In the finale "[[Forever Royal]]" just as the Royal family is leaving for the children's graduation from [[Royal Preparatory Academy|Royal Prep]], Skye and Chrysta come to Sofia and tell her they need her to come with them as Prisma was spotted on the Isle of Crystals and every Protector has been called there to find her. After Prisma has been defeated, Skye flies Sofia back to the EverRealm and they make it to Royal Prep just in time. Skye then proudly watches the graduation with Minimus, [[Clover]], [[Robin (Sofia the First)|Robin]], [[Mia (Sofia the First)|Mia]], and [[Whatnaught/Gallery|Whatnaught]]. When Chrysta calls Sofia telling her that Prisma wasn't defeated after all and they need her, Skye immediately comes to Sofia's aid and flies her and Clover to the Mystic Isles. Unfortunately, when they arrive, Skye falls into [[Vor]]'s trap making him unable to help Sofia. The Protectors, who are trapped behind the same spell tell Sofia what Vor is planning to do and Skye urges her to go on and stop her. Later, when Vor has been trapped inside Sofia's [[Amulet of Avalor|amulet]] and the spell has been broken, Skye and the Protectors rush to the castle. They join together with Sofia's family and friends and help [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]] cast a spell that frees Sofia and Prisma from the amulet. After Prisma surrenders and Sofia has been dubbed Protector of the Ever Realm, Skye tells Sofia how relieved he and her animal friends are that she's alright. Then they all head into the castle for the graduation party.

== Relationships ==
===[[Sofia the First (character)/Gallery|Princess Sofia]]===
Skye's closest relationship is with Sofia. True to the vow he made after she freed him, he is fiercely loyal and eternally devoted to Sofia and loves her very much. He will do anything for her and protects her with his life, even if it means standing up to a giant Dragon or Rompkins, and he is always referring to her as his princess. His deep love for Sofia is also shown when he volunteers to be her Protector Steed, when he becomes sad when he realizes that Sofia should have chosen Minimus instead of him, and again when Sofia chooses him to be her Protector Steed of the Mystic Isles.

=== [[Princess Amber]] ===
Skye loves Amber every bit as much as he loves Sofia and refers to her also as his princess. Skye is also just as loyal to Amber and just as determined to protect her; this is shown when the Rompkins trick Amber into putting on the crown and carry her way up high, and when Amber goes to distract Prisma. And he never once gets mad when Amber makes a mistake.

=== [[Minimus]] ===
Skye and Minimus had a hard time getting along at first since they both wanted to be Sofia's Protector Steed. But eventually, they apologise for the way they acted toward each other and become friends. They also find that they both are very alike when they start saying the same thing at the exact same time.

=== [[Chrysta]] ===
Skye and Chrysta are good friends. Skye is perplexed when he and Sofia find out that Chrysta has no family and spends Wassailia alone every year. So they and the other creatures of the Mystic Isles throw her a big surprise Wassailia party to thank her for everything she's done for them and to show her that they are all her family.

==Trivia==
*Before making his television debut, Skye merchandise was already released in stores.
*Like Minimus, Skye is small for a unicorn and is ridden by Sofia.
*Skye mentions in the song "[[Pick Me]]" that he doesn't get lost and doesn't get mad. This has proven to be true as he did not get lost even while carrying Sofia through the mist, and he never once got mad when Amber made a mistake during his debut.
