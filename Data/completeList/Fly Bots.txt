The '''Fly Bots''' are flying robotic acolytes built by Romeo to serve as his guards of the Flying Factory. It is unknown how many of them there are exactly. They are the fourth type of Robot built by Romeo after Robot, Robette and PJ Robot.


==Personality==
Although they look small and cute like PJ Robot, the Fly Bots are very aggressive, quick, and unlike PJ Robot, are very loyal to Romeo as they will do what he commands.

==Physical appearance==
The Fly Bots are identical in appearance to PJ Robot's original design before the PJ Masks gave him a makeover in "PJ Robot".

==Powers and abilities==

*'''Red Beam''': The Fly Bots are able to shoot red beams which can cause people to be trapped in red bubbles.
*'''Speed/Agility''': They can also fly very fast.
