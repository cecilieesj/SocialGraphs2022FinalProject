==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
[[Mesmero]] mind-controls Boomerang into accompanying [[Grizzly]] and [[Shocker]] into attacking Spider-Man, Power Man, and Squirrel Girl. During the fight against Mesmero on top of the rooftop, Squirrel Girl uses one of her squirrels to knock out Boomerang. Mesmero was forced by Spider-Man to free Boomerang and the other villains from his mind-control. Boomerang, Mesmero, and Shocker were webbed up by Spider-Man and left for the police. In the episode "HYDRA Attacks" Pt. 2, Doctor Octopus frees Boomerang, Batroc the Leaper, and Kraven the Hunter from the brig of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier-turned-HYDRA Island where he proposes a contest where whoever can successfully can capture Spider-Man will join his latest incarnation of the Sinister Six.
