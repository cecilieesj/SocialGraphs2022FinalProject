'''Feliks, Pasha, and Polina''' are three tiger cubs who appear in the third season of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. They are [[Varya]]'s children.

The tiger cubs are shown to be playful towards [[Bunga]]. Their mother Varya cares about them.

===Physical appearance===
All the tiger cubs have orange and white fur. Each of them has different eyes - Feliks has green eyes while Pasha and Polina both have blue eyes.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Long Live the Queen]]", Varya and her cubs are first seen surrounded by [[Makucha's Army]] preparing to destroy the tigers. [[Kion]], the [[Lion Guard]], and the rest of the [[Night Pride]] arrive towards the spot and confront the enemies threatening to obliterate them just as the groups manage to fend them off to leave the tigers alone. [[Nirmala]] asks a worried Varya to know the Night Pride saw her cubs to which [[Beshte]] and Bunga bring her cubs to safety. Varya then introduces herself to the Lion Guard telling her that the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] is a great place to raise her cubs. The conversation, however, is interrupted when [[Ullu]] arrives telling [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] that [[Janna]] wants to see her, the Night Pride, and Kion because Janna wants to see the lions one last time before she completes her journey through the Circle of Life. Kion and the rest of the Night Pride come to see Janna one last time just as the rest of the Guard brings Varya's cubs to safety.

As Varya arrives at the willows looking for her cubs, Feliks, Pasha, and Polina suddenly pounce on Bunga. Bunga then takes the cubs and their mother to the Tree. Arriving inside, Rani and [[Makini]] arrive towards Varya's cubs to which their mother apologizes for getting in to which Rani continues planning to conquer her fear of being queen. Later at the taiga, Rani escorts the tigers to their home to which a group of musk deer led by Kiril is unsure if tigers should live with the other animals to which Rani explains that Varya and her cubs went seeking for safety to which they should live here as long as they respect the Circle of Life.
