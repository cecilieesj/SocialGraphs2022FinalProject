'''Gretchen'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398974/</ref> is a supporting deuteragonist of [[Phineas and Ferb|''Phineas and Ferb'']], and one of the [[Fireside Girls]] Troop 46231 in [[Danville]].
==Biography==
She was one of the Ferbettes in Phineas and the Ferb-Tones (“[[Flop Starz]]”, “[[Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown]]”). She also helped [[Phineas Flynn]] win the Swamp Oil 500. [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]] thanked her for a job well done and complimented her on adding the bow to the Team [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] Race car during the pit-stop (“[[The Fast and the Phineas]]”). She also sings in [[S'Winter (song)|S’Winter]] (“[[S'Winter]]”). In a deep voice, she counts down the blastoff of [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]’s rocket when they visit their star (“[[Out to Launch (Phineas and Ferb)|Out to Launch]]”). She appears to have a large IQ, having to repeat her statements due to the others not understanding what she had said, and saying words that no one else in the room knows (“[[Bubble Boys]]”, “[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]”).
==Appearance==
[[File:Gretchen_reading.jpg|thumb|250px]]

In winter, however, she ties her hair into a mid-length ponytail with red elastic, and wears an orange and red long-sleeved shirt with brown pants, and orange slip-on shoes.

==Relationships==
===[[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]]===
[[File:GretchenRemindingIsabella.jpg|thumb|250px|Gretchen helping Isabella remember what they need to do.]]
Gretchen and Isabella appear to be very good friends. In the instances where Isabella does not actually listen to what Phineas is saying to her due to drifting off into fantasies, Gretchen repeats it for her convenience. (“[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]”)

===[[Fireside Girls|The Other Fireside Girls]]===
Gretchen along with the other Fireside Girls gladly help out with [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]]’s and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]’s Big Ideas. The other Fireside Girls sometimes have difficulty understanding Gretchen first time stating something so Gretchen repeats it in a different way to get her statement across. (“[[Bubble Boys]]”)

===[[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]]===
Gretchen frequently participates in their Big Ideas. Phineas and Ferb will sometimes help them get a specific patch(es). Gretchen appears to have a bit of a crush on Ferb ,But Ferb shows no interest in her

==Other appearances==
===Video games===
She is a seldom-seen character in the Nintendo DS games ''[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb]]'' and ''[[Phineas and Ferb Ride Again]]''.

===''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''===
[[File:Alt. Gretchen A2SD.JPG|thumb|250px|Gretchen’s alternate universe counterpart in ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''.]]
Gretchen is the only [[Firestorm Girls|Firestorm]]/Fireside Girl that has a speaking line in the film. Her line is “I’m on it.”, when the [[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)|2nd Dimension Candace]] talks to the 2nd Dimension Gretchen.

===''[[Disney's Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]''===
Currently, Gretchen’s only appearance in “live” form was in ''[[Disney's Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]''

==Trivia==
*Gretchen is the first of the Fireside Girls (besides Isabella) to have a speaking role in the series. Early on in the episode "The Fast and the Phineas", she is the girl who asks the question about Phineas’s racecar being electronically fuel injected; however, she is not given a name at this point. Her name comes later when Isabella compliments her on the bow she ties on the car, but it is unknown which Fireside Girl she is since Isabella was speaking to the group. The last piece to the puzzle is that Ariel Winter is credited as Gretchen in the end credits for the episode. The episode’s print novelization in ''[[Speed Demons]]'' further confirms this by way of the narration explicitly stating that it is Gretchen who asks the question.
*She and [[Katie]] are the only Fireside Girls who appeared in the [[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|''Phineas and Ferb'' Nintendo DS game]].
*In “[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]],” she appeared to take the most prominent role, having the most spoken lines of dialogue.
*She may be a reference of Velma from ''Scooby-Doo'', whom she resembles in several ways, and may be the girl using the catchphrase “Jinkies” off-screen in that episode.
**She may also be a reference to Marcie from the ''Peanuts'' comic strips and TV specials. Gretchen often calls Isabella ‘Chief’ much like the way Marcie calls Peppermint Patty “Sir.”
*She shares a few traits with an earlier character from Disney with the same name, [[Gretchen Grundler]] from ''[[Recess]]''. Both girls have red hair and glasses, and both are very kind and smart.
*She is the only Fireside girl, along with Katie and Milly, to appear in “[[Disney's Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!|Disney’s Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever!]]”
*She was the only Fireside Girl who didn’t appear in “[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]”, but appeared for a cameo in “[[A Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas]].”
*She is the only Fireside Girl (besides Isabella) to have a part of the “Too Young” line (“[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]”) and the only female (besides Candace) to have the “Out, peace!” line (“[[Monster from the Id]]”).
*In “[[The Ballad of Badbeard (song)|The Ballad of Badbeard]]”, she appears to get seasick.
*Gretchen appears to be the shortest and the lightest of the main Fireside Girls as [[Adyson Sweetwater]] were able to carry her weight while she was reading “The Fireside Girls Book of Dendrology” (a large, heavy book) with no problems in “[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]].”
*In the future-set episode "[[Act Your Age]]", Gretchen is shown to have grown considerably over 10 years, becoming at least as tall as most of her fellow former Fireside Girls if not the tallest.
*In “[[Tri-Stone Area]],” she is seen without her glasses as a cavegirl while singing “[[Zubada]].”
*[[Dan Povenmire]] revealed that she is “a dead-on caricature” of character designer Greg Guler’s daughter.
*In “[[Bee Story]]” she seemed to have gotten annoyed with [[Katie]]’s buzzing when asking her what was she doing.
*"[[Jump Right to It]]" is the only song that Gretchen was the lead singer. (“[[Night of the Living Pharmacists]]”)
