'''Carlos'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0416187/</ref> (voiced by [[Kel Mitchell]])<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005239/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t55</ref> is a recurring character of the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Proud Family]]''.

==Personality==
Carlos is brave, sweet, and gentle. Penny wasn't into him at first but after he saves her baby brother and sister, she starts to like and appreciate him. She then develops a possible crush on him. He doesn't appear in any other episodes of the show so this wasn't established any further.

He appears to be innocent but also mature as he doesn't need to fight back when someone insults him. 

==History==
He is a big, fat guy who is enlisted on the football team. He went to elementary school with both LaCienega and Dijonay and was in LaCienega's fifth grade class. Penny was stuck with him after LaCienega tricked her into checking on BeBe and CeCe. At first, Penny felt unlucky with him, but when her baby brother and sister snuck onto a roller coaster ride, he was brave enough to save them, and she started to like him and respect him more than before.

==Episode Appearances==
===Season One===
*"[[Forbidden Date]]"

==Trivia==
*He was so strong that he was able to win a prize for her.
*He is a fan of mythology as he seems to know a lot about [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] and [[Odin Borson|Odin]] as well as [[Asgard]].
