He is portrayed by Vincent LaRusso.
==History==
In ''[[The Mighty Ducks]]'', he is the star player for the Hawks. Coach [[Gordon Bombay]] discovers that Adam actually resides in the Ducks' district boundaries and threatens [[Jack Reilly|Reilly]] into transferring Banks to the Ducks. [[Gerald Ducksworth|Ducksworth]] makes a deal with Reilly about the Hawks keeping Banks, however Bombay refuses since it would be against fair-play.

In [[D2: The Mighty Ducks|D2]], he is concerned about playing well and enough in each of the games because scouts are watching all of the matches. Later, Adam injures his wrist in the first match up against [[Iceland]]. He attempts to hide it from his teammates and Coach Bombay, the latter eventually finds out and benches him to prevent any further injury. 

In [[D3: The Mighty Ducks|D3]], Adam's skill allows him to join the [[Eden Hall Warriors|varsity team]] at [[Eden Hall Academy]], much to his displeasure. Fortunately, Adam returns to his teammates' side at the JV-Varsity Showdown. Throughout the trilogy, Adam has been the one to sustain the most injuries out of the entire team. Over the course of all three films, his personality ranges from being a quiet follower in the footsteps of the tougher Hawks to a devoted member of the Ducks. He still shows moments of being gullible and unable to speak up for himself but he overcomes those moments in every film.

=== <u>The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers</u> ===
[[File:AdamBanksinGameChallengers.jpg|thumb]]After D3, Adam became a public defender. When he reunited with the other Ducks and Gordon Bombay at Twin City Slice, he was put off by Gordon's attitude towards them. 

At the gala, Adam comments that the new Ducks became "a bunch of cake eaters". This prompted the rest of his friends to tease him about it (as they had called him a cake eater), to which he responded that he not eaten cake in 25 years. When [[Evan Morrow]] told Adam and the others that Gordon was not invited to the gala, he and the other Ducks picked him up in a limo (which they drove onto the Ice Palace's ice) and took him to the gala. Once there, the old Ducks stopped a speech by Stephanie about how the true recipient of the rewards should be Gordon Bombay. Adam mentioned that when he was on the Hawks, he "sucked as a human" and would have fit in with the new Ducks. He then said that playing for Bombay made him become a better person.

He is seen later on playing a hockey game with the Don't Bothers at the Ice Palace. Most notably, he was checked into the boards by [[Lauren Gibby]] and shortly after that, [[Fulton Reed]] checked him into the bench. Reeling from the hit, Adam stumbled out, prompting everyone to help him up.

== Playing Style ==
Adam is unquestionably the best offensive player on the Ducks roster. He is a skilled puck handler and skater, which makes him the Ducks most dangerous scoring threat. In fact, he was the only player to score a goal for the Ducks in their first encounter against Iceland in the second film, and was also able to score against teammate, [[Julie Gaffney]].  

== Trivia ==

* Banks' could be considered the unofficial best player on the team, as hinted throughout the trilogy.

* When Adam was originally a player for the Hawks, and wanted to be a Hawk in [[The Mighty Ducks]] it's because that [[Philip Banks|his father]] told [[Gordon Bombay]] that his older brother was a Hawk, and his friends were Hawks.

* Adamâ€™s jersey is numbered #9 when he played for the Hawks but when he later joined the Ducks an extra 9 was added to his jersey making him #99. 

* During the final game of [[D2: The Mighty Ducks|D2]], Adam was originally going to wave an American flag but he instead gave it to [[Charlie Conway|Charlie]].

* The reason that Adam worked as a public defender it's because he learned how to fight for the good guys.
