'''Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Brown''' is a new character in the [[Disney+]] Original Series ''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder]]''. He is the, incredibly tall, boyfriend of [[Penny Proud]] who always seems to know exactly what to say.

==Background==
===Personality===
Kareem is perhaps the nicest person ever. He is always polite to those around him and is slow to anger, if he ever does that is. At times, it is shown that he is wise beyond his years and is smarter than he looks. He might also be self-conscious about himself and his abilities, as he pretended to be bad at basketball so that he would not have to join Oscar's team; possibly to avoid being stereotyped. While he was tempted by [[LaCienega Boulevardez]], he is devoted to Penny and shows no interest in any other girl.

===Physical appearance===
Kareem is an incredibly tall African-American boy (about six-feet) with curly hair. He wears a grey hoodie, which he always has up, and a black t-shirt over it with a forte symbol. He wears blue denim jeans and yellow boots.
