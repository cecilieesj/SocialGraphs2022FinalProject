[[File:Gabby-0.jpg|thumb|337x337px|Gabby Gomez in her normal form.]]
Gabby Gomez is a young Latin/American/Hispanic girl who loves to chew gum. She usually wears a pink dress, a pink bow, and black mary-janes.

When she is a superhero, her entire body was made up of chewing gum.

== Personality ==
Gabby is a very polite, but promise-breaking person. She loves to chew bubble gum.

Gabby takes chewing gum to a new level. She's never without it. You can find her blowing bubbles while hanging upside down from a tree, while swimming at the pool, and even while getting her hair cut at the barber shop. Until finally one day her mother tells her a rule "No more gum."

Unfortunately, Gabby struggles a bit with self control and ends up breaking the rule which gets her into a very sticky situation.

Gabby is able to stop a purse snatcher with her new, sticky superpowers, but she can keep them a secret from her mother, who forbids Gabby from chewing gum.
