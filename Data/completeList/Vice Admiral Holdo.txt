After the Battle of [[Starkiller Base]], Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo takes part of evacuation of [[D'Qar]] boarding on her ''Free Virgillia''-class Bunkerbuster ''Ninka''. However, the [[First Order]] arrives leading [[Poe Dameron]] to engage them destroying the ''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought ''Fulminatrix'' to buy the [[Resistance]] to evacuate. Unfortunately, all of their bombers are been destroyed including Paige Tico's bomber and Poe is demoted to captain by General Leia Organa for disobeying her orders.

Shortly after the First Order tracked them through hyperspace, she becomes acting leader for the Resistance due to Leia Organa getting injured from gettling to pulled into the vacuum of space by her son's wingmate Poldin LeHuse who was then shot down by her ship. Poe leads a mutiny against her, but is stunned by a recovered Leia who then proceeds her plan to evacuate the crew from the MC85 Star Cruiser ''Raddus'' to [[Crait]]. However, the First Order learns of their plan having revealed to them by [[DJ]] who helped [[Finn]] and [[Rose Tico]] board the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]'' to disable the hyperspace tracker.

The ''Supremacy'' begins to fire the transports as they approach Crait, and Holdo turns the ''Raddus'' around toward the ''Supremacy'' and sets its course to a kamikaze attack. She activates the hyperdrive through the Mega-Destroyer, crippling it, destroying twenty ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers and saving Finn and Rose from getting executed by [[Captain Phasma]].

==Trivia==
*According to [[Laura Dern]], Amilyn Holdo is [[The Force|Force-sensitive]].
*During the scene in which Holdo stuns [[Poe Dameron]], Laura Dern accidentally said "pew pew" while firing the blaster. This blooper can be seen in the finished film.
