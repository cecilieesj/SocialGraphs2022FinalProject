The '''Ballerina Princess''' is a character in the [[2018]] Disney film, ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''.

==Background==
According to [[The Sugar Plum Fairy|Sugar Plum]] while watching the ballet, she explains to [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] that the ballet tells the story of the Four Realms with the Ballerina Princess representing her mother [[Marie Stahlbaum]]'s discovery of the Four Realms. At the end of the ballet, she was praised with joyful cheers for her amazing performance done during the ballet.

==Role in the film==
As [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] is presented as the Princess of the Palace of the Four Realms and just as Clara, [[Phillip the Nutcracker|Phillip]], and the Regents take their seats to watch the story of the Four Realms, the Ballerina Princess dances across the stage, just as [[The Sugar Plum Fairy|Sugar Plum]] explains to Clara that the ballet tells the story of the Four Realms and how her mother discovered the Four Realms prior to her death as the Ballerina dances through scenes representing the Land of Flowers, the Land of Snowflakes, the Land of Sweets, and the Land of Amusements (the area where Marie had her troubles at before her death). As the Ballerina is at the scene representing the Fourth Realm, she retreats from the dancers representing the [[Mouse King (The Nutcracker and the Four Realms)|Mouse King]] and his henchmen and after the scene, the Ballerina performs pirouettes in solo while Sugar Plum explains that [[Mother Ginger]] was the one who began the war with the Four Realms, just as the ballet ends with the Ballerina dancing with background sets of the Lands of Flowers, Snowflakes, and Sweets behind her. After the ballet, the Ballerina Princess and the rest of the dancers receive a large applause from everyone who was watching the ballet (including Clara herself) as she and the dancers are praised by a satisfied audience. She is not seen again afterwards.
