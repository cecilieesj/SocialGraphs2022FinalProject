She's Armenian-American. She is quieter and follows more than the other Ashleys, but she is just as snobby (similar to [[Ashley Boulet|Ashley B]].). Like all of the other Ashley's, she has a little sister Brittany, and a little brother Tyler. She can also be a bit clumsy at times and is considered to be the smartest of the girls.
