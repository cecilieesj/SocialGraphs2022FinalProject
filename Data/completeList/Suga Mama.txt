'''Charlette "Suga Mama" Proud''' (née '''Towne''') is a hip, wrestling-loving grandma in ''[[The Proud Family]]''.

==Personality==
Being the mother of [[Oscar]] and [[Bobby Proud|Bobby]] Proud, Suga Mama is shown to be very sassy, and always gets straight to the point when she talks, never being reluctant to put in her opinions. She is also seen as being quite athletic for her age though, taking up baseball and wrestling. She constantly beats up [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] whether he insults her or not, and constantly insults him, but in the end, she respects him deep down, stating "sometimes I like you but I always love you". Suga Mama is in love with [[Papi Boulevardez|Papi]]. On the contrary, Papi despises Suga Mama and often makes rude remarks about her in Spanish, which she usually thinks are compliments. Suga Mama's big sister, [[Sista Spice|Spice]] has telekinesis. She shows extra amounts of love for her poodle, [[Puff]]. She repeatedly shows no respect for Oscar and prefers her other son, [[Bobby Proud|Bobby]]. However, during ''[[The Proud Family Movie]]'', she finally gives him some respect and listens to him for once.

== Relationships ==
* [[Oscar Proud]] - Despite being her son, Suga Mama does not treat Oscar nicely. She does love him but is terrible at showing it, often giving him emotional abuse or a lack of respect rather than genuine love and attention. It is revealed that Suga Mama unconsciously treated Oscar like this because she dealt with a similar experience when she was a kid. 
* [[Trudy Proud]] - Suga Mama's daughter-in-law. They have a close and rather healthy relationship. They get along really well for the most part and really love each other like family.
* [[Penny Proud]] - Suga Mama is very close to her granddaughter. They have a loving relationship.

==Background==
Not much is known about Suga Mama's early life, nor her age, this fact often being made fun of by Oscar, resulting in Oscar normally getting beat down by her. What is known is that she has an older sister called [[Sista Spice]] that was favored more by her parents than herself, perhaps explaining why she favors her older son Bobby over Oscar, despite Oscar being more productive and having a real job. In the episode, "[[She Drives Me Crazy]]", [[Trudy Proud|Trudy]] does mention that Suga Mama's driver's license expired in [[1938]]. An event from twenty years ago shows her looking exactly the same as before. However, while slimming down to fit into a wedding dress, her diet was so successful, that she gained the slim and attractive body she had as a young woman in her 20's. She is a former member of the Southern Belles, and worked as a mechanic during World War II along with her friend and former rival Gertie Dinkins, where she met her future husband [[Percy Proud]].

In the ''[[The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder|Louder and Prouder]]'' season one finale, "[[Old Towne Road]] Part I", it's revealed that Suga Mama's real birth name is Charlette Towne and her family is from Towne, Oklahoma. Trudy takes her and all the other Prouds (against their will, especially Suga Mama's) to Suga Mama's family, where it's revealed that she has an estranged relationship with her father Pa. It's shown via flashback that when Suga Mama was a child, she showed her father that she is a naturally talented bullrider, but he openly disapproves of her doing so as he prohibits females from participating in certain activities such as bullriding even to the present day, expecting them to make meals for him and the Towne family. Pa's blatant sexism and misogyny emotionally damaged Suga Mama and caused her to leave her family.

*In some episodes, Suga Mama's arm and leg muscles vary from thick to thin ones and vice versa.
*Suga Mama has very poor vision, and as revealed in "She Drives Me Crazy", her current glasses don't correct her vision properly.
