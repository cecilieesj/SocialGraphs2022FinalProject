The '''Anglerfish''' is a minor antagonist in the [[2003]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.

==Background==
The Anglerfish is a territorial deep-sea fish that, like any other abyssopelagic animal, has the ability of bioluminescence, which is a common characteristic among deep-sea creatures. It uses the bioluminescence to lure its food, mostly smaller fish. After the prey are draw near enough by its light without noticing they are approaching a predator, it aggressively attacks them while trying to capture and eat their food.

==Role in the film==
The Anglerfish entices [[Marlin]] and [[Dory]] in a dark chasm with her glowing dorsal fin before chasing them, as the two fish try to search for [[Dr. Philip Sherman|P. Sherman]]'s [[P. Sherman's Diver Goggles|diving mask]]. Eventually, she gets caught in the mask around a rock, immobilizing her, but not before attempting one last bite at Marlin and Dory.

The Anglerfish was later mentioned by a pair of fencing marlins who heard about Marlin's story, and by [[Nigel (Finding Nemo)|Nigel]] when he tells [[Nemo]] and the [[Tank Gang]].

After the credits of the film, the Anglerfish is eaten by Blenny (who overcomes his fear of sharks and other predatory fish) in a single bite.

==Disney Parks==
===[[The Seas with Nemo & Friends]]===
The Anglerfish and the rest of the characters from Finding Nemo were introduced to the attraction when [[The Living Seas]] was reopened in 2007 as [[The Seas with Nemo & Friends]]. When the guests pass through the Abyssopelagic Zone, the Anglerfish is seen chasing Marlin and Dory while on their journey to look for Nemo in which the two fish were able to escape from them.

===[[Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage]]===
Several Anglerfish were added to the attraction when [[Submarine Voyage]] was reopened in 2007 as [[Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage]] featuring characters from the film. When the guests pass through the darkest part of the ocean, Marlin and Dory notice small glowing lights which then reveal to be several anglerfish trying to eat Marlin and Dory in which they escape from them and end up in the jellyfish forest.

==Trivia==
*The anglerfish appears to be female, as only females possess the glowing bait that characterizes the species. They are also larger and more dangerous than males, who are 40 times smaller than females.
*The anglerfish makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Up]]'' during [[Carl Fredricksen|Carl]] and [[Charles F. Muntz|Muntz]]'s fight when Muntz strikes the fish exhibit with his sword.
*Since she is an adult female anglerfish, we can assume she is 14 years old.
