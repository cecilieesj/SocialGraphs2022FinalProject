'''G2-9T''' is a droid appearing in ''[[Star Tours]]'' and its prequel ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]].''

== History ==

=== Background ===
G2-9T was a G2-unit repair-droid or, "Goose Droid" which was owned by the [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]] company.

Sometime before the [[StarWars:Battle of Yavin|Battle of Yavin]], G2-9T worked as a droid security agent, scanning luggage for paraphernalia banned on flights by the [[StarWars:Galactic Empire|Galactic Empire]].  G2-9T is shown to be incompetent at his job, clearing luggage containing weapons and smuggled droids or aliens, yet destroying luggage containing harmless items such as computers or toys.

By the time of the setting of the original ''Star Tours'', G2-9T was reprogrammed into a repair droid.  He was shown working on astromech-droids for Star Tours, singing to himself as he worked.

=== Development History ===
G2-9T was created from the audio-animatronic skeleton of one of the [[Singing Geese]] from the defunct attraction [[America Sings]]. G2 units being nicknamed "Goose Droids" were an allusion to this.  G2 even sings Star Wars themed parodies of songs sung by the geese in America Sings.

In both the original Star Tours and its Adventures Continue counterpart, G2-9T is voiced by Disney imagineer Tom Fitzgerald.

== Appearances ==

=== ''Star Tours'' ===
G2-9T appeared in the queue for Star Tours, repairing the Astromech [[R5-D2]].

=== ''Star Tours: The Adventures Continue'' ===
G2-9T appears in the Sector 2 section of the queue of ''Star Tours'': ''The Adventures Continue'', a prequel to the original Star Tours.  G2-9T works as a security agent for Star Tours in the queue for this attraction.

G2-9T is shown clearing luggage containing items and characters from the Disney, [[Pixar]], and Star Wars universes, including:
*[[StarWars:TK-421|TK-421]]'s [[Starwars:Stormtrooper|stormtrooper]] armor
*[[Mr. Incredible]]'s super suit (from ''[[The Incredibles]]'')
*A souvenir [[Goofy]] hat (which G2-9T mistakes for a Jar Jar Binks hat)
*[[Mickey Mouse]] gloves
*[[Starwars:G2 repair droid|G2 droids]]
*[[Genie's Lamp]] (from ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'', although G2-9T thought that it was meant for smoking purposes).
*Scottish bagpipes (which he promptly destroys; alludes to the rebellion of 1745, when the British Government banned the Highlanders from wearing kilts and playing bagpipes, which were considered instruments of war, note: it is replaced by a Banjo).
*A [[Starwars:DUM-series pit droid|pit droid]] (playing with a toy [[StarWars:TIE/ln starfighter|TIE fighter]] and StarSpeeder 1000)
*[[Starwars:Astromech droid|Astromech droids]]
*[[Starwars:B1 battle droid|B1 battle droids]] (which G2-9T thinks they're calling him "Roger")
*[[Major Domo]] and [[Minor Domo]] from ''[[Captain EO]].''  This references how George Lucas assisted in the creation of Captain EO in addition to that of Star Tours.
*A [[Wikipedia:MacBook|MacBook]] (which is accidentally destroyed by G2-9T due to miscommunication with the station's main computer on what the object was. The conversation itself was a reference to Abbott and Costello's "Who's on first" comedy routine.)
*[[Buzz Lightyear]] and several [[Little Green Men|squeeze toy aliens]] (from ''[[Toy Story]]'').  The Buzz Lightyear's wings spread out while G2 states it is, "Not a toy".
*A [[Wikipedia:Camera|camera]] (that he promptly destroys, thinking it's a new type of alien technology; this alludes to the rule against flash photography during the flight while in the StarSpeeder. It is the first object destroyed)
*An [[Starwars:RX-series pilot droid|RX-series pilot droid]]
*[[Starwars:Lando Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]'s luggage
*An [[Starwars:E-3PO|E-3PO protocol droid]] (which he scolds for using foul language)
*Space helmets and oxygen tanks with DASA (Disneyland Aeronautics and Space Administration) insignia (from [[Space Mountain]])
*[[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] (from ''[[WALL-E]]'')
*[[V.I.N.CENT]] (from ''[[The Black Hole]]'').  This alludes to how a rejected version of the attraction which became Star Tours would have been based around the Black Hole.
*[[Stitch]] (from ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''; the droid promptly quarantines the suitcase that he is in, as animals are not allowed in checked baggage, alluding to how Lilo and Stitch first met at a kennel; note, in later versions of the ride, he is replaced by [[Figment]].)
*An [[StarWars:Ewok|Ewok]] (even though Endor is not currently an actual destination in the experience; during this instance, G2-9T mistook the Ewok for a doll, although the final seconds of the scan indicated that it was actually alive.)
*Mickey Mouse's [[Sorcerer Hat]] (from ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'')
*A [[StarWars:MSE-6-series repair droid|Mouse Droid]]
*A bear-trap
*[[Indiana Jones]]' fedora and bullwhip.
*Football<u> </u>helmet adorned with [[Epcot]]'s [[The Living Seas]] logo and a football with Epcot's [[Spaceship Earth]] logo
*[[StarWars:G2-5T|G2-5T]] droid's body parts
*A [[Lightsaber]] (which G2-9T mistook with a flashlight)
*Helmets, gloves and an [[Identity Disc|identity disc]] from [[Tron|TRON]].  Like with the Black Hole, this tributes how a rejected version of the attraction would have been based around TRON.
*A pit droid using a tablet computer
*A [[StarWars:Marksman-H combat remote|Marksman-H combat remote]]
*The [[Mad Hatter's hat]]
*A Mickey Mouse ear hat
*Scuba gear.
*Objects belonging to WALL-E including the plant in the boot.
*Pirate paraphernalia including [[Captain Hook]]'s [[Captain Hook's Hooks (object)|hook]].
*[[Woody|Sheriff Woody's]] cowboy hat (also from ''Toy Story'')
*Little Mike, [[Mike Wazowski]]'s doll from ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' alongside [[Fungus]]' glasses from the film.
*[[Madame Leota]] from [[The Haunted Mansion]] along with books from the mansion.
*A [[Jawas|Jawa]]
*[[Chip and Dale]] (Which G2-9T thinks that they're not the same, because of their noses)
