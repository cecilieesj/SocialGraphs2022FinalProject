'''Tessa''' is one of the twelve Star Darling students at Starling Academy and also one of the supporting characters and protagonists in Disney's ''[[Star Darlings]]''.

==Background==

=== Official Description ===
''From the time she began to sparkle, Tessa showed a love for gourmet meals! Tessa loves to take care of her sister, [[Gemma]], and her friends. She's the nurturer of the group and encourages her friends every step of the way.''

===Personality===
Tessa is described as being loyal to those she loves and has a deep connection with Starland's magical creatures. But she can be quite stubborn when it comes to settling arguments - she can be rather stubborn and is always convinced she's right. She doesn't deal well with change and is prone to exaggeration. She can be easily sidetracked.

=== Physical appearance ===
Tessa’s theme color is emerald green. She is a teenage girl with dark skin, green eyes, lips, and curly green hair with steaks of blue. Her outfit consists of a green dress with flower designs under a short blue vest, green gloves, and leggings. Her accessory is her star-charmed brooch.

On Earth, Tessa’s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of green. Her skin loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same is her star-charmed brooch.
