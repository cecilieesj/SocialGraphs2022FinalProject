}}'''Rangi Fangus''' is [[Angus Fangus]]'s mother. She lives in New Zealand, and she's the leader of the local MƒÅori village, in a desperate trial against [[Fenimore Cook]], who wants to destroy her village and her people. She is a very authoritative woman, feared also by her son, who thinks is better to not oppose at her decisions.
