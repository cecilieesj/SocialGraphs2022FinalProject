The '''Lava Idol''' is a large tribal figure featured in the [[Mystic Manor]] attraction.

==History==

===Background===
The lava idol is a large tiki statue which is used to represent a lava god from MƒÅori or Polynesian culture. This idol was one of the rare artifacts collected by [[Lord Henry Mystic]] during his journey at the isle of Tonga<ref>As seen in the Mystic Manor guide seen in the attraction's queue, the lava idol headlined in the Tribal Arts section is shown to be taken from Tonga.</ref> where the idol was displayed at the Tribal Arts section with the other tiki idols from  Polynesia, Tonga, and Tahiti to give the room a Polynesian theme.

==Role in Mystic Manor==
The lava idol is encountered when the vehicle passes by the Tribal Arts room where the idol itself is seen spewing lava from its mouth and it appears that the idol became animated when [[Albert the Monkey|Albert]] opened the [[Balinese Music Box]]. Upon entering the room, the lava idol is seen spouting lava out of its mouth while the tiki idols and tiki totem poles chant the attraction's theme song. 

After Albert finally closes the [[Balinese Music Box|music box]], all the artifacts in the Mystic Manor are brought to their lifeless forms, so it is likely that the lava idol and the rest of the idols in the Tribal Arts room were reverted to motionless forms with the lava spewed by the idol itself being extinguished.

==Trivia==
*As with many elements featured in the Tribal Arts room, the Lava God pays reminiscence to elements from the "Enchanted Tiki Room" attraction (specifically tiki god depictions designed by [[Rolly Crump]]).
