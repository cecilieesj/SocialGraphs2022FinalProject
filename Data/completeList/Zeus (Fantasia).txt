'''Zeus''' is a character in the "[[The Pastoral Symphony|Pastoral Symphony]]" segment of the [[1940]] film ''[[Fantasia]]''. He interrupts [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]]' party with the [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|centaurs]], [[centaurettes]], [[Cherubs|cherubs]], and Pegasus, throwing lightning bolts for his personal entertainment.

==Background==
===Personality===
A more accurate depiction of his mythological counterpart rather than the more benevolent incarnation seen in ''Hercules'', Zeus is more of a malevolent mischief-maker who doesn't really think of how his actions affect beings below and is more focused on creating amusement for himself with his storms.
===Physical appearance===
Zeus is a giant god with a blue robe, white beard, and blue eyes. He is slender but muscular.

==Role in the film==
Zeus interrupts [[Bacchus]]' party and creates a powerful thunderstorm, working with [[Vulcan]] on throwing lightning bolts as well as creating terrible winds to drive the storm. Eventually, he grows bored with the mayhem and decides to cease his activity to rest, causing the storm to subside.

==Trivia==
*This version of Zeus appears to be more malevolent than his counterpart in ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]'', and is meant to represent storms he makes in which is more accurate rather than the depiction in ''Hercules''.
*Zeus does not physically appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', though [[Mount Olympus]] does and he will throw lightning bolts at the enemies, [[Sora]], and his allies.
*Zeus is the god's Greek name. In Rome, he is called Jupiter.
