==Description==
The Robo-Penguins are so named is because they look like penguins. Under their wings are their battery life indicators. Because they are not built for speed the Robo-Penquins are known to be very slow, but they are fast when they slide down hills or when they are being chased. While all Robo-Penguins look the same, one in particular is nicknamed "[[Bowtie]]" because he wears a blue bow tie on his chest and is a friend to [[Mirandos]].

The Robo-Penguins are stationed on the Polar Icecap at the top of planet [[Tempestoro]], which is where their charging station is based. During big storms, the Robo-Penguins are programmed to go into their charging station. Recharging their power supply is essential for the Robo-Penguins, because if they run out of power they will lose all of their data.

Robo-Penguins also have a heat mode of their own, which turns their black coloration to bright orange; while in heat mode, the Robo-Penguins are able to melt away thick layers of ice via touch.
