'''The Terra''' are an eco-friendly resistance group also known as the Terra-dwellers. They are led by [[Kaia]].

==Description==
The Terra fight to take revenge on [[Abraham Kane]] as well as the Deluxian. As a side effect of the dumping from KaneCo, the Terra themselves have been mutated. They conceal their appearances behind gas masks and headbands.

==History==
The Terra were once a peaceful, eco friendly group of Motorcitizens until KaneCo ravaged their land with toxic waste dumped by the Toxo Tanks. While allied at first with the Burners, the Terra's ruthless tactics quickly ended the alliance.

The Terra tried to blow upÂ [[Detroit Deluxe]], and later bring down the plates Detroit Deluxe rests on, both which would have hurt innocent people, or have crushed [[Motorcity]], but the Burners managed to stop them each time.

==Village==
The members live in a village on the outskirts of Motorcity, in an area that was decimated by KaneCo's waste dumping with his Toxo tank.

==Weaponry==
The Terra use rapidly-growing plants that have been mutated by KaneCo pollutants into crossbow like weapons. The 
Terra Dwellers also Have Vine Bullwhips & Spears.
