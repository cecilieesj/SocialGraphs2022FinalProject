(his last words)}}'''Count Nikolas Rokoff''' is a greedy former Russian count from ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]'' episode, "[[Tarzan and the Lost Treasure]]".

==Tarzan and the Lost Treasure==
After being stripped of his title presumably during the October Revolution, Rokoff hears about a pirate treasure in the Valley of the Leopards, and plots to find it to regain his status and wealth. Tarzan refuses to help him because of the danger of the task, but Rokoff threatens to kill Jane if he doesn't. His intellectual battle with Tarzan goes like a chess game until Tarzan finally releases the last few leopards from the boarded up cave on him. It is unclear if they kill Rokoff or not.

==Trivia==
*Nikolas Rokoff is a recurring character from the original Tarzan novels. He had a sister who was a countess whom he plotted against and had an assistant named Alexis Paulvitch. Just like in the series, Rokoff loses his life. The character also served as a loose inspiration for [[Clayton]].
*Rokoff bears a striking resemblance to [[Gaston]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.
