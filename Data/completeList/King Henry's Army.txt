'''King Henry's Army''' are an army of knights and soldiers serving under [[King Henry]] hailing from an unnamed kingdom who appear in the movie ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]''.

==Background==
King Henry led his large army in a campaign to invade [[Moors]], the realm of fairies and other mystical creatures, only to face the likes of [[Maleficent]] and the [[Forest Army]] who stood up to them in defense of their homeland and seemingly overpowered them in a titanic battle between man and mystical creatures. The army was forced to retreat after King Henry was mortally wounded by Maleficent.

After King Henry's death, Stefan became the new king of the kingdom and the army is under his control. Over the past 16 years, the army under King Stefan have spent all their efforts and resources in bringing down Maleficent, even tried to burn down the thorn walls over Moors and resorted to use of iron-based weapons and armor as fairies are weak to iron element, only to fail.
