A '''Bit''' is a binary digit from ''[[Tron]]'' that is represented by a white polyhedral shape, which is a compound of dodecahedron and icosahedron.

===''[[Tron]]''===
It was only capable of providing '''yes''' or '''no''' answers to any question. Despite this, it still managed to convey emotion and other levels of complexity.

Physically, Bit was represented within the movie by a blue polyhedral shape that morphed between the compound of dodecahedron and icosahedron and the small triambic icosahedron (the first stellation of the icosahedron). When "at rest" this shape was constantly shifting. When the Bit announces the answer "yes" it briefly changes into a yellow octahedron, and when it announces "no" it changes into the 35th stellation of the icosahedron, colored red.

Bit appeared twice in the movie, once at the beginning of the movie as a companion to [[Kevin Flynn|Flynn's]] hacking program [[Clu|CLU]] and later on as a companion to Flynn himself when he stole the [[Recognizer]] which CLU had earlier destroyed.

Bit was originally to have a more extensive role in the film, but it was cut to just two minutes due to scheduling reasons. Despite this, the co-creators of Max Headroom, in their book Creative Computer Graphics, called it "one of the most memorable characters in the film." At the time of the film's release, the character represented an innovative use of computer graphics techniques such as vector graphics and morphing.

Kevin Flynn had gold and silver decorations that resembled Bit in his home.

===''[[Tron: Uprising]]''===
[[Able]] has a Bit in his office, which agrees that [[Zed]] is an idiot.
