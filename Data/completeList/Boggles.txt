'''Boggles''' are creatures featured in the animated television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. They are only seen in the episode "[[Fu Dog Takes a Walk]]". 

==History==
Boggles, on ''American Dragon: Jake Long'', are humanoid creatures covered in brown fur. Not much is known about them since only one is briefly seen. They are never mentioned or seen again.

==Physical Appearance==
Although covered in fur, Boggles have scruffier beards and manes that stand out in comparison to the rest of their body. This permits them to hide in a crowd of humans more efficiently, especially if they wear clothes covering the rest of their skin. Their nose is shaped like a dog's, and they have pointed ears.

==Trivia==
*In Scottish mythology, the Boggle is a ghost or folkloric being that is the equivalent of the boogie man or bogart in England.
*According to Northern English mythology, the Boggle could be a derivation of the Barghest, a dog-like creature with the power of shapeshifting.
*Apparently, Boggles shed so much that they're even worse than real dogs.
*In "Fu Dog Takes a Walk", the unnamed Boggle adopts a pet Beagle.
