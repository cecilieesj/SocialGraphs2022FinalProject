He first appeared in the episode "[[The New Ron]]". He turned to villainy at an off-hand suggestion of [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]]'s. He is extremely committed to usual villainy, but because he considers bad-doing a hobby, he does never get particularly upset when his plans are foiled. His first name is unknown.

==Background==
Senior and his son live on a fairly intimidating private island, somewhere off the coast of Europe. Kim first encountered them when Junior's giant tanning lamp was causing rolling blackouts across Western Europe. Upon going to their island and realizing that Senior didn't mean any harm, she gave him a monologue about energy conservation and let him be.

Unfortunately, during that same encounter, Ron commented that several features of Senior's island bore a strong resemblance to a villainous lair, and gave him more suggestions for making his home more villain-worthy (Spinning tops of doom, self-activating lasers, speedboat for quick escapes, etc.). Senior originally dismissed Ron's suggestions, saying that they sounded too sinister, but upon reflection, he decided that he needed a new hobby.

===Physical appearance===
Senior has gray hair that is smoothed back from his forehead and white at the bottom, brown skin, baby blue eyes, and a thick unibrow. He seems to have brown or black eyelids. He usually wears a maroon suit coat with a white cravat and some sort of blue shirt underneath, khaki trousers, and brown shoes. He has a tattoo of three S's on the back of his neck.

===Personality===
Senior is always fully polite, even while he's trying to kill [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]]. This goes beyond sarcastic or insincere flattery; it seems like he's just a genuinely nice person. He's also very involved in his son's life, to the point where he has trouble letting Junior plan a crime by himself. He also seems obsessed with usual villainy, telling Junior at one point not to finish off Kim Possible so that she could have the chance to do something heroic.

He treats his villainous acts like a hobby, nothing to upset over if his fiendish plots are foiled, although his reasons and actions are often evil and/or selfish, whether or not he intends any real ill will.

==Relationships==
Senior does not work with other villains (other than his son, of course) and is less than pleased with Junior's occasional partnership with [[Shego]], although it's basically his own fault, since he hired Shego to tutor Junior in the first place. Senior's only known family is his son, [[Señor Senior, Junior|Señor Senior Junior]]. They appear to be fairly close, although Junior somewhat resents his father's focus on usual villainy and would rather use their expansive luck to become a popstar.

He recently belonged to a billionaire's club (He was ejected for fighting with an American cheerleader and losing. It seemed a bit "too weak-like"), and regularly has the four other richest people in the world (including [[Pop Pop Porter]] and [[Martin Smarty]]) over to play cards.

==Trivia==
*Senior's first appearance is in the episode "[[The New Ron]]". His voice was originally provided by veteran Mexican actor Ricardo Montalban, but in some episodes he's voiced by Earl Boen while Montalban was in poor health.
*As noted by Shego, Senior does not have any servants.
*Senior is one of the five richest people on Earth.
*Weakness of the Senior is his passion for "villain traditions" and his highly complex plans.
*Neither father nor son makes an appearance in the Shego-controlled world seen in "[[Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time|A Stitch in Time]]". A viable explanation is that Señor Senior Senior, by this time in the future, has died of old age or abandoned his villainous ideas. Another possibility is that the Seniors have pledged their loyalty to Shego and serve as her underlings in some capacity.
*It is never revealed who the mother of his son is.
*While he does not appear in the live-action film, he is mentioned by Drakken as one of the villains mentioned to have cooler lairs than he does on "Villainstagram".
*He once hypnotized Kim Possible.
*On [[Christy Carlson Romano]] and [[Will Friedle]]'s podcast, "I Hear Voices", both Romano and Friedle suggested that should ''Kim Possible'' get revived, since Montalban had passed, [[Eric Bauza]] could possibly replace Montalban as the voice of Senior.
