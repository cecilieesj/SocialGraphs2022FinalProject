He is a British international thief who has a cat named [[Lazlo]].

He is voiced by Steve Valentine. 

His usual goal is to steal things every time he does something evil. But, he constantly suffers injuries that are amusing. One time, his evil pet, Lazlo stole his plan which was the plan to remove all of the hot dogs in Hot Dog Hills and to target the secret recipe.

Despite being a villain, he temporarily helped Mickey, Donald and Goofy stop his evil cat and sidekick, Lazlo in the episode, Stop Lazlo!. He went back to his evil intentions after that.

Although Heist is the main antagonist of the series, he does not appear in a lot of episodes. 

Heist usually gets defeated by getting arrested every time he appears. However, he is somehow out of jail every time he comes back.
