He is designed to double-dip food. His main instinct is to lick candies or appetizers and put them back in the bowl. His one true place is with [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] as one of her "cats".

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 002 was the second genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to double-dip food. 002 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai. Against statistically unlikely (but not impossible) odds, several experiment pods landed in one location: Mrs. Hasagawa's yard, 002's pod being one of them.

At an unknown point, [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] mistook 002's pod for an apricot and washed it, activating the experiment. However, as 002 was not a very evil or destructive experiment, he was able to live a peaceful life with her, due to the latter seeing the former as a mere stray cat who needed a home, though he frequently licked a bowl of hard candies.

When [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] discovered that Mrs. Hasagawa, kept several experiments as pets, they thought they were a danger to her and, along with [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]], decided to capture them all. As Mrs. Hasagawa was petting 002, Lilo took the bowl of candy from him and placed it in an open container, with the experiment taking the bait. Lilo assured the elderly woman that they would take care of the "problem," though unbeknownst to her, there was no problem to begin with.

002 and the other experiments were about to be taken away, but were returned them to Mrs. Hasagawa when Lilo and Stitch saw how much she cared for them. 002 was then named Doubledip.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Doubledip was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 608 instead of 002.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Doubledip, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Doubledip participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.
