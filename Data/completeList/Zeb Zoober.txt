==Role in the film==
In the film, Zeb is the only one who wanted to get the band back together (besides [[Fred Bedderhead|Fred]]); the only problem is he owes the bar lady (whom he constantly calls "Cha-Cha") money and the only way to owe her nothing is to beat her bar house band in a musical duel. At first, he was rusty, but he soon wins the battle. It is also implied that Zeb was the source of the attention between the band because of his drinking and picking on Tennessee.{{DEFAULTSORT:Zoober, Zeb}}
