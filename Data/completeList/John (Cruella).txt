'''John''' is a supporting character in the ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' live-action spin-off ''[[Cruella]]'', played by [[Mark Strong]]. He is the [[Baroness Von Hellman|Baroness']] former valet and loyal confidante aiding in her schemes.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cruella]]''===
John is the dedicated valet of [[Baroness Von Hellman]], who notices Estella when she comes to work for ''House of Baroness''. He proves himself to be a doting valet and more of a personal assistant to Baroness, doing her bidding to an extent. When Baroness attempts to murder Estella, who has been donning the name Cruella and upstaging her at every turn, John valiantly saves Cruella, [[Wink]], and [[Buddy (Cruella)|Buddy]] from the fire. He takes them to his home to recover. He explains that he overheard Estella tell the Baroness of Catherine Miller's murder at the Baroness’ hand. He shows Estella her mothers necklace, as he found it as they left the burning building. He reveals that it has a secret key that fits into to a box containing Estella’s birth records. He reveals that Estella is the Baroness' daughter.

Baroness was narcissistic and angry at her pregnancy as it would shift attention from her. After giving birth, she instructs John to "get rid of" the child. Unable to bring himself to murder a baby, John gives Estella to their sweet maid [[Catherine Miller|Catherine]] who raises her in secret. Estella returns to John's home with her friends [[Jasper and Horace]], who she just broke out of prison. He agrees to let them stay in his home, and John quickly becomes the inside man for Cruella as she plots to overthrow Baroness. As he serves the Baroness, she asks what he thought she meant when she said to "get rid of" the child all those years ago. John admits that he didn't think she meant for him to kill it, to which Baroness snaps back that he is useless and implies his stupidity. A few nights later, Cruella tricks the Baroness into being arrested for "Estella's" murder, inherits the entire Von Hellman fortune, and moves into the newly renamed [[Hell Hall]]. John greets her from the fire place and asks what she plans to do now. She gives a twisted smile as she has a few ideas.

==Trivia==
*John was created solely for ''[[Cruella]]'' and doesn't have an animated counterpart.
*The character was initially listed as "Boris", but when the movie received its simultaneous release date, his actual name was revealed. The reason behind his original name and why it was changed is unknown.
*He has similar role with [[Alonzo]] as both of them are Cruella's butlers. Unlike Alonzo, John doesn't get any abuse from Cruella.
