==History==
Vern Natoma heads editing in the school's journalism department.

He's then brought into the interrogation room where he's questioned by [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]].

In "[[Of Slain Kings on Checked Fields]]" he is also a reporter/interviewer. He tries to interview rapper [[Checkmatey]], but he doesn't get to do so for long. As the bodyguards show him out the door soon after.

In "[[This Savior, a Snitch]]", he and other journalist students are in the auditorium for the macaroni art contest, and he asks [[Dawn S. Folsom|Principal Folsom]] some questions.
