'''Malachite and Fig''' are two gnomes who appear in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[Sofia the First]]''. 

==Role in the Series==
Malachite and Fig make their debut in "[[The Crown of Blossoms]]". They first appear in Clover's garden in search of the lost Crown of the Gnomes. They were drawn there by the magic pollen that Clover's magical grown vegetables giving off. They instantly realize a seed from the Crown was used to grow the garden and trick Clover into leading them to the Crown, which they take. Clover, with help from Princess Sofia, traps them and gets the Crown back. They tell Sofia that the Crown is theirs and that King Gideon of Enchancia's wife took it from them by mistake. They also tell her their people have been suffering ever since they lost it due to the fact they live on land that's so infertile they need the Crown to make their crops grow big and juicy. Sofia realizes they're telling the truth and decides to make a deal that will benefit everyone with her parents' approval.
