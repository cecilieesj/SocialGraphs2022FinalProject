Witherspoon, interestingly, is the only one of Beast's servants who is not a household object. In contrast, he is an intelligent pigeon in charge of delivering the Beast's messages to the village for placing orders or anything similar. While it is possible that he was already a pigeon before the [[Enchantress]] placed the spell on the castle, him previously being a human servant may be the only possible explanation of his capability of understanding English with no apparent problem. (But then again, anything is possible in fairy tales...)
