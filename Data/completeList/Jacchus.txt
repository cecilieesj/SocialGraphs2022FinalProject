==Appearances==

===''[[Fantasia]]''===
He appears as Bacchus' pet, joining him in the wild revelry that accompanies the winemaking the [[Satyrs (Fantasia)|satyrs]], [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|centaurs]], and [[centaurettes]] are engaged in. Like his master he is depicted as an unattractive but lovable and jovial fool, drunkenly dancing around with everyone and having a good time. When [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]] calls up a storm he and Bacchus are caught in the middle of it, tormented by the wind and his bolts of lightning. Both are washed away in a stream of wine when lightning strikes the grape tub they're hiding under, but forget the danger and merrily drink the wine they're sitting in. When the storm ends he and Bacchus toast [[Iris (goddess)|Iris]] for coloring the wine in a beautiful rainbow pattern. 

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Jacchus appeared with Bacchus in ''[[House of Mouse]]''.

==Trivia==
*Jacchus was not in the original myth. He was an independent creation of Disney and a parody of the [[unicorns]] that appear in the film as well. 
*Jacchus' name is basically Bacchus' name with a "J" replacing the "B". It also sounds similar to the insult/technical term for a donkey "Jackass."
*Jacchus is very similar in facial looks to [[Lampwick]] during the time the latter's head transforms into that of a donkey's until he completely transforms into one in which his head is now slightly more realistic.
