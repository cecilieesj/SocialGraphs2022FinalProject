She loves rainy days and splashing in puddles. She even knows how to whistle mermaid songs. Her favorite dreams are swimming dreams. Rani can do amazing, magical things with water: bounce it like a ball, mold it into the shape of a fish, or scoop it up in her fingers without losing a drop. She can also help her fellow fairies with water-related things, such as getting water to boil faster.Â Rani is the only fairy in Pixie Hollow who can swim. This is because she has no wings. She sacrificed them on the quest to save Mother Dove's egg. She's not entirely unhappy about losing her wings since she had always longed to swim, though she misses being able to fly on her own. Now Rani flies with the help of Brother Dove. Whenever she needs him, Rani whistles, and Brother flies to her side and carries her wherever she needs to go.
