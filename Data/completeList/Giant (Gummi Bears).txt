The '''Giant''' is the central antagonist of the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[Let Sleeping Giants Lie]]", and is based upon the fairy tale monster of the same name.

==Role in the series==
Having been defeated by the Ancient Gummies centuries ago, the Giant had been sleeping near Leviathan Mountain ever since, aided by an herbal potion that the [[Gummi Bears|Gummies]] had been tossing into his cave each year on the Day of the First Snow, in order to keep him asleep for yet another year.

Though, the exact details of the tradition were lost to the remaining Gummies over time.

One year, when [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]] and [[Cubbi Gummi]] don't take the tradition as seriously as they they should, tossing a substitute bundle of snow into his cave instead, the Giant awakes and immediately wreaks havoc on [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]]'s coastal town.

==Trivia==
*The Giant does not speak, he merely grunts and grumbles.
*A different Giant has previously appeared in the episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Stone]]", but the character had merely been a boy who was under the spell of a Wishing Stone, and was finally released from the curse by [[Cavin]] and [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]].
