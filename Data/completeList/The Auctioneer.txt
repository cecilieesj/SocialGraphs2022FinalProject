}}'''The Auctioneer''' is a primary antagonist of Disney's, ''[[The Small One]]''. He is the second person that the Boy takes Small One to so that he can sell but it fails.

==Role in the film==
He auctions horses in the market. At first, he is angered that the boy brings Small One onto the stage and slightly embarrasses him. However, when the boy tells him what Small One can do, the man changes his mind and is intrigued, especially when the boy tells him that Small One is "good enough to be in a King's stable".

From the Auctioneer's perspective, that is all he needs to know. He mocks and almost injures Small One with his weight. But when Small One sees his best friend pushed aside, he regains his strength and throws the man off of his back. The Auctioneer chases them away. He isn't seen after that.

==Trivia==

*The Auctioneer bears a striking resemblance to [[Stromboli]] from ''[[Pinocchio]]''. Curiously, it almost seems fitting, considering that the short originally premiered on the 1978 re-release of said film.
