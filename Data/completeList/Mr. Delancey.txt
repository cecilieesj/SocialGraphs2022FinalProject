==Appearance==
Mr. Delancey is a caucasian man with blond hair, blue eyes, wears a light blue shirt, brown tie, lab coat, black belt with a pale blue buckle, jeans.

== History ==
In <ref>Field Trip of the Just</ref>, [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] sees him for some inquiries concerning [[Eric Orben]]. She learns from Mr. Delancey that Eric is actually a straight A student, yet despite that, he'd been in detention 15 times, so Eric being an underachiever turns out to be just a front and he hides his reputation by faking that he doesn't do well academically. Ingrid finds it far-fetched, but Mr. Delancey explains to her that there are other things that don't always make a lot of sense and aren't what they seem. However, he doesn't believe that Eric was the one who poisoned Guildenstern.</p>
