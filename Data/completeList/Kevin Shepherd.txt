==Role in the film==
Kevin works at the Second Chance animal shelter and is friends with [[Waddlesworth]], [[Drooler]], and ''The Gang''. He is first seen playing tug-of-war with Drooler. However, when Kevin seems close to winning the match, the dogs mount up to have Drooler win, with Drooler himself shaking his slobber onto Kevin. He later meets [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] and introduces the dogs to her, claiming that they have been able to help find homes for most of the dogs who arrive at Second Chance.

Later, Kevin tries to ask Chloe on a date, and Waddlesworth realizes that he needs a little nudge, so after Kevin saves [[Oddball]], who nearly fell out of an office window, and Chloe asks if there is any way she can say thanks, the macaw intervenes and suggests dinner. Chloe and Kevin then eventually go on their date.

Kevin later gets set up by [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] who spent community service at Second Chance. She is able to trick the authorities into thinking that Kevin kidnapped [[Dalmatian Puppies|the puppies]] to frame her and collect the fortune. Fortunately, hearing all of the puppies possibly owned by different people around [[London]], Kevin escapes from prison with Waddlesworth's help, and he later meets up with Chloe. They learn that Cruella is headed to [[Paris]] and decides to follow her. However, they are soon captured by Cruella and imprisoned in her fur coat factory. 

However, [[Alonzo]], Cruella's former servant who helped with the theft of the puppies, decides that he doesn't want to work with Cruella anymore and reforms by helping Chloe and Kevin escape. Near the end of the film, Chloe and Kevin receive an $8,000,000 paycheck from Alonzo for the dog shelter - on the judge's orders, all of Cruella's money had gone to the dogs' homes of the borough of Westminster - of which "Second Chance" was the only one. Kevin then notices a few spots on Oddball's body, which turn out to be real, and he and Chole congratulate Oddball for this.

==Trivia==
*Kevin was created solely for ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' and has no animated counterpart.
