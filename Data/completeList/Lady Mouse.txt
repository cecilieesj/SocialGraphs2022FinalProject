'''Lady Mouse''' is a minor character who appears in the final scene of ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.

==Role in the film==
{{Dialogue2|Lady Mouse|I-is this the home of the famous Basil of Baker Street?|Dawson|Indeed it is, Miss. You look as if you're in some trouble.|Lady Mouse|Oh I am! I am!|Dawson|Then, you've come to precisely the right place.|attr = Lady Mouse and [[David Q. Dawson|Dr. Dawson]]|src = The Great Mouse Detective}}A new case begins at the end of the film and it comes in the form of a beautiful tall weeping lass who has arrived to Baker Street in search of dire assistance. This young lady is in terrible trouble and only Basil seems fit to the challenge. Her presence was the perfect diversion of Dawson nearly making his exit to seek new lodgings and Basil chose this moment to recruit the doctor as his new business partner. As she dabs her tearful eyes with a dainty handkerchief, the two shake hands and it is onward to their next adventure.

==Trivia==
* While unnamed in the film, it is possible that she is based on Mademoiselle Relda, a supporting character from the ''Basil of Baker Street'' books and possible love interest of Basil.
