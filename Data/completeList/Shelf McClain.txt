'''Shelf McClain''' is a minor supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] boy who goes to [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and is considered the school's resident bully.

==Background==
Shelf McClain is a large boy from [[Scotland]] who has made a name for himself at [[Hazelnut Middle School]]'s resident bully. A short-tempered young man, he has been sent to detention probably more often than any other student at the school and is proud of it. It is not known exactly how he came to acquire such a behavior, but based on his mother having a similar personality, it is possible that he inherited it from her. The series continuously implies that he is angry because know one is able to show him any true affection. In "[[A Valentine's Day Tune]]", he longed for a Valentine from someone. [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] gave him one, much to his joy, though he tried to hide it.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Shelf had given up his bullying tendencies and became a priest at the local church; happily greeting his friends from his middle school days.

===Personality===
Shelf McClain is always depicted with a short temper and becomes agitated even if someone says his name while shouting, "Who said my name!? Who!?" Even when he shows an open minded and aware opinion on something, he still does so in a gruff and angry manner like in "[[To Germany with Love]]" when he berated [[Dieter Liederhosen]] for completely not getting what made Hazelnut so great. [[Milo Kamalani]] was able to calm him down and teach him empathy; revealing that he is not all bad. Additionally, he was happy to get a Valentine's gift, but still responded angrily, apparently trying to maintain his reputation.

===Physical appearance===
Shelf is a very tall and broad shouldered Caucasian boy with big black hair and a light unibrow. He wears a white t-shirt with a flannel jacket over it, denim jeans and large brown boots.

==Trivia==
*Unlike most television shows at the time that depict a bully character, Shelf rarely causes any harm to the main protagonists and was even tamed by one of them in "[[Manly Milo]]". It is possible that because of this, he served a slight inspiration for another bully character that broke traditional tropes, [[Buford Van Stomm]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.
*As evidenced by the finale, Shelf is a Christian and, based on his clothes, most likely Protenant. It is unknown if he had always been Christian or converted sometime after graduating.
