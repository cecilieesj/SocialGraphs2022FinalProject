==''Air Mater''==
Judge Davis is the main announcer of the air shows in [[Propwash Junction]]. He is a huge fan of the Falcon Hawks and [[Mater|Mater Hawk]], commenting on of their moves at the air show in ''Air Mater''.

==''Planes''==
Judge Davis makes a few minor appearances in the film, ''Planes''. His first appearance is at the qualifier of the Wings Around the Globe rally. He also reappears at the start of the WATG rally by saying to the racers, "Start your engines!"

==Trivia==
*Judge Davis' design is based upon "Ina: The Macon Belle", a P-51C Mustang flown by Lt Col Lee Archer of the 332nd Fighter Group (Tuskegee Airmen, also called the "Red Tails") during World War II. In a photo in the gallery below, you can see a side-by-side comparison of Judge Davis and "Ina: The Macon Belle". It should be noted that, with the top-mounted radiator intake, Judge Davis more closely resembles a P-51A Mustang.
