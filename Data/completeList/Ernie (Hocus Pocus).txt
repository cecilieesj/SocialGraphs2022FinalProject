==Role in the film==
Ice steals Max's shoes when Max says he does not have cash or bud for either him or Jay. 

Later, Ice is stealing candy from trick-or-treaters with Jay when they confront Max again. This time, they ask him about his costume which happens to be a "Little Leaguer" as referred by Max's sister, [[Dani Dennison|Dani]]. At that moment, Ice forces her to pay a toll in order for her to pass by him, but Max stops him by giving them his candy.

Later at 3am, the bullies are trying to think of some other activity to do (due to most of the Halloween activities having ended) when they encounter the [[Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]] due to [[Mary Sanderson|Mary]] having smelled Max's scent on the shoes Ice took from him earlier. The sisters abduct Ice and Jay and lock them up in cages hanging from the ceiling of [[The Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|their cottage]] after Jay refers to them as "ugly chicks", which offends them. When Max and Allison later arrive to rescue Dani, whom the sisters have abducted, Ice and Jay beg to be saved, to which Max responds by stealing back his shoes from Ice and leaving them there as payback for their bullying.

After the Sanderson sisters disappear off the face of the Earth at dawn, Ice and Jay are still in their cages and singing songs including "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" to fill in the time before any citizen of Salem will find and release them from their imprisonment. Their fates are left unknown by the end of the film; it can be presumed they were eventually rescued by another Salem resident. 

==Physical appearance==
Ice is a stocky and short medium teenager. He has brown hair and is of moderately muscular but weak build. 

His clothing consists of a dark beige trench coat, long orange pants, a green T-shirt underneath, a bowler hat, a gold chain, and originally simple brown shoes. After their first meeting, he wears the Nike basketball shoes of Max.

After retrieving his tennis shoes, Ice is shown wearing white socks with holes in one of his heels.

==Trivia==
*Despite not returning for ''[[Hocus Pocus 2]]'', Larry Bagby has stated that his manager submitted him to be featured in a cameo appearance as the owner of the Salem Magic Shoppe, but Bagby didn't get an audition for that.
