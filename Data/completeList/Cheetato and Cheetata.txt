'''Cheetato and Cheetata''' are two sophisticated twin cheetah brothers who appear in ''[[Timon & Pumbaa|The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series.

==Background==
===Personalities===
Although both sophisticated and hard to tell apart, aside from their voices, Cheetata appears to be more eager and aggressive, while Cheetato seems more likely to think things through and is the most conniving. They are usually seen hunting for prey and intimidating their victims in their unique sophisticated style. They are also both masterminds, as shown when they come up with a way to get rid of [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]]. Even so, the brothers are continually outsmarted by their prey, [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]].

===Physical Description===
Cheetata and Cheetato have the typical appearance of a cheetah. They are long-limbed, agile, and well-muscled, with incredible speed and strength. They have orange coats spotted with black dots, pale muzzles and underbellies, and black ears with brown inner fur.

==Role in the series==

While Cheetata and Cheetato hunt a wildebeest, they get disrupted by Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Cheetato notes that it was the thirteenth disruption on the thirteenth day. In order to get rid of the hyenas, the cheetahs plot to send them on a wild goose chase, far from where the duo plan to hunt.

First, they attempt to give the hyenas a treasure map. However, when the hyenas struggle to spell "X," the cheetahs come up with a new plan, catapulting the hyenas into a volcano via their own dastardly contraption: the Serengeti Shuttle. Once again, the hyenas return to the hunting grounds of the cheetahs, having been suspicious about the lack of airbags, peanuts, and seat belts in the Serengeti Shuttle. The cheetahs are then forced to execute their final plan.

Together, the two split up the hyenas, giving each one directions to the North Pole after telling them individually that they were the brains of the bunch. With the hyenas away, the cheetahs spend the next three months hunting without any interruptions. When they get stuffed, they run into the hyenas again and are too full to escape the trio. Before the hyenas could eat the cheetahs, a wild goose arrives, asking which way was south. The five courteously give him directions and then give chase.

Timon and Pumbaa are being chased by the cheetahs. Timon tells Pumbaa to be careful to avoid any low-hanging branches, but Pumbaa hops over such a tree branch, only to crash into a higher tree branch instead. Timon falls down because of the impact. Pumbaa does not realize this, as he has a monkey on his back in place of Timon. In the meantime, Cheetata and Cheetato find the meerkat. After the cheetahs abduct Timon, Pumbaa sees the monkey on his back and goes back to find Timon.

The cheetahs and Timon move to a cave. Timon hangs upside-down over a pot with his mouth taped shut, while the cheetahs have a difficult time locating any recipes for meerkat. Cheetato decides to use a box of "Meerkat Helper" and reads the box to find out how to cook Timon.

Pumbaa arrives outside, ready to save Timon. In the meantime, Cheetata, after seeing that the box said they had to listen to their prey's last words, takes the tape off Timon's mouth, and the meerkat tells the cheetahs to eat Pumbaa instead of him. Pumbaa is shocked at what he hears, but little does he know that Timon is just making up a story to make the cheetahs let him go. Timon tells the cheetahs about how plump Pumbaa is and convinces them to let him go so he could catch the warthog for them. When the cheetahs finally do so, a betrayed Pumbaa walks away, and Timon gets out of the cave. The meerkat gloats to himself before he leaves, but the cheetahs overhear him and tell him to give them his wallet. When Timon refuses to do so, the cheetahs hold the meerkat upside-down by his tail and shake him around to take his wallet by force. Because of his gloating, Timon is forced to actually capture Pumbaa.

After Timon explains to Pumbaa what had happened, the cheetahs find the duo and prepare to eat them. But when Cheetata calls Pumbaa a "pig," Pumbaa goes berserk and charges at the predators, flinging them to the top of a tree. Timon, Pumbaa, and the cheetahs return to the cave, with the cheetahs hanging over the pot with their mouths taped shut this time. When Pumbaa asks Timon if they were really going to eat the cheetahs, Timon replies that he just has an axe to grind.

In order to feel young again, Pumbaa decides to play a game of Predator Tag with Timon. Timon and Pumbaa find Cheetata taking a nap. Timon goes to Cheetata and tells him that he had won free tickets to see "Michael Meerkat." Timon then starts dancing. When Cheetata declares that he was going to eat Timon, Pumbaa throws a big squishy berry at the cheetah, and he and Timon run.

After Timon and Pumbaa lose Cheetata, Pumbaa happily jumps up in the air but hurts the bottom of one of his legs, which makes him feel old again. Timon, realizing that his lie might have been true, feels bad for his friend and walks off. However, he runs into Cheetata and Cheetato, who plan to eat him. Pumbaa, playing Coconut Football, hits the two cheetahs with a coconut, and he and Timon run, with the cheetahs chasing them. The cheetahs see Timon and Pumbaa on the other side of the mud pool taunting them. When the cheetahs jump over the pool, they realize that they had made a mistake, and the two fall in, with Timon and Pumbaa throwing the squishy berries at them. Whether or not they got out of the mud remains unknown.
