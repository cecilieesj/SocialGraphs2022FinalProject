==Background==
As the name suggests, the Lost Boys were all male characters. However, this temporarily changed in ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', where [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]]'s daughter, [[Jane (Peter Pan)|Jane]], becomes the first Lost Girl (although she later leaves the group).
<tabber>Slightly=
'''Slightly''' is the second in command. He wears a fox costume and is shown to be the oldest member (and the tallest) of the Lost Boys. In the book series, he is called '''Slightly Soiled''' and it is revealed that his real name is James; his surname is never revealed.
|-|Nibs=
'''Nibs''' is the most active and is the bravest of the group. He wears a rabbit costume and doesn't talk much. He may be the most minor Lost Boy, with the least amount of speaking parts (excluding Tootles of course). In the book series, it is revealed that his real name is Thomas. His surname is never revealed.
|-|The Twins=
A set of '''twins''' that speak at the same time. Although they are known for this, they do not carry it out in the sequel; instead, they finish each other's sentences. They wear raccoon costumes. They are treated as one in the book because Peter has no clue who is who. In the books, their names are revealed to be Marmaduke and Binky, but it is not known which name belongs to who.
|-|Cubby=
'''Cubby''' is the toughest of all the Lost Boys. He is large and overweight and speaks as if he does not have much knowledge. He wears a bear costume. In the book series, he is referred to as "Tubby Ted" which can be assumed that his real name is Theodore or Edward. His surname is never revealed.

Cubby is the most emotional of the boys. When Tinkerbell is first found to be ill in ''Return to Neverland'', he bursts into tears and cries until Nibs shoves a club in his mouth.
|-|Tootles=
'''Tootles''' is the only Lost Boy who does not speak at all; to compensate for this, he uses a large pad of paper to communicate (albeit only in ''Return to Neverland''). He is the youngest of the Lost Boys and seems to be the most cunning of the group. He wears a skunk costume. In the book series, it is revealed that his real name is Pentiss, but his surname is never revealed.

==Appearances==
===''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''===
[[File:Peterpan-disneyscreencaps-3197.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|238x238px|The Lost Boys in original film.]]
In the first film, the Lost Boys made their first appearance when Peter took Wendy, [[John Darling|John]], and [[Michael Darling]] to Neverland. The jealous [[Tinker Bell]] told them a "Wendy-Bird" had started a flight across there and needed to be hunted down. This later led to conflicts between Peter, the Lost Boys, Wendy, John, and Michael. John and Michael want to join their wild brigade, and Peter appoints John as their temporary leader. They sing "[[Following the Leader]]" as they walk, but are soon captured by the [[Neverland Indian Tribe|Indians]]. While being carried to the [[Indian Camp]], they are shown annoyed. There, John takes the blame for getting themselves captured and the Lost Boys accept his apology. The [[Indian Chief|Chief]] explains that his tribe has fought the Lost Boys many times, and Cubby suggests that he should let them go. John is confused and Slightly explains that they turn each other lose after a side wins. The Chief says he will not be releasing them, and accuses them of kidnapping his daughter, [[Tiger Lily]], but the Lost Boys tell him that they did not do so and had not seen her. The Chief threatens them to be burned at the stake if she did not return by sunset. However this punishment is prevented by Peter who rescues her from [[Captain Hook]], the real kidnapper, and the Lost Boys, John and Michael are then set free. The Lost Boys also view Wendy as a mother-like figure, demanding she tells them stories. It eventually all came down to the final battle with Captain Hook, the children victorious in the end. The Lost Boys were sad to lose Wendy, but reluctantly allowed her, John, and Michael to return home under Peter's watchful eye.

===''[[Return to Never Land]]''===
[[File:Peterpan2-disneyscreencaps com-3632.jpg|right|thumb|The Lost Boys in ''Return to Never Land''.|247x247px]]
In the sequel, Wendy has grown up and has a daughter of her own, Jane, a high-spirited girl who no longer believes in Wendy's stories of Neverland as her little brother, [[Danny (Peter Pan)|Danny]] does, due to war pressure. Her opinion is forced to change, however, when Captain Hook kidnaps her (thinking she's Wendy), she is rescued by Peter Pan and is taken to his hideout, [[Hangman's Tree]]. While the Lost Boys all excitedly crowd around her, Tootles reminds her of [[Danny]] and she runs off. Once she returns to Peter, it is then the Lost Boys' job to teach her how to have fun. They play a game of scavenger hunt, which ends with her being appointed their first Lost Girl. However, Tootles blows into the whistle that Captain Hook gave her, and this causes him and [[Pirate Crew (Peter Pan)|his crew]] to capture the Lost Boys and Peter. It all winds down to yet another final battle with him, the Lost Boys have finally unlocked Jane's inner child. Once she saves them and says that she must go home, they appear to be sad, as they begin to cry. However, she comforts them by saying that she will tell Danny their stories.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
The Lost Boys make numerous background appearances in ''House of Mouse''. In "[[Chip 'n' Dale (House of Mouse)|Chip 'n' Dale]]", they are seen struggling to open a bag of peanuts until they are helped by Tinker Bell. In the episode "[[Donald Wants to Fly]]", they are part of a Neverland band and can be seen on stage singing along as Peter sings a version of "[[You Can Fly]]", although Nibs is not present during this cameo. After the song, they all fly back to Neverland with Peter and Tinker Bell.

===Other appearances===
The Lost Boys made cameo appearances at the end of "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (animation)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]".

In ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', the Lost Boys make a cameo appearance at the end, being called by Peter Pan to their theater seats, where they pile around him and shout.

Only one of the Lost Boys, Cubby, makes a brief cameo in the movie ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' where he bumps into [[Peter Pan (character)|Sweet Pete]] and recognizes him as Peter Pan when the latter chases after [[Chip and Dale]] at a convention.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 3x01 - The Heart of the Truest Believer - Lost Boys.png|left|thumb|206x206px|The Lost Boys in in ''Once Upon a Time'']]
In [[ABC]]'s ''Once Upon a Time'', the Lost Boys (also known as the "Lost Ones") are the murderous inhabitants of Neverland and servants of Peter Pan. He began forming them under his alias of the [[The Pied Piper (character)|Pied Piper]] in the [[Enchanted Forest]], in his quest to find the heart belonging to the "Truest Believer". Because time is frozen in Neverland, they do not age making them much older than their otherwise youthful outward appearance might suggest. As mentioned by Wendy, they cry at night because they miss their families. Captain Hook mentions to [[Emma Swan]] that while he was in Neverland, he spent time in the company of a group of orphans known as the Lost Boys.

=== ''[[Peter Pan & Wendy]]'' ===
The Lost Boys will appear in the live action remake and be featured as a more diverse cast of children that includes girls and boys. Slightly is now a child with Down syndrome, Nibs is biracial, the twins are African American girls, Cubby (reverted back to Curly) is a girl, and Tootles is African-American. Additionally two new Lost Boys were added. '''Birdie''', who is a Chinese-American girl, and '''Bellweather''', who is a Latino boy.<ref>[https://thedisinsider.com/2021/05/11/actors-for-peter-pan-wendy-lost-boys-revealed/ Actors for ‘Peter Pan & Wendy’ Lost Boys Revealed]</ref>

==Video games==
===''[[Peter Pan: Adventures in Never Land]]''===
The Lost Boys play supporting roles in the game, with the Twins often giving Peter the latest danger from Captain Hook, which leads to the latest mission, while the rest of the Lost Boys are locked in cages by Captain Hook, each of them hidden in a level of the game. It is worth mentioning that this is the only appearance of Tootles speaking.

===''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]''===
[[File:Lost Boys.png|right|200px]]
10 years before [[Sora]] ever landed upon [[Captain Hook]]'s [[Jolly Roger|ship]] in Neverland on his search for his friends [[Riku]] and [[Kairi]], Peter Pan and Tinker Bell lived there with his mischievous team of playmates, the Lost Boys. Together they spent their days in endless bliss. That is, until, Keyblade warriors, [[Terra]], [[Aqua]], and [[Ventus]], each visited the world. The Lost Boys, including Peter Pan, were awestruck by the foreign heroes, having many conversations with them. They were seen on a treasure hunt with Aqua, as well as making her their "mother". They are also seen with Terra while he explores Neverland in allegiance with Captain Hook.

===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===
Only Cubby appears in this game during the ''Peter Pan's Flight'' mini-game. In the story, he is kidnapped by the pirates but fortunately, is rescued by Peter Pan and the player. Although he is the only Lost Boy to appear, Nibs' costume is available at the shops.

==Trivia==
*In the original novel, the Lost Boys leave Neverland and are adopted by Wendy's parents, while in the Disney version, the Lost Boys remained on Peter Pan's side in Neverland (though the idea of them returning to London alongside Wendy was addressed). Wendy also marries one of them according to the novel; though whom is never stated. In an early version of the book, Wendy married Tootles.
*In the novel, it is mentioned that there were many Lost Boys that died. Most deaths were from the war against Captain Hook and other villains; however, Peter himself would 'thin them out' if they seem to be growing up, which is against (Peter's) rules.
*In the novel, Cubby is actually named Curly, being changed to reference his bear outfit.
*All of the Lost Boys are very handy with a slingshot. While they all use different weapons throughout the two movies, Slightly is shown to have a weapon called the "Skullbuster", which is a long stick with a slingshot attached to the front of it.
*Although they were not named in the original film, the Lost Boys' real names were revealed for the first time in ''Return to Neverland''.
*A minor inconsistency with Slightly is that his fox costume in ''Return to Neverland'' is a one-piece one, while in ''Peter Pan'' he wears a two-part one. Merchandise of his often depicts him with his ''Return to Neverland'' costume, but other merchandise shows him in his original costume.
*While all the Lost Boys are very close and get along well, they do often shove each other around engage in fights against each other. Examples include when Slightly kicked Cubby and the Twins into a wall, thinking that Cubby had hit him on the head with a club. Another example was when they were all trying to take credit for knocking the "Wendy Bird" out of the sky, and they all began to fight, only to be broken up by Peter.
*Even though they are simply wearing animal costumes, the Lost Boys can move the tails and ears on each one.
*The names of some of the Lost Boys are changed in some merchandise. For example, the Lost Boys Tsum Tsums give Slightly, Nibs, and Tootles different names; Foxy, Rabbit, and Skunk (respectively).
*In the [[1989]] short film, ''[[Back to Never Land]]'', Robin Williams is temporarily turned into a Lost Boy. He is very short, only coming up to Peter Pan's knee, and he wears a yellow cat costume.
*In ''Peter Pan and Wendy'', Slightly is the only Lost Boy with a disability, which is Down syndrome.
*Cubby shares his name with [[Cubby|a member of Jake's pirate crew]].
