She was [[Kuzco]]'s (then named Manco) fiancee who despite having been betrothed to him, did not like him because he was so arrogant and spoiled. However, after [[Pacha]] decided to switch places with the emperor, Nina started to fall in love with the former because she thought that "Manco" had finally become less selfish, while the emperor-turned-llama was with [[Mata (deleted character)|Mata]]. Sting wrote a duet for Pacha and Nina entitled "[[One Day She'll Love Me]]" in which the two playfully chased each other through the palace while expressing their feelings for one another.
