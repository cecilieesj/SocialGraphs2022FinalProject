==Appearances==

===''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''===
The circus animals are first seen physically during the musical number "[[Look Out for Mr. Stork]]" where a flock of storks delivers baby newborn animals to their mothers, except for [[Mrs. Jumbo]] who did not receive a baby at night. As [[Casey Junior]] is being loaded to bring the [[Circus|WDP Circus]] to the next spot where the circus will perform at, the circus workers get the animals ready and just after that, the [[Ringmaster]] calls in Casey to get him ready for the next show to perform. Casey then travels very far and stops at the spot where the workers set up the circus tent to get the animals and performers ready for the circus. The following day, various circus animals are seen during the circus parade and later during during the part where the barkers are telling visitors to take a look at Dumbo. They are last seen during the musical number "[[Baby Mine]]" where several parent animals are sleeping with their offspring. No other circus animals aside from Dumbo, Timothy, and the circus elephants, appear throughout the remainder of the film.

|-|Giraffe=
A giraffe was seen sleeping at the beginning of the film. When a bundle of a giraffe calf flew in, it licked his newfound mother on her nose, waking her up. When the baby escaped from the bundle, he wobbled slightly on his legs, nuzzling his newfound. Two adults and the baby are seen again walking in their car when the circus is packing, with the adults sticking out. Then, one night, the train stops in town, waking them up. In the "[[Baby Mine]]": scene, the mother and her baby are sleeping soundly.

|-|Tigers=
A tigress seen at the beginning of the film was sleeping while her mate is pacing restlessly around. Then a bundle dropped in and four tiger cubs scurried out toward the tigress' stomach, licking it as a fifth one jumped out onto her tail, waking her up. She nuzzles them as their father looks on with admiration. Three adults are seen in their own car during the circus packing scene. During the parade, the same three are seen enjoying an afternoon siesta.  During "Baby Mine", the tigress and three of her cubs are sleeping, one of them yawning and stretching before going back to sleep. The other two are either with their father or in another cage to sleep.

A brown bear is first seen at the beginning of the film. She is sleeping as a bundle lands in her cage and opens to reveal a bear cub.

She and her cubs are seen in their car during the circus packing scene.

At the parade, a hippo, possibly the mother, is yawning as it carries the calliope. During "Baby Mine", the mother and her baby are sleeping soundly in their pool.

==Trivia==
*Most of the animals have four fingers instead of five like their real-life counterparts.
*The tiger trio are resting like humans in their car.
*The hippopotamuses share a strong resemblance to [[Hyacinth Hippo]]
*During "[[Baby Mine]]", the mother zebra's head is clearly drawn as a cel, but her body is drawn like the background.
*There were thirteen storks (including [[Mr. Stork]], [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]]'s deliverer) seen flying to the circus at the very beginning of the film, hinting that there are indeed thirteen species featured there, with each stork delivering a baby for them.
*The bear wagon changes color when the camera zooms toward it: in the wide view of the circus train, it is green, but up close it is red. The same is true with the circus worker's uniform when he is fastening it to the wagon.
*The hippos in "Baby Mine" were clearly both drawn as backgrounds instead of cels.
*The hyenas appear to be striped ones, which are real-life, yet lesser-known cousins to spotted ones.
*During the song "[[On the Open Road]]" in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', the giraffes look similar to the ones from here.
*The gorilla's roar has the same sound as the beetles in ''[[Mickey's Garden]]''.
*The camels appear to be Bactrian ones, as they have two humps which in real life Bactrian ones have.
*During the final scene of [[Dumbo (2019 film)|the 2019 film]], all the animals including [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] and [[Mrs. Jumbo]] were sold to the wild in [[India]] because the circus is being re-established with a new rule about wild animals. The only ones that aren't done so are the monkey, a horse, the mice, and [[Timothy Q. Mouse]].
*In real life, hyenas and hippos are not kept in circuses, because they cannot be trained.
*The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus once had a gorilla named '''Gargantua''' but it was used only for exhibition in his cage as gorillas cannot be tamed.
*A lion in the trailer is one of the circus animals that don't appear in the remake. Other animals that don't appear in the remake include tigers, zebras, giraffes, kangaroos, ostriches, camels, hippopotamuses, gorillas, and hyenas.
**The animals that didn't appear in the original are snakes, dogs, pigeons, crocodiles, and wolves while the rabbit is mentioned.
