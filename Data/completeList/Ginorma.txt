'''Ginorma''' is an antagonist in ''[[The 7D]]'' season 2 episode "[[Game of Grumpy]]". A giant woman, she was soon to be [[King Groucharooney]]'s bride, until she was part of a plot to overthrow Grumpylvania with the ice stormers, and she revealed herself as the Ice Queen from Beyond the Fence.
==Trivia==
*Ginorma is essentially a combination of the two main villains of the ''[[Frozen]]'' franchise, [[Ingrid]] and [[Hans]]. Like Ingrid, Ginorma is a powerful, beautiful, and evil ice queen. And like Hans, Ginorma is a handsome royality from a large family who pretends to be a hero while actually being a villain.
