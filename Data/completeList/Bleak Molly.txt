[[File:Bleak_Molly's_poem.jpg|thumb]]'''Bleak Molly''' is the only female member in the [[Goth Fish]] group in ''[[Fish Hooks]]''.

==Personal life==
When [[Razor V. Doom|Razor]] gets [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] to join their group, they hold a meeting in the library. Razor said that when they read the poem, there will be no judgments, then told Bleak Molly to read her poem. Molly recites her poem in a very deep voice: "Dear Rainbows, please hang up and try your call again, for I am busy." Razor breaks his promise to Molly and says that he has seen better poetry on a bubblegum wrapper, after which he scolds her for a blonde hair on her head, which embarrasses her so much that she runs away screaming. ("[[The Dark Side of the Fish]]")
