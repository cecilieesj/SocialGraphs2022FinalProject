==History==
Dolores is a mermaid detective who worked undercover for a time as the principal of [[Jake Long|Jake]]'s [[Millard Fillmore Middle School|junior high school]]. She acted as a school administrator before [[Hans Rotwood]] took over the job, noting that she saw Jake more often than her own secretary. Though initially appearing to be a paraplegic, she was revealed to be an undercover mermaid detective seeking out the [[Kelpie]]. She also developed a relationship with [[Luong Lao Shi|Lao Shi]], but left once her assignment was finished, much to their mutual regret.
