She is a bald eagle which works for the [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|O.W.C.A.]] Her base is supposedly located near where [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]]' grandparents live, as this is where her "nest" is located. She made her debut in the episode "[[The Ballad of Badbeard]]".
==Role in the series==

Agent E (full name: Agent Eagle) came soaring down after [[Perry the Platypus|Agent P]] is unable to open up one of the secret passageways to his lair located in the area. She then took Agent P to her nest where [[Major Monogram]] communicates to Agent P through a small TV hidden in one of her eggs. Agent E then put worms into her nest, confirming that she is female and that she is expecting the other eggs to hatch soon. She then dropped Agent P off at the docks and isn't seen from again until near the end of the episode, where she swoops down and rescues Agent P and [[Candace Flynn|Candace]], although she may not have realized this from [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]]'s island, which had been set to self-destruct. Like most [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|Agents]] in the series, the first name of Agent E is never mentioned. Since she has a nest, it is thought that she is a female.

Also she once had the duty of hand-cuffing Agent P, along with another agent, due to Perry's supposedly poor behavior over the past weeks. However, Perry tricked them into hand-cuffing themselves, then ejected himself off the chair and the agents ran after him. ("[[Cheer Up Candace]]")

It also seems that during Christmas vacation, Agent E and the other agents with Major Monogram and [[Carl Karl]] have a Christmas party. ("[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!]]")
