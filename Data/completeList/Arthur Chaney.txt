'''Arthur Chaney''' is a basketball coach in the [[1997]] Disney live-action film, ''[[Air Bud]]''.

==Air Bud==
Arthur Chaney was an NBA player for the New York Knicks (possibly one of the first African-American NBA players) until he retired years later and eventually became a school engineer for Fernfield School. He then became the new Timberwolves basketball coach after [[Coach Barker]] was fired and did not appreciate any bad sportsmanship and [[Larry Willingham|Larry]] showing off.

As the new basketball coach, Chaney starts implementing changes in the team, including benching Larry during a game for constant ball-hogging. Angry by Chaney's decision, [[Buck Willingham]], Larry's overbearing father, forces Larry to leave the team.Â 

During the court custody, Coach Chaney suggested [[Judge Cranfield]], whom is a fan of Chaney, decide that [[Buddy]] will choose who will be his rightful owner.
