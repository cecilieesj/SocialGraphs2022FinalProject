The '''Mare of the Mist''' is a flying horse who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[Sofia the First]]''. 

==Role in the Series==
The Mare of the Mist first appears in "[[The Mystic Isles: The Mare of the Mist]]" when Princess Sofia, Skye, and Minimus arrive in her part of the Isle of the Unicorns. The two horses end up scaring her to the point where she flies off. When Sofia finally catches up, she introduces herself and asks for one of her hairs as the bowstring for her WhichWay Bow. The Mare tells her she know who she is, but that she won't give her one of her hairs due to Sofia making the choice to leave her old friend Minimus behind in favor of her new friend Skye, a decision she felt was wrong, and tells her, "Only the true of heart are worthy of having one of my hairs." and leaves. Sofia comes back to her with Minimus and asks for a hair again. Due to sensing that Sofia has learned true-heartedness, the Mare gives her a hair and tells her to use it wisely.
