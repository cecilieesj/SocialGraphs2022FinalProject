==Appearances==
===''[[G-Force]]''===
Juarez is a black-gray female guinea pig with white fur on her mouth and nose and along to the top of her forehead, hands, and from around her neck down to her stomach in a somewhat hourglass shape. On one scene, it is known that she has a Facebook page. Because of the way Juarez looks, [[Blaster]] is known attracted to her. When Juarez is speaking to herself as she types to somebody on Facebook, you can hear her say to always keep men that like her guessing. At the end of the movie, when Blaster asks who Juarez really is attracted to, him, or [[Darwin]], she says that she likes it just the way it is, as in when Darwin and Blaster are trying to figure out (guess) who she likes. It is not unknown how Juarez got her rectangle earrings on after she escaped from Penny that put clothes, makeup, and lipstick on Juarez.
