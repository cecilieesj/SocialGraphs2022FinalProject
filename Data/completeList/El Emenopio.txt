==Background==
Many years ago, there was a running of the bulls festival, with three bulls running through the streets bringing happiness and joy, until El Emenopio shows up, angry for being uninvited and starts destroying the city. Then [[Monterey Jack|Monty]] shows up and fights and defeats him by throwing him on a ship with fish in it. What really happened is that Monty tried to run away from El Emenopio with cheese. He ran into a merchant and dropped the cheese, causing El Emenopio to slip and fall to the ship, making the mice residents believe that Monty defeated the bull.

==Appearance==
El Emenopio is a large, muscular bull with black skin with cream brown chest. The end of his horns are gray while most parts are white. Additionally, he wears a nose ring.

==Personality==
El Emenopio is known to be the meanest bull in all of [[Spain]], For being uninvited to a festival that was held many years ago, he gets angry and starts destroying the city.

==Role in series==
When the Rescue Rangers go to an alley to save the three bulls from the flashback, who have been kidnapped, they run into El Emenopio, who wants to get revenge on Monty. Everyone except [[Chip and Dale|Dale]] gets inside a building. After Monty tells everyone the real story of how El Emenopio was defeated, Chip sees Dale trying to attack El Emenopio. When the bull wakes up, he tries to attack the chipmunks. [[Gadget Hackwrench|Gadget]] builds a matador disguise for everyone to fight El Emenopio. After defeating the bull, the Rescue Rangers take the other bulls back to the city. While the Spanish mice congratulate the Rescue Rangers, especially Monty, El Emenopio shows up tired and wants to continue to fight. Monty walks up to him and pokes him, making him lie down unconscious.
