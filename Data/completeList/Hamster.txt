== Trivia ==
* His name is a play on "Hansel" in Hansel and Gretel.
* Hamster is similar to Ferb Fletcher in a few ways:
** Both don't talk as often as the protagonist (Gretel and Phineas), only providing dialogue for comic relief.
** Both are stoic and rarely emote, and sport neutral expressions most of the time.
