'''Haley Long'''<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/characters/haley.htm</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0070649/?ref_=tt_cl_t1</ref> is [[Jake Long|Jake]]'s intelligent, goody-two-shoes seven-year-old little sister. She is featured in the animated television show, ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

==Background==
===Powers and Abilities===
Haley possess all the abilities of a young dragon her age. Like her brother Jake, they have yet to reach their full potential. Instead of going into a situation without a strategy she always thinks of a plan needing little to no violence. She also always manipulates her enemies into giving up. Although she was not as strong as Jake or older dragons she was way faster.

==Role in the [[American Dragon: Jake Long|series]]==
[[File:Haley1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Haley as she appears in Season One.]]
Like her brother Jake, Haley possesses dragon powers. A prodigy in everything else, her dragon heritage, while not yet fully developed, started to express itself at a much earlier age than Jake did. Part of that may be due to dragon girls developing their powers much earlier than boys, as her mother [[Susan Long]] explained. Haley takes pride in exposing Jake's mischievous behavior to their parents, as well as showing off her own "superior" talents. At first only able to express isolated parts of her dragon form, such as her claws, snout, wings, or tail, after about a year she was already able to perform a full-body morph into her adolescent dragon form. These skills prompted her to begin her own dragon training under Sun Park's guidance as to the reserve or substitute American Dragon should Jake be unable to fully perform his duties. Haley took many aspects of her training with Sun Park and applied them in her daily life, which put her at odds when compared with average and normal human kids her age.

Haley also takes delight in making her brother look less than competent as a dragon. However, like most troublesome siblings, she actually has a deep-rooted respect for Jake, and when she was required to step up and take on the duties of Substitute American Dragon for two weeks, she finally and fully realized exactly what all her brother had to deal with on a daily basis. After nearly having her "perfect" school performance levels drop drastically and nearly suffering a breakdown, Haley openly admitted that Jake had been for his age doing a far better job balancing his human life against his magical duties than she was able to do and that the adults needed to "step off" and allow him the chance to occasionally be a teenage boy.

Just before that, Haley had been so concerned with being a good girl that she has never intentionally gotten in trouble or broke rules; that doing something bad was against her nature. Something she did one day by completely breaking character to live a day as a bad girl, and is reaping the consequences learned the value of balancing fun with her ridged life.

She was present when [[Rose]] betrayed Jake before in turn destroying the Huntsclan. She also took part in the final battle against the Dark Dragon in Hong Kong, when her father learned the truth about his dragon daughter and family. Showing how far she had grown in just two years, Haley was able to be happy for her older brother, cheering when he was reunited with Rose in the aftermath of banishing the Dark Dragon though a magical portal which would not open again for a thousand years.

==Trivia==
*In the season one intro, Haley plays the tambourine in Jake's imaginary band.
*She is shown to be much stronger than Jake, easily defeating him physically in the episode "Haley Gone Wild"
*She was named after Haley's Comet because her mother said that she loved the name "Haley" while still dating Jonathan.<ref>[[Hero of the Hourglass]]</ref>
*Concept sketches show that Haley was originally going to be named Brittany.{{Citation needed}}
*She somehow knows who Chang is in Season Two, despite not meeting Chang in Season One.
**Not a surprise, she was being trained by Sun Park to be the Substitute American Dragon, so surely her studies explained who former Councilor Chang was.
*In Season One, Haley is suggested to be a purple dragon, as she transforms certain parts of her body, which were purple and draconian, but never entirely became a dragon. In Season Two, her full body form was shown to be a pink dragon.
**It is unknown if Haley could fully transform early on. It may have been she was not physically mature enough, or her mother and or grandfather told her not to do so at the house. The latter is supported by Mrs. Long scolding her for changing her hands to claws to chop vegetables.
**In one episode,<ref>[[The Legend of Dragon Tooth]]</ref> Haley changes completely for the first and last time during Season One. This time, the viewers see that she has a long dragon neck, lighter purple underbelly, and darker purple spikes on her back as Jake has.
**She was later named after Eminem's daughter, Hailie Jade, due to executive producer, Eddie Guzelian, being a big fan of the rapper.
