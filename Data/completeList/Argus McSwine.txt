}}'''Argus McSwine''' is an enemy of [[Scrooge McDuck]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He appears in many stories, both by [[Carl Barks]] and others. Sometimes he has the [[Beagle Boys]] working for him. His first appearance was in ''Forbidden Valley'', published in ''[[Donald Duck Four Color|Donald Duck]]'' #54.

==Comic History==
McSwine has appeared in many Egmont-produced Disney stories in which he antagonizes Donald more than he does Scrooge. Argus is a lot like Neighbor Jones in this functionâ€”except that he does not live next door to Donald, and is often a crook or con man (whereas Jones is generally on the side of law and order). Often portrayed as rich, McSwine sometimes competes with Scrooge for some type of prize in much the way that [[Flintheart Glomgold]] or [[John D. Rockerduck]] also do. Argus is in fact one of the most evil villains in the Scrooge stories, having openly shot at the ducks and threatened them with harm in a manner that the Beagle Boys rarely do.

From the 1950s to the 1980s, McSwine had no consistent name and was known only as "the pig villain", going by a number of one-time aliases including '''John the Con''' and '''Porkman De Lardo'''. The last name McSwine comes from Carl Barks' ''Donald the Milkman''. In 1990, then-editor Bob Foster published that story for the first time in the USA. At the same time, the decision was taken that McSwine should be the character's "real" name, with the first name Argus being added at the same time. Thus the pig villain has remained Argus McSwine in many other stories through [[2010]], with only the occasional alias used in more modern times (such as '''Lardo J. Porkington''' in Lars Jensen's ''The Nest Egg'').

==Television appearances==
===''[[DuckTales]]''===
Argus McSwine only appears in the episode "[[Spies in Their Eyes]]", under the name '''Victor Luzer'''. This was his only film appearance, at which he was voiced by Bernie Kopell.

He worked with the spy, [[Cinnamon Teal]], where they hypnotized Donald Duck into stealing a computer link from the Navy's secret sub. After Luzer betrayed her, she helped [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his nephews prove that Donald was innocent.
