"Tank" Muddlefoot''' is a character in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''. He is [[Honker Muddlefoot|Honker]]'s older brother and [[Herb and Binkie Muddlefoot|Herb and Binkie]]'s son.

==Background==
Tank Muddlefoot is the eldest son of [[Herb and Binkie Muddlefoot]]. Tank is a bully who often makes life difficult for his neighbor [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Drake Mallard]] and his younger brother [[Honker Muddlefoot|Honker]]. In the Negaverse, Tank is well-mannered and smart like Honker.

Tank only appears in the first ABC Saturday morning season and during the Fall run of the syndicated series (contrary to what many sources claim, the syndicated run of Darkwing Duck ran staggered from September of [[1991]] to May of [[1992]], with Fall, Winter, and Spring batches of episodes). He appeared in 14 episodes before producer Tad Stones - finding the character redundant - dropped him from the show. The last episode he appears in is "[[It's a Wonderful Leaf]]", though he later made brief appearances in [[Darkwing Duck (Boom! Studios)|both]] [[Darkwing Duck (Joe Books)|volumes]] of the revival comic book.

==Trivia==
*Tank is very similar to the bully [[w:c:simpsons:Nelson Muntz|Nelson]], frenemy of [[w:c:simpsons:Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[w:c:simpsons:Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] from ''[[wikipedia:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]''.
