'''Quentin Fitzwaller''' is a [[Walt Disney World]] security guard and antagonist in ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]''. He was played by Charles Grodin. Out of fear of having to scrape spearmint off of park benches for the rest of his career, he enlists [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] to help track down the members of "[[The Muppets]]", who have neglected to pay the price of admission for the theme park.

Though he manages to catch the "Kismet Gang" and turn them over to [[Mickey Mouse]], he was seen in the "[[We're Not Gonna Stop]]" song scraping spearmint from the bottom of the benches.
