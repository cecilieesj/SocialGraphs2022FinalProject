Grey appears in the episode [[Aftermath]]. He could be seen waiting with Depa Billaba for her padawan to bring reinforcements. This leads to Grey asking her if Caleb would return which she told him he will. When Caleb arrived with 5 clone troopers, Grey thinks they will lose. Grey could be seen using a pair of electrobinoculars to watch The Bad Batch destroying the Separatist droids without any help from Depa's battalion. Not long after The Bad Batch destroyed all of the Separatist droids on the battlefield, [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] executed Order 66, an order to all of the clone units to execute their [[Jedi|Jedi]] generals. Grey receives Sidious's message and telling him to execute Order 66. Grey begins to shoot his Jedi general but was overpowered by her after she sliced his blaster into half and kicked him. After Depa Billaba's death, Grey got back up and starts chasing after [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]] but failed after losing track of him.

==Trivia==
*He also appears in the 2015 Star Wars comic book called ''Kanan'' where it shows what happened to Grey after Order 66.
*His armour is different from the ''Kanan'' comic book.
**In ''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]'', his armour has green stripes while in the ''Kanan'' comic book, he has red stripes instead of green on his armour.
