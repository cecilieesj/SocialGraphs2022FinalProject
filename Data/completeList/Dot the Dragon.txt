'''Dot the Dragon''' is a [[dragon]] who appeared in the ''[[Muppet Babies (series)|Muppet Babies]]'' episode "[[Sir Kermit the Brave]]." Her full name is Belladotta of Sweaterhelm, but nobody calls her that (except her mom when she gets angry).

==Appearances==
===[[Muppet Babies (series)|Muppet Babies]]===
[[Kermit]] and Dot overcome their fear of the dark together and sing [[What's So Scary About the Dark?|a song]] about their newfound confidence. Dot later reappeared in "[[The Spoon in the Stone]]" in a speaking role, and made several silent cameos in "[[Kermit's Big Show]]" and "[[Puppy for a Day]]" during song montages, as well as fast asleep in "[[Gonzo's Clean Sweep]]."Her appearance is based on dragon action figures that the kids regularly play with, such as in the beginning of the episodes "Sir Kermit the Brave" and again in "[[Chicken Round-Up]]."
