'''Trolls''' mostly act as antagonists in ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. All the characters are scared of the trolls except for [[Mother Bear]] who is able to tame these bullies. They mainly live under bridges. The only other time the Trolls where out smarted was when [[Goldie (Goldie & Bear)|Goldie]] was invisible.  In season 2, Goldie saved a Troll and it followed her in hopes of helping her out.
