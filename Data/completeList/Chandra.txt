'''Chandra''' is a character and the main antagonist of ''[[Upside-Down Magic]]''. She is the human manifestation of Shadow Magic. Chandra is portrayed by [[Yasmeen Fletcher]].

==History==

===''[[Upside-Down Magic]]''===
Chandra is seen early in the film eyeing Reina. She then becomes Reina's friend, offering to help her with her powers, to which Reina accepts. Chandra tells Reina that she is perfect. Chandra later manages to possess Reina with her shadow powers using a black book in the library, causing Reina's powers to become very strong, which leads to an incident that almost kills Nory. Chandra later takes full control of Reina and attempts to destroy Sage Academy in her true form, but Nory and the other UDM kids hold Chandra at bay and rescue Reina, while Chandra's book is revealed to still be active hinting that Chandra is still alive.

==Trivia==
* It's unknown if "Chandra" is her real name, or a pseudonym she chose as part of her human disguise.
* Though initially believed to only possess Upside-down magic users, it's heavily implied that the Shadow Magic actually favors Flares as potential targets to possess, since both of her previous vessels, Reginald and Reina, are users of this type of magic (with Reginald coincidentally being a UDM at the same time), and she impersonate a flare student while manipulating Reina.
