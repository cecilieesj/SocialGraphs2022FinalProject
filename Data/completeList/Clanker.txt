==Background==

===Personality===
Under command of [[Davy Jones]], Clanker is shown to be wicked and sinister to other intruders who invade the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''. He also showed a grudge towards [[Will Turner]] as he prepares to attack, threatening him to walk the plank. When Will becomes the captain of the ''Flying Dutchman'', Clanker reforms and adapts to his new life when he reverts to his human form.

===Physical Appearance===
Clanker bears a more human-like appearance compared to many other crew members who have characteristics of sea creatures. This possibly indicates that he is a new addition to the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.

As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Clanker has characteristics of sea creatures - his face covered in barnacles and mussels, his left eye being completely covered, seaweed in place of hair under his algae-covered hat while sea anemones grew from his left shoulder.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' with help from [[Tia Dalma]], Clanker is introduced when he approaches [[Will Turner]], threatening him to walk the plank just as he and the other crew members corner Will. The ambush briefly pauses when [[Davy Jones]] tells [[Will Turner]] if he fears dangers, trying to offer the crew a trap. When Jones asks Will about what his purpose is, he explains that [[Jack Sparrow]] sent him to settle his debt just as Jones and the crew corner Jack Sparrow who is to have his debt paid to the ''Dutchman'' just as Jones explains that Jack has a three-day deadline to complete the bargain of one-hundred souls to which Jack accepts his offer while Jones allows the crew to leave just as Jack has ninety-nine more souls left to harvest before the deadline.

Clanker and the rest of the crew later heave together to get the cannons ready on the ship. During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Clanker plays the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.

The next day, Clanker and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Clanker and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Just as Clanker and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Clanker and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. Successfully opening the chest containing the Heart of Davy Jones, Clanker and the crew fight against Jack's crew just as Jack and his crew plan to escape from the crew and return to the ''Black Pearl''. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Clanker and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Clanker returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Clanker and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Clanker and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Clanker and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men only for Jack Sparrow to fight against Davy Jones.

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Clanker and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==Trivia==
*The [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|video game adaptation of ''At World's End'']] erroneously identifies Clanker as "Quartermaster"; this is an error as the ''Dutchman'' has its own Quartermaster.
