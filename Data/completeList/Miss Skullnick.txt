|quote= |alignment = Neutral}}'''Miss Margaret Skullnick''' is a teacher at [[Echo Creek Academy]] who doesn't take her job seriously. She also appears to have a short temper, as she snaps at [[Marco Diaz|Marco]] when he asks if he needs a hall pass to go to the principal's office.

She was once human, but now she is a Troll after [[Star Butterfly|Star]] transformed her by accident so she could get a better grade.
