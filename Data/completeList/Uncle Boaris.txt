'''Uncle Boaris''' is a Russian ballet dancer and [[Pumbaa]]'s uncle from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series. He makes his only appearance in the episode "[[Russia Hour]]".

==Background==
===Personality===
Much like his nephew, Uncle Boaris has a friendly personality, as shown when he greets his company with strong hugs.

===Physical Description===
Uncle Boaris hardly bears any resemblance to his nephew, as he stands on two legs and wears clothing, such as a pinkish shirt, a reddish bowtie, a black Russian hat, and a monocle over his left eye. Further distancing him from resembling Pumbaa is the fact that he sports greenish skin, a mustache underneath his snout, and large eyebrows. He has a normal-sized right eye with a white cornea, and an enlarged left eye with a reddish cornea and a beady iris.

==Role in the series==
In the episode, [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] travel to Russia to meet Pumbaa's uncle, Uncle Boaris. Along with the way, Pumbaa tells his friend that he wants to make a good impression with him. When they arrive at his door after climbing a height of stairs, Boaris opens the door, smashing it on Timon, and mistakes him for a muffler. Pumbaa informs his uncle that the "muffler" is actually his best friend. After giving the two a tight hug, Boaris informs them that his ballet shows are not as successful as they used to be, but he plans to have a final performance tomorrow. When he practices for his show before the two, he slips on caviar Timon had thrown on the floor just moments before (after he found out it was fish eggs rather than bug larva) and falls down the long stairway, breaking every bone in his body. Next, Boaris ends up in a hospital and suggests to his nephew that he fills in for him.

When Pumbaa fails to follow in his uncle's footsteps at a performance of ''Swine Lake'', Timon stalls for time by doing a stand-up comedy act. Suddenly, the audience cheers when Boaris, supposedly having fully recovered, appears onstage. When Boaris finishes his act (with help from Timon), the audience triumphantly praises the performance, with Timon and Pumbaa in amazement. When asked by Pumbaa how he recovered so fast, his uncle replies that he didn't recover at all, and his body suddenly cracks into pieces. It is unknown if he perishes or not.

==Trivia==
*He is the first relative of the duo to be Pumbaa's uncle. The second uncle to appear in any ''[[The Lion King|Lion King]]'' continuity is [[Uncle Max]], Timon's uncle.
*His name is a pun on the word boar.
