The Snooty Flamingos wake up in the morning and start their swimming practice. The other Flamingos realize [[Yo Yo Flamingo|Yo Yo]] is playing with his toy and force him to swim with them. While swimming, Yo Yo plays with his toy again and the other Flamingos realize and a chase follows. Yo Yo manages to fool the Snooty Flamingos and traps them in a log. The Snooty Flamingos free themselves and push Yo Yo to drown him underwater. They then throw his yo-yo into a tree and shake feet, believing they have won. They end up being tied up, as it is revealed Yo Yo has hundreds of yo-yos as he rises from the water.
