==''Doug''==
Chalky is considerably the most athletic member of Doug's pals. He is also a very well-preforming student, and has been since he was in preschool. He is also the tallest of the main gang. While being a very well-performing athlete and student, he's really just trying to be like his older brother Cliff, whom he is often compared to.

He was a background character for most of the first season of ''Doug'' and becomes a more prominent character from the second season onward.
==''Doug's 1st Movie''==
Chalky has a very minor role in the movie. He has only one line in the entire movie, which is, "A Valentine's dance?", referring to the main event of the movie. For the rest of the film, he only appears in the background.
==Trivia==

*Early in the series, Beebe has shown interest in Chalky, and may have had a crush on him. This was never seen in the Disney series, however most fans romantically link him with Connie.﻿
