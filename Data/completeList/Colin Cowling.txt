'''Colin Cowling''' (simply known as '''Lofty Crofty '''in the UK) is a blimp in the [[2013]] [[Disneytoon Studios]] animated feature film, ''[[Planes]]''.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Affable blimp Colin Cowling attended the prestigious Zeppelin Broadcasting School and began his career as the play-by-play voice for the Pacific Coast Balloon Races. He got his big break—so to speak—when his Eye-In-The-Sky-In-Sports weekly recap show was noticed by producers of Racing Sports Network (RSN).''<ref name="sk">[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-official-character-descriptions-casting-character-poses-hires-61766/ 'Planes' Official Character Descriptions, Casting and Character Poses (Hi-Res)]</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Planes]]''===
Throughout the film, Colin acts as the co-commentator of the Wings Around the Globe Rally alongside Brent Mustangburger, mentioning about how [[Ripslinger]] is hoping to win his fourth title, and the first time a crop duster, [[Dusty Crophopper]], is competing in the Wings Around the Globe. During the final race, Colin announces another victory for Ripslinger being inevitable, though he later witnesses Dusty Crophopper in second place trying to approach the finish line as he finally overcomes his fear of heights and defeats Ripslinger to win his first title.

==Video games==
===''[[Planes: The Video Game]]''===
Colin is not seen, but is heard commentating some of the races that the Wings Around the Globe racers participate in.

==Trivia==
*Colin is an Aaron Fullogas. His character artwork is the same of Al Oft.
*He is voiced by and modeled after [[Colin Cowherd]].
*In the United Kingdom version, he is renamed Lofty Crofty and is voiced by [[David Croft]].<ref>[http://metro.co.uk/2013/08/09/david-croft-from-formula-1-commentator-to-the-voice-of-an-airship-in-new-movie-planes-3916619/ David Croft: From Formula 1 commentator to the voice of an airship in new movie Planes]</ref> Additionally, some of Lofty's dialogue is different to Colin's (although the Blu-ray and DVD subtitles in the UK still show Colin's lines despite being changed to show Lofty's name).
**When explaining about who should be coming in second to Ripslinger, Lofty adds "the" before saying "...three-time defending champ..." Additionally, he shortens "who is" to "who's" when saying that Ripslinger is seeking to become the first four-time winner in the Wings Around the Globe.
**When Colin announces the racers coming onto the runway, he says "The racers are making their way to the runway." Lofty instead says "Here come the racers onto the runway."
**After the first leg starts, Colin says "The winner of the leg today is the first to take off tomorrow." Lofty instead says "The winner of today's leg will be the first to take off tomorrow." Also, Lofty says "Well" before saying "That's right, Brent."
**During the Germany to India leg, Colin says "Brent, this could be Crophopper's leg, all the way." Lofty instead says "Brent, this is a leg made for Crophopper."
*In the Polish version, he is called Karol Kozak.
**In the Polish version, Brent Mustangburger calls him the Zimoch Editor in a certain scene.
***This is a reference to the name of Tomasz Zimoch, the Polish actor who gave the voice of Colin/Karol in the Polish version.
