|quote = |children=[[Flick Duck]] (son)}}'''Shirley Duck''' is a character featured in the [[Playhouse Disney]] show ''[[PB&J Otter]]''. She is the mother of [[Flick Duck]]. The reason why Shirley Duck is a single parent is never stated on the series.
As Flick's sole guardian, she oftentimes has a hard time keeping her son's rambunctious personality in line. As with most other adults, Flick tends to try to maintain an air of innocent sweetness when around his mom. Having raised him, however, she knows him better than most and can be firm with him when necessary.
