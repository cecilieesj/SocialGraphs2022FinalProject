While Woo doesn't appear in the series, his name is visible as one of the contacts on [[MelindaÂ May|Melinda&nbsp;May]]'s phone, in the episode "[[Face My Enemy]]".

====''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''====
Woo plays a larger role in the film. In the film, he was the agent assigned to keep an eye on Scott Lang, who was under house arrest following the events of "Captain America: Civil War". Scott explains that, in order to keep himself entertained under house arrest, he learnt magic tricks, such as pulling a card out of thin air. This amazed Agent Woo, who was later seen trying to learn it himself. The film closes with Agent Woo taking Scott's ankle bracelet off, for having served his time. During the film, he tells Scott he is also a youth pastor.

====''[[WandaVision]]''====
Jimmy Woo appears in the [[Disney+]] series, where it shows he still works with the F.B.I. He makes his first physical appearance in the [[We Interrupt This Program|fourth episode]], where it shows he has been able to learn card magic since the events of ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''. He has been sent to [[Westview]] since, not only did a person in witness protection go missing, but every one who knew them do not even remember their existence. When talking to [[Monica Rambeau]], he explains he grew up in Bakersfield, CA. When Monica gets sucked into the town, he calls in the F.B.I. and [[S.W.O.R.D.]] to help with the investigation. This leads to him meeting Doctor [[Darcy Lewis]]. Across the next couple of days, Lewis discovers what is happening inside the town, and they try to communicate with [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]], revealing that it was Agent Woo on the radio in the [[Don't Touch That Dial|second episode]]. As Woo and Darcy continue watching what is happening in Westview, Woo admits that he would like to be a father. Monica is then blasted out of Westview by Wanda, so Woo, Darcy and the agents of S.W.O.R.D. rush to help her.
