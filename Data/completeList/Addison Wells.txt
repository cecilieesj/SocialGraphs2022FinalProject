==Biography==
===Early Life ===
She was born sometime in 2003 in Seabrook to Missy (A-Mishanta) and Dale Wells. When Addison was born, she appeared with natural white hair for some reason, that we now know is because she's an alien and since she had no contact with her people, her hair lost its color. But at the time, the doctors had no idea why her hair was white. The doctors thought she might have a disease or something. Addison started wearing a blonde wig to hide her real hair. She had to wear a wig via her parents orders so that the people of Seabrook don't make fun of her or be prejudiced to Addison because her natural hair color. Addison also mentioned that she wanted to be a member of the cheer squad when she was a child.

===[[Zombies (film)|''Zombies'']]===
Addison is first seen in her room, practicing cheering in front of a large mirror. She reveals that she has to hide her real hair under a blonde wig thus she has a hard time fitting into the community of Seabrook, which is obsessively "perfect" and against anything flawed. Addison starts off her first day of school with a healthy breakfast. She is in her kitchen and eating a bowl of fruit and has a glass of water. Her parents are also in the kitchen talking about how excited they are about cheer tryouts. They are very supportive of her with sports. Her dad is the chief of the “Zombie Patrol” as he is seen with a pin that states that. Her mom is being re-elected for mayor, so it is very important that Addison makes the cheer squad. They tell that nothing will stop her as long as she keeps her wig on.

Once she arrives to Seabrook High, she is super excited about the school year. Her cousin and captain of the cheer squad, Bucky and his co-captains, Stacey, Lacey and Tracey, also know as the ACEYS, tell her that they can't let zombies change the way things are in town. Addison admits that they're just going to school like the humans which Bucky admonishes that zombies are nothing like humans and they tried to kill their grandfather, even though Addison admits that it was just a "small bite." There she meets another cheer hopeful; Bree and they bond over their love for cheer.

The Z-Alarm suddenly goes off as someone spotted a zombie in the halls, Addison tries to calm an anxious Bree down by showing her the Zombie Safe Room and that it'll be alright. Bree runs away screaming from her, due to Bree seeing one when Addison had her back turned. Addison decides to go into the room herself, only to find out that she's not alone, a boy is inside as well. The two of them begin a friendly conversation about their goals for the school year and the boy introduces himself as Zed. After Addison introduces herself, the lights turn on and is shocked to find out that Zed is a zombie. Horrified, Addison punches Zed in the face, only to find him in pain. Addison immediately apologizes explaining that her parents always taught her that zombies are dangerous but as she looks at Zed, she becomes mesmerized by how cute he is and tells him that he's not hideous at all and explains her family's hatred towards zombies as one bit her grandfather's ear off years prior. Their moment is interrupted as Bucky and the ACEYS barge into the room and Bucky reveals to Zed that Addison is his cousin and threatens him to stay away from her as he forces her out of the room.

At cheer tryouts, Addison succeeds in making the team and even convinces Bucky to add Bree on the team as a stand-in. Later that night, Bucky takes the cheer squad to Zombietown for the cheer initiation. Addison and Bree are among them and Addison becomes amazed on the neighborhood's creative skills. Her cousin give her a carton of eggs and tells her and Bree to egg one of the zombie's house to make them official. She and Bree refuse and Bucky and the others unintentionally ditch the duo when they get spooked by a zombie who tried to help them. Addison and Bree hide and the noise causes a zombie to see what's happening and Addison is stunned to find out the zombie house she was assigned to was Zed's house. Zed's father asks what going on and Zed replies that no one is there. He then gives Addison a disappointed look as he heads back inside. This cause Addison and Bree to see how zombies are being treated by humans and they both leave Zombietown, with Addison throwing the carton of eggs into the trash.

The next day, she confronts her cousin about his treatment towards zombies and that bullying them isn't right. Unfortunately, Bucky tells her not to question things. Shortly, Addison follows the zombies to the basement and sees that this is how they are attending school and admits that it's awful. She apologizes to a heartbroken Zed and reassures him that Bucky will not see them talking. Addison invites him and the other zombies to the pep rally later today, however one zombie sarcastically tells her zombies don't do pep rallies but Zed reassures Addison that they'll think about it and Addison leaves with a smile on her face.

While getting ready for the pep rally, Addison becomes convinced that Zed won't come, thinking that zombies attending would make serious drama. However, she becomes excited when Bree announces that there are zombies at the pep rally. Addison rushes over and is happy that they accepted her invitation and is really happy that Zed came. However, when she hears Bucky command the Aceys to get the "spirit sticks", she looks up with concern. The pep rally goes well until Bucky and the squad bring out the "spirit sticks", which are sparklers, using them to scare zombies, due to their fear of fire. One [zombie] gets terrified and runs out of the bleachers just as Addison gets tossed in the air for a trick. This cause the member who launched her scatter away, leaving Addison headed to being severely injured. However, to Addison's surprise she is caught and saved by Zed.

===[[Zombies 2|''Zombies 2'']]===
Addison's journey in Z2 was a bit disappointing for her. She thought she was the Great Alpha but she ended up being wrong. She just wanted to fit in somewhere. But, the wolves still love her and allow her to keep the moonstone necklace they gave her. But she did learn she might not entirely be human.

===[[Zombies: Addison's Moonstone Mystery|''Zombies: Addison's Moonstone Mystery'']]===
In moonstone mystery, Addison meets a girl named Vanna and immediately goes up to her and introduces herself. They quickly became friends and she invites Vanna to the cheer tryouts. Addison then gets into a small brawl with Willa who has suspicions of Vanna. After the kerfuffle, Vanna shows up and does a flip, then lands in Zed and Addison's arms, causing an earthquake. Willa blames Vanna for the earthquake, but Addison comes in and says that they're all on the same team and put's Vanna on the squad. Her friends, Willa, Wyatt, and Wynter, however, bow out (pun intended). Addison tells Vanna she's still trying to find where she belongs, to which Vanna says she'd fit right in with her family.

The next day, Addison comes into the hall and see's that her friends are acting really weird and asks Zed what's going on, however he's under the spell to and Addison begins to stress out. Willa then comes in, who hasn't been put under the spell yet, and tells her about the legends of seabrook and a secret cave hidden in the Wolf Den that could be opened if the Moonstone and a "V" shaped crystal connected. Addison pieces the facts together and learns that Vanna is a vampire. Vanna tells her and Willa that she hypnotized her friends, to which Addison says that wasn't right. Vanna agrees because she found out where the secret cave that she tried to have her friends find, as Willa read that part aloud. Vanna then transforms into a bat and takes Willa with her. Zed and Eliza show up and Addison de-hypnotizes them and questions if she could be a vampire after Eliza asks how she did it, but Zed assures her she's nothing like her. They then make a plan to stop Vanna from waking the den, which would set loose a ton of vampires into seabrook.

Later, Addison, Zed, and Eliza find that the wolves are all ready under Vanna's spell. Vanna then opens up the cave, but before the gang could get through, it closes. After convincing Zed, Addison uses her moonstone necklace to reopen the cave entrance. Vanna tries out every moonstone the wolves have to awaken her family, but they all fail. Vanna then hypnotizes Zed and Eliza again and tells her she's too late. Vanna then tries to hypnotize Addison, but it doesn't work and she's really infuriated, as no one has been immune to her powers before and asks Addison what she is. Addison says she doesn't know, to which they get physical with each other. Addison eventually manages to swipe Vanna's V-Crystal from her and tells her it's over and de-hypnotizes everyone.

Addison then helps Vanna wake up her family, even though Wynter and Wyatt told her not to, by connecting all three main power sources, the Z-Band, the moonstone, and the v-crystal. They all unite in the end and all participate in the pep rally.

===[[Zombies 3|''Zombies 3'']]===
After watching the video transmissions from the scout ship, Addison learns that her [[Angie Wells|grandmother]] was an alien scout who landed on Earth. She then finds her true self as an alien. But when she finds out, the aliens won't accept her because they claim she doesn't have their spark and she already has a lot on her plate with wanting Zed to get in the same collage as her, so they can stay together. But eventually she and everyone else relies she's a true alien, she gets her powers and her hair turns blue. She also finds out her mom was wearing a wig the whole time too because she's an alien as well. Addison eventually chooses to go with the aliens essentially forever to get them to their new home. She's sad of course for having to say goodbye to her loved ones, especially Zed, but she says it's the right thing to do for her people. A few days after she left Addison realizes the perfect place to live is Seabrook so she turns the ship around and leads her people to their new home. Addison reunites with her loved ones and shared a kiss with a very happy Zed. She then sings one last group song before the movie comes to an end.

When Addison revealed her real hair, she is the only human who doesn't boo at her, but smiles proudly her, indicating she likes her best friend's real hair.

'''[[Zed Necrodopolis]] (boyfriend/close friend)'''

Zed Necrodopolis is Addison's boyfriend. She first meets him in the Zombie Safe Room after he causes an alarm to go off. They begin a friendly conversation about their goals for the school year and introduce themselves to each other. However, when the lights come back on, Addison sees that Zed is a zombie, screams, and punches him in the face. She immediately apologizes and explains how her parents taught her that zombies were “disgusting, dead-eyed freaks,” but he “[wasn’t] hideous at all.” However, their moment gets cut off when Bucky, Addison’s cousin and Seabrook High’s cheerleading captain, barges in the safe room, along with the Acey’s, and drags her away.

Later that night after making the cheer squad, Bucky tells Addison and her new friend, Bree, to egg a zombie house, not knowing that it’s Zed’s. Addison is against the idea but after being confronted by Eliza’s mother, Addison and Bree run off and hide. Zed goes outside to check on the commotion and he sees her holding the carton of eggs. Realizing what she was doing, he’s visibly shocked. However, when Zed’s dad comes out to ask if everything was alright and if there was anyone outside, Zed says no, covering for her. After giving a disappointed look, he goes back inside. Addison immediately feels awful and throws away the carton of eggs and heads home with Bree.

The next day at school, Addison goes down to the basement where the zombie students have school and apologizes to Zed. She invites him and his friends to the pep rally, and even though Eliza immediately rejects the offer, Zed says they’ll think about it.

Later at the pep rally, Bucky and the other cheerleaders bring out sparklers to intentionally scare the zombies. Bonzo, one of Zed’s friends, gets exceptionally frightened and tries to run away, causing a few cheerleaders that had just tossed Addison in the air to run away as well. However when she falls, she’s caught by Zed.

The next day, when zombies are allowed to eat in the cafeteria, Addison catches Zed’s eye and they smile at each other. Addison is caught staring at him from across the cafeteria by Bree who asks if she’s okay. Addison says that her heart is racing and her palms are sweaty and says it’s because of Zed. Addison freaks out because she realizes she has a crush on a zombie. Zed then calls out to her from his table and waves to her, which shocks everyone, but goes unnoticed by Addison as she walks over. She tries to talk to him in zombie tongue but ultimately butchers the attempt, much to Zed’s amusement. However the Acey’s drag her away and tell her that talking to the zombies will get her sent to the reject table. Heartbroken, Addison leaves the cafeteria.

Zed follows her into the hallway and hands her the flower Bonzo had made for her. Addison apologizes for not being able to sit with him and his friends at lunch and thanks him for saving her at the pep rally. Zed talks about how if his playing on the football team goes well, zombies will be more accepted. Addison then states how hard it is to fit in a town like Seabrook. Zed asks how she would know how that feels, because to him, she’s perfect. Addison, touched, reveals that she wears a wig, with Zed being the first one outside her family to know about it. When a few students start coming into the hallway, Zed grabs Addison’s hand and runs into the Zombie Safe Room where they first met. The two perform “Someday,” where they dance and flirt with each other.

Addison cheers on Zed when he makes touchdowns during the football game. After the Seabrook team wins, she runs up to him to tell him that he was amazing. Zed praises her cheering and she hugs him.

Addison tries to hang out with Zed, but is constantly stopped by Bucky or the Acey's. Addison decides to give Zed a letter so the two can communicate. After a football game, Bonzo gives Addison a letter from Zed then hugs her and it said that Zed wants her to meet him at the barrier that night. She arrives at the barrier, seemingly very nervous about potentially getting into trouble. Zed assures her that she'll love it and takes her hand and leads her into Zombietown.

Zed takes Addison to Zombie Mash where the two dance and have fun. Later that night, after Addison meets Zed's little sister Zoey, Zed takes her to a zombie light garden where the two sing "Someday - Ballad." At the end of the song, they find themselves in an embrace and Zed notices a lock of Addison's real hair outside of her wig. When he inspects it, Addison, fearing rejection, hastily covers it. Zed tell her that it's beautiful. They gaze at each other and Zed tells her that she's beautiful. The two almost kiss, but then the Zombie Patrol arrives and Zed runs off.

Addison is escorted home by Gus, one of her father's Zombie Patrol officers and after being questioned she tells them that she was out with a boy. As a result, her parents forbid her from doing cheer until they meet Zed. The next day at school, Zed rushes to Addison and apologizes for running off. Addison assures him that it's okay and tells him about her cheerleading ban. He apologizes for making things difficult for her, but she assures him that he's done nothing wrong.

Addison tries to tell her parents the truth about Zed, however he arrives looking like a human. Her parents take an immediate liking to Zed and Addison leaves with him to go on their first date.

At the homecoming game, the Acey's hack Zed's z-band, causing him to turn full zombie and attack the crowd. After he stops himself from attacking Bucky, Addison runs to him and makes him take her hand. Addison tries to fight with the officers who are taking Zed and his friends away, but Zed tells her that it's better if they're not together, leaving them both heartbroken. Addison removes her wig, revealing her natural white hair to the stunned school. Zed smiles and stares dreamily at her as he's taken away.

Later, when Zed and Bonzo go to stop Eliza from sabotaging the cheer competition, Addison shows up and tries to encourage her. Zed is quick to remind Addison that that isn’t who she is and later joins her during the final performance (Fired Up - Competition). It’s implied that the two tell each other “I love you” in Zombie Tongue, “gar gargiza,” At the end of the movie, they are finally allowed to be together.

In Zombies 2, they go through some problems mostly because of Zed not wanting Addison to be a wolf since he didn't want her to go through the judgement he had, but they eventually make up and share their first kiss at the Prawn (Seabrook's prom)

In Zombies 3, he supports and loves that she's not human and is an alien. When Addison leaves Earth to help the aliens find their new home, Zed is the most devastated out of all their friends, but then becomes the happiest when she returns with the aliens to stay in Seabrook for good.

'''[[Eliza Zambi]] (friend)'''

Eliza didn't like Addison at first, but over time she learned not all humans are the same and they grew a great friendship.

'''[[Bonzo]] (friend)'''

'''[[Zoey Necrodopolis]] (friend)'''

'''[[Willa Lykensen]] (friend)'''

They have a great friendship at the end of Zombies 2 with Willa even letting Addison keep a wolf necklace.

In Zombies 3, their friendship is briefly shattered as Willa gets upset that Addison was essentially betraying them and helping the aliens. But, in reality she was just sad because she felt the aliens were taking Addison away. Her brother Wyatt assured her that Addison will always be apart of their pack no matter how far she goes. Willa eventually came to terms and told Addison she will always be apart of their pack too.

'''[[Wyatt Lykensen]] (friend)'''

He thought Addison was the Alpha in Z2, he was wrong but still loves Addison as a friend.

'''[[Wynter Barkowitz]] (friend)'''
