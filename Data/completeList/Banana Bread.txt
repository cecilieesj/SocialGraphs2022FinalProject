'''Winchester''', better known as '''Banana Bread''', is a minor supporting character in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated series ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Banana Bread is shown to be a very friendly individual and is most likely the most moral person as he outed [[Duncan P. Anderson|Duncan]] for trying to mess with [[Tylor Tuskmon]]. He also apparently has a very good sense of humor and could quite possibly have a better grasp at joke making than anyone else at [[Monsters, Inc. (company)|Monsters, Inc.]]

===Physical appearance===
Banana Bread physically resembles a ripening banana peel with yellow "feet" resembling the peels and the rest of his green body, or head, resembling the other end of it. He has three purple eyes that go up his "face" and his "mouth" at the top looks like the stem.

==Trivia==
*While MIFT seemed to have no problem understanding him, they did not know what his name was and called him Banana Bread due to his affinity for bringing the pastry into work. [[Ms. Flint]] on the other hand could understand him perfectly well to the point that she figured out his name.
*Even after learning his name, MIFT still continues to call him Banana Bread.
*He speaks in blowing raspberries.
*After he left MIFT, Tylor Tuskmon decided to become his replacement.
*Banana Bread makes the least appearances of all the existing Mifters.
