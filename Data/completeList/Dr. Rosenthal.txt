'''Dr. Rosenthal''' was the former head scientist of the Anti-Recess Legion in charge of manning the [[Weather-Altering Laser]].

==History==
Presumably, Dr. Rosenthal had been involved in the first official test when it failed, where he was implied to have warned his boss, [[Dr. Phillium Benedict]], about serious glitches in the system that were still prevalent.

After conducting the necessary preparations, he then informed Benedict that they were ready to conduct the second test, and upon his giving the order to fire, he then relayed the orders to activate the beam. Unfortunately for him, the second test not only failed barring moving the moon a few feet, but also caused the beam to completely shut down to the extent that the dish remained locked in place. This caused Benedict to turn on him in a fury, making very clear to Rosenthal that whatever he told him before, he did not care. Benedict then, when Rosenthal pleaded that he'll do better next time, relayed that he's going to have him detained for the failure by giving an analogy to a "repeated troublemaker", also having [[Kojak]] and an [[Secret Service Look-Alike Agents|Agent]] drag him off as he's begging for mercy, with Benedict promptly replacing him with his assistant.
