'''Sylvia Sundew''' is a supporting character in the [[2019]] series ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Sylvia is a confident woman in her older years. She is typically soft-spoken, but out going and friendly. She is not afraid to be honest about things to the point that she openly embarrasses her daughter, [[Felicia Sundew|Felicia]]. Sylvia claims to have a soft spot for the weird ones, like [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]], and it shows in her own weird ways. She likes to act up, most likely as a way to show that their is still a lot of spark in her spirit. However, she does display a lot of insight and understanding as well, such as when she knew that [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] was feeling left out of their fishing trip and told Hop Pop to be with his grandson when he was spending more time with her.

===Physical appearance===
Sylvia is a skinny light green frog with a pale yellow underbelly. Like the other frogs, she has four fingers and two toes on both her hands and feet respectively. She has grey hair that is pulled back into a long ponytail. She has pink lipstick, light pink nails and pink circles on her cheeks. Her eyes however are two tiny black dots and wears a pair of light blue glasses with pointed tips at the end.

She normally wears a plain pink dress that has a deep pink flower with a orange center on the top. In "[[Family Fishing Trip]]", she wore white sun pants, a yellow shirt and a cyan neckerchief while her hair was pulled up into a bun at the top.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Family Fishing Trip]]", Sylvia joins the Plantar family in their annual fishing trip as she had been invited by Hop Pop. Once on the trip, Sylvia and Hop Pop spend time together by steering the boat and doing some fishing, much to Sprig's frustration and jealousy as he usually spends the annual trip fishing with his grandfather.

As a result, Sprig tries to get Sylvia to leave the trip by putting hot peppers in her sandwich, a centipede in her hair, and making her slip on the ship's deck, but every attempt fails in Sylvia's favor. While playing with Hop Pop on the deck, Sylvia noticed Sprig sitting alone, looking sad as he sang a song. Feeling bad for Sprig, Sylvia suggested to Hop Pop that he spend his time with his grandson before she went over to talk to Sprig. Once she approached Sprig, she saw how tense the frog boy was and took him away to speak to him alone.

Sylvia asks Sprig something was bothering him, but he denies it. This made Sylvia thank Sprig for letting her come on the trip and reveal how she has been having a good time lately. When the boat passes by an island covered in blue flowers, Sylvia admires the blossoms and was surprised to hear from Sprig that they were Hop Pop's favorite flowers. Hearing Sprig's suggestion to get some of the flowers and give them to Hop Pop as a gift, Sylvia decides to take Sprig's suggestion and jumps off the boat to swim towards the island.

When Sprig sees Hop Pop ready to go fishing with him, Sprig realizes he had been selfish in trying to get rid of Sylvia. Just as Sprig asks Hop Pop to turn the boat to recover Sylvia, they hear her scream and Sprig, using Anne's glider, discovers the island Sylvia swam to is actually a giant hermit crab. Sprig rescues Sylvia and Hop Pop puts the boat in reverse, but the crab follows them, intending to eat Sylvia and Sprig. Just before the crab can eat Sylvia and Sprig, Sylvia kicks the crab's teeth and sends back into the sea where swims away as Sylvia swears at the crustacean, something which impresses Anne and Hop Pop.

Once Sylvia lands back on the boat, she reunites with Hop Pop and presents him a bouquet of the blue flowers she picked off the crab. However, Hop Pop reveals his favorite flowers are actually daffodils, making Sylvia realize Sprig had deceived her. At this, Sprig confesses he was jealous of Hop Pop spending time with Sylvia and apologizes to her, reassuring that Hop Pop is lucky to have her. Sylvia forgives Sprig, understanding how difficult it is to share Hop Pop. Just as she, Anne, and the Plantars decide to get back to fishing, Polly flies off on Anne's glider and Anne suggests they eat some crab, making everyone on the boat silent at Anne's suggestion.

==Trivia==
* While she playfully teased both Hop Pop and Monroe, it is obvious that she preferred Hop Pop for being "weird".
* Besides [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]], Sylvia is also considered part of the Plantar family despite not being directly related.
