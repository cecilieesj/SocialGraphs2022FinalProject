General McGuffin is a character in''' ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]''.'''
==Background==
He is first seen in "[[The It]]" as he wakes up in his fortress to an alarm going off to discover Commander Peepers and a team of Watchdogs broke in to disable his defense systems only for Wander to appear and declares Lord Hater is "it" and he and his army run away from Lord Hater off the planet thus giving Peepers an idea to use this to claim other planets.

He appears again in [[The Battle Royale]] fighting other villains for the Ring of Invincibility (which turned out to be a fake candy ring) as he is blasted by Lord Hater and resembling a KFC bucket of chicken.

He once again appears in [[My Fair Hatey]] as one of the captured villains in his KFC bucket form but then somehow escapes.
