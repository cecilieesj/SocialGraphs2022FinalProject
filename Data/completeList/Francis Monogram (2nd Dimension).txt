==Appearances==
===''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''===
Monogram first appears as Doofenshmirtz's Indentured Executive Assistant, escorting [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz-1]] to Doofenshmirtz's office via theme ride-like chair system. He later appears towards the end of the film, ordering the [[Firestorm Girls]] to arrest Doofenshmirtz after the Norm Bots were destroyed.

===''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''===
Despite Monogram being happy that Doofenshmritz is finally brought to justice, he is still somewhat upset over the loss of many of his animal agents during Doofenshmirtz's reign. Monogram later learns from [[Candace Flynn (2nd Dimension)|Candace]] that Doofenshmirtz's wife [[Charlene Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension)|Charlene]] is the one responsible for capturing the agents and turning them into cyborgs, similar to how Doofenshmirtz defeated Perry and turned him into [[Perry the Platypus (2nd Dimension)|Platyborg]]. He later attended the reunion of all the returned agents following the Doofenshmirtz family's escape.
==Trivia==
*He is an assistant as [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] revealed in an interview.
