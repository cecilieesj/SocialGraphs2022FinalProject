==Personality==
While Marianne is self-conscious, mature and cynical, Dawn is optimistic, ditzy, childish and outgoing. She is outwardly annoyed by her sister's overprotective behavior, but she still cares deeply for her. On more than one occasion, she is seen to flirt with a handful of other men, fickle over which boy she wants to pursue and even flirts with total strangers. However, she seemed completely oblivious to Sunny's crush on her, despite his obvious hints, until his cove broke the spell over her, to which she accepted his affections with open arms.

When under the influence of the love potion, Dawn becomes obsessively infatuated with the Bog King. She becomes deaf and blind to all of the Bog King's threats and acts of apathy, not minding being imprisoned and singing to him when around him or imprisoned. She follows whatever he tells her no matter what and denies her sister's rescue attempt. However, she manages to breach his walls when giving him a boutonniere, though this just barely gets a positive response from him.

While naive in certain things, she is not one to hold a grudge or any kind of prejudice, knowing about Marianne and Bog King's feelings for one another and encouraging them, showing no disdain towards Marianne for "stealing" Bog from her. 

==Powers and Abilities==
While possessing no magical abilities or combat skills, her wings do grant her the ability to fly and she as the skill of singing.
