'''Dreamweaver Kema''' is a character on the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Raven's Home]]'', and makes her only appearance in "[[Weirder Things]]". She is Raven's hair stylist, and visits her on her "weave day". She is portrayed by [[Wendy Raquel Robinson]].

==History==
Every so often, Kema visits Raven to help style her new hair. On the day of one of Raven's appointments, she arrives, whilst also babysitting her niece, Power. Raven shows Kema her hair, horrified at the mess it has become, but Kema reassures Raven, that she'll be able to fix it within five hours, requiring she has focus. While working on Raven's hair, Power asks for food, and distracted, Kema continues working on Raven's hair, mistaking the code word to stop ("home skillet biscuit"), as an offer for food. Kema later witnesses [[Chelsea Grayson|Chelsea]] arriving to the front room, delusional from her fever and breathing through her bra. Despite the various distractions, Kema manages to fix something for Raven, who ends up being dissatisfied. When Raven hears a disturbance, she runs to it, prompting Kema to tell Raven that she will stay until she gets paid, mistakenly thinking that Raven is trying get her hair done for free. Raven eventually returns, and Kema does a hai piece to her satisfaction.
