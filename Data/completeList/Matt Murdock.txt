'''Matt Murdock''' is one of [[Kenny Binder]]'s school bullies in ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]''.

==Role in the film==
Matt and his brother, [[Mike Murdock|Mike]], are [[Mayor Murdock]]'s sons. They do not enjoy [[Elizabeth (Ernest Scared Stupid)|Elizabeth]]'s classroom report about Briarville's legend of [[Trantor]] and [[Phineas Worrell]]. They later destroy Kenny's cardboard haunted house. They are eventually mistaken for trolls by [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]], but nobody believes him (especially [[Cliff Binder|Sheriff Binder]]). Matt ends up becoming one of Trantor's wooden doll at Briarville Elementary School's Halloween bash. Mike teams up with Kenny to defeat the trolls by using a squirt gun to squirt milk at some of them in order for them to disappear forever. After Ernest defeats Trantor, Matt becomes a normal person once again and reunites with his father and Mike.

==Trivia==
*The name Matt Murdock is widely known as the secret identity of the superhero [[Daredevil]].
*Like [[Jay (Hocus Pocus)|Jay]] and [[Ernie (Hocus Pocus)|Ernie]] in ''[[Hocus Pocus]]'', Mike and Matt bully Kenny before they encounter Trantor as well as other trolls, but Matt becomes one of Trantor's victims in the form of a wooden doll until Ernest defeats Trantor. Jay and Ernie bully [[Max Dennison]] before they encounter the [[Sanderson Sisters|Sanderson sisters]] while stealing candy from trick-or-treaters. They imprison them in two cages at their [[The Sanderson Sisters' Cottage|cottage]] on Halloween. Unlike Mike and Matt, Jay and Ernie do not reunite with Salem's citizens after the Sanderson Sisters disappear off the face of the Earth. They are neglected prisoners at the cottage.
