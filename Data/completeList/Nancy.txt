'''Nancy''' is a character in Disney's [[1997]] movie, ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. She is [[Bill Sikes]]' former love interest. She is considered and likes to consider herself like a mother to [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]] at times.

==Role in the film==
Nancy is first seen entering [[Fagin (Oliver Twist)|Fagin]]'s warehouse with her boyfriend, [[Bill Sikes]] and his dog, Bull's Eye to discuss business with Fagin and to get paid for a job he did last Sunday (probably a theft or a murder).

Then, Nancy meets and takes a sudden liking to [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]], an orphaned boy found on the streets by [[Dodger (Oliver Twist)|Dodger]] and taken in by Fagin. Sikes calls for her to attend further business with Fagin. So, Fagin tells his thieving boys to get outside and do their jobs; not before instructing Dodger to keep an eye on Oliver and make sure nothing happens to him.
