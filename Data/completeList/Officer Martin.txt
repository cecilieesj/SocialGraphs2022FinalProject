==Role in the film==
When [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] and [[Rhino]] sneak into the shelter to free [[Mittens]], they needed to distract Martin. Rhino managed to get the dogs' attention, thanks to his plastic ball. Hearing the dogs' constant barks, Officer Martin tries to calm them down.

Once Martin sees Rhino, the latter slips free, thanks to his plastic ball getting covered in saliva, and passes him. Martin attempts to get the trio but slips on the drool, sending Rhino into the air and hitting [[Officer Lloyd|Lloyd]]'s eye, causing a helium tank to fly out of the shelter and hit the sign, which falls onto Ester's pickup and explodes.

Once [[Officer Ester|Ester]] gets back, Martin tries to warn her but accidentally startles her instead, causing Ester to mace him, and he flops to the floor, screaming in pain about "spicy eyes".
