The '''Tiger''' is a character featured in the [[Jungle Cruise]] attractions at the [[Disney Parks]].

==History==
===Background===
The tiger is said to inhabit the ruins of an ancient temple representing Asia in the Jungle Cruise attraction. Like tigers in real life, the tiger is shown to be a solitary, but territorial predator which snarls at unwelcomed visitors who approach it.

===Development History===
Originally during the time Jungle Cruise was being developed for the [[Disneyland]] park, [[Walt Disney]] himself wanted to use real animals in this attraction. However, due to difficulties of using real animals, this idea was abandoned due to the fact that the animals Walt was thinking of would be reclusive and may not be visible for guests to see. As a change, the idea to use real animals was later changed into using animatronic animals instead where the animatronic tiger was displayed during the attraction. The tiger was one of the animals designed by [[Marc Davis]].

Due to the success of the attraction at Disneyland, the Jungle Cruise attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]], still featuring the animatronic tiger in it.

==Appearances==

===[[Jungle Cruise]]===
The tiger is seen when the boat passes through where it is seen ferocioulsy roaring in the Shir Lee Temple and other animals seen with the tiger are cobras, crocodiles, and spiders.

In the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland versions of the attraction, the tiger is located inside an indoor temple where it ferociously roars at guests like in the Disneyland iteration just as the boat explores the ruins of an ancient temple passing by cobras, monkeys, and spiders inside it just before the boat exits the temple to arrive in the elephant bathing pool area.

===[[Bengal Barbecue]]===
The tiger was also used as a logo for the Disneyland counter-serve restaurant.

===[[Jingle Cruise]]===
In the seasonal overlay of the attraction, the tiger is seen chewing on a skipper's holiday hat.

===Jungle Cruise: Wildlife Expeditions===
In Tokyo Disneyland, the tiger animatronic and the rest of the animatronic animals inside the ancient temple were removed as part of the retheming of Tokyo's version of the attraction in [[2014]]. Despite being removed from this version of the attraction, the tiger is depicted for the magical medallion known as the Tiger of Courage and during the scene where the boat enters the Shir Lee Temple, the Tiger of Courage emblem randomly appears where it is heard roaring in which after this, a magical blast is emitted in it in which an illustration of a tiger is depicted on the wall which represents ecology and nature just before the boat exits the temple to arrive at the elephant bathing pool area.
