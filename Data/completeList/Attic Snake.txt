The '''Attic Snake''' is a character that was featured in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[1993]] animated feature film, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. He is a large snake who is part of [[Jack Skellington]]'s plan to take over Christmas, which only caused a disaster in the real world until Jack saved [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]] to help him undo the mistake he did.

==Background==
The Attic Snake is a large snake with an orange and black ringed pattern to represent the common colors of Halloween.

==Role in the film==
In the film, the Attic Snake is first seen during the song "[[Making Christmas]]" where it was being prepared for [[Jack Skellington]] to take over Christmas; here, it is seen being fed by the Corpse Father who attempts to feed him a skull, but ends up getting swallowed by the snake though he manages to free himself though.

Later when Jack takes off to deliver the Christmas presents to the real world, the Snake is deployed into the living room of a house where he slithers around a white Christmas tree with red ornaments which suddenly starts getting swallowed, as a child fearfully reacts seeing the Snake while it sallows the tree 

Later at the end of the film when Jack manages to defeat [[Oogie Boogie]] and save [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]] to help him undo the wrongdoings he did, the Snake is then taken away along with the rest of the toys Jack mistakenly gave to the children during Christmas as it is shown that Santa is replacing all the Halloween-themed Christmas toys frightening children with real Christmas toys in order to make them happy.

==Disney Parks==
===[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]===
The Snake can also be seen the attic of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion Holiday and Tokyo's Haunted Mansion Holiday Nightmare. In both versions of the attraction, he is seen holding the Naughty and Nice list in his mouth as well as swallowing a present. He is also seen in one of the stretching portraits in the stretching room.

==Trivia==
*Despite his short amount screen time in the film, the Snake is sporadically featured in certain merchandises inspired by Tim Burton's ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''.
*The snake resembles the Sandworms from Tim Burton's 1988 dark-comedy, ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice Beetlejuice]''.
