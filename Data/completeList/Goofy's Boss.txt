'''Goofy's Boss''' is a minor antagonist in the [[2000]] direct-to-video film ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. He is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].
==Role in [[An Extremely Goofy Movie|the film]]==
He sees [[Goofy]] daydreaming about his son [[Max Goof|Max]] on a security camera when he is making the toys. He tells to stop daydreaming and get back to work or else he'll fire him while he zoomed the camera towards him which startled Goofy, making him drop one of the toys on the floor, breaking it. When Goofy goes to fix the toy, he accidentally pushes the quick release machine that makes it difficult to fix the toys, leading to a huge explosion and his boss firing him.

He later appears in Goofy's flashbacks during the ''Get Happy Song''.
