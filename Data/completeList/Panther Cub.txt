The '''Panther Cub''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series who makes his first and only appearance in the episode "[[Unlucky in Lesotho]]". He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. 

==Background==
===Physical Description===
The panther cub is short and small with black fur on his body, and gray fur in his ears and on his muzzle and underbelly. He has green eyes. He also has a red nose.

===Personality===
The panther cub is frisky. He is also inquisitive. This can be seen when the panther cub plays with [[Pumbaa|Pumbaa's]] tail. Additionally, the panther cub is brave, blocking [[Ned the Elephant|Ned's]] way and making him fall into the river to prevent him from embarrassing [[Timon]]. He also has a liking for milk.

==Appearances==
==="[[Unlucky in Lesotho]]"===
The panther cub was found by [[Pumbaa]], who was looking for bugs. Pumbaa then took the cub home with him, wanting to surprise [[Timon]]. However, after arriving there, Pumbaa found out that Timon was reading a book that made Timon think black cats are bad luck. 

Pumbaa then changed his mind about the panther cub and tried to hide him. Although Timon found the cub and made Pumbaa take him back, he appeared just before [[Ned the Elephant|Ned]] was about to humiliate Timon and caused him to fall into the river, thus saving Timon's reputation and becoming his friend.

==Trivia==
*The panther cub's voice actor Frank Welker voiced various other Timon & Pumbaa characters, including [[Bartholomew (Timon & Pumbaa)|Bartholomew]], [[Claudius]], and [[Uncle Ernie]].
