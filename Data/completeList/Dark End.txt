|status = Defeated}}'''Dark End''' is an alien [[Experiments|experiment]] who appeared in the third season of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime as an antagonist. Dark End was created by [[Delia]] using similar genetic blueprints to that of [[Stitch]] and required Stitch's power cell to complete his creation. It is because of this that Dark End does not fall into Jumba's numbering system. Delia made Dark End as a combatant in order to defeat Stitch.

==Background==
===Personality===
Dark End has a rather unique personality. He has a polite, playful, and carefree attitude with a twisted sense of humor. He introduced himself to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]], [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], and [[Reuben]] and offered Hämsterviel a handshake, only to lift him off floor and shake him in the air. When he met Stitch, Dark End assumed he was really nice and apologized that he had to defeat him. Dark End is penchant when it comes to manners, as when Hämsterviel ordered him to fight Stitch, Dark End refused and requested him to say it again in a polite manner. Dark End is loyal to [[Delia]] and anyone who serves under her, but even Dark End expected Delia to exhibit manners, getting annoyed when she ordered him to do something, as Dark End claimed she could have asked nicely. Despite this, Dark End obeys Delia and follows her orders through.

Despite his politeness, Dark End is vicious, brutal, ruthless, and cruel and enjoys causing chaos. His playful attitude comes off as mischievous, but he can also be sadistic; he takes joy in taunting and humiliating his foes instead of finishing them off. Dark End wanted to keep tormenting Stitch after pulling him out of the fault that Dark End created, then shaking Stitch in the air. He is also sneaky and dishonest, as he offered Stitch to be friends and a handshake, only to electrocute and toss him in the air. Dark End has no qualms on attacking anyone who gets in his way, especially children, as he was willing to attack [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] when she refused to hand Stitch over. He also fought and attacked some [[experiments]], [[Hiroman]], his soccer team, and Yuna's friends for getting in his way.

Dark End is confident in his abilities and comes off quite condescending to his foes, which he deems their actions futile. As Delia created him as a combatant, Dark End enjoys fighting and expects his foes to put up a challenge, lamenting about defeating Stitch easily to be a letdown. He then got excited when some experiments along with Yuna and Stitch's friends joined in. Dark End also has a low opinion on family and friends, deeming he and Stitch are just experiments to them, and believes when they do not need experiments anymore, they abandon them. Dark End even declares Stitch to be a failed experiment, indicating that Dark End holds himself superior to Stitch andt the other experiments.

Dark End's opinion on friends and his arrogance and failure to recognize the bonds he forged caused him to underestimate Stitch, thus giving him the power to defeat Dark End.

===Physical appearance===
Dark End is a very dark purple, rabbit-like experiment with purple claws, two gold earrings on his right ear, large ears similar to [[Delia]], a small blond Mohawk, white fur on his belly, hands, and around his eyes, and a pink rabbit-like nose. In his second form, he extends a second pair of arms from his waist, two antennae from his head, and three spines or quills from his back, much like [[Stitch]], and his hair changes color to lavender.

===Powers and abilities===
As aforementioned, Dark End is able to mutate into a second form with four arms, two long antennae, and three spikes on his back. His eyes can glow bright purple when doing so, and energy radiates off his body which can be fired off as purple energy blasts. He possesses Stitch's abilities of enhanced strength, invulnerability, and fighting skills. He also possesses other abilities, such as creating faults in the ground, flight, teleportation, and electricity. He is capable of speaking fluently.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch!]]''===
[[Delia]] began the creation of Dark End at the start of Season 3 of the ''Stitch!'' anime and continued working on him until the second-to-last episode. After he was created, Delia then invaded Earth and sent out Dark End to defeat [[Stitch]]. Dark End easily had Stitch on the ropes, even with the help of some of the other experiments. However, Stitch eventually defeated Dark End using a hidden power he had. Afterwards, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] caught Dark End in a container, and the [[Grand Councilwoman]] arrested Delia, [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]], [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], and [[Reuben]]. Dark End has not been seen since.

==Trivia==
*In the [[Japan]]ese version, Dark End is a female, but in the English dub, Dark End is a male.
*Dark End is the second experiment that was not created by Jumba, as he was created by Delia. The first is [[Skunkuna]] who was created by Dr. Hämsterviel.
*Dark End serves as a foil to Stitch when it comes to family and friends. Unlike Stitch who values both concepts, Dark End believes people will abandon experiments once they do not need them anymore.
**The power cell used to create Stitch and Dark End befits how the two are different with their views on family and friendship. Stitch's powers are supercharged when he remembers the bonds he forged, yet Dark End doesn't value either of these concepts, and while he is loyal to Delia, they do not have a special bond, unlike Stitch has with his creator.
*Dark End could be considered an advanced genetic experiment as he has no known weaknesses. Since he was created after the 629 experiments, Dark End is likely immune to [[Angel]]'s song but not immune to the other experiments, as Dark End avoided [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]]'s spines.
*Dark End has some similarities in character with Warracchi (a yokai): they both wreak havoc in one way or another, but at the same time, they do not like a rude attitude.
*Dark End is one of the few experiments that are actually villains, along with [[Cyber]], [[Chopsuey]], [[627]], and [[Leroy]] and [[Leroy Clones|his clones]], while all the other experiments were following their primary function.
