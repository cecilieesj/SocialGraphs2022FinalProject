Polly is the narrator of the legend of John Henry and after marrying John, where she and John find work at the C&O Railroad where a couple of railroad workers are tired, almost losing the promised land. When John arrives, Polly sings to him to help the railroad industry. She is later seen helping the other workers helping the industry. Later after helping the industry, she, John Henry, and the other workers notice modern machinery arriving in which all the other workers are upset about this new arrival. When John plans to challenge against the steam drill, Polly warns him because it can be too dangerous, even though this arrival replaces a lot of workers in which John decides to challenge against the steam drill. Later after John almost finishes his challenge against the steam drill, she, Mactavish, and the other workers congratulate John Henry for completing, though she notices him collapsing. After John breaks through a giant rock to finish the challenge and after John collapses and dies, Polly, Mactavish, and the other workers are later seen mourning John's death. Later in the present, Polly spends time with her new son telling him not to be afraid of storms, also telling him about the legacy of John Henry.
