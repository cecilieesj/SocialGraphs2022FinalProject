== Appearances ==

=== ''[[Tangled]]'' ===
Pete and Conli are first seen getting the magic flower to heal the queen. A princess is born and then stolen by Gothel. Later, the captain, Pete, Conli, Stan, and another guard are seen chasing [[Flynn Rider]] and the [[Stabbington Brothers]] after they stole the crown. Flynn gets away from them, but they are able to capture the Stabbingtons. Then they go to The Snuggly Duckling as they have heard that Flynn is there. He escapes, then when [[Maximus]] comes in, Pete asks, "What's he doing?" then the captain puts his hand on his mouth until Maximus pulls the lever for the passage. The captain takes his hand off and the guards go in. Meanwhile, the Stabbington brothers are able to escape Conli by knocking him out.

The guards find Flynn. Flynn knocks them all out with a frying pan.

The next day, Pete, Conli, and 2 other guards arrest Flynn after they see him and the crown on a boat. Off-screen, the captain and Stan arrest the Stabbington brothers soon after.

The next day, Pete is seen doing dungeon duty as Flynn is being escorted to his execution. As the guards recover from being knocked out, he runs to Flynn right after, but goes back to the dungeon after a few seconds. Then Pete, Stan, and Conli are seen shooting arrows as Flynn and Maximus are escaping. They are last seen with the other guards holding up frying pans as Maximus walks in between the guards.
