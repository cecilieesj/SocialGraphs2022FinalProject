Bambadee wears a striped [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_bracelet friendship bracelet] which he made himself; this item was soon released as a free item in the book [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rockhopper_and_the_Stowaway Rockhopper and the Stowaway]. He had snuck onto the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Migrator Migrator] because the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Penguin penguins] on [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Island Club Penguin Island] were teasing him because they were jealous of his [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_Bracelet bracelet]. He does not always wear his bracelet.

Just like [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Dancing_Penguin Dancing Penguin] and [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Rookie Rookie], he is very easy to impersonate. All you need is the color [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Light_blue light blue] and the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_Bracelet Friendship Bracelet].

==Trivia==
*[[Rockhopper]] keeps one of Bambadee's bracelets in his [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Captain%27s_Quarters Captain's Quarters].
*He appears in the book, A Penguin Christmas Carol, in the past of Scrooge as a friend.
*To stop from impersonating Bambadee, when you put on the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_Bracelet Friendship Bracelet], it goes on your right flipper, but Bambadee wears it on his left flipper.
