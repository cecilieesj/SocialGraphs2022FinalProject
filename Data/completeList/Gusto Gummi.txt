'''Augustus "Gusto" Gummi''' is a character from the animated series ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Role in the series==
Gusto is an artistic, individualistic [[Gummi Bears|Gummi Bear]] who was born in an unknown warren similar to [[Gummi Glen]].

He is quite diverse as an artist: while painting and drawing are his main pursuits, he is also a phenomenally skilled sculptor able to carve lifelike likenesses of anyone in stone with unheard of speed.

One day, he set sail for a [[deserted island]], and although Gusto had only intended to paint the beach, his stay extended to twelve years when oceanic activity destroyed the beach and trapped him on the island. During this time, he befriended an island native named [[Artie Deco]], a wise-talking toucan.

He makes his debut in the season two finale "[[My Gummi Lies Over the Ocean]]", when [[Tummi Gummi|Tummi]] and [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]] are shipwrecked on his island. They encounter him just as a volcano is due to erupt and cause the entire island to sink into the sea. The three bears successfully work together, and bring Gusto home with them to Gummi Glen.

Gusto's personality is mercurial, in sharp contrast to Gruffi's desire to be steady and "do things the Gummi way". Gruffi tends to argue with Gusto for his outside-the-box thinking, and how much of an influence he is on [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] and [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], although there are times when Gusto's uniqueness saves the day, such as figuring out how to escape the island.

In "[[Day of the Beevilweevils]]", the Gummiberry crops are destroyed by [[Beevilweevils|the titular insects]]. Gusto attempts to replace them by setting out for a place called [[South Gumton]], which was a place unknown to the Gummi Glen Gummies, deep inside Fangwood Forest. Gusto explains that growing up in his warren, they knew of South Gumton to be a farming community. What they didn't know, is that the Great Gummies' former allies from the forest, the [[Tree Folk]], have grown bitter towards Gummies over the centuries.

In "[[Water Way to Go (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|Water Way to Go]]", it is established that he and Artie live by themselves in [[Gusto Falls|a makeshift apartment behind a waterfall]], but stay in Gummi Glen when the weather is too harsh.
