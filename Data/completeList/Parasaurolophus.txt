It has appeared in several Disney productions. This particular Parasaurolophus is showcased in the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney feature]] film ''[[Dinosaur]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
Parasaurolophus were among the many dinosaurs to appear in the ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''[[Fantasia]]''. Here, the species is shown to have a flap of skin connected from their crests to their necks. Two are first seen eating plants. These two are both seen again a few moments later when the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] appears. As it chases the dinosaurs, a few other Parasaurolophus can be seen running away. A few Parasaurolophus can be seen watching the Tyrannosaurus rex and a [[Stegosaurus]] while they're fighting with a group of herbivorous dinosaurs. Near the end of the segment, they are among with the many dinosaurs ended up going extinct from starvation and dehydration.

===''[[Dinosaur]]''===
[[Baby Parasaurolophus|A young Parasaurolophus]] is first seen at the very beginning of the movie peeking into the nests of Iguanodons. Then as it prances around, it sees a flying reptile. The young dinosaur follows the odd creature into a thick jungle. It looks up to where the reptile was. Then saliva falls and hits a branch which causes the Parasaurolophus to look up at what and where the flying lizard landed: the neck of a [[Carnotaurus]]. It then comes running out of the jungle which catches the attention of most of the dinosaurs. As it runs, the Carnotaurus bursts out of the trees and starts to chase all of the dinosaurs, running past the young Parasaurolophus as it did.

Later, many Parasaurolophus (adults and young ones) are seen migrating in [[Kron|Kron's]] herd to the nesting grounds.

===''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''===
Three Parasaurolophus were seen only at the beginning of the movie. There, they witness a meteor supposed to cause the extinction of dinosaurs pass by the Earth as they continue grazing along with two [[Diplodocus]].

===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===
A Parasaurolophus mother and its two young ones are seen at the [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] ride [[DINOSAUR]]. It is identified as "''Hadrosaur''".

The scene where the baby Parasaurolophus were hatching represented ''Dinosaur'' in the finale segment ofÂ ''Wonderful World of Animation''.  

== Trivia ==
* Parasaurolophus is one of the rarer hadrosaurs from the Late Cretaceous.
* Parasaurolophus' crest was likely used as a resonating chamber for helping the animal create sound. Indeed, palaeontologists made a 3D-model of the crest using a real Parasaurolophus skull as reference and blew air through it. The resulting sounds were not unlike those of musical instruments like trombones.
* Parasaurolophus' crest developed as the animal grew, as evidenced by a fossil of a very young individual found in New Mexico. As a result, adults had deeper voices than the infants.
*Its name means "Beside [[wikipedia:Saurolophus|Saurolophus]]", which was another type of duck-billed dinosaur.
*Parasaurolophus even gained more popular attention in popular culture, after the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park.
*Some fans say the Parasaurolophus from the 2000 Disney Film Dinosaur almost resemble the ones from the the 1998 IMAX film ''[[wikipedia:T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous|T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]''.
