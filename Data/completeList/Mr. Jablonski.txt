'''Mr. Jablonski''' is a character on the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Raven's Home]]'' and makes his only appearance in "[[The Baxters Get Bounced]]". He was the landlord of the apartment, until the apartment was sold to Richard, and his son Mitch took over. He is portrayed by Bruno Amato.

==Background==
Mr. Jablonski was raised by his mother alone. At an unknown point in time, Mr. Jablonski becomes the landlord of the apartment his mother owns. During this time, a tenant tries to poison him. He also rents one of his rooms to [[Raven Baxter]] and her two children.

==History==
Mr. Jablonski heads to Raven's apartment after getting a call from [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Booker]] about a broken dishwasher. He is able to fix it, though is displeased with their simple thanks, expecting more gratitude. Nia then requests he fix their leaky shower head. He heads to the bathroom, only to find [[Chelsea Daniels|Chelsea]] showering there. Having realized that Raven is living with an additional family (Chelsea and [[Levi Grayson|Levi]]), he has their rent risen by $1000, and threatens to have them evicted if they're unable to pay. Chelsea later invites Mr. Jablonski to cup of coffee so the pair can talk about the rental raise. He, however, mistakenly thinks that Chelsea is trying to poison after he takes a sip of the coffee. He makes his way to exit but slips on the floor before he can leave. In haste, Chelsea ties and gags him, placing him inside the closet. Raven later comes home to a muffling noise and finds Mr. Jablonski tied up. Raven rolls him out, and at the same time, [[Myrna Jablonski]], his mother arrives too. Jablonski accuses them of being crazy and tries to kick them out of the apartment. Raven makes a plead with Jablonski, but even though he's made his decision, Myrna intercedes and tells the family, they don't have to go, forbidding him from raising their rent or expelling them. Myrna later invites everyone to her apartment, and they all look at pictures of Phil, to his embarrassment.

After the building is sold, his landlord duties are taken over the by the new owner's son, Mitch.
