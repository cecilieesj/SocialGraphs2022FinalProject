He is a karate student at [[Marco Diaz]]'s dojo, and regularly picks on him, despite being younger.

==Background==
Jeremy comes from a rich family, and uses his immense wealth to buy fancy karate equipment and private lessons. Unlike Marco, Jeremy is a Tang Soo Do black belt. He is also not above cheating to get ahead in karate, as he brought a set of golden brass knuckles to a karate tournament in order to beat Marco. Unfortunately, he was found out by the Dojo Sensei, and was disqualified for cheating along with Marco.

Despite the support of his parents, Jeremy appears to harbor childish resentment toward his mother.

== Role in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]] ==
In "[[Monster Arm]]", Jeremy Birnbaum, as first mentioned by Marco, has super rich parents and uses his wealth to buy private karate lessons as well as equipment. On the day of Marco's karate tournament, he shuts his mom up when she encourages him. But once the tournament starts, Marco's mutated arm repetitively throws Jeremy around the room. After Marco is realizing how much commotion he is causing with the arm, he confronts it but throws Jeremy to the wall. After [[Star Butterfly|Star]] saves the day, Jeremy, though surprised as to what just happened, continues to tease Marco and brag about him winning, unaware about his golden brass knuckles falling from his hand up until Dojo Sensei picks it up and asks about it, revealing that Jeremy cheated. Because of this, both of them aren't the winners due to Marco causing trouble and Jeremy cheating. As he walks out, his mother congratulates him, and angrily tells her that he wishes he could fight her, leaving his mother scared.

==Trivia==
*Jeremy has a black belt in karate, outranking Marco's green belt, though it is likely he bought his way up the ranks due to his family's wealth.
*In the show's opening sequence, Jeremy's hair is a darker shade of brown, and his headband is red instead of white.
*Marco Diaz seems to be his arch-nemesis.
*He is one of the few people that knows Marco has a crush on [[Jackie-Lynn Thomas|Jackie]].
*Jeremy's final appearance is in "[[All Belts are Off]]".
