'''Compsognathus''' ("pretty jaw") are small tiny dinosaurs that appear in Disney's ''[[Fantasia]]''.

==Physical Description==
Compsognathus are small gray dinosaurs, somewhat akin to the [[Velociraptor]] species, as they share many similar physical traits to them. They have very minute sizes, long tails, and long heads and mouths.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
The Compsognathus appear briefly in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''Fantasia'' during the "extinction" scene as one of the many species crossing the desert, before the impending extinction of the dinosaurs.

===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===
Several Composognathus appeared in the [[Dinosaur (Disney's Animal Kingdom attraction)|DINOSAUR]] attraction. They are the last dinosaur species introduced on the ride. After the Time Rover ducks down to avoid hitting a swooping [[Cearadactylus]], the Composognathus were seen leaping past the vehicle and its passengers before it lost traction and ran into the [[Carnotaurus]] again. Originally the Composognathus were suspended on a chain that shows them physically flying over the guests. After the refurbishment promoting the release of ''[[Dinosaur]]'', the dinosaurs remained in place and were illuminated on to show them leaping. Recent refurbishment in [[2016]] replaced them completely with animated screens showing them jumping from ledge to ledge, before scurrying off into the night.
