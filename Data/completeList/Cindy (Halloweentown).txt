=== [[Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge]] ===
Cindy is one of [[Marnie Piper|Marnie's]] mortal friends, who attends the Cromwell-Piper Halloween Party as a Vampire at their house. Taking note of [[Kal]], who has just introduced himself to Marnie, Cindy sneaks up behind them and hisses in Kal's face before taking off. Then, [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]] approaches her and attempts to ask Cindy to be his date to the Halloween party being held at the high school - however Cindy points out Dylan's lack of a costume and denies him harshly.

Later, at the school's Halloween party, Cindy falls victim to the Creature Spell at midnight, where Kal changes her into a Vampire. Becoming consumed by her thirst for blood, Cindy targets Dylan and begins hissing at him i pursuit of his blood. When Marnie, Dylan, [[Sophie Piper|Sophie]], and [[Aggie Cromwell|Aggie]] succeed in opening the portal between [[Halloweentown (place)|Halloweentown]] and the human realm permanently and defeat Kal - they swiftly reverse the Creature Spell before heading off to Halloweentown to reverse the affects of the Grey Spell. As a result, Cindy is reverted to her human form - though she believes the entire thing to have been a dream.{{Halloweentown}}
