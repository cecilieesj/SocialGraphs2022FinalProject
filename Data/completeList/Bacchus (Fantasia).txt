{{Quote|Later on, we meet our old friend Bacchus, the god of wine, presiding over a bacchanal.|[[Deems Taylor]]}}

'''Bacchus''' (or '''Dionysus''') is the Roman god of parties in the [[1940]] feature film ''[[Fantasia]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
He appears as the god of wine and parties, joining his pet donkey [[Jacchus]] in the wild revelry, or (as emcee [[Deems Taylor]] puts it) a bacchanal, that accompanies the winemaking the [[Satyrs (Fantasia)|satyrs]], [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|centaurs]], and [[centaurettes]] are engaged in. Like his pet, he is depicted as an unattractive but lovable and jovial fool, drunkenly dancing around with everyone and having a good time. When [[Zeus (Fantasia)|Zeus]] calls up a storm, he and Jacchus are caught in the middle of it, tormented by the wind and his bolts of lightning. Both are washed away in a stream of wine when lightning strikes the grape tub they are hiding under, but forget the danger and merrily drink the wine they are sitting in. When the storm ends, he and Jacchus toast [[Iris (Fantasia)|Iris]] for coloring the wine in a beautiful rainbow pattern. 

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Bacchus appeared with Jacchus in ''House of Mouse''.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Bacchus is featured at one of the holes of the [[Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf]] course.
