==''Fantasia''==
Brudus is first seen sitting alone under a tree, as it seems he hasn't yet found a mate. The [[Cherubs]] who spot him feel just as bad as he does and copy his every move. Then another cherub comes along and shows them [[Melinda]], a female centaur who is also mateless. The cherubs have an idea: they decide to bring the two together. Melinda blushes as Brudus takes her by the hand. The two sit under a pavilion as the cherubs close the curtains (though one stays behind to take a peek). Brudus later takes Melinda under a tree when it starts raining and the two-step outside into the sunlight when the rain stops. Brudus and Melinda are last seen slumbering peacefully at the end of the segment.
