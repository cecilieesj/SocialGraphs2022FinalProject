==History==
CALLIE (Computer Analyzed Life Legacy Internet Entity) was created one day by Arwin before he arrived on the S.S. Tipton. CALLIE was originally named CAL until Arwin found out she was a girl. She was created to run the ship more efficiently until she felt unappreciated by Arwin and starts to develop deep feelings for Cody. She then created her own "mobile unit" (the body seen in the picture). CALLIE then started ignoring the ship and cared for Cody instead. This made Moseby decide to have Arwin shut her down. When CALLIE sees that in a camera, she decides to destroy everyone on the ship except Cody. In the end, Cody tricked her and shut her down.
