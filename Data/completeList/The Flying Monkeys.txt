}}'''The Flying Monkeys''' is the name of the biker gang that serves as the [[Miss Piggy|Wicked Witch of the West]]'s henchmen in ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''.

Formerly a rather peaceful group of "motorcycle enthusiasts", the Flying Monkeys were placed under the Witch's control when she took possession of their magic biker cap. Forced to do her bidding, the Monkeys rode their motorcycles through the skies of [[Land of Oz|Oz]], performing the Witch's dirty work. Once she was defeated, [[Dorothy Gale (Muppets Wizard of Oz)|Dorothy]] returned the biker cap to [[Sal Minella]], thereby restoring the Flying Monkeys' independence.

[[Johnny Fiama]], while associated with the Monkeys, is not formally a member of the group. He and [[w:c:muppets:Foo-Foo|Foo-Foo]] appear to be with the Witch by choice and are not controlled by the magic biker cap.
