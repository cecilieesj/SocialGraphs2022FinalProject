'''Miss Taylor''' is the town teacher and an antagonist in ''[[Pete's Dragon]]''.

==Role in the film==
Miss Taylor is first seen walking her class in the town of Passamaquoddy when a boy named [[Pete (Pete's Dragon)|Pete]] accidentally bumps into her, embarrassing her in front of her class. After insulting him, his friend, [[Elliott]] the dragon (invisible), plays a trick on her by having her petticoat removed in front of her class, thus, embarrassing her again and putting the blame on Pete.

Days later, after Pete has been adopted by [[Nora]], Miss Taylor is upset by her class' tardiness due to them, Nora, and Pete playing, singing, and dancing toÂ "[[There's Room for Everyone]]." At first, she refuses to take Pete in, until Nora finally manages to convince her otherwise despite her reluctance.

Later, when the school bell is being rung by an invisible Elliott, Pete tries to stop him, but Miss Taylor once again puts the blame on him, accuses him of lying, proceeds to carelessly slap his fingers nine times with a stick, and sets him up as the dunce of the class. Still refusing to believe the story about Elliott, who (still invisible) is heard angrily snarling and growling and then breaks through the wall, thus, scaring everyone. After Elliott removes the dunce hat from Pete who tells him to return to the cave, he breaks through the other wall while accidentally taking the school bell with him. School is canceled for the rest of the day and Miss Taylor is finally somewhat convinced about Elliott's "existence" as is the villainous [[Dr. Terminus]] and his assistant, [[Hoagy]].

A few more days later, at night, after Elliott has made a full appearance in town and defeated his enemies, Miss Taylor and the [[Mayor (Pete's Dragon)|Mayor]] are seen along with other members exiting his office, not noticing the upcoming falling telegraph pole. It is about to land on them, until Elliott rushes just in time to save them. Shocked and amazed at the same time by his appearance, they're grateful to Elliott and his good deed.
