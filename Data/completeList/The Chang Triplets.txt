'''The Chang Triplets''' ('''Billy''', '''Debbie''', and '''Julie''') are three fraternal siblings. One brother and two sisters of an Asian family (most likely Chinese due to their surname), who are straight-A students, usually trying to live up to their father's expectations. They really enjoy academic challenges and showing people up for having talents in other subjects. They even study karate with their uncle.
