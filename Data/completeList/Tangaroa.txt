====[[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]====
In the original Tiki Room attraction at Disneyland, Tangaroa takes the form as an enormous tree to which according to the sign near Tangaroa himself, it is said that Tangaroa appeared in the form of a tree (which no one has ever seen) and each spring, legends say that new life comes forth in wondrous way. During his introduction, Tangaroa is the last Tiki God to speak just as he introduces himself as the father of all gods and goddessees explaining that in this enchanted land, Tangaroa brings in mystic powers to bring in new life forms, revealing tiki idols who support Tangaroa standing on his leaves. After that, the doors leading to the entrance to the Tiki Room attraction then open where guests enter to watch the show.

The sign next to Tangaroa himself reads:
<poem>
''Tangaroa took the form of a tree''
''(A tree that no one ever did see)''
''And so each spring the legends say''
''New life comes forth in wondrous way''
