The '''Husky Puppies''' are [[Demon]] and [[Nana (Snow Dogs)|Nana]]'s children from Disney's [[2002]] comedy movie ''[[Snow Dogs]]''. While their parentage is mixed, it's clear that they all take after their husky father. When introducing them, [[Barb]] said her favorite was Demon Jr. The four pups appear at the end of the movie, entering Ted's dentist office along with their mother.
