'''Roland Carter''',Â or simply '''Mr. Carter''', is a recurring character from the animated TV Series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is a science teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] who is constantly at odds with [[Pepper Ann Pearson]], whom he is constantly giving detention slips to.

==Background==
Roland Carter is a science teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]]. He actually loves his job and teaching, but has one minor nuisance that he has to put up with five days a week: [[Pepper Ann Pearson]]. Carter is constantly giving her detention either for being late, or for talking out of line in class. Despite this, in "[[Strike it or Not]]", he admits that she is his best student. He tried to date her mother [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]] in "[[Like Riding a Bike]]". While the two of them got along and Carter insisted that he is not trying to alter Pepper Ann's life too much, they ultimately broke up and resumed being friends. 

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Carter is still a teacher at the school, though he and the rest of the staff are disappointed in the fact that there is nothing significantly different about them after all these years.

===Personality===
Carter is a relatively normal person who loves his job and typically keeps a mildly satisfied disposition. However, he is shown to get sharp with people, particularly Pepper Ann, who is always the source of his frustration. He does not hate her however and is merely trying to do his job for the benefit of the children, whom he clearly cares about. He is shown to have a very caring person and might be something of a hopeless romantic as well.

===Physical appearance===
Carter is a tall Caucasian man with a noticeably flat oval shaped head, black bushy mustache, fuzzy unibrow and an obvious combover. He wears a white dress shirt, blue tie, yellow plaid coat, pea green slacks, white striped socks and dark brown shoes.

==Trivia==
*He is implied to have come from [[Minnesota]] due to his accent.
*It is unknown if he settled with Ms. Stark after he pursued her at the end of "Like Riding a Bike".
