The '''Vulture''' is a character that was originally created for ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' but was deleted during the film's production.
Originally, [[Maleficent]] was going to have a pet vulture, which was meant to serve as comic relief (very similar to Iago) and had a [[New York]] accent. However, because his role did not contribute much to the story and also somewhat detracted from that imposing nature of
Maleficent, he was cut from the final version of the film. Despite this, there was dialogue written for the vulture and some rough sketches for the character.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/03/sleeping-beauty-deleted-vulture/16426505/ USA TODAY: New 'Sleeping Beauty' character discovered]</ref>

After the vulture was removed, [[Diablo]] was created to fill the role of Maleficent's pet and confidant.
