'''Sofi Hanson-Bhatt''' is a main character in the ''[[The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers]]''. [[Evan Morrow|Evan's]] friend, who is a talented hockey player, she leaves [[the Mighty Ducks]] to join the Don't Bothers, despite her perfectionist parents opposing the move.

==Biography==
===Team confusion===
Sofi initially plays for [[the Mighty Ducks]] during the time in which [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] also plays for the Ducks. When Evan is cut from the team, however, Sofi remains a member of the Ducks, despite multiple efforts by Evan to recruit her to the Don't Bothers. 

After the Don't Bothers build a team, Sofi becomes envious of the team spirit encompassed by the Don't Bothers. She remains reluctant to defect from the Ducks, however, given the superiority and prestige attached to their name; Sofi wants to go on to  study at Harvard and believes that the Ducks can help her with this. Things come to a head during the game between both teams. While Sofi scores a large amount of goals, she gets beaten by Evan scoring as time expired. [[Coach T]] become rude with the team after the game and came down on Sofi for letting Evan score. With that, Sofi accepts the Don't Bothers offer to join their team. 

Sofi, however, remains a member of the Mighty Ducks whilst playing for the Don't Bothers, and is reluctant to tell her parents — or even ask — if she can swap teams. Sofi begins exhausting herself attending practices for both the Ducks and the Don't Bothers. Her efforts are thwarted, however, when her parents find out that she has been playing for the Don't Bothers.

After a brief conversation with her parents following the Hockey Moms Skills Challenges, her father eventually realises that her position on the Ducks is making Sofi unhappy, and that she would be truly happy on the Don't Bothers. With this, he signs her permission slip and allows her to leave the Ducks for the Don't Bothers.

===Don't Bothers===
Over the season, Sofi's loyalty to the Don't Bothers grows. She and her teammates had a practice with some of [[District 5 Ducks|the original Mighty Ducks]]. After the practice, Sofi took a group selfie. When she went to put the photo on Instagram, she saw a video of Evan practicing with the Ducks. She became upset and led a walkout on Evan. However, they reconciled before their next game.

After the Don't Bothers started a winning streak, [[Alex Morrow|Alex]] became consumed by the feeling and after getting word from Sofi's parents that they had to win out to qualify for states, drove the team harder in practice. Even when they accomplished the goal, Alex came down on the team for disobeying her late in their last game. Sofi and the team forced Evan to fire his mother as coach.

===States===
On the way to states, Sofi planned on having a girls weekend with [[Lauren Gibby|Lauren]] and [[Maya Kasper|Maya]], but Maya hung out with a guy she met in the game room. Sofi gave a confusing response to Evan's text asking her to a party later that night. She went to clarify things, but after she and [[Nick Ganz|Nick]] saw Evan and Mary Joe together, Sofi decided to go with Trevor Reddick from the Ducks. 

Things came to a head at the party. Sofi and Evan argued in the photo booth. Evan mentioned that Trevor might be using her to get information on the Don't Bothers. At this, Sofi called Evan a jerk and insulted his dancing.

The next day, on the way to the arena, Sofi and Evan reconciled. In the process, they admitted to liking each other and laughed at their pictures in the photo booth that captured their fight.

===Run to the Finals/Injury===
The Don't Bothers made it to the semifinals, putting them one win away from facing the Ducks. It was in this moment that Sofi's parents said that she was right to leave the Ducks. In the semifinal match, Sofi broke a scoreless tie with a goal in the third period, but was checked from behind and slid into the boards, banging her right knee in the process. The Don't Bothers won to get to the finals. In the locker room, Evan looked at Sofi's knee and advised her to sit out the game. Sofi insisted that she play, given that they needed a ten person active roster or they would have to forfeit. While Evan agreed to keep quiet, he eventually told her parents, his mom and [[Gordon Bombay]]. The doctor diagnosed her with a knee sprain and cleared her to play, but cautioned that one wrong hit could lead to permanent damage. Eventually, everyone agreed to sit out, thus causing the Don't Bothers to forfeit the final to the Ducks.

===Winning the name===
Shortly after the trophy ceremony, Coach T began gloating in the hallway, stating that even if they had played, the Ducks would have dominated the Don't Bothers. At this, Alex challenged the Ducks to a game at the Ice Palace the next day. If the Ducks won, the Don't Bothers would drop out of the league. If the Don't Bothers won, they would become the Ducks. 

While the game started off well, the Don't Bothers were trailing going into the third period. Everyone began lamenting about not being able to play together again. At this, Sofi came in on crutches and mentioned that they were already winners because of what they went through during the season and that the Ducks were losers. Sofi mentioned that she had been playing hockey since she was five and in that whole time, playing with the Don't Bothers was the only time she actually enjoyed playing. After each team member talked about their personal victories throughout the season, they were rejuvenated.

Now wearing the jerseys of the [[District 5 Ducks|original Ducks]], the Don't Bothers tied the game with under a minute to go. Coming out of their final timeout, Sofi called Evan back to the bench. When Evan asked what she wanted, Sofi lifted the visor of his helmet and kissed him for good luck. The Don't Bothers won the game and the Mighty Ducks name. 
==Trivia==
*She's similar to [[Adam Banks]] because they are both characters who first joined one team and refuse to leave, but later left to join the current one when they changed their minds.
*Sofi and [[Evan Morrow|Evan]] both have feelings for one another.
