The '''Snowgies''' (also known as '''Snow-Babies''') are tiny, mischievous snowmen that were created by [[Elsa]], who first appeared in the animated short, ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Frozen Fever]]''===
The Snowgies are created as [[Elsa]] starts sneezing. The more Elsa sneezes, the more Snowgies appear. The Snowgies then scamper off to the [[Arendelle Castle|castle]] courtyard, where they cause some mischief, most specifically targeting [[Anna]]'s birthday cake. Luckily, [[Kristoff]], [[Sven]], and [[Olaf]] manage to subdue them by the time Anna and Elsa arrive and even have them perform a surprise for Anna. After a spectacular birthday party, the Snowgies get taken by Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf to live in the [[Elsa's Ice Palace|ice palace]] with [[Marshmallow]].

It also shows Olaf naming each one, such as Slush, Sludge, Slide, Ansel, Flake, Flurry, Fridge, Powder, Crystal, Squalor, Pat, Sphere, and William.

===''[[Frozen II]]''===
They appear in [[Elsa's Ice Palace]] with Marshmallow following the film's end credits. Olaf tells them the story of the film's events and how he and Elsa died, but both of them came out okay in the end. Olaf says that because water has memory, he lives, and so do Marshmallow and the Snowgies. Upon realizing this, Marshmallow exclaims these words in joy, and the Snowgies jump up and down to celebrate.

==Printed media==

===''[[Anna & Elsa: Sisterhood is the Strongest Magic]]''===
The Snowgies appeared in the 8th chapter of the ''[[Anna & Elsa: Sisterhood is the Strongest Magic]]'' book series, "Return to the Ice Palace".

==Trivia==
*Like Olaf and Marshmallow, the Snowgies represent a certain element of Elsa's personality; in this case, her long-dormant mischievousness and love for fun.
*When the Snowgies are conjured, they appear in flashes of magic which take the shape of a snowflake.
*Strangely, Olaf can be seen with his flurry throughout the short, while the Snowgies move throughout the courtyard and castle unharmed by the warm climate. It is unknown why the Snowgies do not melt, despite being in the hot weather of summer. This contradicts with the [[Frozen|first movie]], where, if not for his personal flurry created by Elsa, Olaf would have been melted after Elsa restores the summer.
*One of the Snowgies has a face that resembles [[Baymax]] from ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.
