'''Daisy's parents''' are the mother and father of [[Daisy Duck]]. They made their first appearance when Daisy introduces [[Donald Duck|Donald]] to them in the theatrical cartoon ''[[Donald's Diary]] ''([[1954]]). Her mother looks like James Whistler's portrait of "Arrangement in Grey and Black", is deaf and uses a hearing accessory. She is considerably taller than her husband. When she later visits Daisy and Donald at their house, she is more formally dressed, and has her brown hair tied in a bun, and wears a hat with a flower on it. She was voiced by Vivi Janiss. Daisy's father is a photographer with a crazy-looking expression.

Besides Daisy, they have three kids who look exactly like [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. According to [[Carl Barks]]' ''[[Flip Decision]]'' (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''Â #149), Daisy also has a sister living in [[Duckburg]], which means that her parents must have had at least one other daughter.

As of yet, the only other appearance of Daisy's parents was a cameo in ''[https://inducks.org/story.php?c=D+2007-144&search=Caves%20Lars%20Jensen The Danger Caves]'', chapter 12 of the ''Donald Duck'' comic sub-series ''[[Tamers of Nonhuman Threats]]''. They can be seen in a picture in Daisy's house.
