The Trapster was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==History==
===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
When [[Hawkeye]] faced [[Chemistro]], who was guarding one of the Norn Stones, he confused Chemistro with Paste Pot Pete (Trapster's original alias).

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
Trapster robbed a money car, but got ambushed by [[Spider-Man]]. The Trapster tried to trap Spider-Man in a sticky glue, while in the fight he putted a tracer on Spider-Man. Spider-Man then shot a web to the hole of the gun and exploded covering Trapster in glue. After [[Nick Fury]] arrived, Trapster tried to escape, but Fury shot a pole which hit Trapster and got knocked out. Trapster then was imprisoned.

His name was mentioned by the remaining Frightful Four members as they searched for Spider-Man in Midtown High school inside the cafeteria. He was also listed by Spider-Man as one of the villains he took down.

He escaped and battled against Spider-Man and his entire team, but was defeated and recaptured. He escaped again and tried to rob a bank, but was captured after his weapon was hit by [[Captain America's Shield]]. He later mistook Flash Thompson for Spider-Man and was defeated by the real one and put in jail once again. [[Doctor Octopus]] later helped him out of prison and he freed the other three before helping capture Spider-Man in a warehouse before they escaped.

===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===
[[Hawkeye]] is first contacted by [[Iron Man]] right after he stopped Trapster, [[Ulysses Klaw|Klaw]], and [[Wizard (Marvel)|Wizard]] from committing a robbery.

==Background in other media==
This is Peter Petruski's fifth animated appearance as the incarnation Trapster. Previous versions included are ''Fantastic Four (1978)'', ''Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes'', ''Fantastic Four (1994)'', and ''The Super Hero Squad Show''.
