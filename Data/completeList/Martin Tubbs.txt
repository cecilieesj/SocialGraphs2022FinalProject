He is madly attracted to [[Irma Lair|Irma]], although she only sees him as a friend. He is a member of the Happy Bears, a boy-and girl-scout group located in [[Heatherfield]]. An unpopular nerd who has a helpless crush on [[Irma Lair|Irma]], he believes she has feelings for him, but doubted when Irma publicly humiliated him on school-wide radio. Irma later apologized.
