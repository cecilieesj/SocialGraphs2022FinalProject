He appears on ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' in the episode "[[Mutantcy on the Bouncy]]".

==Background==
Clovis Cluckenhoff's parents lived near an experimental plastics factory, and as a result, he was born a rubber mutant who was able to stretch his body into any shape and form he desired. Shunned for his powers, he used to keep them a secret until he eavesdropped on Swenlin Swine while working as a janitor and found out that his boss was really the mutant criminal Cement Head. He then chose to use his powers to stop Cement Head, but got into trouble when Cement Head framed him for his crimes.

==Powers and Abilities==
As a rubber mutant, he can stretch and mold his body into many different forms. For example, he once took on the appearance of the family cat when he was a baby and his pliability also enables him to be used as a slingshot.
