==Background==
===Personality===
Stella is always motivated to volunteer in any way she possibly can to protest against certain things she opposes. She's determined when it comes to her attempts at making changes and stubbornly doesn't quit at them that easily. Because of her passion and devotion for what she does, she does it with the best intentions and despite it possibly not working out well, she doesn't let that daunt nor deter her to keep trying.

===Physical Appearance===
Stella is a Caucasian teen girl with long, blonde hair and turquoise blue eyes. She wears a red bandana or head scarf, gray hoop earrings, olive green vest, teal, long-sleeved shirt with a folded collar, long, blue, double-slit skirt with each split extending up to the lower leg, and brown sandals.

==A Dark Score Evened==
It appears that Stella was an activist and environmentalist, as well as a vegan. In "[[A Dark Score Evened]]", she is seen protesting outside of [[Dawn S. Folsom|Principal Folsom]]'s office, lobbying for less of the cafeteria's mystery meat and more of vegetables, and any other health food. But her cries for the menu to be revised disturbs the principal, who was trying to have peace and quiet, and she stepped outside the office to confront her about it. Undeterred, Stella explains that she has to keep trying until she achieved her goal. Principal Folsom agreed, however, she still wants peace and quiet most of all, and she breaks Stella's picket sign in half.

Later, Stella is seen continuing her cause for changes to get the word out, by passing out flyers to other students who passed by her. After they review two photos with one featuring the splatter of grape jam on [[Raycliff]]'s golf cart in the school's hallway, the other featuring the splatter of that same jam on [[Fiona Ashbury]] and her models, and evaluating the possible suspects behind those, [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] question her about them. Stella admits to sabotaging the golf cart in disagreement and retaliation to the sheepskins that Raycliff had on the golf cart, but she denies exploding the jam on Fiona and the models, as Fiona uses and showcases the material of the apparel that came from animal fibers according to a catalog for the fall fashion line-up. After finding the modem to her computer to be overloaded, Horace tells Stella that he is confiscating it. She tells him she needs it to E-mail people about a rally to save doodlebugs. He tells her she would just have to do it the old-fashioned way: via regular mail.

Once finding out that Stella was in detention one Saturday with [[Wilbur (Fillmore!)|Wilbur]], [[Grover Brady]] and [[Becca Embarcadero]], teaming up with them to get revenge for their being bullied and reviewing the suspects again, Fillmore, Ingrid and [[Horatio Vallejo|Vallejo]] eliminate all of them except Stella. It is determined that she was the one in the ninja outfit who fired spit-balls from a pitching machine, who ran across the rafters in the cafeteria, who Fillmore and Ingrid encountered earlier, and who almost ran into Wilbur in the school's kitchen. Horace informs the two Safety Officers that he had a way of pinpointing the person behind these and they have him show them. In the Converted Center Control Room, Horace uses a computer that features a security system with a camera that's focused on the students in the school's hallway. On the monitor, the camera almost instantly zooms in on Stella, who is scoping out through a pair of binoculars and wearing some foliage disguised as a potted plant. Fillmore and Ingrid then met up with her and Fillmore demands she tell them where the three, other bullied victims were. She refuses and takes off running. They continue through the hall, where the X Middle School Knitting Team are and Stella gets caught in a large yarn ball, tumbling and bouncing into the Control Room before it comes loose, and she is freed. Stella conspired with Wilbur, Grover and Becca to get back at Horace for all the bullying he did to them (even though he denied it), and they have him tied up in a rolling chair. Just as Wilbur is about to damage the console's control panel by dumping some gumbo from a pot onto it, Fillmore tells them that it was not the answer. He convinces them that there are other ways to solve the problem with bullies. From the monitor, everyone watches Principal Folsom as she announces the winner of the quilting contest. Afterwards, the four do time in detention again (as revealed on the front page of the X Middle School Examiner).
