'''Tom Piper '''is the protagonist and [[Mary Contrary]]'s sweetheart in ''[[Babes in Toyland]]''.

==Role in the film==
Tom's love for Mary is the most important factor of his personality and his main motive for all of his actions. Through the film, he shows great bravery, caring and willing to help those who are in danger. In that sense, he can be described as an archetype of a hero. Always finding ways to get out of dangerous situations with the help of someone else, but in a plan that he came up with, he is shown as practical and adroit. He easily comes in contact with people who could be helpful for him and Mary, showing charm and cogency. When he is taken hostage by [[Barnaby (Babes in Toyland)|Barnaby]] (shrunk, tied up, and gagged), he threatens that he will shrink him to the size smaller than an atom, but he isn't showing any sign of panic of fear. He even mumbles, thrashes, and wriggles while being tied up and gagged, protesting that Mary decided to marry Barnaby so he doesn't shrink Tom down. That shows his bravery, love, and loyalty to her. However, it is easy to notice that, just as he never shows fear for what will happen to him, he isn't careful and wary when there is a threat that he is a target. That speaks of his self-sacrifice, but also of his negligence and unwariness in some moments. Because of this, he gets ambushed and kidnapped two times (the first time by Barnaby's henchmen, [[Gonzorgo and Roderigo]], and the next time by Barnaby) both times getting in a very hard situation for escape. Above all, he is very calm, collected, kind and polite. When he has to defend and/or fight for Mary, he is again in the form of a strong and fast hero, with a lot of physical straight.

==Trivia==
*Tom's character is based off the one in the nursery rhyme:
"''Tom, Tom the Piper's Son.<br />Stole a pig and away did run<br />The pig was eat and Tom was beat<br />And Tom went howling down the street.''"
**However, in the film, Tom shows no display of stealing and is kind, brave, and helpful. Other versions of the nursery rhyme describe him as an expert with his pipe charming all the children and animals, although he never plays one in the film itself.
*[[Dean Jones]], [[Elvis Presley]], Michael Callan, James Darren and Frankie Avalon were considered for the role of Tom.
