'''Satyrs''' are creatures from the [[2020]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Onward]]''.

==Background==
Satyrs lived in a world where magic was common. Because magic wasn't easy to master, satyrs adapted to newer technology such as using modern appliances and adapting to newer technology for an easier way to get through, alongside other mythical creatures. In the film, satyrs are frequently featured throughout the film as background characters adapting to modern life.

==Role in the film==
In a teaser trailer, a female satyr is seen painting a house by jumping high.

In the film, satyrs once lived in a world when magic once existed throughout the land of mythical creatures. Ever since magic existed across the land, they enjoyed using magic until modern technology arrives. With modern technology rising slowly, satyrs adapted to a new life in this format such as working as employees, appearing as customers, etc.

Ever since [[Ian Lightfoot|Ian]] and [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]] brought magic back to the land of mythical creatures, satyrs started adapting to a new life with magic brought back to the land of mythical creatures.

==Trivia==
*One of the satyrs at the beginning of the film bears a striking resemblance to [[Bonnie Anderson]], a character from the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]].
*Early drafts for the film had a satyr named [[Jenny (Onward)|Jenny]] (short for Genevieve) joining Ian and Barley's quest. Jenny was a waiter at the [[Manticore's Tavern]] that was passionate about the historic days of questing, but she was ultimately seen as a distraction from the brothers' story and was cut.
