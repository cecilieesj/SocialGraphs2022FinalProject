==Background==
===Personality===
He was also the only villain who, while like so many other villains, did use a deathtrap to try to kill [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] and [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]], was determined to stay and watch, unlike the other villains who will prefer to leave while a death trap is in progress.

===Physical appearance===
He is African American, with gray and black hair along with a mustache. He wears a purple suit, white shirt, and purple tie.

===Powers and Abilities===
Falsetto Jones is a skilled cat burglar, or, as Ron states it, "a dog burglar."

He is highly capable of using technology and the simplest evidence, such as Rufus's paw-prints, to track people down.

==Appearances==
===''[[Kim Possible]]''===
Falsetto Jones suffered a freak helium accident some time ago, which is why his name is Falsetto Jones-his voice is unnaturally high.
He is the only dog breeder of Lithuanian Wolfhounds in the world, and uses his house to host an annual dog show.

When Ron and Rufus were trying to lay low during his dog show, he asked for Rufus' autograph. He really used the autograph, Rufus' paw-prints, to dig up complete backgrounds which revealed him as the pet of Ron Stoppable, sidekick to Kim Possible.

==Trivia==
*Falsetto Jones gets his nickname from the falsetto, an artificially high voice often used by singers, especially male singers handling notes in a high range, or, when used in speaking, to disguise the voice by making it seem younger or more feminine, depending on the person using it. Since Falsetto Jones' voice was raised in pitch by helium, the name fits. In fact, his voice kinda sounds similar to the iconic Disney mascot, [[Mickey Mouse]].
