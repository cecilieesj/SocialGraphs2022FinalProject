==Background==
Cek and Rama are friendly and kind to other animals kind to them. However, when it comes to Beshte's bad reputation, they take the blame on the hippo for the havoc he accidentally causes. When Beshte saves Pinguino's life, the two clear out his bad reputation with the problem solved.

==Role in the series==
==="[[Poa the Destroyer]]"===
When Beshte arrives at the cliff area and sees the herd of mountain goats, Cek and Rama notice debris accidentally caused by Beshte, thinking he is a nuisance to the tundra animals. As Pinguino, the lead penguin reports to Beshte for being a destructive monster, the animals report Beshte to Baliyo about his bad reputation.

When Beshte decides to visit the mountain goats again, they refuse to listen to him, despite him not doing any villainous actions. Cek and Rama are later gathered at the Tree of Life to reconcile with Beshte just as the hippo saves Pinguino's life, apologizing for their cruel treatment to him. Cek and Rama join in the celebration.

==="[[Long Live the Queen]]"===
In this episode, Cek and Rama have a baby goat alongside them. Just as Kion and the Night Pride enter the Tree of Life to visit Janna one last time before she passes away, Janna suddenly completes her journey through the Circle of Life; Makini reports the sad news to the animals outside, causing Cek, Rama, and all the animals to react in fright. Just as the baby goat cries in reaction, Rama comforts the crying goat. Later, Cek, Rama, and their baby goat attend Janna's funeral at the Willows. Later, when Rani is crowned as the new queen of the Tree of Life, Cek, Rama, and their offspring attend her coronation.

==="[[Triumph of the Roar]]"===
Cek and Rama are one of the victims under attack by Makucha's army. During battle, Kion manages to save the goats from demise by defeating all the enemies preparing to eat the rare animals at the Tree of Life.

==="[[Return to the Pride Lands]]"===
Cek, Rama, the other animals of the Tree of Life, and the animals of the Pride Lands attend Kion and Rani's wedding.

==Trivia==
*Each of the goats has a name originating from Asian language:
**"Cek" means "check" in Indonesian.
**"Rama" means "father" in Malay, despite Rama herself being a mother.
