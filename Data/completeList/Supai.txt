'''Supai''' was the Incan god of darkness released by [[Yzma]], and considered the secondary antagonist in the original version of ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Kingdom of the Sun]]'' (or ''Kingdom '''in''' the Sun'').
==Role in [[The Emperor's New Groove|the film]]==
Long ago when the world was created, Supai was sealed away by the gods to allow for light to reign on the land. He was later released by [[Yzma]] in exchange for eternal youth and revenge on the sun by shrouding the world in darkness. In the end, Supai was destroyed when [[Pacha]] lassoed the sun and brought it down on top of him.
