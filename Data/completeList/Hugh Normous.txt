[[File:Wizards-place-hugh-normous-02.jpg|thumb]]'''Hugh Normous''' (portrayed by [[Josh Sussman]]) is a wizard in ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]''. Hugh Normous believed he was a giant and being "rather small for his size," though he later realizes he was adopted by Mr and Mrs. Coco Normous. He befriends Alex and Justin. His adoptive parents bought him smaller objects so he didn't have a low self-esteem for being a "small giant." In 'Hugh's Not Normous', he found out he isn't a giant. Although he acted like one in the 'Wizards of Apartment 13B' 4-parter. At the end of Wizards vs. Everything, he and the other monsters move in with the Russo's

== Trivia ==

* Hugh is considered somewhat of an idiot by fans. Even in-show the fact he attends a wizard school (when giants DON'T use magic) should've been a giveaway. At one point a frustrated classmate, having put up with Hugh's delusion for long enough snapped and said bluntly "Hugh! You and I are the same size", comparing their heights.
