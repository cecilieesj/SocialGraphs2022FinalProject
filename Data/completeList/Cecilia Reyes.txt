}}'''Dr. Cecilia Reyes''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'', played by Alice Braga. She is a medical doctor and a [[Mutants|Mutant]] who can generate force fields.

Cecilia Reyes was created by Scott Lodbell, Art Thibert and Carlos Pacheco.
==Background==
Not much is known about the enigmatic Dr. Cecilia Reyes. All that is known is that she is a mutant with the power to project powerful force fields and barriers. She comes off as a warm and gentle person, but in actuality is a cunning person with ties to the mysterious Essex Corporation. Her main goal seemed to be helping the New Mutants control their gifts so that they can go out into the world without causing any trouble. However, it is soon revealed that she is actually trying to mold them into an army for her employers.

Following the continuous effects of [[Mirage (Marvel)|Danielle Moonstar]]'s powers, Reyes is informed by her superiors to take her DNA and then euthanize her due to the dangerous threat she poses. She is thwarted by the arrival of [[Wolfsbane|Rahne Sinclair]] who mauls her; forcing her to flee. Reyes attempts to use her powers to finish off Dani as well as the rest of the Mutants, but the unexpected arrival of the [[Demon Bear]] puts an end to that. Reyes was caught in the entity's maw and crushed; sapping the barriers she had placed.

===Abilities===
*'''Force field generation''': Cecilia Reyes' main ability is to create force fields. She can affect the size and projection as long as they are in range of her field of vision. She can also leave them up for indefinite periods of time.
*'''Medical expert''': Cecilia Reyes displays some medical know how. Enough to both aid and deter prospects.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Cecilia Reyes was actually a good person who did not care for super heroics. She did eventually join the X-Men and fought numerous antagonists, but always returned to her medical practice.
*In the comics, Cecilia Reyes was of Afro-Puerto Rican descent. In the movie, she is portrayed by a tan Brazilian actress. This inaccuracy was criticized by New Mutants creator Bob McLeod who accused the filmmakers of whitewashing.
*Despite being in the hospital with the rest of the Mutants, and being in close proximity with Dani, Cecilia Reyes is for some reason not affected by her powers and does not experience any of the nightmares.
