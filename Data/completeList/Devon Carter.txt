'''Devon Carter''' is [[Raven Baxter]]'s steady boyfriend from seasons 2-4 of ''[[That's So Raven]]'', and is portrayed by [[Jonathan McDaniel]]. He previously had braces on his teeth and bad acne, and was known as "Bucktooth Carter". After he had his braces removed and his face "cleared up" over the summer, and came back to school, Raven and [[Alana Rivera]] were constantly fighting to be his girlfriend.

Devon ultimately chooses Raven over Alana, but when Devon's dad gets married, he and the rest of his family end up moving to Seattle right after the wedding. However, he and Raven do their best to keep up a long distance relationship and he occasionally visits Raven in San Francisco. After his family leaves [[Tanya Baxter|Tanya]] assures Raven that Devon will always be in her heart. Even though they say they are each other's "only love", Raven nonetheless has numerous crushes between his visits. Devon has a little sister named Nadine who is jealous of Raven.

Sometime after the events of the original series and ''[[Cory in the House]]'', Raven and Devon got married and had boy-girl fraternal twins named [[Booker Baxter-Carter|Booker]] and [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Nia]] - but the marriage apparently doesn't work out and Raven and Devon ultimately got divorced, with Raven getting custody of the twins. However, despite being divorced, Raven and Devon seem to have an amicable relationship with him knowing she's psychic.
