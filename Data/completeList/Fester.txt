'''Fester''' is the sidekick to the historical Goof family counterparts in the Goof History episodes of [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
He almost always serves as the right-hand man to [[Goofy|Goofy's]] historical counterpart. Although he is not always named, when he is given one, his first name is usually Fester.

===Personality===
Fester is helpful to his friends. He also seems to care about the condition of those around him, as he is a dentist in "[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]".

===Physical appearance===
Fester is an averagely built anthropomorphic dog of normal height with dark red hair. 

As [[Goofy|Sir Goofy of Knock Knees']] sidekick, Fester wears a dark green tunic with a light green collar, light green leggings, dark green shoes, a black belt, and a dark green hat with an orange feather.

As Fester Ness, he wears a black suit with a red tie, black shoes, a gray fedora with a black band, and white gloves.

As Inspector Lestrade, he wears a trench coat, a yellow-and-black striped tie, light brown shoes, and a stalker cap.

As Fester Swollen, he wears a pink long-sleeved shirt, brown chaps, gray pants, dark brown boots, a gray cowboy hat with a black band, a yellow bandana, a black vest, and a black belt.

As the dentist in "[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]", Fester wears a bear skin strapped over one shoulder; a dark red cap with a bone fastened on top with three feathers, two blue and one dark red, tied to it; and a black wrist band.

===Role in the series===
His only appearances are in the Goof History episodes. He normally is featured as the sidekick of the Goof family member the episode is about. 

In "[[Goofin' Hood and his Melancholy Men]]", Fester is the unnamed leader (other than [[Goofy|Sir Goofy of Knock Knees]]) of the Melancholy Men. 

In "[[The Ungoofables]]", Fester (with the last name "Ness") is an FBI agent.

In "[[Sherlock Goof]]", he is Inspector Lestrade.

In "[[Gunfight at the Okie-Doke Corral]]", he is again Fester (last name "Swollen").

In "[[Clan of the Cave Goof]]", he is once again an unnamed character, this time a dentist.

==Trivia==
*One of Fester's last names, Swollen, is likely a play on words. If a wound "festers" it may become "swollen."
