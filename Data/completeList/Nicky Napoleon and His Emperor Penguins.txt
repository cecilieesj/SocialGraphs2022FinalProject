'''Nicky Napoleon and His Emperor Penguins''' is the name of the penguin orchestra in ''[[Muppet*Vision 3D]]''. The penguins are most prominent as a collection of audio-animatronic characters within the physical theater. However, a few band members are seen as puppets, flying through the air during the explosive climax. Individual band members include Elmer, Eugene, and Estelle. With the exception of two full-bodied penguins who fire the cannon, Nicky Napoleon and company end at the waist. Scissor lifts within the orchestra pit raise and lower the penguins to the audience's view. Puppet versions of the band were also used in episodes of ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Little_Muppet_Monsters Little Muppet Monsters]''.{{MuppetsWiki}}
