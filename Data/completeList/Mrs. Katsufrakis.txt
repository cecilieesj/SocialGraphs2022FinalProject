She is known to have foreign pronunciation in English, as opposed to her husband. Usually when Mrs. Katsufrakis says something, Tish and, rarely, her husband, pronounce it properly so Tish's friends, or even they themselves can understand. She is nicknamed "Berschtuki" meaning "She who loves soup".
