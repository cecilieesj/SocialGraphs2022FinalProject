'''Evil Jake''' is a minor character from the television show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

==History==
He is the evil counterpart of [[Jake Long]]. He is accidentally created by Jake and attempts to take his place by absorbing his chi energy. He only appears in the episode "[[The Doppelganger Gang]]" in Season 2 and never makes another appearance.

==Origin==
In "[[The Doppelganger Gang]]", Jake learns the benefits of splitting his chi energy into perfect copies of himself, which are called Doppelgangers. But, when [[Brad Morton|Brad]] challenges Jake to a fight, Jake attempts to make another clone to take the hit in his stead. However, Jake inadvertently uses a negative chi amplifier that causes the new Doppelganger to be 100% evil, hence creating an Evil Jake clone.

==Physical Appearance==
Evil Jake looks exactly like the original Jake, but with slightly darker colors. The evil doppelganger eventually goes on to absorb the other Jake doppelgangers in an attempt to overpower the real Jake. In the end, Jake reabsorbs Evil Jake's chi, possibly destroying him.

==Episode Appearances==
===Season Two===
*"[[The Doppelganger Gang]]"Â 

==Notes==
*While "Yang Jake" apparently was used in production and script to differentiate from Good Jake<ref>http://www.jeffgoode.com/tv/americandragon/dragons/yangjake.htm</ref>, as the name was never used in the show, this is a rare case of ''Official'' yet ''Non-Canon''.
*The darker tone foreshadows him being different.
*[[Evil Jake]] is similar to [[NomiRandy]] from ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]], ''Dark Danny from ''Danny Phantom'', and Nega Ben from ''Ben 10: Omniverse''.
