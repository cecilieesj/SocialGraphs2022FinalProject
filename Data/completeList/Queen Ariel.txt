==Physical appearance==
The queen wears a gold crown, white Greek dress, and had long light blonde hair and wore green earrings, a white toga and a gold headband.

==Appearances==
===''[[DuckTales]]''===
Queen Ariel was captured by [[Circe (DuckTales)|Circe]], and warned her not to try to hurt her king, but the evil sorceress told her that she will do nothing except "wallow in the mud" with a magic word from the magic medallion. As a demonstration, she turns the queen into a pig while Circe masquerades as the queen. At the end of the episode, Queen Ariel and her king were back to normal, and Circe was turned into a pig by her own magic.

==Trivia==
*She shares the same name with [[Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', though she is a princess while this Ariel is a queen.
