'''Feldspar''' is the cobbler who appears in the show, ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''.

==Role in theÂ [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==
Feldspar occasionally appeared as a minor role in the series. He also appeared in the animated short, "[[Hare Peace]]", where he asked [[Rapunzel]] to watch over his "precious". Rapunzel misunderstood "precious" being a bunny in a flowerbed, when Feldspar was referring to a head of cabbage. In "[[Fitzherbert P.I.]]", Feldspar hired [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] for a job as a cobbler, but quickly fired him after remembering that he stole a pair of boots from him once.

Feldspar played a much larger role in "[[Painter's Block]]", where he became the first victim of an evil spirit named [[Mrs. Sugarby]]. He was hypnotized to free her master, Zhan Tiri, followed by [[Lance Strongbow]], [[Ulf]], [[Freidborg]] and Rapunzel. His disappearance attracted the [[Captain of the Guards|Captain's]] attention, and assigned [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] to investigate.

In "[[The Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne]]", Feldspar and the other are in the Corona Castle's Throne Room, which was damaged from the event of Rapunzel's Return. Later, he partners with Rapunzel.

==Trivia==
*Feldspar is voiced by [[Zachary Levi]], who also voices [[Flynn Rider]].
*His full name, Feldspar Willipeg, was mentioned by the [[Captain of the Guards]] in "[[Painter's Block]]".
*Feldspar's distinct voice and characteristics were inspired by vaudevillian actor and comedian [[Ed Wynn]].
*Feldspar can read Saporian language in "[[The Lost Treasure of Herz Der Sonne]]".
