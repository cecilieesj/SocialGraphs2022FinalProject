* He seems to be out of town a lot.

(Taking money out of the mall fountain, claiming his wish is to earn more money; giving Ally an allowance of fish sticks (Soups & Stars); getting a popcorn machine from a dump (myTAB & My Pet); ordering the inventory for the store all at once to save 4 dollars and 36 cents; etc.)
