==Background==
The unnamed father of Pacha was going to appear in the early version for ''The Emperor's New Groove''. However, the character was removed from the film (along with Owen) and the scene got scrapped because it didn't seem to be working. However, on ''The Emperor's New Groove'' DVD, the scene where he was having a family conversation and throwing a party for Kuzco as a llama is in the deleted scenes.
