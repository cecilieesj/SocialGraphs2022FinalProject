'''Lava''' is a character featured in the extinct [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]]".

==History==

===Background===
Lava serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the former Japan-exclusive overlay of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, she and the other four emcee birds create a plan to wake up the Tikis by playing various songs to wake up. After some failed attempts, they finally wake up after Lava herself performs the musical number "Fever" with the [[Tiki Totem Poles]] to which the [[Tiki Room Drummers|Tiki Drummers]] suddenly start being active. After this, she and the other emcee birds celebrate together just before guests leave the attraction.

===Development History===
The Tiki Room attraction at Tokyo Disneyland originally opened as a Japanese version of the original show featuring the original emcee birds [[Jos√©]], [[Michael]], [[Pierre]], and [[Fritz]]. The attraction closed in Tokyo in [[1999]] and was rethemed as "Get the Fever!" where the four original emcee birds were removed where they were replaced by Lava, Danno, Scats, and Buddy with the attraction having a different storyline compared to the original incarnation.

"Get the Fever!" closed in early [[2008]] and was later reopened as "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]" where the hosts from the "Get the Fever!" incarnation were replaced by four new emcee bird hosts: Manu, Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli.

==Role in the attraction==
During the show, Lava is introduced by the announcer during the intro number "[[The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room]]" alongside Danno, Scats, and Buddy to which after singing to the guests that the Tiki Room is having a long slumber, the other emcee bird hosts encouraged the guests to clap along to wake up the Tikis while Buddy and Scats sing along. Buddy then asks Lava explaining to know if she can find someone who can party to which Lava tells the other hosts to hang on to their feathers as she has a group of [[Showgirl Birds]] to begin their musical Number. As Lava begins the musical number "[[Hot, Hot, Hot]]", the other four emcee birds sing along with them where they all sing together. During the end of the song, she tells the Showgirl Birds to get out of here before her friends lose control to which the Showgirl Birds suddenly leave, ending the song. Despite this, the attempt to wake up the Tikis was unsuccessful.

Losing hope that the Tikis would never wake up, Lava then tells the other emcee birds that she has a better plan to wake up the Tikis in which the [[Tiki Totem Poles|Totem Poles]] from the attraction join in with her singing and while singing the musical number "Fever", the plan to wake them up was successful. As the Tikis finally wake up, she tells the other emcee birds "Down, boys!" as the tikis continue to chant along to which the song ends to bring in a thunderstorm effect like in the original Disneyland incarnation. After the plan to wake up the Tikis was successful, Lava and the other birds celebrate with the other Tiki Room birds with a special rendition of "[[I Wan'na Be Like You]]" just before she and the other emcee birds bid a farewell to the guests.
