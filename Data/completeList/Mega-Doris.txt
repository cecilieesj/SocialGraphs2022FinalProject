'''Mega-Doris''' is a huge hat-like robot and a major antagonist in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''. Despite her appearance, Mega-Doris is not actually a hat but rather a giant robot when Bowler Hat Guy alters Lewis' future.

==Appearances==
===''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''===
Mega-Doris is (possibly) the largest model of the helping hats and a giant version of [[DOR-15|Doris]] that serves as a body that she can control. This form was present in the alternate future of ''Meet the Robinsons'' where Doris ruled the world replacing the Robinsons' original home. However, her use against Doris' original creator, [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]], was short-lived when Lewis fixed the original time machine in time before he was cornered by the giant and prevented the alternate timeline from occurring, and she was wiped out from existence when Doris was erased.

==Trivia==
*In the [[Meet the Robinsons (video game)|''Meet the Robinsons'' video game]], Mega-Doris is the final boss of the game.
