'''The Witch''' is a character of the classic fairy tale ''{{WikipediaLink|Hansel and Gretel}}'' and the main antagonist of the ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' short ''[[Babes in the Woods]]''. She was depicted as an evil witch who lived in a gingerbread house, which she used to lure children like [[Hansel and Gretel]] and fatten them up so she can eat them afterwards.

She was a prototype of [[the Evil Queen]]'s witch form, and was also an inspiration for the [[Witch in the Candy House]], and the [[Blind Witch]] on ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Babes in the Woods]]''===
Seeing Hansel and Gretel in the forest while flying on her broom, the Witch landed on the ground and convinced them to fly with her. The trio flew together on the broom until they reached her Gingerbread house, where she watched the two children eat candy.

She invited the children inside, but they later realized that she was an evil witch and it was too late as she had locked them inside. She showed them her pets and told them that she will transform them into animals too. Hansel and Gretel tried to escape, but were caught in her web, and the Witch decided to turn Hansel into an animal first.

She drenched him in a blue potion which transformed him into a spider, and after seeing a cat protesting at her behavior, she grabbed a spoonful of potion from her cauldron, and threw it at the chained animal, turning it into stone. She then took a hold of Gretel whom she was about to transform into a rat, but the potion was hit by an arrow before she can pour it on her. She then put Gretel in a trap door in the floor and decided to chase the dwarfs who were throwing arrows at her, but she was outnumbered, and decided to run away instead.

She tried to leave, but was chased by the dwarfs who were flying on geese and firing arrows, pumpkins and pies at her. They eventually took a hold of her broom, causing her to fall to the ground, and the children she had transformed into animals placed her into a cauldron where she was about to fall, causing her to splash in and turn to stone. She tried to walk away, but was turned into stone before she can. The children then stood around her stone body and celebrated.

Eventually the area around her turned into a forest where animals live and is called "The Witch Rock".

===''[[Hansel and Gretel (1982 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]''===
In Tim Burton's TV film The Witch is portrayed as a woman who lives in a gingerbread and candy house who tries to eat lunch and kill Hansel and Gretel.
