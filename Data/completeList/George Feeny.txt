'''George Feeny''' is a major character in ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and ''[[Girl Meets World]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Boy Meets World]]''===
George Feeny is initially [[Cory Matthews|Cory]]'s sixth grade teacher as well as the neighbor of the Matthews family. As the series progresses, he starts working in the John Adams High School, just when the main characters begin to attend there. Eventually, he becomes the principal, and later on a college professor at Pennbrook. From the start of the series, Mr. Feeny attempts to be strictly a teacher to his students, but later develops close relationships with Cory, [[Shawn Hunter|Shawn]], [[Topanga Matthews|Topanga]] and especially [[Eric Matthews|Eric]]. Mr Feeny can always be found in his garden, when he's not in school, and his absence often shocks the Matthews. The family has gotten used to being able to talk to Mr Feeny about anything, and getting valuable advice in return. Similarly, Mr Feeny seems stressed when he knows something important has occurred, yet no one has come to him for any advice, as seen in "Raging Cory".
