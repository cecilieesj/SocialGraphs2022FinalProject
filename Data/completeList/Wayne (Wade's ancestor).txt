[[File:Screen shot 2011-10-16 at 12 41 37 AM.png|thumb|250px|right|Wayne 100 years ago]]'''Wayne''' is a minor character from the animated television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''.
==History==
He is the supposed great-great grandfather of [[Wade]] appearing only in the episode "[[Rewriting History]]." He was a photographer when [[Professor Demens]]' machine was stolen and is still active. He is about 110-years-old.

==Trivia==
*Just like all of the other characters' ancestors, Wayne looks identical to Wade when he was young.

==Notes==
*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after Kim and Ron wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Wayne was "real".
