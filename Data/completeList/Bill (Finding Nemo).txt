'''Bill''' is a character who appears in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Finding Dory]]''.

==Background==
Not much of Bill's personality is known other than living in the Open Ocean exhibit and clipping the seagrass on a small rock. Bill speaks in a high-pitched tone. When [[Dory]] approaches him and his wife, he explains that the blue tangs are being shipped to an aquarium at Cleveland and when Dory feels insecure about traveling via pipes, Bill warns that she would stay in the [[Marine Life Institute]] forever if she doesn't go through the pipes.

==Role in the film==
After [[Hank]] drops [[Dory]] into the Open Ocean exhibit at the [[Marine Life Institute]] and Dory arrives at the spot where she was caught in the current as a young fish, she hears Bill's wife to know where her tag is at (due to Dory giving Hank her tag so that Dory can avoid being shipped to a permanent aquarium). As Dory asks her about the quarantine area, to which Bill explains to his wife that the blue tangs are being shipped to a permanent aquarium at Cleveland by dawn. Bill's wife then tells Dory to go through the pipes in order to get the spot where the blue tangs are at. Feeling unsure about this, Bill tells Dory that she will be stuck forever if she doesn't go to the area, to which his wife tells Dory to go to the area safely. Feeling determined about this, Bill's wife tells Dory to take two lefts and a right in order to get to the quarantine area just as Dory plans to follow what the crabs tell her. Bill and his wife are never seen afterwards.
