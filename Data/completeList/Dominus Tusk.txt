'''Dominus Tusk''' is a giant minotaur who served as a frequent, albeit usually minor, threat and was often quickly disposed of by [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and his friends. He appeared in the episodes "[[A Clockwork Hero]]", "[[Armored and Dangerous]]" and "[[While the City Snoozes]]"

===="[[A Clockwork Hero]]"====
In this episode'','' he challenges the local hero for a one-on-one duel for control of the city of [[Agrabah]]. As [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] was about to take on the challenge, only to find himself unable to lift the battle axe that Tusk gave him for the duel. Even [[Genie]] was helpless in the fights with Tusk. When the mighty minotaur was about to smash Al with his battle mace, young Wahid, working the controls of [[Mechanicles]]' "son", Junior, interfered in the battle and challenged the monster, where he managed to knock Tusk into a wall where he hung by his horns. With his first defeat (and humiliating one at that), Dominus Tusk relinquished victory to Junior. Later on in the episode, Genie and [[Carpet]] are seen playing a "Sock'Em, Bop'em, Robots" game of Junior and Tusk. Dominus Tusk appears again near the end of the episode where he wants a re-match (still sore about being stuck in a wall) only to lose that battle before he can even finish his battle speech as Genie crashed landed on him after he was trying to fight the newly adjusted Junior, meaning Tusk lost to the robot again, only indirectly.

===="[[Armored and Dangerous]]"====
In this episode, Tusk somehow grew 10x his normal size and was terrorizing the city of Agrabah. After destroying buildings, easily taking care of the city's army, and knocking [[Jasmine]] out cold; [[Sultan]] took upon himself to stop the giant minotaur from devastating the entire city by donning the invincible Armor of [[Kileem]], an evil ancestor of his family. Shortly after this, Sultan had Dominus Tusk outmatched in speed and strength. After an intense battle, Tusk's horns were mounted on the wall in the Sultan's newly refurbished throne room, so presumably killed by the Sultan, whose was being possessed by the evil spirit of Kileem.

===="[[While the City Snoozes]]"====
In this episode, Tusk appeared in cameo as [[Iago]] had a dream in which Iago defeats him single handed, winning respect and fountain of the city, only to have [[Mirage (Aladdin)|Mirage]] turn his dream into a nightmare by having [[Jafar]] in it.
