Athena is first seen at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], where a young [[Frank Walker]] shows off his invention: an experimental Jet Pack, to [[David Nix]].

She is next seen on [[It's a Small World]], with Nix and the rest of his guests. She is later seen welcoming Frank to [[Tomorrowland (location)|Tomorrowland]].

Many years later, she gives a pin to [[Casey Newton]], whom she believes is the key to saving the world.
