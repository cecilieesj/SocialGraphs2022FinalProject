'''Charles "Chucky" Albertson''' is a twelve-year-old boy who got injured trying to copy Iron Weasel's signature move, the move, the "Weasel Slap", in ''[[I'm in the Band]]''<span style="font-weight:normal;line-height:1.5em;">.</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> He hates being called "Chucky", due to it rhyming with Sucky. He likes [[Izzy Fuentes|Izzy]] because she reminds him of his mother. Charles tried to to get revenge on Iron Weasel for humiliating him on live TV, by calling him "Chucky", causing him to throw a temper tantrum. Since Iron Weasel has a record deal with his stepfather, he appears more often.</span>

He first appears when Iron Weasel creates a move that injures him, and they were forced to obey him due to not wanting more bad publicity, until they make him throw a tantrum on live TV, by calling him "Chucky" in their song.

He later appears when they are babysitting him, and they almost lose their recording deal because they don't have a song to record for their album, but he just ends up giving them an idea for the song to save their recording deal (and [[Tripp Campbell|Tripp]] calls him "Chucky").

He makes a 3rd appearance when they babysit him again, but he goes missing, and they must find him due to thinking that Simon knew he ran away.

He makes a 4th appearance when they torture him because they think he stole their advance money for their new album.
