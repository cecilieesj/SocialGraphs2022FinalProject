He also appears in Tim Burton's ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'' where Jack finds him the sewers upon his return. The Clown then unlocks the gate so that Jack could proceed to the graveyard. In the residential areas, the Clown's unicycle was out of control causing Jack to use one of Dr. Finklestein's inventions to stop the unicycle. He is voiced by Danny Elfman in the movie and by Dee Bradley Baker in the video game spin-off.
