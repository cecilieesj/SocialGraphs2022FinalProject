He met Opal when he moved to Lake Hoohaw from the city. At first, Opal was apprehensive to give him a chance, but the two soon fell in love. While Ernest can sometimes be a little goofy, Peanut, Butter, and Jelly still look up to him as a good father.Â 
Ernest owns and maintains his own general store boat called "Dad's General Store". He has sold a number of things there, from Peanut's shoes to Pompaloafers. Ernest was taught how to run the store by Captain Camel.
