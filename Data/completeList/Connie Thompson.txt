}}'''Constance Erica "Connie" Thompson''', more commonly known as '''Creepy Connie''', is a character and antagonist from ''[[Jessie (TV series)|Jessie]]''.

==History==
She is a 14-year-old girl who had an obsessive, psychotic crush on Luke Ross. In "Creepy Connie Comes a Callin'", her debut episode, she is his math tutor. Jessie has no clue how creepy Connie can be. Connie wrongly accuses Jessie and Luke of being a couple. Soon Jessie finds out who she really is, and when Connie breaks into the Ross house dressed as a dementor from Harry Potter, everyone realizes that she's a psycho, except for Luke who knew it all along. In "Creepy Connie's Curtain Call", she tried out for Jessie's play, and got cast as a tumbleweed. Because the female lead got to kiss Luke, she got rid of all the other female leads so she could have it and kiss Luke. In the end, she reveals the reason she obsesses over Luke is because she doesn't think any guy will be into her. Then Ravi says he'd be happy to have any girl (including Connie) as a girlfriend, and they hit it off.
