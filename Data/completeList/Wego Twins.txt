Both twins are voiced by [[Fred Savage]]<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000625/</ref>. They are members of [[Team Go]], a group of superheroes, and the youngest brothers of [[Hego]], [[Shego]], and [[Mego]].

==History==
The Wego twins are the youngest members of Team Go. The fact their siblings never refer to them in singular form and call them, "the twins" and they both remained after their powers were stolen by [[Aviarius]] suggests they may actually have been twins before gaining their powers. They have a very positive and friendly attitude, though they are not as naive as [[Hego]]. The Wego twins' Go costume color is red and black.

==Powers==
*'''Duplication/Self-Replication:''' They share the Red Glow power of self-replication, both being able to produce multiple identical copies of themselves which they can use to overwhelm targets. They can also reabsorb their duplicates without a problem.

==Appearances==
The twins appeared in [[Go Team Go]] and [[Stop Team Go]]. They were mentioned by Hego in [[Mathter and Fervent]]. They made a very small appearance in [[Graduation]] Part 2, at Drakken's award ceremony, sitting in the row behind the villains.

==Relationships==
===[[Hego]]===

Not much is shown of their relationship with their oldest brother but it is shown that they care for him and vice versa, in Go Team Go.

===[[Mego]]===

Their relationship with Mego is unclear.

===[[Shego]]===

Their relationship with Shego is not shown apart from them hugging her at the end of Stop Team Go. It is obvious Shego cares for them as she went with Hego, Mego, Kim, and Ron to rescue them from Aviarius in Go Team Go.

==Trivia==
*Apart from a couple-frame error in Stop Team Go, the Wegos do not wear pouches on their ankles like Mego and Shego do, who are the only members of Team Go who do.
*Just like [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]]'s twin brothers [[Jim & Tim Possible]], the Wego twins have the same voice actor.
