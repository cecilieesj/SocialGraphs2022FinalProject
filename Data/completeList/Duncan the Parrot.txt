'''Duncan the Parrot''' is a character at [[Typhoon Lagoon]].

== History ==
=== Background ===
Duncan is a blue/turquoise parrot which at some point became the pet of Captain [[Mary Oceaneer]].  In the mid-20th century, they went on a treasure-hunting expedition in the Floridian lagoon of Placid Palms.  However, their ship, the M.S. Salty IV, got caught in a large hurricane which completely terraformed the landscape, marooning them in what would become known as "Typhoon Lagoon".

Oceaneer and Duncan would come to reside in Typhoon Lagoon with their treasures and equipment scattered about the land. They would start an operation to reclaim their property and it would become something of a tourism feature amongst the guests who visited the lagoon.

== Appearances ==
===[[Miss Adventure Falls]]===
Duncan is seen on the life-hill and within the cracked hull of the M.S. Salty IV, looking out of a spyglass at his and Mary's operations while making comments aloud to himself.

== Trivia ==
* Duncan's name is a play on the word, "Dunking" fitting into the Typhoon Lagoon motif of water-based word-play.
* Duncan is the first Disney Parks character to be an audio-animatronic installed in a water park attraction.
