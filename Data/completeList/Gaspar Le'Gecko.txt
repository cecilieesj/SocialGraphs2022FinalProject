==Personality==
He is the self-appointed dictator/entrepreneur/musical director of the Amazon Rainforest. However, the only reason he is the leader is because no one else bothered to take the position. He has a strong desire to eat [[Mr. Whiskers]] and he often tries to make schemes in order to gain an opportunity to do such. Gaspar is one of the few individuals in the Rainforest who has the ability to help [[Brandy Harrington|Brandy]] get back home to civilization, though after Brandy betrayed him by going back on his deal in the first episode, he hasn't since offered to help her out again. Gaspar is often seen with his monkey henchmen, and often serves as the antagonist of the series.

Gaspar also tends to like using others (mostly Brandy and/or Whiskers) to get what he wants. However, Gaspar has shown a softer side of somewhat friendship to Brandy and Whiskers when it suits his best interests. He also displays a more sensitive side that he usually keeps to himself, such as liking ballet and little dolls. He is somewhat in love with Brandy and tries to get her to go out with him (such as getting some woman to play his mother), despite the fact he already has a girlfriend; an upscale basilisk lizard named Gabriella.

== Appearances ==

=== Brandy & Mr. Whiskers Theme ===
