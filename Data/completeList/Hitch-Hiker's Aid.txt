'''The Hitch-Hiker's Aid''' is an attraction at the [[Museum of Modern Marvels]] from ''[[Modern Inventions]]''.

==Function==
If a car drives by, the briefcase opens to release a robot that flashes the word stop from the area where its mouth is.

==Problems==
If the Hitch-Hiker's Aid is tricked into coming out, it pokes out the eyes of the person who tricked it before going back into its briefcase.

==Mannerisms==
The Hitch-Hiker's Aid has a glass bulb mouth that makes it look like it's smiling. If annoyed however, the glass bulb seems to reflect that fact.
