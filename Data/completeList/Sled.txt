}}'''Sled''' is a Winter-Animal-talent sparrow man. He appears in the ''[[Disney Fairies]]'' films ''[[Secret of the Wings]]'' and ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''.

==Background==
As noted above, Sled is a Winter-Animal-talent fairy. He lives in the Winter Woods portion of [[Pixie Hollow]] which is notably forbidden to the non-frost-talent fairies and sparrow men.

==Appearances==
===''[[Secret of the Wings]]''===
Sled is first seen meeting up with the messenger owls at their landing point. There, Sled finds a book on Wingology from the warm seasons. Lord Milori orders Sled to hand the book over to Dewey, the keeper of fairy knowledge, who'll be able to return it. Later on, the book turns out to belong to Tinker Bell, a warm fairy that is revealed to be the sister of Sled's friend, [[Periwinkle]]. Tinker Bell and Periwinkle are forbidden from seeing each other since the border law denies fairies access from crossing the border that separates the Winter Woods from the warm seasons. If a warm fairy were to cross the border, their wings would freeze and shatter. And if a frost fairy were to cross, their wings would shrivel in the sun and fall off.

However, Tink and her friends create a machine that can create snow with a giant ice block. Sled and his friends are able to provide the ice block and the machine is a success, for a short time. Eventually, the block melts and Peri's wings begin to shrivel. She's rushed back over the border and recovers. Lord Milori and Queen Clarion then declare that Tinker Bell and Periwinkle may never see one another again. Afterward, the snowmaking machine freezes parts of Pixie Hollow, throwing off the balance of the seasons. If the fairies aren't able to save the Pixie Dust Tree from being frozen to death, there would be no pixie dust ever again, making fairy life impossible.

Sled and the others are able to use their frost magic to preserve the tree. While he does so, he grabs [[Rosetta]]'s blanket that flew away, hands it back, and tells her to stay warm and Rosetta becomes rather smitten. After all is good, Queen Clarion and Lord Milori allow warm fairies to cross over, so long as their wings are protected.

===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''===
Sled makes an appearance in ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''. Like every fairy in the coliseum, he is Zarina's victim after she releases pollen that makes them fall asleep
