{{Quote|Bork! Bork! Bork!|The Swedish Chef's catchphrase|The Muppets}}
'''The Swedish Chef''' is the incomprehensible preparer of foodstuffs from ''[[Wikipedia:The Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]''. A rather literal variation of the live-hand Muppet concept, the Swedish Chef is a humanoid character, with human hands rather than gloves.

==Background==
The Swedish Chef was a regular among the Muppets in ''The Muppet Show''. His sketches in it began with him singing his signature song in a trademark mock Swedish, a semi-comprehensible gibberish which parodies the characteristic vowel sounds of Swedish. After this introduction, the Chef continues to speak gibberish while preparing a particular recipe. His commentary is spiced with the occasional English word to clue the viewer into what he is attempting.

In episode 316, Danny Kaye, portraying the chef's uncle in a sketch, claims that the Swedish Chef's first name is Tom. However, since Kaye was not a blood relative, in reality, this information may be considered apocryphal. Many years later on ''[[The Muppets (2015)|The Muppets]]'', [[Christina Applegate]] misinterprets his name as Megan in "Bear Left Then Bear Write", when he was actually just saying, "me, me."<ref>[https://twitter.com/BobKushell/status/653663904925548544 @BobKushell on Twitter] 4:09 PM - 12 Oct 2015</ref>

The Swedish Chef has appeared in every Muppet movie to date and is one of only a handful of characters to have a speaking role in every film. In ''The Muppet Movie'', he operates the projector for the film. In ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'', he appears as the chef for the boars on the island, wearing a pig snout. The vegetables break the fourth wall regarding his appearance, commenting "well, how else did you think we were going to get him into this movie?"

===Development===
According to [[Brian Henson]] in one of his introductions for ''The Muppet Show'', [[Jim Henson]] had this tape that he used to play which was 'How to Speak Mock Swedish':<blockquote>"''He used to drive to work and I used to ride with him a lot. And he would drive to work trying to make a chicken sandwich in Mock Swedish or make a turkey casserole in Mock Swedish. It was the most ridiculous thing you had ever seen. And people at traffic lights used to stop and sort of look at him a little crazy. But that was the roots of the character that would eventually become the Swedish Chef''."</blockquote>Jim Henson had previously explored the idea of a funny foreign chef at the US Food Fair that took place in Hamburg, [[Germany]] in [[1961]], where ''Sam and Friends'' character Omar prepared a flaming salad while speaking in some quite comprehensible mock German that Henson and Jerry Juhl had previously scribbled down in phonetics.<ref>[http://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/2010/11/15/11-1969/ Jim Henson's Red Book], 11/1961 - "Jerry and I did show in Hamburg, Germany â€“ Dept. of Agriculture."</ref>

==Trivia==
*The Chef's gibberish gained a life of its own with the creation of a Unix filter capable of converting standard English to Chefspeak in [[1992]]. The filter quickly became a staple of hacker culture and eventually spread to the mainstream with Swedish Chef translators on several Web sites such as Google. In [[2003]], Opera Software published a special Bork version of its internet browser that turned the MSN Web site into mock Swedish. Mozilla Firefox also contains a popular add-on called Bork Bork Bork! that allows the selective translation of text from Web pages of the user's choice.
*While The Swedish Chef normally has live human hands, he also occasionally has Muppet hands.
*It is implied that the Swedish Chef is, or has at least, married. A wedding ring has appeared on the Swedish Chef's left hand as early as [[2006]]. In [[2014]], a plush version of the character donning his ring was released to coincide with the release of ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''.
*The Chef is one of the few regular characters from ''The Muppet Show'' whose original dialogue from the English version remains the same in most Non-English speaking countries.
*According to the inside gatefold cover for ''The Muppet Revue'', The Swedish Chef was actually born in Denmark and moved to Sweden when he was a baby.
*The Swedish Chef has appeared, at least briefly, in every Muppet film to date.
