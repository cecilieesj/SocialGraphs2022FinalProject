==Background==
Mama Gunda is the mother of [[Uto and Kago]]. She is short in both height and temper.

She does not like it when her sons fight and always scolds them for doing so by shouting, "LIPS!" and pulling them down to her eye level by their bottom lips and, as soon as they agree to stop fighting, she release their lips and both collapse. Mama Gunda is clearly not all bad though since when [[Kala]] and the infant gorillas are almost knocked off the waterfall, she and her sons are quite dismayed, it clearly being an accident.

When [[Zugor]] compliments her eyes during a scuffle, Mama Gunda becomes smitten, redeeming herself, and becomes his mate, moving in with him along with her sons.

==Role in the film==
Little is known about her past other than how Mama Gunda and her sons were exiled from their herd due to Kago's violent behaviors and Uto's extreme dimwittedness, being constantly driven away no matter where they settled after they were exiled. Mama Gunda and her sons [[Uto and Kago]] live trapped in a canyon, believing the only way out to be blocked by a monster they only know as the [[Zugor]]. They have heard it is horrible howling, but never seen it – which is because Zugor is just an elderly male gorilla howling through a log to amplify his voice and make others leave him alone by scaring them off.

When they learn this, Mama Gunda is angered and shocked that her and her sons were stuck in the valley for nothing. She then leads her sons to attack and destroy Zugor's home, then moves on to attempt to take over Tarzan's tribe, planning to replace [[Kerchak]] as the alpha male of the tribe with her own sons. Being met partway by Kala, some young gorilla babies, Tarzan, and Zugor, there is a brief scuffle between Zugor and Mama Gunda, during which Zugor accidentally lets the beans spill that he thinks Mama Gunda has beautiful eyes. This stuns Mama Gunda as she had never been complimented before and they immediately fall for each other. Mama Gunda then orders her sons to stop fighting and tells them they shall never fight with anyone again before leading them off to rebuild Zugor's home so they can all live together as their own tribe.

==Trivia==
* It is unknown who her previous mate was or what became of him.
