The '''King''' is a one-shot ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' villain, appearing in the episode "[[Paraducks]]". He is an Elvis impersonator who terrorizes St. Canard at least during the 1960s. He is the vocalist and guitarist of a band that doubles as his gang of crooks. Their main objective is monetary gain, but they are willing to use force and commit murder to get at it and even have higher aspirations of city-scale authority. The King's main weapon in this is a guitar named Cecile, which is capable of sound-based destruction. As can be inferred from the fact he gave her a name, the King thinks highly of her. The only other that can lay claim to a favored bond is Lamont, the King's younger brother and fellow gang member, whom he is highly supportive of.
