==Background==
Not much of Axel's personality is known other than his duty as a carnival barker. However, when it comes to him finding a grand prize, he tells guests to win the prize at Star Adventurer.

==Role in the film==
Axel first appears looking at [[Buzz Lightyear]] lying down on the ground in an attempt to rescue [[Woody]]. Finding it unusual, he puts Buzz Lightyear on the grand prize spot and tells visitors to play Star Adventurer to win Buzz Lightyear. He next appears in the background listening to music on his headphones while a guest fails to hit a target during game. Buzz, however, manages to escape with help from [[Ducky and Bunny]].

In the mid-credits scene, the carnival moves to New Stanton Beach where Axel resumes his duty as a carnival employee of the Star Adventurer game where Woody, [[Bo Peep]], and the other toys help lost toys find new owners where they knock down the targets for guests who couldn't hit it, causing Axel to give the prizes to them. In Ducky and Bunny's imaginary sequence, the two grow into enormous monstrous toys chasing him across the carnival as Axel runs in terror.

==Trivia==
*If one looks closely on Axel's leg, he/she can spot a tattoo of the [[Pizza Planet Truck]]. This makes it the first time the Pizza Planet Truck makes a non-physical appearance in a Pixar film.
*Axel is named after Axel Geddes, an editor of ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.
