'''Vincent Malloy''' is the titular protagonist of [[Tim Burton]]'s [[1982]] short, ''[[Vincent]]''.

==Background==
Vincent Malloy is a seven-year-old boy who pretends to be like actor [[Vincent Price]]. Every fictional sequence which Vincent is pretending to be like Price actually turns to reality which is shown when Vincent is using the fantasy thoughts from his mind to use it into reality only to find out that his mother tells him that he is just pretending to be Vincent Price all along, where the events from his fantasy sequence are not real, much to Vincent's shock.

==Role in the short==
As the short's plot is told in the style of a rhyming poem, Vincent is first seen playing a flute while a black cat enters his house while the narrator is describing Vincent's personality and while pretending to [[Vincent Price]], he then turns off a light in his house where various of his actions portray him being like the aforementioned actor throughout various instances showing fantasy-like sequences depicting horror themes only to find out that the sequences are turned into reality such as digging a graveyard which is revealed to be his mother's flowerbed.

When his mother scolds her son, Vincent sadly returns to his room where his mother tells him to go outside and play which Vincent tried to reply but couldn't speak. Vincent tells his mother that he is possessed by the house which his mother denies, explaining to him that the games he plays are all in his thoughts, which his mother also tells him, "You're not Vincent '''Price''', you're Vincent '''Malloy'''", and telling him to go outside and have some fun. Rather than leaving the house, he still imagines of being like Vincent Price all alone in his house, just as he faints and then quotes a line from ''{{WikipediaLink|The Raven}}'' by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==Trivia==
*According to the narration, Vincent's favorite author is [[Edgar Allan Poe]].
*Vincent's design was later recycled for the character of [[w:c:beetlejuice:Prince Vince|Prince Vince]] from the {{WikipediaLink|Beetlejuice (TV series)|''Beetlejuice'' animated series}}, a series based on the {{WikipediaLink|Beetlejuice|film of the same name}} which is also directed by [[Tim Burton]] himself who also served as the producer of the animated series. However, this is purely a Warner Bros./Nelvana production as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] had no involvement in the series.
**[[w:c:corpsebride:Victor Van Dort|Victor Van Dort]], the protagonist from ''The Corpse Bride'', also has a striking resemblance to Vincent from the short of the same name in which the film is also directed by Burton himself. However, this is purely a Warner Bros. production as Disney had no involvement in the film.
