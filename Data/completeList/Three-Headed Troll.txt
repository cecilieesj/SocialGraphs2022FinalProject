The '''Three-Headed Troll''' is a character from [[EPCOT]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Three-Headed Troll was a being which inhabited the forested troll country of [[Norway]] (and/or the [[Norway Pavilion]] in EPCOT).   As its name would imply, it was a Jotun with three heads and also possessed magical abilities which it would use against humans who entered its domain.

=== Development History ===
The Three-headed troll was created for the attraction [[Maelstrom]] in Epcot's [[World Showcase]].  The design of the trolls and jotunn in the ride being inspired by the artwork of early 20th century illustrator John Bauer.  Trolls in Scandinavian folklore being malevolent spirits that live in nature and which originate from the Jötnar of Norse mythology.  In said mythology, the trolls were born from the toes of the corpse of the dead giant [[Ymir]] before the creation of the universe.

Maelstrom closed in [[2014]] to make way for the attraction ''[[Frozen Ever After]]'', based on the hit [[2013]] film [[Frozen]].

== Appearances ==

=== Maelstrom ===
The Troll appeared during the troll country scene of Maelstrom when guests enter the domain of the Jotunn.  When it became aware of the human mortals having trespassed, it became angered as its heads began talking to one another.

It then used its magical powers to send their boats backwards down a waterfall.  As the guests fell backwards, a [[Nokk|Nokken]] emerged from the water with shining yellow eyes before the guests found themselves in the lair of yet another troll, this time a rock troll.

=== Royal Sommerhaus ===
A tapestry within the Royal Sommerhaus where [[Arendelle]] royalty can be found depicts the trolls.  The tapestry shows the troll's three heads looming overtop of a waterfall with the rock-troll from the ride at the bottom of the falls.  The swirling magic of the trolls appears overhead of them.

== Trivia ==
* The troll's magic effect was repurposed in Frozen Ever After for the magical powers of [[Elsa]].
* Trolls still appear in the ride which was once Maelstrom, albeit as the [[Trolls (Frozen)|stone trolls]] from Frozen.
