He is one of the failed prototypes of [[Stitch]], possessing all the same powers, but turned out to be a real klutz; he accidentally knocks over and/or breaks anything he touches and only says, "Woops!" after doing so, hence his name. His one true place is at Kokaua Town Lanes as a champion bowler on [[Pleakley]]'s bowling team, the Kokaua Bowling Brawlers.

==Background==
===Personality===
Woops is a very clumsy, accident-prone, and unbalanced experiment. He is easily guilty but never mourns over past accidents or incidents. He apologizes as often as he falls, and his personality is rather clownish and dim-witted. He is usually seen swaying side to side, laughing awkwardly, and picking his nose with his finger. He is left-footed and can get upset if abandoned or contained for periods of time.

An amiable sort, Woops merely wants to do the right thing but just can't seem to do it. He can hardly seem to stand on his own two feet, let alone keep his balance, and is always running into objects and knocking them over. Most people find him unbearably annoying, but he is a bowling champion.

===Physical appearance===
Woops physically resembles Stitch, but with different body proportions. His body is bean-shaped, and he has long, thick limbs, an overbite exposing yellow buckteeth, a large Adam's-apple, a football-shaped head, a huge, bulbous nose, and three short pale mint green-tipped antennae and a tail. His ears and eyes are smaller than Stitch's.

===Powers and abilities===
Woops has all the powers of Stitch, including super-strength and durability, but he is too clumsy and unbalanced to use them. As a result, he unintentionally destroys everything around him. He is skilled at bowling (one of the few things where knocking stuff over is a ''good'' thing).

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 600 was the 600th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Jacques von Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed for [[Stitch]]'s purpose, being indestructible and capable of anything, but was instead a destructive klutz who did nothing except break everything in his path. 600 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture Experiment 626.

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

600's pod was found by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and sent to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]. When the latter discovered that 600 was a prototype of [[Stitch]], Hämsterviel activated the experiment. However, he and the captive experiments were awestruck by 600's klutzy behavior around the [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison]], which alerted the [[UGF Troopers|guards]] and almost blew Hämsterviel's cover in the process.

As a result, Hämsterviel was forced to teleport 600 and the other captive experiments back to Earth on [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], with orders to get rid of 600, since he gave Hämsterviel a headache, and to hold on to the other experiments until Hämsterviel was clear to hold them captive in his prison cell again. Meanwhile, 600's clumsiness around the ship ruined Gantu's azaleas, broke his [[Plasma Blaster|blaster]], and freed [[Nosy]] from containment, allowing him to escape.

Eventually, the mayhem caused by 600's clumsiness drove Gantu crazy enough to offer him to [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and Stitch. 600 was then taken in and named Woops by Lilo. Though initially dismayed by the clumsy experiment, [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] suggested bringing Woops to [[Pleakley]]'s domino tournament (in a quite evil voice). However, upon seeing Woops, Pleakley panicked and demanded them to lock him away until the tournament was over.

Inside a containment orb at the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]], Woops just so happened to sneeze, causing a chain reaction that transported him onto the streets of [[Kokaua Town|town]]. He then started to bounce toward the dominoes.

Just before impact, Stitch caught Woops and let the latter out of his container. Woops suddenly sneezed again, which caused Stitch to stagger backward into the [[Ice Cream Man]], causing the ice cream from his cone to hit the dominoes, much to Pleakley's horror.

Towards the end of the domino toppling, a cat was startled, causing another chain reaction of objects hitting each other until the [[Kilauea Lighthouse|old lighthouse]] was destroyed, plummeting into the ocean.

The events caused Lilo to discover that Woops was good at knocking things over (thanks to his mere clumsiness), and the latter found his one true place at the local bowling alley as a talented bowler (one of the few things where knocking stuff over is a ''good'' thing) on Pleakley's bowling team, the Kokaua Bowling Brawlers.

In [[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]], Nosy explained to Lilo and Stitch that Woops blew the secret about Hämsterviel's experiments so he sent them all back to Gantu.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Woops, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Woops participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Woops is the first known prototype of Stitch and is a massive failure.
**Despite being a failure, Woops did help Stitch more than most other [[experiments]]: by freeing [[Nosy]], he started the chain of events seen in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", which ended up with Lilo and Stitch saving all the other 17 experiments imprisoned by Hämsterviel, including [[Angel]], whom Stitch was feeling the most guilt for letting her be captured by Gantu and shipped to Hämsterviel. Ironically, Woops never met Angel (due to Angel somehow not appearing in Woops' [[Woops (episode)|debut episode]]).
*Unlike most experiments, Woops' number is pronounced as a whole number ("six hundred") instead of three individual digits (which in his case would have been "six-oh-oh") as per the norm for the experiments.
**The only other experiment seen in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]] whose number is also referred to as a whole number is [[Spooky]] (Experiment 300). This implies that experiments whose number is divisible by one hundred (100) are the primary exceptions to the normal by-digit pronunciation of experiment numbers.
*Woops' [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue.
*Woops is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*Woops' design bears a great resemblance to [[w:c:iceage:Sid|Sid]] from the ''{{WikipediaLink|Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age}}'' films. Coincidentally, Disney currently owns the ''Ice Age'' franchise following the studio's acquisition of [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] in [[2019]].
