'''Madeline Robin''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2018]] feature film, ''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]''. She is the daughter of [[Christopher Robin|Christopher]] and [[Evelyn Robin]]. Much like Christopher was at her age, Madeline is kind, friendly, and brave. Madeline is worried about her father's workaholic tendencies, since it means he spends less time with Madeline. She is one of the few people besides Christopher that knows [[Winnie the Pooh]] and the rest of the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] residents are alive.

==Role in the film==
Madeline is forced to study by her father so she can go to a boarding school like he did. She goes to Sussex for the weekend. While studying, her mother tells her to go outside and play in order to cheer herself up. While imitating a Wimbledon cricketer, she meets [[Winnie the Pooh]] and his friends [[Tigger]], [[Eeyore]], and [[Piglet]]. When Christopher Robin leaves Sussex, Tigger takes his important papers, leading Madeline to London in order to help her father. Later during a plan to find Christopher Robin, Madeline, Pooh, and his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood pass by her family's house just as her mother asks her daughter if she would like some lemonade, only to find out that Madeline has left a note linked to Christopher Robin. Furthermore, Evelyn comes to the rescue and tries to catch up with Madeline while arriving at London who is trying to find her father.

Arriving at London, Christopher receives an urgent alert from Katherine Dane warning Christopher that his wife Evelyn couldn't find her daughter and thanks to Katherine's advice, Christopher reunites with his wife just as the couple rides on a car to find Madeline so she can reunite with her family again much to Winslow's worry. Eventually, Madeline loses all Christopher's papers except one which Christopher realizes that this was the only one he needed. He makes the decision to send Madeline to public school. With the problem cleared out, Christopher Robin's family spends the holidays with Pooh and his friends at the Hundred Acre Wood.
