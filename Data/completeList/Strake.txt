{{Quote|With the Strake at my side, no one will ever defy me again.|Lord Fathom}}TheÂ '''Strake''' is a three-headed sea monster that appears in [[Disney Junior]] animated TV series, ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''.

==Background==
[[Lord Fathom]], the evil mer-wizard, once controlled the mighty Strake using the power of the Darklight Emerald in his first attempt to overthrow [[King Neptune]], but with the combined efforts of Neptune and Captain Colossus, they sealed both the Strake and Lord Fathom. The Strake was locked away deep within Dreadnought Cove for years to come.

===Personality===
The Strake is the most fearsome beast in the Never Sea; it is infamous for its savage nature and destructive tendencies and is almost impervious to damage thanks to its tough scales. Because of this, the Strake is almost indomitable by others even if it had once served them, however, an exceptional amount of power from the Darklight Emerald is one way to get the Strake to obey another in the case of Lord Fathom.

==Appearances==
===''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''===
The Strake appears in the episode special ''[[Captain Jake and the Never Land Pirates: The Great Never Sea Conquest|The Great Never Sea Conquest]]''. When the evil mer-wizard Lord Fathom is released from his underwater prison, he sets out to rule the Never Sea by using the Darklight emerald to awaken and control the Strake, the legendary giant three-headed serpent, to his will. Lord Fathom's attempts to revive the Strake are challenged by [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew, and later the Never Land League of Pirate Captains, though with the combined forces of his corrupted subjects and the resurrected ship-wrecks, Lord Fathom slips away and gets off to Dreadnought Cove where he uses the powers of the emerald to awaken the beast from his slumber. The Strake roars at the mer-wizard, not wanting to be controlled, but Fathom uses the emerald's powers to control the Strake and orders it to destroy the Mighty Colossus and kill Captain Jake and his league.

Lord Fathom, Sinker, and the Strake all rise once again to face down Captain Jake. The pirates battle the Strake, and although Jake manages to out-wit it, the monstrous serpent rebounds and overtakes the ship. Right before the Strake is about to drown the pirates, Lord Fathom orders it to back down so that he can challenge Captain Jake. As Lord Fathom is about to win, Captain Jake's sword summons the spirit of King Neptune who convinces him to believe in himself in order to channel the powers of his Mighty Captain Sword to win. Using this advice and discovering his newfound powers within the sword, Captain Jake gains the upper-hand in the battle, overpowering the Strake and stealing the Darklight Emerald from Lord Fathom, stripping him of his power and giving the captain control over the Strake. The young boy orders the Strake to go back into his slumber and the beast has no other choice but to do so. 

Later, after Lord Fathom is exiled from the Never Sea by his subjects, he and Sinker hide out in Dreadnought Cove, where the mer-wizard reveals a piece of the Darklight Emerald he had saved when Jake destroyed it, and vows revenge against Captain Jake and to conquer all of Never Land and the lands beyond, before being chased away by the roars of the angry Strake.

The Strake re-appears in [[Peter Pan's 100 Treasures!]], where the contestants of [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter's]] challenge have to go to Dreadnought Cove to find a scale of the Strake.

In[[Captain Jake and the Never Land Pirates: The Legion of Pirate Villains|''The Legion of Pirate Villains'']], Captain Hook and his crew visit Dreadnought Cove to find the lost treasure of Captain Colossus. Around the same time, Lord Fathom enters the cove to try and release the Strake again now that his power has returned. Unfortunately, he loses the Darklight Emerald after almost being imprisoned by the Grim Buccaneer.
