==Character History==
In the self titled episode ''[[Girl Meets World (episode)|Girl Meets World]]'', Riley is entering "her world" for the first time and is just about to start middle school. Her best friend Maya Hart convinces her to sneak out of the house with her and into the subway. But Cory (Riley's father) stops them, only to let them go with his permission. On the subway, Riley meets [[Lucas Friar]], a boy she immediately develops a crush on. They start their first class of the day, and Cory is the teacher. However, none of the kids (including Riley and Maya) do their work in class and the day is over with disappointment. The next day, Maya leads a rebellion, to which Riley insistently joined in. Faced with the decision of figuring out her "world", Riley figures she would not have it without her best friend and Cory is happy with his daughter's choice in the end.
