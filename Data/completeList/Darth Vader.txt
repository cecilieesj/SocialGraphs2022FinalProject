{{Quote|Your father... was seduced by the dark side of [[the Force]]. He ceased to be [[Anakin Skywalker]] and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed.|[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to [[Luke Skywalker]]}}
'''Darth Vader''' is a central character in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, appearing as the central antagonist of the original trilogy.

Darth Vader is the [[Sith|Sith Lord]] persona of the fallen [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] '''[[Anakin Skywalker]]''' after his turn to the dark side. He remains the central antagonist until the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', when he eventually redeems himself to save his son, [[Luke Skywalker]] from his master [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]], fulfilling the Prophecy as the Chosen One.

==Background==
===Personality===
After [[Anakin Skywalker]] finally embraced his inner darkness, the persona of Anakin ceased to exist, as the Darth Vader persona overtook him almost completely. Unlike most members of the [[Sith|Sith Order]], Vader is not only capable of acknowledging his mistakes, but learning from them as well.

Vader became emotionally traumatized by the experience of the events on [[Mustafar]]. Vader is now terrifying, driven by rage, and his overconfidence has been further greatly amplified to the point of arrogance. However, after his defeat and mutilation on Mustafar at the hands of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], he is no longer as arrogant and overconfident as he previously was. Although he eventually regained confidence in himself, it never came to the point of being outwardly arrogant or cocky.

Vader remains an impatient man, albeit to a far less extent, but generally presents himself as calm and level-headed. He rarely loses his temper and usually has good control over his emotions (something he was not able to do in his youth), but he has an extremely low tolerance for failure and any form of betrayal. Despite this, he is able to tolerate failure from his troops to a certain extent, although he becomes known for frequently killing his own men for even the slightest mistake. He also does not get along well at all with naval officers in the Imperial military. He has little if any tolerance for incompetence or for those who disrespect him for no clear reason, nearly choking Admiral Conan Antonio Motti to death when he disrespected Vader and challenged his powers of the Force. Vader telekinetically strangled Admiral Kendal Ozzel and Captain Lorth Needa for their incompetence. Many higher-ranking officers came to despise the Sith Lord and his "sorcerer's ways" for no clear reason.

Despite Vader's negative relationship with some higher-ranking officers in the military, he does get along reasonably well with the [[Stormtroopers]] because of his front line leadership. One reason Vader became popular with the troops that served under him is his willingness to fight in the front line, and not expect of anyone anything he was not willing to do himself.

As Supreme Commander within the ranks of the Imperial Army of the [[Galactic Empire]], Vader is renowned for his leadership skills and admired by clones, middle/low-ranking officers, Sith, and politicians alike.

Despite what Vader's actions causes upon both himself and the galaxy, he apparently believes he is doing what is good for the galaxy, claiming not to feel regret. However, he actually secretly feels enormous shame and remorse for his actions, whether he wants to admit it or not. His feelings of guilt are so much that he develops a deep self-loathing and even nearly commits suicide at one point.

Vader is determined to never talk about his old life, wanting to distance himself from his painful past as best as possible. As a result, he detests anything that reminds him of his former-self, which he deems to be weak. It is for this reason that he showed no desire to restore the bond he once shared with his former apprentice and friend [[Ahsoka Tano]], as she is a living memory of everything he once was, and in his own twisted way, he became angry at her for leaving him and the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], something he perceived later on as a form of betrayal. Upon their fateful reunion, he did offer to spare her if she told him where the other lost Jedi were hiding, but cruelly resolved to kill her when she refused, and even when she found out he was indeed her former mentor and showed him compassion.

Due to Vader's former status as a slave, he has distress when the concept of slavery is brought up, despite the fact that the Empire made slavery legal again. He also can not return to his home planet [[Tatooine]], as the planet is a painful reminder of him losing his mother, Shmi Skywalker. It was only after he found out about the existence of his son, [[Luke Skywalker]], that Vader was able to muster the ability to return to Tatooine once more, and only because it was in search of information regarding his son.

Vader is cold, brutal, and ruthless towards his enemies, perfectly willing to terrorize, torture, and even murder them in cold-blood, although he does not take pleasure out of it. The exception to this might have been during his trip to Tatooine in search of information regarding his son, Luke Skywalker, during which he slaughtered an entire tribe of [[Tusken Raiders]] (much as he had as Anakin) either out of vengeance or pleasure for what they did to his mother.

Vader is seemingly unfailingly loyal to his master, being [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]] the closest thing he has to a friend. However, in truth he secretly hates his master for deceiving him and ruining his life, even planning to overthrow him one day with his own apprentice. The only reason why Vader continued to serve Palpatine after losing his wife, was because the Emperor was all he had left of his former life as Anakin Skywalker and was the only one that would accept him. Ultimately, Vader is only truly loyal to the people he still cared about (like his son, Luke Skywalker), which is seen with him doing everything possible to protect his son from Palpatine.

In spite of these negative traits, Vader later proves that there was still good left in him. Upon discovering the existence of his son, Luke Skywalker, Vader became emotionally conflicted, unsure whether to continue serving his master or overthrow him with his son. He displayed a sense of compassion for Luke, revealing that some hint of him still had love for his family. This attachment ultimately led to his redemption.

Before the Battle of Endor had begun, Vader strongly believed that he was irredeemable and there was no good left in him. This belief was so strong that in a mental battle between his good and evil halves brought about after once being defeated by a powerful enemy. The evil Vader persona of his personality battled and destroyed the Anakin persona that represented his good side. However, when his son, Luke, was being tortured by Palpatine, he finally broke away from the dark side. At this point, Vader ceased to exist and Anakin returned in full force.

When Anakin sacrifices his life to save his son, before succumbing to the injuries he received from Palpatine, Anakin reconciled with Luke, and thanked his son for never giving up hope in saving him. He then died peacefully, becoming one with the Force.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[The Force]]:''' Vader has an amazingly strong connection to the Force. As the Chosen One, Vader is stronger than any Force-user in existence. According to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Vader's potential in the Force would surpassed that of even [[Yoda]] and [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]] at his full potential. His Force powers were rivaled by his son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Being burned alive on [[Mustafar]] and forced to become a cyborg, with the transformation causing him psychological trauma didn't stop Vader from becoming an amazingly powerful Force-user. Due to his prosthetic arms and hands, however, he can't utilize or be immune to Force lightning, and the life support systems keeping him alive also make him incredibly vulnerable to it, though as long as he was armed with his lightsaber, he could block Force lightning and minimize the risks. To maintain his armor at peak efficiency, Vader also heavily relies on the dark side of the Force and his skill with cybernetics. 
**'''Telekinesis:''' Vader can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. In one issue of Marvel Comics' ''Vader Down'' series, Vader was able to simultaneously fly his TIE Advanced and use his telekinetic abilities to destroy Rebel starfighters, taking out three squadrons of X-wings in this fashion. Additionally, in the sixth issue of ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: The Chosen One'', Vader was shown to efficiently and effortlessly repair his damaged armor through manipulating multiple tools and the armor itself using telekinesis, all while limbless and recovering from his wounds inside a bacta tank. In the eighth issue, he managed to easily levitate the pieces of Jocasta Nu's starfighter and rearrange them back into place after the ship had self destructed, revealing it as a Jedi craft and that she was on the planet, alerting the Imperials station there. He could also effortlessly maintain an air bubble at crushing depths on the watery world of Mon Cala using telekinesis to prevent the water pressure from crushing him as was revealed in the the third issue of ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: Burning Seas''. In the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] TV series, it was also shown that he could pull large starships out of the air with enough effort and rip them apart with terrifying ease, and his prowess with the ability was such that he could block and parry the lightsaber of [[Reva Sevander]] without even needing to draw his own sword, and he even could stop the lightsaber's spinning blades with his telekinesis. 
***'''Force Push:''' Vader can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed. In the ''Lords of the Sith'' novel, Vader's was strong enough to send a large telekinetic pulse capable of ripping apart several Lyleks simultaneously, despite the fact that the creatures' carapaces were impervious to even heavy blaster fire.
***'''Force Pull:''' Vader can telekinetically pull his opponents or objects towards him.
***'''Force Repel:''' Vader can unleash a wave of pure Force energy that knocks back and repels anything within the power's blast radius or pushes multiple opponents simultaneously. He unleashed a telekinetic tremor that destroyed the medical chamber where he was first encased with his armor, while multiple objects and droids were simultaneously crushed, and Sidious was blasted against a wall.
***'''Force Choke:''' Vader can telekinetically choke his opponents to either weaken, kill or intimidate them. He can also do this from a great distance simply by knowing the targets location relative to himself, as he choked Admiral Ozzel from several kilometers away on another ship while looking at him through a view screen. This is also one of his favorite moves.
***'''Force Grip:''' Vader can telekinetically lift his opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them. His abilities also allows him to influence the movements of individuals, as demonstrated when he forced [[Ezra Bridger]] to raise his lightsaber towards his own neck while also pinning him against a wall. Additionally, he was able to freeze two Inquisitors in place before forcing them to activate their lightsabers, and fatally stab the other, all as punishment for their romantic entanglements with each other.
***'''Force Stasis:''' Vader can telekinetically slow down or completely halt the motion of a target, holding them in place with a paralyzing grip. In ''Darth Vader 4: Vader, Part II'', he managed to momentarily freeze the explosion generated by a grenade thrown at him by clone troopers, which, while straining, allowed him time to get out of its blast radius safely before he released it.
***'''Force Levitation:''' Vader can telekinetically levitate himself or slow down his fall to the ground.
***'''Force Crush:''' Vader can telekinetically crush objects or droids.
***'''Force Throw:''' Vader can telekinetically objects and other individuals to be hurled toward a target at an astounding velocity. Vader used this power in his second confrontation against his son, Luke.
***'''Force Barrier:''' Vader can create a barrier or wall of Force energy in front of or surrounding himself or his allies. He notably used this to shield himself from debris in ''Darth Vader 4: Vader, Part IV''.
***'''Saber Throw:''' Vader can telekinetically guide his lightsaber towards his opponents and return the weapon back to his hand, similar to a boomerang or shuriken.
**'''Energy Absorption:''' Vader can dissipate concentrated energy such as blaster bolts with his bare hands, although it is difficult to do so. He notably used this ability on Cloud City to harmlessly absorb [[Han Solo]]'s blasterfire with his hand before telekinetically disarming Han.
***'''Force Deflection:''' Vader can telekinetically redirect incoming attacks such as blaster bolts, with or without his lightsaber, although it is difficult to do so. By the time of the Death Star's creation, he became able to temporarily cause blaster bolts to bounce off his body and back towards his opponents, as he did during his slaughter of a group of rebels that barely managed to get the plans for the superweapon onboard Leia's blockade runner.
**'''Telepathy:''' Vader can telepathically communicate with other individuals over small or vast distances, especially his son, Luke Skywalker. This was shown in a deleted scene of ''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'', in which he managed to communicate with Luke.
***'''Mind Probe:''' Vader can telepathically sense and sift through the thoughts and memories of other sentient beings. This allowed him to sense the thoughts and feelings of Luke when he was emotionally vulnerable, leading to him realizing that Luke had a sister, [[Leia Organa]].
***'''Mind Trick:''' Vader can communicate or control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills. However, he can combine this power with other Force-users to bypass the said indomitable will.
***'''Taming Beasts:''' Vader can control the minds of animals. As seen in ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: Burning Seas- Part 3'', in his attack on Mon Cala to hunt the Jedi Farren Barr, Vader used the Force to tame a large squid. He convinced it to not eat him, bring him his lost lightsaber, and then carry him back to the surface depths.
**'''Force Vision:''' Vader can see visions of the past, present, and future. However, like all Force-users, his visions are not always clear or sometimes they happen without warning.
**'''Force Sense:''' Vader can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users. His senses are so powerful that he was able to sense the presence of his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi on the first Death Star, besides sensing the presence of his son Luke on more than one occasion.
**'''Focused Rage:''' Vader can channel his anger to amplify his strength, durability, endurance, speed, ferocity, aggression and the potency of his combat prowess/attacks.
**'''Force Jump:''' Vader can jump or leap great distances, although he rarely uses this power due to the limits of his suit and heavy cybernetics.
**'''Force Dash:''' Vader can move at amazing speeds.
**'''Fold Space:''' Vader can transport anything across space. He is only able to perform such a feat with the help of a cosmic gateway made within his castle.
**'''Teleportation: ''' Vader can open a wormhole, but it is immensely difficult and painful to do so. Such portal is generated by his own castle, which is designed to harness the power of the dark side on [[Mustafar]].
*'''Advanced Strength:''' Vader's Force powers amplify his physical strength, making him physically stronger than most sentient beings. His cybernetic enhancements also allow him additional strength to overpower other individuals with far greater ease.
*'''Advanced Reflexes:''' Vader's reflexes are much faster than normal Force-users and other sentient beings. His reflexes are superior to most other members of the Jedi Order. This ability also makes him an amazing pilot. During the Fight on a barren moon, Vader was able to dodge several of Obi-Wan's lightsaber strikes.
**'''Cybernetic Enhancements:''' Vader utilizes his cybernetic enhancements in combat, giving him greater strength to easily subdue, restrain, and overpower his opponents. He can effortlessly lift humans off the ground with one hand while holding them by the neck, crush bones in his fist, or throw people across rooms. Despite his great strength, physically lighter opponents can still block him in a lightsaber duel, such as [[Kanan Jarrus]], [[Ezra Bridger]], [[Ahsoka Tano]], and even his son, Luke Skywalker. His cybernetic enhancements are enough to allow him to even stand against the might of a [[Wookiees|Wookiee]] and Trandoshan.

====Abilities====
*'''Master Lightsaber Duelist:''' Vader is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist, with his skills being rivaled by his son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. According to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Vader's lightsaber combat skills surpassed that of even [[Yoda]] and [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]]. However, after being burned alive on Mustafar and forced to become a cyborg, his armored suit seemed to affect his mobility. Despite this, Vader still became a master lightsaber duelist. He is specialized in using his lightsaber combat skills, weight, endurance, and sheer brute strength to overwhelm his opponents into confusion or exhaustion, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, [[Ahsoka Tano]], and Luke Skywalker. Vader also regained some of his old agility and his blade work became brutally effective. Vader's technique and fighting style is a combination of brute strength and lethal precision, as his armor hampered some of his movement and he needed to constantly protect the control panel on his chest from attack, where he would otherwise be vulnerable to it. When he dueled Reva Sevander, he effortlessly defeated her by parrying her blows with the Force, before deftly dodging her strikes and using half her sword to briefly duel her before taking her half of the lightsaber and stabbing her in the stomach, defeating her. The full extent of his prodigious lightsaber combat skills is demonstrated during his duel with Ahsoka. However, as seen in "[[A World Between Worlds]]", if a future version of Ezra had not rescued Ahsoka from Vader, he would have struck her down. His lightsaber combat skills are such that he is extremely confident in his abilities. During the events portrayed in the issues of the Marvel Comics story ''Vader Down'', Vader was able to single-handedly take on a platoon of three squadrons of X-wing fighters, several Y-wing fighters, and hundreds of Rebel soldiers that surrounded him on the planet of Vrogas Vas, saying that despite their greater numbers, all he was surrounded by was fear and dead men before slaughtering them all with terrifying ease. In a lightsaber duel during the same battle, he also is able to kill Karbin, the Mon Calamari cyborg commander for the Empire and Vader's intended replacement, albeit with some assistance from Dr. Aphra.
**'''Form I:''' Vader is highly skilled in Shii-Cho. After becoming a cyborg, Vader's skills in Shii-Cho greatly improved to the point of mastery.
**'''Form II:''' After becoming a cyborg, Vader studied Makashi and became a master of the style.
**'''Form III:''' After becoming a cyborg, Vader studied Soresu and became a master of the style. Vader became so skilled at it that he was able to overcome and best Obi-Wan Kenobi in their final confrontation, despite Obi-Wan being a master of the style in his own right.
**'''Form IV:''' Vader is highly skilled in Ataru, at some point during the Clone Wars, he made some adjustments to Ataru to make it far more effective in defending against incoming projectiles or range attackers. After becoming a cyborg, Vader's skills in Ataru greatly improved to the point of mastery. He trained even to best Yoda, the leader of the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], in the case they ever faced each other directly in a duel.
**'''Form V:''' Vader is a master of Shien/Djem So, considered by many to be the most proficient practitioner of the style. After becoming a cyborg, he created a personal variant that included elements of all seven forms of lightsaber combat.
**'''Form VI:''' Vader is highly skilled in Niman. After becoming a cyborg, Vader's skills in Niman greatly improved to the point of mastery.
**'''Form VII:''' After becoming a cyborg, Vader studied Juyo/Vaapad and became a master of the style.
**'''Jar'Kai:''' Vader is highly skilled in Jar'Kai. After becoming a cyborg, Vader's skills in Jar'Kai greatly improved to the point of mastery.
**'''Sai cha:''' Vader is highly skilled in Sai cha.
**'''Cho mai:''' Vader is highly skilled in Cho mai.
**'''Cho sun:''' Vader is highly skilled in Cho sun.
**'''Shiak:''' Vader is highly skilled in Shiak.
**'''Mounted lightsaber combat:''' Vader is highly skilled in Mounted lightsaber combat.
*'''Master Pilot:''' Even before Vader's fall to the dark side, he was praised as the most skilled star-pilot in the history of the galaxy, a reputation he lived up to when he single-handedly almost destroyed Phoenix Squadron in his TIE Advanced, easily out-flying their entire fleet and forcing their command to abandon ship. Vader's piloting skills were rivaled only by his son, Luke Skywalker.
*'''Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' Vader is an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant, although he normally uses his brute strength against others, allowing him to defeat others with less of a need for skill.
*'''Expert Marksman:''' Although rarely seen, Vader is highly skilled in the use of blaster pistols.
*'''Master Engineer:''' Even before Vader's fall to the dark side, he is amazingly skilled in engineering, he can personally repair starships to maintain his skill. Repairing such machinery and vehicles also act as a form of meditation for Vader, allowing him to focus and clear his mind.
*'''Genius-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Leader:''' Even before Vader's fall to the dark side, he was amazingly intelligent and wise. As the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Military and a member of the Imperial High Command, Vader is a highly skilled tactician and a very capable leader. Due to his experience from the Clone Wars, he has an excellent reputation of never being defeated, he can also use his opponents own tactics against them. Furthermore, Vader often uses his environment to his advantage, using the terrain against his opponents by using whatever is at his disposal, such as throwing shrapnel and wreckage at his foes. In ''Vader Down'', he used shrapnel and wreckage from his own TIE Advanced to decimate his enemies on Vrogas Vas in conjunction with his Force skills and his lightsaber.
*'''Intimidation:''' As an immensely powerful Force-user, Vader commends an intimidating presence to the point where many of his allies and enemies alike across the galaxy fear him, even exceptionally powerful Force-users, turning Vader in one of the most, if not the most feared Sith in the entire galaxy.
*'''Multilingual:''' Mostly due to Vader's interactions as Anakin Skywalker, he is capable of fluently speaking Basic, Huttese, Bith, and Sith tongue.

===Weapons and Equipment===
====Lightsabers====
Vader's valued weapon and possession is his blue, later red-bladed lightsabers. He has only had two lightsabers.
*'''[[Lightsaber|Jedi Lightsaber]]:''' Though technically the second lightsaber Vader owned after the first was destroyed, he built this blue-bladed lightsaber and used it throughout the Clone Wars. He used this weapon through ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'', even after falling to the dark side and becoming a Sith Lord. He lost this weapon to Obi-Wan when he was heavily mutilated on [[Mustafar]], leading to the latter keeping it for nineteen years after. [[Luke Skywalker]] was given this weapon after meeting Obi-Wan and used it while part of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. Luke had no proper training and was forced to improvise his attacks with it. He lost it when his father cut his hand during their duel, causing the lightsaber to fall down Cloud City's airshafts. It then resurfaced and ended up in the hands of [[Maz Kanata]]. Maz offered the lightsaber to [[Rey]] when it called to her, but after Rey refused it, she gives it to [[Finn]]. On Starkiller Base, Finn, and then Rey, both fought [[Kylo Ren]] with it. It was later presented to Luke by Rey as a sign he was needed once again, only for Luke to reject it. Afterwards, Rey used it as her own. On the ''[[Supremacy]]'', it was used by Kylo to kill [[Supreme Leader Snoke|his own master]] before he returned it to Rey, so she could fight the [[Praetorian Guard]]s. It was ultimately destroyed in a struggle between Rey and Kylo over ownership of the lightsaber, but it later repaired by Rey through the use of Force healing. She continued to use the lightsaber as her own, and almost burned it after discovering to be Palpatine's granddaughter, only to be stopped by Luke's Force spirit, who catches it. Rey uses the lightsaber, along with Leia's lightsaber to finally kill the resurrected Palpatine by deflecting his Force lightning back at him. After Palpatine's death, Rey buried both lightsabers at the Lars homestead on Tatooine, having built her own lightsaber.
*'''[[Lightsaber|Sith Lightsaber]]:''' Vader had built a red-bladed lightsaber, a short time after he became a cyborg. As was common to all Sith lightsabers, it was a red-bladed lightsaber. As was traditional with all Sith, Darth Vader's lightsaber crystal was made using the corrupted [[kyber crystal]] taken from a Jedi's lightsaber, and turned red through infection with the dark side of the Force. The kyber crystal he claimed once belonged to Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a, whom Vader killed in single combat shortly after becoming a Sith. Vader would also originally use Infil'a's hilt for his lightsaber, but when it was destroyed in a fight with bounty hunters, Vader rebuilt his weapon into the hilt that was a twisted version of his very first lightsaber from when he had been a Jedi Padawan. It would remain in his possession until his final duel against his son, [[Luke Skywalker]] and was presumably destroyed when the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]] was destroyed. However, the post-empire dark side fanatical group known as the Acolytes of the Beyond purchased what they believed to be Vader's lightsaber from a dealer on the planet Taris named Ooblamon, hoping to reunite the weapon with its master in death by destroying it. It remains unknown if the artifact in question actually was Vader's lightsaber or not, as not even the seller was certain of its authenticity. What became of this supposed "lightsaber" is also unknown.

====Armor====
*'''Sith Armor:''' Vader's most important piece of equipment in his arsenal alongside his lightsaber was his armor. The characteristic armor also functions as Vader's life support suit, as without it, Vader can not move or even breathe. Vader also, on Palpatine's suggestion, customized his armor to suit his life as a Sith and to suit his needs, combat style, and personal preferences. Though he initially hated the armor for its encumbering nature, Vader grew to embrace how it isolated him from everyone and everything around him, allowing him to become a pure vessel of the dark side of Force. The armor contains a breathing apparatus within to pump purified air through Vader's damaged lungs, as well as a control panel on his chest to modulate the armor's functions that gave him proper amounts of nutrients and medicine to maintain his body. His armor allows him to walk without added protection on the icy planet of Hoth and survive in almost any environment or condition such as in the vacuum of space or on worlds with low amounts of oxygen. It even allows him to breathe underwater, though if Vader sinks too deep, he would be at risk from the crushing water pressure at greater depths. In addition to its function, Vader's armor, especially his helmet, gives him a frightening appearance. Vader's armor has ten protective layers, making him highly resistant to damage and his boots have magnetic clamps within to allow him to stick to metal surfaces. In addition to this, the four prosthetic limbs he has as a result of his injuries on Mustafar make him stronger and taller than many other beings. But for all these strengths, Vader's armor is not without weaknesses or setbacks. His armor slows down some of his movements and he is forced to readjust his fighting style accordingly, instead becoming more tactical, conservative, and precise without sacrificing strength. Lastly, the suit prevents him from being immune to or conjuring Force lightning, making him particularly vulnerable to that power, eventually resulting in his death at Palpatine's hands when he killed the Emperor to save his son, Luke. After his death, Luke ceremonially burned Vader's armor on the moon of Endor.
**'''Helmet:''' The helmet is undoubtedly the most important part of his armor, for the neural needles within allow him to use the armor and move, albeit painfully. Without those needles connecting to his skull and spine, Vader is utterly helpless and unable to survive outside of a bacta tank. After Luke ceremonially burned Vader's armor, the only thing to remain was the melted helmet. It was eventually found by none other than Vader's grandson, [[Kylo Ren]], who took the helmet and kept it on a table filled with the ashes of his slain enemies. Kylo would often try to speak to it as seen when he felt the pull of the light side of the Force, which made him want to receive his grandfather's guidance. Kylo also modeled his own helmet based on its design as part of his quest on the dark side to become as powerful as the late Sith Lord. Eventually, it was destroyed during a confrontation between Kylo and [[Rey]] through their Force-bond, in which they both accidentally hit the helmet with their lightsabers.

==Film Appearances==
===''Revenge of the Sith''===
Anakin discovered that [[Palpatine]] was indeed Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord who manipulated events regarding the Clone Wars to gain power, but was still led to believe the Jedi were traitors to the Republic. When Palpatine promised him a way to save his pregnant wife, Padmé, Anakin turned to the dark side to become Sidious' new apprentice and was rechristened as Darth Vader. After slaughtering all the [[Jedi]] in the [[Jedi Temple]], including the younglings, as part of the Great Jedi Purge, Vader was sent by Sidious to the [[Mustafar]] system, where he eliminated Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other Separatist leaders in equally quick order, saving Gunray for last due to the numerous attempts the Viceroy had made on Padmé's life. Despite Gunray's frantic pleas for mercy, Vader silences him once and for all so he can never threaten his wife again.

[[File:Anakin on Mustafar.png|thumb|250px|Darth Vader lamenting his recent acts of violence.]]
Outside, Vader cried tears of remorse for his malicious deeds, but he believed them to be for the greater good, and believed that there was no turning back from Lord Sidious' influence. Afterwards, the Sith apprentice reported his success to his master through a hologram and the latter congratulated him, requesting he then send an order to the Droid Army to shut down with the Clone Wars over. Soon after, he spotted a ship, and Vader is confronted by Padmé, who knows of his actions and implored him to leave the dark side and raise their child safely back home on Naboo. However, he showed he was too corrupted from his powers and sought to claim the power of the new Emperor. Padmé pleaded to him, but Vader spotted his former master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who snuck aboard her ship. When he believes Padmé has brought Obi-Wan to kill him, he Force chokes the begging Padmé and engages Obi-Wan in a ferocious lightsaber duel after he refused to side with him. The duel sees the destruction of the Separatist holdout they are in. Despite his vigorous efforts, Vader ultimately loses the fight, as well as his legs and left arm, and Obi-Wan remorsefully leaves him to burn to death beside a volcanic river.

[[File:Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Vader beside his master.]]
Though horribly burned and disfigured by the flames of Mustafar, Vader manages to keep himself alive with the Force, through his unbreakable will, and sheer hatred. Sidious, now Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire]], finds him and takes him back to [[Coruscant]] to be reconstructed with his iconic suit. When he is told that he had "killed" Padmé in his anger, Vader becomes consumed by his despair and fully embraces his dark persona. In the film's epilogue, Vader is seen beside Sidious viewing the construction of the Death Star, setting up the events that follow to ''A New Hope''.

===''[[Rogue One]]''===
[[File:VADERRO.PNG|thumb|250px|Darth Vader in ''Rogue One''.]]
Around some point before the Battle of Yavin, Vader had established a personal abode, Fortress Vader, on [[Mustafar]], the very planet where he had been disfigured. Shortly after the an insurgency on the desert moon of [[Jedha]], Vader summoned Director [[Orson Krennic]] to discuss the workings of the Death Star and the possibility of a weakness within the weapon.  Vader was suspended in a bacta tank, mediatating, he was informed by his servant Vaneé that Krennic arrived. Upon greeting Krennic, Vader quickly began to chastise Krennic for his inability to keep the existence of the Death Star a secret and his arrogance and demands of an audience with the Emperor only served to make Vader more harsh as he coldly made clear that he saw Tarkin as being much more competent than Krennic by rejecting his attempts to blame Tarkin for the destruction of Jedha. As Vader ended the conversation with a strict warning for Krennic to ensure that Galen Erso had not compromised the weapon in any way, Krennic believed this meant Vader had allowed him to remain in command of the Death Star project, but such belief and his question if Vader would ask the Emperor to have an audience with Krennic finally removed any patience Vader had. Vader choked Krennic into submission and left him with a sardonic warning to temper his ambitions and not "choke" on them.

When the Rebellion successfully gained possession of the plans for the Empire's new weapon, Vader commanded the ''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer ''Devastator'' and easily crippled the already damaged Rebel flagship, the MC75 Star Cruiser ''Profoundity'', before proceeding to infiltrate the ship. He soon engaged and pursued the Rebels who attempted to make their escape with a copy of the schematics of the Death Star, Vader's immense skill and power easily slaughtering the all-but-helpless Rebel soldiers. However, one of his victims managed to escape aboard the ''Tantive IV'', which escaped into hyperspace and the Rebel gave the plans for the Death Star to Leia Organa, leading directly into the events of ''A New Hope''.

===''A New Hope''===
When plans for the Empire's new weapon, the [[Death Star]], were stolen by Rebel spies, Darth Vader was assigned to retrieve the plans. His ''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer ''Devastator'' and men captured the CR90 corvette ''Tantive IV'', where they captured [[Leia Organa|Princess Leia Organa]]. Leia tries to talk her way out of the situation by threatening to have this reported back to the Imperial Senate on [[Coruscant]], but Vader knows that Rebel spies transmitted the plans to her and demands to know where they are. Leia again tries to deny Vader's accusations and explain that she's an Imperial Senator on her way to Alderaan, but Vader condemns her as a member of the [[Rebel Alliance]] and a traitor before ordering his 501st Legion stormtroopers to take her away. When they could not find the plans aboard the ship, and an Imperial officer tells Vader that an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were detected aboard it when spotted by the gunnery crews on the ''Devastator'', Vader assumed they were hidden in the escape pod that [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] were in and sent a squadron of troopers down to retrieve them while he returned to the Death Star. The troopers found the crashed escape pod, evidence of R2 and 3PO being there, and soon it led them to set up base in Mos Eisley in case the droids showed up there looking for transport off-planet.

[[File:VaderVSOb-Wan.jpg|thumb|250px|Vader duels Obi-Wan on the Death Star.]]
Vader tortured Leia with an IT-O Interrogation Unit to make her tell where the Rebel's secret base was while she was incarcerated in the Death Star's detention block, but she would not give in. Vader instead brings her to the bridge of the Death Star to meet with Death Star commanding officer and Governor of the Outer Rim Territories, Grand Moff [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], where Leia is threatened with having Alderaan destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser if she doesn't give up the location of the Rebel base. Despite Leia confessing to the base being on Dantooine, Vader holds her back as she helplessly watches as Alderaan is destroyed anyway on Tarkin's order. When the Empire captured the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', a freighter that had recently blasted its way out of the Mos Eisley Spaceport on [[Tatooine]] and arrived in the Alderaan system, Vader ordered a scanning crew to check every inch of the ship. Meanwhile, through the Force, he began to feel the presence of his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi aboard the station. After many years, he came face to face with Obi-Wan once again and engaged him in a second lightsaber duel, though this time he was determined to win. While he sensed Obi-Wan was growing weaker, he had also learned from his mistakes on Mustafar. Vader said so, but Kenobi warned that he would become more powerful than ever before if Vader killed him. The duel carried them across the hangar where they could see Luke and friends boarding the ''Millennium Falcon'', while the stormtroopers that had been guarding it had moved to assist Vader if he required it. The battle ended when Obi-Wan deliberately dropped his defenses, allowing Vader to strike, ultimately leading to the Jedi Master's tragic fate, though when Vader checks Obi-Wan's robes, he finds no evidence of him having left a body behind. Vader was then prevented from pursuing Leia and the others as the blast doors to the hangar were sealed by the destruction of the control panel by [[Luke Skywalker]].

When the Rebels commenced their attack on the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin, Vader joined the fight with two [[TIE Pilots|TIE pilots]] beside him as his wingmen. He easily took out many of the fighters by himself, including the initial [[Y-Wing|Y-wing]] squadron making the first trench run and the [[X-Wing|X-wing]] squadron that attempted the second run under the command of Red Leader Garven Dreis, and just when he was about to destroy Luke Skywalker, who was making the final run, Han Solo and [[Chewbacca]] appeared out of nowhere in the ''Falcon'' and fired on the Imperials, destroying one of Vader's wingmen while sending Vader spiraling away when the other wingman clips his [[TIE Advanced x1|TIE Advanced]] and sends it tumbling away from the Death Star. When the Rebels succeeded in destroying the Death Star, Vader managed to gain control of his TIE Advanced and fled the scene.

===''The Empire Strikes Back''===
{{Quote|Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.<br>He told me enough. He told me you killed him.<br>No. I am your father.|Darth Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father.}}
Three years later, Darth Vader tracked the location of the Rebels' new secret base on the ice planet, Hoth. From space, aboard his ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought ''Executor'', flagship of the Imperial Navy, he oversaw the Battle of Hoth, dispatching Imperial AT-ATs and AT-STs against Luke Skywalker and the other members of Rogue Squadron as the Rebellion attempted a desperate evacuation of Echo Base before it was overrun. Vader finally arrived on the planet with his elite 501st Legion after Imperial Army General Maximillion Veers destroyed the Rebel shield generator with his AT-AT, only to learn that Luke had already escaped, arriving in the abandoned hangar just as the ''Millennium Falcon'' made its escape. Vader has the ''Executor'' and the fleet pursue the ''Falcon'' into the nearby asteroid belt, unconcerned about the damage the fleet was taking from the asteroids as they hunted the ''Falcon'' down. However, Vader was soon informed that he was being summoned by the Emperor via hologram, and after having the ''Executor'' leave the asteroid belt to avoid interference in the transmission, he spoke to the Emperor in his personal quarters, where the Emperor confirmed that Luke is the offspring of [[Anakin Skywalker]], and thus planned to seduce him to the dark side of the Force as well, or perish if he refused.

[[File:Luke vs Vader.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vader in a lightsaber duel against his son Luke.]]
At Cloud City, on the planet Bespin, Vader arranged a trap for Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca, aided by bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] as well as Han's friend [[Lando Calrissian]], baron-administrator for Cloud City. Vader then began to arrange for Luke to be frozen in a carbonite chamber and delivered to the Emperor, but chose to test it first on Han. Afterwards, he handed him over to Fett, who flew the frozen mercenary to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine aboard his ship, ''Slave I'', to collect the bounty that Jabba had placed on Han's head for failing to repay his debt to the crime lord. Upon failing to freeze Luke, Vader then engaged Luke in a lightsaber duel, which ended on a catwalk above a giant ventilation pit. Initially, Vader had held back, but after Luke wounds him on the right shoulder, now he decided to end the battle on his own terms. After another flurry of swordplay, Vader severed the young Jedi's right hand and revealed to Luke that he is his father. He made a proposal for Luke to join him, where he would complete his son's training, and have him rule the galaxy alongside him, but Luke refused and narrowly escaped Cloud City.

Vader returned to the ''Executor'' just in time to learn that Imperial Admiral Firmus Piett's spies had deactivated the hyperdrive on the ''Millennium Falcon'', so it was only a matter of time before the Rebel ship would be caught in the tractor beam of the flagship and brought aboard. During that time, Vader made psychic connection with Luke through the Force, asking him to come with him. However, R2-D2 is able to reactivate the hyperdrive, and the ''Falcon'' escapes into hyperspace to rejoin the Alliance Navy, leaving Vader to return to his personal quarters on the ''Executor'' without punishing Piett for failing to capture the ''Falcon''.

===''Return of the Jedi''===
Around a year after the events of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Darth Vader was first seen arriving on the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]] to "check on" everyone's progress. The commanding officer of the second Death Star, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, tried to reason with him that he needed more manpower to finish construction of the battle station, but when Vader warns him that the Emperor himself is coming to oversee the rest of the construction personally, Jerjerrod promises to double their efforts to finish on time, satisfying Vader, only to warn Jerjerrod again that the Emperor was not as forgiving as he was. When the Emperor arrived, Vader assured him that the Death Star would be finished in time. Once the Emperor settled into his throne room on the second Death Star, his orders to Vader are to deploy the main Imperial Navy fleet on the far side of Endor until called for. With that, he then dismisses Vader to the ''Executor'' to await further orders there. However, while on the ''Executor'', Vader learns from Admiral Piett that a ''Lambda''-class Imperial shuttle named ''Tydirium'' is requesting deactivation of the security shield for the second Death Star to land on the forest moon below. Suspicious, Vader asks where it is going and if they have a code clearance. When the reply comes back that the shuttle is carrying parts and technical crew for the forest moon and the code is an older Imperial code but is still valid, Vader hesitates as he discovers Luke is aboard the ''Tydirium'' through the Force. After a moment, he gives Piett the go ahead to let the shuttle through.

Returning to the second Death Star and the Emperor's throne room, Vader explains the situation regarding the ''Tydirium'' to the Emperor and his confirmation that Luke is with the Rebel strike team that was on the shuttle. Wanting to seize the moment, the Emperor orders Vader to head for the forest moon, foreseeing Luke willingly surrender to the Empire's forces in order to speak to Vader face-to-face.

The Emperor is proven right as Luke surrenders to an AT-AT walker patrol and brought to the landing pad where Vader's shuttle touches down, where the AT-AT crew hands him over to Vader. Once alone, Luke and Vader speak to each other, but despite Luke's best attempts to convince Vader to return to the light side of the Force, Vader tells him that Anakin Skywalker is dead and he will always be Darth Vader and loyal to the Emperor.

[[File:DarthVaderLuke.png|thumb|250px|Vader brings his son to the Emperor.]]
Together, Vader and Luke met the Emperor in his throne room aboard the second Death Star, where the Emperor started playing upon Luke's fear for his friends' safety by revealing that Luke's friends on the forest moon of Endor and the Alliance Navy were walking into his trap. Intent on using Luke as a pawn to kill his own father, and thus take his place at the Emperor's side, he provokes Luke into engaging Vader in a fierce lightsaber duel, as when Luke summons his lightsaber to strike down the Emperor, Vader blocks with his own as the Emperor cackles wickedly. Vader assaulted Luke with Djem So, but Luke countered. Their duel continued until Luke hid in the darkness under the platform where the Emperor's throne stood, refusing to battle his father any further. When Vader probed his son's mind with the Force, he found out that Leia was his daughter too. Happy with this new information, he proclaims that if Luke will not turn to the dark side, perhaps Leia will. This threat angers Luke enough for him to viciously attack Vader and brutally overpower him. But after cutting off his father's right hand and noticing mechanical wires underneath that match his own right hand, Luke, realizing he's about to follow the same path as his father down the dark side, threw aside his lightsaber and told the Emperor that he would never turn to the dark side, remaining loyal to resurrecting the Jedi Order.

Vader then watched as the Emperor viciously tortured Luke with fierce Force Lightning attacks in retaliation for his refusal to join the Sith. Writhing in agony, Luke pleaded for his father to save him. At that point, Anakin Skywalker resurfaces, killing the Darth Vader persona once and for all, along with the Sith Order as Anakin slays the Emperor and fulfills the Chosen One prophecy while also setting into motion the destruction of the Galactic Empire as well.

===''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''===
[[File:The-Force-Awakens-13.png|thumb|left|250px|This is all that is left of Darth Vader in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]].]]
Although Vader has been long dead for approximately thirty years, his burnt and distorted helmet is in the possession of his grandson, Ben Solo, who has turned to the dark side like him and assumed the identity of [[Kylo Ren]], wanting to "finish what he started". To this end, Kylo Ren kept the helmet in his personal quarters and would place Vader's helmet on a table filled with the ashes of his slain enemies, speaking to it when he felt the pull of the light side.

As [[Han Solo]] and [[Leia Organa]] discuss about their son's turn to the dark side, they mention how he is too much like his grandfather, and Leia admits feeling guilty that she sent Ben to train with [[Luke Skywalker]] for fearing that he would become like Vader. Later, after Kylo abducted [[Rey]], he tries to use the Force to probe her mind, but Rey turns his own power against him and senses that Kylo is afraid that he will never be as powerful as Vader.

===''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]''===
Vader is mentioned a few of times throughout the film. [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] tells Kylo how he thought him as the successor of Vader, but then reprimands his apprentice for his failures and weakness, stating he is just a child in a mask pretending to be like his grandfather. Later, while discussing about the failure of the Jedi, Luke mentions how it was a Jedi (Obi-Wan) that trained Vader and subsequently caused his fall to the dark side, but Rey argues that it was also a Jedi (Luke) who saw the good in him and caused him to turn back to the light side.

When Rey is brought before Snoke on the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]'', Snoke believes Kylo will fulfill his destiny in the dark side as the heir of Darth Vader while ordering his apprentice to kill Rey. Ironically, Kylo ends up betraying and killing his own master to save Rey, similar as Vader killed Emperor Palpatine to save Luke. Right after this, Ren asks Rey to join him to rule the galaxy by his side, during a scene in which the two resemble Anakin and [[Padmé Amidala]] when the fallen Jedi asked his wife the same shortly after his turn to the dark side in ''Revenge of the Sith'', and years later Vader asks the same to Luke in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.

===''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''===
Even after being killed by Anakin thirty years before, Emperor Palpatine returns by resurrecting himself inside a cloned body. Palpatine reveals to Kylo Ren that he manipulated the young Ben Solo into turning to the dark side by creating Snoke and by whispering voices in his mind, including by impersonating Vader's voice to speak to Kylo.

Later, when Rey is searching for Ochi's blade after infiltrating the ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer ''Steadfast'' on Kijimi, she sees Darth Vader's helmet inside Kylo Ren's quarters. Rey and Kylo's Force-bond connects them while she is still in the room and Kylo is at Kijimi's streets looking for her. They start to fight through their bond, and their lightsabers accidentally hit and destroy Vader's helmet. Part of the destroyed helmet is transferred through their bond and falls on the ground near Kylo's feet, which leads him to conclude that Rey is inside his quarters.

During the Battle of [[Exegol]], Palpatine mentions that his first defeat only happened because of Vader's blood relation with his son while trying to convince Rey, his granddaughter, that no one would come for her since the Dark Lord is the only one of her family still alive. Contradicting Palpatine's prediction, Ben Solo, who is her other half due to a Force dyad connection, does come to save her. To avenge his previous death at the hands of Vader, the Sith Lord throws Ben in a pit saying that the last Skywalker will fall as he once did.

==Television Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''===
[[File:VaderCloneWarsS7.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Darth Vader some time after the end of the Clone Wars.]]
Darth Vader briefly appears in a vision of Anakin while stuck on Mortis, seeing in horror what he would become but his memory is erased after leaving Mortis. 

Darth Vader also makes an appearance in the final episode, where he arrives on a moon Ahsoka fled to, to escape Order 66 and recovered Ahsoka's lightsaber from the wrecked ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer ''Tribunal''. He then lights the lightsaber still functional despite the passage of time and then looks at a strange bird in the sky. Believing his former apprentice died in the crash, Darth Vader leaves the moon. 

===''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'' ===
{{Quote|I am not your failure, Obi-Wan. You didn't kill Anakin Skywalker. I did. The same way, I will destroy you!|Darth Vader rejecting who he once was as he faces his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi.}}
Darth Vader briefly appears at the end of the second episode. After being informed by Reva that Vader is still alive, Obi-Wan senses as Vader awakens inside his bacta tank.
[[File:Mapuzo Clash.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Darth Vader confronting Obi-Wan on Mapuzo, taunting him for not killing him when he could on Mustafar.]]
In the third episode, Darth Vader travels to Mapuzo in person after Obi-Wan is detected there by a probe droid. After slaughtering some civilians, he finally confronts his former master trying to flee from him. Obi-Wan is horrified by what has become of his former student, only for Darth Vader to retort that he did this to him. Breaking up another escape attempt, the Sith Lord engages in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan, but he does not fight seriously upon noticing that the former Jedi master is terribly rusty. He doesn't take long to knock Obi-Wan down and then taunts him for not killing him so many years ago. Subduing his opponent with the Force, Darth Vader ignites pieces of metal scattered on the floor, causing a huge fire from which he hurls Obi-Wan, reminiscent of when Anakin burned on Mustafar. Before Stormtroopers grab a defeated and burned Obi-Wan, Tala Durith starts another fire, stopping Darth Vader from approaching while she evacuates Obi-Wan.

In the fourth episode, Darth Vader angrily arrives at the [[Inquisitorius]] base and violently subdues the [[Reva Sevander|Third Sister]] for being unable to prevent Obi-Wan's escape. He calms down when the Inquisitor reveals that she has placed a tracker that will not only lead them to the fleeing Jedi but also to the underground network that helps the Jedi hide. Darth Vader gives her one last chance, warning her that he will tolerate no more failures.
[[File:Vader Foil.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Darth Vader foils the Third Sister's attempt to assassinate him.]]
In the fifth episode, Darth Vader arrives in Jabiim where Obi-Wan was located. He commends the Third Sister for bringing him to his old enemy by giving her the title of Grand Inquisitor. Throughout the takeover of the Path outpost, Darth Vader recalls a memory of when he was still Obi-Wan's padawan and nearly beat him in practice only to be disarmed and reprimanded over his desire to prove his worth which Obi-Wan believes will prevent him from progressing. After being told by Third Sister that Obi-Wan was locked inside the outpost, the Sith Lord travels there himself and halts an attempted escape by cargo ship, only to find out that it was a decoy, allowing the escape of all fugitives. Despite his frustration, Darth Vader is able to foil an assassination attempt by Third Sister, the latter resenting him to death for killing all of her younglings friends and for being left for dead by him on the evening of Order 66 in the Jedi Temple. She turns out to be no match for Darth Vader who uses the Force to bar her blows before disarming her of her lightsaber and splitting it in half to engage her in a lightsaber duel. Disarming her again and then stabbing her in the stomach, Darth Vader reveals knowing what she was plotting against him and that he had recognized her as the youngling he believed to have killed ten years ago. After saying that she is no longer of any use to him and that [[The Grand Inquisitor]] has taunted the traitor, the Sith Lord leaves the planet, leaving the injured young woman to her fate.
[[File:Vader Broken.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Darth Vader, his helmet split by Obi-Wan, disassociating himself from Anakin Skywalker.]]
In the sixth episode, Vader's star destroyer tracks down the runaways but just as Obi-Wan escapes by shuttle, Darth Vader gives the order to hunt down the Jedi despite the Grand Inquisitor's objections. Once his former master lands on a rocky planet, Darth Vader takes his personal ship to go deal with it alone. As soon as he arrives, he immediately confronted to Obi-Wan. The two adversaries clash fiercely, the Sith Lord using only one hand at first until an invigorated Obi-Wan manages to push him on the defensive. Darth Vader compliments Obi-Wan for getting his power back but taunts him for still having the same weakness before burying him under several rocks taunting him for believing he could beat him. Returning towards his ship, Darth Vader is suddenly attacked by a still-living Obi-Wan and is quickly challenged by his former master's more experienced Force Mastery. Despite his determination, Vader was forced onto the defensive again, and suffered multiple lightsaber slashes and pommel strikes to his control panel, weakening him enough for Obi-Wan to cut off the left half of his helmet. Triumphant and horrified at the sight of Anakin's charred face, Obi-Wan deeply apologizes for everything but Darth Vader, completely immersed in the Dark side, sourly replies that he is not Obi-Wan's failure and that he is the one who destroyed Anakin Skywalker. Accepting that his former friend is truly dead, Obi-Wan leaves, leaving Darth Vader too hurt to follow him, furiously screaming Kenobi's name.

Sometime later on Mustafar, Darth Vader communicates with Sidious about the continued hunt for Obi-Wan, just so his master won't reprimand him for allowing himself to be weakened in the past and that he has to cut himself off once and for all. He then replies that Kenobi means nothing more before cutting off communication, though it seems the Sith Lord was insincere.

===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===
Darth Vader appears in the [[Disney XD]] animated series ''Star Wars Rebels'', once again voiced by [[James Earl Jones]] who originally provided his voice in the Original Trilogy and ''Revenge of the Sith''. In the series, he tasks the Empire's Inquisitors to hunt down the remaining Jedi Knights who may have survived the Great Jedi Purge.

====Season One====
In the extended cut of "[[Spark of Rebellion]]", Darth Vader makes a brief appearance during the opening of the film where he is briefing his deadly servant, The Grand Inquisitor, with new orders from the Emperor.

Even though the Jedi have been wiped out, the Sith have foreseen a new threat: the Children of the Force. Under the command of his master, the Emperor, Vader gave the Inquisitor the task to hunt down this new enemy and if they do not serve the Empire they should be eliminated along with any surviving Jedi who will attempt to train them. At the end of the season finale; "[[Fire Across the Galaxy]]", Vader meets with [[Agent Kallus]] to deal with the Ghost cell personally.

====Season Two====
Following the rescue of [[Kanan Jarrus]] over [[Mustafar]] and the death of [[The Grand Inquisitor]], rumors of what had happened became known, riots and uprisings begun to occur on several worlds. Concerned at the rise in Rebel activity, the Emperor sent Vader to [[Lothal]] with [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Grand Moff Tarkin]] to end the growing rebellion.

[[file:Star-Wars-Rebels-Season-Two-48.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vader duels against Kanan Jarrus.]]
Following his arrival, Vader met with [[Agent Kallus]] and [[Maketh Tua|Minister Tua]] to discuss his plans on dealing with the Rebels. Vader then had Kallus escort the Minister to her shuttle, where she was killed and the incident was blamed on the Rebels. When the Rebels tried to steal a shuttle to make their escape, Vader and his stormtroopers surrounded them. Vader engaged the leader of the Rebels, [[Kanan Jarrus]], and his apprentice, [[Ezra Bridger]], in a lightsaber duel. He was easily able to overpower them and attempted to kill Ezra with his own lightsaber until Kanan intervened. [[Garazeb Orrelios|Zeb]] and [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]] used thermal detonators to cause an [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]] to fall on him, but he survived and used the Force to lift the burning walker off him. The Rebels fled the scene in a stolen shuttle and instead of pursing them, he lets them go, knowing they will not leave the planet just yet. Vader also orders Tarkintown burned to turn opinion against them.

Vader then allowed the Rebels to escape through the blockade, letting them lead him to his true target; the Rebel fleet. Vader took his [[TIE Advanced x1|TIE Advanced]] to attack the Rebel fleet, destroying most of the fighters and severely damaging the command ship. During the fight, Vader sensed that his former apprentice, [[Ahsoka Tano]], was alive and part of the Rebel fleet. When two Star Destroyers arrived, Vader tried to stop the Rebels from escaping, but lost them when they jumped into hyperspace and he got caught in the tractor beam.

Following his victory, Vader contacted Palpatine and informed him that Skywalker's apprentice was still alive and in league with the Rebels. Both Vader and the Emperor were pleased by this, knowing she could lead them to other Jedi survivors, even [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whom Vader was still obsessed with seeking revenge upon for his defeat on Mustafar. Palpatine urged Vader to be patient when searching for his former master and then ordered him to send another Inquisitor to hunt the Rebels down. Vader later dispatched two new Inquisitors, [[Fifth Brother]] and [[Seventh Sister]], to finish what he and the Grand Inquisitor had started.

[[File:Twilight of the Apprentice 11.jpg|thumb|250px|Vader's mask shattered by Ahsoka.]]
Following the discovery of the Jedi Temple on Lothal, Vader later arrived at the [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith Temple]] discovered on [[Malachor]] after the death of the Inquisitors. Encountering Ezra, he questioned the boy as to how he opened the path to the Malachor Sith Temple; Ezra told him to find out himself and engaged Vader in battle, but the Sith Lord was too strong and easily destroyed Ezra's lightsaber. But before he could finish the boy off, [[Ahsoka Tano|Ahsoka]] arrived and engaged Vader. He eventually managed to knock Ahsoka out of the Temple and attempted to stop Ezra and a blinded Kanan from escaping. A recovered Ahsoka charged up behind Vader and slashed part of his mask off, knocking him down to the floor and exposing a considerable amount of his disfigured face, including his yellow right eye. Seeing that he really was her [[Anakin Skywalker|former master]], Ahsoka refused to leave him again. For a few moments, Ahsoka's compassion appeared to have reached Vader, but he then shrugged it off; coldly declaring that she would die, he then ignited his lightsaber and moved to attack her again. As the pair resumed their battle, the temple collapsed and exploded around them, with Kanan and Ezra barely managing to escape. Vader survived the temple's collapse, but was badly wounded and limped away from the ruins.

==== Season Four====
Vader makes a brief appearance in "[[A World Between Worlds]]", when he resumed his battle with Ahsoka from "Twilight of the Apprentice". It was revealed that Vader had the opportunity to strike Ahsoka down, but at that moment, a time-displaced Ezra pulls Ahsoka into a portal with a dumbfounded Vader left alone in the collapsing temple. Vader escaped the temple unaware that Ahsoka was able to return to the temple's ruin sometime after his departure.

==Printed Media==
Darth Vader appears in most of the new canonical novels and comics tied in with the films created after Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and Star Wars' expanded universe.

Amongst his more prominent appearances, the novel ''Lords of the Sith'' by Paul S. Kemp focuses on his and Palpatine's personal assault on the planet [[Ryloth]], in which they battle and destroy a resistance created by [[Cham Syndulla]], resulting in the enslavement of Ryloth and his and Palpatine's slaughter of an entire village of [[Twi'leks]].

Vader is briefly mentioned in the novel ''[[Ahsoka]]'', when the Grand Inquisitor is asked to hunt down an [[Ahsoka Tano|unknown Force-wielder]] that caused trouble on the moon of Raada one year after the formation of the Galactic Empire.

Darth Vader also stars in his own comic series, ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'', published by [[Marvel Comics]] (itself a Disney subsidiary since 2009). In these comics, he is shown hunting down Luke Skywalker and the other members of the Rebel Alliance as well as threats within the Empire itself. The series also discloses Vader's agenda and feats during his early years as a Sith Lord; among them, his training of the Inquisitorius is shown in depth, as is his hunt for any remaining Jedi, such as his killing of Jocasta Nu, Faren Barr, and Eeth Koth as well as his part in the subjugation of the watery world of Mon Cala. It is also revealed that he was given his late wife's Naboo starship for his own personal use, and that Palpatine granted Darth Vader the planet Mustafar as his own personal retreat, where he would build his castle overtop of a dark side cave. Later on in the series, during a confrontation in which he is defeated by a traitor to the Empire named Cylo IV, Vader also undergoes a mental battle between his good and evil halves (embodied by his Vader and Anakin personas, respectively) in which his evil half seemingly defeats his good half once and for all, suppressing it until the events of ''Return of the Jedi''.

==Trivia== 
*Darth Vader is one of the most iconic and popular of the Lucasfilm villains, with his popularity being comparable to that of other [[Disney Villains]].
*On the set of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Darth Vader's identity as [[Luke Skywalker]]'s father was shrouded in secrecy. Along with his fellow cast members, David Prowse—who physically portrayed Vader and spoke all his lines before being overdubbed by [[James Earl Jones]]—was given a script with fake dialogue, the relevant line being replaced by "[[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan]] killed your father."<ref name="EOD">{{cite web|author=Chris Chiarella|year=2004|title=Mark Hamill Interview|work=Home Theater|url=http://www.hometheatermag.com/news/100104hamill/|accessdate=February 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080611/http://www.hometheatermag.com/news/100104hamill/|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ross|first=Dalton|title=Secrets and Jedis|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,698013,00.html|accessdate=February 16, 2007|date=September 16, 2004}}</ref> Hamill was only informed just before the scene was filmed,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Dalton|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2004/09/16/10-things-we-learned-star-wars-dvds|title=10 things we learned from the "Star Wars" DVDs|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 16, 2004|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref> and did not even tell his wife.

*He is the first and only known character who was a Sith Lord and became a Force spirit, something the Sith are incapable of doing due to their obsession with the dark side of the Force. However, he is only able to become a spirit because he came back to the light side just before his death.
*Concept art in ''The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' book revealed that Darth Vader was originally going to appear in the 2015 film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' through [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s Force spirit. According to the concept artist Iain McCaig, his appearance would fluctuate between his Anakin and Vader personas, representing the character's duality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/File:TFA_Anakin-Vader_concept_art.jpg|title=The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens|date=[[December 18]], [[2015]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars 7: Anakin Skywalker Ghost Was Planned for The Force Awakens|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-7-anakin-skywalker-force-ghost-images-hayden-christensen/|date=[[December 24]], [[2015]]|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>
*Although he never managed to prevent [[Padmé Amidala|his wife]] to die in childbirth and later failed to bring her back from the dead, his grandson [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]], accomplishes to revive the woman he loves, [[Rey]], by using [[The Force#Force healing|Force healing]]. With this, Ben succeeded where his grandfather failed and fulfilled his word to finish something Vader started, even if it was in a way Ben didn't expect at first.
*In the extended version of ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]'', Darth Vader's character design is close to the original concept art by Ralph McQuarrie that was used during the early production.
* His voice actor, James Earl Jones, would later go on to voice [[Mufasa]] in ''[[The Lion King]]''. Ironically, the shoe would be on the other foot in these roles: Specifically, Vader later revealed to be Luke's father, had Luke's uncle [[Owen Lars]] murdered, while Mufasa, Simba's father, would end up murdered by Simba's [[Scar|uncle]]. When Mufasa is a ghost, his voice sounded very similar.
*Vader is briefly mentioned in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[All Ducks on Deck]]" when the [[Phantom Blot]] is comparing himself to other villains: "I make Darth Vader look as scary as the hood ornament of a '53 Buick!" At the time the episode aired, Disney had not acquired the rights to ''[[Star Wars]]'' yet.
*In ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', there is a spoof of Vader's famous line (No, ''I'' am your father) when [[Emperor Zurg]] reveals himself to [[Buzz Lightyear]]. The same film also briefly had Buzz Lightyear mimicking Darth Vader's breathing in the beginning. In addition, Zurg, when encountering Buzz Lightyear at the beginning of the same film, says "We meet again Buzz Lightyear, for the last time!", similar to Vader's opening when encountering Obi-Wan on the Death Star in ''A New Hope'' – "I've been waiting for you Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last."
**In the sequel ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', [[Big Baby]] throws [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]] into the dumpster, similar to Vader's redemption by defeating Emperor Palpatine.
**Vader's line to Leia when ordering for her arrest was also parodied with Bad Buzz in the same film. Coincidentally, both Bad Buzz and Darth Vader were seduced by the bad guy (Lotso and Palpatine, respectively), although in the former's case, it was closer to being brainwashed.
**In the ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' episode "[[Stranger Invasion]]", during their battle at the end of the episode, Zurg says Vader's "I am your father" line to Buzz to confuse him, right before punching his face and saying "Psych! Made ya look, you dimwit!"
*In ''[[Chicken Little]]'' during the scene where [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]], [[Abby Mallard|Abby]], [[Runt of the Litter|Runt]], and [[Fish Out of Water (Chicken Little)|Fish]] discover Kirby before multiple aliens attack Oakey Oaks, Runt explains "Darth Vader is Luke's father?", an allusion to the ''Star Wars'' franchise.
* In ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'', which was released in theaters only four days after [[Lucasfilm]] was bought by Disney, [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] mimics Vader's breathing when he breathes through a candy straw while hiding out in a chocolate pond.
*A scuba mask was used to make Darth Vader's famous breathing noise.
*Darth Vader was parodied in ''The Muppet Show'' twice, once in the episode Crystal Gayle appeared in and once in the episode where several Star Wars characters appeared. Both times he was "played" by [[Gonzo]] and his iconic mask had Gonzo's hook nose.
*The scene in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' where his helmet is lowered onto his burnt head was homage in an episode of ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'' when [[The Huntsman (American Dragon: Jake Long)|The Huntsman]]'s helmet is lowered onto his burnt head.
*In the ''[[Kim Possible]]'' movie, ''[[Kim Possible: A Stitch in Time|A Stitch in Time]]'' after running into a future version of [[Duff Killigan]], as a robot [[Ron Stoppable]] says he's more machine than Golfer now, which is a take on Obi-Wan saying that Vader was more machine now than man in ''Return of the Jedi''.
*In [[Flubber (film)|Flubber]], [[Weebo]] called [[Professor Brainard]] Darth Vader as joke while he was working on Flubber tags for the basketball game.
*In the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode "[[A Duck By Any Other Name]]", [[Tuskerninni]] dresses up like Darth Vader while robbing a bank.
*''Star Wars'' was parodied in the ''[[Big City Greens]]'' episode "[[Clubbed]]" as "Constellation Battles" with the villain's name being Garth Crater.
*In the Blossom pilot when Six is explaining menopause to Blossom she tells her "You'll grow a beard and sound like Darth Vader".
**In the episode "Dad's Girlfriend", Tony is dressed in a motorbike gear and says he felt like Darth Vader, he then mimics Darth and says "The Force is strong with this one" (referring to Blossom).
*In the [[Once Upon A Time]] episode when The Wicked Queen is trying to persuade Harry to join her dark mission, Harry tells her "You can't Darth Vader me!"
*In the climax of the ''[[Bonkers]]'' episode "[[Springtime for the Iguana]]", though in a brightly colored costume, [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]] spoke in a deep booming voice (like Darth Vader's) while wearing the costume.
* A character by the name of ''Duck Vader'' appears in a few issues of ''[[Donald Duck & Co.]]'', and wears the same suit but instead with a noticeable beak.
*In the ''[[Blossom]]'' season 3 episode "The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men", Joey Russo impersonated Darth Vader and quoted his famous line, "Luke, I am your father."
*In the ''[[Doug]]'' season 3 episode "[[Quailman Vs. the Triad of Terror]]" a parody of Darth Vader named "Darken Vader" appears.
*In the ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' season 2 episode "[[You Didn't Say it Was Your Birthday]]", [[Lilly Truscott]] and [[Oliver Oken]] find a potato chip that resembles Darth Vader and [[Rico Suave]] can be heard making breathing sounds like him in a scuba suit.
*In ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' season 1 episode "[[The Ghost of Suite 613]]", Arwin says the line: "The Force is strong with this one." while wearing a working mask.
*In the ''[[Amphibia]]'' season 3 episode "[[Escape to Amphibia]]", [[Anne Boonchuy]] waves a red toy lightsaber while battling against the FBI Agents, referencing the ending scene of ''[[Rogue One]]''. [[Mr. Boonchuy]] is also seen wearing a mask almost similar to Darth Vader and a statue of him is seen in Spendco, but it is wielding a blue lightsaber instead.
*Darth Vader defeated by Obi-Wan's superior experience in [[Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)|''Obi-Wan Kenobi'']] echoes his line in ''A New Hope'' (When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the Master) when they faced each other again for the last time and that this time Vader won.
*George Lucas originally almost had [[Orson Welles]] voice Darth Vader, but George feared his voice was too recognizable, so James Earl Jones was cast to voice Darth Vader. [https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/573866/orson-welles-almost-played-Darth-Vader-Star-Wars]
