==Role in the Series==
Clover and Sofia go to find him so they can get ice lilies for [[Cedric the Sorcerer|Cedric]]. He meets up with them and tells Clover he hasn't seen him since he decided to live in the castle. Sofia asks him if he knows where the ice lilies are and he whistles for a bird and it tells him. He says there's an icy lily patch in the Icicle Forest. He asks Clover if he's up to it and teases him a bit. He leads them to forest where they meet [[Winter (Sofia the First)|Winter]] and listen to her music. She tells them about her ice touch and how she got it from a witch. He asks if it was [[Glacia the Ice Witch]] and she says yes. They listen to her story and she needs ice lilies as her present to Glacia. Sofia asks her to come with them

Whisker leads them to an island where the ice lilies are across a lake. He again teases Clover if the water's too cold for him and to make things easier, Winter freeze's the lake and they skate across. They search for the ice lilies, but can't find them. Clover at first thinks his birdies were wrong, but he says they are never wrong. Winter plays a song to cheer them up and they dance until Sofia finds the ice lilies in a tree. Whiskers climb up to get them, but Clover wants to get them also. Clover gets some and throws them down. He climbs to the top to get more but falls down. Winter catches him but accidentlly freezes him. She says only Glacia can melt it and Whiskers volunteers to come along claiming he got Clover into trouble. They set off to Glacia's castle and he tells Clover to think warm thoughts. They make it to Glacia but she says they need a better gift as she already has ice lilies. Winter asks her to remove the curse, but she refuses.

When all hope seemed lost, Whiskers met [[Tiana]] who taught Sofia that what makes a gift special is it comes from the heart. This gave Sofia an idea and the friends returned to Glacia where Winter presented a musical gift for her which she liked and danced too

After Clover is thawed, Whiskers apologizes for teasing him and admitted that he missed Clover when he went to live in the castle. Clover admits that he has missed him as well but tells him they can still be friends no matter what. He calls a flying reindeer to give them a ride back to the castle and joins Clover to celebrate Wassailia.
