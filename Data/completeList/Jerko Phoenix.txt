'''Jerko Phoenix''' is [[Justin Russo]]'s rival at [[WizTech]]. He is a champion 12-Ball player at the school, but lost to Justin during the finals. He was first seen in "[[Wizard School]], Part 1," but is unknown if Jerko still is at WizTech as he didn't appear in the two-part episode "[[Saving WizTech]]" from season two. He wears an eye patch, so he doesn't wear have to wear the mandatory WizTech glasses. He is a parody of the ''Harry Potter'' character Draco Malfoy.
