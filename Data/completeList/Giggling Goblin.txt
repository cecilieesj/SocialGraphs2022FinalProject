'''The Giggling Goblin''' is a character from ''[[Sofia the First]]'' who was thought to be a myth by others, except by [[Calista]].

==Personality==
At first, the Goblin started acting mischievous when trapping [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]], [[Lucinda]], [[Indigo]], [[Lily (Sofia the First)|Lily]], and Calista with rocks, and taking their brooms, wands and candy. But after being tricked into thinking someone actually liked him, his feelings got hurt which led to him crying.

==Role in the Series==
The Giggling Goblin makes his debut appearance in "[[Too Cute to Spook]]". He first appears when Sofia, Lucinda, Calista, Lily, and Indigo get stranded in the Dreary Woods. The Goblin uses his Giggle Spells to steal the group's candy. The witches try to stop him but he takes their wands. Calista defeats him by giving him Lemon Sours. They then take him trick or treating where he helps them get more candy from Mr. P, who gives him his own. The group invites him to trick or treat the next year.
