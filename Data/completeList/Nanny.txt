{{Quote|A wonderful cook and housekeeper. She’s such a kind, understanding soul. You know, at times she seems almost canine.|Pongo describing Nanny}}
'''Nanny''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1961]] animated feature film, ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''. She is the housekeeper of the Radcliffe household.

==Appearances==
===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===
Nanny is hired by [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] and [[Anita Radcliffe]] as a cook and housekeeper, wonderful by Pongo's standards, although the Radcliffes seem to see her more as a member of the family than a servant. Within only a few months, she becomes very close to the family and is especially joyful when the [[Dalmatian Puppies|puppies]] finally arrive. When Cruella De Vil visits to offer a buying price for the newborn puppies, she joins Roger and Anita in standing up to her, subsequently refusing her offer. She even called Roger a blooming hero for his courage. Nanny's primarily responsible for watching the puppies when the Radcliffes are not around, such as while they're on walks with [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]. During this time, she grows quite attached to the puppies. One night, while Roger and Anita are out, [[Jasper and Horace]] show up to kidnap the puppies for Cruella, posing as electricians to gain entry. Nanny is not fooled by their ruse and declines to let them in with the masters of the house gone. She tries to keep the two crooks out of the house, but they're too quick for her and ram their way in. She puts up a tough fight, but Jasper holds her in the attic (while Nanny throws a teapot at Jasper) while Horace abducts the puppies. After the two thieves depart, she runs downstairs expecting to see the family valuables gone, but discovers the puppies have been stolen instead, to her horror. She runs out into the street, hysterically calling for help.

Apart from being seen in a newspaper photo, sitting solemnly by the vacant puppy basket, Nanny is not seen again until the end of the movie, just before the puppies return home at Christmas. She serves tea to Roger and Anita as she weeps over her remembrance of the puppies but hurries at once to open the door when she hears the familiar sound of barking. Even though the Dalmatians scatter ashes and soot all over the apartment and its inhabitants from their disguise to hide from Cruella and the Baduns, Nanny's never happier to be reunited with them and dusts them off so they can be recognized.

[[File:101-dalmatians-2-disneyscreencaps.com-357.jpg|thumb|left|229x229px|Nanny in 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]Nanny returns for the sequel still as the Radcliffe's housekeeper and cook. She is first heard calling the puppies to dinner. At dinner, she catches [[Rolly]] eating a bowl, yet hiding another bowl. She is then seen with Pongo and [[Patch]], giving Patch his collar, having their new address (as they are moving the next day).

Later on, Nanny along with the others arrive at the [[Cherry Tree Farm]] and begin to get used to it (though they don't know that Patch is missing). One day, as Nanny is doing the laundry, Roger finds out that Patch isn't with them, and they leave, leaving Nanny behind to take care of the puppies.

One night, she heard the song of the [[Kanine Krunchies]] startled, then finding out that Jasper and Horace once again have tried to steal the puppies, chasing the Badduns with her frying pan, though eventuality they but her in the well, terrified.

At the end of the film, after the police help her escape from the well, she tells the police that Jasper and Horace had put her in the well, though they then state that it was all Cruella.

Nanny appears as one of the main characters in ''101 Dalmatians: The Series''.

In "[[Home is Where the Bark Is]]", she gets mugged, and the muggers take her purse whilst walking the puppies, but Lucky retrieves it. This act is what convinces Roger that it's time to move out of the city and to the country.

She does numerous chores on the [[Dearly Farm|farm]], such as using a bicycle attached to the Chow Tower to pour out the pups' [[Kanine Krunchies|kibble]]. Other chores include gardening, painting, housework and getting rid of Cruella's surveillance cameras.

She also mentions her family sometimes. In "[[Southern Fried Cruella]]", it is said she has a sister named Franny, whom she later visits in "[[Leisure Lawsuit]]". Another family member she mentions is her brother, whom, she tells Horace, is a cop.

The series also establishes a relationship between her and Horace, first spawning when Horace tells Nanny that she has beautiful eyes in "Home is Where the Bark Is". In "[[Frisky Business]]", Horace tries to help her, but she turns him down. However, when they work together to get [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]], [[Rolly]], [[Cadpig]], [[Spot Chicken|Spot]], and [[Cruella's car]] returned, Nanny gives Horace a kiss on the cheek. Horace then makes her a Valentine cake in "[[Valentine Daze]]". Nanny slams the door in his face when he greets her, but once she learns what Horace intended to give her, the two have tea together.

Another person who falls in love with Nanny is the Baron in "[[Cupid Pups]]". He claims when he tasted his boiled radish in pickle sauce, he knew she was the one. He proposes to her, but she turns him down since someone's got to look after the Dearlys. The Baron takes it easy, figuring it's for the best, but requests some radishes to go. Nanny has also achieved the honor of "[[Humanitarian of the Year]]".

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''===
[[File:Image102.4.jpg|thumb|250px|Nanny in ''101 Dalmatians''.]]
In ''101 Dalmatians'', it is said that Nanny used to be Anita's nanny. She recalls that Anita was always good at drawing when she was a little girl and is now pleased to be working for Anita again as she starts a family of her own. She is the first to realize that Perdita is expecting with pups and when she notices Anita demonstrating all the same signs, she finds out Anita is pregnant, too.

When the Puppies are born, she brings the towels downstairs for Perdita and informs Roger and Pongo about their arrival. When Roger brings a stillborn pup back to life, she names it Lucky. She later arrives to give the Puppies their collars. On the night the Puppies are abducted while Roger and Anita are gone for a walk to the park (while also taking Pongo and Perdy with them), she was putting some unfinished dog food in a pot ("Waste not, want not, that's my motto").

When Horace and Jasper arrive, she does her best to fight back and manages to punch Horace in the face. However, they lock her in a cupboard under the stairs. Nanny breaks free and looks at the basket where the puppies are, realizing that Jasper and Horace stole the puppies. Then, Roger, Anita, Pongo, and Perdy arrive hearing the Pensioner's bulldog barking angrily at Jasper and Horace; Nanny explains that she tried to stop the two, but they locked her in the cupboard, and she shouted, but no one came to stop them. Roger and Anita then realize the mistake they made in leaving the puppies unprotected and call the police and the Pensioner, who then explain to them. During the Twilight Bark scene, Nanny is seen to bark in her sleep.

When Pongo and Perdita run off to find the Puppies, Nanny is able to guess why they did so and agrees with Roger's suspicion of Cruella being the culprit. When she notes that dogs can smell ill intentions, Anita suddenly realizes that Roger is right about Cruella and her motivation.

When the Puppies are returned, and the Dearly's are offered to keep them, Nanny figures they have seventeen already, so adding some more would be a good idea. In the end, she moves in with Roger and Anita when they move to the country.
