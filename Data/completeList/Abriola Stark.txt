'''Abriola Stark''', or simply '''Ms. Stark''', is a recurring character from the animated TV Series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is the highly enthusiastic math and theater teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]] whose assignments affect [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] and her friends.

==Background==
Abriola Stark is the math and theater teacher at [[Hazelnut Middle School]], implied to be the result of the school's lousy budget. Despite this, she takes to both jobs very well; perhaps too well. Stark is constantly involved with promoting events and theatrical plays at the school with her loud and boisterous personality. Much of her appearances usually revolved around her placing a lot of pressure on [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]], [[Milo Kamalani|Milo]] and [[Nicky Little|Nicky]] for some sort of project or activity, all the while being unaware of their personal conflicts.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Stark is still a teacher at the school, though she and the rest of the staff are disappointed in the fact that there is nothing significantly different about them after all these years.

===Personality===
Stark is loud and operatic and always seems to be in a good mood. While friendly, she is unaware of the fact that she can be off-putting to her students; making her somewhat socially unaware. She is not without her haughty moments however as she can be very determined and passionate to the point that she will yell while still maintaining her boisterous voice.

===Physical appearance===
Stark is a rotund African-American woman with large wild grey hair, mascara and red lipstick. She wears a large purple coat, black slacks, purple socks and small black shoes. Additionally, she wears gold, necklace, earrings and wrist bands. 

==Trivia==
*Stark and [[Roland Carter]] supposedly have been interested in each other. It is unknown if they ended up together by "The Finale". Additionally, she has shown to be interested in Owen Clapper.
