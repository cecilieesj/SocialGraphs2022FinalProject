'''Buff Frog's Tadpoles''' are thirteen (counting two who share an egg) tadpoles who appear in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''. They are [[Buff Frog]]'s adoptive children given to him by [[Ludo]] in the first season finale, "[[Storm the Castle]]". In "[[Starsitting]]" they start to develop into adults, gaining legs, a very important development for their species. 

Initially, Star and Marco, believed that Buff Frog's letters were the tadpoles sending them art. In the episode "[[The Battle for Mewni|Puddle Defender]]" the babies reveal they have developed arms and help Star sneak out of the house so she can go rescue her dad and stop Ludo/Toffee. 

In "[[Starfari]]", they are seen crammed into a baby carriage that is to small for them, but Buff Frog tells them its all they have. The tadpoles helps save the Monster Village from a great flood. In the episode, "[[Is Another Mystery]]" they leave Mewni with their dad hoping for a better life. They hug Star goodbye and Katrina, who left a note for Star about them leaving, with a friendship bracelet promising to always remember her. As of "[[Cornball!]]", the tadpoles are now fully grown teenagers as they develop a close resemblance to their father.

==Tadpoles==
*'''Katrina:''' She is the youngest out of all the tadpoles and, according to her father, must be handled with delicate care. Her inner part of her egg is smaller than her siblings and has big cute eyes. She is voiced by Kimaya Thais.
*'''Mikhail and Leo:''' They share an egg, which would make them conjoined twins. Mikhail is voiced by Max Charles and Leo is voiced by Zach Callison.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Starsitting]]", Buff Frog's Tadpoles grow legs.
