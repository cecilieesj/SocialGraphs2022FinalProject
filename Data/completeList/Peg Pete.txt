==Background==
Peg is the wife of [[Pete]] and the mother of [[P.J.]] and [[Pistol Pete|Pistol]]. She was a high school friend of Pete and Goofy in the past who performed as a cheerleader for the school's football team. Sometime after Goofy moved away from [[Spoonerville]], Peg married Pete and now works as a real estate agent. During the series, she is often seen trying to reign in Pete's worse traits. She is shown to be quite cynical and overbearing in regards to Pete, but treats her children much better than he usually does.

==Role in the series==
Most of Peg's appearances on the show put her in opposition to Pete, often through Pete's mishandling of money and/or treatment of their children. When Pete is in conflict with Goofy, she is often seen taking Goofy's side. In "[[Peg o' the Jungle]]", Peg, along with Goofy, Max, Pistol, and P.J teaches Pete to be more sensitive when Pete forgets their wedding anniversary. According to Peg, Pete used to be a much more attentive husband when they first married. Pete eventually gets the message, via a scam to make Pete think he had to win Peg back from a bunch of tribal lookalikes.

Other appearances occasionally feature her real-estate business, Peg-O-My-Heart Realty, though it is never gone into furthermore details.

==Printed media==
===''[[Disney Adventures]]'' comics===
From 1992 to 1997, ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine published a total of thirty comic strips based on the ''Goof Troop'' animated series. Despite making regular appearances in the TV show, Peg was only in seven of these comics. Her role was largely the same as in the show, always trying to keep Pete in check about his behavior and otherwise being a loving mother to both P.J. and Pistol.

Her most notable appearance was probably in the October 1992 story "Pavlov's Goof", in which she laments how Pete always spends every Saturday glued to the TV watching sports instead of doing the yard work and other chores of his. Once she finally gets him out of his chair and sends him out into the yard, she takes the kids shopping with her, ordering Pete to be done with his chores by the time she gets back.

Unbeknownst to her, however, Pete manages to hypnotize Goofy into doing all of his chores for him, so that he can keep watching TV. But, the hypnotized Goofy keeps misinterpreting Pete's orders to the point that he ends up running Pete's riding mower right through Pete's living room. It is right then that Peg returns to find her home in shambles. She then has Pistol hypnotize Pete just as he had done to Goofy, and orders Pete to spend the rest of the day and next fixing everything Goofy destroyed.

===''[[The Disney Afternoon (comic book)|The Disney Afternoon]]'' comics===
Similar to her limited appearances in ''Disney Adventures'', Peg appeared in only one of the five ''Goof Troop'' comics published in ''[[The Disney Afternoon (comic book)|The Disney Afternoon]]''. Titled "Dog Days" and published in April 1995, Peg is briefly seen in P.J.'s imagination when he tries to think of what he and Max should do with an old dog statue that they found, his first idea being to give it to his mother. Later, Peg is seen in person in a scene where she sees Pete off to head to an auction at his car lot, affectionately wishing him to make lots of money.

===''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]''===
In contrast to her few appearances in the American comics, Peg was regular in the French-original ''La Bande à Dingo''<ref>The French name for ''Goof Troop'', meaning "The Dingo Band"; with "Dingo" being Goofy's French name</ref> comics published in ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' from 1993 to 1995. Appearing in eight of the nine comics, Peg's role was generally the same as it was in the aforementioned "Pavlov's Goof" comic.

In what seems like a direct inspiration taken from that story, these French comics created a running gag exclusive to their stories in which Pete would always fall asleep in front of the TV instead of doing his chores, much to Peg's ire. Peg would usually argue with him over this bad habit of his and try to get him to wake up and do the housework and yard work that he's supposed to be doing. Like in "Pavlov's Goof", Pete would try to come up with some harebrained scheme to get out of doing his chores, but which would usually backfire and leave him on the receiving end of a scolding by Peg.

Peg also appeared (miscolored with orange hair and a maroon shirt) in the magazine's sole ''La Bande à Dingo'' gag mini-comic (published August 3, 1994 in the 2198th issue), which was presented as a part of the issue's Games section as a "Méli-Mélo" ("Mishmash") game wherein the comic's four panels were shown out of order to let the reader figure out the correct reading order for each panel. In this gag comic, Pete watches TV and hears the announcer tell him that, if he wants his wife to be in a good mood, he should pay her a complement every day. When Pete calls Peg over to complement her, he tells her "You're as pretty as a hamburger with ketchup!" Offended, Peg gives Pete a bruise on his cheek, making Pete regret having ever listened to what was said on the TV.

In the 2221st issue, published on January 11, [[1995]], Peg (along with the ''Goof Troop'' incarnations of Pete and P.J.) made a surprising appearance outside of ''La Bande à Dingo'' on the final page of a special ''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip published in that issue. Titled "Cent Ans de Cinéma" (meaning "One Hundred Years of Cinema"), this story featured [[Mickey Mouse]] and Goofy hosting a live broadcast of a special documentary that commemorates the 100th anniversary of cinema. At the end of the presentation, it is shown that Pete, P.J., and Peg were watching the live broadcast of this documentary on their home TV set together as a family. The conclusion of the documentary then inspires Pete to treat Peg and P.J. to an evening at the movies, much to their mutual delight.

===''La Bande à Dingo: Le Visiteur De L'Extra-Temps''===
In this 44-page French-original graphic novel (whose title translates to "The Visitor From Another Time"), Peg is one of the main characters along with rest of the ''Goof Troop'' cast. In this story, Peg initially catches Pete in front the TV again instead of cleaning out the garage like he's supposed to be doing, which prompts Pete to get up to do so. She then watches a dinosaur movie with Pistol, but which is cut short due to a sudden earthquake. Peg sees on the news that the quake was caused by a landslide at a local quarry that shook the whole neighborhood.

That night, Peg and Pete see a news report about the area where the quarry was, seeing that it was to be the site of a new residential area to be built by real estate developer Al Bétone. With Pete unfamiliar with the man, Peg then explains her awareness of Bétone through her real estate business.

The next day, when Pete brings home a new car, Peg demands Pete to put it away instead of leaving it out in the yard. But when a U.S. Army contingent soon shows up at their house, things get out of hand when Max and P.J. take off with what looks like a real baby dinosaur. Everyone gives chase through town, with Peg riding in Pete's RV with Goofy at the wheel. Peg demands that Goofy slow down, but he is so determined to catch up to his son that he ignores Peg's pleas.

The whole mess is sorted out the next morning at City Hall, where Peg appears with everyone else involved in the preceding day's spectacle. A week later, she, Pete, and Pistol watch a game show contest that Pete had previously attempted to enter. When Pete sees the winner submit the very same object that he had unknowingly had in his possession a week earlier, Pete is outraged and both Peg and Pistol beg him to calm down.

==Trivia==
*A prototype or precursor to Peg appears in the [[1952]] ''Goofy'' cartoon ''[[How to Be a Detective|How to Be a Detective]]''. A woman (voiced by [[June Foray]]) appears in the office of [[Goofy|Johnny Eyeball]] (Goofy) and asks him to find "Al". The police chief (Pete) tells Eyeball to leave finding "Al" to the police. At the end of the cartoon, Eyeball learns that "Al" (full name "Al Muldoon") is none other than the chief himself, and that he and the woman are getting married at the church. Like [[Mrs. Goof|Mrs. Goofy]], this woman's face is always hidden from view.
*Despite being prominent characters in ''Goof Troop'', neither Peg nor Pistol appear in either ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' or ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. In [[2020]], ''A Goofy Movie'' director [[Kevin Lima]] revealed on Twitter that Peg and Pistol may indeed have originally been included in an early draft of the film, but were cut as the story began to focus more on how well Goofy and Max contrasted with Pete and P.J., to the point that everyone else (including Peg and Pistol) became a distraction from the dynamic of the two father-son pairs.<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1249515314070441984 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Apr 12, 2020]</ref> Lima further explained that "AGM is a father son story. Pete and PJ’s father/son trip (having to always one up Goofy) is a nightmare mirror of Goofy and Max’s emotional journey. Peg and Pistol muddied that intention."<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1311349263448727552 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Sep 30, 2020]</ref> This decision to focus on Max and Goofy (as well as Peg and Pistol's absence from ''A Goofy Movie'' in the first place) is most likely why the two were also not in ''An Extremely Goofy Movie''.
*Still, since this explanation didn't come until a quarter of a century afterwards, the lack of any official word on the matter led numerous fans to speculate about their absence over the years. Common fan theories have supposed that Peg and Pete may have divorced in the time set between ''Goof Troop'' and ''A Goofy Movie'', with Peg taking custody of Pistol. The first scene of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' is often cited in support of this theory since Pete claims that P.J.'s leaving for college marks the end of his life of "babysitting" and the start of his new life as "a free man." If Pistol were still around, then this claim of Pete's barely makes any kind of sense. However, this claim already makes little sense regardless of Pistol's presence (see [[An Extremely Goofy Movie#Continuity errors|here]] for more), while the divorce theory itself actually goes against the very heart of Pete and Peg's marriage as seen in episodes like "[[Gymnauseum]]" and "[[Peg o' the Jungle]]".
**Specifically, in the former episode, when one of Pete's rivals, Tan Roadster, insults Pete's weight and makes a pass at Peg, she punches Tan in the face and defends her husband, stating "There is a lot of him but he's all mine!" While in the latter episode, Peg explicitly states that she and Pete have been married for twenty years, and sets up a challenge for Pete to prove his love for her, which he ultimately does, much to her delight.
**When asked directly if Pete and Peg had divorced in ''A Goofy Movie'', Kevin Lima gave the straightforward answer of "I honestly have no idea."<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1327414502506196993 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Nov 13, 2020]</ref> When asked again at a later date, he answered with "They didn't."<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1373488205094289413 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Mar 21, 2021]</ref> and "Because we were concentrating down on a father/son story, we left what Peg and Pistol were up to up to your imagination."<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyMovieDir/status/1373497664004780036 Kevin Lima on Twitter, posted Mar 21, 2021]</ref>
*If the above-mentioned French ''Mickey Mouse'' comic "Cent Ans de Cinéma" is anything to go by, it may in fact completely ''debunk'' the aforementioned fan theory of Peg having divorced Pete between ''Goof Troop'' and ''A Goofy Movie''. Said comic is strongly implied (all but stated outright, really) to take place on the 100th anniversary of the invention of the [[wikipedia:Cinomatograph|Cinématographe]] by the [[wikipedia:Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière Brothers]], who patented it on February 13, 1895 (as even stated by Mickey himself in the story, no less). One hundred years later from that date would be February 13, 1995. ''A Goofy Movie'' is indicated by several pieces of official merchandise<ref>Several T-shirts, baseball caps, bed sheets, and more all date [[Powerline]]'s concert tour in the movie to have occurred in 1995. See [[Powerline#Trivia|Powerline's article for more]].</ref> to take place in 1995, with a calendar seen in the movie (during its truck stop diner scene) further placing it in the month of June. If "Cent Ans de Cinéma" were to take place a mere four months prior to ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', then it is unlikely for Peg and Pete to have divorced by the movie's time since the two were not only shownn to be still married in the comic, but more specifically ''happily'' married, with Pete even gladly and willingly treating Peg (and P.J.) to an evening at the movies.
*On [[July 27]], [[2021]], the [[1996]] French graphic novel adaptation of ''A Goofy Movie'' was fully adapted into English by Fantagraphics. This new English adaptation added in some deliberate continuity references to ''Goof Troop'' not found in either the original French version or in the movie itself. Specifically, in one of the newly-added references, Goofy actually mentions both Peg and Pistol by name during the photo studio scene between him and Pete, referring to them both as if they were still living with Pete and P.J. during the movie's time.
*Her name is a play on Pete's name from the original Mickey Mouse cartoons, Peg-Leg Pete.
*Peg is the very first series regular of any Disney series to be voiced by [[April Winchell]]. Her first Disney television character was [[The Bug Master]] from ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''. Coincidentally, the [[Darkwing Duck (character)|titular character]] of ''Darkwing Duck'' was also voiced by [[Jim Cummings]], who voiced Peg's husband, Pete in ''Goof Troop''.
