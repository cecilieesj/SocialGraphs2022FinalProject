'''Joseph''', although his name is never mentioned in the entirety of the film, it is pretty obvious that he is the one who buys [[Small One (character)|Small One]] in the end of Disney's [[1978]] animated Christmas short film, ''[[The Small One]]''. The line "I need a gentle donkey to carry my wife to Bethlehem" says it all.

==Background==
Despire his name not being mentioned, Joseph kindly comforts the Boy who is crying because no one would buy Small One. He kindly asks the Boy that he needs Small One to take his wife Mary to Bethlehem, to which the Boy looking at him accepts and gives the donkey to him so that Small One was able to carry his pregnant wife to Bethlehem where the ending scene shows Joseph taking his wife Mary to Bethlehem with Small One carrying his wife, followed by the Star of Bethlehem appearing on the sky to mark the birth of Jesus.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Small One]]''===
Joseph is seen somewhere in the end, at night, noticing [[The Boy|a Boy]] and [[Small One (character)|his donkey]] sad. He asks the Boy if Small One is for sale and the Boy says yes. Joseph asks him if he has a name and the Boy replies: "Small One". Joseph tells him that he needs a donkey to carry his pregnant wife, the Virgin Mary, to Bethlehem. The Boy and Small One agree and Small One is bought for one piece of silver. Joseph then promises the Boy that he and his wife will take good care of Small One and the Boy smiles. Then, Joseph and Small One walk away and say good-bye to the Boy.

Joseph is later seen from a far distance, with his wife Mary riding on Small One, traveling to Bethlehem, not before spotting the Boy, from a far distance, and all waving at him and vice versa.

In the end, Joseph, Mary, and Small One continue traveling until a few moments later, [[Wikipedia:Star of Bethlehem|a bright star]] is seen shining in the sky, to symbolize the birth of Joseph and Mary's newborn son, [[Wikipedia:Jesus Christ|Jesus Christ]].
