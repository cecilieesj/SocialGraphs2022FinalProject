}}'''Rex "X-Ray"''' is a camper at Camp Green Lake in the film, ''[[Holes]]''. He serves as the leader of D-tent.
==Personality==
X-Ray had a mixed personality. While he could be funny and kind, he could also be rather selfish and greedy. Examples of which include taking [[Stanley Yelnats IV|Stanley's]] bread from his dinner plate, and taking all the credit, plus the day off, when Stanley found a bullet (lipstick tube) with [[Katherine Barlow|Kate Barlow's]] initials inscribed on it.
