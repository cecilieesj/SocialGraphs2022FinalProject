'''McKibble''' is one of the two secondary antagonists (the other being [[Brick]]) in ''[[Inspector Gadget 2]]''. He is one of [[Dr. Claw]]'s henchmen and Brick's best friend.

==Trivia==
* When Claw announces he plans to pull off another 'Crime of the century", McKibble says he is still on parole "from the last one", indicating he was still a henchman behind the scenes during the first movie.
