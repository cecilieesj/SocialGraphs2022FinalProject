==Biography==
Cecil is first seen greeting Christopher just a while after his family left and invites him to a game of rummy, to which Christopher refutes. It's been said that he's quite persistent in this endeavor.

He appears again the next day to visit Christopher in his backyard to again invite him to play rummy, but Christopher again denies, though nervously this time as he has now just reunited with [[Winnie the Pooh]]. Cecil leaves in disappointment. He is not seen again after this.{{CharacterStub}}{{Winnie the Pooh}}
