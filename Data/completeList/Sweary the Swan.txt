[[File:Swerrytheswan.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Sweary the Swan''' is a swan and [[Perry the Platypus]]' counterpart in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode "[[Steampunx]]".

==Biography==
Like Perry, he is normally acting like a "mindless swan" in front of [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]], but he has the double life of secret agent fighting [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Professor Von Doofenshmirtz]]. He is frequently accused of swearing by everyone who hears him, hence the name "Swear-y the Swan" as Professor Von Doofenshmirtz points it out, though to the viewer's ear he seems to simply makes normal swan noises.{{CharacterStub}}
