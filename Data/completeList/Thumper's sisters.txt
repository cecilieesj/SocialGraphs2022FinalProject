They are very playful and are always looking for Thumper, which in turn bothers him. But, like any sibling, they always find their way to the true meaning of family.

==Appearance==
Like their mother, [[Mrs. Hare]], they are cream-colored bunnies with white cheeks and undersides. They like to sing as shown in ''Bambi II''. They are very playful when around their big brother Thumper, who always tries to hide from them.

==Trivia==
*In the first film, Thumper had five sisters. However, in ''[[Bambi II]]'', only four of them appear.
*Thumper's sisters are unnamed in the films. However, in the 1963 Disneyland album "Peter Cottontail" narrated by Lucille Bliss, they were named Blossom, Violet, Nillie, and Frillie. Also, in the "Disney Rabbits" Storybooks, they were named Trixie, Daisy, Ria, and Tessie.
