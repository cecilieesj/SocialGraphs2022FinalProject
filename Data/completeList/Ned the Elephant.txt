==Background==
Ned lived in the jungle, where he was very popular amongst every other animal. He also had his own good luck club, which began to fall apart after Ned found an unlucky jar.

===Personality===
{{Quote|Let me take a moment to point at you and laugh derisively.|Ned to [[Timon]]}}
Ned is a high and mighty elephant who thinks he's wonderful at everything. He can also be egoistic and sarcastic. He enjoys playing the king of his two hippo friends and is prone to enjoy teasing [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] by laughing at them whenever they try to prove their worth to him.

Despite his ego, Ned can have a change of heart and is willing to make an offer to those who do prove themselves worthy, as shown when he asks Pumbaa to join him and his group as an honorary elephant after the warthog saves his life. Ned is also shown to be superstitious, as he has a fear of panthers, apparently believing that they cause bad luck.

With his popularity, Ned is loved and respected by every animal in the jungle, with his hippo henchmen pampering him and birds riding on him. One of his skills is his ability to move giant logs with his trunk.

===Physical Description===
Ned has the typical appearance of an elephant: obese and gray with pink ears and white tusks.

==Role in the series==
==="[[Uganda Be an Elephant]]"===
[[File:UBAE Ned2.png|thumb|left|250px|Ned with his hippo henchmen.]]
Timon and Pumbaa look upon Ned the elephant, seeing how popular he is. Timon points out all the benefits an elephant enjoys over every other animal, including a trunk for showers, birds that ride on his back, and the utility of long tusks. Pumbaa begins contemplating becoming an elephant and the next morning, he excitedly asks Timon for help in transforming himself into an elephant. Because Pumbaa's reason to change is to be more popular, Timon jumps on the opportunity.

The first step is for Pumbaa to become bigger and fatter. Timon soon begins shoveling worms into Pumbaa's mouth. The warthog is happy at first, but as he becomes full, he becomes miserable and thinks perhaps he should be himself.

The next step, Timon says, is to condition his pal's mind, since elephants never forget. Soon, Timon becomes frustrated by Pumbaa's slow wit and poor memory. Pumbaa points out that the reason Timon is not popular, is because he is grumpy.

The final enhancement Timon attempts to make is to stretch Pumbaa's snout out to be an elephant trunk. He wedges Pumbaa's head between two palm trees and hooks a rope to his nose. He rolls a boulder over the edge which pulls the rope on Pumbaa's nose and stretches it to a disproportionate length. Timon congratulates his pal on his successful transformation into an elephant and convinces him to gloat in Ned's face. Pumbaa, however, does not want to show his elephant form to the pachyderm as he has a feeling that he will get laughed at and made fun of. Timon tells his pal that he will be right there with him and that he'll help him.

When they arrive, Ned and his two hippo friends point and laugh at the "Pumbaaphant." They laugh so hard that, as they're walking away, they plummet over a cliff, making it up to Pumbaa to rescue them. Barely hanging on, Ned still tries to make fun of Pumbaa. Eventually he grabs onto Pumbaa's nose and is towed up. Ned gets a change of heart and offers Pumbaa an honorary spot in his clique. However, Pumbaa refuses, saying that he is proud to be exactly who he is: a warthog.

==="[[Unlucky in Lesotho]]"===
Ned starts his Good Luck Club, which lost most of its members, with the only remaining member being a zebra. The zebra tells Ned that the reason no one ever shows up to his club anymore is that he bought an unlucky jar. When Ned states that the jar is not that unlucky, the zebra reminds the elephant of the misfortunes that happened to Goldie, a smiling crocodile who caught an unlucky disease that caused all his teeth to fall out, leaving him broke and having to move back with his mother, and Horatio, a happy and jolly hippo who took weight gain pills which turn out to be weight loss pills. The zebra then loses most of his stripes and flees, resulting in Ned agreeing with him.

Having learned about Timon wanting to join his club, Ned goes to the meerkat and asks him why he wants to do so, to which he replies by pointing out the lucky things happening to them. Ned then tells Timon that in order to become a member, he has to protect the unlucky jar for one whole day, tricking him into telling him that it's lucky. Therefore, Timon has to follow Ned and after reading a book about bad luck, the meerkat becomes superstitious.

Protecting the jar proves to be a challenge for Timon, as Pumbaa brings home a [[Panther Cub|panther cub]], since black cats mean bad luck according to the book Timon was reading. When the jar later gets destroyed and Timon finds out about the panther cub, the meerkat decides to stick the jar back together to fool Ned, but also tells Pumbaa to take the panther cub back to where he found it.

When Timon brings Ned the jar, with the pieces glued together to fool the elephant, Ned is not convinced and breaks it with his trunk. The elephant then makes fun of Timon's unluckiness, laughs at him, and is about to humiliate the meerkat by telling the whole jungle what an "unlucky loser" he is.

The panther cub shows up and scares Ned, making the elephant fall off a canyon but land safely in the ravine. Not long after Ned is proud to be away from the unlucky jar, he gets surrounded and eaten by piranhas. After Timon and Pumbaa witness Ned being attacked, Timon praises the panther cub for saving him from major humiliation, realizing that the cub is not such bad luck after all. The cub soon becomes Timon and Pumbaa's new friend.

==Trivia==
*Ned is the first character to be killed in ''Timon & Pumbaa''; the other being [[the Cobra]].
*In real life, an elephant wouldn't be eaten by piranhas since their teeth wouldn't be able to penetrate an elephant's skin. Moreover, the piranhas are not native to Africa, although they could be tiger fish the African counterpart to piranhas.
