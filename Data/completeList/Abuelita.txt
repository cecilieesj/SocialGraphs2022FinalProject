'''Abuelita''' is a character in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''. She is the grandmother of [[Soos Ramirez]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Abuelita is a very calm old woman with fairly simple wants and needs, desiring only quiet and cleanliness, as seen by her habit of instantly jumping to clean things the moment they're dirtied. Despite her somewhat sedentary behavior, however, she's still quite aware of her surroundings, as she was quick to point out that she couldn't support the Pines family for long with how much food she could afford. She speaks both English and Spanish.

===Physical appearance===
Abuelita is an elderly woman, with a somewhat portly frame and stout build, similar to her grandson. She has a head of tall, puffy, blue-grey hair, and wears a pair of pale emerald green earrings. She typically wears a magenta shirt, and a cooking apron with a heart on it.

==Role in the series==
Abuelita first appears in "[[Gideon Rises]]". After the events of the previous episode, "[[Dreamscaperers]]", [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]], [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], and [[Stan Pines|Stan]] are forced to move in with her due to [[Li'l Gideon|Gideon]]'s hostile takeover of [[the Mystery Shack]]. She is seen to be very tolerant of their presence, only asking that they keep quiet. She cleans up any messes they happen to make with a vacuum, including Stan messing up her lipstick upon figuring out Gideon's secret and kissing her, before walking away saying she'll vacuum her face now.

==Trivia==
*Abuelita means "grandma" or "granny" in Spanish.
*In the episode, "[[Weirdmageddon Part 1]]" she is turned into a chair by [[Bill Cipher]]'s magic. However, she remains unfazed despite being a chair.
