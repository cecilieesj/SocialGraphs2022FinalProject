==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Animation]]===
====''[[Avengers Assemble]]''====
Moon Knight makes a cameo in the episode "Avengers World" among the heroes the Avengers planned to recruit in their expansion program. Moon Knight fully appears in the episode "Beyond" where the pyramid he is guarding ends up in the Battleworld domain of Egyptia. When Captain America and Black Widow enter the pyramid and reunite with Iron Man, they fight a mind-controlled Moon Knight and an army of sand-powered mummies to claim a certain orb that he is guarding. After a lengthy battle, Iron Man destroys the device controlling Moon Knight as he helps to finish off the remaining mummies. When Captain America thanks him for his help and states that they would need more soldiers in battle, Moon Knight states that he has to keep the evils locked in the pyramid from being freed. Before leaving with Iron Man and Black Widow, Captain America states that the offer still stands when he is ready.

====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
Moon Knight makes a guest appearance in the episode, [[The Moon Knight Before Christmas]]. This version is shown to follow the advice of the Moon, but there is no mentioning of Khonshu. He is first seen chasing after Frances Beck where Spider-Man saves her while house-sitting for Doctor Strange. After figuring out that Frances Beck is the daughter of Mysterio and recalling Doctor Strange's "The Enemy of My Enemy is My Friend" quote, Spider-Man works with Moon Knight in order to take out the female Mysterio. Using a special wand from a restricted room in the Sanctum Sanctorum at the Moon's advice, Moon Knight impales the Mysterio helmet with it. After Spider-Man extracts Quentin Beck and Frances Beck from the helmet before they are doomed, Moon Knight joins Spider-Man, Aunt May, Quentin Beck, and Frances Beck into having dinner. In the final scene, Moon Knight cracks a comment about Spider-Man talking to people who aren't there just like he cracked comments about Moon Knight talking to the Moon.

====''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''====
Moon Knight appears in the episode "[[Vengeance of Venom]]". This version became a cynical survivalist after someone close to him was killed, leading Marc Spector to abandon the Moon Knight identity. After Spector  saves Spider-Man during the [[Symbiotes|Klyntar]] invasion, Spider-Man tries to convince him to get out of retirement and reassume his place as the Moon Knight, but Spector is reluctant. Following a pep talk from May Parker during another battle with the Klyntar, Spector becomes Moon Knight again and assists in the fight against the aliens.

He also has a third name Jake Lockley is more brute.

In [[The Goldfish Problem]], we are introduced to Steven Grant a museum worker who occasionally suffers from blackouts and memories of another life. After going to sleep one night, he wakes up in another country, and witnesses a cult meeting led by [[Arthur Harrow]], who demands a scarab Grant unknowingly had in his possession. He escapes and is nearly killed, but is unknowingly saved by a mysterious voice in his head. After waking up in his home and noticing several oddities, Grant realizes that two days have passed since he went to sleep. Upon returning home from a mis-scheduled date, Grant finds a hidden phone and keycard in his apartment. He gets a call from a mysterious woman called Layla, who calls him Marc. The next day at work, Grant is confronted by Harrow, who reveals that he is a servant of the goddess [[Ammit]]. Later that night, Harrow summons a jackal monster that attacks Grant at the museum. Just as Grant is cornered by the monster, his reflection in the mirror tells Grant to let him take control. Grant agrees and he transforms into a cloaked warrior who then kills the monster.
