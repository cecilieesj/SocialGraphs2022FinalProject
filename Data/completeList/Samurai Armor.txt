Two suits of '''Samurai Armor''' are featured in the [[Mystic Manor]] attraction at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

==Description==
These suits of armor are based on the ancient samurai from feudal [[Japan]]. They are one of the artifacts which are displayed in the Arms & Armour section of the Mystic Manor attraction which [[Henry Mystic|Lord Henry Mystic]] collected and displayed in [[Mystic Manor (location)|Mystic Manor]]. There are two suits of samurai armor featured in the armory section each with a menacing face: one which is a slender red and black samurai armor equipped with a katana who assaults [[Albert the Monkey|Albert]] who is hiding inside a cannon and another one which is dubbed a "samurai"<ref>https://jungleskipper.com/gallery/attractions/mystic-manor/mystic-manor-samurai.jpg</ref> who holds various helmets on his halberd held on his left hand and two additional helmets on his right hand in triumph implying that he defeated various enemies in battle while laughing wickedly which can be seen on the other side of the section.

==Role in the attraction==
The red and black samurai armor is the first armor seen in the Arms & Armour section just as the attraction itself becomes menacing with more hazards that [[Albert the Monkey|Albert]] is facing while while weapons on shields in the background move by themselves. As the [[Mystic Manor Theme Song|attraction's theme song]] is heard in the background sung by a trio of knights, the samurai attempts to chop Albert's head off but Albert successfully hides in the cannon to avoid getting hit by the katana. Another cannon next to the one Albert is hiding blasts in front of the vehicles, sending the guests in one of two directions. Because it is a trackless ride, each time guests ride on the attraction, they will be taken to a different route: one which is a samurai-like armor carrying various helmets in triumph while laughing wickedly and the other route which consists of three knights whose helmets are separate from each other, followed by a crossbow which attempts to fire an arrow at the guests but misses. Either one of these routes can send the guests to the Egyptian Antiquities area. The next scene where Albert is seen is where he managed to escape from the samurai armor.

Later after Albert shuts the music box at the end of the attraction, all the suits of armor remain in their lifeless forms.

==Trivia==
*A suit of samurai armor was briefly seen in the [[2003]] film adaptation of ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'' in the Gracey Manor area.
*In the presentation for Mystic Manor at [[D23]] on [[August 9]], [[2013]], the samurai-like armor that carries various helmets while laughing wickedly when either one of the two routes is chosen at the armory area is identified as "[[Trader Sam]]", the incorrect name for [[Chief Nah-Mee]] from the [[Jungle Cruise]] attraction at the parks, implying that this armor serves as a parallel to Nah-Mee from the [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] incarnations of Jungle Cruise in Mystic Manor albeit as a suit of armor instead of a human. In that same presentation, the three singing knights are identified as parallel to [[the Singing Busts]] from the original [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion attraction]]<ref>[https://youtu.be/rXWZ6zI9mgQ At 30:57 to 31:04 duration of the D23 presentation of Mystic Manor is where the samurai-like armor carrying various helmets is identified as "Trader Sam" while at 31:06 to 31:13 duration of the same video is where the knights are identified of being parallel to the Singing Busts].</ref>
