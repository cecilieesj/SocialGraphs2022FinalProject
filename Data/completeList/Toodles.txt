'''Toodles''' is a major character in the preschool TV series ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''.

==Looks==
Toodles is a flat floating yellow disk that is shaped like Mickey's head, red and yellow stripes on the right ear, red and yellow spots on the left ear. He wears a blue screen with red, pink, and yellow polka dots, sky blue eyes, coral cheeks, and thin red lips.

==Appearances==

Toodles is a super computer that is always there to help Mickey and the gang find the answers they need. He is always shown to come when Mickey and / or one or all of his friends call "Oh Toodles!". In seasons 1-2 and most season 3 episodes, he is just a helper with no face and no voice approaching Mickey and his friends when they call him. However, in later episodes, he is portrayed as a good friend to them.

To summon Toodles, Mickey and the gang would have to call out, "Oh, Toodles!" Toodles will then appear and show the Mousketools for the episode, as downloaded into him from the Mouskedoer. When a Mousketool has been chosen, Toodles will light up and Mickey will prompt, "We've got ears! Say, 'Cheers'!", and the Mousketool will be dispensed. If the Mousketool chosen was the last for the episode, Toodles will flash with fireworks and Mickey says, "We've used all of our Mousketools! Say, 'Super cheers'!".

In certain episodes at some points, Mickey and the gang would have to be quiet when summoning Toodles and picking the Mousketools, possibly to avoid waking up a sleeping enemy around, thus he asks the viewer to whisper the usual phrases. The episodes where Mickey had to be quiet when choosing a mousketool are:
* [[Mickey Goes Fishing]]
* [[Donald and the Beanstalk]]
* [[Mickey's Treat]]
* [[Mickey's Great Clubhouse Hunt]]
* [[Donald's Special Delivery]]
* [[Goofy Babysitter]]
* [[Daisy's Pony Tale]]

==Trivia==

*He speaks with a stutter.
*He first appeared with his face in "[[Happy Birthday Toodles]]". He also gains his voice in the same episode. This wasn't put to permanent use until Season 4.
*Before becoming the super computer for the Mouskedoer, he used to be an alarm clock.
*A Toodles-styled alarm clock made an appearance in the episode "[[Where's Mickey?]]" and the "Mickey Mornings" short series. This is a reference to Toodles originally being an alarm clock.
*Toodles and Quoodles have a huge mutual crush on each other.
*In "[[Mickey's Mousekedoer Adventure]]", it is revealed that Toodles' power stems off from the Mousekedoer. Meaning, if the Mousekedoer malfunctions or stops working, then Toodles does too.
*Daisy confirms in the episode "[[Road Rally]]" that, despite being a robot, Toodles still needs sleep.
**This is proven when Toodles is shown sleeping in the Mousekedoer in "[[Space Adventure]]."
*Toodles has shown at least 30 different transformations (see the Powers and Abilities area) so far.
*In [[Mickey's Message from Mars|“Mickey's Message from Mars]]”, Mickey and his friends called him for a Mouseketool by saying "Toodles, oh!" instead of the usual "Oh, Toodles!" when needing something to cross the sea of sticky sand.
*Toodles appears to have the ability to camouflage in "[[Goofy on Mars]]."
*Toodles is one of two characters to appear in every episode of "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse" (not counting the Hot Dog Dance sequence). The other being [[Mickey Mouse]].
*Sometimes when Toodles is summoned, he shouts, "Heeeeeeere's Toodles!", which is a parody of the famous line "Heeeeeeere's Johnny!" from ''The Shining''.
*[[Sheamus]], [[Quoodles]] (his girlfriend), [[Boodles]], [[Woodles]], and [[Goofles]] (his cousin) act similarly to Toodles.
