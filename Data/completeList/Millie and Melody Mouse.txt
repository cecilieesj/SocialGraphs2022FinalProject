'''Millie''' and '''Melody Mouse''' are the twin nieces of [[Minnie Mouse]]. Although they can be full of mischief, they are sweet, just like their aunt. They are the female counterparts of [[Mickey Mouse]]'s nephews [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]].

==History==
The only known speculative theatrical film appearance of either of Minnie's nieces is in [[1983]]'s ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', where Mickey Mouse, as [[Bob Cratchit]], has a daughter. In this film, Morty and Ferdie are said to have played Cratchit's 2 sons (including one as [[Tiny Tim]]), and since Melody seems to be the most consistent name used for any niece attributed to Minnie, it is quite likely that it was Melody who played the role of Bob Cratchit's daughter.

In [[2011]], the twins would co-star in the [[Disney Junior]] series, ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]''. They first appeared in the episode "Trouble Times Two" where they visit Minnie and are shown to be crafty troublemakers.

==Animated Appearances==
===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===
The first animated appearance of either of the girls is ''Mickey's Christmas Carol'', in which one of them plays the daughter of Bob and Emily Cratchit ([[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]]).

===''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]''===
Here, they first appear in the episode "Trouble Times Two". They've made semi-regular appearances since.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''===
In ''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse'', they first appeared in the special "[[Minnie's Winter Bow Show]]".

===''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]''===
The twins appeared in the ''Roadster Racers/Mixed-Up Adventures'' series, helping their aunt as assistants in the Happy Helpers business.

==Comics==
While Millie and Melody made appearances in the comics, they only had a handful of them while the rest of the kids made more appearances in the comics.
