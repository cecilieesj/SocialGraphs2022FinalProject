==Appearances==
===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===
These robotic canines were [[Professor Norton Nimnul]]'s inventions from the episode "[[Catteries Not Included]]", used for kidnapping all the cats in the city to make an immense amount of static electricity until one of them was badly damaged after failing to catch a cat (actually, a fake cat created by [[Chip and Dale|Dale]] and [[Monterey Jack]]). After saving Spunky the kitten and snatching the remote from Nimnul, Nimnul ordered two of his Robot Dogs to fetch the remote while the badly damaged dog was told to get rid of Spunky hanging on to Nimnul's rear but due to its bad damage, it began to focus on Spunky and Nimnul thus began a chase between the [[Rescue Rangers]] and the two Robot Dogs and another one between Nimnul and the badly damaged dog. With the Professor's remote in the hands of the Rescue Rangers, they were able to defeat the two Robot Dogs while the badly damaged one was able to swallow the Professor whole (after being stuck to Spunky again); missing Spunky and then went to sleep with the Professor swearing retaliation on him and the world and "wondering where his can opener is."

The Robot Dogs also appear as enemies in the first stage of the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (video game)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' NES game.
