'''Uncle Topolino''' is a minor character in the [[2011]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Cars 2]]''.

==Personality==
Topolino is kind and nice, and loves to help out. This is parodied in the trailer "V12 TV" when he takes the name of "Dr. Fill it Up", a parody of ''Dr. Phil''.

==''Cars 2''==
In the small village of Carsoli, near [[Porto Corsa]], [[Italy]], Luigi’s favorite uncle, Uncle Topolino, resides with his beloved wife, [[Mama Topolino]]. Uncle Topolino is a 1937 Fiat 500 "Topolino" and the owner of the village’s tire shop, Topolino's Tires, where he taught [[Luigi]] and [[Guido]] everything they know, though Uncle Topolino is full of sage advice about more than just tires.<ref>[http://a.dolimg.com/franchise/cars/content/promos/movies/cars2_production_notes.pdf Cars 2 Production Notes]</ref>

In the movie, he greets Team [[Lightning McQueen]]. He then says that he can tell that McQueen is sad, but he states later that Luigi told him. McQueen tells Topolino his problem of being mean to [[Mater]] and Mater leaving. He tells McQueen some wise words of wisdom. He tells him that Luigi and Guido used to always fight, but they always resolved their problems. After strolling off with Mama Topolino, he is not seen for the rest of the movie.
