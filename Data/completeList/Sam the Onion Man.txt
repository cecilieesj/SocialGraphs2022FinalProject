==Role in the film==
He is an African American merchant in [[Green Lake Town|the town of Green Lake]]. Sam has an onion farm across the lake. He sells sweet onions, and a wide variety of products and medicines made from his onions. He owns a donkey named Mary Lou.

Sam helps repair [[Katherine Barlow|Kate's]] [[Green Lake School|schoolhouse]] in exchange for her renowned spiced peaches. While helping Kate, they fall in love. When Sam kisses Kate, the townspeople burn the school. Sam attempts to escape on his boat, the "Mary Lou", but sadly, [[Trout Walker]] shoots him. In retaliation, Kate kills the local sheriff and resorts to a life of crime and murdering everyone who stands in her way. 

== Trivia ==
* Sam's spirit seems to have been behind the lake drying up. Until an injustice at Green Lake was resolved, he kept it cursed to never rain; notably after the Yelnats curse was broken, rain finally came as the crimes committed by the Walker family (killing Sam and forcing children to dig for the treasure) were acknowledged and the consequences for their actions led to [[Warden Walker|Warden Walker's]] arrest.
