'''Great-great-great-great Grandmother Bunny''' is the wise old relative of Bean Bunny, Lugsy and Twitch in the 1986 Muppets special ''The Tale of the Bunny Picnic''.

She is also a bunny potion maker - she creates new potions for the bunnies. She attempts to create a sleeping potion/hopping potion combination. It is her sleeping potion that assists the bunnies in their attempt to save the Bunny Picnic. For an old rabbit, she is quite fast, as she was able to outrun her great-great-great-great grandchildren, Lugsy and Twitch, leaving them tired and out of breath. She later was seen as one of the carolers during the "Scrooge" number of ''The Muppet Christmas Carol''.
