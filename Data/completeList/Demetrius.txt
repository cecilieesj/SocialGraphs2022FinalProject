==Trivia==

* Ironically, as a pottery salesman, Demetrius probably ended up selling urns dedicated to Hercules, which would be completely ironic given his treatment of the latter.
* Demetrius was probably named after Demetrius of Alopece, a Greek sculptor from the 4th Century BC, renowned for his life like work.
* He holds the distinction of being the first Disney character to be voiced by [[Wayne Knight]].
