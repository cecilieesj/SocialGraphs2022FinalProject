She helps [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] adopt [[Stitch]] when he lands in her [[Aloha Animal Rescue|animal shelter]]. She also made a few guest appearances in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''===
Susan runs an animal shelter where [[Stitch]] ends up being flung into while escaping from [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]]. At the same time, [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] comes to the shelter to get Lilo a pet to curb her behavior, and [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] just so happens to find Stitch and instantly becomes fascinated with him. When Stitch is shown to Susan, she gets frightened by his appearance at first, but eventually calms down after Lilo says she wants to adopt him.

===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
In "[[Sample (episode)|Sample]]", Susan calls a pair of "alien hunters" named [[Merwin and Dean]] to deal with Experiment 258 ([[Sample]]), who had been captured and brought to the shelter.

In "[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]", Susan points out that Mr. Patterson, an old dog at the pound, has been waiting for months to be adopted and that his time was pretty much up. Lilo then cleverly unleashes Experiment 151 ([[Babyfier]]), who turns the old dog into an adorable puppy. Shortly after, Mr. Patterson is adopted from the shelter by a little boy.

In "[[Skip (episode)|Skip]]", Susan presents Experiment 089 ([[Skip]]) to Lilo when she asks if there have been any new "dogs" brought to the animal shelter lately. She then lets Lilo take Skip home with her.

==Trivia==
*Her name is not mentioned onscreen, but appears on the adoption papers she has Nani sign.
*She is named after her voice actress, a dialect coach and occasional actress who worked on films like ''[[Pocahontas (film)|Pocahontas]]'', ''{{WikipediaLink|Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic}}'', ''{{WikipediaLink|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind}}'', ''[[Ratatouille]]'', and ''[[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day]]''.
