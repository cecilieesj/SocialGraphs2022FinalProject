==Role in the film==
Spink was [[Prince Charming]]'s valet. He made his first appearance hunting with his master. Later, after receiving news of the ball from the [[The King (Cinderella)|King]], he went out to deliver the invitations with the royal heralds. On the night of the ball, Spink fell in love with [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s pet turtle, Clarissa, whom the [[Fairy Godmother]] had turned human so that she could accompany her mistress. Upon seeing that [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] was leaving, Spink chased her down the palace steps, only for him to trip and fall into a reflecting pool.

The next day, Spink went from house to house, searching for the owner of the [[Glass Slipper|glass slipper]]. When he reached the [[Cinderella's Château|chateau]], [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]] nearly succeeded in cramming the slipper onto her foot. However, the [[Mice|mice]] quickly stole it from her. At this, Spink chased after the mice who led him down to the cellar where [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] had been locked up.
