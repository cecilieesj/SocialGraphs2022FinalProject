==History==

He was a snobbish, spoiled, and arrogant prince of the Kingdom of Rodegan, whom [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] was charged to protect from the [[Knights of Rodegan]] in "[[Royal Pain (episode)|Royal Pain]]", because of his ancestors' tyrannical behavior toward them. The prophecy read that the monarchy would end with him. While they failed to kill him, the monarchy did end with him, as he decided to return to the country into a democracy after his father retired.
