{{Quote|Don't screw with the Sovereign.|Ayesha|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2}}
Due to the Guardians of the Galaxy's new reputation as heroes, High Priestess Ayesha, leader of the xenophobic, gold-skinned Sovereign, hires the Guardians to defend valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster, the Abilisk, in exchange for Nebula, whom the Sovereign captured following the Battle of Xandar, trying to steal the batteries.

Rocket steals several of the Anulax Batteries for himself, and when the Sovereign discover this, they attack the Guardians’ ship, the ''Milano'', with their own fleet of Sovereign drones. The ''Milano'' is heavily damaged and forced to crash-land on a nearby planet, but the rest of the Sovereign fleet is single-handedly destroyed by Ego.

Ayesha hires Yondu Udonta, who has been exiled from the greater Ravager community for trafficking children, to recapture the Guardians. Yondu’s crew track down the Milano and capture Rocket Raccoon and Groot, with the help of Nebula.

Ayesha later leads a Sovereign fleet against the Guardians, as they attack the core of [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]]. The whole fleet is eventually destroyed, causing Ayesha to rage.

Ayesha then decides to develop a new breed of Sovereign to destroy the Guardians, whom she names [[Adam Warlock|Adam]].

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Ayesha was created by the Enclave, with the unacknowledged aid of [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], in order to resurrect their plan to end war and crime through the creation of an artificial human after the failure of the first attempt with "[[Adam Warlock|Him]]". Originally referred to as Paragon, she would later be called other names like her, Ayesha and Kismet.
*In the alternate future of [[w:c:marvel:Earth-691|Earth-691]], Ayesha is the biological mother of [[Stakar Ogord]].
