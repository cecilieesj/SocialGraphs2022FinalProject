==Role in the series==
===''[[The Ukumbusho Tradition]]''===
Kion portrays Askari in the Ukumbusho Tradition. He describes how Askari had made peace with the elephants in order to keep the Circle of Life in balance.

===''[[Cave of Secrets]]''===
Askari is mentioned and appears in a painting. Makini explains that he and his Lion Guard had used teamwork to overcome a group of evil lions who were threatening the Pride Lands.

===''[[The Lake of Reflection]]''===
Askari finally makes his physical debut appearance in the final season's episode as a spirit after only appearing as a painting in the previous episodes.

After Mufasa tells Kion that he cannot return the roar to him, he tells him the roar came from Cikha Escarpment. Arriving there, Kion talks to Askari who recognizes him as the leader of the first Lion Guard to which Askari tells Kion he knew him as the new leader of the Guard as he tells him that he thought the Roar made Kion the leader to which Kion is unsure if he should control the Roar anymore as he led the Guard before the Roar to which he decides to give back the Roar so he is ready to learn everything all that the Roar can do.

===''[[Triumph of the Roar]]''===
When the Lion Guard goes on patrol to protect the Tree of Life, Kion returns to Cikha Escarpment once again to continue talking to Askari who teaches Kion all about the different powers of Roar of the Elders to which he explains one who is ready to let go of the Roar can truly master the power. Soon as Kion decides to give up the Roar, he tells Kion that he has everything the Roar can do.

Inside the Tree of Life, Bunga tells Rani about Kion to which Makini told her that Queen Janna showed her a painting a long time ago which told a legend that Askari would go to Cikha Escarpment and practice to learn everything the Roar can do. Rani and Bunga decide to talk to Kion who is talking to Askari. Askari tells Kion to stay calm, focus, and roar to control. Mastering the power of the roar, Askari sings to Kion to make him learn the power of the roar. As Kion continues practicing the roar under Askari's command, Kion continues practicing over the roar to which he finishes mastering the power of the roar and uses it defeat Makucha's army and destroy the boulder blocking the Tree of Life to free the Night Pride and Makini.

===''[[Return to the Pride Lands]]''===
When both Lion Guards are tied and the last position during the contest is the Fiercest between Kion and Vitani in a plan for a Mashindano against both leaders, Kion tells her to know about the leader of the Lion Guard with or without the Roar to which he then remembers that Askari told him that only one who is planning to let go of it completely can truly master the power of the roar as he decides to cancel the Mashindano between Kion and Vitani. Kion tells the Pridelanders about what Askari said to him to which he tells them that Vitani has won against Kion's Lion Guard and is the Pride Lands' new Lion Guard. Upon letting go of the Roar, Askari appears in the sky and praises Kion for finally mastering the power of the roar (also causing the marks of the Lion Guard on all of Kion's members to disappear).

Askari then speaks to Kion with all of the members of his Guard and other Pridelanders watching. Kion asks if he's no longer the leader of the Lion Guard why would he need the Roar to which Askari says that there is one place that needs the Roar. Kion and the rest of the members of his guard go back to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] (the place that needs the Roar according to Askari) and join the Night Pride. His spirit appears again at Kion's coronation as King of the Tree of Life after marrying Rani, alongside Mufasa and Janna just as the Roar of the Elders roar in triumph.

==Trivia==
*Askari means "police", "guard" or "soldier" in Swahili.
*Askari's indirect descendant, [[Scar]], was originally named after him before he acquired his facial wound. This is confirmed by series producer Ford Riley, as "Askari" is Scar's birth name in the canon material.
**In the non-canonical book series ''[[The Lion King: Six New Adventures]]'', Taka is Scar's birth name.
**In the Upcoming Prequel for the 2019 Lion King, Scar's name is Taka, as seen in the books, and not Askari, as seen in The Lion Guard.
