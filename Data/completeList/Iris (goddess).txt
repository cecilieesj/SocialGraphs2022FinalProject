===Physical appearance===
Iris appears as a light-skinned woman wearing a golden crown and a light blue strap dress. She is enveloped by a rainbow, with her purple hair making up the top stripe. Coming down from her hair, the blue and the green stripes seem to be attached to her back, trailing behind her. She carries the yellow stripe in her right hand, pulling it across the sky. In her left hand, she holds the orange and red stripes. They flow across her skirt and trail behind her.

==Role in the film==
Iris' only appearance is when she makes a beautiful rainbow after a storm that Zeus and [[Vulcan]] caused.

==Trivia==
*Iris is the goddess' Greek name. In Rome, she is called Arcus.
*The rainbow's colors are inverted, with red on the bottom and violet on top, instead of the other way around.
