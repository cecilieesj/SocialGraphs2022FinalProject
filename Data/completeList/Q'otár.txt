== History ==
Q'otár the Thunder-Bird was a condor-like spirit revered by the [[Arbori]] tribe of Adventure Isle as guardian of the skies and the heaven realm of Mayu.  The Arbori built a celestial observatory in tribute to Q'otár with Q'otár reciprocating the gesture by giving shamans of the Arbori the powers to shapeshift into different animals.

== Appearances ==

=== Adventure Isle ===
Art depicting Q'otár can be found throughout Adventure Isle, including over the gates to the land.

=== [[Soarin'|Soaring over the Horizon]] ===
Soaring over the Horizon is themed to the shamans of the Arbori connecting guests to the spirit of Q'otár.  The framing device of guests traveling the world in such a short period of time is rationalized by guests entering Q'otár's realm of Mayu.
