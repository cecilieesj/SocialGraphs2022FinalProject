'''Tookie Tookie''' is the third tritagonist of Disney's ''[[George of the Jungle]]''. He is George's loyal toucan messenger and alerts him with his call, "Awk awk, Eek Eek, Tookie Tookie!"

==Trivia==
*One of the trailers for the first movie showed Tookie taking a plane, but that scene was cut from this movie and moved to the sequel, [[George of the Jungle 2]] as a thought Tookie had as he flew past a plane.
*Like most of the animals in both films, toucans like Tookie aren't actually found in Africa (they live in the Neotropics).
*In the original cartoon, Tookie Tookie's bird species was never actually identified and he was purple in color.
