'''Scats''' is a character featured in the extinct [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]]".

==History==

===Background===
Scats serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the former Japan-exclusive incarnation  of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, he and the other four emcee birds create a plan to wake up the Tikis by playing various songs to wake up. After some failed attempts, they finally wake up after [[Lava (Enchanted Tiki Room)|Lava]] performs the musical number "Fever" with the [[Tiki Totem Poles]] to which the [[Tiki Room Drummers|Tiki Drummers]] suddenly start being active. After this, he and the other emcee birds celebrate together just before guests leave the attraction.

===Development History===
The Tiki Room attraction at Tokyo Disneyland originally opened as a Japanese version of the original show featuring the original emcee birds [[Jos√©]], [[Michael]], [[Pierre]], and [[Fritz]]. The attraction closed in Tokyo in [[1999]] and was rethemed as "Get the Fever!"  which opened in that same year where the four original emcee birds were removed and were replaced by Scats, Danno, Lava, and Buddy with the attraction having a different storyline compared to the original incarnation.

"Get the Fever!" closed in early [[2008]] and was later reopened as "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]" where the hosts from the "Get the Fever!" incarnation were replaced by four new emcee bird hosts: Manu, Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli.

==Role in the attraction==
During the show, Scats is introduced by the announcer during intro number "[[The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room]]" alongside Danno, Lava, and Buddy to which after singing to the guests that the Tiki Room is having a long slumber where he and the other emcee bird hosts encourage the guests to clap along to wake up the Tikis during the musical number "In the Tiki Room" (sung to the tune of "[[Wikipedia:In the Summertime|In the Summertime]]. However, when [[Lava (Enchanted Tiki Room)|Lava]] begins the musical number "[[Hot, Hot, Hot]]", Scats and the other emcee birds partcipate with the [[Showgirl Birds]] where they all sing together. Later, Scats tells the Showgirl Birds that he is available after the show explaining to them to know who wants to be the first to visit his perch to which the Showgirl Birds find no interest in him. Despite this, the attempt to wake up the Tikis was unsuccessful.

Losing hope that the Tikis would never wake up, Lava then tells the other emcee birds about her plan to wake up the Tikis in which the Totem Poles from the attraction join in with her singing and while singing, the plan to wake them up was successful. After the plan to wake up the Tikis was successful, Scats and the other birds celebrate with the other Tiki Room birds with a special rendition of "[[I Wan'na Be Like You]]" just before he and the other emcee birds bid a farewell to the guests.
