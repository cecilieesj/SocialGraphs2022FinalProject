'''The Missile''' is one of the major villains from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''.

==Role in the film==
The Missile was created by the [[Supreme Commander]] and set to destroy the Earth, as he (secretly) despised all human beings due to their abusive nature to the [[Wonder Luxe Appliances]]. However, when the ex-Supreme Commander reforms after the election between him and [[Toaster]] for title of Supreme Commander, he reveals himself to be the [[Hearing Aid]]'s long-lost twin brother. After their reunion, the ex-Supreme Commander travels back to Earth with [[Tinselina]], Toaster, and the others, but their launch is halted when Toaster and the ex-Supreme Commander have to jump off to stop the Missile from destroying the Earth when he was formerly in charge, as the ex-Supreme Commander forgot to deactivate the rocket after Toaster had convinced him to do so, and is the only one who knows the abort code. The ex-Supreme Commander succeeds in deactivating the Missile in the nick of time, and the rocket collapses. He and Toaster are then rescued by the others.

==Trivia==
*Although the Missile is depicted with a mouth, he never speaks. It is unknown if he was meant to be anthropomorphized, like the other machines in the movie.
*The Missile's face greatly resembles [[w:c:mario:Banzai Bill|Banzai Bill]] from the ''{{WikipediaLink|Super Mario}}'' game series.
