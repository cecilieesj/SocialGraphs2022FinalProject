'''Meredith Quill''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who is the mother of [[Star-Lord]].

Meredith Quill was created by Bill Mantlo, Steve Englehart and Gray Morrow.

==[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]==
In 1980, she fell in love with [[Ego the Living Planet]], and conceived a son with him, Peter. However, Ego gave her a brain tumor that ended up killing her because she was an obstacle in his plans of universal conquest. Years later, the adult Peter, having become the superhero Star-Lord, avenges Meredith by killing Ego and foiling his plans.

She is kind, gentle, and loving, and her memory inspires Star-Lord to protect the innocent and vanquish the forces of evil.
