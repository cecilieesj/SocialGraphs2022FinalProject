==Background==
===Personality===
Stinger tries to prove himself as a competitive racer, which is what he did in his race with [[Lightning McQueen]]. He is not much of a speaker, though his way of communicating is by revving his engine.

===Physical appearance===
Stinger has an orange livery, and blue eyes, plus his hood is painted black. Being a muscle car, he sports a raised spoiler, and is based on a [[2009]] Dodge Challenger. His license plate reads his entire name, "STINGER".

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars: Race-O-Rama]]''===
Having plans to beat Lightning McQueen in the Race-O-Rama series, Chick Hicks volunteers Stinger to participate in a race taking place in Motoropolis City. However, as hard as he tries, Stinger cannot win the race, and Chick is frustrated to have another one of his protégés fail him, insulting him by calling him a "steel brain of a worthless bucket of bolts!" In response, Stinger angrily revs his engine, and soon leaves after Chick asks him what he has got to say for himself.

Soon, Stinger, [[Candice]], and El Machismo all make an apology to McQueen, saying that they should not have treated him badly. McQueen accepts, giving them the opportunity to pay a visit to the Doc Hudson Racing Academy. To thank him, Stinger revs his engine as usual, which Candice regards being gratefulness.
