|affiliations=}}'''Queen Moon Butterfly''' is a supporting character in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''. She is the former Queen of the [[Mewni]] alongside her husband, [[River Butterfly]], and [[Star Butterfly]]'s mother. She was the previous wielder of the [[Royal Magic Wand]] before passing it down to her daughter on her fourteenth birthday.

==Background==
===Personality===
Queen Butterfly is serious most of the time, having a low tolerance for anything messy or destructive. Despite being the queen, Queen Butterfly acts as the true ruling monarch of Mewni and always has the well-being of her kingdom in mind, to the point she is unable to express interest in anything else. This often causes her to appear cold toward others. Despite her overbearing strictness, she truly loves and cares for her daughter.

In her youth, Moon used to be just like her daughter, a "Happy go-lucky girl", but after [[Toffee]] killed her mother and she inherited the throne, she became serious and mature to protect her kingdom and family.

===Physical Appearance===
Queen Butterfly has a slender figure and taller than her husband. She has long pale blue hair with three bangs that resembles her daughter's, often shaped in a heart. She has blue eyes, wears pink lipstick, and purple diamonds on her cheeks. She wears a golden crown with a purple diamond in the center. Her royal outfit includes a light blue and periwinkle gown, the skirt somewhat resembling the shape of a heart, with long blue gloves.

From "[[Mr. Candle Cares]]" till Season 3, Queen Butterfly had slightly altered her look; her crown now has a gold diamond-shaped attachment with a purple diamond in the center, from which two strings of pearls curl around the sides of her hair. Her ears are visible, and wears gold diamond-shaped earrings with purple diamonds embedded in them. She now wears purple lipstick.

In her [[Mewberty (process)|Mewberty]] form, Moon has large butterfly-like wings and six arms.

After letting go of her role of being queen in "[[Moon Remembers]]" onward, her hair style is changed to a long braid and wears a short sleeved sky blue dress.

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Royal Magic Wand''': Moon Butterfly was once the owner of the royal magic wand, and she once used it to permanently sever one of Toffee's fingers.
*'''Mewberty form''': Moon can change into her Mewberty form at will. She has blue skin, six arms, and large butterfly wings capable of flight.
*'''Inherent magic''': As a queen of Mewni, Moon has magic deep within her body that she can access by "dipping down". With this reservoir of magic power, she can fire energy from her hands and create magical constructs such as whips, barriers and energy swords.
*'''Swordsmanship''': Moon has proven to be proficient with both regular swords and energy swords created with her magic.
*'''Telekinesis''': In "[[The Bogbeast of Boggabah]]", Moon levitates Star off the ground. In "[[Tough Love]]", she levitates mud and large boulders.
*'''Baking''': "[[Butterfly Follies]]" and "[[Escape from the Pie Folk]]" show that Moon has a talent for making pies.

==Role in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]]==
===Backstory===
As established in ''[[The Battle for Mewni]]'' episode "Moon the Undaunted", Moon Butterfly is the daughter of Comet who was killed by [[Toffee]] while trying to bring peace between Mewmans and monsters. Moon found herself in a difficult position as she was ill-equipped and unprepared for the dangers she would need to lead her people into. Everyone from the Magic High Commission to her fellow rulers had not faith in her, except for a young warrior named [[River Butterfly|River Johansen]], whom she would favor romantically. Realizing that she has no other choice, she turns to the imprisoned [[Eclipsa Butterfly]] for knowledge on the forbidden chapter within the [[Magic Instruction Book]]. With her newfound abilities, she frightens Toffee into ending his attack by blowing off his finger with a dark spell; leaving him unable to grow it back. Now confident in her abilities, Moon begins to rule [[Mewni]] without fear of monsters.

===Season One===
At the beginning of the series, Moon and River's excitable daughter [[Star Butterfly]] inherits the [[Royal Magic Wand]], but does not know how to properly use it. Rather than send her to [[St. Olga's Reform School for Wayward Princesses]], they opt to send her to Earth as a foreign exchange student (paying off Principal Skeeves to have her attend [[Echo Creek Academy]]) and having her live with [[Marco Diaz]] and [[Mr. and Mrs. Diaz|his family]]. Moon spends much of the first season remaining in Mewni and calling her daughter for updates on her status. Additionally in "[[Diaz Family Vacation]]", not only is she unaware of the trouble Star gets into, she is also does not seem to realize that her husband River has resorted to sneaking away to have fun without her. In "[[Storm the Castle]]", Moon and her husband learn about Star's run in with Toffee and grow concerned when they see that the Royal Magic Wand has cracked in half.

===Season Two===
When Star begins to dig deeper into the secrets of the wand, as well as her family background, Moon begins to take on a protective stance against her. She starts displaying more dominance as a ruler than last season such as in "[[Game of Flags]]" where she displays her ability to transform into a butterfly creature. Furthermore, she takes the initiative when it is discovered that someone is siphoning magic and insists that [[Glossaryck]] speed up Star's training, but he refuses because she and her daughter are too different. In "[[Raid the Cave]]", Moon and River learn that Star lost the [[Magic Instruction Book]] to [[Ludo]], but they decide to keep it a secret. However, Moon proceeds to hire a magic expert named Baby, against River's wishes, to examine how well Star is doing. To her surprise, Star is not only very competent with her spell, but she is just as powerful as Eclipsa.

Things come to a head when Moon takes it upon herself to see what Ludo is up to. Knowing something is wrong, she meets with his family who are in dire straights. The former King and Queen resent their eldest for kicking them out of their castle and chasing an empty dream, but she meets the youngest, and ironically tallest child, Dennis who wants her to help Ludo. She is forced to return to Mewni for Star's song day, but is horrified when the song reveals personal information that was meant to be a secret to the Mewmans. In "[[Starcrushed]]", Moon confronts Ludo who is revealed to be possessed by Toffee, who takes control of the little tyrant and battles her. Even with the Magic High Commission, they are no match as [[Lekmet]] parishes during the fight. Running out of ideas and time, Moon goes to Earth to recruit Star to help her; pulling her away just as she admits her feelings to Marco.

===Season Three===
Moon hastily drags Star back to Mewni where they hide in an abandoned sanctuary that has been affected by "the fritz"; resulting in the healing waters being black and slimy. Moon, not wanting to put her daughter in jeopardy, insists that they remain in hiding before telling her her history with Eclipsa and Toffee. With no other option, they run and hide at [[Buff Frog]]'s house where Moon is forced to get over her prejudice of monsters; something that ends up backfiring on Star as they both forbid her from confronting Toffee, though Buff Frog's [[Buff Frog's Tadpoles|children]] help her escape. They later help Marco break out of prison before helping Star with confronting Toffee and defeating him for good. Moon reunites with River before she goes to check on a frozen Eclipsa, though she is oblivious to her breaking free.

Moon attempts to resume her queenly duties, with River by her side, but things begin to change with the return of [[Glossaryck]] who "died" and a now free Eclipsa. While Star trusts her, Moon insists that she is evil due to her abandoning her kingdom to marry a monster. She soon grows frustrated with her newfound position, but finds herself teaming up with Eclipsa to discover what happened to her daughter [[Meteora Butterfly|Meteora]] and learn that the Magic High Commission has not been honest with them. This culminates in the episode "[[Butterfly Trap]]" where Moon, Star and Eclipsa out the Magic High Commission's botched effort in hiding her daughter, as well as the revelation that Moon and Star are not related to Eclipsa.

Miss Heinous is revealed to be Meteora and transforms into a giant monster. Moon tries to fight her in her butterfly form, but is injured and hides in the magic realm. In the two parter "[[Divide]]" and "[[Conquer]]", Moon stays in the magic realm for too long and loses her memory before encountering Star. The two of them stay there and proceed to play in the waters before examining the portals to different dimensions. They encounter a unicorn who banishes them from the realm; sending Star back to Mewni and Moon to places unknown.

===Season Four===
In "[[Escape from the Pie Folk]]", Moon is revealed to have ended up on the Island of the Pie Folk, with no memory of her past life other than that she liked baking pies. In another revelation, Moon and Star are revealed to have been descended from Pie Folk, something that River lambasts. She is rescued and returns to Mewni where she and the newly appointed Queen Eclipsa bond. However her memories of [[Globgor]], Eclipsa's monster husband, affect her and she decides to live in the forest with River. Moon and River have to put up with their rather inept former people who were kicked out of their homes after it became apparent that they were living in forcibly acquired monster homes. They decide to teach the Mewmans how to build a new society and be more independent.

Moon starts to think more about herself, which she actually begins to enjoy. In order to help the relocated Mewmans, she goes to the old castle to get her day planner and encounters [[Mina Loveberry]] who not only still has a hatred for monsters, but wants to restart the Solarian Soldier program. Moon leaves and decides to think nothing of it. Later, she attends Eclipsa's coronation, or ''corn''onation as Star puts it, rather reluctantly. Following Globgor's freedom, which is due to [[Rhombulus]] freeing him in an effort to prove that he and Eclipsa were evil, Moon finally stands up to her former people by telling them to stop listening to her and think for themselves for once; resulting in everyone finally accepting Eclipsa and Globgor as queen and king. Moon continues to live in the woods with River; satisfied with her life.

In a final confrontation, Mina attacks the kingdom in an effort to dethrone Eclipsa. It is revealed that Moon planned the whole thing as she still has not forgiven Eclipsa for all the trouble she has caused and wants things to end peacefully, as Globgor has been injured by a Solarian blade and needs attention. However, Mina backstabs Moon and she, Star, Marco, Janna and Eclipsa are forced to flee where they are rescued by [[Hekapoo]]. Eclipsa reveals that she deduced that Moon also convinced Rhombulus to free Globgor to make them look bad, but that it backfired on her. Realizing that she had committed more harm than good, Moon, along with Eclipsa, help Star with getting rid of the magic in the magic realm; resulting in Mina getting defeated and everyone sent back to their proper dimension. Moon finally apologizes for all she has done; improving her relationship with her daughter.
