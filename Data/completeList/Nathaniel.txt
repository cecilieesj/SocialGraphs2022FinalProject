'''Nathaniel''' is the former secondary antagonist and [[Queen Narissa]]'s former henchman in Disney's [[2007]] feature film ''[[Enchanted]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
In the beginning, Nathaniel is shown to be insecure and have very low self-esteem at the beginning of the film, having almost no respect or regard for himself, and only doing as [[Queen Narissa]] ordered him to do. He was infatuated with her, always putting her before even himself, and even willing to participate in her evil plans to make her happy. Narissa would usually bribe him into doing her wishes by falsely promising a happily ever after for him with herself, but as Nathaniel unintentionally failed to please her, she began to show her true colors.

After seeing a short portion of a television show, Nathaniel came to realize how little he likes himself and begins to think that there is another side to Queen Narissa. And after being mistreated by her once again, he realizes his mistakes (and that Narissa was manipulating him the whole time) and reveals both her plan and his involvement in it. Though Narissa’s actions made him very unhappy, he uses all these new feelings, along with the old ones to write a book, which many people liked, allowing him to have a happy ending of his own.

==Role in the film==
Nathaniel is an insecure man who was hired by [[Queen Narissa|Queen Nerissa]] to ensure that [[Prince Edward]] would never meet a girl with whom he would share true love's kiss. He did so by constantly setting trolls loose on the kingdom for Edward to vanquish.

One particular day, he set loose a large troll, which Edward did best. However, after hearing [[Giselle]]'s singing, Edward rode on to find her. A dismayed Nathaniel freed the troll to foil Edward. After a battle, the troll was stopped, and Edward met Giselle, both ready to be married the following morning.

After learning of this, Narissa comes up with a plan to get rid of Giselle. She puts Nathaniel in charge of making sure Giselle gets to the castle safely, so she could transport her to New York, a place where there is no "happily ever afters."

After Pip tells Prince Edward what happened to Giselle, Narissa watches both of them to make sure they didn't meet. Meanwhile, Nathaniel is made to work in her gardens, trimming hedges.

Under Narissa's orders, he follows [[Prince Edward]] to New York City, and, while trying to make sure Edward didn't listen to [[Pip]]'s warnings, leads him away from [[Giselle]] and attempts to kill her with three poisoned apples. Before he could use the last one, Narissa gives up on him and decides to take matters into her own hands by coming to New York and kill Giselle herself.

After watching a soap opera on the television in The Grand Duke Hotel, he realizes how little self-esteem and self-respect he has for himself. He starts to rethink his relationship with the Queen and realizes that even though he has always treated her like a Queen, she has never acted like one. He realizes what a viperous witch she was and reveals her evil plot to Edward at the King and Queen's Ball after Giselle takes a bite from the last poisoned apple.

In the end, Nathaniel remains in New York, where he writes a bestselling autobiography entitled ''My Royal Pain: Vanquishing the Evil Queen Within'' and lives happily ever after.

==Trivia==
* Nathaniel acts as a foil to Robert. Robert is smart enough not to allow a woman to manipulate him with her good looks, but marries Giselle when he realizes that she truly has his best interests in heart. Nathaniel himself eventually realizes that Narissa is using him, however.
*He doesn't return in the sequel, [[Disenchanted]]. This is most probably due to the fact that he stays in New York, while Giselle and her family move out of the city.
