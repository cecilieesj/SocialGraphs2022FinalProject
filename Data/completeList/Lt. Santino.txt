'''Lt. Santino''' is a supporting character in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]/[[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]]'s [[1988]] hybrid film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. He is an L.A.P.D. detective lieutenant and friend of detective [[Eddie Valiant]].

==Role in the film==
Following the night [[Marvin Acme]] is murdered, Santino visits Eddie at his office and scolds him for taking R.K. Maroon’s job of invading Acme’s privacy to take pictures of him playing patty cake with Jessica Rabbit stating he would’ve given him money if he needed it so bad before he tells him of what happened and how Roger Rabbit is the prime suspect. Later, they both visit the crime scene at the Acme warehouse, where they meet with [[Judge Doom]]. Santino informs Eddie of Doom's background when he bought the election to become the presiding jurist of [[Toontown (Who Framed Roger Rabbit)|Toontown]]. They both also witness a demonstration of the [[Dip]]'s effect on a [[Toon]], as Doom maliciously melts an innocent Toon shoe.

Santino isn't seen until after the climax of the film. At the warehouse, he and the police learn it was really Doom, who not only murdered Acme but [[R.K. Maroon]] and Teddy Valiant as well. He's then given the rope to the safe that was dropped on Acme as Eddie speculates that the dried paint found on it matches that of [[Roger Rabbit|Roger]]'s glove. With all of this, Roger is cleared of the murder charge and his innocence is proven.

==Relationships==
===[[Eddie Valiant]]===
Hardly anything is known of his history with Eddie, but it can be presumed they've probably known each other during their respective tenures in the police force, prior to the events of the film. Though he carries a stiff demeanor, he looks out for Eddie as he's concerned about his alcoholism and disapproves of his improper conduct toward any superiors.
