'''Sir Francis Tremaine''' was the first late husband of [[Lady Tremaine]], and the biological father of [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Cinderella (2015 film)|Cinderella]]''===
According to Lady Tremaine, she and Francis had married for love, and she even viewed him as the light of her life. He was the Master of the Mercer's Guild and knew [[Cinderella's Father|Ella's father]] briefly. It was through this acquaintance that Ella's father learned of his death later on, and in turn, led him to ask for the widowed Lady Tremaine's hand in marriage. Francis' death was one of the most prominent factors as to why she was so bitter, mercenary, and easily jealous.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
One night, the starving Tremaine family is traveling through the forest. Desperate for food and because Francis is sick, Anastasia and Drizella sneak out for food.

Francis gifts Lady Tremaine with a locket and both lockets glow as a symbol of their love for each other so they can always find one another.

Francis Tremaine and Lady Tremaine continue to raise Anastasia and Drizella, Anastasia refuses the offer, until Drizella's birthday party, in which she acts all jealous. Anastasia's heart becomes cursed, prompting her to run away to [[Wonderland|the woods]] to protect them from her. He uses his locket to track her to the woods, but before he can go in, his locket stops glowing. Francis then gives up on finding her, out of the belief she has stopped loving him and changes because of losing her.

Later, Francis eventually comes back with the locket  while continuing to raise Drizella. One day, as they are building a snowman, his hat flies onto the ice and Drizella goes to retrieve it, not noticing the ice cracking beneath her. Anastasia goes out to warn her and the ice breaks, taking them underneath the freezing water. Francis dives in after them and retrieves them. Lady Tremaine becomes angry with him for nearly allowing them to drown. After much CPR they are revived.

As she eventually becomes known as Lady Tremaine, she grows bitter with Francis over the incident and goes on to conspire with a [[Prince Charming|prince]] to murder him, resulting in his death. Anastasia and Drizella, not knowing her involvement in his death, vow revenge on the prince but later finds out the truth from [[Tiana]].

==Trivia==
*The mention of his name contradicts the information given previously in the ''Disney Villains: Top Secret Files'', which had stated that he's Anastasia's and Drizella's father's last name was "Tremaine".
