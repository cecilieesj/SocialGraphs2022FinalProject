'''Specter''' is a character in the [[2020]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Onward]]'' who serves as a cyclops cop for the city of [[New Mushroomton]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Specter tries to be intimidating to get answers out of Bronco (who was actually a magical disguise concealing Ian and Barley) but after realizing that he was stressed out, she figures that he must be stressed over his issues with trying to bond with [[Laurel Lightfoot|Laurel]]'s sons, Ian and Barley. Specter sympathizes with this by claiming she's going through the same thing with her girlfriend's daughter.

She's observant after seeing "Colt's" hoofprints in the dirt become shoeprints and contacted her police station to confirm Colt's whereabouts.

===Physical Appearance===
Specter is the tallest out of all the three cops, she's purple-colored and has a large nose, an eye, and a horn.

==Role in the film==
Specter and [[Gore]] are first seen where they catch [[Ian Lightfoot|Ian]] and [[Barley Lightfoot]] for speeding while on their way to get to Raven's Point to find the [[Phoenix Gem]]. In order to avoid getting caught, Ian and Barley disguise themselves as [[Colt Bronco]] using a Disguise Spell in order to avoid getting arrested to which they successfully evade them when Ian starts freaking out and getting nervous she lets them go and turns left then right for some weird reason. She, Gore, and Colt are later seen during the climax of the film where they chase Ian and Barley again while Barley sacrifices his van Guinevere in order to avoid getting caught.

Specter's further fate is unknown after magic is brought back to New Mushroomton once again after Ian finishes restoring the full body of his late father before he fades away, though she is seen arriving at the scene of Barley trespassing on the to-be-demolished fountain, in search for the phoenix gem.

==Trivia==
*Because of her sexual orientation, the film was banned in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. However, it was still released in other Arab countries like Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates, albeit the line was censored in the Arabic dub to "my <u>sister's daughter</u>". In [[Russia]], where [[Wikipedia:Russian gay propaganda law|a law prohibits the dissemination of LGBT content to minors]], the Russian dub censored Specter's line to "my <u>partner's daughter</u>" and avoided referring to her with gender-specific pronouns. The line was also censored in the Albanian, Hungarian and Polish dubs, too.
**She is [[Pixar]]'s first LGBT character. The second is [[Greg (Out)|Greg]] from ''[[Out]]''.
**Disney now has LGBT characters in all of their major branches (the [[Disney Animated Canon]] has [[Bucky and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson|Bucky and Pronk]], ''[[Star Wars]]'' has Moff Mors and [[Aphra]], and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has [[Valkyrie]] and [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]]).
*Her name is a portmanteau of "Spectre", an English synonym for ghosts or apparitions.
*Specter's voice actress, [[Lena Waithe]], is openly lesbian in real life. 
**Waithe improvised Specter's mentioning of her girlfriend.
