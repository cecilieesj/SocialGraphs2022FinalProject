'''Sitka''' is the oldest brother of [[Denahi]] and [[Kenai]] and parental figure to them in the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2003]] animated feature film, ''[[Brother Bear]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Brother Bear]]''===
Sitka loves his younger brothers and would do anything for them, the movie begins with Kenai's coming of age ceremony where each tribe member receives an animal totem which represents their personalities and he happens to be a bear, which he hates because they steal food from them and Denahi teases him for it, angering him. Sitka then tells Kenai of his own ceremony and how his totem is the eagle, which represents leadership and guidance. Moments later, they find that a [[Koda's mother|bear]] has stolen some fish from them because Kenai didn't secure the ropes on the basket and he recklessly goes after the bear. Sitka and Denahi follow him to make sure he doesn't end up getting killed.

Kenai is knocked to the ground and Denahi defends him, but the bear knocks the spear out of his hands and it looks like it's over for them when Sitka, deciding there is no other option, stabs the ice around the bear with his spear, causing the ice to crack and break off, causing the bear to fall with him. Kenai and Denahi search for him, but only find his coat, spear, and totem and his spirit assumes the form of a bald eagle

Later that night, a funeral is held for Sitka, and Kenai is enraged that the bear lived while Sitka died. Holding the bear responsible for what happened, so he goes out to kill it to avenge Sitka. After a battle which he succeeds, the spirits appear before him along with a bald eagle that morphs into Sitka in an ethereal form. He then approaches Kenai and is very disappointed in his brother's actions. Aware that it wasn't necessary for Kenai to kill the bear because he (Sitka) willingly gave his life to protect his brothers, Sitka punishes Kenai by turning him into a bear, in an effort to change his perspective and get over his hatred of bears.

Thinking the bear killed Kenai, Denahi decides to avenge his death and tracks him down. Kenai manages to escape and meets the deceased bear's cub, [[Koda]]. Kenai finds Koda annoying at first, but eventually grows to love him and feels guilty after learning that he is the son of the bear he killed.

At the end of the movie, upon seeing Kenai nearly give his life for Koda, Sitka decides to change him back into a human and visits him and Denahi in his human form. Knowing that Koda is motherless because of him, Kenai wishes to be a bear again and stay with Koda. Sitka turns Kenai back into a bear and hugs both of his brothers goodbye, then he and Koda's mother (who briefly reunites with Koda) return to the afterlife.

===''[[Brother Bear 2]]''===
He does make a cameo in his eagle form near the end of ''Brother Bear 2'' when the Great Spirits transform Nita into a bear so she can be with Kenai and Koda (mainly Kenai).
