The '''Mother Rabbit''' is a character featured in the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
The Mother Rabbit and her children are a family of rabbits who are seen waiting behind a window looking for the Wanderin' Boy, the missing son. She appears briefly during the attraction's third act singing "Down in the Licensed Saloon" where she sadly sings about her hopes for her missing son, the Wanderin' Boy, hoping he comes home right away. During the song, the bunnies listen to their mother's singing about her hopes for one of her missing sons to return.

===Development History===
The Mother Rabbit was created in the former [[America Sings]] attraction which was created for the [[America Sings]] attraction at [[Disneyland]] in the [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] section where he was placed in the "Heading West" sequence where he sings the song, "[[Home on the Range (song)|Home on the Range]]", which opened on [[June 29]], [[1974]]. However, America Sings closed on [[April 10]], [[1988]] in order to retheme the attraction to [[Innoventions]], with the rabbit family and most of the animatronics moved to [[Splash Mountain]] at the [[Critter Country (Disneyland)|Critter Country]] section, which opened on [[July 17]], [[1989]].

As of [[2020]] Splash Mountain is slated for closure in order to retheme the attraction into a ''[[The Princess and the Frog|Princess and the Frog]]''-[[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|inspired attraction]] in order to remove references to ''[[Song of the South]]'', due to outdated cultural depictions from the film itself which the attraction is based on. Thus, it is currently unknown of what will replace the rabbit family in the rethemed version of the attraction.

==Appearances==

===[[America Sings]]===
The Mother Rabbit is encountered during the attraction's third act "The Gay Nineties" where she is seen during the song "Down in the Licensed Saloon". Throughout the song, she sings in a sad tune about her hopes for her missing son to come home. Just as she sings, a silhouette of a rabbit a (presumably the Wanderin' Boy) on a window while the Mother Rabbit holds a candle whlie singing about her missing son. After the act, it loops into [[Sam the Eagle (America Sings)|Sam]] and [[Ollie the Owl|Ollie]] listening to a showgirl pig singing "(Won't You Come Home) Bill Bailey".

===[[Splash Mountain]]===
Exclusive to the California version of the attraction, the Mother Rabbit and her children are encountered during the final sequence along with a [[Plaintive Possum|mother possum]] and her offspring. Originally in the attraction, she originally sung "[[Sooner or Later (Song of the South)|Sooner or Later]]" but later refurbishments replace that song with "[[Burrow's Lament]]" where both mothers sing to their offspring about [[Br'er Rabbit]] being held hostage by [[Br'er Fox]] about the Laughing Place. The next seen where Br'er Rabbit appears is where he is shown to have escaped from Br'er Fox and [[Br'er Bear]] respectively
