However, Robin Hood and Little John manage to escape the Wolf Archers.

The Wolf Arrowmen are later seen chasing after the innocent citizens of [[Nottingham]] after an archery tournament went awry, due to [[Prince John]] being thwarted by Little John when the former attempted to behead Robin Hood after hearing him talk about [[King Richard]] being the rightful king. A number of Wolf Archers can be seen relentlessly pursuing [[Maid Marian]]. She calls out for Robin Hood's help and is heroically rescued by him.
