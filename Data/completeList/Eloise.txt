}}'''Eloise''' is a minor character from the [[1960]] animated short, ''[[Goliath II]]''.

==Role in the film==
Eloise is first seen walking until she nearly steps on [[Goliath II (character)|Goliath II]] if not for [[Goliath II's mother|his mother]] warning her. The minute she calls her a clumsy ox, Eloise replies: "Now, don't you "clumsy ox" me. I can't watch out for your precious little brat. That's your worry. If you think I'm gonna pussyfoot around the rest of my life just because..." until she is interrupted when Goliath II's mother shouts while calling and warning her son who is unknowingly heading for [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|a hungry crocodile]] while playing with a butterfly. Luckily, she manages to save her son just in time before the crocodile can snap his prey while stating: "Oh, Goliath, what on earth will I ever do?". Eloise isn't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this. It can be assumed that she just joined the rest of the elephant herd along the rest of the way and that at the end, she accepted Goliath II as a hero and a member of the herd after triumphing over a [[Mouse (Goliath II)|mouse]].

==Trivia==
*[[Circus Elephants|Elephant Matriarch]] was an inspiration for Eloise's creation, appearance, and personality. In return, Eloise also served as an inspiration for the creation of [[Winifred]] from [[The Jungle Book]].
