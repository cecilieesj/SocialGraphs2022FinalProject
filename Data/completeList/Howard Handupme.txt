'''Howard Handupme''' is the solemn [[Walter Cronkite]]-esque newscaster on ''[[Dinosaurs]]''. His punning surname refers to his existence as a hand puppet, never seen except from behind a newsdesk or with his lower half otherwise concealed.

Handupme is the primary anchor for [[DNN]] news and provides expository commentary on such key events as the [[Al "Sexual" Harris]] hearings, the war with the four-leggers and [[the Chief Elder]] election.

Handupme delivers the solemn last line in the final episode, "Changing Nature": "This is Howard Handupme saying good night. Goodbye."

Howard Handupme was performed by [[Kevin Clash]].
