==History==
Nakasumi is the head of a company that makes toys and the fastest video game system on the market, the Z-board. Nakasumi designs the toys himself, most notably the Z-boy mascot. Nakasumi is known for speaking in whispers and always has his translator [[Kyoko Yoshiko]] by his side to aid him. [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] helped Nakasumi after [[Dr. Drakken]] stole his video game factory to build a giant robot. Kim would help him a second time in ''So the Drama'' when [[Shego]] attempted to kidnap him.
