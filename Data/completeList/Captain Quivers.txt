==Personality==
Quivers isn't your typical pirate. He has a reputation for being misguided, forgetful and rather literal-minded. He also tends to get his words mixed up. Quivers and his crew are so incompetent that they constantly get themselves lost. Quivers' goal is to find the Golden Maiden of the 17 Seas (a magical ship bow ornament that guides a ship wherever its captain wants to go). Quivers believes that once he finds the Maiden, he and his crew will no longer have any risk of getting lost at sea.

==Role in the Series==
He first appears in "[[Pirated Away]]" when Miranda and her daughters sail up to rescue their ship which is stuck on a reef. After his ship gets pulled off, he accidently sinks their ship since he can't understand sailor jorgen. Quivers explains that no matter how hard he and his crew try, they have remained completely incompetent pirates. He states that the answer to his problem is the legendary treasure called the Golden Maiden of the 17 Seas, a magical ornament that has the power to guide pirate ships to wherever the captain chooses to go. However, their complete inexperience has gotten him and his crew absolutely nowhere. Miranda offers to help guide the Captain in finding the Maiden, in exchange of taking her family home once they find it, and Quivers accepts the deal.

Queen Miranda and Princess Sofia figure out the clues after Sofia realizes that Quivers mixed the words up. However, Amber shatters his trust in them when she makes a failed attempt to leave the ship in an unsafe lifeboat. His trust in them is restored when a swordfish attack proves Sofia was right about him mixing the words up. During trek through the Icy Sea, Amber falls off and Miranda goes after her. When Sofia tries to convince Quivers to go back to the Icebergs to rescue her mother and sister, Quivers refuses (mostly out of spite towards Amber for attempting to ditch him), but Sofia tells him that without Miranda and Amber, he'll never be able to find the Golden Maiden, and Quivers relents.

After finally recovering the Maiden, Quivers sails the Royal Family back to [[Enchancia]].
