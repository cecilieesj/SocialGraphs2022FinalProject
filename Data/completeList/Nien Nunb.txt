Quinn returned to the role for the [[2015]] film, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the [[2017]] film, ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', and the [[2019]] film, ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''.

Nien Nunb is an arms dealer of the Sullustan species that joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Three decades later, Nunb is a starfighter pilot in the [[Resistance]] who fought in the First Order–Resistance conflict, including the Battle of [[Starkiller Base]].

==Background==
===Biography===
A jowled, mouse-eyed native of Sullust, Nien Nunb was an arms dealer and smuggler who piloted the Mellcrawler. He also spoke the liquid, chattering tongue of the Sullustans.

After the Battle of [[Yavin 4|Yavin]], he helped [[Princess Leia]] smuggle an enclave of Alderaanian survivors off Sullust and then assisted the princess during the diversionary mission known as Operation Yellow Moon. Later, Nunb served as [[Lando Calrissian]]’s co-pilot aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' during the Battle of [[Endor]]. Nunb also sent support to Leia in the senate upon learning that she was the daughter of [[Darth Vader]].

Thirty years later, Nien flew with the Resistance at the Battle of [[Starkiller Base]], where he helped to destroy the huge superweapon. He also served at the Battle of [[Crait]], piloting a Ski-Speeder. Nunb piloted the ''Tantive IV'' at the Resistance's fight against the [[Sith Eternal]] fleet, the Final Order, during the Battle of [[Exegol]]. While confronting the Final Order, his ship was disabled when [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] shot Force lightning into the air in an attempt to stop the Resistance and their allies from attacking the Sith fleet. Sidious is stopped and killed by Rey but Nunb sadly didn't survive Sidious' attack.
