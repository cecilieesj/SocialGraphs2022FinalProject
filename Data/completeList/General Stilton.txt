}}'''General Stilton''' is a character and antagonist in ''[[The Cat from Outer Space]]''.

==Role in the film==
He is general of the U.S. Army, and almost always accompanied by Colonel Woodruff, Captain Anderson, and Sergeant Duffy. General Stilton was in charge of investigating the mysterious alien spacecraft that landed on Earth that brought [[Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7]]. When the ship is discovered, it is confiscated by the Army and brought to a secret base called "Hopscotch". One soldier wonders if the ship came from Russia, but this is dismissed by General Stilton, who says "don't see no hammer & sickle on the side". He (correctly) believes the craft is extraterrestrial but warns they need to get to the bottom if it as (incorrectly) believing by now "some slimy 12-legged creature could be crawling under the White House".
