====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
Dagger was among the wave of rising young heroes [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] was looking to recruit, however they had no intent with Cloak due to his temperamental attitude. In the episode "Cloak and Dagger", Cloak fell into the control of the demon [[Dormammu]], who used him to kidnap various mystics and brainwash them to help create a portal for his army to invade Earth. After Cloak kidnaps [[Iron Fist]], Dagger joins with [[Spider-Man]] to find him.

They are able to discover Dormammu as the culprit and follow him to his Dark Dimension via [[Doctor Strange]]'s Eye of Agamotto but confront Cloak as resistance from further passing. Spider-Man is able to bring Cloak back using Dagger's light daggers to exonerate Cloak from Dormammu's influence. The three encounter the brainwashed [[White Tiger]], Iron Fist, and Doctor Strange and are forced to fight them; Dagger aids in breaking the spell over them with her powers. But before she can free Doctor Strange, Dormammu arrives and attacks them, forcing them on the retreat. Fortunately, Cloak uses his powers to help Dagger get close enough and frees Doctor Strange, who then helps the group escape the castle with Dormammu on their trail.

Cloak offers to get everyone safely back to Earth despite Dagger's worry, but when everyone escapes through, he is halted from teleporting himself by Dormammu, causing him to become trapped between two dimensions and allowing Dormammu access. Spider-Man dons the Eye of Agamotto to temporarily incapacitate the demon while Doctor Strange banishes Dormammu back to his dimension. Spider-Man offers the two to join S.H.I.E.L.D., although the two state they will consider it. After departing, they are revealed to be working for [[Taskmaster]] who took them in and gave them shelter beforehand, and makes them turn against the notion of joining S.H.I.E.L.D.

In "New Warriors", they aid Taskmaster as a part of his "Thunderbolts" team in busting out [[Green Goblin]], [[Beetle]], [[Doctor Octopus]], and [[Scorpion]] of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], incapacitating Spider-Man's team and battling against Spider-Man, [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], Amadeus Cho, Ka-Zar, and Zabu in the midst of the endeavor. However, when Cloak is nearly killed by the Helicarrier's fans, Taskmaster leaves him to perish while revealing his manipulation of the two to a disillusioned Dagger and departs them. Spider-Man manages to save Cloak and convinces the two into joining the New Warriors instead, and amend for their actions by defeating and apprehending the escaped supervillains.

====''[[Cloak & Dagger]]''====
The duo are the main characters of the show set in the ''Marvel Cinematic Universe''. Tyrone Johnson and Tandy Bowen are residents of [[New Orleans]] where, after a fateful encounter, they discover that they possess incredible powers when they come in contact with each other.

====''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''====
The characters appeared in the third season, as part of a crossover, with Aubrey Joseph and Olivia Holt reprising their roles. They appear in the episodes "[[Left-Hand Path]]", and "[[Devil's Torture Chamber]]".

Following her discovery of an incantation in the Darkhold, a magical spellbook, [[Nico Minoru]] enacts a spell with her Staff of One, to open a pathway so she can reach her friend who is trapped within the Dark Dimension. As the room fills with a black smoke, Tyrone and Tandy are inadvertently summoned, and question who Nico is, and what she's done.

The trio immediately clash in a series of misunderstandings, as Nico, believes the two to be working for [[Morgan le Fay]]. Tandy threatens to invade her mind, and show her, her deepest hopes, or have Tyrone, show her, her deepest fears. Tyrone explains he brought himself and Tandy to her, because Nico's spell caused a disturbance. Nico mentions a location called the Dark Dimension, and her description matches their previous experience of being trapped within the Loa Dimension, with the group realizing, it is one in the same. As Nico and the duo introduce themselves properly, they reflect on how they were unaware there were other gifted teenagers. Nico recounts the events that lead to their meeting, and Ty tries to dissuade Nico from attempting to return, but upon learning she won't be discouraged, the pair choose to accompany her instead. As they make the decision, Janet appears to them through a monitor, and notifies Nico that the [[The Runaways|Runaways]] being held hostage.

Ty is able to teleport them, to Nico's friends, where they are confronted by Morgan's minions. Tyrone is able to teleport Dale, Victor and Stacey while Tandy uses her powers to protect the group. Morgan's coven members arrive, but Tyrone returns, and teleports them all to the Dark Dimension. The remaining Runaways familiarize themselves with Tyrone and Tandy, and Ty explains that the cost of his powers doesn't allow the group to return back to home immediately, meaning the group are trapped, and the Runaways are powerless. They explore their surroundings, in search for [[Alex Wilder|Alex]], and decide to exit the Dark Dimension's version of the mansion, leading them to a an alternate version of their world, only in ruins and engulfed in smoke and fire. Tandy details her past experience in the Loa Dimnsion, describing it as a place of nightmares, and ponders on whether Alex is still the same. Whilst Tandy explores the dimension, she finds a ballerina slipper, which has her reminisce of her past life and the events that lead to her gaining powers. A van suddenly appears, and the group run in an attempt to escape, but are surrounded by assailants, when a mysterious figure in black creates a barrier between the two parties, and helps them escape. The man reveals himself to be a sorcerer, Quinton the Great, who the Runaways had encountered before, and warns the party of Morgan's upcoming plans. He leads them to the outside of the building, where he believes Alex is imprisoned, and leaves them, to find him. Whilst inside, they hear his scream, but chose to progress forward. [[Chase Stein|Chase]] and Tyrone recall their sporting lives, prior to gaining their powers, while Tandy voices her concerns to Karolina, regrading Nico, and the power she possesses, worried of the possible threat she may hold, and the fact that they're being led blindly. When [[Gert Yorkes|Gert]] is suddenly attacked by a creature who takes the form of her younger sister [[Molly Hernandez|Molly]], Chase comes to her defense, and Tyrone manages to teleport the two before they can get hurt, separating the group.

With Nico determined to reclaim Alex, her and Tandy clash, over a disagreement on what to do next, following the groups seperation. Their argument escalates to Tandy making contact with Nico, and seeing her deepest hope, made up of Nico and Karolina's wedding ceremony, much to her surprise. The purity and goodness of Nico's hope changes Tandy's views on the type of person Nico is, and when Nico accuses her of invading her privacy, she promises not to use her powers on Nico again. As Tandy and [[Karolina Dean|Karolina]] walk together, she notes on their similarities, and how she and Nico manage to balance each other out like light and dark, much like herself and Tyrone.

Meanwhile Ty manages to locate the group that attempted to earlier attack them, and warns Gert and Chase, who all hide away. Fearful for what could be, Gert tries to convince Ty to return her home, but he refuses to do so, without Tandy. When she makes contact with him, she inadvertently activates his powers, and Tyrone witnesses Gert's deepest fears - of being helpless, as her loved ones are attacked. Gert lets go of Ty, and they attempt to hide, as they hear the agents heading towards them. In the midst of hiding away, they accidentally end up in a room, surrounded by another group of agents. Before they can make an escape, Tyrone, is ambushed and separated from them, teleporting away with two of the assailants, instead of Chase and Gert.

Nico manages to locate Chase and Gert through a window, in the opposite building, and creates a bridge of dark smoke, transporting the three girls to their friends. Amidst the chaos, Quinton arrives, and in a trance. Tandy attempts to throw her light daggers into him, but to no prevail, as they simply pass through. Tyrone manages to to return safely to the group, and Quinton disappears in a cloud of smoke, before reappearing, and attacking them individually. Tandy throws one of her daggers to Nico, which turns black in her hand, and their combined powers are able to effectively injure Quinton, who disappears. The group are able to reach Alex, and as Tyrone attempts to teleport them back to Earth, Tandy makes contact with Alex, and sees his deepest hope - gaining the powers of all his friends. Tandy reveals this to the group as they return, but the Runaways refuse dismiss the new darkness in their friend. With their mission completed, Tyrone and Tandy decide to leave. Tandy advises Nico to keep the dagger safe, and Nico thanks her for her assistance, before the two hug. Tyrone apologizes to Gert for previously scaring her, noting she cares for Chase too, and she introduces him to her pet dinosaur, [[Old Lace]], much to his astonishment. The duo say their final goodbyes to the group, with Tandy suggesting they help them, next time, before disappearing in a cloud of black smoke.

In the [[Cheat the Gallows|series finale]], Nico attempts to use the dagger, created by Tandy, to defeat Morgan le Fay.
