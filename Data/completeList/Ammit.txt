'''Ammit''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and one of the main antagonists in ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]''. Much like the [[Asgardians]] are the gods from the Norse pantheon, she is a Crocodile goddess from the Egyptian pantheon. She used to judge souls that were about to enter the afterlife and devoured those not worthy of everlasting peace. However, at some point, she slipped into a more villainous role, killing mortals for crimes they may or may not commit, regardless of how young they are or how noble they are. As a result she was imprisoned in a ushabti by the Ennead Council and her avatar Alexander the Great. [[Arthur Harrow]] is her most loyal servant, and [[Moon Knight]] is her enemy, as he and [[Khonshu]] fight to stop her from killing innocents.

This version of the mythological Ammit was created by Alexander Irvine, Klaus Janson and Russell Braun.

== Trivia ==
*The Egyptian pantheon is the third pantheon introduced in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], after the Norse pantheon and the Greco-Roman pantheon.
