'''Mongo''' is a character from ''[[The Proud Family]]'' episode, "[[Smack Mania 6: Mongo Vs. Mama's Boy]]". He is [[Suga Mama]]'s favorite wrestler in the whole wide world. He is voiced by [[Michael Clarke Duncan]].

==Role in the episode==
===''[[The Proud Family]]''===
===="[[Smack Mania 6: Mongo Vs. Mama's Boy]]"====
Mongo is first seen when [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]] hires him and [[Felix Boulevardez|Felix]] to make an advertisement on Proud Snax while the two actors wrestle each other. However, after eating the Proud Snax, Mongo becomes ill and forces Oscar to step into the ring to defend his belt.

Later in the episode, while Oscar is at the ring, Mongo appears and fights Oscar to retrieve his belt. Oscar's monkey assistant, [[Mr. Chips]], attempts to make Oscar stuff the Proud Snax in Mongo's mouth to make him become ill again and thus, lose the match. The plan works until Oscar jumps on Mongo's tummy, causing the wrestler to spit out the Proud Snax and continue to fight him. Oscar then calls [[Suga Mama]] to come to his defense, as she did in the previous wrestling matches before her son fired her. Suga Mama defeats Mongo, but then she and Oscar get beaten up by Mongo's mother, Momgo
