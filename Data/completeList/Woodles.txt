He helps Minnie and Pluto and the others when needed as soon as he is called, not by saying "Oh, Toodles!" but "Oh, Woodles!" instead. He also has a Mousekedoer of his own called the "Mousekedizz" but it has different colours. [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] operates the Mousekedizz instead of [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]].

== Looks ==
Unlike [[Toodles]], [[Quoodles]], [[Boodles]], and [[Goofles]], but like [[Sheamus]], he doesn't seem to have a face or voice. His faceplate is just a screen of swirls, which is different from both the usual circles that Toodles, Quoodles, Boodles, and Goofles respectively have, as well as the clovers that Sheamus has. He has a dark and light pink colour scheme similar to that of Quoodles.

== Trivia ==
*Around some time when he was about to deliver a Mouseketool, Minnie accidentally tried to call Toodles instead of Woodles.
*He is one of 3 characters that is never shown transforming (The others are Boodles and Sheamus)
*Woodles shares the same theme tune as Toodles when he is called
