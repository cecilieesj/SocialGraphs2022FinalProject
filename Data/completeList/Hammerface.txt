He is designed to hammer nails around Jumba's house, but he will sometimes pound living things. He was captured by [[Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]". 

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Hammerface is a blue-gray dinosaur-like experiment with a hammer-shaped head/face, short forearms, small black eyes, a dense tail, and thick legs. He has claws all over his limbs and very sharp teeth.

===Powers and abilities===
True to his name, Hammerface can drive nails through any surface with his hammer-shaped head/face, but his strength allows him to pound living organisms. He also has some of the basic experiment attributes, including the substance on his hands and feet which allow him to scale walls. His tail is occasionally used as an extra support, a third leg.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 033 was the 33rd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to drive nails around Jumba's house, but he could hammer living organisms as well. 033 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

033's pod eventually made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Heat|609]], [[Thresher|544]], and [[Plasmoid|617]], was discovered, stolen, activated, and named Hammerface by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in "[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]".

Back at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Thresher, Heat, and Plasmoid by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his duplicates after seeing that he had been split into four.

Hammerface engaged one of the clones in a duel. The clone rolled into a ball and slammed into Hammerface, knocking the latter toward the wall, which he clung to. He then jumped onto the floor and ended the fight by slamming his hammer-like head on the opposite end of the floorboard the clone was on, catapulting him into Gantu's awaiting containment orb.

After capturing Stitch and his clones, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Dupe]]. When Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Hammerface into a hundred replicas. However, as the original Hammerface's power was divided among them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.

Presumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge the weakling Hammerface clones into the original.

In "[[The Asteroid]]", Hammerface was one of the six experiments that Stitch convinced to come with him and Lilo to save Earth from an approaching asteroid. Along the journey, [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Sparky]] teased Hammerface by shocking him, angering the latter. Later, the hammer-headed experiment started hitting [[Kixx]] on the head, only to be ordered otherwise by Pleakley (who referred to him as "Hammerhead" instead of "Hammerface").

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Hammerface was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.

In "[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]", Hammerface was sent back to Gantu along with all of Hämsterviel's other captive experimentsafter [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew Hämsterviel's cover to the [[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].

Hammerface reappeared in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Hammerface was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 525 instead of 033.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Hammerface, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Hammerface participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Hammerface made an appearance in Season 2 of the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]], [[Woody (Lilo & Stitch)|Woody]], [[Link]], and [[Babyfier]]. It is revealed that [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] reverted these experiments to evil using a recording of [[Angel]]'s song, thus enabling them to wreak havoc on the [[Izayoi Island|island]].

==Trivia==
*Hammerface is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Plasmoid]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].
**Hammerface (alongside Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid) was named by Gantu.
*Hammerface is Experiment 033. However, in ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'', he is erroneously called 124, most likely due to Jumba's untidy [[Jumba's Computer|database]].
*In "[[The Asteroid]]", Pleakley referred to Hammerface as "Hammerhead". Presumably because his head is indeed shaped like a hammer.
**Additionally, Hammerface was seen already activated, but because this episode was out of chronological order, he wasn't officially activated until the episode "[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]" aired.
*Even though we saw Hammerface in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form, he was technically activated off-screen.
*Hammerface is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*In the English dub of the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime episode "Link-age", [[Reuben]] states that Hammerface's favorite type of sandwich is ham on flatbread.
**Additionally, his number is mistaken for 032, which belongs to [[Fibber]].
