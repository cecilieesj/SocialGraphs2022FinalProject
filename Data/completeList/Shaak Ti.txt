'''Shaak Ti''' is a [[Togruta]] [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] and one of the main characters who appeared in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. She is portrayed by Orli Shoshan in the [[Star Wars|live-action films]] and voiced by Tasia Valenza in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.

==Background==
Shaak was born [[The Force|Force-sensitive]] on the planet Shili. At a very young age, she was discovered by the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]] and brought to the [[Jedi Temple|Coruscant Jedi Temple]] to be trained as a Jedi. She eventually obtained the rank of Jedi Master, becoming a member of the Jedi High Council and becoming one of the finest Jedi that the Jedi Order has ever had.

Shortly after the Clone Wars had begun, Shaak became a Jedi General, early in the war, Shaak was assigned to the watery world of [[Kamino]], in order to oversee the production and training of new [[Clone Troopers]] throughout the war.

By the end of the Clone Wars, [[Anakin Skywalker]], now the ruthless Sith Lord [[Darth Vader]], led a legion of five hundred and one clone troopers and attacked the Coruscant Jedi Temple, during the attack on the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Shaak was in a meditation state at the time, leaving her vulnerable to attack and preventing her from assisting her Jedi comrades; as she meditated during the attack, Shaak was impaled and killed by Vader's blue-bladed [[lightsaber]].

===Personality===
Shaak's nature is sometimes different from her kind, being highly independent and preferring to operate alone. She is sometimes viewed as cold and unfeeling, something that is not helped by her naturally pointed teeth which, when bared, appears as a sinister snarl, naturally patterning to blend into the wilds of Shil. However, Shaak is actually a kind, caring, and compassionate person with a good sense of humour.

As a Jedi, Shaak is intelligent and wise, but sometimes has a habit of underestimating the younger generation of Jedi, as she believed that [[Anakin Skywalker]] was not ready to become a Jedi Knight.

On this matter, Shaak was in the minority when she voiced her doubt about the young Jedi's nature and his readiness to be a Jedi Knight. Thus, she was overruled by the other Jedi High Council members, although she held close to her opinion. However, Shaak was later shocked about the change on Anakin, due to him becoming [[Darth Vader]].

===Physical appearance===
Shaak is a slender, fit Togruta and a sensual, spiritual-looking creature. She has distinctive commonplace white lekku with navy stripes, vermillion skin, black eyes, lavender lips, white patches around both her eyes and forehead area with vertical red lines towards the middle of said markings, later the red lines appear closer to the middle of her face. 

She is adorned with monochromatic (later grey) fingernails, a silver (later gold) akul-tooth headdress, long pleated light brown (later terracotta) skirt with a simple black top and brown lower-arm cuffs or gauntlets. She wears brown (sometimes black) Jedi field boots, tan skin-tight trousers that can also be dark brown, a brown leather belt and buckle, orange and brown patterned tabbard from her belt, a long tan coloured leather sash around her neck, a simple hooded short brown Jedi robe.

Shaak is part of the Jedi High Council replacing master Yaddle. After [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] was captured along with [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padmé Amidala]] on [[Geonosis]], Shaak travelled with a 250 member Jedi strike team led by [[Mace Windu]] to rescue them. They were all surrounded by droids, but were saved by [[Yoda]], and his clonetroopers. In the days afterwards, Shaak was made one of the first Jedi generals for her membership on the Jedi council, extensive array of capabilities, combat experience, leadership, strategical skill, and was often stationed on [[Kamino]] to protect and oversee republic clone production, and training when she was not leading battles.

During Anakin Skywalker's assault on the Jedi Temple during Order 66 with the Clone Troopers, she was meditating when the fallen Jedi Knight snuck up behind her, and stabbed her through the heart with his lightsaber, killing her instantly.
