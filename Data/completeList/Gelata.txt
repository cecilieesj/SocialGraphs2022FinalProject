[[File:Gelata.png|thumb|250px|alt=|Gelata, the head of baking-talents]]'''Gelata''' is a baking-talent fairy and her talent guild's head. She is very demanding and organized. Her first appearance was in the short ''[[Pixie Hollow Bake Off]]''. She is friendly and competitive. She can bake very well, competing with [[Tinker Bell]], [[Silvermist]], [[Fawn]], [[Iridessa]], [[Vidia]] and [[Rosetta]] in the first contest cakes of [[Pixie Hollow]]. She was voiced by celebrity Giada De Laurentiis.

The one thing she can't accept is other people making suggestions to change her recipies. When Tinker Bell merely brought up an idea for a new looking cake, Gelata was so outraged she called for a bake off to prove she was right. Even after [[Queen Clarion]] declared Tinker Bell and her friends cake was better looking, all she cared about was that her cake won for taste, totally missing the point Tinker Bell tried to make.
