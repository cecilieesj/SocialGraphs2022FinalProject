==Background==
Vi Moradi is a spy for the [[Resistance]] during the Galactic Cold War with the [[First Order]]. She would notably start to operate in the Black Spire Outpost on [[Batuu]], a planet located in the Outer Rim near the Wild Space. 

===Development===
Vi was created by the author Delilah S. Dawson for her ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[2017]] novel ''Phasma''. She was described as being a female version of Poe Dameron and partly inspired on James Bond. She became a prominent character in ''[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge]]'' where she would be portrayed by Alex Marshall-Brown. The original Disney World actress to portray the character was Bianca Williams.

Vi is a recurrent character at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, often appearing at ceremonies and events. She can also be randomly encountered in the streets of Black Spire.

====Live Stunt Show====
During a live stunt show at the parks, set sometime after the events of the Battle of [[Crait]], Vi is on a mission to steal a datacard from the [[First Order]], so she infiltrates a shuttle of the organization. Vi finds the datacard, however, before she can leave the ship, she is captured by Supreme Leader [[Kylo Ren]]. Kylo uses [[the Force]] to freeze her and asks where is the location of the new Resistance base. He threats Vi, saying that he will force her to confess the information if she chooses not to comply. But before he can get any answers from Vi, [[Rey]] appears and frees her from Kylo's hold, allowing her to escape. With Rey and [[Chewbacca]]'s help, Vi manages to leave the First Order shuttle safely.

==Trivia==
*Vi is explicitly an asexual character as she can't feel sexual attraction towards anyone regardless of the person's gender.
