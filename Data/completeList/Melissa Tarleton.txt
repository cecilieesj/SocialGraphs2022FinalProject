==Background==
===Personality===
Melissa is your typical status obsessed 17-year-old who is always trying to grab onto the latest trends and is embarrassed to be seen with her father. She can be stuck up and disparaging of others, but also displays a very sensitive and helpful side. It is heavily implied that she has a huge social circle that possibly stems from her ability to pinpoint another person's flaws or weaknesses and exploit them so that they can suck up to her. However, she does show genuine care as she wanted her father to approve of her and is also really close with her brother, Lou, despite his offbeat personality.

===Physical appearance===
Melissa is a female version of her father. She has a big head like him but has black hair with green streaks. She sits in a pink tank like a bowl with a gold headband and a green jewel on it and has average size arms and legs sticking out of it. Her sleeves are a pink sweater and she wears jeans with white tennis shoes.

===Powers and abilities===
Melissa seems to possess some of her father's abilities, though she rarely uses them. She also displays technical knowledge that she most likely picked up from her father.

==Trivia==
*Melissa is bisexual, a trait that will be explored more in season two.
*There is a female version of Modok named Ms. Modok in the 1983 comic ''Incredible Hulk #27''.
