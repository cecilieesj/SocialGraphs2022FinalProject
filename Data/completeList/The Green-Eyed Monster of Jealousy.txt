'''The Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy''', or '''G.I. Monster Esq.''', is a wolf-like monster and the main villain from the ''[[Quack Pack]]'' episode, "[[Snow Place to Hide]]".

==Background==
==='''Physical Appearance'''===
He is a slender and tall wolf-like creature with glowing green eyes, a black nose, thick black eyebrows, brown fur on his head and a dark tan muzzle and wears a green hat, green zoot suit, white gloves, red orange-striped neck tie, light blue undershirt, dark blue pants, and black and white shoes.

==Role in the Episode==
The Green-Eyed Monster of Jealousy first appears out of nowhere after [[Donald Duck|Donald]] says good-bye to [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] for her ski business trip. Throughout the episode, because of Donald's jealousy, he tries to convince Donald into thinking Daisy is having another boyfriend(s) in her life behind his back like [[Kent Powers]] and Jean-Claude, therefore, making Donald grow more jealous and angrier and making him find ways to stop it from happening without being seen; even with the help of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|his nephews]]. In the end, everything backfires and both Donald and the Monster end up in the hospital. Donald realizes he was wrong to be jealous, Daisy forgives him and still admits her love to him, and the Monster gets himself trapped in the hospital bed by Donald in retaliation for all the lies and trouble he caused for him.

==Trivia==
*Donald also got a Green-Eyed Monster in the [[Carl Barks]]' comic story ''The Master Rainmaker'', but the one in ''Quack Pack'' is unlikely based on the comic book one, who looked more devil-like.
*The Monster's clothes bear a striking resemblance to [[Toon Patrol|Greasy]]'s clothes from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
