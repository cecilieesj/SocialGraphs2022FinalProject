==Background==
Alice is introduced to us in a department store, being placed on a hat stand in the window, where she meets her love, [[Johnny Fedora]], as he starts singing to her. She is eventually bought and is shown to be very sad as she is placed in a hatbox and taken away from Johnny. Later, while her owner is walking through town, she sees Johnny who has been sold himself but they can't get to each other. However, she eventually ends up in the possession of an iceman who cuts two holes in her rim and places her over one of his horse's ears. To her joy, Johnny is found by the same iceman shortly thereafter and placed on the head of his other horse. Thus, they are reunited and go on to be together ever after.
