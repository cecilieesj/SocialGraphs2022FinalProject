'''Professor Owl''' is a blue owl and schoolteacher from two Disney animated shorts--''[[Melody (Adventures in Music)|Melody]]'' and ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]'', and later host of [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]''===
Utilizing archive footage from the original shorts (as well as new animation), Professor Owl would become the host of the early videos in the ''Sing Along Songs'' series, leading his classroom in the theme song of the video series in addition to his various transition segments. As the series went on, Professor Owl was phased out as the host of the videos, instead only appearing at the beginning to introduce either [[Jiminy Cricket]] or [[Ludwig Von Drake]] as the video's host. In the All-Time Favorites videos and the beginning of the "Honor to Us All" video, the Professor was only heard in voice over.

===''[[House of Mouse]] ''===
Professor Owl can be seen in the opening sequence to ''[[House of Mouse]]'' as well as in the episodes "[[Where's Minnie?]]" and "[[Ask Von Drake]]".

==Trivia==
*The character [[Merlin (Legend of the Three Caballeros)|Merlin]] in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'' bares a striking resemblance to Professor Owl.
*The shape of Professor Owl, among other things, served as the inspiration for the character of [[KnowsMore]] in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.
