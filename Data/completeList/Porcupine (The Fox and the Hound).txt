'''Porcupine''' is a minor character from ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.

==Role in the film==
The Porcupine is first seen when he sees [[Tod]], a new arrival in the forest, being chased out by [[Mr. Digger]] from the latter's den from which the former entered accidentally. Much more friendly than Mr. Digger, the Porcupine offers Tod shelter in his home in the hollow tree, but the place is a bit small and the fox is abruptly awakened at dawn when he is accidentally pricked by the quills of the rodent, causing Tod to fall from the tree onto Mr. Digger's den. When Mr. Digger angrily corners Tod, the Porcupine tries to defend Tod with no success, and is forced to watch in sadness as Tod is shooed away by Mr. Digger, who tells the depressed fox to go back where he came from. Fortunately, he is later able to watch in happiness while Tod and Vixey confirm their love for each other, although he is seen laughing as Tod unsuccessfully attempts to catch a fish. Porcupine is later seen watching [[Copper]] and [[Amos Slade]] go around the game reserve and set traps along their path with a worried look on his face. He is not seen throughout the rest of the film after this.

==Trivia==
*The porcupine was voiced by [[John Fiedler]], who also voiced [[Piglet]] until his death in [[2005]].
*Despite being the positive good counterpart to Mr. Digger, who hates animals trying to trespass his home, a [[Porcupine (Bambi II)|porcupine]] similar to Mr. Digger, who also hates animals trespassing their property, would appear in [[Bambi II]].
