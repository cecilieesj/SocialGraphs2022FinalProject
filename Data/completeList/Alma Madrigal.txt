'''Alma Madrigal''' (often referred to as '''Abuela''') is the deuteragonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film ''[[Encanto]].'' A woman whom was blessed with a gift-granting [[Miracle Candle]], Abuela is the matriarch of the [[The Madrigals|Madrigals]], the mother of [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] and the grandmother of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]], [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]], [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] and [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]. As the original source of its magic, Abuela also serves as the head of the [[Encanto (location)|enchanted village]] in which she and her family resides.

[[File:Alma Breaks Down.png|left|thumb|Alma breaks down after witnessing her husband's death.|alt=|195x195px]]
Alma at an undefined point in time in her past, she met a man named [[Pedro Madrigal|Pedro]] during a celebration for [[Wikipedia:Day of the Little Candles|Day of the Little Candles]] in their village,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468264875193298948|title=Pedro's info|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref> where they fell in love and eventually got married a short time later. Much to her delight, Alma got pregnant and one day gave birth to triplets [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]]. But on the very day of the triplets' birth, a conflict called the [[Wikipedia:Thousand Days' War|Thousand Days' War]] struck her town. Alma and Pedro were forced to leave her home with her family. They escaped from their village along with some other citizens and left in search of a new home, but as they crossed through a river in the valley, the conquerors caught up with them. During the conflict that same day, Pedro said goodbye to Alma and sacrificed himself to the conquerors who were chasing after the escaping villagers, allowing her and her children to escape but at the cost of her husband's life. Having witnessed Pedro's death, Alma was heartbroken and unable to run when the conquistadors closed in on her. In her despair and pain, Alma prayed for a miracle and was immediately granted one. Magic was born from Alma's candle, and the magic created the Encanto where Alma and the rest of the citizens who escaped with her could live in peace. The miracle also vanquishing the invading army, created a mountain range to protect the Encanto, and also granted Alma a sentient house for her and her family to live in.

Due to losing everything in the span of one night, Alma never had time to properly process the pain as she had to raise her children alone and become a guide and caretaker of the refugees from her village. The responsibility that was imposed on her as guardian of the miracle made her a hardened woman and since the day she lost her husband she has been afraid of losing her home and family again. When Alma's children turned five, they each got their own unique magical gifts accompanied with their new room. Over time, Alma's daughters fell in love and married. Pepa met a man named [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]] with a cheerful personality with whom Alma got along from the beginning and quickly accepted him as part of the family. While Julieta met a man named [[Agustín Madrigal|Agustín]] whom Alma was skeptical that he would fall in love with Julieta since he was probably not Alma's first choice to marry her daughter, but Julieta loved Agustín so much that they eventually got married and he became part of the family. To her surprise and delight, over the years Alma's daughters had children of their own and she became the grandmother of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]], [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]], [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] and [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]], who all refer her as Abuela.

When it came time for Mirabel's ceremony, she reached for her door and touched the door knob, instead of getting a magical gift and opening the way to her new room like her sisters and cousins, Mirabel didn't get a gift and the door disappeared. Alma, fearful for the family's magic, asked Bruno to please look into the future to see what this meant, as no Madrigal child had ever been denied a gift before. However, Bruno would never tell Alma about what he saw and disappear without saying anything. Alma never knew why her son abandoned the family and blamed Mirabel for Bruno's disappearance and pushed her away. Fearful that Mirabel's lack of a gift meant the family had proven themselves worthy of the miracle, Alma increased the family's efforts to serve the community. Although she meant well, Alma also inadvertently put too much pressure on her family, with some of her grandchildren, particularly Mirabel, Isabela, and Luisa, growing up with some emotional trauma from her expectations.

===Development===
As with the rest of the Madrigal family, Alma was designed to reflect "family archetypes that are immediately relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-11-29/encanto-explained-disney-colombia-consultants|title=‘Encanto’ is Disney’s first Latino musical.

During the creation process, Alma originally had hair that transformed into a river that flowed for miles, and Mirabel would've had to follow it in order to connect to her emotionally. But from the beginning, Alma was always a severe and complicated person⁚ someone that has to always look out for the well-being of her family and the town, with a painful connection to the past.<ref>[[The Art of Encanto]]</ref>

María Cecilio Botero, Alma's voice actor, describes her character: ''"Abuela doesn't have a gift. She's the one… that keeps the family together… I think I am, too, in my family. So it was kind of myself."''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vitalthrills.com/encanto-movie/|title=Encanto Movie Cast & Crew on the New Disney Film|website=VitalThrills|last=Busch|first=Jenna|date=November 8, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

===Personality===
[[File:Encanto-animationscreencaps.com-858.jpg|thumb|Alma being more affectionate with Isabela than with any of her other grandchildren.]]
As the matriarch of the Madrigal Family, Alma is dedicated to doing what in her eyes is best for her family and initially hoists expectations on her children and grandchildren in how they use their gifts to help the community, often taking the form of a demand for perfection.

Due to her desire for perfectionism, Alma has a certain favoritism towards some members of her family without realizing the damage and insecurity it causes to other members of the family. Out of all her grandchildren, she favors her oldest granddaughter and golden child [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]]; this doting placing a lot of pressure on her while at the same time making Isabela's sisters and cousins feel inadequate living in her shadow. Due to the problems of his gift, supposedly along with being the only of her children to be unmarried and childless, Alma often doubted Bruno's contributions to both the community and their family. As far as sons-in-law go, Alma preferred [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]] over [[Agustín Madrigal|Agustín]], due to not approving of the latter nor in him marrying Julieta, partly because she judged him harshly for his clumsiness and unwillingness to understand why her daughter chose him.

[[File:Encanto - Alma praying for a miracle.png|left|thumb|Alma having a rare moment of vulnerability and weakness.]]
Alma tries to be patient and understanding, but from her point of view, she feels some should just step aside and do nothing without her express approval. As a result, she is very controlling and denies there is anything wrong, assuring her neighbors that all is well and that there is nothing to fear, even when [[Casa Madrigal]] is cracking all around her. But the truth is, Alma knows that her home and perhaps even her family is in danger, as she privately revealed to herself (unknowingly being overheard by Mirabel), as Alma spoke as though she were speaking with her late husband, Pedro, revealing that Alma is afraid for her home, her family, and losing everything as they did before, and she cannot bear to go through that again, and she prays to her Pedro to help her. This displays Alma's vulnerability that she is too afraid to reveal even to her family and that Alma feels the burden of trying to preserve her family, her community and their miracle and their Encanto, and explains why she does everything she can to protect them. Unfortunately, this fear of losing everything again often causes her to assume the worst in a situation or even in others (including her own family) and their intentions. Alma would particularly doubt her son, [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]], since his often negative visions which tended to cause trouble lead her to believe he didn't care about their family after he left, and youngest granddaughter, [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]], as being the only member without a gift made Alma look down on her and exclude her from family activities at best or, upon seeing Bruno's vision, fear her destroying the magic at worst.

[[File:Alma shocked by Mirabel's words.png|thumb|Alma shocked when Mirabel points to her as the true cause of the miracle dying.]]
When she sees how her expectations of her family are unraveling because of Mirabel, Alma, misinterpreting her attempts to help as jeopardizing the magic according to Bruno's vision, unfairly blames her for everything, accusing her of hurting the family (among those being the cause of Bruno's disappearance) out of resentment for not being given a gift. Finally fed up with this treatment, Mirabel angrily snaps at Alma and stands up for the family, stating that no matter how hard any of them tries, magical gifts or not, ''none'' of them will ever be good enough for her or her expectations (and that Bruno left only because she saw the worst in him as well as Mirabel). When Mirabel states it is actually Alma causing the miracle to fade, the older woman can only be silent and shocked at these words before the Casita collapses as a result of their heated argument. Taking in the destruction of their home, Mirabel's words, as well as near-death in saving the candle, would cause Alma to realize the pressure and even unintentional misery she had been subjecting her family to.

[[File:Encanto - Traumatized Young Alma.png|left|thumb|Broken from having lost so much, Alma abandons her former joy and hope.]]
In a sincere heart-to-heart with Mirabel by the river where her husband perished, Alma reveals more insight in their family beginnings. In the memories of her youth, Alma was once a cheerful young woman full of life and hope, but when her husband [[Pedro Madrigal|Pedro]] sacrificed his life to buy time for his family, friends, and neighbors to escape from the marauders who were after them after having to leave their home, Alma was left devastated and broken. Losing the love of her life, her home, and everything she knew and loved traumatized Alma so much that she swore it would never happen again, determined to preserve it. But over time, she lost sight of what truly mattered and unintentionally took their miracle for granted (despite previously stating they should not take said miracle for granted), and forgot who it was for, and what made their family so special was not the magic but the fact that, in spite of tragedy, they are a family, which is the real miracle. It was because of this, that Alma was constantly looking outwards for a problem or even a threat to all she held dear, that she never thought to look inward until it was too late, which is when she finally realized, her family had been broken because of her, not Mirabel or Bruno, and why she never once considered that her well-intentioned actions were the problem.

[[File:Alma apologizing to Julieta and Pepa.png|thumb|After realizing her mistakes, Alma sincerely and lovingly apologizes to her family.]]
Now understanding the pain and loss Alma had never fully healed from, along with the burden she had long carried, Mirabel assures her grandmother that it is because of her that they were saved, that they were granted a miracle, that they are a family and nothing is so broken that they could not fix together. Touched by her granddaughter's words and maturity, Alma finally realizes, after asking Pedro for help, that Mirabel was the answer to her prayers all along and they reconcile. At the same time, Alma also reconciles with her lost son when he suddenly appeared, trying to take all the blame for Mirabel before his mother warmly hugs and kisses him while calling him "Brunito", happy to have him back (despite who previously held a grudge against him for abandoning the family). Alma then becomes a happier and warmer person than she was before, freeing herself from her dark past. The first thing Alma does after her conversation with Mirabel and returning to the ruins of the Casita, is to affectionately treat her daughters [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]] and [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] before bringing Bruno back into the family. Alma reconciles with the rest of her family, apologizing for how she held on too tight out of fear she would lose them all as well, but now understands that they are the true miracle, not the gift of magic itself. She also happily works alongside her family and community as they rebuild the Casita, helping to strengthen the bonds of the family to become stronger than ever and causing the magic to be restored later in the Encanto.

===Physical appearance===
[[File:Encanto Young Alma Madrigal (1).jpg|left|thumb|Alma in the memories of her youth during "[[Dos Oruguitas]]".]]
Abuela Alma is a 75-year-old elderly woman with grey hair with streaks of black in it. She has brown eyes and very few wrinkles. She wears a long maroon/magenta dress with butterflies and streaks embroidered on it and mountain designs at the bottom of he dress, orange teardrop-shaped circles on her collar, and flower-like symbols on certain parts of her clothing like ones that appear slightly above her elbows (which all represent the candle), a chatelaine belt with a key and two pocket watches, and black high heels. Alma also has small pearl earrings, which almost show a slight glint of her younger happier self. She initially wore a dark black mourning shawl on special occasions, like a Madrigal child's gift ceremony or [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]]'s proposal dinner, but stopped wearing it after making peace with her past.

When Alma was younger, she was slightly taller with a slim build and had a more smiley and cheerful appearance, complete with dark brown middle swept bangs and her hair braided on both sides with red bows tying the ends of both braids which are both over the front of her shoulders. She also has a white shirt with a frilly white collar that all the Madrigal women excluding [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]] have, with an ankle length indigo-blue skirt with black sandals. During the escape from her village, she wore a magenta shawl.

===Powers and abilities===
Abuela Alma doesn't possess any particular gift, due to being the one who found the miracle that blessed the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal family]] in the first place. Instead, she is in charge of all magic of the family. She takes care of the magical candle that gives the family their magical gifts, although she herself has no individual gift, as she merely makes sure the family magic is used carefully. Becoming the leader of the [[Encanto (location)|Encanto]] since she was very young, Alma has leadership skills as she leads an entire village by herself and directs most of the activities that occur in the Encanto such as the construction of various houses or differents events. Being the person with the most authority in the Encanto, her family and the entire town of Encanto, turn to her in moments of uncertainty and communal anxiety. Like [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]], she also has a stronger affinity with the [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]] than most of her family; Alma communicates with the house like it is a real person, and Casita responds to her prompts.

== Appearances ==
=== ''[[Encanto]]'' ===
[[File:Encanto - Alma and Lili.png|thumb|Alma helping and working alongside the townspeople.]]
Alma first appears telling a five-year-old [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] the story of how their family was blessed with magic and how the Miracle Candle will grant her a magical gift during her birthday. When it comes time for her granddaughter's gift ceremony, she asks Alma what she thinks her gift will be, to which Alma responds that Mirabel is a wonder and whatever gift she gets will be just as special as her. In the present, it is the morning of Alma's youngest grandson [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]'s fifth birthday, and he's expected to get his gift by the end of the day. Alma helps Antonio prepare for his special day and in "[[The Family Madrigal]]", Alma can be seen walking and helping around town, as well as proudly watching her oldest granddaughter [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]] as she grows different roses in town. She eventually returned to the house and tells people it's time to get ready for Antonio's ceremony. When Mirabel was finishing telling the kids in town about the family, Alma visibly confused at the [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]]'s entrance, asked Mirabel what she was doing. Mirabel explains she was telling the kids about the family, and when Alejandra says the Mirabel was about to tell them about her gift, Alma walks away after [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] says that Mirabel didn't get one.

[[File:Mirabel and Alma.jpg|left|thumb|Alma tells Mirabel to step aside so the other members of the family can work.]]
While preparing Antonio's gift ceremony, Alma saw [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]] leaning lazily against a bannister and instructed him to help a townsperson named Jose with a banner over Antonio's door and she also tells [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] to put the piano on the upper floor of the house. She can later be heard telling her family to clean their rooms saying that she didn't care how big they were. Alma catches Mirabel trying to decorate the outside of the rooms in the house, and although she acknowledges that Mirabel wants to help, she tells her that the best way for Mirabel to help would be to step aside (much to her frustration) and let the other members of the family do what they do best. [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] then walks by, and Alma alerts her that she has a cloud hanging over her head, but Pepa tells her that she can't find Antonio. When their conversation is over, Alma runs into [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]] on the stairs who asks her to be nice to Mirabel because she knows Antonio's gift ceremony was going to be difficult because Mirabel's own gift ceremony didn't turn out well. Alma tells her that if Antonio's gift ceremony doesn't go well, it's going to be a difficult night for everyone.

[[File:Alma happy that Antonio has a gift.png|thumb|Alma announces during the ceremony that Antonio received a magical gift.]]
During Antonio's ceremony, Alma gives a brief speech about how the Madrigal family was blessed with a miracle fifty years earlier. When Antonio approaches her and touches the [[Miracle Candle]], Alma asks him if he will use his gift to strengthen the community. He nods his head and approaches his door, and Alma waits with bated breath as Antonio reaches for his door knob. Antonio successfully receives a gift much Alma's relief as she announces to the crowd that the family has a new gift. As the family celebrates inside of Antonio's new room, Alma gathers everyone, except for Mirabel, together for a family photo. Alma continues celebrating with the family and the townsfolk in Antonio's new room, even dancing with [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]] for a few moments. As everyone is celebrating, Alma is shocked when Mirabel runs into the room announcing that the house was in danger. Alma wants Mirabel to show her, and Mirabel led everyone outside to show them that the house was cracking, however the cracks suddenly disappeared. Mirabel tried explaining to Alma what she saw, and Alma cuts her off and announces to everyone that the magic was strong and so were the drinks, and everyone goes back to celebrating. Later that night however, Alma talks to a picture of [[Pedro Madrigal|Pedro]] while looking out of her window. She expresses concern about the state of the magic and concern for what will happen to their home.

[[File:Alma congratulating Isabela.png|left|thumb|Alma happy at the idea of Mariano and Isabela's proposal that same night.]]
The following morning, Alma gathers everyone around for breakfast, and states that they are all grateful for Antonio's new gift. As she sits down she nearly sits on Antonio's animals. Antonio tells Alma that he asked them to warm up her seat, and she thanks him and she shoos the animals away saying that she's sure they can find a way to put his blessings to good use. While Alma continues talking, Mirabel starts shouting, and Alma has the Casita move Mirabel's seat from next to Luisa, to next to her. Alma tells everyone that they can't take the miracle for granted and that they will work twice as hard. When Mirabel tries getting up from her seat, Alma tells her to stop and has the Casita push the chair back in. Alma announces that she spoke to the Guzmáns about [[Mariano Guzmán|Mariano]]'s proposal to Isabela and asks Dolores for a date on the proposal. Alma's very happy when Dolores says that Mariano was planning on proposing that same night and that he wanted five children, which makes Isabela sprout nervous flowers on her head. While removing an imperfect flower from Isabela's head, Alma comments that the pair would bring a new generation of "magical blessings" and make both families stronger. Alma then proceeded to tell the family that the community was counting on them before dismissing everyone from the table.

[[File:Encanto - Alma looking at the Miracle Candle.png|thumb|Alma looking at the Miracle Candle when acting strange.]]
Later that morning, Alma and Isabela are walking hand-in-hand as Alma tells Isabela that she believes her and Mariano are a perfect match. As Mirabel finds different pieces of Bruno's vision, Alma can be seen cleaning different flower petals from the Casita before turning to look at the miracle candle as it acts strangely. Sometime after that, when Mirabel emerges from Bruno's room after having found pieces of his vision, Alma wants to know where Mirabel was coming from in a hurry. Before Mirabel could say anything, Luisa comes into the house and frantically explains to Alma that she was losing her gift. During her explanation, Luisa mentions to Alma how Mirabel told her that she shouldn't carry too much. When Luisa runs away crying, Alma asks Mirabel what exactly did she say to Luisa but Mirabel denies having said anything. Alma then tells Mirabel she has to go get the Guzmáns for Isabela's engagement and she instructs Mirabel to stay away from Luisa until she can talk to her because they can't have any more problems. Before she leaves the house, Alma tells Mirabel to stop doing whatever she's doing.

[[File:Alma looking at Bruno's vision.jpg|left|thumb|Alma discovering Bruno's vision about the miracle's death and the Casita.]]
Towards the end of "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]", when most of the Madrigals are setting the table for dinner, Alma was escorting [[Señora Guzmán]] and Mariano to the Casita while announcing Mariano's arrival. When the Guzmáns arrive, Alma announces to everyone that it's time to eat dinner. Before everyone eats, Alma says that the union between the Guzmáns and Madrigals would be good for the families and for the Encanto. Señora Guzmán makes a joke about hoping that the night goes well and that it doesn't turn out to be a horrible disaster. Alma then makes a toast to a perfect night. As the night goes on, Alma tries to keep Señora Guzmán happy as members of her family become distressed when learning of Bruno's vision, such as Dolores acting strange, Camilo quickly shapeshifts into Mirabel and Bruno before his face distorts and his eyes look in different directions before he fixes it, Félix spitting out his water on Mariano and Pepa creating a storm cloud, which Alma tries to tell her to get rid of. As dinner starts spiraling out of control with the spread of Bruno‘s vision about the magic fading and Pepa started forming a thundercloud, Alma gets visibly distressed. When Mirabel, while trying to grab the vision that Antonio's animals had assembled, accidentally slides it to Alma, she is horrified by what she sees. When everyone leaves the dining room, Alma chases after Señora Guzmán and Mariano to try to get them to stay. When the townsfolk witnessed the Guzmáns running out of the Casita, Alma proclaims that they are the Madrigals and that the magic is strong and everything is fine before slamming the door shut and shouts "Mirabel!".

[[File:Alma, Señora Guzmán and Mariano (2).png|thumb|Alma watches Isabela growing different plants while trying to talk to the Guzman family.]]
Later the failed dinner, Alma reprimands Agustín for keeping information about Bruno's vision to himself, saying that he should've thought of the family and told her as soon as he saw it. Agustín, however says that he was thinking of his daughter. Before she can say anything, Alma notices that Pepa is creating a mini snowstorm and tells her to calm down, and Pepa tells her that she's trying and she's just lucky that she isn't creating a hurricane. Julieta tells Alma that she's always been too hard on Mirabel, and Alma tells them to look at the cracks and they must protect their family and Encanto, going on to say that they cannot lose their home. When the townspeople come to the Casita telling her that people are worried about the magic, Alma goes into town, but before she leaves, she tells Agustín and Julieta that they need to find Mirabel because she was in Bruno's vision for a reason. While in town, Alma stops by the Guzmáns' house and tries to make amends for the ruined proposal dinner. However, during "[[What Else Can I Do?]]", while Isabela is growing a series of exotic plants, she accidentally breaks Mariano's nose a second time. Alma is shocked when she sees what Isabela and Mirabel both are doing back at the Casita.

[[File:Mirabel reaches her breaking point.png|left|thumb|Alma arguing with Mirabel as she proceeds to blame her for the family's problems.]]
When she returns home, Alma is visibly angry and demands to know what is going on. While Isabela is frightened by her presence, Mirabel quite excited tries to tell Alma that she was going to save the miracle. Mirabel tries to tell Alma that Isabela wasn't happy, and Alma says it's clear that Isabela's unhappy because Mirabel ruined her proposal. Alma gets increasingly more agitated as Mirabel tries to explain what she had been doing and how she was going to save the miracle (which explains why she was in Bruno's vision), but Alma cuts her off and tells her that she needs to stop. As Isabela, Luisa, Julieta, Agustín and later the rest of the family watch from a distance, Alma berates Mirabel and proceeds to blame her for all the family's problems, such as the house cracking, Bruno leaving, Luisa losing her powers and Isabela being out of control. She tells Mirabel that she doesn't know why she wasn't given a gift but it wasn't an excuse for her to hurt the family. Mirabel, after a moment of hurt, questions if she, along with everyone else, would ever be good enough for Alma, no matter how hard they tried. As Mirabel defends everyone (mostly her sisters and uncle), she tells Alma that Bruno only left because Alma only saw the worst in him, but Alma states that Bruno didn't care about the family. Mirabel insisted everybody (including Bruno) loves the family and Alma was the only one who didn't care, and that Alma was the one breaking their home. Angered by her granddaughter’s accusing words, Alma began to raise her voice. But before she can contradict her, Mirabel points to her as the true cause of the miracle dying, which causes Alma to become horrified and shocked.

[[File:Alma finds Mirabel.png|thumb|Alma finds a heartbroken Mirabel sitting by the river after the fall of the Casita.]]
By the time the heated argument dies down, the ground beneath them starts cracking and the house starts falling apart as the candle starts fading fast. Alma can only watch in horror as the candle begins to go out as half of her grandchildren try to make various attempts to save the candle. As the house starts collapsing more and more, everybody except for Mirabel is thrown out and Alma is caught by Luisa before she hits the ground. Alma watches in horror as Mirabel risks her life to get the candle as the house starts falling in on itself. After the Casita is destroyed and the candle dies along with the magic, Alma can be seen visibly terrified that she has lost her home as she has to be cared for by Dolores, who sits her on a small piece of debris to calm her own. When Julieta noticed Mirabel went missing, the Madrigals and the other townspeople spread out to search for her. The next morning, Alma finds a tearful Mirabel in the valley, sitting next to the river that she and Pedro had crossed while escaping from conquerors fifty years earlier. While releasing stress, Mirabel apologizes, saying that she didn't want to hurt the family, only trying to be something that she wasn't. Seeing how saddened her granddaughter was, Alma sat down next to her and told her that she never thought she would be able to return to the river, since it's where Pedro died and where they were given the miracle.

After in the "[[Dos Oruguitas]]" sequence she reveals more about her past and the full origin of the miracle, she goes on to explain to Mirabel that she thought that she and Pedro would have a different life together and she would be a different person. Alma says she was given a miracle, a second chance that she was so afraid to lose it that she ultimately lost sight of what the ''real'' miracle was: her family, not the gifts they were granted with. Alma apologizes to Mirabel and tells her that Mirabel never hurt their family, and acknowledges that she's the reason the family is broken because her heart never healed from the trauma she went through. Mirabel takes Alma's hands in hers and acknowledges the loss and sorrow that Alma experienced as a young woman and she understands that Alma didn't want it to happen again. Mirabel proceeds to tell Alma that they were saved because of her, they were a family because of her and they were given a miracle because of her, and then assured her that nothing is so broken that they cannot fix together. Touched by her granddaughter’s words and wisdom, Alma tells Mirabel that she asked Pedro for help and Pedro sent her Mirabel and the two of them reconcile and hug after 10 years since Mirabel's failed ceremony while golden butterflies flies around them. Just as they finish their embrace and emerge from the river, Bruno comes riding in on a horse, yelling that Mirabel didn't do anything wrong and that he gave her a vision and all Mirabel wanted to do was help. Alma is shocked when she sees Bruno after ten years. As Bruno continues talking and preparing to argue with her, Alma rushes to him and gives him a hug, much to his confusion. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and grabs his hand and pulls him onto the horse and all three of them ride on horseback to the Encanto.

When they get back to the Encanto and reunite with the rest of the family in the ruins of the Casita, during "[[All of You]]" Alma walks up to her surprised daughters and treats them lovingly while apologizing for holding onto the magic too tight and says the miracle isn't magic they possess, rather simply themselves, as she lovingly guides a timid Bruno to rejoin the family when he is afraid to do so. Alma watches with joy as the triplets are reunited after a decade and as some of her grandchildren are confused or happy by Bruno's presence. With the family all together, Mirabel rallied them to fix the house and the entire town also pitched in as thanks for all the Madrigals had done for them, including Mariano and Señora Guzman, much to Alma's delight. When helping to rebuild the Casita, Alma can be seen working on some blueprints for the house. After completing the house, Alma guided Mirabel to Casita's entrance to add a doorknob the family made just for her to the front door, which to her surprise caused Casita to spring back to life, and the magic returned to the entire Encanto. As they enter the house, Alma with Mirabel and Bruno watch with joy as other members of their family recover their powers and begin to be themselves. The Madrigals then celebrated the return of their home and gifts with a family picture while Casita squished the whole family closer together unexpectedly.

==Trivia==
*The name "Alma" means "soul" or "spirit" in Spanish and Portuguese, likely referring to how Alma is the soul of the family and the one who keeps them together.
*According to Julieta, she has been hard to Mirabel ever since she did not get a gift, and the novelization of the movie states that she hasn't even hugged her since, until when they reconciled in "Dos Oruguitas" after a heart-to-heart conversation with her. 
*''Abuela'' means "grandmother" in Spanish.
*An iconic moment in the movie was her saying "The magic is strong! And so are the drinks!" Though unbeknownst to her and the rest of the family, except Luisa, the house began to crack and the magic began to waver.
*Early in production, the character's name was Andrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2020/12/09/exclusive-new-details-for-walt-disney-animation-studios-encanto/|title=Exclusive: New Details for Walt Disney Animation Studios’ ‘Encanto’|website=The Disinsider|last=Sharpe|first=Josh|date=December 9, 2020|access-date=July 8, 2021}}</ref>
*Alma wears a black shawl. This shows that she is in mourning for her husband Pedro. After revisiting the site of his death in years and making amends with Mirabel,  she no longer wears it when she apologizes to her family in "[[All of You]]", displaying she has made peace with his passing.
*While not much focus is given to Alma's room, it is supposed to be an exact recreation of her old home.{{Citation needed}}
