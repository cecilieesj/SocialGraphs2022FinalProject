'''The Moopets''' are [[Fozzie Bear]]'s Muppet tribute band and antagonists of the [[2011]] film ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''. The group features thug doppelgangers of famous Muppet characters, including Miss Poogy, Foozie Bear, Roowlf, Kermoot the Frog and Janooce, as well as [[Dave Grohl]] (who played the part of Animool, the only Moopet that wasn't a puppet).
==Appearances==
===''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''===
The Moopets is a Muppet tribute band headlined at the Pechoolo Casino by "original Muppets cast member" [[Fozzie Bear]] seen in ''[[The Muppets (franchise)|The Muppets]]''. The group features thug doppelgangers of famous Muppet characters such as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], [[Janice]] and [[Animal]]. The most notable member is Miss Poogy, who temporarily becomes a member of The Muppets. When Fozzie leaves the group, he is replaced by a Moopet version of him.

The Moopets are seen performing a variation of "[[The Rainbow Connection]]" at a casino in Reno and as villains later in the film, assisting [[Tex Richman]] in his plan to defeat the Muppets with the promise to becoming their replacement. However, after Richman gives the theater and name back to the Muppets after a change of heart, The Moopets are seen approaching him demanding money.

The only Moopets with speaking roles are Miss Poogy and Foozie, although Janooce can briefly be heard during the film's epilogue.

===''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''===
Miss Poogy briefly appears as a prisoner at the gulag.

==Trivia==
*The name "Moopet" has been referenced beforehand; a Muppet bag of garbage yells, "Hey, you're a Moopet!" at [[Kermit]] during the opening of the [[1989]] TV series, ''{{WikipediaLink|The Jim Henson Hour}}''.
