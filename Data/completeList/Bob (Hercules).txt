{{Quote|Long ago, in the faraway land of [[ancient Greece]], there was a golden age of powerful [[Olympian Gods|gods]] and extraordinary heroes. And the greatest and strongest of all these heroes was the mighty [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]. But what is the measure of a true hero? Ah. That is what our story is..."<br>"Will you listen to him? He's makin' the story sound like some Greek tragedy.|The Narrator and [[Muses|Thalia]]|Hercules (film)}}

Unnamed in the film, Bob serves as the original narrator of the story of the mighty [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and his journey to become a true hero. However, before he could begin the story, the [[Muses]] found the original narrator's way of telling the story as being too depressing. He is not heard from nor mentioned in the film since.

Like in the film, Bob (or "Bobby") serves as narrator of the animated series which follows the adventures of young Hercules, expanding upon the Greek demigod's feats during his formative, adolescent hero-in-training years, while also attending the [[Prometheus Academy]] on Zeus' instruction. He often starts off an episode, but is then cut off by the [[Muses]] who occasionally interrupt him. Though he doesn't always speak during the beginning of an episode. He is often called Bobby Baby or Bobby Boy by Thalia. Bob sings at least once with the Muses in "[[Hercules and the Assassin]]" through "[[Pericles of Athens]]" named after the [[Pericles|beloved leader of the same name]]. The only time Bob is seen is in "[[Hercules and the Return of Typhon]]", where he and his incorporeal family's actions are seen by hats moving midair. Bob has a wife (voiced by Susan Tolsky), a daughter named "Tiffany" and a son named "Chad". Witnessing Bob's invisible family, [[Pegasus]] shakes his head in disbelief. In some episodes, such as "[[Hercules and the Bacchanal]]", Bob narrates halfway through the show. It is also shown in the same episode that he envies Hercules' life of adventure and that he likes ice cream with rainbow sprinkles.

== Trivia ==

* His name being Bob in the series is a shortened nickname for Robert, implying that the narrator is just his voice actor Robert Stack interacting with the story.
