==Role in the Series==
She is in charge of an archaeological dig in the episode "[[Finders Leapers]]." In the episode Professor Mendoza declares the temple found is more valuable than any treasure. This is because it deals with the history of Avalor: The Maruvians lived in the land hundreds of years before the Kingdom was born and mysteriously vanished. Professor Mendoza had placed all her Maruvian discoveries in the Maru Atlas. She also appeared in "[[The Curse of El Guapo]]". Here, she asks Gabe to deliver a package to the Museum of Archeology, telling him not to open it, for inside was a sword cursed by the spirit of its previous owner.
