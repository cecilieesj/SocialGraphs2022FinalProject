'''Martina Crowe''' is a recurring antagonist, and later ally, in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. She is a snooty girl who attends the L.I.V.E. Institute and is very competitive, but passionate about her place.

==Background==

===Personality===
Martina is an entitled, spoiled and prideful young girl who believes she is the best at everything. While her intelligence is somewhat questionable, she is smart enough to be viewed as the highest rated student at the Institute. If anyone dare come close to her talents however, she will begrudgingly acknowledge it and try to use it to her advantage.

===Physical appearance===
Martina is a young girl of Indian descent with pulled back raven hair and blue knots. She is always seen in a school uniform of a yellow shirt, grey vest and skirt and has a sash that indicates her messenger status.

==Trivia==
*In the original book series, she was a lot more curt and despicable and remains enemies to the Society, even after the events of the first book. Her clothing was also described as being composed of a green shirt, jeans and sneakers and wore her hair in a ponytail.
*Martina is very different from the roles Saara Chaudry is used to playing. She is mostly known for playing likeable quirky characters with Martina having her play against type.
*It's implied that Martina is not Christian, as shown in "[[Depends on the Wagon]]", when the rankings are shown, she sees another student praying and says "Your God can't help you now". However, this could be her simply acting insultingly sarcastic.
