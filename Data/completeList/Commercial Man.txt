The Commercial Man first appears in the [[Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience|first episode]], set during the 1950, in black and white. He stands in front of a toaster, where a burnt piece of bread comes out, and asks the audience if their husbands are tired of them, burning their toast. He then walks over to the new Toast Mate 2000, which he describes as the go-to for clever housewives. The Commercial Woman comments on the toasters shine, to which he agrees, and he narrates to the audience, how the toaster works, as the Commercial Woman demonstrates. He lists the various foods that can be used, and when finely toasted bread comes out, he gives the name of the product, and its manufacturer, Stark Industries. He then narrates the adverts slogan, "Forget the past, this is your future!"

In the [[Don't Touch That Dial|second episode]], which takes place in the 1960s era, and is also in black and white, the Commercial Man is wearing a tuxedo, and adjusting his bow tie in the mirror. His "lady" appears by his side, and the Commercial Man pulls his wrist to the front of the camera, so they can see his Str√ºcker watch. The two then leave the room, arm in arm.

The [[Now in Color|third episode]] takes place in the 1970s, and now in color. The Commercial Man can be seen in a toga, fanning the Commercial Woman, while she's in a bubble bath, in an advert for Hydra Soap.

The [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]] takes place in the 1980s, advertising Lagos paper towels. When the Commercial Man accidentally spills beer onto the counter, the Commercial Woman gives him a paper towel, rather than doing it herself, and the narrator states that husbands can use it too.

The [[Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision)|seventh episode]] takes place in the late 2000s/early 2010s, advertising Nexus Capsules. The Commercial Man works as a pharmacist, and provides the tablets to the Commercial Woman.
