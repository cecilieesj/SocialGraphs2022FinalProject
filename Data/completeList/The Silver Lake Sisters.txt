'''Dottie''', '''Dolly''' and '''Ethel''', AKA '''The Silver Lake Sisters''' are a group of [[Disney Parks]] characters affiliated with [[the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Silver Lake Sisters were a 1920s performing trio of sisters.  In addition to singing, the sisters each played an instrument (Dolly on violin, Dottie on flute, Ethel on piano), drawing a comparison between them and the [[The Three Little Pigs (characters)|Three Little Pigs]] as portrayed in the [[1933]] cartoon [[The Three Little Pigs|short of the same name]].  This resulted in the sisters developing the nicknames of '''''Fiddler, Fifer and Practical''''', named after the pigs from the cartoon.

The sisters spent a good part of their lives performing the vaudeville circuit, entertaining the troops in World War I and becoming minor celebrities in nightclubs along the then‐emerging Sunset Strip in [[Hollywood]].  Amongst the locations which they performed at were the the [[Tip Top Club]] of [[the Hollywood Tower Hotel]] and the [[South Seas Club]].

Ethel (Practical) had always handled the trio’s business affairs and was constantly urging her sisters to settle down and open a legitimate business.  Thus after 20 years of performance they decided to open a coffee shop called the [[Fiddler, Fifer & Practical Cafe|''Fiddler, Fifer & Practical Cafe'']] on [[Buena Vista Street]] in [[Los Angeles]].[[File:Ffffff873801.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Ethel Bounds]]It is unknown how or when the sisters died but at some point circa [[1994]], the sisters were seen once more in the Hollywood Tower Hotel. Strangely enough the sisters were still in their prime and believed it to still be the 1930s.  It is possible based off of this that the sisters were present at the hotel on the Halloween of [[1939]] when the Hotel was merged with the [[The 5th Dimension|5th dimension]] and became merged with the paranormal activity of the tower.
