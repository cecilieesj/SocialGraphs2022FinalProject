'''Dr. Hi​rano''' is a recurring character from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]] ''and is the mother of [[Stacy Hirano|Stacy]] and [[Ginger Hirano|Ginger]]. She removed [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]]'s tonsils ("[[I Scream, You Scream]]"). Dr. Hirano was first mentioned (and spoken of) when Stacy told [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] that she was getting her ears pierced.
==Relationships==
===[[Stacy Hirano]]===
Dr. Hirano is Stacy's mother. On Phineas and Ferb's Parents' Anniversary, they are only seen chatting on the phone ("[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]"). She also seems to think that her daughter is not very smart, due to Stacy frequently asking Candace to call her mom "and tell her that" when Candace refers to Stacy as a genius.

===[[Candace Flynn]]===
Dr. Hirano thinks Candace is flighty and unfocused because she rather bust her brothers than doing what she and Stacy are doing. However, she seems to think of her differently after seeing how determined she is to bust her brothers. She is also referred to Mrs. Hirano by her.

===[[Ginger Hirano|Ginger]]===
Dr. Hirano is the mother of Ginger. It's currently unclear how well Ginger gets along with her due to a lack of interaction.
