'''Wan Lo''' is the Ruler of the city of [[Panda-La]]. He only appears in the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode "[[Last Horizons]]".

==Role in the episode==
When [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] first enters the city, Wan Lo seems to greet him with open arms. Wan Lo shows Baloo around the city, and his people offer Baloo every courtesy imaginable. But despite their generosity, the Pandas act somehow cautious and reserved, as if they are harboring a secret. When Baloo heads home for [[Cape Suzette]], the city follows him back home.

It is then that the true nature of Wan Lo and his people is revealed, when the city is spotted and takes out Cape Suzette's cliff guns and defense squadron. Baloo is blamed for the invasion and decides to set right what has gone wrong. When Baloo confronts Wan Lo again, the Emperor's guards capture him and threaten to drop him to his doom. Wan Lo tells Baloo that his people live where they conquer, and that he has no need for any friends.

Baloo eventually manages to turn the tides by using Panda-La's own weaponry against them. The last that is ever seen of Wan Lo is when he escapes with his three children. Hence, his fate remains unknown, as does the fate of his people.
