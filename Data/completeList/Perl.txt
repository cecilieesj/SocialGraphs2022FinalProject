Zed shows her Able's office, where he has his vintage [[Light Cycles|light cycle]] [[Baton|baton]]. She tricks Zed again, this time asking him to take a look at her light cycle. He steals the vintage light cycle and Zed calls himself an idiot (to which [[Bit]] agrees). Zed, with [[Mara]]'s help, tracks Perl and the light cycle down to the docks where Gage, the leader of their gang, takes the cycle for a ride. When Mara and Zed take the cycle back, the gang chases them down on their own light cycles, but are ultimately arrested by [[Paige]].
