He appears in the "[[Rhapsody in Blue]]" sequence. He is often wishing to find a job, and in the end, he starts working the night shift at the construction site.

==Role in the film==
Joe is first seen in a caf√©, mulling over the newspaper, while drinking a cup of coffee. After checking his pockets, he finds out that he does not have any money. When a man who is leaving drops a coin, Joe tries to get his attention but when he fails, he decides to use the coin to pay for his order. Later while looking for a job, Joe walks by a fruit stand and sees that one of the apples has fallen off. Although he is hungry, he decides to put it back. However, a police officer who mistakenly thinks that Joe is stealing the fruit drives him away. During a montage where the characters are wishing for their dreams to come true, Joe fantasies about what it would be like to have a job. Near the end of the segment when [[Duke (Fantasia)|Duke]] decides to quit his job at the construction site, he throws away his jackhammer which coincidentally lands in Joe's arms. [[Duke (Fantasia)|Duke's]] boss sees him and hires him to work the night shift on the spot. Joe feels elated to have finally found a job. A few minutes later, while lowering a hook to pick up a bucket of bolts, Joe accidentally hooks [[Killjoy Margaret]], inadvertently making [[Flying John|Flying John's]] wish to be rid of her come true. He notices her hanging in the air but because he is so happily engrossed in his new job, he merely tips his helmet and continues working.
