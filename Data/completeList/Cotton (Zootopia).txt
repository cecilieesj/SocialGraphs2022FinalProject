==Background==

===Personality===
Cotton serves as Judy Hopps' favorite niece serving as a member of the Hopps family and is described as a sweet, loving rabbit. Not much of her personality is known as she doesn't speak much.

===Physical appearance===
Cotton has light-brown fur, green eyes, a blue shirt with a star on it, and a pale pink skirt.

==Appearances==
===''[[Zootopia]]''===
Cotton only appears at the beginning of the film where she is seen with the other rabbits present during [[Judy Hopps|Judy]]'s graduation ceremony. When Judy is assigned to Precinct One to become the first bunny cop, she is seen cheering for her aunt during her promotion.

Later when Judy sets off to leave [[Bunnyburrow]] to leave for [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]], Cotton stands next to [[Pop-Pop]] at Bunnyburrow just as  [[Bonnie and Stu Hopps]] give gifts for their daughter. Soon as Judy leaves the train leading to Zootopia, Cotton and the rest of the rabbits at the train station bid a farewell to Judy. She makes no further appearances after that.

==Trivia==
*Cotton's name is never mentioned in the film. However, the subtitles identify one such rabbit speaking her sole line "Bye, Judy! I love you!", hinting that this character is Cotton who said it.
