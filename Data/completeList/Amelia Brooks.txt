She would bring treats to her son's dentist practice where she helped managed the day-to-day activities. She called her son, Ted, Teddy Bear, as a sign of affection. She never told her son he was adopted because she thought he wouldn't love her and her husband the same way as if they were his biological parents. She conquered her fear of flying to come to Alaska to find her son after he went out in a blizzard to find his biological father, (who was white, much to her disbelief). For some reason, she was under the impression that Alaska wasn't part of the United States. She later attended her son's wedding to Barb.{{CharacterStub}}
