'''Blazebeak''' is a character who appears in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. He is an ancient wizard whom the Three Caballeros encounter in a magical pool at the Summoning Chamber located at Sheldgoose's Mansion at the [[New Quackmore]] Institute.

==Background==
As the creator of the [[Caballeros' Amulets]], Blazebeak is a powerful wizard whom the Caballeros encounter at a magical pool, albeit only his head is shown. When the Caballeros encounter him, he explains that his life force was bound to their amulets of the original Three Caballeros where he explains that the Three Caballeros must reincarnate themselves as the original Three Caballeros to be powerful enough to defeat Felldrake. Thanks to this, the Caballeros gained stronger power to defeat Felldrake and the plan to defeat him was successful.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]", an image of Blazebeak briefly appears after [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] (who was reborn into his baby form) tells his descendant [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] to set a timer to help stop the Caballeros where Sheldgoose himself reflects at the magical pool to which Felldrake tells his descendant to avoid reflecting at a magical pool. Later during the final battle against Felldrake (who evolved into his powerful monstrous form),  the Caballeros notice Xandra who is having trouble defeating him in his monstrous form, so the three reflect themselves and see an image of Blazebeak at the pool where Sheldgoose was staring at in the Summoning Chamber. As the three dive at the pool where Blazebeak is waiting (caused by [[Aracuan Bird|Ari]] who screamed at the Caballeros), he explains to the Caballeros that in order to triumph, the Caballeros must reincarnate themselves as the original Three Caballeros. Blazebeak explains to the Caballeros that his life force was bound to their amulets which have been protecting them, to which he devises a strategy that the amulets must be used in order to defeat Lord Felldrake the Terrible and save the world from the disaster he caused. He also explains to the Caballeros that if they fail, the universe will face disaster it has never seen and everything else will be destroyed. As a result, Blazebeak gives the Caballeros power to help them defeat Felldrake. The Caballeros then emerge from the pool while Ari scoops some water from Blazebeak's pool to heal Xandra who was weakened and thanks to Blazebeak's advice, the Caballeros and Xandra work together to defeat Felldrake in an attempt to send him back to the staff where he was trapped at but Sheldgoose himself broke the staff to save the world, restoring everything back to normal.
