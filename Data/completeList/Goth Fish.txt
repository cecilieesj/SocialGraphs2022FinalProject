[[File:TDSOTF11.jpg|thumb]]'''Goth Fish''' are a stereotype in [[Freshwater High]] from the show ''[[Fish Hooks]]''. Like most other high schools, these goth fish sit away from the crowd, wear black clothes, rarely talk except to each other and usually focus around death and dark images.

==The Group==
Goths date way far back possibly just as in Freshwater High. They like the darker side of things, and like to be secluded into their own group. They sit in the back of the class with each other. The leader of the Goth Fish is [[Razor V. Doom]], who makes meetings and leads the group ("[[Funny Fish]]", "[[The Dark Side of the Fish]]"). The members include [[Scabbo]], [[Bleak Molly]], and Goth Squid. [[Oscar the Fish|Oscar]] is known as one of the fish in the group, but later quits and chooses to be with his friends instead ("The Dark Side of the Fish").

==Background Information==
*The Goth Fish (except Bleak Molly) played the Freshwater's news show music.
