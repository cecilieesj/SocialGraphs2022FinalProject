'''Katy Chen''' (known in Mandarin as '''Chen Ruiwen''') is a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character who appears in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'', played by [[Awkwafina]]. She is [[Shang-Chi]]'s best friend, working as co-valet alongside Shang-Chi (going by "Shaun"). As the [[Ten Rings]] targets Shang, she gets accidentally pulled into the adventure, helping Shang protect his mother's village from [[Xu Wenwu|Wenwu]], from the Ten Rings, and from the {{WikipediaLink|Dweller-in-Darkness}} as an archer. Katy is quirky, but friendly and gentle.

== Trivia ==
*Katy is a fan of the American rock band, "{{WikipediaLink|Eagles (band)|The Eagles}}."
* Katy is a fan of retired four-time {{WikipediaLink|NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Cup Series}} champion {{WikipediaLink|Jeff Gordon}}.
