'''Skurge''', also known as '''the Executioner''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who is an [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] warrior. He appears as an antagonist in the film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', but reforms near the end.

Skurge was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''====
He was a boisterous Asgardian warrior who was made the new guardian of the Bifrost by [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki during]] his rule disguised as [[Odin Borson|Odin]] when the latter banished [[Heimdall]] for supposed treason. However, unlike Heimdall, Skurge was far less responsible and more laid-back about his job, going to Midgard/Earth many times and obtaining several things (namely two M18 rifles). At the beginning of the film, he is causally chatting to two maidens while boasting of being the Bifrost guardian and showing off his twin guns and other Earthly trinkets, unaware that Thor is summoning him (while he is in Muspelheim facing [[Surtur]]). However, after one of the ladies points this out, Skurge hastily opens the Bifrost and Thor comes through, unfortunately bringing the severed head of a dragon, splattering the room with it's blood. Scaring off the two maidens, Skurge annoyedly admonishes Thor over this, explaining Odin had put him in charge after banishing Heimdall. After Thor confronts Odin and reveals him to actually be Loki, Loki admonishes him for letting Thor back into Asgard to find him out. After that, Thor forces Loki to go to Earth with him to help find Odin.

Afterward, [[Fandral]] and [[Volstagg]] demoted him to janitor duty and took up the duty of opening the Bifrost. However, after Odin was found and died, [[Hela]], the Goddess of Death and his daughter, was released from imprisonment. She followed Thor and Loki through the Bifrost's tunnel and upon arriving in Asgard, promptly and swiftly murdered Fandral and Volstagg. Skurge immediately surrendered, and seeing potential use for him, Hela allowed him to live and told him to follow him. Hela eventually makes Skurge her the right-hand man and Executioner. 

Confronted by [[Hogun]] and the Einherjar, Hela challenged them and killed every warrior one by one, including Hogun.

===[[Marvel Animation]]===
====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====
The Executioner is the silent henchman of the Enchantress. When the [[Enchantress (Marvel)|Enchantress]] recruits [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Wonder Man]] to form the Masters of Evil, the Executioner is at her side.

The Executioner loses his axe in a fight with [[Hulk]]. When the Enchantress decides to dispose of the Masters of Evil, the Executioner assists her, now wielding two guns.

====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
Skurge is the leader of the Asgardian hunters during the boar hunt. When [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] causes [[Spider-Man]] to turn into Spider-Ham, he leads the hunters to catch him. However, when he has Spider-Ham at his mercy, the sundown marks the end of the boar hunt, so Skurge lets him go according to the hunting rules.
