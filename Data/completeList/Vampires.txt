==Appearances==
===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''===
Vampires first appeared during the song "[[This is Halloween]]". After the celebration, the [[Mayor of Halloween Town|Mayor]] announced they had won the award for the blood drained in a single evening. Upon the temporary departure of [[Jack Skellington]], they attempt to locate Jack within Halloween Town, with one of the brothers commenting at having looked for him behind the [[Cyclops (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Cyclop's]] eye. They are later among the various other Halloween Town residents during Jack's town meeting regarding information of Christmas.
Later during the song "[[Making Christmas]]" as the Halloween Town residents are making gifts, they were shown creating the vampire Duck Toy along with the Vampire Teddy bear, with the intention of these being toys for the children of [[Christmas Town]] to enjoy, unaware of their frightening nature to the children. Along with the other residents, they watch Jack's venturing as [[Santa Claus (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Santa Claus]] over Christmas Town through scrying the town well's waters, and are distraught upon his seeming demise. Upon Jack's return to Halloween Town, they are delighted to see him again, and are later shown playing croquet in the snow together, following Santa Claus snowy spell over Halloween Town.

==Video Games==
===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''===
A vampire appears in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King]]''.

===''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]''===
Vampire brothers appear in the video game ''The Nightmare before Christmas: Oogie's revenge'', after being transformed into their original bat forms by [[Oogie Boogie]]; they also possess the necessary pieces to access the Mayor's courtyard.

==Trivia==
*In ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' during the end of the film where the vampires are playing hockey, they originally used a severed head which is a cameo of the film's producer [[Tim Burton]] during this scene which was initially animated at first. For the final version of the film, it was instead replaced by a jack-o'-lantern to avoid a higher age rating at the last moment.
