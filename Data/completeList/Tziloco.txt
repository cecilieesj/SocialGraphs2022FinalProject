==Background==
===Powers and abilities===
Tziloco can use his wings to make a glowing imitation of anything as he made a [[Jaquins]] paw to get into [[Vallestrella]]. His wings are also able to sense the magic being used for tracking.

==Role in the series==
Tziloco is said to have used his magic to terrorize sailors for years.

Tziloco makes his first appearance in "[[Giant Steps]]", when he joins up with [[Ash Delgado|Ash]], [[Chancellor Esteban|Esteban]] and [[Chatana]]. They use his magic to enter [[Vallestrella]] where they plan to release Chatana's greatest monster, Kizin. As they make their way Tziloco's wings glow meaning he could sense someone using magic to locate them.

A mini sculpture of Tziloco made by Elena appears in "[[Elena's Day Off]]", along with Ash and Esteban.

In "[[Coronation Day]]", Tziloco is still with the rest of Ash's villainous group when she declares her intention to free the [[Four Shades of Awesome|Shadows of the Night]], who are imprisoned in the gateway to the Spirit World that is near Nueva Vista. Tziloco helps locate where the gateway is by finding a clue near Avalor, to which Chatana takes care of the rest and gives off its exact location. Esteban teleports them there, but just as Ash is about to release the Shadows, the group is confronted by Elena and her friends. After Ash blasts Mateo with her magic, Tziloco mocks him, only to be frozen into an ice statue by Antonia Bello and taken to Avalor alongside Chatana and Pili to be imprisoned in the dungeon.
