'''Son''' is a character who appears in the [[2018]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated short, ''[[Bao]]''. He is shown to be [[Mom (Bao)|Mom]]'s real son after it turns out that [[Dumpling (Bao)|Dumpling]] was not her real son.

==Background==
Son is a young adult man who resembles [[Dumpling (Bao)|Dumpling]] in the dream sequence. Just like what Dumpling wore in the dream sequence, Son wears a pair of glasses, a t-shirt and he has a small goatee on his chin. When Dad introduces Son to his mother, he tells him to talk to him to know where he went. Then, Son meets his mother and then happily reconciles with her as it is revealed that he is Mom's real son. After reconciling with Mom, Son attempts to make a dumpling by himself but his mother notices that he overfilled it with too much filling so his fiancée shows the two the perfectly-made dumplings she made.

==Appearances==
===''[[Bao]]''===
While often seeing being pictured in several portraits, Son does not appear until during the end of the short. When Dad sees his wife sulking all alone in her room, he introduces her son to his wife just as Dad tells him to talk to his mother. As the mother's real son arrives, he tells him to talk to her to know where he went. Upon encountering his mother, Son and his mother tearfully reunite and reconcile with each other eating pork buns together just as the mother and son share an embrace. The next day, Son is seen trying to make a dumpling for his family's lunch only for the dumpling he is making to be overfilled with too much filling just as his fiancée shows him and his mother the dumplings she made perfectly while Dad watches in approval.

During the epilogue, a montage is shown featuring Son and his mother picking the right watermelon while at a market, being taught how to stir fry just like his mother, followed by a family photo depicting an image of Son, his father, his mother, and his fiancée on it.

===Other appearances===
In ''[[The Simpsons in Plusaversary]]'', Son can be briefly seen in the crowd of other characters from various Disney properties attending the [[Disney+]] second anniversary party.
