==Background==
===Personality===
[[File:Stangfpolice.png|250px|Sheriff Blubs talking to Grunkle Stan.|thumb]]
Sheriff Blubs works with his deputy and partner, [[Deputy Durland]]. They are known as the lazy and sarcastic local law enforcement team who deem every case unsolvable so that they can go to lunch instead. He is seen as somewhat of an incompetent policeman throughout the series. He and Deputy Durland seem to like to do pointless activities instead of really working (ex. Running in broken fire hydrants without their shirts, eating pancakes as fast as they can, and watching "Steve" fit an entire cantaloupe in his mouth). Also, Sheriff Blubs does not like Dipper, calling him a "City Boy."

He is shown to be rather lazy, often choosing to sit around and drink coffee instead of pursuing a case. Despite his apparent lack of police skills, he believes himself superior to all, and often looks down on the twins, which undermines their mystery-solving abilities. His lazy personality seems to stem from the extremely low crime rate in Gravity Falls, which is demonstrated when Deputy Durland once comments on how unused their equipment is.

===Physical appearance===
Sheriff Blubs is a chubby African-American man with gray hair and a gray mustache, a light green shirt with a gold star Sheriff's Badge on it, and dark green pants, black boots, a yellow and black shoulder pad, a black belt with a gold oval on it and a hammer, a white vest, black sunglasses, and a yellow hat with a gold star and a black band on it.

==Role in the series==
He is first seen in the episode "[[The Legend of the Gobblewonker]]", alongside [[Deputy Durland]] in [[Lake Gravity Falls]]. Then they, alongside the crowd of people, laugh at [[Old Man McGucket]]'s explanation about the mysterious [[Gobblewonker]] destroying his boat. It is later shown that he and the Deputy catch [[Stan Pines|Grunkle Stan]], and give him a tracking device that he must wear.

He is next seen in "[[Headhunters]]." He is called to the crime scene when Wax Stan is murdered and declares the case unsolvable. When [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] volunteered to help solve the case, Blubs and Durland believe an adorable "city boy" like Dipper couldn't possibly solve the mystery. Blubs tells him he should leave the investigating to the grown-ups, then leaves with Durland to see a "23-16" (watch someone fit an entire cantaloupe in his mouth). Later Blubs and Durland raid [[Toby Determined]]'s Gravity Falls Gossiper when Dipper accuses him of being the murderer; however, he is innocent.

Later, after Dipper successfully defeats the wax men, Blubs and Durland come to the Mystery Shack, and Blubs tells Dipper he's confident he couldn't solve the case and takes a long sip of his coffee. When Dipper informs him that he had solved the case, the sheriff spews his drink into Durland's face, causing them both to drive away and crash. Blubs is a huge fan of Lil' Gideon. He went to the [[Tent of Telepathy]] on the same night as Mabel, Dipper, and Soos to watch his show. During the music number, Gideon sensed that he had been there before, given by the huge amount of merchandise the Sheriff had bought.

He appears in "[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]" at the Greasy's Diner. Using a radar gun, Durland records how fast Blubs can eat pancakes. He is later seen in downtown when one of the fire hydrants is destroyed. Blubs and Durland decide to take off their uniforms and run around the fire hydrant in circles, rather than solving the mystery.

In the episode "[[Irrational Treasure]]", Blubs and Durland are the announcers of the ceremony at Pioneer Day. When an elderly lady in the crowd's purse is stolen, the Sheriff pays more attention to Deputy Durland ringing his bell. Later on in the episode, a mysterious man gives the Sheriff and his Deputy orders to apprehend Dipper and Mabel before they can discover Gravity Falls' secret: that it was founded by the embarrassing 8Â½ President, Quentin Trembley.

Later, Blubs and Durland successfully catch Dipper and Mabel by following the trail of candy wrappers Mabel accidentally leaves behind. The Sheriff tells them that finding Trembley's body is his and Durland's special mission, and now that they found it, they can't let Dipper and Mabel talk about it with anyone. They decide to escort Dipper and Mabel to [[Washington, D.C.]], along with the rest of the evidence of Trembley's existence. They then attempt to halt Trembley, Mabel, and Dipper's escape. They corner the trio on top of the train. However, Trembley, realizing that he is technically president, orders the Sheriff and Deputy to cease, and take a vacation, an order which they readily follow. Blubs appears in "[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]", riding the Ferris Wheel with Deputy Durland at the Mystery Fair. He reappears in "[[Summerween]]", dressed up as Deputy Durland while trick-or-treating.

In "[[The Deep End]]", Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland first appear at the Gravity Falls Pool. When Durland puts sunscreen on Blubs' back, Wendy tosses a rescue buoy at the two cops, which scares them and prevents them from moving. They are later seen sleeping inside their police car at night. When Dipper is chasing Mabel through the town in a golf cart, Blubs and Durland get awakened by the noise the vehicles were making. They are oblivious to the fact that the twins are speeding, as Durland comments that the sound was probably from their dream.

In "[[Boyz Crazy]]", Blubs and Durland arrest Ergman Bratzman for not having a rear license plate on his car.

In "[[Land Before Swine]]", Blubs and Durland are sitting in a police car trying to finish a maze puzzle, before the pterodactyl rips the roof off of the car.

==Trivia==
*In 2002, Blubs had a large afro.
