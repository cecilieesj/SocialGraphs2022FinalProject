}}'''Oviraptor''' is a species of theropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Cretaceous period 75 million years ago. It appeared as a minor predator in [[Walt Disney Studios|Disney]]'s [[2000]] CGI film, ''[[Dinosaur]]'' and made a cameo in ''[[Fantasia]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
Oviraptor had a cameo appearance in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''Fantasia''. It appears near the end of the segment, among the dinosaurs going extinct due to dehydration and starvation.

===''[[Dinosaur]]''===
Sometime after a [[Carnotaurus|Carnotaur]] chased off all the other dinosaurs and wrecked the [[Nesting Grounds|nesting sites]], an Oviraptor suddenly appears and tries to look for any eggs that have been left by the plant-eating dinosaurs. The theropod takes a sudden interest in [[Aladar]]'s egg left unharmed and intact from the destruction. Knowing that the Carnotaur is almost a few feet away, the Oviraptor decides to steal the egg and hurries off into the jungle. Before it could start eating the egg, another Oviraptor swipes it from its grasp. The Oviraptor starts brawling the other one for the egg, but their fingers eventually start losing their grip onto the egg as it falls down into the river below. They resume their fight with each other after losing the egg. They are not seen again for the remainder of the movie.

==Trivia==
[[File:Screenshot 2019-09-29-16-14-30.png|thumb|250px|Alveresaurus concept art by Ricardo Delgado.]]
*Although Oviraptor is depicted as a dinosaur adapted for eating unborn hatchlings, this theory is in fact inaccurate. A dinosaur nest discovered by scientists in [[1924]] in [[Mongolia]] was thought to be a [[wikipedia:Protoceratops|Protoceratops]]' nest, and nearby existed a carnivore which was named Oviraptor. Later, in the [[1990]]s, they examined the embryos and discovered that the supposed Protoceratops babies were actually Oviraptor babies. This shows that Oviraptor was a good parent, but there is still a debate whether it actually stole eggs for specific purposes. Also, Oviraptor had feathers.
*Giant Oviraptors are known to have existed; eggs have been found belonging to them, and skeletons belonging to the enormous [[wikipedia:Gigantoraptor|Gigantoraptor erlianensis]] have been uncovered in the Gobi Desert.
*The Oviraptor in ''[[Fantasia]]'' had the appearance of an [[wikipedia:Ornithomimidae|Ornithomimid]], albeit with a small horn on its head. This is because at the time the film was made, Oviraptor was classified as an Ornithomimid.
*Originally there was going to be an Alvarezsaurus in Disney's Dinosaur, having the role of egg thieves that the Oviraptors have in the film.
