'''Galt''' is a young program from the [[Disney XD]] series ''[[Tron: Uprising]]''. In "[[Identity]]", Galt steals [[Beck]]'s [[Identity Disc]] and sells it. When [[Beck]], [[Tron (character)|Tron]], and [[Lux (Tron: Uprising)|Lux]] go to a club, they see Galt and chase him down a hallway. A hand with a disc breaks through the wall and derezzes Galt.
