===[[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|''A Wrinkle in Time'']]===
Meg is introduced as the daughter of the Murry family where her father tells her to make a wish upon seeing a shooting star in the sky, where she has a hard time adapting her life in the real world, to which her father tells her that nobody hates her despite her troubled adaptability, telling her to think patiently and her father says that whenever she needs him, he will be in her heart while listening to him just as her mother tells her to return home. Upon returning home, she narrates to herself about her troubled life living with her family, narrating that both of her parents were brilliant scientists while passing through the twins Sandy and Dennys playing foosball together just as Meg explains that she wished that her missing father would come back. Meg then describes Sandy and Dennys adapting their lives to each other, despite them being happy and obnoxious, while describing Charles being new to the family.

The next day during a lesson about neurons at the Westover Community School, Meg stares at [[Mrs. Whatsit]] in her crow form outside the window, feeling distracted upon seeing the crow tap the window just as her teacher, Mr. Porter, tells her to know what the human brain is about just as Meg gives her teacher details about what the brain is about to which Mr. Porter cuts her off explaining the false information about the brain she asked for during class, telling her to report to detention. During detention, Meg talks with her principal as she tells him that her teacher gets the info wrong all the time. The principal explains to her that there is nothing to be ashamed explaining that when one adult disappoints her, Meg cannot take it out on all the rest. Meg denies that the principal doesn't care to which the principal convinces about what her father did before his disappearance. Meg mournfully leaves the principal's office and sulks outside the school. Thereupon, she encounters a group of bullies being rude to her and Charles Wallace just as [[Calvin O'Keefe]] arrives to tell them to stop pestering them. While walking across the woods, Meg tells Charles that if he talks to other people outside the family, people wouldn't think he was acting strange.

When Meg returns home, she meets her mother researching a new school for her, known as Again, explaining that the Happy Medium would meet her one day. That night, the same crow pecking on the school window meets Meg again just as she flies away. Meg then talks Charles about her encounter with the crow while she discusses about her difficulties in adapting with other people while Charles tries to introducer Meg and her mother to Mrs. Whatsit just as the family's dog, Fort, hears thunder outside. Charles then tries to introduce Mrs. Whatsit to Meg and her mother, to which the two don't know who she is. Later, the crow outside is revealed to be Mrs. Whatsit where she has a conversation with Meg's family inside the house just as she explains to Dana that there is one such thing in the real world as a tesseract just before she leaves and transforms back to her crow form.

The next day, Meg's mother leaves the house just she tells them to stay indoors while she is gone. Despite this, Meg and Charles leave the house and try to search for Mrs. Whatsit, trying to figure out what a tesseract is. The two encounter an abandoned cottage as Meg tries to talk to the crow who is confused to be Mrs, Whatsit, but it is in fact a real crow, just before Meg and Charles leaves as a pair of glasses watches them leave. Returning home, Meg later sees Calvin riding on his bike just as Calvin is invited to go inside. That night later on, Meg watches a flashback of her playing with her father at the playground before his unfortunate disappearance to which the video goes static after that only to find out that Mrs. Whatsit's face is appearing on screen, warning the two that Charles and Meg's father needs him before he is lost forever.

With Calvin joining in, Meg and Charles hold each other's hands while being guided by Mrs. Whatsit as she transports the three to the magical planet Camazotz as the three hold each other together to arrive at the planet with the power of the tesseract. Upon arriving at planet Malik's third star Uriel, which is at the planet Malik, Whatsit explains to Meg that it was the tesseract that brought her, Charles and Calvin to the planet. As the trio picks up the blue flowers, Meg and the rest board on Mrs. Whatsit in her Pegasus-like creature form and look at the distant darkness that senses a great danger to the universe if not stopped. That night, Meg discusses with Calvin, explaining that the three Mrs. Ws haven't decided to know if they would hold Meg and the rest of her group as hostages.

During a conversation with the three Mrs. Ws the next day, Meg and the rest of the children look at a vision of the Solar System where it is shown that her father is lost at the planet Camazotz and was vulnerable to the power of darkness, because he stumbled upon the tesseract without understanding it carefully as it is also known that many warriors triumphed over many battles at that time. Meg then asks Mrs. Whatsit about Charles going alone to which she explains to her that this is the reason why they sent the three to the magical planet as Charles alone cannot defeat evil. She sends Calvin and Charles to a nearby cave to find the Happy Medium who would help the two on their journey, followed by Meg joining in. As Meg, Charles, and Calvin plan seek the Happy Medium on their journey, the three travel very far into the cave with assistance from Mrs. Whatsit. During their journey, the three encounter glowworms which helped the three give them light just as the three find the Happy Medium. After learning about Mrs. Murry sad for her husband's loss, it leads Meg, Charles, and Calvin to travel to the planet Camazotz to find Mr. Murry, her mother's husband, via tesseract.

At the planet Camazotz with help from Mrs. Which, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Whatsit, Meg, alongside Calvin and Charles wandering around the deserted place where a vicious being known as It watches over them. The three then arrive at a local neighborhood to which the three find everything strange in the Camazotz neighborhood. Arriving at a movie house, the three discover many merchandise related to It, who rules over Camazotz at the Central Central Intelligence headquarters as a local Camazotz resident girl points the trio to It's headquarters. After discussing with a Camazotz resident teen about It, Meg, Charles, and Calvin approach the Central Central Intelligence headquarters to face It.

Arriving at the headquarters, Meg, alongside Charles and Calvin, enter Room K07 without filling the forms required to access by following an agent nearby without getting caught by the security guards. Noticing that the security guards placed Calvin into a room where a lab employee gives Calvin a hallucination of his basketball dream, Meg and Charles find lab coats in order to enter the lab to which Meg tells him to snap out of it as this hallucination is a trap to which Charles manages to help rescue him from this trap. Having rescued Calvin, the three continue their mission to find Meg's father to which upon noticing that they cannot escape, Meg sees an image nearby believing it is his missing father where he attempts to enter but is unable to. Meg shouts for her father's name to which Calvin tells her that her father could be anywhere. Calvin tells Meg to be patient and think calmly before she causes more problems by remembering what Mrs. Whatsit said to which Meg puts on Mrs. Who's glasses and is able to access the image where her father is at.

As Meg enters the room via tesseract, she finally finds her father inside to which she tells him to remember her to which she didn't recognize her at first to which he suddenly recognizes his daughter. Megs tells her father that his son Charles is with Calvin, Meg's friend from school. After explaining her long story to her father, she gives him the glasses provided by Mrs. Who so that the two of them can escape together and arrive at the spot where Calvin and Charles are at to which the moment is disrupted when It enters, where he separates the platforms between Charles Wallace's allies and Charles himself. Suddenly, Charles, under control by the Man with Red Eyes, puts Meg midair, much to Calvin's worry about Meg in trouble just as Calvin tells Jack to put on Mrs. Who's pair of glasses to save Meg from the tyranny of It. Meg attempts to escape with her father and Calvin, but suddenly gets separated from the two where Calvin and Meg's father end up at Ixchel via tesseract.

Meg, her father, and Calvin find themselves in a planet of healing and understanding known as "Ixchel" where she is found by a mysterious Ixchel alien who rescues her from the frigid weather to keep her warm while she discusses with her father about leaving Charles Wallace behind, to which Aunt Beast, the alien keeping her warm. comforts her as she tells Meg not to fear about losing hope. As Calvin approaches her, she discusses about not giving up in trying to rescue Charles Wallace from It. Calvin then explains to Meg about the powerful darkness from Camazotz which attacked Meg while in the tesseract as explained by Aunt Beast herself. Beast then approaches Meg who understands her frustrations of rescuing Charles from the Man with Red Eyes to which as Meg talks to the alien, she explains to her that on Ixchel, the residential aliens just like Aunt Beast, they "feel that things not as they seem but they are" just as she tells Meg to lend her a hand.

Later, Meg finds herself in the real world where she finds out that she has trouble seeing her family. Now alone, Meg looks across the letters by her house to which Meg stares at another Meg to which the other Meg in her mind berates her for being hopeless and useless to which it is known that Meg is practicing to look for anything that is unseen as part of Aunt Beast's advice. Back at Ixchel, Aunt Beast explains to Meg that the only way to fight the darkness and defeat It and all of his evil forces is to discover all that is unseen. She also explains to Meg that all things that can be seen are temporary while all things that cannot be seen are eternal, telling her to take time and concentrate to know that what she seeks is like music so that Meg would be able to find anything that cannot be seen. Being tasked to find anything unseen, Meg wanders across the chamber and encounters Mrs. Which who tells her that she, her father, and her friends must return to Earth while she, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Whatsit will take care of Charles Wallace. 

While discussing with her, she explains to Which that she herself cannot lose faith with her friends, explaining that she sticks together with her friends with loyalty to which Mrs. Which explains to her to know if loyalty is the one causing her to be furious and other problems she had with her friend Calvin and her father while trying to rescue Charles Wallace to which while discussing a plan how to rescue Charles, the reflection of Mrs. Which suddenly disappears just as she appears physically in front of her, explaining that trying to explain that Charles Wallace from the Man with Red Eyes is not going to be easy, much to Meg explaining to her that Charles is still her brother while Meg tries to ask Mrs. Which to know if she remembers any of Charles' moments to which she explains that she has never experienced human passion before in a strange universe just as she studies Meg being very curious about Charles just as Mrs. Which hopes that Charles could be rescued and returned home just before Meg leaves.

Meg meets Calvin again who loses faith about losing Charles to which while talking with him, she explains to her friend that there is something he is afraid of to which Calvin shares his fear of not being like Meg to which Meg explains to her friend that she is now afraid of losing faith in trying to rescue Charles Wallace. Later when Meg returns to her father alongside Calvin, Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who appear in front of the Meg, her father, and Calvin where they discuss with the three about the possibility of reuniting Charles back to his family to which it is explained that grace could be the only way to fulfill their mission in defeating It and his powerful forces.

After remembering what Mrs. Whatsit said to the three, Mr. Murry tells his daughter to be herself in order to cheer her up to which Meg's father happily embraces his daughter, followed by Calvin happily praising Meg just before she approaches Aunt Beast. However, Mrs. Which explains to Meg that she prided much on her wisdom, but she has taught her much, followed by Mrs. Who explaining to Meg not to give up faith in herself in order to accomplish her plans of defeating the Man with Red Eyes and rescuing Charles. As Meg encounters Aunt Beast who embraces her, she sees Mrs. Whatsit behind her where she explains to her that she feels happiness in her mind, which the darkness does not have to which she explains that only her faith that she is to find for herself just as Meg travels back to Camazotz again via tesseract in order to help her save Charles and finish her goal in defeating the Man with Red Eyes.

After Meg returns back to Camazotz at Central Central Intelligence, Meg arrives at the spot where Charles Wallace (under control by the Man with Red Eyes) who is serving It at a dining room Meg confronts It where he offers a strawberry banana smoothie to Meg to which she rejects his offer. Later while confronting It, Meg warns Charles that It is the one talking to him and putting him under control to which Meg faces It. While planning to free Charles, Meg begins counting the numbers the elements of the periodic table from one to thirteen in order to which a vision of Calvin suddenly appears to distract Charles and get him out of It's influence. Meg approaches Charles again who now finally understands what Meg is really saying about the bad influences from It to which Meg suddenly hugs Charles to help him escape from It, much to his rage.

Returning to the real world with Charles Wallace (actually an illusion), Meg approaches her mother who is happy to see Meg back after not seeing her for a long time, alongside Charles Wallace to which while Meg's mother is preparing pineapple for Charles Wallace, he recaps about his adventures through the power of tesseract. Meg then explains to her mother about what really happened to her father to which Meg starts to realize that everything around Meg in this dimension is not real. It is then known that Meg's return to the real world so that she can reunite with her mother with Charles Wallace back was actually an illusion after not explaining of what is wrong with her as Meg finds herself again at Camazotz to which when Meg catches the chalk tossed by It, she finds herself in the Westover Community School. Thereupon, the Man with Red Eyes confesses with Meg, telling her that everybody has quality and everyone is alike to which Meg denies, explaining that like and equal are not the same thing, just as Meg explains to Charles Wallace that anything that It told him has never been the real truth just as she finds herself at Camazotz again.

Still being cornered by the Man with Red Eyes, Meg attempts to convince Charles Wallace that she loves him but he refuses to listen to her trust. Meg tries hard again to explain to Charles that she loves him so much to which the Man with Red Eyes starts reacting to Charles following Meg's advice to which the Man with Red Eyes warns him that Meg is a threat to him, Meg explains to Charles that he is her baby brother and after Charles finally trusts Meg, where Meg explains that she loves him to which Charles accepts, defeating the Man with Red Eye, It's agent, gets knocked into the pipeline, defeating him and It itself.

With It finally defeated, Meg tells the Camazotz locals that they are now free from It's control, telling them that no one will hurt them, even without It. Meg and Charles Wallace leave Camazotz and travel to the real world via tesseract where the two of them return, along with Meg's father, and Meg's friend Calvin. Meg's mother suddenly feels happy that she finally gets to see Meg and Charles Wallace back along with her husband after not seeing them for a long time where Meg's mother suddenly reunites with her daughter after being reunited with her husband. Suddenly, the three helpful Mrs. Ws appear in front of Meg's mother just as the three praise them for giving them much what Meg expected, just as the there Mrs. Ws leave. After the three Mrs. Ws leave, Calvin approaches Meg who explains to her about what she did to save Charles Wallace to which Meg couldn't explain about what she did to save Charles to which she explains to him that love was the one which saved Charles as she and Calvin calmly observe a quiet, starry night.
