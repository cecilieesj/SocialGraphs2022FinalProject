'''Troodon''' ("wounding tooth") appeared in [[The Rite of Spring|the Rite of Spring]] segment from Disney's ''[[Fantasia]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
It was seen attacking an [[Archaeopteryx]]. While many viewers assume it was an Ornitholestes, the scripts confirm that it's a ''Troodon''. Also in the film, ''Troodon'' is depicted as having a domed head and a pair of horns, since at that time it was assumed to be a Pachycephalosaur.

==Trivia==
*Troodon was most closely related to dromaeosaurs like [[Velociraptor]] and is a member of the Troodontidae.
*Troodon had the largest brain proportionate to body size of any dinosaur.
*Like [[Velociraptor]], Troodon had killing claws on its feet for dispatching and restraining prey.
*In real life, Troodon was covered in feathers.
*In a [[2017]] review of Troodontidae, it was revealed that ''Troodon formosus'' was the type species. Whether or not it's based on a tooth is dubious. Most specimens have been transferred to other genera.
