}}'''Doctor Frankenollie''' is a mad scientist that appeared in the [[1995]] short ''[[Runaway Brain]]''. He attempts to switch the brain of his monster, [[Julius]], with that of [[Mickey Mouse]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Runaway Brain]]''===
Frankenollie puts an ad in the newspaper promising to pay his employer $999 and 99 cents. Mickey answers the ad and heads over to the address. Mickey is sucked into an underground laboratory and captured. Frankenollie then informs Mickey of his sadistic plan; to switch his brain with that of his monster Julius. During the brain switch, he attaches helmets to their heads and activates a switch while laughing manically causing a large explosion. Mickey awakes to find himself in Julius' body and finds a charred Frankenollie and tells him to change him back but it is too late as the doctor was killed in the explosion and disintegrates in Mickey's hands.

===Other appearances===
Dr. Frankenollie was utilized in an Online Safety Flash comic series titled "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134256/http://www.disney.co.uk/DisneyOnline/Safesurfing/cybernetiquette/netiquette2/index.html Cybernettiquette] " to represent those who make trouble on the internet by creating computer viruses.
