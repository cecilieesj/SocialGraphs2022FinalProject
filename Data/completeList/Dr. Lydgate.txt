|quote = }}'''Dr. Lydgate '''is a character featured on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. He makes his first appearance is "[[Down the Rabbit Hole]]" and was [[Alice]]'s psychiatrist when she was sent to the asylum. He is portrayed by Johnny Coyne.

== History ==

=== Before the First Curse ===
Dr. Lydate arrives after being called by Edwin, whose daughter Alice has returned after a long period of time. Hearing the stories Alice told Edwin, he tells him that he can cure his delusional daughter.

=== After the First Curse ===
Years later, Dr. Lydgate is once again called by Edwin, sent to retrieve a now grown [[Alice]] to take her to the asylum.

Dr. Lydgate interrogates Alice on her disappearance in [[Wonderland]], believing it to be a fantasy her mind created. Although she denies having been there at all, Dr Lydgate is able to see through her act, and offers her a procedure that will take away her pain and memories of Wonderland and all those that she met there. After Alice signs a form, giving sanction for the procedure to take place, he tells her to rest for whats to come.

After preparing the necessary tools for the procedure, he finds Alice breaking out of the asylum with the accomplice of a [[Will Scarlet|man]]. He tries to talk her out of leaving, though is stunned to find a [[White Rabbit|talking rabbit]] next to her, and stands in shock as the trio leave.

Later on while working in the asylum, Dr. Lydgate is greeted by [[Jafar]] (under the alias Dr. Sheffield) who asks on information regarding Alice. Claiming to not know any patient of that name, Jafar confronts him with the White Rabbit, which Dr. Lydgate is horrified to see, having been trying to forget about it, since the day Alice broke out. Dr. Lydgate begs for Jafar to put it away, who does so, but asks for information regarding Alice, which he gives.

==Trivia==
*Lydgate is the second of three antagonistic psychiatrists to have the care of Alice in ''Alice in Wonderland'' adaptations. The first is Dr. Angus Bumby from the videogame ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice:_Madness_Returns Alice: Madness Returns]'', and the third one was Dr. Bennet from ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''.
