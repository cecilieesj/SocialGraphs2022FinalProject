==Trivia==
*In the X-Men comics and TV shows, he was the best friend of his fellow mutant Charles Xavier, aka [[Professor X]]. Both visionaries for mutantkind, they later became unfortunate rivals as their visions greatly differed. Xavier believed in coexistence between mutants and humanity, whereas Magneto believes in mutant supremacy, wishing to subjugate humans, under the belief that humanity will soon do the same to mutants. This is the driving force between their rivalry.
*In the comics, Magneto was the father of [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver]], with both having allied with him off-and-on in his quest for mutant supremacy. However, with their introduction into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and Fox having possessed the film rights to the character, Magneto's position as Wanda and Pietro's father was removed for the MCU. However, the ''X-Men'' introduce their own version of Quicksilver starting in the 2014 film ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'', where their familial relationship is intact.
