}}'''Ethyl Phillips''' is a supporting character from the [[1991]]-[[1994]] television series, ''[[Dinosaurs]]''.

==Role in the series==
Ethyl Phillips is the 72-year-old Edmontonia, wheelchair-bound mother of [[Frances Sinclair|Fran]] who moved in with the Sinclairs after the episode "[[Hurling Day]]". After being persuaded by [[Robbie Sinclair|Robbie]] and Fran that she does not have to go through with Hurling Day (and tantalized by the prospect of making [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]]'s life a continual misery), she becomes a permanent member of the Sinclair household.

She regularly takes swipes at Earl with her cane and often calls him "Fat Boy". ''Hurling Day'' was her first (chronologically) episode, but her first-taped appearance was "[[Employee of the Month]]", in which she comes to visit the Sinclair home. In one episode, we learn that she also has a son named Stan.
