'''Blanky''' is a yellow electric heating blanket who appears in the [[1987]] animated film, ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' and [[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue|its]] [[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars|sequels]].

==Personality==
Blanky is overly sensitive and gets upset very easily. He loves snuggling up to the other appliances, as seen in the first movie, although they all initially reject him. [[Toaster]] eventually warms up to Blanky and they both become fast friends, as do [[Lampy]] and [[Radio]]. Even [[Kirby]] softens up near the end of the film and becomes good friends with Blanky and the other appliances in the film's sequels.

==Relationships==
Blanky forms a close friendship with Toaster near the middle of the first film when he was in danger. Lampy and Radio also start to like and respect Blanky as well. Kirby's feelings toward Blanky don't change much until near the end of the film, but he is kind and loyal to Blanky in the movie's sequels.

==Trivia==
*Blanky is voiced by a woman in most foreign dubs, including [[France|French]], Polish, [[Italy|Italian]], Czech, Finnish, and [[Japan]]ese. He is also voiced by a man in the Hungarian and Serbian dubs.
*Blanky's weak, cowardly, emotional personality contrasts Toaster's strong, brave, tough personality.
*There is a cameo of Blanky and friends in the series ''{{WikipediaLink|The Oz Kids}}'' in the episode "Christmas in Oz".
*In the original sketches, Blanky didn't have his knob-like nose.
*Blanky becomes a little less of a coward in the film's sequels, while still keeping his snuggly emotional personality.
*Timothy E. Day was replaced by [[Eric Lloyd]] as the voice of Blanky in the sequels, due to his voice getting deeper as he grew older.
