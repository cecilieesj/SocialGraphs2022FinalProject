'''Granny Kincaid''' is a character who appears in the [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film, ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]''.
Â 
==Background==
Granny serves as [[Jeremiah Kincaid]]'s tough yet loving grandmother. At first, she felt harsh on Jeremiah on caring more about himself and [[Danny (So Dear to My Heart)|Danny]]; however, she misunderstood about her grandson's love for his lamb and his desire to help him win the grand prize at the Pike County Fair, being firm with her grandson telling him to do what she tells him. However, when she reconciles with her grandson, she became forgiving as a misunderstanding for being tough with him and later kept her promise in taking Jeremiah and his cousin [[Tildy]] to the fair.

==Role in the film==
Granny is first seen using her horse General Jackson who is helping plow the field just before the train Old 99 arrives containing a private car for the champion horse Dan Patch. Later that night when her grandson [[Jeremiah Kincaid|Jeremiah]] returns home, Granny is seen busy doing her spinning wheel only for her to be disturbed by a restless Jeremiah complaining about replacing General Jackson with a better horse or mule to which Granny warns him that she doesn't want to hear about her grandson's negative comments about General Jackson, telling Jeremiah to get back to bed as well as telling him to count sheep so he can sleep peacefully. Commenting about the lambs in their pen, Jeremiah follows his grandmother to a pen where the little lambs were recently born. Jeremiah then checks on Jezebel's pen seeing three newborn lambs which his grandmother happily comments on the lambs just as she tells her grandson to give her a pitchfork only for Jeremiah to see a black lamb named Danny that was recently born which Jeremiah reacts in excitement.

Jeremiah shows his grandmother Jezebel's newborn twins and upon showing the lamb with black coloration, Jeremiah attempts to feed Danny some milk to which Jezebel refuses. Granny then offers Jeremiah a blanket for the newborn black sheep to keep him warm just as she tells him that he must understand that every animal has a different behavior, especially when it comes to sheep. Jeremiah then follows his grandmother who tells him to give her a flour sack to feed the little lamb only to find Jeremiah in the living room, telling him that to keep the lamb warm, he must take him near a fireplace to keep him warm. Soon as Jeremiah keeps the lamb warm near the fireplace, Granny tells her grandson that there will come time that there will come that the sheep which Jeremiah loves cannot be kept in the Kincaid family household anymore.

The next day, Granny notices Danny rushing across the countryside she feels upset about the damage Danny is doing to the Kincaid family's house, deciding to put him in the sheep pen, much to Granny feeling upset about Jeremiah for neglecting the chores of caring the garden or piling the wood for the winter with [[Danny (So Dear to My Heart)|Danny]] being a nuisance. Later during a conversation with Hiram, Granny explains to him about Danny's bad reputation which Hiram denies, convincing her that Jeremiah is putting him under control which she notices Danny running across the field only to stop near some crops. Granny then explains to Jeremiah that Mr. Turner will take Danny away so that he will find a home so that he can take good care of the sheep just as Granny tells Jeremiah that she didn't say he can '''keep''' the lamb but rather '''see''' him, just as she feels upset if Jeremiah is deaf if he understood what she told him only to find Jeremiah out of his room just as she finds Jeremiah sleeping with Danny on a patch of hay at the barn.

The next day, Granny calmly sits on her rocking chair during the "[[Lavender Blue (Dilly, Dilly)]]" sequence listening to [[Uncle Hiram]] singing. Granny then sings to Hiram the song "[[Billy Boy]]" while Jeremiah and his cousin are attracted to the singing. Granny later explains to her grandson to know if he has a notion about taking Danny to the county fair which Hiram denies, explaining to her that anyone at Pike County who participates would win a blue ribbon and a cash award. After dancing, Granny tells the children to tidy up everything and explains to Jeremiah the details he doesn't understand yet; she then explains to her grandson that going into the county fair is not free and so is the train taking people there to which her grandson tries to convince her if she would agree to take him to which she explains to him that he has to have hope and faith that Danny would win there just before going to bed.

The next day, Granny is looking for Tildy who is lost in the woods and approaching her grandson with his Uncle Hiram, Jeremiah attempts to show his grandmother the money he received from [[Pete Grundy]] for harvesting the honey from a cottonwood tree, which Granny warns him that Tildy was out in the wood trying to catch Danny throughout a wild chase at the forest which Jeremiah then takes risk of himself in finding his pet sheep throughout the wild chase only for [[Tildy]] to encounter her and Uncle Hiram. Granny then decides to take Tildy home for safety. That night, Granny decides to look for Jeremiah across the woods who is looking for Danny who has gone missing to which her grandson reunites with her, much to Jeremiah's worry over losing Danny just as Granny decides to take him home for safety.

At home, Granny discusses with Jeremiah that Danny may have survived the storm, explaining to her grandson that all he can do is hope for the best, telling him to be ready for anything unexpected which could happen which Jeremiah denies, telling his grandmother that his sheep is still around. Granny then claims that it was her fault, in being extremely tough to her grandson, discussing to Jeremiah that he turned away from the things she has taught her ever since he was a baby. She then recaps to her grandson that he loved his pet sheep, explaining that she allowed him to keep him, despite his bad reputation as well as discussing the importance of true love, claiming that all he thinks is about himself. Jeremiah's grandmother tells her grandson to do what is right just before her grandmother leaves.

The next day, Uncle Hiram discusses with Granny, explaining that he has no luck in finding Jeremiah nor Danny, which Granny replies to him that there are more ways than being lost in the woods only to find out that Jeremiah and his pet sheep Danny are alive all along with Granny happy to see her grandson back. Uncle Hiram then asks Granny to know if she should take Jeremiah and Tildy to the county fair, to which Granny replies to Hiram that it won't make much difference. She then approaches her grandson explaining that he changed his mind in taking Danny to the county fair which she replies that she made a promise to take the children to the fair which Jeremiah reconciles with her just as he decides to clean him before taking him to the fair.

Later, Granny arrives at the county fair, explaining to Jeremiah that only one sheep will be ranked as the Champion Ram Lamb of the Pike County Fair. She then watches the sheep contest where each participator's sheep is being chosen by the judge to know which one is ranked as champion which Danny is chosen as the winner. She later returns to Fulton Corners alongside the rest of Jeremiah's family feeling happy of Jeremiah whose pet sheep has won the contest which Pete Grundy offers Jeremiah and the rest of the townsfolk a celebration for him and his pet sheep at the mercantile store.
