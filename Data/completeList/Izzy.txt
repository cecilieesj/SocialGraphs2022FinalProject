'''Izzy''' is one of [[Cubby|the two deuteragonists]] of [[Disney Junior]]'s [[2011]]-[[2016]] animated television series, ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''.

==Personality==
Izzy is a young, feisty pirate girl who has the ability to fly due to her [[Pixie Dust]] given to her by the [[Disney Fairies|fairies]]. She is beautiful and just as adventurous as [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and [[Cubby]]. She loves puzzles, music, and of course singing and dancing. She seems to be the brightest member of the trio. She treats animals like her children and cares for them. She is also part of Jake's crew on their pirate ship [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]].

Izzy treats [[Cubby]] like a sibling and cares for him deeply. She thinks of [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] as an older brother and more than a friend at the same time. Izzy shares some traits with Tinker Bell most notably her feisty attitude. Izzy believes that with only practice you will achieve a goal showing that she's a hardworking and strong-willed pirate.

Izzy shows a small fear of [[Captain Hook]] but does not let it get in the way of her and her friends saving the day. She is not afraid to stand up to Hook and shows her anger when he betrays them and steals from them. Izzy and [[Mr. Smee]] rarely communicate but they seem to be more acquaintances like enemies. Smee is just as kind to Izzy as he is to [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and [[Cubby]].

==Physical appearance==
Izzy is a young girl with a very slender figure. She has long, dark brown hair tied back into two pigtails with orange beads, brown eyes, medium skin, rosy cheeks, black eyebrows and eyelashes, and a pair of small, gold loop earrings on each of her ears. She is always seen wearing a pink bandanna with swirly white doodles on the trim and a couple of hair strands sticking out the front. Her outfit consists of a pink, short-sleeved shirt with puffy sleeves and a brief V-cut neckline, purple pants, a pair of red bucket-top boots with low heels, and a brown lace around her neck that holds a small gold pouch of pixie dust, which is used in the case of emergencies.

==Role in the series==
[[File:Izzy dressed as the Pirate Princess.jpg|thumb|250px|Izzy dressed as a Pirate Princess.]]
Izzy is one of Jake's crew members. She has knowledge of many lost things that wash up the shore and the most active in the group after Jake. In the series, her belongings are stolen more often than anyone else giving her a bold and fearless personality.ï»¿ In most of their adventures, Izzy's pixie dust is responsible for saving the team. While her pixie dust is mainly for emergencies only, there is one day of the year called Pixie Dust Away Day where Izzy and the team are able to use the pixie dust as much as they want for the entire day. If she ever run out of pixie dust (which she did in the episode "[[Pixie Dust Away]]"), she must travel to the Fountain of Forever where lies an endless supply of said dust. It has been shown that Izzy is a fan of princesses and wishes to one day become a pirate princess. This is acknowledged even further when the crew meet and befriends the [[Pirate Princess]].

Many episodes revolve around Izzy, with two of them having her host the show instead of Jake. In "[[The Pirate Princess]]", she led the group on a rescue mission entitle operation:pirate princess to save the Pirate Princess from the evil spell of a legendary [[The Sea Witch|Sea Witch]]. In "[[Treasure of the Tides]]", Izzy was made an honorary mermaid by [[Marina]], her sister [[Stormy]], and other [[Mermaids (Peter Pan)|mermaids]] in Never Land. She then led the mermaids on a mission to stop Captain Hook from stealing the Treasure of the Tides.

Other episodes revolving Izzy include "[[Izzy's Pirate Puzzle]]", "[[A Whale of a Tale (Jake and the Never Land Pirates episode)|A Whale of a Tale]]", "[[Seahorse Saddle-Up!]]", "[[Treasure of the Tides]]", and the already mentioned earlier "Pixie Dust Away".

Izzy, alongside Princess Winger and the Pirate Princess, were the main focus of the episode "[[Princess Power!]]" In order to open the princess treasure, there needs to be three princesses. Winger and the Pirate Princess make Izzy a honorary princess as they went to get the treasure somewhere in Never Land, finally making Izzy's princess dreams come true.

In the episode "[[Izzy and the Sea-Unicorn]]", Jake and his crew set out to save Izzy's new friend Cornica, a magical sea unicorn, after she is captured by Captain Hook.

In "[[Queen Izzy-bella|Queen Izzy-Bella]]", after the reading the story about Queen Isabella and her journey to find treasure in the Valley of Ice, she decides to go complete the queen's quest by herself when Jake, Cubby, and Skully didn't think the legend was true. When she arrives at the Valley of Ice she gets past the same big rocks Queen Isabella encountered and sang the same song the queen sang to move the rocks. Izzy then finds the Sword of Light and reads the inscription on the sword to raise it and find out who the most swashbuckling pirate is, but not before Captain Hook who had been following Izzy attempts to take the sword. Then Jake, Cubby and Skully who followed Izzy's trail of Pixie Dust to the Valley of Ice comes just in time to see Izzy raise the Sword of Light and turn into Queen Isabella. She then leads the crew to the Cave of Ice where they face the Ice Dragon. Izzy was the first to outsmart the dragon by ice skating in circles around it. When the crew goes in the cave, they find three golden eggs encased in ice and realized that the dragon was protecting her eggs. Using the Sword of Light Izzy unfreezes the eggs and three baby dragons hatched. After the dragon froze Captain Hook and flung him out of the cave Izzy told the dragon that she and her mates were glad to help her eggs hatch. Izzy then raises the sword and turns back into herself. Jake, Cubby and Skully then apologized to Izzy for not believing her story.

In the special "[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Battle for the Book|Battle for the Book]]", she was seen near [[John Darling]] as they searched for [[Wendy Darling]]'s book and its pages, and mentions that they make a great team.

==Trivia==
*She can be careless about pixie dust at times, as seen in the special episode "[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Peter Pan Returns|Peter Pan Returns]]", when she accidentally threw some of the dust on [[Captain Hook]]. In "[[Pixie Dust Away]]", she fell down, which resulted the pixie dust falling out of the sack and being washed away into the water, and in "[[The Forbidden City]]", Izzy loses her pixie dust by breaking the rope cord after stepping into the wrong puzzle tile.
*Izzy is the first character to have her own solo song (in the episode "[[Surfin' Turf]]").
*In the episode "[[Treasure of the Tides]]", she was made an honorary mermaid.
*In the episode "[[Princess Power!]]", she was made an honorary princess.
*On some items, she appears to have light skin, making her most likely Hispanic in race, while others put her as a dark skin, to where she is African-American otherwise. She appears to be closer the latter, but not as dark as it shows her to be. Putting her almond-shaped eyes into account with her skin color, she may very likely have Native-American blood, which is further supported in her facial similarities with Tiger Lily.
*Somewhere around the second season, when announces she's got her pixie dust, she started lifting her leg up for unknown reasons.
*Many fans believe that Izzy has a crush on Jake, but there has not been much proof of this nor has it been confirmed by the creators or at least one of her voice actresses.
*Her association with mermaids is especially appropriate as her voice actress was apparently named after the mermaid [[Madison]] from ''[[Splash]]''.
*Izzy seemed upset in the ''Jake's Buccaneer Blast'' episode "The Treasure of Belch Mountain", when Captain Hook said her catchphrase "Yay Hey, No Way!", much like how [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]] is with her "What'cha Doin'?" catchphrase, when [[Buford Van Stomm]] said it in the ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' episode "[[Out of Toon]]", and when [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] and [[Suzy Johnson|Suzy]] said it in the episode "[[Suddenly Suzy]]".
