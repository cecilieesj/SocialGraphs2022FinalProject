Sophia Fioré is the mother of Princess Rosalinda and the wife of the late King of Costa Luna. She served as the queen consort during the reign of her husband until his death sometimes prior to the event of the movie.

==Role in the [[Princess Protection Program|film]]==
At the beginning of the movie, Queen Sophia thanks Major Mason for coming to her country to help her daughter with her coronation practice now that her husband (Rosalinda's dad, the king of Costa Luna) died. Only she can become queen of Costa Luna, but since it is so much for someone so young like Rosalinda, she is afraid that General Kane might take advantage of that.  Then, General Kane shows up at the palace. He subjects upon the coronation, telling that the princess is too young to be a queen. He attempts to capture the royal family and take over Costa Luna. Sophia tells her daughter that she has to leave the country, but before she leaves, the queen gives Rosalinda her necklace so she will know her mother will be safe after Rosalinda leaves with Major Mason. She is sad to see her daughter leave, but she knows what is best for her. The queen is captured by Kane's men.

During Kane's occupation, Queen Sophia is put in prison. However, she is seen visiting him twice, guarded by Dimitri. In the first visit, Kane tells Sophia about his imagination as the country's new ruler. Sophia then tells him that as long as she alive, he will never be the King of Costa Luna. In the next visit, Kane reveals his plan to marry Sophia in order to draw Rosalinda out of her hiding place so that he can put them both in exile, despite the queen's dismay.

At the end of the movie, Rosalinda returns to her country. She and Sophia are happy to see each other. Rosalinda is crowned queen of Costa Luna, and Sophia is proud of her daughter.
