{{Quote|Not in my town you don't!|Sheriff seeing Lightning McQueen driving past the speed limit}}

'''Sheriff''' is a supporting character in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' franchise. He is the local sheriff of [[Radiator Springs]].

==Background==
===Official Description===
''"There's a long history of law enforcement in Sheriff's family. His father was a traffic cop. His aunt, his two cousins on his mother's side, his little brother...even his grandfather was a traffic cop, directing traffic at Times Square in New York around the turn of the century. Sheriff always knew he too would be a cop. After all, how many other options did he have with a name like Sheriff?"''

''"Sheriff is the local law enforcement and the keeper of the peace in [[Radiator Springs]]. He takes his job very seriously. Sheriff enjoys telling stories and taking the occasional nap behind the Radiator Springs billboard. That's where he was when [[Lightning McQueen]] first zoomed into town years ago, which led to a messy car chase that didn't end well. These days, Sheriff welcomes the hotshot racer Lightning home to Radiator Springs with all four tires."''

===Personality===
Sheriff is very devoted to his job in protecting Radiator Springs and to his friends in general. He also hates anyone who drives past the speed limit or cause damage to town and will punish them by placing parking boots. When Sheriff is not doing his job, he spends his time, hanging out with his friends whom he is very loyal to. He can be tough, but also loyal, he is very sad when McQueen leaves for the race. With other words, he is very strict and just as kind.

===Physical appearance===
Sheriff is a 1949 Mercury 2-door Police Cruiser that is painted black and white, with the Carburetor County Sheriff's Department seal on both of his doors. He has a siren, a public address speaker, a red rotating gumball light on his roof and has a grill to resemble a mustache.

In ''The Radiator Springs 500½'', he has his hood temporarily painted white for the anniversary of the town's founding, as well as a big, gold star on his doors and the inscription "SHERIFF" on his fenders. His gumball light is also replaced with a more old-fashioned one, and his roof's speaker and siren are moved to his fenders.

===Powers and abilities===
Sheriff is incredibly fast and can easily catch speeders that come racing through town, though he may have trouble accelerating due to the exhaust on him preventing his speed.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars]]''===
Sheriff was first seen when Lightning McQueen enters Radiator Springs where he notices McQueen speeding when trying to catch up with Mack. There, Sheriff tries to stop him but eventually evades him as McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs. He then arrests McQueen for causing too much damage to the pavement.

Sheriff next appears when he tells Mater to take McQueen to the traffic court to know who is responsible for damaging the pavement in which he presents the town's judge [[Doc Hudson]] in which McQueen must pave asphalt on the damaged road. After the plan to repair the damaged road was unsuccessful and rushed, Sheriff then later appears challenging McQueen and Doc in a race at Willy's Butte in which the race was unsuccessful due to McQueen crashing into cacti. Sheriff watches McQueen continue working on the road all night and when he runs out of asphalt, Sheriff allows him to go to Willy's Butte so he can practice turning onto the dirt track. Sheriff continues watching McQueen the next morning and when Doc arrives to the scene, he allows Sheriff to go get a quarter of oil at Flo's café while offering to keep an eye on the racecar, which Sheriff happily obliges to.

Later when McQueen meets Sheriff having an appointment with Doc Hudson, he asks Doc to get daily gas ration from him, in which Doc explains that he can talk to him after his appointment. At Flo's V8 Café, Sheriff waits for McQueen who comes in and asks if anyone knew that Doc was a famous racecar. Sheriff becomes bewildered and believes that the heat is starting to give McQueen hallucinations. Sally gives gas to McQueen in which he feels worried that McQueen may cause trouble again. When McQueen thinks about running off, Sheriff turns on his flashers and prepares to chase after McQueen. However, McQueen decides against it and goes with Sally on a drive, causing Sheriff to turn off his flashers where he immediately develops a mutual liking to the racecar. Later, when Mater comes into town with a herd of tractors following him, Sheriff scolds Mater as he handles the tractors while Mater tries to deny that he went tractor tipping.

When the road is finished the next day, Sheriff starts crying, thinking McQueen has gone to his race though he denies his sadness and says he's glad McQueen is gone. However, Sheriff becomes overjoyed to see that McQueen has not left and offers on giving McQueen a police escort so he can make it to his race, but McQueen decides to get tires to help prepare for the race and does a shopping spree around Radiator Springs. When everyone turns on their stores' newly fixed neon lights, Sheriff parties around with his friends and tells Mater and Sally to wait for the stoplight to turn green as herd of tractors cross the road. The party is cut short when [[Mack]] and the other fans find McQueen and take him to the Los Angeles International Speedway due Doc informing them on McQueen's whereabouts. Sheriff is heartbroken to see McQueen get taken away and goes home.

Doc, regretting his decision, informs his friends his days of being a racecar so Sheriff and the rest of the town leave to go to the speedway except for [[Red (Cars)|Red]], Sally, and [[Lizzie (Cars)|Lizzie]] who watch McQueen's race on TV in Radiator Springs. There, he and the other inhabitants watch McQueen racing in which McQueen didn't win due to having helped The King finish his last race, and later Chick Hicks getting booed off for his notorious actions despite winning. During the epilogue, after Radiator Springs is put back on the map due McQueen moving his racing headquarters there, the Delinquent Road Hazards pass through Sheriff who is sleeping as he arrests them for speeding and as a punishment, the Delinquents is forced to use [[Bessie]] to pave the road. Later, Sheriff continues spending time and having fun with his friends.

===''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]''===
Sheriff tells the townsfolk the story of the ghostlight, which scares the townsfolk, especially Mater. He and the other townsfolk later to play a joke on Mater to get back at him for his pranks. They hang a lamp on his tow hook, which scares him all over Carburetor County. When Mater finally sees the lamp, Sheriff tells him that the only thing to be scared of is his imagination.

===''[[Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales]]''===
In ''[[Tokyo Mater]]'', when the tuner cars drift through Radiator Springs, Sheriff chases after them. In ''[[Hiccups]]'', he suggests drinking water as a cure for Lightning's hiccups. After Sally cures them with a kiss, Sheriff gets the hiccups himself and drives away when Mater tries to cure them by kissing. He is also seen in the crowd of cars watching Guido dancing with the sign in ''[[Spinning]]'', and joins in on the leisurely drive for the "Staney Days" celebration in ''[[The Radiator Springs 500½]]''.

He would have been a main character in the canceled episode, ''[[To Protect and Serve]]'' in which he takes a vacation while two rookie police cars fill in for him in his absence. He eventually returns when he senses, correctly, that the rookies are doing a bad job.

===''[[Cars 2]]''===
When McQueen comes back home from winning his fourth Piston Cup trophy, Sheriff gratefully welcomes him home, saying that Radiator Springs wasn't the same without him. Sheriff then watches Mater drive up the road at a fast speed so he greet and welcome McQueen home as Mater had been missing him. That evening, when everyone relaxes at the [[Wheel Well Motel]], Mater calls into the Mel Dorado Show to have a conversation with [[Francesco Bernoulli]] about McQueen. Intentionally, Francesco brags about how McQueen would come to a race with him, which catches the attention of everyone at the motel. Presently, McQueen comes to the scene and takes the phone to handle Francesco himself. To bring the conversation to an end, [[Miles Axlerod]] invites McQueen to compete in the [[World Grand Prix]]alongside Francesco, and McQueen agrees, much to Sheriff and his friends' delight. As McQueen, Mater, [[Luigi]], [[Guido]], [[Fillmore (Cars)|Fillmore]] and [[Sarge (Cars)|Sarge]] board their flight to [[Tokyo]], Sheriff, along with Ramone, Sally, Flo and Red, bids goodbye to them all, and they all watch the plane take off.

Some time later, McQueen radios the town to report that Mater has gone missing. Eagerly, Sheriff goes with Ramone, Sally, Flo, and Red to meet McQueen and his crew in [[London]], just as the final World Grand Prix race is minutes away from starting. Sheriff and Sarge leave to get help from the police and British Army to search for Mater while the others stay to support McQueen during the race. However, Sheriff and Sarge are later informed by their friends that Mater had come to the pits during the race to warn them about a bomb, only to flee when McQueen came to the pits after [[Finn McMissile]] and [[Holley Shiftwell]] radio Mater to alert that he had been tricked and the bomb had been planted on him instead, leaving McQueen to chase Mater before the two blast out of the racetrack when Mater activated his rockets.

When Sheriff and the others go to help them, they find a group of cars known as "[[Lemons]]" are surrounding McQueen, Mater, Finn and Holley, and jump in to help them battle the lemons. After Flo shines her headlights in Vladimir Trunkov's eyes, blinding him, this gives Sheriff the opportunity to place a parking boot on him. After every lemon gets arrested, everyone has their eyes on the bomb, which is already ticking away, leading Sheriff to try investigating the Lemons's second-in-command, [[Professor Zündapp]]. At that point, Mater figures out the solution and heads to Buckingham Palace with McQueen, causing Sheriff and everyone else following them. Finding Mater and McQueen there, Mater expresses that Axlerod is the leader of the lemons, and the only one who can deactivate the bomb with a voice command. While Axlerod denies this, Mater continues, saying that Axlerod and the lemons have a hidden oil reserve that is supposed to make them rich if everyone gives up alternative fuel, and in order to make that happen, they made engine blowouts occur during every World Grand Prix race with Axlerod's supposed renewable fuel, [[Allinol]], coming into contact with an electromagnetic pulse. With no other choice when he gets confronted, Axlerod deactivates the bomb, and is confirmed to be the mastermind. After Axlerod's defeat, Sheriff and the others attend a knighting ceremony to watch Mater get knighted by the Queen.

When Sheriff and his friends head back to Radiator Springs, Mater tells them all about his story of being involved in Finn and Holley's secret mission. Presently, Finn and Holley arrive to greet Mater and all of his friends where Sheriff becomes surprised to hear Holley announce she is Mater's girlfriend. Sheriff then listens to McQueen, Mater, and the agents figure out why McQueen did not explode when coming in contact with the lemons' electromagnetic pulse to which Sarge admitted he had switched McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel. Subsequently, the town hosts a race for every World Grand Prix racer to compete in where Sheriff guides the racers to the starting line. Then, Sheriff joins his friends at Willy's Butte to cheer on for McQueen as he takes the lead in the Radiator Springs Grand Prix, and later experiences Mater join in with the use of his rocket jets.

Lightning wins, despite Doc having giving Sheriff a turbo-charger, and celebrates his victory by doing doughnuts. Sheriff sends McQueen away, threatening to make him do trash pick-up.

==Trivia==
*Sheriff is a [[1949]] Mercury Police Cruiser, fitted with aftermarket "curb feelers" designed to help avoid scuffing his whitewall tires.
*If Sheriff is in London, he's out of his jurisdiction.
*Sheriff could be considered as a minor antagonist due to at first hating McQueen for destroying the town.
*His license plate reads 001, except in the video game, where it reads SHERIFF.
*In newly uncovered concept art for [[Ant-Man (film)|''Ant-Man'']], Sheriff was going to appear in the final battle, having been supersized by Ant-Man had he'd been included as a toy. However, he was replaced by Thomas the Tank Engine.
*Sheriff's troubles with trying to go fast due to his exhaust backfiring on him multiple times makes Lightning believe he is shooting at him, even though he isn't. This fittingly would foreshadow ''Cars 2'', where some cars like Finn McMissile or the Lemons would use machine guns or missiles inside them.
