'''Daniel Davenport''' is the bionic younger brother of [[Adam Davenport|Adam]], [[Bree Davenport|Bree]], [[Chase Davenport|Chase]], and [[Marcus Davenport]]. He has been living a normal life with an adopted family. He never knew that he had bionics until his siblings accidentally activated his chip while taking a group photo. It is revealed by [[Douglas Davenport|Douglas]] that Daniel has an ability called Power Replication. He can touch someone and have whatever ability he/she has. When he touches another person, the old ability is replaced with the new one. After Adam and Daniel stop the leak of the Hydro-Loop's fuel tank, Douglas apologizes to Daniel for lying about his bionics out of fear that he would freak out. Daniel decides to give Douglas a second chance. Before Daniel leaves back to the mainland, Douglas tells him that he can come back anytime. His original name was Subject D as he was the fourth bionic human that Douglas created.
