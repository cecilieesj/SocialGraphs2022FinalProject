Doctor Doom kidnaps [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]], as he suspects one of them is a [[Skrull]]. The [[Avengers]] and Fantastic Four face Doom to aid their friends, but Doom leaves everyone go after he confirms his suspicions; while Wasp is the real deal, Sue has been replaced by a Skrull.

Doom later comes to Iron Man to tell him that he knew that Iron Man was working on a Skrull detector. Doom gave Iron Man a chip which will allow Iron Man's armor to do a genetic "reset" on the Skrull's DNA, exposing their true forms, as the chip was incompatible with Doom's armor but that is all the help Doom will give - fighting the Skrulls is beneath him, and what lackies like Iron Man are for. He then left Iron Man to go fight the Skrulls himself.

===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
Doom send out his Mark VI to be captured by Spider-Man and co when they invaded Latveria. They brought it to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters and tried to destroy the power reactor. After Spider-Man and co. defeated the Mark VI he broadcast on S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier screen and threatened them to not invade Latveria again.

Some time later, when Spider-Man loses [[Captain America's Shield]], it ends in the Latverian embassy where Doom gets it. Spider-Man and [[Captain America]] face the dangers of the embassy to recover it before Doom can analyze and duplicate the alloy it's made of. Doom escapes in a ship, but as he enters American airspace along with the fact that the missile he fired at Spider-Man from the embassy flew into a New York City street due to it being a heat seeking missile   And Lang with his plot to invade America being discovered he can be arrested for conspiracy to invade America . Doom calmly surrenders himself, stating his lativariqn officials will have diplomatic immunity lawyers from the embassy  help have him out in a short time.

In "The Serpent of Doom," Doctor Doom fights the Avengers where he manages to obtain Ulik's weapon Codgel. The Avengers tracked the Codgel's energy signature to the Latverian Embassy and battled Doctor Doom and his Doombots.

==Trivia==
*Even though he is considered Marvel's main antagonist and has battled most of the superheroes in the comics he is (as of 2019) yet to appear in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], this is because Fox owned the rights to him and most of the primarily Fantastic Four villains.
*Doctor Doom is briefly mentioned in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[All Ducks on Deck]]", when the [[Phantom Blot]] is comparing himself to other villains: "Compared to me, Doctor Doom is a wimp, and [[Captain Hook]] is about as dangerous as a plastic coat hanger!"
