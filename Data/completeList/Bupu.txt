==Background==
===Personality===
Bupu is a stubborn sable antelope who does not like being told what to do. He can be persuaded to take orders, but does reluctantly. He is also known to give up easily and can be hard to work with. But later on, we learn that he likes politeness and will be kind to those who are well-mannered.

Boboka convinces Bupu to reconsider for the young ones. He finally agrees, and the Guard leads them away across the a cliff slide.

The Lion Guard lead the herd around the side of a cliff, until a rockslide falls. Kion warns them to stay back which annoys Bupu after just being told to follow them.

[[Fuli]]

Bupu eventually refused to go any farther, prompting an apology from her. Much to her surprise, this was all Bupu had wanted, and he followed through with her request.

But soon the Lion Guard arrives on the scene, and try to work out the situation by placing Beshte between the quarreling pair. As Makuu explains, Bupu attempts to strike him again, and Makuu retaliates again. But Kion warns the crocodile, who slinks away, mentioning that he has no desire for a fight. Bupu is proud of himself, claiming that Makuu wouldn't try tangling with an antelope again.
