'''Elizabeth "Lizzie" McDonald''' is [[Casey McDonald|Casey]]'s younger sister who is the twin of [[Edwin Venturi|Edwin]] as they share the same birthday. She is portrayed by Jordan Todosey in ''[[Life with Derek]]''.

==Personality==
Lizzie is a very lovely girl like her older sister but she mostly gets mad at Edwin and [[Marti Venturi|Marti]] when they spoil things. She is also a tomboy and tries her best with sports though it was me mentioned that she wasn't very good with hockey although Derek helped her set things straight.

Lizzie is the middle child which makes her weak against Casey who sometimes takes advantage of her although she sometimes stands up for herself and disagrees with Casey sometimes. Even though Casey is like a role model to her Lizzie appears to be very different from Casey such as liking sports and not liking makeup and she doesn't really prefer having boyfriends or dating.
