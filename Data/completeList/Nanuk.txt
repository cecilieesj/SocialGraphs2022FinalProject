He is one of the customers of Baloo and Louie's "Pizza Pie in the Sky" pizza air delivery business, but the first delivery to him involves the wrong-sized pizza, prompting two more repeated deliveries to him, each of which also go awry.

He is a polar bear that wears a purple-coat. He also has purple eye corners around his eyes, scruffy eyebrows, and a grey muzzle.

== Trivia ==

* He was almost voiced by Jim Cummings. However, that idea was scrapped, and the role has since been given to Dan Gilvezan.
* He is possibly similar in size to Tiny, another polar bear character in the show.
