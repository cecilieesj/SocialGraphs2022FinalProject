}}'''Long John Silver''' is the ship's treacherous cook and the main antagonist of ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''.
==Role in the film==
Silver lost his right leg as the result of a cannonball in Madagascar. On the ship Hispaniola, Silver befriends young [[Jim Hawkins (Muppets)|Jim Hawkins]]. He even confessed one night that when he was eight, his father died at sea — “first mate he was” — after Jim tells him his own father (also a first mate) died at sea when he was seven.

However, Silver is actually planning a mutiny amongst the crew of the Hispaniola, so as to seek Captain Flint's treasure himself. He is a deceptively charming man at first, until he is overheard by [[Gonzo]], [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] and Jim as he reveals his dastardly plans to his fellow pirates aboard the Hispaniola.

Upon looking for the treasure, the pirates discovered that the treasure Flint left was empty, leading a brief mutiny against Silver, who allows Jim to escape.

Silver managed to get his crew back on his team, but berated them for using a black spot, which was torn on a page from a Bible. Later, he and his crew capture [[Kermit |Smollet]] and [[Benjamina Gunn]] by having her tell where the treasure is hidden. When Smollet and Benjamina are left to die, Silver and his men finally found the treasure, which Benjamina revealed that it was in her place.

When the pirates are heading back to their ship with the treasure, they discover the Hispaniola approaching. His crew thought the Ghost of Captain Flint coming towards them and run away in fear, but Silver knows that Jim is aboard the ship, trying to rescue Smollet and Benjamina.

When the rest of the pirates are defeated, Silver surrenders, finding himself outnumbered.

At the end of the film, Silver is imprisoned to stand trial in Bristol, however fearing that he would be hanged, he makes his escape without his crew by taking whatever treasure he can in a lifeboat, but not before saying a rather touching goodbye to Jim Hawkins, where he declares he could "never hurt" Jim, because he is "honest and brave and true", something he himself isn't. Unbeknownst to Silver, however, his lifeboat is faulty and sinks, forcing him to swim back to Treasure Island, leaving him treasureless and stranded.

== Personality ==
According to Billy Bones, Jim Hawkins, Gonzo and Rizzo were warned to beware the One legged Man as Captain Flint himself was actually afraid of him. Long John is ruthless and will not hesitate to harm someone to get what he wants even if it is a person in the crew. Despite Long John Silver's lust for finding the treasure and scary temper, he's actually more polite than most pirates as he and his crew are known as professonal pirates. They don't kill people or stab them in the back, they only want the treasure. For most of the film, he was able to cover up his friendship with his own crewmates; even when his pet lobster Polly was captured, he treated them like prisoners. When his own crew turned on him after the treasure chests were empty, he told Jim to run since he did think he was all right. When a sword fight broke out and all his men were defeated, Long John surrendered honorably. 

==Trivia==

* Tim Curry also starred in the [[Muppet Treasure Island (video game)|''Muppet Treasure Island'' video game]], in which he helps out the player as Jim Hawkins.
