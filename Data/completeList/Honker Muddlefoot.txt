'''Honker Muddlefoot''' is [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]]'s best friend, and a supporting character in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', voiced by [[Katie Leigh]].

==Background==
Honker Muddlefoot, or Herbert "Honker" Muddlefoot Jr., is a shy, brainy, goose, and [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]]'s best friend. Honker is the younger son of [[Herb and Binkie Muddlefoot]], and his older brother is [[Tank Muddlefoot|Tank]]. Honker is neighbors with [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Drake Mallard/Darkwing Duck]]Â and is school mates with Gosalyn. It is strongly implied that Honker either figured out or somehow discovered that Drake Mallard is Darkwing Duck off-screen, but how he met the Mallard family is never shown in the series. Due to Gosalyn's involvement, Honker often helps [[Darkwing Duck]] and [[Launchpad McQuack]] in solving difficult cases.

==Appearances==
===TV Show===
Honker's primary outfit consists of a pair of red-rimmed glasses, a green shirt, and often wearing a backpack.

===Comic Series===
==Other Depictions==
*Occasionally, when Gosalyn becomes the costumed crimefighter Quiverwing Quack, Honker becomes her costumed sidekick "The Arrow Kid."
*In the [[Negaverse]], he is a violent juvenile delinquent and often carries a destructive weapon. He is shown wearing a hat, black leather jacket, and chains, a similar costume to Marlon Brando's in ''The Wild One''.
*In the Darkwing Duck episode, "[[When Aliens Collide]]", he was once called "Gosalyn's irritating boyfriend" by an alien criminal named Wacko.
*On the planet Fezanchane, Honker is called "The Invincible One" due to his defeat of their former leader Flarg in ''[[Battle of the Brainteasers]]''.

==Trivia==
*Honker is the only family member who is aware that his sibling, Tank, is a bully.
*Honker returns in the comics, despite not appearing on the show anymore after "[[Steerminator]]".
*Honker is the only Muddlefoot Darkwing doesn't mind as he is the smartest member of his family and doesn't annoy him as much as Herb or Binkie.
*It is unknown how he met Drake, Launchpad and Gosalyn, or how he found out that Drake is Darkwing Duck.
