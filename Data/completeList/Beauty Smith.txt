'''Beauty Smith''' is the main antagonist in Disney's ''[[White Fang]]''. He is a brutal dogfighter wants to turn White Fang vicious by making him enter illegal dogfights.

== Role in the Film ==
As Jack Conroy arrives in the town of Skagway, he tells Beauty Smith of his search for Alex Larson. Beauty Smith and his henchmen direct the boy to the Chilkoot Pass. The three men surround Jack and steal his money, but he is undaunted and makes his way to the pass.

As Grey Beaver and White Fang arrive in Klondike City, they encounter Beauty Smith and his fighting dog, Buck. While Grey Beaver offers animal pelts to a storekeeper, Beauty Smith instigates a fight between the two dogs and White Fang wins. When Grey Beaver emerges from the store, Beauty Smith demands compensation for his injured dog, forcing the chief to surrender White Fang. Following a training regimen of taunting and abuse, Beauty Smith and his henchmen enter White Fang in his first fight. He kills his opponent and continues undefeated through numerous fights. Jack and Alex come upon a dogfight in which White Fang is pitted against a pit bull owned by Beauty Smith’s archrival, Mr. Sykes. A police raid drives the spectators away as White Fang’s opponent grabs him by the throat. Jack pries the dogs apart with a crowbar, then claims White Fang as restitution for the money he lost to Beauty Smith months earlier. Alex holds Beauty Smith at gunpoint, compelling him to relinquish the dog.

As Jack and White Fang take a sample to the assayer in Klondike City, Luke informs Beauty Smith and Tinker, and they follow Jack back to the mine. The next morning, Beauty Smith and Tinker open fire on the cabin and attempt to burn it down. White Fang attacks Tinker, who accidentally discharges his gun, wounding Luke. After the wolfdog subdues Beauty Smith, Jack and Alex take Beauty Smith and his henchmen prisoner and force them into town where they are arrested.
