}}'''Ivan''' is one of the main characters in [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[1946]] short ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', a segment of the feature film ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Ivan is described as a bit dumb, though he doesn't really seem to display it in the show. He is shown to be adept at prowling, as most cats are, and very sneaky as seen when he tries to catch and eat [[Sasha]], but is stopped and berated by [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]]. He is shown to have a great fear of the [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]], as he panics at the first sign of it and runs to Peter, though he is brave enough to let Peter lower him down with a rope and tie it to the wolf's tail to save Sasha. He is also the only one who stays with Peter throughout the whole ordeal, with [[Sonia]] seeming to get eaten and Sasha going to find some [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir|hunters]] for help.

==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
Ivan is first seen trying to eat Sasha, but Peter stops him just in time and demands him to release Sasha. Peter then berates Ivan, who seems to feel ashamed. He later accompanies Peter, Sasha, and Sonia to hunt down and capture the wolf. When Ivan suddenly notices the wolf, he panics and runs to Peter. Later, when Sonia supposedly gets eaten by the wolf, Ivan mourns with the rest of the gang. He later shows bravery when Peter lowers him down with a rope and ties it to the wolf's tail to save Sasha from getting eaten, after which Sasha goes to some hunters for help. Ivan can be seen in the parade with Peter at the end of the segment.
