==Background==
===History===
The clan's roots lay in [[David Xanatos|Xanatos]]' efforts to create an obedient force of gargoyles, or otherwise similar creatures. Xanatos hired [[Anton Sevarius]] to create gargoyle-like creatures using DNA from humans, jungle cats, and bats. Sevarius injected the DNA of jungle-cats, bats, and electric eels (for energy-compensation) into humans, mutating them into inhuman creatures. These Mutates eventually sought freedom from Xanatos and took refuge in the underground complex that formerly belonged to Cyberbiotics.

Xanatos' next attempt was to clone [[Goliath]], which actually began before the mutate project, resulting in a vengeful and evil gargoyle called [[Thailog]]. Thailog teamed up with [[Demona]], and the two hired Sevarius to clone the [[Manhattan Clan]], save for [[Bronx]]. During their squabbles for dominance, Demona and Thailog abandoned the clones, whom the mutates took to the Labyrinth, thereby forming the clan.

On Halloween of [[1995]], Thailog stormed the Labyrinth, injuring [[Maggie the Cat]], and made away with [[Malibu]], [[Brentwood]], [[Burbank]], and [[Hollywood (Gargoyles)|Hollywood]]. Together, they journeyed to [[Castle Wyvern]] atop the [[Eyrie Building]] to reclaim [[Delilah (Gargoyles)|Delilah]]. Delilah, spurned both Thailog and Goliath, and all her brothers, save Brentwood, declined to join Thailog and returned to the Labyrinth. It seems that Delilah has developed a strong connection with Malibu.

After the attack, [[Elisa Maza]] brought Dr. Sato to act as a medical source for the clan, and to treat Maggie the Cat, who has been injured in the attack by Thailog, and was also pregnant.
