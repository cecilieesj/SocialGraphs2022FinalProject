She's a co-news anchor for the ZNN and works alongside her colleague, [[Peter Moosebridge]].

==Role in the [[Zootopia|film]]==
Fabienne Growley makes two appearances in the film. She first appears during the film's climax, announcing the bad news with her co-anchor - another attack involving a predator going savage during the week following [[Judy Hopps]]' announcement, as well as an unfortunate incident at [[Gazelle]]'s peace rally.

Growley later appears near the end of the film, announcing that [[Bellwether]] is now behind bars after being exposed as the mastermind behind the attacks plaguing [[Zootopia (location)|the city]], while Moosebridge covers [[Mayor Lionheart]]'s denial of said scheme. Growley also mentions that physicians have developed a remedy for the [[night howlers]], and all the predators who have been afflicted are now being treated.
