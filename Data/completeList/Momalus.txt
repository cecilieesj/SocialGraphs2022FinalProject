'''Momalus''' is a minor character from the Disney animated series, ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. She is the mother of [[Icarus]] and is the owner of a successful pottery making business.

==Background==
Momalus was married to [[Daedalus]] and they later had a son, Icarus. Originally when Momalus began making pottery, it began as a small business and crafting from her home. Eventually, her business became very successful and she now owns six different factories all across Greece. At some point, however, years before the start of the series, Momalus and Daedaulus ended their marriage and they divorced with Momalus moving away to Ithaca while Icarus and Daedaulus remained in Athens. Despite her divorce, Momalus remains on good terms with Daedaulus and continues to maintain a very close relationship with Icarus who spends every summer working closely with her.

==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==
In "[[Hercules and the Green-Eyed Monster]]", Momalus makes her debut when Icarus comes to visit her in Ithaca and introduces her to his best friend, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]]. Icarus comes to inform his mother that his father is dating his teacher, [[Miss Thespis]]. Icarus expects his mother to be heartbroken, but is surprised to find his mother is actually very happy for his father and is supportive of his new romantic relationship. Icarus is upset by this development as he is unable to accept his parents' divorce. Momalus comforts her son, understanding it's difficult having his parents apart, but assures Icarus they both love him and encourages Icarus to give his father a chance for happiness.
