'''Dirk Brock''' is a guest character from the ''[[The Emperor's New School|Emperor's New School]]'' episode; ''[[The Emperor's New School Musical]]''.

==Role in the episode==

Dirk appeared when the school needed money to pay the bills or be torn down, and was chosen to play the lead role in the school musical. But a jealous [[Kuzco]], who thinks Dirk is trying to steal [[Malina]] from him, steals [[Yzma]]'s laryngitis potion and makes Dirk drink it. Kuzco tries to take his spot but is rejected by Malina. Kuzco and Malina give Dirk the antidote, so now he's able to sing again. Dirk challenges [[Yzma]] to a singing competition to prevent her from stealing the spotlight, but when the competition ends in a draw, Kuzco finds a way for everyone to perform together and eventually saves their school.
