He is designed to attack by firing balls of plasma from his scorpion-like tail. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]".

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Plasmoid is a green scorpion-like creature with six legs, black eyes, an oval nose, two antennae, no pincers, and a pincer-less tail. He also has small fangs protruding from the top of his mouth, though they are larger and more prominent in ''[[Stitch!]]''.

===Powers and ablilties===
Plasmoid can shoot explosive balls of plasma from his tail. In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, it is also revealed that he can vacuum up objects and then shoot them out his tail as projectiles after being modified by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 617 was the 617th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to shoot plasma balls from his scorpion-like tail. 617 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

617's pod eventually made its way to a junk shop, where it, along with [[Hammerface|033]], [[Heat|609]], and [[Thresher|544]], was discovered, stolen, activated, and named Plasmoid by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] in "[[Dupe (episode)|Dupe]]".

Back at [[Gantu's Ship|his ship]], Gantu trained and conditioned Hammerface, Heat, Thresher, and Plasmoid by using [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] for target practice, much to his indignity. The four henchmen experiments were then led by Gantu in an attack on the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]], where their boss ordered them to defeat and capture [[Stitch]] and his duplicates after seeing that he had been divided into four.

While his teammates each battled one of the clones, Plasmoid engaged the original Stitch in a duel. Plasmoid attacked by firing plasma balls at Stitch, only for the latter to dodge them all. The scorpion-like experiment then fired a plasma blast at an overhead lamp. Stitch taunted Plasmoid, saying he missed, but this was proven wrong as the lamp then fell on Stitch's head, knocking him out. Gantu finished the battle by placing Stitch in a containment orb along with his clones.

After capturing Stitch and his clones, the five returned to Gantu's ship for a victory feast (courtesy of Reuben), but were interrupted by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Dupe]]. When Lilo tricked Gantu into using Dupe's cloning ability, Gantu used Dupe to clone Plasmoid into a hundred replicas. However, as the original Plasmoid's power was divided among them, they all became complete weaklings, and thus were easily defeated.

Presumably after this, they were all sent to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] who was somehow able to re-merge the weakling Plasmoid clones into the original.

Plasmoid reappeared in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission. Plasmoid even helped with the escape by breaking Gantu's [[Plasma Blaster|gun]] in two with a plasma blast, allowing [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]] to eat it.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Plasmoid, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Plasmoid participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by firing plasma blasts at attacking Leroys.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Plasmoid has appeared twice in the ''Stitch!'' anime, both times with [[Splodyhead]]. In the first appearance, Plasmoid and Splodyhead combated [[Stitch]] when he was hypnotized by [[Swirly]] into fighting for [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]. In the second appearance, Plasmoid and Splodyhead were modified by Hämsterviel to attack Stitch. Plasmoid was given a new ability of vacuuming up objects and using them as projectiles. In "Shogun", it is shown that Plasmoid was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault.

==Trivia==
*Plasmoid is one of the ten known experiments named by someone other than Lilo, the other nine being [[Gigi]], [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Hammerface]], [[Heat]], [[Thresher]], [[Morpholomew]], [[Shrink]], and [[Leroy]].
**Plasmoid (alongside Hammerface, Heat, and Thresher) was named by Gantu.
*Plasmoid, [[Bugby]], and [[Clink]] are the only known experiments that are hexapods. Interestingly, all three have characteristics similar to different arthropods.
*Even though we saw Plasmoid in [[Experiment Pods|pod]] form, he was technically activated off-screen.
**Plasmoid's pod color is yellow according to "[[Ace (episode)|Ace]]".
*Plasmoid is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*Plasmoid appears in the online game ''[[Lilo & Stitch: Alien Interception]]'' along with [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Dupe]], [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]], [[Yang]], and [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]].
