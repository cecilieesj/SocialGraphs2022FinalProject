==Role in the Series==
She revealed to [[Princess Charlotte]] that she was the one who turned her into a beast to punish her because she had been rude and insensitive to her friend, [[Morris (Sofia the First)|Morris the Goblin]]. To break her curse, she told Charlotte had to become true friends with Morris. She gave the princess information on where Morris lived and wished her luck. When Morris was captured by the Royal Guards, Princess Charlotte vouched for him with everyone listening to what she had to say including her. With Morris and Charlotte being true friends and Charlotte regaining her appearance she told her, "well done" then transformed into a cat and walked away.

==Trivia==
*Zinessa's appearance and body language are loosely based on a cat, specifically a Siamese cat, which is what she can transform into. Her headpiece and the bottom back part of her gown resembles cat ears and a tail.
