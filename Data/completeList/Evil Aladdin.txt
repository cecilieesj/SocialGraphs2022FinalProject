'''Evil Aladdin''' was a dark counterpart created by the all-powerful [[Chaos]] to battle the [[Aladdin (character)|real Aladdin]].

==Role in series==
Evil Aladdin first appears in "[[When Chaos Comes Calling]]." Chaos created him because he believed that Fate had declared that Aladdin would always win, so he conjures a dark counterpart to see which would succeed in a fight. He then transports them to the center of Agrabah where the Evil Aladdin knocks the real one off a building. Aladdin then finds Evil Aladdin throwing tomatoes at two of civilians. When the two Aladdins fight again, Genie intercepts them, so Evil Aladdin summons [[Evil Genie|his own Genie]] to fight him. Aladdin then defeats Evil Aladdin by pulling a carpet he's standing on so he falls down a well. It is assumed that Evil Aladdin ceased to exist when the real Aladdin forced Evil Genie to return everything to normal.
