Bridget is Tara's aunt. She was the leader of the Everines. She faked her death so Tara can follow her destiny. Later in the first season, it is revealed that she is evil and cursed Cameron's mother into a tree. She later is controlled by the Founders who have her essence. She leaves for Hollowfall at the end of the first season with her older sister Agatha, thanks to Tara.
