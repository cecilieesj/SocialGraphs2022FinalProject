'''Airplane Jane''' is an airplane pilot from the TV show ''[[TaleSpin]]''.

This hippo learned to fly from [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] (it reputedly took her a minute), and she shares almost the same mannerisms and behavior as her former mentor. Jane was once a finishing school attendee with [[Princess Grace]] of [[Walla-Walla-Bing-Bang]], but "never finished".

Despite her show-offish attitude (she never misses a chance to rub it to Baloo that she is the better pilot) and often sneaky, competitive nature, she also has a heart of gold underneath and would help out a friend in need.

Her only appearance is in the episode "[[Waiders of the Wost Tweasure]]".
