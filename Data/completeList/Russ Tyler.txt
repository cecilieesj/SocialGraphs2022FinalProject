'''Russ Tyler''' is a hockey player who plays at the Defencemen Position and wears number 56. Tyler was part of the [[Team USA (Junior Goodwill Games)|Team USA]] in the Goodwill Games in the film ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]''.

==Biography==
He is a local boy from [[Los Angeles]] who teaches the team how to play "for real" following a major upset against Team [[Iceland]] in D2. He is recruited into the roster following [[Adam Banks]]' wrist injury. Russ fashions his trademark "knucklepuck", a slapshot that curves in a sine curve rather than a direct, straight shot, and is very loquacious. He later attended [[Eden Hall Academy]], as seen in ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]''.

==Playing Style==
Russ' playing style is more undefined than the rest of the Duck's. The only skill that has been on display throughout the course of the films has been his knuckle puck shot.  

==Trivia==
*Russ' appearance in D3 might have been one possible cause of Jesse Hall's absence, as he uses Jesse's term "cake-eater" to describe Adam Banks.
*Russ wasnâ€™t seen while sitting around a campfire because he is still in his home town of Los Angeles.
