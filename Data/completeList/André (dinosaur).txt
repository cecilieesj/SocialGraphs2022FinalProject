When André disappears after a drinking binge, it's assumed that Robbie ate him. However, André merely developed amnesia, was adopted by beavers, built a couple of dams, remembered who he was and then ate his new parents.

André was voiced by [[Sam McMurray]] with [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Tate Jack Tate] puppeteering the body and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Mak_Wilson Mak Wilson] manipulating the face. He was made from the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Spikeback Spikeback] [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Unisaurs Unisaur].
