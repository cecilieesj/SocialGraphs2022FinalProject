'''Francisco Flores''' is a major character in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. He is [[Princess Elena]], [[Princess Isabel]] and [[Chancellor Esteban]]'s maternal grandfather.

==Personality==
Francisco is a very wise man who loves his family and who has a firm respect for the by-laws and traditions of the Kingdom of Avalor. He also has a perchant for storytelling as noted by his wife when she tells Elena that he's always reminded of a story. He also has knowledge of the [[Scepter of Light]] as shown when he tells Luisa "It's never glowed like that before." As revealed in "[[Model Sister]]", Francisco believes in placing the Royal Duties before all else. He also values making a good impression during a Royal Visit. As revealed in [[Island of Youth|"Island of Youth"]], he's a staunch traditionalist. As revealed in "[[A Day to Remember]]", he loves Dia de los Muertos for the snacks. He is shown to be the most reasonable of his family, as while neither Luisa or Elena could forgive Esteban for causing Shuriki to attack them, Francisco did not let the fact that Esteban had changed for the better slide and found it in his heart to forgive his grandson and looked sad as this sadly did not allow Esteban to be spared of punishment as Elena, Luisa and Naomi outvoted him and sentenced Esteban to exile, with Luisa believing he was too easy on Esteban.

==Appearances==
===''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]''===
When the evil sorceress [[Shuriki]] attacked the Kingdom of Avalor and killed [[King Raul and Queen Lucia]], Alacazar, the Royal Sorcerer, decided to keep the remaining members of the Royal Family safe by casting a spell to place him, his wife Luisa, and his younger granddaughter Princess Isabel inside an Enchanted Painting while his eldest granddaughter Crown Princess Elena faced Shuriki alone to buy him time. Elena and Alacazar succeeded and the three of them were placed inside the painting where they would remain for forty-one years while Elena herself was trapped inside the [[Amulet of Avalor]]. Along with Isabel, Luisa, the royals of Enchancia, and the people of Avalor, Francisco joined Elena in ganging up on Shuriki. After Elena broke Shuriki's wand and the sorceress fell down a waterfall, Francisco noticed that the sight disturbed Elena and Sofia, and he told his granddaughter that Shuriki was gone and they won the fight, unaware that Shuriki survived. Francisco told Elena that as the eldest child, Elena is now in charge of the kingdom and that he and Luisa will help her out.

===''[[Elena of Avalor]]''===
In the series that serves as the special's sequel, Francisco appears as a major character. He is a member of Grand Council of Avalor, alongside [[Luisa]], [[Naomi Turner|Naomi]], and [[Duke Esteban|Esteban]]. Chosen by his granddaughter for his wisdom. Through the course of the show, Francisco assists Elena in her journey to becoming Queen and is always there to give her friendly advice when she needs it.

During Season 2, upon learning of Shuriki's return, he agrees with Esteban, Naomi, and Luisa with keeping Elena in the Royal Palace under heavy guard from Gabe and the Royal Guards for her own protection.

He is later happy to hear that Isabel is starting her weekly classes at the Avalor Science Academy with Professor Ochoa, but Elena tells him and Luisa out of Isabel's earshot that she's very worried about Isabel being there as many of the students are older than her.

Francisco travels with his family on summer vacation to Nueva Vista, but after returning from the parade held in Elena's honor, Francisco, his wife, Isabel, and Esteban were confronted by Shuriki, Fiero, the Delgados, Cruz, and Vestia, who took them prisoner and locked them up in the tower. Elena soon joins them along with Sirena Crown [[Princess Marisa]], but they are all busted out by Gabe, Mateo, Naomi, and the Jaquins, and attempt to escape back to Avalor City. However, their ship is damaged by Shuriki, and by the time they return to Nueva Vista, they learn that Elena had killed Shuriki once and for all, and Francisco watches as Elena has her traitor cousin locked up for his betrayal, and forges a new alliance with Sirena King Pescoro.

During their first celebration of Dia de los Muertos in Nueva Vista, Francisco asks Elena to help him retrieve a shield he had searched for with two of his friends who drowned at sea due to his own fault and not that of the Sirenas. After encountering someone else who wanted the shield, Francisco retrieves the shield, allowing him some closure to his friends' deaths since he had been able to retrieve it with Elena's help, and makes Elena an honorary member of his old group, giving her the nickname "La Magica". He continues to support Elena during problems that arise in both Nueva Vista and back in Avalor City.

In "[[The Magic Within]]", Elena soon revealed Esteban's part in Shuriki's original takeover. Francisco was just as furious with Esteban as the rest of the family, but when brought before the Grand Council, after Esteban explains his reasons for his actions with Shuriki and how he had tried to protect them from Shuriki's wrath, Francisco was willing to forgive him, but Elena, Luisa, and Naomi refuse to forgive Esteban for what he did and how it led to Raul and Lucia's deaths and vote to exile him as punishment. Esteban later escapes with the Delgados and flees with Ash, while Carla and a petrified Victor are recaptured by Elena.

Despite his willingness to forgive Esteban, Francisco is still overruled by Elena and Luisa, and soon reconsiders his decision when Esteban performs several evil acts while working with Ash Delgado.

Later, Francisco and Luisa depart to do some things out of Avalor. When they return, Isabel and her classmates had captured a thief named [[Tito]] who had entranced Elena and the others to rob the Royal Treasury. When Francisco sees Tito's broken guitar, unaware of its powers, he takes it to be mended, much to Elena and Isabel's horror as they try to stop him.

In the series finale, "[[Coronation Day]]", when Elena heads to Nueva Vista to stop Ash and Esteban from summoning the [[Four Shades of Awesome]]. However, Francisco is later part of Avalor City's defense under Isabel as she takes command as Crown Princess with Elena set to become Queen, only to then be confronted in the throne room with Luisa by Esteban and Cahu the Time Shade. Despite Francisco and Luisa's best attempts to try and get Esteban to reconsider what he is doing and how he'll be hated as ruler because of his actions, an impatient and annoyed Cahu silences them by using her power over time to turn them into a stone slab, essentially fossilizing and killing them, much to Esteban's horror as he demands she reverse it, only for Cahu to remind Esteban he's making the same mistakes by trusting a villain he had made a deal with. Francisco and Luisa are later restored, unharmed, by Elena when she forgives Esteban and uses her newly-awoken magic to undo the Shades' damage to all of Avalor before she and Esteban defeat Cahu and banish her back to the Spirit World for good. Quita Moz then arrives and reveals that Elena's test to become Queen was forgiving Esteban, and by doing so, she passed and is now able to be Queen of Avalor. At Elena's coronation, Francisco is about to crown her Queen, when he is interrupted by the arrival of some special guests, the very people who helped Elena reclaim Avalor from Shuriki so she could become Queen now, the Royal Family of Enchancia. With [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]] and her family joining the rest of the guests, Francisco crowns Elena Queen of Avalor, and then leads everyone in the song he had written for Elena's coronation dance.
