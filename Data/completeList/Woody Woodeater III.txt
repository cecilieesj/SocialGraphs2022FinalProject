==Background==
===Physical Description===
Woody is a portly termite with purple skin. He has black eyes. He also has a pink nose and wears a magenta robe with fur trim, black boots, and a golden crown.

===Personality===
Woody is nice and selfless, expressing his gratitude to [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] multiple times. He is also laid-back, cutting up with them more than once. However, Woody can be suspicious of others, such as when he secretly told Pumbaa he thought Timon was only helping him so he could eat him. Afterward though, he felt bad about feeling that way. When his suspicions were revealed to be true, however, Woody praised Timon and Pumbaa for telling the truth, as he values honesty.

==Appearances==

After getting lost in the jungle, Woody runs into [[Timon]] who agrees to help him get back to his mound. They later find [[Pumbaa]], who joins them. Woody thanks Timon and Pumbaa for helping him as they traverse through multiple climates, including rain, snow, and heat.

As they traveled, Timon secretly told Pumbaa he planned to eat the termites, while Woody secretly told Pumbaa he suspected Timon was only helping him so he could eat him and his mound. Even though he was right, he forgave Timon and Pumbaa and honored them with a feast for their honesty.
