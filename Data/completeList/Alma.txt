==Appearance==
Alma is small and slender with short red hair, green eyes and fair skin with freckles. She also wears a blue jean dress with gray polka dots on it, a light blue T-shirt and purple mary janes.

==Personality==
Alma is sweet, cute and friendly, with a very nice smile. But when her toys don't work, Alma can get a little upset or worried about it, especially in the episode ''Blame It On The Rain'', when Alma accidentally leaves her stuffed cow, Moo-Moo, out in the rain, she feels upset about it and starts to cry. Doc and Moo-Moo later see Alma crying on the picnic table seat, telling her other toys, her fairy and frog, about the memories she has had with Moo-Moo before leaving her out in the rain. She is happy again when Doc brings Moo-Moo, who is all dry again, to her.

==Trivia==
*Alma may look similar to her sister, Emmie, because of her hair style.
*Alma may be the same age as Donny, Will and Luca, like they are 4 years old.
