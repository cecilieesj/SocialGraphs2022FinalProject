'''Mindy''' is a minor character from the first season of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. She is a girl living in the city of [[Danville]], and a rival to schoolmate [[Candace Flynn]]. She shows interest in [[Jeremy Johnson]] when asking him to sit next to her under [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s circus. However, Jeremy does not seem to like her in the same way, as he tells her that he is going to sit next to Candace. ("[[Jerk De Soleil]]")

She is also the first person to see Candace in Goth-styled clothes, after an unwanted switch with [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz]]. The first thing she does is to take a picture with her phone and send it to all her contacts, stating, "Wow, fifty replies already!", despite Candace obviously not wanting anyone to see her. ("[[Hail Doofania!]]")

==Appearance==
Mindy has short, blonde hair with a blue hair clip. She wears a green short-sleeved shirt with neon green and yellow swirls on it over a blue long-sleeved shirt and faded pale green leggings. Â
