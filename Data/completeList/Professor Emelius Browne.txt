'''Professor Emelius Browne''' is the deuteragonist of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[1971]] musical hybrid film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.

==Role in the film==
Professor Browne was [[Miss Eglantine Price]]'s magic teacher and headmaster of the Correspondence College of Witchcraft in [[London]], but because of the war, he had to close it down so that meant she couldn't get the [[Substitutiary Locomotion]] spell. When she, [[Charlie Rawlins|Charlie]], [[Carrie Rawlins|Carrie]], and [[Paul Rawlins|Paul]] get there, they find him as a magic salesman/con man who never truly believed in the spells he sold. After being turned into a rabbit, he tells Miss Price that he got the spells from [[The Spells of Astoroth]] and decides to make a deal with her. If she helps him with business, he'll help her find the spell. After facing a villainous [[Bookman (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Bookman]] and coaching the soccer game on [[The Isle of Naboombu]], they finally find it, the first time not being a success. Then he decides to leave, but goes back to help because of the [[Nazis (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Nazis]], finally finding the magic in him to turn himself into a rabbit. In the end, he joins [[General Teagler]] in the old home guard because he says, "The way things are, it's much too dangerous being a civilian." And so, he leaves with a wave and kiss to Miss Price.
