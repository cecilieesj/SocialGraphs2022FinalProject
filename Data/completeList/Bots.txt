==Background==
In the game's introduction, the Bots are like Cast Members. However, the Bots get taken over by [[HEX]] and try to destroy the guests. In the finale, they are seen playing instruments in the song'' [[It's a Small World (song)|It's a Small World]]'' and there are videos from the start of the worlds of them being mischievous.

==Role in the video game==
===In the levels===
At the start of each location, a video of the Bots misbehaving is seen. During the levels, the bots appear often and fight the players. They are like no other video game villain as they actually move objects that players need and seem to think for themselves. Throughout the game in certain areas, Bots can sometimes build traps to slow down the player from progressing to complete the level such as spike traps, walls, and turrets.

Depending on the hub the player is at, Bots wears different costumes corresponding to the theme of the hub. For instance, in the ''Alice in Wonderland'' world, the Bots are dressed as said hub's characters while in the ''Lion King'' world, they are dressed as animals corresponding to said theme.

===In the gallery===
The Bots in each world wear costumes corresponding to the movie that the world is based in. To unlock all Bot costumes, you must collect all collectibles in all levels of every hub. You can get a closer look at the Bot with its world costume.

==Types==
The Bots look different for each world but are all based on these Bots:

Fodders=
There are two types of '''Fodders''', one that walks and others that fly and shoot projectiles.

===Standard Fodders===
'''Standard Fodders''' are usually the common Bot in the game. In addition to attacking with their hands, they can use weapons like the tools that the player use and ranged weapons like ray guns and rifles. They can also move important items and build traps like spikes, cannons, and barriers to slow down the player from progressing. If you see the gear icon, you must attack the Fodders to prevent them from building the traps.
