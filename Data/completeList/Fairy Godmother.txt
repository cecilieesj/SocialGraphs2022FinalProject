{{Quote|Nonsense, [[Cinderella (character)|child]]. If you'd lost all your faith, I couldn't be here. And here I am.|The Fairy Godmother}}
The '''Fairy Godmother''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1950]] animated feature film, ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''. The physical embodiment of hope, she is a kindly fairy that is devoted to making dreams come true for the pure-hearted and noble—an act made possible by proclaiming the magic words, "[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo|bibbidi-bobbidi-boo]]".

==Background==
As she herself explains, the Fairy Godmother is the embodiment of Cinderella's hope. She did not appear until Cinderella was at her weakest point — in the case of the film, the moment Cinderella nearly loses hope of escaping her abusers and living a better life – and introduced herself as a physical beacon of hope. When her arrival nears, twinkling lights will surround the area in which the Fairy Godmother is to appear; said lights will then gather and form themselves into the godmother.

The Fairy Godmother is equipped with a [[Magic Wand|magic wand]] that she can summon from nothingness. Said wand holds incredible power, such as metamorphosis and the ability to warp reality, among others. The wand's magic is not exclusive to the Fairy Godmother, however, as [[Lady Tremaine|mortals]] can also wield its power and use it as they so please, be it for good or evil. How much magic the Fairy Godmother holds without her wand is questionable, as the only powers she demonstrated without using her wand was her ability to appear from thin air surrounded by sparkles and, as mentioned above, summoning said wand.

Apparently, she has a connection with her wand as she was able to find it in Anastasia's hands after losing it in the picnic she made for Cinderella and the Prince, despite the long distance.

===Development===
{{Quote|The Fairy Godmother should have a kindly voice with a certain age in it. I don't see her as being goofy or stupid, but rather as having a wonderful sense of humor.|[[Walt Disney]]}}
The Fairy Godmother's design underwent numerous changes in development, with the original source becoming difficult to narrow down. Eventually, layout artist [[Ken O'Connor]] looked to his wife, Mary Alice O'Connor, for inspiration. The Fairy Godmother's design was what Ken tried to imagine how she'd look a few decades older. Dedicated to community work and charities, Mary Alice's personality served to fit the character as well.

===Personality===
The Fairy Godmother is a motherly, kind, and genuine character with an optimistically pure heart. She serves as a physical symbol of hope in Cinderella's life and speaks with a gentle tone. Though wise to a degree, the Fairy Godmother tends to be comically absent-minded, continuously loses sight of the obvious, and has a habit of both losing her wand and forgetting her magic words "[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]". Even so, she can piece together her mind quickly enough and enjoys her ability to ensure dreams come true, treating Cinderella as her own daughter, in a sense.

For all of her sweetness, she doesn't sympathize with those who are cruel or unforgiving towards others. This is evidenced by her scene in the original film, where [[Lucifer]] tries to attack [[Jaq and Gus|Gus]], only to be scared off after she turns the mouse into a majestic horse. As Lucifer retreats in fear, the Fairy Godmother teasingly blasts sparks of magic from her wand towards him, while tauntingly saying, "Serves him right!"

==Appearances==
===''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''===
[[File:Cinderella-disneyscreencaps.com-5200.jpg|left|thumb|237x237px|Fairy Godmother in the original film]]
After her wicked stepsisters cruelly destroy [[Cinderella's Dress|the dress she plans on wearing to the ball]] when they recognize the beads and sash that they had thrown away earlier, Cinderella runs out to the backyard of her stepmother [[Lady Tremaine]]'s [[Cinderella's Château|château]] near her father's fountain, where she breaks down in sorrow as she has no way of getting to the ball now, beginning to lose her faith in dreams. However, her faith is still strong enough to summon her Fairy Godmother, who explains that she has arrived to help Cinderella in her hour of need. To get her to the ball, she transforms an ordinary pumpkin into a carriage and four of Cinderella's mice into white horses for the carriage. She attempts to transform [[Lucifer]] into something, but he flees, and it is unknown what he would have transformed into, or if he managed to dodge it.

She then turns Cinderella's horse, [[Major]], into a coachman, and her dog [[Bruno (Cinderella)|Bruno]] into a footman. Finally, after Cinderella points out her tattered gown, Fairy Godmother measures Cinderella with her wand and bestows a beautiful white dress upon Cinderella, complete with two enchanted [[Glass Slipper|glass slippers]] that only Cinderella can wear due to their small size. Before she departs, the Fairy Godmother gives Cinderella a word of caution: at the stroke of twelve, the spell will be broken, and everything will return to normal. Grateful for the gifts anyway, Cinderella thanks her Fairy Godmother and happily rides off to the ball as Fairy Godmother bids her farewell.

===''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]''===
[[File:Cinderella2FairyGodmother.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fairy Godmother in ''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True''.]]
In the second installment of the ''Cinderella'' series, ''Cinderella II: Dreams Come True'', the Fairy Godmother is shown at the very beginning telling the story of ''Cinderella'' to the mice. Jaq, Gus, and the other mice then decide to create a storybook of their own, reflecting on various events that occurred since they first arrived at the castle.

The Fairy Godmother happily assists the mice in creating the book and actually appears in the second story: ''Tall Tail''. Here, Jaq desperately wants to help Cinderella with her daily duties around the castle, but he cannot because of his small size. Soon enough, Fairy Godmother appears and offers to help Jaq by turning him into a human - Sir Hugh - which he accepts. However, he causes more trouble as a human than he ever did as a mouse.

At the end of the segment, Fairy Godmother returns again, changing Jaq back into a mouse. Though he learns a great lesson from his human adventure, Jaq apparently grows a disliking of magic. At the end of the film, Fairy Godmother helps the mice take their completed book to Cinderella, who gladly reads her new book together with the mice.

===''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''===
[[File:Cinderella3 0063.jpg|thumb|250px|Fairy Godmother in ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time''.]]
In the third installment of the ''Cinderella'' film series, Cinderella and Prince Charming are celebrating an entire year together filled with magic and romance. Unfortunately, during the festivities, the Fairy Godmother accidentally loses her wand, which falls into the hands of [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]], one of Cinderella's stepsisters, who quickly takes it to her mother and sister [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]].

As she witnessed Fairy Godmother's magic doings with the wand, she tries to convince her mother and sister that it is magical. Lady Tremaine and Drizella think that she has lost her mind until Fairy Godmother arrives, requesting the return of her wand. Anastasia refuses and fights her back, accidentally turning their cat Lucifer into a half goose, half-cat hybrid. The astonishing sight convinces Tremaine, and Anastasia accidentally transforms the distracted Fairy Godmother into a stone statue (much to Anastasia's horror).

With the magic of the wand in her hands and no one to stop her, Lady Tremaine alters time and history so that Anastasia was the one to fit the slipper. Fortunately, Cinderella, Jaq, and Gus catch on her plans and battle against Lady Tremaine for the wand, win the battle, retrieve the wand and restore the Fairy Godmother. Alas, the Fairy Godmother retrieves her wand, and she lastly uses it to restore Cinderella's wedding attire, which was destroyed by Lady Tremaine. Before the film ends, Fairy Godmother asks if Cinderella and Prince Charming would like to return to their normal lives, but sees that couple are happy enough as it is, and chooses to let them continue on from there.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:Fairygodmotherhom.png|thumb|left|250px|Fairy Godmother in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Fairy Godmother is a guest character in the series, often seen with Cinderella.

In "[[Goofy's Menu Magic]]" after she eats her meal, Fairy Godmother accidentally places her wand on her plate. It is taken to the kitchen and Goofy accidentally uses it to make an incredible stew. In the end, the club is flooded with stew but is saved when Fairy Godmother regains her wand.

In "[[House of Magic]]", the wand is stolen by [[Daisy Duck]] in order to do a magic trick.

In "[[Ladies' Night]]", Minnie Mouse wears Cinderella's ball dress in a fashion show, but Fairy Godmother accidentally forgets to warn her that it will eventually transform back into ragged clothes, just like in the film.

She also appears in a non-speaking cameo in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.

===Other appearances===
An emoticon version of Fairy Godmother appeared in the ''Cinderella'' entry of the ''[[As Told by Emoji]]'' short series.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
====First Iteration====
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 1x04 - The Price of Gold - The Fairy Godmother.png|thumb|250px|The Fairy Godmother in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
The Fairy Godmother, portrayed by Catherine Lough Haggquist, makes a small appearance in the [[The Price of Gold|fourth episode]] of the [[ABC]] series ''Once Upon a Time''. In addition to being the proposed godmother to Cinderella, the Fairy Godmother is also patron to [[King George]]'s kingdom and when [[Prince James (Once Upon a Time)|Prince James]] dies, George makes a deal for James' [[The Prince|twin]] with [[Rumplestiltskin]] for the whereabouts of the Fairy Godmother. As Cinderella is sadly sweeping on the night of [[Prince Charming|Prince Thomas]]' ball when she is approached by her Fairy Godmother, who prepares to send her there. To try and prove to Cinderella that she has the power to, the Fairy Godmother reveals her incredibly powerful [[Magic Wand|magic wand]] and is just about to transform the girl, when she erupts into a shower of fairy dust. Rumplestiltskin emerges from the shadows and takes the wand, which he uses to send Cinderella off to the ball instead.

She is later mentioned by Rumplestiltskin to Regina ([[the Evil Queen]]) after the curse is broken when he uses her wand to absorb all of the fairy dust from the mines and cast a spell preventing Cora ([[Queen of Hearts]]) from entering [[Storybrooke]].

====Second Iteration====
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 7x01 - Hyperion Heights - Fairy Godmother.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Second Fairy Godmother in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
A second iteration of the Fairy Godmother, played by Jillian Fargey, makes her only appearance in the episode "[[Hyperion Heights]]". She actually manages to help Cinderella get to the ball, before being captured shortly after by [[Lady Tremaine]], who knocks her out and proceeds to tie her up and cut off her wings. When the Fairy Godmother wakes up, Lady Tremaine mocks her about the loss of her wings, claiming she no longer looks impressive now that she doesn't have any, and uses the fairy's own wand to turn her to dust, using the words "[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]".

===[[Cinderella (2015 film)|''Cinderella'' (2015)]]===
[[File:Cinderell-2015-disneyscreencaps.com-6015.jpg|thumb|250px|The Fairy Godmother in the live-action film.]]
In the [[2015]] live-action ''Cinderella'' film, the Fairy Godmother is played by [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. The character has a slightly larger role in this film than in the animated movie, where she is disguised as an old beggar who watches over Cinderella before revealing herself as the magical being she truly is. She is also the narrator of the film.

The Fairy Godmother is first seen as an aforementioned beggar woman, following the Tremaine family's departure to the Royal ball. As Cinderella falls into despair, the beggar woman arrives and asks for nourishment, to which Cinderella obliges. Afterward, she reveals herself to be the girl's Fairy Godmother and, like the original film, grants her access to the ball. Before she departs, the Fairy Godmother casts a further spell to ensure that her step-family will not recognize her, warns Cinderella of the time limit, and sees her off after bestowing a pair of magical glass slippers, that will ultimately lead to the girl's happy ending.

===''[[Descendants]]''===
[[File:Normal desc 18313.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Fairy Godmother in ''Descendants''.]]
In the television movie, the Fairy Godmother is played by Melanie Paxson. She is the headmistress of [[Auradon Prep]] and has a daughter named [[Jane (Descendants)|Jane]] who is shy and insecure but fascinated with magic, even if she doesn't let her daughter use it. When the descendants of the heroes' sworn enemies come to [[Auradon]], they have been tasked by their parents to steal her [[Magic Wand|magic wand]].

While most of the kingdom is against the idea of villain kids coming to Auradon, Fairy Godmother attempts to be a mentor figure to the kids and tries to teach them how to be good in her new Remedial Goodness class.

During [[Ben (Descendants)|Prince Ben]]'s Coronation, it is the Fairy Godmother's role to knight him using her wand. However, the wand is stolen by Jane, who had been manipulated by [[Mal]], and the barrier to the [[Isle of the Lost]] is broken, allowing [[Maleficent]] to escape. When she appears at the Coronation, the Fairy Godmother confronts her with her wand but is swiftly defeated and frozen. When Maleficent is defeated, the Fairy Godmother reveals that she has shrunk down to the size of the love in her heart (she is now a tiny lizard instead of a dragon) and uses her magic to unfreeze everyone else.

Despite her younger appearance in the film, [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] refers to her as an "old bat".

===''[[Descendants 2]]''===
Melanie Paxson reprises the role of the Fairy Godmother.

==Printed media==
===''[[Mistress of All Evil: A Tale of the Dark Fairy]]''===
The Fairy Godmother appears in flashbacks in the fourth book written by [[Serena Valentino]]. She works as an instructor at the Fairy Academy. [[Maleficent]], the [[Blue Fairy]], [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]] are some of her pupils.

It is revealed that Fairy Godmother has a sister (dubbed "Nanny" in the books), who is the headmistress of the Fairy Academy and later serves as a nanny to [[Tulip Morningstar|Princess Tulip]]. Nanny also adopted Maleficent at a few months old. Fairy Godmother does not get along well with her sister because of her adoption of Maleficent, whom she believes to be evil. She also does not trust her sister's allies: [[Lucinda, Ruby, and Martha]], and their younger sister, [[Enchantress|Circe]].

===''[[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel]]''===
The Fairy Godmother appears in the third novel by Melissa de la Cruz. Fearing that their disabled talismans of evil caused the freak storm strikes to end [[King Triton]]'s celebrations, the VKs decide to have the Fairy Godmother destroy them (as she is the most powerful magic user besides [[Maleficent]]). Retrieving her wand from the Museum, Fairy Godmother improvises a version of [[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]] to destroy the talismans. It works, though the wild burst of magic that is released causes the barrier around the Isle to disappear briefly (though because it is invisible no-one noticed).

She also appears later on in the novel, when she catches the VKs trying to "borrow" a speedboat from the marina. Refusing to listen to their excuses, Fairy Godmother escorts them back to [[Auradon Prep]], believing that they simply couldn't help misbehaving. However, right before Fairy Godmother can punish them, the VKs are saved by [[Ben (Descendants)|Ben]], who gives them the cover that they had been on a secret mission for him.

===''[[Kingdom Keepers]]''===
The Fairy Godmother makes a small cameo in the final book of the saga ''Disney At Last'', where she helps [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] and [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] gather all of the heroes to attend a meeting at the [[Fantasyland Theatre]].

==Video games==
===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Fairy Godmother KHIIIRM.png|left|thumb|339x339px]]
In ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', which sets ten years before the first game, the Fairy Godmother watches over the poor [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]], who begins the world's storyline serving [[Lady Tremaine]], [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]], and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]] like in the classic Walt Disney film. When she finds herself unable to attend the ball, the Fairy Godmother appears before her, dressing her in an elegant gown for [[Prince Charming]]'s royal ball, and creating a carriage using a pumpkin with her magic. After Cinderella was sent off to the ball, she asks [[Terra]] if he has a heart that believes in dreams.

When Prince Charming begins his search for Cinderella, Lady Tremaine locks the poor girl in the attic room. The Fairy Godmother appears before [[Aqua]], asking her to help Cinderella before shrinking her to the size of a mouse and transporting her into the inside of the manor where she helps Jaq get the key to Cinderella. She is seen at the gate with Aqua when they observe the reunion of the couple, and she tells her about Terra and renews Aqua's hope.

During the ending credits, she can be seen watching over Cinderella and Prince Charming from the balcony with [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq]] and then filling the ballroom with joyful fireworks.

Sometime prior to the events of ''Kingdom Hearts'', her world, Castle of Dreams, was destroyed by the Heartless, but she managed to escape safely. [[Sora]] and friends first met her in [[Traverse Town]], where she was living with [[Merlin]] in his house. She stayed in the form of a small carriage (similar to the one that Cinderella uses to arrive at the Ball) and only assumed her true form when Sora needed to talk to her. Somehow, she knows that Cinderella is still alive somewhere and shares her worries with Sora.

Whenever Sora found a new Summon Gem, he gave it to her so she could restore that being's spirit, allowing Sora to summon them in battle. After Sora obtains all six summons, she gives Donald the [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Lord Fortune|Lord Fortune]] staff.

After Sora seals [[Kingdom Hearts]], the Fairy Godmother returns to her world with Cinderella.

She reappears in the ending of the ReMind DLC of ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', having been asked by Merlin and [[Yen Sid]] to help out in the search for Sora by looking into [[Riku]]'s dreams.

Fairy Godmother then appears in the ending of ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory]]'' where she and Riku show up in Radiant Garden, where after she introduces herself to a stunned Ansem the Wise, Even, and Ienzo, she explains that the clue of finding Sora involves three people which includes both Riku's dreams and Kairi's memories. After Ienzo explains that they examined Kairi's heart and discovered another world that is not of darkness nor light. After Riku mentions the dreams he was having of a city with large buildings, Ansem recognizes that this place is actually outside their reality. When Kairi mentions she was planning to ask Mickey or Yen Sid about this, Fairy Godmother states it is unlikely that either of them would known, but reminds her there are three people, and she would introduce them to that third person.

Fairy Godmother then transports Riku and Kairi to the Final World to introduce them to the Nameless Star, who reveals that this character came from the other side, because though her form was taken from her, she managed to cross over into their reality, but would lose her heart for sure if she tried to go back to her reality. Fairy Godmother states that if it weren't impossible, she would gladly have reverted the Nameless Star to her true form, though Fairy Godmother believes her dream would come true very soon. When Riku asks if this can lead them to Sora, Fairy Godmother explains that first, the Nameless Star must open a path to her world, so they could use the power of waking to go there. After Riku and Kairi realize that the Nameless Star knows Sora, the information they provide her realizes that he is her world Quadratum. While Fairy Godmother points out there is no way of knowing if Sora is there, she believes it is possible.

After Riku uses his Keyblade to open a path, Fairy Godmother explains this is all she can do for them, and after Kairi reluctantly declines to accompany him so she can finish her Keyblade training as well as explain the information they gathered to their friends, Fairy Godmother urges Riku to be careful and avoid being too reckless and only come back if there is trouble. She and Kairi then watch as Riku departs.

===''[[Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey]]''===
The Fairy Godmother is a supporting character in the game. Cinderella's world has been frozen and only Cinderella and the heroine can set things straight. The Godmother was found at [[Cinderella's Château|Cinderella's château]] using her magic to assist the young heroine.
