==Role in the film==
Bug was the tech expert of the police department and (according to the prequel comic) was the creator of the 2-way wrist radio (rather than Diet Smith).

Following a search of [[Big Boy Caprice]]'s club, Bug and his listening device were planted in Big Boy's attic above the conference room at the [[Club Ritz]]. Bug maintained audio surveillance and reported Big Boy's activities to [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]] and the PD. With this information, Dick was able to thwart Big Boy's criminal activities. Most of his men were arrested and Big Boy's empire was crumbling.

A short time later, Big Boy was ranting to [[Pruneface]] about Dick being able to anticipate their every move. Bug accidentally spilled his coffee and it leaked onto the conference table, revealing to the criminals that they were being listened to. Big Boy made a fake phone call telling one of his men to go to the Southside warehouse for a big payoff. Bug reported this to Dick, unaware that he was being used as bait.

Pruneface and [[Influence]] then kidnapped Bug and took him to the warehouse. They prepared to give him a cement bath in the same manner in which [[Lips Manlis]] had been killed. Dick arrived and freed him, using his coat on a hook as a diversion. They both survived the shootout that ensued, though Pruneface did not.

Bug was not involved in the New Year's Eve raid on the Club Ritz.

Bug was also a character in the comic book prequel to the film released by the Walt Disney Company. He was shown giving Dick the original model 2-way wrist radio. He also took an active role in police work, joining [[Sam Catchem]], [[Pat Patton]], and FBI Agent Jim Trailer in the raid on the Mole's underground hideout.

==Trivia==
* Michael J. Pollard had previously co-starred with [[Warren Beatty]] in the film ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' about the real-life criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
