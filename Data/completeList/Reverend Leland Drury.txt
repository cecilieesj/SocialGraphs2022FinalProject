He is a religious crook who wants to collect gold for himself by forcing [[Lily Joseph]]'s tribe out of their land by starving them.

== Role ==
After Leland's visit to Moses' village, he tells Moses to move people before they starve to death, otherwise, he will want his soul.

When Henry goes back to town after meeting Lily's tribe, he sees many hungry people, and Leland explains the poor state the town is in.

After Leland learns that Henry wants to help the tribe return their caribou, he orders his assistant, Mr. Heath to assassinate Henry. As Mr. Heath takes aim, Henry's mule blocks the way and Mr. Heath flees.

After Henry and Lily find the caribou, they fall into Leland's mine. They decide to steal some dynamite to clear the path, but along the way, Henry spots Leland, and in anger over his betrayal shoots him. Lily stays behind to give Henry time to escape, and she is captured by the miners. Henry escapes the mine, and White Fang defends him from the remaining miners while he sets the dynamite. The explosion clears the path and frees the animals. Henry and White Fang go back to save Lily. As White Fang holds off Leland, Henry frees Lily, and they make to escape. The screw on the carriage comes loose, sending the carriage careening towards a cliff as the horses run off. Henry and Lily jump clear before they go over, and Leland catches onto the cliff edge. Leland is shocked to find the animals running free. Before he can do any more harm, he is trampled to death by the very animals he had imprisoned.
