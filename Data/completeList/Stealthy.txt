{{Quote|No, we sneak out through the courtyard.|Stealthy to [[Snow White]]|7:15 A.M.}}
'''Stealthy''' is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. He makes his first appearance in "[[7:15 A.M.]]" and is portrayed by Geoff Gustafson. He is the brother of the seven dwarfs and is killed by one of [[King George]]'s guards.

== History ==

=== Before the First Curse ===
Born on sundown along with six of his other brothers, a newly born dwarf picks up a magic axe which reveals his name to be Stealthy. He is assigned with his brethren to mine for diamonds. One night, Stealthy catches [[Grumpy|Dreamy]] trying to sneak out and advises him to come to him next time he wants to try and slip away. The other dwarfs are awaken and Dreamy explains to Stealthy and the others he is in love and leaving. They all congratulate him and Stealthy watches as his brothers hug.

Grumpy is sent to prison and so Stealthy sneaks into the [[King George]]'s castle along with his brothers to free him. While [[Doc]] creates sleeping gas to knock out the guards, Stealthy sneaks into the dungeons where he manages to liberate Grumpy. He notices a [[Snow White|young woman]] in the cell next to Grumpy and comments on her beauty. As they leave, Grumpy decides to unlock the woman's cell and the two also accommodate Snow White, leaving with her. They travel underground, and against the advise of Snow White, they leave through the courtyard who is separated from the two. Although they manage to escape the prison, they are caught on the grounds and when Stealthy tries to flee with Grumpy, he is shot with an arrow by one of the guards and killed.

Due to his unfinished business, Stealthy is sent to the [[Underworld]], where he is unable to move on until his business is completed.

=== After the First Curse ===
Having found that the new author is helping the inhabitants of the Underworld move on, Stealthy waits in line for his page to be written which informs him of his unfinished business. When he receives the page, he comments that he didn't realise how much resentment he held against Bashful, and thanks Henry, and asks him to tell his brothers how much he misses them. Henry mentions to him that Grumpy often talks about him.

=== Evil Queen's Wish Reality ===
In an alternate universe created by the [[Evil Regina|Evil Queen]] in which [[Emma Swan|Emma]] was never the Savior and the dark curse was never cast, Stealthy is shown to be alive and is seen present with the rest of his brothers at [[Henry Mills|Henry]]'s coronation.
