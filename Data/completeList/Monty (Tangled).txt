'''Monty''' (often known as '''Uncle Monty''') is an elderly shopkeeper in the show ''[[Tangled: The Series]]''.

==Background==
He is well known by everyone in the Kingdom and everyone loves him. However, despite his reputation of being the nicest man in the kingdom, he dislikes the [[Rapunzel|Princess]] because she changed [[Corona]]'s traditions. He also comes from a long line of Gopher Grab champions, and everyone in his family has won the Kingdom's Good Will Gopher Grab. Up until his debut in "[[Rapunzel's Enemy]]", Monty was never able to win the tournament until Rapunzel, in disguise, helped him fulfill his dream. Despite Rapunzel helping him win the tournament and saving his life, Monty still chooses to remain enemies with her, inspiring Rapunzel to do the same. But still, he does seem to appreciate her helping him to finally fulfill his dream.

In "[[One Angry Princess]]", Monty still holds a mutual dislike for Rapunzel to a degree but is far less hostile than before. At one point, he genuinely commends Rapunzel's on her selflessness in helping prove [[Attila]]'s innocence after he was accused of vandalizing Monty's shop. When Rapunzel apologizes for the damage done to Monty's establishment, Monty says it's okay and explains that he was planning on redecorating the shoppe anyway, and implies that he had been inspired by Rapunzel to do so. By the end, Attila is proven innocent, and a merge is created between his bakery and Monty's shoppe, now known as "Monty's Sweet Shoppe with Attila the Bun's Bakery".

Despite his negative feelings for Rapunzel, in "[[Hiccup Fever]]" he willingly tries to help the princess cure her hiccups along with the rest of Corona.  

In the season 3 premiere, Monty isn't too happy to see that Rapunzel has returned to Corona but smiles when Rapunzel is happy to see him. Monty appears throughout the season and although his fear is not revealed in "[[Be Very Afraid]]", Monty is among those who watch Lance's performance to help them get over their fears.

Monty later plays a big part in trying to defeat [[Zhan Tiri]] in "[[Plus Est En Vous]]", along with other citizens of Corona, and goes to help Rapunzel along with everyone. Monty is later seen celebrating happily ever after with the rest of the kingdom following Zhan Tiri's demise and witnesses Rapunzel becoming queen of [[Corona]].

* Monty's design was inspired by a mix of Captain Kangaroo and [[Eric Goldberg]].
* Although Monty does not appear in season 2, he is mentioned by Eugene's clone in "[[Mirror, Mirror (Tangled)|Mirror, Mirror]]".
* He dislikes Rapunzel.
* Despite not getting along with each other for a while, it appears in season 3 that Rapunzel and Monty have gotten over their dislike for each other.
