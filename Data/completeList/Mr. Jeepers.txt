[[File:Mr_Jeepers.png|thumb]]'''Mr. Jeepers''' is a stuffed penguin owned by a male citizen of Shuggazoom City. He and his owner are used for comic relief in the show ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]''.Â <span style="line-height:1.5em;">In "[[Snowbound]]", when [[Nova (Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!)|Nova]] had become extremely mad and heated up the city, Mr. Jeepers caught on fire. He is sometimes presumed alive. For example, in the episode "[[Ghosts of Shuggazoom]]", the wraiths can only affect living things, and Mr. Jeepers is seen with his owner, both bearing the mark. No matter what happens, Mr. Jeepers always ends up with his owner again.</span>
