[[File:Ffoic 3rdstreetbandits-0.png|thumb|250px]] '''The 3rd Street Bandits''' are antagonists in ''[[Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil]]''. They are a group of four bikers who steal ice cream and candy from kids and people. All but one of them are heavyweight and obese. The chief of them oddly has whiskers. The last member, who is tall and skinny, is absent-minded due to him saying: "You know, I'm really not feeling it today" when the others mount. When that happens, the chief gives him the evil eye. Their first and only appearance is in "[[Fistful of Ice Cream]]".
