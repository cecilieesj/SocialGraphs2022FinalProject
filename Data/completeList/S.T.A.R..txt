{{Quote|Who's the flashy black hat?|V.I.N.CENT asking about S.T.A.R.}}
'''S.T.A.R.''' (also known as '''Special Troops/Arms Regiment''') was the prototype and captain of the Sentry Robots, who appeared in ''[[The Black Hole]]''.

==Background==
According to [[B.O.B.]] he was [[Hans Reinhardt|Hans Reinhardt's]] number one until he built [[Maximilian]] and now commands the Sentry Robots.

[[V.I.N.CENT]] first meets S.T.A.R. with other robots playing shooting range. He was known to be a sharpshooter until B.O.B. went against him in a game once and beat him. He got so upset he blew a fuse but had his revenge in the end by doing terrible harsh things to B.O.B.

Later, he went against B.O.B. again, only this time he cheated by bumping him allowing him to win. V.I.N.CENT then stepped forward to challenge him to the same game and won. At the same time, he shot S.T.A.R. in the chest. S.T.A.R. became so furious over losing he once again blew a fuse as V.I.N.CENT mentioned he cannot stand a ''Sore Loser''.

It is unclear what happens after the [[Sentry Robots]] take the broken down droid. It's possible that S.T.A.R. was taken to an infirmary to be fixed up. S.T.A.R. was presumed destroyed when Hans Reinhardt and Maximilian flew the [[U.S.S. Cygnus]] into the black hole.
