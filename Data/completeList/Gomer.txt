'''Gomer''' is a tall bear with a small head who serves as the house piano player in the [[Country Bear Jamboree]] attractions at the Disney theme parks.
==Biography==
From 1972's Country Bear Jamboree record album:

''Gomer is the piano player, but he didn’t always play country and western music. His training was classical. He began pawing the ivories while a cub and practiced days and nights for many years. Finally, he went to New York, much to the relief of his neighbors. There he studied Bearlioz, and his favorite composition was "Night on Bear Mountain." When he heard himself referred to as the “lard of Juilliard,” he quit the concert stage and went home to the hills. He is highly regarded by the other musicians because he can play in a key other than C.''

== Trivia ==
He was mentioned by Henry as one of the celebrities who performed at [[Country Bear Hall]] in ''[[The Country Bears]]''.
