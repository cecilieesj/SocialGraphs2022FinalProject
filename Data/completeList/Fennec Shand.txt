{{Quote|The only person you can rely on is yourself.|Fennec Shand.}}
'''Fennec Shand''' is a recurring antagonist turned anti-hero of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, making her debut in ''[[The Mandalorian]]''. Upon the formation of the [[Galactic Empire]], Fennec was a new member of the Bounty Hunter's Guild. Now a feared assassin working during the era of the [[New Republic]], Fennec remained hidden on the planet [[Tatooine]] after the arrest of her employers where she crossed paths with the bounty hunter [[Mandalorian]] [[Din Djarin]] aka Mando, who was almost fatal to her until she was saved by [[Boba Fett]] with whom she now works as a partner.

==Background==
===Personality===
{{Quote|Fennec Shand is an elite mercenary. She made her name killing for all the top crime syndicates, including the Hutts. If you go after her, you won't make it past sunrise.|[[Din Djarin]] about Fennec Shand's reputation.}}
The extent of Fennec's personality is unknown other than her reputation as a feared and ruthless dangerous assassin, having no qualms about even shooting a child if she had to. She also turns out to be very cunning and manipulative, using Toro Calican's ego to turn on Mando, although her real aim was to kill the young bounty hunter after he frees her by feigning an alliance, but it's done shot in the abdomen instead when Toro realizes her true plan, showing that she underestimates her opponents too much.

Despite her coldness and immoral deeds, Fennec has a certain sense of honor, becoming a reliable ally of Boba Fett after he saved her life. She subsequently became an ally with her former enemy Mando when they helped each other on Tython and continued to ally until Grogu was rescued. She is also not devoid of sympathy, freeing a female slave during the capture of Jabba's palace.

Fennec displayed fierce loyalty to Fett, fighting side-by-side with him against a group of Night Wind assassins and followed Fett's order to capture an assassin alive without question. She later helped capture [[Black Krrsantan]] after he attempted to assassinate Fett, saving the Mods in the procress. She also had a deep appreciation for manners and gratitude, something she noted after Drash thanked her for saving her life.

*'''Expert Fighter:''' Fennec is a dread martial arts fighter. She is able to easily defeat beating men barely taller than her or younger. In her youth, Fennec was able to compete with [[Cad Bane]], one of the toughest bounty hunters the galaxy is known to in the Old Republican times.
*'''Expert Shooter and Sniper:''' Fennec is a skilled shooter and also excels in long range shooting.
*'''Master Assassin:''' Fennec is known for her skill in assassination which has caught the attention of the underworld. On her own, Fennec was able to eliminate all the conspirators of the Mos Espa conflict.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Mandalorian]]''===
====Season 1====
In "The Gunslinger", Having to acquire money for repairs to his ship, Mando agrees to form an alliance with novice bounty hunter, Toro Calican, to capture Fennec who is hiding on [[Tatooine]] in exchange for the credits. Upon stumbling upon another dead bounty hunter in the Dune Sea, Mando is hit by the shots of Fennec's MK snipers rifle from the heights but protected by his beskar, he takes cover with Toro and decides to wait until nightfall. to surprise the assassin because they are not to the advantage during the day.

At nightfall, the duo rush at Speeder towards Fennec who tries to shoot them down before the Flash charges of the Mandalorian blind the vision of her helmet but she still manages to detonate Mando's speeder after that. Toro appears behind her with his gun pointed at his head, only for the woman to disarm him and physically dominate him until Mando joins the scene, holding Fennec at bay. The handcuffed assassin, Mando is forced to leave Toro watched over Fennec after the recruit refuses to leave the Mandalorian with "his bounty." At dawn, Fennec attempts to manipulate Toro into revealing Mando's betrayal of the Bounty Hunter Guild on Nevarro and that the two of them could get the better of him. While Fennec seems to have managed to convince him, Toro shoots her in the abdomen, realizing that she would have killed him if he had untied her. Mando later finds Fennec's seemingly lifeless body and realizes that Toro has overtaken him. 

The next night after Toro is killed by Mando, an unknown man approaches Fennec's remains.

====Season 2====
In "The Tragedy", Boba Fett confronts Mando to retrieve his armor, accompanied by Fennec whom he has tasked with keeping [[Grogu]], an individual of [[Yoda]]'s species under Djarin's protection, in her sights. Beginning a compromise, Mando questioned Fennec about her survival and she revealed that Boba was the person who found her in the desert before replacing her injuries with cybernetics, causing Fennec to owe Fett a life debt. They are then caught off guard by a sudden arrival of [[stormtroopers]] from the remnant of [[Moff Gideon]]. 

Ambushing from the heights, Fennec brought down several stormtroopers and destroyed a heavy blaster by rolling a boulder over it. As the skirmish heats up, she finds herself surrounded with Mando by enemy soldiers, but Boba's sudden arrival in his Mandalorian armor turns the tide. Although they are held firm, Mando's ship is destroyed and Grogu is captured by the Dark Troopers. Boba chases them but gives up when he discovers the cruiser and therefore the return of the empire, to Fennec's disbelief because the New Republic is supposed to be under surveillance in this sector. With the loss of Grogy, Boba and Fennec swear to help Mando get his adopted son back as a thank you for returning Boba's armor.

In "The Believer", After recruiting the ex-imperial, Migs Mayfeld, Fennec accompanies the group to the planet Morak where an underground Imperial refinery could give them Gideon's position. When Mando suggests that Fennec take the place of Cara Dune to infiltrate the refiner, Fennec contradicts the idea because it is wanted by the BSI and would quickly be unmasked. Finally, Mando and Mayfeld take the infliction part of the mission while Fennec and Cara stay in cover. The two men end up unmasked after recovering Gideon's location but with the help of Boba, Fennec, and Cara, they manage to escape.

In "The Rescue", After additional recruiting of [[Bo-Katan Kryze]] and [[Koska Reeves]] and the capture of Doctor Pershing, The group begins Gideon's Light Cruiser infiltration plan. With Boba pretending to shoot them while they are aboard a Lambda shuttle to fool the Imperial remnant, Fennec, Bo-Katan, Cara and Koska launch a violent offensive on the Imperials while Djarrin goes to the cells of detention to save Grogu. Once in the checkpoint, the five women realize that Gideon is not there. Mando later joins them with a captive Gideon and a rescued Grogu. Unfortunately, the Dark Troopers storm the checkpoint, the group being separated from the droids only by the armored doors giving way. Suddenly an X-wings enters the cruiser and the pilot destroys several Dark Troopers all by himself with a lightsaber and the Force. In a final attempt, Gideon shoots Bo-Katan and Mando while wanting to shoot down Grogu before being held in play by Fennec, Koska and Cara and then being knocked out by the ex trooper while attempting to kill himself. The mysterious individual then joins the group, revealing himself to be [[Luke Skywalker]], having been contacted by Grogu on Tython. Fennec subsequently witnesses the farewell between Mando and Grogu when the Mandalorian lets the child follow Luke and [[R2-D2]].

Fennec later storms [[Jabba the Hutt|Jabba]]'s palace, slaughtering Bib Fortuna's men and freeing a slave once in the process. Boba joins Fennec and kills himself the late Jabba's former valet before sitting on his throne with Fennec sitting next to him drinking Spotchka.

===''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]''===
More than two decades earlier, Fennec was contacted by Raspar Six who informed him of the presence of a young girl named [[Omega]] on Pantora that Fennec had been tracking for some time. Fennec meets Omega as she accidentally split with her friends, skillfully gaining her confidence until Hunter intervenes, allowing Omega to escape while the bounty hunter and ex-sergeant trooper briefly engage in unarmed combat. Fennec continues to stalk Omega in town, catching up with her at a communications tower and attempting to flee by vehicle until Hunter retrieves the girl. Once her target out of Pantora, Fennec paid Six to inform her if the Bad Batch ever came back here before informing her employer that she will going to continue pursuing Omega.

Alerted by Kaminoan Nala Se who is also her secret employer, that Omega has been captured by [[Cad Bane]], Fennec intercepts the veteran bounty hunter on Bora Vio. She immediately assassinates Taun We who came to hand over the bounty for the capture of Omega and then confronts Bane personally before arriving the site where Taun We was murdered. With Bane knocked out by an explosion, Fennec again encounters Omega in the disaffected cloning facility on the planet where she tries to claim Omega by explaining she's trying to help her. However, the girl remains suspicious of Fennec and refuses to trust her since the incident on Pantora before she escapes her after a failed attack from Bane's droid, Todo 360. Bane returns to attack Fennec, turning out to be more of a match against her. Clone Force 99 manages to rescue Omega during the clash, so Fennec escapes from Bora Vio after sabotaging Bane's ship so he cannot pursue her or the clones. She then contacts Nala Se to ask for her payment for having been able to prevent Omega from being brought back to Kamino as had been agreed from the beginning while offering her services in the future if Nala Se needs her again.

===''[[The Book of Boba Fett]]''===
In "Stranger in a Strange Land", Shortly after Boba's rise to power, Fennec comes to see the latter healing himself in a bacta tank to tell him that Jabba's former henchmen have come to pay homage to him because of his new status. After having received a delegate from Aquailish and Dokk Strassi, the duo meet the butler of the mayor of Mos Espa who does not stop chattering without having to pay tribute, infuriating Fennec who thinks of executing him until Boba decides to him. let go alive so that he makes it clear to the mayor that the former bounty hunter is now in charge. Two Gamorreans formerly in Fortuna's service are then introduced to them and swear allegiance to Boba, though Fennec doubts the idea is a good one.

On their way to Mos Espa for business accompanied by their new bodyguards, Fennec and Boba exchange their opposing opinions on how to show power, the former finding that being carried on a litter box is a good way to show it while Boba expresses his objection. They then enter the Sanctuary, a cantina run by the Twi'lek Garsa Fwip, with whom they've come to talk business. Once Garsa made aware of Fortuna's replacement, Fennec and Boba began to return to the palace. As Fennec explains to her boss that fear can be stronger than respect, they are ambushed by helmeted attackers armed with stun batons and ray shields. Initially disadvantaged and nearly defeated, Fennec and Boba receive help from the two Gamorreans but Boba ends up terribly exhausted. Fennec pursues the last two survivors with orders to bring them back alive. She catches them on the rooftops and disarms their single stun baton to keep them at bay then pushes one to a deadly fall, choosing to keep only one alive.

In "The Tribes of Tatooine", Fennec takes his prisoner back to Jabba's palace where 8D8 identifies him as a member of the Night Wind. To make the captive speak, Fennec drops him into the [[Rancor]]'s pit and he eventually admits that the mayor had employed him before seeing that there are no more Rancors. Boba's group then go to Mok Shaiz directly at the town hall to question him, only for him to have the Night Wind's assassin executed and to claim that they should go to the Sanctuary to gather information sooner. There, Garsa reveals that Jabba's cousins covet the deceased Hutt's territory, shortly before they arrive outside the cantina accompanied by the Wookie bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]]. Following the Twins' departure, Fennec suggests that Boba consider asking permission from the Hutt Council to kill the Twins, to which Boba replies that may already be the case.

In "The Streets of Mos Espa", following the request of a water seller, Boba's group will confront a gang of thieves made up of cybernetically modified humans and raging in the working-class district. Boba ends up recruiting the gang as his henchmen, however.

As night falls, Krrsantan infiltrates the palace to assassinate Boba but he is overwhelmed by the cyborgs who push the Wookie into the pit at the Rancor, only for him to cling to the ledge until Fennec knocks him into by throwing a dagger in the hand. In the early morning, a Fennec having lunch with Boba suggests that he take matters into his own hands, just for the duo to confront the Twins who have come to the palace gate to apologize for the assassination attempt by offering a Rancor and giving up the territory of Jabba which had in fact been promised to Mok Shaiz. As the Twins depart, Boba releases Krrsantan, which Fennec does not find prudent. The group then raids the town hall and captures with the help of the cyborgs the butler who was trying to escape. Shortly after that, Pykes land in Mos Espa.

In "The Gathering Storm", the events leading up to the meeting between Boba and Fennec are explored. After being found by Boba, an unconscious Fennec is taken to Mos Eisley where a cybernetician replaces her damaged organic parts with her current implants. She later wakes up around a fire by a Boba offering to repay her debt by helping him retrieve his Slave One guarded by Bib Fortuna. After the ship is recovered, Fennec begins to respect Boba enough to consider continuing their partnership. The duo then attack the [[Sarlacc]] and Fennec ends up killing the foul creature by making it swallow a sonic charge.

In the present, Fennec is present at the palace when Boba brings together the heads of families shortly after engaging Krrsantan to ask them to remain neutral in the coming war against the Pykes.

In "The Return of Mandalorian", Fennec recruits Mando from Mos Eisley to get a new ship.

In "From the Desert Comes a Stranger", Fennec provides the briefing to prepare for the confrontation against the Pykes.

In "In The Name of Honor", Fennec is present in the ruined Sanctuary following a bombing by the Pykes. When only she is left with Boba and Mando, her old enemy Cad Bane approaches the burnt-out cantina to impose an ultimatum on Boba before Mos Espa is stormed by the Pykes aided by the criminals under orders of the heads of families who finally betrayed Boba. Throughout the conflict, Fennec avoids direct confrontation to finally corner the leader of the Pykes, the three heads of families and Mok Shaiz in their hiding place and assassinate them one after the other.

Following the victory of Boba and the death of Bane, the inhabitants of Mos Espa continue to thank the Master Assassin and their current Daimo who mockingly affirms to Fennec that they are not made for that. The duo then joins Black Krrsantan and the cyborgs to celebrate their victory.

==Trivia==
*She is based mostly on the fennec fox, an animal well known for its cunning and ability to survive. Ironically, this canine lives in desert environments and Fennec's first appearance was on the desert planet Tatooine.
*Fennec's helmet does not have a voice amplifier in either ''[[The Mandalorian]]'' or ''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch|The Bad Batch]]'', but gains one in ''[[Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett|The Book of Boba Fett]]''. In ''The Bad Batch'', Fennec doesn't have her tattoo on her left cheek yet.
*She appears to have left her helmet on Tython after using it as a projectile against the Stormtroopers, as she is not shown with it at all in the last two episodes of season 2. However, in ''The Book of Boba Fett'', Fennec is seen wearing her helmet, meaning she was able to return to Tython and reclaim her helmet. It is also possible that she did not leave it on Tython and simply ceased wearing it for a time.
