=== Background ===
In the early 20th century, Samantha Sterling was a world-renowned explorer and cabaret singer.  By [[1928]] she was enlisted in "The Adventurers Club", a group of explorers which was branched off from the ''[[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]'' by SEA-member [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]].  She would attend the annual [[December 31|New Year's Eve]] festivities in the club's headquarters on Pleasure Island in Lake Buena Vista and in 1928 was deemed victor of the, "Balderdash Cup" for having the best true-life adventure story.

At some point, Samantha became close with club-affiliate [[Trader Sam]] who she spent five days and ten nights with.  In [[1941]], Pleasure Island was hit by a massive hurricane and subsequently abandoned though the club persisted its operations.  She also became affiliated with S.E.A. aviator [[Jock Lindsey]] who she frequented the bar of in the 1950s.
