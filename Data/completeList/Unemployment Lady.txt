==An Extremely Goofy Movie==

In the movie when [[Goofy]] loses his job at Beekins Toy Factory, he goes to an Unemployment Office, hoping to find a job. He sits down in the office of an Unemployment Lady, who is a counselor there as she reads his paperwork. She finds out that Goofy does not have a college degree and says that the office can only help people get jobs who have degrees and suggests that Goofy should return to college to get a degree but Goofy thinks he is too old for college to which the Unemployment Lady tells Goofy that he is never too old to learn a new trick and she sends him to the college that [[Max Goof|Max]] is at so he can get a degree and find a job. She later appears in Goofy's Flashbacks during the "Come On, Get Happy" sequence.
