|status=Alive}}'''Bugsy''' is the deuteragonist in the 2005 Disney film ''[[Valiant]]''. He is one of [[Valiant (character)|Valiant]]'s friends in the Royal Homing Pigeon Service. 
Bugsy is a dirty, smelly, and extremely gassy pigeon who says he has a rare feather condition. He is Valiant's best friend. In the beginning of the film, he was a con artist tricking two crows giving them their crumbs, that made them very angry and were going to hurt Bugsy, but Valiant literally dropped in on the crows, and Bugsy joined the Royal Homing Pigeons to save his tail feathers. After the harsh treatment he and the other pigeons receive from the military pigeon, Bugsy considered leaving. He then had a change of heart and helped deliver the message back to base before [[Von Talon]] got his fellow pigeons. His foul body odor ended up being a valuable asset when he needed to wake up a comatose Mercury.
