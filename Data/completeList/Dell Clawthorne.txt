'''Dell Clawthorne''' is [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] and [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith's]] father in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
The Clawthornes were famous for carving palismen, and Dell was one of the best carvers of the family. He was responsible for helping [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] carve [[Owlbert]]. However, Dell's palismen carving days came to an end after Eda attacked him when she turned into Owl Beast. In a tussle, he lost his left eye and injured his left hand. Due to his injuries, he was no longer able to carve palismen, but found a new purpose in working with the [[Bat Queen]] to preserve the forests that produced palisman wood.

Eda distanced herself from her father shortly after the incident with the Owl Beast, and even though he forgave her she still blamed herself for ending his palisman carving career. She was unable to face her father for a very long time, and every time Dell tried to see her she'd always managed to evade him. Dell eventually caught up with his daughter, and the two finally made peace with each other.

==Trivia==
*It is hinted in "[[Elsewhere and Elsewhen]]" that the tower next to [[The Owl House (location)|the Owl House]] used to belong to Dell before Eda moved there.
