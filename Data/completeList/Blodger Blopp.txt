'''Blodger Blobbert Blopp''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated seriesÂ ''[[Miles from Tomorrowland]]''. He is a small alien made entirely of green ooze. He is a member of the [[Cosmic Explorers]] and a friend of [[Miles Callisto]]. Later in the series, he becomes a member of [[Mission Force One]].

==Trivia==
*In "[[The Blobbysitters]]", Blodger has become an older brother of twins.
*Blodger gets a robot tortoise named [[Sheldon (Miles from Tomorrowland)|Sheldon]] in "[[Galactech: How to Build a Robot-Pet]]".
*When feeling sad, Blodger turns blue.
*In "[[The First Day of Galactic School]]," Blodger reveals he gets anxious about going to new places. He also implies through just arriving at Galactic School that he is two years younger than Miles. This makes sense, considering how he is smaller than Miles, can be socially naive, has younger siblings who are babies, and struggles to keep up with the other Cosmic Explorers.
