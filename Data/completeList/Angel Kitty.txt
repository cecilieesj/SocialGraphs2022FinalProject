==Background==
She is portrayed as a Christmas tree ornament, which is a mix of a cat and an angel, hence her name. She also carries a trumpet, although it is destroyed later. Her lines consist exclusively of Christmas-related wisdom, often melting the hearts of those present in the process (including even one of the Battlesaurs).

==Role in the film==
She is first seen when [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] uses her in her game in which she is the terrifying 'kittysaurus' which annoys Trixie somewhat, as she has never been played with as a dinosaur, despite the fact that she is one. When Bonnie is heading off to her friend [[Mason]]'s house, Angel Kitty is one of the five toys she takes with her, along with [[Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], [[Rex]], and [[Trixie]]. Upon arrival at Mason's, she is thrown into the playroom by Bonnie after being offered to play the new games console. When Trixie spots a small Battlesaur, she runs after it, followed by the others, although Angel Kitty has trouble keeping up as she is very small. She is later shown to become friends with one of the little Battlesaurs, treating it like a pet. She is then captured by [[the Cleric]] and his minions, and stored inside the large Goliathon, who "regurgitates" her along with Woody and Buzz, with some help from a controlled Rex.

Later on, she is being taken to "The Pit" to be executed. The Pit, however, is just a ventilation fan on the floor, which is lethal to toys. As they are being carried to it, the Battlesaurs start chanting and banging their staffs into the floor, and Angel Kitty starts playing her trumpet to the "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" tune. A Battlesaur grabs it from her hand, and throws it into the pit, destroying it in the fan. Trixie and [[Reptillus Maximus]] manage to get Bonnie and Mason to come into the playroom, which ultimately saves Woody and Buzz's life, mere inches from being shredded. After Angel Kitty enjoys playtime with the others, she is returned home to [[Bonnie's House|Bonnie's house]]. At the very end, after Trixie now seems satisfied with her role in Bonnie's life, Angel Kitty shares her final piece of wisdom: "Be grateful for your gifts; they are all around you," which warms the others, but when they look back after a moment's glance, Angel Kitty has mysteriously disappeared.

==Trivia==
*Angel Kitty bears a striking resemblance to {{WikipediaLink|Hello Kitty}}.
*It is possible that Angel Kitty is an actual angel of peace and wisdom.
**Evidence is proven several times in the special, due to her innocence and purity.
**When she gives her last line of wisdom, she is gone as soon as the other toys turn to look at her.
