'''Rumpelstiltskin''' is a minor character in [[The 7D|the ''7D]] season two episode "[[Bummer Vacation]]". Hildy's father recognizes him from his past while on a family vacation as he was looking for them as a part of deal made 25 years ago.

== Physical appearance ==
Rumpelstiltskin wears a green jacket with a brown belt and a green hat with a blue patch. His shorts include dark green and green yellow strips and dark green pointed shoes. He also has large bushy eyebrows, pointy ears and a huge beard.

== In the series ==
The Duke of Drear was an inspiring rock singer, whom twenty-five years ago wanted to get a gold record plaque. So he struck a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to exchange his first-born daughter Hildy for the plaque. However, the deal had seemingly went bad (though the duke still has the plaque) so Rumpelstiltskin started to search for the Duke and Duchess and Hildy to get his due. At the end, he finally spotted the family at the Fancy Shmantzy Beachside Resort and gave chase through the beach. Earlier, The Duke of Drear had mistakes Grumpy for Rumpelstiltskin. Grumpy only actually confronted the duke several times because he was hogging the shrimp sauce that Grumpy wanted to eat his own shrimp with.
