Horace is the green haired henchman of [[Brad  Buttowski|Brad]]. He only appears in a few episodes assisting Brad with [[Pantsy]]. He is Japanese-American (just like Kendall). His hair is covering his eyes, he has yellow rotten teeth, he wears an orange wrist band and he is 1/3 dumb.  Nothing much is known about him, but he was a life guard in "[[Pool Daze]]". As a life guard, he took his job way too seriously. He was voiced by [[Greg Cipes]].
