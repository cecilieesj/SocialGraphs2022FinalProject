{{Quote|That must be [[Beshte|Poa]] - the bad guy everyone's talking about.|Astuto|Poa the Destroyer}}
'''Astuto''' is a character featured in Season 3 of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. She is a female fox that Beshte encounters alongside the other tundra animals.

==Background==
Not much of Astuto's personality is known throughout the series. It is shown that she is sensitive to other big animals that walk past her den. She didn't get along with [[Beshte]] at first due to [[Pinguino]] blaming him for being a nuisance to the penguins and also to the foxes. However, she did apologize to Beshte for their harshness to the hippo.

==Role in the series==
==="[[Poa the Destroyer]]"===
Astuto first appears when [[Beshte]] approaches her as she retreats, as the hippo stomps over her den thinking she agrees with what [[Pinguino]] said as she thinks Beshte is a monster to the animals. She later appears after Beshte calmly talks to a butterfly not afraid of him where she still refuses to talk to him. However, after Beshte saves [[Pinguino]] and the other animals apologize to Beshte for being rude to him, Astuto cheers on with the other tundra animals for saving Pinguino's life. This clears out Beshte's bad reputation.

==="[[Long Live the Queen]]"===
Astuto is one of the animals outside the Tree of Life who feels sad that Queen [[Janna]] is dying. When Janna completes her journey through the Circle of Life, [[Makini]] announces that Janna has already completed her life to which Astuto and the other animals outside mournfully react to her passing and as a tradition, all the animals are gathered at the Willows for a funeral. During the funeral, Astuto is one of the animals who attends Janna's funeral as all the animals who were friends with Janna gave condolences about her. She later appears during the coronation of [[Rani (The Lion Guard)|Rani]] as the new queen of the Tree of Life along with the animals who are happy that the Tree of Life now has a new queen to protect the Tree.

==="[[Triumph of the Roar]]"===
Astuto is one of the victims being attacked by [[Makucha's Army]] when they bring reinforcements as the Army attacks the Tree of Life. After mastering the [[Roar of the Elders|power of the Roar]], Kion uses it to save Astuto and her fox leash from being defeated by [[Smun]], his porcupines, and [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]].

==="[[Journey to the Pride Lands]]"===
Astuto only appears during the musical number "[[Of the Same Pride]]". Here, Rani and Kion save one of her fox kits stuck in a pit due to a tree fallen on it as Rani reunites the kit to her mother.
