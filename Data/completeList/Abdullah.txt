== Role in the film ==
Abdullah is first seen planning to capture Duma with Patel and Nigel. When the trio goes to the Johnsons' house, Patel sneaks into the house to steal Ted's cheetah whistle. After he got the whistle, they capture Duma.

Abdullah decides to train her for running fast. When the Johnson family go to Patel's store, Ted recognizes the shoe marks on Abdullah's shoe and realizes that he killed Duma's mother and realizes that Patel has captured her, because of his mentioning of Duma being lost. He also realizes that Patel has stolen his whistle.

When Abdullah captures Susan, he tries to stab her until he catches Ted in the act. After he puts Ted and Susan in a cage, they leave for Nairobi. However, Morogo frees Ted and Susan from their cage and go after the trio.

When Abdullah tries to prevent her from winning, Ted snatches his whistle from a cop and blows the whistle and makes Duma go faster and reach the finish line. While Abdullah tries to escape from Duma, she tackles him and Abdullah gets arrested.
