'''The Chief of Police''' is the police chief of [[Spoonerville|Spoonerville's]] police department from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] 1992-1993 animated series, ''[[Goof Troop]].''
==Background==
He appears in only a few episodes, arresting criminals, or in such minor roles as being in television commercials. He is considered one of Spoonerville's top celebrities.

===Personality===
The Chief of Police is a grave man who does not have any patience for nonsense. He takes everything very seriously and does not appreciate others wasting his time.

===Physical appearance===
The Chief of Police is a heavy-set anthropomorphic dog with black fur. He wears a light brown coat, a white collared shirt, a black tie, blue jeans with rolled-up cuffs, brown shoes, and a fedora over his eyes.

===Role in the series===
The Chief of Police appears in the episode "[[Counterfeit Goof]]" where he arrests the criminals Mr. Braxton and S. Slick for making counterfeit money. He also appears in the episode "[[In Goof We Trust]]" where he supervises [[Pete|Pete's]] used car business for honest practices. He then appears in "[[For Pete's Sake (Goof Troop)|For Pete's Sake]]", telling Pete about a murdered man. He later appears in the episode "[[Maximum Insecurity]]", arresting [[Leech (Goof Troop)|Leech]] for framing [[Max Goof|Max]] and [[P.J.]]. His final appearance is a minor role in the episode "[[Buddy Building]]" where [[Harold Hatchback]] convinced him to appear in one of his TV commercials.

==Trivia==
*Unlike wearing a uniform as do most police officers, the Chief of Police wears attire akin to that of a police ''detective'', including a coat and a fedora.
*His voice sounds different in "Buddy Building".
