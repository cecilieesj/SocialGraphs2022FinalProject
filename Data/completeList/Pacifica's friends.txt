==History==
The girls debuted (alongside Pacifica) in "[[Double Dipper]]", attending the party at [[the Mystery Shack]] along with her. They look on as Pacifica demands the party crown from [[Soos Ramirez|Soos]]. They later watch the competition between her and [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]], rooting for Pacifica the entire time, and come with her to her after-party.

They are briefly seen in "[[Irrational Treasure]]", when Pacifica orders them to remove one the children from the maypole on [[Pioneer Day]].

In "[[The Time Traveler's Pig]]", they tag along with Pacifica at the Mystery Fair, and laugh with her as she teases Mabel.

In "[[Boyz Crazy]]", they are among the crowd at the [[Sev'ral Timez]] concert at the Gravity Falls Civic Center and Buffet. The two girls (along with the rest of the audience) start to fight each other over the boys' affections.

==Trivia==
* The magenta-haired one is voiced by Ariel Hirsch, who's the twin sister of the series creator, [[Alex Hirsch]].
* Boyz Crazy was their only speaking role in the entire show.
*In [[The Golf War]] the Lilliputtians had Pacifica's phone and sended a message to someone with the name Tiffany. Tiffany could be one of  Pacifica's friends.
