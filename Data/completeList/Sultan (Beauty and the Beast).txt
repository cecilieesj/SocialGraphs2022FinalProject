'''Sultan''' is a dog who lives at the [[Beast's Castle]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1991]] animated feature film ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', who was turned into a footstool by the [[Enchantress]]' curse.

==Background==
===Personality===
Sultan is a cheerful, excitable, and playful dog.

===Physical appearance===
Under the curse, Sultan was a living pudgy red and yellow footstool with brown wooden legs.

As a dog, he’s described as chubby with light brown fur with darker brown ears and spots.

==Appearances==
===''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''===
In the movie, Sultan is the castle's pet dog who gets turned into a footstool when the castle is put under the spell of the [[Enchantress]]. Sultan makes his first appearance as the footstool when [[Maurice]] enters the castle from being lost in the woods. When Maurice comes to sit down in the [[Beast]]'s chair, Sultan runs up to him and Maurice pets him. Then Sultan gets in front of the chair so that Maurice can put his feet up and get comfortable. Later on, when [[Belle]] comes to stay in the castle, Sultan runs outside to play in the snow and runs to Belle when she gives him a hug. Later on, when [[Gaston]] and the Villagers come to attack the castle, Sultan barks at them to draw [[Lumiere]], [[Cogsworth]], [[Mrs. Potts]], and [[Fifi|Fifi’s]] attention toward them. During the battle, Sultan is seen running from Gaston's friend [[LeFou]] and some other Villagers who are trying to attack him after he stole one of LeFou's shoes. Just when it seems like Sultan is cornered in the kitchen, knives come out of the drawers and the [[Chef Bouche|Stove]] comes to life and scares the Villagers away to save Sultan's life. [[Chip Potts|Chip]] is riding Sultan when he is turned back into a normal dog and Chip is turned back into a little boy. After turning back into a dog, Sultan watches Belle and the Prince dance together with the other residents of the castle. He is also seen in the ending stained glass window.

In the Special Edition-exclusive song "[[Human Again]]", he ends up causing some messes in the [[The Ballroom|ballroom]] while it is being cleaned due to dirty "pawprints" and also proceeds to chase a pillow with cat-like characteristics (referring to the running gag of dogs chasing cats).

===''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]''===
Sultan is first seen in his dog form chasing Chip around the castle. As Chip begins unwrapping a present for him Sultan begins chewing on the paper that Chip has unwrapped. Sultan then sits down and listens to Mrs. Potts to tell the story about Christmas last year. In the story, Sultan appears in his footstool form and watches along with Chip, [[Mrs. Potts]], [[Lumiere]], and [[Cogsworth]] as Belle and the Beast ice-skate together. Later on, when Belle and Chip go out to look for a Christmas Tree on the Castle Grounds, Sultan goes with them but then he hears Fife's piccolo sound from inside the castle and runs in and finds Fife and begins to chase him around until he corners him in a chair but luckily Belle comes and tells Sultan to get down to which Sultan does. Sultan finally appears again back in his dog form in present-day and runs up to Belle and the Prince as they wish everyone a Merry Christmas.

== Live-action appearances ==
===[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|''Beauty and the Beast'' (2017)]]===
The footstool, although in the form of a piano bench, appears in the live-action remake. This incarnation of the footstool is named '''Froufrou''' and is a Yorkshire Terrier apparently owned by [[Wardrobe|Madame de Garderobe]] and her husband [[Cadenza]].

Froufrou is introduced is the castle's dog who lived in the castle with the other residents where the prince was selfish and unkind. Later as the prince is transformed into a hideous beast as punishment, Frou-Frou and all the other residents of the castle are transformed into objects as the spell is cast all around the castle.

Froufrou appears in the form of an anthropomorphic footstool when explores the castle for the first time just as Madame De Garderobe tells him to send Belle to the Beast.  As Belle runs away from the castle in terror, Mrs. Potts sends Froufrou to stop her, but the attempt to stop her fails.

As Gaston sends an angry mob to kill the Beast, Froufrou and the other castle servants join battle and fight against Gaston and his henchmen. As the last petal falls, Froufrou is transformed back into his lifeless form. After the curse is broken, Froufrou transforms back into his puppy form and later watches over everyone dancing in the ballroom during the reprise of the musical number "Beauty and the Beast".

==Trivia==
*His breed is unknown, although he resembles a mutt.
**His overall appearance was a direct contradiction to the prologue, as the Prince in one of the stained glass windows was depicted as owning at least two pedigree-type dogs, one white, and one brown.
**In the 2017 live-action remake, he is identified as a Yorkshire Terrier breed.
*His ears are smaller in the first midquel.
*Sultan wasn't the first 'footstool dog' created by Disney. A similar character appeared in the 1936 [[Mickey Mouse]] short ''[[Thru the Mirror]]'', which explored a similar concept of animated furniture that ''Beauty and the Beast'' had.
