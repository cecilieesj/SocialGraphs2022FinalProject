{{Quote|The name's Tigger! T-I-double-guh-ER! That spells Tigger!|Tigger introducing himself|Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day}}
'''Tigger''' is an energetic, anthropomorphic stuffed tiger belonging to [[Christopher Robin]] who first appeared in [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]]'s [[1968]] short film, ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''. He is one of the best friends of [[Winnie the Pooh]], with an affinity for bouncing.

==Background==
Tigger is a resident of the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], residing in a literal [[Tigger's House|treehouse]]. When Tigger introduces himself, he often says the proper way to spell his name is: "T-I-double-guh-err." As ''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'' indicates, Tigger is Christopher Robin's latest stuffed toy, as the events of the short marks the first meeting between Tigger and Pooh Bear.

Along with his comedic personality and love of bouncing and pouncing, Tigger is known for his theme song, "[[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers]]", in during which he boasts that he is the only tigger in existence. Practically speaking, Tigger's "I'm the only one" statement comes from being the only "tigger" ever made, if one takes into consideration the fact that Pooh, [[Piglet]], [[Eeyore]], and such are all stuffed animals, and homemade ones at that, Tigger is, in fact, the only tigger. Though some ''Pooh'' media make reference to Tigger's relatives, ''The Tigger Movie'' reaffirms that Tigger is, indeed, the only one of his kind.

===Physical Appearance===
{{Quote|What a strange looking creature! Mmm... look at those beady little eyes. And that preposterous chin. And those Ricky-Tickin Striped pajamas.|Tigger on his reflection.}}
Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed animals. Nowadays, he is most widely recognized as reinterpreted by the Disney studios, with distinctive orange and black stripes, beady eyes, a long chin, springy tail, and (the one detail originating from A. A. Milne) his love of bouncing.

===Personality===
Tigger is arguably the most eccentric member of the Hundred Acre Wood. Overly energetic, reckless, and fairly thoughtless, Tigger is somewhat of a troublemaker and causes a fair share of mishaps for both himself and his friends. To his core, however, Tigger is extremely loving and friendly; he means well and tries his best to be of support toward his friends, even if his efforts end in some form of misfortune, such as in ''Christopher Robin'', in which he takes Christopher Robin's papers from his briefcase and replacing them with things from the Hundred Acre Wood to remember him and his friends. He can also be considered the most social of the animals and is exceptionally eager to have his friends join in on his personal joy.

Tigger notably prides himself on being the only "tigger" in existence. This title has given him quite an ego, and he considers himself significantly handsome, debonair, and the "greatest bouncer" in the Hundred Acre Wood. Such egotism is never meant to be malicious, but it often drives Tigger to act without much consideration toward others and it often frustrates people. In ''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'', for example, he bursts into [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]]'s home uninvited, takes and eats his food (claiming he enjoys honey, only to rebuff after actually tasting it and realizing how sticky it is) and absentmindedly leaves Pooh in the state of fear over the mention of honey-stealing [[Heffalumps and Woozles]].

Tigger's rambunctiousness is also directly linked to his relationship with [[Rabbit]], who openly dislikes Tigger's various quirks and even works to knock the latter's ego's down a few times. Rabbit's aggression is often expressed without much notice, but in some cases (such as ''[[Piglet's Big Movie]]'' and ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]''), Tigger has taken note and this leads to mild contention.

With his fun-loving nature and general innocence, Tigger is about as optimistic and carefree as Pooh himself. Rarely ever upset or depressed, Tigger tends to look on the brighter side of a situation; so much so, that he is somewhat obvious to the problems surrounding him. Nevertheless, he is not incapable of falling into a heavy state of vulnerability. His only significant phobia is that of heights—a crippling fear, and one that renders him incapable of even bouncing. He can also be rather insecure at times, with the confidence in his various assets simultaneously acting as his greatest weakness; when he's unable to perform his usual antics with a usual (if not greater) amount of ease, he instantly becomes emotional and openly self-loathing.

For all of his shortcomings, Tigger is very much the heart of the Hundred Acre Woods' social circle. While exuberant and boisterous, he gives levity to the fearfulness of [[Piglet]], or the gloominess of [[Eeyore]], by providing a sense of confidence, joy, and optimism.

==Film appearances==
===''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''===
[[File:TMAOWTP Tigger.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tigger in ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh''.]]
Tigger is first seen on the segment ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''. Late at night, Tigger introduces himself to Pooh, after having bounced into Pooh's house and onto Pooh. Tigger later attempts to eat Pooh's honey but dislikes it. Tigger then tells Pooh about how only Heffalumps and Woozles steal and eat honey. Tigger leaves as fast as he came. Tigger is seen the next day, coming to Christopher Robin's house with Rabbit, Kanga, and Roo to find safety from the flood. Afterward, he is shown celebrating at Pooh's first hero party and then again, singing along to "[[Hip-Hip-Poohray]]".

In the segment ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', Rabbit is seen becoming frustrated with Tigger's constant bouncing, especially when he ruins his garden. Rabbit makes a plan to lead Tigger into the deepest part of the woods and loses him there. This plan is foiled when Rabbit, along with Pooh and Piglet become lost in the mist themselves. Pooh and Piglet eventually find their own way home and run into Tigger, who reveals that "Tiggers never get lost" before he rescues Rabbit, who is still lost in the mist.

During wintertime, Tigger comes to take his best friend Roo out to play. Tigger inadvertently reveals that he is afraid of heights when he and Roo bounce up a tree, and Tigger becomes too scared to come down. Rabbit, Christopher Robin, Pooh, Piglet, and Kanga all come to Tigger's rescue. While Roo is able to jump down to safety, Tigger remains stuck. Going so far as to promise not to bounce again, the Narrator finally helps Tigger to come down. Rabbit initially intends to hold Tigger to his word but relents when he sees how sad Tigger and everyone else is. Tigger then sings [[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers|his song]] as he teaches everyone how to bounce.

===''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]''===
[[File:DFE Tigger.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tigger in ''Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore''.]]
In this short film, Tigger is portrayed in a more antagonistic light, albeit childishly so.

While Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, and Roo are playing Poohsticks, they see Eeyore floating in the river below. After a somewhat successful attempt to get him to shore, he tells them that he fell in due to being bounced from behind, to which Piglet assumes to have been caused by Tigger. Sure enough, Tigger arrives on the scene, and he claims that his bounce was actually a cough, leading to an argument between him and Eeyore, but with some outside help from the [[Mr. Narrator (character)|narrator]], the animals find out that Tigger has indeed deliberately bounced Eeyore. Tigger says it was all a joke, but nobody else feels that way. Tigger disgustedly says that they have no sense of humor, and bounces away.

Tigger arrives again during Eeyore's birthday party, which angers Rabbit, who opines that Tigger should leave because of the way he treated Eeyore before. Roo wants Tigger to stay, and Christopher Robin's solution is for everyone to go to the bridge and play Poohsticks. Eeyore, being a first-time player, wins the most games out of everybody, while Tigger does not win at all, causing him to conclude that "Tiggers don't like Poohsticks". When Kanga, Roo, Owl and Rabbit go home, Christopher Robin waves goodbye and Tigger walks sadly from the bridge, because he won none at all, then Eeyore approaches him. Eeyore's secret for winning, as he explains to Tigger afterward, is to "let [his] stick drop in a twitchy sort of way." As Tigger bounces Eeyore again, they both go home and Pooh and Piglet decide that "Tigger's all right, really."

===''[[Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin|Pooh's Grand Adventure]]''===
{{Quote|What's the matter with you?! Being a second-rate bouncer is NOT what Tiggers like best!|Tigger to his tail, trying to bounce even higher to reach [[Piglet]].}}
[[File:PGA Tigger.jpg|thumb|250px|Tigger with Pooh in ''Pooh's Grand Adventure''.]]
In the sequel to ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'', Tigger is first seen failing to rescue Piglet, who is stuck on a high tree branch, prompting Tigger to question his bouncing.

Later, it is discovered that Christopher Robin is supposedly kidnapped, leaving only a letter as a warning of his fate. Pooh and friends embark on a perilous journey to rescue Christopher, with Tigger tagging along. During the adventure, the map leading to Christopher Robin's whereabouts is torn, with one piece drifting over a log across a ravine. Tigger chases after but is unable to reach it due to his weak bouncing of late. The log then tumbles further down the ravine, frightening Tigger to a standstill. Pooh and the others encourage him to bounce to safety, but due to his insecurities, Tigger refuses, resulting in a rescue mission. By the end, the log breaks, sending everyone into the mud below.

Tigger is later given the chance to redeem himself when the group manages to find Christopher Robin within the vast inner workings of a skull cave. Unfortunately, the obstacle keeping them from reuniting with their friend is an impossible height. Tigger is able to gather the strength within his tail, and muster his courage to bounce each of his friends to the designated point, successfully leading to the "rescuing" of Christopher Robin, who revealed to have only been away at school for the day. With the misunderstanding that Owl created, cleared, the friends (including a reinvigorated Tigger) return to the Hundred Acre Wood.

===''[[The Tigger Movie]]''===
[[File:Tigger-movie-disneyscreencaps.com-2871.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tigger in ''The Tigger Movie''.]]
In this film, Tigger convinces the narrator to make himself the main character of the movie instead of Pooh. As the story goes, Tigger is sick of being the one and only Tigger in the Hundred Acre Wood and goes out to search for his 'real' family. After hearing about family trees from Owl, Tigger, who took the advice literally, tries to find a striped tree. When he finds none, he attempts to write a letter to his family. When no response comes, Tigger becomes lonely. Roo and friends try various methods to cheer him up, but they all fail. To make amends, they decide to write the response letter themselves.

Tigger, seemingly deceived by the letter, suggests it's from the family he thinks about, but when Pooh and friends dress up as costume Tiggers in an attempt to avoid disappointment, he discovers the truth. Nevertheless, Tigger refuses to give up hope for himself and sets off in a potentially deadly blizzard to find his 'true family', having felt betrayed by his friends. Pooh, Roo, Rabbit, Piglet, and Eeyore set out to find Tigger. They do so, but are nearly killed by an avalanche caused by Tigger's loud, frustrated, and offended shouting after Rabbit insults Tigger's goal. Tigger saves everyone by bouncing them into a branch of the tallest tree in the Hundred Acre Woods, but gets hit by the avalanche. Roo reaches him and they both manage to escape with a powerful bounce.

Tigger is still saddened about his family. At the end of the film, however, Christopher Robin explains to Tigger that Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Eeyore, Owl, Roo, and Kanga are his family. Tigger finally agrees to this and takes a family picture to place in an amulet now belonging to Roo, his honorary little brother.

===''[[Piglet's Big Movie]]''===
[[File:pigletsbigmovie 164.jpg|thumb|250px|Tigger in ''Piglet's Big Movie''.]]
At the start of the film, Tigger takes part in Pooh and Rabbit's plan to extract honey from the beehive. Tigger's job is to help Pooh act like a tree and hold a decoy hive to trap the bees. The plan goes downhill but their friend Piglet imprisons the bees saving everyone. Like everyone, Tigger fails to notice. When Piglet goes missing, Tigger and pals can't find him, Tigger joins in the big search.

In order to find him, the friends use Piglet's scrapbook filled with memories of the past (including one scene of him tearfully being reminded of the "family reunion" from ''The Tigger Movie''). When Tigger and Rabbit get into an altercation they end up ripping the book. They repair enough to continue searching for Piglet. Tigger assists Rabbit, Roo, and Eeyore as they try to rescue Pooh from a deep drop down from a waterfall. They do but only with the help of Piglet. Tigger finally has a chance to thank his friend for all he's done and attends the party in celebration of Piglet.

===''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]''===
[[File:heffalumpmovie 320.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tigger in ''Pooh's Heffalump Movie''.]]
Tigger is fast asleep in his treehouse but is soon awakened by a loud noise. Tigger rushes to Rabbit and learns a Heffalump is in the woods. Tigger prepares himself to catch the beast and joins his friends on an expedition into the home of the Heffalumps, Heffalump Hallow. Tigger and Rabbit are separated by Pooh and Piglet and become trapped in one of their traps. After freeing themselves they hear the noise yet again. Tigger and his friends rush back home only to learn a Heffalump was in their home.

Oblivious to Tigger and his friends, a baby Heffalump has become friends with Roo and they are looking for Pooh and his friends to properly meet. After spotting Roo and the Heffalump, Tigger is angered, believing the Heffalump is trying to kill Roo. Along with Rabbit, Tigger attacks the young Heffalump (named [[Lumpy]]) and makes an attempt to trap him. He manages to escape, but after Roo lands in trouble, Lumpy's mother arrives and saves the young kangaroo. Realizing Heffalumps aren't savage beasts, things are set straight and the inhabitants of both the Hundred Acre Woods and Heffalumps Hallow become friends. Tigger, especially, warmed up to the newfound unity after he learned Heffalumps love to bounce.

Tigger also appears in the sequel ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie]]'', where he tells his friends about the Spookable, a creature that comes out every Halloween.

===''[[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]]''===
[[File:Tigger is telling the narrator he's the only one.jpg|thumb|250px|Tigger in ''Winnie the Pooh''.]]
Tigger is first seen when Pooh has a very important thing to do. Tigger spotted a balloon with Pooh and pounced it, thinking it was attacking Pooh. Later on, Pooh finds a mysterious letter indicating (or at least according to Owl) that Christopher Robin has been captured by a ferocious beast known as [[the Backson]]. Like the others, Tigger fears the creature and joins the adventure to defeat the monster and rescue Christopher.

While the gang sets traps and bait, Tigger separated himself, believing only Tiggers can catch Backsons. Tigger attacks Eeyore, mistaking him for a Backson. Eeyore was left behind by the others because he couldn't keep up. Feeling bad for his friend, Tigger offers Eeyore a spot in his expedition making Eeyore "Tigger Two." Tigger dresses as the Backson to train Eeyore for battle. Eeyore escapes the scene, however, not wanting to join Tigger. Meanwhile, Pooh and the others accidentally trap themselves in a pit trap meant for the Backson and send Piglet to Christopher Robin's house to find the rope.

Piglet begins his search in the forest and runs into Tigger, still in his Backson costume. Piglet rushes away in fear, falling into the pit with Tigger falling behind. Fortunately, Pooh creates a latter using the textbook letters that fell into the pit whilst Piglet was running away from Tigger in his Backson costume. The friends are freed and reunited with Christopher Robin who was merely off on a day at school. In the end, Pooh finds Eeyore's lost tail and receives a large honey pot reward for its recovery. Tigger was animated by [[Andreas Deja]] and voiced again by Jim Cummings.

===''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]''===
[[File:Christopher Robin 69.png|thumb|left|250px|Tigger in ''Christopher Robin''.]]
Tigger returns in the live-action film, taking place during Christopher Robin's adulthood. Though much older and worn by the time of the movie, Tigger is every bit as energetic and enthusiastic as he was when Christopher was a kid. When Pooh fears that an adult Christopher Robin has lost his way, Tigger joins him, Piglet and Eeyore in traveling to London to save their friend. Tigger easily becomes best friends with Madeline Robin, Christopher's daughter, as he teaches her how to bounce. Jim Cummings returns to voice Tigger in the film, and his design stays faithful to Milt Kahl's distinct interpretation (the most notable differences being his eyes, which are now green instead of black, his stripes, which are now orange instead of black, and his eyebrows, which are now white instead of black, which does share similar colors to that of the real Tigger doll owned by Christopher Robin Milne).

===Other films===
In ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo]]'', Tigger attempts to help Rabbit get into the spirit of Easter, also acted as [[the Ghost of Christmas Past]] from ''The Christmas Carol''.

==Television==
===''[[Welcome to Pooh Corner]]''===
In contrast to Tigger's other appearances, ''[[Welcome to Pooh Corner]]'' featured a life-size Tigger puppet operated by a person. He lives with Kanga and, like another series is close friends with Roo. He is also depicted as having a talent for art.

===''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''===
[[File:Guwwtpv5-03.jpg|thumb|250px|A stripeless Tigger in the episode "Stripes".]]
Tigger features as the main character in the animated series, ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. In this series, Tigger is shown to live in his own home, a treehouse. He has many episodes that revolve around him. Several episodes show that he has two alter egos: '''The Masked Offender''' (a mispronunciation of "The Masked Defender)", and '''Tigger, Private Ear''', who was based on a detective story Tigger had heard.

In the episode "[[King of the Beasties]]", Christopher Robin is showing everyone their different relations (i.e. the animals they are based on). When Christopher Robin reveals that he is uncertain what Tigger is related to, Tigger assumes that he is related to a lion, and thus is the King of Beasts. "[[All's Well That Ends Wishing Well]]" reveals that Tigger has never had a birthday party. The friends decide to give him one, but Tigger becomes disappointed when his birthday wishes don't come true. Tigger and friends are later transported to a world where Tigger's birthday wishes can all come true. However, when he starts making non-stop wishes, his own greediness nearly got himself and his friends trapped in the wishing well forever. In the end, Tigger learns that his close friends are far more important than having all of his wishes come true.

A different side of Tigger is shown in "[[Stripes]]". Tigger becomes unsure of his identity when his stripes are washed off after a bath, as Tiggers are recognized by them. During the episode, Tigger tries being a rabbit, a bear, and a Christmas tree, but in the end, Eeyore tells Tigger that he is always the same person on the inside.  In the episode "Tigger is the Mother of Invention", he invented a bulldozer-like contraption intended to provide convenience for Pooh, Piglet, and Rabbit, but the invention proved to have disastrous results, and Rabbit insisted that Tigger shut it down; however, in the winter, a depressed Tigger accidentally started the machine up, and it proved to be useful by plowing snow around Piglet's house before malfunctioning. On another occasion, Tigger attempted to mimic a superhero, "The Masked Offender", bringing mayhem to the Hundred-Acre Wood. In response, Pooh, Rabbit, Gopher, and Owl (unaware that the Masked Offender was actually Tigger) staged a hoax in which they made an inanimate monster from a sticky glue-like material. The plan worked, revealing Tigger as the Masked Offender, but the fake monster (which was on wheels) turned on its makers, ultimately resulting in Pooh, Rabbit, Gopher, and Owl hanging by the glue from a rickety bridge. Subsequently, Tigger resumed his role as the Masked Offender, and saved his friends.

===''[[The Book of Pooh]]''===
[[File:TiggerBookofPooh.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tigger in ''The Book of Pooh''.]]
Tigger was one of the main characters of the live-action series as an articulated puppet. Unlike other media, Tigger bounces on his feet instead of his tail (with the exception of "[[A Wood Divided]]"). 

Following the adventures of Pooh and friends within the Hundred Acre Woods, Tigger served as the focus for several episodes, including "[[I Could Have Laughed All Night]]", where Tigger believes [[Kessie]] finds his laugh ridiculous, thus resulting in him vowing to never laugh again; "[[Could it Be Magic?]]", where Tigger decides to take up magic; and "[[The Autobiography of Tigger]]", and many others.

Notably, in "[[Tigger's Replacement]]", Tigger goes on a journey to get in contact with his wild self, leaving Piglet behind as a temporary replacement. However, after overhearing Rabbit commenting on Piglet being an improvement on the old Tigger, the latter decides to leave permanently.

In "[[Night of the Waking Tigger]]", Tigger believes he's spending too much time asleep and decides to spend his nights wide-awake from that point forward, which causes his friends to try to get him back to sleep.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:63 The Ludwig Von Drake Song.PNG|thumb|250px|Tigger in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Tigger regularly made cameo appearances in the animated series, ''House of Mouse'', often sitting alongside Pooh and the other characters from the franchise. During the [[Rockin' at the House of Mouse|opening]], he can be seen bouncing throughout the crowd. He's also present whenever the running gag of the audience fleeing the club is utilized.

In "[[The Mouse Who Came to Dinner]]", Tigger was mentioned by [[Mortimer Mouse]] when the latter referred to [[Shere Khan]] as "Tigger's Evil Twin".

In [[Goofy's Menu Magic]], he was seen yelling "NO!" at [[Goofy]] when he asked if anyone wanted more stew, along with [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]].

In "[[Ask Von Drake]]", Tigger was present during the [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|headcount of all the Disney character guests]].

In "[[Turkey Day]]", he was seen sitting alongside Eeyore and Piglet as the two commentating on the numerous events occurring before them after finishing their evening meals.

In "[[House of Genius]]", he is seen mid-bounce waiting for [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] to wait for his table along with the other guests, much to his and the other guest's annoyance, although he was seated earlier in that episode (via archive footage).

Tigger also made appearances in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''; most notably during Eeyore's stage speech and the [[The Best Christmas of All|finale song]].

===''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]''===
Tigger was one of the central characters for the animated series and was brought into the third dimension. Here, Tigger was part of a small mystery organization consisting of himself, Pooh Bear, a young girl named [[Darby]], and her puppy [[Buster (My Friends Tigger & Pooh)|Buster]]. Together, the team (known as the Super Sleuths), traveled throughout the Hundred Acre Woods to solve mysteries and problems revolving around both themselves and their friends. Tigger's uniform consisted of a blue sweater with the group logo and a set of yellow safety goggles. He usually rides with Pooh on the scooters (snowboards in the winter) as the main driver.

===''[[Doc McStuffins]]''===
[[File:Into the Hundred Acre Wood! 12.jpg|thumb|250px|Tigger meets Stuffy in ''Doc McStuffins''.]]
Tigger made a guest appearance in the episode "[[Into the Hundred Acre Wood!]]". While looking for Pooh with [[Piglet]] and [[Eeyore]], he mistakes [[Stuffy]] for Pooh and bounces him.

===Other shows===
In ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'', Tigger made recurring appearances in the live-action wrap-around skits alongside the other costumed characters and celebrity guests.

In the ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' episode "[[As the Netherworld Turns]]", Genie is playing Charades with Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Sultan. When it's the Sultan's turn, he pretends to be a monkey, which Genie guesses correctly. Pleased, he turns into Tigger, claiming "Guessing is what Genies do the best!"

Tigger appears in ''[[The Wonderful Spring of Mickey Mouse]]''. bouncing through some flowers as the narration transitions to the third story.

==Video games==
===''[[Tigger's Family Tree 3D Adventure]]''===
Tigger is the main character in this game, where he searches for his family (similar to the plot of ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'' which the game is based on) through seven main challenges, stopping along the way to help other Disney's Winnie the Pooh friends in a variety of mini-games.

===''[[Tigger's Honey Hunt]]''===
Tigger is the main character in this game, where he went on a long journey through the entire Hundred Acre Woods to collect honey for a special party in honor of Pooh. Throughout the search, Tigger visited some of the well-known and unknown parts of the woods including a cave full of diamonds and jewels as well as Heffalumps.

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Tigger - KH3.png|left|250px]]
Tigger is a recurring character in the series that resides in the Hundred Acre Wood world.

Tigger makes his first chronological appearance in ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' as a [[Command Board]] character, alongside Pooh.

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', he appears in several minigames. He is often seen bouncing on tree stumps with Roo and even has his own "bouncing corner". He also ruined Rabbit's farm, bouncing on his carrots and lettuces.

He reappears in ''Chain of Memories'' as a recreation of Sora's memories in [[Castle Oblivion]].

Then in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is part of several more minigames. One involves him and Roo and takes place in Kanga's house. He is also an ally that helps Sora through the "Spooky Cave" mini-game.

===''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''===
Tigger appears in the game as an unlockable meet-and-greet character near the Splash Mountain exit in [[Critter Country]]. He also plays a major role in the ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (attraction)|Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' mini-game. When Pooh gets trapped in one of Piglet's Woozle traps, Tigger feels that a Woozle is still out and about, and plans on scaring the Woozles away with the help of the player.

===''[[Disney Infinity]]''===
Tigger appears as a walk around, non-playable character in the form of one of the townspeople.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Tigger Disney parks .jpg|thumb|250px|Tigger posing for a photo at one of the Disney parks.]]
In the Disney theme parks around the world, Tigger is a very common character who usually appears with Pooh or Eeyore, and occasionally Piglet and Rabbit.

Tigger appears in [[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (attraction)|The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]] as an audio-animatronic. Tigger is first seen after the ''Blustery Day'' and ''Honey Tree'' sections and bounces with the riders and eventually introduces the Heffalumps and Woozles scene. In the [[Walt Disney World]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] versions of the attraction, Tigger's voice work is done by the late Paul Winchell while in [[Disneyland]], it's done by Jim Cummings.

Tigger's voice can be heard during [[Once Upon a Time (fireworks show)|Once Upon a Time]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]], where he introduces the Heffalumps and Woozles.

==Trivia==
*Tigger has his own theme song, "[[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers]]", written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]].
*In ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', [[Pleakley]] is wearing a Tigger slipper.
*[[Walt Disney]] originally intended for Tigger to be voiced by [[Wally Boag]], though after Walt's death in [[1966]], the part ended up going to [[Paul Winchell]].
**Other actors who were considered for the role were [[Paul Frees]], [[Don Messick]], and [[Daws Butler]].
*In animation and merchandise, Tigger's nose is pink and sometimes brown. In his walkaround costume, his nose is black, though the Disney Live! version (also currently seen in Disney on Ice) is pink also, and in puppetry, it's red. 
*Tigger's departing comment of "T.T.F.N." or "Ta-ta for now" has become widely used as Internet shorthand for users departing from chat rooms and other live discussions.
*In the pre-[[1997]] Disney presentations, Tigger was originally voiced by [[Paul Winchell]], who died [[June 24]], [[2005]]; [[John Fiedler]], the voice of [[Piglet]] in most of those films, died the next day.
*Tigger's "birthday" is believed to be in October 1928, the year that ''The House at Pooh Corner'' was first published. On Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as [[1968]], a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production.
*Tigger also makes an appearance in the anti-drug movie ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' with many other 1980's animated stars.
*It is ironic that Tigger appeared in two Disney on Ice shows, ''Great Ice Odyssey'' and ''Snow White'' as well as skating in "Round My Family Tree" as he didn't like ice-skating at those times. Recently, he appears in the Disney on Ice show, Mickey's Search Party, but he, along with Pooh and Peter Pan do not skate anymore.
*The ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]'' episode "[[How the Tigger Lost His Stripe]]", reveals he named the stripes on his tail, in order:
**"Springy" (second stripe)
**"Whirly" (sixth stripe)
**"Swirly" (fourth stripe)
**"Curly" (top stripe)
**"Bouncy" (bottom stripe)
**"Flouncy" (fifth stripe)
**"Leapy" (seventh stripe)
**"Oomphy" (third stripe)
*Tigger's current voice actor, [[Jim Cummings]], also provides the voice of Pooh himself.
*In "[[A Pooh Day Afternoon]]", it's revealed he can do an impression of a horn honk and a bottle of pop.
*Tigger is one of the few Disney characters to commit malapropisms, the other three being [[Toon Patrol#Smartass|Smarty]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'', and [[Harry (Stanley)|Harry]] from ''[[Stanley (TV series)|Stanley]]''.
*[[Paul Winchell]] created Tigger's voice by using his ventriloquist dummy, Knucklehead Smiff, as he stated in recent interviews he did in [[2004]].
*It isn't known how old Tigger is, but he is physically grown up. Interestingly, in Milne's original books, he is possibly a child.
*Usually, the Tigger is depicted as larger than Pooh, but in ''The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'', he is almost the same size as him.
*Tigger also appeared in ''[[Mickey's Nutcracker]]'' as one of the guests.
