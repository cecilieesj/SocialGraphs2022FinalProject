'''[[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s kettle''' is a character that appeared in the first episode of ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'', "[[Dope-a Cabana]]". It was the arsonist responsible for the fire in Donald's house.

==Background==
The kettle turned on by itself shortly before Donald's attempt to kill it with a fireman's axe. The reflection on Donald's kettle shares its birthday with Donald's, on June 9, as it is made clear by them wishing each other a happy birthday.

==Role in the series==
During Donald's birthday, Donald talks to his own kettle where a reflection on the kettle says to him, "Right back at ya! Wink!", just as Donald prepares for a delicious birthday breakfast, only for his breakfast to be interrupted by [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] who is telling him to be at the train station at time, followed by Mr. Macklemore who yells at him that he is late for work at his barbershop to which Donald decides to go to Mr. Macklemore's barbershop, not noticing the kettle turning on by itself.

Later after Donald is fired from Mr. Macklemore's barbershop, he sees a group of firefighters destroying the house to which one of them tells the others that the kettle has been left on the whole time (actually caused by itself) to which Donald grabs a fireman's axe and attempts to hit the kettle with the axe, which only chops the stove (also dislodging the kettle). Later after his house was destroyed, Donald calls for a taxi to take him to the New Quackmore Institute where he goes to a new home which is Clinton Coot's cabana.

==Trivia==
*The tone Matt Danner uses when voicing the reflection on Donald's kettle is very similar to the tone he uses when voicing [[Kermit|Baby Kermit]] in the [[Muppet Babies (series)|''Muppet Babies'' reboot]].
