|status = Active}}The '''Scullery Maid''' is a minor character of the [[1963]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film, ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.

==Role in the film==
The Scullery Maid is first seen when she sees the dishes fly through the air and panics. She warns [[Sir Ector]] and [[Kay]] who were busy training for the tournament. While Ector and Kay tried unsuccessfully to fight off the enchanted dishes, she was of no help at all. When [[Arthur Pendragon|Wart]] and [[Merlin]] arrive in the bewitched kitchen, Ector confronts Merlin and the Scullery maid threatens Merlin, who disappears. She is still amazed to see him disappear. But when Wart defiantly defends Merlin, Ector piles more demerits on the boy and punishes him by replacing him with his groom boy Hobbs for Kay's squire and forbidding Wart from going to [[London]].

At Christmas, she announces with more panic that Hobbs came down with the mumps and Ector decided to replace him with Wart. Afterward, she's not seen again for the rest of the film as a result of her looking after Hobbs.

==Trivia==
*Aside from [[Madam Mim]], the Scullery Maid, the [[Girl Squirrel]], and the [[Granny Squirrel]] are the only female characters in the film.
*[[Barbara Jo Allen]], who voiced the Scullery Maid, had previously voiced [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Fauna]] the green fairy in ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and [[Goliath II's mother]] in [[Goliath II]].
