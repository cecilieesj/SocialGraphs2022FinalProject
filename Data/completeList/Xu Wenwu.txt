==Trivia==
*In the novelization of ''Iron Man'', Raza claims he is wearing one of the Mandarin's rings. This may suggest a mark of leadership to all of the lieutenants in the [[Ten Rings]] hierarchy.
*The Ten Rings terrorist group in the original ''Iron Man'' is a reference to the magic rings the Mandarin possesses in the comics.
*In the comics, Shang-Chi's father was Fu Manchu. This was changed due to the racist connotations of the character, as well as legal red tape preventing Fu Manchu from being used.
*In the comics the Ten Rings were worn on each of the Mandarin's fingers and each possessed their own special power. This was changed in the Shang-Chi film by producer Jonathan Schwartz to avoid any comparison or similarity to the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] as the [[Infinity Stones]] play a similar role. Instead they are worn on his wrists based on the Hung Gar's Iron Rings as a reference to Chinese culture in order to re-enforce the image of the film as a martial arts film.<ref>[https://thedirect.com/article/shang-chi-avengers-infinity-stones-mcu-ten-rings-design-exclusive Shang-Chi Producer Confirms Avengers' Infinity Stones Influenced MCU's Ten Rings Design (Exclusive)]</ref>
*It's unknown if Wenwu was "blipped".
