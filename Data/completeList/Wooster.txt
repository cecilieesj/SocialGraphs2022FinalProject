{{Quote|Honey!|Wooster's catchphrase}}
'''Wooster''' is a gigantic [[Woozles|woozle]] who appears in ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' episode "[[The Great Honey Pot Robbery]]".

==Role in the series==
When [[Stan Woozle and Heff Heffalump]] are foiled in their attempt to make off with [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]]'s honey, they say that they'd be back with friends. Much to Heff's strong, frightened reluctance, Stan decides to go to Wooster for help and tells him that they have found honey to steal. When their gigantic friend hears this, Wooster lets them lead him to Pooh. Meanwhile, Rabbit has informed Winnie the Pooh about the upcoming attempt on his honey supply, and Pooh proposes a more amicable solution; share his honey. Rabbit scoffs at this, warning Pooh that the bad guys will simply take the honey by force. [[Tigger]] and [[Roo]] decide to try and stop the honey thieves while Rabbit puts together a sign that simply says: "Honey, thiz way" as a way to convince them to go in the opposite direction of Pooh's house, which would make them lose their way, and presumably make them never return. Unfortunately for Rabbit, Wooster simply destroys the billboard as he is illiterate.

When Rabbit, Tigger, Roo, and [[Piglet]] try to warn him of the villains' arrival, Pooh lets them come. Stan, Heff, and Wooster soon confront the silly old bear at his "brunchfast" where they try to intimidate him and his friends. Instead of giving in, Pooh decides to convince Wooster that simply asking for honey instead of stealing is a much better solution to getting what you want. Stan and Heff try to say otherwise, but Pooh tells him about friendship and how it's better to share and ask with friends and even shows that he wants to be his friend too. Wooster is shocked at this revelation and expresses interest in the concept of friendship, proving he was not truly malicious but did not know any better just as Pooh had previously suspected. Wooster is soon convinced and turns over to Pooh's side, stops Heff and Stan from stealing honey from Pooh, asks for honey politely (he actually says "please" which appalls Stan), and ultimately becomes friends with the Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger, and Roo. Heff and Stan are enraged by Wooster's change in attitude, but the giant Woozle decides that if they cannot be friendly with the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood and stop trying to steal from them, they are no friends of his. Wooster picks them up and places them far away. The villainous duo vows one day to return and steal honey, never trying to obtain any by honest means. Although Piglet is worried about the possibility of their return Pooh is not worried as they now have a trusted ally and friend in Wooster to protect them. Wooster then gives Pooh honey which he is thankful for, and Wooster happily replies "Hey, what friends for?"

==Trivia==
*Despite the fact that this episode ends with Wooster becoming a good friend, "[[The Great Honey Pot Robbery]]" is the only episode to feature him. It could be assumed that although Wooster is now friendly with everyone, he moved out of the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] at some point to find his own supply of honey.
*Wooster is the largest stuffed animal in the entire series.
*So far, Wooster is the only Woozle in the franchise to have befriended Pooh and friends.
