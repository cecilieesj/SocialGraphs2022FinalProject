Orpheus is first mentioned in "[[Hercules and the Tapestry of Fate]]", where [[Hercules]] and [[Icarus]] try to get tickets to his concert, only for it to turn out in the end it is cancelled due to a sore throat. He is mentioned in episodes like "[[Hercules and the Aetolian Amphora]]", where Ares' sons want to use Lethe water to erase their dad's memories to go to his concert. He appears on screen in "[[Hercules and the Prom]]", where he reveals to Hercules he is tired of not talking and using his voice for money, and later begins traveling, singing concerts for free.
