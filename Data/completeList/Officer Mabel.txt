'''Officer Mabel''' (or simply '''The Old Goat''') is a character who was deleted from the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''. She was originally going to appear in the film, but was cut from the final version of the film for unknown reasons.

==Background==
===Development===
According to the bonus feature "Deleted Characters" featured in the Blu-ray and Digital releases of ''Zootopia'', Mabel had various jobs and different appearances was developing the character where she was described as a "screaming old goat" and would faint at times where she appears (which would have been a running gag in the final version of the film). However, her design was used where she was seen as a meter maid<ref>Bonus Feature "Deleted Characters" (''Zootopia'' Blu-ray/Digital formats, 2016).</ref>. Mabel was ultimately cut in the final version of the film for unknown reasons.

A deleted scene focused on Mabel talking to [[Judy Hopps]] who was a newly-recruited meter maid in fifty years which Judy suddenly becomes discouraged about becoming a senior meter maid for fifty years. This scene did not appear in the final cut.

==Appearances==

===''[[Zootopia]]''===
While not in the final version of the film, there was a deleted scene with recorded dialogue where Mabel (simply referred to as "The Old Goat" by the official ''Zootopia'' production team) talks to [[Judy Hopps]] who was a newly-recruited meter maid in fifty years which Judy suddenly becomes discouraged about becoming a senior meter maid for fifty years. The scene was cut from the final version of the film for unknown reasons.

===''[[Zootopia+]]''===
Despite being cut from the original ''Zootopia'' movie, the Old Goat's model was repurposed for an elderly goat character in the episode "[[Duke the Musical]]", albeit without wearing her meter maid outfit. [[Duke Weaselton]] passes by her and swipes her wallet, not noticing Duke behind her. She then appears again during a fantasy sequence wearing a graduation gown attempting to give a diploma to a polar bear which Duke writes his name on it. However, when Duke finds himself back in [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]], the Old Goat quietly walks past the street very slowly and when Duke holds out her wallet, she faces Duke, thinking that she would be happy with him for doing a good deed which would make him a better weasel. However, a truck runs into the Old Goat which she tells Duke that she is fine albeit with a scratch. Duke then takes a money bag only to be chased by a police car once again.

It should be noted that this marks the first time the Old Goat has appeared in any official animated appearance, despite being deleted from the original ''Zootopia'' film itself.

==Printed material==
===''The Official Zootopia Handbook''===
Mabel (whose name has been used in the book) also appears in the ''Zootopia''-inspired book published on [[January 19]], [[2016]], prior to the film itself being released on March 2016. where she passes by [[Mr. Otterton|Emmitt Otterton]]'s flower shop, giving a compliment on Emmitt's flower arrangement being delicious which came in an edible vase as well.

==Trivia==
*The name "Mabel" was used in the ''Zootopia''-inspired book, ''The Official Zootopia Handbook''. The character was simply labeled as "The Old Goat" in the "Deleted Characters" featurette in the Blu-ray and Digital releases of ''Zootopia''.
