}}The '''Indian Chief''' (named '''Great Big Little Panther''' in the original novel) is [[Tiger Lily]]'s father and the leader of the [[Neverland Indian Tribe]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1953]] film, ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
One look at the Chief and one is bound to be intimidated. This can be because he is in a bad mood, or if Tiger Lily is in danger, but deep down he is extremely kind and rather sweet. He often looks stern and has never been seen smiling (aside from a brief moment in which he delivered an oration in sign language). He's also very protective of his tribe and even more protective of his daughter.

==Role in the film==
In the film, when [[John Darling|John]], [[Michael Darling|Michael]], and the [[Lost Boys]] are out hunting Indians, they are captured by them instead, taken to  [[Indian Camp|their camp]] and, brought to the attention of the Chief, who thinks they've kidnapped his daughter, Tiger Lily (who was actually kidnapped by [[Captain Hook]]), and he orders that they will be burned at the stake if she doesn't return home by sunset. Luckily, [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] rescues her and the Chief sets the Lost Boys free, makes them Honorary Indians, and Peter Chief Little Flying Eagle. He also explained through the song "[[What Made the Red Man Red?]]": how the Red Man becomes red by falling in love with a maiden, to which Peter falls in love with Tiger Lily causing [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]] to become jealous and upset. He is not seen again for the rest of the film.

==Trivia==

* In the Italian dub of the movie the character was renamed ''Capo Toro-In-Piedi'' (chief Standing Bull), a reference to the famous Siuox chief Sitting Bull (''Toro Seduto'' in Italian).
