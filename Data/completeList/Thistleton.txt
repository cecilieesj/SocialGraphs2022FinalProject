==Background==

===Official Bio===
From a young age, Mr. Thistleton's genius was evident to all, especially his beloved mother. He was the youngest student in the history of the Mistletoe Institute of Technology, graduating with high honors and leading the Math-lete Team to consecutive championships.

Marked for greatness, Mr. Thistleon dazzled colleagues with his first great innovation: an amazing network of interconnected computers he dubbed "the Winternet". Chagrined that the technology community in the human world dropped the "w" from the name of his beloved invention, Thistelton turned his attention to new designs. His 887 different patents granted by the Big Guy himself include the Sledway personal transport, the Giftbox data pad, and the B.U.L.B. Ornament Transit System. Thistleton's greatest invention, however, is the Database Tree Farm. This sprawling underground computer complex houses all Nice and Naughty List data for every child on Earth, constantly processing and updating behavior throughout the year.

'''Likes''': 
Mr. Thistleton is pleased when the exterior temperature is exactly 28.6 degrees with 24.9 percent humidity, which results in an optimum pristine snowfall at the North Pole.

'''Dislikes''': 
Mr. Thistleton has a wide array of turtleneck sweaters. He has a rigid filing system for them, and becomes irate when his mother does not fold them correctly in crisp thirds as instructed.

'''Random Facts''': 
Mr. Thistleton and his mother often spend weekends updating their snowflake collection.

'''Favorite Christmas Treat''': 
Peppermint Pizza with gluten-free crust

==Appearances==
===''[[Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice]]''===
Thistleton is first seen talking to [[Magee]] via telephone, telling her that the Naughty and Nice servers have a protective firewall in their systems, getting a record data from nice children around the world for this year. When the systems detect a naughty girl named "[[Grace Goodwin]]", Thistleton starts to feel that someone has been naughty this year. Later when Lanny and Wayne are talking to Magee, Wayne appears via hologram telling the two that a device known as the Fruitcake Conduct Calculator was placed into Grace's room, who is been marked naughty, tasking the elves find the device and stop Grace from accessing the NPCECCC to be on the Nice List in order save Christmas.

When Grace uses a password to access the North Pole's Naughty and Nice systems, Thistleton notices the danger that Grace did as every nice children is being put on the Naughty List thanks to Grace's suspicious plans just as Noel finds the Fruitcake. Fortunately, Grace, Lanny, Wayne, and Noel manage to head towards the antenna to reverse Grace's suspicious plan just as Wayne and Noel place the Fruitcake Conduct Calculator on the large antenna so that it can return in contact with the North Pole just as Thistleton happily notices Wayne and Noel's successful plan being done. He later attends the ceremony where Wayne and Noel are awarded for being this year's Elf of the Year.
