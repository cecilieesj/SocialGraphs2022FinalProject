'''King Arthur Pendragon''' is one of Britain's most famous kings. This version of him is featured in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated series, ''[[Gargoyles]]''.

==Background==

===Development===
King Arthur was introduced into ''Gargoyles'' as part of an ambitious, but ultimately unrealized plan to establish a series of spinoffs to ''Gargoyles'' that would build the franchise into Disney's own superhero universe. Arthur's planned spin-off ''Pendragon'', would focus on Arthur and Griff's adventures around the world searching for Merlin and questing for the Holy Grail. According to [[Greg Weisman]], this would eventually culminate in Arthur being recognized as the true King Arthur by various world governments and establishing a technologically advanced New Camelot in Antarctica with the help of various allies he made along the way.

===History===
Arthur became the High King of Britain on [[September 29]], 500 after pulling out [[Excalibur]]. He was mortally wounded in 542 and sent to a magic hill on [[Avalon]], where he slept for 1,453 years, when he was awakened by [[Elisa Maza]].

On Avalon, he helped battle the [[Archmage]], and decided to explore the modern world on his own. He eventually wound up in England, where he broke into Westminster Abbey, thereby attracting the attention of the gargoyle, [[Griff]]. With the help of Griff and the [[Manhattan Clan]], King Arthur reclaimed [[Excalibur]], despite [[Macbeth|Macbeth's]] attempt to claim the sword for himself. He then made the decision to go and search for Merlin, as well as find a way to return Griff to [[London]], [[England]]. However, Griff wished to accompany him, so King Arthur knighted him.

When Arthur heard that England was returning the [[Stone of Destiny]] to [[Scotland]], he and Griff returned to London to protect the stone on its journey.
