==Background==
===Personality===
{{Quote|Hakuna Matata!|Bartholomew}}
Though Bartholomew's personality is not explored, he is shown to be at odds with his fearsome exterior. Despite being a ferocious predator, he is quick to feel alone and lost without the company of other creatures and craves attention and friendship.

===Physical appearance===
{{Quote|Why, having a forty-foot-tall monster around wouldn't be such a bad idea.|Timon about Bartholomew}}
Tall and gargantuan, Bartholomew is one of the largest creatures to walk the universe. Not only is he enormous, but he sports many features taken directly from other animals, such as the twin bull horns atop his head. Bartholomew's main body appears to be scaly in texture and is bright purple in color, broken only by patches of green on his chest and pale pink on his toes. His neck and head are furry and colored a very dark brown, while his muzzle is especially large and tan in color. A red crest runs down the back of his neck.

In terms of strength, Bartholomew sports many natural weapons. For one, he has pointed blue claws as well as two giant fangs that jut out from under his upper lip. Perhaps his most useful weapons are the horns atop his head, reminiscent of a bull's. Even [[Simba]], one of the fiercest animals in the [[jungle]], proves inadequate against Bartholomew's brawn.

====Backstory====
{{Quote|You see, ever since he escaped from Dr. Happy's lab, he's been lost and lonely and all alone, and I figured he'd make a nice addition to our Hakuna Matata club.|Simba about Bartholomew}}
Bartholomew is a monster who lived in the jungle during [[Scar]]'s reign. He was created as a lab experiment by Dr. Happy, but he escaped into the jungle, where he met Simba and his friends, Timon and Pumbaa.

{{Quote|And with this weird wild animal on the loose, we can't be too careful.|Timon to Simba about Bartholomew}}
In a vicious display of carnage and monstrosity, Bartholomew breaks his way out of Dr. Happy's lab, prompting the mad scientist's loyal pooch to report to his master about the monster's successful escape attempt. Despite the damage done to his facility, Dr. Happy shows little concern for the doings of Bartholomew, though the newspapers immediately pick up on the gravity of the situation and start to spread news about the disaster.

Upon seeing news reports about Bartholomew, Timon and Pumbaa start a training program with their friend Simba in which he protects them from predators while they hide in nearby foliage. Simba, however, pays little attention to their constant drills, confident in his abilities to take on dangerous predators.

Wanting to instil confidence in their lion friend, Timon and Pumbaa plot to have Simba think he has saved them from the escaped beast. The plan backfires, however, when Timon encounters Bartholomew while prepping the event and mistakes him for Pumbaa. When Pumbaa shows up, the meerkat realizes his mistake, and the two friends take off, screaming, into the jungle. They run immediately to Simba and force him into combat against the beast, but Simba quickly learns that Bartholomew is a friend.

In the face of his friends' shock, Simba explains that ever since escaping Dr. Happy's lab, Bartholomew has been lonely and lost. He suggests that they let Bartholomew into their gang. Realizing Bartholomew's potential as a bodyguard, Timon reluctantly agrees to the idea, and Bartholomew admits that he's been giving their motto a lot of thought. Once officially a member of their club, Bartholomew attempts to follow them across a log, but the trunk breaks beneath his weight, and all four friends slide backward into a ravine.
