==Background==
===King Habib===
King Habib is a practical and responsible man as shown when he considered canceling the Museum Opening Party for the sake of cleaning up the mess Kazeem made. He is shown to not be very knowledgeable about his kingdom as shown when he asks "What is Fizz?" showing he doesn't know about the Genie Patrol much less that Fizz is the only member. He's also shown to be a strict parent as shown when he tells his son "Ahh, Zandar. What did I tell you about letting monkeys in the palace?!"

===Queen Farnaz===
Queen Farnaz<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Sofiathe1stWiki/status/868992045297356802|title=Sofia the First Wiki‚Äè Post|website=Twitter|date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> is a very responsible and practical woman as shown when she supports Habib's decision to cancel the Museum Opening Party for the sake of dealing with Kazeem. Like her husband, she is shown to dislike mischief.

==Role in the Series==
In "[[New Genie on the Block]]", they first appear with their son after [[King Roland II|King Roland]] and [[Queen Miranda]] of [[Enchancia]] both arrive at Tangu Palace. Since the Museum Opening Party is not until that evening, Habib asks them why they are early and the pair reveals that they have arrived to watch Sofia and Zandar's rehearsal prompting Zandar to step forward and reveal that Sofia has not shown up yet. Realizing that something is wrong, the pair and Zandar take off to find Sofia.

They are later seen after [[Kazeem]] creates a bunch of monkeys. Investigating a noise, the King and Queen find the monkeys trashing the party and Habib blames his son until Sofia steps forward and says she is responsible for this. When her mother asks how she is responsible, Sofia tells the Royal Family of Tangu about how she was on her way with a package for them that was delivered to Enchancia by mistake and released a genie named Kazeem, who caused this mess, by accident. Believing there no way to clean the mess in time, Habib decides to cancel the party but Sofia insists on fixing everything and takes off with her parents to do that.

After Kazeem undoes all his spells, a delighted Habib announces that the party is back on. Sofia then asks him if it's all right if the genie of the lamp no longer lives in his lamp after her last wish and he tells her yes. Habib and Farnaz are last seen watching his son's and Sofia's magic carpet dance.
