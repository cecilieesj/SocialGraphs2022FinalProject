Later, at night, she takes her father back home and puts him to bed as he continues to describe every event that occurred during his first encounter with Pete and Elliott. Then, she goes out to the lighthouse until she notices Pete walking "alone" into a nearby cave next to the shore. She tells him that Pete should be going home soon because she explains that when the tide rises, the water sometimes reaches the cave especially at night. Pete then introduces himself to Nora who also introduces herself to Pete just as Nora takes Pete home to offer him some chowder at home to which Pete skeptically accepts Nora's offer. Before Pete could go home with Nora, he manages to apologize to Elliott for his harshness. At home, Nora explains to him that Pete will be safe from danger just as Pete explains to Nora to know if she will ever get married to which upon seeing a picture of a man by the stairs, Nora explains to Pete that the man on the picture is [[Paul]] who was almost part of her family.

The next day, Nora tells her father to calm down after being fearful of Elliott to which she then discusses with Lampie that Elliott cannot be in the Town of Passamaquoddy because she would fear that Elliott could cause the same trouble he did when walking with Pete before having breakfast and cleaning the lighthouse. Later at home, Nora asks Pete to give oilcan to get ready for the night to which Lampie warns the two that no dragon shall by allowed on the lighthouse by government regulations but before Pete can do this task, he asks Nora to show Elliott the picture of Paul just as Nora agrees and tells her father for helping Elliott pretend that he doesn't exist to which Lampie discusses with his daughter about seeing the dragon Pete his privately just before Lampie goes down to the hardware store. That night, Nora goes to the top of the lighthouse and sings to hope that Paul would come back during the musical number "[[Candle on the Water]]" as she observes the horizon at a quiet night while Pete asks Elliott to help Nora find Paul and help him reunite with her.

The next day, Nora tells Pete that school is important to help him avoid ending up with [[the Gogans]]. Arriving at the docks, Nora encounters some fishermen just as she sings the musical number "[[There's Room for Everyone]]" about giving everyone space, especially for the dragon Elliott, to which Pete also sings in front of the children to give room for Elliott just before the school bell rings for Pete to go to school. Nora then approaches [[Miss Taylor]] who is slightly disappointed for making her students tardy and disrupting the class schedule just as Pete is taken to school.

Later, [[Dr. Terminus]] and [[Hoagy]] arrive at the lighthouse where Nora is at to which Nora ignores the two just as the Terminus and Hoagy approach Pete just as Terminus introduces himself and Hoagy to Pete explaining that Terminus and Hoagy are planning to buy Elliott to which Nora denies that Elliott is not for sale just before Nora and Pete continue painting the lighthouse to which their work is interrupted when they hear a loud blast from the foghorn, Lampie wakes up to help Pete and Nora paint the lighthouse just as Nora and her father explain that the lighthouse is Pete's new home while Elliott is to live in the cave. Nora then sings the musical number "Brazzle Dazzle Day" just as she, Pete, and Lampie work together in painting and cleaning the lighthouse. Later at the docks, Nora and Pete help catch a lobster only for them to be stalked by the Gogans who prepare to attack Pete only for them to be thwarted by Elliott. That night, Pete tells Nora that Elliott finally found Paul to which Nora believes that Paul has died after his ship crashed to which Pete denies, much to Nora telling Pete to talk about realistic topics more often.

Nora finally sees Paul who is thought to have died after being lost for a long time to her enthusiasm over the horizon. However, she notices the fire at the lighthouse's lamp was extinguished by a crashing wave just as Nora tells Lampie to to ignite the lamp so that she can find Pete. As the ship Paul and the captain are at is hitting a reef, Lampie urges Nora to sound the foghorn to to which Nora manages to sound the alarm in a plan to rescue the two just as Elliott manages to breathe fire to ignite the wick inside the lighthouse's lamp to rescue Paul and the sea captain. Nora praises Elliott for his bravery in helping save Paul and the fisherman on their ship about to hit a reef.

The next day, the townspeople are happy that Elliott saved the town and finally reunited with Paul who is happy to have reunited with Nora in joy to which Paul explains that he is the only survivor who survived the storm at Cape Hatteras after having a long amnesia during a storm.
