He is a student at [[Echo Creek Academy]], and one of [[Marco Diaz|Marco]]'s friends, alongside [[Alfonzo Dolittle|Alfonzo]], who is always looking for ways to pick up on girls, but never seems to have any success.

==Background==
===Personality===
Ferguson is the fun-loving, yet mostly immature friend to [[Marco Diaz]]. Despite being a teenager, he acts very childish and takes part in annoying, yet harmless debauchery. He is very observant however, as he did get annoyed when Marco would not be quiet about his adventures in [[Mewni]] and did display some disappointment over his friend prioritizing his personal interests over others, and occasionally does show some intelligence and knowledge as he is capable of speaking fluent Spanish. He is nevertheless, incredibly devoted to his friends and loves to have fun.

===Physical appearance===
Ferguson is a short and incredibly obese Caucasian boy with ginger hair, green eyes, and freckles. He usually wears a black t-shirt, which barely covers his belly, what appear to be grey warm up pants and black and white tennis shoes.

==Role in the [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil|series]]==
===Season One===
Ferguson and [[Alfonzo Dolittle|Alfonzo]], who according to [[Marco Diaz]] are two of the coolest people he knows, are his two nerdy friends who hang out with him and eventually [[Star Butterfly]]. True to Star's habit of starting adventures, Ferguson and Alfonzo get pulled into her shenanigans, particularly Ferguson who is nearly kidnapped by their school's rival team in "[[School Spirit]]" and almost marries a murderous pixie queen in "[[Pixtopia]]". Since then, he and Alfonzo would continue to take part in a variety of strange misadventures.

===Season Two===
Ferguson and Alfozno would make very few appearances; acting mainly as bystanders and only having minor interactions with Star and Marco. This would later be referenced in "[[Collateral Damage]]" where Star admits that she had barely seen the two of them almost all year.

===Season Three===
Ferguson and Alfonzo only make a single appearance in "[[Sophomore Slump]]" where they attempt to hang out with Marco, but he is so emotionally removed from them that they begin to avoid him. When Marco decides to go to [[Mewni]] as a foreign exchange student, the two of them see their friend off.

===Season Four===
Ferguson and Alfonzo return in "[[Britta's Tacos]]" where they hold no ill will to Marco and actually appear glad to be reunited with him. Furthermore, they have started their own D&D group with four other teens who, contrary to them, are rather attractive. They later witness Marco chasing after the portal in the sky in "[[Cleaved]]".

==Trivia==
*The character, along with [[Alfonzo Dolittle]] were prominent supporting characters in season one, but were immediately phased out in season two, most likely because the show's writers could not find a way to properly integrate them into the series. This was acknowledged in "[[Collateral Damage]]" and in the non-canon, and unfinished, [[Star vs. the Forces of Evil (Joe Books)|comic book]], it is implied that Star and Marco stopped inviting them on adventures out of annoyance.
