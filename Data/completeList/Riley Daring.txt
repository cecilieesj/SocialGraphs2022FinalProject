'''Riley Eugene Daring'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0096269/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t2</ref> is one of the main characters on ''[[The Replacements]]''. She and her brother [[Todd Daring|Todd]] are the adopted children of Agent K and Dick Daring. She is the older, more responsible, more naive, and more trustworthy sister who enjoys school. She is 12 years old in the first season and 13 years old in the last few episodes of the first season and season 2.[[File:RileyDaring11.jpg|thumb|250px|Riley as she appears in the second season.]]
==Background==
Riley normally uses the Fleemco phone to replace mean or unfair adults. She enjoys playing baseball, playing the violin, ponies, Hornet Hive Scouts, candy, and pretty much any form of sugar. At one point she was part of the Journalism staff at school.

She has a crush on Johnny Hitswell and they became a couple in season 2. However in "Heartbreak in the City", Johnny broke up with her because of her controlling attitude.

She has an imaginary unicorn friend named Rainbow Jumper. She gets a B average in school. She prefers playing country fiddle/country rock on the violin. She is a fan of Susie May, Dustin Dreamlake, and J.J. Baker. Riley loves reading books and the library. Riley had braces when she was younger. Riley also has a mission: Get Todd to do the right thing and be selfless. Sugar makes Riley hyper.

In "The Spy That Wasn't Riley", Riley tries one of her dream careers as a spy instead of a window washer that the Career Day test and the former guidance counselor Mr. Leslie told her to be, and almost blows up Antarctica when she stows away on K's mission to stop [[Dr. Scorpius]], but in the end, Riley saves the day even though K's mission is too dangerous. In "She Works Hard for the Movie" we learn that Riley has an Aunt Debbie and her middle name is Eugene. In "Ratted Out", she began to sing the very first song of the entire series entitled "My Rat Buddy".

In ''Davey Hunkerhoff'', Riley replaces an elderly lifeguard with a younger, new handsome guy named [[Davey Hunkerhoff]] and pretended to be in love with him in order to make her crush [[Johnny Hitswell]] jealous. However, Davey had fallen in love with Riley and was saddened when he explained that she was just using him to make Johnny jealous and quit his job as the lifeguard. After some forcing from Todd, Riley finds Davey and apologies for what happened and in bring back doing things for him to think up for it (e.g. peddling a bike to power a fan).

==Clothing==
In the first season, Riley only wears a yellow shirt, blue jeans with a multicolored belt around it, green sandals, and wearing a green hairclip on the left side of her hair.

In season 2, while she still wears the same outfit, this time, the color of her hairclip and sandals are now purple instead of green. Also, she wore a new outfit in the series; a blue hoodie, purple sweatpants, and blue shoes.

==Trivia==
*It was stated in "[[See Dick Run]]" that when Riley eats too much sugar; she goes into a crazy sugar rush.
*Riley has used the phone less than Todd in the series.
*She plays pitcher for her baseball team.
*Like the character [[Miley Stewart]] (which Cyrus voiced [[Celebrity Starr]]), they have blue eyes and performing music.
*Although Riley is considered the sophisticated one of the siblings, there have been several times where she has acted immature.
