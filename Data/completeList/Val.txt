On audition day Val's childhood friend E.J. sees Val and goes up to her to give her hug which causes E.J.'s girlfriend Gina to be jealous of E.J. and Val's relationship. Gina's bunk-mate Maddox tells Gina that Val is a long time camper who is now a C.I.T. (counselor-in-training). Then Maddox tells Gina that E.J. and Val go way back because they created a special bond when they played Gretl and Kurt together in ''The Sound of Music'' when they were young.
