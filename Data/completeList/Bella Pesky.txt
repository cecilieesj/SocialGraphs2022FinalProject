'''Bella Clarissa Pesky''' is the youngest of the Pesky siblings and is still in the stage of a maggot. Like her sister [[Maggie Pesky|Maggie]], she has pink hair, but she can only say "Gah" and "Goo". She can juggle, breakdance, and do ballet. Bella doesn't have a big part in any episodes, except in "[[Sister Act (The Buzz on Maggie)|Sister Act]]". In all the others, she's often just sitting at the dining table. Although she doesn't have any arms, she has her own fork and glass.
