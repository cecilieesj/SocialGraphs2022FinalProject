{{Quote|My dad is the best thing of all and I can't tell anyone about it. You have no idea how hard that is walking around with that secret for all these years. And now on top of everything, you're going out with Principal Newman? I mean, and you don't even tell me about it! My whole life has become about secrets and I hate it!|Charlie Calvin}}
