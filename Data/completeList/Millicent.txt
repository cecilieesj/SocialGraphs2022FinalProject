'''Millicent''' is a character from the Disney comic series ''Paperino Paperotto''. She is presented as a childhood friend of [[Donald Duck]]. She was created by [[Paola Mulazzi]].

==Physical appearance==
Millicent is a young female duck with white feathers and short black hair. She sports a red shirt, a gray plaid skirt and a red hairbow.

==Personality==
Millicent is always looking for moneymaking opportunities. Her idol is [[Scrooge McDuck]]. At first, she hated the nickname "Cent", but after Scrooge pointed out that every cent is a step toward infinity, she changed her mind.

In the French comic [[Le Journal de Mickey]] 2935 ''Monster High School'', Millicent was shown as a teenager, who was very aggressive and would push other girls away from Donald. This was probably an excuse to be near her idol, Donaldâ€™s Uncle Scrooge. After Donald officially ended their relationship and started one with [[Daisy Duck]], Millicent was furious.

In the Italian comic [[Topolino]] 3192-3196, Millicent was depicted as a full grown adult. She has become more successful as well, becoming a famous and wealthy businesswoman.
