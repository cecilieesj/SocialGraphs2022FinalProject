The '''Dapper Dans''' are a live barbershop quartet that performs in [[Main Street, U.S.A.]]. They only currently play in the [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Disneyland]], doing so since 1971 in the former and 1959 in the latter. They formerly played at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

On March 12, 2020, Disney Parks announced that the original version of the show would close temporarily at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, due to the COVID-19 outbreak's impact on Florida and California. 

On September 2, 2021, following Disneyland Resort's reopening, Disneyland announced that the updated version of the show would return.

On March 18, 2022, following Walt Disney World's reopening, Magic Kingdom announced that the updated version of the show would return, as part of Walt Disney World's 50th Anniversary celebration. 

== Summary ==
They are a "streetmosphere" show that occasionally play every day in [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] They can be easily differentiated by the color of their outfits (red, blue, purple, and yellow, with one of them sometimes, but not often, dressing in green) and always come in a quartet. Despite four actually coming out, about twelve are actually hired to do the performances. On occasion, they are seen with organ chimes, a set of handheld chimes on which they play instrumental songs such as "[[Baroque Hoedown]]". Although they do not sound like that of an actual organ, it makes a more exotic sound when shaken.

In the [[Magic Kingdom]], they perform nine sets a day, seven days a week. There is also a working barbershop where your hair can be done by them while they are serenading. In the morning, they can be seen riding a horse drawn trolley and all over Main Street in the afternoon. At 5pm, they join the Main Street Philharmonic. They also join the Flag Retreat Ceremony.

The songs sung by them are traditional and classic songs such as "''[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]''" or "''[[Mickey Mouse March|The Mickey Mouse Club March]]''" with comical acts and jokes in between.

=== Seasonal Variants ===
During the Fourth of July, their outfits are themed to the colors of the American flag. During Halloween, their attires change to a white and orange color scheme with black bands around their elbows and armpits, being called the "'''Cadaver Dans'''". They also guise themselves in a ghoulish look during that time. At this time of year, they sing numerous songs about or sung by villains, and sometimes other songs such as "''[[This is Halloween]]''" or ''"[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]''". During the holidays, they sing more Christmas oriented songs in their festive attire.
