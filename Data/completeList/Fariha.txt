'''Fariha''' is a character who appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. She made her debut in the [[Destined|third episode]] of the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'', and is portrayed by starring cast member, Adaku Ononogbo.

Fariha is a member of the [[Clandestines]]. She is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]], who was exiled to Earth, and has been searching a way to return home, ever since. She and the other members of the group seek out [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]], who possesses a [[bangle]], which serves as an instrumental key in their return home.

==Background==
Fariha is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]]. She, [[Najma]], [[Aisha]], [[Aadam]], and [[Saleem]], were collectively known as the Clandestines. Unknown circumstances lead to their exile. On Earth, they were left in a weakened state, and unable to access Noor to its full extent.

She and the other Clandestines learn from a man in a temple that they need to find two bangles, which will allow them to return back to their home dimension.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Photography - Cave Rumbles.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
In British Occupied India, 1942, Fariha and the other members of the [[Clandestines]] search the wreckage of an old cave, located within a cave, where they believe the bangles to be. The cave has been ransacked and looted by the British Army, leaving it in ruins, but Fariha, Najma, and Saleem continue to search, amongst the debris. Najma calls them over, after finding one of the [[bangle|bangles]], but Fariha expresses her concern, after finding itâ€™s attached to a severed blue arm. Saleem questions where the bangles other half is, but Fariha reminds him that the British are likely have got a hold it. At that moment, they group get sound of the Army's arrival, so Fariha and Saleem leaves to go check on Aadam, who is away from the others. They find the British Army in the process of destroying the cave, by setting it on fire, and Fariha alerts Najma and Aisha to what they're doing.

They manage to escape from the Army's grasp, but are unable to locate Aisha, who disappeared with the bangle. They continue to go on the run.

At some point, Najma has a son, with a human, whom she names [[Kamran]]. Kamran joins their ranks, and Fariha becomes acquainted with him.

When [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]] puts on the bangle, she unlocks her access to Noor, and Fariha and the other Clandestines are able to sense her, discovering that Aisha had kin, of this world. They resettle in [[New Jersey]], in hopes of using her as a means to return home.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Fariha and Aadam.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Fariha meets [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] at [[Aadam]]'s home, after [[Najma]] and [[Kamran]], rescued her from the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]]. Kamala learns from Najma, the [[Clandestines]] shared history with her grandmother, before she disappeared. When [[Aadam]] arrives in the room, singing along to a video, Fariha tells Kamala not to mind him, and comments on how he picks the stupidest parts of humanity to obsess over. When Najma reveals that Kamran thinks Kamala is adorable, Fariha and the others begin to tease him over his apparent crush.

Days later, Fariha learns from Najma that Kamala is having doubts in helping them return home. She and the Clandestines arrive at the venue where Kamala is located, to force her in helping them.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Clandestines Ready to Attack.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Fariha finds her running through the hallways, and follows her into the kitchen where she is joined by Saleem and Aadam. She attempts to attack her, but Kamala blocks the Clandestines moves, as while attack her at once, and manages to escape their sights. Najma turns off the lights and Fariha roams the kitchen, in search for her. Kamala creates a construct, alerting them to her presence, and Fariha holds a spear in hand, ready to attack. They find her in the main hall, and together they chase her. Fariha aims her spear towards Kamala, attempting to hurt her through multiple angles, but Kamala blocks her attacks. She then creates a giant crystalline fist, and hits Fariha, knocking her back. As Kamala runs down to exit the building, Fariha chases after her, and she, along with the other Clandestines, have the young girl surrounded. Before they capture Kamala, Damage Control agents sweep the building, and fire energy pulses at them. Fariha and the others are then arrested by the organization, shortly after.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x04 - Seeing Red - Clandestines in Prison.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The Clandestines are escorted into the D.O.D.C. Supermax Prison, where they are taken into custody. They are handcuffed to the railing, and walk in line, by the lead of the guards. A scuffle between the guards and the other Clandestines ensues, and Fariha swings her legs onto the overhead railing, until loosening the restraints. She takes the keys of an unconscious guard, and frees herself, and the others. The group make an exit, but leave Kamran behind, on Najma's orders.

The group track Kamala in Karachi, Pakistan, and arrive in pursuit of her. They break into the headquarters of the [[Order of the Red Daggers]] through the glass ceiling. Fariha briefly battles [[Waleed]], but he escapes with Kamala and the [[Red Dagger]].

The Clandestines follow Kamala, Waleed and Red Dagger, as their fight spills onto the streets. The trio get into an auto rickshaw to escape, and Fariha and Aadam commandeer an incoming truck to chase after them. The two pursue them, but Kamala creates a construct on the road, in the form of an upward slide, which the truck drives into, toppling it over.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x04 - Seeing Red - Fariha Spear.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Fariha and Aadam exit the truck and follow Kamala and the Red Dagger into a closed courtyard, full of laundry hung on clothing lines. They burst through the clothes, and Kamala smacks Fariha with an embiggened fist. She recovers and attempts to strike her with her spear, but Kamala blocks her with a force field. Fariha continues to try and penetrate it, but Kamala uses the shield to push her forward, and knocks her back. Najma stabs Kamala's [[bangle]], releasing a burst of energy, that pushes everyone backwards.

Fariha sits up from the ground, to find that the Veil of Noor has opened up before her. Fariha tells Najma that they can go [[Noor Dimension|home]], and she walks towards the pulsing light. Fariha raises her arm towards it, but her body transforms into a crystalline rock, then disintegrates, leaving her skeleton behind.
