The '''Sis Moles''' are characters featured in the [[1946]] [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film, ''[[Song of the South]]''. They are a trio of female moles prominently featured during the "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" animated sequence.

==Background==
The Sis Moles are three identical moles who live in the [[Briar Patch]]. Each of the three Sis Moles wears a yellow bow and a blue thin tutu indicating that they are female moles. When they approach [[Uncle Remus]], they happily sing in front of him alongside three hummingbirds, indicating they are friendly towards Uncle Remus himself.

==Appearances==
===''[[Song of the South]]''===
During the musical number "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" when [[Uncle Remus]] is strolling across the animated landscape, he encounters [[Mr. Bluebird]] who happily greets him to which the latter flies into the Sis Moles' home where they happily greet Uncle Remus to which they begin digging underground and emerge from a small patch of grass with daisies where they happily sing together followed by three hummingbirds vocalizing with them. They do not make any further appearances throughout the remainder of the film.

===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===
During the "[[Smile Darn Ya Smile]]" sequence, the Sis Moles are one of the [[Toons]] encountered by [[Eddie Valiant]] (in live-action form) where he happily drives across the [[Toontown]] sequence where they emerge into a small hill and sing along with the other animated characters. However, the bows and tutus they wear are pink.

==Trivia==
*Not counting [[Mr. Bluebird]]'s chirps and whistles in the film, the Sis Moles are one of the first animated characters to actually have dialogues in the film (in this case, singing lines).
*The three possums from the [[Splash Mountain]] attraction (which contains elements from ''Song of the South'' which the attraction is based on), Pansy, Poppy, and Petunia, wear identical bows and tutus resembling those of the Sis Moles from ''Song of the South'', despite the Sis Moles themselves not appearing in the attraction itself.
*Although ''Song of the South'' was never released in any official home video format in the United States, the Sis Moles have been sporadically featured on the front cover of the [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]] volume, along with the [[Hummingbird Trio|Hummingbirds]], the [[The Bees (Song of the South)|Bees]], the [[Butterflies (Song of the South)|Butterflies]], and [[Mr. Bluebird]]. They have also been featured on the volume's UK VHS cover.
