[[File:Clementine_the_ostrich.jpg|right|220px]] '''Clementine''' is an ostrich in Disney's [[1960]] movie, ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]''.

==Role in the film==
[[Francis Robinson]] tried to catch an ostrich, but after roping one by the tail, he ended up getting dragged face down through the ground. Nevertheless, his family was still able to catch, train, and name her Clementine.

On the day of the Robinsons' new holiday, Clementine is one of the animals who participate in the race, with [[Ernst Robinson|Ernst]] riding her, along with [[Duke and Turk|Turk]] (ridden by Francis' monkey), [[Lightning]] the mule (ridden by [[Fritz Robinson (Swiss Family Robinson)|Fritz]]), [[Rocky (Swiss Family Robinson)|Rocky]] the elephant (ridden by Francis), and [[Duchess (Swiss Family Robinson)|Duchess]] the zebra (ridden by [[Roberta]]).

In the end, after the pirates' deaths, and as Ernst travels to [[England]] with Roberta's grandfather, [[Captain Moreland]] to continue his education there, Clementine can be seen running away along with Duchess, [[Duke and Turk|Duke]], Turk, and Rocky as Francis tries to bring them back.

==Note==
*Ernst refers to Clementine as "Clementeen", while the others refer to her by her proper pronunciation.
