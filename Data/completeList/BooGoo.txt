'''BooGoo''' is a mysterious, purple, insect-like alien creature in the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime who is introduced at the beginning of the second season, ''Stitch! ~The Mischievous Alien's Great Adventure~''. Although a self-centered indulgence, she is a pet that is loved by everyone present on the island, except for [[Stitch]], who finds her annoying. She often accompanies [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] on certain missions throughout the anime series.

==Role in the series==
In one episode, Experiment 303 ([[Amnesio]]) zaps the memories of BooGoo, Stitch, Jumba, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], [[Reuben]] and [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]. Everyone's memory is shown to be stored in capsules under Amnesio's wings. When Amnesio is eventually captured, Gantu demands him to give up the memory-containing capsules. Near the end of the episode, it is shown that the capsule Gantu had swallowed didn't contain his own personality – it contained BooGoo's! Likewise, on Earth, Gantu finds himself in BooGoo's body and demands to be put back to normal.
