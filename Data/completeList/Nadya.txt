=== Personality ===
When asked in an interview if she was playing a Russian villain, Tina Fey responded:

{{Quote|I actually play a Russian good guy, kind of. Who knows? Maybe she ''seems'' like the bad guy. But just before I called you, I was on Skype with a dialect coach. And I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is for real. I have to try and do this!"<ref>Huffington Post.
