==Role in the series==
Tiburón is one of the evil [[Shark People]]. He has a red patch over one eye and a metal clawed hand. His goal is to rule the sea by using Neptune's Trident.

He battled [[Jake Long|Jake]] and [[Greggy Long|Greggy]] by riding on a giant sea cryptid called the [[Sea Serpent]]. His Sea Serpent got weakened by hot steam and he fell into the ocean with Tiburón.
