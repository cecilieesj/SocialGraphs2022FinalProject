'''Lian and Park''' are characters who appear in the [[2007]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. They serve as [[Sao Feng]]'s personal attendants who monitor his bathhouse before their deaths at the hands of [[Ian Mercer]] of the [[East India Trading Company]].

==Background==
Lian and Park serve as bodyguards of the Pirate Lord of Singapore, [[Sao Feng]]. [[Hector Barbossa]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]] met Sao Feng in his bathhouse still with the two serving him in a plan to save [[Jack Sparrow]] from [[Davy Jones' Locker]] and bringing in the [[Brethren Court]] in a plan to stop [[Davy Jones]] and [[Cutler Beckett]]. The sisters ended up having a slight giggle when [[Will Turner]] mentioned Sparrow's name to which the negotiations ran short when a group of EITC soldiers attack and do a battle with the pirates.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
Upon arriving at the town of [[Singapore]], Lian and Park serve [[Sao Feng]] during the meeting between [[Hector Barbossa]] and the Pirate Lord at his bath house. The twins ended up remembering the time with [[Jack Sparrow]] on board the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' remembering the name only to be silenced by their captain. The meeting, however, was interrupted when a group of [[East India Trading Company|EITC]] soldiers burst in the bathhouse. Lian and Park fought against them but when [[Ian Mercer]] entered and attacked [[Elizabeth Swann]] using a pistol, [[Will Turner]] pushed her out of her way and his shot ended up hitting Park instead, much to Lian enraged at her sister's death.

Escaping from the bathhouse, Sao Feng and his men participate in the battle at Singapore where Lian started taking revenge against Mercer by fighting him in a small storehouse and while fighting him, Mercer attacked Lian and while fighting, she ended up dying the same way her sister Park did, leaving both of them dead at the hands of Mr. Mercer.

==Trivia==
*Their names have been revealed in the reference book, ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide'' and the novel series ''Legends of the Brethren Court: Rising in the East''.
*In an early screenplay for ''At World's End'', Lian was to fight against Ian Mercer which he would have attacked her. Additionally, Lian's twin sister Park was to survive and attack Mercer taking revenge against him for causing her sister Lian's death.
*Lian's name means "link" or "connection" in Chinese, which is the possible fact that she is a twin to her sister Park.
