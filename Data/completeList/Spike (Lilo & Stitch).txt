His one true place is in [[Pleakley]]'s E.A.R.W.A.X. group, hugging and thus taming other truant experiments, after he is given protective armor to cover his goofiness-inducing spines.

==Background==
===Personality===
Spike is shown to be very troublesome, as his spines pose a dangerous threat to anyone pricked by them. He also has a feisty side to him and will attack any target, even if he is outnumbered. However, he is not afraid to express emotion as shown when he cried noisy tears while Pleakley hugged him during the E.A.R.W.A.X. session. This not only rehabilitated Spike, but also motivated him to be a hugging therapist and follow Pleakley's hugging-and-crying method.

===Physical appearance===
Spike is a large, quadrupedal, dark blue pangolin/porcupine-like experiment covered in incredibly sharp white-tipped spines from his head down to his long tail. He has black eyes, a red nose, and sharp black claws. His face, underbelly, and paws are white, and the only areas not covered in spines.

===Powers and abilities===
Spike can fire his spines like darts that are capable of hitting multiple targets at once. His quills also contain a venom that increases the victim's goofiness by 99% when struck, leaving them only 1% clever.

In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, it is also revealed that Spike can roll into a ball and launch his spikes while spinning at incredibly high speeds after being modified by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 319 was the 319th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to fire spines like darts that make his victims unintelligent by causing any hit victim's goofiness level to increase by 99%, leaving them only 1% clever. 319 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 319's pod landing by an outdoor stage.

When a clumsy servant carrying drinking water bumped into [[Dr. Gladys Okra|the public speaker]], the water bottle on the tray fell onto the stage and trickled out, which touched 319's pod, activating the experiment. 319 then climbed onto the stage and spiked Dr. Okra and her servant, causing them to act goofy. He next rolled in front of the entire audience and attacked them as well, scaring them all away.

Later, 319 attacked a museum until he was captured in a containment orb by [[Stitch]], but not before spiking him and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]. Luckily, 319's goofiness-inducing spines didn't seem to affect Jumba as much as Stitch (since the former was already a genius).

319 was then taken back to the [[Lilo's House|Pelekai residence]] and named Spike, who ultimately served as one of the experiments in [[Pleakley]]'s E.A.R.W.A.X. group. While the captive Spike was being rehabilitated, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] made a vain attempt to get a goofy Stitch to become smart again in time for the upcoming Ohana-Rama.

During Pleakley's seminar, he bored most of the experiments while discussing therapy topics from Dr. Okra. When a fight broke out between [[Slushy]] and [[Splodyhead]], a stray fireball from Splodyhead destroyed Spike's container, freeing him. Spike then went on a rampage, chasing [[Nosy]] around the house and eventually targeting Pleakley.

Forced to resolve the issue, Pleakley left for a moment and donned makeshift armor against Spike's spines. He then attempted hugging therapy on Spike, which surprisingly pacified the latter, who then sobbed pitifully. The other experiments, awed by Spike's outcome, tried out Pleakley's hugging-and-crying method as well.

The following night, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, and Spike attended the Ohana-Rama, where [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] sunk Lilo's team by answering each question correctly. Spike then offered Lilo a hug to cheer her up when she felt discouraged. She declined, however, because although Spike was rehabilitated, a stray spine would likely affect her intelligence.

Later during the contest, Lilo and Spike followed Stitch backstage to discover [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|Teresa]] was secretly helping Mertle cheat. Thus, Lilo convinced Spike to hug Teresa, who got pricked and kept giving Mertle completely silly answers as a result. After Lilo won the Ohana-Rama, Mertle stormed out in a rage. Spike felt sorry for Mertle and decided to hug her as well, spiking the latter.

Spike later found his one true place in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group, using hugging therapy to tame other truant experiments, while wearing similar protective armor to cover his goofiness-inducing spines.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Spike, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Spike participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by firing goofiness-inducing spines at attacking Leroys.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Spike has appeared multiple times in the ''Stitch!'' anime, including one instance in Season 2, along with [[Hammerface]], [[Babyfier]], [[Link]], and [[Woody (Lilo & Stitch)|Woody]]. It is revealed that [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] reverted these experiments to evil using a recording of [[Angel]]'s song, thus enabling them to wreak havoc on the [[Izayoi Island|island]]. In another episode, Spike was also used by Hämsterviel to try to sabotage a quiz competition. His abilities were modified in this episode so that he only reduces the victim's intelligence, and it can be magnified by squeezing his nose. It is also shown that he has the ability to roll into a ball and launch his spikes while spinning at incredibly high speeds. In "Shogun", it is shown that Spike was dehydrated back into an experiment pod and locked in [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]]'s vault.

Spike later appeared as one of the experiments who helped [[Stitch]] fight [[Dark End]]. He also appeared in the special, ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.

==Trivia==
*Spike is clearly based on porcupines, but unlike him, real-life porcupines cannot throw/shoot their quills, nor are their spines poisonous.
*When Jumba got pricked by Spike, he did not appear to be affected. However, he states that he is not immune to the effects of his creation, and that he does not act silly because even 1% of his intelligence is far superior to that of an average human being's intelligence.
*Spike is one of the few known experiments whose powers Stitch is vulnerable to.
*Spike, along with [[Nosox]], [[Richter]], [[Experiments#2-Series: Technological and scientific|Butter]], [[Splodyhead]], [[Gigi]], [[Tank (Lilo & Stitch)|Tank]], [[Shortstuff]], [[Yang]], [[Phoon]], and one unconfirmed experiment, are the only known experiments that are primarily quadrupeds.
*Spike is one of the six known experiments to be rehabilitated by someone other than Lilo and Stitch, the other five being Gigi, [[Elastico]], [[Yaarp]], [[Frenchfry]], and [[Snooty]].
**Spike, alongside Yaarp, was rehabilitated by Pleakley.
*Spike's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is yellow in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]]. In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, it is white.
*In the English dub of the anime episode "Link-age", [[Reuben]] states that Spike's favorite type of sandwich is a {{WikipediaLink|shish kebab}} {{WikipediaLink|Gyros|gyro}}.
