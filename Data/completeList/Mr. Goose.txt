'''Mr. Goose''' is a supporting character from the [[2015]] adaptation of ''[[Cinderella (2015 film)|Cinderella]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cinderella (2015 film)|Cinderella]]''===
Shortly after she turns two [[Lizard Footmen|lizards]] into footmen, the [[Fairy Godmother|fairy godmother]] comes across a large goose which she turns into a coachman for the [[Pumpkin Coach|golden carriage]] she conjured up earlier. As it becomes human, the goose protests that he can't drive, causing [[Cinderella (character)|Ella]] to giggle.

Nonetheless, the goose coachman manages to drive Ella to the royal palace and drives Ella out afterward to the best of his abilities.

Like the [[Lizard Footmen|lizard footmen]], even in human form, the goose coachman still retains goose characteristics in terms of his coloring (orange stockings representing goose legs and a white overcoat representing feathers).

He is later seen on the balcony with the [[mice]] and lizards as Ella and [[Prince Charming|Kit]] are married.
