==History==
Back when Sonny and Fillmore were acquainted, they pulled a number of pranks, some of which included a millennium protractor heist and a phony field trip to Fun-O-Topia Park. But Sonny didn't take too kindly to Fillmore turning to the Safety Patrol.

During the events of the episode, Fillmore and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] turned to Sonny to help them crack a case involving a missing ledger full of compact discs containing information on term papers off the street. In the end, it turned out that Sonny had been the one behind the case all along. Sonny knew that once the lost ledger containing the term papers had been found, Fillmore would take the ledger without a warrant and wouldn't be able to turn to Safety Patrol without serving detention. It was at this point that Fillmore produced the warrant with Peabody's signature. Fillmore also told Sonny that he neglected to delete the memory from his cell phone when he made an anonymous call to Peabody. Fillmore revealed the wire tap he was wearing, and Safety Patrol was brought to the scene. Sonny tried to make a getaway in the speedboat he was riding, but couldn't shake Fillmore. Sonny's life jacket got caught on the trident of the Sea Bowler's figurehead.

Before Sonny was taken away by the Safety Patrol, Fillmore said that he was never going back to being a troublemaker, and he had a new life and a new partner because of that. Fillmore said that Sonny would also regret not following his example.

==Trivia==
*According to Sonny's record, he served detention nine times. The charges ranged from forging fake library cards to slingshots.
