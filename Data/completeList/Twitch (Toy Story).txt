Twitch is later seen gambling inside a vending machine with [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s gang and helps apprehend [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys. He keeps a search light working in the playground while on patrol. As with his cohorts, he is eventually convinced of Lotso's evil by [[Woody]] and [[Ken Carson|Ken]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
Twitch is an insect-like warrior action figure toy at [[Sunnyside Daycare]]. He has a bug's head with red eyes along with ferocious chomping mandibles, wings, two beefy arms, removable chest armor, and his signature battle staff.

Twitch is first seen after the toys arrive at Sunnyside's [[Butterfly Room]]. After he helps [[Mrs. Potato Head]] get back up, she asks if she can feel Twitch's biceps. She is amazed by it, making [[Mr. Potato Head]] jealous and he tries to see his muscles, only for his arm to limp down, much to his disgust. Later, when Buzz leaves the [[Caterpillar Room]] to ask Lotso to transfer him and his friends to the Butterfly Room, he spots Twitch and [[Chunk]], who are on their way to the [[Vending Machine|vending machine]] to gamble, laughing about Buzz and his friend's rough playtime with the toddlers, making Buzz suspicious.

Inside the vending machine, Twitch and [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]]'s gang are gambling, as Buzz spies on them. Twitch thinks all the toys are disposable. It is shown that Twitch often makes fun of [[Ken Carson|Ken]], due to him being a "girl's toy" and his feelings for Barbie. After Buzz is caught by the henchmen and switched to "Demo" mode, Twitch is shown as one of Lotso's guards, helping apprehend [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s toys, and has the responsibility of being the playground night guard, watching for any toys trying to escape by using a search light.

Near the end of the film, Twitch and his cohorts follow Lotso to corner Andy's toys at a garbage dumpster. Twitch and Sparks carry a broken [[Chatter Telephone]] (which they beat up earlier). However, Twitch, along with his cohorts, is convinced of Lotso's treachery and deception by [[Woody]] and Ken, and reforms. He is shocked when he witnesses Lotso mistreat [[Big Baby]] by punching him in the stomach with his mallet. He then watches as Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster; afterwards, Twitch leaves the area, letting the toys escape and leaving Lotso to his fate in the dumpster.

In the end credits, Twitch is seen taking his turn in enduring a rough playtime with the toddlers in the [[Caterpillar Room]], switching with Chunk so he can rest. He is later seen at the disco in the Butterfly Room and has a happier life without Lotso.
