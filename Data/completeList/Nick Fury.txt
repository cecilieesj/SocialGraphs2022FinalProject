{{Quote|I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.|Nick Fury to [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]}}

'''Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is one of the main interlinking characters in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

He was the director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prior to its collapse and personally coordinated [[Avengers|The Avengers Initiative]] as well as recruiting them, such as [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. He only trusted very few people, such as [[Maria Hill]], [[Phil Coulson]], and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After faking his death during HYDRA's resurrection and the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D, he appointed [[Phil Coulson]] as Director and had him rebuilt [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] from scratch. He maintains ties with the organization with his splinter group consisting of [[Maria Hill]] and former S.H.I.E.L.D personal.

Nick Fury was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]] and Dick Ayers.

==Background==
===Abilities===
Nick is a master strategist and an astute judge of character. He uses these talents to great effect in his leadership of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick has used what would be called questionable tactics over the years but nonetheless, he will ultimately do what is right. Point in case, when the Council ordered him to strike the city with a nuke, but he would not; even going as far as disabling one of the planes ordered to strike the city with a rocket launcher and warning Tony Stark about it. He has shown while a man of great resolve and will, he too can feel, as he was shaken with the death of Coulson. He is a seasoned unarmed - and armed -combat expert as he was able to take down two brainwashed agents with ease.

He is also trained to use US military firearms (standard and automatic).

===Equipment===
*'''S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform:''' made from 9-ply Kevlar (able to withstand ballistic impact up to .45 caliber bullets) and a fire-resistant material whose kindling temperature is 1,700 °F (930 °C). Numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. paraphernalia including a radio-link tie.
*A government-issued Smith & Wesson M&P pistol. Also, an array of SHIELD weapons, conventional and otherwise.

===Weaknesses===
Nick has 95% vision loss in his injured left eye, over which he wears a cosmetic eye patch.

That night Tony discovers that someone entered his house, that someone was Nick Fury director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who wanted to talk about the Avenger Initiative.

====''Iron Man 2''====
[[File:Nickfuryironman2.png|thumb|left|250px]]
After the fight between Tony Stark and James Rhodes, Fury found Stark sitting on a giant doughnut, he asks Tony down to talk. During the conversation, Fury reveals Stark that his assistant Natalie Rushman was really the Agent Romanoff. He then continues speaking with him at Stark's mansion and at the end of the talk Fury gives Tony a box of assets that belonged to Howard Stark also orders Romanoff to continue undercover at S.H.I.E.L.D while Coulson babysits Stark. Later, he reassigned Coulson to [[New Mexico]].

After the battle of Stark Expo, Fury meets again with Tony to inform him that they found unsuitable candidate for the Avenger Initiative, but that S.H.I.E.L.D would interested in keeping him as consultant, which Stark initially doesn't accept it and says he cant afford me but then changes his mind as long as Fury can get a presenter as he and Rhodes are getting medals for the defeat of Whiplash. Fury, then agrees as he gets [[Senator Stern]] to award them their medals. Later, Phil contacts Fury on his phone to inform him he found a hammer in [[New Mexico]].

====''Thor''====
In a post-credits scene, Fury summons Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] to a S.H.I.E.L.D. base to show him the [[Tesseract]]. He asks Selvig to head its research, which Selvig agrees.

====''Captain America: The First Avenger''====
[[File:NickFuryCA.png|thumb|250px]]
[[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] awakened from his sleep after being found in the Arctic Circle having survived being frozen for so long. When he awoke, and Fury personally stopped him and met him in New York City apologizing for the deception it was best to break it down slowly and informed him he has been asleep for over 70 years. In a post-credit scene, Fury visits Rogers at the gym while he is working out at to give him an assignment to locate the [[Tesseract]].

====''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''====
[[File:Nick Fury shooting.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Nick Fury in ''The Avengers''.]]
With little to show for his efforts in bringing together a group of extraordinary people, Fury shelved his plan and began focusing on weaponry instead. "Phase Two", as the offshoot idea came to be called, involved re-engineering weapons technology that had emerged in the hands of HYDRA years earlier, as well as other cutting edge, or alien, technology. The Tesseract, that he had assigned Professor Selvig to investigate, formed a significant part of this puzzle. When the Tesseract began emitting unexpected levels of gamma radiation, Fury was quick to personally take charge of the operation. The emissions proved to be a prelude to the appearance of [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] on Earth, and neither Fury, nor his personnel had the power to stop Loki escaping with the Cube.

Desperate for a solution to the problem of Loki's possession of apparently limitless power, Fury reactivated the Avengers Initiative. He effortlessly brought Steven Rogers in and dispatched agents to call in the help of Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner. In short order, Loki made his first public appearance, and was apprehended, heralding an unexpected further addition to the collection of extraordinary people when Loki's brother Thor arrived, making demands of his own for Loki's extradition.

Fury could do little to quell the rising tensions in a ship now packed with egos, and problems only escalated when some of these people uncovered his deceptions surrounding Phase Two. With arguments boiling over, Loki played his hand, and Fury and the others were caught completely off guard when the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier came under attack in a daring commando raid by Loki's soldiers. Fury returned to his post on the bridge to take command of the situation and was instrumental in warding off an assault there.

In the wake of the battle, Fury found agent Coulson mortally wounded by Loki's hand. He resolved to use Coulson's sacrifice to his advantage, exploiting it to give a "push" to Stark and Rogers. Despite the ethically questionable nature of the plan, it proved to be effective, and the men set off in pursuit of Loki shortly thereafter. The Avengers Initiative may have finally come to fruition, but Fury's role in their battle was not yet done. The World Security Council issued orders to send a nuclear missile into the vicinity of Manhattan, which Fury refused, but then overriding orders saw one fighter jet escape him after he knocked another out of action with a rocket.

The Avengers Initiative ultimately won out. Fury's defiance of the World Security Council may not have been forgotten, but his methods and actions had saved the world. He resolved to call upon the Avengers should they be needed again, and made further assurances that they would come if that happens.

====''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''====
In the episode "[[0-8-4]]," an enraged Fury meets with Coulson after the latter's mission in Peru led to substantial damage of the Bus after Coulson's team had it for 6 days. He orders Coulson against letting Fitz-Simmons add any modifications like a fish tank, and warns him that Skye is a risk.

After the Battle of Triskelion in "[[End of the Beginning]]," Fury finds Fitz and Simmons just in time to save them when the two were stuck in the middle of the ocean. When Simmons wakes up being treated, she tells him the location of Coulson. Fury then joins Phil in fighting John Garett. While Coulson crawls for cover, he finds Fury waiting for him. Despite Coulson being furious about Project T.A.H.T.I., he agrees to focus it on Garrett and Fury gives him the Destroyer Gun. Coulson manages to take down the guards but Fury fires at Garrett in the heart several times but survived thanks to the formula as Garett misquotes one of Fury's speeches.

However, [[Deathlok (Michael Peterson)|Mike Peterson]] then turns on John, after learning that Skye saved his kid from HYDRA custody, and kills him. In the Bus, Phil lectures Fury for using Project T.A.H.I.T.I on him when he warned him of people losing their minds and recommends it to be shut down. Fury defends his actions, saying that May was on his case and he considers him an Avenger as he hands Coulson the toolbox containing all of S.H.I.E.L.D's files to help him rebuild the organization. Appointing Coulson to Director, Fury then leaves to Europe to fight HYDRA.

====''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''====
[[File:CapTWS2733.jpg|thumb|250px|Nick Fury in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.]]

Stark said his reasons for creating [[Ultron]] as Fury told him they were only visions produced by the Maximoff girl. As the team was saddened by the defeat, he encouraged them to stand and fight. In addition, he asked to Stark Maria Hill's assistance in order to help the Avengers.

While the Avengers fought with Ultron and his Sentries, Fury arrived with the Helicarrier along with [[Maria Hill]] and former S.H.I.E.L.D agents to Sokovia to take the civilians to safety and sent [[War Machine]] into the fight against Ultron. During the battle, one of the sentries broke into the Helicarrier, [[Maria Hill]] shot at it multiple times but it didn't slow it down Fury was able to destroy it by stabbing it.

After manage to make the Kree retreats from Earth, the lost of Fury’s left eye was actually a comical result by his now alien pet cat Flerken, [[Goose]], and her scratch leaves incurable nasty scar on his left eye, much to [[Talos]]’ confirmation on replying to Fury about it.

It is revealed after returning to S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers Initiative he created was inspired by Carol’s pilot call, “Avenger”.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Fury was originally white. Nick Fury as seen in the movies was based on his Ultimate universe incarnation, wherein Marvel expressly requested Samuel L. Jackson for permission to use his likeness; Jackson agreed as long as he could portray the character in the future. This version turned out so popular with fans that he was brought into the mainstream universe in 2002, written as the illegitimate son of the original Fury.
*Samuel L. Jackson's appearances in ''Iron Man'' and ''Thor'' were uncredited, as he only appears at the very end after the credits.
*The story told by Fury in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' in an actual true story of Samuel L. Jackson's grandfather.
*John Watts pitched Fury as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s mentor in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', but [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] was chosen instead. Fury later become his ally in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.
*In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Fury lost an eye when Goose scratched it, while in the comics it was when shrapnel hit it.
*The MCU Fury was born 1950, making his physical prowess despite his age very impressive. This puts him at 45 during ''Captain Marvel'', 62 at the time of ''The Avengers'' and 69 by ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' due to being dead between ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''.
