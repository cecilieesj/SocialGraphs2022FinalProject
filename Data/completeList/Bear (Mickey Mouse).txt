The unnamed '''Bear''' is a character and antagonist from ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''.
==History==
He is a grizzly bear whom [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] mistakes for [[Pluto]] in ''[[The Pointer]]'' while hunting and later shows up again to haunt [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Hiawatha]] in ''[[Good Scouts]]'', ''[[Donald's Vacation]]'', and ''[[Little Hiawatha]]'' respectively.

He then comes to protect his child when Donald threatens to turn him into a fur coat in the [[1946]] animated short, ''[[Dumbell of the Yukon]]''.

==Trivia==
*Originally, the bear was going to be a minor antagonist in [[A Goofy Movie]], but was eventually scrapped from the film and was replaced by a male [[Bigfoot]].
