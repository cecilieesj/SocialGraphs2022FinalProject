'''Sunni Gummi''' is one of the main characters in the 1985-91 [[Disney]] television series the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
Sunni is the second-youngest of the [[Gummi Bears|Gummies]], and dreams of becoming a princess. This desire leads her to become best friends with [[Princess Calla]]. Sunni is shown to be curious about human culture, but not nearly as concerned about Gummi history.

==Role in the series==
Sunni's appearances generally revolve around her desire to be a princess, as well as her desire to be older. Early on, she is shown to have a talent for singing that leads to her being kidnapped by the [[Carpies]].

After expressing to elder [[Zummi Gummi|Zummi]] that she wishes she could change her life, Zummi conjures a "[[Changing Hat]]" that transforms the wearer into the one whose name they say aloud. Sunni changes into Calla and seeks to see what it would be like to be a princess, with [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] tagging along as her "pet bear". The real Calla runs away from home earlier after feeling trapped by her royal duties. After causing a minor fracas in the castle, Sunni realizes that the grass isn't as green on the other side as she had thought; but before they can leave, Sunni, as "Calla", is captured by [[Duke Igthorn]], while the real Calla and [[Cavin]] are kidnapped in the woods by Igthorn's [[Ogres]]. Calla and Sunni meet for the first time in a tower prison cell, and Calla becomes fast friends with Sunni and the other Gummies after they unite to escape [[Drekmore Castle]].

Later on, Sunni runs into problems regarding her lack of knowledge of Gummi history. When [[Grammi Gummi|Grammi]] is trying to find an apprentice to teach the [[Gummiberry Juice]] recipe, Sunni proves to be the only suitable candidate. This proves to be a mistake, when Grammi gets captured by Duke Igthorn, and the male Gummies spearhead a rescue mission to which they require Sunni to make the juice for them. At Calla's advice, they both return to Drekmore Castle, to rescue the Gummies and get the recipe back. She tricks the Ogres in the Gummiberry Juice factory room to get herself the ingredients. Remembering the three-step stir, she makes the only stable batch of the juice and is able to rescue Grammi from falling from Drekmore's tallest tower.

Later in the series, she is shown to have a crush on [[Gusto Gummi|Gusto]]. This gets her into trouble in the episode "[[Water Way to Go (Adventures of the Gummi Bears)|Water Way to Go]]", when they both encounter an exotic mermaid named [[Aquarianne]], washed up on the beach. Gusto wants to sketch her, but they are driven away by Aquarianne's sea beast pet [[Finwithit]]. The mermaid then realizes that the two Gummies weren't out to hurt her, returns Gusto's sketchbook (albeit ruined by the water), and rescues Sunni from drowning. Out of jealousy, Sunni tells Aquarianne that when Gusto said he was going to "capture" her, he was going to put her up on his wall for real. Duke Igthorn and [[Toadwart]] capture Aquarianne and steal her cod shell whistle that summons her beast (so they could use it to destroy [[Dunwyn Castle]]). The Gummies rescue the mermaid from Drekmore and foil Igthorn's plans. After a heartfelt apology for lying to her about Gusto, the two girls hug, and Gusto is inspired to sketch them together.

In the episode "[[Rocking Chair Bear]]", Sunni openly expresses her desire for Gusto to notice her.

Sunni and Princess Calla are often paired in their own adventures, like when a [[Princess Marie|selfish princess]] from another country comes to visit and throws her weight around, nearly causing a war between the kingdoms because she wants Calla's "Gummi Bear doll."

In "[[Girl's Knight Out]]", Sunni helps Calla win herself the right to protect herself, by entering as a mystery squire in a Squire's Competition for being Calla's royal protector. With Sunni's help, Calla's pretense works, and after telling her father the truth, Calla wins the competition and gives the other cowardly squires (especially blowhard [[Unwin]]) their just desserts.
