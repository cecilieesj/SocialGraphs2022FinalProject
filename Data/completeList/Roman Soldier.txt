==Appearances==
===''[[The Small One]]''===
He was first seen halting [[The Boy|the boy]] and [[Small One (Character)|Small One]] from entering the city to ask the boy why does he come. The boy answers to sell Small One. After looking at Small One, he tells him there's a place which needs an animal like Small One, he says the third shop in the gate. The boy thanked him, and as they left to the shop, the soldier fearfully laughed for little did the boy knew that the shop belonged to [[the Tanner]], which means he intends to kill Small One. The Roman soldier was not seen again afterwards.
