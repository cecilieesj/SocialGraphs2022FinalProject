Harrison Hightower IV|dislikes=Superstition|status=Deceased|shorts=Tower of Terror: The Mystery}}'''Harrison Hightower III''' is the main character of [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s [[Tower of Terror (attraction)|Tower of Terror]]. A corrupt member of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]], Hightower collected treasures and antiquities from around the world under shady circumstances. This would eventually be his downfall when he stole a certain item: a cursed idol by the name of [[Shiriki Utundu]].

==Background==
===Biography===
Hightower was born in New York in 1825. When Hightower was twelve and attending Snoddington Academy in England, he bullied [[Cornelius Endicott II]], as the two's families had been feuding for generations. This started a long and bitter rivalry between the two, with Endicott becoming his main business rival. Hightower was later expelled in disgrace, just weeks before his graduation, after a prank allegedly involving some glue and a goat got out of hand. Hightower blamed Endicott for his expulsion, with Endicott never forgiving Hightower for the unbelievable cruelty of said prank.

After inheriting his father's fortune and company in 1847, Hightower battled Endicott in becoming New York's most dominant figure, with Hightower using his wealth to undermine Endicott at every turn, such as making Endicott the only influential New Yorker not invited to his hotel's opening, and denying Endicott membership to the Pharaoh's Explorers Club, which Hightower controlled.

While escaping from hostile natives in the jungle of the Congo River, he and his expedition crew ran into the dreaded Mtundu. They were surprisingly friendly towards the foreigners and invited them to share food. During the meal, Hightower learned of the tribe's protective deity, Shiriki Utundu, personified in the form of an idol resting on an altar in the village. With his curiosity and greed lit afire, the businessman tried to convince the tribe's headman to sell the statuette to him. When he refused, Harrison stole it from the village and fled with his expedition. Oddly enough, the Mtundu gave no indication of wanting to chase them for their crime, even appearing to be smiling slightly...

On the afternoon of December 31, 1899, Harrison Hightower threw a press conference and a New Year's Eve party in his hotel to boast of his "latest find," showing a pompous attitude and allowing no real question. When reporter [[Manfred Strang]] from the New York Globe-Telegraph asked if Shiriki Utundu wasn't really cursed, an annoyed Hightower had him thrown out.

That night while his celebration was a success, Harrison went to find a spot for the idol in his penthouse. He was stopped at the elevator by Mr. Smelding, his personal valet, with a warning to show proper respect for the statue. A sneering Hightower refused to listen, and defiantly extinguished his cigar on Utundu's head.

On January 1, 1900 12:00 AM midnight inside the elevator, Shiriki Utundu came to life with an evil green glow in its eyes, horrifying Mr. Hightower. The cursed idol gave out a terrible laugh as it summoned green lightning to blast Harrison into oblivion, plunging the elevator down the shaft and causing the chaos that led to the hotel's closure and its reputation as a haunted place.

13 years later, he noticed Strang and [[Beatrice Rose Endicott]], and tried to use the telephone and warned them to get out of the hotel. Strang was surprised to hear his voice, and realized that Shiriki Utundu really was cursed.

=== Development ===
Harrison Hightower III was created for Tokyo DisneySea's Tower of Terror in [[2006]] for an original story due to Japanese audiences being less familiar with ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', on which the American and European versions are based. Hightower was inspired by American politician and businessman William Randolph Hearst while being played by imagineer [[Joe Rohde]]. Hightower's classic depiction was that of an evil colonial thief and pillager with most Joe Rohde depictions of the character falling in said line.

In [[2013]], Hightower was retconned into being a member of the ''Society of Explorers and Adventurers'' with the attraction Mystic Manor in [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. In contrast to Tower of Terror, Mystic Manor had a lighter tone and skewed more towards a romantic view of scientific and archaeological exploration of the late colonialist era with heroic white explorers, contrasting the villainous Hightower. Subsequent usages of Hightower in this shared continuity would lean on him as representing colonialism's evils and the dark side of exploration such as in Aulani, and he and his successors would be established as outright antagonists to a reformed S.E.A. in multimedia projects such as the Shinji Takahashi books. A timeline presented at the 2022 D23 Expo outlining a greater meta-narrative for SEA would make minor adjustments to Hightower's history, retconning his birth from 1835 to 1825.

===Personality===
Harrison Hightower III is presented as a decadent and greedy heir who used his money and influence to get what he wanted -- namely, artifacts and items from cultures found around the globe. If something piqued his interest, he stopped at nothing to acquire it for his own, finding no qualms about resorting to methods such as outright plunder and exploiting the good will of the native people he encountered, keeping the stolen items stored in his inherited mansion-turned-hotel on display as trophies. Harrison was a particularly skeptical and disrespectful man who mocked the thought that Shiriki Utundu was cursed -- something that led to his eventual downfall.

===Physical appearance===
Harrison Hightower is shown as an elderly man with a white beard and mustache. He wears a white vest, red and yellow checkered fez, and a dark, fur-trimmed overcoat over black boots and tan travel pants.

She goes on to identify the Pillagers Brigade and Hightower himself as being ancestors of the Adventurers Club which the club acknowledges but wishes to grow away from and make amends with.

====[[Tower of Terror (attraction)|Tower of Terror]]====
On the tours of [[Hotel Hightower]] presented by the New York Preservation Society, archival recordings of a press conference tell the story of how his contact with the Shiriki Utundu statue led to the events of the hotel's haunting.

During the ride, guests see the blue ghost of Harrison Hightower reaching out to touch the idol resting on a table in a hallway, before it reanimates itself once more and zaps him into an elevator shaft, sending him crashing down.

=== [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] ===

Ltd.]] Skipper Canteen restaurant's library are written by him, with titles including "MINE!: Treasures of the Animal Kingdom" and "[[Expedition Everest|Everest Expedition]]: Search for the [[Yeti]]".

Hightower is also used as the namesake for the "Hightower Spirit of Adventure Award" given to Dr. Albert Falls.

Despite Hightower III's public disavowal of the supernatural, it's said that much of his fortune was gained from Hotel Hightower being built atop an enchanted font of luck.
