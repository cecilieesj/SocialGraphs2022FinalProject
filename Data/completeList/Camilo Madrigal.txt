{{Quote|Isabela, your boyfriend's here!|Camilo mocking Isabela in [[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]".}}
'''Camilo Madrigal''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film ''[[Encanto]]''. He is the middle child of [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Félix Madrigal]], younger brother of [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] and older brother of [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]. Described and proclaimed “theatre kid” of [[The Madrigals]], Camilo was gifted with the ability to shapeshift into any person he wanted.

==Background==
{{Quote|Seven-foot frame, rats along his back<br>When he calls your name, it all fades to black<br>Yeah, he sees your dreams, and feasts on your screams.|Camilo describing his version of his [[Bruno Madrigal|long-lost uncle]].}}
Born into the [[The Madrigals|Madrigal]] family, Camilo is the middle child of [[Pepa Madrigal|Pepa]] and [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]], younger brother of [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] and older brother of [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]. In addition to being the nephew of [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] and [[Agustín Madrigal|Agustín]], Camilo is also the cousin of [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] and [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]]. He is Mirabel's second-oldest cousin and the same age as her, being only a few months older,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1475712637669285893|title=Camilo and Mirabel|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 28, 2021|access-date=December 29, 2021}}</ref> and shared the nursery together for their first five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1478382776214827016|title=Nursery Sharing|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 4, 2022|access-date=January 17, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1481269487718449155|title=Nursery Roomates|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 12, 2022|access-date=January 17, 2022}}</ref> On the night of Camilo‘s fifth birthday, he received the gift of Shapeshifting and he subsequently moved out of the nursery and into his own room. Camilo sometimes likes to use his shapeshifting gift to mock his relatives (mainly his father and Isabela) or to take care of the children and infants in the village. 

Due to his gift being not very useful to the community, Camilo seems to be one of the members of the family with the fewest responsibilities imposed on him by [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]]. Despite this, Camilo also suffers from pressure and has insecurities like any of his relatives. Camilo hides his fears under his cheerful demeanor and is described as someone who "doesn't quite know who he is yet", hinting that he has self-identity issues. Unlike his sister or older cousins, Camilo, like Mirabel, has no memory of Bruno since his uncle was very secretive in the last years he was still in the family and disappeared when Camilo was only five years old. Camilo grew up knowing nothing about Bruno and only heard some rumors from his relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1477825101743616002|title=Camilo and Bruno|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 2, 2022|access-date=January 2, 2022}}</ref>

===Official Description===
:''Camilo is a teen who doesn't know who he is yet, still growing in life and trying different personas. His magical gift is the ability to shapeshift.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/w/news/2021/09/10/encanto-character-details/|title=“Encanto” Character Details Revealed|website=LaughingPlace|last=Newsdesk|first=Disney|date=September 10, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

:''Camilo, Pepa and Félix's middle child, was born to entertain. Throw in his magical gift that allows him to switch up his appearance to be whomever he wants to be in the moment, and he's secured his place in the spotlight.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/meet-the-characters-of-encanto/|title=“Encanto” Character Details Revealed|website=D23|last=Team|first=D23|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

===Development===
As with the rest of the Madrigal family, Camilo was designed to reflect "family archetypes that are immediately relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-11-29/encanto-explained-disney-colombia-consultants|title=‘Encanto’ is Disney’s first Latino musical. How the filmmakers got Colombia right|website=LATimes|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=November 24, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> The studio created Camilo in mind of being "a teen who doesn't quite know who they are yet and are trying on a lot of different personas".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2021/09/10/encanto-meet-the-magical-madrigal-family/|title=‘Encanto’: Meet The Magical Madrigal Family|website=TheDisInsider|last=Shuler|first=Skyler|date=September 10, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> During the creation process, Camilo was originally imagined as an "angry teen" with an antagonistic role in the film similar to that of Isabela and an arrogant and rude attitude, opposed to the easy-going and amicable Camilo in the final production. To create his appearance, the studio initially thought of letting Camilo's hair cover one of his eyes in order to convey a negative attitude. Something that did not change was his clothing, which from the beginning to reflect his shapeshifting ability, Camilo's clothing was planned to have a chameleon motif, in addition to keeping his ruana and black sandals.<ref>[[The Art of Encanto]]</ref>

Camilo's voice actor, Rhenzy Feliz, described his character: ''"someone who's a little crazy, a little dramatic, and someone who's a lot of fun, and a lot of energy, you're born an entertainer. So that's kind of Camilo. He's, like, this entertainer. He sort of wants to make everyone laugh, have a good time. And I sort of feel like that. I mean, I'm an actor, so when you sort of try and get that spotlight, it feels nice, it feels good. So he's kind of like that. And so he's out there, trying to get that attention. He has a good time and he's a lot of fun, but he loves his family."''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vitalthrills.com/encanto-movie/|title=Encanto Movie Cast & Crew on the New Disney Film|website=VitalThrills|last=Busch|first=Jenna|date=November 8, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>

===Personality===
[[File:Camilo repeating food.png|thumb|left|180x180px|Camilo repeating himself a large plate of food made by his aunt, Julieta.]]
Described as a "theater kid"<ref name="Ages"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2021/09/30/how-the-magical-casita-in-encanto-is-a-new-kind-of-disney-castle/|title=How the Magical Casita in ‘Encanto’ is a New Kind of Disney Castle|website=The Nerds Of Color|last=Lee|first=Michael|date=September 9, 2021|access-date=December 18, 2021}}</ref> and natural entertainer, Camilo is a fun-loving, easy-going, and energetic teenager. Unlike his quiet older sister and his timid younger brother, Camilo is more extroverted than them and the one that takes after their spirited parents the most. Social and charismatic, he is on good terms with many of the townsfolk, displaying a charming attitude when welcoming them to [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]'s gift ceremony. While not boastful or vain, Camilo enjoys the spotlight and has a good sense of humor with a penchant for dramatic movements, such as twirls or exaggerating stories based on rumors (his tales about [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]]) for flair.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1475899015296258051|title=Storyteller Camilo|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 28, 2021|access-date=December 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1477818643480076289|title=Mirabel's memories of Bruno|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 2, 2022|access-date=January 2, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1477825101743616002|title=Camilo's memories of Bruno|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 2, 2022|access-date=January 2, 2022}}</ref> He is noted to enjoy eating, particularly food by his aunt [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]], and is seen trying to sneak seconds by pretending to be [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] and serving herself much larger plates than any adult in the family. In the books and novels of the film it is revealed that when he is not using his gift to spend playing pranks or helping out in village, Camilo loves sports like football and enjoys playing mostly with the company of Casita or friends from village.

[[File:Camilo mocking Isabela.png|thumb|180x180px|Camilo shapeshifts into Mariano to prank [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]].]]
Young and still discovering himself, Camilo enjoys using his shapeshifting ability to try different personas and playing pranks or playfully teasing his relatives. Of all the family members, his cousin [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]] is notably the person he enjoys teasing the most. As shown when he consecutively mocks Isabela for her engagement to [[Mariano Guzmán]] and every time the man is mentioned, Camilo shapeshifts into him to annoy her, much to her cousin's dismay. Another person that Camilo likes to tease and mock is his father [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]], as seen before Antonio's ceremony when he transformed into him and repeated his father's words in an amusing manner. Also to some extent, he may enjoy dramatizing about his long-lost uncle Bruno as a creepy and evil monster, though it's possible they are not out of any truly malicious feeling towards him. While mischievous and a bit impertinent, Camilo's antics are harmless and are simply playful in nature, often taking to being caught or scolded by his father in good stride, such as responding with a good-natured "worth a shot". When Isabela flicks flowers into his open mouth for his teasing, he merely spits them out with a sheepish look on his face, showing no annoyance when caught when he does mischief.

[[File:Encanto Pepa & Camilo.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Camilo trying to calm his stressed mother.]]
Despite his wisecracking and impish demeanor, Camilo has a very tender, sweet, and responsible side, especially towards his family. Much like Mirabel, Camilo is good with children and infants, frequently using his gift to play with them and care for them as part of his service to the village, and also a caring brother to Antonio, as he tries to help him relax during his ceremony by jokingly impersonating their father. In a family photo, he has his arm lovingly around him and then, when the family loses their powers, Camilo pushed past his own pain of losing his gift to worry over how Antonio was feeling. During "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]", Camilo treats Mirabel very gently, even when attempting to lightheartedly scare her with his impression of Bruno, and didn't fling her around like the other family members. When Mirabel tries to go after the [[Miracle Candle]] in the crumbling [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]], Camilo (along with Isabela) runs after her to help her get it and save the miracle because all his life [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela]] has told them that it is the most important object in the [[Encanto (location)|Encanto]], demonstrating his protective drive to help his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479858236274581507|title=Camilo & Isabela|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479867130157821953|title=Camilo & Candle|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479869407090266113|title=Saving the Candle|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref> Unlike how he constantly teases his father, Camilo is very sweet to his mother. When dealing with his emotional mother, he treats her in a soothing manner when trying to get her to calm down and puts up with being accidentally jolted by her without complaining.

[[File:What is that Not a house.png|thumb|180x180px|Camilo showing a more expressionless and sarcastic side after the fall of the house.]]
While not addressed or shown in the film, Camilo does suffer from pressure and has insecurities like much of his family, though he hides it under his cheerful demeanor. Although he enjoys his gift, it makes him questions his sense of self, and constantly shapeshifting for others does tire him out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479872868271808519|title=Camilo's Issues Part 1|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479877246525394944|title=Camilo's Issues Part 2|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref> When the secret about Bruno's vision and the impending destruction of the Casita is revealed, Camilo is visibly stressed and was clutching his entire head in fear. His rare moments of stress can affect his gift, such as him involuntarily changing into a baby’s head. Although he likes to exaggerate his expressions when he transforms into other people, Camilo himself displays a dry wit. After being sad about losing the [[Casa Madrigal]], Camilo snarkily emphasizes that the family is left homeless and protested not being allowed to speak the truth as he points to the rubble of the house with an incredibly neutral expression. In the novelization, Camilo's personality is notably more rude, sassy, sarcastic and arrogant than in the film. At Mariano and Isabela's failed proposal dinner, Camilo happily tells his father about Bruno's vision and Mirabel hears him wondering if she's going to make him lose his gift, when in the film Camilo was nervous because the magic was in danger. After the Casita collapses, Camilo makes an unflattering and cruel comment about Mirabel when they are in the ruins of the house, whereas in the film he was busy worrying about Antonio.

===Physical Appearance===
Camilo is a 15-year-old<ref name="Ages">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468685741769125888|title=Ages|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 8, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref> Colombian boy with a slender build, light golden-brown complexion, curly, dark auburn hair, hazel green eyes, and freckles across his nose and cheeks, along with dark tint on his eyelids. Of all the grandchildren, Camilo is the one who most resembles his Abuelo Pedro. Although they have various differences in skin color, facial structures and hair, Camilo's features and facial expressions are very similar to Pedro's, in addition to inheriting a large part of his way of dressing. Like his late grandfather, Camilo wears a white long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up, his collar opened with the buttons mismatched, and the rest is left largely unbuttoned and loose, except for the right side tuck into his pants. He also wears a yellow {{WikipediaLink|ruana}} with darker yellow streaks, black pants and black sandals with white etchings. Symbolizing his shapeshifting ability, Camilo's clothes have a chameleon motif, with chameleons on his shirt collar, ruana, and sandals.

===Powers and Abilities===
[[File:Camilo transformed into Bruno.gif|thumb|left|180x180px|Camilo shapeshifting into Bruno and returning to his original form.]]
Camilo has the power of shapeshifting; he can assume the form of any living person he has seen. When shape-shifting, his clothes shape-shift with him to match those of the person whose shape he is assuming. Camilo's control of his gift is quite refined, as he is able to shape-shift only certain parts of his body if he wishes so, alter the size of his forms, and can take on more exaggerated features.

Stress, shock, and pain will cause him to involuntarily and wildly shape-shift. When frightened by Bruno's vision, Camilo quickly transforms into Mirabel and Bruno, which soon followed by his mouth becomes lopsided and his eyes end up bulging and looking away from each other. When he is afraid or nervous, his head will turn into an infant's atop of his adolescent body and his arms turn small and skinny.

[[File:Camilo doing Parkour.gif|thumb|180x180px|Camilo's physical abilities combined with his gift allows him to dodge falling pieces from the house.]]
His power does have certain limits, such being only able to shape-shift to people and cannot shift into animals or objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479872938794897408|title=Camilo's Limits Part 2|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1482347784745324545|title=Animal shifting|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 15, 2022|access-date=January 15, 2022}}</ref> Camilo also cannot mimic traits beyond a physical level and turning into his magical family members does not give him their gifts. An example would be when Camilo shape-shifted into Bruno, he was able to copy Bruno's glowing green eyes (which happens when the real Bruno looks into the future). Even though Camilo can copy Bruno's glowing eyes, he cannot copy his uncle's ability to see into the future. If he turned into his Luisa, Camilo would only have her natural strength instead of her cousin's superhuman strength.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479858404118040576|title=Camilo's Limits Part 1|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1486343236905943043|title=No gift mimicry Part 1|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 26, 2022|access-date=January 26, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1489601451118653441|title=No gift mimicry Part 2|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=February 26, 2022|access-date=February 26, 2022}}</ref>

Camilo also has good agility and speed, demonstrated when he used his gift to become children and adults to slide, jump, and run through the falling pieces of the house. While his voice can also change to match the person his shape-shift into, Camilo can naturally do vocal impressions well after a lot of practicing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479855826764328960|title=Camilo's Vocal Changes|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Encanto]]''===
[[File:Camilo helping in the village.png|thumb|left|180x180px|Camilo offering assistance to an overwhelmed mother.]]
Camilo first appeared getting ready for the day and heading to the village with the rest of his family to help around. In "[[The Family Madrigal]]," Camilo was seen dancing along with the rest of his family and offering a young mother a pillow so she can catch some sleep while he cares for her infant child. Since the day was also his younger brother's, [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]], fifth birthday and gift ceremony, Camilo soon returned home to help prepare for the celebration. While preparing Antonio's gift ceremony, [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]] saw Camilo leaning lazily against a bannister and instructed him to help a townsperson named Jose with a banner over Antonio's door, to which Camilo obediently turns into José to help. By nightfall and before Antonio's ceremony was about to begin, Camilo along with [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] were given the task of greeting the guests to the [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]], used his gift to transform into them before heading inside. 

[[File:Félix, Pepa, Dolores and Camilo cheering on Antonio.png|thumb|180x180px|Camilo cheering his little brother Antonio on before his gift ceremony begins.]]
Later Camilo joined his family to greet Antonio and give him some encouragement to relax. Camilo playfully turned a miniature version of his father and mocked his way speaking, which brought a smile to his younger brother's face. When [[Dolores Madrigal|Dolores]] informed them that Antonio's gift ceremony would begin shortly, the family departed to wait in their designated places, [[Félix Madrigal|Félix]] ushered everyone out and Camilo once again imitated him, causing Félix to grab him by the shoulders and haul him out, with Camilo quickly stating that he was done imitating him. After being yanked out, Camilo joined her other relatives to watch Antonio's ceremony and he clasped his aunt [[Julieta Madrigal|Julieta]]'s hand as he watched [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] escort Antonio to his new door. Camilo loudly cheered when his brother got his gift and snapped his fingers in excitement when Antonio rode his jaguar into his new room. As the party moved into Antonio's magical bedroom, Camilo was in awe at the sight and took a family picture, which everyone unknowingly excluded Mirabel from. While enjoying the food and talking with Julieta, Camilo and everyone else heard from a panicked Mirabel that there were cracks in the Casita. When everyone came to investigate, the cracks weren't there and Alma ushered everyone back to the party.

[[File:Camilo singing his version of Bruno.png|thumb|left|180x180px|Camilo singing his version of Bruno as a scary and evil monster with rats on his back.]]
The next morning, Camilo turned into Dolores to steal a second serving of breakfast and was confronted by Mirabel, who was trying to get information about the fading magic from Dolores. Camilo stood silent as his cousin rambled on until Felix popped in and scolded to Camilo for turning into his sister to get more food. Camilo reverted back into his own form and was whacked by Casita's nearby window panel for his trick, which he took in good stride. As the family started eating, he listed with a mischievous smile to Alma's announcement regarding [[Mariano Guzmán]]'s proposal to [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]] that would take place that night. Sitting next to Isabela, after Alma finished speaking, Camilo shapeshifts into Mariano and made kissy faces to tease her, which she responded by flicking flowers into his mouth. When breakfast concludes, Camilo joins everyone in the family chant "La Familia Madrigal" before returning to her daily activities. Later, Camilo joined his family in "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]" after Dolores' verse to telling Mirabel about their estranged, missing uncle Bruno. Having no real memories of his uncle, due to him leaving when he was five, Camilo choose to dramatize his uncle to Mirabel as a boogeyman-like figure for fun. In his verses he describes his uncle in a negative way similar to his parents by shapeshifting into a version of Bruno with shining green eyes, with an evil grin and surrounded by rats, moving in sinister ways.

[[File:Camilo whispering to his father.png|thumb|180x180px|Camilo telling his father about Bruno's vision.]]
After assisting his family for the Guzmáns' arrival, Camilo joined the dinner table and soon heard from Dolores that Mirabel was in Bruno's vision that foretold that the magic was disappearing. Shocked by this news, Camilo choke on his food and rapidly shifted into Bruno and Mirabel before returning into his own form with bungled face. After straightening his features, Camilo whispered to his father Mirabel's secret, making Félix spit out his drink, which Camilo replies with a bashful smile. As the atmosphere became more awkward, the rest of the family found out Bruno's vision too and cracks started to appeared in the dining room. As everyone panicked and Pepa started forming a thundercloud, Camilo dunk his head down from ensuing chaos until his powers started to fritz and turned his head into an infant's due to fear. After the Guzmáns left, Camilo regained his composure and focus on trying to calm his anxious mother in her room. While he gently attempted to serve Pepa tea, but Mirabel (who was running between the walls of the house at the time) startled Pepa into accidentally zapping Camilo with lightning, which lead into a series of injuries for the teenager as he widely transformed into his family members.

[[File:Casita saving Camilo.gif|thumb|left|180x180px|Camilo being saved by Casita while trying to get to the magic candle.]]
In the morning, Camilo went looking for Mirabel since she been missing since last night. While looked around the courtyard, Camilo's gift acted up again and he involuntary turned his head into a baby's, much to his annoyance. Unknown to Camilo, Mirabel and Bruno witnessed this event from the second floor, which they took as sign the magic was dangerously close to disappearing forever. Later that same day, Camilo and the rest family returned to courtyard to find Alma and Mirabel having a heated argument about Alma's unhealthy perfectionism. As the Casita started collapsing around them and the [[Miracle Candle]] about to fall from its window, Camilo joined Mirabel and Isabela in trying to retrieve the candle. As he weaved through the fallen debris with his gift, Camilo jumped up off a railing to reach a high ledge in a form of a tall person, but his gift faded before he could reach it. The Casita helped him break his fall by sticking out a railing for him to catch and land more safely on the ground. When he landed, Camilo looked in dismay at his hand and both he and Isabela realized that they had lost their magic. Casita then quickly pushed Camilo and the family out before it fully crumbled down, though Mirabel was able to reach the candle, but it ultimately blew out. Devastated by the lost of his home and his gift, Camilo sadly surveyed the ruins with the rest of his family and expressed concern over Antonio's wellbeing. When Julieta noticed Mirabel went missing, the Madrigals and the other townspeople spread out to search for her.

[[File:Camilo and Antonio.png|thumb|180x180px|Camilo is the only one of his siblings who is confused by the presence of Bruno.]]
By the next day, Camilo and the family saw that Mirabel and Alma (having made up with each other) returned to Casita's ruins, with Camilo interrupting the reunion to dryly remind the optimistic Agustín that the Madrigals were still homeless, much to his father's annoyance. During "[[All of You]]", Alma revealed to the entire family that Bruno hid behind the rubble and they immediately accepted him back into the family. While the adults were absolutely exhilarated, Camilo was the only person present confused by the presence of Bruno, especially when both Antonio and Dolores cheerfully revealed that they had known their uncle never actually left. With family all together, Mirabel rallied them to fix the house and the entire town also pitched in as thanks for all the Madrigals had done for them. While working on the repair of the house with the family, Mirabel handed Camilo a shovel that he tried to turn while she talked to Abuela but without success, making him embarrassed. After completing the house, Mirabel added a doorknob the family made just for her to the front door, which caused Casita to spring back to life, and the magic returned to the entire Encanto. The Madrigals then celebrated the returned of their home and gifts with a family picture. When they smiled for the picture, Camilo was pushed between Bruno and Félix when Casita squished the whole family closer together unexpectedly.

He was also initially going to be Mirabel's "arch-nemesis" and more antagonistic towards her, but the staff eventually shifted that dynamic to Isabela.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2020/12/09/exclusive-new-details-for-walt-disney-animation-studios-encanto/|title=Exclusive: New Details for Walt Disney Animation Studios’ ‘Encanto’|website=The Disinsider|last=Sharpe|first=Josh|date=December 9, 2020|access-date=July 8, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479866518678622214|title=Camilo's Early Concept|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref>
*Given his shapeshifting ability, Camilo's name serves as a pun for "chameleon".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1465136801815924740|title=Camilo's name|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=November 28, 2021|access-date=November 29, 2021}}</ref> Chameleons serves as Camilo's personal iconography, evident by the chameleons on his clothes, door, and Mirabel's dress.
**Camilo is also named after Camilo Gracia Escobar, who was the ''Encanto'' staff's tour guide in Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marketresearchtelecast.com/the-character-of-encanto-that-apparently-existed/213237/|title=The character of Encanto that apparently existed|website=Market Research Telecast|last=|first=MRT|date=November 27, 2021|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>
**The name Camilo means "temple servant", "freeborn", or "noble".
*For Camilo's magical door, [[Jared Bush]] stated it was "tricky" to visualize Camilo's shape-shift ability with a static image, therefore the three silhouettes were put on his door to represent his gift and the door's portrait of him isn't meant to be seen as his younger self.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1468217073968898050|title=Camilo's Door|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 7, 2021|access-date=December 8, 2021}}</ref>
*Although the staff decided to limit Camilo's shape-shifting ability to only people early in the production process, some concept art of Camilo in the ''[[The Art of Encanto]]'' depicts him turning to animals.<ref>[[The Art of Encanto]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1477636697764597765|title=Camilo's Ability|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 2, 2022|access-date=January 2, 2022}}</ref>
*During the ending credits, Camilo's magical door was the only one missing. Jared Bush stated that this was unintentional because they had too much artwork and needed to simplify it for the final production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1479865827797049345|title=Camilo's Door Credits|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 8, 2022|access-date=January 8, 2022}}</ref>
*In earlier versions of the film, Camilo's appearance would have changed after Casita fell; implying that he was hiding his true self. This was ultimately scrapped to focus on Mirabel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1505437494937939972|title=Camilo's appearance|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=March 20, 2022|access-date=March 23, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1484928881375150083|title=Scrapped Camilo's scene|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=January 22, 2022|access-date=March 23, 2022}}</ref>
*In the book ''Disney Encanto: A Tale of Three Sisters'', Camilo gets embarrassed by his parents showing affection in public, and gets annoyed with them for doing so.
