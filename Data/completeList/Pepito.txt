==Background==
Pepito is a three-eyed poisonous spider whom the boys found in the desert. When the boys first captured him, he requests him to get him out of the jar, though the boys found out that they want to bring him for show and tell. However, after the boys feed him dead flies, he agrees to keep his promise so thst he can be brought to show and tell just before receiving his freedom at the desert where the boys once found him.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Bug Hunt]]''===
Pepito first appears staring at two boys who caught a beetle for show and tell and during lunchtime just one of the boys Jimmy tells Aaron that there is a poisonous spider on his shoulder just as Aaron tells his companion to put the spider in the jar quickly before he gets poisoned to which Aaron launches Pepito in the jar Jimmy is holding (thus losing the beetle the two caught), to which the boys find the spider perfect for show and tell. As they arrive home, Pepito warns the boys to get him out of his jar immediately. As Pepito talks to the boys, Aaron asks him if he is poisonous to which Pepito himself agrees despite him not wanting to bite any predator. Jimmy asks him to hold him to which he agrees only if he could give him dead flies as food. After the boys feed him dead flies, Jimmy asks him if he can hold him to which he agrees though gentle. Before planning to set him free, the boys plan to take Pepito to show and tell at school and before the boys can take him to it, he asks them to set him free and then he would meet the boys the next day so that they can meet him at the desert where they found him and so that they can bring him to show and tell. The next day, Pepito kept his promise and he was a big hit at show and tell at school just after that, Pepito is set free at the desert where the boys once found him as the boys Jimmy and Aaron search for new friends.

==Trivia==
*Peptio makes a small cameo in ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', during "[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]" while [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] were trying to use a spider to scare away [[Nala]], but falls in love with a girl spider and makes a heart-shaped web (with Timon getting caught in it).
