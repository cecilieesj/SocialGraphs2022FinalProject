'''Clovis''' is an antagonist in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode "[[Darkly Dawns the Duck]]".

==History==
She was [[Taurus Bulba|Taurus Bulba's]] secretary and personal pilot, who was arguably the only intelligent person he had working for him. When Bulba's airship was zapped by the anti-gravity beam of the malfunctioning Waddlemeyer [[Ramrod]] and splashed down into Audubon Bay, Clovis escaped by jumping out and parachuting to safety, reflecting the fact that her mother had wanted her to be a dental hygienist.

==Trivia==
*In the comic book adaptation, Clovis is strongly implied to have been killed when she self-destructs the airship on Bulba's orders.
*Clovis shares the same late voice actress as Mrs. Cavanaugh, [[Marcia Wallace]].
*In "[[Hot Spells]]", Clovis has a cameo in the line of the damned.
