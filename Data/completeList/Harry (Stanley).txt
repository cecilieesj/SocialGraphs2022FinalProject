==History==
He is an obese brown bulldog whoÂ associates with his fellow pet companion, [[Elsie]], with whom he sings the theme for "[[The Great Big Book of Everything (song)|The Great Big Book of Everything]]" in every episode. He often refers to the others as "dude" and sometimes acts slightly dim-witted. An example is when Harry realizes how well he gets along with Elsie, her being a cat, he surprisingly states that he thought she was a Chihuahua.

==Trivia==
*He is one of the few Disney characters to commit malapropisms, the other three being [[Toon Patrol#Smartass|Smarty]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'', and [[Tigger]] from ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]''.
