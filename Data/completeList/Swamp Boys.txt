}}The '''Swamp Boys''' are a music group comprised of a trio of alligators (one playing a guitar, one playing a banjo and one playing an accordion) and a harmonica-playing raccoon.

== History ==

=== Development History ===
The Swamp Boys are three anthropomorphic alligator characters created for the now defunct attraction, [[America Sings]] in [[Disneyland]].  When America Sings closed in 1988, their animatronics were moved to the new attraction [[Splash Mountain]]. They appear in the finale scene in all 3 versions of the ride.  Following Splash Mountain's announced closure due to the ride's [[Song of the South|history of racism]], it is unknown what the fate of the Swamp Boys will be.

==Appearances==

=== America Sings ===
They first appeared in the Going South sequence of Disneyland's America Sings attraction, where they performed "Polly Wolly Doodle". As the gators sing together, bullfrogs join in the chorus followed by a raccoon using a harmonica just before the song loops into a song showcasing a mother opossum singing the song, "I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again".

=== Splash Mountain ===
The Swamp Boys appeared in the grand finale of Splash Mountain off to the side, playing their instruments and singing ''[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]''.  In [[Walt Disney World]], a poster in the queue of the attraction advertised the Swamp Boys as a band with the tag-line of, "If you're lookin' for music that won't bog you down".

=== Parades ===
Two of the Swamp Boys are said to be featured in Tokyo Disneyland's Dreams on Parade: Moving On as walk around characters.

== Other Appearances ==

=== [[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]] ===
The alligators also appear in ''Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two'' as an animatronic jugband in [[Bog Easy]].

===''[[Play Disney Parks App]]''===
The Swamp Boys alligators appear in the "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah Day" mini-game on the Play Disney Parks app.

== Trivia ==
* In America Sings, the Swamp Boys appeared alongside a racoon which was moved to the ''[[How Do You Do?|How Do You Do]]'' scenes for the [[Walt Disney World]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] versions, but appears in the finale of the [[Disneyland]] version.
