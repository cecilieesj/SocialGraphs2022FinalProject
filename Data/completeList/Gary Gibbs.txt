'''Gary Gibbs''' is a minor antagonist in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated series, ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Gary is an egotistical, smooth-talking, quick-witted monster. He, in many ways, shares some similarities to his rival [[Mike Wazowski]]. Both of them make jokes and tend to talk their way in and out of situations. The only difference is that Gary seems much better at it than Mike as he is able to gain [[Roze]]'s favor. However, he hates to lose and will genuinely become cross at the thought of getting bested by Mike.

===Physical appearance===
Gary resembles an almost exact mirror image of Mike. The major difference is that he is blue, has small black nubs as horns and has a brown eye. One minor difference is that he is slightly smaller than Mike.

==Trivia==
*Gary Gibbs is named after late Pixar animator [[Rob Gibbs]] (father of [[Mary Gibbs]], voice of [[Boo]]). The first episode he appeared in, "[[The Big Wazowskis]]", is dedicated to him.
