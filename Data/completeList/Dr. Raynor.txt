Dr. Raynor was formerly a soldier, and during her time in that occupation, she saw alot of dead bodies. She also did field operations with [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]]. As a therapist, she becomes assigned to [[Bucky Barnes|James Barnes]] as a patient, and the pair met up regularly. During one of their sessions, Bucky creates a list of amends, filled with names, and Dr. Raynor creates three rules for him; he can't perform any illegal activities, no one can get hurt and he must demonstrate his new way of life in recovery.

In an appointment, she asks if he's having nightmares, and notices he's lying to her. She questions if anything happened to him today and reminds him he's a civilian now. She explains it's a condition of his pardon, and asks about his recent nightmare, but he denies having one, so she makes a note in her pad. He questions why she needs to take note, and she replies that if he doesn't talk, she'll write. He reveals that he crossed a name of his list of amends today; that of Senator Atwood, using the three rules. She asks whether it helped with the nightmares, but he again denies having any. She states that he'll have to eventually open up, and people can be trusted. She takes a look at his phone and notes he doesn't even have ten contacts, and has been ignoring texts from [[Sam Wilson]]. She reminds him to nurture his friendships and comments on how sad it is that she's the only person he's called all week. She begins to explain why, but Bucky makes a sarcastic remark, and Dr. Raynor jots down a note in her pad. He discloses how he never had a chance to process everything, having gone from one fight to another, in ninety years. She questions what he wants, now that he's stopped fighting, and he replies that he wants peace. Dr. Raynor calls bull on his answer, reminding him she was a soldier who saw alot of dead bodies, and understands how it can shut a person down. She mentions the aspects of his life that are going well, and tells him he's free, though Bucky questions to do with that freedom.

When Bucky is arrested for missing one his court-mandated therapy sessions, Dr. Raynor heads there for him. She introduces herself to Sam Wilson, and the pair find John Walker, to also be present at the scene. He informs her that Bucky will not be following a strict schedule any longer, but she tells him their work is not finished, and questions who authorized this. Walker signals himself and tells her, Bucky is too valuable an asset to be tied up, so he should be sent his way, after Christina is done with him. She orders an immediate session with Bucky and has Sam attend too. Sam protests that his attendance is unnecessary, and ridiculous, to which Bucky also agrees with, and Dr. Raynor points out they're agreeing already. She asks who wants to go first, and when no one volunteers, she has them perform an excessive in which they imagine a miracle occurs while they sleep, and questions what they would like to see that would make their life better. Bucky states that in his miracle, Sam would talk less, and Sam argues back that he too had the same thought. Dr. Raynor then proceeds for them to perform a soul-gazing exercise, in which they make direct eye contact with each other, but quickly grows annoyed when the pair turn it into a staring contest. She asks Bucky what about Sam aggravates him, and the pair begin discussing the ramifications of Sam giving up [[Captain America's Shield|Captain America's shield]]. Sam eventually argues that they don't have time for this, and leaves, thanking her for making the situation awkward. She thanks him return as he leaves, and sarcastically comments on how great that was. Before Bucky leaves, she recognizes the expression on his face and questions whats wrong. He asks her what rule number two was again, and she reminds him it's to not hurt anyone. He then says his goodbyes, and leaves.
