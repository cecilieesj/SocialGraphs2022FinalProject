==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Ciela is a pink Jaquin with darker pink swirls in her pattern. She has some light blue feathers and her eyes are teal, with some green. She has a white underbelly.

===Personality===
Ciela is sweet, but can be sassy at times. She sometimes feels the need to protect Avion, putting her wing over him when Troyo comes. When Skylar and Nico refuse to leave the Noblins, she takes charge and decides that she and Avion will find Avalor City on their own. When she and Elena, Migs, Luna, and Avion are locked in Troyo's trap, she apologizes for going off with Troyo, even though it wasn't her fault.

==Role in the [[Elena of Avalor|series]]==
Ciela appears in "[[Flight of the Jaquins]]" when she arrives from Vallestrella, the Jaquins' home realm, with [[Avión]] and [[Nico]]. When she meets Skylar, she recognizes him as [[the King of Vallestrella]]'s son. On the way to Avalor City, they spot Pueblo De Oro, the home of the Noblins. After Skylar explains that the Noblins are magical shapeshifters who have the Golden Touch, Nico insists they go over to meet the Noblins. Upon arriving, Skylar and Nico instantly get distracted with playing with the Noblins to the annoyance of Ciela, who fears they will be late. Eventually Ciela decides to go to Avalor City on her own and takes Avion with her. They run into [[Troyo]] the magical coyote who she learns too late is an enemy of the Jaquins after he ensnares them in a trap. When [[Princess Elena]], Migs, and Luna fall into the trap, she apologizes for going with a stranger and is relieved when Skylar and Nico free them.
