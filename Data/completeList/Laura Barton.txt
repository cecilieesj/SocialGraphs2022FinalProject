'''Laura Barton''' (also known as '''Agent 19''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and ''[[Hawkeye (series)|Hawkeye]]''. She is played by [[Linda Cardellini]].

Laura Barton was created by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch.

==Background==
In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Laura is a former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent and the wife of [[Hawkeye|Clint Barton/Hawkeye]]. She is kind, gentle, friendly and supportive. She lives at the Barton Family Farm with her (and Clint's) children, [[Cooper Barton|Cooper]] and [[Lila Barton]]. Later, she gives birth to a third offspring, [[Nathaniel Barton|Nathaniel Pietro Barton]], named after [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow]] and [[Quicksilver|Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver]].

Laura and her family are not in any goverment files, which is why the Barton Family Farm is used by [[Avengers|the Avengers]] as a place to hide and lay low.

In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Laura and her family have a picnic outside their house with her making hot dogs. Laura, alongside half of all life in the universe, later died at the hands of an [[Infinity Gauntlet]]-wielding Thanos; but was restored to life 5 years later, when the [[Hulk]] used the [[Infinity Stones]] that him and the Avengers retrieved from alternate timelines, to undo [[Thanos]]' work.

==Trivia==
*She was killed by [[Black Widow]] in the comics.
*In the season finale of ''Hawkeye'', Laura is revealed to be former S.H.I.E.L.D agent with codename "Agent 19," which is a reference to the codename the superheroine Mockingbird used in [[Marvel Comics]].
**The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has established another character, based on [[Mockingbird]] in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.
