'''The Fearsome Five''' is a group of five of the main antagonists from the television series ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.

The group is composed of [[Negaduck]], [[Megavolt]], [[Bushroot]], [[Quackerjack]], and [[Liquidator]].

In the episode "[[Life, the Negaverse, and Everything]]", Darkwing meets the group's [[Negaverse]] counterparts, called "The Friendly Four" (minus Negaduck), who perform good deeds rather than partake in villainy.

In the episode "[[Jail Bird]]", Negaduck used the Mystic Eye Jewel to steal all the other members powers.

The team appears in [[DuckTales (2017 series)|the 2017 ''DuckTales'' series]]. The team is composed of Liquidator, Bushroot, Quackerjack, Megavolt and [[Taurus Bulba]].

==Trivia==
* The Fearsome Five are an homage to various supervillain teams such as the [[The Sinister Six|Sinister Six]] (comprised of six of Spiderman's enemies) and the Rogues (a varying roster of the Flash's enemies).
* [[Tad Stones]] has stated that he regrets making Negaduck the leader because he would often end up overshadowing the other members, and that if done again, he would've instead put [[Splatter Phoenix]] in the group.<ref>[https://twitter.com/TadStones/status/1170542051579973639 Tweet by Tad Stones]</ref>
