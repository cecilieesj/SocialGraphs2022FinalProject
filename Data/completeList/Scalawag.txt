The '''Scalawag''' (also known as the '''Pirate With Pigs''') is a character from the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] attraction at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==
===Background===
This man was a pirate who served as a crewman of the ''[[Wicked Wench]]''. During his lifetime, he became a pirate and joined the crew of the aforementioned ship led by the [[Blackbeard|Pirate Captain]] who raided [[Isla Tesoro]], which led to a successful invasion on the island, leading it to be occupied by pirates. After the battle, the Scalawag was found sleeping with pigs.

===Development History===
The Scalawag is one of the characters created for the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] attraction which first opened at [[Disneyland]] in [[1967]]. He was displayed in the [[Isla Tesoro]] scene with the other pirates and has remained in this area ever since.

Due to the success of the attraction at [[Disneyland]], the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]], still featuring the pirate sleeping with the pigs in it.

==Appearances==

===[[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]===
In most versions of the attraction, the Scalawag is seen during the "[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]]" sequence where he would be seen sleeping with a few pigs just before passing through a prison scene depicting a [[Seedy Prisoners|group of prisoners]] with a [[Prison Dog|dog]] inside it. The pigs are also heard oinking to the song's rhythm. However, in the Disneyland Paris version, he is encountered in the scene before the last drop leading to [[Dead Man's Cove]].

===Other appearances===
In the discontinued ''[[Disney Crossy Road]]'', the Scalawag appears in this game under the name "Pirate With Pigs". He was unlockable either through purchase of ''Disney Crossy Road'' figurines via scanning or through Prize Machine simultaneously. Playing as the character did not add any changes throughout the entire game in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' hub.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', the scene featuring [[Joshamee Gibbs]] sleeping with a few pigs in [[Tortuga]] is an homage to the character from the original attraction as the film series themselves feature elements from the original attraction itself. However, the Scalawag himself has not yet made a physical appearance in the film series or other media inspired by it. This scene was also homaged in the non-canonical ''[[LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game]]'' in the "Tortuga" level.
*The term "scalawag" is used as a colloquial term to refer to a misbehaving person behaving in a mischievous way.
*Despite not having a name, the character was named "Scalawag" in the Pirates of the Caribbean toy line by Hasbro released in [[2006]].
*His appearance in ''Disney Crossy Road'' has a striking resemblance to that of [[Jacoby]], a character from ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' in which the film itself is based on the original attraction. The only difference is the red cap on his head, which looks bigger.
