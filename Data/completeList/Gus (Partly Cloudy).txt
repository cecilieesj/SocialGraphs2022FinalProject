He is a cloud who, like the other clouds, is supposed to create different babies, but unlike the other clouds, he is forced with the task of creating the "dangerous" babies, such as alligators and porcupines. [[Peck]], a stork who delivers the babies Gus creates, faces many trials in delivering Gus's creations, but continues doing his job, anyway because of their friendship.

==Background==
Despite his duty as a storm cloud, Gus is shown to be kind to Peck at first by giving him babies, which turn out to be dangerous animals. Humiliated from all the injuries, Peck decides to get help, leaving the baby shark unfinished, upsetting Gus. Whenever he feels emotional and upset, he makes loud lightning flashes to symbolize anger and rain to symbolize him crying. Despite this, he still cares for Peck, even when he's wearing protective armor to protect himself from dangerous animals.

==Role in the short film==
Gus is first seen creating a baby alligator which is ready to be delivered to its parents in which Peck, the stork, arrives toward him. Peck asks him to know if he has a baby to deliver, in which Gus gives him the alligator in which it starts attacking him with its jaws as Gus gives him a bag to deliver the alligator to its parents. Gus then later creates a baby ram after Peck arrives toward him again in which the baby ram begins hitting him with its horns as Peck then discovers another cloud playing with a puppy that she created. Peck then decides to deliver the baby ram to its parents as he successfully does so, albeit the ram hitting him.

Meanwhile, Gus then creates a baby porcupine and suddenly gets quills all over him as Peck delivers the baby porcupine to its parents. That evening, Gus then shows a baby shark in its cloud form toward Peck after delivering the porcupine to its parents. Scared of the shark, Peck then decides to go to a safer cloud to get help to avoid getting many injuries from the dangerous baby animals. Peck then decides not to accept the shark from him, leaving the shark unfinished. Gus, upset and lonely, cries with no one arriving to receive baby animals from him until Peck arrives with some football equipment to protect himself from injuries. Happy that he is back again, Gus then creates a baby electric eel as he is finally happy to have Peck back with him wearing football equipment, still with the eel electrocuting him.

==Trivia==
*[[Peter Sohn]], the director of Partly Cloudy, said he based Gus partly on himself and Peck, after his mother.
