'''John Jameson''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and supervillain. He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and an astronaut for N.A.S.A. The reason why is being due to his estranged relationship with his father like in the Marvel Comics. However, the discovery of the Godstone during a space expedition causes him to transform into the lycanthropic '''Man-Wolf'''. He debuts in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Man-Wolf".

Man-Wolf was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
In his human form, John Jameson is a Caucasian man with blond hair. In his Man-Wolf form, he looks like a classic werewolf covered in white fur with an armor and wields a sword.

===Powers and abilities===
As the Man-Wolf, John Jameson has incredible speed, strength, and senses.  He has razor sharp claws, and a sword. In addition, he can allude Spider-Man's Spider sense, breath in space, and absorb energy.

==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
Spider-Man's team and S.H.I.E.L.D. answer a distress signal coming from J. Jonah Jameson to look for John Jameson on the moon, where John was supervising the construction of a Daily Bugle communications station. Onsite, however, the construction crew found the remains of an advanced civilization harboring a number of strange jewels, one of which embedded itself in John's chest and triggered his transformation into the feral Man-Wolf (with the trappings and the sword used by Stargod). Spider-Man manages to shatter the jewel, but the sudden reversion causes John to retain some wolf-like appearance and features, whereupon he is kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody for treatment.

===''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''===
In the episode "Osborn Academy", John Jameson is among the people that audition for a spot in Osborn Academy where he shows his space program knowledge. In the episode "Halloween Moon", John Jameson and Harry Osborn worked on an experiment that involved a lunar crystal that fed off gamma radiation which turned John Jameson into Man-Wolf whose scratch turned those who were struck by Man-Wolf's claws into werewolves. It took Spider-Man, Hulk, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn to undo the effects of the Man-Wolf transformations and cure the infected. While Norman Osborn was displeased that he got Harry involved upon being given the lunar crystal, John Jameson stated the Man-Wolf form had a different personality as Norman Osborn plans to find a way to fix the lunar crystal's effects.
