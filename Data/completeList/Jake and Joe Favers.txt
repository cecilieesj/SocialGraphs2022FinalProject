==History==
Jake Faver is the younger of the two and apparent leader. Seeing that he is more intelligent that his dimwitted older brother, he seems to be the human representation of [[Br'er Fox]].

Joe Faver is the eldest brother who seems to be a minion of his younger brother given his dimwitted, clueless nature, he seems to be a human representation of [[Br'er Bear]].

Their sister, whom they hate and bully, is [[Ginny Favers]]. Jake usually wears a short-sleeved shirt and dungarees and Joe usually wears a long-sleeved shirt and trousers. They are both usually seen barefoot.
