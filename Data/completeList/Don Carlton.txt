'''Don Carlton''' is one of the tritagonists of the [[2013]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Monsters University]]''. A student at [[Monsters University (institution)|Monsters University]], he is a member of the [[Oozma Kappa]] fraternity, serving as its president. According to director [[Dan Scanlon]], he is a "mature student returning to college to follow a dream to study scaring".<ref>[http://pixartimes.com/2013/02/12/new-monsters-university-characters-revealed-sean-hayes-and-charlie-day-join-cast/ New ‘Monsters University’ Characters Revealed, Sean Hayes and Charlie Day Join Cast]</ref>

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Faced with the realities of the economic downturn, Midwestern sales monster Don Carlton finds himself going back to school to learn new skills and pursue a dream career in Scaring. One of Monsters University’s “mature” students and a founding member of the Oozma Kappa fraternity, Don brings his honest hardworking spirit to their endeavors, ensuring that his fellow brothers keep their various heads on straight and their array of eyes on the task at hands.''<ref>[http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/monsters-university-character-posters/ New Character Posters – Meet the Monsters of Monsters University]</ref>
==Role in the film==
He is a member of Oozma Kappa.

In the simulation room during the final round of the Scare Games, Don uses his tentacles to sneak on top of the ceiling to scare the child. He is devastated when they learn that Sulley cheated so they leave the undeserved trophy to him. When Mike goes to the human world to prove that he is scary, Don distracts Hardscrabble and the security guards with his sales, only for Hardscrabble to order the guards to arrest him. While he's being pinned, Sulley uses the distraction to access the human world to save Mike.

He has romantic feelings for [[Sheri Squibbles]] and eventually gets engaged to her, much to Squishy's disgust. At the end of the film, Don becomes a Scarer at [[Monsters, Inc.]], along with his Oozma Kappa brothers.

==Trivia==
*Don's business card lists his address as 1200 Dark Ave. [[Pixar]]'s Emeryville address is 1200 Park Ave.
*In some behind the scenes images of ''Monsters University'', it can be noticed that Don Carlton was meant to be light green with darker green spots.
*A small bit of his appearance strikes quite a remarkable resemblance to that of Disney animator [[Eric Goldberg]].<ref>[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-monsters-university-fun-facts-hires-stills-concept-art-62070/ ‘Monsters University’ Fun Facts, New Hi-Res Stills, Concept Art]</ref>
