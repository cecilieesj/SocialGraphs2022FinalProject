{{Quote|I dub you Pinocchio's conscience, lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of high temptation, and guide along the straight and narrow path. Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.|The [[Blue Fairy]]|Pinocchio (film)}}
'''Jiminy Cricket''' is the deuteragonist of the [[1940]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''. He is a wisecracking, anthropomorphic cricket that is depicted donning a top hat and tailcoat, with an umbrella always on his person. Jiminy was appointed [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]]'s official conscience by the [[Blue Fairy]], in hopes that Jiminy can guide Pinocchio on his journey to become a real boy.

Notable for being the original performer of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" (which would become the trademark anthem for [[The Walt Disney Company]]), Jiminy has appeared alongside [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Tinker Bell]] as a company mascot throughout the years.

==Background==
===Development===
Jiminy is based on the Talking Cricket from the original Pinocchio book that Walt Disney's film is based on. In the book, the cricket tries to lecture Pinocchio about his bad behavior, only to be killed with a hammer for his efforts by Pinocchio, and then come back as an equally preachy ghost. However in the film, the cricket is named Jiminy and instead of being a cameo character, he was made into a major character and joins Pinocchio on his journey to becoming a real boy. According to [[Walt Disney]] and the filmmakers, Jiminy's role in the film was meant to develop the heart of the story in the friendship between him and Pinocchio. Jiminy was animated by one of [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Walt Disney's Nine Old Men]], [[Ward Kimball]]. In ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Ward animated a scene where the dwarves were [[Music in Your Soup|eating soup]]. Despite spending eight months animating the scene, it was eventually dropped as it was viewed as unnecessary, and Ward was devastated. Walt realized this and decided to give Ward the job of designing and animating Jiminy Cricket out of sympathy. Like every animated Disney character, Jiminy went through an evolution of designs. Some of the earliest ones resembled more of a realistic cricket. According to Ward, this was a disgusting sight, so he made the character more and more of a cartoonish and sweet-looking creature to the point that the audience only knows he's a cricket because the film says so.

Jiminy's name is derived from "'''Jiminy cricket(s)!'''", a {{WikipediaLink|minced oath|polite expletive euphemism}} for Jesus Christ. The name of the character is a play on the exclamation (which itself was uttered in Pinocchio's immediate predecessor, 1937's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''). Another example occurs in the 1939 film ''{{WikipediaLink|The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz}}'' when the group first enters the Wizard's chamber. Dorothy submissively starts to introduce herself, but is interrupted by the Wizard roaring "Silence, whippersnapper!" and producing smoke and huge flames. She is very frightened and quickly retreats, saying "Jiminy crickets!" (Garland also says the expression in her 1938 film ''{{WikipediaLink|Listen, Darling}}''). It had also been used as an exclamation by the Swedish father several times in the 1930 film ''{{WikipediaLink|Anna Christie (1930 English-language film)|Anna Christie}}''. Another time it is used is in the short 1938 cartoon starring Mickey Mouse ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]''. That expression is also {{WikipediaLink|Howard Cunningham}}'s catchphrase on ''{{WikipediaLink|Happy Days}}''. It was also used in later media including ''[[House of Mouse]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', and ''[[Up]]''.

===Personality===
As an official conscience, Jiminy is famously known as a level-headed and wise figure, capable of leading Pinocchio down a righteous path. At the start, and throughout most of the 1940 animated film, however, this is not exactly the case. Instead, Jiminy is introduced as a wisecracking, feisty, yet generally humble, realist who believed very little in magic and "wishing upon stars". When introduced, he admits that his past-self initially had little faith in the idea of dreams coming true; upon hearing [[Geppetto]]'s dream to someday have Pinocchio become a real boy, Jiminy comments, "A very lovely thought, but not at all practical." It is also hinted that Jiminy once saw the world as a troubled place, at one point exclaiming that "a conscience is that still, small voice that people won't listen to. That's the trouble with the world, today..."

In contrast to this, he is also fairly quirky and fun-loving, as he engages in conversation with inanimate objects when wanting to chat (such as Geppetto's porcelain figures), and even goes as far as to comedically flirt with the figurines designed with a feminine mold. He also has class, despite his hermit background, and tries to carry himself with a sense of style and flair.

As mentioned, Jiminy was not always as sage and devoted as he is portrayed today. He was appointed Pinocchio's conscience due to being too flustered by the [[Blue Fairy]]'s beauty to refuse the offer, thus lacking any real skill in serving as a guide or caretaker. He made a legitimate effort to act as cicerone to Pinocchio, but was somewhat high-strung due to pressure, and became easily frustrated with Pinocchio's innocently uncooperative nature; so much so, that he outright abandoned the puppet out of fury on two occasions. He was also doubtful in his own worth; after Pinocchio becomes a successful actor, despite Jiminy's disapproval, Jiminy felt inadequate and left Pinocchio with the belief that an actor would want nothing to do with a conscience.

However, Jiminy's loving heart gave him the strength to eventually grow and develop, not withstanding his shortcomings (very much in tandem with Pinocchio, himself). Towards the end of the film, after facing and escaping peril prior, Jiminy came to view Pinocchio as his best friend and genuinely wanted him to achieve his goal of becoming a real boy. After previously leaving Pinocchio on his own sanction, Jiminy was offered the chance to avoid any further danger during the climax. His strengthened loyalty and care towards Pinocchio, however, motivated him to finally remain by the puppet's side through the harshest endeavors, and against their [[Monstro|greatest adversary]] yet.

Much like Pinocchio, Jiminy is amply rewarded for his growth and self-discovery throughout the former's journey, by becoming an official conscience (recognized by a solid gold badge, as requested). His portrayal in subsequent animated appearances shows that Jiminy has since continued to grow with age and experience, typically presenting himself with a mild-mannered, soft-spoken aura.

===Family===
According to the [[1956]] TV special, ''[[On Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends]]'', Wilbur the Grasshopper, who made his first appearance in the [[1939]] ''Goofy'', short ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'', is Jiminy Cricket's nephew. In ''The Giant Walt Disney Word Book'' (1972), Jiminy Cricket's family tree was published as a two-page illustration. The poster showed Jiminy's parents and siblings and all the Cricket family generations up to Jiminy's great-great-grandfather.

===Physical appearance===
Jiminy is an anthropomorphic, pale green cricket with black eyes and two "hairs" on the top of his head that resemble the antennae of real-life insects. In his initial appearance in "Pinocchio" before being appointed as Pinocchio's conscience, he is a vagabond, wearing a shabby green overcoat with a patch on each elbow over a light olive sweater-shirt with a high white collar, a red scarf with a stripe at each end, tattered light beige pants with a patch on the bottom, tattered white gloves, and well-worn brown shoes whose toes are broken open, over which are tan spats. He also sports a grayish-blue top hat that is slightly bent, patched, and busted open at the top. He additionally carries a purple umbrella and a light blue floral carpet bag.

Jiminy's signature outfit, which is gifted to him by the Blue Fairy and which is worn in his main appearance from the beginning until the end of the film, consists of a black velvet tailcoat, a reddish-orange waistcoat with a single lighter button, a yellow cravat, a tan shirt with a high white collar, white shirtsleeve cuffs, off-white gloves, light beige pants, white socks with gray toes and heel, and blue shoes with yellow spats. He also has a blue top hat with a gold band and a red umbrella with a gold handle and tip. 

In the ''Walt Disney Anthology'' series, Jiminy retains his main appearance only his vest became teal with a single blue button, his tie is red, his pants are white and his shoes are yellow with blue soles. Additionally, the band on his hat is red. 

==Appearances==

===''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''===
{{Quote|One night a long time ago… my travels took me to a quaint little village. It was a beautiful night. The stars were shining like diamonds high above the roofs of that sleepy old town. Pretty as a picture.|Jiminy beginning the story.}}
[[File:Finally now to get some sleep.jpg|left|thumb|242x242px|Jiminy Cricket ready to rest]]
The film ''Pinocchio'' marked Jiminy's debut. He is first seen singing "[[When You Wish Upon A Star]]" next to a book about Pinocchio. After a brief introduction to the viewers, he begins recounting the story of Pinocchio.

In the actual story, Jiminy is first seen in raggedy clothing, traveling through a village late one night. He eventually comes to [[Geppetto's Workshop]], which was the only sign of life as all the other houses and businesses were dark, indicating their residents were all asleep. He sneaks inside and warms himself by the fire while admiring Geppetto's work. Jiminy then observes as [[Geppetto]] finishes the [[Pinocchio (character)|puppet]] he has been working on. Jiminy overhears Geppetto's wish for the puppet to be a real boy, but brushes it off as impractical, though lovely. He later finds himself unable to sleep due to all the ticking from Geppetto's various cuckoo clocks as well as the snoring from Geppetto and his goldfish [[Figaro and Cleo|Cleo]] keeping him up until he tells to be quiet, and they comply. Jiminy later watches in amazement as the [[Blue Fairy]] brings Pinocchio to life. After a conversation with the fairy, Jiminy is appointed to be Pinocchio's conscience (and Jiminy's ragged clothes are changed into fine attire), as Pinocchio must prove himself worthy of being made a real boy. Jiminy then teaches Pinocchio to whistle so that Pinocchio can call him.

The next day, Jiminy oversleeps and rushes to find Pinocchio, who has been sent off to school by Geppetto. However, Pinocchio is instead encouraged to become an actor by [[Honest John]]. Despite Jiminy's counseling to go to school, Pinocchio becomes part of the show of [[Stromboli]]. Jiminy becomes angry, but starts to second guess himself when Pinocchio becomes popular and decides to leave believing Pinocchio doesn't need him anymore. When Jiminy decides to wish Pinocchio good luck, he discovers that Stromboli has locked Pinocchio in a birdcage. Jiminy attempts to crack the lock so they can escape, but fails (evidently because, according to him, the lock is "one of the older models"). The Blue Fairy later comes along and frees them, after teaching Pinocchio a lesson on lying when he lied to her, causing his nose to grow until it became like a tree branch, complete with a bird's nest and eggs.

Before the pair can reach home, Pinocchio is dragged by Honest John and Gideon to travel to [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]], said to be a land for boys by Honest John again. Jiminy manages to sneak on the stage wagon, but ends up separated from Pinocchio. Jiminy eventually finds Pinocchio in a pool hall, where he is smoking and drinking with [[Lampwick]]. Jiminy attempts to get Pinocchio to leave, but is insulted by Lampwick. Offended and fed up with Pinocchio refusing to listen to him, Jiminy leaves in a huff and attempts to go home. He discovers that boys who come to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys, and runs off to warn Pinocchio.

The two are able to leave by running over a path of rocks (which is the only way on the island that is not blocked off) and jumping into the sea, but not before the curse of Pleasure Island causes Pinocchio to grow a donkey tail and ears. Finally, at home, they learn via a message that Geppetto has gone searching for Pinocchio and was trapped by [[Monstro]]. Despite Jiminy essentially being live bait, he follows Pinocchio into the sea to search for Geppetto. However, he is separated from Pinocchio after Pinocchio is swallowed by Monstro. Jiminy is forced to find shelter in a bottle to avoid being eaten by the seagulls.

After Pinocchio and Geppetto escape, Jiminy is the one who discovers that Pinocchio has died as a result while saving Geppetto from Monstro, who tried to catch them resulting in his death when he smashed into the cliff wall. At Geppetto's workshop, he mourns Pinocchio's death alongside Geppetto, Cleo, and Figaro. However, the Blue Fairy, touched by Pinocchio's sacrifice, revives the puppet as a real boy, also curing him of the Coachman's curse. Just like the others, he is overjoyed when Pinocchio is revived as a real boy. He manages to step away from the party and thanks to the Blue Fairy for helping them. As recognition of his own contributions, the Blue Fairy rewards him with a solid gold badge declaring him an official conscience.

===''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''===
Jiminy essentially serves as the film's host and set-up for the two segments. He is shown exploring a house and comes across a record player and records [[Bongo]]. After that, Jiminy sees a party invitation from Luana Patten, who lives in the house "across the way". Joining the party are ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] and his dummies, Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd. He goes to the house and listens to Bergen telling the story of ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]''. In the end, Jiminy leaves the house and watches [[Willie the Giant]] heading straight to Hollywood, looking for [[Mickey Mouse]].

===''[[Walt Disney anthology series]]''===
[[File:Jiminy WDAS.jpg|thumb|250px|Jiminy in the ''Walt Disney anthology series''.]]
Jiminy hosts many Disney television specials. Most of which included those heavily centered on the animated characters, such as [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. Some specials include "[[On Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends]]", "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (animation)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]", and "[[From All of Us to All of You]]".
===''I'm No Fool'' and ''This is You''===
In the 1950s and 1960s, Jiminy Cricket appeared in three different series of educational films aimed at grade school-aged audiences. In the "I'm No Fool" series, he advised children how to steer clear of dangerous traffic, sharp objects, strangers, exposed electrical lines, and so forth. In each short, he sang the refrain:

''I'm no fool, no sirree!<br>I'm gonna live to be 33 (then 43, 53, etc., up to 103)<br>I play safe for you and me<br>'Cause I'm no fool!''

Jiminy is shown making use of a chalkboard to illustrate his lessons. Figuring prominently was "You", an idealized boy meant to represent the audience and show the safe methods, and the Common Ordinary Fool, who always demonstrated foolish and reckless methods.

The second series was called "This is You" (AKA "You Are a Human Animal"), which teaches about the human body. In each short, Jiminy sang the refrain:

''You are a human animal,<br>You are a very special breed,<br>For you are the only animal<br>Who can think, who can reason, who can read...''

The third series was called "The Nature of Things", which teaches about the animals of nature, similar to the "I'm No Fool" series. This series contains live-action footage from the [[True-Life Adventures]] series.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]''===
Jiminy played a role in the series; appearing in the animated opening during the "[[Mickey Mouse March]]" musical number, alongside [[Dumbo]] and [[Timothy Mouse]]. Additionally, in a recurring segment, he taught a generation how to spell e-n-c-y-c-l-o-p-e-d-i-a.

===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===
[[File:Mickey-jiminy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jiminy as [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]] in ''Mickey's Christmas Carol''.]]
Jiminy appeared in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as [[the Ghost of Christmas Past]]. (The badge given to him by the Blue Fairy at the end of ''Pinocchio'' marking him as an official conscience now declares him to be the Ghost of Christmas Past.) [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] is perplexed at his size, but Jiminy shoots back at him that if '''he''' were measured by his amount of kindness, "you'd be no bigger than a speck of dust!" Nevertheless, he shows Scrooge past Christmases of him (Scrooge): being at [[J. Thaddeus Toad|Fezziwig]]'s Christmas party, where he met Isabelle and the horrid memory where Scrooge put his money before his love, whom he never saw again. As Scrooge begs the minuscule ghost to take him away from these bad memories, Jiminy reminds Scrooge that "you fashioned these memories yourself." (It should be noted that Past was going to be portrayed by [[Merlin]] instead of him, as it was in the original audio recording that came out a few years prior to the special's release).

===''[[Mickey's Magical World]]''===
Jiminy demonstrated how Mickey got his magic started.

===''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]''===
Jiminy was occasionally a host of the ''Disney Sing Along Songs'' series of videos, beginning with [[1987]]'s ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: The Bare Necessities|The Bare Nessities]]''. He also hosts ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: Be Our Guest|Be Our Guest]]'', ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: Friend Like Me|Friend Like Me]]'', and ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: Circle of Life|Circle of Life]]''.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:140915.jpg|thumb|250px|Jiminy in the episode "Jiminy Cricket".]]
Jiminy was among the numerous Disney characters to appear in the television series ''[[House of Mouse]]'' and its direct-to-video compilation films. A running gag in the series involves [[Timon]] trying to eat him, but getting rescued by [[Pumbaa]], as one of the rules of the club is "No guests eating other guests."

In the episode "Timon and Pumbaa" when he hears Pumbaa's joke, he says "That joke is all in bad taste". He later appears on the stage to help Timon with his magic trick, but Timon eats him alive, but Pumbaa makes him release Jiminy which causes the audience to boo them.

Jiminy's most notable appearance is in the episode "[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]", where he quits being Pinocchio's conscience. At the beginning of the episode, Jiminy suggests that Pinocchio should not sit with [[Pain and Panic]], considering them a "bad influence". When Pain overhears this, he says a not-so-nice remark about Jiminy and involuntarily flicks him away. Later on, backstage, when Jiminy explains that he wants to quit being Pinocchio's conscience, Mickey feels bad for him and wishes that he could help — this results in the [[Blue Fairy]] unexpectedly showing up to grant Mickey his wish by making him Jiminy's new client. Mickey becomes annoyed by all this and he and Minnie concoct a plan to get Jiminy to leave him and return to Pinocchio (as Jimmy was changing Mickey too much; even forces him to dress and act like Pinocchio). The plan worked and Jiminy got on stage to teach valuable life lessons to various other characters such as [[Simba]], [[Aurora]], [[Mowgli]], and [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] (nearly all of them referencing plot points of their films). In the end, Jiminy and Pinocchio were finally reunited.

In "[[Dining Goofy]], he showed to be unamused with the fact that he was seated with [[Eeyore]] and fails to try cheering him up.

He also plays a prominent role in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse|Mickey's Magical Christmas]]'' as he helps Mickey find the true meaning of Christmas through the help of wishing upon a star to lift Donald's spirits.

===Other appearances===
Jiminy made a brief cameo in [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]]'s [[1988]] hit feature, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. He can be seen when [[Eddie Valiant]] first drives through [[Toontown]].

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 1x05 - That Still Small Voice - Jiminy Cricket.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jiminy in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
Jiminy (voiced by [[Raphael Sbarge]], and [[Adam Young (actor)|Adam Young]] as a child) is the son of unscrupulous con artists in the ABC television series. Disapproving his parents' treachery, he desires to live an honest life, but was too weak-willed to leave his family. Eventually, he receives a potion from [[Rumplestiltskin]] that will free Jiminy from his parents. However, he inadvertently gives the potion to a young couple, transforming the pair into puppets. He wishes on a star in the hopes that the couple will be transformed back, but the [[Blue Fairy]] appears and tells him she cannot undo Rumplestiltskin's work. Instead, he wishes to make things right, and she transforms him into a cricket so that he can be free from his parents and guide the couple's son [[Geppetto]] for as long as the boy lives. He later helps the dwarves confront [[Snow White]] about her mean-spirited behavior after she drinks a potion and forgets about her true love [[The Prince|Prince James]]. However, the confrontation drives her to want to kill [[the Evil Queen]]. He later tells James that the only way for her to remember James as if she remembers her true self. Much later, he is seen advising the residents of the [[Enchanted Forest]] against waging war with the Queen and urges them to find a more peaceful solution.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 2x10 - The Cricket Game - Photography - Archie Hopper.png|thumb|250px|Archie Hopper; Jiminy's Storybrooke counterpart.]]
In [[Storybrooke]], he is '''Dr. Archie Hopper''', the town's psychotherapist. He owns a Dalmatian named [[Pongo]] and is frequently seen carrying an umbrella-like he does as a cricket in the Enchanted Forest. He is also good friends with Marco, who is actually Geppetto. Archie is asked by Regina (who is actually the Queen) to convince [[Henry Mills|Henry]] that his ideas about the curse and the true identities of the Storybrooke residents are "crazy." He makes little progress, and Regina becomes impatient and asks him to take a more radical approach. Although it violates his conscience, he initially complies with her demands. Archie later confides to Henry that he wants to be free to do as he wants, and Henry tells him that Jiminy Cricket was a man who took a long time deciding what the right thing to do was. Archie then stands up to Regina and threatens to declare her an unfit mother if she continues to interfere with his sessions with Henry. Archie later puts David under hypnosis to help David remember his actions during his blackouts, causing David to remember some of his memories from the Enchanted Forest.

After the curse was broken, Archie reunites with the other characters and tries to help find out what to do. With Regina regaining her magic and the new curse of leaving Storybrooke, Archie becomes part of the group who attempts to leave Storybrooke and sacrifice his fairy tale memories to get away from Regina, but David's speech encourages him and the others to stay. Regina later visits him, where he encourages Regina to allow her to help him. Regina tells him she has not used magic in two days and it has become a struggle. Archie then asks Regina if there is anything she is holding onto, and she confesses that she preserved her love Daniel's corpse upon his death in the hopes that he could be brought back to life. Archie then states Regina will not be able to move on until she lets go of the past. Regina storms off, but she later returns and confesses to Archie that she used magic that same day. Archie helps her into his office. Much later, Archie is kidnapped by [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]], Regina's mother, and holds him captive in [[Captain Hook]]'s [[The Jolly Roger|ship]], while leaving the body of another in his place disguised to look like him so everyone else will think he is dead. Cora plans to use him to gain information from others in the town. He is later found by Belle on Captain Hook's ship, from which he is rescued.

He is transported back to the Enchanted Forest when Regina undid her curse and later transported back to Storybrooke when the curse was cast again. Shortly after their return to Storybrooke and the subsequent defeat of the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], Archie officiated the wedding of [[Beast|Rumplestiltskin]] and [[Belle]], with [[Maurice|Maurice's]] being the only other present. After the [[Ingrid|Snow Queen]] nearly killed [[Maid Marian]] (secretly the Wicked Witch in disguise) and framed [[Elsa]], Archie advised the others not to jump to conclusions, then later counseled Snow White about her son Neal.

[[Emma Swan]] later visited Dr. Hopper about her visions of her dying against an [[Gideon (Once Upon a Time)|unknown enemy]]. Following the Oracle's death, Dr. Hopper was abducted by the [[Evil Regina|Evil Queen]] after he refused to help her take advantage of Emma's secret; during his capture, the Queen impersonated him and forced Emma to tell her visions to her family. Later, the Queen and [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]] reverted Dr. Hopper to the form of a cricket and locked him in a cage. While Regina distracted her Evil Queen counterpart and Zelena, Snow White and David rescued Archie.

Later, Hook sought counseling from Archie after he decided to propose to Emma, fearing that David still did not approve of him. After Hook learned of his complicity in David's father [[Robert (Once Upon a Time)|Robert's]] death, Archie advised him to tell Emma the truth and seek her forgiveness. Much later, Archie officiated Hook and Emma's wedding. [[A Pirate's Life (Once Upon a Time)|Many years later]], during the seventh season, it is mentioned that Archie officiated many other weddings beyond Gold and Belle and Emma and Hook, though no specific couples were mentioned.

===''[[Pinocchio (2022 film)|Pinocchio]]'' [[Pinocchio (2022 film)|(2022)]]===
[[File:LA-Jiminy.png|thumb|right|250px|Jiminy Cricket in the live-action remake.]]
Jiminy appears in the [[2022]] live-action remake, voiced by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]].

Late one night in a small Italian village, Jiminy enters the home of widowed elderly woodcarver Geppetto, and stays there to stay safe and to warm himself up.

Later that night, The Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong. After a few days, Geppetto decides that the time has come to send Pinocchio to school. However, Pinocchio is soon approached by con-artist fox "Honest" John and his cat partner Gideon. Honest John convinces Pinocchio that he should live a life of fame in order to truly be a real boy, when he really plans to sell him to the puppet master Stromboli in exchange for money. When Jiminy, with the help of a seagull named Sofia, convinces him to continue going to school, Pinocchio is thrown out by the headmaster on account of being a puppet. Pinocchio decides to go to Stromboli's after all with Jiminy unable stop him when Honest John places a glass jar over him. At Stromboli's theater, Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar, and when he enters the coach, he manages to help Pinocchio escape when Pinocchio has him reach the keys to the lock on the cage by telling lies to make his nose grow long. Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner.

When Jiminy, who got separated from Pinocchio again, makes it to the island, he soon finds out that the boys and girls there get turned into donkeys and the Coachman sells them to the salt-mines with help from his fog-like henchmen. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick get transformed himself at a billiard hall and he and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail.

Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's, but find that he's not home because Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio is and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. While trying to find Geppetto, Pinocchio reunites with Fabiana and Sabina, who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested by the Carabinieri for the abuse of his exploited employees and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to the sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster named Monstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach, and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan is successful, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives a chase that ends with him and the group crashing on dry land and seemingly killing Geppetto.

Believing his father has died, Pinocchio cries over him and a magic tear falls from his eye on Geppetto reviving him. Geppetto then tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart for all that he's done and they depart for home. Meanwhile, Jiminy Cricket says in his narration that stories have been told of Pinocchio's becoming a real boy, but Jiminy doesn't confirm if they're true or not, despite a subtle hint being shown otherwise, but what matters is that Pinocchio has the heart of a real boy – brave, truthful, and unselfish – and that he's fully real to his loving, proud father Geppetto.

==Video games==
===''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]''===
Jiminy stars in the 1999 PC game ''Disney's Villains' Revenge''. The Disney Villains change their respective stories giving them the upper hand. Jiminy travels through the stories to save the troubled heroes.

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Jiminy KHIII.png|left|220px]]
Jiminy plays a generally minor role in the popular video game series. After his world was destroyed by the [[Heartless]], Jiminy sought refuge in [[Disney Castle]], under the care of King Mickey and Queen Minnie. He later joins [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] to guide them throughout the journey and chronicle their adventures in his journal.

Throughout the series, Jiminy plays a few key roles. In the original ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', he played a large role throughout the storyline following the adventures of the characters of the lore of the film ''Pinocchio'', as when Sora and company return from Deep Jungle to Traverse Town, they find Pinocchio in the Accessory Shop, having been separated from Geppetto. The Gummi Ship is later intercepted and swallowed by Monstro, where Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Cleo are currently residing in the remains of their sailboat that Monstro had resting in his mouth. After Sora defeated the Parasite Cage Heartless in Monstro's stomach, Monstro sneezed everyone out, and Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Cleo ended up in Traverse Town, where they were provided a house by Leon, and continued to support Jiminy and Sora by providing Gummi Ship blueprints for them. He played a larger role, appearing more frequently, in the sequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]''.

Notably, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Jiminy's journal was greatly expanded. As far as the game's storyline goes, he made one brief appearance during Sora's awakening in [[Twilight Town]]. However, in the HD re-release of the game, ''[[Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 ReMIX]]'', Jiminy made a reappearance during Sora's visit to [[Yen Sid's Tower]]; home of [[Yen Sid|Master Yen Sid]].

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded]]'', Jiminy finds a mysterious entry within his journal, which he doesn't recall recording. Because of this, he immediately reports to King Mickey and explains his confusion. After a little investigation, however, it is revealed that the journal has been corrupt, and to restore it, a data version of Sora is created to enter the journal and eliminate the Bug Blocks.

Jiminy returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' and plays his first role as a supporting character within his homeworld, as opposed to a character taking part in the story's overall plot. He appears in the world of [[w:c:kingdomhearts:Prankster's Paradise|Prankster's Paradise]], frantically trying to retrieve and care for a mischievous Pinocchio.

Jiminy returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', once again joining Sora, Donald, and Goofy on their adventure. Rather than using his actual journal, Jiminy records Sora's adventures using the Gummiphone equipped by Chip and Dale. After Sora rescues [[Aqua]] and [[Ventus]] and thereby gathering the Seven Lights, Jiminy grants them access to his journal entries to keep them up to date on the latest events. Jiminy is later present during the first half of the Keyblade War; he is Sora's only surviving companion when a Demon Tide storm of Heartless lays waste to the other heroes, scattering their hearts to the various worlds Sora had visited earlier. Jiminy guides Sora through various Disney worlds to retrieve the lost hearts of their friends before a Heartless designed after the Grim Reaper, the Lich, can claim them first and cast them into oblivion, killing them permanently. [[Kairi]]'s light is able to guide Sora and Jiminy back to reality, where they are able to resume the final battle against Xehanort. During the epilogue, Jiminy is seen returning to Disney Castle alongside Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Yen Sid.

Jiminy plays a major role in the spin-off to ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', where he acts as Mickey's sidekick during his journey through the "illusions."
