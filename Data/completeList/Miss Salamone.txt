'''MissÂ Salamone''' is the music teacher at Spiro T. Agnew Middle School who helped [[Mikey Blumberg|Mikey]] rehearse for the PTA Spring Fling in the episode, "[[The Voice]]". Although (secretly) Mikey develops a crush on her, she gets engaged to a Costa Rican opera singer named Antonio. She also makes a cameo in "[[Lawson and his Crew]]" and is mentioned in the episode "[[Yes, Mikey, Santa Does Shave]]".

==Trivia==
*Miss Salamone's appearance is often compared to that of former {{WikipediaLink|Pussycat Dolls}} member and television personality, {{WikipediaLink|Nicole Scherzinger}}.
*In the two part episode "[[Lawson and his Crew]]" she makes a cameo appearance in the audience during [[w:c:recess:Kurst the Worst|Kurst the Worst]] and [[Randall Weems|Randall J. Weems]]' ballet recital.
*According to [[Gus Griswald|Gus]], she is approximately around 24-years-old.
**Considering in [[United States|America]] that most students go to college at 18, and teachers must have at least a Bachelor's (4 years), Miss Salamone would have to be at least 22. Since she wasn't referred to as a new teacher by Miss Finster or anyone else, she must have a couple years of teaching under her belt, which would make Gus's approximation right.
