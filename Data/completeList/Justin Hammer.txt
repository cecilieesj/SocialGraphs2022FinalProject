'''Justin Hammer''' is a supervillain from [[Marvel Comics]]. A millionaire and rival business owner of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Hammer is the CEO of Hammer Industries, intent on developing technology far more advanced than the Iron Man armor or anything Tony builds in order to overtake his place as a captain of industry, however, has resorted to underhanded to outright villainous methods to obtain this goal, such as enlisting or collaborating with supervillains. He is the secondary antagonist of the 2010 film ''Iron Man 2'', enlisting [[Whiplash|Ivan Vanko]]'s help in creating the Hammerdrone line.

Justin Hammer was created by David Michelinie, Bob Layton and John Romita Jr.

Later, he is shown interested in the technology used by [[Whiplash|Vanko]] to attack Tony, then he sends him release from jail for help to discredit Tony. When he learns that Vanko doesn't comply as promised, Hammer gets mad and takes the pet of Vanko.

After James Rhodes steals one of Tony's armor, Hammer is called in to improve it. Hammer weaponizes the armor with the best weapons of Hammer Industries. In Stark Expo, his presentation is interrupted by Iron Man, who knows that Hammer is working with Vanko.
At that moment, Vanko takes control of the Drones to make these attacks against Tony and the public.
