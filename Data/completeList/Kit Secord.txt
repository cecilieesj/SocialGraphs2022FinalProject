{{Quote|Never fear, I'm the Rocketeer!|Kit's catchphrase}}

'''Kathrine "Kit" Secord''' (also known as "'''The Rocketeer'''") is the main protagonist of the [[Disney Junior]] animated series, ''[[The Rocketeer (TV series)|The Rocketeer]]''. On her seventh birthday, she receives a surprise package, revealing she is next in line to become the Rocketeer, a legendary superhero who has the ability to fly with the help of a [[Rocket-Pack|rocket-powered jet pack]]. Armed with her cool new gear and secret identity, Kit is ready to take flight and save the day with her gadget-minded best friend, Tesh, and airplane mechanic, Grandpa Ambrose, who join her on her epic adventures.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Kit is a seven year old girl who has green eyes, tan skin, and brown hair tied in pigtails. Her Rocketeer outfit includes a purple lever pilot's jacket, light purple pants with knee pads, dark grey boots tied with purple straps, and gloves. She wears her rocket pack on her back and a streamlined helmet, which features a special fin on the top.

===Powers and Abilities===
*'''[[Rocket Pack]]:''' Like the previous [[Cliff Secord|Rocketeer]], Kit uses a twin rocket-powered jet pack that allows her to fly like a rocket. It is controlled by two throttles, fitted to her gloves, and her helmet works as a rudder to help her steer. The rocket pack is known to be difficult to control, and can sometimes conk out unexpectedly.

==Trivia==
*In early news postings, she was called '''Kit Seacourt'''.
*She is the great-granddaughter of the original Rocketeer, Cliff Secord.
