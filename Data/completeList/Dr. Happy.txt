==Background==
Happy lived in [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa|Pumbaa's]] [[Jungle (The Lion King)|jungle]]. He owned an animal sanctuary and a laboratory, where he kept animals away from danger. He also had a pet dog named Happy Dog, who served as his sidekick.

===Personality===
Being a biologist, Happy likes to help poor unfortunate animals. However, despite his good intentions, he forces them to live in his animal sanctuary, sometimes against their will. Happy can also be somewhat hyperactive.

===Physical Description===
Happy is a short and portly man with fair skin. He wears a red hat, spectacles, a light blue shirt, blue pants, and blue and brown sandals. When he sleeps, he wears a long blue hat with stars and moons on it, dark purple pajamas, and pink bunny slippers.

==Role in the series==
==="[[Let's Serengeti Out of Here]]"===
HappyÂ finds Timon and Pumbaa taking a nap. Believing they were endangered species, he takes the duo to his animal sanctuary. He explains to Timon and Pumbaa that he had thinks they're endangered because he had never heard of them before; therefore, he assumes they are rare. Timon tricks Happy into thinking that he himself is rare and endangered, as neither Timon nor Pumbaa had ever heard of him either. While Happy tries to find a sanctuary of his own, Timon and Pumbaa attempt to escape the wildlife preserve.

When Timon and Pumbaa's attempts to escape the sanctuary fail, Happy returns and tells the duo that he had not found a sanctuary anywhere. Timon unintentionally admits that he had just been trying to get rid of him, which causes Happy to sob. Happy then tells Timon and Pumbaa that he had created some activities they could do in the animal sanctuary. This makes Timon want to stay and accept living a new life in the preserve. Pumbaa, however, starts to feel homesick and wants to leave the sanctuary. Timon argues that they could do lots of things at the sanctuary and suggests they stay.

28 years later, Timon begins to feel homesick, and he and Pumbaa make a plan to escape while Happy and Happy Dog are distracted. They use two sacks of potatoes as dummies of themselves escaping the sanctuary. Happy and Happy Dog chase the potato sacks as well as some other animals while Timon and Pumbaa tunnel out.

After their plan succeed, Timon and Pumbaa are happy to relive their old lives. Happy and Happy Dog chase the sacks of potatoes and eventually run back into Timon and Pumbaa, who attempt to escape them, as they are worried that Happy would force them to live at the wildlife preserve again.

==="[[Shake Your Djibouti]]"===
While Happy is sleeping, Happy Dog tells his owner that his new monster, [[Bartholomew (Timon & Pumbaa)|Bartholomew]] had escaped their laboratory. Showing little concern about Bartholomew's escape, Happy suggests that they look for him the next day.

==Trivia==
*The blue hat Happy sleeps with resembles [[The Sorcerer's Hat (Disney's Hollywood Studios)|the Sorcerer's hat]] from ''[[Fantasia]]'' and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].
* Dr. Happy seems to like rabbits, as he wears bunny shorts and bunny slippers.
* In "[[Shake Your Djibouti]]", Dr. Happy has gray eyebrows. This may indicate that he aged over the course of the 28-year gap in "[[Let's Serengeti Out of Here]]".
* Dr. Happy is very similar to the character Bessie Higgenbottom from the 2008-2010 Nickelodeon animated series ''[[wikipedia:The Mighty B!|The Mighty B!]]'', as both characters are geeky with extreme hyperactivity and have a blue dog named Happy (or with "Happy" in their names in the case of Happy Dog).
