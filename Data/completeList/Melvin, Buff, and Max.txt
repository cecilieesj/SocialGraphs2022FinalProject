Melvin is a slow-witted but good-natured moose, Buff is an impatient buffalo, and Max is a stag deer. Together they heckled the performers on stage.

==Appearances==

=== Country Bear Jamboree ===
In all three iterations of the ''Country Bear Jamboree'', the three heads would interact and react to the action on stage, and even take part in some of the musical numbers, and will sometimes end up arguing with each other at various points in the show. However, much of their banter was cut from the Magic Kingdom version during its 2012 refurbishment that shortened the show.

=== [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground|Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground]] ===
From 1988 to 1991, a puppet version of Melvin starred in the "Chip and Dale's Country Morning Jamboree" character breakfast show that took place at Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground.

=== [[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]] ===
Melvin, Buff, and Max can be spotted in the Disneyland version of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, which replaced the Country Bear Playhouse, as a tribute. They appear after the vehicles exit the Heffalumps & Woozles scene, watching [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] enjoying his honey. Riders have to look back in order to spot them.

=== Mile Long Bar ===
Besides hanging around in Grizzly Hall, they would also appear in the Mile Long Bar restaurant, which had a side entrance that the exit to the show fed into. This version of the trio would sing songs encouraging people to stop and eat at the restaurant. When the Mile Long Bar became part of [[Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn & Cafe]], this set of heads would be removed.

=== [[Disney Springs|Twenty Eight & Main]] ===
In this shop of the Disney Springs Marketplace Co-Op is a mounted pair of antlers.  The plaque on the mount reads as, "Max, Buff, & Melvin's Stuffing & Mounting Crafting Characters. Est. [[1971]]".

=== [[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]] ===
Melvin, Buff and Max appear in [[The Wonderful Winter of Mickey Mouse]] in the rundown cabin that Mickey, Donald and Goofy rent at [[Mineral King]]. When the trio are snowed in, Goofy's claustrophobia causes him to hallucinate the trio warning him to trust no one in his voice. When the cabin begins sliding down the mountain, Melvin speaks up for real to warn the trio of the gaining avalanche.

==Trivia==

*Melvin has occasionally been portrayed as a full-bodied moose. A comic appearance in 1971 would show Melvin as merely peeking into the theater through a hole in the wall, while a full bodied bipedal Melvin wearing a plaid bathrobe appeared in seasonal Christmas shows in the 1980s and 1990s such as Christmas Follies at Disneyland and Miss Minnie's Country Christmas at the Magic Kingdom.
