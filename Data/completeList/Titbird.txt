The '''titbird''' is a small bird whose only role is to catch a flea and act as an early warning device for a charging [[rhinoceros]] in the [[1945]] animated short, ''[[African Diary]]''.

==Role in the short==
The bird is first seen resting on a black rhinoceros' horn. The Titbird acts as a warning sign for the rhino, against a shotgun-wielding [[Goofy]], who tries to shoot at it. Goofy tries his shoot against the rhinoceros, but the animal is too much for Goofy. He evidently leaves Africa and flees from the rhinoceros for the other hunters to shoot.
