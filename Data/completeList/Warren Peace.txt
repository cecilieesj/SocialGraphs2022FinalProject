'''Warren Peace''' is a major character in ''[[Sky High]]'', and [[Will Stronghold]]'s former "arch-nemesis" to Best Friend. He is a very feared student in the school, mostly because due to the fact that his father, Baron Battle, was a supervillain while his mother (whose name is never revealed) was a superheroine. Since Will's arrival, Warren followed him closely to avenge his father's arrest by [[The Commander]]'s (Will's father) hands.

== Background==
===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====

*'''Pyrokinesis:''' Warren is a pyrokinetic, he can create and control fire. He showed various aspects of this ability including creating extreme heat in his hands to burn others, without flames, he can control the fire to create something as small as a candle flame from a fingertip, to flames covering his arms and most of his upper body. He can also throw fireballs, and he has excellent aim. Warren was only able to create fire from his hands and could extend the fire to his arms. It is unknown if he could create fire from the rest of his body or extend the fire to any other parts of his body. If he could, he may be able to coat his entire body in flames. While the flames burn, his clothes are unharmed.
*'''Superhuman Strength and Durability:''' He also seems to possess superhuman strength and durability, he isn't quite invulnerable but he has been thrown through walls and into pillars by the super strong Will Stronghold, breaking them with his body, and getting up again a moment later seeming no worse for the wear and was able to effortlessly throw a destroyed metal object over a barrier during Save the Citizen.

==Role in the film==
Warren is already a feared student when the film begins. He continuously gives Will cold looks before bursting out on him when Will accidentally throws a tray of food on him. Their fight causes Will to tap into his previously dormant power of super-strength and a battle ensues in the cafeteria, almost destroying it. They were both thrown to detention, where their powers are neutralized.

Ethan and Zach accept Lash and Speed's challenge in Save the Citizen in Will's place, and Warren is forced to partner with Will. Lash wraps himself around Warren, only to be burned. Towards the end of the game, Speed creates an oxygen-sucking vortex around Warren, preventing him from creating his fire and nearly suffocating him. Will stops Speed and throws Warren at the citizen, winning them the game. But his hostility towards Will continues. That night, he meets [[Layla Williams|Layla]] at the Paper Lantern where he works as a part-timer and reveals he has a kind and caring side, and the two begin to form a friendship. Despite him being Will's enemy, he advises her to confess her romantic feelings to him and ask him to homecoming. When that fails, she asks him to be her date at homecoming to make Will jealous. He reluctantly agrees, but refuses to rent a tux. Afterwards, Layla, Ethan, Zach, and Magenta begin to hang out with him at school, much to his dismay.

On the night before the dance, he runs into Will at the Paper Lantern and tells him about Layla's true feelings, though he also takes delight in pointing out that he was being a jerk to his friends, so he does deserve getting the silent treatment from them. At homecoming, he uses his father's tux and meets Layla. When Gwen reveals herself as Royal Pain and turns nearly everyone at the dance into infants, Warren opens an escape in the vent for himself and the other four. He later fights [[Speed]], who uses super-speed to evade his attacks. With Ethan's help, he manages to send Speed into the wall with his fireball. After everyone is saved, he is seen being courted by a girl who controls ice. In the ending sequence, Will comments that arch-enemy Warren became his best friend and a part of their own superhero team.

Warren is one of the more complex people in the film. He can speak Chinese, with no explanation where he picked it up. He helped other students escape the Homecoming Ball when Royal Pain revealed herself, showing that he was concerned for the other students' welfare.

==Trivia==

*His name is a play-on on the Leo Tolsky novel ''War and Peace''.
*Warren’s height is 6’2”.
*He is sometimes mistaken for Jacob Black, portrayed by Taylor Lautner as the two look alike.
