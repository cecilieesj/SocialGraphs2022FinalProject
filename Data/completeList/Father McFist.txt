'''Father McFist''' is the father of Terry and [[Hannibal McFist]] and the founder of [[McFist Industries]]. He is seen in a flashback in the episode "[[McOne Armed and Dangerous]]".

==Role in the episode==
After Hannibal gets [[Stank|Stanked]] by [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]], he goes on a rampage against [[Randy Cunningham]] for ruining his reputation. Trying to figure out how to Destank his toughest, strongest enemy yet, Randy notices [[Howard Weinerman]] eating the first McSquiddle. Realizing this is what Hannibal holds most dear, Randy manages to get Howard to regurgitate the McSquiddle. When it lands in Hannibal's mouth, he gets a flashback of his father teaching him about McSquiddles. Father McFist says that people will love the corporation so long as they enjoy McSquiddles (which were the very first product manufactured). As Hannibal reaches out to pick a McSquiddle off the conveyor belt, Father McFist slaps his son's hand away, saying that he could risk losing an arm that way. After the flashback, Hannibal reverts back to normal.

==Trivia==
*Father McFist has a mechanical arm, much like his son Hannibal. But Father McFist's arm has a steampunk appearance compared to Hannibal's, which is more modernized.
*His voice actor, [[John DiMaggio]] also voice Hannibal.
