'''Moose and Rocco''' are minor characters who appeared in the series ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. They appear in the episode "[[Out of Scale (Rescue Rangers episode)|Out of Scale]]".

== History ==
They are the two henchmen who work for the crime lord [[Ratso Ratzkiwatzki|Ignatz "Ratso" Ratzkiwatzki]]. The two took [[Professor Norton Nimnul]] hostage and got their hands on his [[Gigantico Raygun]]. They used the ray gun to shrink the park's statue first, bringing it to Ratso's daughter [[Buffy Ratzkiwatzki|Buffy]], who enjoyed doll houses. Moose and Rocco then captured [[Chip and Dale]], whom they thought were squirrels. Last of all, they shrank the art museum and brought it to their boss to hold for ransom.
