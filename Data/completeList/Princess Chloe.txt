'''Chloe''' is the princess of the kingdom of Norberg and the daughter of [[Queen Abigail]].

==History==
In "[[Norberg Peace Prize]]", Chloe joined her mother in their royal coach to greet Princess Elena of [[Avalor]] and her companions when they arrived at the capital city's harbors after Abigail had invited the Avaloran princess to mediate her and [[King Hector]] of Hectoria's negotiations regarding the export of mulberries from Hectoria for Norberg's Family Day. As she stepped out of her coach, the Norbergian princess became exuberant when she saw Captain [[Gabe Núñez|Gabe]] of the Avalor Royal Guard and rushed over to greet him. She invited him and the Turner family to her personal tour of the Norberg Palace, but [[Naomi Turner]] declined in favor of joining her parents [[Scarlett Turner]] and [[Daniel Turner]] at the town pub. Chloe led Gabriel into her royal coach and left for her palace.

Chloe showed Gabriel around the royal palace and taught him about some Family Day traditions. Later that evening, the two watched the sunset and the Norberg lights on the palace balcony. Noticing that her new friend appeared to be troubled, Chloe asked him what was wrong. Gabriel explained that he felt guilty for not spending his day at Norberg with his friend Naomi as he had promised, to which the princess hinted to him to watch the Norberg lights with someone he greatly cared about per Norbergian tradition.

Chloe accompanied Gabriel in returning to the docks when he reconciled with Naomi and watched the Norberg lights with her mother and their guests.

She returned in "[[The Birthday Cruise]]". She appears before Elena to have her birthday celebrated in Avalor because she has no friends in Norberg to invite. Elena helps her by teaching her the proper manners of being a friend. As Chloe understands the teachings, Elena plans her party with an all-day cruise with Mateo, Valentina, and Rebecca. However, Chloe takes her teachings too seriously and doesn't tell them she gets seasick easily. She also isn't fond of the other princesses' games and dances. Later, Chloe is frightened by Mateo's usage of magic (and cupcakes) and runs off crying. She then reveals to Elena that in another one of her birthday parties when she was younger, a wizard had accidentally turned her and everyone into cupcakes, leaving her scared of magic and desserts. She knows about an old Norberg legend about a cursed sea nymph named Maliga who was banished to the foglands by her people for being selfish, cruel and rude but Chloe reformed her into a good sea nymph and thanks to the princess of Norberg the other sea nymphs reunite with Maliga, end her curse and tells her she can come back home.

In ''[[Coronation Day]]'' she attends Elena's Coronation.
