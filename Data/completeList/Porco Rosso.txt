'''Porco Rosso''' is the protagonist from the 1992 [[Porco Rosso (film)|film on the same name]]. He is an ex-World War I fighter pilot, now living as a freelance bounty hunter chasing "air pirates" in the Adriatic Sea. However, an unusual curse has transformed him to an anthropomorphic pig. Once called Marco Pagot, he is now known to the world as "Porco Rosso", Italian for "Red Pig". He was originally voiced by Shūichirō Moriyama in Japanese and was voiced by [[Michael Keaton]] in the English dub.

==Trivia==
