'''Matthew "Matt" McGuire''' is [[Lizzie McGuire|Lizzie]]'s younger brother. He is the minor antagonist in ''Lizzie McGuire'' portrayed as a scheming, witty, cheeky, young prankster who goes to extreme lengths to continuously annoy, irritate, and humiliate his older sister Lizzie, and sometimes his parents.

At school, he is the stereotypical class clown. He is shown to be lazy, and, although he does have much potential for greater things, he doesn't use it much. He has a best friend named [[Lanny Onasis]] who does not speak on-screen, but Matt is always able to understand him anyway. Despite his carefree and joking nature, Matt is shown to be bullied by a boy named Haywood Biggs. Matt is intelligent, clever, wily and has a reputation for getting into trouble. He's also never liked [[Kate Sanders]], and has pulled pranks on her from time to time. Matt and Lizzie share a typical brother-sister relationship. They fool around and annoy each other, but are always there for each other in the end.
