==Early life==
During World War II, Ernst Mueller committed several war crimes (which led him to be sentenced to death). In 1944, Mueller and his men went to an area known as Finow. Here, they found hundreds of Soviet soldiers massacred. Although they were not responsible for the incident, Mueller and his troops took the credit for the slaughter.

===''[[Agent Carter]]''===
After the war, Mueller was arrested and sentenced to death by hanging. A Day before his execution, Mueller was visited by Roger Dooley, a member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve. Dooley asks what happened in Finow but he refuses to share such information.

Dooley then offered him a cyanide pill to commit suicide and so disappoint his captors. Mueller accepts the offers and reveals that no German fought at the Battle of Finow. Before leaving the prison, Dooley gives Mueller the cyanide pill as agreed. When Dooley abandons the cell of Mueller, it is revealed that Dooley gave him a breath mint.
