==Appearances==
===''[[Hercules: The Animated Series|Hercules: the Animated Series]]''===
In the episode "Hercules and the Big Games" [[Hades]] visits Echidna and has her gather her entire family (including Chimera) to attack Athens. Meanwhile, [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] is winning every event and enjoying being a hero (or sports hero, as [[Philoctetes|Phil]] calls it) â€“ until [[Ares]] remembers, in a manner similar to anti-doping, that he is a demigod, and only mortals can compete; hence, half his points are taken off. But when Echidna and her family arrive, he puts aside popularity to save the day, with an assist from Ares and [[Athena]], who are working together for once.

The Chimera resurfaces in "[[Hercules and the Pegasus Incident]]" where she is terrorizing Lycia. She is briefly defeated by [[Pegasus]] and Bellerophon after accidentally swallowing a molten staff. The Chimera is placed inside a petting zoo following her defeat, although she is freed once her cage collapses. After another confrontation with Pegasus and Bellerophon fails to defeat her, Hercules teams up with Pegasus to trick the Chimera into knocking herself out, and is then thrown out of Lycia by Hercules.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Chimera don't actively appear on the show and was implied to be a common species in Fairytale Land. [[King Midas]] kept one of these creatures as a golden statue. At [[Lancelot]]'s village, they can be eaten as food (it looks and tastes like "one part lion, one part serpent, one part goat") and their blood is used as an ingredient for the Curse of the Empty Hearted.

==Trivia==

*The Chimera's defeat in "Hercules and the Pegasus Incident" is taken from the original myth, in which Bellerophon threw a spear molten by the Chimera's breath down her throat and killed her.
*In Greek mythology, the Chimera was female and also had the head of a goat or dragon. However, the ''Hercules'' TV series refers to it as a "he" at one point. May have been an error.
