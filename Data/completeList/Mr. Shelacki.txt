|occupation = Protectionist}}'''Mr. Shelacki''' is the protectionist and overly-childish guidance counselor at Doug's school in the TV series ''[[Disney's Doug|Doug]]''.

He constantly seems to be stuck in the 1970s. He often wears a sweater that says "Hug Me" and he once associated Doug's middle name, Yancey, with "the good Doug". He uses a lot of sociological phrases. For example, in the "Career Day" episode, he tells Doug that he received an unstable career because "The only people who have job security are orthodontists, dentists, surgeons, physicans, and trial lawyers".
