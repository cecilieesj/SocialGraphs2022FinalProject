==Background==
Serving under the tyranny of [[Queen Ingrith]], Lickspittle works in his lab as a scientist using Tomb Bloom flowers, using it to mix with iron powder. In his lab is a collection of [[Fairies (Maleficent)|fairies]] trapped inside jars so that whenever he mixes mixes a Tomb Bloom's pollen with iron powder, it creates crimson powder, eradicating every type of fairy (including [[Dark Fey]]) instantly. At the end after Ingrith's tyranny is put to an end forever, he reforms and allows Maleficent to break the curse.

===Behind the scenes===
Warwick Davis (the actor who plays Lickspittle) explains that during Lickspittle's time serving Ingrith was involved during his plan to kill fairies, thanks to Ingrith's tyrannical order. At his time, despite his affinity to the Moor Folk, he obeyed Ingrith's hatred for fairies, which is the reason he was incarcerated, obeying Ingrith's evil plans like helping her eradicate every fairy in the Moors. Until then, Lickspittle's species was not revealed until the climax of the film where Aurora enters his laboratory as he reveals to her that he is indeed a pixie. It is said that Lickspittle's laboratory is located at the basement of Queen Ingrith's castle where Lickspittle's focus during his duty as a scientist is his workbench where he had to adapt his life as a lab worker to suit himself to which due to his size, he used a device for his workbench to help him use the height he requires to reach; the workbench he uses does not only help him give him correct height but also helps him slide back and forth during his duty.<ref>Bonus feature ''Lickspittle'' (''Maleficent: Mistress of Evil''; Digital platforms).</ref>

==Appearances==
===''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]''===
Lickspittle is first seen examining a Tomb Bloom flower using his tweezers. Looking at [[Queen Ingrith]] who enters his lab, Lickspittle agrees with following her request to move faster. Looking at the [[Spinning Wheel]] inside the storage, she explains to him that everything is coming together perfectly.

As Pinto finds herself inside Lickspittle's lab after avoiding a nearby cat, Lickspittle sees her and puts Pinto inside a jar, trapping the fairy. Lickspittle then pours some iron powder into a bowl while he picks up a piece of pollen of Tomb Bloom flowers from another bowl, mixing the pollen with the iron powder, emitting crimson powder. Ingrith later returns to his lab, explaining that when one mixes the Tomb Bloom flower's with iron powder, its dust can eradicate a fairy instantly, explaining the process to Ingrith of how it works. Lickspittle pours crimson powder on a dandelion fairy, eradicating her into a lifeless dandelion just as Ingrith evilly plans to take over the [[Moors]] and eradicate all the fairies in it.

[[Aurora]] later arrives at Lickspittle's lab and enters the storage room where the Spinning Wheel is at, telling her that no one is allowed to enter except for him and Aurora remembers that it wasn't Maleficent who cursed [[King Hubert|King John]] but rather Ingrith herself much to Lickspittle's protests. Aurora confronts him about Ingrith's evil actions, explaining that he serves the queen who is being tyrannical to the fairies just as Lickspittle leaves when Ingrith enters his lab as the queen reveals her true actions to Aurora.

Lickspittle then notices Pinto alongside a mushroom fairy named "Button" trying to escape to which he becomes distracted upon seeing the Spinning Wheel. He later arrives towards Maleficent and Aurora reunited, showing Maleficent the spindle from the Spinning Wheel, allowing Maleficent to destroy the spindle, also destroying the Spinning Wheel and finally waking up King John. Lickspittle later attends the wedding of [[Prince Phillip]] and Aurora as well as the peace between Ulstead and the Moors.
