====''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]''====
Sprite is one of ten superpowered Eternals sent by the Celestial Arishem to Earth to exterminate the invasive Deviants. The last Deviants are apparently killed in 1521, however, she and the rest of the Eternals wait for Arishem to tell them that they can leave.

Sprite has the physical appearance of a 12-year old girl, as the years passed she grew envious of human beings who could go grow up, have children and live a normal life

In present day, she lives in London with Sersi, when the Uni-Mind begins to emerge, she betrays the Eternals hoping to use the Uni-Mind's energy. However she eventually helps the Eternals stop the Uni-Mind. Sersi uses the remaining energy from the Uni-Mind to turn Sprite into a human, ending her permanent child-like state. 

==Trivia==
*Sprite is similar to Tinker Bell in many ways as they were in love with a male figure in their lives and harbored jealous towards a girl who caught the romantic attention of their love interest.
