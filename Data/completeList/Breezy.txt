=== The Secret of the Eighth Dwarf ===
When Snow White comes to visit the dwarfs at their cottage, they tell her a story about the wandering eighth dwarf Breezy, believing that he's successfully found fame and fortune on his long travels. Breezy overhears this story just as he's about to come in for a visit, but turns back, not wanting to embarrass himself by showing up as only a travelling hobo. Viewing the scene by way of a crystal ball, [[The Evil Queen]] enters the scene, disguising herself as "The Bindle Fairy", who offers Breezy a wish-granting magic ring to help present himself as a success. The dwarfs warmly greet Breezy, who weaves a tall tale about his vast empire and claiming it was all thanks to a magic ring he found in the birch grove nearby. 

As the dwarfs go off to the mines and Breezy stays with Snow White, all the dwarfs except [[Dopey]] become consumed with greed and ask Breezy to help them find magic rings. During their journey in the woods, Breezy uses two of his wishes to save his brothers from danger. The dwarfs find Breezy's grove is nothing but stumps and old tools belonging to each other. They briefly begin arguing with each other thinking one has been hiding rings, only to realize the trees they cut down were what they used to build their cottage. In their lust for gold, the dwarfs begin destroying their own house, leaving Snow White alone and unprotected, allowing the "Bindle Fairy" to lead her away and put her into another death-like sleep with birch blossoms. The Queen reveals her scheme and Breezy guiltily leaves. Realizing he has one last wish, he uses it to undo the entire adventure and roll time back to when he first overheard the Dwarfs talking about him. Content to let them believe whatever they want about him, he throws his bindle away when the "Bindle Fairy" appears to him again and continues his travels.{{Snow White}}
