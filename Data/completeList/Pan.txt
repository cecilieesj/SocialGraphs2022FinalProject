'''Pan''' is the Arcadian God of pastures and fields; in essence a nature or fertility God. He appeared in two Disney animated shorts, [[1930]]'s ''[[Playful Pan]]'' and [[1944]]'s ''[[Springtime for Pluto]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[Playful Pan]]''===
Pan comes to Earth, coaxing music and dance out of the flora and fauna. Lightning strikes start a fire that nearly burn everything. Pan uses his music to lure the flames into a nearby pond where they are safely extinguished.

===''[[Springtime for Pluto]]''===
Pan's brief appearance was at the beginning, appearing as a spirit. The God plays his pan-pipes to wake up [[Pluto]] and the spring. Thus reprising his role as the God of nature and the spring.

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Springtime for Pluto]]'', Pan looks similar to The Satyrs from "[[The Pastoral Symphony]]" segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'', only this time he wears blue overalls and a green bowler hat.
