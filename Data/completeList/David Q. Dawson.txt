'''Dr. David Q. Dawson''' is the deuteragonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1986]] animated feature film, ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''. He previously served as the [[Mouse Queen|Queen]]'s sixty-sixth Regiment in Afghanistan.

==Background==

{{Quote|I had just arrived in London after lengthy service in Afghanistan and was anxious to find a quiet place preferably dry where I could rest and find a bit of peace. Little did I know but my life was about to change forever.|Dr. Dawson, prior to meeting [[Olivia Flaversham|Olivia]]|The Great Mouse Detective}}
In the film, Dr. David Q. Dawson is a surgeon who returns home to [[London]], [[England]] after military service in Afghanistan. After he hops off his carriage, Dawson comes across a little girl mouse named Olivia Flaversham inside a boot, crying her eyes out about her father, Hiram, being captured by [[Fidget the Bat|Fidget]], sidekick to the dastardly Professor Ratigan. Feeling very sorry for the young mouse, he escorts her to Baker street as quickly as possible. He is surprised by Basil's strangeness but soon catches on to his personality. After Dawson catches a hint of Fidget's trace, Basil offers to make him his partner. Dawson upholds this rank quite well, even providing necessary encouragement after they were humiliated and tied in a death trap. He later becomes Basil's assistant and the two mice become lifelong associates after Ratigan is defeated.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Dawson made a few cameo appearances in the television series ''House of Mouse''. In the episode "[[Donald's Lamp Trade]]", Dawson nearly becomes a victim of Ratigan's mousetrap, but was saved by Basil.
