|quote = }}'''Dusty''' is one of [http://handymanny.wikia.com/wiki/Manuel_%22Manny%22_Garcia Manny]'s tools. She, along with [[Squeeze]], are the female tools in the group. Her favorite singer is Danny Starr. As of [http://handymanny.wikia.com/wiki/Detective_Dusty?action=edit&redlink=1 Detective Dusty], it is shown that Dusty always wanted to be a detective when Mrs. Portillo was missing her socks.


==Appearance==
Dusty has a red handle and a silver body. Unlike all the female tools, she appears to have no eyelashes except when she is seen wearing her ballerina outfit which consists of a tutu and a bow.

==Personality==
She's friendly, playful, and acts like a big sister. Dusty is very smart and gives good advice and acts as the big sister. She has a childish voice but it's not her fault. Whenever Dusty sees Danny Starr, she, like all female fans, starts feeling lovey-dovey and she will eventually pass out. Dusty is shown to be talented at ballet and detective work. When there's a movie or a book that involves a saw, Dusty becomes really interested and would like to watch it or read it. Dusty's favorite color is pink as shown in "[[A Night with Abuelito]]" when Dusty asked Abuelito if he has any soft, pink blankets available for her to sleep in at night. Dusty seems to like feminine hair products such as hairbrushes despite the fact she can't use them. Dusty doesn't realize that she can only cut wood sometimes like in "[http://handymanny.wikia.com/wiki/Welcome_to_Sheet_Rock_Hills <u>Welcome to Sheet Rock Hills</u>]" when she attempted to cut through the metal bars of the sewage outage. Dusty's favorite movie genre is romantic because she wanted to see Sawdust Memories which is a romantic movie.
