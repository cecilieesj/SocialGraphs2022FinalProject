'''Jeryn "Jeri" Hogarth''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in the [[Netflix]] part of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], played by [[Carrie-Anne Moss]].

Jeryn Hogarth, was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne.

Just like [[Daredevil|Matt Murdock]], Jeri is a lawyer who believes in protecting the innocent and striving for justice to triumph. However, rather than fight crime directly, he became an ally of [[Defenders (team)|the Defenders]]. She is closest to [[Jessica Jones]], giving Jessica the cases that Jessica usually works on, but she is also close to Daredevil and [[Iron Fist]].

==Trivia==
*Jeri Hogarth is the very first amongst characters, in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], to be depicted as female, whilst originally having a male [[Marvel Comics|comic]] counterpart.
** Other characters include; The [[Ancient One]], [[Ghost]], [[Mar-Vell]], [[Morgan Stark]], [[Makkari]], [[Gabriella Rosetti]], [[Karli Morgenthau]] and [[Ajak]].
