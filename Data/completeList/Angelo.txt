[[File:Angelo.jpg|thumb|250px]]
'''Angelo''' is a Muppet chef with a thick Italian accent who appeared in the 2010 web series ''[[The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora]]''. Like [[the Swedish Chef]], his hands are real human hands as opposed to glove hands. This is likely due to the fact that Angelo actually handles real food on the show.

Angelo is good friends with the Swedish Chef and [[w:c:muppets:Beauregard|Beauregard]] once mistook him for the Swedish Chef.

Angelo also appears in ''Hasty Tasty Cooking Tips''â€”a short series with the same premise as "The Muppets Kitchen", although leaner in episode length and characters.

Years ago, the Swedish Chef taught Angelo everything that he knew. Angelo joked that instead of listening, he went to night school.
