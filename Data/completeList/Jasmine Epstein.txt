==History==
She first appeared in the episode, Zombie Tea Party 5. Her family, and/or herself, may have a butler or two because Bertram said (from what he heard from the other butlers) she was terrible. [[Zuri Ross|Zuri]] doesn't seem to like her, especially when she throws her jacket on her and makes a remark about her age, and Zuri throws it off the balcony. She cares about fashion more than friendship as shown when [[Emma Ross|Emma]] fell down the stairs from wearing high heels and Jasmines only action was to see if the shoes were ok paying no mind to Emma.

She was mentioned in "Glue Dunnit: A Sticky Situation," where she called Emma, but Emma hung up and the phone got stuck to her hand.
