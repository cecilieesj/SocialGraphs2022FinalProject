'''Riggo''' is Will's toy forklift truck from the Disney Junior show ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. He appeared in the episode "[[Stuck Up]]". When Will found out his scoop is stuck, he gets [[Dottie McStuffins|Doc]] to take a look. In the playground castle, Riggo finds his scoop stuck too and admits he can't scoop sand with a stuck scoop. When Doc gets sand in her eye, she realizes Riggo has sand in his joints too. They wash the sand out with the fountain. Excitedly trying it out, Riggo accidentally knocks Stuffy over with sand, and Doc tells him to be careful with sand.
