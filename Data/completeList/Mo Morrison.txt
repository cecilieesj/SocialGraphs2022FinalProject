'''Maurice "Mo" Morrison''' is a character in the [[2022]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Lightyear]]''.

==Background==
Mo suffers from a lack of direction, who cannot seem to find his passion. He has a long fear of commitment, especially when it comes to holding a full-time job. When Mo joined forces with [[Izzy Hawthorne]] and the Junior Zap Patrol, he does not exactly share Izzy's passion for the cause. Mo joined the unit because he did not have anything else going on. Upon first meeting, he does not have a lot of confidence in his ability to succeed, and would rather quit before he has a chance to find out.

===Physical appearance===
Mo Morrison is a middle-aged man with dark skin, dark and slightly grey curly hair and beard, and brown eyes. He wears a fading blue armored suit with the number "12" and the word "ZAP" labelled on each shoulder pad. At some point in the film, Mo bears an orange and white Space Ranger suit.

==Trivia==
*In the earliest draft of ''Lightyear'', Mo and [[Izzy Hawthorne]] were going to be siblings. Additionally, he was also going to be a dentist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/exclusive-lightyear-creatives-reveal-keke-palmer-and-taika-waititi-almost-played-siblings/|title=EXCLUSIVE: ‘Lightyear’ Creatives Reveal Keke Palmer and Taika Waititi Almost Played Siblings|website=Murphy's Multiverse|last=Redesi|first=Hunter|date=June 14, 2022|access-date=June 14, 2022}}</ref>
