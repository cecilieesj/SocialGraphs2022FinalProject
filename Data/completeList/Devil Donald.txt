==Appearances==
===''[[Donald's Better Self]]''===
Donald's bad side makes his first appearance in ''Donald's Better Self''. Donald's good side persuades Donald to go to school while his bad side tempts him to go fishing. He forces Donald to smoke and making him sick until he gets into a fight with Angel Donald and got defeated.

===''[[Donald's Decision]]''===
In this wartime retread of the latter, the Devil encourages Donald to be stingy and that war bonds are a scam, while Donald's Angel says that he'll be helping the war effort by making a loan to the US government.

===''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''===
Devil Donald appears resuming the role of Donald's bad side. Humorously, he appears as both Donald's good and bad sides in "[[Labyrinth and Repeat]]". In "[[Mt. Fuji Whiz]]", Devil Donald turns out to be the ruler of the Underworld (and possibly the actual devil himself). He berates [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] for letting the Three Caballeros escape the Underworld and being a terrible manager and fires him back to the living world along with [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Lord Felldrake]] and [[Leopold the Horrible|Leopold]]. In "[[Shangri-La-Di-Da]]", he appears as part of Donald's vision about his inability to control his anger.

===Other appearances===
Devil Donald was briefly seen on [[Weebo]] the Robot's monitor in the live-action film ''[[Flubber]]'' via archive footage from his debut short.

In ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', Donald has a very similar devil costume.

In ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' the 2017 series, Della wore a devil outfit similar to her brother's in "[[The Trickening!]]".
