'''Scat Cat''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1970]] animated feature film, ''[[The Aristocats]]''.

==Background==
===Development===
Scat Cat was originally written for [[Louis Armstrong]] to voice him and was originally named Satchmo Cat. Unfortunately for Armstrong, he became ill and was unable to voice the character, leading to the decision to replace him with Scatman Crothers, rename him "Scat Cat" and write a new song, "[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]."

==Appearances==
===''[[The Aristocats]]''===
One night, [[Thomas O'Malley]] brings [[Duchess]] and her three tired kittens to his penthouse, where he takes them all in with care and gives them a place to sleep. Jazz music can be heard from inside, and Scat Cat and his [[Alley Cats]] are introduced. While playing their instruments, Scat Cat and the gang all sing "[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]". O'Malley and Duchess join in the fun, as do [[Berlioz]], [[Marie]], and [[Toulouse]]. During the song, O'Malley and Duchess perform a dance number, and Duchess sings a wonderful solo while playing the harp; which Scat Cat and the gang find so beautiful, soft, lovely, and romantic until they get back to playing their instruments (with the help of Scat Cat's trumpeting) and make their way out of the penthouse along with other alley cats.

Later, Scat Cat and the gang, upon being informed by O'Malley via [[Roquefort]] (the latter of whom nearly got killed by them due to getting the name wrong), come to rescue Duchess and her kittens from [[Edgar]], a greedy butler who is "catnapping" the cats so as to inherit a great fortune. As Scat Cat and the alley cats rush to save Duchess and her kittens, they were also witnessed by a Frenchman proceeding to drink wine. He saw cats seemingly being chased by a mouse (Roquefort). Believing he was hallucinating, the Frenchman then poured his wine onto the ground, implying he is deeply considering to give up drinking alcohol.

After Scat Cat and the gang defeat Edgar, Scat Cat, along with the other alley cats, get adopted by [[Madame Adelaide Bonfamille|Madame Bonfamille]] at the end of the movie.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
In the show, Scat Cat, O'Malley, and the other alley cats were all a part of the popular band "O'Malley and the Alley Cats." However, as a running gag in the show, something or someone would prevent the band from playing.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
An orange version of Scat Cat once appeared at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom in the 1970s and 80s alongside other colorful versions of his band.

Scat Cat also serves as the namesake of Scat Cat's Club at [[Disney's Port Orleans Resort]] at Walt Disney World and can be seen in a mural at the [[Center Street Coffeehouse]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

==Trivia==
*Scat Cat resembles an older version of [[Berlioz]], which makes sense as they both wear red ribbons. However, Scat Cat is grey and has a white patch on his face around his eyes and nose, and [[Berlioz]] is completely grey.
*Scat Cat shares the same name and voice actor with the antagonist of the titular avians of the short-lived live-action Hanna-Barbera series ''The Skatebirds''.
