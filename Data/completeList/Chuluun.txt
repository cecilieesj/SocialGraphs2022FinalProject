When the elder of the red pandas [[Domog]] tells the Lion Guard to learn about the "Ghost of the Mountain" as the most fearsome monster the red pandas have ever feared to save the pack as the Lion Guard plans to stop the ghost the red pandas have talked about. Far away from the bamboo forest and surviving a couple of falling icicles, [[Anga]] spots the mysterious creature [[Kion]] cannot catch to which she explains that the creature she spotted was not a real ghost but an elusive cat to which [[Ono]] explains that the creature Anga spotted is a snow leopard, a cat whose fur helps blend in with the snow and camouflage within the environment. As the Lion Guard follows the snow leopard's footprints to which the snow leopard finally reveals and introduces herself as Chuluun. Kion urges her to stop pestering the red pandas in their bamboo forest to which she explains that she does not follow the Circle of Life but rather follow her own path as she tells the Guard that she has no animal to challenge her.

Soon as Chuluun leaves, Anga spots her scaring the red pandas in the bamboo forest as the Lion Guard plans to stop her from terrorizing their habitat. As she retreats, Domog tells the other red pandas that [[Bunga]] is planning to stop Chuluun from attacking them as the red pandas and the Lion Guard plan to return to the Mountain where she lives. Bunga, along with the red pandas and the rest of the Lion Guard, arrives at the mountain where Chuluun is lurking as Bunga tells the red pandas to surround her while he takes on Chuluun himself. When Bunga uses his stench ability, Chuluun immediately falls off the ledge as the red pandas' cheer for Bunga's victory.
