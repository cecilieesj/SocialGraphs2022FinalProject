==Trivia==
*In addition to rapping, Tess enjoys playing basketball.
*Tess is similar to [[Eddie Thomas]] from ''That's So Raven'' as they're both rappers and basketball players.
*In the [[Baxter's Back!|first episode]] of the show, she said she believes in psychics as she believed Booker instantly as she was there when he went to tell Nia about him being psychic, making her the second person to know about him being psychic.
