'''Ezekiel''' is a character from the [[2011]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''.

==Background==
A paranoidic and superstitious crewman, Ezekiel served as a crewman of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' under command by notorious pirate captain [[Blackbeard|Edward Teach]]. During his moment at [[Whitecap Bay]], Ezekiel encountered a [[Mermaids of Whitecap Bay|mermaid]] named [[Tamara (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Tamara]] and attempted to kill her upon seeing the mermaids' hostile personality, realizing that the mermaids were actually hostile towards humans in their territory as part of Blackbeard's plans to help the crew find a mermaid and obtain her tears. Later, after Blackbeard's death, Ezekiel became part of [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]]'s crew where he and the surviving members of the ''Revenge'' joined him, as Barbossa and the surviving crewmen set sail for [[Tortuga]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''===
On board the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Ezekiel worked with the ship's crewmen working with a shanghaied [[Jack Sparrow]] who was dissatisfied with him sailing under [[Angelica]] and participated in Jack's mutiny. Jack's crew was victorious against the ambush until [[Blackbeard]] approaches the groups to which he hung all of the crewmen, alongside Ezekiel. Ezekiel and the rest of the crew later were let down to notice the Cook's punishment.

In a plan to to find a mermaid at [[Whitecap Bay]] and obtain her tears for the ritual, Ezekiel and the rest of the crew encounter mermaids where he realizes that the mermaids were actually trying to assault the crewmen where they were attempting to eat him. However, the crew manages to capture a surviving mermaid named "[[Syrena]]" after surviving a massive battle. Ezekiel later traveled through the Jungle Pools in finding the [[Fountain of Youth]] to which he and the rest of the crew obtain a tear from Syrena for the ritual.

Arriving at the Fountain, [[Hector Barbossa]] and his crew approach Ezekiel and the rest of the crew, followed by a battle occurring at the Fountain between the British soldiers and Blackbeard's crew until the [[Spaniard]] arrives to destroy the Fountain. After Blackbeard dies, Ezekiel and the rest of the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew later join Barbossa and had the ''Revenge'' set sail for [[Tortuga]].

==Trivia==
*Ezekiel shares the name with another character from the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise called "[[w:c:piratesonline:Captain Ezekiel Rott|Ezekiel Rott]]", a villain from the discontinued game, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]]''. It should be noted that Ezekiel from ''On Stranger Tides'' has a striking resemblance to him.
*It is said that in [[Terry Rossio]]'s original script for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'' that Ezekiel was present with many of the crew of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' before the script was changed in the final version of the film, resulting in Ezekiel being cut from the final version of the film.
