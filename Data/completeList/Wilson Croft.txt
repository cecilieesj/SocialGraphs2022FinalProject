|status=Arrested}}'''Professor Wilson Croft''' is one of the main antagonists of the [[1997]] film, ''[[Flubber]] ''(the other being Chester Hoenicker). He is established as a long-time rival of the protagonist, [[Philip Brainard|Professor Philip Brainard]], and often profited by stealing his ideas.

==Role in the film==
When introduced, Wilson is very blunt in his approach and declares his intent to not only continue stealing from Brainard but also takes his fiancée, [[Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds]], from him and make her his own (in effect, this means stealing even more from Brainard than he already has).
He is mean to Brainard because of his attraction of power, so that the High School where Brainard and Sara teach classes eventually gets under his command.

He eventually fails, after being hit multiple times by Sara and accidentally swallowing Flubber, making him feel a lot of weird sensations throughout his inner body before he farts Flubber out and faints, exhausted.

After this, Brainard saves the school; meanwhile, Wilson and the others are arrested.
