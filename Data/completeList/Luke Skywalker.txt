{{Quote|Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The [[Resistance|rebellion]] is reborn today. The war is just beginning, and I will not be the [[Rey|last Jedi]].|Luke Skywalker to [[Kylo Ren]]|Star Wars: The Last Jedi}}

'''Luke Skywalker''' is the protagonist of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' original trilogy. He later returns in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] and in multiple ''Star Wars''-related [[Disney+]] TV series. He is the son of [[Anakin Skywalker]]/[[Darth Vader]] and [[Padmé Amidala]], the twin brother of [[Leia Organa]], and the uncle of [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]].

Finding himself apprenticed to the Jedi Masters [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Yoda]], Luke soon becomes an important figure in the [[Rebel Alliance]]'s struggle against the [[Galactic Empire]]. In ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', he is a Jedi Master and the sole existing [[Jedi]], but right after his death in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', his new apprentice, [[Rey]], assumes the mantle.

==Background==
===Development===
In early drafts of the ''Star Wars'' story, Luke Skywalker's role of moisture farmboy-turned-Jedi hero was filled by Annikin Starkiller, a character who combined the traits of Luke and Prequel-era Anakin Skywalker. The name Starkiller was changed to "Skywalker", which had less violent connotations, late in the script's development. "Starkiller" later became the nickname of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, Galen Marek, in the video game ''The Force Unleashed''. The name of Starkiller would also later be used for the [[Starkiller Base|superweapon]] appearing in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.

===Personality===
Luke is resourceful, selfless, and brave, but is known to be impulsive, much like his father, [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Also like his father, he has a sense of justice, honor, and good morals. From his parents, Luke shares his rebelliousness and compassion with them, but as opposed to his sister, [[Leia Organa]], he has the ability to see the good in others and he is not a very good liar.

After Luke lost his right hand to [[Darth Vader]], Luke became far more calm, level-headed, and patient. Despite the fact that he obtained a far better control over his emotions and temper than his father did in his youth, Luke still has his moments of losing his patience and temper.

As a Jedi, Luke is shown to be highly intelligent and wise. He later sought to pass on his Jedi knowledge to a new generation of students. Luke is also willing to let people make a choice like when he was training [[Grogu]], an Order 66 survivor and Mandalorian foundling who Luke let choose between his Jedi training or coming back to his adoptive father, [[Din Djarin]]. Luke did this because he understands what it is like to be with a father figure. Despite this, upon training his students, Luke is sticks to the Jedi traditions and advises his apprentices to suppress any intense emotions and not hold to personal attachments.

However, after Luke's nephew, [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]], turned to the dark side (due to Ben feeling betrayed after seeing Luke with an ignited lightsaber over his head while he was asleep) and after [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|his Jedi Temple]] was destroyed, Luke became embittered and guilt-ridden, deeply grieving his failure. He chose to exile himself to the planet [[Ahch-To]], finally realizing the flaws in the Jedi teachings and seeing their legacy as a failure, Luke intended to die there to forever end the Jedi.

Luke became somewhat apathetic as he chose not to assist the [[Resistance]] just because he desired to remain in exile, despite the fact that he knew fully of the importance of the defeat of the [[First Order]]. He also became more stubborn, as evidenced by [[Rey]] failing to convince him to aid the Rebellion and teach her. It took him hearing Leia's old message to Obi-Wan Kenobi to convince him to teach Rey the ways of the Force, and even then it was only 3 lessons about why the Jedi should end. He also became explosive when angered, evidenced when he destroyed his hut in his anger of seeing Rey and Ben holding hands. 

Luke became more cautious in training others with tremendous levels of Force powers, evidenced when he became alarmed upon realizing that Rey's Force powers are equal to that of Ben's. He had believed that there is no hope for those who had fallen to the dark side, evidenced when he blatantly told Rey that Ben was lost.

However, after [[Yoda]] managed to convince him to accept and learn from his past mistakes, Luke ultimately chose to assist the Resistance and showed remorse for his failures when meeting Leia and later confronting Ben. He willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi and Resistance to survive, and died peacefully after seeing Ahch-To's twin suns descent into the horizon for the last time, making peace with his fate and forgiving himself for his failures.

Luke realized that his failure wasn't for training Ben in the ways of the Force, his failure was for not trusting his nephew and believing in his inner goodness, so he apologized to Ben for failing him.

===Powers and abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[The Force]]:''' Luke has an amazingly strong connection to the Force. As a member of the Skywalker bloodline, he is a Force-user born with a powerful family lineage. Luke's Force powers were rivaled by his father, [[Anakin Skywalker]], at his peak. By the time of the events of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', Luke's Force powers have been further greatly amplified to the point where he has genuinely become a threat to [[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]], the [[Knights of Ren]] and the [[First Order]].
**'''Telekinesis:''' Luke can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Luke was so proficient with telekinesis that he said to have pulled Imperial Star Destroyers out of the sky single-handedly.
***'''Force Push:''' Luke can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power was unleashed.
***'''Force Pull:''' Luke can telekinetically pull his opponents or objects towards him. He was able to pull a Dark Trooper right into the way of his lightsaber.
***'''Force Choke:''' Luke can telekinetically choke his opponents to either weaken, kill, or intimidate them.
***'''Force Repel:''' Luke can unleash a wave of pure Force-energy that knocks back anything within the power's blast radius or pushes multiple opponents simultaneously. Luke is proven to be powerful enough to completely shatter a stone hut housing Rey and himself, leaving only the foundation intact.
***'''Force Grip:''' Luke can telekinetically lift his opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them.
***'''Force Levitation:''' Using the Force, Luke can levitate himself in the air. He uses this to stop his fall during his brief fight with Rey, and later when he is projecting his consciousness to Crait.
***'''Force Throw:''' Luke can telekinetically cause objects and other individuals to be hurled toward a target at an astounding velocity.
***'''Force Crush:''' Luke can telekinetically crush objects or droids such as Dark Troopers.
**'''Telepathy:''' Luke can telepathically communicate with other individuals over small or vast distances, especially his father Anakin, and his sister Leia, both of whom he shares a familial and emotional connection with.
***'''Mind Trick:''' Luke can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.
***'''Mind Probe:''' Luke can telepathically sense and sift through the thoughts and memories of other sentient beings. This allowed him to scan the mind of a sleeping Ben Solo to discover that Snoke had been corrupting him with the dark side of the Force, sensing that the boy would go on to become a force for evil in the near future.
**'''Force Sense:''' Luke can sense other sentient beings' emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users. His senses are so powerful that he was able to sense the presence of his father, Anakin, on [[Endor]].
***'''Force Tracking:''' Luke was able to use the Force and [[Grogu]]'s connection to it, to find his location from across the galaxy. This allowed Luke to arrive and save both him and his friends, and to take him for training.
**'''Force Focus:''' Using the Force, Luke can calm himself down and completely block out his surroundings, this allows him perfect concentration, increases his dexterity and coordination, and eliminates any traces of doubt or fear. Not only does this help his already impressive natural piloting skills, but it allowed him to accurately fire his torpedoes at the Death Star exhaust port destroying it, a feat most deemed impossible.
**'''Force Vision:''' Luke can see visions of the past, present, and future. However, like all Force-users, his visions are not always clear or sometimes they happen without warning.
**'''Focused Rage:''' Luke can channel his anger to amplify his strength, durability, endurance, speed, ferocity, aggression, and the potency of his combat prowess/attacks. This allowed him to catch his conflicted father, Darth Vader, off-guard and defeat him in their final battle, although he nearly succumbed to the dark side because of it.
**'''Force Jump:''' Luke can jump or leap at great distances.
**'''Force Dash:''' Luke can move at amazing speeds.
**'''Sever Force:''' Luke can cut off his connection to the Force, which was why Snoke and Kylo Ren couldn't sense his presence while he was exiled on [[Ahch-To]]. According to Luke, it took him years to master Sever Force.
**'''Force Projection:''' Luke can create and project an illusion of himself that can be manifested all the way across the galaxy. Force projection is a power described in the [[sacred Jedi texts]], so Luke probably learned about it while studying them. During Kylo Ren's assault on [[Crait]] to destroy the Resistance, Luke used this power to distract his nephew long enough to allow the Resistance and Rey to escape. However, the effort it took to manifest such an illusion from such a distance took a tremendous toll on his body, which proved too much to bear and caused Luke to become one with the Force.
**'''Force Spirit:''' Due to Luke's immensely powerful connection to the Force and the ancient knowledge of the Jedi at his disposal, he was able to transcend physical death and preserve his identity through the Force. This allowed him to become one with the Force when he was killed by the strain of projecting himself across the galaxy to distract Kylo to allow the Resistance on Crait to escape the First Order.
*'''Advanced Agility:''' Luke is far more agile than normal Force-users and other sentient beings. Allowing him to perform amazing acrobatic feats, such as flips and spins, it also amplifies his natural balance.
*'''Advanced Reflexes:''' Luke's reflexes are much faster than normal Force-users and other sentient beings, being them superior to most Jedi. During the Battle of Crait, despite Luke's old age, he was able to dodge several of Kylo's lightsaber strikes (albeit as a Force projection) despite his nephew being much younger than him. Like his father, before him, this ability makes him an amazing pilot.
*'''Cybernetic Hand:''' Like his father before him, Luke utilizes his cybernetic hand in combat, as it gave him greater strength to easily subdue, restrain, and overpower his opponents.

====Abilities====
*'''Master Lightsaber Duelist:''' Luke is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist, with skills being rivaled by his father, [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Luke is proven to have a natural affinity for lightsaber combat. This was demonstrated after only one brief session with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], he was able to hold his own against his father Anakin, the then-ruthless Sith Lord [[Darth Vader]], a far more skilled and experienced lightsaber duelist. On three separate occasions during their first fight, although a it was short confrontation, his skills were proved to be inadequate and he was defeated with ease. In their second fight, which took place roughly four years later, Luke had greatly improved his lightsaber combat skills and he was able to hold his own for much of the duel, even managing to lightly wound Vader's right shoulder. However, ultimately Vader once again overpowered him and Luke lost the fight, as well as his lightsaber and right hand. In their final duel on the second Death Star, although with extreme effort, Luke was finally able to overwhelm and best Vader, due to the fact that Vader was caught off-guard. Due to [[Yoda]]'s tutelage, Luke was able to utilize his Force powers to not only amplify his physical speed and agility, but to also amplify the speed of his attacks as well as to make his lightsaber combat skills more lethal in combat, which made him a formidable opponent in single combat. In the beginning of his training, he relied on his Force sense and his reflexes to use the lightsaber, as revealed in the canonical story ''Showdown on Smuggler's Moon''. During Luke's tenure as a prisoner of the Jedi-obsessed Grakkus the Hutt, his skills were also inadvertently aided by Vader's spy, the stormtrooper and lightsaber combat expert Sergeant Kreel who masqueraded as Grakkus' gamemaster in an attempt to lure Luke into being captured by Vader. It is likely his skills and knowledge increased further after finding the hidden cave filled with Jocasta Nu's Holocrons, as seen in the final scene in Marvel Comics' ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: The Dying Light- Part IV''. By the time of the events of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', Luke's lightsaber combat skills have greatly improved to the point of mastery. Thus, he started to train the next generation of Jedi Knights, but his plans were greatly delayed after the destruction of [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|his Jedi Temple]]. Even after years of retirement in exile, Luke's lightsaber combat skills have not diminished, as evidenced by the fact how he was able to handle a furious [[Rey]] and briefly disarm her, when she attacked him out of disgust after learning from [[Kylo Ren]] that Luke made an attempt on his life. During the Battle of [[Crait]], Luke used just a Force projection of himself and he was able to best Kylo relatively easily, due to the fact that he is a far more skilled and experienced lightsaber duelist than his hot-headed nephew.
**'''Form II:''' Luke is very skilled in Shii-Cho.
**'''Form II:''' Luke is very skilled in Makashi.
**'''Form III:''' Luke is very skilled in Soresu.
**'''Form IV:''' Luke is very skilled in Ataru.
**'''Form V:''' At first, Luke only has some skills in Shien/Djem So. Within only four years' time since picking up a lightsaber during the events leading to the Battle of Yavin, Luke's skills with Form V eventually improved to the point where he was able to face Darth Vader on equal terms and eventually best him, due to the fact that Vader was caught off-guard.
**'''Form VI:''' Luke is highly skilled in Niman.
**'''Form VII:''' Luke is highly skilled in Juyo/Vaapad
**'''Jar'Kai:''' Luke has some skills in Jar'Kai.
*'''Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' Luke is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant.
*'''Expert Marksman:''' Luke is highly skilled in utilizing blaster pistols.
*'''Expert Pilot:''' Luke is extremely skilled in piloting various speeders and most types of flying crafts.
*'''Genius-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Leader:''' Luke is amazingly intelligent and wise. As the Jedi Master of a [[Jedi|new generation of Jedi Apprentices]], Luke is a wise mentor and leader.
*'''Intimidation:''' As an immensely powerful Force-user, Luke commends an intimidating presence to the point that many of his enemies across the galaxy fear him.
*'''Meditation:''' Luke can further amplify his connection to the Force with a clear mind by meditating.
*'''Multilingual:''' Luke is capable of fluently speaking Basic, Binary, Huttese, Jawa Trade language, Shyriiwook, and Yuzz. He also claims to know twelve other common languages as well.
*'''Loremaster:''' Luke has a deep knowledge of Jedi and Sith lore.

===Weapons and Equipment===
As a valued member of the Rebel Alliance, Luke possesses an array of weapons and equipment to assist him along the way.

====Lightsabers====
As a Jedi, Luke's valued weapons and possessions are his blue and green-bladed lightsabers. So far, he has had two lightsabers. Luke's first lightsaber is comprised of Solid Heavy-Duty and Black alloy, well his second lightsaber is comprised of Chrome and Black alloy.
*'''[[Lightsaber|Skywalker Lightsaber]]:''' Upon arriving at [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s home on [[Tatooine]], the elder [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] gave Luke the lightsaber used by his father, [[Anakin Skywalker]]. The weapon was indeed the one that Obi-Wan took from Anakin after the intense fight on [[Mustafar]]. During his fight with [[Darth Vader]] on Bespin, Luke lost both his lightsaber and his right hand. However, it resurfaced on [[Jakku]] and ended up in the possession of [[Maz Kanata]], that passed it on to [[Finn]] after [[Rey]] refused the weapon when it was calling to her. However, Rey later claimed its possession during the fight with [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]] in the forest of Starkiller Base. This weapon is powered by a blue [[kyber crystal]]. It was later presented to Luke by Rey as a sign he was needed once again, but he wanted nothing to with it.
*'''[[Lightsaber|Second Lightsaber]]:''' After Luke lost his father's lightsaber on [[Bespin]], he eventually returned home to Tatooine, where he not only planned to rescue [[Han Solo]], but also to return to Obi-Wan's abandoned hut on Tatooine and construct a new lightsaber. His new lightsaber was based on his first mentor's weapon. After completing the weapon, he placed it in [[R2-D2]]. The weapon was seen throughout all of ''Star Ware: Return of the Jedi'', and Luke used it throughout his life. Unlike it's predecessor, this lightsaber has a thick green blade that is powered by a kyber crystal. After Ben Solo fell to the dark side, Luke brought his and Leia's lightsabers going into exile on the planet [[Ahch-To]] where he had stopped using the lightsaber. After Luke's death, his lightsaber was gathered alongside the rest of his belongings by the Caretakers and stored on the island's repository.

====Blaster====
*'''[[Blaster (Star Wars)|Model 57 blaster pistol]]:''' Before completely utilizing the lightsaber as his weapon of choice, Luke used a Model 57 blaster pistol, a weapon similar to Han Solo's DL-44 heavy blaster pistol, along with his pilot uniform. This weapon was never seen again after ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back''.

==Film Appearances==
===''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith''===
Luke and his sister, [[Leia Organa|Leia]], are born mere hours after his father, Darth Vader (formerly Anakin Skywalker) was defeated by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] on [[Mustafar]]. His mother, [[Padmé Amidala]] is heartbroken at Anakin's turn to the dark side, and dies after giving birth to them. On Yoda's consent, Luke is sent to live with his step-uncle [[Owen Lars]] and his wife, [[Beru Whitesun]], whilst his sister is sent to Senator [[Bail Organa]] for her own safety on Alderaan.

===''Star Wars: A New Hope''===
Luke spends nineteen years on [[Tatooine]] with Owen and Beru, who tell him that his father is a navigator on a spice freighter who died. One day, he and Owen go to get some droids to help on their farm from a Jawa sandcrawler passing through their area, and they pick a protocol droid called [[C-3PO]] and an astromech droid. The astromech droid, however, malfunctions, and C-3PO recommends his astromech friend, [[R2-D2]]. Later on that night, while cleaning R2-D2, Luke finds a message that shows Princess Leia Organa requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke wonders if she meant Ben Kenobi, a hermit who lives near the Dune Sea in the Jundland Wastes. He asks his uncle and aunt about it, but they refuse to talk about it, possibly after being told by Obi-Wan of Anakin's fall to the dark side when he first left Luke with them years ago. Luke goes out and looks at the two suns of Tatooine as they set on the horizon.

[[File:Luke skywalker binary sunset.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Luke watching the binary sunset.]]
The next day, Luke finds that R2 had left overnight, and he and 3PO go out to find him, having chosen not to pursue him after dark with all the Tusken Raiders prowling after nightfall. They find him near a camp of Sandpeople, and while Luke is getting a closer look, he is attacked by one. He is saved by a man in robes who frightens the Sandpeople scavenging his landspeeder away, and then recognizes him as Ben Kenobi, who had rescued him and Biggs Darklighter a few years back. Ben brings them back to his house, where he looks at the message and reveals he is Obi-Wan, and has been in hiding for years. He tells Luke that his father, Anakin, was actually a Jedi Knight killed by a Jedi turned Sith called Darth Vader. He shows and gives Luke Anakin's old lightsaber, and offers to train him in the ways of the Force, but Luke refuses.

They then find the same Jawas, who sold the droids to Luke, had been killed by the Empire, and Luke realizes their search would lead them to his house. Back home, he finds his home destroyed and his family dead. Seeing as he has nothing left on Tatooine, he decides to go with Obi-Wan and become a Jedi. They go to Mos Eisley Spaceport to find a pilot to bring them to Alderaan, and while at the bar, two men named Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba pick a fight with Luke, but Obi-Wan cuts off Ponda's arm and wounds Evazan in the stomach, and the two flee. They meet a pilot named [[Han Solo]] and his Wookiee friend [[Chewbacca]], and they agree to take them to Alderaan in their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. On the way to the ship, they are attacked by [[Stormtroopers]], but make it out unharmed. On the way to Alderaan, Luke begins to train, and Han reveals he does not believe in the Force.

They reach where Alderaan is supposed to be, only to find it is gone. Luke sees what he thinks is a small moon, but Obi-Wan says that it is actually a space station called the [[Death Star]]. A tractor beam pulls them on board, but Luke and Han disguise as Stormtroopers, and they go to a security room where they find the cell Leia is in. Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, C-3PO and R2-D2 stay in the security room, and Luke is able to convince a doubtful Han to help rescue Leia, and they pretend Chewbacca is their prisoner. They eventually find Leia in the Detention Block, but Stormtroopers begin to shoot at them, and they escape through the garbage chute. While down there, a Dianoga grabs Luke, but the others are able to rescue him as the walls start closing in. However, C-3PO, who is worrying, accidentally left the comlink off but turn it back on and shuts down the walls and saves the group. When the group reach the hangar, they see Obi-Wan dueling Darth Vader, and Obi-Wan allows Vader to hit him, killing him. The group escape on the ''Falcon'', and Luke grieves for Obi-Wan.

[[File:TIE-Fighter-Attack-3.png|250px|left|thumb|Luke manning one of the ''Millennium Falcon'''s turrets.]]
On the way back to [[Yavin 4]], home of the Rebellion's current headquarters, the ''Falcon'' is attacked by a squad of TIE fighters. Luke and Han shoot them all down, and they successfully make it to Yavin 4. They give the Rebel Alliance the plans to the Death Star, and Luke is one of the pilots sent to destroy it. Before he leaves on the mission, he meets his old friend, Biggs Darklighter, who is also a part of the mission and vouches for Luke when asked by their commanding officer, Red Leader Garven Dreis, if Luke can handle flying one of the Rebellion's [[X-Wing|X-wings]] in real combat. He then finds that Han is leaving because he has got his reward money for saving Leia, and he has to pay [[Jabba the Hutt]] back.

As the Battle of Yavin begins, many of the Rebel pilots are killed, including Red Leader Dreis, Gold Leader Jon Vander, and Biggs. Eventually, it is only Luke and Wedge Antilles left along with a lone [[Y-Wing|Y-wing]] pilot. Wedge's ship is damaged by one of Vader's wingmen, and Luke tells him to go back before he is killed. Vader permits Wedge to escape as his attention was on Luke as the leader of the final trench run. As Luke makes his way to the thermal exhaust port in the Death Star that he has to shoot his proton torpedoes into, Darth Vader is flying his personal [[TIE Advanced x1]] behind him, and fires at him. The first salvo only manages to hit and disable R2-D2, acting as Luke's astromech on his X-wing. Before he can kill Luke as he fires a second barrage, he is forced to cease fire when Han and Chewbacca come and shoot one of Darth Vader's wingmen, causing the other to panic and clip Vader's TIE Advanced, causing it to spin into space. Before that, Vader realizes Luke is strong with the Force as Luke is guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan. With his guidance, he is able to destroy the Death Star. Back on Yavin 4, Luke and Han are awarded for their courage by Leia and congratulated by their fellow Rebels.

===''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back''===
Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the [[Galactic Empire]] have been chasing the [[Rebel Alliance]] from planet to planet in hopes of victory. Since the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader has been trying to find Luke, believing the Force is strong in him after sensing it back during the battle. Thanks to Luke and a group of Rebel freedom fighters, the Rebels are using the icy planet [[Hoth]] as a new base. While Luke is out securing the perimeter on his Tauntaun, he is attacked by a Wampa and brought back to its cave. He wakes up to find he is hanging upside down, and his lightsaber is stuck in the snow. He tries to use the Force to grab his lightsaber, and when he has it, he cuts himself down. The Wampa comes in to stop him from escaping becoming its next meal, but Luke slices off its arm, and runs out into the snow trying to return to Echo Base while the Wampa howls in pain from being unceremoniously amputated, but due to his injuries from the Wampa and the frigid cold as night falls on Hoth with subzero temperatures, he collapses. While lying in the snow, he sees a vision of Obi-Wan telling him to go to the [[Dagobah]] system to find Jedi Master [[Yoda]], just before he passes out. Luckily, Han comes to rescue him and cuts open his deceased Tauntaun with Luke's lightsaber, putting him inside it to keep him warm until Han can set up a shelter and wait out the night until morning, when they can be found by the Rebel snowspeeders.

[[File:LukeSnowspeeder.jpeg|250px|thumb|Luke in the Battle of Hoth.]]
Luke wakes up in the medical center back at Echo Base while Leia and Han are arguing, and Leia kisses Luke. Luke gets ready for the Battle of Hoth as the Empire, who had located the base thanks to a viper probe droid, prepare for a ground battle as the Rebellion attempts to evacuate with as much men and materials as they can before Echo Base is overrun by Imperial forces. Taking lead of Rogue Squadron in their snowspeeders, Luke leads them against the thickly-armored Imperial All Terrain Armored Transports (AT-ATs). Quickly into the battle, Luke's co-pilot, Dak Ralter, is killed, and Luke tries to survive on his own. He has Wedge, flying as his wingman, wrap a tow cable around the legs of one AT-AT and bring it down before a well-aimed strike to its lightly-armored neck destroys it, but then crashes himself after his snowspeeder is hit by flak from the AT-AT blasters, barely escaping with a handheld tow cable before his snowspeeder is crushed underfoot by one of the Imperial walkers. He grapples up to another AT-AT and cuts a hole in it with his lightsaber, and throws a grenade in, and then drops back into the snow before it explodes, blowing the head of the AT-AT to pieces before it topples over into the snow on its side. After the battle, he and R2 leave Hoth in his X-wing after Wedge calls after Luke and wishes him good luck before meeting him at the Rebel rendezvous point, but instead of going to the rendezvous point, they go to Dagobah to find Yoda.

Luke crash lands on Dagobah, and finds that it is a swamp. After he settles in, he begins to eat when a small green creature startles him, causing him to pull out his blaster. After the creature assures he means no harm, Luke tells him he is looking for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The creature says he knows who Yoda is, and he would take him to him. While eating in the creature's hut, Luke snaps saying that they are wasting time. The creature begins to say that Luke is impatient, and Luke wonders who he is talking to. He then hears Obi-Wan's voice, and deduces that the creature is Jedi Master Yoda, and asks him to train him. After some persuasion, Yoda agrees, and they begin to train. Luke gets frustrated when Yoda asks him to move his sunken ship with the Force, and asks him to try, but to his amazement, Yoda does it and tells him that there is no try, he does or does not, and if he does not believe he can do it, that is why he fails where Yoda succeeds. Later, Luke goes into a part of the swamp where he brings only his lightsaber. While there, he sees a shadow approaching, and realizes it is Darth Vader. The two begins to duel, with Luke cutting of Vader's head, only to see it explode and reveal his own face. He realizes this is a vision, and goes back to Yoda. While he is training, Luke sees a vision of his friends suffering in a city of clouds. He decides to go and help them, much to Yoda's disapproval. The spirit of Obi-Wan appears and tells him to not fall to the dark side like Vader did.

[[File:The-Empire-Strikes-Back-2.png|250px|left|thumb|Luke about to fight Vader.]]
Luke and R2 arrive in [[Bespin]], but they are quickly split up when Luke tries to pursue Leia, Chewbacca, and 3PO, despite Leia yelling to him that he is walking into a trap. Luke finds his friends, who had been betrayed by Han's friend [[Lando Calrissian]], being held prisoner by the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] and some Stormtroopers. They begin to shoot at him, but he makes it out safely. He goes into a chamber, but is locked in by Darth Vader, and the two begin to duel. Vader herds Luke into the carbon-freezing pit per his plan to have Luke frozen in carbonite to take to the Emperor, but Luke swings out. Luke does not have enough experience to fight Vader, but he still fights nobly. During the duel, a glass window breaks, releasing a vacuum that begins to suck them both out. Vader knocks Luke in, but he is able to hold onto a balcony for survival. Eventually, Vader has Luke cornered on a very high balcony, and cuts his right hand off, and it goes plummeting down along with his lightsaber. Having Luke trapped and at his mercy, Vader taunts him about how he does not know the true power of the dark side. Vader asks Luke if Obi-Wan told him what happened to his father, and Luke replies that he told him Vader killed him. However, Vader denies it, saying he ''is'' his father. Luke is horrified when he hears this, and yells in disbelief and horror. Vader then gives him the option to join the dark side or die. Luke knows he can never betray his friends, and jumps down, goes through a tunnel, and hangs on to a weather vane for survival. He calls out for Leia, and she, who is on the ''Falcon'' with Chewbacca, Lando, C-3PO, and R2-D2, hears him, and they go back and rescue him, escaping Bespin, but find the Imperial Navy flagship, the ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought ''Executor'', waiting for them in space, preparing to capture them with their tractor beam. During this time, Vader makes contact with Luke through the Force, asking to come with him, but Luke can only wonder why Obi-Wan hid this vital information from him. R2 manages to reactivate the hyperdrive, and the ''Falcon'' escapes capture as it takes off into hyperspace.

Back on a Rebel medical ship with the Alliance Navy, Luke gets a prosthetic hand and learns that Vader froze Han in carbonite and gave him to Boba Fett, who is taking him to Jabba's Palace back on Tatooine, presumably to collect the bounty Jabba placed on Han for failing to repay him. Lando and Chewie call saying they will find Han and Boba Fett, and Luke wishes that the Force be with them. He, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 all look out into space as the ''Falcon'' departs while the Rebel fleet continues onward.

===''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi''===
Luke sends R2-D2 and C-3PO with a hologram of him making a deal to sell the droids in exchange for a frozen Han Solo. Jabba refuses upon being told by his majordomo Bib Fortuna not to bargain as Luke was no Jedi, and takes the droids anyway. He later comes to rescue his friends, who had been captured in Jabba's Palace due to a rescue plan gone wrong. He tries to negotiate with Jabba, but Jabba tricks him and opens the trapdoor he is standing on, thus leading him to the rancor pit. Although he does not have his lightsaber, he is able to activate a door that comes down and kills the rancor. Jabba then sentences him, Han, and Chewie to be fed to the [[Sarlacc]] at the Great Pit of Carkoon. C-3PO, who is forced to work for Jabba, asks if Luke has any last words, and he replies that Jabba can let them go now or die, but his threats result in laughter from Jabba and everyone on board his sail barge. R2-D2, who is on Jabba's sail barge, shoots Luke's lightsaber to him, and he begins to massacre Jabba's thugs on the small carriers he, Han, Chewie, and a disguised Lando are on. Although Han is temporarily blind, a side effect of the carbon-freezing, he is able to hit Boba Fett with one of Jabba's guards' polearms, thus sending him into the pit. Luke goes onto the sail barge and rescues Leia, who had just killed Jabba before being freed by R2, who then rescues 3PO from Salicious Crumb, and they swing onto the carrier the group are on, and fly away as the barge explodes after Luke and Leia turned the deck gun on it.

While the others go to the Rebel rendezvous near the planet Sullust, Luke and R2-D2 return to Dagobah to complete Luke's training. While there, he finds Yoda dying of old age and declining health, and asks if he can complete his training, but Yoda tells him he has no more training. He has to face Darth Vader to become a Jedi to complete his training. Luke asks if Vader is his father, and Yoda confirms it, but before he dies, he tells Luke there is another Skywalker and to beware of the Emperor's power, or he'll end up like Vader. He then vanishes, becoming one with the Force, and Luke leaves. While outside, he sees the spirit of Obi-Wan, and he asks why he told him Vader killed his father. Obi-Wan says that from a certain point of view, he was right meaning the evil Anakin Skywalker killed the good one and became Darth Vader. Luke refuses to kill his father. Luke then asks what Yoda meant by another Skywalker. Obi-Wan tells him that he has a twin sister who he was separated from as a baby to be safe from the Empire. Luke deduces that it is Leia, and leaves. Obi-Wan tells him if he does not kill Vader, then all is lost, and the Emperor has already won the Galactic Civil War.

[[File:Star-wars6-movie-screencaps.com-7159.jpg|thumb|250px|Luke on Endor.]]
Luke goes back to the rendezvous and agrees to be part of Han's strike team for the Forest Moon of [[Endor]]. They find out that the Empire is building the second Death Star, and they would have to take out the shield generator so Lando's team can get to it. On the way to Endor, Luke sees the Imperial Navy flagship, the ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought ''Executor'', and he senses Darth Vader is on-board, fearful he is endangering the mission by coming. Han is able to pass by easily, and they land on Endor. While exploring the forest, they encounter a squad of scout troopers, and Han's attempt to take them out quietly fails, so Luke and Leia chase three on speeders. Luke rides with Leia, but he is able to take the speeder of another one, and he and Leia split up. Luke then crashes his and jumps off, and reflects the trooper's blasts with his lightsaber, before slicing the front end of the speeder bike off, leaving the scout trooper to spin out of control before crashing into a tree trunk. When Luke meets with the group, he finds that Leia is missing, and they begin to search for her. While searching, they find a dead animal hung up, and Chewie runs to it, thus setting off a trap, and they are all hung in a net up high. Then little furry creatures called [[Ewoks]] come out and bring them to their village as prisoners, with C-3PO as an exception, as they treat him like a god. The Ewoks plan on cooking and eating them, but C-3PO tries to stop it, but to no avail. Luke tell him to say that if they do not let them go, then he will be very angry and use his powers on them. Luke makes it believable by using the Force to lift C-3PO up, and the Ewoks are convinced enough to set them free. They find out that is where Leia was staying, and they all have a party as C-3PO tells the Ewoks the story of what had happened since Luke joined the Rebellion, convincing the Ewoks to lend their support to the Rebel cause, considering the Empire's presence on the forest moon an outrage to their livelihood. A saddened Luke, however, leaves in the middle, and Leia goes outside to see if he is okay. Here, Luke reveals to her that Vader is his father and she is his sister. Leia says that somehow she always knows that. Luke says that the longer he is with the group, he would be putting them in danger, and leaves to face Vader.

[[File:DarthVaderLuke.png|250px|thumb|left|Luke is brought before the Emperor.]]
Luke allows himself to be captured by the Empire, and is brought to Darth Vader at a landing pad by an AT-AT. Luke tries to convince him to join the light side, but Vader says that Anakin Skywalker is dead and he will always be Darth Vader.

Vader then takes Luke to see [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] in his throne room on the second Death Star. When they arrive, the Emperor orders his guards to leave, and he and Luke begin to talk. Eventually, the Emperor shows Luke that he has set up the Rebels, and they are prepared for the attack. He makes Luke watch his friends be killed trying to destroy the second Death Star. He gives Luke the opportunity to take his lightsaber and kill him, but Luke refuses. With the Emperor continuously taunting him, Luke gives in and uses the Force to take his lightsaber; but as he is about to strike, Vader blocks the blow with his own lightsaber, and they duel once again as the Emperor cackles viciously.

At one point, Luke jumps onto a high balcony, and when he refuses to give in to the dark side, Vader throws his lightsaber at the balcony, causing Luke to lose his balance and fall off. Still refusing to fight Vader, Luke hides in the darkness, and Vader tries to anger him into coming out. When Vader says that if Luke would not turn, he would try to turn Leia instead, Luke reaches his breaking point at the prospect of his twin sister joining the Sith. Luke flies into a fury and attacks Vader. Luke eventually overpowers his father and has Vader cornered at a balcony, where he cuts off his dueling hand in the same manner as Vader did to ''him'' in the previous film. The Emperor wants Luke to kill Vader, but after coming to his senses and realizing he is about to follow his father down the path of the dark side, Luke refuses, deactivating his lightsaber and tossing it aside, saying he is a Jedi like his father before him. Having given up his hope of keeping both Luke and Vader as apprentices, the Emperor shoots lightning out of his hands, trying to kill Luke, but when Vader sees Luke in pain, he cannot bear to see his own son suffer. Vader grabs the Emperor and tosses him down a vast pit, thus killing him and fulfilling the Chosen One prophecy as he destroys the Sith and becomes Anakin Skywalker again, avenging [[Padmé Amidala|Padmé]] and his past sins. Luke brings the mortally wounded Vader back to a ship, and wants to bring him to Endor, but Vader asks Luke to take off his mask so he can look at his son with his own two eyes. Luke does so and sees a scarred, pale white face that has not seen daylight for years since his duel on Mustafar with Obi-Wan. Luke silently cries as Anakin passes away, and he gets on a shuttle and leaves with his father's body just as Lando destroys the second Death Star.

Back on Endor, there is a celebration in honor of the defeat of the Empire, which Luke joins after lighting a funeral pyre for his father. While at the party, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin. They all smile as they look at Luke, and he smiles back.

===''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''===
[[File:Luke TFA.jpg|thumb|250px|The elderly Luke Skywalker in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''.]]
Luke does not make a physical appearance for almost the entire film. However, he is mentioned by his old friend and brother-in-law [[Han Solo]] and several others. Sometime after the Battle of Endor and the Battle of Jakku, Luke became a Jedi Master and tried to establish a New Jedi Order by training a new generation of Jedi Knights, the first of Luke's students was his nephew Ben Solo and several other Force-users. Unfortunately, his nephew fall to the dark side, as Snoke preyed on Ben's internal conflict. The Jedi Temple where he was training the new generation of Jedi was destroyed during the same night Ben turned to the dark side. Ben would follow Snoke as his new master and later join the [[Knights of Ren]], becoming known as [[Kylo Ren]].

Luke managed to survive and escape the Jedi Temple's destruction, but this devastating tragedy greatly delayed his plan to restore the Jedi Order to its former glory. In the aftermath, Luke was deeply grieved and wracked with guilt, blaming himself for his students' deaths and Ben's turn to the dark side. Luke then mysteriously disappeared, vanishing into self-imposed exile as he chose to seek out the [[First Jedi Temple]]. 

The [[First Order]], under the orders of [[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]], are to find and kill Luke, as Snoke knows that as long as Luke is alive, a new generation of Jedi Knights can rise again. Luke finally makes a physical appearance at the end of the film, but does not speak; Luke is found on the planet [[Ahch-To]], which is dotted with islands, by the Force-sensitive scavenger [[Rey]], and his friends [[R2-D2]] and [[Chewbacca]]. Rey presents Luke with his [[Anakin Skywalker|father]]'s [[lightsaber]], showing the elderly Jedi Master that he is needed once more and that he stands as the last hope in the galaxy.

===''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''===
Luke, after a brief look at his father's second lightsaber, tossed it away and left the Plateu, but was followed by Rey, who wanted him to train her and aid in defeating the First Order. Luke blatantly refused to train Rey in the ways of the Jedi or help the Resistance, declaring that the Jedi Order needed to end with him. A persistent Rey held hope that the legendary Jedi Master would teach her and refused to leave Ahch-To, even after learning from Chewbacca that Han was dead (which he did not know before, due to cutting himself from the Force), it was only through encouragement from R2-D2 that Luke began to train Rey. But in her first lessons, Rey allowed the dark side in and Luke refused to teach her further.

While communicating with Kylo Ren through their Force-bond, Rey learned that Luke had tried to kill his nephew in his sleep. After Luke discovered Rey and Kylo touching hands and intently staring each other inside a hut, he became furious and ordered Rey to leave the island. Rey confronted and dueled Luke about the truth of Ben Solo's turn to the dark side, and he admitted that he was tempted to kill his nephew after discovering he had been seduced by the dark side. This caused Ben to wake up and try to fight him with his lightsaber before destroying the hut, burying him beneath it. As Luke woke up to find his Jedi Temple burning, he believed that Ben destroyed the new Jedi Order and took half of his apprentices with him. Believing himself responsible for Ben's fall, Luke came searching for Ahch-To so that he could die and end the Jedi Order with him.

After knowing the truth, Rey told Luke that he was wrong when he thought that Ben had already chosen the dark side as he sensed the darkness in him while he was sleeping, and that she felt the conflict within Kylo when they touched hands. Rey tried to convince Luke that Kylo Ren could be turned and that she would try to bring Ben back to the light. Luke disagreed and told her that this would not end as she thought. Rey then offered his father's saber to him again as one last attempt to invite him to fight with the Resistance. Luke refused the lightsaber again, causing Rey to declare that Ben Solo was the last hope before leaving the island to meet Kylo Ren.

As Rey left Ahch-To, Luke attempted to destroy the [[Tree Library|tree]] that had the [[Sacred Jedi texts|original sacred Jedi texts]]. But before he did it, [[Yoda]]'s Force spirit destroyed the tree with a lightning bolt. Yoda tried to advise Luke to accept his past mistakes to become a better teacher for Rey. Inspired by Yoda's words, Luke Force projected himself to the planet [[Crait]] to distract Ben and the First Order long enough for what remained of the Resistance to escape on the ''Millennium Falcon''. Luke toyed with Ben before revealing himself to be a projection and proclaimed that he would haunt Ben and that he would not be the last Jedi, before disappearing. Exhausted, Luke climbed back atop the meditation rock, gazed at the binary sunset, and finally at peace, passed away and became one with the Force.

===''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''===
Luke comes back as a Force spirit to continue mentoring Rey in her battle against the Sith and the First Order. After her duel with Kylo Ren on the ruins of the second Death Star and Leia's death, Luke appears to Rey when she throws the Skywalker saber at the fire that is burning Kylo's [[TIE Whisper|TIE whisper]]. Luke encourages her to continue to fight instead of exiling herself on [[Ahch-To]] as he did before. He admits that he was wrong in isolating himself and tells her to confront her fears. He then gives Rey Leia's lightsaber and his old T-65B X-wing ''Red Five'' so she can get to Exegol to face Emperor Palpatine. At the end of the film, he and Leia are seen as Force spirits on Tatooine watching over Rey.

Luke tracked Grogu and his allies to Moff Gideon's light star-cruiser, where Grogu was kidnapped and being recused.

Sensing something is wrong Luke gently placed his hand on Grogu and looked into his memories from Order 66 and after Grogu woke up he promised him to teach him self dense in a dangerous galaxy. Luke was spotted by Din and Ahoska Tano when she was persauding Din to let Grogu make his own choices which he accepted and gave her Grogu's chain mail armour for him.

Before they leave, Ben shows Luke the lightsaber that Anakin used, telling him that Vader killed his father. Eventually, the group get enough credit to buy the Millennium Falcon from Jabba the Hutt, and begin to search for Alderaan. However, when they get to its spot, they find that it had already been destroyed by the Death Star, and then the Millennium Falcon gets sucked in by the Death Star's tractor beam.

==Trivia==
*[[Robby Benson]] auditioned to play Luke, but lost this role to Mark Hamill.
*In [[2008]], the character was selected by Empire magazine as the 54th greatest movie character of all time.
*Luke's last name was originally "Starkiller". This was the inspiration for both Darth Vader's apprentice Starkiller in the non-canon video game ''The Force Unleashed'' and [[Starkiller Base]] in the sequel trilogy. According to Mark Hamill, the name change came late enough in filming that the scene of Luke saying "I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you" had to be reshot.
*Luke is listed at number 14, of the Fandomania.com 100 Greatest Fictional Characters.
*In ''A New Hope'', Luke's line "I can't see a thing in this helmet" was not scripted. [[Mark Hamill]] said this to [[Harrison Ford]] when he thought the cameras had stopped rolling, but the filmmakers decided to leave the line in.
*In ''Star Wars'' Legends, Luke has a wife named {{WikipediaLink|Mara Jade}} and a son named Ben Skywalker.
*In the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode ''[[Twin Beaks]]'', [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] referred to [[Launchpad McQuack]] as Duck Skywalker.
*Luke's teachings and methods in restoring the Jedi Order contrast heavily between the Canon and Legends continuities.
**In Canon, Luke adheres to the previous Jedi doctrine of forgoing all attachments, while his Legends counterpart endorsed his students forming bonds with others, including marriage, while also training them how to not selfishly cling to those bonds like his father did.
**The Canon version of Luke's new Jedi Order seems to retain the mandatory wearing of traditional robes, while the Legends version had no definite dress code and permitted its members to wear casual clothing, armor, and even permitted them to wield weapons aside from lightsabers.
**In Canon, similar to the Jedi of the Republic Era, Luke only accepted initiates that were too young to have already formed attachments, while the Legends version of his character usually inducted teenagers and young adults who had already formed attachments.
**In Canon, Luke used traditional Jedi training methods used by the previous order, while his Legends version preferred to have his students learn from experience rather than through mere teachings alone.
**Unlike Luke's Legends version that believed anyone had the ability to be redeemed from the dark side, the Canon version upholds the traditional Jedi belief that most could never hope to be freed from its influence.
