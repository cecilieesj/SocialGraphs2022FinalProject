==Role in the Series==
===''[[Can't Wait to be Queen]]''===
When [[Simba]] hears that Aminifu has passed away, he tells his cubs [[Kion]] and [[Kiara]] that he helped the Pride Lands get things back to normal after [[Scar]] got defeated for once he and his herd were the first to return, all the other animals followed them and the Circle of Life went back into balance. So the elephants hold a funeral for him in Kilio Valley. As is customary for the King of the [[Pride Lands]], Simba makes the journey to Kilio Valley with his mate, [[Nala]], and majordomo, [[Zazu]], to attend Aminifu's funeral and perform a speech in his honor.

However, things go slightly awry when Simba accidentally states that 'he had poop on him' in elephantese instead of the elephant idiom, 'he had good on him'. Whilst Simba is worried, Aminifu's daughter, Ma Tembo, bursts into laughter, followed by the rest of her herd. She explains that he did indeed always have poop on him and that he always made her laugh. She thanks the king for helping them to remember the good times, as they continue to do so.

==Trivia==
* He is the third deceased character in the series following [[Mufasa]] and [[Scar]].
*The music that plays during Aminifu's funeral was later used in the Season 3 episode "[[Long Live the Queen]]" where the music that plays during [[Janna]]'s funeral is the same one from "Can't Wait to be Queen", though with different animals putting flowers on Janna's grave instead of the elephants.
