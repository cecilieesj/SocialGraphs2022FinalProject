===Disney Kingdoms===
In [[Disney Kingdoms: Enchanted Tiki Room]], Fritz has a romantic subplot. When a flock of blue-footed boobie birds flies over the island, a female named Crystal ends up gaining the ability to speak by the Tiki Room's magic. She is attracted to Pierre's plumage and falls in love with him, and Pierre ends up developing his own crush on her. But when she finds that her flock is frightened by her newfound ability to speak, Crystal asks for the enchantment to be undone. Taking part in a ritual with the Tiki Gods to remove the gift, Crystal has one last moment with Pierre as the magic wears off and he tries proposing to her, though she insists as a migrating bird that she cannot stay.
