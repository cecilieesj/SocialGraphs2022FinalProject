'''Br'er Terrapin''' (also known as '''Br'er Turtle''') is a character from the [[1946]] [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film, ''[[Song of the South]]'' and other media inspired by the film itself.

==Background==
Br'er Terrapin is an anthropomorphic turtle often seen wearing a cap on his head and a vest on his shell respectively. Like all the Br'ers and Sises from the stories, Br'er Terrapin is an animated turtle from the stories told by [[Uncle Remus]] (despite not appearing in any of the sequences with cartoon backgrounds).

===Origins===
Br'er Terrapin is based on the character (whose original spelling is "'''Br'er Tarrypin'''" , a play on the word "terrapin" which is a term used for several small species of turtles) of the same name from the Uncle Remus stories often portrayed as a recurring character within the original stories who is a friend of Br'er Rabbit who joins him in mischief to which the former becomes succesful at him in times.

==Appearances==

===''[[Song of the South]]''===
Br'er Terrapin is seen at the end of the film during a reprise of "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" where he runs past Teenchy, Ginny Favers' pet dog  and as he follows the live-action children happily strolling along with the animated characters, he encounters [[Br'er Frog]] and [[Br'er Rabbit]] whom Br'er Terrapin follows. Br'er Terrapin approaches Br'er Rabbit to which the latter runs past him (causing him to drop his cap) just as Br'er Terrapin catches up with Uncle Remus, the children, and the animated characters, following them into the sunset marking the end of the film.

==Printed material==

===''Br'er Rabbit Gets Tricked''===
Despite his brief appearance in the film, Br'er Terrapin (under his name "Br'er Turtle") appears in the [[Disney's Wonderful World of Reading]] book, ''Br'er Rabbit Gets Tricked'' where he plays a prominent role in the story<ref>https://www.songofthesouth.net/memorabilia/detail.php?id=109</ref>. Br'er Turtle first appears watching Br'er Rabbit strolling across the path to which Br'er Rabbit tells him that he would dance as if he were smart as him to which Br'er Turtle warns him that he will teach him a lesson to prove who is faster. Br'er Turtle then plans to trick Br'er Rabbit in competing against him by telling the other turtles who are part of his family to teach him a lesson to which Br'er Turtle's family stroll across the woods to trick Br'er Rabbit.

Later, [[Br'er Buzzard]] begins a race between Br'er Turtle and Br'er Rabbit to which during the race, one of the turtle children tricks Br'er Rabbit, confusing him throughout the race. Br'er Rabbit then sees Br'er Turtle approaching the finish line, causing the latter to come in first place and thus winning the race, much to Br'er Rabbit's sadness. He makes no further appearance throughout the story as it loops to the next sequence of Br'er Rabbit's encounter with Br'er Wolf.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
===[[Splash Mountain]]===
In the [[Disneyland]] version of Splash Mountain, Br'er Turtle can be seen during the "[[How Do You Do?]]" section of the attraction next to Br'er Rabbit. However, his animatronic is a recycled version of the turtle seen during the "[[Home on the Range (song)|Home on the Range]]" song from the second act of "[[America Sings]]". In the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version of Splash Mountain, Br'er Turtle (seen as a unique animatronic design rather than a recycled version of the America Sings animatronic design) can be seen sitting next to a turkey during the "[[Everybody's Got a Laughing Place]]" section.

As of [[2020]], the Disneyland version of Splash Mountain has been announced for closure to remove all references to ''Song of the South'' in order to retheme it into a ''[[The Princess and the Frog|Princess and the Frog]]''-[[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|themed attraction]], due to outdated cultural depictions from ''Song of the South'' which the attraction itself is based on. Therefore, it is currently unknown who will replace Br'er Turtle's animatronic in the rethemed version of Splash Mountain in California; [[The Oriental Land Company]], however, has not yet announced plans whether to retheme the [[Tokyo]] version of Splash Mountain or not.

==Trivia==
*Br'er Terrapin is one of the few animated characters who do not appear in the animated sequences of ''Song of the South'' but rather in a live-action scene, specifically during the reprise of "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah".
