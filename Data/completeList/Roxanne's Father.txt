'''Roxanne's Father''' is a minor character in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''.

==Role in the film==
He is shown to be a bit overprotective of his daughter [[Roxanne]] and doesn't seem to like [[Max Goof|Max]]. His relationship with her comes off as that of a pet and owner, with her playing the former and him playing the latter. Because of this, she often corrects him whenever he is being overprotective.

He is only seen twice in the film; first when Max comes to tell Roxanne that he can't come to [[Stacey]]'s party because he was forced into going fishing with his [[Goofy|father]], and is seen watching them through the mail slot, but stops when Roxanne spots him. The second time is at the end of the film when Max comes to apologize to Roxanne for making up the story of Goofy knowing [[Powerline]]. In this instance, he was seen wearing a towel and a shower cap, implying that Max rang the doorbell while he was bathing.

He never speaks, only growls.
