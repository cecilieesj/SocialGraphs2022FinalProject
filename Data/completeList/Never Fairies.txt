'''Never fairies''' are enchanting creatures native to [[Pixie Hollow]] whose main function is to change the seasons on the Mainland. They are the main characters in the [[Disney Fairies]] franchise.

Pixie Hollow's warm seasons are under the rule of [[Queen Clarion]], and all warm fairies recognize her as their ruler. Alternatively, the Winter Woods are under [[Lord Milori]]'s authority.

==Overview==
===Arrival===
When a baby laughs for the first time, a fairy or sparrow man is born. The laugh blows away a dandelion seed, which is carried by the winds to [[Pixie Hollow]]. Once the seed carrying the laugh makes its way to the Pixie Dust Tree, a dust-keeper sprinkles [[Pixie Dust]] over it, eventually turning into a fairy or sparrow man. This is an event called "The Arrival". Winter fairies (or winter-talents) are born if a laugh crosses the border into the Winter Woods, where Lord Milori rules.

Upon a fairy's arrival, [[Queen Clarion]] welcomes them and the ceremony to discover what talent they have takes place. She summon pedestals from which fairies from different talent guilds bring objects to symbolize their magical innate abilities. The brighter the symbol glows, the more naturally gifted the fairy or sparrow man are. After the ceremony is over and the new fairy had discovered a talent, Queen Clarion gives them a proper name and they are initiated in a certain talent guild.

Fairies can have siblings if the laugh blows away into more than one fairy. They have wings are exactly the same in their design and pattern. When they approach each other, their wings sparkle.

===Physical appearance===
The average Never fairy stands at five inches tall (12.7&nbsp;cm). Each fairy's wing design is unique, there are no two that are exactly the same, with the exception of twins, two fairies born of the same laugh.

Fairies can appear to be of any ethnicity, although they usually have button noses and slanted eyes. In the films, however, it appears that some features and talents may be more likely to go together: for example, all Winter fairies tend to have either white or black hair, and many Light fairies have dark hair and skin.

Fairies clothes' are made out of nature materials, such as leaves and flower petals. Fairies wear clothing colored to the talent he or she belongs. Green for tinker fairies, red-pink for garden fairies, blue for water fairies, and so on. [[Zarina]], as The Pirate Fairy, is the only fairy seen wearing non-natural clothing.

==Talents==
Each fairy or sparrowman is naturally gifted with a single, special talent. It reflects his or her most inner qualities and personality.

While all fairies have a talent, only those fairies who work closely with nature were allowed visit the Mainland while other fairies stayed in Pixie Hollow their whole lives. However, after the events of ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell (2008)]]'', they were allowed to visit the Mainland with others.

Fairies can even grow their own Pixie Dust Tree, although it requires a maple with the infusion of Blue Pixie dust at its core. If done properly, the enchanted maple will produce [[Pixie Dust]] the same way as the original Pixie Dust Tree, but as only is dropping inside it.

Pixie Dust Alchemy was created by an incredible gifted and powerful dust-keeper named [[Zarina]], that can change the natural properties of the regular [[Pixie Dust]], giving it another colors and powerful special properties associated with the talents, and can even change the natural talent that a fairy possess if sprinkled on them. When a fairy changes his/her talent, the only way to reverts back to their original is to be sprinkled with the dust related to it.

Fairy talents include, but are not limited to:

==Weaknesses==
*'''Water''': Fairies cannot fly if their wings get wet, even with Pixie Dust. Even water fairies cannot fly if their wings are wet. Fairies can fly again once their wings dry off.
*'''Hawks''': Hawks are fairies' natural predators and will chase and eats them as soon they are under their eye.
*'''Temperature Sensitivity''':
**'''Cold''': Non-winter fairies cannot be exposed to winter temperatures. The cold will freeze their wings, causing them to break, permanently depriving them of their ability to fly.
**'''Heat''': Winter fairies cannot be exposed to warm temperatures. The heat will shrivel their wings, causing them to break, permanently depriving them of their ability to fly.
***Normally, there is no cure for a broken wing, however, when twin fairies align their wings, then the broken wing can be healed.

==Society==
Fairies attends many events, such as:
*'''The Arrival''': When a fairy or sparrow man is born and discovers his or her talent.
*'''The Queen's Review''': When Queen Clarion, with the help of the Minister of Spring, sees if anything is ready with spring a night before it is taken to the Mainland.
*'''Autumn Revelry''': Performed in every eight years at the end of autumn on the Mainland, the Autumn Revelry is where dust-keeper fairies and the others gather Blue Pixie Dust to feed the Pixie Dust Tree. They also illuminates the sky with fireworks, train tadpoles to blow bubbles, and a storm of butterflies flies through the blue sparkling air.
*'''Pixie Hollow Games''': A race where fairies competing against each other. Each competing guild is represented by two fairies: The leader and their partner. They must work as a team, and both must finish an event together to count. Precisely how fairies are usually chosen to enter the games isn't completely detailed. [[Chloe]] trained and volunteered to represent the garden-talent fairies, and when nobody else volunteered, a name was drawn from a basket to pick another at "random" - in reality, the basket only had Rosetta's name in it, as [[Rosetta]] had avoided competing in the game while her guild-mates had suffered humiliating defeats. The opening ceremonies take place at the Fairy Coliseum. The competitors enter the coliseum and are introduced to the spectators. [[Queen Clarion]] arrives to welcome the spectators and wish good luck to the competitors. Once the opening ceremonies are over, the first game begins. The games go on for three days, with one event on the first day, four events on the second day, and one event on the last day. The races are: Leapfrogging, Dragonfly. Water Skiing, Mouse Polo, Twig Spears, Teacup Challenge, and Derby Cart Race.
*'''Four Seasons Festival''': The fairies make shows with their talents to represent each season of Pixie Hollow. This is the only event that Winter fairies attends on the warm side of Pixie Hollow.

===Fairy Camp===
Is several encampments that fairies lives temporarily through the Mainland in order to fulfill their duty to change the seasons. Their encampment is never abandoned, and there's always fairies coming and leaving. [[Tinker Bell]] describes one of it as "Every [[Pixie Hollow]] on a single tree."

==The Seasonal Ministers==
The Seasonal Ministers are in charge of watching over their domain in [[Pixie Hollow]] and overseeing the fairies working under their eye. They are the Minister of Spring, the Minister of Summer, the Minister of Autumn and the Minister of Winter.
