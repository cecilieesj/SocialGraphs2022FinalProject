'''Madame Goo Goo''' (portrayed by Zibby Allen) is Chyna's favorite popstar and is an obvious parody of Lady Gaga. She only appears in "cANTonese Style Cuisine" and  "Uncanny resembANTs" A gag is that every time she enters a room, her outfit changes. In the turning point of "cANTonese Style Cuisine," she was seen performing her song "Born This Day" (a parody of Lady Gaga's song "Born This Way").

==Trivia==
*Zibby Allen, the actress who portrayed Madame Goo Goo, also portrayed [[Winter Maddox]] in many season 3 episodes of ''[[A.N.T. Farm]]''. This interesting fact was discovered in the episode "Uncanny ResemblANTs" when Madame Goo Goo returns, and Chyna points out Winter looks a lot like her.
*Her brother is in jail for unknown reasons.
*Madame Goo Goo is an obvious parody of Lady Gaga, though Lady Gaga has been mentioned in other episodes.  Thus, both people exist in the same universe.
* Her real name is Chrysanthemum Turtleneck (parody of Stefani Germanotta).
