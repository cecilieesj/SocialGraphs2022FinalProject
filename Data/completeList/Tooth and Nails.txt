'''Tooth and Nails''' are the bully henchmen of [[Douglas Twinkmeyer]] from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
They assist [[Douglas Twinkmeyer|Douglas]] in trying to become the only person in possession of a certain baseball card by taking [[Max Goof|Max's]] and other kids' money. However, Max and his friend [[P.J.]] stop them and they are forced into eraser clapping duty in detention.

===Personality===
Tooth and Nails are mean-spirited and tough. They gladly bully other children and take great joy in doing bad things.

===Physical appearance===
Tooth is a stocky anthropomorphic dog of average height with bright orange hair, while Nails is overweight with brown hair. Tooth wears a red long-sleeved shirt with rolled-up cuffs, black pants, light brown shoes, and white gloves, and Nails wears a blue short-sleeved collared shirt, jeans, black shoes, a light blue newsboy cap, and tan suspenders.

===Role in the series===
Their only prominent appearance is in the episode, "[[Lethal Goofin']]", where they are seen bullying other students, including [[Max Goof|Max]], for their money. It was all a part of a bigger plot concocted by [[Douglas Twinkmeyer]], then under the alias of "Mr. Big." Douglas wanted to corner the market on the Lefty McGuffin baseball card, so he hired Tooth and Nails to steal the other kids' money to buy every card so he could destroy all of them but one. However, Max and [[P.J.]] exposed their plot, and as a result, Tooth and Nails were sent to detention for two weeks.

Nails can be seen in the background of the episodes "[[To Heir is Human]]" and "[[From Air to Eternity]]", sitting behind Max at school in the former, and witnessing P.J. being interviewed in the latter.

==Trivia==
*An adult look-a-like of Nails appears in the episode "[[A Goof of the People]]".
