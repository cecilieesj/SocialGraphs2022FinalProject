'''Queen Narissa''' is the main antagonist from Disney's [[2007]] hybrid film ''[[Enchanted]]''. She is the queen of [[Andalasia]] and [[Prince Edward]]'s stepmother.

==Background ==
Narissa was raised in [[Andalasia]]. She married [[Prince Edward]]'s father after his mother presumably died. After the father died, Narissa began fearing for the day that Edward would marry, since it would mean she would lose her throne forever. So she made his servant [[Nathaniel]] distract her stepson by making him hunt trolls every morning.

===Development===
Queen Narissa was created to be similar to three famous Disney Villains - [[The Evil Queen|Queen Grimhilde]], [[Lady Tremaine]] and [[Maleficent]]. Narissa utilizes the Queen's hag disguise, has Lady Tremaine's role as an evil stepmother, and takes on a dragon form similar to Maleficent. Overall, the villains all share the same basic role and personality.

===Personality===
Narissa was given the best and worst traits of [[the Evil Queen]], [[Lady Tremaine]] and [[Maleficent]]. She is beautiful, selfish, cruel, spiteful, vindictive, manipulative, cunning, powerful, ruthless and full of black magic. She acts as if she loves Nathaniel, but as he himself eventually realizes, she was just manipulating him to get what she wants.

===Powers and abilities===
Queen Narissa is very knowledgeable in many different areas of dark magic, such as, but not limited to, shapeshifting, which she can do by reciting the spell "Speciosus, formosus, praeclarus!", electrokinesis, water communication, and scrying (which she not only can do through water but other forms of liquids such as soup and alcohol). She can also produce powerful sonic screams with her voice, which are capable of shattering glass. Furthermore, she would appear to be gifted in alchemy and deadly substances, much like the Evil Queen, as shown with her poisoned apples.

==Role in the film==
When Narissa first appears, she's hoping that she will not see the day when her stepson [[Prince Edward]] finds a perfect bride, but he eventually falls in love with a girl named [[Giselle]]. Knowing that Edward will be crowned King upon his marriage and replace her as the monarch, Narissa vows to stop at nothing to destroy the girl. Hours before the wedding, she appears in a hag form and tricks Giselle into falling down a fountain that leads to New York City in the real world, thus keeping her stepson single and her keeping the throne.

Upon learning that Edward has followed Giselle to New York, Narissa sends her devoted minion [[Nathaniel]] to kill Giselle with three poisoned apples. When Nathaniel fails with the first two apples, Narissa dismisses his mission as a worthless failure and goes to New York to finish the job herself. She goes to the City’s ball celebration disguised as a hag again and convinces Giselle to eat the remaining apple, telling her that one bite will erase her sorrowful memories of New York. Giselle eats the apple and collapses. Narissa reverts to her normal appearance and attempts to escape with the unconscious Giselle, but is intercepted by Edward. Narissa insists that Giselle is fine, just fainted, but everyone ignores her. The fully-realized Nathaniel reveals Narissa’s evil intentions, and Edward declares that she will lose her crown for this. When Edward’s kiss fails to wake Giselle, Robert, a man who helped Giselle in New York City, kisses her, and it successfully lifts Narissa’s curse just as the clock strikes twelve. Giselle admits that she knew Robert was her true love, and the party cheers.

In a rage, Narissa turns into a fire-breathing dragon, and the film’s final battle begins. Narissa captures Robert and takes him to the top of the Woolworth Building, with Giselle going after her to fight her and save him. Giselle and Robert seem doomed until Giselle’s best chipmunk friend Pip comes; due to being overweight, he manages to break the spire that Narissa is standing on and causes her to drop Robert. Narissa then falls to an explosive death with only sparkly dust remaining from her while Giselle, Robert and Pip stay safe on the top of the Woolworth Building.

Eventually, Edward returns to Andalasia alongside Robert’s ex-fiancée Nancy, where they get married and are crowned Andalasia’s new monarchs.
