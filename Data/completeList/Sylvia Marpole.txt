|partner=[[Goofy]] (boyfriend)}}'''Sylvia Marpole''' is the head librarian of the State college featured in the [[2000]] direct-to-video animated film,Â ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. She meets Goofy when Max takes him to sign up for a college library card before ditching him, unknowingly allowing his father to get to know her better and spark a romance between the two that leads to Sylvia becoming his new girlfriend.
In the movie, she is voiced by [[Bebe Neuwirth]], best known for her portrayal of Dr. Lilith Sternin on the NBC television sitcom, ''Cheers'' and its spinoff, ''Fraiser''.

==Appearance==
Sylvia appears to be a young female anthropomorphic dog with a small snout and short lush red hair. Although slim, her lower half is very voluptuous and is complemented by most of her outfits. Her most commonly seen outfit is a white button top with a black shirt, wearing red frame glasses over her dark green eyes. Sylvia also wears a black skirt and 1970s-style black heels. She also wears red lipstick, as shown when her kisses leave red marks on Goofy's face.

[[File:Sylvia_Dance.jpg|thumb|left|Sylvia's appearance when dancing with Goofy]]Later on, when dancing with Goofy, she wore a 1970's inspired outfit, colored mostly green, complete with gold hoop earrings and a large red afro-like hairstyle. She also has removed her glasses and has light purple eyeshadow.

==Personality==
While she is seen as the quiet and well-mannered librarian of the college Max and Goofy attend, she is shown to be a fun-loving and sweet woman on the outside, quickly revealed by Goofy upon meeting her. She is a fan of old collectibles and shows, same as Goofy, and loves to dance. Eventually, she falls in love with Goofy and is seen as his girlfriend after their first "date" together. 

She can be very affectionate and spontaneous, as shown when she playfully pinned Goofy to the ground before covering his face with several red lipstick marks after spotting the bouquet of flowers that he had brought her.

She is shown to have a strict side to her as well, seen when Goofy accidentally forgot one of their dinner dates when he felt disheartened from Max rejecting him. Since then, she remained cold and distant from Goofy when they met again but eventually came around after Goofy pleaded for her help and all but confessed how much she means to him. However, she also values family bonds as she watches in hope at the changes transpiring between Max and Goofy throughout the movie.

==Trivia==
*At one point, Sylvia pins Goofy down and kisses him all over this face, leaving red lipstick marks. This is similar to what Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck do to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, respectively, in various cartoon shorts.
*Her reference to "Boogie Duck" is a direct spoof of the mid-1970s novelty song "Disco Duck".
