{{Quote|...Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower lives the mysterious bell ringer. Who is this creature? What is he? How did he come to be there?|[[Clopin]], during "[[The Bells of Notre Dame]]"}}
'''Quasimodo''' is the protagonist of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1996]] animated feature film, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. Quasimodo was born with several [[Wikipedia:Disfigurement|deformities]], possessing a [[Wikipedia:Kyphosis|hunched back]] among other physical abnormalities. Because of his appearance, the kind-hearted bell-ringer of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] was condemned to the cathedral's highest tower by his cruel caretaker, [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]]. From his isolated home, Quasimodo developed a yearning to experience the outside world and live a normal life amongst the people of Paris.

==Background==
Quasimodo first appeared as a baby during the film's prologue (his face was never seen, as he was swaddled by a blanket. The only feature shown is one of his arms) being carried by a [[Quasimodo's Mother|woman]] presumed to be his mother. She and three other [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people Romani people], including her [[Quasimodo's Father|spouse]], were attempting to secretly enter [[Paris]] through its waterways near the cathedral. However, Judge Frollo, who contemptuously viewed all gypsies as thieves, quickly surrounded them with his guards and had them arrested. Thinking she was holding stolen goods, Frollo pursued Quasimodo's mother as she ran through the streets before cornering her at Notre Dame's doors. He grabbed Quasimodo from her and kicked her onto the steps, smashing her skull and killing her instantly. When he discovered he was, in fact, holding a baby, he pulled back the blanket and exclaimed the deformed child was "a monster". He intended to drop the baby down a well but was stopped by the cathedral's [[Archdeacon]] who guilted Frollo into caring for the child for having committed the sin of spilling blood before Notre Dame. Frollo agreed on the condition that the child grow up hidden away within the cathedral's bell tower, and mused that the "foul creature may yet prove to be of use to me".

===Personality===
Though some would have regarded him with fear due to his appearance, Quasimodo is kind and gentle with a curious and trusting nature. Because he was raised in isolation by his master, Frollo, he was naïve to the realities of the world and Frollo's intentions until he was grown. However, despite Frollo's warnings about the cruelties of the outside world, especially gypsies like [[Esmeralda]], Quasimodo never regarded them personally with violence or contempt. Rather, he looked forward to the day when he could live among other people, even if only for a day, and envied the most simple of the day-to-day lives of normal Parisians. Since Notre Dame was his home, he regarded the cathedral and bell tower with great attachment, going so far as to name all the bells he rang. Even after he was accepted into society, he chose to remain within his beloved church.

Quasimodo is a shy soul and was initially fearful of letting anyone see his face. His only companions aside from Frollo were his gargoyle friends, [[Victor, Hugo, and Laverne]]. As such, Quasimodo was lacking in social skills. When Esmeralda displayed compassion toward him, he jumped to the conclusion that she could be romantically attracted to him. Subsequently, he was heartbroken when she revealed that her heart belonged to [[Phoebus]]. However, Quasimodo proved his ability to grow and mature by remaining close friends with them. His ability to absorb new information and react to new situations helped him through many situations: though he viewed Phoebus as an initial threat, he became close friends with him; and while he was steadfastly loyal to Frollo his whole life, he was able to defy his master to save his friends, though he did not let Frollo's malice turn him into a killer when given the chance.

Living in the bell tower of Notre Dame his entire life gave Quasimodo great strength and agility. He is able to move through the cathedral, inside and out, with ease and put these skills to the test when he helped Esmeralda escape the cathedral following her incarceration there. When Frollo had him chained to the bell tower, Quasimodo displayed super-human strength by breaking down the stone pillars that held him before swinging to Esmeralda's rescue.

===Physical appearance===
Quasimodo is a muscular young man with slender legs. His back is twisted with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis scoliosis], resulting in a large hump above his right shoulder. His face is somewhat squashed, with a large upturned nose and a large lump above his left eye, a receding chin and a massive central incisor. He has fair skin, red hair, and teal eyes. His clothing comprises of a short-sleeved green tunic, brown tights, and dark teal shoes. In the second film, he gets newer clothes consisting of a burgundy and violet striped tunic and hat, and a purple cape. His hat initially came with two feathers that were eaten by [[Djali]].

===Abilities===
With nothing else to do in his isolation aside from ringing the bells, Quasimodo developed refined skills in handcrafting and became quite a talented artist. He carved models of the city of Paris and its inhabitants out of wood and his inner abode within the bell tower is decorated with shards of stained glass hung to capture the sunlight. Ringing the cathedral's bells daily and navigating his precipitous home gave him a muscular physique and the agility of an acrobat. 

==Appearances==
===''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''===
[[File:Quasimodo-(The Hunchback of Notre Dame).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quasimodo in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''.]]
Quasimodo was raised by Frollo and kept confined to Notre Dame, living in its bell tower as the bell ringer. Unwise to the truth about his origins, Quasimodo believed Frollo when he was told his mother abandoned him as an infant due to his appearance and grew up with the understanding that he was ugly and would be construed as a monster if he ever left Notre Dame. Despite this, he always longed to be free and live among normal people and looked forward to the annual [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_Fools Feast of Fools] where all of Paris celebrated and indulged in foolish fun.

His only friends in the world were Hugo, Victor, and Laverne, three resident gargoyles who served as his closest confidants and often did their best to provide guidance and humor. They convinced him one day to attend the Festival of Fools in disguise against Frollo's wishes. There, he meets a beautiful gypsy named Esmeralda and he instantly falls in love with her. Unaware of who he is, she helps him onto a stage for the King of Fools competition where contestants display their ugliest expressions to win the crown. Once she and the crowd realize his face is not a mask, Quasimodo shrinks back in shame until the festival's ambassador, [[Clopin]], points out that the bell ringer of Notre Dame is indeed the ugliest face in Paris. Frollo is shocked at his ward's disobedience, but Quasimodo is too touched by his acceptance to care. However, his glee is short-lived. After a guard throws food at Quasimodo and mocks him, the crowd turns their cheers into jeers as Quasimodo is tied down and barraged with a flurry of produce.

Quasimodo's cries for help are ignored until Esmeralda intervenes and cuts him free. She berates Frollo for his cruelty and injustice, inciting the judge to have her arrested. She escapes and Frollo's fury guilts a humiliated Quasimodo to return to Notre Dame. After Esmeralda claims sanctuary within the cathedral, Quasimodo watches as she sings "[[God Help the Outcasts]]", before she catches sight of him. She follows him into the bell tower with her goat, Djali, where they are finally able to get to know one another. Dismayed by Quasimodo's view of himself, Esmeralda assures him with some palm reading that he is no monster, just a misunderstood soul. Quasimodo likewise sees that Esmeralda, despite being a gypsy, is not the evil heathen Frollo made them out to be. He volunteers to help Esmeralda escape Notre Dame and scales down the side of the church with her, allowing her to slip away from the sight of [[Frollo's soldiers|Frollo's guards]]. In thanks, Esmeralda gives Quasimodo an amulet and tells him to find her at the [[Court of Miracles]], a safe haven for gypsies, should he ever need anything.

As he returns to the roof, Quasimodo is approached by Phoebus, captain of the guard, looking for Esmeralda. Though Quasimodo confronts him angrily, Phoebus assures him that he had Esmeralda locked in Notre Dame to keep her safe and requests that the message be relayed. Before he leaves, he comments how Esmeralda is lucky to have a friend like him. Back in the bell tower, the gargoyles praise Quasimodo for his valor and selflessness and muse how Esmeralda could be in love with him. Quasimodo doubts this but sings "[[Heaven's Light]]" to express his love for her and wonders if she could love him too since she was the first person ever in his life to be so kind to him.

Frollo, meanwhile, finds himself at odds with his own sense of piety and justice as he contends with 'unholy thoughts' about Esmeralda. His obsession for her fuels a relentless search through the city where he arrests every gypsy he comes across and burns every dissenter's home. Phoebus watches the madness come to a head when Frollo tries to burn the home of the miller and his family with them inside. Phoebus rescues the family and is shot with an arrow in an attempt to escape on Frollo's horse. He falls off a bridge to the river below, but Esmeralda rescues him. As Paris burns, Quasimodo and the gargoyles watch nervously for any sign of Esmeralda, although Hugo is certain she will return because of her love for Quasimodo ("[[A Guy Like You]]"). Esmeralda, however, returns, but she brings a wounded Phoebus with her. Although heartbroken when he sees the lovers kiss, Quasimodo agrees to keep Phoebus safe while Esmeralda flees. Frollo returns to the bell tower and confronts Quasimodo over his suspicions that he helped Esmeralda escape, blaming the bell ringer for the fate of Paris. He tells Quasimodo that all will be right again once he storms the Court of Miracles at dawn with one thousand men and leaves, grinning smugly.

Phoebus wakes and convinces Quasimodo to go with him to the Court of Miracles to warn Esmeralda and the others of Frollo's plan. While initially unwilling over his resentment toward Phoebus and his fear of Frollo, Quasimodo relents. They discover that the amulet Esmeralda gave him is actually a map of the city and follow it to a graveyard where they find a secret entrance to the crypts below. Inside, they are ambushed by a group of gypsies led by Clopin who accuses the two of spying under orders from Frollo. He deems they should be hanged for their treachery but is stopped by Esmeralda. When Phoebus reveals Frollo's plan, the gypsies prepare to leave, but are horrified to see Frollo and his army enter and capture everyone. Frollo reveals that he baited Quasimodo and followed him straight to the Court of Miracles. Despondent, Quasimodo is dragged back to Notre Dame and chained to the bell tower where he can only watch as Esmeralda is sentenced to burn at the stake for witchcraft. The gargoyles convince a sullen Quasimodo to act and he breaks free of his chains, swinging down and saving Esmeralda before she can succumb to the flames. He retreats to Notre Dame, crying out 'sanctuary' for Esmeralda before laying her in a safe place, and sends down a barrage of stone and molten metal to disperse Frollo's forces. Phoebus, meanwhile, manages to escape his confines and rouses the citizens of Paris to fight back. 

Frollo manages to sneak into the cathedral and shoves the Archdeacon aside before climbing to the bell tower. He attempts to kill Quasimodo, but the hunchback fights back at him. Quasimodo then tells him how he was told the world is dark and cruel, but now sees that the only reason why is because of people like Frollo. The minute Esmeralda is revealed to be alive, Frollo draws his sword and chases him and Esmeralda across the Notre Dame rooftops. After shocking Quasimodo by revealing his mother died trying to save him, Frollo tries to smite him off the roof. However, as Esmeralda holds onto Quasimodo, Frollo loses his footing on an unstable gargoyle and falls to his death. Esmeralda's grip on Quasimodo fails, but he is caught at the last moment by Phoebus. The three friends reunite with Quasimodo blessing Phoebus and Esmeralda's romance and they emerge from the cathedral to a bright Paris morning. Quasimodo is led into the sunlight and is approached by a little girl who gently touches his face before bringing him into the crowd. They hold him above their shoulders, cheering for him and Paris' liberation from Frollo's tyranny.

===''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]''===
[[File:Hond2 064.jpg|thumb|250px|Quasimodo in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame II''.]]
Taking place several years after the original film, Quasimodo is now an accepted part of Parisian society, free to interact with the public, even becoming something of a town mascot; however, he continues living in Notre Dame with Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, and serve as the cathedral's bellringer. As the city prepares for Le Jour d'Amour, which is a festival celebrating romance, Quasimodo, although excited, feels a bit uneven. Unlike everyone else, Quasimodo has no love interest to celebrate the festival alongside. Esmeralda, who now acts as Quasimodo's confidant, reassures him that someone out there will cross paths with him when he's truly ready. Setting the grief aside, Quasimodo begins to prepare one of Notre Dame's bells, [[La Fidèle]].

Meanwhile, the circus arrives in the city with a secretly villainous ringmaster, [[Sarousch]], and his cohort [[Madellaine]]. Sarousch plans on stealing La Fidèle and orders Madellaine to convince the Notre Dame bell ringer to reveal it to her. Once he does, she is to tell him the location so that he may steal it. Inside, Madellaine wants no part of Sarousch's scheme but must obey or suffer the harsh world alone. Inside Notre Dame, she speaks with Quasimodo, who's hiding under a bell to prevent her from seeing his face. The two become fairly comfortable with each other. However, when Madellaine finally sees his face, she runs away in terror, leaving Quasimodo depressed. Even though their time was brief, Quasi begins to develop feelings for her. Hugo, Victor, and Laverne advise Quasimodo to head over to the circus, which he decides to do.

He meets up with Esmeralda, Phoebus, and their son [[Zephyr]], and they all head for the circus together. After the performance, Madellaine is again ordered to get La Fidèle's whereabouts. However, she notices Quasimodo and Zephyr's close relationship and realizes that he is a wonderful person inside. Quasimodo and Madellaine head off on a tour through the city, falling in love during the process. The next day, Quasi feels odd and goes to Esmeralda for help. She easily realizes he's in love and advises him to tell her the truth. Just then, Phoebus arrives openly blaming the circus for the sudden robberies going on throughout the city. Quasimodo sticks up for Madellaine, who he feels is different, but Phoebus is not convinced. Quasimodo storms out.

Back at the circus, Sarousch forces Madellaine to lure Quasimodo out of Notre Dame so that he may make his move on La Fidèle. Madellaine tries to reject the demand, but Sarousch threatens to murder Quasimodo unless she cooperates. Quasimodo feels it's time to ask Madellaine the truth about their relationship and leaves her for a walk. During their absence, Sarousch tricks Phoebus into believing Madellaine is the mastermind behind the thefts and two of his goons steal the bell successfully. When Quasimodo and Madellaine return, Phoebus orders Madellaine arrested for the thefts which leave Quasimodo feeling betrayed and heartbroken. Inside Notre Dame, Hugo, Victor, and Laverne inform Quasimodo about the robbery, and that Zephyr followed Sarousch. Quasimodo, Esmeralda, Phoebus, and a captive Madellaine make their way to Sarousch.

Quasimodo and the others venture into the dark catacombs. They encounter Djali, who takes them to Sarousch and Zephyr. Sarousch forces Phoebus and the guards into opening the gate to allow his raft through by using Zephyr as a hostage. Madellaine convinces Quasimodo to trust her again, and the pair run up a stairwell. Quasimodo lassos a rock to create a tightrope and Madellaine walks across it. When Sarousch's raft passes beneath her, Madellaine seizes Zephyr from Sarousch's grasp. With Sarousch now robbed of his leverage, Phoebus's men quickly arrest Sarousch and recover the bell. At the festival, Quasimodo and Madellaine finally proclaim their love for one another and kiss as Zephyr rings La Fidèle.

===Other appearances===
Quasimodo makes several cameos as a guest on ''[[House of Mouse]]''. In the episode "[[Jiminy Cricket (House of Mouse)|Jiminy Cricket]]", Quasimodo was used as a reference for [[Jiminy Cricket|Jiminy]]'s quote, "Maybe you'll meet someone special, maybe you won't," poking fun at the fact that Quasimodo did not get Esmeralda at the end of the 1996 film. In the episode "[[Ask Von Drake]]" Quasimodo is seen clapping his hands while he watches Esmeralda dance on a table. In the episode "[[House of Scrooge]]", Quasimodo's face is not deformed when you see him in the audience.

Quasimodo also makes a cameo appearance at the end of ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', amongst the crowd of moviegoing Disney characters.

In ''[[Descendants]]'', Quasimodo appears as one of the heroes to have images in the Cathedral.

In ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', a screencap of Quasimodo can be seen along with the [[Sorcerer Hat]] at the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]] pavilion of [[Oh My Disney]].

A child wearing a Quasimodo costume can be seen during [[Launchpad McQuack]]'s flashback in the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' episode "[[The Trickening!]]".

==Video games==
===''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''===
[[File:Quasimodo KH.png|left|250px|Quasimodo as he appears in ''Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance''.]]
Quasimodo appears in the game as a character trapped in his sleeping world, "La Cité des Cloches".

Much like the film, Quasimodo is forced to remain inside [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame's bell tower]], under the order of his master [[Claude Frollo]]. During the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo sneaked out and ended up being taking part in the festival and being crowned the King of Fools. [[Dream Eater]]s were a part of his parade and they became Nightmares and turned violent when [[Sora]] arrived, who fought them off after.

Quasimodo met Riku when he entered Notre Dame for answers about Frollo. Having been informed by Frollo himself that he carried out business on the outskirts of the city, Quasi informed Riku where his master is and that the [[Archdeacon]] is away. Riku questioned him as to why doesn't go outside and Quasimodo explained that it's because of his hideous appearance. However, Riku encouraged him to find true friends who see him for who he is in his heart.

Quasimodo later met [[Esmeralda]] and showed her around the bell tower. After realizing that Frollo was plotting to kill her due to her ethnicity, Quasimodo offered her sanctuary and protection within Notre Dame. She declined but gave him a woven band with the hidden location of the [[Court of Miracles]], a safe haven for hunted gypsies like her.

When he heard from Sora and [[Phoebus]] that Frollo discovered the Court of Miracles and was going to attack, he used the band to lead Sora and Phoebus to the court in an attempt to warn the gypsies. However, it turned out that Frollo tricked them and only pretended to know the court's location so that he could follow Quasimodo there. Frollo reached the court with an army of Nightmares.

Quasimodo rescued Esmeralda from her execution and took her to the sanctuary within the Notre Dame. Here, he learned that his mother had died while protecting him rather than abandoning him as Frollo said. He offered to help Riku fight the Wargoyle, but Riku told Quasimodo to look after Esmeralda instead. In the aftermath, he was encouraged by Sora to go out and make more friends. Quasimodo agrees, no longer fearing being rejected by society. Quasimodo also thanked Riku for his advice earlier.

==[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (musical)|Musical]]==
In the German Musical, Quasimodo is more morose in demeanor and he has trouble communicating verbally, though he is not deaf. He is able to freely express himself when he sings, which leads one to believe his numbers actually take place in his mind. His fate at the end of the musical is much different than in the film: he kills Frollo out of anger following Esmeralda's death and carries her corpse from Notre Dame (much like in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo Hugo's] book). The musical also establishes Quasimodo's gargoyle friends as figments of his imagination, created due to his loneliness.

In the North American musical, Quasimodo's role and personality are very much the same as in the original musical. However, in this version, Quasimodo's father, named Jehan, is revealed to be Frollo's brother, placing Quasimodo in the care of his cruel uncle. As in the novel, Quasimodo is rendered deaf from the ringing of the bells and only speaks coherently when talking to the gargoyles (in this case, his friends are portrayed as stone saints) or when singing. Some productions cast a deaf actor as Quasimodo with another actor providing his singing voice. Additionally, Quasimodo's fate is less ambiguous than in the German musical and stays true to the novel: he takes Esmeralda's body to the crypts beneath Paris and starves to death. His remains are later found clutching Esmeralda's. When it's attempted to separate them, Quasimodo's remains crumble to dust.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
[[File:Quasimodo Character Central.jpg|thumb|250px|Quasimodo, posing for a photo at one of the Disney parks.]]

===[[Disneyland Resort]]===
Quasimodo makes a cameo in the [[2014]] rendition of [[World of Color|World of Color: Winter Dreams]], during the "Believe" sequence of the show.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===
Quasimodo has his own spell card known as "Quasimodo's Bell" in the [[Magic Kingdom]] attraction [[Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom]]. In the same park, he makes a notable appearance during [[Happily Ever After (fireworks show)|Happily Ever After]], where he performs "[[Out There]]". In the past, Quasi appeared daily in [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame: A Musical Adventure]] in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===
In [[Disney Dreams]], Quasimodo has a scene in which he sings "Out There" as he swings around the towers of [[Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant]]. He was also featured in the former [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Festival of Fools]] parade, which ran in promotion for the film.

===[[Disney Cruise Line]]===
Aboard the [[Disney Dream]] and [[Disney Wonder]], Quasi appears as a face character in [[The Golden Mickeys]] "Heroism" segment, performing "Out There".

==Differences from the source material==
*The original Quasimodo, created by Victor Hugo, was an even more tragic character. Aside from being ugly and deformed, he was half-blind and deaf due to the loud ringing of the bells and could not speak intelligibly. He communicated very little but was taught sign language by Frollo. However, he was still kind-hearted and caring.
*Quasimodo's growth over his left eye was originally featured as covering his right, causing him to be blind in that eye. His blindness was excluded from the film.
*In the original novel, Quasimodo's life was spared by Frollo, but Frollo and the Archdeacon never exclusively agreed to confine him to Notre Dame's bell tower. Quasimodo remained hidden away purely due to the repulsiveness of his features.
*Victor Hugo's Quasimodo was caring toward those he loved but much more violent to those who would harm them, going so far as to kill others to protect Esmeralda. He kills Frollo by throwing him from the cathedral towers rather than watching him fall to his own demise.
*In the ending of the novel, Quasimodo is unable to save Esmeralda, who dies by hanging. He takes her body to the crypts beneath Paris and lies with her body, starving to death. When soldiers discover their remains three years later, they attempt to remove Quasimodo from Esmeralda's skeleton, but his body crumbles to dust at the slightest touch.

==Trivia==
*Quasimodo is [[Tom Hulce]]'s final leading theatrical performance role before his temporary retirement from acting.
*Other actors considered for the role of Quasimodo included musician Meat Loaf and Mandy Patinkin of ''The Princess Bride'' fame. Patinkin's audition became notorious due to an outburst when he was denied changes he wanted to make to not just the character, but to the songs as well.
*Despite the fact that his eyes are green in the original film, in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' in "La Cite Des Cloches", Quasimodo's eyes are blue.
**Quasimodo was also the first new Disney character featured in promotional pictures and footage of ''Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance''.
*Quasimodo is 20 years old, according to [[Laverne]]'s comment at the start of the film, his argument with [[Phoebus]], and during [[Frollo]]'s remark at the climax.
*Quasimodo is the third Disney male protagonist to have a single voice actor do both his speaking and singing voices in a film, the first two being the [[Beast]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and [[John Smith]] from ''[[Pocahontas (film)|Pocahontas]]''.
*Quasimodo is Romani by association, as his mother and father were both gypsies. However, he doesn't share his parents' (and generally all of the film's other gypsies') dark skin tone or black hair. While this can be explained in part due to his isolation within Notre Dame, and since fair skin is not an uncommon trait among Romani, it could also be theorized that he was adopted since the Romani gypsies, as a people, were known as nomadic. As such, seeing a deformed infant mistreated or abandoned, they could have sympathized with him due to their own persecution; it is never stated explicitly that he is the son of the two gypsies in the prologue.
**That being said, his parents in the opening, especially his mother, display a resemblance to [[Esmeralda]], which is possibly a reference to the original novel where the pair were revealed to having been switched at birth.
*[[Clopin]] claims his name means "half-formed". Though the word ''does'' mean that, this is not why he was named so in the original novel; "Quasimodo" is the [[Italy|Italian]] name of the holiday (following Easter) on which he was abandoned on the steps of Notre Dame.
*Quasimodo was mentioned in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' during [[Roger Rabbit|Roger]]'s version of the song "[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]".
**It should be noted that this film came out 8 years before the Disney adaptation of Hunchback of Notre Dame came out.
*Quasimodo surviving at the end is not exclusive to the Disney film. The [[wikipedia:The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] starring Charles Laughton ended with Quasimodo living though he is still not accepted by the public.
*Quasimodo pouring molten metal down the cathedral walls during the final siege in the film implies that he not only rings but also forges them.
*The filmmakers briefly considered having Quasimodo killed off, since that is his fate in the original novel. He was originally supposed to be stabbed by Frollo from then Esmeralda regains consciousness and tries to save him by killing Frollo. Phoebus was then supposed to meet up with them, and Quasimodo's last wish was to ring the bells one last time. They take him to the bells, then Esmeralda and Phoebus help him ring the bells as he dies. The final shot was going to include Esmeralda and Phoebus crying over their best friend as the people of Paris cheer for their success, unaware of Quasimodo's death. Luckily, this is not the ending that was used, as even hardcore fans of the novel agree that the ending used instead was a more suitable conclusion for the theme of this film.
