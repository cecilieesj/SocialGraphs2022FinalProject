'''Mr. Flaversham''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1986]] animated feature film, ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''. He is the father of [[Olivia Flaversham|Olivia]] and is said to be the best toymaker in all of London. His specialty is the creation of clockwork toys.

==Role in the film==
Flaversham is first seen celebrating his daughter, [[Olivia Flaversham|Olivia]]'s birthday by presenting her with a [[Mouse Ballerina|mouse ballerina doll]] that he has made for her. Shortly thereafter, he is kidnapped by [[Fidget]] and taken to [[Ratigan|Professor Ratigan]] to create a [[Robot Queen|clockwork Mouse Queen]] for the professor. Though he starts the project, he is horrified by the whole idea and suddenly refuses to help Ratigan - no matter what - even though he knows he may lose his life. However, when Ratigan threatens to kill Flaversham's daughter, he is forced to return to the task. From these actions, it is shown that Flaversham is a very caring and loving father to Olivia.

Flaversham finishes the clockwork Mouse Queen in time for Ratigan to put his plan into motion. At Buckingham Palace, Ratigan's thugs hold the toymaker at gunpoint to operate the Robot Queen that names Ratigan the new ruler of Mousedom. However, he is soon freed by [[Basil of Baker Street]] and [[Dr. David Q. Dawson]]. As Basil exposes Ratigan and foil his plans, Flaversham is reunited with his daughter, but Fidget manages to free himself of his bonds and kidnaps Olivia. Using a flying apparatus made out of balloons, the Union Jack, and a matchbox, Basil, Dawson, and Flaversham chase after Ratigan, Fidget, and Olivia in [[Ratigan's Blimp|Ratigan's blimp]].

Flaversham and Dawson watch as Basil jump into Ratigan's blimp, which crashes into Big Ben, taking Ratigan, Basil, and Olivia inside the clocktower. Basil rescues Olivia from Ratigan, reunites her with her father, and defeats the evil professor. At the end of the movie, Flaversham is last seen telling Olivia to come along so that they can catch their train.

*It is unknown what happened to Flaversham's wife, the audience is left to presume that she might be deceased.
*Flaversham was voiced by the late Alan Young, who more famously voiced [[Scrooge McDuck]].
*Flaversham is similar to [[Geppetto]].
**Both are toymakers.
**Both are single fathers, with one child.
**Both have a very close bond with their child.
**Both wear big glasses and sport a mustache.
*He is often given the first name Hiram, but there is no canon source for this. The film's dialogue and voice credits only identify him as Flaversham, as does his model sheet. Likewise, the tie-in storybooks only identify him as "Mr. Flaversham" with no first name.
