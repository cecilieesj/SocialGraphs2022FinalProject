== Role in the film==
Morkubine Porcupine is first seen saying "Yo" during Mr. Woolensworth's class where Mr. Woolensworth is doing a roll call. He is later seen during a game of dodgeball with many dodgeballs stuck on his quills where the coach plans to call the nurse to remove all the dodgeballs on his quills. He is later seen during a game of baseball, where he says "No" believing that Chicken Little would lose again in which he eventually wins. He is later seen saying "Woah!" when an alien invasion happens in Oakey Oaks. He is last seen dancing during the credits.

==Trivia ==

*He is a minor character in the film, but he is seen many times in the film's merchandising and promotions.  This is false advertising, as he took little to no part at all.
*He's often considered to be one of the better characters in the movie, mostly thanks to him not being a jerk and having the best lines throughout the movie.
* He only says ''three'' words in the entire movie: "Yo.", "No." and "Whoa!".
