'''Talos''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', played by [[Ben Mendelsohn]]. He is a kind and wise [[Skrull]] leader who flees from the evil forces of the [[Kree]], managing to hide on Earth as '''Keller''', the current director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] While [[Captain Marvel]] at first pursues him, when she finds out the truth, she sets out to protect him and his people and give them a place where they can call home on behalf of her late-Kree mentor [[Mar-Vell]].

He is also the one who confirms to [[Nick Fury]] about Flerken's nasty scratch, when a Flerken [[Goose]] comically scratched S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's left eye.

Several years later, Talos decides to mentor [[Spider-Man]] while disguised as [[Nick Fury]]. Talos teaches Peter all he needs to be a hero and helps Peter defeat [[Mysterio]].

Talos was created by Peter David, Cam Smith and Gary Frank.

==Trivia==
*Talos has known Fury since [[1995]], so he is able to mimic his personality in-depth when Fury needs a stand-in.
