He is a warrior from a parallel dimension. He was accidentally transported to Earth by [[The Raider]], during one of his time travels.

In his world, where he is one of his people bravest warrior, Christopher Columbus never discovers America and Urk's people are in war against European Viking people.{{CharacterStub}}
