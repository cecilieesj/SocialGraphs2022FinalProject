'''Amaya''', also known as '''Owlette''', is the deuteragonist of [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[PJ Masks]]''. She is the only female member of the [[PJ Masks (team)|PJ Masks]]. She wears a red costume designed after owls.

==Background==
Owlette, with her sharp mind and super planning skills, is quick to act. She can fly, has super eyesight, and when she flaps her powerful wings, the bad guys are sent airborne! Keep your "owl eyes" on Owlette! Her Owl Glider can take them all beyond the city streets and with its claws even carry things along with it!

===Personality===
Amaya is a 6-year-old girl who is in first grade, she can be somewhat impatient at times and tends to have a bit of an ego when something lucky happens to her, such as the time she got a lucky basketball shot in [[Owlette the Winner]], but she is beautiful. She can also be a bit selfish at times. Despite this, she is very sweet and cares for Connor and Greg and their safety and is a very eager and nice girl to hang out with, but she can also be harsh when she is mad causing her to be rude. She can also rush into things at times, but she's also helpful, friendly, smart, and funny and nice. But sometimes she has a crush on Connor. She can be flirty, like in the episode "[[Catboy's Tricky Ticket]]".

As Owlette she is very quick with her abilities, though she is also shown to be very clumsy. Like her fellow teammates, childlike immaturity tends to overtake her mindset on the mission, leading to issues (such as becoming too focused on her tablet in "[[Supersonic Owlette]]" and refusing to forgive Catboy for an earlier mistake in "[[Owlette's Terrible Pterodactyl Trouble]]"), but this is always realized and corrected leading to the mission being done properly, and the villain's plans foiled.

===Physical appearance===
Amaya has fair skin, brown eyes (red when she turns into Owlette) with long eyelashes, long dark brown hair with a pink owl wing barrette. Her daytime outfit consists of a red-and-pink dress with a pair of leggings underneath, pink Mary Jane shoes, and red cat-eye glasses.

The outfit of Amaya's nighttime hero, Owlette, consists of a red-and-pink owl jumpsuit and mask.

When she was turned evil in the episode "[[Gekko and the Opposite Ray]]", her outfit becomes purple-and-lavender with a pale purple logo, and her eyes became violet. The same way she makes her a bit irritable. 

===Powers and abilities===
*'''Super Owl Eyes''': Can see at nighttime.
*'''Super Owl Wings''': Can fly with her cape, like wings.
*'''Owl Wing Wind''': Can make a wind from the owl wings and be useful to blow the smoke screen away
*'''Super Owl Feathers''': (first seen in "[[Wacky Floats]]", and officially introduced in "[[PJ Power Up]]") Can shoot energy feathers from the owl wings, which can be used as projectiles.
*'''Super Feather Shield''': (officially introduced in "[[Owlette Comes Clean]]") Can create a huge shield using owl feathers.
*'''Super Owl Swoop''': (officially introduced in "[[Way of the Woofy]]"): Swoops down during flight; a sub-power of Super Owl Wings.
*'''Owl Feather Nest''': (officially introduced in "[[Ninja Power Up]]"): Can create a large cage-like nest with her owl feathers to trap opponents.

==Trivia==
*Amaya is friends with [[Catboy|Connor]] and [[Gekko|Greg]] and considers them best friends.
*She has a love for birds, mostly owls.
*Amaya's appearance is similar to Shope's from ''{{WikipediaLink|Supernoobs}}'' and Hazel Charming's from ''{{WikipediaLink|Little Charmers}}''.
*Amaya is a bit of a tomboy.
*Night Ninja is one of her rivals, and they often donâ€™t get along much.
