He was voiced by animatorÂ [[Milt Kahl]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Ferdinand the Bull]]''===
As the titular protagonist of the short, Ferdinand would sit quietly in the shade all day and smell the flowers rather than play with the other calves, much to his mother telling him to play with them. As his mother was understanding, she allowed him to relax in the shade and as the years passed, Ferdinand became older and stronger. As all the other bulls are preparing to fight in Madrid, Ferdinand refuses because all he does all day is smell the flowers in a peaceful moment while sitting near his favorite tree.

Unaware, he accidentally sits on a flower with a bumblebee on it, causing Ferdinand to rampage in an out-of-control behavior; the five men looking for a perfect bull to fight with the matador chose Ferdinand as he would be perfect for the match. Later at the bullring, the matador tries to fight against Ferdinand, but he refuses to fight against his opponent because all Ferdinand did was smell the flowers quietly, much to the matador enraged at him until he tears his shirt open and shows a tattoo in the form of a red flower on his chest which Ferdinand licks and the humiliated matador starts to cry because he cannot show what he can do with his cape and sword. As a result, Ferdinand is taken out of the bullring back to his home; Ferdinand happily lives at his favorite corner tree sitting quietly once again.

===Other appearances===
Ferdinand also appears in the [[Disney+]] animated short, ''[[The Simpsons in Plusaversary]]'' where he attends the Disney+ second year anniversary with many other characters from various Disney properties, where he is seen with his design from the 1938 incarnation.

==Trivia==
*Ferdinand was also the lead in a [[wikipedia:Ferdinand (film)|self-titled]] film adaptation from [[Blue Sky Studios]] where he was voiced by [[John Cena]]. While the film is currently owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], following its acquisition [[21st Century Fox]], it was released before the purchase was made official and thus, is a Disney film by extension rather than direct association.
*Ferdinand was also mentioned by [[Shirley Temple]] when presenting [[Walt Disney]] with his special honorary Academy Award for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (one big Oscar and seven little ones) when calling him "the daddy of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Mickey Mouse, Ferdinand and all the others".
