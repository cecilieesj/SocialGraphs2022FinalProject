'''Saleem''' is a character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. He made his debut in the [[Destined|third episode]] of the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'', and is portrayed by Dan Carter.

Saleem is a member of the [[Clandestines]]. He is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]], who was exiled to Earth, and has been searching a way to return home, ever since. He and the other members of the group seek out [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]], who is possession of a [[bangle]], which may be an instrumental key, in their return. While in pursuit of her, Saleem was captured by the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]] and briefly detained, before escaping their prison. He then proceeded to make his way to Karachi, where Kamala Khan was, but lost his life to [[Waleed]], the leader of the [[Order of the Red Daggers|Red Daggers]].

==Background==
Saleem is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]]. He, [[Najma]], [[Aisha]], [[Fariha]], and [[Aadam]], were collectively known as the [[Clandestines]]. Unknown circumstances lead to their exile. On Earth, they were left in a weakened state, and unable to access Noor to its full extent.

He and the other Clandestines learnt from a man in a temple, that they needed to find two bangles, which would allow them to return back to their home dimension.

In British Occupied India, 1942, Saleem, Najma, and Fariha search through the ruins of an underground cave, for the bangles. Najma calls them over, after finding [[bangle|one]], and Aisha takes hold of it. Saleem questions where the other bangle is and Fariha reminds him, that it's likely in possession of the British, as they've already ransacked and looted the cave. When the group gets sound of the British Army, who are nearby, and Saleem goes, along with Fariha to check in on Aadam. They find the British attempting to destroy the cave by setting it on fire.

The Clandestines manage to escape from the Army's grasp, but are unable to locate Aisha, who disappeared with the bangle. They continue to go on the run.
At some point, Najma has a son, with a human, whom she names Kamran. Kamran joins their ranks, and Aadam becomes acquainted with him.
When Kamala Khan puts on the bangle, she unlocks her access to Noor, and Saleem and the other Clandestines are able to sense her, discovering that Aisha had kin, of this world.

====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Kamala arrives in Aadam's home, after [[Najma]] and [[Kamran]], rescue her from the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]] and she informs Kamala of the [[Clandestines]] shared history with her grandmother, before she disappeared. Najma reveals that Kamran thinks Kamala is adorable, and Saleem and the others begin to tease him over his apparent crush.

As Kamala runs through the hallways, Saleem follows her, and incapacitates a security guard, on his way over. She bolts into the kitchen, and Saleem follows her in with [[Fariha]], and he attempts to attack her, only to be blocked by her shield. He runs after her, and she blocks another attack of his, causing him to stumble onto a stove, and setting his sleeve on fire. Kamala escapes the group’s sights, and Saleem and the others roam the kitchen in search for her. They manage to locate her, and Kamala ends up in the main hall, where Saleem goes after her, with the other Clandestines. He removes his belt, which transforms into a large whip, and leaps into her direction, and throws his whip in her path, which she runs from. He finds Kamala hiding under a table, and is ready to strike, when [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] throws a box at him. Saleem hurls a chair back, and in response, Kamala creates an elongated fist, which punches him in the face. Saleem quickly recovers and finds his path blocked by Kamran, and the two begin to fight. Kamran manages to throw a few punches in Saleem's way, but he pushes him through the glass railing, knocking him unconscious, and in Kamala and Bruno's way. Saleem and the other Clandestines corner the pair, when suddenly, Damage Control sweeps the building. They fire a weapon, towards the group which neutralizes them, and they are arrested by the organization.

The Clandestines are escorted into the D.O.D.C. Supermax Prison, where they are taken into custody. They are handcuffed to the railing, and walk in line, by the lead of the guards. A scuffle between the guards and the other Clandestines ensues, resulting in the guards being rendered unconscious. Saleem and the others free themselves from the restraints and attempt to find an exit from the prison. He supports Kamran who was injured, but he is instructed to leave him behind, on Najma's orders. Saleem apologizes and joins the others as they depart.

The group track Kamala in Karachi, Pakistan, and arrive in pursuit of her. They break into the headquarters, of the [[Order of the Red Daggers]], through the glass ceiling. A skirmish ensues, but he is bested by [[Waleed]], as Kamala and the [[Red Dagger]] escape. Saleem battles Waleed, but he is bested by the latter.

The Clandestines fight spills onto the streets, as they follow, Kamala, the Red Dagger and Kareem, out of the Headquarters.
