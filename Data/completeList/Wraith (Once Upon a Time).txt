The '''Wraith''', also known as '''Qui Shen''' in [[Mulan|Mulan's]] home land, is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. It makes its only appearance in the episode "[[Broken (Once Upon a Time)|Broken]]".

==Role in the series==
In [[Storybrooke]], the Dark Curse has been broken, and [[Belle#Once Upon a Time|Belle]] has told [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]] that she had been held in the asylum for 28 years by [[The Evil Queen#Once Upon a Time|Regina]]. Mr. Gold is furious, but Belle makes him promise not to kill Regina, as proof that he is a changed man. He goes to the back room of his shop and takes a medallion from the cabinet. Mr. Gold uses it to summon the wraith to Storybrooke to take Regina's soul from her in retaliation.
Although the wraith nearly takes Regina, [[Snow White#Once Upon a Time|Mary Margaret]], [[The Prince#Once Upon a Time|David]], and [[Emma Swan]] rescue her from the wraith. In an attempt to get rid of the wraith and save Regina for [[Henry Mills]], the four of them lure the wraith to the town hall, where they attempt to use [[Mad Hatter#Once Upon a Time|Jefferson]]'s [[Mad Hatter's hat#Once Upon a Time|hat]] to send the wraith away. They succeed, but Emma and Mary Margaret are pulled into the portal, with the wraith, to the [[Enchanted Forest]].

The wraith appears in [[Aurora#Once Upon a Time|Aurora]]'s Palace seconds after [[Fa Mulan#Once Upon a Time|Mulan]] and [[Prince Phillip#Once Upon a Time|Prince Phillip]] find Aurora. The wraith wears a golden medallion around its neck that is grabbed by Prince Phillip, which marks him for death by the wraith sucking out his soul. The medallion is later given to Aurora by Mulan.

Aurora is captured by [[Queen of Hearts#Once Upon a Time|Cora]] who wants the magic compass and Emma and Mary Margaret's plans. She tells Aurora that even though the wraith took Prince Phillip's soul, it was not destroyed, but merely sent to another realm. If Aurora will help her, Cora will try to return it to his body. Aurora, however, does not trust Cora and will not betray her friends.

Aurora gives this information to Mulan and the two agree to find a way to retrieve Phillip's soul.
