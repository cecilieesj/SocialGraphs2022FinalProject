==Background==
===Personality===
Unlike his father, Sir Cassius is an honorable man who has a high regard for rules and honor. Also unlike his father, he is a good sport who can take losing well. Despite being honorable and a good sport, Cassius struggled to stand up for himself when dealing with pressure from his father. Only after being defeated by Elena did he have the confidence to go against his father.

==Role in the Series==
Sir Cassius first appears in "[[The Princess Knight]]" when he is preparing for the Swordsman Cup. When Sir Elezar takes his turn, Cassius is impressed with the contestant, but his father Lord Elrod is far from pleased. Lord Elrod urges him to strike Sir Elezar's wrist with his sword's handle and make it look like an accident. Cassius refuses on the grounds because that's cheating, but his father tells him it's only cheating if the referee thinks he did it on purpose and that he did the same thing to beat Queen Lucia of Avalor to win the tournament, to Sir Cassius's disgust. Sir Elezar beats him and reveals herself as Princess Elena, Queen Lucia's daughter. Sir Cassius gracefully accepts his defeat and gives her the trophy.
