'''Luke the Goose''' is the father of [[Gus Goose]] an uncle of [[Donald Duck]].

He was created by [[Carl Barks]], in a text-only Donald Duck family tree he sketched for personal use in the 1950s. Here, Barks intended him to be [[Gladstone Gander]]'s father, [[Daphne Duck]]'s husband, [[Grandma Duck]]'s son-in-law and Gus Goose's uncle.

Luke made his first appearance on Mark Worden's illustrated version of the aforementioned tree (first printed in [[1981]]). His appearance was based on that of a background character in Barks' ''Donald Duck'' comic ''Jet Witch'' (first printed in [[1961]]).<ref>http://goofy313g.free.fr/calisota_online/trees/ducktrees/worden.html</ref>

When Barks was asked to sketch out a Duck family tree again in the 1990s, making Goosetave Gander (who was originally Gladstone's adoptive father after Gladstone was orphaned when Luke and Daphne "overate at a free-lunch picnic") Gladstone's biological father and Daphne's husband. When [[Don Rosa]] created a ''Duck Family Tree'' (first printed in [[1993]]), he used Luke again (removing the "the" in his name), and featured him as Gus Goose's father and the husband of Donald's [[Fanny Coot|Aunt Fanny]].

On the Dutch interactive version of the Duck family tree, Luke was said to be a genealogist, and the creator of the Duck family tree.

Luke and Aunt Fanny made a brief cameo appearance in the streets of [[Duckburg]] in ''[[Dangerous Currency]] ''([[2011]]).
