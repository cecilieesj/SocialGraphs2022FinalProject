'''Mrs. Johnson''' who allegedly also goes by the nickname '''"Hawkeye" Johnson''',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0352295/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_5</ref> is a recurring character on the animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. She is the mother of [[Jeremy Johnson]] and [[Suzy Johnson]] and wife of [[Jack Johnson]]. She is the sister-in-law of Joe Johnson and probably the daughter-in-law of Hildegard.

She has appeared several times (mostly in background shots).

==Relationships==
===Family===
====[[Suzy Johnson]]====
Suzy and her mother have yet to be seen interacting but it is safe to assume that she is unnaware of Suzy's darker personality.  Its also assumed that Suzy is close with her mother as well.
====[[Jeremy Johnson]]====
It appears that Jeremy and his mother are quite close and Jeremy often helps her with anything animal. ("[[Misperceived Monotreme]]", "[[Bad Hair Day (Phineas and Ferb)|Bad Hair Day]]")
===Other===
====[[Candace Flynn]]====
She gets a good impression of Candace after she "saved" a tangerine orangutan which happened to be [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] covered with Candace's hair. ("[[Bad Hair Day (Phineas and Ferb)|Bad Hair Day]]")
==Trivia==
*[[Jane Lynch]] from ''Glee'' recorded dialogue for Jeremy's mother on January 13, 2010, to be used in "[[Run, Candace, Run]]"<ref name="Twitter1">[http://twitter.com/DanPovenmire/status/7736414316 Tweet from Dan Povenmire]</ref> and spoke for the first time in [[Canderemy]].
*She has an Associates degree in Zoology ("[[Bad Hair Day (Phineas and Ferb)|Bad Hair Day]]").
*She calls herself "Hawkeye Johnson", most likely because she has a good aim ("[[Bad Hair Day (Phineas and Ferb)|Bad Hair Day]]").
