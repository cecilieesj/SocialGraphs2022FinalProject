==Appearances==
===''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]''===
Obby is first seen in [[Atlantis (location)|Atlantis]] with [[Kida Nedakh|Kida]] (now Queen, and married to [[Milo Thatch|Milo]]). After Kida restores her city's former glory using the [[Heart of Atlantis]], she and Obby travel over to see Milo. Obby then runs over to greet Milo by jumping on top of him and licking his face. Later, Obby accompanies Milo, Kida, [[Audrey Ramirez|Audrey]], [[Vincenzo Santorini|Vinnie]], [[Gaetan Moliére|Mole]], and [[Joshua Sweet|Joshua]] on three exciting and dangerous quests. He often helps out when the team is in trouble, such as trying to stop a huge leak in their sub pod by chomping at the flowing water, gnawing through ropes when Milo and his friends are tied up, and saving them from a vicious wolf by biting on the wolf's tail. At the end of the film, Obby is seen back in Atlantis with Milo, Kida, and their comrades as they celebrate the world being a better place.
