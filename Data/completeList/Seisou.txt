'''Seisou''' is a character featured in the third season of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is a gibbon who lives in the tropical forest alongside neighboring animals the Lion Guard encounters.

==Background==
===Personality===
Seisou is good in greeting other animals when the Lion Guard and Makini are mingling with Tenuk. However, he is fearful of Tuliza as it is linked to Mama Binturong and her porcupines.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Mama Binturong]]''===
Seisou is seen alongside a mongoose named Bambun when the Lion Guard and Makini are mingling with Tenuk to which the two animals greet Beshte after Tenuk introduces the hippo to them. However, when Makini asks Tenuk for Tuliza, Seisou and Bambun are worried what she did to Tenuk to which he also fled in terror after Makini said the same word she said to Tenuk. He later appears in the [[You Best Not Mess With Mama|musical sequence focusing on Mama Binturong's plan on taking every Tuliza she finds]].

When Beshte asks Seisou to where Makini's staff is at as he gets frightened upon hearing the word "Tuliza", Bunga tries to ask him that it's not Tuliza the Guard is talking about to which he refuses to listen as he suggests Anga to talk to Bambun, the mongoose who was mingling with him. Talking to Bambun, Kion tells him that Seisou told the Guard about Makini's staff as he suggests talking to Tompok, the civet and a mouse deer to know who would know about the staff. The Guard decides to talk to Seisou in the cave about the staff after talking to the mouse deer.

At the cave, Seisou tells the Lion Guard that the cave is the only private place to talk about Tuliza so no porcupines can hear anyone saying "Tuliza". He explains that he doesn't want Mama Binturong to know he is helping the Guard find the missing staff as the staff has Tuliza in it and it could be linked to Mama Binturong. He explains that Mama Binturong controls all Tuliza in the tropical forest and the animals in the forest are afraid to say this word as it only makes her angry and whenever she gets angry, she can be frightening to the animals. Seisou then warns the group that any animal who takes Tuliza causes Mama Binturong and her porcupines to go after the animals taking Tuliza to which Kion asks him to know where to find him. He then explains that Mama Binturong's hideout is in the Stone Forest, which is almost impossible to get through and only Mama Binturong and her porcupines get through it safely. After talking to Seisou, the Lion Guard plans to deal with the problem about Mama Binturong.
