'''Ferguson Michaels''' (portrayed by De'Vaughn Nixon) is an actor on ''MacKenzie Falls'' who plays the character of Trevor, MacKenzie's best friend.

He got SPS from Tawni Hart's Extreme Skinny Jeans in "Walk a Mile in My Pants." In "The Legend of Candy Face," he was one of the ''MacKenzie Falls'' cast members who went camping with the cast of ''So Random!''. He was Tawni's partner for the trust exercises, so that means he hates Tawni the most because, according to Ms. Bitterman, they have been paired to the person they hate the most. He is considered to be very similar to Tawni as in he is very big on style.

Ferguson is from Baton Rouge, [[Louisiana]].
