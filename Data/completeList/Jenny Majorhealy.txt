[[File:Jenny_Majorheely.png|thumb]]'''Jennifer "Jenny" Majorhealy''' is a 16-year-old girl. She once dated [[T.J. Taylor]], but he turned her into a middle-aged woman. [[Alex Russo|Alex]] turned her back into a teenager and made her promise not to tell anyone. She knows Alex's secret and has a weird squeal, which annoys [[Harper Finkle|Harper]]. She is in the Happy Helpers Club. The character's last name is a pun on the ''I Dream of Jeannie'' character Major (Roger) Healey.

She's portrayed by [[Gilland Jones]] and her middle-aged self, due to T.J. changing her, was portrayed by Heidi Swedberg.

As a 40-year-old woman, she poses as an art teacher at Tribeca Prep, but during one class, she noticed that Alex seemed to be uncannily fast at cleaning up after class, and suspected that she is actually a wizard, just like T.J. She confronted Alex about this and was turned back into a teenager on the condition that she doesn't tell anyone that the Russos are a family of wizards.

As a teenager, Jenny has a very high-pitched squeal that she emits very often, which Alex and Harper found rather annoying upon turning her back, and suspect that it may have been one of the reasons why T.J. couldn't stand her anymore.
