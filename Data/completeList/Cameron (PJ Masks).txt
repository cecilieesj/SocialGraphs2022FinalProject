'''Cameron '''is a recurring character from the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[PJ Masks]]''. He is also Connor, Amaya, and Greg's friend.

==Background==
===Personality===
Cameron loves playing sports and considers to be Connor's rival. He often serves as the referee for basketball games at the School's playground, usually blowing the whistle. Outside of sports, he is shown to be somewhat pushy towards Connor, Greg and Amaya, often asking them to help him with his work. Despite this, he has not yet officially bullied any of his classmates. In "Gekko and the Snore-A-Saurus", Cameron was sleep-walking and sleep-ballet dancing but didn't know about it as Luna Girl used her luna-magnet to turn Cameron into a life-size puppet. This could mean that he has a gentler side at home.

===Physical appearance ===
Cameron has tan skin, dark brown dreadlocks, and green eyes. He wears a yellow sweater, red varsity like-vest, blue jeans, and green-and-red sneakers.

==Trivia==
*Cameron is also the classmate of Connor, Amaya, and Greg from their school during daytime
**It is revealed that he is sleepwalking in the episode "[[Gekko and the Snore-A-Saurus]]".
*In "[[Halloween Tricksters]]", He finally meets the [[PJ Masks (team)|PJ Masks]], but unaware of their true identities, due to the following:
**The PJ Masks deepen their voices to avoid knowing who they really are.
**He also meets the nighttime villains for the first time but thinks that they're just bad kids.
*He can be a bit of a bully sometimes but doesn't actually harm anyone.
*His voice actor from Season 1, Tristan Samuel, was also the voice of Chase from Season 1 of ''PAW Patrol''.
*Cameron is the most hated character by fans in the show, even more, surpassing Romeo, Night Ninja, and Luna Girl.
