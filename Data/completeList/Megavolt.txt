'''Megavolt''' (real name '''Elmo Sputterspark''') is an anthropomorphic rat, and one of the main villains and a member of the [[Fearsome Five]] from ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''

==History==
=== ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' ===
As revealed in the episode "[[Clash Reunion]]", as a teenager, Elmo Sputterspark was fascinated with electricity and magnetism and, along with [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Drake Mallard]], was tormented by Hamm String, the local school bully, because of his "nerd" status. During a static-electricity experiment gone awry because of a couple of school jocks, Elmo's body became infused with so much electricity that he was able to harness its power and shoot it at any target he chose. The brightness of the electricity caused his eyes to shrink (explaining the goggles). The trauma also affected him psychologically, causing him to go completely insane. It is said that he disappeared from school sometime before graduation and began his villainous career just after that.

At the high school dance, he showed up in a yellow suit and tried to give himself the name "Megawatt", but the band that was playing at the dance had the same name, so, to avoid ambiguity, he gave himself the name "Megavolt." However, Drake Mallard had defeated him as his new identity, "Darkwing Duck". Neither would see each other until many years later, and again on opposing sides.

Over the years, Megavolt became one of Darkwing's most formidable enemies, and would often be seen partnered up with [[Quackerjack]]. Both of them would also become part of [[Negaduck]]'s group, the [[Fearsome Five]].

=== ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales (2017)]]'' ===
In "[[Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!]]", Megavolt - or rather, an actor playing him - makes a cameo appearance on the ''Darkwing Duck'' TV show when [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]] is explaining to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] about Darkwing and the actor who played him, [[Negaduck|Jim Starling]].

In "[[The Duck Knight Returns!]]", Dewey, who was put in charge of production of a ''Darkwing Duck'' movie by [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]] (to director Alistair Boorswan's dismay), had the idea of casting an actor to play Megavolt in the final scene of the movie. When Scrooge looked the actor hired by his grandnephew over, he stated that "the villain's mustache [had] to be at least twice as twirly". However, no one except an oblivious Launchpad knew that the Darkwing at the movie set was not the actor hired to play the character, but Jim Starling, who attacked the Megavolt actor and commandeered the lightning ray gun as the studio was set ablaze. The Megavolt actor was last seen evacuating the studio with the other actors as Jim insanely declared that he would film the finale and kill anyone who got in his way.

In "[[Let's Get Dangerous!]]", the real Megavolt is summoned from an alternate dimension where the events of the ''Darkwing Duck'' TV show actually happened by [[Taurus Bulba]], to assist him in his scheme alongside Quackerjack, Bushroot and Liquidator.

===Powers and abilities===
True to his name, Megavolt has the ability to manipulate electricity. In battle, Megavolt tends to shoot lightning bolts and electrocute his enemies as well as to defend himself. Since his suit is designed to absorb electricity, defeating Megavolt with his own powers ultimately makes the villain stronger. In addition to summoning lightning, he can activate and control nearby machines to do his bidding.

Megavolt's greatest weakness is that he shorts out completely whenever he comes in contact with water. Because of this, Darkwing has defeated him numerous times when engaging him in battle.

==Trivia==
*Megavolt is similar to the ''Spider-Man'' villain [[Electro]] and the Superman villain Livewire, as the three of them have the powers of electricity.
*Being voiced by Dan Castellaneta, who is best known for voicing Homer Simpson and other characters on ''The Simpsons'', Megavolt's voice resembles that of one of Castellaneta's ''Simpsons'' characters, Krusty the Clown.
*Darkwing has some respect for him and has referred to him as his arch-enemy, a title Megavolt thinks of as an honor.
