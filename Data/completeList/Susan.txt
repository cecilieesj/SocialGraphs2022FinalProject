'''Susan''' is a character from the ''[[Disney Dream]]/[[Disney Fantasy]]'' interactive attraction, [[Midship Detective Agency]]. She is a detective trainer who helps detectives on their missions to solve cases and find the culprit responsible for thefts onboard the ship.

==Background==
Susan is a detective trainer who helps detectives figure out the cases onboard the ''[[Disney Dream]]'' or ''[[Disney Fantasy]]'' ships. She is not physically seen onscreen as only her voice is heard throughout the attraction, although a photo of Susan herself is located on her casebook with a paperclip on the upper right side of her photo. According to her casebook, she is capable of expertising detective tools and technology as well as specializing various sorts of theft as well as missing persons whenever trouble happens onboard the ship.

===Physical Appearance===
Although Susan is not physically seen in person in the attraction with only her voice heard throughout it, her photo depicts her with fair skin, dark brown hair, a pair of square-shaped eyeglasses, light blue eyes, and a sky blue t-shirt covered by a light brown coat with a Midship Detective Agency badge on it (though her full body is not shown on the photo). Behind Susan herself in her photo is the Detective Agency in the background.

==Role in the attraction==
Whenever the player starts a case in "Midship Detective Agency", Susan checks in either with [[Mickey Mouse]] (if the Case of the Plundered Paintings or the Case of the Missing Puppies storyline is chosen) or [[Kermit the Frog]] (if the Case of the Stolen Show storyline is chosen) to know what is the case for today. During the intro of each case, Susan instructs the guests that the object they will be using is a card representing a high-tech detective badge, which is required to solve the case to which in order to use the badge, the guest must face the black-and-white pattern toward the center of the screen while holding the badge from the bottom without having their finger covering the front of the badge as well as keeping the badge straight up and down while standing on the magnifying glass icon.

Once the guest picks up the badge and stands on the magnifying glass icon, Susan instructs the guest to move the badge to match the outline to ready themselves on the case so that guests can practice solving the case and finding the culprit. Susan also instructs the guests that in certain occasions, they either must rotate the badge (in case when guests must use keys) or use the badge to push objects to reveal clues (such as using a tack to pop balloons or interacting with the scenery in a fish tank to reveal a clue required to solve the case) as well as teaching guests how to hold the badge correctly (if a guest is using the badge an improper way such as moving the badge icon too fast, Susan will tell the guests to slow down to give advice to guests to help find a clue the proper way). However, if the guest uses a badge whose number is currently in use, Susan will tell the guest to choose another badge with a different number in order to begin the case. After instructing these steps, Susan tells the guests to pick up a casebook and a pencil to write notes in order to find the culprit and solve the case all around the ship. Every playthrough in each case at the ''Disney Dream'' or ''Disney Fantasy'' ship features a different culprit.
