}}'''Dim-Witty Duck''', as his name indicates, is not very bright. In fact, he is very much a duck version of [[Goofy]]. An occasional sidekick of [[Donald Duck]]'s, his role seemed to mirror that of Goofy to [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]. Later he signed on as [[Moby Duck]]'s ship hand, serving pretty much the same Goofy-like role. It is unclear whether he is a member of the extended Duck Family. He made his first comic appearance in the comic story "The Vanishing Banister" (''Walt Disney's Comics & Stories'' #330, March 1968). Unlike Moby Duck, he has not made an animated appearance on film or TV.
