When [[Amigo]] is adopted by Lydia A she gives him this collar, explaining that she found it in a thrift store. While sleeping, Amigo notices the collar he is wearing is not an ordinary collar but rather a robotic one that is able to speak. Introducing itself to Amigo, it explains that its systems detect high hero potential where it takes Amigo to a special mission. Feeling uncomfortable. C.O.L.L.A.R. tells Amigo to get used to this while looking for danger such as many kittens occupying a spot where Amigo launches balls of yarn to distract them.

While on a boat, C.O.L.L.A.R. senses the ship tilting back and forth, telling Amigo to stay on horizon backs of the waves making him seasick. When a nearby dolphin arrives, Amigo asks C.O.L.L.A.R. to translate what the dolphin is saying to which he explains that this dolphin is named Steve who is looking for his mate after downloading a translation software on its system. C.O.L.L.A.R., who is a solar-powered object, then takes Amigo on an underwater mission to rescue the dolphin trapped in kelp. Underwater, Amigo manages to rescue the female dolphin and reunite her with his mate. C.O.L.L.A.R., however, runs out of battery, forcing Amigo to swim to the surface while avoiding jellyfish. Up to the surface, C.O.L.L.A.R. regains power again, praising Amigo for quick thinking. It then congratulates him for hero potential for rescuing a dolphin in danger.
