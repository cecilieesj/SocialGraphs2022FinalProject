'''Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], played by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]. She appears in ''[[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier]]'' series and in the films ''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]'', and ''[[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever]]''.

Valentina Allegra de Fontaine was created by [[Stan Lee]], Roy Thomas, Jim Steranko, Herb Trimpe and Marie Severin.

She is gathering a batch of Earth's skilled and powerful individuals to work for the organization she is associated to. She recruits John Walker after he lost the Captain America mantle and fought [[Sam Wilson|Sam]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], so Valentina makes him the [[U.S. Agent]]. She also tasks [[Yelena Belova]] into targeting [[Hawkeye]] in her next assassination mission, but tricks her by pointing out that he is responsible for [[Black Widow]]'s death, leaving out the proper context behind Natasha's death, that being that Clint wanted to trade places with Natasha as the one to sacrifice themself for the [[Infinity Stones|Soul Stone]] on [[Vormir]] in order to undo [[Thanos]]â€™s snap.
