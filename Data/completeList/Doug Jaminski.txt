[[File:Doug_Jaminski.png|thumb]]'''Doug Jaminski''' is a background character of [[Disney XD]]'s series ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''.

==Biography==
He is a student and a member of the Wave Slayers at [[Norrisville High]] School. He is the brother of [[Bash Johnson]].

==Trivia==
*We learn his name in [[Wave Slayers]] when Heidi announces it on her webcast of the Wave Slayer race.
*He is shown in the background of numerous episodes, mostly when hanging around Bash Johnson.
*Strangely enough, in [[The Tale of the Golden Doctor's Note]], he was one of the boys (led by Randy) that helped swing the rope so Howard wouldn't be hit by the balls thrown by Bash and his friends.
**However, he is one of Bash's friends in other episodes, so this moment and the episode in general is very bizarre in comparison. Bash even called him a "nerd."
