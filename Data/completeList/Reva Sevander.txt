'''Reva Sevander''' (also known as the '''Third Sister''') is an Imperial [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] who appears in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, ''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]''.

==Background==
Reva was a [[Jedi]] youngling who was present in the Jedi Temple during Order 66. When the clones raided the temple, Reva and her fellow younglings found [[Anakin Skywalker]] and asked him for help, only for him to kill them all. Reva survived by playing dead, and she swore revenge on Anakin. After the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] rose to power, she became a member of the Inquisitorius, tasked by [[Darth Vader]] to hunt down the remaining [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] who survived Order 66. However, this is actually only a cover for her to get close to Vader so she can kill him for murdering her friends. 

In her hunt for Jedi-in-hiding, she is known to be ruthlessly ambitious.

==Personality==
Reva has a very tough personality. She is not easily manipulated. She is very determined and focused on her goals.
