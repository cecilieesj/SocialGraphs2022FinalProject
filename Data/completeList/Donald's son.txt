|status = Active}}'''Donald's son''', possibly named '''Donald Jr.''', is an anthropomorphic duckling, who is the toddler son of [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Daisy Duck]]. He appeared in the [[1959]] cartoon short, ''[[How to Have an Accident at Work]]'', where his father wants him to help make the household safer and less hazardous.

==Background==
===Personality===
Donald's son is innocent, sweet and naive. Unlike his cousins who give Donald a hard time, Junior is very loyal to his father and clearly looks up to him. In his brief appearance, he is shown to somewhat be afraid of Donald's famous temper tantrums, but he learns from them and even seems to slightly exhibit early signs of Donald's annoyed expressions. Regardless, he has a good relationship with his father, whom he loves dearly, as well as his mother Daisy.

===Physical appearance===
Donald's son looks like a tiny carbon copy of Donald, and even wears a blue jumper all the time. While he can stand on his own, he still sits in a high chair at the breakfast table. From this, it can be deduced that he is slightly younger than his more famous cousins.
