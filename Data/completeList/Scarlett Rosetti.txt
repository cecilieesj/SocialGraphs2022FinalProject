She is originally [[Teena Sometimes|Teena's]] stunt double in the show Teena Sometimes but later becomes Scarlet Letter, Teena's nemesis. She is voiced by [[Alyssa Milano]].

==Character==
Scarlett originally begins on the cartoon with a job as a stunt woman for Brianna's favorite television show. Despite doing all the hard work she doesn't get any respect from the show or Teena's fans, Kick is the first one to appreciate all the awesome stunt work she does for the show. She ends up quitting after Kick shows her how to be her own person, but then becomes her own character on the show in the end. It is hinted during the episode that Kick might be attracted to Scarlett. After seeing what she really looks like, his mouth is wide open and he shyly asks her (but trying to confirm) if she likes stunts.

==Relationships==

===Kick Buttowski===
Kick and Scarlett may have a small crush on each other. This is shown when a scene of them drinking a huge bucket of Cheetah Chug! is shown. Later, they are skydiving, so, they are looking at each other as if enamoured with each other. Even though he only shows some possible love signs at the beginning of the episode, Kick is possibly still in love with Scarlett.

===Teena (sometimes)===
Scarlett and Teena didn't have too much of a friendship nor anything else. She was just Teena's stunt-double. And now, is Teena's nemesis on Teena's self-titled show, Teena Sometimes.

==Trivia==
*Even though Scarlett is an one-time character, she has a very big fanbase. This is because she's a very different girl in the cartoon and seemingly has a crush on Kick (like Kendall).
*She's the 3rd girl on the cartoon who has a crush on Kick. The 1st is Jackie and the 2nd is Kendall.
*Many fans confuse her name with Scarlet Rosetti instead of Scarlett Rosetti. But her official name is Scarlett, as seen in *"And... Action!"'s ending credits.
*In the cartoon, there's a background character similar to Scarlett.
