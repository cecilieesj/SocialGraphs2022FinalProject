'''The Orphans''' are an unruly group of children (always looking like a younger [[Mickey Mouse]]) for whom the gang is always trying to help out in the form of shows, picnics, etc. The gang's philanthropy, however, is usually not returned in the same spirit. [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]] were created at the same time as the Orphans and were, in their first appearances, virtually indistinguishable from them.

==Physical Appearance==
The Orphans share a strong resemblance to Mickey during his youth, except that they each wear a sailor hat and pajama gown (the color of the gown is usually a shade of blue). However, there is no way of distinguishing the Orphans from one another as they are identical. 

==Personality==
The Orphans are mischievous, always causing trouble for Donald Duck by stealing food from him as well as feeding him a bee-stuffed sandwich. However, they are not without a playful side as the Orphans will play a game with Mickey.
