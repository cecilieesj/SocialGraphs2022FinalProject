'''Gruffi Gummi''' is one of the protagonists of ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
Gruffi is an old-fashioned bear who prefers to do things "the Gummi way", and the de facto leader of Gummi Glen. He can be extremely strict, serious, and irritable, but he is respected for his common sense and is considered a voice of stability. He is a skilled craftsman and is usually the one to repair Gummi technology and build traps to deal with [[Ogres]] and humans. As a craftsman, he tends to be a perfectionist, which can be his undoing at times. 

He was initially distrustful of [[Cavin]], the first human he made contact with, but Gruffi would later admit that he secretly likes the boy. He is even more reticient when [[Princess Calla]] becomes privy to their community, but if anything, he grows to like her even more.

===D23 Description===
:''Conservative to the very soles of his feet, Gruffi Gummi is never truly happy unless he has something to be unhappy about.''

==Role in the series==
At the beginning of the show, Gruffi is part of a small caretaker colony who live at the ancestral home of the [[Gummi Bears]], [[Gummi Glen]]. Though the colony once was fairly large, it has since dwindled, along with the Gummies' knowledge of their past. After an encounter with a boy named Cavin, Gruffi's fellow Gummi, Zummi, gains a [[Gummi Bear Medallion]]. The medallion not only allows Zummi to open the "[[Great Book of Gummi]]", which contains all the knowledge of the Gummi Bears, but allows Zummi to perform magic as well. Gaining the knowledge they had lost, Gruffi takes up the role of protecting the nearby [[Dunwyn Castle|kingdom of Dunwyn]], while repairing the long-dormant Gummi technology, such as the [[Quick Tunnels]].

Early on, Gruffi is shown to clash with [[Grammi Gummi|Grammi]]. The two are forced to work together when all the other Gummies are turned into statues; Grammi and Gruffi would have to repair a broken tablet that contains the counterspell. Later on, Gruffi gets in trouble with his headstrong tactics, becoming the victim of a Slumber Sprite which puts him to sleep. Grammi tas to take [[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] on a journey to find the sprite and finds herself having to teach Cubbi to take a more cautious approach when recuing their sleepwalking friend, as opposed to Gruffi's more forward methods.

Gruffi is one of two Gummies to discover [[Gusto Gummi|Gusto]], a lone Gummi who had been stuck on a [[deserted island]] for over twelve years. Gruffi helps rescue Gusto, but often finds himself clashing with Gusto, due to the younger Gummi's outside-the-box thinking. At one point, Gruffi accidentally destroys the Great Book of Gummi, forcing him to travel to the abandoned Gummi city of [[Ursalia]] to replace it. Here he meets [[Sir Thornberry]], an older and somewhat eccentric Gummi Knight. Gruffi only finds a bookmark and returns home saddened, but is delighted to see the bookmark magically restore their Great Book.

==Trivia==
*For unknown reasons, while a light brown on the show, Gruffi was regularly depicted as red in color on most of the merchandise available throughout the 1980s. Only later was this mistake corrected, such in the [[Vinylmation]] and [[Funko|Funko POP!]] figure releases of the character.
