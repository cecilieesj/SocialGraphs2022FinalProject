'''Milo Kamilani''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is the laid back and philosophical best friend of [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] and [[Nicky Little]] and attends [[Hazelnut Middle School]] with them.

==Background==
Milo Kamalani is a boy of Hawaiian descent (specifically from the KƒÅnaka Maoli) who lives with his divorced mom, Kona, and his step-father Dirk in Hazelnut. He is an excellent artist, having designed the school year book cover. But Milo can do more than just art, he is the preacher for [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]], before she does something she will regret. She rarely listens to his advice, but it does not discourage him from trying.

Throughout the series, Milo's hobbies and interests are challenged by those who do not understand him, or from those who want to exploit him. He typically remains calm and level headed in these situations, but every now and then his patience will put to the limit. Sometimes he displays a form of ignorance that usually results in Pepper Ann and [[Nicky Little|Nicky]] having to sort him out and make sure that he can be "presentable" to others. However by the end of the episode, he reverts back to his old ways with everyone having a better appreciation of him.

Milo retains a form of independence that perplexes those around him. A running gag is his peculiar relationship with [[Gwen Mezzrow]] which ranges from being an on-and-off relationship to a very surreal one. He also had a tendency to get himself involved in situations that while average for an adult are perplexing for a middle schooler. Milo has gained recognition from otherwise elitest groups who are genuinely amazed with his artistic talents. However, he would rather spend time with his friends Pepper Ann and Nicky.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Milo grows up to become a successful artist and marries a woman named Bettina. Together, they have an infant daughter named Zoe. It is implied that unlike Pepper Ann and Nicky, his life is ironically more held together and complacent than theirs.

===Personality===
Milo is a very lax, almost stoner-like, individual who is always "going with the flow" and making astute observations. He is more likely to maintain a very calm and nonchalant attitude towards situations and tries to be helpful and sincere to those around him. Because his two best friends are both girls, he is something of a feminist and is more in tune with how girls think unlike his other masculine peers. While usually down-to-earth, there are times where he does display some jealousy or anger towards someone who does not sit well with his mindset. Being an artist, he takes his work seriously and will become disturbed whenever someone jeopardizes his artistic vision. Nevertheless, he is a very reliable person and very open-minded.

===Physical appearance===
Milo is a tall and slender Hawaiian boy with brown skin and long blue hair. He has defined eyes with one slightly bigger than the other. He wears a yellow and orange split shirt with a green button up on the collar, greyish-blue shorts and green shoes with white socks. His most identifiable trademark is a purple beanie with a green, yellow and orange rim around it.

==Trivia==
*Milo's hair is "acknowledged" as being blue, but in "[[Live and Let Dye]]", he admits that his hair is actually black.
*The origin of Milo's hat keeps changing throughout the series:
**In "[[Crunch Pod]]", he says he found it in the garbage.
**In "[[Impractical Jokes]]", he is shown to have had it since he was a baby.
**In "[[The Sellout]]", he got his hat from Pepper Ann and Nicky as a present.
**In "[[The Way They Were]]", the hat was owned by Nicky who then gave it to Milo.
*In "[[Quiz Bowl]]", Milo claims that he forgot his name and just started going by Milo.
