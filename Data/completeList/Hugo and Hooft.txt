They are deserters of the French Foreign Legion, these Americans now work for [[Renard Dumont]], though they still have the occasional run-in with [[Lieutenant Colonel Staquait|Lt. Colonel Staquait]] (their former superior), who considers their insubordination (refusal to raze a village of women and children) a capital offense. They also seem to owe money to Joey the Shark, a loan shark in Chicago, which is probably why they joined the Legion in the first place. Although they are smooth-talking, funny conmen who try to cheat people out of money, they are still good-natured and willing to do anything for their friends. A good example is when they are arrested and sent to prison. When Tarzan helps them escape, they have the chance to flee, but instead return to save him from being hanged.
