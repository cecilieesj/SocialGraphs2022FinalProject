'''Mosquito "Skeeter" Valentine'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398856/</ref> is the deuteragonist from the animated series ''[[Disney's Doug|Doug]]''. Skeeter is [[Doug Funnie|Doug]]'s lanky best friend. He is famous in both series for the honking sounds he frequently makes. Skeeter's family has lived in Bluffington for some time. Skeeter initially helps Doug order food from the popular Bluffington restaurant Honker Burger (sold and converted into a French restaurant in the second series) in the series premiere (resulting in their friendship), and later helps Doug learn how to dance. He had dated [[Beebe Bluff]], [[Muffy Silverson]], and Loretta. Skeeter also seems to be more down to earth and has more common sense than Doug or any of the other characters and is usually the voice of reason. He has a superhero alter-ego, whom he calls "The Silver Skeeter". Skeeter's voice and noises are provided by [[Fred Newman]] of ''Between the Lions''.

==Appearance==
Skeeter is blue-skinned and has a few hairs on his scalp. In Nickelodeon's ''Doug'', he wore a T-shirt with a lightning bolt and yellow shorts with red spots. In ''Disney's Doug'', he wore a purple open vest, a long sleeve shirt with a yellow zero, and the same shorts and red sneakers.

==Trivia==
* In "Oh Baby", ''Doug Live!'', and ''[[Doug's 1st Movie]]'' (as well as the original series episode "Doug's Worst Nightmare"), the characters refer to him being blue. He is also the only character to be referred to being technicolored.
