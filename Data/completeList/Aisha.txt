Aisha is a [[Djinn]], originating from the [[Noor Dimension]]. She, [[Najma]], [[Fariha]], [[Aadam]], and [[Saleem]], were collectively known as the [[Clandestines]]. Unknown circumstances lead to their exile. On Earth, they were left in a weakened state, and unable to access Noor to its full extent.

Aisha and the other Clandestines learn from a man in a temple, that they need to find two bangles, which will allow them to return back to their home dimension.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Photography - Cave Ruins.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
In British Occupied India, 1942, the group come across one of the [[bangle|bangles]] they have been searching for, and Aisha takes it off a severed blue arm, beneath the rubble. The British soldiers discover where the group are and try to destroy the cave from within. Fariha and Saleem go to check on Aadam, while Najma remains with Aisha. Najma warns that they don’t know what one bangle will do, but Aisha is determined to use it, if there's even a chance it can help them return home. The cave begins to fall before them, and Aisha places the bangle on her arm. The bangle begins to glow, and a burst of purple light, occupies her eyes. Aisha asks Najma is she saw what she did, but has no time to further elaborate, as the temple is begins to collapse. Najma is determined the British don’t get hold of it and tells Aisha to leave through another exit, while she gives her time to escape. The pair hug and depart ways.

Aisha flees the cave and runs from a British Soldier in pursuit of her. She stops to throw a knife and strikes him in the chest before moving away to a nearby village. She walks through, and comes across a [[Hasan|man]] protesting in regards to the British’s occupancy over India.

She continues exploring the village, before settling in a rose garden, where she falls asleep. She wakes up to the man who was protesting, poke her with his stick. She grabs hold of it and threatens to break his leg if he touches her. The man laughs and points to his leg, which is already injured. She asks what he wants, and he requests she not trample on his roses. He offers his help, but Aisha declines. Before he leaves, he informs her that he has food and a place to rest in his cottage, should she change her mind.

The evening arrives, and Aisha heads to the man’s home. He draws out a plate of food for her and she begins to eat, while staying silent. He asks for her name, and where she came from, but Aisha ignores him and continues to eat. He asks what brought her to their village, and Aisha gives admiration for his roses. He shares that upon seeing her, he thought of his favorite poem, which he recites, "When the soul lies down in that grass; The world is too full to talk about; What you seek is seeking you...". Aisha gives him her name, and Hasan translates it’s meaning as “She who lives”, and compliments it for it’s beauty. He introduces himself as Hasan, and the pair continues talking.

Time eventually passes, and the pair fall in love. Aisha and Hasan get married, and she falls pregnant with his child.
One day, while Hasan is tending to his roses, she walks over towards him to exchange his wooden branch for an actual walking stick. Hasan comments on the irony in how she threatened to break his leg when they first met, and Aisha replies that she changed her mind. The pair chuckle and she thanks him for making a home for her.

She eventually gives birth to a daughter, and the pair name her [[Sana Ali|Sana]]. Aisha begins selling milk to support her family, while Hasan continues to tend to his garden.

While singing to her daughter, Hasan comments that Sana looks at Aisha, as though she was magic, a sentiment he repeats over the years.

A few more years pass and religious unrest continues sweeping across the nation. Uncertainty and fear have spread across the country and turned to bloodshed. Aisha and her family begin facing discrimination, and their family’s businesses are boycotted.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x05 - Time and Again - Rohan.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
One night, [[Rohan]] arrives with an offering of milk and vegetables for their family. Aisha thanks him, but Rohan tells her there’s no need. Hasan snaps, and asks Rohan keep his charity, and vents his frustration at being forced out of his home for being Muslim. Aisha asks that Rohan forgive Hasan for his temper, and he assures her not to worry as everyone is scared. She closes the door as Rohan leaves, when she spots Najma outside of their home.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x05 - Time and Again - Aisha Holds Lantern.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Aisha later excuses herself to meet with Najma. Her old friend gives her a hug and Aisha shares that she thought the Clandestines were all dead. Najma is ready to resume their plans in returning to the Noor Dimension, and questions if Aisha still shares their objectives. Aisha hesitantly replies she does, but lies to Najma and tells her that she hid the bangle for safekeeping and it’ll take time to retrieve it. Najma gives her until sundown tomorrow, and the pair depart ways.

Aisha returns home and begins packing her belongings. She warns Hasan of the dangers they face, with the riots and violence spreading against the Muslims living in the countryside. She assures her husband that they can build a new home, and reminds him of the last line in the poem he taught her. “What you seek, is seeking you”. Aisha turns to her daughter, and hands her the bangle, which she promises will keep her safe.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x05 - Time and Again - Photography - Aisha and Hasan.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
The family migrate, but Hasan struggles to keep up in their journey. He demands to know what they’re running from and questions who the woman is that she was talking with last night. Aisha sits her husband down. She shows him the bangle and recalls how he often referred to her as magical. The bangle extends, and an inscription materializes, before their eyes. The bangle begins to glow, before returning back to its original state. Hasan questions why Aisha is revealing this to him, and she shares that he never pushed after learning she was running from something, but Hasan tells her he never cared and she chose them. Aisha reassures Hasan she is still choosing him, and makes Hasan promise that Sana get aboard the train.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x05 - Time and Again - Najma Leaves Sana.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The family make their way to a carriage, but when Aisha turns around, she spots Najma following her. She hands Sana to Hasan, and asks he fulfill his promise, while she turns back, as he calls out for her. Najma walks towards Aisha, angered by her betrayal, and demands to know where the bangle. Aisha refuses to answer, and Najma stabs her former friend, vowing to find it, if it’s the last thing she’ll do. An injured warns Najma it won’t work, while Najma walks away from her.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x05 - Time and Again - Aisha Dies.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Fatally wounded, Aisha stumbles onto the side. She takes out a photograph of herself with her family, and repeats the last line of the poem Hasan taught her, “What you seek, is seeking you”, invoking the power of the bangle. As she falls down, a [[Ms. Marvel|young girl ]] comes to her side, holding some form of awareness in her identity. The young girl wields the bangle, and Aisha mistakenly believes her to be Sana, but she clarifies she isn’t. She asks that the girl get Sana on the train and protect the bangle, before handing her a photograph of her family. The young girl gets emotional, insisting she has to save Sana by referring to her as “Nani”, and Aisha comes to realize the girl standing before her, is her great-granddaughter. Aisha plants her hand on the girls face, and comes to peace with her fate, as she succumbs to her injuries and dies.

After her disappearance, various rumors surrounded Aisha, which included being cursed, her infidelity, having a secret family and murdering someone during the Partition. Her story becomes of legend, with the Order of the [[Order of the Red Daggers|Red Daggers]], who are aware of her true nature, and the power of the bangle she possessed.
