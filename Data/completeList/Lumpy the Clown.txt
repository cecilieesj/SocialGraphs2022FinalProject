'''Lumpy the Clown''' is the secondary character of ''[[Red's Dream]]''. He is a clown who is seen in [[Red (Red's Dream)|Red]] the unicycle's dream of being in a circus. In the dream, he sits on Red and juggles blue, green, and red balls until Red took over and juggled them himself.
==Trivia==
*Lumpy the Clown is [[Pixar]]'s first organic character and first human; however, he is not the first human to be seen in a Pixar feature-length film. This title is held by [[Andy Davis]].
*Lumpy appears in a cameo in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' on the TV screen.
**In this cameo, he holds a ball in his right hand, but the lights over his right eye make it seem that he is showing the middle finger, giving him a scary or evil look. Some sites say it is a subliminal message. It is completely different from the Pixar standard of quality, especially because the character himself has a mission to be funny, not scary.
*A picture of Lumpy's face appeared on the back of a truck at the carnival in ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.
