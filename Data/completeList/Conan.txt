He is accidentally presented to [[Merida]] in the place of [[Wee Dingwall]] by [[Lord Dingwall]], initially making everyone think that he was Lord Dingwall's son. According to director [[Mark Andrews]], the gag is his favourite in the film. As the Clans are leaving [[DunBroch]], he is seen flirting with [[Maudie]].

==Trivia==
*Conan is not named during the film, but the name Conan was used in development, according to [[Mark Andrews]].
*Conan wears a small kilt, rather than the great kilts worn by everyone else in the film.
*As the three clans are fighting and arrows are fired at Clan Dingwall, while the rest of the clan ducks out of the way, he simply catches one.
