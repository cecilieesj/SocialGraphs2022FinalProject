'''Cagney''' is [[Elisa Maza]]'s pet cat in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated television show, ''[[Gargoyles]]''.

==History==
[[Greg Weisman]] has said that Cagney wasn't adopted at a shelter by [[Elisa Maza|Elisa]], but rather Cagney adopted Elisa, hinting that Cagney may have been a stray cat. In late [[1996]], Cagney was about three years old.

Cagney is, fortunately, good at looking after himself when Elisa is absent. When Elisa disappeared during the Avalon World Tour, [[Brooklyn]], [[Broadway]], [[Lexington]], and [[Hudson]] took Cagney back to the clock tower, where he and Hudson developed a friendship. <ref>''[[Kingdom (Gargoyles)|Kingdom]]''</ref> Cagney approved of Jason Conover when he briefly stopped by at Elisa's apartment. <ref>''[[Hunter's Moon]]'', Part Two</ref>
