At work, Shakat measures out a dress for [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]], who is out shopping with her mother, for [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]]'s upcoming wedding. She tries it on, but he points out that she's too short. [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] insists that rather, the dress is too large. While taking measurements of Kamala, [[Auntie Ruby|Ruby]] enters the store, and asks whether her order is ready. She and Muneeba meet, and begin gossiping about Fatima, a mutual acquaintance of theirs, who broke off her engagement, and began traveling Europe. Kamala chimes in, in the middle of their conversation, praising her, for following her dream, to the disapproving look of her Muneeba and Ruby. Shakat chuckles at her comment, remaking that she's troublesome, which the ladies agree with.
