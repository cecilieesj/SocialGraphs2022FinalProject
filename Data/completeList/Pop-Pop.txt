'''Pop-Pop'''<ref>[https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/718675586080645121 Jared Bush via Twitter], April 9th, 2016</ref>  (possibly named '''Otto Hopps'''<ref>[https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zootopia/images/b/b3/Ottonewspaper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160507181816 Name seen on newspaper]</ref>) is a character featured in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Zootopia]]''.

==Background==

===Development===
When [[Jared Bush]], one of the writers for ''Zootopia'', was asked if Pop-Pop was [[Bonnie and Stu Hopps|Bonnie]]'s father, he replied that the production crew went "back and forth on that". However, a newspaper article depicting a picture of Pop-Pop confirms that he is Bonnie's father.

A deleted scene showed a storyboard of [[Judy Hopps]] who called her parents after her first day she received a call of foxes being a threat to rabbits which Judy then replied, "That's offensive, Grandpa""''<ref>[http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2015/12/03/zootopia-co-director-jared-bush-writer-phil-johnston-talk-perfecting-script 'Zootopia' Co-Director Jared Bush and Writer Phil Johnston Talk Perfecting Script Over and Over Again] at ''Geeks of Doom'', December 3rd, 2015</ref>.

Despite his role being cut for the final version of the film, Pop-Pop does make a brief cameo at the beginning of the film where he is seen amongst the many residents of [[Bunnyburrow]] bidding a farewell to [[Judy Hopps]] who is planning to leave for [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] to be a police officer.

==Appearances==

===''[[Zootopia]]''===
Despite having his major role being cut from the final version of the film, Pop-Pop does make a cameo during the beginning of the film seen amongst the many rabbits bidding [[Judy Hopps]] a farewell to her parents [[Bonnie and Stu Hopps]] who wish their daughter a good luck in doing her first job in being a rabbit officer just before she moves to [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]].

The only time Pop-Pop was given a speaking role in the film is where he mispronounces Judy's name as Trudy and tells his daughter Bonnie to know if she has been eaten, which Bonnie tells her father that no one was eaten. Pop-Pop also interprets foxes as an evil threat to the rabbits judging them by their red color, which Judy thinks saying that to a fox like [[Nick Wilde]] is offensive.

===''[[Zootopia+]]''===
In "[[Hopp on Board]]", Pop-Pop is seen amongst the other rabbits bidding Judy a farewell when she plans to return to Zootopia. However, when Bonnie and Stu see their daughter [[Molly Hopps|Molly]] on the train leading to Zootopia, Bonnie tells her father Pop-Pop to take his children home, which Pop-Pop replies to his daughter that he is too old to be changing diapers. Not counting the deleted scenes from the original ''Zootopia'' film, this is the first time Pop-Pop has spoken in any official finalized product material.

==Trivia==
*Pop-Pop has a striking resemblance to [[Carl Fredricksen]] from the [[2009]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Up]]''.
