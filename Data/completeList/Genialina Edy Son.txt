|alignment = Good}}'''Genialina Edy Son''' is a character created by Guido Martina and [[Giorgio Cavazzano]], who made her first appearance in the Italian Donald Duck comic ''Super Daisy and Ariadne's Thread''.

Some time ago, Genialina was [[Gyro Gearloose]]'s pupil, and just like her teacher, who provides weapons and gadgets to [[the Duck Avenger]], she helps [[Super Daisy]] in her missions. She currently owns a fashion boutique and is president of [[Duckburg]]'s feminists club, and dedicates to mechanics as a hobby in her free time.

==Trivia==
* Unlike other Disney characters, Genialina doesn't have a fixed clothing style, but instead it varies from story to story.
