===''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''===
Not much about Susan's past has been shown thus far, except that she got trapped in the Baxter Building when it was sent to space by the dastardly [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]]. At some unknown point, Sue was replaced by a [[Skrull]] imposter. She was constantly sedated by her Skrull captors to stop her from using her powers. When [[Captain America]] assembled the other prisoners to get their freedom and return to Earth, refused to leave the weakened Sue despite Viper telling she would be a load.

She somehow saved her teammates and the whole Baxter Building from her doppelganger. Some time later, she was part of the Avengers' expanded team against [[Galactus]].

===''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''===
Sue Storm was captured along the other Fantastic Four members by The Collector. Later on she along with the rest of the Fantastic Four teamed up with the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. to stop the Tribbitites invasion.
