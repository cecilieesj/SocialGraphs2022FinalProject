'''June''' is the deuteragonist of ''[[Little Einsteins]]''. She is 6 years old, making her the oldest member (along with Leo) of the team. She is also the team's talented dancer.

==Background==
===Personality===
June is a brave (though she can easily be frightened), kind, intelligent, and respectable girl. Ballet dancing is her favorite thing to do. She knows a lot of big words and teaches her team and the audience how to dance.

=== Appearance ===
June has pale skin, short dark brown hair, and brown eyes. She wears a pink headband, a purple dress with a pink belt, light blue pearl earrings, and red ballet slippers over white socks (as seen in "[[Show and Tell]]", which shows her without slippers).

===Friends===
Her friends are [[Leo (Little Einsteins)|Leo]], [[Quincy]], [[Annie (Little Einsteins)|Annie]], and [[Rocket (Little Einsteins)|Rocket]]. She also has other friends, but they are not human for example, one of her friends is a duckling, another is a little dragon kite.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
June made an appearance as a puppet in [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]], like the rest of her team, and at the [[Animation Courtyard]] in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]. She also appears as a walk-around costume for meets and greets, just like the other Little Einsteins, except Rocket.

==Trivia==

*She is named after famous choreographer June Taylor.
*Her name was given after the sixth month in the Gregorian calendar.
*She is Asian-American
*She is the only ''Little Einsteins'' character who wears jewelry, which are her earrings.
*She wears the exact same purple tutu dress every day, except for the [[A Little Einsteins Halloween|Halloween episode]] where it changes to black as part of her costume, and in "[[The Glass Slipper Ball]]" when she wore a fancy ribbon dress for the ball.
*She has a class where [[The Blue-Footed Booby Bird Ballet|she teaches blue-footed booby birds to do ballet]].
*In the episode "[[Show and Tell]]", she wears socks with her ballet shoes.
*In the episode "[[The Christmas Wish]]", June wished for a new pair of ballet boots.
*She loves space as much as dancing.
*Her favorite ballet move is a leap.
*In "[[I Love to Conduct]]", she leaped across the water on the backs of whales.
*She can hear the music in the background, just like the other Little Einsteins.
*In "[[Rocket's Firebird Rescue]]", June was given Dancing Power and may have it permanently.
*In "[[A Galactic Goodnight]]", she performs her Sleepy Spin dance every night before she goes to bed.
