|quote = }}'''Squire Cawker''' is a predatorial crow who serves as the main antagonist of the [[1932]] [[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]], [[Bugs in Love|''Bugs in Love'']]. In the short, he arrives in Bugville and attempts to eat [[Bucky Bug|Bucky]] and June Bug. After trapping Bucky in a bottle, he chases June around her own home, trampling most of her furniture in the process. June shuts herself in a makeup case as Bucky frees himself. Cawker eventually grabs June but Bucky takes a clock hand and strikes the bird multiple times. A local bug witnesses this and sounds a clock alarm to sound a militia armed with thrown-away objetcs. Cawker traps Bucky in a dropper when the soldiers arrive. The bugs attack him with such objects as a mousetrap and an eggbeater before finally trapping him in a shoe and forcefully feeding him castor oil. June releases Bucky and they share a passionate embrace. Squire Cawker dons a crooked top hat similar to that of the [[Big Bad Wolf]] and a vest like the one [[Goofy]] wears in his classic design.

==Trivia==
*The design of Squire Cawker could have served as the inspiration for [[The Crows|the crows]] from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''.
