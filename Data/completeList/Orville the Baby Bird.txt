'''Orville''' is a small, red bird, who is taught to fly by [[Pluto]]. He made only one animated appearance in the [[1948]] animated short ''[[Pluto's Fledgling]]''.

==Role in the Short==
Orville, a baby bird, is left by his mother his siblings, whom already are trying to forget him. Upon wishing to fly like his family, Orville gets up on the nest and jumps up and down. He jumps out of his nest, desperately trying to fly, but fails, then ends up landing in Pluto's water dish, causing Pluto to wake up and see Orville drowning. Pluto rescues Orville, places him between his mouth and tongue, and returns him to his nest, but puts him into his bed, much to Orville's anger, and falls in a funny way until he reaches his dog house.

Later, however, little Orville pushes the twigs out of his nest, jumps out of his nest, and tries to fly again, but fails by falling down once more, and lands on Pluto's nose this time, causing the dog to wake up and bark, only to eat him. In a very quick defensive reaction, Pluto doesn't realize that in the next moment little Orville is in his mouth. After that when Orville gets out of Pluto's mouth and lands on his muzzle, he backs up for a bit, only to get his foot caught on Pluto, and gets it out again. Little Orville charges toward the edge, then tries to fly, and ends up falling down, only managing to save himself grabbing onto Pluto's nose. When Pluto sees that Orville can't fly, he feels guilty to what he did to hurt tiny Orville's feelings. Pluto then teaches Orville how to fly; which is successfully made in the end.
