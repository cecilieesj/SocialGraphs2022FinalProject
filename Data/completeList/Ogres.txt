The''' Ogres''' are [[Duke Igthorn]]'s minions and the tertiary antagonists in ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
These Ogres act as Igthorn's half-witted footsoldiers. Compared to [[Toadwart]], the smallest of all the Ogres, they are not very intelligent, resorting to brute force under their leader, Igthorn. However, their size and strength are a formidable problem for the [[Gummi Bears]], who often choose to escape the Ogres or outwit them rather than fight them directly.

The Ogres appear native to [[Drekmore Castle|Drekmore]], and vary in color; they are either green, yellow, orange, or purple.

Only two of the large Ogres are ever directly addressed by name: Gad and Zook. In most (but not all) episode appearances, Gad is a purple ogre wearing a metal helmet, and Zook is a green ogre with orange hair.

Another small ogre, Toadie's cousin [[Tadpole]], makes a one-time appearance.

==Role in the [[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|show]]==
The Ogres appear multiple times in most of the episodes. They were often depicted as extremely stupid, brutish and crude with a tendency to anger their master with their inability to carry out his orders. As a result, they were often bullied and mistreated by Igthorn when they stepped out of line or messed up his plans.

However, these Ogres were certainly not without threat, being large and strong with a tendency to carry large clubs. They would no doubt cause great trouble if left to their own devices, yet due to their large size and small brains, they were not a match for the more agile and generally more intelligent Gummi Bears. Though they attempt to please their master, the Gummi Bears would often foil their plans of conquest or misdeeds. As mentioned above, these Ogres are rarely ever physically fought by the Gummi Bears due to their muscular build and size.
