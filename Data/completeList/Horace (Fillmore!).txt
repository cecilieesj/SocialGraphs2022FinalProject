'''Horace'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0365383/?ref_=tt_cl_t11</ref> is a ''[[Fillmore!]]'' character, an X Middle School student, and a computer geek. He is voiced by Samm Levine<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Fillmore/Horace/</ref><ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505949/?ref_=tt_cl_t11</ref>.

==A Dark Score Evened==
Horace appears in the Safety Patrol Headquarters attempting to fix [[Danny O'Farrell|O'Farrell]]'s computer before fixing the other Safety Patrollers' computers. <ref>[[A Dark Score Evened]]</ref> He asks who'd been subscribing to a site called The Daily Knock-Knock Joke and O'Farrell admits it by raising his hand. Horace then tells his own knock-knock joke directed towards O'Farrell, implying that O'Farrell is the one responsible for downloading four viruses onto the network in the process, and making him feel bad. [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] asks Horace if he is there to insult them or if he is there to make repairs. Horace answers "both" and told them he'll be back with all that are needed to make the repairs on his own terms. Horace tends to be a bully by hurting others verbally rather than physically.

Horace is seen again, this time fixing [[Stella Valenzia|Stella]]'s computer while Stella is being interrogated by Fillmore and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]]. He tells her that the computer's modem is overloaded and that he is confiscating it. Stella tells him that she needs the modem to contact more, fellow students and send more E-mails about a rally to save doodlebugs. Horace implies simply she'd have to do it the old-fashioned way: Via regular mail.

As Fillmore, Ingrid, and [[Horatio Vallejo|Vallejo]] are trying to come to the conclusion of who the suspect being the bully paybacks is, Horace informs them about a computer system he has that can pinpoint who it is. Fillmore and Ingrid have him show them and the three head to the Converted Center Control Room. After using the system's security camera to search for the suspect, it almost instantly zooms in on Stella. After Fillmore and Ingrid approach Stella about it, she takes off and the Safety Patrollers follow. When they catch up to her and end up back in the control room, they find Horace being held hostage by Stella, [[Becca Baccadero|Becca]], [[Wilbur]], and [[Grover Brady|Grover]]. This is in retribution for how he bullied them. Horace tells them he is not a bully, that he is just a computer geek. Becca tells him he may never have bullied anyone physically, but he puts down others and that still makes him just as much of one, albeit differently. Just as Wilbur prepares to destroy the computer's control panel by pouring gumbo onto it, Fillmore gets them to put a stop to the foursome's plan. He tells them that isn't the only means of lessening the difficulty with bullies and that punishing Horace isn't proper. He told them that wasn't the only means and that they were better than that. Once Fillmore reasoned with them, they seem to get the message and leave Horace and the control panel alone. Horace likely reforms after this.
