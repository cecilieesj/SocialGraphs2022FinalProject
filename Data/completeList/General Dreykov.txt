'''General Dreykov''' is the main antagonist in the [[2021]] [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]''. He is the father of [[Taskmaster|Antonia Dreykov]] and the head of the Red Room, an Soviet organization that trained young girls to become ruthless assassins.

==Background==
As a high-ranking Soviet Armed Forces officer, Dreykov was put in charge of the Red Room, a top-secret Soviet training program that turned young women into the world's deadliest spies.

At one point, Dreykov discovered a young Russian girl named [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff]] and decided to take and train her to become a deadly spy. When Romanoff's family objected to this, Dreykov abducted the young girl through force and had her enlisted into his Red Room program. However, Romanoff's mother immediately opposed Dreykov and began searching for her daughter, in the hopes to get her daughter back. Noticing the woman's persistence and fearful of the Red Room's existence being exposed, Dreykov ordered Romanoff's mother to be assassinated. Dreykov subsequently had her body buried in an unmarked grave, as to keep her true identity from ever being revealed while continuing to train her daughter to be an assassin.

===Personality===
Dreykov was a fierce and calculating individual while possessing a strong cunning streak and high level of intelligence. He was also abusive, ruthless, controlling and brutal, and lacked almost any form of empathy for the livelihoods of the girls he trafficked in and subjects to the treatments in the Red Room. A misogynist to the core, Dreykov saw girls as merely weapons to be used and thrown away when it suited his agenda of world domination rather than as individuals.

Dreykov was also apathic even towards his own allies including [[Red Guardian|Alexei Shostakov]], who he had sent to prison for reasons his former friend was unaware. Dreykov's apathy also extended towards his own daughter, Antonia, who he repurposed to be his "greatest weapon" following the assassination attempt on his own life, showing a complete disregard for her care and well-being.

==Appearances==
===''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]''===
In 1995, Dreykov first appears in Cuba to greet his friend, [[Red Guardian|Alexei Shostakov]] in Cuba after he had completed his mission in destroying the North Institute in [[Ohio]] while staying with his undercover family, consisting of [[Melina Vostokoff]], [[Yelena Belova]], and [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff]]. As Dreykov's soldiers proceeded to escort Yelena and Natasha to his Red Room academy, Natasha fought back and stole a gun in an attempt to protect Yelena. After Shostakov managed to calm Natasha down, she and Yelena were sedated and taken to the Red Room, with Dreykov being impressed with Natasha and taking an interest in her.

==Trivia==
*Dreykov has no comic book counterpart, making him the first MCU villain to be an original character.
**Also, Dreykov is meant to serve as a singular amalgamated villain to all of various named Russian agents from the comics such as Alex Sterelny, Grigor Pchellintstov, and Ivan Petrovich.
