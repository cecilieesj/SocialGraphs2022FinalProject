==Role in [[102 Dalmatians|the film]]==
Chomp is first seen at the animal shelter with [[Drooler]], [[Digger (102 Dalmatians)|Digger]], and [[Waddlesworth]]. As [[Kevin Shepherd|Kevin]] is introducing the dogs of Second Chance to [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]], he claims Chomp chewed his way through three postmen before Kevin found him and thanks to Second Chance, wouldn't hurt a flea. He joins ''The Gang ''as they help rescue the puppies from [[Cruella De Vil]]. When they arrive in Paris, Chomp is able to communicate with the Paris dogs, implying that he is able to speak [[France|French]], to Kevin's surprise. When Cruella's henchman [[Jean Pierre Le Pelt]] gets his leg stuck in a hole, Chomp bites it.

==Trivia==
*Chomp was created solely for ''102 Dalmatians'' and has no animated counterpart.
