{{Quote|You're dead meat.|Gary taunting Jess Aarons}}
'''Gary Fulcher''' is the main antagonist in ''[[Bridge to Terabithia]]''. He is a fifth grader who often bullies [[Jess Aarons]] at school.

==Role in the film==
Gary sits next to Jess in the classroom and often tells him ominously that he is "dead meat". He doesn't care about [[Leslie Burke]] at all.

Gary and his sidekick, [[Scott Hauger]], are later waiting for Jess and Leslie in front of the school to bully them, but have no chance to, as they enter alongside their music teacher, [[Miss Edmunds]].

When Leslie tragically dies, Gary and Scott are overjoyed, and don't show sympathy to Jess, but up the ante on their bullying, going as far as to taunt him about it. He quickly retaliates and punches Scott across the room. However, Gary, being bigger than Scott, is later beaten up by [[Janice Avery]], who was sympathetic for Jess after Leslie befriended her. She gives him a nosebleed in return.
