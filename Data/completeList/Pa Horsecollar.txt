==History==
Horace often goes to him for advice, especially when Horace has been bickering with [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] again. Pa tells his son that he should stand up up for himself, but, although he can be boastful and have a big mouth, Pa is often quite easily intimidated himself and tries to avoid conflict, and, as such, he is usually "all talk and no action". He enjoys watching boxing matches on TV.
