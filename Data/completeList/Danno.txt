'''Danno''' is a character featured in the extinct [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]]".

==History==

===Background===
Danno serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the former Japan-exclusive incarnation  of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, he and the other emcee birds create a plan to wake up the Tikis by playing various songs to wake up. After some failed attempts, they finally wake up after Lava performs the musical number "Fever" with the [[Tiki Totem Poles]] to which the [[Tiki Room Drummers|Tiki Drummers]] suddenly start being active. After this, he and the other emcee birds celebrate together just before guests leave the attraction.

===Development History===
The Tiki Room attraction at Tokyo Disneyland originally opened as a Japanese version of the original show featuring the original emcee birds [[Jos√©]], [[Michael]], [[Pierre]], and [[Fritz]]. The attraction closed in Tokyo in [[1999]] and was rethemed as "Get the Fever!"  which opened in that same year where the four original emcee birds were removed and were replaced by Danno, Lava, Scats, and Buddy with the attraction having a different storyline compared to the original incarnation.

"Get the Fever!" closed in early [[2008]] and was later reopened as "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]" where the hosts from the "Get the Fever!" incarnation were replaced by four new emcee bird hosts: Manu, Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli.

==Role in the attraction==
During the show, Danno is introduced by the announcer during intro number "[[The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room]]" alongside Lava, Scats, and Buddy to which after singing to the guests that the Tiki Room is having a long slumber where he and the other emcee bird hosts encourage the guests to clap along to wake up the Tikis while Buddy and Scats sing along. However, when Lava begins the musical number "[[Hot, Hot, Hot]]", Danno and the other emcee birds participate with the [[Showgirl Birds]] where they all sing together. Despite this, the attempt to wake up the Tikis was unsuccessful.

Losing hope that the Tikis would never wake up, Lava then tells the other emcee birds about her plan to wake up the Tikis in which the Totem Poles from the attraction join in with her singing and while singing, the plan to wake them up was successful. After the plan to wake up the Tikis was successful, Danno and the other birds celebrate with the other Tiki Room birds with a special rendition of "[[I Wan'na Be Like You]]" just before he and the other emcee birds bid a farewell to the guests.
