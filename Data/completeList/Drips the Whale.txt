'''Drips the Whale''' is a character who appears in the [[2012]] [[Pixar]] animated short, ''[[Partysaurus Rex]].

==Background==
Drips is a light blue whale toy who holds the entire tub spout. Whenever Rex turns on the water depending on which faucet is used, Drips reacts to Rex helping the bathtub toys float with the use of water being flowed by the spouter to begin their party. If the lever on the top of Drips' spouter is pulled, it stops the water from flowing.

==Role in the short==
As [[Rex]] finds himself at [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]'s bathtub seeing the bathtub toys being unable to move without water, Drips tells the other toys that they can party all the time if they can turn on the water themselves. Rex plans to help give the water to the bathtub toys to float on to which he turns on the cold water to cause the water to come out of the spout, which Drips reacts in excitement.

The bathtub toys cheer for Rex for having a great plan by filling the tub with water and later when the bathtub toys dance together, Drips dances with the other toys and soon as the toys face an overflow drain where the water coming out of the spout Drips is entering a drain. Rex then tosses a frog sponge onto the drain while Drips continues celebrating with the other toys, causing the bathtub to be overfilled with water, much to Rex's worry that it can cause an overlow. Rex tries to turn off the cold water, but the faucet suddenly falls instead and soon as Rex turns off the spouter with Drips on it, the other bathtub toys react in worry to stop the water from overflowing. However, the party resumes when the shower's faucet turns on to fill the tub with more water, resulting in the tub to overflow. Drips makes no further appearances after that.
