{{Quote|That's Anger. He cares very deeply about things being fair.|[[Joy]], opening narration}}
'''Anger''' is a major character in the [[2015]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Inside Out]]''. He is one of the five emotions inside the mind of [[Riley Andersen]] that makes Riley feel angry whenever she needs to.

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Anger feels very passionately about making sure things are fair for Riley. He has a fiery spirit and tends to explode (literally) when things don't go as planned. He is quick to overreact and has little patience for life's imperfections.''

===Physical appearance===
Anger is brick-shaped and is the shortest Emotion. He has red skin that matches with his eye color. He wears a white collar shirt with rolled up sleeves and a red-and-gray necktie with a zig-zagged pattern, dark burgundy slacks with a brown belt, and black dress shoes. His head goes into flames when provoked. He is the only emotion to not have any hair.

==Appearances==
===''[[Inside Out]]''===
Anger is one of the five emotions controlling Riley Andersen's mind and the fifth and last one to be introduced. He lives in her brain and works with other emotions. When [[Joy]] and [[Sadness]] literally get lost in Riley's mind, he and the others have to keep Riley's head on straight before they get home. Next to Joy, he may be the most abrasive to Sadness.

Anger is introduced when [[Mr. Andersen]] tells a young Riley that she can't have dessert if she doesn't eat her broccoli. He is enraged but calms down when Riley's father says that the broccoli is an airplane.

When Riley and her family move to San Francisco, Anger, along with the other emotions, is disappointed when he sees their new home and creates some negative memories. He lightens up when Joy starts coming up with ideas on how to decorate the place but is infuriated when they find out that the moving van with all of their belongings hasn't arrived yet.

When Riley's father leaves for work, Joy suggests that they get pizza. Upon realizing that there's broccoli on the pizza, Anger has a little outburst and claims that San Francisco has ruined pizza, much like the Hawaiians. When Sadness starts touching the memories, Anger is worried.

On Riley's first day at her new school, Anger is mistrustful (as always). Things seem to be going well before Sadness touches a memory once again, much to Anger's annoyance. The emotions start to panic and Anger attempts to help Joy get rid of the sad memory, but to no avail. Unfortunately, Sadness and Joy get drained away along with the core memories and Anger asks if he's allowed to say ''"that curse word"'' now.

While Joy and Sadness are on their way back to Headquarters, Anger, [[Fear]], and [[Disgust]] try to fix everything. They try tampering with the core memories and replicating Joy's behavior, but they find themselves unable to make her happy. And to make things worse, they can't seem to get out of the infamously catchy [[Tripledent Gum]] jingle. When Riley discovers that her friend [[Meg (Inside Out)|Meg]] has replaced her on the hockey team, Anger causes her to feel betrayed and stop talking to Meg.

Eventually, Anger gets a self-proclaimed brilliant idea - since Riley's happy core memories were made in Minnesota, Anger suggests that she should run away and return to her old home. Disgust and Fear do not approve of this plan, but Anger does not bend. Fear suggests that Riley should go to sleep, but when she wakes up because of a nightmare, Anger takes subjects into his own hands and goes through with his plan. Fear asks if he's serious about this and he coldly implies that it's the only way to make Riley happy.

They soon catch that Riley simply can't afford to go back to Minnesota, so the scheming Anger makes Riley steal her mother's credit card, leading to the destruction of [[Honesty Island]]. On their way to the bus, Anger realizes that he's destroying Riley's mind and finally snaps out of his determination and exclaims that this is madness. He tries to stop Riley, but she cannot be controlled. The three emotions panic, but Joy and Sadness return to save them. However, a thick window separates them from each other and Anger severely tries to break it using rowdy strength. When this fails, Disgust has an idea and starts insulting his intelligence. Anger gets aggravated and his head goes up in a huge flame which Disgust uses as a blowtorch to help Joy and Sadness climb through the window.

Anger anxiously says everything to Joy, but to everyone's surprise, she simply tells Sadness to take control of Riley. Sadness uses the remaining functional button to let Riley know that she sometimes need sadness to handle with difficult situations. Loaded with this knowledge, Riley runs back to her parents to talk about her issues. Anger is impressed by this and presumably learns to accept Sadness as an important emotion.

As Riley grows up, new core memories and Personality Islands are created (including a section of [[Friendship Island]] called "''The Friendly Argument Section''", which Anger is very happy about) and, with the updated console, Anger now has access to the entire curse word library. Anger joyfully yells: "''This console is the -''" before being interrupted by a loud beeping noise as a result of Fear playing with the new buttons.

During a hockey match, Anger admits that her parents are very cool.

Anger, along with the other emotions, continues to help Riley as she grows up.

===''[[Riley's First Date?]]''===
Anger returns in the short along with the other emotions. He is first seen giving an embarrassed (and generally, annoyed) look with his friends when Mrs. Andersen is using modern-day slang to try to relate to Riley. Later, he demands that she stops talking like that, which becomes his only line in the short.

==Video games==
===''[[Disney Infinity: 3.0 Edition|Disney Infinity 3.0]]''===
Anger appears in ''Disney Infinity''<nowiki/>'s third installment as a playable character. In the ''Inside Out'' playset, he is immune to lava, enabling him to walk across fiery surfaces.

==Disney Parks==
Anger appears as an animatronic in the Inside Out pre-parade at [[Disney's California Adventure]]. The Hot Dog Hut in Paradise Pier (now [[Pixar Pier]]) was retooled as [[Angry Dogs]], featuring Anger.

Anger also appears with the other emotions on [[Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind]].

He made his first live appearance in the new [[Disney on Ice]] show, Follow Your Heart which introduced on September 2, 2016.

==Trivia==
*Despite the fact the film technically has no real antagonists, many fans consider Anger to be the film's antagonist by the results of his actions, due to him causing the islands to break down, making it hard for Joy and Sadness to return to Headquarters, even though it was all unintentional.
*According to [[Pete Docter]], his appearance is based on a [[Wikipedia:Fire brick|fire brick]].
*When Anger gets infuriated enough, flames come out of his head.
*In attempts to serve his purpose Anger caused several issues:
**Riley almost ran away because of his idea to get new core memories.
**With the exception of Goofball, almost all the other Islands of Personality were destroyed because of his actions on the console. This also indirectly led to [[Bing Bong]]'s demise.
**He was most prominent in causing the rift between Riley and her parents.
**When he destroyed Honesty Island, he indirectly impeded Joy and Sadness returning to Headquarters.
*Anger is notably the only Emotion that never has a visible nose.
*Anger claimed that before this pizzeria in [[San Francisco]] served broccoli pizza, the Hawaiians ruined pizza by inventing the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian pizza]], despite it being invented in Canada.
*During a stage where the Emotions all had human names, Anger was originally named Ira, short for Irate, as well as Latin and Italian for ''wrath''.
