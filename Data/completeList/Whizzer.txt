His most commonly given trait is a weak bladder, meaning he will have frequent accidents every so often. He appears in the live-action ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' movie and ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''.

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
[[File:Mooch_TWizzerDipstick_DLDL.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Whizzer with Dipstick in ''101 Dalmatians: The Series'']]
In the TV series, Whizzer's appearance differs from having white ears with two spots on his left ear, a red collar, grey eyelids, and notable bags under his eyes. He is usually seen hanging out with[[ Dipstick]] or [[Mooch (101 Dalmatians)|Mooch]]. Usually, when seen with Mooch, he acts as a posse member, usually laughing about jokes Mooch makes and commenting them to be "good ones."

This doesn't mean he isn't good with other pups, though, as he is seen hanging out with [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]], [[Cadpig]], and [[Rolly]] on some occasions.

His bladder troubles are brought more to light here; various cases would be in "[[Twelve Angry Pups]]" when Mooch mentions Whizzer losing his bladder control, and "[[A Christmas Cruella]]" in which he is picked up by [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] to hug and accidentally pees all over her. In "[[Dalmatian Vacation (episode)|Dalmatian Vacation]]", during the journey, the puppy bus has to stop every couple of feet, because Whizzer is in desperate need to relieve himself. Cruella gets fed up with the time-wasting stops and refuses to let the bus stop again. However, she again made the bus stop after Whizzer relieved himself in Cruella's shoes.

As the Dalmatians take a tour of a "[[Kanine Krunchies]]" factory, they are told not to mark any territory during the tour. Whizzer gives the audience a look of disappointment.

==Live-action appearances==
===''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''===
In the live-action adaptation, Whizzer was one of the original 15 puppies given birth to by [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]. When [[Jasper and Horace]] raided the Dearly's house to kidnap the puppies and bring them to [[Cruella De Vil]], Whizzer took a bite at Jasper's hand as the Badun tried to reach out to grab him, causing Jasper to hit his head above on the counter.

When [[Jasper and Horace's truck|the van]] arrived in Suffolk and the Baduns went into a pub, Whizzer was able to wiggle out of the bag and bark to [[Kipper]] the Airedale terrier, who then informed the farm animals about this during the Twilight Bark. During the escape, Whizzer distracted Horace and Jasper; some cases being tricking Jasper into stepping on a loose floorboard and falling through it, or Horace slipping on some ice and flying out the window. He eventually escapes with Kipper's help and returns home.

In this version, it is said that Whizzer is amongst the bravest of the pups. Despite being very brave, he had a constant bladder problem, often urinating in places he shouldn't, hence his name. Another display of his bladder issue is when he's escaping from [[Hell Hall|De Vil Manor]] and relieves himself on a fashion magazine, with Cruella's picture on the cover.

==Video games==
Whizzer (based on his "live-action" appearance) appears as one of the main two Dalmatians in the PC game ''[[101 Dalmatians: Escape from DeVil Manor]]'' where he, along with Patches, try to escape the Baduns and find their way out of the manor. Whizzer mainly serves as a guide the player talks to for hints, in case they get stuck on a certain puzzle. In the game, he claims that he is good at figuring stuff out and climbing items.

In ''[[Animated StoryBook: 101 Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians: Animated Storybook]]'', on one page, three Dalmatian pups jump into a boot in the Dearly's lounge. While he may not be referred to by name, one of the pups comments, "Ewww, it's wet in here!" to which another pup replies with, "Sorry." It is possible the pup who apologizes might be Whizzer.

==Printed media==
Whizzer has also appeared in his own line of books, such as ''Whizzer's Bad Day'' and ''Whizzer's Christmas''.

In ''Whizzer's Bad Day'', it shows Whizzer trying to be optimistic and see the positive side of things that happen to him, such as him being splashed by the sprinkler is seen as a bath; when he accidentally trips and lands on his back, claiming that he saw a bone-shaped cloud when he did; when he also claims that he gets to decorate the road he is on; when he is covered in paint; and saying that he likes the sound of a bee that nearly stings him. He explains this to the Dalmatians when they ask him about it.

==Trivia==
*In most tie-in material to the movie, he is portrayed as playful and loud, and often annoys his sister, [[Jewel]].
*In some books, it is said that Whizzer likes to bark a lot and usually keeps the other pups up during the night with his barking.
*Out of all of the (named) supporting puppies in the TV series, Whizzer has the least amount of lines. With the exceptions of his speaking roles in "[[Love 'Em and Flea 'Em]]", "[[Bad to the Bone]]", "[[Walk on the Wild Side]]", and the Video-CD version of "[[Dalmatian Vacation (episode)|Dalmatian Vacation Part One: Road Warriors]]", most of his lines are only one word or cheering/laughing.
*In the episode "[[Purred It Through the Grapevine]]" (which is Whizzer's first speaking role in airing order), he is voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]], the voice of [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]], instead of [[Christine Cavanaugh]].
