And our focus groups tell us 18 to 35 year olds are unhappy. They're not happy with happy. So, maybe you should, I don't know, spend a little less time worrying about the dog's Method acting and more time figuring out how to stop 20 year olds in Topeka from changing the channel. Because if you lose so much as half a rating point, so help me, I will fire everyone in this room, starting with [[The Director|you]]! How's that for real?''"

}}'''Mindy Parker''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2008]] animated feature film ''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]''. She is a member of the network, analyzing the ratings of the ''Bolt ''TV show.

==Role in the film==
One day after a take of a ''Bolt'' episode, Mindy arrives at the Sovereign Entertainment studio, catching the [[The Director|show's director]] ranting about a visible boom mic in one shot. After she introduces herself, he describes his vision of the show, mainly on Bolt's "method acting." Mindy is unfazed and pressures him to make the show less "predictable" by threatening to fire the entire crew, starting with him, if the show loses its ratings. As a consequence of her warnings, the Director makes the cliffhanger episode that causes [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] to run away from his trailer.

When [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]] and her [[Penny's Mother|mother]] are trying to find Bolt, Mindy tells Penny that she understands what she is feeling and that she needs to let Bolt go, so a lot of people will not lose their jobs with the uncompleted episode. Her ultimate fate after the [[Sovereign Entertainment|studio]] catches fire and Bolt and Penny start to live an normal life is unknown.

==Trivia==
*While not the villain of the story, Mindy instigates the actions that lead to the actions of the entire movie: her push to raise certain ratings demographics leads to the Director to instigate cliffhangers, leading to Bolt's separation from Penny and ending up in New York; and the actions by the Agent to force Penny to move on to a new dog, which ultimately leads to both the original Bolt and Penny leaving the show.
