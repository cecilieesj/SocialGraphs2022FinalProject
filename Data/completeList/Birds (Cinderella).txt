The '''Birds''' are [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'s feathered friends in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1950]] animated film, ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.

== Background ==

===Physical appearance===
The birds have blue feathers with yellow beaks. Both wear brown shoes on their feet. The female bird wears a green shawl, and the other bird wears a magenta hat and vest.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''===
At the start of the film, these bluebirds first appear when waking Cinderella up, bathing her, and getting her dressed for the day. They also help to fix a [[Cinderella's Dress|ball gown]] for Cinderella with help from the [[mice]]. Near the end of the film, when [[Lucifer]] has trapped [[Jaq and Gus|Gus]] and a key to Cinderella's room (stolen from [[Lady Tremaine]] with [[Jaq and Gus|Jaq]]) in a bowl, the birds attack Lucifer by dropping cups and plates on him, but the cat shoos them off. Then Cinderella instructs them to get [[Bruno (Cinderella)|Bruno]]. They fly down to the shed to wake up the dog. The birds help Bruno into the chateau so the dog can chase and frighten Lucifer away.

===''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]''===
The birds help the [[Fairy Godmother]] and the mice to create a book of stories for Cinderella. They also have a role in the short "An Uncommon Romance", in which, under Cinderella's instructions, they steal [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]]'s hat and get her to chase them in an attempt to bring her together with the [[Baker]].

===''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''===
Only two of the bluebirds appear in the film, where they assist Jaq and Gus on helping Cinderella's quest to regain [[Prince Charming]]'s memories of her. They are the ones to lead Prince Charming to Cinderella.

===[[Cinderella (2015 film)|''Cinderella'' (2015)]]===
As seen in one of the film's official trailers, the birds make an appearance in the live-action adaptation of the original 1950 classic, reprising their roles as one of Cinderella's animal friends.

===''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''===
Netizen versions of the birds appear in the film. They appear when Cinderella inquires [[Vanellope von Schweetz]]'s status as a princess when asked if animals could talk to her. At the climax, they help the [[Disney Princess|princesses]] save [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]] by attaching the ropes made from [[Rapunzel]]'s [[Rapunzel's Magic Hair|hair]] to [[Snow White]]'s dress.

In the film, none of the birds are blue. Some are red and others are green.
