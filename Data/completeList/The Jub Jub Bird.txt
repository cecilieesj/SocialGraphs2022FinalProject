==Background==
The Jub Jub Bird appears as a vulture under control of the [[Red Queen]]. He has a large crest, stubby, broad wings, and seems to be a very primitive bird, without teeth. But, he has a well-developed blue tongue as well as a beak with red markings on it to resemble lipstick and long legs that resemble those of a Quetzalcoatlus. His plumage is heavily striped like a zebra, which may be used to confuse prey, and he has a long neck and large red eyes. Contrasting to his long legs and neck, the Jubjub has a relatively short tail. He makes a low husky shriek.

==Appearances==
===''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
In the film, the Jub Jub Bird captures both [[The Tweedle Boys|Tweedledee and Tweedledum]] away from [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]] during an ambush after Alice consults with [[Absolem|the Caterpillar]]. He is not seen again until [[Tarrant Hightopp|the Mad Hatter]] and [[Mallymkun|The Dormouse]] are about to be executed, [[Chessur|The Cheshire Cat]] reveals himself and the Hatter exposes the Red Queen's inner circle as frauds, also forming a following from the prisoners in the audience, so the Queen releases the Jub Jub Bird to set people straight. The Jub Jub Bird accompanies the Red Queen's forces into battle against [[White Queen]].

During the final battle, after the Hatter interferes, the Jub Jub Bird joins in the fight. During battle, the Dormouse strikes him with her sword, followed by the [[Bandersnatch]] toppling over a line of [[Armored Cards]] causing a domino effect which later stops when it hits the Armored Cards preparing to place a giant boulder on a catapult, to which the Cards readying the catapult are suddenly toppled; this triggers the catapult to fire the boulder at the Jub Jub Bird cornering the Dormouse, as it lands on his head, which fatally crushes him to death.
