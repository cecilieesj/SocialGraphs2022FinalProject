'''Palifico''' is a character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Under command of [[Davy Jones]], Palifico serves as a crew member of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Palifico has characteristics of sea creatures - he is shown with a fire coral crest on top of his head, a coral and bone structure forming an exoskeleton on his body in place of his eyes, nose, and mouth, and two tube worms on his eye sockets.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Palifico and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Palifico and the other crewmen went on it and held his motley crew (especially [[Cotton]]) as prisoners.

During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Palifico watched [[Maccus]], [[Koleniko]], and [[Clanker]] play the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.

The next day, Palifico and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Palifico and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Throughout the ambush, Palifico and the other crewmen become distracted upon hearing a bell tower and attacked [[Pintel and Ragetti|Pintel, Ragetti]], and [[Elizabeth Swann]] during a sword fight in combat. The motley crew managed to escape from him and the rest of the ''Dutchman'' pirates. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Palifico and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack, much to the captain's rage.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Palifico returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Palifico and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Palifico and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Palifico was present atop the crow's nest watching the crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men. After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Palifico and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==Video game appearances==
