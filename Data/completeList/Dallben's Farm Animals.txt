'''Dallben's Farm Animals '''are minor characters in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1985]] animated feature film, ''[[The Black Cauldron]]''. They appear early in the film, while [[Taran]] dreams of becoming a warrior.

The farm animals are:
*[[Hen Wen]]
*Geese, that Taran harasses as they waddle quietly. Taran mimics a warrior and they play the role of minions.
*The Goat, whom Taran put a stick between his horns and shakes it, because he plays the role of the [[Horned King]], thanks to his horns.
