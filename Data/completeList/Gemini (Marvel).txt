'''Ernest Hazard Koenig''', also known as '''Gemini''' is a character on the [[Marvel Television|Marvel]]/[[ABC]] series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. He first appears in  "[[The New Deal]]". He is a bootlegger, and the agents encounter him, when travelling back in time, to [[1931]], while trying to stop the Chronicom Hunters. He goes on to become an SSR asset who kept peace, while working behind the bar, The Krazy Kanoe. He is also the grandfather of the Koenig siblings, who later go on to become prominent [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. He is portrayed by [[Patton Oswalt]].

==History==
In [[New York City]], Koenig runs a bar, where he distributes alcohol, illegally at an old speakeasy. He goes under the alias of Gemini to conceal his true identity. He also takes in [[Freddy Malick|Freddy]], for work and shelter at a discounted price, after his father died, and he was left on the street.<ref name="TND">"[[The New Deal]]"</ref>

In [[1931]], two agents enter his premise and ask for his whereabouts. Per his order, they are attacked by the staff, though manage to apprehend them, before Koenig reveals himself. They introduce themselves, and claim to come in peace, much to his annoyance, as he is surrounded by injured members of his staff. The three sit down together, and the two agents question why his staff were seen bribing someone, with his alcohol. A defensive Koenig dismisses their accusations, and they question where he gets his supply of alcohol from, sourcing recent deaths that are part of their ongoing investigation. The two parties shared personal experiences, of death, prompt Koenig to confess he will be supplying alcohol at a political party, having paid the cops, to turn their cheeks. Koenig has Freddy work at the party, and also arranges the agents, [[Alphonso Mackenzie|Mack]] and [[Phil Coulson (LMD)|Coulson]] to work there too. Following an attack by the Chronicoms, at the party, Agents Coulson and [[Quake|Johnson]], enter the premise with Viola, a woman bleeding to death. Koenig is confused as to what transpired, and questions where Freddy is, and who Johnson is. When Coulson informs Koenig, Freddy is a target, Koenig is stumped, explaining to them he isn't anyone of significance, and his father, Malick's debts were paid, when the latter killed himself.<ref name="TND"/>

Koenig's suspicious of Coulson and Daisy's intentions further grow. He expresses his frustration at the trouble they've brought and his worry for Freddy. At the same moment, he hears a bang on the door, and finds two women (Agents [[Jemma Simmons|Simmons]] and [[Yo-Yo|Rodriguez]]) enter his premises to work on Viola. Simmons works on the body, while Koenig attempts to gather more information on Freddy's whereabouts, and learns that the police are raiding bars, in search of Freddy's location. When the Chronicoms arrive to Koenig's bar, under the guise of policeman, Koenig hides the group is a saferoom, while he distracts them. As they question what he knows, Koenig tries to keep them from his office, where his saferoom is located, though he is unsuccessful. Koenig offers them a drink in an attempt to diverge their attention, and they eventually leave, instructing him to tell them of Wilfred Malick's location. As they leave, Koenig recalls them back to the main bar, in disbelief of what he is risking for team, and witnesses them interrogate Viola. When Simmons discovers a mysterious liquid on Viola's show, Koenig watches in admiration, as she performs an analysis, with some equipment from his bar. When she successfully identifies the substance as the unfinished [[Super Soldier Serum|super soldier serum]] used by [[Red Skull|Johann Schmidt]] during World War II, Koenig remains skeptical of their findings, and simply listens in disbelief. The group learn from Viola, Freddy is expected to make a meeting at Hell's Harbor, and Koenig offers to show the team where it is, on the condition he too, be allowed to accompany them. Coulson guides Koenig to their time-travelling ship, the Zephyr in a blindfold, and as Koenig unfolds himself, he becomes in awe of his surroundings, as looks upon future technology, and sees Enoch, a Chronicom, with a metallic head. He accuses the group of being martians from outer space, though they quickly dismiss these claims, as they ask for help, in locating Freddy. Coulson explains to him, they're time-travellers from the future, and Freddy and his family to-be, will be responsible the death of thousands in the future. Despite this Koenig vouches for Freddy's innocence, on the basis he can't be punished for something he hasn't yet done. When the team realize they have a limited time, on their mission, they task Koenig to retrieve Freddy, while they look for their peers. Koenig arrives with Daisy, Coulson and Enoch, in the middle of a shootout with the Chronicom Hunters. As they begin firing, Koenig follows Freddy into an empty warehouse, and makes an attempt to dissuade him form completing the delivery. A black car pulls up, and as Koenig tries to convince Freddy to leave with him, he is shot in the shoulder, by Freddy, who leaves. Enoch finds Koenig, but is urged to leave, by him, after a message from Coulson tells him the Zephyr is set to depart. Enoch misses the Zephyr, and the group are forced to leave without him, and so Koenig allows him to take refuge at his bar, where Enoch works as a bartender, on the requirement he informs him more of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], in hopes he can help. Enoch reveals to him, Koenig is destined to be of help to the group in the future, as is his establishment. Koenig additionally asks Enoch about robots such as himself, expressing his fascination, and Enoch corrects him by stating he is a Chronicom, and also shares the same fascination as his future grandchildren to-be. The two then cheers, to the start of a new friendship.<ref name="KYO">"[[Know Your Onions]]"</ref>
