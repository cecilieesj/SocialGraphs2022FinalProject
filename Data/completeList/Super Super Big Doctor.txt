'''Super Super Big Doctor''' is the main antagonist of ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe]]''. She took a planet by force and brainwashed the inhabitants into serving her. She wants to be seen as special and lives on the planet [[Feebla-Oot]]. 

==Appearance==
She is a tall, light green alien with curled horns resembling hair and russet eyes. She wears an orange dress with magenta sleeves with silver cuffs on her arms, a silver belt, magenta leggings, and light gray boots that reach up to her knees.

==Personality==
She seems gentle and kind, but she is later revealed to be manipulative and is actually only interested in powering her plant, which creates brainwashing spores. She used to dislike her brothers and didn't want them to have fun. She is later revealed to be quite similar to Candace. 

She was finally convinced by Candace to give up her plot by pointing out that taking control of those around her won't make her feel any special than others, though this led to her downfall as she ended up being devoured by Mama by mistake and transported back to Feebla-Oot to be taken to prison.

== History ==
She is first shown as Candace is entering her throne room.

**The palace has an ominous tone
