==Background==
===Official Description===
{{Quote|Callisto Mal, president of Avalonia, has a long history with the Clade family. Once a member of Jaeger's expedition team, Callisto ultimately followed a different path. She's determined to solve the mystery of what is plaguing pando, becoming the driving force behind the mission to the strange world... She has the confidence to make decisions, but she’s thoughtful and able to see things from a human perspective... She's almost the opposite of Jaeger... She's not about her own legacy or legend. She’s there for the people of Avalonia.|Lissa Treiman describing Callisto<ref>[https://whatsondisneyplus.com/strange-world-inside-scoop-on-the-characters-environments/ Strange World: Inside Scoop On The Characters & Environments]</ref>}}
