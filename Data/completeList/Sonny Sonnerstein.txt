'''Sonny Sonerstein''' is an insult stand-up comic and ghost who appeared in the episode, "[[Be My Ghost]]". He debuted his iconic rubber chicken act at a Ski Resort Hotel, and continued to regularly perform there as a ghost after it was bought out, though he left.

==Relationships==
===[[Principal Larry|Larry]]===
Larry meets Sonny after falling down an elevator in the hotel, and thinks his jokes are hilarious even when at his own expense. He enjoys Sonny's old act, including the chicken jokes, and they become friendly. Larry even helps reunite Sonny with his favorite rubber chicken, which was kept behind glass, which ghosts could not pass through. Although Rippen and Larry are tasked to capture Sonny and send him to limbo to succeed their mission, Larry begins crying at the thought of hurting his new friend, opening limbo and leaving, and Rippen gives up. They remain friends afterwards.

==Trivia==
*Sonny may be inspired by the Rat Pack, a supergroup often associated today with singer Frank Sinatra, who was close friends with insult comic [[Don Rickles]].
