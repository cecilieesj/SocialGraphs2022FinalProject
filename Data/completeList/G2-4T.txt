'''G2-4T''' is a droid from [[Star Tours]] and its prequel [[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
G2-4T was a G2 unit repair-droid or, "Goose Droid" which was owned by the [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]] company.  He is quite rude and gets yelled at for insulting guests (followed by "Heh-heh-heh") or telling them things about Star Tours' rough past.

Sometime before the Battle of Yavin, he served as a security agent at  Spaceport THX1138.  Years later he was repurposed to work as a foreman over several other goose-droids, including [[G2-9T]].  After Star Tours shut down he came into the ownership of a smuggler named Talon Karrde'''.'''

=== Development History ===
In the original attraction, he was voiced by Mike West. In ''The Adventures Continue'', he is voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]].  His audio-animatronic was recycled from that of one of the [[Singing Geese]] from the defunct attraction [[America Sings]].  The, "Goose Droid" nickname given to his type of droid is a reference to this.

== Appearances ==

=== Star Tours ===
G2 appeared in the Sector 2 section of the queue area.  He and G2-9T usually get temporarily shut down for talking and not doing their jobs.

=== Star Tours: The Adventures Continue ===
In Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, G2-4T is a security agent for Star Tours rather than being a foreman.
