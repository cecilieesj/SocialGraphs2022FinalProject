}}'''Emeline Partridge''' is a supporting character from [[the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Emeline Partridge was the nanny and possible agent of child-star [[Sally Shine]] during the 1930s. On the Halloween of [[1939]], they attended [[the Hollywood Tower Hotel]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. Tragically, lightning-struck the elevator which she and Sally were in and the five passengers within were killed.

The spirits of the dead would be trapped in the nightmarish [[The 5th Dimension|5th dimension]] and be bound to the hotel for seemingly eternity. When the hotel was reopened in the 1990s, she and the other ghosts had many encounters with new guests and potential victims of the hotel.

== Appearances ==

=== The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ===
She is found with the other ghosts in the ride's pre-show portraying her fate and later as a ghost in the hallway. Her likeness is found in the 5th dimension and at the end of the ride she waves goodbye to guests.

== Other Appearances ==

=== ''[[Tower of Terror (film)|Tower of Terror]]'' ===
While very little, if any, information is known about her, she is known to be of Irish descent and has been taking care of Sally Shine for a long time. In the early chapters of the film, Abigail Gregory blamed Emeline for the incident, claiming that she cast an evil spell on the actress out of annoyance over Sally's attitude, yet it turned out to be the opposite - Emeline actually cared for the girl as if she was her own daughter, despite being strict and initially hostile to anyone who tried to disturb them. This was reinforced when she and the other ghosts were shocked and dismayed over her being the fall-guy for Abigail's evil machinations.

== Trivia ==
* Sally Shine being made to resemble historic child-actress [[Shirley Temple]] could be an indication that Emeline was somewhat abusive regarding Sally's career and operations; given the historic tragedies regarding Temple's stardom.
