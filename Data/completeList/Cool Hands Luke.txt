'''Cool Hands Luke''' is a minor character in ''[[TaleSpin]]''. He is the primary antagonist of the episode "[[Feminine Air]]".

He makes fun of the fact that [[Higher for Hire]] is run by [[Rebecca Cunningham|a woman]] and presses the issue to drive away business for the company. His winning streak in the Air Scavenger Race (achieved through cheating) was broken when Rebecca and [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] (in his "Tan-Margaret" persona) beat him and revealed him to be a fraud.
