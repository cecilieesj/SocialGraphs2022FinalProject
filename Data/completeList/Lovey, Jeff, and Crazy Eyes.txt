'''Lovey''', '''Jeff''', and '''Crazy Eyes''' are a trio of pigeons in the [[2019]] [[Blue Sky Studios]] animated film, ''[[Spies in Disguise]]''. While Lovey is initially Walter's pet pigeon, Jeff and Crazy Eyes are wild pigeons - although they help Lance Sterling defeat Killian in battle after Lance got along with the pigeons after not being used to the three.

==Background==
<tabber>
Lovey=
Lovey is an average sized female pigeon with wide amber brown eyes. Her head and chest are white and are separated by a vaguely heart shaped collar of brown feathers. The brown feathers of her neck can be fluffed out to make Lovey look bigger or more attractive. Her wings and tail feathers are also brown.

Much like her name would suggest, Lovey is an affectionate and trusting pigeon who often nuzzles people and birds sheâ€™s grown attached to. Her behavior borders on flirtatious with Lance Sterling. Lovey is also immensely loyal and helps her friends and flockmates in anyway she can. Her loyalty leads her to be protective of her loved ones, so she can be fairly aggressive at times.
|-|Jeff=
Jeff is a large pigeon with purple upper feathers and white lower feathers, circular eye marks, and black pupils and is the heaviest of them in the trio.
|-|Crazy Eyes=
Crazy Eyes is a small, wiry pigeon with a long neck and huge, heterochromatic eyes. Crazy Eyes is distinguished by his unfocused green and blue eye as well as the pink lollipop stuck to his head. Aside from these features, Crazy Eyes has normal greyish blue colored feathers with short fled feathers up and along his neck.

==Role in the film==
Lovey hears [[Walter Beckett|Walter]] watching his favorite TV show ''Hearts in Seoul'' to which while watching a couple emotionally falling in love, Walter explains to Lovey that dreams sometimes come true just as Lovey retreats as Walter goes to check his invention. Walter asks Lovey to borrow a feather from her to which the pigeon agrees and gives him one of her feathers before giving her breadcrumbs. Walter tests the experiment to give to Walter to which it tested successfully. [[Lance Sterling]] then sees Lovey flying around the room after drinking the formula he tested to which Walter explained that the formula uses a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic editor to put  Lance's DNA on a molecular level to which Lance explains that the experiment will transform Lance into a pigeon all of a sudden, explaining to Lance about the future of espionage. All of a sudden, Lance transforms into a pigeon as the formula Lance drank contains pigeon DNA. After Lance finds himself as a pigeon, Lovey gets attracted to him, confusing Lance for her mate just Walter explains to Lance the fact about pigeons being found in major cities around the world. Lance then tells Walter to make an antidote for him to turn him back into a human.

During the chase, it is then revealed that Walter brought Lovey as his supportive animal just as [[Marcy Kappel|Marcy]], Eyes, and Ears chase the three across the street. Lovey remains in the car unhurt while watching Walter and Lance escape.

On their plane, Lovey watches Walter explaining to her that there are several gadgets he plans to test, to which he explains that the multi-pen is the one he hasn't tested yet and later watches Walter making the antidote explaining that it will take 18 hours to make. She then flies next to Lance as Walter tells him to adapt in his pigeon form just before the plane arrives at a hotel riviera at Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.

Arriving at Playa Del Carmen, Crazy Eyes sits next to a visitor who unawarely places a lollipop on his head to which he flies away. Later when Lance accidentally loses control of seeing the food on the floor, Jeff and Crazy Eyes watch him eat the food to which he encounters Lovey again to which Lance feels uncomfortable upon seeing three pigeons next to him as Walter starts to believe that Lance made some new friends. Jeff follows Lance who is on his way getting a hotel card to access [[Katsu Kimura]]'s hotel room. Upon getting the card, he becomes distracted upon seeing Jeff and Crazy Eyes again as Lance becomes annoyed at the pigeons to which as the two fly away, the receptionist hits Lance with her keyboard and is placed into a trash bag.

Lance finds himself near the trash cans as Jeff and Crazy Eyes appear next to him to which Crazy Eyes spits out the key card, after which the two follow Lance to Kimura's room as Walter explains that he might help him on his way to which Lance then denies as he plans to go by himself much to Walter and the pigeon trio's worry. Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes arrive at Kimura's room much to his annoyance to the pigeons to which as Lance talks to Kimura about to know where Killian is, Lance bumps into a nearby table as a lamp falls on him just as Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes fly away in retreat. The three pigeons then notice Walter using the truth serum against Kimura to which Kimura explains that Killian is on his way to Venice to steal the Agent Database, leading the two to go to Venice to find Killian and stop him from destroying the world. Later, Lovey notices Marcy and her squadron of agents preparing to enter Kimura's room, much to Lance's worry to which he and Walter use Kimura to lock the door.

Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes later notice the two being chased by Marcy across the hotel to which upon noticing the soldiers surrounding the two, Crazy Eyes swallows the multi-pen and sprays a large amount of serious string on the soldiers, trapping them in gum as the two manage to escape from Marcy.

Onboard the ship at the Adriatic Sea, Lovey, Jeff and Crazy Eyes begin to pester Lance during his conversation with Walter to which Walter notices that the antidote is complete; however, the test was unsuccessful after getting a pigeon feather from Lance in his pigeon form instead of getting one from Lovey.

Arriving at Venice, Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes join alongside Lance and Walter, telling him that he needs help. Lovey then later tells Lance to dispatch Marcy and her henchmen to which Lance denies. Furthermore, Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes teach Lance to fly like a pigeon as the three retrieve the database device from the M9 Assassin to which the drone prepares to target the pigeons. After a tough chase, Walter catches it as the M9 Assassin falls into water, losing it as the pigeons manage to escape from it. When [[Killian]] confronts Walter, Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes arrive next to Lance who is unable to attack Killian. After Walter throws a couple of breadcrumbs near him as the pigeons attack him, Lovey frees Lance who is stuck just as Lance, Walter, and the three pigeons escape.

Underwater, Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes board a submarine as Walter gets an egg from Lance which he recently laid in his pigeon form to which it is shown that Walter has used Lovey's DNA in the serum-hence Lance having the body of a female pigeon-just as he adds it to the antidote for Lance to become a human. Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes watch Lance turn into a human once again thanks to Walter's antidote just as the submarine arrives at the Covert Weapons Facility at the North Sea. Lance then explains to Walter that he should finish his assignment by himself, leaving Walter, Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes on the sub. The three pigeons and Walter later notice the two M9 Assassin models approaching and destroying the sub to which they survive the attack.

Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes later enter Killian's lab along with Walter who reunites with Lance. They later take part during battle when Lance uses one of his explosive gadgets as they fly past the glitter and the M9 Assassin models as Crazy Eyes fires a blast at two of them, followed by Marcy joining in. During battle, Walter hands the pigeons various of his gadgets to stall Killian while he continues taking over Killian's system.

Lovey then uses a disarmed M9 Assassin model to shoot down an active one preparing to attack Marcy to which Marcy thanks her for saving her. Lovey, Jeff, Crazy Eyes, and a couple of other pigeons deploy another of Walter's gadgets called Fifty Shades of Yay to help Lance defeat Killian. Crazy Eyes later fires icy blasts at two more drones as well as the serious string at Killian, to which he throws a piece of debris at him, causing him to spit out the multi-pen and lose it. Noticing that Walter is caught with Killian trying to escape, Lovey hands Lance a serum along with a feather to help Lance turn back into a pigeon once again.

Later on, Lance (in his pigeon form) then rescues Walter falling to his demise as Lovey, Jeff, Crazy Eyes, and a flock of pigeons rescue him from falling into the ocean. After the battle ends, the three land next to Lance and Walter just before being brought back to Washington, D.C. to which it is found out that the two are fired from the agency. Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes listen to the conversation between Lance and Walter as the three eat breadcrumbs next to the two just before the two are taken back to help the agency for their future.

==Trivia==
*At one point when Lance and Walter arrive at Playa Del Carmen, the spaghetti scene from "[[Bella Notte]]" was parodied during the part where Lance (in his pigeon) goes out of control and starts eating food, one which is a loose noodle which is later consumed by Lovey after Lance starts to eat it.
