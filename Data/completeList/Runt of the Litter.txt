==Background==
===Personality===
Runt is much larger than the other children but is far smaller than the other massive members of his family. Runt is easily frightened and prone to panic.

==Appearances==
===''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''===
Runt is [[Chicken Little (2005 character)|Chicken Little]]'s close friend and one of Little's classmates at Mr. Woolensworth's class. Later, during a game of dodgeball when Little is having a conversation to Abby about his problem last year, he tries to get involved in the conversation, only to get hit repeatedly by dodgeballs from the other team. Later, when Little stands up against Foxy Loxy, Runt, Abby and Fish prepare to save Chicken Little, who only triggered a fire alarm in the gym. After [[Chicken Little 2|Chicken Little]] subsequently signs up for the baseball team, Runt, Abby and Fish train him to become a better player at baseball so he can make it on the field, due to being repeatedly benched in favor of better players like Foxy. They are then seen witnessing him score the winning run of a big game, despite everyone's belief that he can't do it. 

However, that night, a hexagonal object hits Little while he's in his room while he's celebrating his victory. After he freaks out upon recognizing it as the same thing that hit him a year ago, he calls up Runt and Abby while they're doing karaoke and asks them to come over to his house, where he shows them his discovery. However, Fish then accidently turns it on, which causes it to zoom away with him still on it. He, Abby and Little then follow in pursuit, which leads them to the UFO that it's a part of and infiltrate it to rescue Fish. They quickly discover that he is safe, but then come across a chart of the solar system that depicts many other planets being crossed out and there's being highlighted, which makes them panic and assume that the aliens are planning to take over Earth. They then run into the aliens, who assume they took their child since he left the spot he's usually in (when in reality, he just followed them out of curiosity). They quickly flee in terror with the aliens in pursuit, and while Runt get stuck in the hole that they try to leave through, Chicken Little manages to keep pressing the button enough that he's able to keep them from entering the room while Abby manages to get him unstuck, allowing them to narrowly escape.

After they get chased through a corn field, but ultimately escape, Runt, Abby and Fish work together to get Chicken Little up to the top of Oakey Oak Middle School in order to ring the bell to warn the citizens. Runt is later seen among the crowd of citizens when Chicken Little explains the discovery of aliens to them. Runt is later seen attempting to prove that Chicken Little was telling the truth when his mother scolds him for his nonsense (even threatening to take his Barbra Streisand collection despite his protests) as she takes him away, with the citizens not understanding or believing him. Later when Chicken Little is moping over feeling like his reputation is ruined again, he, Abby and Fish are suddenly frightened when they discover Kirby, but thanks to Fish's ability to understand him and translate, they find out that he's the child of the aliens they just encountered. Just then, the aliens show up again with a whole armada of spaceships and invade Oakey Oaks, and when Chicken Little runs off after Kirby after trying to tell his dad about what's going on, who doesn't understand what he's trying to tell him, Runt, Abby, and Fish are seen trying to get Buck's attention and convince him that Chicken Little is telling the truth about his discovery as he runs off after his son. 

After Chicken Little and his father finally talk and reconcile, Runt faints upon seeing Abby acting weirdly, thinking she is brainwashed by the aliens (when really, she is just lovestruck after Chicken Little confessed he's always liked her and kissed her). shortly after that, Runt, Fish and Abby manage to rescue Buck and Little from the ground troops when they surround them by commandeering a fire truck and help them reach Town Hall when Chicken Little plans to climb to the top of the building and reunite Kirby with his parents since the mothership is hovering right above it. After his plan succeeds and the aliens are restoring Oakey Oaks back to normal, Runt is later seen mingling with Foxy after her personality has been altered as a result of her brainwaves being scrambled when she was teleported back from their ship. 

At the end of the film, Runt is seen along with Chicken Little, his father, his other friends and many citizens of Oakey Oaks watching an in-universe movie depicting an extremely fanciful retelling of the events that transpired that portrays Chicken Little as an action hero also named "Ace", which everyone enjoys despite it's lack of accuracy. It also depicts future version of his friends, with the future version of Runt replying to the future version of Chicken Little about engaging the alien invasion: "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough|Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low...]]". Despite the fact that his future self's ship takes a hit for future Chicken Little's, Runt gleefully mouths his counterpart's final words: "Just give me some ammo, a little water, some chips if you have 'em." (which was very similar to what Runt himself said earlier), before whispering to Fish that "This is amazingly accurate."

Runt is later seen during the credits singing the duet "[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]" with [[Foxy Loxy (2005)|Foxy]].

==Trivia==
*During the scene where Fish Out of Water falls on the ground when pretending to be King Kong, Runt then says "'Twas beauty that killed the beast", an allusion to the classic fairytale and 1991 Disney film ''Beauty and the Beast''. This is also a famous line from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1933_film) 1933 adaptation of ''King Kong''], though misquoted.
**Also during the scene where Chicken Little, Abby, Runt, and Fish discover Kirby before multiple aliens attack Oakey Oaks, Runt explains "[[Darth Vader]] is [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s father?", making an allusion to Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, characters from the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.
