But in actuality, he's a good student who gets straight A's. After they pick on Linwood in the school's hallway, Alexandria Quarry approaches them, especially to see Eric, as she has a thing for him. After they talk briefly before departing and Theldin Lombard approaches Alexandria, Theldin then heads into a classroom where finds Eric, who's holding a struggling but weak tarantula named Guildenstern. Somebody had poisoned the arachnid. After Guildenstern is taken away to the animal hospital by ambulance, Fillmore and Ingrid are put on the case.
