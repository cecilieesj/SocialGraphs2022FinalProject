The '''"Butcher Boy"''' is one of the nine child-eating giants that live in giant country. Butcher Boy's clothing is made out of a circus tent, hence the red and yellow stripes on his clothes. He is the "baby" of the tribe, being quite immature and known to collect cars which he keeps in a sack. He is quite chubby and has short dark hair.

He, along with the [[Fleshlumpeater]], [[Bloodbottler]], [[Meatdripper]], [[Gizzardgulper]], [[Maidmasher]], [[Manhugger]], [[Childchewer]], and [[Bonecruncher]], enjoy snatching and gobbling up little children at night while [[The BFG (character)|The BFG]] delivers dreams to the children.
