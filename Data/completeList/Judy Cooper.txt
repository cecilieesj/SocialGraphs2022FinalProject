'''Judy Cooper '''is the 9-year-old robotic daughter. She is one of the main characters in ''[[K.C. Undercover]]''.

==Physical Appearance==
Judy is a 10-year-old spy android meant to look like a human. She often wears her hair in two afro puffs with two bows holding it up, thus dressing age-appropriate for the character she portrays. Judy typically wears mismatched earrings.
==Personality==
Judy is sarcastic, precocious, and sassy. She is also funny at times. At first, she had no feelings for her new family, but when K.C. gets in big trouble for failing a mission Judy is supposed to tell but pretends to have a 'glitch' to save K.C. She starts to have feelings for her family later on in the episode. She takes pleasure in smack-talking the Coopers and often folds her arms while making sarcastic barbs. However, she has shown to reciprocate feelings towards her family when they need it. She gives K.C. advice, though rarely.

== Family ==

=== K.C. Cooper ===
K.C. is Ernie and Judy's tomboyish sister. Judy tries to help K.C. out by pretending to 'glitch' when the spies are interrogating her about what happened during a mission when K.C. failed. They seem to have a healthy relationship, though Judy often ruins nice moments by making a sarcastic remark. 

=== Kira Cooper ===
Kira is K.C., Ernie, and Judy's mother. Judy always follows Kira’s authority above anyone else’s and often takes enjoyment in selling others out who disobey Kira’s rules, as when K.C. snuck a visit to Abby despite her mother’s objections. 

=== Craig Cooper ===
Craig is K.C., Ernie, and Judy's father. Although Judy is a robot, he treats Judy as a real daughter. Judy often takes pleasure in teasing him about the way he eats, as when he called him “Spongy-Cakes-at-Three A.M.-Guy”. 

=== Ernie Cooper ===
Ernie is K.C. and Judy's nerdy brother. As Ernie is the "computer guy" of the group, he fixes Judy's glitches on occasion, usually due to the fact that he is the cause. Above anyone else, Judy takes great pleasure in belittling Ernie, though she subtly calls him cool sometimes when people, such as Collin, make fun of him. She always tried to prove herself better than him, though she loves him a lot.{{Stub}}
