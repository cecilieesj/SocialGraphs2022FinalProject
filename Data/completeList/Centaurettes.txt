The '''Centaurettes''' first appeared during the "[[The Pastoral Symphony|Pastoral Symphony]]" in ''[[Fantasia]]''. They were truly supremely lovely, stunning, fair, majestic and elegant and beautiful female horse-like girls (centaurettes) of different colors who were in love with the male horse-like [[Centaurs (Fantasia)|centaurs]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
The supremely beautiful and gorgeous centaurettes are first seen by the river and a waterfall. Some of them were swimming in the river and splashing each other for fun. The ones on dry land were assisted by the small [[Cherubs|cherubs]] with their hair and makeup. The cherubs see the centaurs and help the centaurettes look their best to attract the attention of the centaurs. Each centaurette was able to find a centaur to mate with, and are shown doing various fun activities with their new beaus.

The centaurettes and centaurs attend the Wine Festival honoring [[Bacchus (Fantasia)|Bacchus]] and help make the wine. Once Bacchus arrives, the centaurettes dance with him and the centaurs. One centaurette flirts with him and he pursues her. The others tease him as well and laugh when Bacchus accidentally kisses [[Jacchus]], his pet donkey. When Zeus arrives to torment them, they all take shelter under trees and in a cave. One centaurette saves a little [[Unicorns|unicorn]] that's trapped on a rock in the river before joining the others. Once Zeus departs, they watch the sunset before going to sleep.

==Trivia==
*Despite most myths depicting centaurs as a dominantly male race, the centaurettes have mythological ties: there were myths that identified female centaurs as the {{WikipediaLink|Centaurides}}, the rare class of female centaurs in Greek mythology.
