==Appearance==
Ernie bears a striking resemblance to his nephew. Besides being a warthog, it is unknown what he looks like when he's not in the clouds.

==Role in the series==
[[File:Uncle Ernie2.png|thumb|left|Ernie talking to his nephew.]]
When Pumbaa tells [[Timon]] that he cannot catch bugs anymore, Timon believes that it's because something's wrong with his senses of seeing, hearing, and smelling. So he buys Pumbaa a pair of glasses, two horns for his ears, and a vacuum cleaner for his snout. As Pumbaa hunts for the cricket, he falls off a cliff and passes out. He dreams that he gets caught by crickets. Pumbaa's uncle Ernie shows up in the clouds and he tells his nephew that he has to believe in himself to catch bugs. Pumbaa wakes up and follows his uncle's orders and he can catch bugs again.

==Trivia==
*Ernie is the second relative of the duo, being another one of Pumbaa's uncles, to appear in any ''[[The Lion King|Lion King]]'' continuity.
*He is named after [[Ernie Sabella]], Pumbaa's voice actor.
