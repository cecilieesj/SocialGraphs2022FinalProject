'''Conrad Meacham''' is a supporting character in the [[2016]] remake of ''[[Pete's Dragon (2016 film)|Pete's Dragon]]''. An old wood carver, he tells the tale of a [[Elliott|fierce dragon]] that lives in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. His daughter [[Grace Meacham|Grace]] believes his stories to be fictitious until finding a boy named [[Pete (Pete's Dragon)|Pete]], who claims to have met this dragon.

==Role in the film==
Conrad is first seen telling a story his encounter with an extremely elusive dragon said to live in the forests of Millhaven to a group of children just as his daughter Grace, who never saw a dragon, talks to him. Conrad then warns the children that the dragon [[Elliott|Elliot]] still lurks around Millhaven and those who enter the woods would encounter the elusive creature.

Furthermore, he appears again when his daughter [[Grace Meacham|Grace]] arrives in her father's study room where she asks him if he heard about [[Pete (Pete's Dragon)|Pete]] to which he did heard about Pete's adventures in Millhaven for six years to which her daughter gives him Pete's drawing of Elliot which reminds him of the other drawing, whom Conrad believes that he did another drawing of a dragon when Grace was five or six before her mother died, explaining that she was full of questions just as he tells his daughter about his flashback of his discovery of a dragon in the real world. He also explains to her that instead of hunting him down, he gently observes the majestic flying creature across the creek looking at the dragon, which changed his life forever.

The next day, Conrad, [[Natalie Magary|Natalie]], and Grace arrive at the forest to search for the dragon Elliot. Pete brings Elliot out of his cave showing Conrad's family as they gaze upon the dragon is curiosity. The moment, however, is interrupted when Elliot was struck by a tranquilizer dart fired by [[Gavin Magary|Gavin]], much to the Meacham family and Natalie attempting to stop Gavin and his group of hunters from hurting Elliot. Conrad urges Gavin to stop shooting him but refuses and continues firing more tranquilizer darts and Elliot ends up getting tied up by Gavin and his group of hunters. Conrad sadly gazes on Elliot who was tranquilized by Gavin and his hunters, alongside his daughter Grace, Natalie Magary, and Pete.

Arriving at the sawmill, Conrad asks Gavin to know what he will do with Elliot to which he explains that the dragon belongs to him much to his somber bellow. He later rides on the large truck where Elliot is lying at, crashing the truck out of the warehouse just as the crowd continues chasing Elliot who escaped the warehouse. Across the highway, Conrad spots [[Gene Dentler|Sheriff Dentler]]'s patrol squad and Gavin chasing Conrad, Pete, and Natalie. Meacham tries to stop the truck but the engines won't stop as the truck crashes into Gavin's pickup truck much to Gavin's shock.

During the epilogue, Conrad (offscreen) later narrates a monologue of how life changed ever since Elliot had rescued Jack and Grace from falling off a burning bridge thanks to his heroism and bravery for rescuing them just as Pete and his friends arrive at the hills of Millhaven to observe Elliot flying with a flock of dragons.
