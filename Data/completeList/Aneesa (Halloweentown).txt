She's a genie, one of [[Marnie Piper]]'s friends and one of the students in [[Witch University]]. She is the first genie to attend Witch University, and the student dorm advisor.

When Marnie accepted the "Gift", Aneesa was controlled for a brief time and helped Marnie destroy the gift forever with by sealing it in her magic lamp, which was destroyed by Marine, Dylan and Gwen in a slight of hand to make everyone think the Gift was destroyed.

==Trivia==
* Aneesa's room was empty except for the lamp, which could mean she transferred all the furniture into her lamp. This makes some viewers wonder what her home is like.
* Despite genies being magical beings, Aneesa isn't shown using any magic aside from putting things inside her lamp.
* Her outfits are stereotypical genie clothing.
