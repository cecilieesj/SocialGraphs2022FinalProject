{{Quote|The Cow as white as milk.|The [[witch (Into the Woods)|Witch]]}}
'''Milky White''' is Jack's beloved cow who is as white as milk. She is so old that she doesn't produce milk anymore. Jack's mother tells Jack that they have no choice but to sell her. She shares an important role in the musical film, ''[[Into the Woods]]'', and she is one of the four objects needed to break the Witch's curse.
