'''Rosemary''', '''Lavender''', and '''Ginger Flour''' are supporting characters in the [[2019]] television series, ''[[Amphibia]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Being just little tadpoles, Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger are very na√Øve and innocent. They love to play and while they do seek attention, are not malicious about it and simply want to spend time with their sister. They can become quite possessive as they were jealous of Maddie's friendship with Marcy at first and they put themselves in danger just to get her to play with them instead, though this is mostly due to them not understanding that their actions have consequences. They also disliked Marcy until she helped Maddie save them from exploding, and helping Maddie realize that she needs to start making time with her sisters as well. Unlike [[Polly Plantar]] who has a firm grasp of the large world around her, they are mostly content with what they have in front of them and do not have very big goals, though they are willing to resort to drastic measures to get what they want. Ultimately, Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger are very sweet children who just want to be happy.

===Physical appearance===
Being tadpoles, they resemble Polly in that they are small round balls with little nubs for hands and tails that are frilled. Beyond that, there are a couple of visual differences between them. Rosemary is soft teal with three hairs, Lavender is light violet with one hair, and Ginger is soft blue with no hair.

==Trivia==
*Despite the fact that they have clearly been around since before the events of the show and made an appearance in "[[Civil Wart]]", their family ties with Maddie were not revealed until "[[Return to Wartwood]]". However, they were first seen in the show's opening.
*They are all fittingly named after different plants and spices used in baking and cooking.
*Their blue color resembles the blues from the ''Angry Birds'' franchise.
