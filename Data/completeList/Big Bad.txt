'''Big Bad''', or '''Big Bad Wolf''' and real name '''Aloysius''', is a character of the [[2015]] Disney Junior animated television program, ''[[Goldie & Bear]]''. He likes scaring people, stealing, and making as much trouble as he can.

==Role in the series==
Like the traditional Big Bad Wolf, Big Bad enjoys huffing, puffing, and blowing things down, as well as antagonizing the [[Three Little Pigs (Goldie & Bear)|Three Little Pigs]], [[Red (Goldie and Bear)|Little Red Riding Hood]], and other individuals. He is also rude at times and has a large appetite, often taking food without asking.

Big Bad, however, is also depicted as having a conscience and at times being a nice guy. When he accidentally blows down his own house, he stays over at [[Humpty|Humpty Dumpty]]'s place and is a bad houseguest, but later regrets it and makes good. When his brother Phil, once even naughtier than him, comes for a visit, he discovers that he has gone nice. [[Goldie L. Locks|Goldie]] and [[Jack A. Bear|Bear]] show him [[Bein' Nice Is Easy|how]] he too can be nice. In another installment, he swipes the magic dancing shoes given to Bear in the hopes of being able to dance himself, only to show vulnerability when he is forced to admit to his deeds, while also revealing that he was boasting about being a great dancer. 

Big Bad is not really evil and seems more akin to a rather lonely person. In fact, the reason he likes to cause mayhem is possibly just filling up time with rarely any friends to spend time with. 

He is also hungry, with his target being food than really anything else.

He is sensitive about his real name, Aloysius, asking Goldie and Bear not to tell anyone else about it when they discover it.

Surprisingly as revealed in Red Moves Away he was friends with Red's father Murry the muffin man.
