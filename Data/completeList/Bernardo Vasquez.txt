'''Bernardo Vasquez''' is main antagonist in ''[[West Side Story]]''. He is a boxer from [[Puerto Rico]] who leads his gang, the [[Sharks]], against the [[Jets]] for control over the streets of [[New York City]]. 

==Background==

===Personality===
Bernardo is a hardened and tough young man who wishes to achieve the freedom and opportunity that all immigrants desire. Ever since finding himself in less than stellar conditions, he has become cynical and believes that he must forcibly take what he believes is rightfully his. He is very protective of [[Anita (West Side Story)|Anita]] and [[María Vasquez|María]] who are much more optimistic and hopeful than him. While he cares for them deeply, he does not want to risk losing everything and fights against the [[Jets]] for dominance on the streets.

==Trivia==
*Prior to [[David Alvarez]] portraying Bernardo, he was played by five actors. When the original Broadway show opened back in [[1957]], Bernardo was portrayed by Ken LeRoy who reprised the role when the show opened on the West End the year after. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, George Chakiris portrayed him. In the [[1980]] Broadway revival, he was played by Héctor Jaime Mercado, George Akram in the [[2009]] revival, and then by Amar Ramasar in the [[2020]] revival.
