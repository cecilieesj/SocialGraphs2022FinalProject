'''Bessie''' is a minor antagonist in ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''.

==Appearance==
Bessie is possibly a Guernsey, a breed of dairy cow. She has a yellow number tag on her lower right ear. Bessie has tan spots and a light cream body. The hair on the top of her head is slightly darker then her spots.

==Personality==
Bessie appears to be a harmless, sweet, and simple local, but is actually smart and devious. Bessie is shown to be one not to mess with, which [[Dylan]] and [[Dante (101 Dalmatian Street)|Dante]] found out the hard way. She also wants to kill the Dalmatian family, believing them to be annoying city dwellers, only to fail miserably.
