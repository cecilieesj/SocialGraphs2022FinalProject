'''Vampirina "Vee" Hauntley''' is the main protagonist of the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[Vampirina]]''. She is a young vampire whose family moved from Transylvania, [[Romania]] to [[Pennsylvania]] to open a local Scare Bed n' Breakfast.

==Background==
Vampirina used to live in Transylvania with [[Boris Hauntley|her]] [[Oxana Hauntley|parents]], [[Demi]], and [[Gregoria]], where she lived a comfortable life and was popular at school. However, things changed when she and her family moved to Pennsylvania so her mother could achieve her dream of opening a B&B for traveling ghouls and monsters. While Vee was excited about the move, she also felt nervous about fitting in with humans, especially after the B&B scares away the first human they meet, [[Edna Peepleson]]. Luckily, she managed to befriend her new neighbors [[Poppy Peepleson]], [[Edgar Peepleson]], and [[Bridget (Vampirina)|Bridget]]. Poppy soon finds out about her identity as a vampire, but accepts her for her differences, and they become best friends. Bridget later finds out too, and while scared at first, also learns to accept her. Vee keeps her identity a secret from Edgar, however, since he likes to film supernatural things and upload it to his web show, which could prevent Vee and her family from living a quiet life.

===Physical appearance===
Vampirina is a young vampire with periwinkle skin, pointy ears and fangs. Her hair is black with bat wing pigtails and has violet eyes. She dresses in a light magenta top and black dress with a spider web pattern, wears two blue fingerless gloves, and black boots. Even though she appears 8 years old, she is actually 200 years old.

When she is being a Woodchuck Woodsie, she formerly wore her Ghoul Guide uniform although a blue sash was worn to put some badges in "Woodchuck Woodsies". But in "The Woodsie Way", she wore a new, more accurate uniform.

At bedtime, she wears two-tone purple pajamas with a blue ghost on the front. Her sleeves and pajama pants have blue bat patterns all over, and wears purple bat slippers.

===Powers and abilities===
Like all vampires, Vee is very playful and can transform into a bat. However, when she gets shy and nervous she gets a case of the Battys, which is transforming back and forth into a bat uncontrollably. Also like all vampires, Vee can move very fast. She can instantly zoom from one place to another in a second without needing to speed up or slow down. She also has super hearing that makes things far away sound loud and clear. As seen in "[[Vampire Weekend]]", mastering all the abilities of a vampire is challenging, and requires a lot of concentration.

==Trivia==
*Vampirina is based on the titular character from the books by Anne Marie Pace.
*In the episode "[[Two Heads Are Better Than One]]", Vampirina is revealed to be left-handed.
**However, she plays the spookylele right-handed, suggesting she's ambidextrous.
*She is afraid of baby cows and cute things as revealed in "[[Hiccupire]]".
*[[Whoopi Goldberg]] dressed as Vampirina for the Halloween segment of her talk show, ''The View'', in [[2018]].
