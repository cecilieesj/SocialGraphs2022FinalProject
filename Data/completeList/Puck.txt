'''Puck''' is a penguin from the South Pole who comes to visit [[the Big Blue House]] in the ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' episode ''[[A Strange Bird]]''.

Like [[Harry the Duck]], he sometimes quacks, although his quacks tend to be faster and more numerous. He has trouble adjusting to the climate of [[Woodland Valley]] and the Big Blue House, being used to much colder conditions.
