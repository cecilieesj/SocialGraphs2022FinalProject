{{Quote 2|Vega is the brightest star in school, working harder than any other student at Starling Academy. Now that her laser focus has put her at the top of the class, she’s aiming for the stars. Yep, Vega is something of a perfectionist, but she needs to learn to use her instincts and intuitions when it comes to wish-granting. When Vega likes to let loose she seriously glimmers on the dance floor.|Official description}}

'''Vega''' is a character, one of the twelve Star Darling students at Starling Academy and also one of the five main female protagonists in Disney's ''[[Star Darlings]]''.

==Background==
==='''Personality'''===
Vega is reliable, observant, organized, and very focused. However on the other hand of her personality, she can be opinionated about everything, and she can be fussy, sassy, uptight, critical, arrogant, and easily embarrassed. She is the bassist of the Star Darlings band.

== Appearance ==
Vega’s theme color is blue. She is a teenage girl with pale skin, blue eyes, lips, and hair styled in a short bob cut with straight bangs. Her outfit consists of a blue dress with a star design under a dark blue jacket, gray leggings with star designs, and sneakers. Her accessory is her star-charmed belt. 

On Earth, Vega’s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of blue. Her skin also loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same is her star-charmed belt.
