==Personality==
A popular soccer player, and love interest of [[Jessica (Stitch!)|Jessica]], he often acts cool and calm. He bears a secret of acting as a maid to his sisters, and even dresses up in bishoujo-styled outfits for his sisters' enjoyment. Thus, he lives a life similar to [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]]'s, as Yuna is often bullied and forced to do chores by her cousin [[Tigerlily Sakai|Tigerlily]]. His name is obviously a play on "hero man", and he has a pet bulldog named Ronaldo. It is hinted that he and Yuna have feelings for each other since Yuna often saves him from trouble; in the episode "Dorkifier", it was shown that Yuna blushed at him.

==Role in the series==
In "Flute", he, along with the rest of the soccer boys, watch [[Bragg|Flute]] play and admire his skills.

In "Witch", he, along with [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]], Dolores, [[Jessica (Stitch!)|Jessica]], Toriko, and Makiko, go to a scary house to clean up for the holiday. There, they find a book and a box. The book was in Latin, but it was not difficult for Dolores to read it, because she knows this language. In the book it was written not to open the box under any circumstances, because a witch was imprisoned there. However, [[Stitch]] accidentally opens the box and Dolores yells at him for it. At first everything was fine, but then the Witch began to appear and the team runs out of the house. Later, they discover that they forgot Jessica there and want to come back for her, but then she leaves the house and complains that she was forgotten. Dolores had a witch's box open and Jessica asked to close it and then calls Stitch to help her decorate the school for the holiday, which Dolores called unusual for Jessica. Then it turns out that the Witch moved into Jessica and controls her body. They tried to stop her, but fall under her influence and began to dance uncontrollably. Then [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] arrive and they began to think together how to defeat the Witch. Dolores reads in the book that the Witch is afraid of mirrors and using large mirrors, they defeat the Witch and saves Jessica.

In "Elastico 2.0", Jessica comes up with a plan to make herself fall in love with Hiroman. She sees him walking his dog Ronaldo and decides to adopt the dog so that their dogs become friends, and subsequently, according to her plan, Hiroman and Jessica fall in love with each other. Then his dog Ronaldo, who realized that Yuna had been turned into a dog, took Hiroman to a tent where Stitch fought [[Elastico]], who turned Hiroman into a seal for a while.

In "The Petite Queen", he congratulates Toriko on winning the qualifying match for the contest, which causes Jessica to become jealous.

In "King Meega!", he accidentally gets [[Checkers]] and he sits on his head. He becomes a temporary ruler and everyone, on his orders, began to play football, even in a math lesson. Then, when Checkers left, he went to Jessica, who ordered a wedding with Hiroman. However, this was not destined to come true, because Checkers ran away.

In "Ace's Back!", Hiroman was kidnapped by [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]], [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] and [[Reuben]] and the hero [[Ace]] could not do anything and lost the fight, which caused hatred in his direction, because he did not save Hiroman. He was tied up at the top of the tower and Ace and Stitch came to rescue him. Ace was out of sorts and ineffective while Stitch followed Hiroman in an attempt to save him. Then, Ace pulled himself together and helped Stitch save Hiroman.

==Trivia==
[[File:Comedy fight in the cloud.png|thumb|Animation error with Hiroman]]
*Despite not appearing in the episode "Sprout 2.0", he can be seen in the comedic battle cloud. This is probably a continuity error in the animation.
*He named his dog after {{WikipediaLink|Cristiano Ronaldo}}.
