'''Bash and Bella''' are supporting characters from the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Big City Greens]]''. They are a couple of petty criminals who lust for crime and each other.

==Background==
===Personality===
Bash and Bella are an equally cocky couple who get a high off from stealing from banks and jewelry stores. The experience apparently turns them on as they have a habit of making out after every heist. They have little patience and are constantly on the move; trying to get away and head to their next bank job. There is no denying that they care a great deal for one another as they were horrified at the thought of being separated and sometime later became engaged using a wedding ring that they stole.

===Physical appearance===
Bash and Bella are two equally tall people that dress in tight black pants and shirts with a brown belt and grey gloves. Individually, Bash has violet skin and longish blue hair with a slight stubble under his chin while Bella has green-turquoise skin with longish red hair curled at the end, green earrings, red lipstick and a mole under her eye.
