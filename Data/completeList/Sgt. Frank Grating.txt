'''Sgt. Frank Grating ''' is the grouchy police supervisor of [[Miranda Wright]] and [[Bonkers D. Bobcat]] in ''[[Bonkers]]''. He's similar to [[Lucky Piquel]] and the exact opposite of [[Miranda Wright]], in that they have a like/dislike for Toons.

==Personalty==
Just like Lucky, Grating has a bit of hatred for Toons, especially Bonkers who tries to warm up to him. However, in "Cartoon Cornered", he befriends Bonkers' clock after their long adventures in Wacky Toons Studio.
