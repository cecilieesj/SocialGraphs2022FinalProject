}}'''Big D''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[Cars Toons]]'' episode ''[[Mater Private Eye]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Big D is shown to have dark paint on his bodywork, along with having white tires, and a spare tire on his right. However, his livery and eye color are unknown, because his appearance is shown in black and white. He is based on a [[1930]] Duesenberg, which he is apparently named after.

==Role in the [[Cars Toons|series]]==
In ''Mater Private Eye'', Big D is making tires to cars around the country. Little does anyone know that he is actually a falsifier, as the tires are fake, causing blowouts everywhere. At the same time, Big D runs a club called the Carbacabana, having a female singer named Carmen singing for the guests, while one of his henchmen, Clyde, tries to make sure no one is bugged. [[Mia and Tia|Mia]] has also worked at the club, but she gets kidnapped by Big D, and no one knows who did it. [[Mia and Tia|Tia]] is especially upset by the disappearance of her twin sister, and goes to ask private eye [[Mater]] to help find her.

Meanwhile, Big D has held Mia captive at the docks, while his henchmen work on more counterfeit tires. Soon, Mater gets spotted trying to save Mia, and Big D gets a crane to lift Mater up and drop him into the sea. Immediately, the police, led by [[Lightning McQueen]], come to the scene, and Big D orders his workers to stop them. However, Tia rescues Mater, who then swings a crane around and drops a crate of counterfeit tires on Big D. With his crime revealed, the police send Big D to prison.
