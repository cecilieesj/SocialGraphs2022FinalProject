Percy made his debut "[[Jake's Cool New Matey]]". He washed onto [[Pirate Island]] beach on an iceberg. He was on the search for new home for himself and his penguin colony called [[Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon]] located somewhere on Never Land, where it's winter all year round. [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew agreed to help Percy on his search for his new home which was located on the other side of Never Peak Mountain. While on their travel, Percy brought along a statue that [[Captain Hook]] plotted to steal from the sea pups and Percy.

Jake and his friends finally make it to Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon and Percy was thrilled to be in his icy paradise and reviled to his new friend that the statue was a beacon to summon his colony. Hook and his crew confront the little penguin and the puny pirates and demands that hand over the statue, they refuse resulting in a snowball fight between both pirate crews. Hook soon gains the upper hand on Jake and his crew but Hook didn't count on their reinforcement Percy's colony to turn the tide, driving Hook and his crew back to the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]].

Percy reappears in the episode "[[F-F-Frozen Never Land!]]" with [[Neverland|Never Land]] covered with ice and snow it was the perfect time for the little penguin to visit his friends on Pirate Island no sooner then Jake, [[Izzy]], and [[Cubby]] were headed out to Never Land to find the Fire Red Rubies located in Fire Red Rubies Valley that would cure [[Skully]] of his Birdy flue, Percy agreed to assist his friends find the rubies enduring the many trials of a frozen Never Land. Captain Hook also desired the rubies to free the Jolly Roger which was stuck with in the frozen Never Sea.
