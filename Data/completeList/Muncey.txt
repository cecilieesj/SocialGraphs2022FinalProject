==Appearances==
===''[[The New Neighbor]]''===
In ''The New Neighbor'', Donald moves into a new neighborhood, finding that his new neighbor Pete, has a destructive dog, named Muncey. Pete gives Muncey a bone, to which he buries it in Donald's garden, much to Donald's dismay. Later, Donald gets another visit from Pete's dog who sends Donald a note for a favor, which Donald reads, giving enough time for Muncey to steal his dishes.

Donald goes angry until Pete visits again, to have him try what looks like porridge. Donald tries it and likes it at first but coughs it out upon realizing that it was dog food (Pete had told the dog that he eats it). Pete then tells his dog he is too finicky, and this is the last time Muncey is seen in the short.

===''[[Pluto vs. the Watchdog]]''===
He appears in another short, ''Pluto vs. the Watchdog'', where because of [[Pluto]]'s ineptitude at being a watchdog, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] gets a new watchdog. Little does he realize the new dog is part of Pete's plot to rob [[Mickey's House|Mickey's house]].
