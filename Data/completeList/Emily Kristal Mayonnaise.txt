She has a friendly, understanding manner, and tends to get highly into whatever book she reads to the class.

In the final season, she becomes the new girlfriend of Patti's father Chad. At first, Patti was unaware of this until "[[Patti's Dad Dilemma]]" and she's upset and convinced that Emily is trying to take her mother's place. But Patti eventually learns how to deal with it, as Emily and Chad are married in the Disney series finale, "[[Doug's Marriage Madness]]".
