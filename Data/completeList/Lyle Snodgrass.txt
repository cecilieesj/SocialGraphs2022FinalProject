}}'''Lyle Snodgrass''' is a banjo player that appears in ''[[The Fox and the Hound 2]]'' and is the owner of "The Singin' Strays".

He is very absentminded, ignoring and unacknowledging the fact that [[Dixie]] is missing from the group and [[Tod]] and [[Copper]] are present.

==The Fox and the Hound 2==
Eager to play at the fair to impress a talent scout, Lyle makes his dogs: [[Cash]], [[Waylon and Floyd]], and [[Granny Rose]] sing without [[Dixie]], who got into an argument with Cash earlier, and, when she later on, with [[Tod]]'s help, makes sure to send [[Copper]] (her replacement) home by ruining the show, Lyle loses all his hope but when his dogs are able to perform again at a local diner in front of the talent scout with Tod and Copper's help, Lyle and his dogs leave town to go and perform at the Grand Ole Opry.
