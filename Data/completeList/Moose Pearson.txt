'''Margaret Rose "Moose" Pearson''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. She is the daughter of [[Lydia Pearson]] and is [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]]'s little sister. She is a tomboy with a deep voice and boyish behavior.

==Background==
The deep voiced Margaret Rose, or Moose as everyone calls her, was born shortly after her mother [[Lydia Pearson|Lydia]] and sister [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]] moved back to Hazelnut. She earned the nickname Moose after Pepper Ann's friend [[Dieter Liederhosen]] acknowledged a cup of chocolate mousse pudding that was in the hospital room. Growing up, Moose has had very little emotional problems compared to Pepper Ann and typically minds her own business when these things take up the current conflict at hand.

A recurring theme throughout the series is how Moose is viewed by everyone. While she is a girl, a lot of people tend to see her as being too masculine or mistake her for a boy. While this caused major conflict with Pepper Ann, Moose did not seem to mind; eventually getting her to see things her way when she was hanging out with her friends. Moose did however have trouble expressing her feelings and desires and was looked down upon by those who thought it was dumb to have a statue of Evel Knievel built or having her favorite comic book character adapted as a television show. She ultimately feels empowered over being heard out.

Moose' closest friend is an accident prone boy named [[Crash (Pepper Ann)|Crash]] whom even she pays very little attention to. Nevertheless, they share a lot in common such as their love of rollerblading and sports. Moose also had a boyfriend at one point named Sean LaSandre whose mother was once rivals with Lydia. This changed and they managed to clear up a major misunderstanding; allowing the two of them to date one another.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], Moose becomes a veterinarian's assistant. Not much else is known other than that she visits Lydia more often than Pepper Ann.

===Personality===
Moose is the prime definition of a tomboy. While she may be a girl, she is not "girly" and would prefer to keep it that way. Moose tends to be very relaxed and neutral to most situations. A running gag would be Pepper Ann trying to imbue her knowledge onto her, only for her to respond with indifference, either because she does not understand, or she has a better grasp of the situation and is more mature than her older sister. Moose inherited her mother's dominant spirit in fighting for what she believes in. Despite the world working against her, Moose rarely shows signs of giving up and will somehow garner support from those around her. When something displeases her, such as being put in a highly effeminate dress, Moose will usually have a curt response speak very little.

===Physical appearance===
Moose is a small Caucasian girl with brown hair that flows over the sides; apparently giving the impression of being naturally messy. Regardless of her mouth being open or closed, she displays three teeth that stick out; implying that she has lost some. Additionally, she has a slight pinkish blush across her nose. Her usual attire consists of a sea green shirt, red shorts and white sneakers. When skateboarding, she blue kneepads, matching yellow elbow pads and gloves and a helmet with a black 8-ball design on it. 

==Trivia==
*In the Latin American Spanish dub, Moose is voiced by a young boy.
*While somewhat unusual for the time and not outright said, Moose can be seen as the first truly androgynous Disney character. However, the characters still use "she/her" pronouns when referring to her.
