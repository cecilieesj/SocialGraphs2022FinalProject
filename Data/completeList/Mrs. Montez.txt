'''Mrs. Montez''' is one of the supporting characters in the ''[[High School Musical]]'' movies. She is [[Gabriella Montez|Gabriella Montez's]] mother. Not much is known about her husband, Gabriella's dad, except for the fact that he taught Gabriella how to waltz when she was a little girl. She is one of the few characters who instantly approve [[Troy Bolton]] and Gabriella's relationship, unlike her daughter's friends. She apparently moves a lot with her job because it was after she was transferred to [http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico Albuquerque], [[New Mexico]] that her daughter was soon reunited with Troy after they sang together. She also attended the Scholastic Decathlon match between [http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/East_High East High] and [http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/West_High West High] but was forced to leave the room when [[Taylor McKessie]] (Gabriella's best friend) and Gabriella purposely created a stinky chemical reaction in order for Troy and Gabriella to make the callbacks on time. However, she also saw her daughter sing [http://high-school-musical.wikia.com/wiki/Breaking_Free Breaking Free] with Troy right after that and was very proud of her for it. She is also very proud of Gabriella being accepted to Stanford University as seen in [[High School Musical 3]] as they had been talking about it since her daughter was little. However, Gabriella says that it was embarrassing to her that her mother wouldn't stop talking about it.
