[[Louis Prima]], the voice of [[King Louie]] from ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' was supposed to provide the character's voice, but he suffered a massive heart attack in [[1973]] (and died five years later). Therefore, the project of ''Louis the Bear'' was unfortunately scrapped, and eventually became that of a deleted character, though his inspiration was [[Louis Prima]].

His best friends were the mice, [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]] and [[Miss Bianca]], and the little orphan girl, [[Penny (The Rescuers)|Penny]]. He was also a skilled violinist, unicycle rider, and also liked to read, too.
