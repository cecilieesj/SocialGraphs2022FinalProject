}}'''Woimly Filcher''' is an anthropomorphic male cat created by [[William Van Horn]] who is similar to another Disney character, [[Pete]]. He appeared for the first time in the Danish story "Deck Us All!", where he is shown as a close friend of Jones. Nevertheless, this fellowship was not explored in any of Woimly's later stories. Woimly is always smoking a cigar like the original Pete used to do. He became a relatively important rival to Donald Duck. Woimly likes to provoke Donald by showing unbearable arrogance when they are in some contest against each other.
