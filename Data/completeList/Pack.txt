The '''Pack''' are a group of ambitious martial artists and combatants from the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated television series, ''[[Gargoyles]]''.

==Background==
===History===
The Pack was originally rounded up by [[David Xanatos]] to star in an eponymous TV show. However, this was a mere ploy, as Xanatos had ulterior intentions for them. So, when the chance arose, he secretly pitted the Pack against the Manhattan Clan, and consequently, the group turned from TV stars to wanted criminals.

[[Lexington]], [[Brooklyn]], and [[Broadway]] were fans of the show and attended one of their public appearances in Madison Square Garden. After the show Lexington introduced himself to them, Fox asked to meet [[Goliath]] and Lexington convinced a cautious Goliath to meet with them. When he and Lexington did the Pack started to hunt them, the two managed to escape.

The Pack was released from jail by [[Coyote]], Xanatos' robot double. As secretly arranged with Xanatos, [[Fox Xanatos|Fox]] stayed behind and was granted parole in light of that abidance to her prison sentence, making herself their former leader. The remaining pack later had upgrades: Hyena and Jackal were given cybernetic implants, Wolf was genetically spliced, and Dingo was simply given an exo-suit. Although the twins stayed together, Dingo and Wolf went their separate ways. It was revealed that Wolf is a descendant of Hakon. Dingo went back to [[Australia]] to become a real hero when the Matrix fused with his exo-suit.
