[[File:Morty_Williams.jpg|thumb|328px]] '''Morty Williams''' is the host of his own investigative reporting television show named The Morty Williams Show. While he was in his trailer in between filming segments of his show on location at the Smile Away Reformatory School, Candace impersonated him to gain admittance inside the reform school. All of the guards attack a 'Morty Williams' impersonator (cactus, the unnamed dream Sergeant, etc.), eventually hitting Morty as well. ("[[Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!]]") As he and his show only appeared in Candace's dream (which later turned out to be Perry's dream), it is unknown whether or not he and/or his show exists in real life.{{CharacterStub}}
