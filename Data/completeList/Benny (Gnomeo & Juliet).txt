==History==
Benny is [[Gnomeo]]'sÂ best friend, always eager to get involved, especially if it involves winding up the Reds next door. Benny looks up to Gnomeo and always gets involved in the Blues' escapades.

He is inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benvolio Benvolio] and Mercutio, two characters from William Shakespeare's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet Romeo and Juliet]. In Romeo and Juliet, Benvolio tries to stop the fighting, but Benny is actively involved in it. His hat getting chopped off by Tybalt having relations to Mercutio's death in Scene I, Act III.

His enthusiasm and limitations are a dangerous combination, judging by his actions relative to the Terrafirminator. His hat gets chopped off by Tybalt. He's seen dancing in a yellow tutu at the end of the film alongsode a porcelain doll, while his hat is still not present.
