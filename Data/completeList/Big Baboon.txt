== Appearance ==
Big Baboon has a dark-brown body and scruffy tail. His stomach is dark-cream. The palms of his hands are pink, as are his feet and face. He has a long, dark-pink snout and his chin has a few stray hairs sticking out from underneath. Under his eyes are purple wrinkles, and his eyebrows are thick and beige. Around his neck and over his head is a brown-white, fluffy mane.

== Personality ==
Big Baboon has been shown as a somewhat confident leader, though his ideas are not always the best. He is very stubborn, and once his mind is set on something, he will not be persuaded to change his stance unless drastic measures are involved. He is willing to offer information to those who need it, though, like most baboons, he enjoys hurling fruit at others.
