'''Crash''' is a character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Crash is probably one of Davy Jones' fiercest crewmen, showing no mercy or hesitation combat.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Crash has characteristics of sea creatures. He had tendrils sprouting from one eye socket and mandibles in place of his mouth. His right leg was fused with  tentacle and used a sawfish's snout as a sword. He also had tube worms for his hair.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Crash and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Crash struck Will who used his pulley to knock him out unconsciously. Crash and the other crewmen went on the ''Pearl'' was present when Jack Sparrow is negotiating with Davy Jones to settle his debt.

During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Crash watches Maccus, Koleniko, and Clanker playing the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game. He later stood next to Davy Jones just as he orders the surviving crewmen of the ''Edinburgh Trader'' to be executed.

Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Crash and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]]. Just as Crash and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Crash and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. The three manage to fight against him on numerous occasions during the chase just as the motley crew manages to escape from the ''Dutchman'' pirates.

Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' just as Crash fired a cannon on Jack Sparrow's ship to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Crash and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Crash returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Crash and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. He and Ogilvey later wrestle an EITC soldier as Davy Jones walked to his cabin where he would find [[Ian Mercer]] and a group of soldiers.

During battle at the maelstrom, Crash and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men while Jack Sparrow fights against Davy Jones. Throughout the battle, he and [[Ratlin]] manned a cannon. After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Crash and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Crash would later obey the command of Will's duty as the new captain (also causing him to drop his sawfish snout sword). Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.
