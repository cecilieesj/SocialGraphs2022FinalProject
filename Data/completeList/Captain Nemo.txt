'''Captain Nemo''' is the antiheroic deuteragonist in ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.

==Personality and Traits==
Nemo has always been a mysterious character, always tending to keep to himself though he did reveal a few details of his past. He is a brilliant genius, having created the ''Nautilus'' in the middle of the 19th Century, and powered it using a nuclear reactor a century before nuclear energy was discovered.

He willingly attacks ships, but does show guilt even if the crew of the ship belonged to his enemy, "the hated nation."

This remorse is mixed with a burning hate for the fact that the nation who enslaved him previously was responsible for subjecting him to extreme torture in an attempt to learn his scientific knowledge. When he refused, his wife and son were murdered, tortured to death. This haunted Nemo, and fuels his crusade and a desire for revenge.

As Captain of the ''Nautilus'', he maintains a very serious, no-nonsense personality amidst his crew and towards Aronnax and his companions. In his own way, he is also a brave man, personally leading his men into battle against the giant squid and risking his life to destroy it. When his island base comes under attack, he risks being shot at by enemy troops when hurrying to set the explosives that will destroy the base.

He only shows extreme emotion when in solitude, as shown prior to attacking a warship, where he indulges himself in performing on the ship's organ, only to have his playing become more dramatic and erratic.

Nemo loves the ocean and made it his home. He is content to leave the people on the surface to their own desires, at least when he is relaxed.

All his food comes from some form of sea life. He also keeps various preserved samples of various sea creatures and even has a pet sea lion, [[Esmeralda (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea)|Esmeralda]].

==Appearances==
===''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''===
According to the original novel by [[Jules Verne]], Nemo's past is shrouded in mystery with little revealed about his early years. In the film, the earliest known account of his life is that he was originally a slave on the penal colony of Rura Penthe. After escaping, Nemo fled with other refugees to a remote island called Vulcania, where Nemo's ingenuity and scientific knowledge were exercised, including the construction of the submersible vessel, the ''Nautilus''.

After the ''Nautilus'' was constructed, the former prisoners became its crew, with Nemo becoming the Captain. For several months the ''Nautilus'' traveled throughout the oceans, attacking numerous ships. After one such encounter, three survivors arrived aboard the ''Nautilus'', [[Pierre Aronnax|Professor Aronnax]], [[Conseil]], and [[Ned Land]]. Nemo quickly invited Arronax to join him and reluctantly took Conseil and Ned as prisoners. He hoped to use Arronax as an emissary in order to allow Nemo to share his secrets with the world.

The ''Nautilus'' continued its travels across the oceans. Nemo got to know Arronax better and showed him some of his past. Ned continued to irritate Nemo due to his constant attempts to escape.

Eventually, the ''Nautilus'' returned to the Island of Vulcania, only to discover it to have been invaded by soldiers because Ned had secretly released several bottles containing the location of the Island. Nemo decided to prevent the soldiers from finding his secrets and left the ''Nautilus'' to destroy the base. The attempt was successful, but as Nemo re-entered the ''Nautilus'', he was unexpectedly shot in the back. Nemo died shortly after, gaining one last glimpse of the ocean.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Captain Nemo appears in Season 6 of the series, played by [[Faran Tahir]]. His existence in the show was established into Season Five when [[Henry Mills]] and [[Violet Morgan]] find an alternate version of the book where an illustration shows Nemo with the ''Nautilus'', establishing his existence into the Land of Untold Stories.

==Printed Media==

===Comics===
Captain Nemo starred in the comic series ''[[The Adventures of Captain Nemo]]'', which ran for 6 issues, published between 1963 and 1972<ref>https://inducks.org/character.php?c1=date&c=Captain+Nemo&view=4</ref>. They were serialized in the ''[[Walt Disney Comics Digest]]'' and ''Walt Disney's World of Adventures'' publications in the United States.

Nemo was also featured prominently in comic adaptations of ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea''. One was serialized in American newspapers throughout 1954<ref>https://inducks.org/story.php?c=ZT+007</ref> and another was published by Gold Key in 1954<ref>https://inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++614-02</ref>.

===Records===
Several record versions of ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' were made to promote the film, usually accompanied with a picture book. 

In ''The Story of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' from 1963, Nemo's role remained much the same as it was in the film. However, following the fight with the [[Giant Squid (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea)|Giant Squid]], he willingly let the Professor, Conseil, and Ned go, even allowing them to take Esmeralda (named Snoopy in this version) with them<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i5dOo7BRsw</ref>.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==

===[[Disneyland Resort]]===

====20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (walk-through attraction)====
After the success of the original movie, Walt Disney opened [[disney:20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Sea_(Disneyland_attraction)|an exhibit]] in [[disney:Tomorrowland_(Disneyland)|Disneyland's Tomorrowland]] that lasted from 1955 to 1966; showcasing some of the actual interior sets, props and model miniatures used in filming including the submarine sets, ''Nautilus'' models, Vulcania matte paintings, the giant squid puppet and the centrepiece being the saloon room featuring the actual pipe organ Nemo played on during moments of dramatic solitude. When the exhibit was retired, most of the props went into the Walt Disney Archives while the set pieces were most likely dismantled. Three years later, Disneyland's first incarnation of [[disney:The_Haunted_Mansion_(attraction)|The&nbsp;Haunted Mansion]] opened in 1969 and Nemo's organ was brought out of Disney's archives as a repurposed prop. It can be seen in the ghost ballroom scene where right before you move on to the attic scene at the very far end of the room is a ghoulish animatronic playing on that organ. The pipes were changed significantly as they are much taller and straight, but the overall organ is the same base that James Mason played on.

===[[Disneyland Paris]]===

====[[Les Mystères du Nautilus]]====
His face appears in the organ mirror, in [[Les Mystères du Nautilus]], at [[Disneyland Paris]], and voices the approach to the entrance of the ''Nautilus'' when you first enter the attraction.

===[[Tokyo DisneySea]]===
In [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s [[Mysterious Island]], the story is set in an alternate path from the movie where Nemo didn't die, but instead has opened up to the world and allowed visitors to explore [[Vulcania]] in the name of scientific curiosity. He can be heard throughout [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Tokyo DisneySea attraction)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]] and his notes can be found in the queue of [[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]. The [[Nautilus]] is docked in the lagoon.

===[[Walt Disney World Resort]]===

====20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage====
Captain Nemo played a significant role in the [[Walt Disney World]] [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage|attraction based on the film]]. While he was not actually seen, his voice would frequently be heard narrating the journey and speaking to other crew members. He welcomed guests into the ''[[Nautilus]]'' to show them the wonders of the world under the sea. In this attraction, Nemo was voiced by [[Pete Renaday]].

====[[Skipper Canteen]]====
A book by Nemo can be found in [[Skipper Canteen]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]], titled ''The Polar Voyage''. There is an illustration of the Nautilus battling the Giant Squid on a map by [[Mary Oceaneer]].

====[[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Grog Grotto]]====
Captain Nemo's disembodied voice is heard in this bar when the Nautilus drink is ordered.

==Trivia==
*﻿In the original Jules Verne novel, Nemo's fate is never made clear. In fact, an older Nemo actually appeared in a later novel, ''The Mysterious Island'', where he is revealed to have survived the ending of ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and is now the only surviving member of the crew of the ''Nautilus''. He secretly helps a group of stranded Civil War veterans who unknowingly crash a hot air balloon at the home port of the ''Nautilus''.
**﻿Nemo was revealed in ''The Mysterious Island'' to be Indian. His family was killed in an uprising against the British, which explained his disdain for society.
**﻿A few years after the Disney ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' film's release, a non-Disney film adaptation of ''Mysterious Island'' was released, transparently meant to be reminiscent of the earlier film, even quoting part of its theme song as part of its own main theme (composed by Bernard Hermann). Nemo was there played by the Swedish-born actor Herbert Lom.
*[[Robert Newton]] and Gregory Peck were both considered for the role as Captain Nemo.
*Nemo's affiliation with ''[[Jungle Cruise]]'' attractions might be a tribute to artist Harper Goff and legendary special-effects supervisor Bob Mattey who worked on both 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It is also somewhat ironic given Nemo's famous hatred for European colonists and imperialists with the Jungle Cruise revolving around European colonists such as [[Jungle Navigation Company]] and [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]] who Nemo would most likely hate.
*[[Nemo]], the titular character from ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', and [[Nemo (Chip 'n Dale)|Nemo]] from ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' may have been named after Captain Nemo.
*[[Captain Finn]] from ''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'' is based on Captain Nemo.
*In the 2020 [[Topolino]] parody story "19,999 Leagues Under the Sea", [[Goofy]] plays the role of Captain Nemo.
