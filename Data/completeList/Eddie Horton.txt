==Biography==

===Childhood===
Eddie was born sometime in the year X14 to [[Frank Horton]] and [[Mrs. Horton]]. He attended Woxagon Elementary school in the year X21. During first grade, he was one of three kids who did not make fun of Lloyd after he made a fool of himself in front of everyone. Instead he offered Lloyd to sit beside him, starting their long time friendship. It was also where he met [[Douglas McNoggin|Douglas]] and [[Kurt Blobberts|Kurt]], his other two best friends.

During his childhood Eddie was also intrigued about his father's police work and would often ask him about it, to which his father would always say "Aw son, police work is serious work. It ain't for kids."

===Personality===
Eddie has been known to be sarcastic, witty and by far the most charismatic of the group. He often causes peer pressure among his friends and can be considered a bad influence by some, although, it has been shown that Lloyd develops Eddie's personality as, without him, Eddie is brought down to a loner and a dork, more so than before. This implies that Eddie may have deeper insecurities about himself that he uses his ego to mask. Eddie also hates to be called Edward. Eddie is also the only one in the group who isn't afraid to stand up to the more popular kids, even when outnumbered or outmatched (though it doesn’t end well for him). In spite of his mischievous behavior he can show sympathy for others. For instance when they planned a camp out in the episode [[Campout on Zoltan III]] with  their Dads he apologized to Lloyd realizing how his Dad not there anymore. When [[Boomer (Lloyd in Space)]] appointed King in [[Boomer's Secret Life]] and forced to give a unfair sentence of life in prison to a jewel thief (as Gomer originally wanted to sentence the criminal one day of hard labor), Eddie,as shocked as his friends, stated how harshly the punshiment was. Other redeeming qualities  is he really does care for his friends and goes out of his way to help them. In addition he wishes to fight crime like his Dad more so though for credit and what seems fun. 

==Physical Appearance==
Eddie is a tall 13-year-old human with short, wavy orange hair with yellow streaks, and pale Caucasian skin. He wears a blue long sleeve shirt, black shoes, red pants, and a puffy vest.

==Quotes==
*(To Lloyd after being called Edward)? ''"Edward? Why I oughta..."''
*(To Kurt and Lloyd)? ''"You two are pathetic."''
*(To Douglas)? ''"No skullus but I see a few new wrinkles."''
*(To Brittany and the girls) "''Stop right there, you treacherous vixens.''"

==Trivia==
*Even though Eddie does not like being called "Edward", he seems to be okay with Douglas calling him that.
