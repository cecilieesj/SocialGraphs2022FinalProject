[[File:Jagular.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The '''Jagular''' was a legendary feared predator in the [[Hundred Acre Wood|100 Acre Wood]]. In ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', [[Tigger]] was mistaken for a Jagular by [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]], while stuck in the tree. However, no real Jagular has ever been seen. According to Tigger, they supposedly like to collect small animals on nice days, particularly in Spring. An on-screen "Jagular" appeared in ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' episode "[[King of the Beasties]]", in which Tigger boasted to be king so much, that he made a decoy out of [[Rabbit]]'s tablecloth, broom, and pillow. As a result, Rabbit had to teach Tigger a lesson about borrowing without asking. Jagulars were also the main (albeit-unseen) antagonists of the episode [[Invasion of the Pooh Snatcher]], in which Tigger, having heard strange noises, believes a Jagular has kidnapped Pooh from his napping spot and Piglet, whom Tigger warned about the supposed Jagular earlier, believes that Tigger has been snatched by it, leading to Pooh, Gopher and Piglet trying to rescue him while Rabbit and Tigger try to rescue Pooh, leading to both sides saving each other.

==Trivia==
*The Jagular's name must be a play on words combining "Jaguar" with "Jugular." 
*Other than the fake Jagular Tigger built, no Jagular has been seen in the 100 Acre Wood, making it unknown as to what they look like or act like.
