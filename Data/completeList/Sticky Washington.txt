'''George "Sticky" Washington''' is the deuteragonist in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[The Mysterious Benedict Society]]''. He is an overly cautious boy who has the ability to remember everything that he reads and expounds a vast array of knowledge and skills.

==Background==

===Personality===
Sticky is often very anxious. It is implied that he has low self-esteem and is the least confrontational of the kids. However, he is very smart and does display some common sense and decent social skills. He is shown to be more of a follower and is willing to stand behind Reynie and Kate, who are more up-front than him. 

He has discovered that he is pretty brave under pressure, and extremely loyal to his chosen family. 

===Physical Appearance===
Sticky is of African-American descent and is always wearing his round spectacles, even in bed. He is usually wearing a pull over sweater over an undershirt and long pants with nice shoes.

===Abilities===
Sticky possesses an eidetic memory that allows him to memorize everything he reads. He loves to fill his head with various pieces of knowledge that proves to be useful in one form or another. 

He is fluent in Morse Code.  

==Trivia==
*Each of the four children feature a dominant color of some kind. For Sticky, it is the color blue.
*In the original book series, Sticky was noticeably bald; he had shaved his head in an attempt to avoid recognition in public and had trouble growing it back. 
**As well as this, Sticky's parents were alive in the books; their role in the show has been taken up by his Aunt and Uncle.
