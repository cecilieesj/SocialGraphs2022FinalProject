==Background==
===Personality===
Dhandi is proven to be very caring and selfless, not only did she display no hesitation about letting Eden go away for a date with Genie despite having just met her, but she subsequently sacrificed her second wish to save Aladdin and Genie from Abis Mal, despite not having met Aladdin before that confrontation. She was willing to use her third wish to free Eden so she could be with Genie but accidentally wishes for her and Eden to always be together.

==Appearances==
Dhandi appears in only 2 episodes of the Aladdin series, along with her genie Eden. The first episode she appears in is "[[Some Enchanted Genie]]". She is first seen discovering a bottle that contains Eden. Then Eden appears and explains to Dhandi how many wishes she gets and what she can and can't wish for.

The second episode she appears in is "[[The Book of Khartoum]]". She only appears for a short time at the beginning of the episode with Eden.
