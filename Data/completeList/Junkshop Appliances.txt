The '''Junkshop Appliances''' are supporting characters who appear in ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' at [[Elmo St. Peters]]' Parts Shop. They appear during the "[[It's a 'B' Movie]]" song.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]''===
They are a collection of appliances in various states of disrepair picked up by Elmo St. Peters to his parts shop. When [[Lampy]] asks [[Hanging Lamp]] about escaping, which after he responds to the Junkshop Appliances about that, he finds that hilarious. The Junkshop Appliances laugh as well, also finding that hilarious, and then, they, Hanging Lamp, [[Toaster]] and his gang, each make their own protest as an answer to the question, by singing "[[It's a 'B' Movie]]" (including Lampy, who has somehow learned the answer). However, after the main characters rescue their friend [[Radio]] from getting his radio tubes out and about to be sold to [[Zeke]] (returning for them) by Elmo St. Peters by scaring him out unconscious (which was Lampy's idea), the announcer from the Megaphone calls out a jailbreak to the other Junkshop Appliances. Then, the Refrigerator breaks the door open with [[Quadruped]] protecting it, and he and the other Junkshop Appliances escaped from Elmo's private room to the rest of the Parts Shop to the outside of it, and they returned to their masters' homes, as Toaster and his friends retrieve Radio and flee to the city.
