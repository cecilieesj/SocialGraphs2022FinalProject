'''Salty the Parrot''' is a character affiliated with [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] and the [[Disney Cruise Line]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Salty was the pet parrot of [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers|S.E.A.]] member Captain Mary Oceaneer during the late-19th century.  He accompanied Mary on many adventures with Mary even creating miniature scuba suits so Salty could join her underwater.  Salty attended the maiden launch of her RV Oceaneer Lab as-well as assisting her in her treasure-hunting in the Caribbean.

== Appearances ==

=== Oceaneer Labs ===
Salty is portrayed in a large number of portraits and stories at the Oceaneer labs.

=== [[Miss Adventure Falls]] ===
The ship possessed by Mary which ran afoul of [[Typhoon Lagoon]] in this attraction is called the ''M.S. Salty IV''.  This was likely done as an homage to Mary's former pet parrot.

== Trivia ==
* Salty's eyepatch, green feathers and affiliation with piracy in the Caribbean might be an homage to the [[Barker Bird]] from [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]].
