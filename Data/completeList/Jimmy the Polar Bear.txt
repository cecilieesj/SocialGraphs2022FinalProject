'''Jimmy the Polar Bear''' is one of the secondary antagonists in the [[2022]] [[Disney+]] film, ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. He is an anthropomorphic polar bear who works as a notorious [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] character kidnapper and is one of [[Peter Pan (character)|Sweet Pete]]'s henchman, alongside [[Bob the Dwarf]].

==Background==
===Past===
Jimmy used to work as the Coca-Cola Company's mascot to help people sell fresh, well-served sodas. However, he soon swapped to a criminal for unknown reasons. The rest of his backstory is unknown.

===Personality===
Jimmy is a selfish, rude and aggressive photorealistic polar bear that loves making oversized dumpsters of money for Sweet Pete to make copies of bootleg films/catch the Disney foes and apparently sell them on the market just to maleate their faces into the world of ugly. He also helps Sweet Pete turn all the cash into porta-potties.

Despite Jimmy's villainous nature, he is not without redeemable traits as he gets along well his partner [[Bob the Dwarf]] outside of work. He is happen to be a genuine fan of the bear star [[Baloo]]; even briefly stopping for a moment to meet up with Baloo himself at the fan convention.

===Physical appearance===
Jimmy is a tall and slender photorealistic polar bear with a sleeveless ugly red sweater with white snowflakes on it. Rivalling his boss in size. The rest of his body is covered in white fur.

===Powers & Abilities===
Jimmy can make use of his fists to try and stop toons the size of his hand from escaping. He also will make an effort at trying to smash down objects such as doors, windows or wood. He also has sharp claws and needle-like fangs/teeth to attack the toony characters.

==Role in the film==
Jimmy is the polar bear that Sweet Pete sends to capture toons, having kidnapped at least six of them, including [[Flounder]]. Later on, he kidnaps [[Monterey Jack]] (Monty) as well to turn him into a [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] bootleg.

Jimmy then appears in Sweet Pete's office, and releases Chip and Dale from their plastic loop fasteners upon being ordered to do so. When Sweet Pete decides to bootleg a reboot of Rescue Rangers, he calls over Jimmy to try and capture them, leading to the duo escaping into Pete's bathroom. Jimmy makes an attempt to break into the bathroom against his boss's wishes in an attempt to capture the two.

Later, Jimmy goes with Sweet Pete to the spa along with Bob the Viking, and they find the rat nose from Chip and Dale's disguise.

Later on, Jimmy comes with his boss and [[Bob the Dwarf]] to try and capture [[Chip and Dale]] at a convention. Jimmy chases what he believes to be one of the chipmunks, but it turns out to be one of [[Lost Boys|the Lost Boys]]. Later, Sweet Pete finds the chipmunks and Jimmy chases them after Sweet Pete gets tired. He is briefly distracted by [[Baloo]], whom Jimmy is a fan of (due to them both being bears, or he probably grew up watching ''[[The Jungle Book]]''). Eventually, Jimmy chases Chip and Dale through a parking lot, where Jimmy manages to bag Chip.

Jimmy then goes with Pete to his bootlegging factory where he ties up Chip and later [[Ellie Steckler]] after she arrives. After Dale breaks the bootlegging machine, Sweet Pete and Jimmy try to get in and capture them, but they are both bootlegged by the malfunctioning machine. Jimmy is turned into one of the [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Good Fairies]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and flies off. It is revealed in the credits that he was arrested and placed in prison next to Bob.
