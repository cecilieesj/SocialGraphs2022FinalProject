==Role in the [[Jake and the Never Land Pirates|series]]==
As said above, she first appears in the episode, "[[Birds of a Feather (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Birds of a Feather]]". Here, [[Jake (Pirate)|Jake]] and his crew were atop [[Skull Rock]] watching the various parrots flying around socializing. A parrot named Winger meets Skully and asks him if he can help her find [[Skybird Island]]. Skully informs Jake and the crew is off. When they finally reach it, Winger meets the [[Wise Old Parrot]]; ruler of the kingdom. He informs Winger that she is the lost princess of the kingdom. She is crowned and the kingdom begins to rejoice. That all ends when [[Captain Hook]] arrives and tries to make off with her crown. Jake, Skully, and Winger chase after the captain, eventually defeating him and restoring peace to the Sky Bird Kingdom.

In the episode "[[Skybird Island is Falling!]]", Winger and Skully are enjoying each other's company eventually coming to the island's magic golden tree. Skully and Winger learn from the Wise Old Parrot that the island will plummet to the Never Sea without the tree's golden leaves. Winger then watches helplessly as the leaves are stolen by Captain Hook and his pirates. Jake, [[Izzy]], and [[Cubby]] appear to save the island to little avail. Winger and Skully eventually gather the island's natives and attack Hook stealing the leaves back in the process. Although the leaves are back in Winger's possessions, they may not be able to put the leaves back in time. Thankfully, Izzy's [[Pixie Dust|pixie dust]] is able to restore the leaves onto the branches. After the pirates return to Pirate Island, Winger sends a thank you message hoping to see the pirates again soon.

In "[[The Queen of Never Land]]", Winger and the [[Pirate Princess]] received a message from the mysterious Queen of Never Land. They were told that she's leaning towards retirement, and needs a princess to take the throne. They were also told to bring a gift, and she'll decide which will reign. Winger brought and beautiful song, whilst the Pirate Princess used diamonds to make a rainbow light show. However, the Queen was actually Hook in disguise, and the villainous Captain stole the Pirate Princess' diamonds even after his cover was blown. After the two princesses defeated Hook, the diamonds were returned, and Winger road off with the Pirate Princess on the latter's ship.

Winger makes a minor speaking role in "[[Sail Away Treasure]]". She also took part in Jake's birthday celebration with the rest of the Never Land friends in "[[Jake's Birthday Bash!]]"

Winger is mentioned in the episode "[[Who's a Pretty Bird?]]" When Skully receives a mirror as a gift from Winger, the pirate bird can't stop admiring his own reflection causing him to fail in his lookout duties causing [[Bucky (Jake and the Never Land Pirates)|Bucky]] to get tangle within seaweed as Jake and his crew journey to save [[Butterfly Bluff]] from Captain Hook.

Winger makes a brief cameo in the episode "[[Jake's Pirate Swap Meet]]", it is unclear if she sold or purchases anything from the Pirate Swap Meet.

Winger makes a nonspeaking cameo in the episode "[[Smee-erella]]" attending [[Red Jessica]]'s pirate convention she could be seen conversing with Skully. Later the two birds are seen dancing during the pirate waltz.

Winger reappears in the episode "[[Play It Again, Cubby!]]", Jake and his crew learn from the [[Tiki Forest|Tiki Trees]] that Winger may know the rest of the song that stuck in Cubby's head so they set sail to Skybird Island. Winger reveals to her pirate friends that she didn't know the rest of the song but she did suggest they journey to [[Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon]] and ask the penguins if they knew the rest of the song. Winger is last seen singing with Jake and his friends once they uncover the rest of the song in Tiki Forest.

In the episode "[[Princess Power!]]", Winger, accompanied by the Pirate Princess, joins Jake and his crew find the princess treasure. However, only three princesses can have the treasure, Winger and the Pirate Princess make Izzy an honorary princess.
