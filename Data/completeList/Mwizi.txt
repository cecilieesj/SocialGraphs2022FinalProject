Mwizi is a born entertainer, who loves to act. He is a particularly skilled acrobat, and works well with with his fellow crew members. He is also well versed in the art of larceny, and will gladly steal food from others when their guard is let down.

== History ==
=== "[[The Traveling Baboon Show]]" ===
After several [[Pride Animals]] gather together having heard of an amazing group of baboons, Mwizi leaps down to his friend Mwevi and onto his hands to perform a hand stand on him, all the while angering [[Fuli]], who they use as a pedestal. After [[Bunga]] warns them off, another baboon, [[Uroho]], welcomes them all to The Traveling Baboon Show. After a bit of friendly banter and jokes, the show begins, with Mwizi performing some incredible acrobatics and magic tricks with his two friends.

At the end of the performance, the baboons thank the animals for coming. Bunga is left yearning to be part of the group and dashes away to see if they would consider it, prompting [[Kion]] to introduce himself and welcome them to the [[Pride Lands]]. When the baboons discover that he is the son of the king, they become a little nervous, with Uroho telling the cub that they need to rest up for their next performance.

Later, the group start another show, with more animals watching the performance. Mwevi and Mwizi then take their leave, while Uroho begins a magic act. While the pair of acrobats start stealing food from a nearby tree, [[Ono]] catches them in the act, and chases them back to the show. When Mwevi and Mwizi return, they whisper into Uroho's ears about how Ono caught them stealing. In a bid to prevent the egret from telling the truth, the troop grab Ono and start flinging him around. When Ono finally reveals the truth, Uroho assures them that it's not what they think, though Ono also states how he caught Mwevi and Mwizi in the act. Bunga finds it difficult to believe, having been enchanted by their acts, and so [[Beshte]] is ordered to shake the tree. When the stolen food falls down, Uroho announces that the show is over, and the group starts to run.

The troop separate, with Mwizi being pursued by Fuli. But the baboon manages to outsmart her, leaving Fuli to crash on the ground. Along the way, the troop startle a herd of sable antelopes, and, with the [[Lion Guard]] more invested in saving two of the antelopes that have fallen into the water, they soon cross the border into the [[Outlands]], where the Lion Guard cannot follow.

After Uroho's music lures [[Cheezi]] and [[Chungu]] away from outside their den, Mwevi and Mwizi decide to investigate [[Janja's Den]]. They start scavenging, but [[Janja]] soon arrives, and chases them out. They leap over Cheezi and Chungu's heads and pass their leader during their escape. Soon, the three baboons are running from the three hyenas.

The three baboons wind up dizzying the hyenas in a large open space, before Uroho beckons them into a cave. Upon entering, they soon discover that it's a short walk to a dead end, and the hyenas close in on them, with Uroho pushing Mwevi and Mwizi in front of him. The hyenas are stopped suddenly by the Lion Guard, who refuse to let them eat the baboons. After their defeat, Janja warns them to stay away from his den, and Uroho thanks the Guard, admitting that they now feels bad. He asks if there's anything he can do to make up for his actions, and Kion has a suggestion. Back in the Pride Lands, Uroho hands out fruit to the Pride Landers, offering them a show at the same time. When Ono is pushed over towards him by Mwevi, Mwizi and Mwevi continue the show by throwing him around while Uroho takes a bow to the audience.

=== "[[Timon and Pumbaa's Christmas]]" ===
Mwizi, Uroho an Mwevi spot Fuli trying to pick berries from a tree in the Pride Lands. They decide to help her get the berries and asks what they're for. Fuli says that they're for a performance and asks the Traveling Baboon Show if they ever heard of "Christmas." Later that night Bunga and the rest of the Lion Guard gathers other Pride Landers to help them with the performance. However after practicing all night they decide to give up. [[Simba]] then asks Bunga why he is doing this performance. Bunga says that [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] took him in when he was little and gave him everything. So, Simba decides to let the show go on.  The Pride Animals perform "[[The Twelve Ways of Christmas]]." After crying cheers of joy Timon and Pumbaa thanked their friends for the show.{{The Lion King}}
