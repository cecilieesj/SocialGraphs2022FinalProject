===Season One===

====Clashes with surfing====
When Benny hears about the upcoming Hawaii surf competition, he is eager to take part, believing that he is still fit and able and wanting to pursue his passion for surfing. He is disappointed and angry, however, when he is placed into the "Sunset" category, believing that he is being discriminated against for being older.

Benny tries to explain that his age does not define him, but that he has been surfing since he was young and surfing is in his bones. Benny tries to go out to surf with Walter and his friends to prove to the surfing organization that his age doesn't represent his skill. Benny pulls his back, however, and is unable to participate with Walter and his friends.

Shortly after, Benny talks with Kai about surfing, and Benny tells him that he finally thinks it is time to put down his surf board and retire from surfing. Kai convinces him to get back onto the waves, however, citing that surfing doesn't have to be competitive and he can enjoy himself whilst doing it.
