'''Principal Hieronymus Bump''' is the principal of [[Hexside School of Magic and Demonics]] in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''.

==Background==
As all principals of any educational institute, Bump is responsible for the care and maintenance of Hexside as well as the safety and well-being of his students. While he is of a stern and intimidating visage, he takes his responsibilities toward his students seriously and genuinely cares for their success within and beyond Hexside.

===Physical appearance===
Principal Bump is an elderly man with light beige skin, long black hair and brown eyes without his palisman. He wears Frewin, his demon-like palisman as a hat that covers up half of his face to help him see due to his blindness in both his scarred eye and his closed eye. He sports a traditional academic dress consisting of a long black gown with a gold yoke along with a black cape, gold trim at the sleeves and a blue stole.

==Trivia==

*Bump's middle name, "Hieronymus", comes from the painter Hieronymus Bosch whose art style set the aesthetic for ''The Owl House''.
*When the greater basilisk attacked the school in "[[The First Day]]", Bump complained he had "only three hundred years until retirement" as the monster drained his magic. While this suggested that he could live for that long, as stated by [[Dana Terrace]], this was intended to be a joke.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs_4w5hyV2s&t=1h12m06s</ref>
