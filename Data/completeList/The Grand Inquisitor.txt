'''The Grand Inquisitor'''<ref>[http://www.starwars.com/databank/the-grand-inquisitor ''Star Wars Databank''. The Grand Inquisitor]</ref> (simply known as '''The Inquisitor''') is the main antagonist of the first season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He is the leader of the Imperial [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]], a group of dark side agents tasked by [[Darth Vader]] to hunt down the remaining [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]].

==Background==
===Personality===
[[File:Profile - The Grand Inquisitor.png|thumb|left|200px|The Grand Inquisitor was a Pau'an male.]] 
The Grand Inquisitor is described as cold and analytical. His intensity is based on the assignment he is on and he tends to remain calm even on the battlefield.

Driven in his task of hunting and eliminating the Jedi, he appears to have studied the [[Jedi Temple|Coruscant Jedi Temple]] records to an advanced and thorough degree, as he correctly deduced [[Kanan Jarrus]] to have trained under Jedi Master [[Depa Billaba]] after only a few traded blows in their first lightsaber duel, identifying him from the lightsaber form he used and the way he used it. It was later revealed that the Grand Inquisitor was once a Jedi Knight himself, one of the temple guards. As such, upon turning to the dark side and serving the Empire, he was able to complete his task of hunting the surviving [[Jedi]] all the more easily thanks to his former experiences as one of their ranks. It remains unknown whether the Grand Inquisitor chose to join the [[Galactic Empire]] for power's sake, out of fear, or for other reasons.

The Grand Inquisitor appears to have some interest in [[Ezra Bridger]], as a few times during their first encounter, he tried to sway Ezra into following the dark side and shake the boy's faith in his mentor, Kanan. When they met again, the Inquisitor made it clear he desired Ezra as an apprentice. However, in their final encounter, after Ezra had repeatedly refused the Grand Inquisitor's attempts to turn him to the dark side, the Inquisitor struck him down apparently without a second thought.

Being tasked with hunting down and routinely killing innocent Force-sensitive beings, the Grand Inquisitor very rarely showed any mercy and didn't hesitate to kill unarmed children if his assignment called for it. However, with his own fellow Imperial officers he took a stance unlike his master Darth Vader's, never punishing lower-ranking officers for their shortcomings and appearing to accept the burden of responsibility for his own failures. But when ordered by Wilhuff Tarkin to execute Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint, he did so, albeit with a small degree of reluctance.

The Grand Inquisitor is shown to hold a deep respect for his superiors, such as his master, [[Darth Vader]], and [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. Although with Vader, it is founded deeply on fear as the Inquisitor chose to commit suicide rather than face his master's wrath.

As an agent of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Inquisitor is very devoted, but he also proves to be capable of showing respect to those he deemed worthy, as he saluted Kanan in their final duel.

==Appearances==
===''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''===
====Season One====
In the extended cut of "[[Spark of Rebellion]]", The Grand Inquisitor appeared during the opening of the film where he was being instructed by [[Darth Vader]] with a new task. Even though the Jedi have fallen, the Emperor had foreseen a new threat; the Children of the Force. Darth Vader instructed him to hunt down this new enemy and either enlist them or destroy them. The Inquistor appeared at the end, where [[Agent Kallus]] reports his findings of the Rebels and the Jedi [[Kanan Jarrus]] for which he was pleased to hear.

The Grand Inquisitor first encountered the Jedi and Rebels in their attempt to rescue Jedi Master [[Luminara Unduli]], only for Kanan and Ezra to discover her deceased body encased inside a coffin. Catching them off guard, he told Ezra and Kanan that Master Luminara died along with the Republic, but her remains were used to lure the remaining Jedi to their end. As the Inquisitor engaged Kanan in a [[lightsaber]] duel, he recognized his fighting skills from his teachings with Jedi Master [[Depa Billaba]] and began to mock him. He even gave Ezra a choice to join the dark side of the Force as the Jedi were no more and Kanan lacked the ways of the Jedi. Ezra refused the offer and both master and apprentice escaped from their near execution.

When the Rebels attempted to smuggle [[Tseebo]] off Lothal, he led a [[TIE Fighter|TIE fighter]] squadron to stop them from escaping. He piloted the Empire's new [[TIE Advanced v1]] and planted a tracking device on their ship moments before they jumped to hyperspace. The Inquisitor and the Imperials followed the tracking beacon, which was planted on the haul of the [[Phantom (ship)|Phantom]] to the abandoned Republic Base and where Kanan and Ezra lured them away from Tseebo, delivering him into safe hands.

[[File:Gathering Forces 06.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Inquisitor battles Kanan.]]
He led a squadron of [[Stormtroopers]] down to the base and found Kanan and Ezra in connection with the Fyrnocks that inhabited the base. While the Stormtroopers took on the Fyrnocks, the Inquisitor engaged Kanan in a lightsaber duel for the second time. He quickly overpowered him and apprehended his lightsaber. Ezra tried to protect his master by standing in his way, but the Inquisitor just forced him away and began to torment him with his fears of losing everyone he cared about and everything he hoped for, at the same time encouraging him to give into the dark side. Ezra's growing fear turned into hatred against him that he summoned an even larger Fyrnock to attack him. The Inquisitor managed to fight off the beast, but Ezra and Kanan escaped him once again, which he knew Darth Vader would be furious to learn about.

The Inquisitor, along with [[Agent Kallus]] and [[Maketh Tua]], were later visited by [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Grand Moff Tarkin]] who had come to take over the hunt for the Rebels on [[Lothal]]. While holding a meeting in Kallus' office, Tarkin had the Inquisitor execute [[Cumberlayne Aresko|Commandant Aresko]] and [[Myles Grint|Taskmaster Grint]] for their failures to capture the Rebels, which also served as a grim warning to Agent Kallus, Minister Tua, as well to the Inquisitor himself that failure would have merciless consequences from now on. On the night the Rebels made an attempt to hack into the Imperial communications tower, the Inquisitor was sent in and engaged Kanan in a brief lightsaber duel which ended with Kanan's arrest.

During the Rebels rescue mission, The Inquisitor engaged in a duel between both Kanan and Ezra in the reactor room of an [[Imperial Star Destroyer]]. After successfully overpowering and nearly killing Ezra, he invoked the wrath of Kanan, who was able to use Ezra's lightsaber as well as his own to overwhelm The Inquisitor and destroy his lightsaber, which fell into the reactor core below, causing it to burst into flames. Defeated, the Inquisitor committed suicide by falling into the exploding generator, choosing death rather than face the infamous wrath of Darth Vader for his repeated failures.

====Season Two====
[[File:Inquisitor Jedi Guard.png|thumb|left|250px|The Inquisitor when he was still a Jedi Temple Guard.]]
The Grand Inquisitor's only appearance in the second season (and his last appearance in the show overall) was in "[[Shroud of Darkness]]", where he reveals that he was once a Jedi Knight and a Jedi Temple Guard.

Kanan Jarrus encountered the Jedi Temple Guard after he was called into the room he was in. The Jedi Temple Guard told Kanan that Ezra had the seeds of the dark side in him and vows to kill him. Kanan refused to allow this and a duel erupted between them. When the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister arrived, the Jedi Temple Guard alerted Kanan to their arrival. Eventually, Kanan conceded defeat. Instead of striking Kanan down, the Jedi Temple Guard promoted him to the rank of Jedi Knight. The Grand Inquisitor told him he would delay the enemy while the Jedi escaped. The Grand Inquisitor faced the two Inquisitors, who were surprised to see their former superior.

===''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]''===
The Grand Inquisitor makes his live-action debut, along with the [[Fifth Brother]] and several other Inquisitors, in the [[Disney+]] series, ''Obi-Wan Kenobi'', portrayed by Rupert Friend. He leads his fellow in Inquisitors to hunt down [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].

==Printed Media==
===''[[Ahsoka]]''===
The Grand Inquisitor briefly appears at the conclusion of ''Star Wars: Ahsoka'', surveying the damage to the moon of Raada, and contemplating the damage done to the Empire's goals by a [[Ahsoka Tano|lone Jedi]], including the death of his subordinate, the [[Sixth Brother]], before leaving to hunt her and inform Darth Vader of the survival of the unknown Force-wielder.

===[[Marvel Comics]]===
The Grand Inquisitor first appears in Marvel Comics' Darth Vader comic series, his debut being in ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: The Chosen One Part VI''. Vader first encounters him in the Jedi Temple archives, where he duels and easily defeats the Grand Inquisitor. However, before Vader can strike the killing blow, Palpatine stops him, introducing the Grand Inquisitor to Darth Vader and then taking them both to the Industrial District on Coruscant, where the rest of the Inquisitorius have set up headquarters in Palpatine's old lair. The Grand Inquisitor and the rest of his Inquisitorius are then placed under Vader's command to be trained and readied to hunt the few Jedi that survived Order 66.

==Trivia==
*The Inquisitor shares some familiar characteristics to [[Darth Maul]] from ''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'', such as his double-bladed lightsaber. However, his is contained inside a wheel.
*Despite his appearance and role, the Inquisitor is ''not'' a Sith. He is instead what is known as a Dark Jedi.
*When Kanan and Ezra battle The Inquisitor for the last time, the fighting sequence is almost similar to the first Star Wars episode, ''The Phantom Menace'', where Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi fought Darth Maul.
*It was revealed in an interview with [[Dave Filoni]] that the Grand Inquisitor was in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''; "[[Shroud of Darkness]]" clarified that he once served as a Temple Guard for the Jedi Order.
*Dave Filoni revealed in a press conference for [[Twilight of the Apprentice]] that the Grand Inquisitor was in the fifth season finale, "The Wrong Jedi" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', as one of the Jedi Temple Guards that escorted Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Temple and later brought Barriss Offee to trial before Chancellor Palpatine after Anakin Skywalker proved Ahsoka's innocence. According to Filoni, Barriss Offee's betrayal was also the catalyst for the Grand Inquisitor's fall to the Dark side.
*Despite his appearance and contrary to popular belief, the Grand Inquisitor was not a Sith Lord. He plays a role similar to [[Kylo Ren]], being a user of the dark side, but not being a Sith.
*The Grand Inquisitor also shares similar characteristics with [[Thrawn|Grand Admiral Thrawn]]. Both are calm and respectful when it comes to facing their enemies, both are high ranking Imperials despite the Inquisitor's secrecy and both have encountered the Ghost Crew during their times as the main antagonists.
*In the Star Wars Rebels episode, ''Path of the Jedi'', a vision of the Grand Inquisitor demonstrated skill in the technique of Force Choke, as he lifted Ezra by the neck using the Force, implying that the real Inquisitor had such skill. This is also the first instance in the show that the Force Choke technique was used, the second being when Darth Maul throttled the Seventh Sister with the Force in "Twilight of the Apprentice".
