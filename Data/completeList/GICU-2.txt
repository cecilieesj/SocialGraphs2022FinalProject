'''"GICU-2" '''is a security robot character in the TV series ''[[DuckTales]]''. It was created by [[Gyro Gearloose]] and its sole appearance is in ''[[Super DuckTales]]'', specifically the episodes "Frozen Assets" and "Full Metal Duck". 

==Role in the Series==
After having a terrible time keeping his fortune out of the hands of the [[Beagle Boys]], [[Scrooge McDuck]] seeks aid from his inventor friend [[Gyro Gearloose]]. Though busy with his own personal projects, Gyro agrees and builds a security robot capable of disguising itself as a van.

At the grand debut, Gyro initializes GICU-2 and mentions that the machine is now fully automatic, adding that there is no further need for the remote control. However, GICU-2 immediately sees the discarded device as an intruder and destroys it. To make matters worse, it views everyone in sight as a threat, including Scrooge himself.

Gyro looks to make amends by creating a robotic suit, which manages to fall under the control of [[Fenton Crackshell]]. Fenton, as Gizmoduck, reluctantly accepts Scrooge's request to get rid of the rogue robot. Having minimal success, Gizmoduck decides to push all of his buttons as a final resort, causing his suit to balloon out. This makes the perfect target for GICU-2, now having transformed into a crane, to use its wrecking ball on. However, after being launched into the sky, Gizmoduck comes crashing down onto the overzealous menace, destroying it for good.
