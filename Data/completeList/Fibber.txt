He is designed to detect lies; the more individuals lie, the more he buzzes, forcing entire populations to tell the truth. He was captured by [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], but was rescued in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]".

==Background==
===Personality===
Fibber appears to be mute (except when buzzing at a lie) and sometimes blank, but he has displayed emotion on a few occasions. For example, in "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]", when [[Pleakley]] came out wearing a makeshift suit of armor (to protect himself from [[Spike (Lilo & Stitch)|Spike]]'s spines), Fibber heavily frowned in bewilderment. However, when Pleakley managed to convince the other experiments in his E.A.R.W.A.X. group to attempt hugging therapy on each other, Fibber ended up shedding tears and "aww"-ing at the sight of Pleakley hugging Spike. His "aww" is the only time he made a verbal sound other than beeping (although this was drowned out by the other experiments around him also "aww"-ing).

===Physical appearance===
Fibber is a small orange experiment with stubby limbs and a very large head with a dark orange marking on the forehead that glows bright yellow whenever he beeps. His head has little antennae and four ears at the base, a round nose, and black-blue eyes.

===Powers and abilities===
Whenever he hears a lie, Fibber responds by emitting a loud buzzing sound and lights up the pattern on his forehead. The bigger the lie, the louder he beeps, and the brighter his marking glows. 

It should be noted that truths and lies are a matter of perspective, as in what one believes to be true or false. Thus, it can be assumed that if someone spoke of something that they believed to be true (but is actually false), Fibber will most likely not react, since the "truth" is ''believed'' to be true by the individual who spoke it.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 032 was the 32nd genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his lie-detecting ability to force entire civilizations to only ever tell the truth. Based on Jumba's incorrect theory, this would result in a societal collapse. 032 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point after this, Experiment 032 was activated.

An estimated twelve hours after his activation, 032 was captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]] and taken back to the [[Lilo's House|house]], where Lilo tried to look up 032 on [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]]. When [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] himself revealed which experiment it was, Lilo claimed she knew all along, causing 032 to buzz loudly in reply. He buzzed again when Lilo lied to [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] about cleaning her room, making Stitch openly laugh at Lilo's dishonesty.

That night, while Stitch was forced to share his bed with 032, named Fibber, [[Pleakley]] received a call from [[Mrs. Pleakley|his mother]]. She had been badgering her son about seeking a wife in marriage, and revealed to the latter that she'd found him a perfect bride on [[Plorgonar]] and hosted a wedding there. Pleakley felt heartbroken about having to sacrifice his ''[[Pelekai ʻohana|ʻohana]]'' forever, until Lilo and Jumba convinced him to lie his way out. So Pleakley called his mother back and fabricated his sudden engagement, while Fibber kept buzzing.

Shortly after, Pleakley's relatives arrived at the Pelekais' house to witness his sham proposal to Nani (who reluctantly posed as Pleakley's fiancée after Lilo forced her into it). This led to a fake wedding that Nani refused to go through with, so Jumba later took her place by dressing up as a bride. Meanwhile, Lilo and Stitch attempted to hide Fibber in all sorts of places to drown out his frequent buzzing caused by Pleakley lying to his family.

When [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] returned from a spa weekend, he discovered Fibber's recent activation, which [[Reuben|Experiment 625]] deliberately neglected to notify him about. Gantu later crashed the phony ceremony to try and take Fibber but was foiled by Lilo and Stitch, although Gantu managed to divulge the experiment's lie-detecting nature in the process.

Pleakley eventually told his relatives the truth, and while Fibber buzzed at the false comments they made about Pleakley, they were able to accept the fact that he was happy living on Earth and didn't want to get married. However, as Pleakley's family prepared to depart, Gantu reappeared in his [[Manta Shuttle|shuttle]] and captured Fibber. Regardless, Lilo decided to let Fibber stay with Gantu for now.

Back at [[Gantu's Ship|Gantu's ship]], Fibber buzzed when Gantu lied to [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]] about his whereabouts, while Reuben befriended the lie-detecting experiment.

In "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]", Fibber was one of the experiments in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group. He buzzed during the therapy session whenever one of the other experiments lied (mainly [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], when she lied about her being intelligent and falsely accused [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]] of getting them arrested). Earlier, Fibber buzzed when Pleakley denied the fact that his antenna was prematurely orange and simply dyed green. When the other experiments later began to cause chaos, Fibber watched nonchalantly while smiling.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Fibber was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.

In "[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]", Fibber was sent back to Gantu after [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew Hämsterviel's cover to the [[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].

Fibber reappeared in "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", and was freed along with Gantu's other captive experiments by Lilo, Stitch, and several other experiments in a rescue mission.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Fibber was one of the experiments that were gliding on the screen, but he is 580 instead of 032.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Fibber, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Fibber did not participate in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], instead choosing to retreat with the weaker experiments. However, in one scene, Fibber can be seen around some of the Leroys as they started to shut down.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Fibber was first revealed in a DVD bonus feature of ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' in the experiment gallery.
*Fibber was activated off-screen.
*In [[Fibber (episode)|his debut]], it is revealed that Fibber likes cookies, as he was seen raiding the cookie jar at one point.
*In "[[Spike (episode)|Spike]]", Fibber was seen at Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group, but Gantu captured him.
**However, this episode was confirmed by [[Jess Winfield]] to take place chronologically after "[[Snafu (episode)|Snafu]]", considering the fact that [[Nosy]], [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]], and [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]] are also present in Pleakley's E.A.R.W.A.X. group.<ref name="WinfieldTVTome">{{cite web|title=L&S Says Mahalo|url=http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|website=[[wikipedia:TV.com|TV Tome]]|via=Yet Another Lilo & Stitch Fansite|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134719/http://lasfansite.atspace.me/stuff/history/tvtome/page03.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=March 19, 2016|date=December 13, 2004}}</ref>
*In "Snafu", the captive Fibber did not buzz when [[Reuben]] lied about not being ticklish. Since the [[Prison Capsule|containers]] are oddly not soundproof, it is possible that Fibber wasn't paying attention. Arguably, Reuben may have been telling the truth, but is not immune to [[Tickle-Tummy]]'s tickling ability.
*His number was also given to [[Hammerface]] in the English dub of ''[[Stitch!]]''.
*Fibber's head appears in the online game ''[[Jumba's Lab]]''.
