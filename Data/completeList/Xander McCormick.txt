'''Alexander "Xander" McCormick''' is one of the main characters in ''[[BUNK'D]]''. He is [[Emma Ross|Emma]]'s boyfriend and camp counselor at Camp Kikiwaka.

==History==
Xander is handsome and well-known, but despite his exterior image, he does hide insecurities. He loves to write songs and poems, and he also sings and plays the guitar. Additionally, he is a counselor at the summer camp, and he and Emma seem to like each other. He is the head counselor of the Grizzly Cabin.

Xander is an outgoing teenage boy. He is very good at playing guitar. Most think he's the coolest guy in camp. He loves fishing and wishes to open his own guitar shop. Some people think he's the perfect man, but he has some problems. He hides jock itch powder, and wart remover behind a poster. He once got fungus on his foot. Then his toenail fell off and he uses it as a guitar pick.

He had an ex-girlfriend named Amanda as revealed in Gone Girl. After they broke up, Amanda went to acting camp.

It was revealed that Xander has a fake pinky toe in "Luke's Back".

==Physical Appearance==
Xander is thought to be handsome by most of the girl campers. He has slightly tanned skin, brown hair and light blue eyes. He usually wears a necklace around his neck, and also puts gel in his hair. He also likes to wear t-shirts, shorts and also he wears sneakers or flip flops.    

==Relationships==
*[[Emma Ross]] ([[Peyton List]]) - Xander's girlfriend throughout the show. They both care deeply about each other. In [[Welcome to Camp Kikiwaka]], Emma and Xander fell in love with each other. When Emma was going to find Xander in the woods, she got lost and Xander and the others had to go find her and rescue her. They hugged each other when he found her. In [[Gone Girl]], Xander wrote a song for Emma about how he wants to go on a date with her. While on their date Emma was curious about what Xander was doing and thought he was going to kill her. However, Xander explained the whole thing, Emma forgave him, and they hugged. In Counselors Night Off, Emma was suspicious that Xander liked Hazel. Emma stopped them before it was too late, but Xander said that he would never date Hazel, so they had a little argument, but when they realized how they loved each other they began dating and Xander wrote a song for her. In [[Dance in My Pants]], Emma is jealous that Xander and Lou have a thing for each other but she apologizes and Xander and Lou said that they are always friends. Xander asked Emma to the dance and they'd shared their first kiss.  
*[[Ravi Ross]] ([[Karan Brar]]) - One of Xander's close friends throughout the show; they both care about each other.  
*[[Jorge]] - One of Xander's friends in the show.  
*[[Zuri Ross]] ([[Skai Jackson]]) - Xander's good friend in the show; they are protective of each other.  
*[[Tiffany Chen]] - Xander's friend in the show.

==Trivia==
*Xander is an outdoorsman, who is into spelunking, hiking and rock climbing. He is also into fishing. These are the main reasons why he and Emma don't have anything in common, except she is okay with fishing and the main reason why they decide to stay friends. Emma was okay with it, but Xander wasn't. He was hurt and he is still in love with Emma, though she didn't know it at the time.
*Xander is into music, song writing and writing poetry. That is one thing why Emma fell for him and his goodness.
*He has a fake pinky toe and cried the first time he met Eric, a camper from Camp Champion. However, this was because he was ran over by a jet ski.
