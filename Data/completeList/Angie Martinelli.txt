Angie Martinelli is a waitress who works in L&L Automat. During her work she meets the agent of the SSR, Peggy Carter. One day, Peggy sees how a client harasses Angie. Carter tells her to defend but Angie says no because he is a regular client. The next day, the same client harasses Angie. Tired of this, Peggy goes and threatens the client with a fork in his chest. The client lives but this time leaving a good tip.

After Peggy becomes homeless, Angie gets an interview to Peggy with the owner of the Griffith Hotel, Miriam Fry. Eventually, Mrs. Fry accepts Peggy as a new tenant.

Days later, Angie went to Peggy's room to talk, Carter refuses because she had to meet with Jarvis. Angie then decides to leave to Peggy's room. At that time Miriam Fry presents them to [[Dottie Underwood]], the new tenant of the hotel. The next day, a sad Peggy decides to go to L&L Automat. Carter tells Angie that a colleague died and although he was disrespectful to her, he was very good at his job. Angie then listen as Peggy laments the loss of her colleague.
