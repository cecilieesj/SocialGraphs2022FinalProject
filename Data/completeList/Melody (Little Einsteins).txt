== <big>Appearance</big> ==
Melody is a music pet. It is unknown what her age is though it is implied she is a young animal. She is an animal created specifically for music. She is small, a little chubby, stands on her hind feet, has short and stubby paws and feet, has purple fur, purple ears in the shape of flagged eighth notes, has colorful polka dots on her belly and has a white torso. She also has dark blue eyes. 

==Biology==
*Eats music notes
*Jumps
*Walks on hind feet
*Domesticated

== Personality ==
Melody is very innocent and friendly. She takes a liking to the Little Einsteins and bonds with Leo. She can get sad and upset as shown in Melody, the Music Pet, when she is unable to board the pet train and when she has to say goodbye to Leo. She can also get confused, as shown when she doesn't follow Leo until Leo conducts her to follow. She can get scared, as seen throughout Melody and Me, when she gets separated from Leo and blown far away in a hot air balloon. Despite this, she can be brave and stay calm when she knows things will be ok. She is also excitable, as in both episodes she occasionally jumps and sings with a smile when something good happens.
