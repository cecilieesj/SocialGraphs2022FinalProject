==Role in the film==
Burn arrives at the Coates' ranch revealing that Old Yeller is his dog. Although [[Travis Coates|Travis]] is devastated, [[Katie Coates|Katie]] knows she must let Burn take him. As he leaves, however, [[Arliss Coates|Arliss]] explodes in anger, throwing a rock that makes Burn's horse rear and throw him off. He is angry at first but then takes Arliss on his knee and agrees to trade Old Yeller for a horned toad and home-cooked meal, which Katie supplies with pleasure. Upon leaving, he informs Travis that a plague of hydrophobia, or rabies, is affecting local animals, with telltale signs that include staggering, viciousness, and unprovoked attacks. He isn't seen again for the rest of the film afterward.
