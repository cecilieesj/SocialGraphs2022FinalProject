'''Common Sense''' is a character from ''[[How to Catch a Cold]]''.

==Appearance==
Common Sense appears to be a Caucasian human with red hair, who is balding, however, he is very small, about the size of an average human's fist.

He wears a white nightgown, pink slippers, and very large glasses.

==Personality==
He knows a lot about germs and about how to prevent the spread of colds, but also has a few false beliefs about disease, for example he believes that emotions and weather can make you more susceptible to germs.

He is a bit grumpy and persistent, as shown when he snaps at the man for not obeying him or making a mistake out of ignorance or doing something that Common Sense believes will make you sick.

He also seems to be a bit of a worrier, as he thinks the man should stay in bed because his symptoms could be the first symptoms of something serious.
