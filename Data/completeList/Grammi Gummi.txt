'''Grammi Gummi''' is one of the protagonists from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''.

==Background==
Grammi is the matriarch of the [[Gummi Glen]] Gummies. Grammi serves as a mother for the group, cleaning, and cooking (though her cooking can sometimes vary in quality). For a stretch of the series, she is also the only [[Gummi Bears|Gummi Bear]] to know the secret recipe for [[Gummiberry Juice]], which the bears need to bounce. She also seems to have a rivalry with [[Gruffi Gummi|Gruffi]], though the two can work together when it counts.

==Role in the series==
Grammi is part of a small caretaker colony left to protect Gummi Glen after the majority of the Gummi Bears were forced to flee centuries ago. She and the other Gummi Bears later take a role as secret protectors of the nearby kingdom of [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]], after meeting a young page named [[Cavin]].

Grammi usually supplies the Gummiberry Juice that the Gummi Bears use to bounce, being the only bear to know the proper recipe. Because of this, she is sometimes targeted by [[Duke Igthorn]], who desires the juice for its ability to induce super-strength in humans and [[Ogres]]. She later makes an attempt to pass down the recipe to [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], who ignores her lessons until the other bears are captured. Sunni manages to master the recipe, but Grammi still prefers making the Juice herself for now.

In "[[Gummies Just Want to Have Fun]]", it is revealed that Grammi had a childhood leprechaun friend named Nogum. Nogum appears and helps Grammi learn how to have fun again, much to the dismay of the other Gummies. He later invites Grammi to go with him, but Grammi refuses, having realized that she was neglecting her responsibilities at home.

==Trivia==
*During the developmental process, the character was briefly named "Yummi Gummi".
