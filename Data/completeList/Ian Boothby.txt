'''Ian Boothby''' is a character, who appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', portrayed by Jonathan Howard. He is the intern and love interest of [[Darcy Lewis]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Hardly any different from [[Darcy Lewis]], Ian Boothby was a helpful and well-meaning, though eccentric and awkward man. He was also brave, defending his love interest from [[Dark Elves]].

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''====
Ian Boothby is the intern working for [[Jane Foster]] and [[Darcy Lewis]] in [[London]]. He was with Jane and Darcy when they went looking for [[Erik Selvig]] and when they found the gravitational disturbance. After Jane went missing, Darcy and Ian called the police. After Jane returned and [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] took her with him to [[Asgard]], Ian and Darcy left in search of Selvig. They had discovered that he had been arrested and placed in a home for the elderly. When Jane and Thor returned to Earth, Ian helped Jane, Darcy, and Erik set up the devices needed to help combat [[Malekith|Malekith's]] convergence. After Ian saved Darcy's life by killing a Dark Elf with a car, they shared a kiss. They were then transported to Jane and Selvig's side, where they awkwardly addressed each other before [[Mjölnir]] flew by. After Thor defeated Malekith, Darcy and Ian resumed kissing.
