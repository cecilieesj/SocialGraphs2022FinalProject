'''Joseph Johnson''' is one of the characters in ''[[Spooky Buddies]]''. He is the caretaker of the graveyard near [[Warwick]]'s manor.

==Background==
75 years ago, Joseph, along with a mob of the local townsfolk, stormed the manor of Warwick the Warlock in an attempt to rescue his best friend [[Pip (Spooky Buddies)|Pip]]. By the time the mob bursts in, Joseph sees the warlock has captured Pip. The Warlock warns to mob to stay back and retreats up the staircase, but Joseph goes after him. By the time Joseph catches up to Warwick, he finds out the the [[Halloween Hound]] has turned the puppy into stone. Warwick tries to capture Joseph, but the child stomps on his foot. Outside, the dawn is breaking, and the Hound is unable to consume Pip's soul, leaving the ghost trapped in limbo. After Warwick retreats through the mirror, Joseph is saddened by what has happened to his friend and insists that the puppy needs to be changed back. When the sheriff notices Pip's disembodied spirit, he insists that everyone has to leave. Joseph does so, but not before taking Pip's stone vessel with him.

==Role in the film==
75 years later, Joseph would become the caretaker of the graveyard.

After Joseph destroys the crystal, [[Pip (Spooky Buddies)|Pip]] turns back to flesh, and Sniffer, Zelda, Hoot, Pip, and his siblings' souls return to their bodies, while Skip and Rodney are turned back into humans. Pip then returns to his owner and says goodbye to the Buddies before he and Joseph leave.
