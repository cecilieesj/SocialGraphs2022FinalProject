'''Sunspot''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character in the X-Men Cinematic Universe who first appeared in ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' before appearing in ''[[The New Mutants]]''. He is a Brazilian [[Mutants|mutant]] who can become pure solar energy.

Sunspot was created by Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod.
==Background==
===''X-Men: Days of Future Past''===
In the old timeline, Roberto da Costa lived in a terrible future where the [[Sentinel]]s had taken over, and both mutants and humans lived in fear of them. Roberto was part of the last remaining group of [[X-Men (team)|X-Men]] who fought to retain their lives. During the final bout, Roberto gave his all to defend his teammates against the Sentinels, but was overpowered and killed by them.

===''The New Mutants''===
In the new timeline, Roberto had the ideal life for a young man his age and even a nice girlfriend named, Juliana. His solar based powers manifested at a horrible time, resulting in his girlfriend getting incinerated. The event traumatized him and instilled a fear of being close to others. His father, a powerful man, got him the help he needed by sending him away to Dr. [[Cecilia Reyes]] in the hopes of fixing him, though in her case, it is to control his powers more efficiently.

Roberto became somewhat rude and disassociated with his fellow patients; instead he would mock them. However, this was to hide his guilt from the rest of the team. He did seem particularly close to [[Cannonball (Marvel)|Sam Guthrie]] and showed an interest in [[Magik|Illyana Rasputin]]. Eventually, he grew to befriend them, but was frightened of showing his abilities around them due to its ferocity. When the visions that they began seeing became worse, he desperately searched for a way out.

Eventually, the Demon Bear arrived and came for [[Mirage (Marvel)|Danielle Moonstar]] while killing Dr. Reyes. Roberto fled with the rest before Rahne Sinclair snapped some sense into him to fight the entity. Roberto finally overcame his fear of showing his powers and summoned the courage to fully embrace his Sunspot moniker, while also burning off his clothes. After Dani defeated Demon Bear, Roberto accepted his friends and left the hospital with them to an unknown future.

=== Abilities ===
* '''Solar energy''': Roberto has the power to absorb solar energy and produce onto himself. This results in his appearance changing. In ''Days of Future Past'', he resembled the surface of the sun with flare rings emitting from him while in ''The New Mutants'', his body would harden to a solid black molt with his eyes and mouth glowing fire.
* '''Flight''': Roberto has the ability to fly, similar to another fire based hero, the [[Human Torch]].
* '''Energy blasts''': Roberto can fire off fire base energy from his body. This can be done with small fire blasts or long continuous concussive force.

== Trivia ==
* In the comics, Sunspot was of Afro-Brazilian descent. In ''Days of Future Past'', he is portrayed by a tan Mexican actor while in ''The New Mutants'', he is portrayed by a tan Brazilian actor. This inaccuracy was criticized by his creator Bob McLeod who accused the filmmakers of whitewashing.
