|likes = [[Tattypoo]]}}'''The Mayor of Munchkinland''' is the elected official presiding over the [[Munchkins]] in ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''. Though his title is never spoken within the film, it is implicit by his position as the Munchkins' spokesman and leader, possibly by default, and general parallels to the character as depicted in other versions of ''[[w:c:muppet:The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''. He takes offense at the insinuation that the adorable, clean Munchkins are [[w:c:muppet:Rats|rats]]. Like his fellow Munchkins, the mayor adores [[Tattypoo]] and is also easily impressed by fame. Grateful to [[Dorothy Gale]] for freeing his people from [[Evanora the Wicked Witch of the East|the Wicked Witch of the East]], the mayor teaches her [[Calling All Munchkins|the Munchkin song]], which once uttered, will send them "a scampering" to her aid.
