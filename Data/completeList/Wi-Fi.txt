|quote = }}'''Wi-Fi''' is a digital villain from ''[[Mighty Med]]''. He can enter computers by turning molecular structures into their binary counterparts and transfer them to any digital screen.
==History==
He was released from his USB prison by tricking Kaz into entering the command to free him. He then trapped Kaz in the computer and began searching for the Mighty Med central computer, so he could steal all in the information and sell it to all the supervillains (except for Counterfeit who always uses fake money). He also left a virus that began deleting all the information on Oliver's computer, which would also delete Kaz. Oliverand Benny managed to free Kaz, but Wi-Fi arrived and possessedTitanio's armor forcing it to turn on them. After defeating the guards he left and entered the central computer, and began breaking down the firewalls. However he had also reprogrammed Titanio's suit to keep attacking them. Kaz, however, managed to stop the suit and tricked him into entering Horace's computer, then transferred him back to the USB prison.
