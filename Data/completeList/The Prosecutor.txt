'''The Prosecutor''' is a minor antagonist from ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' segment of ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''===
The prosecutor appeared in the trial of [[J. Thaddeus Toad]] when he was accused of having stolen a motorcar.  Determined to have Toad locked up, the prosecutor called upon [[Angus MacBadger]], [[Mole (The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad)|Mole]] and [[Ratty]] to testify only to partially hear them out and frequently cut them off.

Innocent, Toad would call upon his witness of [[Cyril Proudbottom]] to explain that he had traded [[Toad Hall]] for the motorcar with a group of [[Weasels]], not knowing it was stolen.  To prove this claim, Toad called on the witness to the trade in one [[Winkie|Mr. Winkie]], not knowing he was the leader of the weasels.  Winkie lied in court against Toad and this resulted in the judge having Toad locked up.

==Disney Parks==
===''[[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]''===
The prosecutor notably appears twice in this attraction.  He first appears in the courthouse, under the occupation of a judge.  As guests drive through in their motor-cars he declares them guilty of criminal-offence and immediately has them arrested only for them to make a get-away.  Later in the attraction the guests are run over by a train and find themselves in Hell where a demonic version of the prosecutor deems them as being able to return to the living world.
