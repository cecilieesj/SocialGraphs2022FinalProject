'''Jasmine Kang''' is a character in Disney Channel's ''[[I Didn't Do It]]''. She is a main character and is portrayed by [[Piper Curda]]. Jasmine is also [[Logan Watson|Logan]]'s girlfriend.

==Background==
Jasmine is [[Lindy Watson]]'s best friend. Over the years, Lindy was an unpopular girl, but became popular in her high school years. Jasmine helps Lindy stay grounded after her newfound popularity.<ref>[http://ididntdoitnews.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/lindy-watson-character-introduction.html?m=1 Jasmine - Biography]</ref>
===Personality===
Jasmine is a smart, daring, and fashion-forward teenager. She is also always supportive of her four best friends. A fashionista since third grade, Jasmine thrives on good grades, pulling off daring pranks and having the perfect outfit for every occasion. Jasmine rocks her grades, extracurricular and social life all at the same time! Jasmine is a nice girl who cares about people.

===Personality In Depth===
Based on her long string of boyfriends (including Logan, who's her current boyfriend and future husband) and her roles in her friend's situations, it can be said that Jasmine is very charismatic in her actions, although this can be perceived as manipulative to people like Dwight and Garrett. Being sweet, fun, and sympathetic, Jasmine is able to connect with people easier than others, and it doesn't take much to get Jasmine to come to terms with her feelings. However, if in a tough position, she will attempt honest with her peers, but can end up becoming defensive or awkward. It was shown in Bite Club, that Jasmine is quite gullible, because she believed that a guy called Vlad, was a vampire, and believed that he had turned Lindy into a vampire.

Similar to Lindy, Jasmine excels in high school. The episode Slumber Partay shows that Jasmine truly cares about her future. Though it has been speculated by fans that she would go into the fashion career due to her personality and clothing choices, she actually has a specific dream that contrasts that get into medical school. Because medical school requires specific strengths, Jasmine takes classes such as chemistry and physics, and will study avidly to ensure that she succeeds...in which she might sacrifice time with her friends for schoolwork. Even though Jasmine is a sweet and friendly girl, she is shown to also have a bit of an aggressive side to her, considering she was a little like this toward Garrett in Logan Finds Out!,, when she pushed him up to a locker, or in other episodes. Jasmine shows in Drum Beats, Heart Beats that she is a quick learner and learns skills, because she manages to pick up the skill of playing the drums after just two days of lessons.

[[File:Heartbroken_Jasmine.png|thumb|Jasmine almost cries over Logan, showing that she is very sensitive at the heart.]]
Many of these personality traits are from the analysis of episodes, but some of them were formed from her actions toward her current boyfriend, and future husband, Logan Watson. When with their other friends, the two of them interact with humor or teasing, but in the cases when they are alone (in episodes such as Bad News, Lindy Nose Best, If It Tastes Like a Brussels Sprout, Drum Beats, Heart Beats, and The Rescuers), the pair often end up talking with more sympathy towards one another, and romantically towards each other, which benefits the both of them. After fake-dating, parts of various episodes, especially at the end of Next of Pumpkin, can reveal that despite that Jasmine has had other romances, she sees Logan differently than students such as Mike, Dwight, and Owen. (It is shown that Logan also sees Jasmine differently to any other girl he had liked.) Jasmine is shown to be sensitive, like Logan, when it comes to her heart, but not as much as he is, because she had suffered from two heartbreaks - the first time was in Lindy Nose Best, after Jasmine attempted to ask Logan out, but Logan went out with Jenna, after Jasmine and Logan "broke up", which left Jasmine heartbroken. It was shown in Logan Finds Out!, that Jasmine can get quite jealous and get like this quite easily, because she was jealous of Logan dating Erin, because Jasmine wanted Logan to be her boyfriend and not Erin's, even though Logan had already been Jasmine's "boyfriend", before he dated Erin. Jasmine's second heartbreak was in Logan Finds Out!, when she found out that Logan had rekindled with Erin, when Jasmine started to believe she finally actually had a chance with Logan, even though she had already "dated" him. Jasmine even almost cried over Logan, which showed that she does really like him and that Jasmine's feelings for Logan are really strong compared to her feelings she had for any other guy she had dated, especially since Jasmine never stops having feelings for Logan and her heart tells her that he is the guy she should be with. In Drum Beats, Heart Beats, Jasmine and Logan both see each other as the person of their dreams, showing they are in love, almost kiss for the third time, in Jasmine's mind, Logan tells her he loves her, and Jasmine reveals she still has feelings for Logan. Jasmine and Logan both also hint that they could get married in the future when Logan basically proposes to Jasmine...in her mind, saying he wants them to be together, forever. In The Rescuers, Jasmine breaks up with Owen to be with Logan, because she decides she is meant to be with Logan instead of Owen, because Jasmine realizes her love for Logan is too strong for her to not be with him. Jasmine tells Logan she has never stopped liking him, Logan finally tells Jasmine he loves her, they admit their feelings for each other, finally share their first kiss, finally become a couple..."for real", they "get back together", and finally admit they love each other. It is also proven in that episode how much Jasmine and Logan are in love, that they are each other's true love, in love more than ever, and that they are soul-mates, so it is highly possible that Jasmine and Logan will get married and have kids in the near future. In the cut episodes from Season 2, Jasmine wants she and Logan to share lockers as she says every couple on TV does that and Logan is unsure at first. Jasmine and Logan go on a couple of dates, but Jasmine is upset, especially when their date is interrupted when they are just about to share their second kiss. Logan, seeing that his girlfriend is upset, wants to make it up to Jasmine so he puts a bunch of flowers in her locker, much to her surprise. Logan tells Jasmine that they are now sharing his locker, much to Jasmine's happiness and it shows how much Logan truly cares for and loves Jasmine and is willing to do anything to make her happy, whilst calling her his girlfriend. Jasmine, ecstatic, tells Logan that this is fantastic, she kisses his cheek and calls him her greatest boyfriend, which again, shows as well as Drum Beats, Heart Beats and The Rescuers, that Jasmine and Logan are truly in love and could definitely get married in the near future.
