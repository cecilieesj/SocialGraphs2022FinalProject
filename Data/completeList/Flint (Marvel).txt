In ''Avengers Assemble'', He is a teenager who was exposed to Terragenesis, turning him into an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] with the power to control earth, rock, and stone. He was caught in the crossfire of the Inhuman Registration Act, and was later mind-controlled by [[Ultron]], until he was freed from his control by [[Avengers|the Avengers]].

Flint was created by Charles Soule and Joe Madureira.
