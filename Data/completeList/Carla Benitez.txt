'''Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez''' is a minor supporting character in the [[2013]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Monsters University]].''
==Background==

===Personality===
Carla, like all the other monsters, enjoys scaring, but is not sinister or evil. When Monsters, Inc. switched to laugh power, Carla easily switched over to the new format and was open to learning the new method. She is not very well-informed though, as she failed to understand the concept of a knock knock joke. She apparently does not like to lie to children, showing that she is a very moral person.

===Physical appearance===
Carla is a 5'5" monster who is predominantly yellow with an egg shaped body and long limbs and legs. Her feet are purple with three clawed toes, and has four fingered hands that can produce long purple claws. Her arms and stomach have purple lines that run across. She has a purple bob cut, red lipstick with sharp teeth and purple eyes with lashes.

===Powers and abilities===
As her name indicates, Carla has the ability to produce long claws. She does not harm people with them and they are mainly for show.

==Trivia==
*Carla shares her voice actress, [[Alanna Ubach]], with the characters [[Maria]] and [[Cutter]].
*According to her scare card, Carla is 5'5", was born June 24, weighs 108 lbs and hails from Buenos Scaries.
*Carla is apparently much older than she looks, as she has been scaring since Mike and Sulley were in college.
*Carla became a jokester after scoring the highest among Mike's Comedy Class students when they were deployed to collect as much laughter as possible from human kids.
