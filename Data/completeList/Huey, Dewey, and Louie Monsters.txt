'''Huey, Dewey, and Louie Monsters''' are [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] who are transformed into monsters. They get transformed when they fall into the slime along with [[Honker Muddlefoot]]. They eventually revert to normal form when they get hit by the antidote gas.

==Trivia==
*Huey, Dewey, and Louie transformed into three classic Disney monsters: [[Monstro]] for Dewey, [[Maleficent]] in her dragon form for Louie, and [[Chernabog]] for Huey. They still kept their clothes when they fell into the slime (except Huey, who lost his shirt but still has his hat when transformed).
