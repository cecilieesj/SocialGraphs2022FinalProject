'''Thedaâ€‹ Funnie''' (voiced by Becca Lish)<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Doug/Mrs-Theda-Funnie/</ref> [[Doug Funnie|Doug]], [[Judy Funnie|Judy]], and [[Cleopatra Funnie|Dirtbike]]'s mother, generally portrayed as a housewife, but sometimes a working mother too. Her skin is slightly brighter than Doug's, her hair is blue, and is shown to be rather meek and somewhat clumsy but also an outgoing environmentalist.

She doesn't have much sense when it came to naming her second daughter; having actually used "dirt bike" from what was Doug's Christmas list as her first name.
