==Background==
===King Marcus===
Marcus is more easily excited than his wife and has a tendency to be a little dramatic. Like his daughter, he seems to enjoy music the Wee Sprites played in the enchanted garden at his new castle. He seems to have hesitation about baby animals, especially dragons, as pets. He was very grateful that Crackle managed to save the royal jewels from Crispy.

===Queen Cecily===
Queen Cecily is much more regal, calm, and composed than her husband, though it is clear they love each other very much. She cares deeply for her daughter and is glad that she made friends with Sofia, to whom she is grateful for helping Vivian come out of her shell.

==Role in the series==
Queen Cecily first appeared in "[[The Shy Princess]]". She welcomed Princess [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] into their home when the two young princesses were assigned a class art project together.

Cecily and her daughter attended [[Enchancia]]'s jubilee celebration in "[[Baileywhoops]]". They were the last to greeted by [[King Roland II|King Roland]] and [[Queen Miranda]], with the steward Baileywick offering to take her bag for her. When the man suddenly stumbles and falls, Queen Cecily is shocked and concerned for him. Baileywick's clumsiness persists throughout the whole Jubilee timetable, eventually culminating in his decision to retire after he smashes a vase that was a Jubilee gift; Queen Cecily and the other royals are shown to be very upset at this. King Magnus' steward, [[Slickwell]], takes over for the cruise in the Royal Schooner but his own clumsiness results in him spilling the gooseberry cider all over the deck and then sending the schooner on a collision course with some rocks. After they are saved, Sofia presents them with evidence that Slickwell caused Baileywick to become clumsy in order to steal his job. Enraged at this despicable act, Queen Cecily joins the others in advancing on Slickwell and watches with great satisfaction when he is fired and banished from the kingdom. The Jubilee resumes with Baileywick back in charge and Queen Cecily joins everyone in a toast in Baileywick's honor.

In "[[Day of the Sorcerers]]", [[Baron Von Rocha]] (a magical musician who had previously attempted to steal their daughter's musical talent) gets his revenge by taking over their kingdom of Zumaria. Using a Medusa stone, Von Rocha petrifies the king and queen and seizes power. However, he is presumably deposed by the good sorcerers and the kingdom restored to them, as Vivian is seen at Royal Prep later.

In "Forever Royal", Marcus and Cecily attend their daughter's graduation ceremony from Royal Prep.
