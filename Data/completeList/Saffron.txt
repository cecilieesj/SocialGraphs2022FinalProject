|quote = }}'''Saffron''' is a flying horse who first appears in the ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[Minimus is Missing]]", voiced by Kelly Stables. She is [[Princess Amber]]'s flying horse.

==Role in the Series==
She is Princess Amber's flying horse. She was given to Princess Amber by [[King Roland II|Roland]]Â at her request, presumably out of a desire to copy Sofia's success in riding a flying horse. Unlike [[Minimus]], who's a pony, Saffron is a real horse, as shown by her size and the shape of her head.

She first appears with Amber in her saddle while Sofia and James are trying to teach Amber Flying Horsemanship. Amber tries to ride her but has even more trouble than Sofia did when doing so due to both laziness and inexperience. After Amber seizes a lunch break as an excuse to up and quit, Saffron walks up to Minimus, whom she takes an instant liking to. She is later lured to the Hanging Gardens in [[Tangu]] by Wendell's lute.

She finally reappears after the Royal Kids arrive at the Hanging Gardens. After [[Wendell Fidget|Wendell]] is finally defeated and punished by his mother, Amber gets on her and frees her and the other flying horses and successfully flies back to [[Enchancia]] on her using the skills she gained from flying on Opal the Griffin.

She makes her next appearance in the episode, "[[Her Royal Spyness]]". She hoped that Amber and Sofia were taking her and Minimus someplace fun, but ended up flying through the Stormy Triangle several times as the girls searched for their mother. After some Sealions led the group out of the triangle she requested a big bag of kettle corn for flying all the way through the crazy weather.

==Trivia==
*She is the second female flying horse Minimus has met, the first being [[Prince Hugo]]'s flying horse [[Electra (Sofia the First)|Electra]].
*It appears that Saffron likes Minimus.
