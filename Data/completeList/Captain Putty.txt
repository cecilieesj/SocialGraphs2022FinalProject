'''Captain Putty''' is a supporting antagonist in the [[2022]] [[Disney+]] film ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (film)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. He is a Toon police captain of the LA district who is later revealed to be in on the Toon bootlegging scheme.

==Background==

===Personality===
Captain Putty is a short-tempered and dutiful police officer. Being at the top, he takes his job seriously and gets easily agitated when any minor inconvenience stymies him. However, he is revealed to be very manipulative and even mischievous to a certain degree. He is quick to make jokes and poke fun at those who he feels are beneath him, particularly Ellie Steckler for a botched raid, though this is revealed to be the result of Putty misleading her, showing that he has no remorse for his actions and enjoys doing emotional damage to others.

===Physical appearance===
Captain Putty is a stick of grey clay (though he tends to appear as various shades of blue) with big eyes, red eyebrows, a bushy brown mustache, red lips and brown balding hair that he can manipulate into a combover. He wears grey pants, a belt, brown shoes, a white shirt with rolled up sleeves and a black tie. He occasionally wears a tan trench coat and a grey hat.

===Powers and abilities===
Being made of clay, Captain Putty can manipulate his body. He can stretch his limbs, flatten himself, get split apart and reform, and change parts of his body to be other things. He can apparently also remove parts of himself, but immediately regenerates it afterwards.

Like regular clay, he can get frozen and shattered, but can reform once he thaws.

==Trivia==
*Even though Captain Putty is supposed to be stop-motion, or claymation, he is actually a CG animated character emulating the style.
*As a gag, one of the characters refers to him as {{WPS|Gumby}}, the character that served as a partial inspiration for his design.
*Putty was originally going to freeze to death, however they decided to keep him alive as his death would be disturbing to the audience.
