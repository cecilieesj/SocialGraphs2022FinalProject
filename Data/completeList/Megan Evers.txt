'''Megan Evers''' is [[Jim Evers|Jim]] and [[Sara Evers|Sara]]'s daughter, [[Michael Evers|Michael]]'s sister, and one of the two main tritagonists in the [[2003]] comedy ''[[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|The Haunted Mansion]]''.

==Role in the film==
The Evers family is going on a vacation, but they get stuck in the Gracey Manor because of a heavy rainstorm. That night [[Michael Evers|Michael]] is playing with a music box and sees a ghost orb. He and Megan follow it to the attic where they see a picture of [[Elizabeth Henshaw|Elizabeth]], [[Master Gracey|Master Edward Gracey]]'s fiancee, who looks exactly like their mother. [[Ezra]] and [[Emma (The Haunted Mansion)|Emma]] quickly hide them before [[Ramsley]] can catch them. They go with their dad to the mausoleum, where she follows him inside. When they try to leave, the door shuts in front of them and spiders begin crawling on the outside of the door. Michael faces his fear and lets them out. She and Michael get trapped in a box and are hung in the armory hall and Jim fights the knights to save them. In the end, the Evers, [[the Phantom Five]], and [[Madame Leota]] drive off into the sunset.
