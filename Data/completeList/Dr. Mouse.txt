==Appearances==
===''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]''===
He appears in an abandoned ambulance in the desert of Australia. He believes he can find a way to cure Wilbur's broken back, but when it comes to beginning to check his back, he commands his nursemaids to rope him around hanging him and shoot through down his back with a cane. Wilbur is scared but Dr. Mouse tells him he must relax, but he refuses that he would be dead. Dr. Mouse is not convinced so he and his nursemaids put medicine in a needle and shoot Wilbur to make him fall asleep.

While Bianca, Bernard, and Jake went searching for Cody, Wilbur wakes up painfully and saw some kinda like an object on top of his head. Dr. Mouse plans to do something crazy which is now foolishly planning to do operation on Wilbur's back such as a chainsaw which he calls it the epidermal tissue destructor. Wilbur screams in panicky, he escapes out of the hospital but Dr. Mouse and his nursemaids try to stop him. Wilbur hops out the window but he's stuck. Dr. Mouse and his nursemaids pull him back but Wilbur flies down to the floor and accidentally lay down on Dr. Mouse. Wilbur stands up and his back is now cured, except Dr. Mouse.Â His back is damaged as Wilbur's back was. He isn't seen again for the rest of the film.

==Trivia==
*The sequence where the Doctor orders the calibration of the syringes ("range 42!') with the nurses echoing him is identical to Captain Hook aiming a cannon at Peter Pan and Wendy, with the orders repeated by Smee.
