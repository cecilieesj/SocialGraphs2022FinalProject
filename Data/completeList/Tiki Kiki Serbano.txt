'''Tiki Kiki Serbano''' is a character from the [[Adventure Trading Company|''Adventure Trading Company'']].

== History ==
Tiki Kiki Serbano was a woman in the 1930s who along with her sister Rita worked as a talent scout in Polynesia.  Both she and her sister worked to find birds that could perform for the Enchanted Tiki Room with Rita having been significantly more successful than Kiki.  Despite this, Tiki Kiki was the recipricantt of a ''Bird Juju'' from the ''Adventure Trading Company'' for her  observation skills.

In one instance, Rita landed an interview with the bird performer based tabloid, "The Bird Call" much to Kiki's envy.  Due to this, Kiki employed aspiring members of the Adventure Trading Company to assist her in photographing birds around the Adventureland regions.  This notably worked to advance Tiki Kiki's own career with her having even published books such as ''[[Rongo]]'s Rite'' and ''Birds of Song'' by [[1938]].

== Appearances ==

=== Adventure Trading Company ===
Tiki Kiki Serbano was a live-performed character in this attraction where she was involved in guests receiving the Bird Juju.  This mission was completed by finding birds across Disneyland Park and documenting them with the Bird Call magazine for Tiki Kiki's use.

=== [[Skipper Canteen]] ===
Two books authored by Tiki Kiki Serbano are found in [[Alberta Falls]]' library within this restaurant.  These books are titled ''Rongo's Rite'' and ''Birds of Song'' respectively, both alluding to the Enchanted Tiki Room.

== Trivia ==

* It is quite likely that Tiki Kiki is in some way connected to ''Kiki Tiki's Water Play Area'' at [[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort]].  This connection is made more viable given how fellow ''Adventure Trading Company'' character [[Skip Dockmonkey|Skip Documentary]] is prominently featured in the backstory of the nearby ''[[Trader Sam's|Trader Sam's Grog Grotto]]''.
