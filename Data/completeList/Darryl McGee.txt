'''Darryl McGee''' is the tritagonist of the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. He is a 11-year-old Thai-American boy.

==Personality==
Darryl is a bit of a mischief maker, but he's just as well intentioned as the rest of the McGee family (especially his older sister, Molly, who seems to be the only "good influence" willing to put up with him). He's always trying to find ways to help others, though he also tries to be "unethical" about it because he believes rules keep kids from having fun... well, that, and he didn't learn until recently that teachers have feelings like everyone else. In addition to that, he is a bit of an eccentric with a unique view of the world (such as the time he thought the door to the water heater was a gateway to an alternate universe where centipedes are the dominant species), but although his unusual thought process and rebellious nature often gets him in trouble, he never really means any harm; he's just being himself.
