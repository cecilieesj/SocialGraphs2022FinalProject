'''Dragon''' is a minor antagonist of the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]].'' 

She is a cat who loves to destroy toys while patrolling the antique store and looking for any toy which is loose.

==Role in the film==
Dragon is first seen when [[Woody]], [[Bo Peep]], [[Billy, Goat, and Gruff|the sheep]], [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Giggle McDimples]], and [[Ducky and Bunny]] sneak in into the [[Second Chance Antiques]] store. It is implied that Bo had a run in with Dragon as she mentions her to Woody and the others. Buzz thinks they can handle the cat until Giggle McDimples says they can't when they see what she's done to the other half of Doug the stuffed zebra, making Ducky and Bunny wonder if that's how they look on the inside.

[[Duke Caboom]] and Woody later attempt to jump to the shelf to which Dragon is sleeping, to save [[Forky]]. Duke panics and messes up the jump. Woody makes it, but Duke falls to the floor, waking Dragon and distracts her.

==Trivia==
*Counting films as well as shorts, Dragon is the third animal antagonist, the first being [[Scud]], followed by [[Mr. Jones]].
*Dragon is often compared with Scud in terms of the evolution of CGI animation, becoming increasingly realistic over the years.<ref>https://www.altpress.com/news/toy-story-4-cat-animation/</ref>
*She was likely named after the vicious cat of the same name from [[Don Bluth]]'s 1982 animated feature, ''{{WikipediaLink|The Secret of NIMH}}'' and its book version.
*Dragon appears to have realistic features (specifically her eye appearance), making her one of the few characters in a Pixar films to have this feature.
