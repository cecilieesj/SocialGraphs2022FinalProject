'''Santos Gutierrez''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel ]] animated series ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. He is Armando's older brother.
==Background==
===Personality===
The only thing known about Santos's personality so far is that he is arrogant. He keeps insulting Armando during the fair, to they point where Armando gets upset and a huge chaos takes place. Upset, Armando returns home with Santos and Rosario. Elena goes to Armando and explains he only did badly because Santos kept getting under his skin. Hearing this, Armando is encouraged and decides to go back to the fair and fix the mess. Again, Santos gets under his skin by saying that at least he wouldn't be ruining their farm. Good and fed up, Armando stands up for himself saying that the disaster would not have taken place if only he didn't keep insulting him. The next day, Santos is shocked that Armando is giving away free samples of their cheese. However, when Rosario tells Santos that they sold lots of cheese thanks to Armando, Santos finally apologizes to Armando and becomes a nicer person.

===Physical Appearance===
Santos is taller than his brother. He has tan skin and brown hair and eyes.

==Role in the Series==
Santos makes his debut appearance in "[[All Kingdoms Fair]]".

He first appears when he shows up with their mother, Rosario Gutierrez. Santos quickly starts getting on Armando's case by claiming he's on garbage duty. Rosario defends Armando by claiming garbage duty is honest work. Santos however continues to make fun of him by asking what he did wrong this time. Princess Elena and Naomi Turner show up and reveal that Armando is in charge of the Fair. When he sees that his family's stand doesn't have customers, Armando comes over and suggests that they give away free samples too. Santos rudely dismisses his idea and tells Armando to go back to garbage duty. This upsets Armando so much that he wrecks the stand. When his cow Bonita vanishes, Santos blames Armando for this. When he gets her back, he returns to the stand and blames Armando for the fact their stand has no costumers. Elena pulls him aside and tells him to stop doing that. Santos defends his behavior by claiming Armando destroys everything he touches. Elena tells him that's because he keeps upsetting Armando. Santos dismisses this by claiming that Armando is a disaster waiting to happen. This upsets Armando to the point where he accidentally causes a stampede that wrecks the inn. After everything has calmed down, Rosario and Santos take Armando back to the farm. When Armando decides to go back, Santos comes out with Rosario and insults him by stating "Fine. Go. At least he won't be around to wreck the farm again." Armando tells his brother he wouldn't have done so badly if he didn't keep saying he was a disaster and had given him a chance. When Santos scoffs, Armando lists off his successes and tells him that they would have sold cheese today if he had listened to him. Santos turns to his mother and asks "Are you going to let him speak to me like that?!" Instead of repremanding him, Rosario tells Armando she's proud of him, to Santos' chagrin. The next day, Armando is handing out free samples of his family's cheese. Santos comes up and tries to put down Armando yet again, only for Rosario to reveal that thanks to Armando's idea they've sold a lot of cheese. Humbled, Santos apologizes to Armando and pitches in.
