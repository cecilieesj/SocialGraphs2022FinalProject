'''Papa Plane''' is the father of the main character [[Pedro (character)|Pedro]] of the animated short of the segment of the [[1943]] film ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''.

==Background==
Pedro's father is described as a powerful mail plane, who is capable of routining the mail route; however, he cannot do the route whenever he has a cold. He tells his son to be safe when doing the mail route by avoiding [[Aconcagua]].

==Appearances==
===''[[Saludos Amigos]]''===
Papa Plane appears in the segment, ''[[Pedro]]'', where he and his wife are introduced by the narrator. He is then seen when he has a cold, to which he couldn't get the mail, followed by his wife whose oil pressure is high as neither both of Pedro's parents could do the mail route, so [[Pedro (character)|Pedro]] must do the job for them. Just as Pedro's mother teaches her son to be safe, her husband tells his son to avoid going near [[Aconcagua]]

Later that night, Pedro's parents are worried that they couldn't find their son, which is later found out that Pedro survived a terrible storm in Aconcagua and the mail Pedro brought to them is a postcard, making his parents proud as Pedro feels satisfied of his first flight.
