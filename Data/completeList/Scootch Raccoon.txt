==History==
He is rambunctious and bursting with energy and is often seen to run towards people or things yelling "Yahhhh!!!" When Scootch is around, things often tend to get knocked over or broken. Scootch, however, is never intentionally mean, he simply has trouble containing his energy due to his young age. After knocking something or someone over, Scootch will always apologize with the phrase "Sorry, sorry, my fault." (In "[[Strike Up the Band]]", he says this: "Well, What do you know? Not my fault!") Scootch really enjoys playing with blocks, something which he can knock over and then build again. At times, Scootch has shown that he can control himself and not cause any trouble. Scootch and [[Baby Butter Otter|Baby Butter]] often play together. Scootch makes cameo appearances in some episodes.

Like Baby Butter, Scootch's vocabulary is very limited. Though Scootch has proven to speak somewhat more fluently than Butter, he rarely says much more than his catchphrase and almost always speaks in sentence fragments.
