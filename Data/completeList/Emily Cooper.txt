== Role in the film ==
Emily is the star of her school's production of ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''. Unfortunately, she wakes up on the morning of the opening night with a very bad cold that she tries to keep at bay by drinking way too much cough syrup. The excessive use of it causes her to get drunk due to it having alcohol in it, affecting her on-stage performance, and resulting in a stomachache.

== Trivia ==
*In Judith Viorst's original books, Alexander had only two brothers and no sisters at all.
