'''Camila Noceda''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[The Owl House]]''. She is [[Luz Noceda|Luz]]'s mother.

==Background==
Not much of her character is displayed, but she is shown to be a kind and gentle mother, who works as a veterinarian. She always worries about Luz and wants the best for her daughter. She is also naturally compassionate and protective, as she accepted [[Vee]] (despite her initial horror at learning the truth of the basilisk) and continued to allow her to stay with her, commenting on what a strong girl she was. When Luz came out as bisexual to her, Camelia showed nothing but support, and accepted Amity with open arms.

===Physical appearance===
She has dark brown hair tied in a bun and tan skin. Her bangs tuft up similarly to how Luz's do. She wears glasses with a thick red (later yellow) frame on the top. She wears gray studded earrings. By season three, Camila grows out her hair, which becomes curly. Now she has a gray streak. She also starts wearing a heart shaped pride badge after Luz comes out bisexual to her, symbolizing that she supports her daughter's sexuality and relationship with Amity.

==Role in the series==
After [[Luz Noceda|Luz]] caused a deal of trouble with her book report involving snakes and firecrackers, she decided to send her to a Reality Check Summer Camp as punishment. Little did she know that after leaving for work, her daughter would end up in a magical realm and decided to stay for the summer. During her first night on [[The Boiling Isles]], Camila sends Luz a text asking if she is enjoying camp. Luz replies vaguely, stating that she is liking the place so far. Throughout the series, Camila was oblivious to Luz's whereabouts. The reason she never suspect anything was because a basilisk named Vee had taken her form and had been living in her place ever since.

By "[[Yesterday's Lie]]", Camila finds out the truth about where Luz has been and who has been living with her the whole time. At first she was terrified by the fact she had a demon living under her roof, but after seeing how frightened and innocent Vee was, she helped rescue her from a witch obsessed museum manager named Jacob Hopkins. She then offered Vee to continue living with her. She then began to apologize to Luz for trying to change her and burst into sobs upon coming to terms with the fact that her daughter is in possible danger and becomes beyond terrified of what will happen to her in a place such as the Boiling Isles. Luz attempts to reassure her mother that staying there was the best decision she had made, but she accidentally reveals to her mother that she willingly went and stayed in the Demon Realm when she had the chance to go home. Camila immediately jumps to conclusions thinking she was not a good enough mother and only continues to sob as her daughter is being pulled away. Camila then makes Luz promise to stay in the human realm after she returns, and Luz reluctantly agrees. Luz disappears again and Camila returns inside her home.

It is revealed in "[[Reaching Out]]" that Camila is a widow. Her husband, Luz's father, passed away when Luz was very young. On the anniversary of his death, Camila and her daughter would honor his memory by picking flowers for each other, then visit his grave and spend the day together. Camila only appears at the end of the episode, where she puts a single flower in a vase before looking up at the night sky, thinking about her daughter.

At the end of "[[King's Tide]]" she's making soup for Vee when they hear a knock on the door, she opens it and sees her daughter and four real witches in the rain while Luz tearfully says she back.

In "[[Thanks to Them]]", it's revealed that Camila was bullied in high school like Luz, constantly has had to deal with other parents criticizing her only child, and later her husband passed away. It turns out Camila had actually been pressured to send Luz to camp, having actually always loved her daughter's quirks and never wanted to change her.

==Trivia==
*Her name appeared as "Camilia" in the end credits of the first season due to a spelling error that was unable to be changed since it was caught too late. This was fixed in season 2.
*Animal documentaries tend to make Camila cry.
*Camila's usage of the chancla is a famous stereotypical form of discipline used by Latino matriarchs to discipline misbehaved children, but also a form of self-defense of Latino women against threats.
*During the "Be Gay Do Witchcraft Charity Drawathon!" charity stream, an audio recording of Sarah-Nicole Robles in character as Luz revealed Camila is lactose intolerant, like Luz.
