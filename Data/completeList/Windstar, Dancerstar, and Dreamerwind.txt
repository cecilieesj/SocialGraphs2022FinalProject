'''Windstar, Dancerstar, and Dreamerwind''' are characters who appears in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]•[[Pixar]]'s [[2020]] animated feature film, ''[[Soul]]''. They are a trio of mystics who encounter [[Joe Gardner]] and [[22]] in the Astral Plane area, accompanied by [[Moonwind]].

==Background==
Windstar, Dancerstar, and Dreamerwind are three fellow mystics who accompany [[Moonwind]] during his plan to help [[Joe Gardner|Joe]] return to his real self on Earth. According to Moonwind, he explains that every Tuesday, he and his fellow mystics arrive at [[the Astral Plane]]. Whenever it comes to a lost soul being disconnected from life, Moonwind and his fellow mystics cheer up the soul in order to transform the lost soul into a normal soul to make it return to the real world.

==Role in the film==
As [[Joe Gardner|Joe]] and [[22]] arrive at [[the Astral Plane]], the two encounter [[Moonwind]] who introduces himself to him, followed by him introducing Windstar, Dancerstar, and Dreamerwind to the two just as the mystics try to get the lost soul that Moonwind captured back home just as the trio plays instruments near the lost soul, causing the soul's enormous form to disintegrate into the soul of a fund manager which the three mystics transport him back to the manager in the real world just as he thanks the three for saving his life.

Joe asks Moonwind to help him get back to his own body to which he agrees to help Joe return to his real self on board his ship with 22 and the mystics follow along. Joe asks Moonwind's friends to know where Moonwind and his friends' real selves are at, Windstar explains to Joe that he meditates in Palawan, followed by Dancerstar explaining that she plays the Saraswati veena in Tibet while Dreamerwind explains that she is a shamanic healer in Berkeley, California, just before Moonwind explains that his real self is in New York City twirling a sign on the streets. Moonwind explains to Joe and 22 that as mystics, he and the other three meet in the Astral Plane every Tuesday, passing through a group of lost souls. As Moonwind stops at the spot where Joe would go back to his real self, Dreamerwind gives 22 a tambourine just as the three mystics play instruments together while Joe is being taught to focus to know where his body is very patiently. Joe impatiently goes into the real world with 22, causing the two to possess the bodies of [[Mr. Mittens]] and the real Joe respectively, much to the mystics' worry. They are not seen again after that.
