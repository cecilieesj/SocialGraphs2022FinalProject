'''Gertie''' was a deleted character from "[[The Wind in the Willows]]" segment of ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' that was present while it was still being developed as a separate, full-length feature. After the story was condensed to fit the length of a short, her role was given to [[Cyril Proudbottom]].

==Role in the film==
Gertie was the elderly charwoman of the prison which [[Mr. Toad]] got sent to after being framed for stealing the motor car whom the other unruly prisoners constantly made fun of because of her numerous signs of aging. Upon seeing how sad [[Mr. Toad|Toad]] was in prison, Gertie was to have felt sorry for him and attempt to cheer him up by singing a deleted song entitled [[Be a Stout Fellow]]. Eventually, [[Mr. Toad|Toad]] would've been able to pursuade her to lend him her uniform so that he could disguise himself as her and escape jail undetected.

==Trivia==
*Her name may be a reference to Gertie the Dinosaur, an old cartoon character. Likewise to dinosaurs, this particular Gertie is also old, giving this theory more credit.
