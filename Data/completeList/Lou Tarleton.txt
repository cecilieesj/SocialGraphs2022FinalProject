'''Louis "Lou" Tarleton''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who is a major character appearing in ''[[M.O.D.O.K. (TV series)|M.O.D.O.K.]]''. He is the son of the [[M.O.D.O.K.|titular villain]] who is very strange and always trying to get attention.

The character was created by [[Patton Oswalt]] and Jordan Blum.

==Background==
===Personality===
Lou is a very strange kid who is always intrigued by the most random of things. He talks as if he is about to put on a show and appears interested in trying to get someone's attention. He does not want to settle for anything basic and wants to leave an impact on people. It is hinted at various times that deep down he is actually trying to seek comfort or approval from his family and might be hiding his feelings about his parents' impending divorce. Nevertheless, he maintains an optimistic attitude and always appears to be in high spirits regardless of the situation.

===Physical appearance===
Lou is a male version of his mother, he is short for a boy his age and has long curly black hair and tanned brown skin. He is wearing a large blue sweater, light brown shorts, blue socks (one taller than the other), and orange pots.

==Trivia==
*He finds the green M&M attractive and writes erotic poetry about her.
*Lou wears a blue shirt because his voice actor, [[Ben Schwartz]], has a habit of voicing blue characters. He voices [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] in ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'', Sonic the Hedgehog in his self titled film and Leonardo in ''Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''.
**Much of Lou's personality is similar to Dewey Duck.
