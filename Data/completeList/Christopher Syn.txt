==Appearances==
The Scarecrow is the main protagonist in ''[[The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh]]'' episodes of ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''. He also technically a film character, as footage from the mini-series was used for a theatrical release in the UK. This cut is called ''Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow''. 

The Scarecrow was revived many years later for comic book story in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' magazine called ''Enter... the Scarecrow!'', in which he crosses paths with [[Jack Sparrow]]. The scarecrow briefly appears in ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' in the episode "[[Houseghosts]]" while the [[Lonesome Ghosts (characters)|Lonesome Ghosts]] are channel surfing on Mickey's television.
