==History==
He first appears in "[[Headhunters]]", in the biker bar Skull Fracture drinking, where [[Mabel Pines|Mabel]] somehow strikes up a conversation with him. Mabel quickly wins him over with a paper fortune teller and tells him his wife will be pretty, but he worries if she will love him.

He later appears in "[[Summerween]]", where [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] and Mabel's costume and dance bring him to tears and gives the two generous helpings of candy.

==Personality==
The Bats Biker may look gruff and mean, but he appears to have a soft spot for cute things.

==Appearance==
Bats Biker has a grizzled face with a bushy black beard, sideburns, and eyebrows. He appears to be missing teeth, has pierced ears and a scar on the side of his face. He wears a red bandana and is possibly bald. He also has a tattoo on his right arm of a dagger with a banner over it that reads "BATS" which is "STAB" backward. He wears a black shirt that is ripped on the side arms. The tattoo read backward says stab, this makes sense because behind the wording is a knife.
