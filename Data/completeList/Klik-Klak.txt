|status = Active}}'''Klik-Klak''' was a male [[Geonosian]] living on [[Geonosis]] during the reign of the [[Galactic Empire]], two years before the Battle of Yavin. One of the last of his kind, Klik-Klak was the protector of the last remaining Geonosian queen egg, which he had saved in the hope of resurrecting his species after the Empire had wiped them out after they had finished constructing the [[Death Star]]. As such, he was very protective of the egg and had reactivated a small army of battle droids to help guard it.

==Background==
===Biography===
Klik-Klak was first encountered by a team led by [[Saw Gerrera]], whom Klik-Klak's droids wiped out other than Gerrera himself. When the crew of the [[Ghost (starship)|Ghost]] learned of Saw's going missing, [[Ezra Bridger]], [[Sabine Wren]], [[Captain Rex]] and [[Kanan Jarrus]] investigated, eventually finding Saw and then running into Klik-Klak. Following a brief fight and pursuit, the Lothal Rebels came to realize that Klik-Klak was no threat, but rather kind for someone of his species. Klik-Klak also tried to show the Rebels what the Empire had built over Geonosis, drawing a picture of the Death Star, but his meaning was misinterpreted. While exploring the tunnels of Geonosis' subterranean landscape, the Rebels found evidence of the Empire's elimination of the Geonosians, and after an attack by an Imperial cruiser, escaped offworld to inform the galaxy of the horror inflicted upon the planet. Klik-Klak, after some hostilities by Saw Gerrera and the latter's eventual realization that his loss and the Geonosian's were the same, was allowed to escape into the tunnels, where he would attempt to rebuild his race when his queen egg hatched.
