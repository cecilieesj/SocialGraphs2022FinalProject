'''''Black Krrsantan''''', also known as '''Santy''', '''Santo''', '''BK''', and '''Black K''', was a male [[Wookiees|Wookiee]] who appears in ''[[The Book of Boba Fett]]'' and the Marvel Comics Star Wars series. A powerful and ferocious bounty hunter, Black Krrsantan was exiled from his homeworld for disgracing his people, but the reasons for his exile remain unknown. After voluntarily letting himself be taken to the Xonti Brothers, who were slavers who pitted warriors from different alien species across the galaxy against each other for entertainment, Krrsantan gained cybernetic enhancements that made him even more dangerous. During his time as a bounty hunter, Black Krrsantan would work for many notable figures, including [[Jabba the Hutt]], [[Darth Vader]], and [[Aphra]]. He had also fought against many other notable galactic figures, including fellow Wookie, [[Chewbacca]], [[Han Solo]], and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], the last of which left Krrsantan with his notable scar over his left eye. 

Roughly five years after the Battle of Endor, Black Krrsantan was working for the Hutt known as the Twins, who were Jabba's niece and nephew. He was later sent by them to kill Boba Fett, a former ally and ex-bounty hunter who was now the Daimyo of [[Tatooine]]. After a battle in which he nearly killed Boba, Krrsantan was captured and then presented to the hunts, who cast him aside and gave him to Fett as a gift of apology, saying they had been tricked by Mok Shaiz, the mayor of Mos Espa, into attacking him. Boba let Krrsantan go free, and later employed the wookie as a bodyguard when he could not find work.

== Background ==
Black Krrsantan was born on the planet of [[Kashyyyk]], but was exiled from his homeworld at some point due to disgracing his people. When a group of Trandoshans came looking to capture Wookies to sell as slaves to the pit fighters known as the Xonti Brothers, he beat up the slavers and killed all but one and then dragged the survivors back with him to the ship. After being commended by the Xonti Brothers for his impressive attitude and power, they tortured Krrsantan, pitting him against monstrous beasts and other captured fighters, before enhancing him with his permanent cybernetic knuckle dusters and other features. Black Krrsantan swore to make them pay for this put them through the same torment; a life-debt-turned-threat he later made good on years later.  

Krrsantan would later work as a bounty hunter for Jabba the Hutt, at one point attacking the Lars family when he deduced that one of them (the young [[Luke Skywalker]]) was sabotaging Jabba's operations. He then kidnapped and beat Owen Lars to try and draw out the saboteur, only to be met by Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was protecting the Lars family and Luke. Black Krrsantan barely survived the duel, fleeing after Obi-Wan slashed him across the eye with his [[lightsaber]].  

Black Krrsantan later worked for [[Darth Vader]] several times during the Sith Lord's search for Luke, whom he had discovered was his son, and also for Dr. [[Aphra]], whom he turned on multiple times when he discovered she had a bounty on her head, nevertheless, he never tried to kill her, showing he may have had a soft spot for the girl. 

=== Personality ===
Black Krrsantan was a ferocious and unusual Wookiee. He had disgraced his people in the past and had been exiled for unknown reasons. He was not above turning on allies when said allies had a price on their heads. He could be cowardly at times, as he fled in fear after being slashed across the eye by Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, he could be loyal at times, though this loyalty wavered constantly depending on who he worked for and the conditions therein. Krrsantan also hated losing, such as when he was losing in battle against the stronger Chewbacca, and had to resort to trickery in order to defeat Chewie in combat. Like most Wookiees, Krrsantan ''loathed'' Trandoshans due to the fact they often tried to enslave his people, and he was extremely violent in a fight. He also held no personal grudges against other bounty hunters he might fight beside one minute and then betray another time, such as Boba Fett. Likewise, Boba Fett had no grudge against Black Krrsantan, and let him go free after the Hutts sent the Wookiee to assassinate him before casting the captured Krrsantan aside like a broken tool. Krrsantan later was offered as position as on of Boba's enforcers, which Krrsantan, who was having trouble finding work, gladly agreed to.

Black Krrsantan was working for the Twins, the niece and nephew of Jabba the Hutt at this time, and was present as his employers' enforcer when they had come to stake their claim to Tatooine when Boba Fett had taken over as Daimyo of the planet. Krrsantan eyed Fett warily during the conversation between his masters and Fett, and left with the Hutts afterward.  

Later, under the manipulation of Mok Shaiz, the Ithorian who served as the mayor of Mos Espa, Black Krrsantan attacked Boba Fett in his bacta chamber, ripping him out of the tank of healing fluid before beating on him with his cybernetic knuckle dusters. Fett fought back, stabbing the Wookiee in the back and trying to punch him in the face as Krrsantan tried to squeeze him to death, only for the Wookie to bite him. Boba's new street gang and his Gamorrean guards all took on Krrsantan, but the wookie held them off, even brutally wounding one of the Gamorreans by biting him in the neck. Ultimately, it was Fennec Shand's intervention that saved the day, and she used a trick shot to drop Krrsantan into the empty rancor pit, capturing him. 

Krrsantan was later presented by Boba to the Twins, who gave him to Fett as a gift since he was a failure and no more use to them. While Fett kept their other gift as an apology, a [[Rancor|rancor]], Boba released Krrsantan, telling the Wookiee bounty hunter that he was better off not working for scum like the Hutts, who cared nothing about him. Krrsantan, confused but glad to be free, shared a final glance with Boba before running off.  

Boba Fett later found Black Krrsantan at Garsa Fwip's cantina, The Sanctuary, where Krrsantan, after having had too much to drink, attacked a Trandoshan from one of Tatooine's crime families. though Garsa herself tried to calm the Wookiee down by mentioning how famous he was, the Wookiee still ripped off the Trandoshan's arm. Fett them went to talk with Krrsantan, and offered him employment as one of Boba's enforcers, which the Wookiee gladly accepted. Black Krrsantan was later present when Boba convinced the crime families of Tatooine to remain neutral in his war against the Pyke Syndicate.
