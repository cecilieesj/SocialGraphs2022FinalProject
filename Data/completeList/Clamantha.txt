==Background==
Clamantha is the head cheerleader of the Freshwater High Cheerleading Squad. She is very optimistic about everything. According to her Fishbook profile, she spends most of her time memorizing the cheerleading choreography. But she was once shown being a cheerleader. She enjoys spending time with her friends and "chasing Oscar", her crush. She has a shrine dedicated Oscar in her locker, and Oscar has one dedicated to Bea. She is seen many times trying to pretend to be somebody else, usually trying to trick somebody, and always gets caught sooner or later. She is also very childlike as shown by the fact that her door is covered in unicorns and rainbows, while her room is full of dolls including the giant one that makes up her bed. She is also very violent at times such as when "Webster" stopped talking to her she assumed he hated her and broke her heart causing him to break him entirely by throwing him out of the tank. Clamantha also tends to be dumb and stupid as seen in many episodes. Clamantha also is a little disgusting and doesn't have any manners, like in the cafeteria. Clamantha also can be clueless. Her voice sounds very naingy, to the point where she's a terrible singer.
