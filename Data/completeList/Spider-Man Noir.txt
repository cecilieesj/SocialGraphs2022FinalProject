He appears as a supporting character in the five-part "Spider-Verse" arc in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Milo Ventimiglia]].
==Appearances==
===''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''===
In part two of ''The Spider-Verse'', the [[Green Goblin]] decides to draw Spider-Man Noir out by causing a police chase through the city. When he caught up with the Goblin, Spider-Man Noir assumed he was someone in a costume but he was very real. The two got into a brief scuffle in the midst of the car chase after the Goblin blasted him off then Spider-Man rescued him.

===''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''===
While Spider-Man Noir doesn't appear in the film, he is referenced, via Peter's costume. while in Europe, Peter finds himself without his usual costume, so he adopts a black costume (referred to Ned Leeds as Night Monkey) in order to preserve his secret identity. Eventually, he manages to get his usual costume back, discarding the "Night Monkey" persona.

== Trivia ==
* Spider-Man Noir also appears in the 2018 computer-animated film ''Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, ''voiced by [[Nicolas Cage]]. However, it is completely unassociated with Disney, being purely a [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] project.
* In the episode "Emperor Doom" of [[Avengers Assemble|''Avengers Assemble'']]'', ''[[Doctor Doom]] utilizes a time machine to prevent the origins of the [[Avengers]] sans [[Thor Odinson|Thor]], thus making it easier for him to conquer the world. In the future where Doom is now the Emperor of Earth, a resistance group of heroes called the [[Defenders (team)|Defenders fight]] against Doom's oppressive rule, consisting of [[Hawkeye|Bullseye]], [[Sam Wilson|Snap]], and '''Slinger'''. Slinger is this timeline's version of Peter Parker, who wears a stealthy black-grey uniform, modeled after Spider-Man Noir's costume. Despite this, he is still a teenager like his normal counterpart, voiced by [[Drake Bell]].
