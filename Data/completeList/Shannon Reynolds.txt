'''Shannon Reynolds''' is a character on ''[[Raven's Home]]'' and makes her only appearance in "[[You're Gonna Get It]]". She is portrayed by Lexi Underwood.

==History==
Wanting the eighth graders to be allowed to attend a climate change rally for next month, Shannon starts a petition. She asks [[Nia Baxter-Carter|Nia]] and [[Tess]] to help her by signing it, not realizing they are sixth graders. She compliments Nia on her eye shadow and asks her to show her how she did so, by meeting her in the bathroom. Shannon comments on how cool [[Raven Baxter|Nia's mom]] must be, to let her do makeup, though Nia makes it clear, her mom doesn't want her to do so. She invites the two girls to join her and her friends, though is later forced to cancel her plans when she finds that the coffee shop is closed. Upon hearing this Nia, volunteers the roofdeck of her apartment, to which Shannon happily accepts. She later arrives, along with many of her other classmates from school, but they are later kicked out by Raven, who was unaware Nia was throwing a party or wearing makeup.

==Trivia==
*Shannon is in the 8th grade.
*She and her friends like to meet up in a coffee shop.
