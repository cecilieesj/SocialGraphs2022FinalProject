'''Bridget''' is the tritagonist in Disney Junior's ''[[Vampirina]]''. She is one of [[Vampirina Hauntley|Vampirina's]] friends in [[Pennsylvania]]. She is the second human to learn about Vampirina's true nature, after [[Poppy Peepleson|Poppy]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Similar to [[Edna Peepleson]], Bridget can be somewhat cowardly because she gets easily scared from monsters she never seen. She is also smart, funny, kind, friendly, but also, shy as she gets scared from getting in front of people. She is very sensitive to loud noises and bright, flashing light things that the Scare B&B is full of. She is creative, but her imagination can also get the better of her.

===Physical appearance===
Bridget is a tall girl (apparently the same age as Poppy and Vampirina, eight-years-old) and has orange hair which worn in a ponytail. She has fair skin and blue eyes. She wears a pink shirt, pink glasses, purple sleeves, a yellow skirt, blue leggings, and pink and white sneakers.

== Trivia ==
* Even though she is wearing pink and Vampirina doesn't like that color, Vampirina doesn't really care about her outfit.
*In "[[Scare-itage Day]]", it is revealed that Bridget's family heritage came from Ireland.
*In "[[Double Double Halloween Trouble]]", Bridget is revealed to be a quarter Jewish given that she celebrates Christmas and Hanukkah.
