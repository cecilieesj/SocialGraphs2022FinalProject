She is [[Princess Elena]], [[Princess Isabel]], and [[Chancellor Esteban]]'s maternal grandmother.

==Personality==
As Elena points out, Luisa is an optimist who always looks on the bright side of things. However, this is never to the point of being naive, for she has a very sharp attention to detail. She is also revealed to be an excellent cook and to have a dislike for being kept in the dark. She is also more open-minded than her husband and grandson. Luisa showed her tough and competitive side when she trained her Olaball team because she was determined to win, going a bit overboard in the process. She is also very protective of her family and will spring to their defense instantly; when she learned that Lord Elrod had purposefully injured her daughter Queen Lucia in a fencing tournament years prior, she was furious enough to threaten him with a duel. However, like Elena, she isn't the most reasonable of his family, as she couldn't forgive Esteban for causing Shuriki to attack them and did not see that Esteban had changed for the better slide and along with Elena and Naomi sentenced Esteban to exile, with Luisa believing he was too easy on Esteban.

==Appearances==
===''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]''===
Luisa appears in the special, ''Elena and the Secret of Avalor''. When the sorceress Shuriki attacked the Kingdom of Avalor and killed [[King Raul and Queen Lucia]], [[Alacazar]], the Royal Sorcerer, decided to keep the surviving members of the Royal Family safe by placing her, her husband Francisco, and her youngest granddaughter Princess Isabel inside an Enchanted Painting while her eldest granddaughter Crown Princess Elena faced Shuriki alone to buy him time. They succeeded and the three of them were placed inside the painting where they would remain for forty-one years until Elena finally let them out and defeats Shuriki.

===''[[Elena of Avalor]]''===
In the series that serves as the special's sequel, Luisa appears as a major character. She is a member of the Grand Council, who was chosen by Elena for her optimism. Through the show, Luisa, along with her husband, assists Elena in her journey to becoming Queen.

During Season 2, upon learning of Shuriki's return, she agrees with Esteban, Naomi, and Francisco with keeping Elena in the Royal Palace under heavy guard from Gabe and the Royal Guards for her own protection. Gabe maintains this even when Luisa is away on a diplomatic visit to a neighboring kingdom with Francisco and Esteban.

Later, she and Francisco are happy to hear that Isabel is starting her weekly classes at the Avalor Science Academy with Professor Ochoa and wish her good luck, but Elena is hesitant to let her go alone, to the point she wants to send a detachment of the Royal Guards to protect Isabel, but Luisa shoots down that idea, convincing Elena to just go herself.

In the "[[Song of the Sirenas]]", Luisa joins her family as they travel to Nueva Vista for summer vacation. However, on the way, Naomi's parents spot Sirenas in the water and attack them before Elena intervenes, citing that they had attacked the Sirenas before they had shown any intent to provoke the attack in the first place. Once in Nueva Vista, they meet up with Duke Cristobal, who had already set up the city to host a parade to celebrate Elena's victory over Shuriki and reclaiming Avalor from her. However, Migs, Luna, and Skylar arrive to report that they had just spotted Shuriki and her crew heading for Nueva Vista, resulting in Elena being on a separate float from Isabel, Esteban, and her grandparents, protected by the Jaquins, Mateo, Naomi, and Gabe, during the parade. After the parade is over, Luisa and the others return to the palace, wondering where Elena is, before finding themselves face-to-face with Shuriki herself, much to their horror. Shuriki then has Luisa, Francisco, and their grandchildren locked in the tower, where they are soon joined by Elena and the Sirena Princess, [[Princess Marisa]], who reveals that Cristobal has betrayed them and allied with Shuriki. Luckily, Mateo, Gabe, Naomi, and the Jaquins bust them out, and they attempt to flee back to Avalor City on their yacht with Naomi's parents but are pursued by Shuriki on Cristobal's yacht, before they are stopped by Marisa's parents, King Pescoro and Queen Camila, her brother, Crown [[Prince Marzel]], and the Sirenas, who use their song to entrance Cristobal's helmsman and cause him to run the yacht aground into the palace. As Elena goes after Shuriki, since it is her the sorceress is after, Mateo, Naomi, and Gabe go after Fiero and the Delgados. By the time Luisa and the rest of the family return to Nueva Vista, Elena reports that Shuriki is gone for good this time, having killed her with the Scepter of Light, before Luisa watches as Elena has Cristobal locked up for his betrayal, and forges a new alliance and friendship with King Pescoro and the Sirenas.

Later on, Luisa supports Elena's intent to forge a new treaty with King Pescoro to ensure she has the Sirenas as valuable friends and allies for any new threats that attack Avalor City or Nueva Vista, despite Naomi having her own personal dislike for them. She later celebrates Dia de los Muertos with her family, the first time doing it in Nueva Vista and introducing the holiday to the Sirenas.

In "[[The Magic Within]]", Luisa finally learns of Esteban's original alliance with Shuriki when she first took over Avalor. Angered by his betrayal that led to the deaths of Raul and Lucia, Luisa sides with Elena and Naomi with voting to have Esteban exiled while Francisco was willing to forgive him, but Luisa couldn't as her daughter and son-in-law were killed and Esteban partially held the blame for it. However, Esteban later escapes with the Delgados, but then flees with Ash while Carla surrenders to Elena after her mother betrayed her and petrified Victor.

By the time of Elena's coronation in "[[Coronation Day]]", Luisa remains in Avalor City with Francisco and Isabel, who serves as acting Crown Princess with Elena's impending coronation as Queen, when Elena heads to Nueva Vista to deal with Ash and Esteban after learning of their appearance there and threatening both the people of Nueva Vista and the Sirenas of Coronado, only to find Avalor City under attack by Esteban and the Four Shades of Awesome some time later. When confronted by Esteban and Cahu the Time Shade in the throne room, Luisa and Francisco try to reason with Esteban, but are turned into a stone tablet by Cahu for their attempts to turn Esteban back to good. They are later restored, unharmed, when Elena unlocks a new power in her emotion magic after forgiving Esteban. After that, Luisa attends Elena's coronation as Queen with the rest of her family, friends, and allies in the Royal Family of Enchancia.
