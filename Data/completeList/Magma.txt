}}'''Magma''' is a fire elemental ifrit who appears in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]] episode "[[Smolder and Wiser]]".

==Role in the series==
Magma is a fire elemental ifrit with the power to control Earth's temperature. Known as the Lord of Volcanoes, he is summoned by lighting the Candle of Magma. [[Abis Mal]] calls for him so he will force the [[Sultan]] to hand over [[Agrabah]] to the thief. When the Sultan refuses, Magma heats up the city ground temperature at the point that water vaporizes and wooden carts spontaneously explode. Eventually, the ifrit is defeated when he falls down a deep well. The resulting steam pressure launches him into the sun. [[Genie]] comments that Magma has finally found somewhere warm enough.

== Appearance ==
In his normal form, Magma is bipedal and is covered with black molten rock. When he transforms into his monster form, Magma is bright orange.
