==Background==
They are the neighbors and friends of [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Drake Mallard/Darkwing Duck]]. They are happy and truly good-natured (and slow-witted) people who drive Drake Mallard crazy. They are unaware that their older son Tank is a bully, and are overly protective of their younger son Honker. They are excellent parents and let the children make their own decisions. Their favorite activities include backyard barbecue with friends and neighbors, and watching the sitcom ''Pelican's Island'' on TV. Herb is a door-to-door salesman, and Binkie is an exaggerated yet beautiful stereotype of a housewife and mother. Mostly they are not strict disciplinarians to their children and let them make their own choices.
