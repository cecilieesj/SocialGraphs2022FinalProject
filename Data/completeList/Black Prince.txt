The '''Black Prince''' is a character featured in the [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]] attraction at the [[Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
The portrait of the Black Prince is inspired by the real-life Edward the Black Prince in the Haunted Mansion attraction. However, whenever the lightning flashes in the attraction, the portrait transforms into a skeletal knight on a skeletal horse to give the attraction a frightening theme.

===Development History===
The Haunted Mansion attraction opened at [[Disneyland]] in [[1969]] where it features the portrait of the Black Prince displayed in the Changing Portraits scene. Originally, the portrait of the Black Prince was depicted into slowly morphing to reveal a skeleton of a knight riding on his horse syncing within this effect. However, over the years, the Changing Portraits hallway in the queue was updated where the lightning flash effect was added into the scene where the portrait of the Black Prince uses the same effect as in the morphing iteration.

==Appearances==

===[[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)]]===
====[[Disneyland]]====
In the original [[Disneyland]] version, the portrait of the Black Prince is one of the portraits featured in the Changing Portraits scene which is accessed after guests leave the Stretching Room walking past the hall of portraits. In it, the portrait of the Black Prince is displayed with the other portraits but when lightning flashes in this scene, the portrait of the knight on his horse transforms into that of a skeletal version of the knight on his horse.

====[[Magic Kingdom]]====
Following the [[2007]] refurbishment of the attraction at the Florida version of the Haunted Mansion, the [[The Sinister 11|Sinister 11]] scene was redesigned to replace it with the Changing Portraits scene similar to the one at Disneyland, where the lightning flash effect was added to the scene where a portrait of the Black Prince was displayed amongst the other portraits.

===[[Phantom Manor]]===
When the Phantom Manor attraction opened at [[Disneyland Paris]], the portrait of the Black Prince using the same effect as in the other previous iterations is featured as one of the portraits in the queue, as in the California version of the Haunted Mansion albeit slowly transforming into a skeleton knight. This portrait has been removed from the attraction as of [[2019]] as part of the attraction's major refurbishment.

===Other appearances===

====[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|''The Haunted Mansion'' (film)]]====
While not directly featured in the film, the same effect used for the portrait of the Black Prince was applied to the painting of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] where [[Jim Evers]] passes through the painting located at Gracey Manor.

This portrait also appears in the DVD menu of the film in the "Captions and Subtitles" section.

====''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''====
The portrait of the Black Prince is one of the obstacles the player must avoid in the Haunted Mansion mini-game in the Stretching Room chapter.
