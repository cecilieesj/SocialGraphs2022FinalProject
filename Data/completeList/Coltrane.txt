|inspiration=Corbin Bleu}}'''Coltrane'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0352306/?ref_=fn_al_ch_2</ref> is a friend of [[Jeremy Johnson]], and a recurring character in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. He is the bassist in his band, [[Jeremy and the Incidentals]], and a love interest in [[Stacy Hirano]]. He, along with [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]] and the band's unnamed drummer, performed at the Summer Festival, during which they were briefly transformed into a punk rock version of themselves by [[Dr. Doofenshmirtz]]'s Ugly-inator. ("[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]").

Coltrane was later seen watching Jeremy's TV commercial with him; he then changed the channel to see [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] on [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]'s game show ("[[Let's Take a Quiz]]").

Coltrane is also an instructor at the "Summer Rocks!", a summer course that [[Baljeet Tjinder|Baljeet]] was enrolled in ("[[The Baljeatles]]").

==Relationships==
===[[Stacy Hirano]]===
Coltrane appears to be a love interest for [[Stacy Hirano|Stacy]]. While performing ''[[Do Nothing Day]]'', they can be seen smiling at each other similar to Candace and Jeremy's way of smiling at each other during the song ("[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]").

The two later formally introduced themselves to each oth–µr during the "Summer Rocks!" concert. They immediately show mutual attraction to each other, including dancing with each other during "[[Gimme a Grade]]" and holding hands afterwards. He also said he would teach her to play bass ("[[The Baljeatles]]"). They were later seen dancing together on New Year's Eve in "[[Happy New Year!]]", and in "Mandace", Coltrane actually states that Stacy is his girlfriend.

===[[Jeremy Johnson]]===
He is great friends with Jeremy Johnson. He may be like what Stacy is to Candace, a best friend. He is seen watching TV with Jeremy and talking with Jeremy during the "Summer rocks!" concert. He is also seen at Jeremy's party ("[[Let's Take a Quiz]]", "[[The Baljeatles]]", "[[De Plane! De Plane!]]).

===[[Candace Flynn]]===
Coltrane and Candace barely ever interact directly, with the exception of "[[Mandace]]", where Candace was in disguise as a pizza man and they hung out like they were the best of friends. Coltrane was having a belching contest with his friends and Candace was disgusted by that. Also, when Coltrane talked about his girlfriend, Candace cut him off. So, in short, Candace is pretty indifferent to Coltrane.
==Trivia==
*Coltrane is possibly named after the famous jazz saxophonist John Coltrane.
*Coltrane is also modeled to look like his voice actor, Corbin Bleu.
*In "[[The Best Lazy Day Ever]]" and "[[Let's Take a Quiz]]", Coltrane wore a red hat, t-shirt and shorts. His character layout and appearance was changed in "[[The Baljeatles]]" so that he would look more like his voice actor, [[Corbin Bleu]]. However, in "[[Make Play]]" and "[[Candace Gets Busted]]", he switches back to his original outfit.
