'''Tina Minoru''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and supervillainess who appears in ''[[Doctor Strange (film)|Doctor Strange]]'',<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2016/10/14/first-look-at-major-runaways-easter-eggs-in-doctor-strange/|title=First Look at Major Runaways Easter Eggs in ''Doctor Strange''|website=Comic Book|date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> played by Linda Louise Duan, and in ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'', played by Brittany Ishibashi.

Tina studied mystical arts at a academy where she was contacted by the imprisoned [[Morgan le Fay|Morgan Le Fay]], a [[Dark Dimension]] sorceress who pretended to be Tina's friend and convinced her to steal a magical artifact known as the Staff of One, which was kept inside a safe in the academy. Tina stole the staff, but before handing it over to le Fay, she realized that the witch was manipulating her. So Tina severed her ties to Morgan and decided to keep the staff, since she too had been attracted to her power. 

She later joined the [[Masters of the Mystic Arts]], helping the other masters maintain balance at Kamar-Taj. She is also an ally of [[Doctor Strange]], [[Wong]], [[Daniel Drumm]], and [[the Ancient One]].

At some point, Tina married Robert Minoru and had two daughters with him, Amy and [[Nico Minoru|Nico]]. Later, she and her husband were forced to join a supervillain team called the PRIDE, by the Magistrate and become the CEO of a large corporation called Wizard.

Tina Minoru was created by Brian K. Vaughan, David Newbold and Adrian Alphona.
