[[File:Pete_Pan.png|thumb|193px]]'''Pete Pan''' is the Ventureland's version of [[Pete]]. This Pete is just a Pete in a [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] outfit. It is assumed that [[Yen Sid]] created him to challenge the ol' mechanical codfish, as this Pete has only appeared in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' and ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.

He was sent in the Wasteland to battle the animatronic [[Animatronic Captain Hook|Captain Hook]], but after the Blot's attack, Captain Hook went mad and stole the [[Sprite]] (the Wasteland's version of [[Tinker Bell]]) leaving Pete Pan unable to fly and trapped on [[Skull Island]] ([[Skull Rock]]). When [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] rescues the Sprite, it flies to Skull Island and Pete Pan comes to the [[The Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]] to fight Hook, if you didn't defeat him already, that is. This keeps Hook busy with his original antics. If you talk to Pete in [[Mean Street]], he will give you a Power Spark.

Unlike his other counterparts, Pete Pan is more friendly, active, honest, and loyal. In fact, he shares many mannerisms with Peter Pan, including crowing like a rooster.

==''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''==

In the sequel, Pete Pan has been corrupted and is hired by the [[The Mad Doctor (character)|Mad Doctor]] to be the security guard at the construction Site in [[Ventureland]], refusing to let Mickey and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] enter. At the end of the game, he appears with [[Pete|Big Bad Pete]] and [[Small Pete]] jumping into the Ventureland [[projector]] to possibly plan an evil scheme on [[The Wasteland|Wasteland]].

==Trivia==
*Even if you've defeated Captain Hook, you can still rescue the sprite and restore Pete Pan's flying ability, although this won't change the ending scene with Hook's hook sinking. It is unknown what he does after this, but is presumed that Pete Pan won't have anything to do, and most certainly if you jammed/or ignored the Pirate Conversion Machine.
