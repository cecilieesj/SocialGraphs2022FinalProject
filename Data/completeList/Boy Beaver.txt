==Background==
===Personality===
To [[Timon]], Boy Beaver is annoying and obnoxious. He enjoys causing accidents at his father's [[Boss Beaver's Log Land|amusement park]] and getting Timon blamed for the damage. He is also shown to be quite evil, as he attempted to kill Timon and [[Pumbaa]], who were on the Log Flume, by messing with the controls of the ride.

===Physical Description===
Boy Beaver is a short and slightly stout young beaver. He has brown fur, with a pale underbelly, dark brown paws, and a flat brown tail. His eyes are black. He sports a red baseball cap.

==Role in the series==
Prior to his debut, Boy Beaver was alluded to in "[[Oregon Astray]]", as Boss Beaver thanked Timon for delivering his kid to school.

In "Amusement Bark", when Timon and Pumbaa enter the souvenir shop at Boss Beaver's amusement park, Pumbaa finds something to buy, while Timon meets Boy Beaver. The young beaver tells Timon that he does not like meerkats. He then drops a sign on Timon, hammers his toes, and runs off, leaving the sign to break everything in the shop.

After Boss Beaver accuses Timon and Pumbaa of breaking everything at the souvenir shop, he makes the duo work at a local restaurant called Hot Log on a Stick, where they have to put logs on sticks. While Timon and Pumbaa do the job, Boy Beaver shows up and turns the dial to its highest setting. Timon sees him, and Boy Beaver runs away, leaving Timon to turn the dial back to normal. However, he is unsuccessful, and so the log machine explodes.

Boss Beaver then hires Timon and Pumbaa to drive a monorail. Timon sees Boy Beaver popping up everywhere in the monorail and tries to catch him, but fails, making Pumbaa accidentally destroy the monorail. After that, Timon and Pumbaa are hired to hold a giant beaver balloon while wearing beaver costumes. Timon sees Boy Beaver running and chases after him, which causes Pumbaa to float into the air with the balloon.

Boss Beaver then makes Timon and Pumbaa take his son to ride the Log Flume. Timon tries to convince Pumbaa and Boss Beaver that Boy Beaver had broken everything at the park, but Boss Beaver does not believe him, and Pumbaa thinks the young beaver is adorable.

Timon and Pumbaa ride the Log Flume, and Boy Beaver messes with the controls, making the ride go crazy and nearly killing Timon and Pumbaa. Boy Beaver then gets caught and confronted by his father. Timon and Pumbaa decide to buy the park and make the two beavers be their new workers. They make Boss Beaver and his son work at Hot Log on a Stick, and, as punishment, Timon turns the dial to its highest setting to make the job impossible for them.

==Trivia==
*Boy Beaver dislikes meerkats and warthogs, the matter being due to their foul odor.
