'''Buddy''' is a character featured in the extinct [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]]".

==History==

===Background===
Buddy serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the former Japan-exclusive incarnation  of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, he and the other four emcee birds create a plan to wake up the Tikis by playing various songs to wake up. After some failed attempts, they finally wake up after [[Lava (Enchanted Tiki Room)|Lava]] performs the musical number "Fever" with the [[Tiki Totem Poles]] to which the [[Tiki Room Drummers|Tiki Drummers]] suddenly start being active. After this, he and the other emcee birds celebrate together just before guests leave the attraction.

===Development History===
The Tiki Room attraction at Tokyo Disneyland originally opened as a Japanese version of the original show featuring the original emcee birds [[Jos√©]], [[Michael]], [[Pierre]], and [[Fritz]]. The attraction closed in Tokyo in [[1999]] and was rethemed as "Get the Fever!"  which opened in that same year where the four original emcee birds were removed and were replaced by Scats, Danno, Lava, and Buddy with the attraction having a different storyline compared to the original incarnation.

"Get the Fever!" closed in early [[2008]] and was later reopened as "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]" where the hosts from the "Get the Fever!" incarnation were replaced by four new emcee bird hosts: Manu, Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli.

==Role in the attraction==
During the show, Buddy is introduced by the announcer during intro number "[[The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room]]" alongside Danno, Lava, and Scats to which after singing to the guests that the Tiki Room is having a long slumber, he and the other emcee bird hosts encourage the guests to clap along to wake up the Tikis during the musical number "In the Tiki Room" (sung to the tune of "[[Wikipedia:In the Summertime|In the Summertime]]. Later asks [[Lava (Enchanted Tiki Room)|Lava]] to know if she has a group of girls who would help wake up the Tiki Room to which she manages to bring in the [[Showgirl Birds]] to help wake up the shack in a long slumber during the musical number "[[Hot, Hot, Hot]]". Throughout the song, Buddy and the other emcee birds partcipate with the Showgirl Birds where they all sing together. Despite this, the attempt to wake up the Tikis was unsuccessful.

Losing hope that the Tikis would never wake up, Lava then tells Buddy and the other emcee birds about her plan to wake up the Tikis in which the Totem Poles from the attraction join in with her singing and while singing, the plan to wake them up was successful. After the plan to wake up the Tikis was successful, Buddy and the other birds celebrate with the other Tiki Room birds with a special rendition of "[[I Wan'na Be Like You]]" just before he and the other emcee birds bid a farewell to the guests.
