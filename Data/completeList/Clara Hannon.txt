== Biography ==

=== Early Life ===
Clara Hannon is an Irish Catholic women from Philadelphia. She currently lives in Hawaii with her husband, Benny Kamealoha, and kids. At some point, she became Chief Resident at the Oahu Health Medical Center; she would later rise through the ranks to become the Chief of Medicine at the center.

=== Race for Chief of Staff ===
When Clara becomes aware that Dr. Choi, the current Chief of Staff at the Oahu Health Medical Center is leaving the hospital to pursue his dream with the Los Angeles Lakers, she is surprised but sees this as her opportunity to rise through the ranks and become the next Chief of Staff.

Clara is surprised to find that her opponent in the race for Chief of Staff, however, is none other than Dr. Lee. She finds this difficult and finds on numerous occasions that Dr. Lee is closer with Dr. Choi and has more time to pitch his ideas. To combat this, Clara begins using numerous methods to her advantage but the majority of these fail or are bested by Dr. Lee.

Eventually, Clara's race for the Chief position puts her at odds with those around her, particularly the Kamealoha family. She finds this difficult and eventually steps down from the race. After a talk with Lahela, however, she is inspired and jumps back into the race.

Clara puts her chance at being the next Chief of Staff in jeopardy, however, when she signs Uncle out of the hospital for a family tradition. She talks with Benny about the action and tells him that she thinks this will cost her the position, but that it was worth it. She is surprised to find that the Chief of the Board applauded her decision, however, and names her the next Chief of Staff.

=== Clashes with Lahela ===
On numerous occasions, Clara's parenting and strict regimes clash with her daughter, Lahela. Most notably, when Lahela applies and is accepted onto Walter's surf tour as a doctor, she asks her parents if she can go to Australia for the summer and spend this with Walter. Her parents decline, citing that she is too young.

Clara is furious with Lahela, however, when she learns from the Chair of the Board that Lahela submitted an application for two months break from her scholarship. Lahela tells Clara that she isn't a child anymore and therefore her mother needs to respect her decision. In response, Clara tells her that she is still her boss and declines her two-month break. Lahela is furious at this and hands over her badge, thereby resigning from her position at the hospital.

After thinking about it for a while, Clara changes her mind and tells Lahela about the time she became an adult and made decisions for herself. She tells Lahela that she can go to Australia but is glad when Lahela tells her that she has decided not to go.
