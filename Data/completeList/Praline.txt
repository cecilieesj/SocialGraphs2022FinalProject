'''Praline''' is [[Princess Amber]]'s pet peacock who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Sofia the First]]''.

==Background==
Praline made his debut appearance in the episode "[[Blue Ribbon Bunny]]" where Amber entered him in a pet contest. His special talent is making his tail feathers shimmer.

In the episode "[[Scrambled Pets]]" he is revealed to be much like Amber, posh and stylish. He is also very fond of apples and very sensitive as well as proud of his tail feathers. He always worries about them getting ruined, or suspects one is missing. When Amber decided to bring him to school, he got mixed up with Freedo in a sorcery class accident, becoming a peacock-headed baboon, much to his humiliation.

In the episode "[[Clover Time]]",Â  he appeared at a surprise party Clover threw in Sofia's room. He wanted to show off his dance moves, including his famous "shimmer".

==Trivia==
*He is one of several characters in ''[[Sofia the First]]'' to be voiced by [[Keith Ferguson]] after:
**[[King Garrick]] from "[[The Flying Crown]]" and "[[Lord of the Rink]]"
**[[Sir Bartleby]] from "[[The Silent Knight]]"
**the Ogre from "[[Enchanted Science Fair]]"
**[[Wishing Well (Sofia the First)|The Wishing Well]] from "[[When You Wish Upon a Well]]".
