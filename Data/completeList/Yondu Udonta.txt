'''Yondu Udonta''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appears in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|its sequel]].

Yondu is an interstellar bandit and a leader within the [[Ravagers]]. He becomes [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]'s guardian after abducting him from Earth. 

Yondu was created by [[Stan Lee]], Arnold Drake, and Gene Colan.

==Background==
When Yondu was young, his own parents sold him into slavery.

===Personality===
As the leader of the outlaws known as Ravagers, Yondu and his cohorts pillage their way through the galaxy, taking whatever they want for solely their own benefit.

Yondu abducted [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] when Peter was a child. Although Yondu raised Peter as a human son, he has a less-than-perfect paternal relationship with him. Yondu also is completely satisfied with his argument against Quill wanting to break free of his leadership (his argument is he stopped Quill from getting eaten), repeating it hundreds of times to Peter for 20 years. Nevertheless, Yondu does genuinely love and care about Peter, even sacrificing his life so Quill could live.

==Appearances==
===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''===
In 1988, Yondu was sent to Earth with a mission to take Peter Quill to his father, but instead decided to keep and raise as a [[Ravagers|Ravager]].

Being in Morag, Yondu discovers Quill decided to keep the [[Orb]] and sell it on his own, directly defying his adopted father's orders. Later, Quill gives his whereabouts to save [[Gamora]] of imminent death. Being on the Yondu's ship, decide to work together, on the condition that Yondu would get the Orb once they had succeeded.

During the Battle of Xandar, Yondu kills many [[Sakaarans]] with his Yaka Arrow after his fighter is shot out of the sky. Finished with the battle, Peter gives him a false Orb. Later he discovers that inside the Orb is a troll doll but he simply smiles, being thrilled since he collects them.

===''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''===
Two months later, he while relaxing on the planet [[Contraxia]] with his [[Ravagers|Ravager]] Clan, his crewmember [[Taserface]] and one of the other members hatch a plan to kick Yondu out. While there, he encounters [[Stakar Ogord]], who is disgusted to see Yondu again, and an argument ensues, in which Stakar tells Yondu why he was exiled for trafficking in kids. Later, [[Ayesha]] arrives on Contraxia to offer Yondu a mission to capture the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] on [[Berhert]].

Yondu and the Ravagers arrive on Berhert, and capture [[Rocket Raccoon]] who is staying with the ''[[Milano]]'' which had crashed after a battle with a fleet of Sovereign Drones. While capturing Rocket, an argument breaks out between Yondu and Taserface over Yondu's unwillingness to hand the Guardians over to the Sovereign, until [[Nebula]] shoots off Yondu's fin.

Later on the Eclector, Yondu and Rocket are imprisoned while the rest of the Ravagers dress up [[Groot]] and tease him, treating him as their mascot. Taserface gains control of the ship, and kills all crewmembers loyal to Yondu. Later the rest of Taserface's members are taking a rest while Rocket and Yondu plan to escape the Eclector. With the help of Groot and [[Kraglin Obfonteri|Kraglin]], Yondu gets a new fin (which was hidden in his room) and uses his arrow to kill Taserface and the rest of his members. Kraglin pilots the Quadrant while the Eclector blows up.

Yondu, Rocket, Groot, and Kraglin were on the way to Ego's Planet to rescue [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] and his team against [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]]'s plan to rule the universe. After the battle, Udonta was welcomed by Rocket and Groot and joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. Later escaped with Quill as the Ego's Planet was destroyed and [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]] was killed. Yondu apologizes to Quill for not being a better parent to him but is luckly that he's ''his'' boy and sacrificed himself to save Quill.

During Yondu's Funeral, all Ravager Clans joined forces as Yondu was brought into space. After the Funeral, Quill gave Yondu's Arrow and Fin to Kraglin and began to practice using the weapon only to end up stabbing Drax in the chest. Udonta's actions inspire Stakar Ogord to assemble his previous team including [[Aleta Ogord]], [[Charlie-27]], [[Mainframe]], [[Krugarr]], and Martinex T'Naga. The team has become the chief Ravagers.

===''[[What If...?]]''===
Yondu appears in the episode "[[What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?]]", set in an alternate timeline where instead of abducting [[Peter Quill]] he abducts [[Black Panther|T'Challa]] and trains him to be a ravager.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Yondu was the leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, this version of him was adapted into mainstream Marvel Comics.
*The prototype fin Yondu keeps is based on his fin from the original comics.
