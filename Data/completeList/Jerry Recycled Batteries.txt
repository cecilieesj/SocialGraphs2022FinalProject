{{Quote|"[[Mack]]? I ain't no Mack! I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake! Turn on your lights, you moron!"|'''Jerry Recycled Batteries''', to '''[[Lightning McQueen]]'''}}

'''Jerry Recycled Batteries''', also known as '''Peterbilt''', is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2006]] animated film, ''[[Cars]]''. He is the transporter for products of the company "Recycled Batteries". He was voiced by the late [[Pixar]] animator and Cars co-director [[Joe Ranft]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Jerry is grumpy and temperamental, and gets angry easy, especially when others mistake him for a Mack truck.

===Physical appearance===
Jerry is a large 1981 Peterbilt 362, a model that is based on a Cabover Engine Peterbilt 352. Although he is rather rusty, his maroon color is still visible, which is present on both him and his trailer. On his cap and trailer doors are pictures of recycled batteries. He has a grey bumper and rims.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cars]]''===
In ''Cars'', when [[Lightning McQueen]] wakes up in the middle of the highway after falling out of [[Mack]]'s trailer, Lightning attempts to find Mack, and notices a truck turning on one of the exits. Lightning, believing this Mack, starts racing toward the hauler. After nearly being hit by a freight train, McQueen approaches the truck, only to discover that it's actually Jerry. The Peterbilt scolds Lightning for mistaking him for a Mack truck and insults him, and grumpily drives off.

==Trivia==
*Jerry is Joe Ranft's final speaking part for [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] before his death, since [[Red (Cars)|Red]] did not have any dialogue in the film except for crying noises.
*The designs on his trailer were designed by [[John Lasseter]]'s son.
*In ''[[Heavy Metal Mater]]'', his Recycled Batteries hat has a white background.
*In a early deleted scene, he doesn't scold McQueen for mistaking him as a Mack truck, he only tells him to turn his lights on. As a result, he wasn't a Peterbilt 362 during that time since the movie was still in development.
*Also, in Cars 3, there would be a similar scene. When McQueen finds out Brick Yardley's firing, he tries to tell Bobby Swift what's happening only to find out that its a next-generation racer named Daniel Swervez. McQueen tells the next-gen racer that he's not Bobby and Danny replies "name's Danny bro".
