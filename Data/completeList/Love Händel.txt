'''Love Händel''' is a [[1980]]s fictional new wave band. According to a "Behind the Music"-style documentary, they broke up due to infighting and an ever-dwindling fan base. [[Bobbi Fabulous]] became a hair stylist, [[Sherman (Phineas and Ferb)|Sherman]] got a job at a public library, and [[Danny (Phineas and Ferb)|Danny]] is still playing and has a store named Danny's Music Shop. Years after the breakup, they reunite for "one night only", thanks to [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] ("[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]"). Despite this, they have been seen as a band at various other points, including in a parade and in a giant jukebox ("[[Hip Hip Parade]]", "[[Make Play]]"). They have also been seen in a tour bus, which implies that they may have reunited and gone back on tour ([[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension|''Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension'']]).

==History==
First seen in the episode "Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together", the group had broken up due to infighting and having smaller and smaller crowds, but thanks to [[Phineas Flynn|one boy]], due to his [[Lawrence Fletcher|father]] and [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|mother]] not remembering their date, he was able to get them back together and perform a song for them, with [[Danville|almost everyone in town]], including "[[Fireside Girls|ninjas of love]]" coming down the stage, who had built it earlier in the day. The band also appeared in "[[Thaddeus and Thor]]" singing with Dr. Doofenshritz about his mom not liking him due to him not being able to kick. In "[[Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!]]", Love Händel did two songs: [[Bouncin' Around the World|''Bouncin' Around the World'']] and [[The Ballad of Klimpaloon|''The Ballad of Klimpaloon'']], with the latter only existing on the soundtrack until it was performed in "[[The Klimpaloon Ultimatum]]". On the Phineas and Ferb Holiday Favorites album, they sung 'Santa Claus is Comin' to Town'. Their younger selves also made an appearance during the song [[Carpe Diem|''Carpe Diem'']] in "[[Rollercoaster: The Musical!]]" [[File:Young_Love_Handel.jpg|thumb|250px|Young Love Händel in their outfits during [[Carpe Diem]] with [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]].]]

==Trivia==
* [[Lawrence Fletcher]] bought tickets for himself and [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]] to attend the farewell concert of Love Händel, her favorite band. After they were featured in the "flaming hot spotlight of love", Lawrence felt brave enough hold her hand, which he had never done before. Danny yelled over to him to kiss her. Linda obliged and kissed him passionately; the two were later married. ("[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]")
*Bobbi and Sherman have seen the documentary about their band. During an argument, Bobbi stated that it was "slovenly behavior that ruined Love Händel", while Sherman quoted the "infighting due to pressure from a dwindling fan base" statement from the documentary.
*In "[[Thaddeus and Thor]]", Love Händel helped [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz]] sing a song about why he couldn't play kickball.
*[[Danny (Phineas and Ferb)|Danny]] is probably based on [[Dan Povenmire]].
*[[Sherman (Phineas and Ferb)|Swampy]] is probably based on [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]].
*[[Bobbi Fabulous|Bobby]] is probably based on Bobby Gaylor.
*Love Händel have been on a national tour at least once (maybe twice). For, they have mentioned being in Albuquerque in 1993 and Detroit in 1994.
*The name "Love Händel" is a mix of two terms, one a slang term for being "a little overweight" around the hips (love handles) and the other making reference to Baroque musician [[wikipedia:George Frideric Handel|George Frideric Handel]] who created, among other pieces, the ''[[wikipedia:Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.
*In 1993 in Albuquerque, though unknown exactly what happened, it was either about robots and/or their bus being knocked over because Danny said "Great. Albuquerque '93 all over again." ("[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]")
*In 1994 in Detroit, though unknown exactly what happened, the band somehow ended up covered in juice and packing tape. Bobbi brought this up after Paul the Delivery Guy helped [[Perry the Platypus]] juice [[Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated|D.E.I]] and the band was left behind. ("[[Delivery of Destiny]]")
*Songs performed by Love Händel in the show are all sung by Jaret Reddick in real life.
*Their name is a reference to Glam Metal.
*[[wikipedia:New York Doll|Arthur "Killer" Kane]], the bass player for the [[wikipedia:New York Dolls|New York Dolls]] (a proto-glam/punk band), found himself working in a library after the band broke up. They, too, later reunited.
