Oh freeeee.|The Sea Monsters singing}}The '''Sea Monsters''' are a group of singing sea serpents who appear in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series ''[[Sofia the First]]'' episode "[[The Secret Library: Tale of the Eternal Torch]]". They are led by Aqualina.

==Role in the Series==
The sea monsters live in the waters that surround the Blazing Palisades. For generations, they've been feuding with the [[Dragons of Enchancia]]. The sea serpents believe the island should belong to them. Eventually they obtained the [[Forever Fountain]] and planned to replace the [[Eternal Torch]] with it. They would flood the Palisades and be able to take over.

The [[Secret Library]] sent [[Sofia the First (character)|Sofia]] to warn the dragons, but [[Prince James|James]] stowed away. The sea serpents arrived on to get to top of the island and replace the torch. Sofia and James managed to warn the dragons and they went to stop the sea serpents. They faced each other in a sing off which led nowhere. The dragons tried to block them off with a rock wall but James pushed a bigger rock off, destroying the wall. With the way clear, the sea serpents replaced the Torch with the Fountain.

Once James and Sofia merged the Torch with the Fountain, it created a rainbow effect that convinced the sea serpents and dragons to share the island.
