Rohan arrives to [[Hasan]]'s home, where he hands [[Aisha]] vegetables and milk. She thanks him, but Rohan tells her that there's no need. Hasan snaps at Aisha, and asks that Rohan keep his charity. Rohan questions if Hasan has gone crazy, and refers back to how he himself always said they were united, while he's now playing into the hands of the British.
