==History==
In [[Field Trip of the Just]], when [[Cornelius Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Ingrid Third|Ingrid]] follow [[Eric Orben]] outside the school while pursuing him, he steals away the young artist's miniature horse, Jules, which is used for guidance and refers to it as his dog. In a running gag, the young artist corrects those who call Jules as such. A blind man who is known as Man #1 also uses a miniature horse to help get around safely and may be the young artist's father.
