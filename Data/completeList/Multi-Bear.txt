'''Multi-Bear '''is a large magical beast whom [[Dipper Pines|Dipper]] went to conquer in order to attain manliness. It has eight heads, with one main, intelligent head, capable of human speech. ItÂ lives in the Multi-Bear's cave at the top of a high mountain.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
The creature has one large bear head with nine smaller heads, and has a total of twelve limbs, sharp claws, and dark brown fur, all the bears have black noses and yellow eyes. The main, intelligent head is located at the top and five smaller heads emerge from around its neck. Two of the heads are located in-between both pairs of his hind legs. On the bear's back, a second partially-formed body sticks out housing the ninth head. While the main head is sapient and capable of speech, the smaller ones have animal intelligence and only grunt or roar. During [[Weirdmageddon (event)|Weirdmageddon]], some of the heads gain an eye patch.

===Personality===
Though he seems ferocious to Dipper at first, he soon realizes that the Multi-Bear is actually a rather nice guy. [[Manotaurs|The Manotaurs]] declared him their enemy because he engages in some activities not considered "manly", such as listening to BABBA.

==Role in the series==
Dipper was sent by the [[Manotaurs]] to conquer the Multi-Bear and bring back its head (or one of them). The Multi-Bear was very ferocious and threatened to kill Dipper if he did not leave his cave. Dipper refused and he and the bear began fighting. Dipper ultimately won and was going to conquer the Multi-Bear. The Multi-Bear had one last request: to die listening to his favorite song, [[Disco Girl]]. Dipper realized that he and the Multi-Bear had something in common, and decided not to slay him.

The Multi-Bear is one of the creatures who sides with the rebels during Weirdmageddon. He helps pilot the Shacktron with the others while fighting [[Bill Cipher]] and his minions. After the crisis subsides and Bill is defeated, the Multi-Bear is seen among other Gravity Falls creatures waving farewell to Dipper and Mabel as they return home.
