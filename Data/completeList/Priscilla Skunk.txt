|quote = "Well I never!"}}'''Priscilla Skunk''' is a character in ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]'', voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. She is a girly skunk who loves to be the center of attention to the point where she doesn't like sharing the spotlight with anyone - even [[Sheriff Callie]].
Priscilla also loves fashion and looking her best, as well as flowers and all things beautiful.

==Personality==
Priscilla's ego is displayed in "Calamity Priscilla", in which Frida Fox and her Wild West show come to Nice and Friendly Corners. Being a known celebrity, Frida Fox gets a lot of attention from the residents of Nice and Friendly Corners, which makes Priscilla jealous.

Priscilla cares a lot about self-image and hates to get dirty, and it's revealed in "My Fair Stinky" that Priscilla is part of a Flower Club. Priscilla was embarrassed by Farmer Stinky's filth in the episode and tried to change him into a sophisticated gentleman. She was successful, but she let him go back to his old ways toward the end of the segment.
