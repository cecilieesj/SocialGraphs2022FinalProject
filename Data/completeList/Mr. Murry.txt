===[[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|''A Wrinkle in Time'' (2003)]]===
At the beginning of the film, Jack tells his daughter [[Meg Murry|Meg]] to wish upon a star so she can achieve faith that her wishes would come true, to which Meg has a hard time adapting her life in the real world, to which he tells her that nobody hates her despite Meg having trouble adapting to her life, telling her to think patiently and her father says that whenever she needs him, he will be in her heart while listening to him just as her mother tells her to return home. When Meg returns home, she narrates that both of her parents were brilliant scientists while passing through the twins Sandy and Dennys playing foosball together just as Meg explains that she wished that her missing father would come back.

Later, Mr. Murry disappears in the family household just as Charles is instructed by [[Mrs. Whatsit]] to show [[Calvin O'Keefe|Calvin]] about Jack where he sees a flashback of Mr. Murry and his daughter at the playground just before the TV becomes static. Mrs. Whatsit appears on the television screen and warns that Meg and Charles must find their missing father before he is gone forever. Mrs. Whatsit brings in Meg and Charles to help find him, as well as bringing in Calvin to join the search for Mr. Murry and arrive at the star-watching rock as [[Mrs. Whatsit]] transports the three to Uriel, the third star of the planet Malik.

During a discussion with Mrs. Whatsit, [[Mrs. Who]], and Mrs. Which, it is then shown that Mr. Murry is lost in the planet Camazotz under the troubled dark forces, which is the reason why the three of them sent the children there to find him before he is lost at the hands of darkness. Later when Meg and her friends encounter the [[Happy Medium]] inside his cave, he tunes in his crystal ball showing Mr. Murry's wife hoping that her husband would come back as Meg and her group plan to find her missing father at Camazotz and return him back to her family's house.

Later when Meg, Charles, and Calvin arrive at Camazotz via tesseract at Central Central Intelligence, Meg puts on the glasses that Mrs. Who gave and finally finds him to which upon finding him, he doesn't recognize his daughter at first but suddenly remembers that she is her father to which after happily reuniting with him, Meg tells him to put on the glasses she used to which as the two escape. Charles happily reunites with his meeting father just as Calvin approaches Mr. Murry to which the moment is disrupted when It enters. As the Man with Red Eyes enters, he, Meg, and the rest of her allies are then separated from Charles where he commands Charles to avoid trusting the Man's bad influence. However, Charles being put under control by the Man with Red Eyes where he sends Meg stuck in midair just as Calvin tells Jack to put on Mrs. Who's pair of glasses to save Meg from the tyranny of It. Meg attempts to escape with her father and Calvin, but suddenly gets separated from the two where Calvin and Meg's father end up at Ixchel via tesseract.

Arriving at Ixchel, Meg's father finds himself next to his daughter who is being comforted by one of the residential aliens of Ixchel while discussing about Charles Wallace's fate in Camazotz in a plan to rescue him before it is too late to which Meg follows helpful advice from a residential Ixchel alien, Aunt Beast, in a plan to seek anything that is unseen in order to help Meg fulfill her goal.

Later, Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who appear in front of the Mr. Murry, his daughter, and Meg's friend, Calvin where they discuss with the three about the possibility of reuniting Charles back to his family to which it is explained that grace could be the only way to fulfill their mission in defeating It and his powerful forces. After remembering what Mrs. Whatsit said to the three, Mr. Murry tells his daughter that the weaknesses in her mind are doorways to her secret strengths, to be herself in order to cheer her up to which Meg's father shares an embrace with her.

Later after Meg rescues Charles Wallace from the Man with Red Eyes (and It, the being itself), Meg and Charles Wallace return to the real world via tesseract with their father back in the real world where Mr. Murry's wife finally reunites with his wife. After the three Mrs. Ws praise Meg for her heroism alongside Charles Wallace, Mr. Murry walks alongside his family mingling with each other while listening to Charles Wallace sharing his experience about the adventures he had with Meg and Calvin.
