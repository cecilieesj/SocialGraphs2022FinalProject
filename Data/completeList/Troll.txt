[[File:Troll_woy.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''The Troll''' is a minor antagonist from the ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' episode "[[The Troll]]". He is voiced by [[Keith Ferguson]].

==Role in the episode==
[[Wander]] and [[Sylvia]] have a feast with the goat residents of the planet ''Baaaaa-halla'', when the tiny Troll attempts to get through the gate. He insults the guards and grows in size each time his victims talk back. As the Troll gets bigger and climbs further towards the food, more guards try unsuccessfully to defeat him.

The Troll finally reaches the dinner table and attempts to make fun of Wander. However, he simply ignored the insults and caused the Troll to shrink. Sylvia and the goats then realized how to take the Troll down. The Troll shrinks with every insult the goats ignore, until reverting to his tiny, harmless size.
