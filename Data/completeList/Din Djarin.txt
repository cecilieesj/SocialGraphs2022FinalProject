{{Quote|I'm a Mandalorian. Weapons are part of my religion.|Din Djarin}}
'''Din Djarin''' aka "'''The Mandalorian'''", also sometimes called '''Mando''', is the titular protagonist of the [[Disney+]] original series ''[[The Mandalorian]]''. He is a reputed [[Mandalorian]] bounty hunter operating at the time of the New Republic some years after the fall of the [[Galactic Empire]]. During one of his hunts, he met a mysterious Force-sensitive infant named [[Grogu]] of [[Yoda's Species|the same species]] as [[Yoda]] nicknamed "The Child", who happened to be his target with whom he formed a close bond and to seek to protect at all costs, putting him in conflict with other bounty hunters as well as the surviving Imperial Remnant that had originally hired him. Din is an "adopted" Mandalorian, since he wasn't born on [[Mandalore]]. Despite this, after defeating the Imperial Remnant’s leader, [[Moff Gideon]], the Mandalorian then acquired ownership of the [[Darksaber]] thus making him the rightful ruler of Mandalore.

==Background==
In his youth, Din Djarin lived with his parents on the planet Aq Vetina that was victim of a separatist attack in which his parents lost their lives by protecting him. A super battle droid flushed him out and would have killed him without the intervention of Death Watch. This tragic event remained in his memory years later.

Some time later, he joined a Mandalorian clan called "The Tribe", settled on the volcanic planet of Nevarro. When he was old enough, Din pledged allegiance to the Mandalorian creed, thus becoming one of their own and acquired armor and weapons from his new people, before joining the Bounty Hunters' Guild. In 9 ABY, five years after the destruction of the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]] and the final defeat of the Empire, the Mandalorian had gained an excellent reputation as a bounty hunter, which provoked the jealousy of other members of the Guild.

He once teamed up with two mercenary Twi'leks, Qin and his sister Xi'an, and things went very badly between the three of them, with the Mandalorian leaving Qin behind. Around this same time, Din was working with Ranzar Malk as bounty hunters until a falling out separated them for a time.

===Personality===
Competent and dangerous, this bounty hunter is ruthless and merciless to those he tracks or those who put themselves in his way. He is constantly alert and will draw his weapons if he feels as though someone is about to attack him. Endowed with a morality more than doubtful, it is difficult to make out his facial emotions because he never removes his helmet.

Solitary and somewhat antisocial, the Mandalorian has a respectful relationship with the Mandalorian Armorer who is also aware of the fact that he is an orphan. He is also able to show great respect towards someone who earns his trust, like Kuii,  whom he even offered his gratitude when the Ugnaught had at the same time refused a payment and become his partner.

The Mandalorian deeply respects the creed of Mandalore, which act as the rules of the Tribe: he never removed his helmet in front of a living being even if his life depends on it and would prevent anyone from doing it--although he found a loophole by allowing IG-11, who was not alive in the first place, to remove it to heal him. He strictly adheres to the creed no matter what the situation is, even when breaking it could very well save his life. Initially, like the other members of the Children of the Watch, Din had a low regard for Mandalorians who did not cover their faces as he does, not considering them true Mandalorians. This changed however, after fighting alongside Bo-Katan and her crew, coming to accept them as true Mandalorians despite their different belief systems. This also encouraged Din to bend the rules of his clan occasionally, knowing now that they were not the ways of ''all'' Mandalorians. At one point, he lifted his helmet partway off in front of Grogu so he could sip his soup, and he later changed out of his armor completely to disguise himself as a stormtrooper, albeit still not showing his face until he absolutely had to.

Beneath his stoic exterior, the Mandalorian is, in truth, a bit of a tortured soul who is plagued by the memories of his parents’ death and the destruction of his village. Watching his parents and people slaughtered in front of him by battle droids as a child has left him with a near pathological hatred and distrust for all droids: deadly or not. Even after IG-11 was reprogrammed by Kuiil, Djarin still refused to trust it, feeling that the droid was bound to turn on them at some point. However, after IG-11 saved him and sacrificed itself for him, Grogu, Karga and Dune, Djarin came to realize he was wrong about IG-11 and thus was able to overcome his hatred of droids. Despite being more use to their presence, Djarin does still have some issues when dealing with droids, though nowhere near to the same extent as before.

Due to having been an orphan himself, he seems to have a deep sympathy for other orphans, and this same sympathy also extends to "The Child", who was initially a target for him. Caring first about his security only to get his payment for it evolves to the point that he risks his life and betray the guild to save him from these employers. As time goes on, the Mandalorian grows to care about the child’s well-being to the point that he was willing to leave him at the village on Sorgan, believing that he could live a happy life there. After the child was officially made a foundling by the armorer and the Mandalorian was declared as his father, his care for the child started to become parental. By the time they met Ahsoka Tano on Corvus, Djarin had come to regard to child as his son. After learning the child’s name of Grogu for the first time, Djarin even found himself laughing and enjoying the time he spent with him, showing how positively Grogu was influencing his character. After Grogu was abducted by Moff Gideon, Djarin was determined to rescue him, so much so that he even reluctantly broke the Children of Watch’s code of never revealing their faces to others, despite being left ashamed and disturbed by what he had done. When the time came for Djarin to hand Grogu over to Luke Skywalker’s care, Djarin was deeply saddened of having to let his adopted son go to the point of removing his helmet and shedding tears, showing just how much he had come to love Grogu.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Mandalorian]]''===
====Season 1====
In the pilot episode, "[[Chapter 1: The Mandalorian|The Mandalorian]]", on a planet of ice, Mando goes to a bar filled with rogues, three of whom harassed a Mythrol. One of the stalkers tries to provoke him, even going as far as to graze the beskar armor with a knife. Mando grabs a glass and uses it to hit the thug before banging him with the second scum and killing the Quarren by closing the door on him, cutting him in half. The Myrthol wanted to thank the Mandalorian but to his great misfortune, he had come to capture him.

Once outside the planet, the Myrthol tries to convince his kidnapper not to deliver him, but the bounty hunter just ignored him until his prisoner descended into the lower part of the ship where he discovered with horror others prisoner locked in carbonite before being carbonated himself by the mandalorian. Arrived on Nevarro, Mando went to see the leader of the guild, Greef Karga to collect his bounty. Refusing first the imperial credits which according to him was worth nothing, he obtained Calamari Flan instead and asked for another mission but found that the premiums were not worth much, so Greef offered him an alternative of Mission may be common with a man named "The Client" whom he should meet in person.

Arrived at the meeting place, Mando knocks on the door and shows a magnetic card to the door droids then enters and is escorted by a GNK droid. In the room, The Client accompanied by some [[Stormtroopers]], welcomes Mando mentioning that Greef had informed him about the reputation of the mandalorian. The conversation cut short when Dr. Pershing suddenly entered the room, prompting Mando to point his blaster at him. The Stormtroopers targeted the bounty hunter and despite their numerical superiority, Mando was not intimidated. The Client calmed the conflict and then proceeded to explain the purpose of the mission: to recover a person of about fifty on Arvala-7 by promising that the reward will be a huge amount of Beskar, even offering a brick of this same metal to the bounty hunter.

Mando then went to the enclave where the tribe lived and gave the beskar to the gunsmith so that she could forge a new Pauldron for him. During the making, Mando had flashbacks from his childhood the day the separatists attacked and killed his parents.

Once on Arvaka-7, he scanned the area before being suddenly attacked by Blurrgs until an old Ugnaught was crested with darts, saving the Mandalorian to whom he asked if he was a bounty hunter, which Mando confirmed. The Ugnaught took Mando to his home and introduced himself as Kuiil. Kuiil then informed the mandalorian that he had helped other bounty hunter in the same mission and that none of them survived. Advised by Kuiil, Mando tries to ride a Blurrg but after some failure, he gives up but tries again when Kuiil reminds him that his ancestors knew how to ride the Mythosaur and finally succeeded in taming it.

On Blurrgs' back, they cover several kilometers of gorge and crevasse to arrive at the camp where the target of the mandalorian is. Halfway, Kuiil indicates the rest of the way to go before returning home, but before he leaves, Mando wants to pay him for his help but Kuiil declines his offer, considering that if Mando gets rid of the mercenaries, peace will return to his valley and will be sufficient payment.

Arrived at the site, Mando crossed paths with another member of the guild, the assassin droid IG-11. After a bad start, the two bounty hunters agreed to collaborate and share the bounty. Once all the mercenaries were eliminated, they entered the hangar and IG-11 detected a single form of life which turned out to be a young child aged fifty due to the biology of his species, as well as the target. IG-11 is about to eliminate the kid but Mando shoots him quickly in the head.

In "[[Chapter 2: The Child|The Child]]", Mando brings his target back to his ship but on the way, three trandoshans attack him by surprise. He succeeds in killing one of them, which forces the other two to flee. Unfortunately for him, it is not the last of his problems, when he finds Jawas stealing pieces of his ship and managed to escape with it.

Stuck on this world, Mando returns to see Kuiil who reveals to him that he knows where to find the Jawas and that he will be able to negotiate with them, despite the fact that the Mandalorian is skeptical about it. After a rainy trip, the two travelers find the jawas, whose language Kuiil knows speak and the negotiation begins. The Jawas first demand the beskar, which is out of the question for Mando who tries to say in their language that its stolen parts belong to him only so that the Jawas laughs at mediocre mastery of their language, comparing him to a Wookie. Annoyed, Mando almost burns the mocking Jawa until Kuiil calms him down and succeeds in finally finding an agreement with the thieves.

To recover his stolen pieces, Mando must recover a Mudhorn egg, gigantic and violent creatures. Arrived in the cave of the beast, Mando accidentally awakens the creature which with a powerful blow of the horn pierces his coat of arms for beskar. While the Mudhorn charges the bounty hunter, the mysterious child uses force to lift the beast which gives Mando time to stick his knife into the Mudhorn's neck.

After recovering his pieces and with the help of Kuiil, Mando repairs his ship. He offers to Ugnauth to become his partner but Kuiil politely declines, declaring to have worked all his life to escape from servitude. Mando then offers him his gratitude and Kuiil does the same to thank him for bringing peace to his valley.

In "[[Chapter 3: The Sin|The Sin]]", back on Nevarro, Mando takes the little creature to the Client's office. Once his pay from Beskar is obtained and The Child takes The Child elsewhere, Mando questions what awaits the little one but only gets a reminder that the guild is not supposed to care about this. The bounty hunter then returns to the Mandalorian lair where he finds The Armorer to replace his damaged armor with the Beskar he brings back. His loot attracts him the contempt of Paz Vizsla because of the Beskar origin of an imperial refinery, which in his eyes makes Mando a coward who shares the table with the empire. Vizsla then attempts to remove Mando's helmet, leading to a brief skirmish between them until The Armorer brings it to an end. In addition to new armor, Mando also receives Whistling Birds after refusing a seal from Mud Hord due to how the beast's death was not honorable. Mando immediately sets out on the hunt for bounties with his new armor but suddenly feels remorse, he goes to save The Child. Although he manages to get through the Stormtroopers, Mando soon finds himself facing Karga and the other bounty hunters, coming to retrieve The Child. Opponents are quick to surround Mando until the rest of The Tribe arrives as reinforcements, allowing Mando to return to Razor Crest. However, Karga ambushes him when he arrives, claiming that he has betrayed the code. The Mandalorian, however, manages to shoot Karga and flee out of Nevarro.

In "[[Chapter 4: Sanctuary|Sanctuary]]", now fugitives, Mando and The Child stop on Sorgan where he meets a former rebellious troopers by the name of [[Cara Dune]] who prefers the bounty hunter not to stay here any longer. Before he could leave, Mando is approached by two locals asking for his help in defending their village from Klatooinian looters. Mando also recruits Cara on this mission and the duo find out that the Klatooinians have an AT-ST Raider, making things more complicated. Trying at first to convince the villagers to flee, Mando decides to train them for the coming battle, also bonding with the local woman, Omera. After provoking in their camp, the Klatooinians launch an assault on the village with the AT-ST but end up defeated and the Imperial machine sinks into the mud. In the aftermath of the fight, Mando chose to leave The Child in the village and was almost reluctant to stay there too. After Cara takes down another bounty hunter, Mando realizes that more will be coming for the little creature, forcing him to keep him with him.

In "[[Chapter 5: The Gunslinger|The Gunslinger]]", following a firefight that left the Razor Crest heavily damaged, Mando came to rest on [[Tatooine]] at Hangar 3-5 at Peli Motto. Needing money to pay for repairs, he goes to Chalum Cantina hoping to get hired for a bonus. Rookie bounty hunter Toro Calican offers to help him capture the dangerous assassin [[Fennec Shand]], whose reputation Mando knows about, the deal being that Mando keeps the credits while Toro uses Fennec's capture to enter the guild. . Confiding The Child in Motto, Mando follows Toro across the dune sea on Speeder bikes, stumbling upon some [[Tusken Raiders]] before finally finding Fennec on ground where she has the advantage in broad daylight. At nightfall, Mando and Toro launch an assault in Speeders and flash charge to approach Fennec and capture him, but at the cost of destroying Mando's Speeder. With Toro refusing to leave the veteran bounty hunter alone with Fennec, Mando sets off to find the Dewback from earlier, only to find that Toro is gone and Fennec apparently dead. Back at Hangar 3-5, Mando finds himself face to face with Toro who has taken Motto and The Child hostage. Mando pretends to retreat then uses a flash charge to blind Toro and kill him. Mando then pays Motto with the late Rookie's money and then leaves Tatooine.

In "[[Chapter 6: The Prisoner|The Prisoner]]", still in need of money, Mando meets his former partner Ranzar Malk who offers him a mission in collaboration with a team of mercenaries, including Xi'an, to rescue someone on a New Republic prison freighter, although the Razor Crest is the main reason for Mando's inclusion. Throughout the mission, the atmosphere between Mando and the mercenaries remains tense, especially after the murder of Officer Davan. When it turns out that the person in question is Qin, the mercenaries betray and lock Mando in Qin's cell. Mando manages to escape and neutralize each of the mercenaries one by one then captures Qin and shoots down the Droid Zero before he shoots The Child. After bringing Qin to Malk, Mando retreats with his payment just before X-Wings storm Ranzar station thanks to a tracker Mando left on Qin, anticipating Ranzar's failed betrayal.

In "[[Chapter 7: The Reckoning|The Reckoning]]", Mando receives a message left by Karga, who survived their last meeting, offering to eliminate The Client who had meanwhile taken control of the town of Nevarro, also meaning that the hunt for The Child could finally end. . Mando picks up Cara on Sorgan then the two go to Arvala-7 to recruit Kuiil. Much to Mando's dismay, Kuiil has repaired and reprogrammed IG-11 and brings it with him, despite the Mandalorian's deep resentment towards this droid for nearly killing The Child the last time around. 

Reuniting with Karga and his men outside the city so as not to attract attention, the group sets out on the road until nightfall where as they discuss the plan of action, they are attacked by poisonous flying reptiles. one of which injures Karga who is then saved by the Child's Heal Force. Arriving in sight of the city, Karga shoots down the rest of his men, revealing that he actually plans to kill Mando and then deliver the green creature to the Client but repents after The Child saves his life. While Kuiil brings The Child back to the ship, Mando pretends to have been captured by Cara and Karga to approach The Client but the trio are quickly cornered inside the Cantina by the entirety of the Imperial remnant led by their real leader, [[Moff Gideon]].

In "[[Chapter 8: Redemption|Redemption]]", stuck and only having until dusk to surrender, Mando reveals knowing Gideon since the Imperial was a liaison during the Mandalore purge, also revealing how he became a Mandalorian without even being born on the planet in question. The trio receive unexpected help from an IG-11 who saved The Child following Kuiil's murder. During the firefight, Mando is seriously injured by an explosion caused by Gideon. He urges the others to leave him behind while they flee into the sewers to reach the lair of The Tribe. IG-11 stays with Mando and attempts to remove his helmet to treat him, a move Mando responds with the threat to shoot IG-11 if he only tries, continuing to cling to the creed forbidding him to show his face. to living beings. IG-11 retorts that he is not a living being and completely removes Din's helmet before treating his head injury with a bacta spray.

Joining the others in the sewers, Mando returns to the lair to discover the remains of his countrymen's armor. The Armorer then appears, revealing that the Mandalorians purposely unmasked themselves and that many may have survived. She also explains to Mando that The Child is part of Mandalore's ancestral enemy, The Jedi and that by having saved The Child, he made him a Foudling of whom he is now the adoptive father until he brings back. the little one among his own. Mando also receives the seal of the Mud Horn to confirm the clan of two he forms with The Child and a jetpack. The group flees through the rivers of lava but finds the exit blocked by the Stormtroopers. IG-11 decides to sacrifice himself for a chance to escape. Mando opposes it but IG-11 assures him that he doesn't have to be sad because he only wants to ensure the survival of The Child. After IG-11's self-destruction, the quartet are attacked by Gideon aboard his TIE. Using his new jetpack, Mando manages to shoot down Gideon in mid-flight. With the imperial remnant defeated, Karga offers Mando a new place in the guild, just to decline it in favor of his new mission to bring The Child back among his people. Before leaving, Mando buries the late Kuiil.

====Season 2====
In "[[Chapter 9: The Marshal|The Marshal]]", Mando has been looking for his fellow Mandalorians for some time to help him find the Jedi. He finds gangster Gor Koresh and after close questioning, learns that a Mandalorian lives in the town of Mos Pelgo on Tatooine. Back on the desert planet, Mando drops off his ship at Hangar 3-5, this time letting the Dum Droids maintain his ship, before continuing the journey with Toro's Speeder Bike. Arrived at Mos Pelgo, he questions a Weequay bartender on where to find the Mandalorian who also happens to be Mos Pelgo's marshall, only so that the latter does not show himself in person. Mando realizes, however, that the individual, Cobb Vanth, is not like him the instant he takes off his helmet, prompting Djarin to force the marshall to hand over the armor he is wearing. Before they get to the blasters, a Dragon Krayt appears in the city. Vanth then offers Mando to return the armor to him in exchange for his help in killing the Krayt.

Unable to use the Razor Crest as the Krayt would sense the vibrations and remain hidden, Mando follows Vanth to the creature's lair. Along the way, they encounter Massifs that the Mandalorian easily tames. A tribe of Tusken Raiders then appears, also wanting to eliminate the Krayt. At nightfall, Mando stops the tensions between Vanth and the Sand People then the next day, the Tuskens bring the two men to the Krayt lair, an abandoned Sarlacc nest. The odds are not on their side, Mando and Vanth manage to convince the inhabitants of Mos Pelgo to ally with the Tuskens, despite the old resentment between the two peoples. All gathered in front of the nest, the alliance faces the formidable giant monster which alone slaughters several fighters. Getting eaten with a Bantha covered in an explosive charge, Mando manages to exit the Krayt's belly and then unleashes the internal detonation, finally killing the beast. As promised, Vanth returns the armor to Mando, also hoping that they will meet again one day.

In "[[Chapter 10: The Passenger|The Passenger]]", Mando and The Child return to Mos Eisley after being ambushed by thieves, resulting in the destruction of the Speeder. He meets Motto again and learns that a batrachian alien nicknamed Frog Lady to a husband who has seen Mandalorians but that in order to have the information, he must deposit it in the Trask system with his offspring, all without using the hyper -space. The start of the journey starts off pretty tense, with Frog Lady speaking no language Mando knows and The Child constantly trying to eat the eggs. Things get worse when two New Republic patrol boats intercept Razor Crest. Mando attempts to scatter them over the snowy world of Maldo Kreis, only to get his ship stuck in an icy cave.

With the Razor Crest pinned to the ground by ice, Mando accepts that there isn't much he can do about it until a Frog Lady using Zero's leftovers to communicate in basic urges the bounty hunter to finish the game. travel to Trask as agreed. Mando claims the market no longer holds on to their terms but reluctantly changes his mind when Frog Lady declares that the Mandalorians still keeping their promise was just a legend. They are later attacked by giant spiders and have to greet them to the two patrollers who recognize Djarin as part of Qin's escape mission but since he helped capture the mercenaries, they just let him go on condition have him fix the Razor Crest transponder. Following a fairly mediocre makeshift repair, the ship finally left the snow-covered planet.

In "[[Chapter 11: The Heiress|The Heiress]]", approaching Trask, the repairs begin to drop as soon as the atmosphere enters. The Razor Crest ends up in the water and is then taken care of by a Mon Calamari worker while Mando escorts Frog Lady to her husband. The male Frog out of gratitude directs Mando to  where he have seen the notorious Mandalorians. Inside, Mando comments on dining for The Child and then makes a deal with a boatman Quarren to join the Mandalorians.

Unfortunately, the boatman sets a trap for Djarin by locking him in the tank of the Mamacore by throwing The Child there first, wanting to appropriate the beskar. Suddenly, three Mandalorians Nite Owls appear, eliminate the Quarrens, and save Mando and The Child. At first very grateful to them, Mando becomes suspicious when they remove their helmets. The leader introduces herself as [[Bo-Katan Kryze]], explaining to be a Mandalorian born on Mandalore while revealing that Mando is actually part of the Child of the Watch, a fanatic sect detached from Mandalore society to rekindle old forgotten ways. Mando dismisses this, claiming that it's only Mandalore's path that matters and leaves the trio, flying away with his adopted son in the distance.

Back on the docks, the duo are ambushed by vengeful Quarrens. Bo-Katan, [[Koska Reeves|Koska]] and Axel once again come to Mando's aid by eliminating the rest of the Quarrens, followed by an invitation from Bo-Katan to Mando to go have a drink with them. Bo-Katan tells him about her plan to reclaim Mandalore, something Mando doesn't care about due to the sad state of the planet and that he has to find the Jedi. Bo-Katan therefore offers Djarin to help them steal weapons aboard an Imperial freighter in exchange for the position of a Jedi.

The next day, after entrusting The Child to the Frogs parents, Mando and the three Nite Owls infiltrate the massive ship in mid-air, making their way to the weapons warehouse. At this point, Bo-Katan plans to take full control of the freighter from now on. Mando opposes this change, only to have Bo-Katan change the terms of their agreements, much to Mando's displeasure. On the way to the bridge, the freighter begins to plunge towards the ocean and the stormtroopers block the only access. Mando uses his beskar armor to approach and throws grenades before storming the bridge with Bo-Katan and Koska. He and Koska manage to barely avoid the plunge. The takeover fulfills, Bo-Katan gives Mando the position of [[Ahsoka Tano]] in the town of Calodan on Corvus but hopes he will join her fight to free Mandalore in the future. Mando then retrieves The Child and leaves Trask in a rather poorly patched up Razor Crest.

In "[[Chapter 12: The Siege|The Siege]]", repairs made to Trask loose, forcing Mando to return to Nevarro where he reunites with Karga once again magistrate and Dune. While Karga's employees repair the Razor Crest, Mando accompanies his friends into the city fully recovered from the assault on the Imperial Remnant and discovers that the cantina has been turned into a school. After The Child is left at school, Karga and Dune ask Mando for his help in destroying the Imperial base on Nevarro where Gideon's army came from.

Also accompanied by the same Mythrol that Mando had previously captured, they infiltrate the still-occupied base and reach the reactor and sabotage it to blow up the entire place. The quartet then force their way through exchanging gunfire with the Imperials until they reach a strange cloning lab the existence of which was not known to them. Digging through the system, Mythrol activates a message from Dr. Pershing to Moff Gideon regarding failed experiments with the Midi-chlorians. Mando initially believes the posthumous message until Mythrol only reveals it was only three days old, confirming Gideon's survival and worrying Mando to the point that he quickly returns to town with his Jet-Pack, leaving his Friends flee aboard a Trexler 906 Armored Marauder before the base self-destructs. Once The Child is recovered, Mando climbs back aboard a fully repaired Razor Crest and shoots down the remaining TIE fighters chasing the trio. Mando and The Child then leaves Nevarro.

In "[[Chapter 13: The Jedi|The Jedi]]", The Razo Crest finally arrives on Corvus. Inside Calodan, Mando notices that the inhabitants live in fear and misery before being led to the person who rules the city, Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth who offers him a pure beskar spear if he eliminates a Jedi. with whom she is in conflict. Knowing that it is Ahsoka Tano, Mando pretends to accept the offer and begins his research in the forest. Ahsoka suddenly appears and briefly engages in the fight against the Mandalorian until Mando informs the former Jedi that he is coming on behalf of Bo-Katan and that he just wants to talk to him. Ahsoka quickly guesses that it is the little green creature.

After dark, Ahsoka and The Child telepathically communicate at length and then Ahsoka reveals to Mando that the real name The Child is Grogu, once raised and trained in the Jedi Temple of Coruscant until the end of the Clone Wars, also revealing his cognate with the Jedi master [[Yoda]]. Asked about Grogu's [[The Force|Force]] bending by Ahsoka, Mando understands that she is talking about Grogu's powers, leading him to tell him about his mission to find another Jedi so that Grogu can be protected from what is left of the Empire.

The next morning, Ahsoka tests Grogu's faculties but the best result is only obtained when Mando takes part in the test due to his connection to him. Ahsoka notes that Grogu has become very attached to the Mandalorian and this causes her to refuse to train the little one, having seen for herself what such attachment has done to her own master, [[Anakin Skywalker]]. As Ahsoka prepares to return to town, Mando offers her help against Elsbeth in exchange for which she will have to train Grogu.

Night has fallen again, Ahsoka infiltrates Calodan and goes to confront the magistrate in person while Mando frees the prisoners he had seen arriving earlier. With the assassin droids and Elsbeth's henchmen taken out, Mando confronts the magistrate's right arm, Lang, and kills him with a rapid blaster fire shortly after Ahsoka submits Elsbeth. When the day rises, Calodan is free and happy again, Mando returns to Razor Crest with the beskar spear offered as a reward by Ahsoka.

He stays a long time with Grogu in the ship's bay, accepting that it's time to go our separate ways. Ahsoka suddenly appears, still refusing to train Grogu due to his connection to Mando, so she offers an alternative of going to Tython where the Force can guide Grogu to make his own destiny, while also pointing out that so few Jedi remain. Mando thanks Ahsoka and she wishes the Force to be with him before he leaves Corvus.

In "[[Chapter 14: The Tragedy|The Tragedy]]", Arrived on Tython, Mando sets Grogu on a seeing stone but nothing seems to happen until Mando notices a ship landing nearby, then a force field rises around Grogu and prevents Mando from him. to move. The bounty hunter then comes down the hill and finds himself confronted by [[Boba Fett]] who claims the armor that Cobb Vanth gave him, being actually his own. Mando refuses because the beskar only belongs to the Mandalorians, so Boba reveals that he has a hidden shooter ready to take down Grogu. To Mando's surprise, the shooter turns out to be Fennec Shand still alive. Boba then offers a negotiation, each lowering their weapons and the clone continuing to claim his armor that was once that of his father, [[Jango Fett]], in return for which he offers Grogu's protection. The negotiation ends when two Imperial assault ships land in their turn in the area.

Mando returns to seeing stone but unable to get Grogu out in a trance, he joins Fennec against the stormtroopers. In bad shape, the duo are saved by a Boba again equipped with his armor. Once the two ships are destroyed, a shot from Gideon's light cruiser fires at the Razor Crest, destroying it before sending Dark Troopers to capture the Jedi Apprentice who has just stopped his meditation. Boba pursues them long enough to see the light cruiser fleeing in hyperspace as soon as the Dark Troopers return and their captive on board.

Scanning the smoldering remains of his ship, Mando picks up the button that Grogu loved to play with as well as the beskar spear that remained intact. He then joins Fennec and Boba who shows him the chain code of his armor, revealing that Jango was a Mandalorian foundling. Mando therefore agrees to leave the armor to Boba and considers that their deal lapses until Boba clarifies that in exchange for the return of his armor, he promised to protect Grogu, meaning that he and Fennec will help Mando to to save him.

The trio soon after travel to Nevarro aboard the Slave One and Mando asks a now marshall Cara of the New Republic to seek information on Mayfeld due to his former Imperial sniper status which could help him track down Gideon.

In "[[Chapter 15: The Believer|The Believer]]", Mando meets Mayfeld again on Karthon Chop Fields after Cara exfiltrates him. Agreeing to help the group upon learning that Gideon has kidnapped Grogu, Mayfeld gives the location of a secret Imperial mining center on Morak where they can presumably find the coordinates of the light cruiser. On the spot, the group plans to infiltrate the mining center which is more exactly a rhydonium refinery because of the level of security but as Cara and Fennec can be spotted by ISB scanners and Boba could be recognized, Mando is the only one. to be able to go with Mayfeld, although he continues to not show his face while wearing the full armor of one of the Transport Trooper of the juggernaut transport that the group is ambushing.

On the long drive to the refinery and at slow speed due to the dangerousness of the rhydonium, Mayfeld chats about several things without Mando bothering to answer them, one of the things being that they are similar but Mando claims that they are nothing alike. The duo are then attacked by Shydopps pirates coveting the rhydonium. Mando struggles to repel them because of his Imperial paraphernalia limiting his abilities. Fortunately, they reach the refinery safely. By finding the terminal on the network, Mayfeld recognizes his former boss Valin Hess and doesn't want to risk being recognized, prompting Mando to go for him, although that means he will have to take off his headset for the scanner to scan. of the terminal is working. He manages to get Gideon's coordinates but is approached by a suspicious Hess. Mayfeld saves Mando from being spotted, only for Hess to invite them to share a drink to celebrate their delivery of rhydonium. Mando mostly spends this moment listening to Mayfeld and Hess talk about Operation Cinder, an event Mayfeld loathes while Hess only calls it necessary for the cause of the Empire, which ends up pushing a disgusted Mayfeld. to kill him, toasting their blanket. Fleeing over the rooftops, the duo are rescued by Boba with Slave One and covered by Cara and Fennec. At high altitude, Mayfeld asks Mando to pass him his cycler rifle with which he detonates the entire refinery with a single shot in the rhydonium.

In thanks for his help, Mando and Cara let Mayfeld freely. Later, Mando sends a holographic message to the light cruiser, warning Gideon that he is coming to pick up Grogu, using the same words the Moff used in their last encounter.

In "[[Chapter 16: The Rescue|The Rescue]]", after capturing Dr. Pershing, Mando and Boba recruit Bo-Katan and Koska Reeves despite a brief tension between the two female Mandalorians and the Gideon. Later, Mando and the four women are aboard the Imperial Shuttle that Pershing was in, pretending to be attacked by the Slave One to better board the light cruiser. Once in the launch bay, the women launch the first offensive up to the control bridge, allowing Mando to sneak up to the cell where Grogu is being held. On his way, he comes across the Dark Troopers' cargo bay which has just been activated and succeeds in locking it with Pershing's code cylinder, not without one of them escaping. After a tough fight, Mando manages to defeat the laser-proof droid by beheading it with his spear and then expels the other droids into space. In Grogu's cell, Mando finds himself confronted by a Gideon threatening the little creature with the Darksaber. The Moff then tells the story of the weapon but Mando only cares about Grogu so a Gideon claiming to have got all he needed apparently lets Mando take back Grogu just to attack him sneakily but Mando manages to defeat him using his spear in beskar.

Again reunites with Grogu, Mando joins the bridge with Gideon as a prisoner. Tension arises when Gideon reveals that by beating him, Mando has become the rightful owner of the [[Darksaber]], at odds with Bo-Katan's plan to get it back for herself. Mando attempts to hand the weapon over but Bo-Katan refuses to take it that way, much to Gideon's amusement. At the same time, the Dark Troopers climb back aboard the light cruiser and nearly perforate the armored door to the deck separating them from the group when an X-wings board and the pilot turns out to be a Jedi. As the Dark Troopers are slowly all destroyed with a lightsaber, Gideon grabs a blaster and almost kills Grogu if Mando hadn't barred with his Beskar armor. Gideon then attempts to kill himself just to be knocked out by Cara. With the Dark Troopers all destroyed, Mando lets in the mysterious individual who turns out to be [[Luke Skywalker]]. Mando sees that Grogu doesn't feel like following the Jedi until Luke explains that the child needs his permission but that Grogu won't be really safe until he has mastered his powers. Accepting that the time to part has come, Mando finally lets Grogu see his face for the first time and then watches him leave with Luke and [[R2-D2]], with tears in his eyes.

=== ''[[The Book of Boba Fett]]'' ===
Some time after handing Grogu over to Luke, Mando resumed his activity as a bounty hunter while searching for the survivors of his Tribe. During his latest job, he injured his leg due to his lack of practice in the Darksaber, which he now uses as his main melee weapon. Mando eventually finds the Armorer and Paz Vizsla in a space station, now as the only living members of the Tribe. Wanting to see Grogu again sooner or later, Mando has his spear melted down into Beskar armor for his former adopted son. His possession of the Darksaber brings him the wrath of Paz Vizsla, the weapon having belonged to his house since its creation, and the two come to clash for the right to wield the Darksaber. Mando wins the duel, but when questioned by the Armorer, he admits to having removed his helmet and is consequently rejected by his comrades, while being disowned as a Mandalorian unless he "bathes in the waters of the mines of Mandalore".

Now aimless and still missing Grogu, Mando travels to Tatooine as Peli Motto had offered him a replacement for the Razor Crest. Arriving at Mos Eisley, Mando and Peli rebuild an incomplete N-1 starfighter that Peli had planned to give to him. Once the test of his new ship is complete, Mando is approached by Fennec who offers to hire him as muscle to help Boba in his war with the Pyke syndicate. Mando agrees to do it for free but asks to go see Grogu first.

Mando visits Luke’s planet and is greeted by R2. After asking the droid to take him to Skywalker, he is left waiting outside of Luke’s under-construction Jedi academy. He is left waiting alone and falls asleep after R2 powers off. Ahsoka awakes him and says that R2 actually brought him to talk to her; she explains that Grogu must not see Mando or else it will distract from his training. Mando finally agrees but asks Ahsoka to give the armor to Grogu. Ahsoka agrees as Mando departs the planet.

Mando is present for the crew’s briefing at Boba’s palace. When Fennec says they need foot soldiers, Mando visits Cobb Vanth in Mos Pelgo (now renamed Freetown), who agrees to see what he can do. 

The crew heads to Mos Espa, where they split into groups, each in a district belonging to one of the crime families, while Boba, Mando, and the mayor’s captured majordomo hide in the ruins of the Sanctuary cantina. After the other crime families betray Boba and the Sanctuary is targeted by [[Cad Bane]] and the Pykes, Boba offers to let Mando save himself, but Mando refuses, saying he would rather die honorably by his friend’s side. The two Mandalorians jet out of the the Sanctuary with the majordomo’s help and fight the Pykes back-to-back. They are saved by the citizens of Freetown, who have come for revenge after Vanth was injured by Bane. Together they defeat the Pykes, who retaliate by sending in two giant droids. These droids prove immune to everything Mando and Boba hit them with, from lightsabers to rockets. 

Mando reunites with Peli in the subsequent chaos, who reveals that Grogu has been brought to her by R2, having been given the armor and choosing to return to Mando instead of continuing his Jedi training. Boba’s rancor ends up going on a rampage, causing Grogu to use the Force to put it to sleep. Bane is killed by Boba, while Fennec goes to Mos Eisley and assassinates the crime bosses and the corrupt mayor. 

With the job done, Mando and Grogu leave Tatooine in their new ship, with Grogu convincing Mando to take it to light speed.

==Trivia==
*According to the Jawas, The Mandalorian speaks their language so badly that he sounds "like a [[Wookiees|Wookiee]]".
*The name of "The Mandalorian" was revealed by Pedro Pascal in an interview conducted by ScreenSlam released on the same day as Chapter 1 of the first season, with the website spelling the name as "Dyn Jarren". He was finally named in the eighth chapter of the first season, with the spelling "Din Djarin".
*He has an aversion to droids, probably because as a child, he was nearly killed by a Super Battle Droid. He eventually grows to trust droids, even calling [[R2-D2]] a “friend”.
*By saving Grogu, Mando unwittingly makes him a foundling as he had been in the past and as the Mandalorian creed wants it, he became Grogu’s stepfather, at least until he brings him back to those of his kind.
*It was revealed in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', Mandalorians have family houses; it is unclear if the Mandalorian and the other Mandalorians seen in the show come from a house too.
*He is the second Mandalorian to be a main protagonist, the first being [[Sabine Wren]].
**He and Sabine share a few things in common.
***Both had some connections with the Empire (The Mandalorian was hired by the empire to capture the child while Sabine joined the empire thinking they would bring peace to her world; both also betrayed the empire upon knowing/learning their intentions wasn't true).
***Both are bounty hunters who wear Mandalorian armor (Sabine was once a bounty hunter before becoming a rebel; the Mandalorian still works as a bounty hunter).
***Both held the Darksaber at some point in their lives.
*In ''Star Wars Rebels'', Sabine shot a Stormtrooper in the head at point-blank range; the Mandalorian shot a stormtrooper in a similar manner in Episode 8.
*It is revealed in ''[[Chapter 16: The Rescue]]'' that by defeating Moff Gideon in battle, Mando now has the sole right to wield the Darksaber and is thus the rightful ruler of Mandalore.
*Din in Arabic means "religion" or "way of life".
