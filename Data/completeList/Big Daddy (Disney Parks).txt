:''Not to be confused with "[[Eli La Bouff]]", [[Charlotte La Bouff|Charlotte]]'s father from "[[The Princess and the Frog]]" who is also known as "Big Daddy".''
'''Big Daddy'''<ref>Page 10 of ''[[America Sings (soundtrack)|America Sings]]'' soundtrack book</ref> is a character at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
Big Daddy is an anthropomorphic pianist pig. In the "Modern Times" sequence of the attraction, he would sing the song "Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar". He wears a pianist outfit with a bowtie on it as well as a bowler hat while singing the aforementioned song. According to the America Sings soundtrack book, it is said that Big Daddy is using his piano to "beat it straight on the 88".

===Development History===
The Big Daddy character was created for the [[America Sings]] attraction at [[Disneyland]] in the [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] section where he was placed in the "Modern Times" sequence where he sings the song, "Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar", which opened on [[June 29]], [[1974]]. However, America Sings closed on [[April 10]], [[1988]] in order to retheme the attraction to [[Innoventions]], with Big Daddy and most of the animatronics moved to [[Splash Mountain]] at the [[Critter Country (Disneyland)|Critter Country]] section, which opened on [[July 17]], [[1989]]. Due to the success of the attraction at Disneyland, the Splash Mountain attraction was later constructed at the [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] at [[Frontierland (Magic Kingdom)|Frontierland]] and [[Critter Country (Tokyo Disneyland)|Critter Country]] respectively, still featuring Big Daddy in the finale sequence.

As of [[2020]] due to Splash Mountain being completely reimagined into an [[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|attraction themed after]] ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' in order to remove references to ''[[Song of the South]]'' (which Splash Mountain is based on), it is currently unknown of what will replace Big Daddy's animatronic in the rethemed version of the attraction.

==Appearances==

===[[America Sings]]===
Big Daddy was featured during the former attraction's final act, "Modern Times" where he is playing, "Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar". Throughout the sequence, he is seen singing in front of the audience happily playing his piano to which suddenly the Weasel pops up and says, "Pop goes the Weasel!", where the sequence loops into another song consisting of a medley between "[[Hound Dog]]" and "See You Later Alligator".

===[[Splash Mountain]]===
In the each version of Splash Mountain, Big Daddy can be seen at the end of the attraction, singing the musical number "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" along with a whole chorus of animals welcoming [[Br'er Rabbit]] in his home at the [[Briar Patch]] after escaping from [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Bear]].
