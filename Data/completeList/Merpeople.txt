'''Merpeople''' are a legendary species that are half-human and half fish. Females are referred to as '''mermaids''', while males are referred to as '''mermen'''.

They are featured most heavily in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', and [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|other]] [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea|related]] [[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning|media]]. Other than ''The Little Mermaid'' franchise, they have made appearances in other films and shows.

==Background==
===Mythology===
The earliest records of merpeople were the "fish people" created by the goddess {{WikipediaLink|Tiamat}} in the Babylonian Creation Epic the ''Enuma Elish'', written on clay tablets several thousand years ago. They appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions, they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans. Some attributes of mermaids borrow influence from other mythological creatures, including the Sirens and [[Naiads]] of Greek mythology. In many stories, mermaids and mermen lure and attract humans with their enchantingly beautiful and melodic voices to send the humans to their demise or simply entertain them.

===Physical appearance===
Merpeople possess the traits of both humans and fish: their upper body is generally depicted as human or humanoid, while a fishtail replaces the lower body. Merpeople are also shown to be fairly tall, with [[King Triton]] towering over most of them, and even [[Ariel]] in her human form is only a few inches shorter than [[Prince Eric|Eric]].

==Powers and Abilities==
*'''Underwater Breathing''': In order to live underwater, merpeople have the ability to metabolize oxygen from the water, which negates the need to surface to breathe air. However, they are more than capable of breathing air outside water, as evidenced by certain events where they are on land for prolonged periods of time.
*'''Aquapathy''': They have a connection to their aquatic home, as they can communicate with aquatic and marine life.
*'''Speed Swimming''': Mermaids can endure days of swimming without exhaustion, in such expertise and speed as to rival or exceed most sea life in comparison.
*'''Super Strength''': Merpeople are often depicted with a degree of superhuman strength and abilities, which is evidenced by [[Ariel]] moving an underwater boulder from the grotto as well as knocking down a door with relative ease.
*'''Thermoendurance''': They also have the ability to withstand and survive in extreme temperatures, such as when in a underwater volcanic region (such as [[Ursula's Lair]]) or the cold, Arctic icy waters where [[Morgana's Ice Cave]] is located.

== Appearances ==
=== Animated appearances ===
==== ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' franchise ====
[[File:Little-mermaid-1080p-disneyscreencaps.com-9101.jpg|thumb|250px]]
In ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and related media, merpeople are shown to live in the sea within various underwater kingdoms. [[Atlantica]] is the most prominent, though others are implied to exist in the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]]. They are shown to coexist with sea life, with whom they are able to communicate. They generally do not interact with humans, due to the danger, though this changes after the events of the first film. It also shows that many unnamed ones are held as prisoners of [[Ursula]]. They made bargains for her aid and were unable to uphold their part of it. As a result, they are withered down to [[Ursula's Garden|polyps]]. Ursula's death causes them to be restored to their natural forms.

Interestingly, dialogue from one fish character in the TV series implies that most fish either don't realize or don't know that merpeople have parts of their biology that resemble that of a human, as it refers to them as "half-fish, half-something else". Mermen generally appear bare-chested, but females usually wear a pair of seashell bikini top out of decency. It is also possible that they are herbivores, or at the very least vegetarians, as they aren't seen eating fish, and apparently they don't seem to view doing so as being ethical.

==== ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' ====
[[File:S1e15 mabel being rude.png|thumb|left|250px]]
Merpeople were briefly mentioned in "[[Dipper vs. Manliness]]" by the [[Manotaurs]], and a merman named "[[Mermando]]" appears in "[[The Deep End]]". They are stated to live in the water.

In the [[Gravity Falls Title Theme|opening credits]], a picture of one like the one in the Mystery Shack can be seen at the end of the credits.

Merpeople prominently appeared in the episode "[[The Deep End]]" when [[Mabel Pines]] befriends a beautiful merman named Mermando. He had been swimming in the Gulf of Mexico but was caught by a net from a fisherman. He later is seen at the [[Gravity Falls Pool]]. When she first saw him, she went all silly, wanting him. She soon realizes that he is a merman, and thus tries to help him, of which she succeeds. He is last seen swimming back to his home. Merpeople have about 17 hearts.

However, marine biologist Dr. Walter Kornbluth is convinced that mermaids are real, and will stop at nothing to protect his credibility by exposing her to the world.

==== ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]'' ====
In ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]'', two merpeople are shown: the protagonist, Cody, and his biological mother. The ones in this film are somewhat similar in appearance to one from other media. However, there are several distinctions. They are able to pass for humans until they turn 13 when the fish physiology surfaces. The transformation is shown to be triggered by exposure to water. In addition to the fish-like tail, they also have scales on their palms and small fins that run along their forearms. They also seem to possess other abilities, such as the one to generate electricity, to the point that they can fire it similarly to a defibrillator, and the one to stick to surfaces.

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 3x06 - Ariel - Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Mermaids are a humanoid species featured on ABC's ''Once Upon a Time'', notable for having the ability to swim across realms. They are native to the [[Enchanted Forest]] and [[Neverland]] and first appear in the first episode of the third season. They are described as the most dangerous creatures in all the seas and are considered more of a threat than sharks, whales, or even a Kraken. Their powerful tails can break through wood and in large swarms they can sink ships. Mermaids can also use shells as trumpets to summon and manipulate terrible storms and waves. Some mermaids have voices which are lovely enough to enchant people and lure them onto rocks. Only four mermaids have been shown on the show, one being [[Ariel]], [[Ursula]] before becoming the Sea Witch, another unnamed one, and an alternative version of Ariel from the Wish Dimension. Snow White also briefly turned into a mermaid.

===Other Appearances===
====[[Sindbad's Storybook Voyage]]====
Mermaids also appear in the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] attraction where they inhabit the Mermaid Rocks area.

In the pre-2007 revamp where it was known as "Sindbad's Seven Voyages", the mermaids were originally depicted as sinister sirens playing an enchanting but haunting song in which [[Sindbad]] did not appear in this version just before arriving at the Rukh Island area.

In the post-2007 revamp, the animatronic mermaids were redesigned to match the tone of the attraction's retool. In the current iteration, Sindbad's ship suddenly crashes during a storm just as the mermaids are heard harmonizing while Sindbad himself sings with the mermaids. After singing, Sindbad thanks the mermaids for helping him get a new ship just as he and [[Chandu]] sail to Rukh Island.

==Trivia==
*In the ''Kingdom Hearts'' franchise, King Triton initially deduced that [[Sora]] was from another kingdom in the ocean due to his tail, implying that their tails act in a similar manner to human fingerprints (being unique), within the franchise.
*Shortly after King Triton defeated the [[Sorceress]] in the episode "[[Red (episode)|Red]]", he mentioned to the Sorceress "See you next century," implying that their lifespans are over one century (100 years), at the very least. This has some basis in various real-life myths on Merpeople, with the original Hans Christian Andersen tale indicating that merpeople were capable of living for three centuries.
*In real life, the classification of merpeople is debatable due to possessing fish-like traits (namely fish-tails). However, the presence of mammary glands implies that they are mammals. In addition, their tails are patterned in a horizontal manner, more akin to marine mammals than true fish, whose fishtails are patterned vertically.
*A common claim was that merpeople were actually manatees or dugongs that were surfacing and had seaweed on top, causing them to be mistaken for them. The first part of the Disney Comics story "Serpent-Teen" alludes to this claim by having a manatee named Eddie pose as Ariel, implying that they have frequently used manatees as decoys to ensure they weren't discovered.
*The [[Aladdin (TV series)|TV series]] adaptation of the film ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' features a siren water elemental named [[Saleen]], which is similar to a mermaid. However, her fish features resemble that of a lionfish, and she possesses the power to manipulate water.
*[[Miss Piggy]] appears as a mermaid while she, Kermit and Robin performed "Octopus' Garden" in the episode of ''The Muppet Show'' James Coco hosted.
