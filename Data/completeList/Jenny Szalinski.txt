'''Jenny Szalinzki''' is a supporting character in ''[[Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves]]''.

==Background==
In the movie, Jenny plans to invite her friends, Jill, [[Jody]], Holly and Corky, to a party she's hosting in her Uncle [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]]'s house. To win the argument, she makes sure her mother, [[Patti Szalinski|Patti]], wouldn't stop her from inviting her friends. To accomplish that, she, her brother, [[Mitch Szalinski|Mitch]], and cousin, [[Adam Szalinski|Adam]], bring home the groceries. Before inviting her friends, she tells Adam and Mitch to behave. However, she later despairs when Mitch faints from a potassium deficiency and they can't find his prescription medication. Luckily for her, Adam saves the day by feeding him a banana, remembering an earlier lesson from Wayne about the chemical content of bananas.
