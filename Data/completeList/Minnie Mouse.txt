{{Quote|Gosh, Minnie, you've always been a princess to me.|Mickey Mouse|Dream Along With Mickey}}

'''Minnie Mouse''' is an animated anthropomorphic mouse character created by [[Walt Disney]]. She is the longtime girlfriend of [[Mickey Mouse]], known for her sweet disposition, large head bows, and polka-dotted dresses. She is also identified by her signature catchphrase, “[[Minnie's Yoo Hoo (song)|Yoo-hoo!]]”, which she affectionately calls out as a greeting. Inspired by {{WikipediaLink|Flapper|flapper girls}} of the [[1920]]s, Minnie first appeared in the short ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', released on [[November 18]], [[1928]].

Minnie is traditionally depicted as a {{WikipediaLink|Starving artist|starving musician}}, singer, and songwriter. Her classy, yet no-nonsense demeanor serves as a foil to the troublemaking Mickey. Throughout the [[1930]]s, Minnie was a frequent participant in Mickey’s adventures, often serving as a damsel-in-distress whom finds herself kidnapped by [[Pete|Peg-Leg Pete]]. In the [[1940]]s, Minnie was relegated to bit parts in cartoons starring her kitten, [[Figaro]], and Mickey's dog, [[Pluto]]. By the [[1950]]s, she faded into obscurity altogether, and remained dormant for three decades.

Minnie was revitalized with the premiere of the [[1988]] television special ''[[Totally Minnie (television special)|Totally Minnie]]'', her first starring role. Since then, she has endured as one of [[The Walt Disney Company]]’s most popular and significant characters. Typically partnered with Minnie's best friend, [[Daisy Duck]], she has headlined her own cartoons, such as in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'', and ''[[Electric Holiday]]''. [[Paul Rudish]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|series of shorts]] sought to develop Minnie's comedy by highlighting her impulsivity and spunk while maintaining her endearing demeanor.

In [[2018]], Minnie was recognized for her contributions to animation with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Recently, she has also appeared as a fashion icon, appearing at events, such as New York Fashion Week and the Fashion Awards in Los Angeles, in addition to serving as the figurehead of the Rock the Dots apparel and merchandise promotions—inspired by her affinity for polka dots.

==Background==
===Personality===
{{Quote|Just imagine... He'll stride into the room, a light will glow from him. I'll hear music, he'll bring me flowers and he'll sweep me off my feet! And, I'll know he's the one when he makes me laugh.|Minnie dreamily fantasizing of [[Mickey Mouse|her dream lover]], giving an example of her romantic personality.|Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers}} 
Minnie is classy, cheerful, and feminine. She is filled to the brim with love and affection, sweet to nearly everyone she comes across, and can typically see the beauty in most things. Minnie's kindness is sometimes exploited by other characters, but Minnie values her good-natured spirit, as it often brings happiness to others, and is something she strives to accomplish regularly.<ref>"[[Daisy's Big Sale]]"</ref> She is quite empathetic in this regard, to the point where she'll take someone else's problems and seek to rectify it herself, even if that someone may be her enemy.<ref>"[[Sock Burglar]]"</ref>

Intelligent and sophisticated, Minnie often serves as the "voice-of-reason" amongst her friends, specifically in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. In the series, Minnie has repeatedly taken charge of hectic situations, usually as a result of Mickey's inability to handle too much pressure, despite being the co-owner of the club.<ref>"[[Thanks to Minnie]]"</ref> This is so much the case that Minnie became notably offended when Mickey believed she could not handle a task as mundane as traversing through the club's basement (granted, it was an extremely large basement).<ref>"[[Where's Minnie?]]"</ref> Minnie is capable, and even when serving as the "damsel in distress" under the hands of the villainous [[Pete]], Minnie would often retaliate if given the chance, thus assisting Mickey in taking down the villain and saving the day.<ref>''[[Building a Building]]''</ref><ref>"[[Pioneer Days]]"</ref><ref>''[[Get A Horse!]]''</ref> In the series ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'', Minnie would sometimes fall into trouble, to which Mickey would go out of his way to rescue her — by the time he finds her, however, he learns that she was able to handle the situation herself.<ref>"[[Cable Car Chaos]]"</ref><ref>"[[Road Hogs]]"</ref>

Minnie is not without her foibles, however, as she can be passive at times, which forces her to deal with an excessive amount of tomfoolery at the hands of her friends.<ref>"[[Daisy Bothers Minnie]]"</ref><ref>"[[Third Wheel]]"</ref> She can also be extremely stubborn and does not take orders (or even advice) from anyone, always going by her own rules and doing what she believes is best. Though this is a positive trait in that it makes her independent and confident, it also leads her to act rash and compulsive, at least until she realizes the troubles she's caused.<ref>"[[Eau de Minnie]]"</ref><ref>"[[Doggone Biscuits]]"</ref>

Minnie is also outspoken when dealing with adversaries. She is intolerant toward any kind of rudeness or bullying, especially when the bullying is related to misogynistic and prejudiced viewpoints.<ref>"[[Mickey and the Goat Man]]"</ref><ref>"[[No Reservations]]"</ref> And while she can be passive at times, Minnie also has her limits. She has lost her temper numerous times at Daisy for her diva attitude and Mickey for his occasional selfishness.<ref>''[[Runaway Brain]]''</ref><ref>''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas|Belles on Ice]]''</ref> Her aggression is also on regular display when [[Mortimer Mouse]] is involved, as she'll gladly make a fool out of the rodent for his constant harassment.<ref>"[[No]]"</ref>

To her core, Minnie is a lover — of life, nature, her friends, and most significantly Mickey, who serves not only as her boyfriend but also her best friend. As she believes in the "true love" commonly found in fairy tales, Minnie is rather dreamy and whimsical (contrary to her more no-nonsense side), something she is completely unapologetic for.<ref>''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers|The Three Musketeers]]''</ref>

===Physical appearance===
Minnie's trademark outfit is usually a dress revealing her white bloomers with a large matching bow and oversized high heel pumps that all are one color (depending on the cartoon). Like Mickey and [[Goofy]], Minnie also wears white gloves for fashion. Her outfit is sometimes red or pink with white polka dots, other times it has been a blue outfit with a pink bow and shoes. In earlier cartoons, she wore a pillbox hat with a flower in place of her bow. In some cartoons, Minnie wore only a skirt, a bow, bloomers, and her oversized high heels. In [[Eau de Minnie]], it is revealed she is seen wearing a black shirt with her skirt.

===Voice===
In ''Steamboat Willie'', Minnie’s vocal effects were provided by [[Walt Disney]], who also lent his voice to Mickey. In subsequent short films throughout [[1929]], Minnie remained a largely silent character outside of brief vocalizations and one-word pieces of dialogue. Cartoons such as ''[[The Plowboy]]'' featured Minnie singing her signature leitmotif.

When production began for [[1930]]’s ''[[The Cactus Kid]]'', Bert Gillett (a director on many of the short films), visited the Ink and Paint Department and asked if anyone could speak Spanish. [[Marcellite Garner]] answered the call, as did [[Marjorie Ralston]], and both women were taken to the sound stage. They were told that a woman had already been hired to supply Minnie’s speaking voice in the cartoon, and if either artists were interested in auditioning for the the singing part. Ralston opted out of the audition, leaving the role to Garner. Moving forward, Garner would become Minnie’s official voice actress, and would be recognized as the first. Garner played an instrumental role in developing Minnie’s onscreen persona. She imbued the character with a sweetness and emotion that would become a trademark moving forward. Garner also recorded her dialogue regularly with Walt Disney, who continued voicing Mickey after ''Steamboat Willie''. To help Marcellite prepare for the role, Disney would take time from their recording sessions to describe and act out all the parts.<ref>''Working with Walt: Interviews with Disney Artists'', by Don Peri</ref>

Garner would continue to voice Minnie for over forty cartoons while simultaneously working as an ink-and-painter. Garner left the studio in [[1941]] and worked with other animation departments, though she recalled briefly returning to Disney for a recording. Archival recordings of Marcellite’s performances were used for Minnie in the [[2013]] short film ''[[Get a Horse!]]''.

After Garner’s departure, Minnie’s screen presence steadily dwindled. She nevertheless went through several actresses whenever dialogue was needed. From 1941 to [[1942]], and on the radio program, ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]'', she was voiced by [[Thelma Boardman]]. Following this, from 1942 up to [[1952]], [[Ruth Clifford]] provided the character's voice. 

After Disney’s death, [[Janet Waldo]] voiced Minnie in the [[1974]] Disneyland record album, ''[[An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players]]''.<ref>[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mickeys-christmas-carol/ Cartoon Research - "Mickey’s Christmas Carol"]</ref> and Barnette Ricci in ''[[A Magic Kingdom Yuletide Special]]''. In the 1980s, Walt’s nephew [[Roy E. Disney]] felt that each Disney character should have an official voice, to maintain the integrity and consistency of the characters. It was during this period that [[Wayne Allwine]] assumed the role of Mickey, while [[Tony Anselmo]] assumed the role of [[Donald Duck]]. Somewhere between [[1985]] and [[1986]], there was a push to revive Minnie’s character with the television special ''Totally Minnie''. There were roughly 160 people that auditioned for the part, among them being [[Russi Taylor]]. Taylor prepped for the role by listening to voice clips of Minnie from the 30’s and 40’s and creating a combination of the two. Taylor was also asked if she could improvise as Minnie, which prompted her to recite the balcony scene from William Shakespeare’s ''Romeo and Juliet''. Russi Taylor was ultimately chosen for the role, and became Minnie’s official voice actress for decades until her death in [[2019]]. Notable to Russi Taylor’s career, is her marriage to Wayne Allwine. While working on a [[Radio Disney]] project with [[Bill Farmer]], Wayne and Russi spent time after hours to discuss the job and became fast friends. They eventually married in [[1991]], and remained a couple until Allwine's death in [[2009]].<ref>''Walt Disney Treasures'', A Conversation with Russi Taylor and Wayne Allwine: The Voice Behind the Mouse</ref>

After Taylor's passing, [[Kaitlyn Robrock]] assumed the role. Her first performance as Minnie was on two [[Disney Junior]] stop-motion shorts released in November 2019.<ref>https://d23.com/catching-up-with-mickey-and-minnie-a-d23-interview-with-bret-iwan-and-kaitlyn-robrock/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdFGbw5e0LY</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC0Fwv8o5zM</ref> Robrock would continue voicing Minnie in other projects, including ''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]''.

==History==
===1928===
Minnie made her debut when she starred alongside Mickey Mouse in the cartoon short ''[[Plane Crazy]]'', which was screened to test audiences on [[May 15]], 1928. Minnie and Mickey take a flight on the latter's makeshift aircraft. In during which, Mickey repeatedly tries to romance Minnie, but she politely refuses these particular advances.

The next film featuring the couple was ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''. It was the second of their series to be produced but only the third to be released on [[March 14]], [[1929]]. In it, Minnie was employed as the barmaid and dancer of ''Cantina Argentina'', a bar and restaurant established in the ''pampas'' of Argentina. She performs the tango for Mickey the ''gaucho'' and [[Pete|Black Pete]] the outlaw. Both flirt with her, but the latter intends to abduct her while the former obliges in saving the "damsel in distress" from the villain. All three characters acted as strangers first being introduced to each other.

[[File:Mickey and Minnie Steamboat Willie.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Minnie and Mickey in 1928's groundbreaking ''Steamboat Willie''.]]
They appear together again in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', the third short of the series to be produced but released first on [[November 18]], 1928. Pete was featured as the captain of the steamboat, Mickey as a crew of one and Minnie as their single passenger.

The commercial success of ''Steamboat Willie'' helped introduce Mickey and Minnie into the audience. Twelve more films featuring Mickey were produced in 1929, but Minnie only co-starred in seven of them and was mentioned in an eighth.

The first of them was ''[[The Barn Dance]]'', first released on [[December 30]], 1928. Minnie stands at the center of attention as Mickey and Pete rival each other in order to win her favor. Both offer to pick her up for the dance, but she chooses Pete's newly purchased automobile over Mickey's horse-cart. When the automobile breaks down she resorts to going with Mickey. The latter proves a clumsy dancing partner, repeatedly stepping on her feet, and so she turns to Pete again. She is surprised when Mickey asks for another dance and seems to be light on his feet. However, she is disgusted when Pete points that his rival had placed a balloon in his shorts. She resumed dancing with Pete while Mickey is reduced to crying on the dance floor. Minnie proves to be rather demanding as a partner in a romantic relationship. Mickey obviously has yet to claim her as his girlfriend by this point.

===1929-1940===
''[[The Opry House]]'', first released on [[March 28]], [[1929]], was the first short to feature Mickey but not Minnie. A poster, however, mentions Minnie as being a member of the "Yankee Doodle Girls". This later group of female performers remained as unseen characters and were apparently short-lived. Minnie appears again in ''[[When the Cat's Away]]'', first released on [[April 11]], 1929. She is attending a party with Mickey along with several other mice. The short was unusual in the depiction of Mickey and Minnie with the size and part of the behavior common in regular mice. The set standard both before and after this short was to depict them as having the size of a rather short human being.

Minnie was seen again in ''[[The Plowboy]]'', first released on [[May 9]], 1929, where she is featured as a farm girl and gets Mickey to milk her cow [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] for her. When Mickey presents her with a bucket full of milk and proceeds to kiss her, Minnie answers by knocking the bucket on his head. This in front of his horse [[Horace Horsecollar]] who is just making his debut. Minnie obviously was not very appreciative of Mickey's affection at the time.

Their attempt at farming life would prove short-lived. Their next appearance in ''[[The Karnival Kid]]'' ([[May 23]], 1929) cast Mickey as a hot dog vendor and Minnie as a carnival "shimmy" Dancer. Minnie then appears as a fiddle player in ''[[Mickey's Choo-Choo]]'' ([[June 26]], 1929).

[[File:MickeysFolly-YooHoo.jpg|thumb|250px|Minnie giving her signature "yoo-hoo!" in ''Mickey's Follies''.]]
Her next appearance was arguably more significant. ''[[Mickey's Follies]]'' (June 26, 1929), featured the first performance of the song "[[Minnie's Yoo Hoo (song)|Minnie's Yoo Hoo]]". ''"The guy they call little Mickey Mouse"'' for the first time addresses an audience to explain that he has ''"Got a sweetie"'' who is ''"Neither fat nor skinny"'' and proudly proclaims that ''"She's my little Minnie Mouse"''. Mickey then proceeds in explaining his reaction to Minnie's call. The song firmly establishes Mickey and Minnie as a couple and expresses the importance Minnie holds for her partner. The song would go on to become the theme song for their series as well as the theme to a Disney prime-time television series ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (which also featured the song as a recurring theme in many of its shorts).

Minnie was soon shown herself to be the Damsel-in-Distress. In ''[[Wild Waves]]'', Minnie was washed off the beach, but Mickey rescued her. Despite being saved, Minnie was left frightened by the experience, leading her to cry. With Mickey and his sea friends' performance, Minnie finally cheered up and made Mickey her new hero.

Minnie would appear in a number of shorts throughout the 1930s, co-starring alongside Mickey. In [[1935]], she appeared in the short ''[[On Ice]]'', which was her first appearance in a color cartoon. The [[1938]] short ''[[The Fox Hunt]]'' was the final appearance of Minnie's early, Ub Iwerks design in the original theatrical run.

===1940-1990===
[[File:Minnie Mickey's Surprise Party.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Minnie's modern redesign, first seen in ''Mickey's Surprise Party''.]]
In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Minnie was redesigned alongside Mickey, given full eyes, a pear-shaped body as opposed her round body in previous shorts, and a cream face replacing the white tone previously used. The first short to show Minnie's new design was the [[1939]] short ''[[Mickey's Surprise Party]]'', which was one of the few theatrical shorts that focused more on Minnie than Mickey.

Around this time, Mickey became less of a rascally adventurer and more of an Everyman character. As this shift in personality became increasingly utilized by Walt Disney and the animators, Minnie's significance would start to diminish. She would continue to appear sporadically as either Mickey's love interest or a supporting character that sets the plot for other characters, such as Pluto and [[Figaro]] (who famously became her pet cat after his popular demand grew from the [[1940]] animated feature, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''). Her last appearance in the original theatrical run of Disney animated shorts would be a brief cameo at the end of the [[1952]] short ''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]''. In the following decades, Minnie would make occasional appearances on Walt Disney's [[Walt Disney anthology series|television series]] and at the [[Disneyland]] theme park (and later [[Walt Disney World]]) as a mascot alongside Mickey.

After a long hiatus from animated feature films or short films, Minnie would reappear in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' in [[1983]], though in an extremely minor role as the wife of [[Bob Cratchit]] (played by Mickey) as well as a non-speaking appearance.

In [[1988]], Minnie was given her first starring role in the television special, ''[[Totally Minnie (television special)|Totally Minnie]]''. This also marked the debut of [[Russi Taylor]], who would go on to voice Minnie for over three decades. She also made brief appearances in the television special ''[[Mickey's 60th Birthday]]''. Also in 1988, Minnie made a non-speaking appearance as a guest at the 60th Academy Awards ceremony, sitting alongside Donald and Daisy as Mickey announces the winner of Best Animated Short.

===1990-2020===
In [[1995]], Minnie played a more significant role as the co-star in ''[[Runaway Brain]]''. In the short, a monstrous creature called [[Julius]] fell for her, forcing Mickey to come to her rescue.

[[1999]] saw the television premiere of ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', which gave Minnie her first starring role in standalone cartoons. One such cartoon had Mickey once again dreaming that Minnie became his wife (he had dreamed this previously in ''[[Mickey's Nightmare]]'') while the others were having a picnic.

[[File:Minnie EH.jpg|thumb|250px|Minnie in ''Electric Holiday''.]]
Minnie was given a starring role in the [[2012]] animated short, ''[[Electric Holiday]]''. In this story, Minnie spotted a beautiful dress in a store window, and this leads to a daydream where Minnie envisions herself as a prospering supermodel living in the city of [[Paris]]. Fortunately, Mickey just so happens to buy it for her, and she is very happy.

In [[2013]], Minnie appeared in the theatrical short ''[[Get A Horse!]]'', where she had to be rescued by Mickey after being kidnapped by the villainous Pete. The short utilized a combination of archived dialogue from Marcellite Garner and new dialogue courtesy of Russi Taylor. Also in 2013, a new series of ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' shorts premiered, with several episodes starring Minnie in her own solo cartoons.

On [[January 23]], [[2016]], Minnie served as the inspiration for the "Rock the Dots" art and fashion show, taking place in Downtown [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. To coincide with National Polka Dot Day, the interactive exhibit celebrated the aesthetics of Minnie's signature look by displaying an array of apparel designed by various artists around the world, all inspired by Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://style.disney.com/fashion/2016/01/23/go-inside-the-minnie-rocks-the-dots-event/|title=GO INSIDE THE MINNIE ROCKS THE DOTS EVENT|website=Twitter|last=Mynott|first=Nicole|date=August 6, 2016|format=Article|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

On [[September 27]], 2016, Disney released ''[[The Art of Minnie Mouse]]'', a book centering Minnie that features reinterpretations of her character design courtesy of various Disney artists, designers, illustrators, and animators from around the world. The book also features an extensive look at Minnie's filmography with a visual timeline.

On [[June 22]], [[2017]], the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced that Minnie Mouse would receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in [[2018]], forty years after Mickey, and on the year of her 90th anniversary.<ref name="walk">{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-june-jennifer-lawrence-mark-hamill-minnie-1498167998-htmlstory.html|title=Jennifer Lawrence, Mark Hamill, Minnie Mouse, Bernie Mac among 2018 Walk of Fame inductees|website=Los Angeles Times|date=June 22, 2017|format=Article|author=Saad, Nardine}}</ref> The star was implemented on January 22, 2018, and is located at 6835 Hollywood Boulevard in front of the [[El Capitan Theatre]].

===2020-present===
In January [[2020]], Disney launched ''Positively Minnie'', a web series centered on Minnie’s daily life, using recycled art and animation from Paul Rudish’s ''Mickey Mouse'' shorts. Two months later on [[March 4]], Minnie headlined the very first ''Mickey Mouse''-themed dark ride in the Disney theme parks’ history, with the opening of [[Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

==Film appearances==
===''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]''===
[[File:19509-28638 - Copy (2).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Minnie in ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas''.]]
In ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'', Minnie is Mickey's hard-working girlfriend who, despite her hard work, is in debt with bills and tries not to let Mickey know. She works a large store owned by Mortimer Mouse. She plans to use her Christmas bonus to buy a gift for Mickey, but she ends up receiving a fruitcake. She ends up trading her prized watch for a case for Mickey's beloved harmonica, but Mickey trades his harmonica for a chain for Minnie's watch. In the end, though, they realize their love is enough and they enjoy Christmas together.

===''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]''===
[[File:threemusketeers 160.jpg|thumb|250px|Minnie in ''The Three Musketeers''.]]
In the [[2004]] direct-to-video movie ''Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers'', Minnie plays the role of the ruling princess of [[France]] (and likely the daughter of [[Wikipedia:Louis XIII|King Louis XIII]] and [[Wikipedia:Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]], since this film can be considered a sequel to the original ''[[Wikipedia:The Three Musketeers|Three Musketeers]]'' story), who continually daydreams about finding her true love, who turns out to be Mickey. She's also the only monarch getting in the way of the plans of Pete, who cannot take over the kingdom if he cannot get rid of her. Interestingly, for this particular film, Minnie is drawn with hair bangs, which do not appear in any later cartoons.

In this film, Princess Minnie wants nothing more than to find her true love in life, however, she must put this dream on hold after she escapes a murder plot by the [[Beagle Boys]]. She demands that her captain of the musketeers Pete, find her bodyguards. Unknowing to Minnie, Pete is the mastermind behind the murder plot and desires to rule France as king. To avoid a threat to his plan, Pete hires three janitors, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, to be the musketeer bodyguards, believing they'll do a terrible job. Minnie then quickly falls in love with Mickey as soon as she sees him. After being rescued from a kidnapping scheme, Mickey and Minnie embrace their forbidden love on an evening date across the kingdom. That night, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are kidnapped by Pete and his minions. The next night, Minnie and Daisy head over to the Grand Opera. There, she learns Pete's plans and is captured. However, over the course of the show, Minnie and Daisy are rescued. Minnie is surprised that Daisy is kissing a commoner (Donald) and the two agree as she kisses her new lover. Minnie dubs the trio royal musketeers and presumably marries Mickey afterward.

[[File:Twiceuponaxmas 039.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Minnie as she appears in ''Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas''.]] 
In ''Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas'', Minnie and [[Daisy]] enter an ice skating competition. While excited, Minnie is concerned with the fact that she may not be as good as the other contestants. Minnie begins her performance, with the [[Alligators (Fantasia)|alligators]] from ''[[Fantasia]]'' to assist her, and is quickly praised. Daisy becomes jealous and jumps in to steal the spotlight. To further her performance, Daisy has the [[Hippos (Fantasia)|hippos]] from ''Fantasia'' to assists her. A rival battle follows. Eventually, Daisy pulls off an impressive stunt. Minnie decides to do her own, but she nearly injures herself in the process when she slipped on a bell. Daisy rushes to her side to comfort her friend. Minnie soon realized how foolish they've been acting from the start. They make up and finish the performance together in a grand finale.

In Mickey and Pluto's segment, Minnie hopes Mickey decides to pull off a simple Christmas party instead of overdoing it like he does every year. When Pluto goes missing, Minnie is the first to be notified. She takes the news to her friends including Scrooge McDuck who volunteers to buy a snow plow company to search the city for Pluto. Minnie, Scrooge, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, Max, Huey, Dewey, and Louie spend the entire day searching in the snow plow. In the end, they reach Mickey's house where Pluto has been found. They all enter the house to sing a carol and celebrate their special Christmas.

===Other films===
Although Minnie did not officially appear in ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', a scene with her, as [[Happy Valley]]'s queen, was planned to be included in the ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' segment before the decision was made to drop it from the film. In the scene, Mickey came before her to sell her his cow and in exchange, she gave him the magic beans.

In the live-action/animated hybrid film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', Minnie made a small non-speaking cameo appearance at the very end of the film with [[Mickey]] and a crowd of many other cartoon characters. (Russi Taylor recorded dialogue but it was cut at the last minute.)

==Television appearances==
===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===
[[File:Mickey's Mistake - Minnie with the new bow.png|thumb|250px|Minnie in ''Mickey Mouse Works''.]]
In ''Mickey Mouse Works'', she finally appeared in her own segments and cartoons. Here, she is portrayed as Mickey's intelligent, mature, and beloved girlfriend. Occasionally, she starred in the "Maestro Minnie" shorts, and she dressed in a tuxedo, in which she conducts an orchestra of living instruments that she usually has to tame. In most of her starring cartoons, Minnie would be paired up with Daisy who, in contrast to her, is very wacky and talkative. Some of her other cartoons would involve her getting into her own mischief, such as when she accidentally turned Pluto's fur purple with dye. When she appeared in Mickey's cartoons, she was often the main subject with Mickey usually trying to find grand ways to impress her. She was also the focus in most cartoons with Mortimer Mouse. She also co-starred with Mickey in his short segments "Mickey to the Rescue" where she plays the role of some of her early cartoons: getting kidnapped by Pete, taken to his lair, and being rescued by Mickey.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:Minniehm.png|thumb|left|250px|Minnie as she appeared in ''House of Mouse''.]]

Unfortunately, Minnie is correct and the club is taken over by the [[Disney Villains]]. During their reign, Minnie threatens the leader [[Jafar]] to leave the club and change it back to normal, but this backfires when Captain Hook throws her out. After Mickey saves the day, Minnie and the others celebrate.

===''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''===
[[File:Minnie render.PNG|left|220px]]
Along with the rest of the gang, Minnie returns in the animated series. Like many of Mickey's classic shorts of the 1920s and 1930s, Minnie proves to be the driving force of some of Mickey's wacky adventures. She is the only character to star in her own shorts without even the presence or mention of Mickey. The song "[[Minnie's Yoo Hoo (song)|Minnie's Yoo Hoo]]" serves as Minnie's theme throughout the series, and more specifically in her standalone episodes.

She played her first active role in "[[Cable Car Chaos]]", where she and Mickey are exploring [[San Francisco]] until a runaway cable car spoils the day, forcing Minnie to save herself and the other passengers.

Minnie plays her first role as the protagonist in "[[Eau de Minnie]]", where a special perfume Minnie obsesses over enchants the entire city.

Minnie also stars, alongside Pluto, in the episode "[[Doggone Biscuits]]", where she recklessly feeds the latter a bag of fattening dog treats despite Mickey's warnings, resulting in Pluto becoming massive in weight. For the remainder of the episode, Minnie tries to restore Pluto's health and figure. She also reveals that she used to be overweight herself before going into a sauna.

In "[[Sock Burglar]]", Minnie took the lead by appointing herself responsible for uncovering a mysterious series of thefts involving missing socks. She turns herself into a detective, and later a ninja, eventually discovering the thief to be Pete.

In "[[No Reservations]]", Minnie, Daisy, and Clarabelle butt heads with a snooty maitre d', who viewed the trio as too uncultured to be allowed entry into his restaurant, despite Minnie having made reservations far in advance.

In "[[Carried Away]]", Minnie sings Mickey a song for him while he saves them from a series of obstacles.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]''===
In the series, Minnie is an employee of Mickey's local car garage in Hot Dog Hills. Her transforming roadster is known as "Pink Thunder", which was designed to pay tribute to her bow. Outside of the races, Minnie and Daisy star in their own series of exploits as they try to run the "Happy Helpers" hotline business, with Pink Thunder transforming into the group's main mode of transport.

==Trivia==
*Like Mickey, Minnie's ears always face the same way, no matter which direction she is facing.
*According to [[Mortimer Mouse]], Minnie is his former girlfriend who left him.
*When ''Wheel of Fortune'' hostess Vanna White hosted while host Pat Sajak was recovering from emergency surgery, Mickey and Minnie helped out.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbZ9pfYH-Lk]</ref>
*Minnie is occasionally cited as an unofficial member of the [[Disney Princesses]] and has been included in some of the franchise's material.
*The comic strip story ''The Gleam'' by Merrill De Maris and [[Floyd Gottfredson]] first gave her full name as '''Minerva Mouse'''. "Minerva" has since been a recurring alias for her. In the French translations, Minerva is actually her middle name, making her full name Minnie Minerva Mouse; in that case, Minnie is one of the two Disney icons to have officially a middle name (the other being [[Donald Duck]], whose full name has been revealed to be Donald Fauntleroy Duck).
*Minnie appeared in concept art for ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', but did not appear in the actual game herself (nor is she ever mentioned by Mickey). There was also no mention of her in ''[[Epic Mickey 2]]'', but she did appear in ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'' and appeared in one of the projectors at the end of the second Epic Mickey.
*According to Walt Disney, Mickey and Minnie Mouse have never been married on screen. But, in [[1933]], during an interview with Film Pictorial, Walt said, "In private life, Mickey is married to Minnie... What it really amounts to is that Minnie is, for screen purposes, his leading lady."
*Minnie's eyes are usually longer and wider than Mickey's, while her smile is slightly shorter and more closed than his. However, these details were not used in the earliest cartoon and some comic stories.
*In the popular [[ABC]] television series ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', several figurines of Minnie and Mickey can be seen, most notably in Mr. Gold's pawn shop.
*Minnie was used along with Mickey in a [[1930]] Aesop's Fables cartoon called "The Office Boy" and again in a [[1931]] Aesop's Fables cartoon called "Red Riding Hood" after Walt Disney admitted influence from this cartoon series which had been around even before Mickey was even created. But Walt sued its creator Paul Terry for "plagiarizing" his character which led to Aesop's Fables ending in 1933.
*It has been officially stated that Minnie shares the same birthday as Mickey Mouse ([[November 18]]). However, this is debatable, as numerous stories that take place on Mickey's birthday do not mention that it is also Minnie's birthday, and vice-versa.
*In Japanese Disney theme parks, it is more likely to find Minnie Mouse ears instead of Mickey Mouse ears.
*Minnie has over two-hundred outfits.
*Mickey, or Michael, means "the one who is like God", and Minnie or Minerva was the name of a Roman "goddess". This remarkable coincidence is, however, likely unforeseen.
*She is one of the few Disney characters to have received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Oh My Disney|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/news/2017/06/22/minnie-mouse-mark-hamill-zoe-saldana-lin-manuel-miranda-and-more-will-receive-stars-on-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame/|title=Minnie Mouse, Mark Hamill, Zoe Saldana, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and More Will Receive Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|author=Valerio, Brit}}</ref> The other Disney characters that received Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame include [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tinker Bell]] and [[Snow White]].
*[[Bob Iger]] once referred to Minnie as "the official First Lady of the Walt Disney company".<ref name="star" />
*Though Minnie does not appear in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'', she is briefly mentioned by Daisy in the episode "[[Mexico à Go-Go]]".
*[[Russi Taylor]]'s co-stars [[Bill Farmer]], [[Tony Anselmo]] and [[Tress MacNeille]] have revealed that after the passing of her then-husband [[Wayne Allwine]] in 2009, she had a very difficult time providing the voice of Minnie on various Mickey Mouse-related projects for a short period. She eventually recovered in the later years of her life.
