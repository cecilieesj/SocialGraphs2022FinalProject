'''Jessica Drew''', better known by her superhero alias '''[[Spider-Woman]]''', is a character created by [[Marvel Comics]]. When she was a young girl, Jessica suffered from uranium poisoning, prompting her geneticist father to use an experimental serum based on spider venom to save her. Having been put in stasis, she eventually awoke in the present day, where after briefly working for [[HYDRA]], she set off to become a superhero.

Jessica Drew was originally created by Archie Goodwin.

==Appearances==
===''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''===
Spider-Woman was one of the many superheroes to join forces with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to stop the various villain of the Marvel Universe from acquiring the mysterious substance known as Isotope-8. During the "Trial By Fire" event, she is temporarily possessed by the villain Kuurth after coming into contact with the Hammer of Kuurth.

===''[[Marvel: Future Fight]]''===
Similarly to ''Avengers Alliance'', Spider-Woman is one of the many superheroes (and villains) to join forces, this time to stop an impending apocalypse warned by a future version of [[Nick Fury]].

===''[[Disney Tsum Tsum]]''===
Spider-Woman is one of the many Marvel characters to make an appearance in ''[[Disney Tsum Tsum]]''. Specifically, she is considered part of the "Marvel's Women of Power" lineup.

==Trivia==
*Although Jessica Drew herself has yet to appear in any Disney-produced products (not counting ''Disney Tsum Tsum''), there have been other individuals who have gone by the name "Spider-Woman" who have been featured:
**[[Spider-Gwen]] is a version of Gwen Stacy from an alternate reality where she was the one who was bitten by the radioactive spider instead of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], becoming Spider-Woman.
**In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Peter's love interest [[Mary Jane Watson]] became Spider-Woman by gaining a hold of the [[Carnage]] symbiote.
