'''Molly Hopps''' is a character featured in the [[Disney+]] original series ''[[Zootopia+]]''.

==Background==
Molly serves as one of [[Bonnie and Stu Hopps]]' children serving as their youngest daughter. As a toddler, Molly doesn't talk much and says limited words and mostly babbling.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Hopp on Board]]", [[Bonnie and Stu Hopps]] notice their baby Molly on the train, much to their worry, which Bonnie tells her husband to be on the lookout for Molly to make sure she is safe. Molly then enters the train where [[Judy Hopps|Judy]] is listening to her favorite song "[[Try Everything]]" performed by [[Gazelle]] which Bonnie tells her husband to get the car keys ready to rescue Molly, but Stu drops his car keys into  a drain, so Bonnie thinks of an alternate solution to start the engine and save Molly. This leads Bonnie and Stu Hopps on a chase to find Molly, rescue her, and make sure she is safe. Meanwhile, Molly then wanders around the train while not noticing a passenger about to sit on their seat while continuing to wander around the train not noticing any dangers nearby, albeit without getting any injuries. 

Seeing Molly on the train at [[Rainforest District]], Stu suddenly approaches Judy who is listening to "Try Everything" on her phone, telling her to take off her earbuds so she can listen to him and keep an eye on Molly to help her stay focused while Bonnie catches up with Stu which the two find themselves in [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]]. The train suddenly stops at Zootopia while Bonnie notices Molly getting off the train trying to catch up with Judy, just as Bonnie launches Stu to rescue Molly. As Stu sees Molly on the train station, a beaver slaps Molly with its tail causing Molly to fall into the area where another train arrives which Stu suddenly rescues her from falling and getting hit by the train, just as Molly reunites with her parents. However, Molly suddenly appears on top of the train again, leading Bonnie and Stu Hopps to rescue Molly again on the train leading to [[Bunnyburrow]].

==Trivia==
*Molly's voice actress, [[Katie Lowes]], also voiced [[Dr. Badger]] from the original ''[[Zootopia]]'' film.
