'''Dr. Rhoda Dendron''' is a colleague of [[Bushroot|Dr. Reginald Bushroot]] who works at St. Canard University.

Rhoda was the only person at the university who was nice to Bushroot, often coming to his defense whenever he was being bullied by fellow scientists Dr. Gary and Dr. Larson. Bushroot often misinterpreted her actions as proof that she had a romantic interest in him, and he felt entitled to have her.

==Role in the series==
In the episode "[[Beauty and the Beet]]", Bushroot kidnaps Rhoda from the university and spirits her away to his greenhouse hideout. He plans to use his plant transformation process to mutate her into a plant-duck hybrid like himself, so that she can be his bride, but [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing]] and [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]] intervene before the process can be completed.

It remains unknown what became of Rhoda afterwards, because Bushroot never tried to contact Rhoda ever again.

==Trivia==
*Her name is a play on the flower Rhododendron.
