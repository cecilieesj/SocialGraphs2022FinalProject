==Background==
Mr. Skipperdoo is a pink, non-speaking rabbit who wears glasses. He is [[Bob Parr|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Lucius Best|Frozone's]] sidekick (though not actually seen doing any superhero work, but instead alerting the duo of any trouble ahead).

==Role in the short film==
In the cartoon, Mr. Skipperdoo is first seen alongside Frozone and Mr. Incredible. Despite him not having any speaking lines, he does alert the heroes by hopping up and down when he senses something unusual. He then alerts Mr. Incredible and Frozone about an unusual radioactive river linked to Lady Lightbug. In the abandoned carnival, Skipperdoo and two of the superheroes arrive to find and defeat Lightbug before she terrorizes the city. During investigation, Skipperdoo then alerts the heroes that he found a missing part of the West River bridge just as Lady Lightbug emerges from her lair. Ultimately, Skipperdoo last appears watching over the missing bridge finally in its right spot alongside Mr. Incredible and Frozone after defeating Lightbug.

In the optional commentary, Frozone is easily annoyed by him while recording a commentary for the cartoon with Mr. Incredible. According to the commentary, Mr. Skipperdoo was added to the cartoon to appeal to children, and does nothing but hop up and down.
