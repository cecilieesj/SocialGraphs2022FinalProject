[[File:char_56087.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Turquesa''' is a [[Gargoyle (creature)|gargoyle]] member of the [[Mayan Clan]]. Her name is derived from the pendant she wears. She is voiced by Marabina Jaimes.

==History==
===Past===
Turquesa and the three other pendant-bearers were away from the pyramid in [[1993]] when someone attacked the clan, smashing the sleeping gargoyles and looting the pyramid. When she and the others returned, they vowed never to leave the pyramid unguarded again.

===Present===
In [[1996]], Cyberbiotics began to encroach on the Mayan Clan's territory, bringing Turquesa into direct conflict with them. [[Preston Vogel]] hired Jackal and [[Hyena (Gargoyles)|Hyena]] to remove the gargoyles by any means necessary. When the [[Avalon]] Travelers arrived, [[Zafiro]] enlisted their help in defending their territory.

After the Mayan Clan and their new allies had defeated [[Jackal]] and Hyena, [[Elisa Maza|Elisa]] took [[Jade]] and Turquesa to [[Avalon]] to transplant some rare rain-forest plants.

==Characteristics==
Like most Mayan gargoyles, Turquesa has black hair and a large crest on her forehead. She has the most common type of gargoyle wing (similar to Goliath's) and has turquoise and blue coloring. Perhaps her most unusual feature is that each of her elbows and knees sport several spikes.
