===''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]''===
No sooner than [[King Triton]] beached [[Ariel]] and [[King Triton's Daughters|Arista]] (for arguing) banning them from going to the Carnival of Tides. [[Sebastian]], of course, is then assigned to be their babysitter.        
The Gators arrive. Specifically, Flo and Ebb Gator, freshwater thieves. Their target is the royal treasure, left unguarded in the absence of King Triton's [[Trident (The Little Mermaid)|trident]]. Ariel and Arista quickly develop a truce; the Gators are the biggest threat, not each other. If they work together, they can stop the fiends from reaching the royal treasure. Oh, and Sebastian helps too.

==Trivia==
*Their characterizations as well as their plan to rob Atlantica palace were most likely a reference to Marv and Harry, the two main antagonists from ''[[wikipedia:Home Alone|Home Alone]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Home Alone 2: Lost in New York|Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]''.
*Given their numerous pet-names and certain interactions between them during the episode they appear in, they're most likely husband and wife.
*Because they are actually part of the Alligator and Crocodile family, real Alligators and Crocodiles couldn't really live in Open Oceans. As the TV Show and Film series are set in Denmark, Scandinavia, Alligators and Crocodiles can't reach the destination as it'll be too cold in climate.
