'''Lucky''' is one of the most prominently known of the [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]] from [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]]'s [[1961]] film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]].'' Lucky is named both for the horseshoe pattern of spots on his back, and for being the “runt” of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]’s litter.

==Background==

===Personality===
Like all of the puppies, Lucky is playful and sweet. The weakest of the puppies, he is quite meek and shy, tiring easily. He seems to have a slight sibling rivalry with the more insecure and rambunctious [[Patch]], with both of them sharing the spot closest to the TV and occasionally vying for a larger amount of it. The two of them are also somewhat opposites of one another, yet share similar interests (such as TV and idolizing Thunderbolt). While Patch is loud, energetic, rambunctious, and introverted, Lucky is arrogant and extroverted.

Despite being so starkly different from his brother Patch, he seems to be closest to him. It's Lucky, for example, who comforts Patch in Cruella's warehouse when the latter blames himself for their predicament.

==Appearances==
===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===
[[File:101-dalmatians-disneyscreencaps.com-5853.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Lucky in ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians''.]]
Lucky is one of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita|Perdita's]] [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]]. He is the puppy who nearly dies soon after his birth in both the animated and live-action films but was revived through the efforts of [[Roger Radcliffe]]. (It should be noted that, in the original book, [[Cadpig]] was the puppy who almost died.) Afterward, he was one of the weakest puppies and was a rival to the more active [[Patch]]. Lucky is usually seen sitting in front of the television and has a tendency to stand in front of it. In general, he is seen to be more of a follower than a leader.

When Perdita and Pongo were leading the 99 puppies back home, Pongo often carried Lucky by the collar. Lucky tired easily, and suffered from the cold. In Dinsford, while the family was hiding in a building, Lucky got in an argument with Patch and ended up being covered in soot. This gave Pongo the idea of hiding from [[Cruella De Vil]] by disguising themselves as Labradors, by way of rolling in soot to hide their white fur. Though most of the puppies were able to successfully get to a van headed to London, a pile of snow fell on Lucky, revealing the disguise.

But Pongo grabs him by the neck and enter the truck before being reached by Jasper and Horace. And finally, after a chase by Cruella, Jasper, and Horace, Lucky, his brothers, sisters, and parents manage to return home to Roger and Anita's house.

===[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|''101 Dalmatians'' (1996)]]===
Lucky is one of the puppies that appears in the live-action film ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''. Like in the animated film, the young puppy nearly dies soon after birth, but [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]] is able to revive him. Roger, [[Nanny]], and [[Anita Radcliffe|Anita]] choose to name him Lucky because of his survival. Lucky is shown to live up to his name, as he is often seen to get out of tough situations just by sheer luck.

When Lucky and his siblings are later kidnapped by [[Jasper and Horace]] and taken to [[Hell Hall|De Vil Manor]], an Airedale terrier named [[Kipper]] arrives and helps the Dalmatians escape De Vil Manor; however, Lucky was sleeping in the study, almost being left behind. He later wakes up and tries to escape; however, he is unable to make it out the door. Soon after, [[Mr. Skinner|Skinner]], Cruella's furrier, arrives and attempts to grab Lucky; however, Kipper arrives (limping having been pushed off the roof by Jasper) and attacks Skinner, saving Lucky.

When the police find the Dalmatians, they count up as one hundred overall; however, when Perdita barks, notifying them of Kipper arriving with Lucky, they mark it as "one hundred and one Dalmatians."

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
[[File:Lucky NTCCSTFTDL.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lucky as he appeared in the animated series.]]
Lucky is one of the main characters in the animated series. Unlike the films, his name is instead due to the horseshoe-shaped marks on his back. Also in contrast to his characterization in the films, Lucky is said to be the most adventurous of the pups and is described as a canine Tom Sawyer. He does retain his love of television. He functions as the leader of a small group that includes himself, his siblings [[Cadpig]] and [[Rolly]], and their chicken friend, [[Spot]]. He is said to be Roger's favorite puppy, a status that he covets. Also, he went on a date with his sister Two-Tone, as shown in episode 2b, and had a brief relationship with another Dalmatian, [[Rebecca]]. He is the only character in the series to be voiced by two voice actresses: Pamela Adlon (who was also the voice of [[Ashley Spinelli]] on ''[[Recess]]'' and the voice of [[Vidia]] of the [[Disney Fairies]]) for the most part, and Debbie Mae West whenever Pamela Adlon was unavailable.

===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===
Lucky plays a secondary role in the film's 2003 sequel. Like in the original film, he is weak and worrisome in contrast to most of his siblings. He is kidnapped again by Cruella De Vil but rescued by his brother [[Patch]] and was amazed by everything that Patch did. Unlike his usual appearances, he has white ears as opposed to black.

===Other appearances===
Lucky makes a few cameos in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', but like his siblings, they all remained non-speaking. During most of his scenes, Lucky's back was turned to reveal the horseshoe on his back to the viewers.

Lucky and [[Freckles]] also starred in [[Disney Junior]] shorts that play during commercial breaks. These scenes feature non-speaking Dalmatians and are often accompanied by musical narration.

==Video games==
===''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]''===
Lucky, along with several of the movie pups, appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' on Playstation 2. Although the pups in the chests scattered throughout the game are generic-looking, pictures of the pups (and Pongo and Perdita) can be seen in the Dalmatian house in Traverse Town. He is also easily identified after being rescued and returned to his parents as he will be the puppy with his front paws up against the television, with his trademark horseshoe of spots clearly visible.

===''[[Disney Th!nk Fast]]''===
[[File:Lucky HHLIDTFDLDLDLDLDL.png|thumb|250px|Lucky in ''Disney Th!nk Fast''.]]
In the "Regents Park" setting, Lucky acts as one of the guest hosts in which he appears in one round to ask the players questions on ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.

===''[[Animated StoryBook: 101 Dalmatians]]''===
Lucky appears playing as one of the narrators of the story. He takes over as narrator on page 5 (of course, his mother appears first, but he tells her off-screen he wants to narrate that part) and for the rest of the story starting on page 7. He also does the off-screen poems of certain vocabulary terms on every page, including any he doesn't narrate.

==Trivia==
*Lucky is the only character in the series to be regularly voiced by two voice actresses: [[Pamela Adlon]] (who was also the voice of [[Ashley Spinelli]] on ''[[Recess]]'' and the voice of [[Vidia]] of the [[Disney Fairies]]) for the most part, and [[Debi Mae West]] whenever Pamela Aldon was unavailable.

*The film version of Lucky also possesses a horseshoe-shaped spot pattern on his back; however, it is more subtle than his television counterpart and is only obvious in a few scenes.

*[[Kevin Corcoran]] was considered to voice Lucky.
*At the end of the movie, after returning home, Lucky has somehow lost his collar. This could be an animation mistake.
