He is designed to publicly humiliate victims by pulling down their pants (hence the name Lo-Rider). Jumba would often release him in crowds and meetings. He appears in ''[[Stitch!]]''.

==Background==
Experiment 047 was the 47th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to yank down people's pants, causing humiliation to the victim. 047 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba on his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

===Personality===
Lorider delights in humiliating people, and he won't stop embarrassing them until he gets the full effect. He also acts somewhat like a dog, sniffing the target before embarrassing them.

===Physical appearance===
Lorider is a blue platypus-like experiment with small eyes and a purple accordion-like body.

===Powers and abilities===
Lorider can extend his accordion-like body to stretch up to someone's waist, and then he pulls down their pants.

Lorider makes quacking noises when he jumps, stretches, or walks.

==Appearances==
===''[[Stitch!]]''===
In "Stitch's Birthday, Part One", Lorider was activated, pulled a public speaker's pants down, and when the speaker pulled them up and started to run, Lorider tripped him. Lorider then pulled down the pants of various participants until he was eventually captured by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]].

==Trivia==
*His name in [[Japan]]ese is ローライダー, which translates directly to Lowrider (a literal translation of its name).
*Lorider's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue.
*Lorider greatly resembles [[Perry the Platypus]] from ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.
