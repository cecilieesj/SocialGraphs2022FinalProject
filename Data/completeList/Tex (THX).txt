'''Tex''' is a CGI animated robot character who wears a jet pack and red armor. Although he did not appear in a [[Pixar]] feature or short film, he was created by [[John Lasseter]] for [[Lucasfilm]]'s [[THX]] sound system, which partnered with and certified Pixar films from [[1996]] to [[2006]]. He appeared in some THX trailers. The first one was released in 1996. A second trailer was released in [[1997]] and a third one was released in [[2006]]. Tex even appears in the Genesis trailer from [[2019]] and the Tex VS The Robot trailer from [[2020]]. While he does not have any comprehensible dialogue, his occasional grunts and muffles were provided by Lasseter.

==Biography==
Since the audience has been listening to the same THX trailer for over 10 years, Lucasfilm decided it was time for a new sound and look. So in [[1995]], the company hired Pixar Animation Studios to update the sound system promo and better reveal the capabilities of THX sound. Pixar came up with Tex, a digital repairman with a special toolkit and jetpack, charged with taking care of the THX logo and sound system. Tex flies around the theater fixing the speakers, demonstrating THX digital sound in action. The original Tex trailer premiered on time with the release of 20th Century Fox's ''Independence Day'' on July 3, 1996.

==Physical appearance==
Tex is a stout robot with red and silver armor, a jet pack, toolkit, baseball cap, antenna, and a black mustache. He is always busy and hard-working.
