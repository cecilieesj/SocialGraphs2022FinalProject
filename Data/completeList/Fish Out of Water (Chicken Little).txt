'''Fish Out of Water''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2005]] animated feature film ''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Fish, as his name suggests, is a goldfish who wears a scuba helmet filled with water and lives on the surface.

===Personality===
Unable to speak properly, he instead makes gurgling sounds and acts out what he is feeling, which, while incomprehensible to viewers, can be understood by the other characters just fine. He isn't very shy around others, and will perform brave stunts without fear.

==Role in the film==
Fish is first seen at school at his desk when Master Woolensworth asks if he is present, and he confirms it. He is then seen in the gym playing dodgeball, during which he collects magazines to build a paper skyscraper and pretends to be Godzilla, and then tries to protect Little alongside Abby and Runt from Goosey Loosey, who ends up flooding the gym. Chicken Little then signs up for baseball, after which he, along with Abby and Runt, train him to become a champion, with him even pretending to be a super fan when it's Chicken Little's turn to play. When he wins a game for the team by getting the a hit and making it all the way to home base, Fish exalts enthusiastically for the victory.

When something that looks like an octagon-shaped piece of sky crashes into Chicken Little's room, he calls Abby, Runt and Fish to talk to them about it since it's the same object that hit him a year ago. Fish plays with the object, but accidently turns it on while he's on top of it, which causes it to start up and fly out the window with him on it and reconnect with an invisible object that it came from. In a panic, the three chase Fish's light to the baseball field where an alien spaceship lands. Runt is convinced that the aliens have killed Fish, but he is seen through a window alive and well. When they reunite, the four find a map of the solar system that looks like the aliens want to invade the Earth and the four flee with the aliens at their heels, unaware that their son is following them. Fish, along with Abby and Runt, help Little to reach the school bell and alarm the city, but the aliens flee so quickly due to hating the noise that he isn't able to show them proof. Little tries to desperately detail the experience and his friends vouch for his claims, but without success.

The next day, Fish and the others try to console Little, but they all get scared when they discover Kirby. However, Fish is able to understand him and calms everyone down while he talks to Kirby, and finds out from him that he's the lost child of the alien couple they just encountered. At that moment, the aliens invade Oakey Oaks, and Abby, Runt and Fish try to explain the truth to Buck Cluck while Little looks after Kirby. Later, when the aliens are invading Oakey Oaks, Fish, Runt, and Abby are later seen trying to get Buck's attention when Chicken Little tries to tell him the truth about his discovery. When Chicken Little and his father plan to bring Kirby back to his parents. Eventually, Fish, Runt, and Abby manage to rescue Buck and Little from the ground troops surrounding them as they plan to reunite Kirby with his parents.

Later when the aliens restore Oakey Oaks back to normal, Fish, Abby, and Little are surprised when they see that Foxy has become kinder and more feminine as a result of her brainwaves getting scrambled upon being brought back. During the end of the film, Fish and the citizens are watching a movie about Chicken Little where they seen a future version of Fish talking to a future version of Chicken Little about an alien invasion in the planet's atmosphere. When the move ends, he and the other citizens like the movie they saw, making Chicken Little popular again. Fish is later seen during the credits singing the closing song [[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]], though only vocalizing the lyrics.

==Trivia==
*[[Dan Molina]] performed the "voice" for Fish by vocalizing through a tube into a water cooler tank full of water.
*Only his friends [[Abby Mallard|Abby]], [[Runt of the Litter|Runt]], and [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]] can understand what he's saying. To everyone else, it sounds like "Glub!"
*At one point during the scene where Chicken Little is at the Oakey Oaks Middle School gym, Fish stands on the Empire State Building made of paper and does a spoof of King Kong, a reference to the classic ''King Kong'' film. After Fish falls off the "building", Runt comments "'Twas beauty that killed the beast", a nod to the line from the [[Wikipedia:King Kong (1933 film)|classic King Kong]], though misquoted.
