'''Weebette''' is a minor character in Disney's ''[[Flubber]]''. She only appeared at the end, as the daughter of [[Weebo]], who unlike the latter, is very sarcastic around the humans, to the point of insulting [[Flubber (character)|Flubber]]. Weebette was voiced by the voice actress Julie Morrison.

==Appearance==
Weebette was created from blueprints designed by [[Weebo]]. As such, she can be considered a streamlined version of her mother. She is mainly red with a similar LCD screen.

==Personality==
Unlike her mother, Weebette behaves like a teenage girl with a bad attitude and can rant on but is helpful just like her mother.

She's very sarcastic around humans, though, she once referred Sara Jean Reynolds as "Mother", since she was made from Sara's husband, Philip Brainard, implying she refers him as "Father".

Also, despite Flubber being friends with her father and late mother, Weebo, Weebette thinks he's gross, and sees him as a brother.
