==Role in the series==
Flip first appears with [[Oona]], [[Sven (Sofia the First)|Sven]], [[Slim (Sofia the First)|Slim]], [[Fluke]], and [[Shelly (Sofia the First)|Shelly]] during a game of Capture the Conch which Fluke wins. Suddenly, a ship that Oona identifies as the Floating Palace appears at the surface, to Oona's delight. Oona tells them the [[Floating Palace]] belongs to [[Sofia the First (character)|Princess Sofia]], her human friend, and her family, the Royal Family of [[Enchancia]], and swims off with Sven.

Oona and Sven later come back with Sofia, who Flip is delighted to meet because of her magical abilities and her heroics during her last visit. His delight is intensified after Oona tells him that Sofia's family is throwing a party for everyone in the colony. He decides to play one of the band's songs for Sofia's family as thanks.

The band is playing one of their songs for Sofia when Slim comes over and says Fluke's in trouble. Sure enough, they find Fluke stuck in a giant clam. They get him out, but Flip's mantacorn horn gets broken in the process, to his dismay. Fluke swims off to get a new horn from the mantacorn's cave with Sofia and Oona going after him to keep him safe. Flip and Shelly later arrive at the cave where they learn the mantacorn loves music. He and the band later play their song for Sofia's family.
