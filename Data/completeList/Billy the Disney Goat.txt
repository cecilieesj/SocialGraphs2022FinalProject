'''Billy the Disney Goat''' is a character found at all four incarnations of [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]].
He was named and given a personality for a [[2013]] marketing campaign for [[Walt Disney World]] where he desired an opportunity to leave the attraction and explore the resort for himself.

== Appearances ==

=== [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]] ===
Billy is one of the many animatronic animals populating [[Big Thunder Mountain]], perched on one of the hoodoos and chewing a stick of dynamite, bleating at passing trains near the top of the second lift hill.

At the [[Magic Kingdom]], Billy is located on one of the rooftops of the town of [[Tumbleweed]]. In [[Disneyland Paris]], he is joined by another goat chewing on a clothesline. Billy is central to a [[Disneyland]] guest past time known as the "Goat Trick", where turning your head to stare back at the goat as you drop results in feeling a greater sense of disorientation.

=== [[Jessie's Critter Carousel]] ===
A cartoonish depiction of the goat appears in the art for this attraction in [[Pixar Pier]]. It is made to resemble one of the animals from [[Woody's Roundup]] and has a fleecy hide like a ram and is chewing dynamite atop a butte.

== Other Appearances ==

=== Television ===

==== [[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]] ====
The Disney Goat makes a cameo in the "[[Nature's Wonderland]]" episode of ''Mickey Mouse'', which homages [[Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland]].

=== Online Media ===

==== Free the Disney Goat ====

In the Spring of 2013, Disney launched the "Free the Disney Goat" marketing campaign for Walt Disney World. In a video, a puppet version of the Goat implored viewers to petition Disney to allow him some time off to explore the resort with the hashtag #FreeTheDisneyGoat and a website featuring the Goat's drawings imagining himself riding other attractions.

==== WDW Best Day Ever ====
After the campaign ended, the Goat puppet would later appear in a 2015-2016 YouTube series on Disney's "WDW Best Day Ever" channel titled "Walt Disney World Goat Friends", where he would comically interview other animatronic figures across the resort, usually obscure characters.

=== Printed Materials ===

==== [[Disney Kingdoms]] ====
The iconic image of Billy chewing on dynamite has been referenced in the [[Disney Kingdoms: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]] comic.
