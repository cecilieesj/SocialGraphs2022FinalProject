He is the boss of both [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] and [[Donald Duck|Donald]], the latter of which he frequently tortures for so little as a good laugh.

==Personality==
Despite his popular image, Kent is egocentric, overconfident, untrustworthy, and mean-spirited, but also hot-tempered and impatient. Unlike Donald, he has very little to compensate for this. Kent openly dislikes Donald, and takes every opportunity to try and fire him.
