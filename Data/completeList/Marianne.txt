'''Marianne''' is the protagonist of ''[[Strange Magic (film)|Strange Magic]]'', and is the heir to the throne of the Fairy Kingdom. She is the eldest daughter of the Fairy King and is the older sister of [[Dawn]]. During her journey to rescue her sister, Marianne and the [[Bog King]] fall in love and unite the separate kingdoms.

==Background==
===Personality===
At first, Marianne was optimistic, if not a little naive, completely love-struck by her fiance and rather ignorant of his blatant narcissism and aspirations of royalty. However, since Roland's infidelity, Marianne developed a rather pessimistic ideal of others and the very concept of love, trying to prevent Dawn from suffering from the same heartbreak. Ironically, this mutual contempt of love and romance she has with the Bog King helped the two bond and eventually fall in love.

Marianne also had a humanitarian ideal for becoming Queen, planning on going into the Dark Forest and bartering peace between the kingdoms. However, after encountering a group of hostile goblins before Roland's betrayal, Marianne developed a paranoid fear of the Dark Forest, doing everything she can to keep her sister (as well as anyone else) as far away from it as possible. However, with Bog's help, she eventually saw the beautiful secrets of the forest and eventually overcame her fears - both of the forest and opening herself to others.

===Powers and Abilities===
Like all fairies, Marianne's wings give her the power of flight. At first, Marianne possessed no combat abilities and seemed to possess rather inadequate crafting skills (as seen by her boutonniere). However, after getting her heart broken, she drowned herself in sword practice, gaining impressive swordsmanship skills that match the Bog King. Because of her feelings for Bog, she has developed an immunity to the love potion.

==Role in the [[Strange Magic (film)|film]]==
Marianne was engaged to a male fairy named [[Roland]] and prepared to give him a boutonniere that she's making. However, when she caught him cheating on her by kissing another female fairy, she realized that he never loved her and he only wanted to marry her for her looks so he could become king and have his own army. Marianne, heartbroken, called off the wedding, and vowed never to fall in love again. A few years later, Marianne saw Roland again during the Spring Ball, he asked her for his forgiveness, but she rejected him and then she shut a door on his wing.

Later during the Elf Spring Dance festival, Marianne's younger sister Dawn is captured by the [[Bog King]] who wants the love potion (which Roland had sent an elf named Sunny to get in order to get Marianne to fall in love with him again) that his prisoner The Sugar Plum Fairy made. Then Marianne went into to the Dark Forest to the Bog King's castle to rescue Dawn, and she ended up dueling the Bog King until they're too tired to continue their fight.

Due to being doused in the love potion when she was captured, Dawn has fallen in love with the Bog King, who demanded that the Sugar Plum Fairy make the antidote, but she told him the only thing powerful than the potion is true love. So Marianne and the Bog King (after the Bog King's mother Griselda sensed chemistry between the two) go for a romantic flight, but it's interrupted by Roland and his army (who have come to give the Bog King the love potion and rescue Dawn). The Bog King thought that Marianne set him up, so he throws her into a spider web then leaves to deal with the army.

Marianne returns to the Bog King's castle to help him battle Roland, who ordered his army to destroy the castle. Meanwhile, under the castle, the Sugar Plum Fairy demands that Sunny let her and the lovesick prisoners out of the dungeon. As the castle starts to crumble from the Fairy Cronies' destruction, The Bog King gives Dawn to Marianne, and he holds up the crumbling door to let them escape, leading to his supposed death. The two sister's mourn his death and Sunny breaks Dawn out of the love potion's effects. Dawn comforts Marianne just as the Bog King emerges from the ruins.

Roland, determined to be king, throws the love potion in Marianne's face to make her fall in love with him again. However, due to her true love for the Bog King, the potion doesn't work on her, and she punches Roland into the valley below before confessing her love for the Bog King and they kiss.

==Trivia==
*Marianne is similar to Mary Ann from ''The Baby-Sitters Club'', as Mary Ann has a sister named Dawn, who has blonde hair like [[Dawn]].
