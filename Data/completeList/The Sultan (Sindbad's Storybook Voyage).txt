The '''Sultan''' is a character who appears in the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] attraction, [[Sindbad's Storybook Voyage]].

==History==

===Background===
The Sultan is shown to be the ruler of a faraway palace in India known as the Palace of the Sultan. He is shown to be friendly to [[Sindbad]] and helps him be careful of other dangers on his journey back home to the Arabian port.

===Development History===
The Sindbad's Storybook attraction opened as Sindbad's Seven Voyages in [[Tokyo DisneySea]] which featured the Sultan warning Sindbad and his crew about the dangers on his way back home to the Arabian port. With the attraction retooled in [[2007]], the dialogue was entirely rewritten with the Sultan giving Sindbad instruments to help charm the monkeys on his way back home.

==Role in the attraction==

===Pre-2007 revamp===
In the original iteration of the attraction, the Sultan is seen in his home, the Palace of the Sultan where he warns [[Sindbad]] and his crew that the way back home is very dangerous and very difficult, due to the dangers ahead to which Sindbad and his crew manage to survive the dangers on their way back home from the Land of the Monkeys to the Whale Straits.

===Post-2007 revamp===
In the retooled version of the attraction, the Sultan is seen depicted on a portrait riding on an elephant where he is seen riding with Sindbad while a monkey prepares to attack the two as well as appearing on the map seen in the queue. In the ride, Sindbad and [[Chandu]] encounter the Sultan in his palace where he sings along with Sindbad who is on his way back home to the Arabian port. He tells Sindbad to take his drum and use it to charm a group of monkeys who are trying to stop him to which Sindbad takes his advice on his way back to Baghdad. Sindbad and Chandu manage to survive the Land of the Monkeys as well as the Whale Straits.

At the end of the attraction, the Sultan is seen depicted on a mural where he is seen bidding a farewell to Sindbad and Chandu which is seen just before boats stop at the loading zone where the guests exit the attraction.

==Trivia==
*In the retooled version of the attraction, the Sultan is seen wearing purple clothing as depicted on artwork, yet the animatronic of the Sultan himself still wears the same colored clothing in the pre-2007 revamp.
**Additionally, the artworks seen in the queue of the attraction depict the Sultan riding on an elephant to which the Sultan is never seen riding on one in the ride itself.
