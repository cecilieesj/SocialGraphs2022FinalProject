==Appearances==
===''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''===
Fidget was one of the original [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]] in the live-action movie and the fourth to be referred to by name. He is one of the average looking pups in the litter and is quite hard to distinguish among the others. His name comes from the way he itches and scratches himself, due to fleas. He and his siblings were kidnapped by [[Jasper and Horace]] for [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] and brought to [[Hell Hall|De Vil Manor]] to be made into a fur coat. With the help of his family, he escapes Cruella along with his siblings.

Fidget is very close to his sister, [[Jewel]], as seen in promotional artwork of the two playing together.

According to the December [[1996]] magazine issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', Fidget is a [[Wikipedia:Heterochromia iridum|heterochromiac]], meaning that one of his eyes is brown while the other is blue.
