==Personality==
Flynn is described as precocious, has a great sense of adventure, is mature for his age, and is mischievous by nature. He has a lot of interesting hobbies which include video games, karate, robots, and magic tricks. He also enjoys bacon and energy drinks. Whenever the doorbell rings, he (along with his sister CeCe) has a tendency to yell before opening the door ("I'll get it, mom!") He is a very mischievous kid who gets scared watching horror movies. When no one is around, he likes to run around in his underwear and pretend he's a cowboy, as seen in "Kick It Up". In "Heat It Up", it is revealed that Flynn was promised by his dad that they would take a road trip but he bailed out on him which in turn made Flynn mad, and even more upset when his mom promised a road trip but canceled when conflicts of interest with Rocky's mom came up. Flynn also has had a few pets including a goldfish (Mr. Goldberg) that Deuce accidentally killed, and a baby tarantula that was killed by Ty. Even though it is shown that he is sly and greedy, he does have a soft spot and can be kind. It is revealed that he has a teddy bear named Mr. Wubby.

==Relationships With Other Characters==
===CeCe Jones (Older Sister)===
CeCe is Flynn's older sister. She often babysits him while their mother is at work, where she cooks for him (including bacon, his favorite, and One-Minute Breakfasts), puts him to bed, and tries to keep him out of trouble. Although their relationship is usually shown to be made up of bickering and typical sibling rivalry, CeCe was the first to comfort him about their failed road trip in "Heat It Up". The two of them understand their parent's divorce situation and together even had to explain it to Rocky in Parent Trap It Up".

===Rocky Blue (Good Friend/Practical Older Sister)===
Flynn has known Rocky for a long time since she is his older sister's best friend. Therefore he thinks of her as another older sister. He loves her and missed her almost immediately after she "left" in the limousine to the airport in the episode "Model It Up".

In "Throw It Up", Flynn tricked Deuce into blowing off the errands set by Ms. Jones and going to a baseball game instead, getting them both grounded. Deuce is easily influenced by Flynn to go off-track due to Flynn's charm and sneaky personality. Deuce has a similar personality, so they easily work well together, though Flynn is seen usually out-smarting Deuce, such as trapping Deuce to a chair in chains in "Show It Up". Flynn also helped Deuce MC the talent show at JHHS, pretending to be Deuce's second head.
