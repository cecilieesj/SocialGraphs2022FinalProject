==Background==
Johnny is introduced to us in a department store, being placed on a hat stand in the window, where he meets his love, [[Alice Blue Bonnet]],Â and starts singing to her. He is eventually bought, being separated from her, and tries to find her throughout the majority of the segment. At the end, after being tossed away, smacked around, and left in a condition that was a far cry from his original pristine days, he is picked up by an iceman who cuts two holes in his rim to fit him over his horse's ears - the horse beside him wearing a similarly changed Alice! Thus they are reunited and go on to be together ever after. Johnny made a cameo during the final scene of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' atop the head of a cartoon hippopotamus.
