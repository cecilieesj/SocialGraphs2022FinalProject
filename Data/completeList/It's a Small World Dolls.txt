|home=The [[Glockenspiel]]}}'''The It's a Small World Dolls''' are characters featured throughout the ''[[It's a Small World]]'' attraction.

==History==
===Background===
The Small World Dolls are citizens of [[Fantasyland]] who live in a miniature world within the [[Glockenspiel]] clock-building. All of them are child-like dolls which live in miniature recreations of different regions of the globe, all tied together by boats and rivers.

Due to the success of the attraction, the "It's a Small World" attraction was later constructed at [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], still featuring the dolls throughout the attraction. In addition to the attraction's success, the dolls have been featured in many merchandise inspired by the attraction.

==Appearances==

The dolls appear all throughout this attraction, representing the people of different nations. As guests pass by, they sing the song, "[[It's a Small World (song)|It's a Small World]]" to promote world peace.

====[[It's a Small World Holiday]]====
The dolls reprise their classic appearances in this overlay, celebrating their different holidays.

====''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''====
In ''Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension'', [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] is sent through a theme park-style dark ride as he rides a chair to his second dimension counterpart's office.

====''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''====
In the movie Tomorrowland, the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964&nbsp;World's Fair]] version of the attraction is seen in [[Frank Walker]]'s flashback.

After joyously going on [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] and the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]], they go on It's a Small World and are horrified by the dolls.

====''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''====
The dolls were parodied in the Phineas and Ferb episode "[[The Lake Nose Monster]]" as "Lair Entrance: The Ride", a ride inside the entrance of an [[Organization Without a Cool Acronym|OWCA]] lair.

====''[[It's a Small World: The Animated Series]]''====
The Small World dolls are the lead characters in this show, namely children by the names of Maruma, Ashley, Luis, Zanele, Ling, Harold and Wazoh.

===Printed Materials===

====''[[Kingdom Keepers]]''====
In Kingdom Keepers I: Disney After Dark, the Small World Dolls attack the lead characters when they ride on It's a Small World. The dolls here are puppets of [[Maleficent]] and the [[The Overtakers|Overtakers]], being described as having teeth like piranhas which they use to try and tear the heroes apart.

==Trivia==
* The Small World dolls are often the subject of mockery due to many guests seeing them as very creepy. This may be namely due to their uncanny appearances, empty eyes, and the eerie nature of their repetitive joyous singing. It may also be ''pediophobia'', the fear of dolls which is fairly common.
