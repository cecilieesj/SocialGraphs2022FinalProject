==Appearances==
===[[Hercules (TV series)|''Hercules: The Animated Series'']]===
Memnon first appeared in "[[Hercules and the Living Legend]]" that fought Hercules and Achilles. Hades sent Memnon to lose a battle with Achilles, who turned from a has-been hero, in order to make the latter look good as a true hero and push Hercules and Phil apart. However, when Phil and Hercules ultimately get back together, Hades turns Achilles sends Memnon to kill the hero and trainer. Memnon tries smashing Hercules or breathing fire on him, but the young hero-in-training was able to defeat the dragon by tripping him with his own tail. As Hercules celebrated his victory, he didn't keep his guard up and was knocked out by Memnon. However, before Memnon could kill the two, Achilles steps in and defeats the monster by knocking him out with his massive gut.

Despite his defeat, Memnon later appeared in "[[Hercules and the Phil Factor]]". Memnon later makes a brief nonspeaking  cameo appearance in the episode "[[Hercules and the Underworld Takeover]]". He can be spotted alongside [[Cerberus]], the [[Fates]] and Hades's other underlings during [[Hecate]] hostile takeover of the [[Underworld]].

==Trivia==
*Hercules was training to fight dragons earlier in the episode, prior to Memnon's battles with [[Achilles (Hercules)|Achilles]] and Hercules himself.
