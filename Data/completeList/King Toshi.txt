'''King Toshi''' is a character from the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[Elena of Avalor]].'' He is the King of [[Satu]].

==Role in the Series==
In his debut, "[[Model Sister]]" Toshi visits the Kingdom of [[Avalor]]. When he arrives at Avalor Castle, he meets [[Princess Elena]] who gives him a tour of the palace. He's impressed by the Satu cusine and music. When [[Duke Esteban]] shows him his surprise and it quickly turns into a no holds barred disaster, he tells Elena's [[Francisco|maternal]] [[Luisa|grandparents]] to let Esteban carry on despite not liking it since he promised the Chancellor he could show him his surprise and his kingdom values keeping promises no matter what. At this, Elena stands up and tells him she has to leave because she made a promise to her sister. Toshi goes after Elena and, when he catches up to her, tells her he's proud of her for putting her family first. They go back to the castle where he experiences Avaloran culture for the very first time.

==Trivia==
*King Toshi's voice is provided by [[George Takei]], who is best known for his role as Hikaru Sulu from the original ''Star Trek'' series.
**His Disney roles were [[Fa Family Ancestors|First Ancestor Fa]] in ''[[Mulan]]'' and ''[[Mulan II]]'', and Sensei in ''[[Kim Possible]]''.
