'''B.O.Y.D.''' ('''Be Only Yourself Dude''', formerly '''Beaks Optimistic Youth Droid''', originally '''2-BO''') is a supporting character in theÂ [[2017]] ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' series.

==Background==
Contrasting to his creator, B.O.Y.D. is kind, polite, and considerate. This is evident when he tries to apologize to [[Glittering Goldie|Goldie]] and Louie for pushing them out of the pool but is pressured by [[Mark Beaks]] into teasing them. However, he briefly turned violent due to his controls falling into Doofus' hands. Once Louie reprogrammed him, he accepts Mr. and Mrs. Drake as his new parents and helps them finally stand up to [[Doofus Drake|Doofus]] by transferring half of Doofus' inheritance to his account.

B.O.Y.D. initially believed to be a real boy but when Louie exposed the ruse, the android went haywire and experienced a meltdown. After being reprogrammed to be Doofus' younger brother and the newest member of the Drake family, he became more at ease with his robotic nature.

It is later revealed that he was not created by Mark Beaks but [[Gyro Gearloose]]. His appearance as an African Grey Parrot was a coincidence.

==Appearance==
B.O.Y.D. made his debut in "[[Happy Birthday, Doofus Drake!]]". At first, he appeared like a normal, kid who got along well with Doofus and Louie. He was initially under the impression that he was a real boy, but due to only being built a day before Doofus' birthday he couldn't remember anything else beyond that point. Louie and Goldie take advantage of the situation to expose Mark Beaks' deception to Doofus. Upon discovering he was a robot, B.O.Y.D. went haywire and briefly deactivated. He is activated again by Doofus, who uses B.O.Y.D.'s arsenal to threaten Louie and make Goldie his new grandmother. After Louie gets his hands on B.O.Y.D. remote, he is reprogrammed to become Doofus' little brother. Now accepting of his robotic nature, B.O.Y.D. uses his abilities to transfer half of Doofus' inheritance and help his new parents finally stand up to Doofus.

He makes a cameo in "[[Moonvasion!]]", where he and his family were briefly prisoners.

In "[[Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!]]", B.O.Y.D. is now a member of the [[Junior Woodchucks]].

In "[[Astro B.O.Y.D.!]]", B.O.Y.D. is the main focus character of the episode. The said episode also shows the origins of how B.O.Y.D. was created; a long time ago, Gyro and [[Akita|Dr. Akita]] designed B.O.Y.D under the codename 2-BO to be a defense robot for helping mankind. Gyro also programmed B.O.Y.D. to be a real boy. However, Akita was against this idea and overrode B.O.Y.D.'s original core programming and made the android a killer robot to which [[Inspector Tezuka]] stopped him from destroying the city. Later while Huey tries to deal with his bad reputation, he shows Gyro footage about his relationship with Akita showing his true actions of what he did to him. With Dr. Akita's true nature revealed about what he did to B.O.Y.D., Gyro confronts him for his betrayal to which he and Little Helper defeat him as Tezuka arrests him for his crimes. Afterward, B.O.Y.D.'s bad reputation is dealt with just as Tezuka tells him and Huey to leave the city by flying back home.

In "[[The Last Adventure!]]"

== Trivia ==
* B.O.Y.D.'s original name of 2-BO is a play on Tobio, which was the name of Astro Boy's original human counterpart.
