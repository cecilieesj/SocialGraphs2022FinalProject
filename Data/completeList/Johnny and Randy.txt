==Background==
Johnny is the one with white feathers and his twin brother Randy is the one with brown feathers.

Beginning in Season 2, they had a fallout so Johnny hosts Ottoman Empire alone.

In Season 3, they apparently get back together.

==Role in the series==
In "''[[Happy Birthday, Doofus Drake!]]''", Johnny attended Doofus Drake's birthday party posing as a billionaire's son, though Doofus saw through that charade.

In "''[[Friendship Hates Magic!]]''", Johnny appears in Louie's dream.

In "''[[The Duck Knight Returns!]]''", a planned Appearance at the Grand Opening of a Furniture outlet was canceled Jim Starling Appears in their place.

They appear in "''[[The Richest Duck in the World!]]''", as Louie hired them to build him an emerald ottoman. At first, they both refused to work together, but when Louie offered to pay them both $100 million, they agreed and built what Louie requested.

By "''[[Moonvasion!]]''", the rooster duo appeared in a meeting during a plan to defeat Lunaris and stop the alien invasion and also helped fight against the Moonlanders to which the battle ended after Lunaris' defeat.

In "''[[Quack Pack!]]''", an advertisement featuring the rooster duo's show ''Ottoman Empire'' for a new episode appears briefly while Huey is discussing with Della, Scrooge, and Louie about why the sitcom audience is laughing at the nephews, much to Huey's shock upon seeing the ad with an image of Johnny and Randy next to him. The ad for Johnny and Randy's show briefly disappears before it is revealed that the McDuck family is being filmed on camera.

In "[[The Last Adventure!]]", Johnny and Randy's story within their series comes to a close when they are reunited with their long lost father; a finale that causes both Dewey and Louie to cry at the end. It is later revealed that they, among numerous other characters, were captured by [[F.O.W.L.]] in an effort to eradicate all adventure related things from existence. It is implied that they were rescued by the McDuck Family.
