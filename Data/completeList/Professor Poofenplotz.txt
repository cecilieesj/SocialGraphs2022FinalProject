'''Professor Esmerelda Poofenplotz'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0399148/</ref> is the nemesis of [[Pinky|Agent Pinky]], [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella's]] chihuahua. ("[[Day of the Living Gelatin]]", "[[Isabella and the Temple of Sap]]")

Her known schemes so far involve replacing handbags and searching for strong hairspray (her favorite is "Stiff Beauty" hairspray, which originally was only used by clowns).

She is concerned about her looks, as she can't take over the world until she feels she looks her best. Otherwise, she shares much of [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz's]] personality, including having a vehicle that has her head as the main body and saying "Curse you, [[Pinky the Chihuahua]]!" when her plans are foiled or go wrong. Doofenshmirtz wrote her a letter in "[[Bee Story]]" where he informed her that her application into membership in [[League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness|L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.]] had been declined due to her being deemed not close to their standards.

==Trivia==
*Her evil jingles are "''Poofenplotz Evil is Crazy!''" and "''Poofenplotz reading a junk mail!"'', very similar to [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz|Doofenshmirtz]]'s evil jingle. However, she has more jingles in one building than Doof's only one jingle in his building.
*She also looks and sounds like [[Judi Dench]], the actress who plays M in the more recent James Bond films.
*Her lair/office/home bears some resemblance to [[Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated]].
*She may be based on [[Cruella De Vil]] due to her wishes to be "Drop-dead gorgeous" and her dislike of dogs.
*Her first name was revealed in "[[Bee Story]]".
*She shares the same first name as the love interest of "Juan" in "El Matador De Amor". ("[[The Great Indoors]]")
*She is very strict about her appearance, especially her hair. She feels that she cannot attempt to take over the world until she is "drop-dead gorgeous". Her favorite hairspray is 'Stiff Beauty'.
