'''Greenbeard''' is a character in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'']] film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Greenbeard serves as the navigator of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Greenbeard has characteristics of sea creatures. His whole body was encased with ocean flora and fauna, with seaweed fused all over his body. Despite his name, he did not have a beard.

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Greenbeard was the one who sent an innocent chaplain to his demise with help from Ratlin to throw him overboard. Afterwards, he and the other crewmen board the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' and held the motley crew as hostages just as [[Jack Sparrow]] makes a negotiation with [[Davy Jones]]. Greenbeard later watched Davy Jones having [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]] punish his son [[Will Turner]] and he was the one who threw Will below deck. During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Greenbeard watches [[Maccus]], [[Clanker]], and [[Koleniko]] play the game to which Will Turner challenges against Davy Jones.

The next day, Greenbeard and the rest of the ''Flying Dutchman'' crew raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping while [[Jimmy Legs]] used his whip on the crew. Later at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Greenbeard and the rest of the crew plans to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

Just as Greenbeard and the crew approach the chest Jack and his crew found, the crew stops and continues searching for the chest. Jimmy Legs and the rest of the crew then arrive towards [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] and [[Pintel and Ragetti]]. Successfully opening the chest containing the Heart of Davy Jones, Greenbeard and the crew fight against Jack's crew just as Jack and his crew plan to escape from the crew and return to the ''Black Pearl''. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Greenbeard and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack, much to his rage.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Greenbeard returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Greenbeard and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most the crew of the ''Empress''.

During battle at the maelstrom, Greenbeard fought against one of Jack's crewmen. In the battle, Greenbeard fought with his bare fists when Jack attempted to steal the [[Dead Man's Chest]].

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Greenbeard and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''.

==Trivia==
*In an early screenplay of ''Dead Man's Chest'', the bosun of the ''Dutchman'' was Greenbeard, not Jimmy Legs. He is also said to be fused with mostly seaweed to which for the final version, he doesn't have seaweed on his body and Jimmy Legs was the boatswain of the ''Dutchman''.
