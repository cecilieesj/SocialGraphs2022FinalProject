'''Pluto's Minions '''are minor characters and are [[Pluto (The Goddess of Spring)|Pluto]]'s imp minions in the [[Silly Symphonies]] short, ''[[The Goddess of Spring]]''.

==Background==

===Physical Description===
They are small, black imps with red short horns, hands, feet, and bellies, as well as grinning mouths of white teeth and long forked tails.

===Personality===
Like the rest in the mythology, they have devilish personality, such as being bad and mischievous.

==Role in the short==
The imps are first seen when Pluto ascends from beneath the earth on a rotating platform and, as his demons chase away Persephone's elf friends. Pluto takes her to the Underworld, where dozens of imps celebrate. One imp gives Pluto a crown to Persephone to make her his queen; one plays on a hellish organ whilst others dance in circles around a crater spewing fire behind them. They are not seen after that.
