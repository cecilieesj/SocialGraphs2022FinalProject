'''Uti''' is one of the Māori gods from [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
Uti is the apparent tiki goddess of fishing.  In the legends which inspired her integration to the tiki room; she taught Polynesian mortals how to fish at night by holding a torch above their heads as a means of luring fish to their lights and into the boats.

In the story of the Disney Parks, she was one of the tiki gods who enchanted the enchanted tiki room.  Her idol was placed above the tiki room so her torch could bring in guests to enjoy it.

=== Development History ===
Uti was once located on the canopy above the entrance to the Enchanted Tiki Room.  She appeared as one of the attraction's Polynesian deities though she was the only one of the Tiki gods featured not to have come to life in the pre-show due to her location.

In the year [[2000]], wood rot caused the canopy from which Uti was found to collapse.  While the canopy would be rebuilt, Uti would not be re-integrated into the attraction's exterior.  This is likely due to how her figure was carved and had no replicas or moulds on hand for imagineers to use.

== Appearances ==
