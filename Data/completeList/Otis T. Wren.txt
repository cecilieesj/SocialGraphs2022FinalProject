'''Otis T. Wren''' is a character from the ''[[Adventurers Club]]''.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Otis T. Wren was an adventurer and ichthyologist in the early half of the 20th century.  He became a member of the Adventurers Club, a splinter-group of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]] which was created by one [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]].  By [[1937]], Otis would serve as the resident club-treasurer of the Adventurers Club.  Otis also befriended club-affiliate [[Trader Sam]] whom he went on a river expedition with.

In [[1941]], he left the club's headquarters on [[Pleasure Island (Downtown Disney)|Pleasure Island]] in [[Lake Buena Vista]] due to it having been devastated by Hurricane Charlotte.  Circa [[1948]], Otis was among several Adventurers Club members who befriended aviator [[Jock Lindsey]].  Otis assisted Lindsey in opening his hangar bar in Disney Springs, [[Florida]] in the year [[1955]].
