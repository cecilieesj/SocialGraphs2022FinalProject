'''Simon''' is a character from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series who makes his first and only appearance in the episode "[[Big Top Breakfast]]". He is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]. 

==Background==
===Physical Description===
Simon is a tiny monkey with gray fur on his body, and caucasian skin on his face, the inside of his ears, his fingers, toes, and stomach. He has black eyes. He also has a pink nose and wears a red fez, matching bowtie, and a black vest.

===Personality===
Simon is faint-hearted. He is also fearful. This can be seen when [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]] try to catch him and eat him. However, Simon is plucky, tricking the hyenas into getting him back to the circus aircraft. He also initially thought of himself as a bad circus performer, but after performing for the hyenas, he improved.

==Appearances==
==="[[Big Top Breakfast]]"===
Simon practices his act while flying in the Dingling Brothers' Circus aircraft, worrying that he isn't any good. However, while the pilots, who are clown stunt flyers, are practicing crazy flight tricks for their act, they accidentally fling Simon and his things out of the aircraft, where he crash lands in Serengeti. Once landing there, [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed]] find him and make plans to devour him. 

Fortunately, Simon manages to escape from them while they argue. Although he ends up getting tricked by them, he manages to trick them in turn with a circus act, and he ends up back in the circus aircraft with his [[Simon's father|father]].

==Trivia==
A different monkey named Simon appears in two Lion King-inspired comics, [[A Kinglike Hair-do]], and [[Royal Duties]].
