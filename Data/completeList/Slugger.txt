He is designed to deflect incoming enemy projectiles and swat away balls, toys, and fruits thrown over the fence by annoying kids. His one true place is at the baseball field as a coaching assistant for Little League softball.

==Background==
===Personality===
Slugger is an adept baseball player who is actually stronger than he appears to be, as he was able to grip a basketball pole without any struggle and whack [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] over a vast distance. He will hit anything that comes his way on instinct due to his programming, but is also one of the least hostile among the other experiments. He seems cautious of people, but gets along quite well with others once he gets to know them.

===Powers and abilities===
Slugger's bat-like tail can deflect incoming projectiles of almost any texture or substance, although he mainly uses this for deflecting baseballs. His tail can also rotate 360 degrees around his waist at high speeds. Slugger has amazing strength, absurd precision, and coordination, and is capable of flight.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 608 was the 608th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to deflect incoming enemy projectiles. 608 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 608's pod landing on a baseball field.

608's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] was mixed in with a bunch of softballs. When the team's Little League coach noticed it, he realized it wasn't a softball and tossed it. The pod landed into a drink cooler, the melting ice activating 608, who shivered from the chill.

608 then spotted a woman in a wheelchair throwing a ball for her dog to fetch. Before the dog could retrieve the ball, 608 deflected it with his bat-like tail, astounding the dog.

Later, multiple coconuts thrown by [[Mrs. Hasagawa]] and deflected by 608 hit [[Stitch]] on the head, therefore grabbing his and [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s attention. Before they could react, [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived and grabbed 608, even stating how weak the latter was as he struggled to get free. Just then, Stitch slammed a crate onto Gantu's head, and 608 got loose from his grasp.

Afterwards, Lilo started talking to 608 and pacified him. When Lilo assured 608 that she and Stitch will keep him safe, the former took 608, named Slugger, [[Lilo's House|home]] and discovered his batting skills. Lilo then decided to put Slugger on her softball team, since [[Pleakley]] had jeopardized the previous game with his incompetence, and after Lilo and [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] had wagered a rematch.

Thus, Slugger became Lilo's new softball player against Mertle's team. He did really well during practice until Mertle changed the game to basketball, put Gantu on her team, and even made Slugger be part of the wager. Slugger struggled at basketball because he could only hit things, but the game was still won thanks to Stitch and a very talented Pleakley.

Gantu, being a sore loser, attempted to make off with Slugger, but the latter was saved when Stitch tripped Gantu using one of the basketball goals. Enraged, Gantu ripped out the other basketball pole and tried to retaliate. However, he was thwarted by Stitch, who then let Slugger use the pole to whack Gantu over a vast distance.

Slugger later found his one true place as the new hitter for the Little League softball team, whose coach (the same one who activated Slugger earlier) wasn't a very good hitter himself. With Slugger coaching, the team would eventually become first place.

Slugger reappeared in "[[Glitch (episode)|Glitch]]", coaching for the Little League team when a baseball pitching machine went out of control shooting many balls at him very fast. Regardless, Slugger spun his tail around and around his body, deflecting every ball the machine threw at him, scaring the team's members as they were getting hit by the balls. When the coach unplugged the machine to stop it, [[Glitch|223]]'s pod was shot out and Slugger gave it the biggest hit of all, sending it all the way to [[Lilo's House]] where it was activated.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Slugger was seen early in the movie coaching Little League softball with his batting skills as [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to make sure all the experiments were happy in the one true place they belonged.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Slugger, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], Pleakley, [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Slugger participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by deflecting Leroys' plasma projectiles back at them. He also carried off a couple of Leroys with his bat-like tail.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Slugger made a cameo appearance in the ''Stitch!'' anime as one of the experiments in [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]]. He made another appearance, along with [[Pix]], [[Boomer (Lilo & Stitch)|Boomer]], [[Slushy]], [[Blowhard]], and [[Kixx]] when [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and [[Stitch]] visited [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

==Trivia==
*Despite Gantu claiming Slugger to be weak, he was able to grasp a basketball pole and whack Gantu over a vast distance without any struggle, and another time he suspended Stitch in mid-flight, again without any struggle.
*Slugger's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue.
*Slugger is one of two known experiments whose pod got mixed up with softballs, the other being [[Glitch]].
*The [[Experiment Pod Container]] describes Slugger as: "Experiment 608. Primary function: Deflection of incoming enemy projectiles."
**According to Jumba, Slugger "will swat at many different things. In addition to deflecting airborne projectiles launched by enemies, he is also programmed to swat away balls, toys, and fruit thrown over fence by annoying neighbor children."
