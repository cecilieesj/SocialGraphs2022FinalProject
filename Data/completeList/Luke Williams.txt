===''Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam''===
He is introduced as a proud member of the rival camp, Camp Star. He and [[Mitchie Torres|Mitchie]] quickly become enemies after getting off on the wrong foot and Luke is shown to be extremely loyal to [[Axel Turner]], the owner of Camp Star. He has to share the stage with [[Tess Tyler]] after she switches camps but that does not go well when they're constantly fighting for the spotlight due to clashing personalities. In the end, he celebrates his victory with Camp Star and is one of the few who refuses to switch to Camp Rock at the end of the summer.
