==Background==
===Physical Description===
Sparky is an old-timing junkyard dog who appears to have some spunk left in him. He is an {{WikipediaLink|Irish Wolfhound}} with light gray on his mustache and eyebrows.

===Personality===
Sparky used to know the [[Tramp]], or so he says. Whether or not this is true is unknown. He doesn't do much else other than tell [[Scamp]] tales about his father. They weren't true, of course, but Sparky seems really into story-telling. He eventually leaves [[The Junkyard|the junkyard]] with the other junkyard dogs, minus [[Buster (Lady and the Tramp)|Buster]], and gets adopted by a family along with [[Scratchy]].

==Trivia==
*He bears a similarity to [[Amos Slade]]'s dog, [[Chief]], as they are both the same breed.
