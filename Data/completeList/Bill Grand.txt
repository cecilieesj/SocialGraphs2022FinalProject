==Role in the film==
Bill has been a widower for four years. While in summer school, his daughter, Mary, befriends [[Nikki Ferris]], whose mother, [[Sharon McKendrick|Sharon]], is unhappily divorced and living as a single, somewhat jaded mother. Nikki is not happy about their impending move to [[New York City]]. To stop it from happening and to see their parents happily married, she and Mary scheme to set them up.

Nikki and Mary trick their parents into meeting each other by sending Sharon flowers that are supposedly from Bill, but they don't just fall madly in love with each other as Nikki and Mary had hoped. So they contact Sharon's twin sister and Nikki's aunt, [[Susan Evers|Susan Carey]]. She is convinced by them to fly to Tampa to help them by posing as Sharon and going on a few dates just to get things started.

"Sharon" "accidently" bumps into Bill at a bar called the Press Box and watches a few innings of a baseball game with him. The real Sharon detests baseball, and is confused when Bill drops by her workplace the next day and mentions how much fun they had. He and "Sharon" cross paths a couple more times over the next few days. [[Florence]], Bill and Mary's housekeeper, begins to suspect that something is awry.

Sharon discovers Nikki and Mary's scheme and decides to trick them instead. She contact's Susan's husband, [[Brian Carey|Brian]], who is a pilot for TWA, and involves him in her scheme. While "Sharon" and Bill are on a date, the real Sharon and Brian pretend to also be on one, with her dressed as a different woman.

"Sharon" becomes distracted and clumsy on her date while watching Brian. Finally having had enough, she announces to Bill that the man she is watching is Brian. She storms over to their table, but begins laughing when she sees the real Sharon underneath a black wig.

Susan and Sharon clear up the situation for Bill, and Sharon says that she doesn't have romantic feelings for him, and would like it if they just remained friends. She is still determined to move to New York City.

A going away party is thrown for Sharon and Nikki on the boat of the former's boss, Mr. Elias. Sharon and Bill meet in the cabin while Nikki and Mary go get something from the car. They release the boat's ropes and push it away from the dock. The guests begin arriving and watch helplessly as it drifts away.

Bill and Sharon are enjoying each other's company, but wonder where everyone is. They go up on deck, see how far they are from shore, and then, Bill kisses Sharon. It is long and switches to their wedding. They're finally a family!
