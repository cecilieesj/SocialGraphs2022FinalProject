'''Dez''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2020]] animated feature film, ''[[Soul]]''. He is [[Joe Gardner|Joe]]'s longtime barber and professional listener.

==Background==
===Personality===
Dez is friendly with a warm smile and sense of humor, and has known Joe for years. He gladly lets his client talk about anything he wants â€” which for Joe, of course, is jazz.

After attending 22 (in Joe's body), he states that he was already tired of talking about jazz all the time, but that he is happy that they finally asked him about his personal life, his family, dreams and feelings, making that Joe (in the body of the cat), feel bad.

===Physical appearance===
Dez is a stout, tall African American adult with abundant hair on his arms, a square but curly military cut, and a thicker beard. He also has a lot of tattoos on both of his arms.

His conventional clothing, and the one he wears in the barbershop, consists of a navy blue dress shirt with short sleeves, denim jeans and Caterpillar lumberjack boots. He also wears a black apron.

He wears accessories such as a piercing in his left ear, a gold bracelet on his left arm and on both arms he has tattoos alluding to his profession (scissors and flowers).

==Appearances==
===''[[Soul]]''===
After the real [[Joe Gardner|Joe]] (controlled by [[22]]) feels worried that he cannot be at the Half Note Club with this look, he and [[Mr. Mittens]] (controlled by Joe's soul counterpart) arrive at Dez's barbershop so that Dez would help Joe with the hair problem where Dez tells Joe to sit so that he could help with Joe while [[Paul (Soul)|Paul]] makes a rude comment about Joe just as the barber tells Joe to ignore the words he says to him. As Dez continues giving him a good haircut, Dez shares the same interest with Joe: meet interesting folks like Joe did to which after getting a haircut from Dez, he then bids a farewell to him before the two return to the hospital.

===''[[Soul of the City]]''===
Dez briefly appears in the ''[[Pixar Popcorn]]'' episode giving a satisfied boy a lollipop.
