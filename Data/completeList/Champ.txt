'''Champ''' is a robot that [[Mickey Mouse]] teaches to box in the 1933 short, ''[[Mickey's Mechanical Man]]''. He has a curious affinity for auto horns

==Appearances==
===''[[Mickey's Mechanical Man]]''===
Mickey builds Champ to fight against [[Beppo the Gorilla]], the Kongo Killer, in a boxing match. He doesn't work as well as Mickey expects him to, however, and he only manages to defeat Beppo because [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]]'s car horn has the power to invigorate and resuscitate him.

===''[[Epic Mickey]]''===
Champ also appears in ''Epic Mickey'', fighting against Beppo in a boxing match; a nod to ''Mickey's Mechanical Man''.
