==Role in the series==
Chaps, Manny, and Sperk are a trio of intelligent bugs, with Sperk being the leader. Chaps is a dung beetle, Manny is a spider, and Sperk is a caterpillar. They were eventually caught by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and put in her makeshift bug city, Bugopolis. They first appear when [[Stitch]] gets turned into ant by [[Bugby]]. They recognize him and become scared at first, but then they discover that he is their size, so they bully and pick on him. Stitch ties them up with Manny's webbing, though they manage to get free. Later, Lilo gets turned into a ladybug by Bugby and shows up to save Stitch after he is eventually caught by the trio. They recognize her and show their respects. Sperk says they were going to toss out Stitch for eating insects like them, but Lilo stops him, explaining that Stitch is her friend and that he no longer eats bugs. Sperk agrees but tells his fellow insects to keep an eye on Stitch. Chaps, Manny, and Sperk then join up with Lilo and Stitch, as well as [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] and [[Pleakley]] (who had also been turned into bugs by Bugby), and the group attempts to find a way to escape outside to safety.

During the ordeal, the three real bugs wind up in danger of insect-hating [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and the exterminator; however, Stitch ends up rescuing them and eventually develops a change of heart about eating bugs. After a few setbacks, including a tussle with an aggressive wild cat, the gang makes it to [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]], where they use a special machine to revert to normal (and enlarge the three real bugs to human size). Before they do, Chaps reminds Stitch to not eat insects the next time he sees them, to which Stitch solemnly promises. Afterwards, the exterminator shows up, thinking the vermin crawled into here, but a giant Sperk tells him off by asking the exterminator if he's looking for them, to which he responds indecisively and runs away in fear. Chaps, Manny, and Sperk start to enjoy their humongous size until Bugby attacks, reverting the giant insects to their original size. However, Lilo and Stitch are able to recapture Bugby in Lilo's jar before he can turn her, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley back into bugs.

==Trivia==
*They are the only Earth animals who can talk in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]], considering they were able to talk to the exterminator when they were briefly made giant.
*Sperk, the leader of the bug trio, speaks in a gangster-like tone, similar to some of the [[Toon Patrol]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
