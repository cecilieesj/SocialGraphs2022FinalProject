|status=Active}}'''Renard Dumont''' is a recurring character from ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]''. A French entrepreneur and merchant, he establishes a trading post near Tarzan's jungle. He maintains a neutral relationship with [[Tarzan]].

==Personality==
He is a savvy businessman who loves money and acts suave and polite to others. He enjoys scamming people and is rather indifferent to the jungle inhabitants, telling Tarzan he does not wish to harm or help the animals. Despite this, he does respect Tarzan, understanding it is better to have him as an ally than an enemy, and often warns poachers that Tarzan is protective of the jungle. He promises that he wouldn’t harm the gorillas, but he adds that he wouldn’t help them either, mainly because they have no traits that interest him whatsoever and are not beneficial to him or his business. He also recommends Tarzan as a guide when people ask for someone to lead them through the jungle. Dumont is enamored with [[Jane Porter|Jane]] (despite her married status) and frequently tries to charm her away from Tarzan to no avail. This shows that he does not really seem to care or respect that she is Tarzan’s wife (therefore meaning she is unavailable).
