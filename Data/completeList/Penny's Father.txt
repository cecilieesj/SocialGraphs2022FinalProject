'''Penny's Father''' is a minor character in the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film, ''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]''. He is an actor portraying the father of [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]] as part of some franchise television program.

==Appearances==
===''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]''===
Penny's Father is first seen calling Penny and informs her that [[Dr. Calico]] and his henchmen have captured him and are holding him hostage but explains that he gave her dog, [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]], incredible super powers so she can find him. He is later shown in a holographic TV that was being spied by Penny, where he is being held hostage by Calico, as he tells him that he'll never reveal information before one of Calico's cats meows at him to be silent. He isn't seen for a while in the film, until during the last filming set where Calico showed him that they've captured Penny but just as Bolt's lookalike shows up. However, unfortunately, the dog gets spooked and accidentally knocks over a fire post that sets the whole stage on fire which forced everyone to leave the studio including the actor, who escapes from the fake tied chair. He was not seen again afterward.

===''[[Super Rhino]]''===
Penny's Father discovers that Dr. Calico captured both Penny and Bolt and sends super-powered [[Rhino]] to save them. Since that was revealed to be one of Rhino's dreams, this event in the in-universe TV show may have taken place after he was rescued by Penny.

===''[[Bolt: The Video Game]]''===
Penny's Father's voice was heard on the phone that Dr. Calico handed to Penny when he and his men got their hands on her at the ancient temple; before Bolt came to her rescue. Dr. Calico made him believe that he still had her and that he would not harm her in any way if he builds them a weapon. He later made an appearance when he stuck his head out of the helicopter that Dr. Calico was trying to get on, begging Penny to get Bolt to stop the missiles that his captor had launched.

==Trivia==

*It is unknown what happens to Penny's Father after the fire, as he was last shown escaping from the fake chair that he was held "captive".
*His real name is unknown.
*His personality and appearance is somewhat based off [[Dr. James Possible]] from the ''[[Kim Possible]]'' series.
* He only has a few lines in the film.
