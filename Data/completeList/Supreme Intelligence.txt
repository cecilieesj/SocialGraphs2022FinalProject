The '''Supreme Intelligence''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]] that appears as the overarching antagonist of ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''.

It is the ruler of the [[Kree]]. Its name is indicative of the fact that it's the smartest Kree alive, being more intelligent than the greatest Kree scientists and the greatest Kree strategists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-annette-bening-supreme-intelligence-2/|title=Captain Marvel: Here's the Supreme Intelligence on Annette Bening's role|website=CBR.com|date=February 22, 2018}}</ref>

Before making an on-screen appearance in ''Captain Marvel'', Supreme Intelligence was mentioned in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. The events of ''Captain Marvel'' have humbled it to some extent, even if it's not fully reformed, as it's signed a peace treaty with [[Xandar]]. [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] rejecting this peace treaty is what kicks off the events of the movie, and ultimately leads to the formation of the titular [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].

The Supreme Intelligence was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Trivia==
*In ''Captain Marvel'', the Supreme Intelligence is a computer that in virtual reality takes a form of someone whoever is using it at the time greatly admires. In the comics and the cartoon, the Supreme Intelligence is a giant Kree head.
