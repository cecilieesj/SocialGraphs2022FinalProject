==Appearances==
===''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''===
She first appears when [[James Henry Trotter]] climbs inside the [[Giant Peach|peach]], having been transformed. She is like a grandmother figure to James. She hangs in a lantern and lights up the inside of the peach with her tail and has bad hearing. She accompanies the others on their journey to [[New York City]]. She and the others are separated from James during an attack from the [[Rhino (James and the Giant Peach)|Rhino]], but they later reunite with James, who has transformed back into his normal form, and she aids in the capture of [[Aunt Spiker]] and [[Aunt Sponge]]. She later lives with the others in Central Park being a grandmother figure to James and becomes a new light torch for the [[wikipedia:Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]], saving the city millions of dollars on energy.
