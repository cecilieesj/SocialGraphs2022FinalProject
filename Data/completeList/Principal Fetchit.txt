'''Principal Fetchit''' is a character from the [[2005]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Chicken Little]]''. He is the principal of [[Oakey Oaks Middle School]].

==Role in the film==
Principal Fetchit is not physically seen, though only his shadow is shown outside his office where he talks to [[Chicken Little (character)|Chicken Little]]'s father, [[Buck Cluck]] about the inappropriate things he did at school earlier, while Chicken Little sits in his office. He is never seen again throughout the film, not even when the aliens restore [[Oakey Oaks]].

==Trivia==
*His last name is a pun on "fetch it", a term whenever a person throws an object for their pet dog to retrieve the object back to them.
*He is somewhat similar to [[Principal Mazur]] from [[A Goofy Movie|''A Goofy Movie'']]. Aside from being voiced by the same actor, they are both school principals who question the protagonists' parents about the actions their children did.
