'''Scarlet''' is one of the twelve Star Darling students at Starling Academy and also one of the five main female protagonists in Disney's ''[[Star Darlings]]''.

==Background==
===Official Description===
''Scarlet’s wish-granting potential is off the charts. To the other Star Darlings, Scarlet seems to be on a completely different orbit, but that’s just fine for this confident and independent starling. Scarlet’s just not a warm, touchy-feely kind of girl, but she knows she needs to work on opening up to the other girls. Scarlet can’t wait to visit Wishworld and let her inner light shine through!''
===Personality===
Scarlet is confident, intense, passionate, magnetic, curious, rebellious, independent, and very brave. However, on the other hand, she is a loner and can alienate others by being secretive, arrogant, stubborn, sarcastic, and jealous. She is the drummer of the Star Darlings band.

== Appearance ==
Scarlet’s theme color is fuchsia. She is a teenage girl with tan skin, fuchsia eyes, lips, and fuchsia hair with black highlights styled in a short side cut. Her outfit consists of a fuchsia hoodie under a dark vest, a dark belt with a pink buckle, dark fuchsia ruffled skirt, black and fuchsia striped stockings, and dark boots. Her accessories are her star-charmed boot buckles.

On Earth, Scarlet’s appearance changes to look like a normal human. Her hair color changes to black with only a streak of fuchsia. Her skin also loses its sparkle and her outfit changes to look more human. The only item that remains the same are her star-charmed boot buckles.
