This character is rarely seen, as her face is usually never shown, so little is known about her personality. She seems, however, to be a typical mother—concerned about the welfare of [[Christopher Robin|her son]] and giving good motherly advice, but also sometimes fretting about things like him not cleaning [[Christopher Robin's room|his room]].

In ''The Book of Pooh'', she was heard during the opening song "[[Everyone Knows He's Winnie the Pooh]]", telling Christopher Robin that it's time for school. She was also seen in a number of interstitial segments in the ''[[The Book of Pooh: Stories from the Heart|Stories from the Heart]]'' DVD release. One segment shows her seeing Christopher Robin's room as a mess, believing that her son caused it even though it was Pooh and his friends. She was always shown from the neck down.

Mrs. Robin also appears in the live-action film [[Christopher Robin (film)|''Christopher Robin'']], played by Katy Carmichael. This incarnation of Christopher Robin's mom is seen taking her son to a boarding school as Christopher reunites with his parents back in the real world after bidding a farewell to his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood just as Christopher has to adapt living in the real world. She is later seen picking up Christopher from school after his dad had died. She is only seen in the beginning of the film.

==Trivia==
* Mrs. Robin is the first character from a TV series to appear in a live-action film adaptation of a franchise.
