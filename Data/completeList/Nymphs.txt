}}'''Nymphs''' are a race of female nature spirits that tend to take on a form related to their environment (Example: While in forests: trees, in flower fields: flowers, in bodies of water: water). They can take on a human form with brown, orange, blue, green or aqua skin color. In the animated series a nymph named Syrinx has a family of male tree-like entities, if these creatures are male nymphs or not is never explained; these "males" can only take on a partially humanoid form (resembling trees or bushes with faces). The nymphs reside on [[Phil's Island]] and [[Philoctetes]] enjoys spending his time peeping on the females.

==Notable Nymphs==
===Sea Nymphs===

They reside on tropical islands and are in service to [[Gegeneis]], a giant 4-armed yeti who spares their lives in exchange for the life of sailors they lure to the island.

===[[Syrinx]]===
[[File:Syrinx.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Syrinx with Phil.]]
A female tree nymph who resides on [[Phil's Island]]. Unlike the rest of the nymphs she apparently enjoys [[Philoctetes|Phil]]'s company and seems to be in a relationship with him. However, she was upset with Phil when he forbid Hercules from dancing (considering it "un-manly"). She tells him he's just as stubborn and hard-headed as her father, who disapproves of her relationship with a satyr. She appeared in ''Hercules and the Muse of Dance''.

====Syrinx's family====

Syrinx's family includes her father and three brothers. None of them are happy with her dating a satyr, especially not her father. Their attitudes changed when Phil saved her from a fire her father caused.

===Styx===
In ''Hercules and the River Styx''. Styx is technically a Naiad, or fresh-water nymph.

==Trivia==
*In the original myth, nymphs were a female-only species.
*If Phil's Island is Rhodes where the nymphs live then, the water nymph in the film could possibly be Rhode (daughter of [[Poseidon]]).
