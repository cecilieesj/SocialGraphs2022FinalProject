'''The Crow''' is a minor character from the [[2012]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Brave]]''. He is a pet that belongs to [[the Witch]].
==Appearances==
===''[[Brave]]''===
The crow has the ability to speak. His plumage is in bad shape, likely from a past of being abused by [[The Witch|the witch]] and her animated broom, who find him annoying. When [[Merida|Princess Merida]] presents herself at the [[Witch's Cottage|witch's cottage]], she notices the crow standing immobile. The witch says that he is only a stuffed animal, but the crow betrays himself by starting to talk to Merida, then singing. The crow contributes to creating the spell by plucking a hair off of Merida as the final ingredient. 

The crow makes a post-credits appearance, asking a stunned guard of the [[DunBroch]] castle to sign the delivery of all the bear carvings Merida bought earlier from the witch.

===''[[The Legend of Mor'du]]''===
He appears in the short film trying to tell the story of [[Mor'du]] but the Witch silences him. In the end, he watches [[Wee Dingwall]] running and screaming out of the cottage and he and the Witch return to woodcarving.

==Trivia==

* Because of his larger size and curvier beak, the Crow ironically resembles a raven more than a real crow.{{Brave}}
