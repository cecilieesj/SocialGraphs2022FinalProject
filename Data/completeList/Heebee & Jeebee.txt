==Role in the episode==
Heebee and Jeebee first appeared with [[Bruin]] as they spotted the elephants with a pile of peanuts and found the "goober-grabbers". They told [[Captain Colonel]] that their peanuts had been nabbed and thought he and the other elephants stole their peanuts.

After a brief argument, despite finding the idea of using the Rescue Rangers to help them a joke since they were very small, the monkeys and the other zoo animals gave them a chance; thanks to the Captain's son, [[Elliott (Chip 'n Dale)|Elliott]].

At night, after the elephants' nuts have been stolen, the monkeys, the elephants, and Bruin accuse the Rescue Rangers of such a crime and try to stop them. When trying to catch them, Heebee and Jeebee only manage to accidentally bump into each other after chasing Chip 'n Dale.

Then, after the real thieves, who turn out to be the panda twins: [[Ting-a-Ling & Ming-Ting|Ting-a-Ling and Ming-Ting]] who only stole peanuts to make their digging machine work to dig back to China because they missed their parents so much, are discovered, the digging machine goes out of control by the chipmunks and the monkeys, Bruin, and a [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|crocodile]] end up falling in a hole caused by the machine's digging and later resurface after being frightened by the crocodile.

After the Rescue Rangers help recover the peanuts, Heebee and Jeebee are last seen enjoying some peanuts of their own.

==Trivia==
*Heebee and Jeebee's names are a wordplay on the words: Heebie-jeebies, an idiom used to describe a feeling of anxiety, apprehension, depression, or illness.
*Although both monkeys look identical, it is unknown for a fact if they're actually related.
*During the scene where Heebee and Jeebee chase Chip 'n Dale, when the Rescue Rangers are wrongfully accused of stealing the peanuts by the zoo animals, and the scene where one of the elephants pours some water to ease the pain from the bump on Bruin's head received by [[Monterey Jack]] after the chase-fight, Heebee and Jeebee are seen as two identical yellow monkeys with brown bellies.
*During the scene in which Captain Colonel accuses Heebee and Jeebee of being the peanut thieves, their voice actors accidentally and temporarily switch voice roles.
*During the scene where Heebee and Jeebee come with Bruin to have a talk with Captain Colonel, Heebee is seen on Bruin's right but then in the next shot, Jeebee is seen on Bruin's right instead.
