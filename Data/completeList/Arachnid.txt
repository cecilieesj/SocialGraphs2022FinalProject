It is bigger than a camel and fiercely guards The Golden Scarab Beetle Key, way out of the Oasis that is outside the city of [[Agrabah]]. [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] confronted this beast. He did not face it head as he exposed its weakness with his agile skills in its web and defeated the creature, leaving victorious with a mysterious Serpent Idol, and two halves of a [[Golden Scarab Beetle]], before meeting a Mystic with secret and sinister agendas of its own, and Aladdin heading across the desert, finding the entrance of The [[Cave of Wonders]].
