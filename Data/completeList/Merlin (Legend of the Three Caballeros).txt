==Background==
When April, May, and June first met Merlin, the nieces explain to him that they arrived for hero training. However, when he saw June's smartphone, Merlin became curious that the object looks unique to him as he never saw a modern object like that in Camelot. When using June's smartphone, April and June explain to Merlin that the object he is holding is a cellphone, where he can use it to take pictures or play games on it, to which Merlin starts becoming curious upon playing a video game on the phone. Despite this, he couldn't learn when to stop playing whenever a disaster strikes such as when the nieces accidentally summon a dragon in Camelot. Later when he finds out that the coins he won are not real after finishing the game, he felt furious, believing that the smartphone was useless in giving coins for him and also thought the phone deceived him into winning coins, much to his frustration.

===Physical Appearance===
Merlin is a large blue owl with a white beard wearing a dark blue wizard outfit and wears a pair of glasses.

==Role in the series==

===''[[Thanks a Camelot]]''===
Serving as [[King Arthur (Legend of the Three Caballeros)|Arthur]]'s wizard in Camelot, Merlin has felt that his king has become full of hot air ever since he started his motivational speaking programs. When April, May, and June enter his tower, he becomes fascinated with June's smartphone and addicted to the games on it.

Trying to get them to leave him alone, he lets them mess around with his magic spells, resulting in the girls accidentally summoning a dragon. As he's too absorbed in the game, they have to figure out how to stop the dragon, which fights Arthur and the Caballeros. Eventually, they discover that it can be destroyed by simply throwing the summoning page into Merlin's fire. The plan to destroy the scroll required to summon the dragon was successful, which causes the dragon to be accidentally summoned to be erased, undoing the spell. Later, when Merlin beats the game and discovers that the "1,000,000 gold coins" he won are not real since the coins he won are in-game virtual currencies, he angrily throws the phone into the fireplace, which destroys a clerk at a cellphone store back in Duckburg. Afterwards, Merlin sulks in his workshop feeling bored after his encounter with the nieces.
