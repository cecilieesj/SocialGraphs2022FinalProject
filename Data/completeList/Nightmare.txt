'''Nightmare''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character that appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Mark Hamill]], and in ''[[Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell]]'', voiced by Matthew Waterson.

Nightmare was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Steve Ditko.

==History==
He is a powerful dream demon who uses his ability to manipulate dreams to attack the innocent. Nightmare first uses his powers to put all of [[New York]] into a deep sleep, making the population of [[New York]] vulnerable to his attacks. [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Iron Fist]], [[Nova]] and [[White Tiger]] go to the Dream Dimension (the place where dreams take place, the place everyone goes when they dream after falling asleep) with the help of [[Doctor Strange]] to confront Nightmare. Nightmare uses his powers to create nightmares for the heroes, but Spider-Man's heroic willpower allows everyone to leave the Dream Dimension with a captured Nightmare. Since Nightmare has no powers in the waking world, Doctor Strange casts a spell that imprisons Nightmare in a chest.

Later, Nightmare escapes from the chest and gives Spider-Man a dream that shows a world without Spider-Man, the point being to demoralize him by convincing him that the world is better off without him. However, Spider-Man remains true to his convictions, wakes up, and defeats Nightmare in the waking world.

Later, Nightmare is given his final defeat by [[Hulk]], Doctor Strange, [[Vampire By Night]] and [[Warwolf]].
