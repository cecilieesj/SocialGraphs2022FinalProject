{{Quote|Baltus Van Tassel, the richest farmer in the county.|The Narrator describing him}}
'''Baltus Van Tassel''' is a minor character from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s 1949 short, ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'', a segment of the [[1949]] animated feature film, ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''. He is the father of [[Katrina Van Tassel]] and later becomes father-in-law to [[Brom Bones]].

== Background ==
Baltus Van Tassel is a wealthy farmer. He wears gold chains and jeweled rings, and is never seen without his ivory smoking pipe. He is a short, portly man with a red nose and receding hairline.

Despite his wealth, he is an affable man, escorting his daughter on outings and hosting parties for the townspeople. He seems to like Ichabod as well, smiling as he dances with Katrina, and appreciating Ichabod lighting his pipe for him.

== Appearances ==

=== [[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad|''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'']] ===
Baltus Van Tassel first appears when he, along with his daughter [[Katrina Van Tassel|Katrina]], arrive at Sleepy Hollow by horse-drawn carriage. The narrator describes him as the richest farmer in the county.

Baltus is later seen as [[Ichabod Crane]] fantasizes about his life with Katrina. Ichabod considers Baltus the only person standing in his way to the Van Tassel wealth. He says that "the old goat can't take it with him," implying that Baltus will soon die of old age. Ichabod imagines Baltus fading away, leaving behind his gold chains, rings, and pipe. Then, Ichabod takes his place.

He is then seen at his Halloween Party, enjoying watching Katrina dancing with Ichabod. He runs out of matches to light his pipe. Ichabod dances up to Van Tassel, pulls a match from his pocket, and lights it so Baltus can take a few puffs. It is then mentioned that he called upon his guests to tell him ghost stories while they ate dinner. Afterwards, he isn't seen again, including at his daughter's wedding to [[Brom Bones]].
