==History==
She is a Calderian monster that guards the box of Azimeth. She has guarded the box of Azimeth her entire life, and when Oliver and Kaz came to stop her, they had to defeat her. When Kakai-Rata-Hee-Haw-Mwuaak-Floopy-Pa-zoing was launched at her, she was hit by a rockslide and fell into the lava pit. It's possible that she can shape-shift, as she was seen lowering her jaw past normal human limits to blast lava at Oliver, Skylar, and Kaz. She can project lava from her mouth. Her only appearance is "Do You Want to Build a Lava Man?".
