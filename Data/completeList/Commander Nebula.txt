'''Commander Zeb Nebula''' is the commander of Star Command and Buzz Lightyear's superior, known for his short temper and no-nonsense attitude.

==Background==
Sometime in the past, possibly before Nebula became the Commander, he assumed the role of undercover bounty hunter Shiv Katall, and smuggled defecting minions from [[Emperor Zurg|Evil Emperor Zurg]] into the Galactic Alliance. However, he later passed on the role to [[Buzz Lightyear]], though whether it was due to old age or the loss of his leg is unclear.

===Physical Appearance===
Commander Nebula, although an aging human, is well-built, with a broad chest and shoulders. He is dark-skinned, has a large chin and possesses a gray mustache and gray eyebrows and hair. His mustache occasionally mirrors his mood. His left leg was cut off at the knee, and has been replaced by a peg leg which is also a plasma cannon. He wears a green and white space suit with a gold Star Command logo on the front and also wears a purple headcap just like Buzz.

===Personality and Traits===
Loud, hard-headed and somewhat abrasive, Commander Nebula is known for his gravelly voice and hatred of all things bureaucratic, including paperwork.

He is an excellent commander, as he never orders his Rangers into a situation he would not go into himself. He is not known for tolerance toward insubordination, though he has the grace to admit when he's made a bad call. His peg leg doubles as a plasma cannon.

==Trivia==
*According to Crumford Lorak, Commander Nebula's left leg was taken out by Shiv Katall. However, because Shiv Katall was originally Nebula in disguise, and because Crumford Lorak is sometimes not the most reliable source of information, this is not likely to be true.
