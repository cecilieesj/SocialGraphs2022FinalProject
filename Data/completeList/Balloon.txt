The '''Balloon''', also known as '''B'loon''', is a "character" in the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' franchise. He is an inanimate object, but everyone treats him like a real creature.

==Appearances==
===''[[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]]''===
The Balloon is first shown in [[Christopher Robin]]'s [[Christopher Robin's Room|room]] tied to a note. He is later shown in the [[Zooey Deschanel]] version of ''Winnie the Pooh'' tied to a tricycle. The Balloon is the one that finds Christopher Robin, and it wins a pot of honey as a reward.
==Trivia==
*Balloon is male because [[Rabbit]] says, "He seems to be wearing red today."
*Balloon may have appeared in ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' as the balloon [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] used to capture honey from the [[bees]], but this is unlikely since this balloon is blue.
*Balloon was possibly seen in ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' as the balloon Christopher Robin let Pooh borrow in "[[Balloonatics]]".
*Balloon was likely inspired by the [[1956]] French filmÂ ''{{WikipediaLink|The Red Balloon}}'', about a boy with a sentient red balloon for a companion.
