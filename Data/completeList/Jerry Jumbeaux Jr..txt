==Role in the film==
At Jumbeaux's Cafe, [[Nick Wilde]] enters the restaurant asking Jerry if he can order a [[Jumbo-pop]] for his [[Finnick|son]]. Jerry stubbornly refuses the request on account of the fox's size and species. Just then, [[Judy Hopps]] intervenes and coerces Jerry into giving Nick the popsicle when she threatens to arrest him for health code violations because the parlor staff was not wearing gloved trunks as pointed out by Judy. Not wanting any trouble on his end, Jerry sells Nick the Jumbo-pop, with Judy paying for it.

==Trivia==
*In an earlier draft of the Jumbo-pop scene, Jerry did not turn Nick and Finnick away due to prejudice, but rather because he understandably assumed that Finnick would be unable to finish such a large treat.<ref>''Zootopia'' Blu-ray and digital deleted scenes: "Original Jumbo Pop"</ref>
*According to his profile in ''[[Zootopia: Crime Files]]'', Jerry is approximately 15 ft. tall and approximately weighs 14,980 lbs.
*His name could be a reference to [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] as his initial given name, Jumbo Jr.
*Originally, Jerry's "We reserve the right to refuse service" sign was going to say "No free Jumbo-Pops".
*Jerry Jumbeaux Jr.'s name was intended as a nod to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] from ''Spider-Man'', because co-director [[Jared Bush]] originally thought "the jerk elephant in the ice cream shop" would be played by [[J.K. Simmons]] (who had played JJJ and eventually got to play [[Mayor Lionheart]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=Jared|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1131035698046259200|title=Jared Bush on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|date=May 22, 2019|accessdate=January 18, 2022}}</ref>
