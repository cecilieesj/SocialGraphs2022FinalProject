== Role ==
White Fang was left at the river, but he got out of the waters and onto land. White Fang then walked through the wilderness in the forest, and saw some wolves. He followed them, saw a pack, but he did not socialize with them.

While White Fang was at the forest, he saw again the pack, but one female wolf decided to join him to play.

When Henry was ready to go with White Fang, Lilly wore the white cloth that Henry gave him and ran toward him. She shouted "White Wolf!!" Henry ran toward her. Lilly said "I choose you". Then she hugged him. After that Lilly kissed him. And White Fang's female wolf friend was there. White Fang ran toward her. Like what Henry and Lilly did, she also kissed him and hugged him.

Three months later, White Fang and the wolf had many puppies. Henry and Lilly went at White Fang's place where the puppies where found.
