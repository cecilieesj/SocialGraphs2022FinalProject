==Role in the film==
During the [[1940]] Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from [[London]] to the small village of [[Pepperinge Eye]]. There, they are placed in the care of [[Miss Eglantine Price]], who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. They attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. They learn that she is an apprentice witch, who is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort. In exchange for their silence, she offers them a transportation spell. The spells works on anything twistable, such as a bracelet or a ring, but in this case she enchants a  [[Bedknob (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|bedknob]] that Paul removed from a brass bed in their room. She adds that because Paul was the one who handed it her, it is powerless unless he orders it. When reattached to the bed, it will travel anywhere he asks.
