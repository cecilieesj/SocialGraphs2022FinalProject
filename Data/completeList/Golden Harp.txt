|occupation=Singer}}The '''Golden Harp''' is one of the protagonists of the ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' segment of the [[1947]] animated feature film ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''.

==Background==
===Appearance===
The Golden Harp is a golden living musical harp with yellow dress, red lips, blonde hair, and brown eyes, with strings music.

===Powers and Abilities===
The Golden Harp is a powerful user and living object of magic. She beholds the power to enchant a land with happiness and prosperity by singing and can sing others to sleep.

==Appearances==
===''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''===
The Golden Harp is what provides [[Happy Valley]] with its peace and prosperity until she is stolen by [[Willie the Giant]], where she is locked inside a small chest. [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald]] and [[Goofy]] arrive at Willie's castle to rescue her and use a key to free her inside. To help the three, the Golden Harp puts Willie to sleep so that the three can escape safely. After the three rescue her, the valley is restored to its normal state.

===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===
She makes a cameo appearance during the final scene.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
Although not technically a character, in the [[ABC]] series ''Once Upon a Time'', the Golden Harp is referenced as a normal golden harp, and appears in the episode "[[Tiny (Once Upon a Time)|Tiny]]". This harp is [[Willie the Giant|Anton the Giant]]'s most prized possession and the reason for which he is curious about the human beings.

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
The Golden Harp appears on a float in [[SpectroMagic]] as part of a group of enchanted instruments in a band consisting of Goofy, [[Genie]] and [[Chip and Dale]].

==Trivia==
*The Golden Harp bears some resemblance to both [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] (at least sharing a similar hairstyle with Cinderella's ball outfit) and [[Tinker Bell]]. All three characters were animated by [[Les Clark]], but the Golden Harp made her debut in 1947, three-six years prior to the others.
*Despite her disliking to be held hostage by Willie, she does not seem to fear him, possibly because he is too dim-witted to be intimidating.
*Itâ€™s possible that her mere presence makes Willie happier and even increases his self-esteem.
