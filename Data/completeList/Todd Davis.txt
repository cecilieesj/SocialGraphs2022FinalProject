===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In [[2023]], after [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] traps Westview into a sitcom reality, Todd Davis is cast as Arthur Hart. He is aware of everything that happens, but has no control, and feels Wanda's pain. When she goes to sleep, he suffers from Wanda's nightmares. In this new life, he is still married to his wife, who has now been assigned the identity, of "[[Sharon Davis|Mrs. Hart]]".

After having ended a meeting, Mr. Hart leaves his office, to tell [[Vision]] he is looking forward to the evening he has planned for himself and his wife. He explains that employee dinners are a rite of passage for the new hires, and points to [[Harold Proctor|Jones]], as an example of failure, and owes his success to being a keen judge of character. He then warns that his future in the company, depends on the outcome of the evening.

The night arrives, and Mr. and Mrs. Hart arrive at the Vision Residence. They finds themselves in a dark room, and when Vision leaves to fetch his wife, a woman in a negligee covers Mr. Hart's eyes, and asks him to guess who she is. Vision returns, and turns on the light, revealing the woman behind Mr. Hart to be his wife, [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]]. He quickly explains that his wife is [[Sokovia|Sokovian]], and this is the traditional greeting of hospitality. As Wanda leaves to prepare the meals, Mr. Hart discuss ways in which they can cut costs at work, and when Vision asks what the larger purpose of what their work is, Mr. Hart briefly explains, and makes a snarky comment on Vision's intelligence. They later hear clashes of pots and pans in the kitchen, and when Mrs. Hart leaves to see if Wanda needs any help, Vision quickly breaks into song, and begins a sing-along. Whilst Mrs. Hart participates, Mr. Hart is reluctant to do so. Suddenly Wanda calls for Vision, by referring to him as 'Diane', and he leaves for the kitchen, leaving Mr. Hart perplexed, at the absurd pet name. Wanda leaves the kitchen to join her guests, hoping they're hungry, and provides a fact, stating married men are killing single men at an alarming rate. Mr. Hart questions what she's talking about and becomes curious about a thud he keeps hearing in the kitchen, when Wanda suddenly collapses into his arms. [[Agatha Harkness|Someone]] then knocks on the front door, and hands Wanda a pineapple, and Wanda and Vision explain to the Harts that it was a salesman telegram. When Mrs. Hart begins to feel faint, he points this out to Vision and berates him, following the chaotic events in the household, and asks when they're going to eat. At the same moment, Wanda returns with a laid out table of food, of breakfast for dinner. Mrs. Hart then quickly makes comment on how European the prepared meal is, before Mr. Hart can say anything offensive, presuming the dinner is reflective of Wanda's culture. The four sit down together, and Mrs. Hart questions them about their lives, prior to living in Westview. Vision and Wanda are unable to find an answer, and Mr. Hart further inquires, arguing it's a fairly simple question, and repeatedly asks why them came here. He suddenly begins choking and falls to the ground, forcing Vision uses his synthezoid abilities, to save his boss. Mr. Hart is unaware of what just transpired, and seemingly leaves, as if nothing ever happened. He congratulates Vision on the success of the evening, and tells him, they will talk about a promotion, the following Monday, before departing with his wife.

Whilst he doesn't appear in the second episode, Vision can be seen, accidentally throwing a cup of coffee on him, in the opening sequence for the second episode. [[Abilash Tandon|Norm]] later claims that Arthur's bowling trophies that he polishes, were actually brought at a yard sale in Hackensack.

Eventually the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Wanda leaves Westview, and Mr. Hart regains his identity.
