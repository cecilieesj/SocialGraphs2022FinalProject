{{Quote|That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of 40 out of a privately-funded [[A.I.M.|think tank]], but sure you can call me a botanist.|Maya Hansen|Iron Man 3}}

'''Dr. Maya Hansen''' was a scientist who worked with [[Aldrich Killian]] to perfect [[Extremis]]. She made her first and only cinematic appearance in ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.

Maya Hansen was created by Warren Ellis and Adi Granov.

==Role in the film==
Dr. Maya Hansen is a brilliant scientist and DNA coder whose work helped create the game-changing biological process called Extremis. Her discovery has the power to enhance the human body, but it could be very dangerous if misused.

Maya met [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] at a 1999 New Year's Eve conference in Bern. While partying together, they met [[Aldrich Killian]], who sought Tony's association with his think tank, [[A.I.M.]], despite the contempt of Tony. Maya accepted Killian's contact details with little interest. She later showed Tony her Extremis prototype before they spent the night together. After seeing he had abandoned her the next morning, Maya decides to partner with Killian for her research.

Years later, Maya was present when the alleged [[Ten Rings]] attacked Tony's mansion.

She threatened to kill herself if Killian didn't let Tony go but Killian simply raised his gun a few seconds later and shot her through the chest, killing her.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, [[wikia:c:marvel:Maya Hansen (Earth-616)|Maya Hansen]] meets Tony Stark after Killian's death and he helps her retrieve an Extremis sample sold to terrorists. She is arrested for her role in the sale, which she hoped would renew her laboratory's funding so she could continue her research. Maya is later paroled, joining [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Like in the movie, she died under the custody of A.I.M.
