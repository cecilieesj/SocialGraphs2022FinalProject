'''Joy Bitterman''' is a character and antagonist in ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]''.


==History==
She is the teacher to the ''[[So Random!]]'' cast. Her last name reflects her personality. She claims she has not laughed since she left the Navy and most of the ''So Random! ''cast accepts that statement as fact, when truly, Ms. Bitterman does laugh in the comedy show, or cackles when she is mocking the kids about their less than perfect grades or most other simple mistakes that they make. She also screams loudly as if watching a horror movie when the cast members get F's on their tests.
