'''Sam''' is a character in the [[Disney+]] original series, ''[[Zootopia+]]''.

==Background==
Sam is an otter waitress who works at a fancy restaurant with a pig named Gerald serving as her chef. Though she kindly delivers orders for normal customers during her job as a waitress when it comes to her schedule of attending [[Gazelle]]'s concert, it is shown that she is not used to serving customers who have a slow movement, especially when it comes to sloths. Sam also becomes overwhelmeved when it comes to multitasking when she faced a situation of [[Flash]] and [[Priscilla]] being seated on their seats and other customers complaining as well as her schedule to leave for Gazelle's concert. However, when she notices Flash marrying Priscilla, she reacts to the two in awe alongside Gerald and the other customers. She is also very kind in giving out complements to customers about her work hour time about when she has to stop working and catch up with another schedule (such as the tickets she has for Gazelle's concert earned from her hard work during her duty as a waitress).

==Role in the series==
In "[[Dinner Rush]]", Sam tells her chef Gerald telling her that she will be leaving at 6:00 for [[Gazelle]]'s concert, explaining that she worked hard buying tickets for Gazelle, reminding him that he will leave at 6:00. During her working routine, Sam serves food to a family of leopards, two giraffes, two mice and a lemming and later a birthday cake for [[Zootopia Police Officers|Officers Francine and Higgins]]. Sam then approaches [[Bucky and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson]], who are arguing with each other which she serves them water to calm them down only for them to continue  arguing. Sam returns to his chef where he explains that he is almost wrapped up so she can leave at 6:00 for Gazelle's concert. However, Sam faces another challenge: two sloths named [[Flash]] and [[Priscilla]], not noticing their slow-talking communication. Noticing their slow movements, Sam then gets their seats ready. However, Sam hears Gerald telling her to give the orders to the customers which she does not notice this while trying to deal with the sloths on their seat. Soon as Flash and Priscilla to ready themselves to get their orders, not noticing the other customers getting impatient, which Flash tells her that he will order something bubbly for later - specifically a bubbly drink ranging from the Arctic Spitz, the Rainforest Mist and the Sahara Oasis. However, when Priscilla is about to say her order, Sam quickly says "Quesadilla" which Priscilla says that quesadilla is not good for her, much to Gerald telling Sam that the customers' orders are getting cold while Flash continues talking and noticing the time on the clock where she will leave for Gazelle's concert, Sam shows the sparkling drink to Flash and Priscilla for the two of them, noticing the couple feeling happy.

Soon as Sam allows Flash to pop the cork, Gerald gives more orders for Sam which she hears various overlapped things in her mind: customers complaining, the clock for Gazelle's concert, and many other orders which Sam inadvertently pops the cork from the bottle which ricochets everywhere in the diner. Soon as Sam catches the cork, an angry mob of customers and an angry Gerald confront Sam for providing the worst service ever only for the customers and Gerald to hear Flash about to marry Priscilla which she agrees just as the crowd reacts in awe. Sam approaches Flash and Priscilla saying to the sloths that is has been a pleasure serving them to which the two sloths explains that they are also on their way to go to Gazelle's concert as well. Flash and Priscilla suddenly approach [[Judy Hopps]] and first fox officer [[Nick Wilde]] who approach Flash and Priscilla who are on their way to see Gazelle performing on stage with Sam sitting in the back (recapping the events where the end of where the original ''[[Zootopia]]'' movie took place).

==Trivia==
*The episode "Dinner Rush" is the only one out of the series where the lead is a new character not from the film (in this case, Sam).
