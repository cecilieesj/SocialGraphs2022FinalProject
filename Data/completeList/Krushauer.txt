He has the power of telekinesis, and can crush a car without even laying a hand on it. However, he is unable to "un-crush" something after using his ability. He is part of a group of second-rate [[Supers]] who aspire to join the ranks of superheroes.

==Role in the film==
Krushauer, along with Screech, He-Lectrix, Brick, and Reflux, is first seen in a meeting mingling with other superheroes at Winston's office where he uses his mind to crush a can without touching while showing his ability to Winston.

Later after Elastigirl is captured and brainwashed by Evelyn Deavor, Krushauer and the other Supers break into the Parr family's new home under Evelyn's control to capture the Parr children and Frozone, where Krushauer tried to crush the children by shrinking Violet's force field around them. Later when Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack escape capture and plan to rescue Elastigirl, Mr. Incredible, and Frozone on Winston's ship, Krushauer, Voyd, and Screech try to look out for victims to put Hypno-goggles onto, Screech then tells Krushauer that there are Supers inside the ducts as Krushauer uses his ability to take them out. Jack-Jack suddenly uses his gigantic ability as he falls on the Supers.

The Parr family and Frozone manage to remove all the Hypno-goggles to save the Supers, except for Krushauer who Dash remembered was missing and still has his Hypno-goggles on where Mr. Incredible confronts him as he throws one of the pipes at him and crushes the pipes in the entrance to the engine room, preventing Mr. Incredible from getting in. Mr. Incredible breaks his Hypno-goggles, but Krauscher can't 'uncrush' the pipes and there wasn't enough time to do so anyway, forcing the Supers to find another way to stop the ship.

Later after Evelyn gets arrested, Krushauer and the other superheroes are last seen reinstating the Supers Relocation Program where all the superheroes regain their legal statuses.
