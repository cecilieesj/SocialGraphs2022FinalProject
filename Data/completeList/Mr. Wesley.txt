==Personality==
Wesley is a scrawny businessman working in the black market. He sells the cattle that [[Alameda Slim]] steals for him. Wesley is primarily focused on business and making money. He generally doesn't have any patience for Slim's "unique" ways of stealing cattle and he always tries to get jobs done in a timely fashion.

Mr. Wesley wears a purple top hat with teal band around with brim, a purple tuxedo suit with teal necktie, a white dress shirt with cuffs, white gloves, and purple pants.

==Role in the film==
Wesley first appears towards the end of the film when Alameda Slim and [[the Willie Brothers]] return to their hideout in [[Echo Mine|the old mines]] to buy the herds of cattle that they have stolen. He has a profitable arrangement with Slim, whom he mistakenly refers to Mr. Wesley as "Mr. Weasley." Slim steals cows with his yodeling, Wesley buys them, and Slim uses the ill-gotten money to buy the now-bankrupt farm he stole the cows from. Wesley tries to be punctual and is shown to get very angry when there are any delays. He also reveals that he gave up clown college in a surprised tone after noticing the chaos on the mine shaft. Eventually, Wesley gets beaten up by [[Maggie]], [[Mrs. Calloway]], [[Grace]], [[Lucky Jack]] and [[Buck]], and they lock him in a train cart along with [[Rico]] and the Willies, who are seen beaten up as well. 

It is unknown what happened to Wesley afterwards, but it is presumed that he, along with the Willie Brothers and Rico, end up being arrested (following Slim's arrest) for their crimes; however, in case they were never found, they possibly starved to death locked in the train cart.

==Trivia==
*His voice actor, [[Steve Buscemi]], also voiced [[Randall Boggs]] from ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and [[Monsters University|its prequel]] and [[Bucky (G-Force)|Bucky]] from Disney's ''[[G-Force]]''.
**Mr. Wesley's facial features also look very similar to Buscemi.
*According to Mr. Wesley, he gave up clown college.
*Although Mr. Wesley is businessman working in the black market, he also owns his very own train named "The Getaway Express".
*In some storybooks, Mr. Wesley is inexplicably absent from the story, so his train appears out of nowhere without an explanation.
*Slim's calling him "Wease-ley" as opposed to "Wesley" is similar to the gag associated with the [[Duke of Weselton]] in ''[[Frozen]]'' (and, similarly, [[Duke Weaselton]] in ''[[Zootopia]]'').
