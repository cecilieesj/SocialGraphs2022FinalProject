==Appearances==
===''[[Brother Bear]]''===
A mammoth is seen being ridden by [[Kenai]] while [[Sitka]] and [[Denahi]] are fishing, and the mammoth suddenly knocks Kenai off its back. Later, some mammoth spirits can be seen before Kenai is magically transformed into a bear, and during the song "[[On My Way]]", a herd of mammoths are seen being ridden by Kenai, [[Koda]], [[Rutt and Tuke|Rutt, and Tuke]].

===''[[Brother Bear 2]]''===
In opening of ''Brother Bear 2'', during the song "[[Welcome to This Day]]", a mammoth couple can be seen walking through the wilderness together. Later, during the song "[[Feels Like Home]]", a herd of mammoths are seen being ridden by Kenai, Koda, and [[Nita]] on their way to Hokani Falls.

==Trivia==
*They are based on real-life {{WikipediaLink|woolly mammoth}}s that lived in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]] and existed from 400,000 to 3,000 years ago during the {{wikipediaLink|Pleistocene}} Epoch to the {{WikipediaLink|Holocene}} Epoch.
*During [[Outtakes#Brother Bear|Koda's Outtakes]], one mammoth talks in two scenes: when he accidentally flings Koda backwards and when he unintentionally steps on a gerbil. It is unknown which actor voiced this mammoth.
