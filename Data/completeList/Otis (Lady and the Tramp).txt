==Appearances==
===''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]''===
Otis is first seen at the [[Dog Pound|dog pound]] when [[the Dogcatcher]] puts [[Scamp]] into the kennel with [[Reggie]], to which Otis laughs and tells Scamp that he is in the wrong cage. [[Tramp]] eventually bursts into the pound when Reggie is about to land a fatal blow on Scamp. After a prolonged fight, Otis laughs again when he sees Scamp knocked out and claims that he is done for. When Scamp later wakes up, the dogcatcher comes in to recapture him, but is defeated by [[Angel (Lady and the Tramp)|Angel]]. As Tramp, Scamp and Angel leave the pound, Otis is still laughing but then yells at them to come back and free him as well, which they don't do. It is unknown what happens to him afterwards.
