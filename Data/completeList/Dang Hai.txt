'''Dang Hai''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''. He is the chief of [[Talon (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Talon]] in [[Kumandra]].



==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Dang Hai is an Southeast-Asian man who wears the purple and pink color scheme clothing of his Kumandra tribe, Talon.

==== Personality ====
While not much was shown of Dang Hai, he was an obviously mistrusting person that was clearly jealous of Heart's lush resources, and according to Raya's description of him, he was sneaky, sly, and what he lacked in style he made up for in tactics. He appeared to be slightly vain as well in Raya's description. 

== Role in the film ==
Dang Hai and a few of his people attend the truce meeting of their divided lands, as [[Chief Benja]] of the [[Heart (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Heart land]] wishes for all of them to become [[Kumandra]] again. After the gem was broken to pieces, he took one and kept it at Talon.

When Raya reaches his house in Talon, it is revealed he has been turned to stone by the [[Druun]], while [[Dang Hu]] became the new chief in his place. He is later revived along with the rest of the Druun's victims when the gem is placed back together.
