'''Mr. Wilde''' is a male fox who was cut from the final version of [[2016]] animated film, ''[[Zootopia]]''. He was to be the father of [[Nick Wilde]] and the husband of Mrs. Wilde. According to director [[Byron Howard]], he was discarded from the original film because he would shift away the focus from Nick Wilde.

== Development ==
In some scrapped/deleted content, he and a young Nick attempt to open ''Suit-topia'', a tailoring shop that would cater to every kind of mammal.

In a piece of development art by Matthias Lechner, he was named John Wilde. However, his name has ultimately remained undecided.<ref>https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/719219524797624320</ref>

=== Personality ===
He seemed to be a very kind and pleasurable fox that owned a clothing store called “John Wilde’s; Formal Wear, Formal Hire”.

=== Physical appearance ===
Mr. Wilde somewhat resembles his son Nick in fur color and expression. However, he appears more aged and is more heavily built. He sports a black business suit, a checkered blue shirt, and a lavender-gray tie.

==Trivia==
* Concept art of Mr. Wilde is used to depict Dr. Frank Cunningham in ''The Official Zootopia Handbook''.
