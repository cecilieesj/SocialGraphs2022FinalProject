The '''Hummingbird Trio''' are characters from the [[1946]] [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film, ''[[Song of the South]]''. They are a trio of animated hummingbirds who are prominently featured in the "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" musical sequence.

==Background==
They are a trio of identical pale green hummingbirds with pink throats, light green chests, and black feet. Like most of the inhabitants of the [[Briar Patch]], they are shown to be friendly towards [[Uncle Remus]] indicating that they show kindness to anyone whom they encounter.

==Appearances==

===''[[Song of the South]]''===
During the musical number "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" when [[Mr. Bluebird]] introduces [[Uncle Remus]], three hummingbirds appear next to the [[Sis Moles]] just as they fly near Uncle Remus. While singing "Mr. Bluebird's on my shoulder", the former appears on Uncle Remus' left shoulder and upon saying "It's the truth", the hummingbirds agree with what Uncle Remus says, indicating that they see Mr. Blue Bird on him to which while singing, the hummingbirds follow Mr. Bluebird while Uncle Remus encounters a tree where several [[The Bees (Song of the South)|bees]] are buzzing to the tune. As the bees join in the chorus, the hummingbirds join in with the bees and upon singing "Mr. Bluebird's on my shoulder" again, the bees and the hummingbirds disagree because they don't see him due to Mr. Bluebird hiding. Mr. Bluebird, however, pops up on Uncle Remus' hat and gives a whistle just as the bees and hummingbirds see him just before they fly away while Uncle Remus continues singing only to find [[Br'er Rabbit]] at his house. They make no further appearances after that.

===''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''===
The hummingbirds are one of the animated characters encountered during the "[[Smile Darn Ya Smile]]" musical sequence where [[Eddie Valiant]] (in live-action form) drives his car into the animated [[Toontown]] world where the three of them say, "Hi, Eddie!" as they happily fly past Eddie's car (then "Bye, Eddie!" as they fly off) only to find his car crashed into various [[Toon]] props.

==Trivia==
*In the set of Cartooning Cards released in [[1956]] featuring a ''Song of the South'' theme, one of the hummingbirds is named "'''Sis Hummingbird'''" and is listed as Card 1. Also featured on the back of the card is an instruction teaching readers of how to draw a hummingbird.<ref>https://www.songofthesouth.net/memorabilia/detail.php?id=442</ref>
*Although ''Song of the South'' was never released in any official home video format in the [[United States]], two of the three hummingbirds are sporadically featured on the front cover of the [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]] volume, along with the [[Sis Moles]], [[The Bees (Song of the South)|the Bees]], the [[Butterflies (Song of the South)|Butterflies]], and [[Mr. Bluebird]]. They have also been featured on the volume's UK VHS cover.
*In the [[Magic Kingdom]] version of [[Splash Mountain]], unique to this version are offscreen high-pitched voices heard in three scenes which the high-pitched voices are implied to be hummingbirds, despite not appearing physically in the attraction itself. The high-pitched voices are heard during the outdoor scene of a tree with a few birdhouses on it which are heard singing "[[How Do You Do?]]", the first part of "[[Everybody's Got a Laughing Place]]" overlapped with other characters singing the aforementioned song , specifically the scene before the drop leading to the beehive area, and later during the "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" finale sequence overlapped with other singing characters welcoming Br'er Rabbit home respectively.
*The character [[Flit]] from the [[1995]] Disney animated film, ''[[Pocahontas (film)|Pocahontas]]'' has a striking resemblance to the hummingbirds from ''Song of the South''.
