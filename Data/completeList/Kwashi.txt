He was later replaced by [[Rafiki]].

== Appearance ==
Kwashi is an old and frail baboon with a long silver beard and mane, and brown fur. His nose is pink, and his face is a pale brown.

== Personality ==
Kwashi's personality is similar to that of Rafiki's. However, he is purely wise and not a touch insane. He is a truthful and honest character, not containing the truth even if it does hurt.

== Information ==
Kwashi meets [[Simba]] for the first time while picking blossoms. The prince is looking for his friend [[Nala]]. Later, when the lion is a teenager and [[Mufasa]] is defeated by the evil [[Scar]], Kwashi instructs Simba to run across the desert to escape the hyenas and to stay alive. When he believes the prince to have failed him, he looks for another lion to help free the [[Pride Lands]]. Instead, he finds Simba again, older and stronger, and helps the lion take back his kingdom.{{TheLionKingWiki}}
