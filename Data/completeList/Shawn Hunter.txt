'''Shawn Hunter''' is the secondary main character of ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and a recurring character in ''[[Girl Meets World]]''.

==Information==
Shawn is the lifelong best friend of [[Cory Matthews]] and [[Topanga Matthews]]. Shawn had a rocky upbringing, having been abandoned by his stepmother multiple times, as well as his father, who ended up dying of a heart attack just as he and Shawn reconciled.

At the end of ''Boy Meets World'', Shawn moved to New York along with Cory, Topanga, and Eric. He left New York the day after Riley was born, and has since traveled around as a photographer and a writer.
