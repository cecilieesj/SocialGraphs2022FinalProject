}}'''Hobgoblins''' are creatures from the animated series ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''.

==Role in the series==
Hobgoblins are a race of armored clan goblin-like orcs. They love to terrorize stuff. They even like Leprechaun gold.

A gang of evil ones were seen, but [[Jake Long|Jake]] and [[Haley Long|Haley]] defeated them<ref>[[Family Business (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Family Business]]</ref>.

Jake stopped a bunch of Hobgoblins for attacking Leprechauns, unaware they just wanted their gold back. Jake hired them to help stop the Huntsclan to get the one of the [[The 13 Aztec Skulls|Aztec Skulls]] and he repays them a bag full of a lot of Leprechaun gold and two golden motorcycles<ref>[[Fool's Gold]]</ref>.

Krunkers and [[Fu Dog]] were challenging four Hobgoblins in the DMC, but Krunkers just kept hitting Fu a lot of times<ref>[[Nobody's Fu]]</ref>.

These armored goblins are also the Top 13 Threats to the Magical Community.
