==Trivia==
*The musicians' order from the left to the right: Brass section (Dolores, Lips, other trumpet players), Floyd, Crazy Harry (season 1), Animal, Zoot, Rowlf. Janice either sat [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Orchestra# next] to Lips or next to Zoot.
*''([http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/It%27s_a_Very_Merry_Muppet_Christmas_Movie It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie])'' features a more extended orchestra. Dr. Teeth, Animal, Floyd and Zoot sat on the left; Eugene the tuba player, a harp player, a violinist and Rowlf sat on the right. The conductor was an unnamed Whatnot as well. This is the first time [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Dr._Teeth Dr. Teeth] takes place in the Muppet Theatre's orchestra pit. He was also seen conducting in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_Take_Manhattan The Muppets Take Manhattan]''.
*During the first season, Zoot sat on the left of the orchestra pit; during the next seasons, he had his place next to Rowlf.
*Two episodes feature an instrumental UK spot as performed by the orchestra in the pit: [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_504:_Shirley_Bassey episode 504] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_524:_Roger_Moore episode 524].
*In two episodes, the Orchestra Pit was seen empty except for Rowlf on his piano. These are [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_123:_Kaye_Ballard episode 123] and [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_204:_Rich_Little episode 204].
*[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_308:_Loretta_Lynn Episode 308] took place at a railroad station instead of the theater. Therefore, the band played the closing theme, as well as the opening theme, on the left side of the station. The closing theme sounded rather off-key, since they were playing a timetable.
*In [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_321:_Roger_Miller episode 321], the musicians had caught "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Cluckitis Cluckitis]" and turned to chickens.
*In [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_514:_Mac_Davis episode 514], clones of [[Beaker]] took over the orchestra pit.
*Occasionally, a 'continuity goof' occurred on ''The Muppet Show''; musicians from the orchestra pit would be on stage at the same time; a wide shot of the audience would feature musicians in the pit that were not featured, or leave some musicians out; etc.
*In ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets:_A_Celebration_of_30_Years The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years]'', ''[[Muppet*Vision 3D]]'', and ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Classic_Theater Muppet Classic Theater]'', the orchestra was played by [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Penguins penguins]. The ''Muppet*Vision'' orchestra is [[Nicky Napoleon and His Emperor Penguins]]. The ''Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years'' orchestra included both [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Dr._Teeth_and_the_Electric_Mayhem Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem] and various penguins, conducted by Nigel.{{MuppetsWiki}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Muppet Orchestra, The}}
