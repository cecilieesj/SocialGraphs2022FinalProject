|quote = }}'''Fifinella''' is the name given to female [[Gremlins]]. According to Roald Dahl's book, out of every 12 Widgets (baby Gremlins) born, only one becomes a Fifinella.
==Background==
===Development===
Fifinella was a female Gremlin designed to represent females of the Gremlin species in Roald Dahl's work ''The Gremlins''. Only one was designed by the Walt Disney company. However, when the film was scrapped, so was the character.

She would later be adopted as the symbol of the Women's Air Service Pilots division of the US Air Force when Disney was designing insignia for the Military.

===Physical appearance===
The Fifinella is much more feminine than the Gremlins. Their horns are more curled, their proportions are more human-like, and oddly they lack noses.

==Appearances==
She was to appear in ''The Gremlins'' as produced by Walt Disney, but since the project was cancelled, she only appears in the book and comics featuring the Gremlins.
==Trivia==
*A Fifinella was designed as the mascot for the 319th Army Air Force's Flying Training Detachment in Houston, Texas. She was nicknamed "Fifi"
