==''[[The Moon-Spinners]]''==
He has a high interest in astrology, using it be one step ahead of things, even though her little sister objects it. He came back from [[London]], handling unfinished business (getting treasure he stole back from the Bay of Dolphins). His Cousin, Lambis serves as his henchman. When he found out Nikki Ferris has been hanging with Mark Cramford, he figured she has got involved in the matter, so he had to get her out of the way, like tying her to an old windmill. Even though he sent money to his sister money for things like the Hotel, Stratos threaten to kill his sister's son, AlexisÂ if she went to the police about Stratos. He appears to be hired by Gambles who was claimed to be the British Consort, but he's really a antiquity dealer.
