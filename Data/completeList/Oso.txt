{{Quote|It's all part of the plan. More or less.|Oso when he fails a training exercise}}
'''Oso''' is a special agent and the main protagonist in Disney's television series ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'' and its short, "[[Special Agent Oso: Three Healthy Steps]]".

==Personality==
Oso is brave, kind, and adventurous. He likes doing training exercises and helping kids out when each one wants to learn something new. Throughout the special assignments, he is always compassionate and encourages them in turn.

==''[[Special Agent Oso]]''==
Oso is overweight small panda like bear. Oso is a stuffed yellow bear, he has brown eyes. He has green patches around his eyes and wears a black sleeveless jacket with Paw Pilot on his right side of it. He also has a short round green bear like-tail, and a watch commutator on his left wrist who likes to pass through training exercises and help kids out. He is important to his friends/helpers, Dotty, Wolfie, Buffo, and Musa, who tell him what to do in every exercise. He inadvently fails when he first tries to do them, stops to help  kid(s) learn something new, and does the training exercise right with a tip from a child, and earns a training award in the first season and a digi-medal for helping a kid out. Throughout the series, Oso breaks the fourth wall to the viewer, also giving the viewer's assistance as well as rewarding him/her with a digi medal for their hard work as well.

==Other appearances==
Oso sometimes wears other clothes in physical training exercises. He wears a green space-bodysuit and helmet in space, usually an orange life jacket when he is on a boat, a green scuba diving jumpsuit, helmet and swim fins when he goes diving, and a blue racing helmet, track-suit-like jumpsuit and vivid blue sneakers when he's riding in his race car. On occasion, he has also worn a tuxedo.

==Trivia==
* Sometimes he always likes to help out kids.
* His name, Oso, means "Bear" in Spanish, and he has never even mentioned it.
**However, [[Felipe]] mentions this fact in "[[The Manny with the Golden Bear]]".
*Despite being a special agent, the show's nature wasn't meant for fighting crime and killing bad guys which mostly happen in the James Bond movies, as well as the classic Disney series' [[Kim Possible|Kim Possible.]] Instead, Oso mostly helps out children get their task done, not kill bad guys or foil a villains plot. The training exercises were just meant for Oso to improve his skills.
