===''[[The Cookie Carnival]]''===
He is walking along the rails of a train on the outsides of Cookie Town when he suddenly heard the cry of a [[Sugar Cookie Girl]]. He goes to her direction and he learns from her that she wants to participate in the Cookie Parade, but she can't do it because she doesn't have any fancy clothes to wear for the occasion. Deciding to help her, the Hobo Cookie assures her that she will be the sweetest one of all, and gives her a full makeover so she will be able to participate in the parade.

He starts her makeover with dying her brown hair to blonde with taffy, styling it into a long updo. Then, he creates a dress using a cupcake's base, decorating it with eclair cream of blue, purple and white colors, trowing heart-shaped sweets on her dress and finishing it by giving her a big purpled ribbon on her back. He finalizes her makeover by doing her makeup out of powdered marshmallows and red heart-shaped candy.
Once that was done, he gives her a mirror so she could see herself and sneaks her at the end of the parade after he was given her approval. The girl is elected queen of the parade, and both of them are separated by the townspeople who trampled him while they carried the queen to her throne.

During the show, he attempts to have a better view of her but ends up being chased by the guards who noticed him. He attempts to hide behind the cake where the suitors were performing and is quickly spotted after he thought he was safe. With no options left, he climbs up to the top to meet her behind the red carpet and ends up beaten by two angry guards who chased him. As he was about to receive another hit from the guards, the Cookie girl saves him by announcing that he will be their King, much to his surprise and glee. At the end of the cartoon, both attempt to have an intimate kiss in their thrones but their love is so warm it melted the lollypop they used to cover it.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Hobo had a cameo along with one of the [[Judges]] in the episode "[[Pete's Christmas Caper]]". When [[Ludwig Von Drake]] bites the head off a (non-sentient) gingerbread man, Hobo and the Judge are shown looking horrified about it. This scene was reused in the compilation film ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.
