'''Baby Booby''' is the newborn son of [[Mrs. Booby]]. He only appeared in the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers|Rescue Rangers]]'' episode "[[Three Men and a Booby]]". [[Jim Cummings]] provided his vocal effects.

The young bird was being cradled and cared for by his mother while he was just an egg. But from out of the blue, he was stolen by an egg-shaped helicopter belonging to Mr. Humpert Dumpty. He was rescued by the Rangers while his mom was fending off his captors. While Gadget was working on a new invention to infiltrate Mr. Dumpty's mansion, the other Rangers looked after him during the time he hatched out.
