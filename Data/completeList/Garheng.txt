'''Garheng''' is a character in the [[2011]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''.

==Background==
Garheng appeared to be a little sadistic at first. During a plan to get the tears from the mermaid [[Syrena]] for the ritual, he even threatened her to get the tears from her in a harsh manner. When Blackbeard was defeated for good, Garheng later joined [[Hector Barbossa]] to be part of his crew, alongside the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew.

On board the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', Garheng worked with the ship's crewmen working with a shanghaied [[Jack Sparrow]] who was dissatisfied with him sailing under [[Angelica]] and participated in Jack's mutiny. Jack's crew was victorious against the ambush until [[Blackbeard]] approaches the groups to which he hung all of the crewmen, alongside Garheng. Garheng and the rest of the crew later were let down to notice the Cook's punishment.

In a plan to to find a mermaid at [[Whitecap Bay]] and obtain her tears for the ritual, the crew manages to capture a surviving mermaid named "[[Syrena]]" after surviving a massive battle. Garheng later traveled through the Jungle Pools in finding the [[Fountain of Youth]] to which he and the rest of the crew obtain a tear from Syrena for the ritual.

Arriving at the Fountain, [[Hector Barbossa]] and his crew approach Garheng and the rest of the crew, followed by a battle occurring at the Fountain between the British soldiers and Blackbeard's crew until the [[Spaniard]] arrives to destroy the Fountain. After Blackbeard dies, Garheng and the rest of the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew later join Barbossa and had the ''Revenge'' set sail for [[Tortuga]].
