'''Ralph and Eddie''' are two carnivorous snakes from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series, who appear in the episode "[[Brazil Nuts]]".

==Appearance==
Ralph is a grayish-blue snake with a light blue-gray chest, yellow eyes with red pupils, yellow pointy teeth sticking out of his mouth, red diamond-shaped spots, and has a bandage at the end of his tail.

Eddie is a pink snake with red hair, yellow chest, buck teeth, and blue spots.

==Role in the series==
Ralph and Eddie build an All-you-can-eat bug buffet for [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] so that they can trap them and eat them. While Timon and Pumbaa are at the bug buffet, they meet Eddie. Timon mistakes Eddie for a waiter and asks him to go get some ants and the pink snake agrees.

Eddie goes to Ralph to tell him that they need ants, but Ralph hits him and tells him that they are supposed to eat them. He then tells Eddie to go get horseradish. Pumbaa overhears the conversation and goes to Timon to tell him that the snakes are going to eat them.

Pumbaa then gets captured and Timon runs into Ralph. After Timon tells the snake about the ants, Ralph apologizes for not bringing some and then he tells the meerkat that there are some bugs in a private dining room.

While Timon and Pumbaa are trapped in a net, Eddie returns and shows Ralph that he brought a horse and a radish, which makes Ralph angry because he asked him to bring horseradish. After Timon and Pumbaa escape, Ralph puts the horse and the radish on a rocket. Timon and Pumbaa show the snakes that they built a restaurant. When they take them there, the snakes find out that they're at the Amazon river. They fall and get attacked and (presumably) eaten by piranhas.
