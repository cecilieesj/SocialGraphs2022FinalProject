[[Nala]] (niece)}}'''Dwala''' is a lioness who was set to appear in ''[[The Lion King]]'' when it was initially titled ''[[King of the Jungle]]''. She is the sister of [[Sarabi]], and the aunt of [[Simba]] and [[Nala]]. 

==Appearance==
Dwala's appearance is unknown.

==Personality==
Though her personality is not explored, Dwala is shown to be much more childlike than her sisters, indicating that she is the youngest.

==Information==
====January 1990 version====
In ''The Lion King'' written by J.T. Allen, Diku, Dwala, [[Sarabi]] and [[Naanda]] hunt and take down a zebra while [[Mufasa]], [[Zazu]], [[Simba]], and [[Nala]] watch. Later, as young Simba and Nala are playing amongst the lionesses during the night, they bump into Dwala, who playfully snarls and swats the cubs with her tail. After Scar kills Mufasa and Simba is presumed dead, Dwala and Diku attempt to calm Scar down when Sarabi attacks Baasho.

When Simba returns and defeats Scar, the lionesses look down on Banagi and [[Baasho]] before Simba decides to banish them to the desert.

====May 1990 version====
In ''King of the Beasts'' written by Allen and Ron Bass, Dwala sits alongside her sisters and Simba as Mufasa watches a fire raging near the border of their lands. When all options fail, Mufasa gives a signal to [[Sarabi]] to run, and the lionesses and the animals of the kingdom flee. Next, when Simba and Nala are adolescents, Dwala is implied to be hunting with the lionesses. After Simba's journey with Mufasa ends and the lions return to Pride Rock, she and Diku try to persuade Mufasa into staying there for the night. Soon after, she and the lionesses gather to see Mufasa challenge [[Scar]] in a duel at the fire tree bridge, which ends with Mufasa's death.

When Sarabi scolds Nala for standing up against Scar, Dwala asks Sarabi if giving in to Scar would be a better option. When Nala decides to form a false interest in Scar in order to turn him against the hyenas, Dwala tells Nala not to attempt such a plan. After Simba returns and defeats Scar and the hyenas, the lionesses look on with tears in their eyes. Finally, Dwala stretches along with her sisters and niece like "Egyptian goddesses" across the kopje, watching the herd graze fully healthy again.
