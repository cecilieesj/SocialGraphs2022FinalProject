==Biography==

===='''Early Life'''====
Hans was an old friend of Gordon Bombay as a kid and his family in the 1970s. He was also close with his father as he mentioned to Gordon that his father would be proud of him today. Hans ran a hockey sports store called "Hans Sports Shop" that Gordon worked there when he was a bit older. He was paid a minimum salary by Hans' brother [[Jan (The Mighty Ducks)|Jan]].

===='''''The Mighty Ducks'''''====
When Gordon abandoned hockey, he lost contact with Hans for years. Hans reappeared when he saw that Gordon was coaching the [[District 5 Ducks|District 5 team]]. He disapproved of the methods that Gordon was doing when teaching the District 5 kids as evidenced by his sort-of-cold look after the game against the Hawks. Gordon tracked Hans down back to his shop and entered through the backdoor as Hans remarked he used to when he was younger at that time of night.

Hans encouraged Gordon to teach the District 5 kids to play for the love of the game like Gordon did when he was a kid before Coach Reilly corrupted him, and to teach them to "fly". He then gave Gordon skates which Bombay used to skate later on that evening, and with Hans influence and Mr. Ducksworth’s name, created the Mighty Ducks.

Hans went on continuing to mentor Gordon throughout the film, even encouraging him to recruit Adam Banks to the Mighty Ducks. Hans was present during the final game of the Mighty Ducks vs the Hawks and congratulated Gordon Bombay on his victory.

===='''''D2: The Mighty Ducks'''''====
Hans did not appear in D2: The Mighty Ducks but was mentioned by his brother Jan, saying that he went home to Scandinavia to see their mother, as she loved him best of them both.

===='''''D3: The Mighty Ducks'''''====
When Gordon left to the Junior Goodwill games division, Hans became a mentor figure to Charlie Conway. Like he did with Gordon, Hans loved playing small jokes with Charlie like pretending he hurt his finger. Charlie talks to Hans about Coach Orion and mentions that he is not receptive to Orion's new methods of hockey. Hans simply replies by asking if Charlie is willing to accept new methods.

Hans was at his home listening to the Ducks take on the Bears on his radio. He was cheering them on, but became discouraged when Charlie acted unsportsman-like. Hans had fallen ill, but kept it a secret from Charlie. When Charlie visited Hans, he encouraged him to go back and re-join the ducks, mentioning that it was where he belonged and that Orion was only pushing him hard because of his potential. His last words in the film where "Goodbye Charlie", when Charlie left his house.

Charlie’s mother informed Charlie that Hans had passed away. A funeral was held for Hans, with Gordon Bombay returning. He placed a jersey on Hans grave and said to the Ducks. "Every time you touch the ice, remember it was Hans that taught us to fly".

==Legacy==
Hans' influence would still be evident in the Ducks. Before their final match against the Varsity Warriors, the Ducks skated in a circle and touched the ice as a Norwegian symbol of respect to their fallen friend.

If it was not for Hans as well, the Ducks might not have existed and Gordon would not have re-gained his love of the game of Hockey.

==Trivia==
*Hans has similarities to Karate Kid's Mr. Miyagi.
*Hans is from Scandinavia.
*Hans' jersey is numbered #11 like the one that [[Dave Karp]] wears.
