'''Dr. NoGood''' is a minor antagonist in ''[[DuckTales]]'', featured in the episode "[[Double-O-Duck]]". He was the original leader of [[F.O.W.L.]], who was killed at the end of his lone appearance and succeeded by High Command.

==Appearance==
He is an anthropomorphic dog wearing a tan business suit.

==Trivia==
*His name is a play on the ''James Bond'' villain Dr. No, while his role, characterization and other aspects of his character (head of a criminal organization, has a cat as a pet) are reminiscent of another famous James Bond villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
*Despite being killed off at the end of his single appearance on ''DuckTales'' and thus never appearing on ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', Dr. NoGood has been confirmed to appear in Dynamite Entertainment's upcoming ''[[Darkwing Duck (comic book)|Darkwing Duck]]'' comic.
