'''Gert Yorkes''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who appears in the Hulu series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'', played by Ariela Barer. She is a teenager who, when she learns that her parents are supervillains, joins the superhero fugitive team known as [[the Runaways]].
She is the daughter of bioengineers Dale and Stacey Yorkes.

Gert is a strong believer in the concept of justice, having increasingly progessive ideas regarding gender, racial and social equality. She views those who prey on the innocent as having failed society as a whole.

Gert is psychically linked with [[Old Lace]], a dinosaur brought back to life due to Dale and Stacey's experiments. Since Gert has no special powers or weapons, she often has to rely on Old Lace to help her during combat. Old Lace is a trusted ally of Gert.
