[[File:Hr (2).png|left|thumb|220x220px|Grandma Goofy, as drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] in ''Dr. X''.]]Goofy's grandma later made an appearance in ''[[Super Goof]]: The Granny Hang-Up''.<ref>https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+SG+++42-01</ref> Goofy's living room is adorned with pictures of his beloved grandmother. After her grandson calls her for help, she single-handedly defeats a bank robber using her umbrella.  
Grandma Goofy had a prominent role in the ''Mickey Mouse'' comic <nowiki/>''Topolino e l'insolita indagine ''("Mickey and the Unusual Investigation"),'' ''<nowiki/>in which [[Mickey Mouse |Mickey]] doesn't seem too pleased with her presence.

When Goofy was young, he and [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] once borrowed some of his Grandma's clothing to disguise themselves so that they could spy on their opponent's soccer team without being noticed, as mentioned in ''Paperino e Topolino in: la finale, finalmente'' ("Donald and Mickey: The Final, Finally"). In this story, Goofy also mentions that his grandma is a big fan of F.C. Duckburg, [[Duckburg]]'s local soccer team.

=== ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' ===
Grandma Goofy made her first animated appearance (eventually being revealed to be Goofy in disguise) in "[[Goofy's Grandma]]", the twenty-fourth episode of ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'', where she was voiced by [[Bill Farmer]].

=== ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' ===
In "[[The Big Good Wolf (The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse)|The Big Good Wolf]]", Grandma Goofy made a cameo on portrait in [[Goofy]]'s house.

== Trivia ==
*Although her first name is unknown in the original version, she's called '''Goofine''' in German.
*Though unseen, Goofy mentions his '''Granmammy''' in the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' episode "[[Tub Be or Not Tub Be]]" as having a recipe for a saltwater taffy so sticky that once one has sunk their teeth into it, they "won't get them out for days."
