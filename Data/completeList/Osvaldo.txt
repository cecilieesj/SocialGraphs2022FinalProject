'''Osvaldo Orozco Ortiz'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thejaredbush/status/1475114322476998656|title=Osvaldo's Name|website=Twitter|last=Bush|first=Jared|date=December 26, 2021|access-date=December 27, 2021}}</ref> is a character who appears in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Encanto]]''.

==Background==
First seen after "[[The Family Madrigal]]", Osvaldo approaches [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] with a delivery, since she's the only [[The Madrigals|Madrigal]] child with no gift. He then decides to give her a basket full of party hats, paper weathervanes, pots, candy, clappers, and much other stuff (which he calls "The Not Specials' Special"). Osvaldo also tells Mirabel to wish [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]] good luck for him, commenting that the last gift ceremony (Mirabel's) was a bummer. He is later seen being greeted by [[Camilo Madrigal|Camilo]], who shape-shifts to look like him and attempts the ceremony where Antonio gets the ability to talk with animals. Osvaldo was seen in the village a few times, during "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]", he mentions that [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] told him he'd grow a gut and it happened. After Bruno, [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela]] and Mirabel return to the village, Osvaldo and the whole town gather together to help the Madrigals rebuild [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]], which results in the magic being restored.

===Personality===
Osvaldo seems to be a nice guy, deciding to give Mirabel "The Not Specials' Special" to make her feel special since she has no gift, but he seemed to address this fact in an insensitive way by not realizing how Mirabel felt about it. However, Osvaldo still seems to have a kind heart and helps the Madrigals rebuild their house after it was destroyed.

===Physical appearance===
Osvaldo is a short Colombian man with brown hair, brown eyes, and a mustache. He wears a long-sleeved white and grey-striped shirt with buttons, black pants, and brown sandals.

==Role in the film==
Osvaldo is first seen giving a delivery package to [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] where he explains to her that she is the only Madrigal family member with no special gift just before bidding her a good luck for her cousin [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]]'s gift just before leaving. Later that night during the musical number, "[[Colombia, Mi Encanto]]", [[Luisa Madrigal|Luisa]] encounters Osvaldo and helps out with the donkeys just before Camilo encounters him and greets him just before greeting other people approaching the [[Casa Madrigal|Casita]]. Later during the musical number, "[[We Don't Talk About Bruno]]", he is seen during the verse where he fears that [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] gave him a negative effect after listening to him. Osvaldo is later seen amongst the crowd of townspeople during the climax of the film where [[Alma Madrigal|Alma]] tells them that the magic is strong and they are the Madrigal family, not noticing the negative effects.

Later at the end of the film, Osvaldo is seen in the crowd of townspeople helping the Madrigal family rebuild the Madrigal family's house throughout the musical number, "[[All of You]]" just as the Casa Madrigal is successfully built with cooperation between the Madrigals and the townspeople.
