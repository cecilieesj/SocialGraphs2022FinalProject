== Background ==
Showing up only as a projected shadow, Chubby Cheddar performs [[Let's Exercise]], a parody of "The Twist" while holding a cheese grater over his head.

=== Development ===
Though his appearance suggests shadow puppetry, Chubby Cheddar was a fully dimensional puppet with three performers controlling his mouth, his dancing legs, and the cheese grater over his head, shot in front of a green screen.
