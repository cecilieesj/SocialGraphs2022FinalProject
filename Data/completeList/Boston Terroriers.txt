==History==
The man who will called himself '''Plymouth Rocker '''was a low-range costumed criminal from [http://marvel.wikia.com/Boston Boston]. After a track race aboard a stolen bullion van, he was stopped by [http://marvel.wikia.com/Peter_Parker_(Earth-TRN123) Spider-Man] (who had just joined the city on the Mayor's proposition).

The woman who will called herself the '''Salem's Witch '''was a low-range costumed criminal from [http://marvel.wikia.com/Boston Boston]. After a museum robbery, she was stopped by [http://marvel.wikia.com/Peter_Parker_(Earth-TRN123) Spider-Man] (who had just joined the city on the Mayor's proposition).

The man who will called himself '''Slam Adams''' was a low-range costumed criminal from [http://marvel.wikia.com/Boston Boston]. After a purse stealing, he was stopped by [http://marvel.wikia.com/Peter_Parker_(Earth-TRN123) Spider-Man] (who had just joined the city on the Mayor's proposition) and surrounded by the police forces.

This group was formed when [http://thedailybugle.wikia.com/wiki/Steel_Spider Ollie] was angry after being rejected by [http://thedailybugle.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man Spider-Man] in refusal of having a sidekick, released the three criminals and suited them with armors. Then they went after Spidey. In a short fight, the trio managed to take the web-head down for their leader. But after Spidey forgave Ollie, they later rebelled against their leader after they heard about the 10 million dollar reward to those who unmask the webhead from Spidey and were determined to get it.

This led to a brief battle between three armored villains and two spiders around [[Boston]]. The trio were defeated after the two heroes used the switch-off failsafe to immobilize them. They were later sent to jail.
