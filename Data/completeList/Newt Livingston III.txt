'''Newton "Newt" Livingston III '''([[Jason Dolley]])<span style="font-family:sans-serif;line-height:19px;"> is the son of a senator and the </span>Chief Justice<span style="font-family:sans-serif;line-height:19px;">, the best friend of Meena Paroom and </span>[[Cory Baxter]]<span style="font-family:sans-serif;line-height:19px;">. He is a bit clueless and he loves rock and roll. He also has some similar characteristics as [[Raven Baxter|Raven]]'s friend [[Chelsea Daniels]], (from </span>[[That's So Raven]]<span style="font-family:sans-serif;line-height:19px;">) and Cory's friend Larry. He loves to say, "Awesome!" at something that is not really 'awesome', like when the school students were getting flu shots. Somehow, he is not smart enough to figure out obvious things, yet he has the knowledge to solve confusing things. He plays the guitar (his favorite being a </span>''Squier Stratocaster''<span style="font-family:sans-serif;line-height:19px;">), and is part of DC3. He also knows about Cory's crush on Meena. He appears to use jeans and chains whenever he is not in any particular costume. He is funny and immature. Sophie once had a crush on him. He is like Chelsea because he doesn't really notice the obvious and is really friendly. He hates the idea of running for student body president, as he doesn't think he'll make a good leader, and it would totally throw off his carefree lifestyle, despite his parent's wanting him to. Even worse is that if he did run for student body president he says he would win even though he wouldn't try thanks to "the Livingston Curse" a curse meaning that any Livingston will win no matter what (though many people would take that as a blessing). Between his parents, his fear of leadership, and the Livingston Curse, Newt has been forced (though he enjoys it) to make up excuses for his parents as to why he can't run for student body president, naming the day of the year he makes them up "Excuse Day". It didn't work as his father had been attacked by a porcupine, and to Newt's "surprise" the water shooting thing didn't really happen. His guitar is a Cherry Flaming Red Fender that is tuned for rock 'n roll.</span>

==Appearance==
Newt sports a shaggy blond hairstyle and wears a lot of skinny long shirts and flat jeans. He's usually seen with a guitar on his back.

==Personality==
His personality is 50% smart and 50% dumb. He does and says a lot of crazy stuff. Newt tends to be happy most of the time but can sometimes be disappointed, such as when Cory and Meena don't like one of his ideas.
