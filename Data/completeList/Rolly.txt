{{quote|I'm hungry, [[Perdita|mother]]. I'm hungry.|Rolly|One Hundred and One Dalmatians}}
'''Rolly''' is an obese [[Dalmatian puppies|Dalmatian puppy]] who first appeared in the [[1961]] animated film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''. Rolly is named for his “rolly-polly” physique. With a hefty appetite, he is the largest of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita]]’s litter.

==Background==
===Personality===
Rolly is known for his excessively large appetite. He can be gentle and carefree at times, but after his family, food may be his true love. Even after just eating, Rolly can be seen asking for food and the only one of the puppies constantly starving. He may even put his life in jeopardy for a decent meal every now and then.

===Physical appearance===
Rolly is a obese dalmatian puppy with a red collar (or blue in the TV series).

==Appearances==
===''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''===
Rolly is one of [[Pongo]] and [[Perdita |Perdita's]] [[Dalmatian Puppies|fifteen puppies]]. He is the heaviest of the puppies and is constantly hungry. He is usually heard asking his parents for food, even after being rescued from [[Jasper and Horace]] by his parents. When the Dalmatians attempt to disguise themselves by rolling in soot to look like Labradors, Pongo quickly sends Rolly back, as Rolly was only half covered. At the end when the puppies returned home, Rolly was seen yet again asking his mother for dinner.

===''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''===
Rolly is one of the three main puppies in the series; the other two being [[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] and [[Cadpig]]. Like his original film appearance, his gluttonous appetite is one of his main flaws, and his desire for food has been known to cause problems for himself and also his siblings. However, he is said to have the strongest sense of smell out of the other Dalmatians. He is also shown to be very loyal and helpful, but takes great offense to being called "fat" and would strongly deny it. Additionally, Rolly often hesitates when it comes to going on adventures with his siblings, and prefers to remain out of conflicts even if they could really use his assistance.

===''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''===
Rolly has adapted perfectly to his life with the other 84 puppies, yet retains his gluttonous appetite as seen when he tries to eat two bowls of [[Kanine Krunchies]]. Later on, Rolly and his siblings are kidnapped, and when they are rescued by Patch, Rolly acts as his second-in-command. He is the first one to bounce off one [[Lars]]' paintings they used as a trampoline to exit the warehouse through the open roof window. They use a tram to escape Cruella, but Rolly begins slipping out and gets captured by Cruella herself. Patch's quick thinking enables him to rescue his brother, and they all return home safely.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Being the most overweight of the puppies, Rolly's cameos on ''House of Mouse'' were not hard to spot. In "[[Pluto Saves the Day]]", he and Patch join an all-dog band singing "[[Everybody Wants to Be a Woof]]", parodying the song "[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]" from ''[[The Aristocats]]''. Later in that same episode, Rolly is seen with the other Pet Shop Dogs fighting off [[Pete]] (who is disguised as [[Snow White]]) and then chasing him out along with the rest of the dogs and [[Pluto]]. Like in ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'', Rolly sports a blue-collar instead of red.

==[[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]]==
Rolly makes an appearance at the [[Midship Detective Agency]] attraction in the game, "Case of the Missing Puppies." As the detectives look around the ''[[Disney Fantasy]]'' cruise ship with Pongo, [[Roger Radcliffe|Roger]], and [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], they find Rolly with his stomach stuck in one of the vent shafts. He is able to get free from the vent, then notices the detectives and licks the screen, with them closer to finding the other Dalmatians on the ship.

==Trivia==
*As with all the males in the original 15 Dalmatian puppies, Rolly wears a red collar in the original film and in ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''. In the TV series, however, he wears a blue collar like the female pups. He also wears the blue collar in his cameos on ''[[House of Mouse]]''.
*His name is most likely a reference to Disney Imagineer, [[Rolly Crump]].
*He is very similar to [[Tummi Gummi]] from ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Gummi Bears]]'', [[Broadway]] from ''[[Gargoyles]]'', [[Circus Bugs#Heimlich|Heimlich]] from ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', and [[Budderball]] from the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' series]], as all five love food and have gluttonous appetites.
