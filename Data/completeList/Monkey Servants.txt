==Background==
Most of the monkeys were used as candelabras (having to hold multiple candles), and two of them held a cushion that [[Alice Kingsleigh]] (using her Um from Umbridge alias), was reluctant to sit on.

As Alice is taken to the Red Queen's throne due to her request of giving Alice new clothes, she offers Alice to sit on the table. Due to Alice's size, she cannot sit properly on the seat, causing the monkeys to retreat. During a conversation between the Red Queen and the Knave of Hearts, the [[Nivins McTwisp|White Rabbit]] sees the [[Oraculum]] on the table carried by two monkeys. As he overhears her talking with the Knave, the Rabbit takes the Oraculum from the table as the monkeys never notice this, alongside the Red Queen and the Knave. Later after the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]] escapes from execution with help from [[Chessur]], the monkey servants are seen celebrating their freedom in a plan to fight against the Red Queen.
