'''Jessica "Jessie" Santiago Prescott''' is a 24-year-old girl from [[Texas]], and the protagonist of [[Disney Channel|Disney Channel's]] [[Jessie (TV series)|live-action television program of the same name]]. Rebelling against her [[Col. Prescott|father]], a strict Marine Sergeant, Jessie moved to [[New York City]] to realize her dreams, becoming nanny to the four Ross kids.

==Biography==
Jessie was born and raised in Fort Hood, a rural town in Texas. Her father is in the Marine Corps, and she often describes him as being strict but soft. At age eighteen, Jessie got the sudden desire to follow her dreams and moved to New York City as she believed that the place was where dreams came true. She'd told her father that she "had a great job", but actually had no idea where she was going to work. While in a taxi, Jessie realized that her wallet was missing and she had no money. This lead to her being thrown out of the cab, right outside an apartment building. Incidentally, she became the nanny of a high profile couple's four children, Emma, Luke, Ravi and Zuri Ross.

==Background==
===Personality===
Jessie is a warm-hearted, friendly and kind person. She is always willing to help others, especially the Ross Kids, and tries her best to achieve goals. Even though she can get extremely jealous and annoyed at times, Jessie does her best to make things right at the end. She describes her romantic life to be very embarrassing and sad and states that she has never been on a date where something hasn't gone wrong. She has a fear of Port-a-Potties, but she gets over it in "[[A Doll's Outhouse]]". Also, in the Star Wars' episode, it is revealed she dislikes rats. Jessie is an idealistic, optimistic, well-rounded starry-eyed teen who does her best to aim high. She was a straight A-student and Class of 2011 high school graduate in school. Not only that, but she has a squeaky clean record. She knows how to fly a helicopter and loves music. In the meantime, she moved to New York City to live her dream. She is currently working as a nanny for the Ross kids.

Despite being friendly, she can be aggressive and threatening when others push her to her limits. However, even then, she nearly always ends up doing the right thing afterwards.

===Physical appearance===
Jessie has fair skin, long light auburn hair with bangs, hazel eyes, and voluptuous, yet firm, strong and powerful build. She has a round, plump face and full lips.

==Reception==
Jessie was named the 5th best role model according to Common Sense Media, saying: "As a nanny, Jessie always has the kids' best interests at heart. She's responsible and caring, and she even encourages the mom and dad on the show to be better parents. She's also not afraid to speak her mind when she disagrees with someone. Even though Jessie's life isn't the most realistic (this is a Disney comedy, after all), young kids won't mind a bit. Instead, they'll see a thoroughly likable character who stays optimistic as she navigates a new city and a new job, showing kids the value of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of a challenge."<ref>http://www.commonsensemedia.org/new/10-best-tv-role-models</ref>
