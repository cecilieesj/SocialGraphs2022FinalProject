'''Johnny''' is [[Vanessa Doofenshmirtz]]'s boyfriend during much of the first three seasons of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''. [[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] calls him a nice fellow. He told Vanessa that her dad "did a good job with this party" ("[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]"). He also told Vanessa that her dad was "cool" ("[[Brain Drain]]"). Vanessa later breaks up with Johnny on the phone because she felt that he thought a video game was more important then her ("[[Minor Monogram]]"). He is still dejected and irritated about the break-up by the start of the school year. On the first day of school, Johnny was accidentally but temporarily transformed into a part-ape, part-reptilian creature as the result on an experiment by Vanessa's father (who had just become a science teacher at their school and now considered the teen to be "whiny") and went on a rampage, taking Vanessa hostage before she managed to inject him with an antidote. Despite her audible warnings to the contrary, he took this as a sign that she was still romantically interested in him ("[[Doof 101]]").
