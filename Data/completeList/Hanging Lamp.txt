The '''Hanging Lamp''' is a supporting character who appears in ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' at [[Elmo St. Peters]]'s Parts Shop. He appears during the "[[It's a 'B' Movie]]" song.

==Role in the film==
The Hanging Lamp seems creepy but good-hearted and affable, because he gave [[Lampy]] his own bulb, and tells him to use it in good health (while he still can). When he asked him about escaping, he tells the [[Junkshop Appliances]] about it, and they started laughing, together. However, the Hanging Lamp, although creepy and eccentric, is not a villain.

==Trivia==
*His voice is similar to that of Peter Lorre.
