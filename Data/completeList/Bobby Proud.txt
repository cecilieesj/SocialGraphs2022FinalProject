'''Robert "Bobby" Proud''' is [[Oscar Proud|Oscar]]'s older brother and [[Suga Mama|Suga Mama's]] eldest son who carries a microphone everywhere he goes.

==History==
Sadly, as Oscar points out, Bobby was and is favored over him by their mother; however, he is less intelligent and is a complete failure. Despite being a musician, Bobby still lives with Suga Mama. He, Suga Mama and his father did many things together, excluding Oscar and making him resentful when he recalls the memories.

Bobby didn't get kidnapped by Al Roker like the other adults since he's a kid at heart and mentions that his mother has been gone for a week.

He also cannot swim. This is strange cause in the episode "Strike", it's revealed that Suga Mama and Percy paid for years of swimming lessons. 

Bobby is also a singing celebrity as he sings songs like "Dis-funktional" and he did them on a music video. He's usually singing everything he says, except when he was to stop to ask questions out of confusion or because there's no one around besides those who don't like his singing. Bobby also owns a car that can transform into a mailbox, which he implies helps him avoid cops who try charging him with parking tickets. Oscar is not above abusing him; he once sent Bobby as an invitation to [[BeBe & CeCe Proud|Bebe and Cece]]'s baptism to their overweight cousins, [[Ray Ray Proud, Sr.|Ray Ray]] and [[Boonnetta Proud|Boonnetta]] (who ate Oscar and Trudy's wedding cake before they even got a chance to cut it). He also seems to have a romantic crush on Trudy's actress sister, [[Diana Parker]].

In the original series, Bobby wore a very outdated disco outfit from the 1970s. In ''Louder and Prouder'', Bobby's wardrobe is updated... by about two decades. He now wears a bandana, a black tank top, and MC Hammer pants, from the 1990s, and no longer has an afro. He also has a more prominent role in the revival, having been added to the theme song, as well as the family photo at the end of the intro.

==Relationships==
* [[Oscar Proud]] - Bobby's younger brother. Even though Oscar has always been in his brother's shadow, Bobby never rubs it in. While there have been moments where they annoy each other, they seem to have a good brotherly relationship. He is happy to help Oscar out with his business (especially if music is involved).
* [[Suga Mama]] - Bobby's mother. Suga Mama spoiled him when he was a kid and gave him all of the love and attention while Oscar was often ignored. Because of this, the two of them do have a loving mother/son relationship, something that Oscar wishes he had.
* [[Trudy Proud]] - Bobby's sister-in-law. There have been times where Bobby does something that will annoy Trudy but they do treat each other like family. They do often introduce the other as their "brother/sister-in-law" without hesitation showing they do accept each other as family. They seem to be even closer in ''Louder and Prouder'' as Bobby helps Trudy with her new company car by making some modifications as well as spray paints her logo.
*[[Penny Proud]] - Bobby's niece. The two of them seem to have a loving uncle/niece relationship.  Penny is always happy to see him (unless she is already in a bad mood). Bobby has also helped Penny with her music career and even became her manager. During this time, Penny had to leave her friends behind but she never stabbed Bobby in the back. Even when Penny gave an acceptance speech for a music award, she gave the biggest shout out to Bobby saying he was someone who was like a father to her. Bobby also helped Penny with her ride share app business "Get In". 
*[[BeBe & CeCe Proud]] - Bobby's nephew and niece. Bobby doesn't have many scenes with them but when he does, he is usually seen playing with them (or eating their food). 
*[[Felix Boulevardez]] - Felix and Bobby have a surprisingly solid friendship. They have been paired up together on numerous occasions and appear to get along and work together pretty well.
