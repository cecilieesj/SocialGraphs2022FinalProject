====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In [[2023]], a short period after the Blip, Abilash Tandon is in [[Westview]] when he becomes entrapped, as the town and everything within, is transformed, into a black and white, 1950s sitcom. He is assigned the new identity of Norm. Under this new persona, Abilash is aware of everything that happens, but but has no control, and feels Wanda's pain. When he goes to sleep, he suffers from Wanda's nightmares. As Norm, he works at Computational Services, Inc., under his employer, [[Todd Davis|Mr. Hart]]. He is also part of a neighborhood watch, along with other men from the area, and the group regularly meet at the public library, although the watch, serves as more of a social setting, for gossip. 

While at work, Norm requests that [[Vision]] provide him with computational forms, and plays the song "Yakety Yak" in the background. He finds that Vision has already managed to complete his work, and is amazed at the speed in which he works. Norm asks Vision if the music bothers him, but Vision wonders whether he is talking about the music, as a form of distraction, or the nonsensical lyrics. When Norm answers with the former, Vision tells him it isn't. Norm senses something wrong with Vision, based on his demeanor, and asks if he can he help with something, and Vision asks what their jobs entail of. Norm tells Vision that since he arrived, the company's productivity has increased by 300%. He comments on his exceptional skills, on production of computational forms, and compares him to a walking computer, which offends Vision. Norms asks whats's wrong, and Vision discloses that he has a special plan, involving his wife today, but he doesn't remember. When Mr. Hart appears to be done with his interview, and begins leaving his office, Norm and Vision quickly rush to their desk.

By the [[Don't Touch That Dial|second episode]], the time has shifted into the 1960s. Norm attends a neighborhood watch meeting, and the group are discussing a fellow neighbor's lawn, when Vision arrives. Norm greet him, and comments on his unexpected appearance, before telling him , that the watch is exclusive to members. Vision is oblivious at Norm's hints to leave, and sits alongside everyone else. When [[John Collins|Herb]] mentions they need to get to "new business", Vision begins inquiring about various security protocools, but Norm explains to him, that "new business", is a code term for Danish pastries. Vision refuses, on the basis that he doesn't eat between meals, and the group continue to gossip. Norm discloses that Arthur brought his own bowling trophies. In an effort to join in, Vision accuses Norm of being a communist and when the group laugh this off, Norms mentions how he always thought Vision was had more of a strait-laced attitude, prior to joining them. When Herb offers Vision a piece of gum, Norm points out that Vision doesn't eat food, and they discuss whether gum is considered food. Vision takes it, and Norm remarks that Vision is funny. Later that day, Norm is sitting alongside Herb, at the Westview Talent Show. The pair watch Vision and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]]'s magical comedic performance, and when Vision begin levitating, Norm points out the rope attached to Vision's back. He continues to watch, and when their act is completed, and the two are prized with best comedic performance, Norm can be seen clapping for them, alongside the other audience members.

The fifth episode pays homage to the 1980s and 90s. At work, Norm marvels over the many functions of his new office computer. He admires watching Vision work on them, comparing it to him speaking their language. Vision heads to Norm's desk to turn on the internet, and Norm receives an email. He opens his drawer to take out his letter opener, but Vision tells him, its unneeded. He opens the email, and the contents, detail of an organisation called [[S.W.O.R.D.]], as well as Westview's residents. Norm begins reading out loud, and other members read out, with him in sync. After he's finishes, they all begin laughing, and Norm asks Vision what he's going to write back, due to his reputation as the office's funny guy. Vision uses his powers to turn off the computer, then proceeds to use them on Norm's mind. Abilash's true personality is unearthed, and he begs Vision for help. He asks what day it is, how long it's been, and begins frantically searching for his phone, so he can call his sister, who's taking care of their ill father. He warns Vision to stop "her", because she's in his head, and none of thoughts are his own. He cries in pain, and pleads Vision to make her stop, and Vision uses his powers, so he regresses back to his former personality. Norm remains unaware of what just transpired, and appears calm and collected. He jokingly asks Vision if he were to send an email, where would he put the stamp.

Norm is later out in town, with Herb. Suddenly the true personas of the towns residents are restored. Norm reverts backs to his true identity, of Abilash Tandon, and approaches Wanda, alongside several other people. They all beg to be freed, and he reveals to Wanda that when they sleep, they suffer from her nightmares. Wanda tries to assure the group that she is protecting them, but they all simultaneously beg her, to free them. She screams at them to stop, releasing a burst of red [[magic]], and placing them all in a choke. Abilash falls to the ground, unable to breathe, alongside everyone else, and Wanda quickly undoes this. Wanda promises that she will let them go, and begins lowering the Hex, surrounding Westview. Abilash and everyone run to escape, but it is quickly brought back, before he has the chance to leave. A battle ensues in the sky, between Wanda, and [[Agatha Harkness]], and once it's over, the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Before Wanda leaves, she makes her way in town to speak to [[Monica Rambeau]], and Abilash can be seen, amongst the various other townspeople, angrily staring at her, for the suffering she caused.

==Trivia==
*According to Abilash's [[S.W.O.R.D.]] profile, he is 38 years old, and was born on [[July 14]]th.
