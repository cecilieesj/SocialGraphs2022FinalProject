'''Kitten Kaboodle''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode "[[A Star is Torn]]".

==Personality==
Kitten is a highly seductive, yet manipulative, blonde Starrywood starlet with a husky Lauren Bacall-like voice. She has a habit of calling everyone "darling".

She also has a very dismissive attitude towards [[Rebecca Cunningham|Rebecca]], for some reason, even before Rebecca finds out Kitten's the culprit.

==Role in the series==
Kitten first appears as the main antagonist of the episode "[[A Star is Torn]]". [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] saves her life and she invites him to co-star with her in her latest movie. But when they arrive, it turns out that the accident wasn't a coincidenceâ€”it's one in a series of accidents that had been occurring on the Kitten Kaboodle movie set. Rebecca Cunningham tries to explain this to Baloo, but he's too star-struck by Kitten to listen.

As a result, Rebecca sets out to solve the case on her own and discovers Kitten as the culpit. Her last two movies did poorly and her movie career is almost ruined, so she caused the "accidents" as a way to raise her stardom. Rebecca manages to expose her during an unsuccessful "accident" that she set up for Baloo, by having Kitten blurt out her involvement while in a tantrum. Kitten is then arrested.

Kitten also makes a brief appearance in "[[Louie's Last Stand]]"; it's possible she made parole for good behavior or had made bail.

==Trivia==
*Her name is a pun on the phrase "The whole kit and caboodle".
