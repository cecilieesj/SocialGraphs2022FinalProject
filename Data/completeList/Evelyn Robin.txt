In Chapter Five, an older [[Christopher Robin]] encounters Evelyn who meets Christopher on a London bus just as Christopher offers her to take a seat, only for a passenger to take her seat. Over their lifetime, Christopher Robin and Evelyn start a relationship and later when Christopher leaves, she is shown being pregnant. After Christopher leaves, Evelyn prepares a birthday cake for her daughter [[Madeline Robin|Madeline]]. After Christopher returns from war, Evelyn is so happy she could see him again, alongside Madeline. Christopher Robin then starts his new life working for the Winslow Enterprises bank while his wife Evelyn continues to take care of her daughter.

After Christopher comes back from work, Evelyn explains that Katherine Dane, who works at Winslow's bank, explains that Christopher will work this weekend just as Christopher explains to his daughter Madeline that he has to work under Winslow's strict rules, giving him a low chance to see his family. During a conversation with Evelyn, she explains to her husband that there are perfect schools for Madeline that do not require them to send her away and also while talking, she explains about Christopher has to adapt to having a new life in the real world rather than having fun with Winnie the Pooh and his friends at the Hundred Acre Wood. The next day, Christopher bids a farewell to his wife and daughter so that she can take her to boarding school.

After reuniting back with [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]], [[Tigger]], [[Eeyore]], [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]], [[Rabbit]], and [[Kanga]] and [[Roo]] back at the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], Christopher returns to the real world back home to meet his family, telling his wife Evelyn and his daughter Madeline that he must return to work at Winslow Enterprises, just as Christopher tells his wife that he must catch up with the next train just as Christopher leaves. Evelyn then tells her daughter Madeline, sharing her sorrow with her daughter that her husband cannot stay, because Christopher has to work at Winslow Enterprises while Madeline has boarding school. To cheer herself up, Madeline decides to have fun.

Later during a plan to find Christopher Robin, Madeline, Pooh, and his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood pass by her family's house just as her mother asks her if she would like some lemonade, only to find out that Madeline has left a note linked to Christopher Robin. Furthermore, Evelyn comes to the rescue and tries to catch up with Madeline while arriving at London who is trying to find her father.

Katherine Dane later arrives at the bank, warning Christopher that his wife Evelyn couldn't find her daughter and thanks to Katherine's advice, Christopher reunites with his wife just as the couple rides on a car to find Madeline so she can reunite with her family again much to Winslow's worry. Later, Tigger, Piglet, and Eeyore join Christopher's party while Madeline and Pooh plan to reunite back to Christopher. As Madeline is finally reunited with her family, Christopher and his family to Winslow Enterprises just as Christopher tells Giles Winslow and his father that his answer is nothing, telling the Winslows about the importance of going on holidays when not working as well as everyone being able to afford with cheaper prices to which Old Man Winslow allows Christopher's family to go on holidays just as Christopher's family, Pooh, and his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood leave. Finally, Christopher and his family spend the holidays in the Hundred Acre Wood with Pooh and his friends.
