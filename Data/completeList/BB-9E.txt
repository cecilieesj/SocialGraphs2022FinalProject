'''BB-9E''' is an astromech droid that appears as a minor antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''. It is a BB-series droid like [[BB-8]], designed to move like a rotating ball, whose allegiance is with the [[First Order]].

==Background==
===Biography===
BB-9E is one of the BB astromech units that belongs to the [[First Order]] and was assigned to Snoke's flagship, the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]''. There, it is responsible for keeping the machinery operational, making sure that the procedures are being followed and also checking for the presence of infiltrators or any potential threat inside the ship.

===Personality===
Although the BB-series astromech droid is usually a friendly model, BB-9E is cold and malevolent. This personality is result of being treated simply as a machine by the First Order, very different from the treatment that [[BB-8]] and other droids receive in the [[Resistance]]. In order to keep BB-9E submissive, the First Order would often erase its memory, but this ultimately did not prevent the droid from becoming malicious and it is especially mean while working to report threats inside the ''Supremacy''.

===Physical appearance===
As they are from the same series of astromech droid, BB-9E and BB-8 look very similar, except for their colors. Instead of being white and orange, BB-9E is dark colored. It is a black and rounded droid with a square-domed head, silver markings and vents. It has a red optic sensor that it is kept out to detect intruders.

==Appearances== 
===''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''===
In the film, BB-9E is responsible for revealing BB-8, [[Finn]] and [[Rose Tico]] while they are disguised as First Order officers to go undercover on the ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''[[Supremacy]]'', resulting in them being captured by [[Captain Phasma]] and her followers.

===''Star Wars Blips''===
BB-9E makes an appearance in the episode "Hey You", where BB-8 bumps into BB-9E trying to provoke it.

==Trivia==
*On set, BB-9E was nicknamed "BB-H8" (pronounced "BB-Hate").
