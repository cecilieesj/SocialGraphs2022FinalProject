'''Nala's father''' is a character who is mentioned in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is the mate of [[Sarafina]], the father of [[Nala]] and thus [[Kiara]] and [[Kion]]'s maternal grandfather.

==Background==
Nala's father was born sometime during the reign of Simba's grandparents and around the same age as the future King, Mufasa.

As a cub, Nala's father fell from a tree, but was saved by the [[Lion Guard]] of his day. (Possibly before Scar's lion guard)

Some years after this incident, he mated with a lioness named [[Sarafina]] and had a daughter with her named [[Nala]]. At some point, shortly before or after Nala's birth, her father either died or left [[Pride Rock]], thus leaving Sarafina as Nala's only parent.

Despite his disappearance, he would become the father-in-law of Prince [[Simba]] (whom Mufasa and [[Sarabi]] betrothed to Nala) and would become the grandfather of Nala's cubs, [[Kion]] and [[Kiara]].

==''[[The Lion Guard]]''==
In the episode "[[Paintings and Predictions]]", whilst in the [[Lair of the Lion Guard]], [[Bunga]] and [[Beshte]] see the painting of Nala's Father falling from a tree and mistake it for Kion and believe that he will fall from a tree and so throughout the episode, they try to stop Kion from climbing trees, despite Kion's claims that paintings cannot predict the future.

At the end of the episode, Rafiki shows the Lion Guard the entire painting and tells Bunga that the painting was showing the past and that the cub is not Kion but his grandfather, who was rescued by the Lion Guard of his day.

==Trivia==
*According to [[Tom Bancroft]], one of the lead animators for ''The Lion King'', the issue of Nala's father was brought up very late, and eventually ignored as they figured no one would notice him not being there. Some writers have assumed that Mufasa or Scar fathered Nala.
*He strongly resembles his grandson, Kion.
*In the original draft of ''The Lion King'', when it was called ''King of the Jungle'', Nala's father was heavily implied to be Mufasa, but was cut to avoid incest between her, and Simba as paternal half siblings.
