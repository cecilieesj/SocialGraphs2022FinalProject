'''Sherlock Holmes''' is a detective character created by Scottish author and physician, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is a minor character in ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
A brilliant London-based "consulting detective", Holmes is famous for his astute logical reasoning, his ability to take on almost any disguise, and his use of forensic science skills to solve difficult cases.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''===
Sherlock is briefly mentioned in this film by the narrator (famous Sherlock actor Basil Rathbone) as being amongst the greatest characters in British literature.

===''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''===
In the film, Holmes appears as the "neighbor" to [[Basil of Baker Street]]. He is the world's greatest ''human'' detective (Basil being the world's greatest ''mouse'' detective). While Basil, [[David Q. Dawson|Dawson]], and [[Olivia Flaversham]] look for Toby, they observe Holmes with Watson (depicted as silhouettes against the wall). The two depart the scene to continue their own investigations, allowing Basil and the company to "borrow" Toby in the meantime.

==Disney Parks==
===[[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]===
Sherlock makes a cameo in the [[Disneyland]] version of this attraction, his distinctive silhouette being seen from a second-floor window in the town. The reasoning behind this is likely in reference to [[the Wind in the Willows]]' narrator Basil Rathbone who famously portrayed the detective.
