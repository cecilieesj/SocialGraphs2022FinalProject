==Biography==
===Early Life===
Stephanie Marie Denisco was born sometime between 2004 to 2005 in Oahu, Hawaii. At some point Steph met Lahela as a toddler and they have been best friends ever since.

===Season One===
====Fallout with Lahela====
The relationship between Steph and her best friend, Lahela, begins to break down when Lahela becomes interested in the Dance Team at school. Steph remarks that it is her thing, and that Lahela isn't really interested in the idea but rather wants to be perfect at everything. This causes a breakdown of their friendship when it becomes clear that Lahela was putting the Dance Team over her friendship with Steph.

Eventually, the two fix their friendship when Lahela fakes an injury as the dancers are about to perform. She nominates Steph to take her place who pretends that she doesn't know the routine but later admits that she knows it better than Lahela.

====Feelings for Kai====
Steph isn't afraid to admit how she feels and tells Lahela early that she has feelings for Kai, citing that he is the most good looking boy in the school. She admits, however, that she has trouble communicating these feelings with him, but often flirts with him at the dinner table and takes every opportunity to hang out with him when she can; this includes at the high school dance.

When Walter's cake is ruined and the two are responsible, Steph begins to panic and Kai is forced to kiss her to calm her down. Steph is excited at the premise that her crush could also have feelings for her but pushes these to the side. Kai later tries to talk to her about his feelings but is too scared and walks away.
