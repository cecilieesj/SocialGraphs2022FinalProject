'''Ajed Al-Gebraic''' is [[Genie]]'s old master, who is very greedy. He used up all his three wishes and sold Genie to a Sorcerer for eternal life, but not eternal youth. He appears in the episode "[[Genie Hunt]]".

==Role in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|series]]==
Ajed lives in a little cottage on a cliff, which is high in the mountains. When [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] knocks on the door, he answers and is surprised to see Genie. Genie is angry at Ajed for trading him to a sorcerer in return for eternal life. Ajed tells him that it was a mistake. He then welcomes Aladdin, [[Abu]], [[Iago]], and [[Carpet]] in his house. After he and Genie chat happily, Ajed welcomes Genie's enemy, the [[The Mukhtar|Mukhtar]]. He is on the eternal life deal again, and he makes the Mukhtar capture Genie so he can be his servant again forever. Later, when Aladdin and the others get trapped with the Mukhtar, Ajed shows up and is about to take Genie, but Aladdin says that he will surrender his life for his friend. This makes Ajed cancel the contract of keeping Genie, and he lets the gang go, not before paying the Mukhtar, plus in advance when stating that after Aladdin dies, Ajed will have Genie to himself again; not knowing that the Mukhtar will be long retired by then.
