==Role in the film==
The Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge affairs as they are in the present day and the joy of Christmas in general while "[[Hark the Herald Angels Sing]]" is playing in the background.

The first thing the ghost shows Scrooge is [[Bob Cratchit]] eating Christmas dinner with his impoverished family with what little money Scrooge pays him for a roast goose.

Next, the ghost shows [[Fred (A Christmas Carol)|Fred]] and his friends playing party games after their Christmas dinner, which Scrooge earlier refused an invitation to.

Then, Scrooge and the ghost appear inside a clock tower. Scrooge points out that the spirit is now older. The ghost explains his time on earth is very brief and that it ends at midnight.

Finally, the ghost warns Scrooge about [[Ignorance and Want]]. Specifically, in what peril poor people would be if Scrooge did not change his ways. After his meeting with Scrooge is over, the Ghost of Christmas Present erodes into a skeleton, which soon turns into dust as it blows away. The nearby clock tower strikes 12 and Scrooge meets [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come|the next ghost]].

==Appearances in Disney media==
===[[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]]===
A version of the Ghost of Christmas Present appears in the 2017 reboot of ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' in the episode "[[Last Christmas!]]" voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]. This version is depicted as an anthropomorphic pig and is no bigger than [[Scrooge McDuck]] himself (as opposed to most portrayals that have him as a towering man).

He, along with the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Future visit [[Scrooge McDuck]] every year just to hang out after accidentally visiting him instead of Ebenezer Scrooge. The group take Scrooge to his first Christmas party held at McDuck Manor where Present attempts to hit on [[Bentina Beakley]], then still going by the name Agent 22, but fails as she ends up dancing with Future. When the [[Beagle Boys]] break in and begin stealing Scrooge's things, Present ends up leaving with them as he thinks they are more fun.

He later attends Scrooge McDuck's Christmas party back in the present.
