'''Officer Gore''' is a character in the [[2020]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Onward]]''. She is a satyr cop.

==Role in the film==
Gore is first seen with [[Specter]] when they find Ian speeding while driving in [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]]'s van [[Guinevere (car)|Guinevere]] with [[Ian Lightfoot|Ian]] and half of their father [[Wilden Lightfoot|Wilden]] while on their way to Raven's Point to find theÂ Phoenix Gem. To avoid getting caught, Ian and Barley use a lie spell to disguise themselves as [[Laurel Lightfoot|their mother]]'s boyfriend [[Colt Bronco]] in order to avoid getting arrested. While talking to "Colt," Gore refers to Barley as a "screw-up," much to Barley's chagrin, but Ian lies that he disagrees, causing the spell to begin to wear off. However, the brothers manage to get away before the spell could wear off completely.

She, Specter, and Colt later appear during the climax of the film where they chase Ian and Barley again. To avoid getting caught, Barley sacrifices Guinevere by putting a rock on the gas pedal and crashing it into a mountain, blocking the cops' path.

Her further fate is unknown after Ian brought back the rest of Wilden, and broke the curse with the help of Laurel and Corey the Manticore.

==Trivia==
*"Gore" is an English verb that refers to an ungulate (specifically a bull, a ram, or a goat) that uses its horns to attack its enemies.
*Gore's voice actress, Ali Wong, would later voice the [[Super Super Big Doctor]] from the 2020 Disney animated film ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe]]''. Coincidentally, both ''Onward'' and ''Candace Against the Universe'' were both released on the same year.
