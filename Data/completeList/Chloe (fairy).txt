'''Chloe''' is a garden-talent fairy in the [[Disney Fairies]] television special, ''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''.

==Background==
At the time of the Pixie Hollow Games, Chloe was a new garden-talent fairy in Pixie Hollow. Unlike the other garden fairies, who were only best at looking pretty and always lose, Chloe was the only one who wanted to participate. She volunteered to partner with Rosetta in the Pixie Hollow Games despite the constant losing streak the garden fairies have. She is rather cheerful and optimistic, especially when it comes to competing in the games.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===
In the special ''Pixie Hollow Games'', she worked very hard and researched every event for the Pixie Hollow Games. Rosetta and her worked together to break the Garden-talent's legendary losing streak. At first, Rosetta didn't try hard, but after she let Chloe down on the second day, she stepped it up. They almost lost when Rumble cheated but won when Glimmer didn't cross the finish line.
