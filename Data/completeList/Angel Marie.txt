}}'''Angel Marie''' first appeared as a pirate in ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''.

He is a member of Captain Flint's old crew and appears to be generally dumb. In the musical number "[[Cabin Fever]]," he dresses up like a [[Hawaii]]an dancer.

His graceful name belies his grotesque appearance. Like the person called before him, Big-Fat-Ugly-Bug-Face-Baby-Eating O'Brien, Angel's name does not match that of his appearance; in fact, it appears that the two character's names have been switched.

He later played one of [[The Flying Monkeys]] in ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'' (performed by [[John Kennedy]]), appeared in a [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Haunted_Holidays Haunted Holidays] sketch and appeared in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Virmup Virmup] video "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody Bohemian Rhapsody]" (in a shot with Mo Frackle, [[Old Tom]] and a Purple [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Frackles Frackle]) performed by [[Bill Barretta]].<ref>[http://themuppetmindset.blogspot.com/2010/02/interview-with-muppeteer-bill-barretta.html The Muppet Mindset: Interview with Muppeteer Bill Barretta - Part 2]</ref>

The puppet also appeared in a background cameo in ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' in the songs [[The Big House]] (serving Kermit some fish) and [[Together Again (Muppets song)|Together Again]] (serving the leftovers to the Russian prisoners)
