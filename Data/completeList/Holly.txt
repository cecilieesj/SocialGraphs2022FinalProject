'''Holly''' is one of the supporting characters of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', and a member of the [[Fireside Girls]] (Troop 46231) in [[Danville]].

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Holly is a short, slender, dark-skinned girl with jet-black hair in two puffy pigtails tied with yellow hairbands and brown eyes. Her Fireside Girl uniform has a red collar with a dent in the middle and two small splits at the sides of her sleeves, with sneakers with a strap going all the way across. In some appearances, Holly has two small buck teeth. However, in other appearances, the teeth are not visible. In winter, she switches to an orange sweater with an off-white collar and red zigzags, and red boots.

==Trivia==
*Her first speaking role was the episode "[[Raging Bully]]", as she tells Candace that there are no souvenirs for the brawl left.
*In "[[It's About Time!|It’s About Time!]]", Holly is seen without her beret in one scene when the girls are looking at a message [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] left from 300 million B.C.
*She was the only Fireside Girl (other than Isabella) who appeared in "[[Comet Kermillian]]" and in a flashback in "[[My Fair Goalie]]."
*Her name was mentioned on-screen for the first time (along with the other Fireside Girls’ names) by the supercomputer Phineas and Ferb built in "[[Ask a Foolish Question]]."
