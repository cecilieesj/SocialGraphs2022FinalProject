'''Dr. Addison Bennet''' is a minor antagonist from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2016]] live-action film, ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''. He is a psychiatric doctor whom [[Alice Kingsleigh]] encounters at the asylum to which Alice ended up at, where she becomes his patient.

==Background ==
Despite his duty as a doctor, Bennet is shown to have a cruel personality to Alice, despite claiming herself to him that she has no problems. As Alice believed that he could give her side effects, Alice ends up becoming sensitive to his cruel treatment and countered him using his own syringe against him, much to Helen's shock of what Alice did to him.

==Role in the film==
Dr. Bennet is first heard telling his fellow workers to strap down [[Alice Kingsleigh]] in her seat while trying to escape [[Time]], much to her plans to rescue [[Tarrant Hightopp]].

After Alice finds herself in the asylum and her mother [[Helen Kingsleigh|Helen]] explains that she has been behaving so strangely, Bennet enters the room Alice is at where he approaches Alice who is planning to return to [[Underland]] to save Tarrant Hightopp just as Bennet reads over his textbook to find a way to cure Alice's problems. Addison then gets his syringe out and prepares to finish Alice's treatment. Helen asks him to know if it is really necessary, to which he explains that it is as he becomes distracted upon seeing Mr. Harris taking Helen out of the asylum. Bennet then continues his task with Alice only to find out that his syringe is gone to which it is then known that Alice used his own syringe against him, leaving the doctor paralyzed just as Helen reacts to what Alice did to the doctor in shock, much to Harris' worry as Alice escapes from a group of asylum workers in a plan to return to Underland before Tarrant dies. It is unknown of what happened to him after that.

==Trivia ==

*Dr. Bennet does not appear in Lewis Carroll's original books and is created exclusively for the film.
* His actor Andrew Scott would later voice [[Obake]], the main antagonist of ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]'', which was released one year after ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' was released.
