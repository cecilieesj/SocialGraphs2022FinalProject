'''Ursa Wren''' is a character from [[Disney XD]] series, ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. She is the mother of [[Sabine Wren]].



==Background==
Ursa Wren was formerly a member of the Death Watch, a group of terrorist Mandalorians led by Pre Vizsla until the day where [[Maul]] killed Vizsla and became the new leader.

More than a year later during the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]]'s era, Ursa and her family joined the empire with the exception of her daughter, [[Sabine Wren|Sabine]].

==Role in the Series==
When Sabine returned to Krownest for recruit the Mandalorians, Ursa almost had Sabine place into a cell before she stopped upon seeing the [[Darksaber]]. Catching sight of the saber, Ursa agreed to talk with Sabine and her Jedi friends but asked that she turned in their [[Lightsaber]]s. She later took Sabine aside for a private conversation, and after learning that she had not won the Darksaber from [[Maul]] expressed her belief that no one would follow Sabine's lead.

Ursa later responded to a transmission from Gar Saxon, and offered him the two Jedi in exchange for Sabine's safety. Ursa delivered the Darksaber to Saxon who subsequently condemned to death all of the Clan Wren. Saxon attempted to kill Ursa by hindrance, but Sabine intervened. After Sabine was defeated Saxon and refused to finish it, Saxon tried to kill Sabine by hindrance, but Ursa intervened quickly and killed Saxon. With the death of Saxon, Ursa realized that it was high time for Mandalore to fight against the Empire.

However, Clan Saxon, backed by the Empire, engages Clan Wren in a civil war, leaving Ursa's troops strained to protect whatever territory they had control of, leaving her unable to spare many troops to aid Ezra when he comes seeking help as Thrawn had located Atollon and had the Rebels there at his mercy. However, because Ezra had helped her and Sabine, Ursa owes him some sort of repayment, and allows as many loyal troops and fighters who would volunteer to aid Ezra and Sabine with saving the surviving Rebels and get them off of Atollon.

In return for helping the Rebels escape Thrawn on Atollon, Hera allows Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper to aid Ursa and Sabine with their war with the Empire as they help rescue Ursa's husband and Sabine's father, Alrich, from an Imperial prisoner convoy. During this, Ursa and her son, Tristan, had been distracting the main Imperial forces of new Imperial Governor Tiber Saxon, brother of the late Gar Saxon, only to soon notice the Imperial forces they had engaged break off and retreat as a lone scout walker was brought in. However, Sabine, recognizing an ominous noise from the walker's weapon system, shouts for Ursa and Tristan to get out of there before it was too late. The weapon, of Sabine's design, was The Duchess, designed to turn the Mandalorian armor against its wearer by superheating it to the point that the Mandalorian inside would be reduced to a pile of charred ashes. Thanks to Sabine's warning, Ursa and Tristan escaped the fate of their fellow Mandalorian warriors, albeit still suffering some injuries from being caught on the edge of the blast zone, and survived to return to base with the others.

When Clan Kryze leader and sister of the late Duchess Satine Kryze, Bo-Katan Kryze, calls out Sabine on The Duchess and the threat it now posed to the Mandalorians, Ursa and Tristan come to their daughter/sister's aid, threatening any Mandalorian who turned a blaster on Sabine with retaliation from them. However, Sabine accepts responsibility for developing The Duchess, and convinces everyone that the device must be destroyed for the good of all of Mandalore. Ursa, due to her injuries, remains behind to coordinate the attack on Tiber's Star Destroyer, where The Duchess is kept, and Sabine sees to its destruction, once and for all, taking out the Star Destroyer with it. As a result, many clans offer to support Bo-Katan as the new leader of Mandalore, following in her sister's footsteps, with Ursa pledging the support of Clan Wren to the cause as well.

==Trivia==
*"Ursa" is Latin for bear.
*According to the Rebels Recon fon "[[Legacy of Mandalore]]", Ursa was present in the ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' episode "Shades of Reason" on the day where Maul killed Pre Vizsla among the members of the Death Watch.
*Ursa's armor shares its design-though not coloration-with that of Rook Kast, a subordinate of Gar Saxon's in the ''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir'' comics, and some fans believe that Ursa might indeed be Kast until her name was revealed.
