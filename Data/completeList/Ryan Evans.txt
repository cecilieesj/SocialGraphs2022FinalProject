'''Ryan Evans''' is a character in the [[Disney Channel Original Movie]]s, ''[[High School Musical]]'', ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' and ''[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]''. He is the fraternal twin brother, and acting partner of [[Sharpay Evans]].

==History==
Ryan Evans along with his sister Sharpay, have starred in 17 school musicals. Ryan is the nicer of the two, though he is not that bright, he could read stuff on the computer, and the call back sheets, but could not read a sign that the Basketball team made out of letters on their shirts which read "Go Drama Club!". Ryan is a member of the East High Drama Club, and seems to have a collection of hats as in every scene he is in he has a different hat on (numbering up to nine hats throughout the movie). He has a secret talent in baseball, as showcased in the home runs he hit during the Wildcats' friendly game. He was willing to go along with his sister's schemes to get [[Troy Bolton|Troy]] and [[Gabriella Montez|Gabriella]] to miss the call backs, and even said he was proud to call Sharpay his sister when he heard them. Ryan is almost always seen with his sister Sharpay.

==Trivia==
*[[Kenny Ortega]] revealed Ryan was supposed to be an ''openly'' gay character, but believed that it may have been too controversial for Disney, at the time. He has confirmed that Ryan is indeed gay, and came out, in college.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/director-kenny-ortega-pride-high-school-musical-1234694033/|title=Director Kenny Ortega on the Queer Aesthetic of His Movies From ‘Hocus Pocus’ to ‘High School Musical’|website=Variety|date=[[June 30]], [[2020]]}}</ref>
