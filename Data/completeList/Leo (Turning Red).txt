'''Leo Lee''' is is a deleted character from the [[2022]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Turning Red]].'' He was supposed to act as a male cousin to Mei Lee that could also transform into a red panda after being secondly chosen by the gods (possibly Sun Yee), and he revealed he turned into a red panda while in class, and he ran away because of it, but he found a wristband near a trashcan, so he picked it up and placed it around his wrist, leading to it turning him back into a normal human again.

As to why Leo didn't make it into the final film, [[Domee Shi]] said, "It was less about this female curse that was passed down from mother to daughter and more about how these two kids were just randomly chosen by the Gods in this particular family to turn into magical red panda creatures and save their broken family."
