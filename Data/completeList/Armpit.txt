== Background ==
=== Personality ===
Armpit is rude and has a penchant for mean jokes which are told at the expense of others. Perhaps his most notable trait is that he has an absolute disregard for hygiene. He sings that he hates taking showers or even brushing his teeth. He seems unconcerned about how he smells, though the other campers are understandably repulsed by his foul stench. This is shown when [[Mr. Sir]] denies Armpit a week of showering, and the others are horrified.
=== Physical appearance ===
Orange jumpsuit, fat, Armpit has black hair and brown eyes. He has dark skin. Armpit is obese and wears an orange jumpsuit.
== Role in the film ==
Shortly after meeting [[Stanley Yelnats IV]], Armpit throws him to the ground for calling him by his real name. Stanley had asked him where he could refill his water canteen. Still, their relationship improves, but slightly. After [[Warden Walker]] interferes at camp, Armpit taunts her by holding out his compass and pretending he dug it up. In response, [[Mr. Sir]] denies Armpit a week of shower tokens, and the others are horrified. He later bids Stanley goodbye, allowing him to call him by his real name.
