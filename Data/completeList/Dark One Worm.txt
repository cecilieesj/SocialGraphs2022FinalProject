The '''Dark One Worm''' is part of the Dark Ones, a race of trans-dimensional demons created by an unknown evil force in the beginning of time to end creation. It was born from the core of the Planet Shuggazoom.Â It is seen in the [[Jetix]] series ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]''.

While many of the Dark Ones are still trapped in their home dimension, the Netherworld, countless others, such as the Dark One Worm, are sealed within the core of countless planets, waiting to be awakened to begin their mission to destroy the universe.

[[The Skeleton King]], a devoted disciple to the Dark Ones, created the Pit of Doom as a conduit to connect the [[Citadel of Bone]], and corrupted the Power Primate to awaken the Dark One from its slumber, to destroy the universe. The Dark One Worm's antenna attached to the back of Skeleton King's decapitated head to become the "Skeleton King Worm".

The Dark One Worm could possibly have been inspired by the Space Slug from ''[[w:c:starwars:Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and the Worm that Gnaws in the Night.
