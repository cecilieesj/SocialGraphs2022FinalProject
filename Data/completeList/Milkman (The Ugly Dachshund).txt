==Role in the film==
The Milkman is first seen arriving and delivering some milk for the Garrisons. He notices them up pretty early even when he gets surprised by [[Mark Garrison|Mark]]'s car. Then, he offers to help Mark open the door for him while he tends to [[Fran Garrison|Fran]] as they are on their way to the hospital for a "special delivery" but Mark doesn't need any help. He tells Fran not to worry about a thing and to let him know when they want to hike their order on some milk. He is last seen watching the Garrisons drive off on their way to the hospital and isn't seen throughout the rest of the movie after this.
