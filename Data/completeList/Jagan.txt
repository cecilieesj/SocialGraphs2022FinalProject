'''Jagan''' is a male water dragon and the brother of Pengu, Amba, Pranee, and Sisu. He is a co-creator of the Dragon Gem. His magic is to create fog that is so thick it is impossible to see through. His part of the dragon gem was used by Sisu when Namaari came to Spine. He along with his siblings were the last dragons left to stop the Druun from turning Kumandra into stone.

As seen at the end of the film, all dragons possess an unique ability to fly using rain drops to hop through the sky.
