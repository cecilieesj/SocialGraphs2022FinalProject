'''Swifty La Rue''' was the guest's agent on the shortlived ride [[Superstar Limo]]. Though his way around the industry, he manages to turn anyone into a Superstar. 

==Background==
Being a Hollywood agent for years, Swifty knows how to make everything go his way. He can grab anyone off the street and make them famous. How it usually goes down is Swifty getting assigned a nobody and from the background, he can turn them into a somebody. While being carefree, he is a stickler for things going he may and doesn't like outside interruptions, (Such as his star arriving late.) getting in his way.
