==Trivia==
*Nia means "purpose" in Swahili.
*It was initially reported that Nia was going to be psychic.{{Citation needed}} It was later confirmed that [[Booker Baxter-Carter|Booker]] would be the twin to inherit his [[Raven Baxter|mother]]'s visions for some reason.
*Nia didn't believe that Booker was psychic at first but finally believed him when he had a vision with her in it along with it coming true, making her the third person to know about him being psychic.
*Nia is jealous of Booker's abilities.
