'''Peter''' is the protagonist/title character of ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', a segment of the 1946 [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] feature film, ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Peter is an adventurous boy who wants to go wolf hunting, but [[Peter's Grandfather|his grandfather]] forbids him to go. However, Peter manages to sneak outside with his popgun when he finds his grandfather asleep. He shows great fear when he first comes face-to-face with the [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] and mourns with the rest of the gang when the wolf supposedly eats [[Sonia]]. He later shows bravery by lowering down [[Ivan]] with a rope to save [[Sasha]] from getting eaten by the wolf.

==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
Peter first appears when he goes off to find the wolf with his popgun. When he is stopped, scolded, and spanked by his grandfather, who forbids him to go wolf hunting, his cap and popgun are taken from him. However, as soon as his grandfather falls asleep in his chair by the fireplace, he manages to get his things back and sneak outside. He later befriends Sasha, Sonia, and Ivan, who accompany him on his wolf hunt. He panics when he first encounters the wolf, and inadvertently shoots its nose with his popgun before fleeing from it. He mourns with the rest of the gang when the wolf supposedly eats Sonia, and later shows bravery when he lowers down Ivan with a rope, which he ties to the wolf's tail to save Sasha from getting eaten. When Sasha later brings back some [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir|hunters]], they notice that Peter and Ivan have already captured the wolf. Peter can be seen leading the victory parade at the end of the segment.

They are close childhood friends, and their friendship eventually blossoms into romance. Both have plans to one day leave the village and see the world together. At a certain point, in the canonical novel ''Red's Untold Tale'', he becomes the new owner of [[Copper]] after [[Amos Slade]]'s death. When a wolf attack on the village is coming, Peter is volunteered to hunt the beast. However, the wolf is Red who kills him. Years later, after gaining control of the wolf inside through the help of her villainous mother Anita, Red mentioned what happened to Peter to later love interests [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Dorothy Gale]], as well as [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] and [[Merida]].
