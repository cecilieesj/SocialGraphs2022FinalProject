'''Katie Dodd''' is a vixen archaeologist in ''[[TaleSpin]]''. She only appeared in the two-part episode "[[For Whom the Bell Klangs]]", and was never seen again.



==Role in the episode==
For five long years, Katie had been trying to find proof of the existence of [[Tinabula]], the Lost City of Bells. One day, she unearthed the [[The Three Bells of Tinabula|Three Bells of Tinabula]] -- the key to uncovering the city. Shortly after finding the bells, Katie was captured by [[Thaddeus E. Klang]] and his band of zealots. Klang was after the bells to uncover the ancient sound weapon within the city, and Katie had the knowledge of interpreting Tinabulan hieroglyphs.

It just so happened that Katie's path crossed with [[Baloo#TaleSpin|Baloo]] and [[King Louie#TaleSpin|Louie]] while the two were vacationing in the desert. Shortly after rescuing Katie, the two suddenly became smitten by her, and constantly bickered about whom she loved more. Not impressed, Katie decided to tell the two about the legend of Tinabula. She told them about the history of the city and how it vanished with nary a trace. Katie then explained about how the ringing of the three golden bells would resurrect Tinabula. She wrapped up by explaining how she alone knew how to use them and how she lost them at the hands of Klang.

When Katie tried to report the case to the Ghafian police, they immediately discounted it. Katie stormed out of the office, vowing to find a way to make them believe she was telling the truth. Baloo and Louie wanted to help her, but Katie thought that the two competing for her affections would just get in the way.

That evening, Katie spent time in the hotel, only for Baloo and Louie to meet up with her again. When she entered her room at the hotel, Klang's zealots kidnap her.
