==History==
His main purpose was to try his experiment out on the Ducks by trapping them in a small town called Sunnyville, where he disguised himself as the town mechanic. He then kidnapped the town residents and made humanoid replicas of them, after he made a satellite that jammed their frequencies forcing their vehicle to break down and prevented them from using their comlinks. He was about to extract their DNA until [[Nosedive Flashblade|Nosedive]] saved them.

== Trivia ==

* The name Pretorius might be an allusion to Dr. Septimus Pretorius, the main-antagonist of the film ''The Bride of Frankenstein'' ([[1935]]).
