==Story==
===''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody''===
Bob likes to play Total World Conquest with the boys and Cody's friends, Warren and Jeremy, though they almost never finish their games because Zack and Cody usually end up fighting. Bob, as shown in "[[Smart & Smarterer]]" and "[[Odd Couples]]", is somewhat impatient. He speaks fluent French, as illustrated in the episode "[[French 101]]". In the episode, "[[Back in the Game]]", one of his beliefs is frequent, short naps. In "[[Forever Plaid]]", he states that his favorite subject is science. Bob is shown to also be talented in wood shop, creating a very well made rocking chair. He has a (possibly twin) sister, as shown in "[[Election (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)|Election]]", and a younger brother mentioned in "[[Twins at the Tipton]]". Bob likes to visits Zack and Cody just because the doorman calls him "sir". He was Puck the Fairy in the show's version of A Midsummer Night's Dream during the episode "[[A Midsummer's Nightmare]]", is on their basketball team and worked at the boys' club seen in "[[Club Twin]]" selling soda. Bob is very vulnerable to poison oak, shown in the episode "[[Ah! Wilderness!]]". In the episode "[[Super Twins]]", he is the first (and only) child to be adultified by the Meanager (Moseby) - which causes the twins remark later that he has a booming insurance business. However, this is dropped when Zack turns back time at the end of episode. Bob is one of Zack and Cody's most frequent friends featured on the show with 16 appearances.

===''The Suite Life on Deck''===
He visits Zack and Cody on the S.S. Tipton in ''The Suite Life on Deck'', which revealed he is now dating Cody's ex-girlfriend Barbara. He is portrayed by Charlie Stewart.

==Trivia==
*As seen in "Smart & Smarterer", he is known that he is dyslexic.
*As seen in "French 101", he is known to be able to speak fluent French.
*In "Super Twins", he says his name is 'Robert', suggesting that 'Bob' is a nickname given by his friends.
**However Bob was under the effects of Mr. Moseby's Green Ray that turned him into an Adult mentally. So he may have called himself 'Robert' as the result of the Green Ray.
