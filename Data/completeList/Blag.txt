'''Blag''' is the former secondary antagonist of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[2006]] animated film, ''[[The Wild]]''.

==Background==
Blag was [[Kazar]]'s former right-hand man who reluctantly assisted his master in his goal to ascend to the top of the food chain. He also serves as the main target for Kazar to abuse (due to his clumsiness) and wishes to remain a herbivore as nature intended. Additionally, he has a strong dislike for Kazar's choreography.

==Role in the film==
He was the second-in-command of Kazar's former henchman who reluctantly assisted his boss in his goal to ascend to the top of the food chain. Under Kazar's orders, Blag manages to capture [[Ryan]], while the other wildebeests push [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] off a cliff (but he survives). Near the end of the film, when Kazar orders his henchmen to finish Samson and Ryan off, Blag defies Kazar by saying that he and the other wildebeests are tired of pretending to be something they're not, and they're mostly tired of him. Kazar is then left to perish inside the volcano while Blag, the other wildebeests, and the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]] animals escape. Blag is last seen on the boat where he begins a dance off, to which all the other animals join in.

==Trivia==
*When Blag stomps a hoof on Ryan's tail to stop the lion cub from escaping, he says, "Not so fast, [[Tigger]]!", referencing the character from the [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|''Winnie the Pooh'' franchise]].
