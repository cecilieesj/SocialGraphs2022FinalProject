{{Quote|If the McDuck family wants an adventure,... WE'LL GIVE THEM THEIR LAST!|Bradford Buzzard's famous quote, revealing himself as the leader of [[F.O.W.L.]] to audience, declaring to end Clan McDuck once and for all to his henchmen.}}

'''Bradford Buzzard''' is the main antagonist of the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]]. He is the founder and leader of [[F.O.W.L.]].

==Background==
Bradford is the grandson of [[Isabella Finch]], a legendary adventurer. He was also the first of the [[Junior Woodchucks]]. Bradford used to go on adventures with his grandmother: while Finch thought of these adventures as good learning experiences for him, they actually left him traumatized. This would shape his will to try control the chaos of the world and rid it of adventure. 

==Role in the series==
In the 1960s (as seen in "[[The First Adventure!]]") Bradford worked for the spy organization [[S.H.U.S.H.]] as an accountant. While [[Black Heron]] was being brought in one day to be incarcerated, Bradford had a pitch meeting with S.H.U.S.H director [[Ludwig Von Drake|Ludwig von Drake]]. The young accountant suggested turning the organization into an all-powerful overview that retains peace and order in the world: however, von Drake scoffed at the idea since it sounded like an evil organization.

Later on, Bradford secretly goes to meet Black Heron at her cell and pitches his idea for O.W.L. (Organization for World Larceny). Heron likes the idea, but adds an "F" at the beginning for "F.O.W.L.", which Bradford reluctantly accepts. He then frees Heron, allowing her to escape.

Many years later, Bradford tagged along with Heron to follow [[Scrooge McDuck]] when the latter, along with his nephew [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and niece [[Della Duck|Della]], went to recover an artifact called the [[Papyrus of Binding]]. When the two groups encounter each other at Yellow Beak's pirate ship, Scrooge learns that Bradford is working for F.O.W.L.. However, during the chaos, Bradford uses the Papyrus's power to make himself disappear and have everyone forget he was ever there. Back in Duckburg after the ordeal, Bradford applies to work for Scrooge: since Scrooge couldn't remember him from the adventure because of the Papyrus, Bradord is hired. As Bradford is made CEO at McDuck Enterprises, he ironically declares to Scrooge that it will be the start of a beautiful friendship.

About ten years prior to the start of the series (as seen through flashbacks in "[[The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!]]"), Bradford found out that Scrooge built an spaceship to his niece, [[Della Duck]]. Knowing that losing her would crush Scrooge to the point of isolating himself and stop adventuring, Bradford anonymously leaked the information to Della, who went lost in space due to a cosmic storm. Under the pretense that Scrooge's desperate search for Della nearly caused him and his company to go bankrupt due to the number of spaceships he sent on her search, Bradford eventually pulled the plug on these missions, which would also result to Scrooge becoming alienated from most of the rest of his family. 

After Scrooge and his family had foiled [[General Lunaris|General Lunaris']] attempt to destroy planet Earth (at the end of the season finale "[[Moonvasion!]]"), Bradford, now revealed along with the Board of Directors to be High Command of F.O.W.L., has had enough of the dangers brought by Scrooge and his family's adventures, which hinders the organization's schemes of world larceny. He decides it's time to give the McDuck family its ''last'' adventure. 

However, in their final showdown, Bradford was defeated by Scroogeâ€™s allies and was transformed by [[Magica De Spell]] into a non-sentient non-anthropomorphic vulture.

==Personality==
At first, Bradford appears to be nothing more than a pragmatic, if greedy (even more than [[Scrooge McDuck]]), businessman who tries to avoid McDuck Enterprises from making costs he sees as unnecessary. This can cause him to clash with McDuck, who in turn puts his money on things that are more important than what Bradford understands.

However, behind the image of a businessman hides an insane criminal mastermind. Traumatized after his grandmother, Isabella Finch, draw him on countless adventures as a child, Bradford is determined to rid the world of anything chaotic and adventurous. He believes that the ends justify the means, refusing to see himself as a villain merely because everything he does is so he can prevent chaos, even through his actions are objectively evil and cross any moral limit. He is also authoritarian, believing the best way to protect the world is to "rule the world from the shadows with an iron fist", a train of thought he keeps even after being told by S.H.U.S.H. director [[Ludwig Von Drake]] that it would make the agency no better than the villains they fight, which also displays stubbornness in him.

He is primarily fixated on finishing McDuck's adventures, believing his adventurous lifestyle to be the reason behind worldwide chaos due to him being involved in said chaos. This shows him to be somewhat insane, being unable to see how McDuck's adventures are involved with something that already existed and, thus, involve events that could have happened to anybody who found himself in the same situation, or that there's chaos that didn't involved McDuck at all, in spit of being aware of beings that far preceded him such as Greek gods.

Another aspect of Bradford's personality is how he blames everybody else for his actions. This is most notably seen during his last battle with the Duck family, where he blames them for turning him into a villain due to his transformed villainous appearance product of the Sword of Swinesistine, even though both [[Bentina Beakley]] and [[Della Duck]] point out to him that the sword merely exposes to the outside someone's true self. He also shows this earlier when exposing his motivations to McDuck, blaming him for [[Magica De Spell]]'s shadow attack on [[Duckburg]] (when his machinations left Scrooge vulnerable to her plot), the Moonlanders' invasion (when it was him manipulating Della what eventually led to Lunaris being able to launch the invasion, which he planned long before meeting Della), and even the creation of the [[Rescue Rangers]] (who were created by F.O.W.L. and Scrooge was never even aware of).

He is also sadistic, having taken personal joy in tormenting McDuck emotionally to get him to cease adventuring, as displayed when he revealed he told Della about the Spear of Selene, causing her to be stranded and assumed dead for 10 years and [[Donald Duck]] to cut ties with McDuck, and even trying to kill Donald even after Scrooge commits to his terms merely to spite him, something Bradford even admits to be an act of villainy. As sadistic as he is, Bradford is also a coward, who would run away from danger at the first chance once things go out of his control.

Bradford is shown to see "adventure" and "chaos" as one and the same, not realizing that an adventure is an state of mind and not necessarily a type of experience, in turn leaving him unable to grasp how having a family can be an adventure, as he also never understood what it is to have a family, never really loving his grandmother and seeing his F.O.W.L. co-workers as associates he could dispose of.

Committing immoral acts while believing himself to be a good person, Bradford is ultimately a broken man, too caught up within his trauma and pride to see the monster he has become.
