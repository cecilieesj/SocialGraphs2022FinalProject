During the Eid Al-Adha festival, held by the local mosque, Hameed climbs into one of the nearby towers, to take a selfie on the ledge. He becomes distracted by the various filters on his camera, and falls off. Hameed quickly hangs onto a curtain hung above the window, but the rail it's attatched too soon begins to break. He screams for help and calls for his mother and father, alterting the others who are in attendance of the festival, to gether around him. While he continues to scream for help, [[Ms. Marvel|Night Light]] arrives on the roof of the mosque, and assures Hameed he won't fall. To keep his mind distracted, she asks him to talk about something he likes, and Hameed talks about his favorite food, ice cream pizza. She questions if thats one food or two, and he clarifies its one, as he puts ice cream on pizza, because he likes the favours. As another rail breaks, Night Light creates an energy construct, below Hameed's feet. The final rail breaks, and he slips off construct, and begins falling, crashign into Night Light who stood on a platform below him. As they both begin to tumble down, she creates another construct, halfway through their fall, which the pair safetly land on. He looks in awe of the glowing crysalline construct he in standing on, and confirms hes okay to Night Light. The heroine jumps off the construct, and onto the roof, and extends her arm out for Hameed, so he can do the same. Before he has a chance to do so, the construct he is standing on shatters, and Hameed begins to fall, once again. As he tumbles down, Night Lights creates smaller constructs, which Hameed bounces off of, on his way down and lessening the impact. He crashes into the hood of a car, and finds that his ankle is injured, as the group watching, all gather around him. 

==Trivia==
*During his rescue by [[Ms. Marvel|Night Light]] in the [[Crushed (Ms. Marvel)|second episode]], he can be seen wearing [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]]'s shoes, revealing to the audience, that he is the Mosque Shoe Thief.
