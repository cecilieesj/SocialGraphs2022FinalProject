'''Captain Peghook''' is a minor villain in the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]] ''reboot. He is the ghost of a parrot pirate<ref>[https://suspendersofdisbelief.tumblr.com/post/175239678826/what-sort-of-bird-was-captain-peghook-in-life Frank Angones on Tumblr]</ref> who once terrorized and plundered the River Styx.
==Background==
The origins of Captain Peghook are unknown. The only hint to his past was that he once battled the McDucks, consisting of [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his nephew and niece [[Donald Duck]] and [[Della Duck]]. It was during this encounter that Peghook was defeated and apparently sealed inside a treasure chest by the triumphant ducks and taken back to McDuck manor. The pirate would remain trapped inside it for many years.

==Role in the series==
Peghook's first appearance was in the TV special "[[Woo-oo!]]" where he was released by Webby Vanderquack and proceeded to attack her, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. He teams up with the other ancient evils the children accidentally release until Scrooge appears, who came in to demand what was going on. When the pirate demands Scrooge's head as tribute, Scrooge manages to defeat Peghook by tricking him into giving a head of his own statue. Peghook then disappears, realizing that he should have been more specific.

==Trivia==
*Peghook is featured with the other villains in the show's [[DuckTales Theme|intro]].
*Interestingly, he shares the same name with another pirate, [[Captain Peg-Hook]]. Whether this is a coincidence or not is unknown.
