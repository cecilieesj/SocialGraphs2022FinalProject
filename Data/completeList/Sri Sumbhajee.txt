'''Sri Sumbhajee Angria''' is a supporting character in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise, first appearing in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. He is the Pirate Lord of India with a high-pitched voice, and one of the current members of the [[Brethren Court]]. 

==Background==
Sumbhajee is described to be wise and intelligent. Due to his high-pitched voice, he allowed others to speak during the meeting.

As the Pirate Lord of [[India]], Sumbhajee hails from a palace in his hometown (presumably implied to be Bombay). He wears long green, red, and golden brown robes, alongside a green and red turban and also has a long gray beard. Sumbhajee rarely speaks, due to his high-pitched falsetto voice, which is the reason he has additional assistants to help him talk for him during meetings.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''===
In a plan to consult the pirate lords of the [[Brethren Court]] at Shipwreck Cove to fight against [[Davy Jones]] working for [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]], Sumbhajee and the rest of the pirate lords are present with [[Jack Sparrow]] and his crew attending under command by [[Hector Barbossa]] where all the pirate lords hand their pieces of eight to bind Calypso in a plan to fight Davy Jones under command of Lord Cutler Beckett. In a plan to fight against Davy Jones and free Calypso, Sumbhajee and the other pirate lords refuse to listen and fight each other in a brawl, believing Calypso is a threat to the Brethren Court. Barbossa, however, stops the fight, clarifying that it was the First Court who imprisoned Calypso, planning to release her. Jack Sparrow takes part in a speech devising a plan to fight against the [[East India Trading Company|EITC]]'s forces while Barbossa summons [[Captain Teague]] to which one of Sumbhajee's men, Askay, claims that Jack's plan is a folly to which Captain Teague stops him from causing the Court to claim Jack a liar.

As Captain Teague arrives, he shows Jack's crew and the Brethren Court the Codex to which all the pirate lords vote for themselves and as [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] plans to fight against the EITC, Sumbhajee and the other pirate lords accept Elizabeth's request in a plan to fight against the EITC. Later when Elizabeth commands all the pirates to raise their flags to prepare for battle, Sumbhajee is present with the pirate lords who also raise their flags to prepare to fight against Davy Jones and the EITC under Elizabeth's command. After Davy Jones falls to his death during battle at the maelstrom and Lord Cutler Beckett is defeated for good, Sumbhajee and the other pirate lords celebrate their freedom from the EITC, alongside [[Tai Huang]] and his men and the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' in victory.

==Trivia==
*Sumbhajee is likely named after real-world pirate [[Wikipedia:Sambhaji Angre|Sambhaji Angre]], son of infamous admiral [[Wikipedia:Kanhoji Angre|Kanhoji Angre]]. However, Sambhaji and Sumbhajee cannot be the same person due to different timelines taking place between the events of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''.
*On Disney Cruise Line's restaurant menu for Pirate Night, an appetizer item of vegetable samosas is named after Sri Sumbhajee.
