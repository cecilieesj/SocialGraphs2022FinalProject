'''Karen Mildred "Agent K" Daring''' is the adoptive mother of [[Todd Daring]] and [[Riley Daring]] and wife of [[Dick Daring]].

==Appearance==
Agent K has long platinum blonde hair, black eyes, and lightly tanned skin. Her lips are a peachish color. Her eyelids are a shade or two darker than her skin. Her eyebrows are a very dark brown to a black and are thin. She wears white earrings that look like small white dots or pearls. Her outfit appears to be a solid black suit. It comes down to being a black turtle neck, black figure hugging pants with a black belt, and black slightly high heeled boots. That is her normal attire apart from her enormous array of various disguises. Along with her uniform or what not is a large array of weaponry.

==Background==
From an outside view it may seem she doesn't care for her kids or husband, but in fact she loves them devotedly, even though she may express it through a recording or videotape. If something is done unfairly, she fixes it very quickly. She is seen to be a terrible cook. Her career as a spy has also made her highly suspicious of anything that is the least bit out-of-place, to the point of paranoia. In the episode "[[Abra K Dabra!]]", it is revealed that she has stage fright and that her middle name is Mildred. She also has a habit for thinking all her chores are secret missions. She plays classical violin. K once took karate lessons from the evil Master Pho (Master Foe) to bust his secret evil bank-robbing karate gang. Even though she's just as logical as C.A.R., she seems to favor Dick over him. Even though both Dick and Agent K are the replacement adoptive parents, they still seem to be very much in love and care for Riley and Todd as their own children

==Trivia==
*In the episode "London Calling", it is revealed that during her school years at the spy academy, the only classÂ she ever failed was cooking.
