==Appearance in modern comics==
[[File:Oswald_Ortensia_comic_En_magisk_jul!.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Oswald, Ortensia and Homer in "En magisk jul!"|alt=]]
Homer makes an surprising return in the Norwegian comic "En magisk jul!" ("Just Like Magic!"). This marks the first Oswald and [[Ortensia]] appearance in modern Disney comics outside of the Epic Mickey universe and Homer's first outing in more than 70 years.

Written by David Gerstein and the art by Mark Kausler. It is based and takes place in the times of the classic Oswald shorts from 1927/1928.

In this comic, Homer is Ortensia's bratty little brother and both have a rich banker father called J. P. Whiskers. Homer wants to embarrass Oswald in front of Ortensia as much as possible. His appearance in this comic confirm his name as Homer in the Disney universe.
