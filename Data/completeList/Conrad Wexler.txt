'''Principal Conrad Wexler''' is a character and antagonist in ''[[Even Stevens]]''. He is portrayed by George Anthony Bell.

==History==
He is the fun-loving, caring principal of Lawrence Jr. High School in Sacramento, California from the show [[Even Stevens]]. He tries his hardest to be stern (especially with students like [[Louis Stevens]]...), but is generally a softie. He has a different tie for every single day of the school year, and his student assistant was none other than [[Ren Stevens]] before she graduated from Lawrence in [[2003]].
