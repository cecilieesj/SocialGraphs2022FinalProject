'''Buttermaker''' is a student at [[Norrisville High]]. He is the captain of the "Wave Slayers," the school's water ski team, and seems a normally nice and friendly guy. He appeared in "[[Wave Slayers]]". In that episode, he became [[Stank|Stanked]] following his water ski accidentally getting wrecked by Randy Cunningham and the Stank went into the suntan on his nose which turned him into an aquatic monster that attacked the other team. Because of the [[NinjaNomicon]]'s explanation to stanking, this suggests that Buttermaker has some attachment (besides the obvious physical one) with his nose.

==Personality==
Buttermaker's demeanor is calm and laid back--mostly. He is one of the popular kids that Randy has a better opinion of. He gets distressed if he feels he has let down his team in some way. He's also very forgiving, only flicking Randy's ears for damaging his slayer after Randy confessed and apoligized. He doesn't seem too bright, or at least is oblivious sometimes, missing the obvious damage on his slayer just because he could see his reflection in it.

==Appearance==
===Everyday===
Buttermaker is buff. He has blue eyes and long blond hair covering the right side of his face. He wears a Norrisville High sports jacket, a light green shirt, blue jeans, and green shoes.

===Monster Form===
when Buttermaker is stanked by the Sorcerer, he is transformed into an olive green aquatic monster with four arms and four legs. As a monster, Buttermaker is able to swim underwater and leap out of the water to attack.

==Trivia==
*Although he hardly knows Randy, Buttermaker seems to be friendly to him, even calling him RC.
*Buttermaker made a nonspeaking cameo in "[[Sword Quest]]".
*In the episode "[[Night of the Living McFizzles]]", Buttermaker made a cameo where he is screaming like a girl and he is with Mike Moe, S Renisewn, and the Nameless Girl with Big Eyelashes.
*He falls under the Sorceress's love spell in "[[Sorcerer in Love]]". He's carrying a box with something of true beauty inside to please her in the line, and attacks the Ninja when she commands him and the others boys.
*In "[[Got Stank?]]" episode Buttermaker made a cameo where he's inside of the Norrisville High Gymansium "Fish Cage" and he's with 2 other Norrisvillian Female Students where is also in the Fish Cage.
*He may be a bit of a coward as seen in "Night of The Living McFizzles" and "[[Lucius O'Thunderpunch]]" when he is on someone elses lap.
