'''Moose''' is a minor character from ''[[The Black Cauldron]]''. His only appearance is when he ties up [[Fflewddur Fflam]] in the dungeon and then leaves. It is often speculated by fans that he was originally going to have a bigger role in the film.

==Appearance==
Moose's only appearance in the film is when he ties up Fflewddur Fflam in the dungeon and then looks at Fflewddur with a dumb expression on his face and then leaves.

==Trivia==
*Although not mentioned in the film, this henchman character is named Moose because the original trailer for ''The Black Cauldron'' that was shown on the 1985 VHS release of ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]] ''confirmed his name.
*Although there are sources that say that Moose never made it into the film he actually is in the film, although he only appears briefly for a little while.
*It is often speculated by fans that Moose was originally supposed to have a bigger role in the film. This was to be the case but unfortunately, because of the film's troubled history of production, Moose only showed up in a short brief scene.Â 
*It is unknown what happens to Moose after he ties up Fflewddur and leaves the dungeon. He either escaped the castle from the [[Cauldron Born]], got killed by the Cauldron Born, or died in the explosion of the castle.
