He was to be [[Ariel]]'s companion and friend (with the voice of [[Robin Williams]]) but was replaced by [[Flounder]]Â and a lot of the lines written for Breaker were given to Ariel.

==Possible Cameo Appearance==
During [[Sebastian]]'s rendition of "[[Under the Sea]]", the dolphin swimming around while [[Sebastian]] sang, "as off through the waves we roll, yeah", was supposedly a cameo appearance of Breaker.
