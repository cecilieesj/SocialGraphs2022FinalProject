}}'''Manny''' is a character of the Disney comics, created by Bruno Enna for the comic book series ''[[X-Mickey]]''. She is the dark version of [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], though they are two different characters.

==Appearance and Character==
Manny is one of the inhabitants of the World of the Impossible. She is the Guardian of order, making sure that everything is always for the better. She has a good and kind heart.

==Appearances==
She appeared for the first time in the first story of the X-Mickey series, ''In the Mirror'', an episode written by Bruno Enna and designed by Alessandro Perina.
==Trivia==
*Manny is likely to be immortal, or at least to have a very long lifespan, as in the last story her butler and maid grumble because she hasn't come home "in the last two hundred years".
