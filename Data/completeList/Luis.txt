Luis is the former cellmate of Scott Lang and also a great friend. He was arrested and sent to San Quentin after having stolen two smoothie machines. As he served his sentence, he fought with an inmate named Peachy as a goodbye ritual. After the ritual, Luis became the only one able to knock out Peachy. In 2015, when Lang asked about his life, he replied that his girlfriend broke up with him, his mother died and his father was deported, but still had the van.

Having reached Luis apartment, Lang found out that Luis had told his history two robbers friends of Luis. Lang refused to commit another crime as he did not want to disappoint his daughter again. The next day, while he prepared some waffles, Lang arrives at the apartment and told him he was fired. Luis told Lang that Baskin-Robbins know everything; he then told his friend the plan of their next robbery.

That same night, Luis along Scott Lang, Kurt and Dave went to Pym's residence to commit a "theft". Here, Lang discovered that the vault was one of the safest in the world, but in one way or another would open it. He was informed by Lang there was no money or jewelry but an old motorcyclist suit. As they found nothing of value, the group decided to return to Luis apartment. Days later, Luis, Kurt and Dave were recruited by Hank Pym in order to help them to steal the Yellowjacket suit from [[Darren Cross]].

Despite making some rookie mistakes during the mission, he was able to help Lang to infiltrate into Pym Technologies. Luis later helped Pym, who had been injured by Cross. After the implosion of Pym Technologies, Luis and his friends wanted to help Lang to fight against Cross, but as the police were so close they finally decided to leave the battle zone. A few days later, Luis informed Scott that [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]] was looking for him for to have a talk.
