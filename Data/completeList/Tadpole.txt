'''Tadpole''' is a one-shot character who appears in the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[Just a Tad Smarter]]".

==History==
Tadpole is [[Toadwart]]'s cousin and the smartest and most opportunistic [[Ogre]] of the bunch.

He is a tad smaller than Toadwart, just as bossy as [[Duke Igthorn|Igthorn]], and even more abusive. He engineers the overthrow of the Duke and seizes power in [[Drekmore Castle|Drekmore]].

He hates [[Gummi Bears]] and wants to get rid of their [[Gummiberry Juice|Gummiberry bushes]]. In fact, his first command is to order the Ogres to destroy them. Against this threat, the Gummi Bears help Igthorn regain his Dukedom, if only because he himself values the crop for his own purposes.
