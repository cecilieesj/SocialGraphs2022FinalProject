==Role in the film==
At the beginning, Selkirk was seen trying to give Bartleby a pet tiger. However, Bartleby tells him and his father that he wanted an animal that he could "play" with "Buddy". Selkirk informs Bartleby that only one [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]] exists. He was offered $500,000 if he could get ahold of him. He sends [[Grim and Denning]], his idiot nephews, out to do the job.

After seeing that they captured both [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]] and [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]], he suddenly realizes that they already had five golden retriever puppies and that they weren't captured. Selkirk knows they would be worth a fortune. He threatens them that if they don't get the puppies, Grim and Denning become the tiger's lunch.

Later, he discovers that the puppies came to his manor, Bartelby was so impressed that he gave Selkirk the money he had longed for. After learning that the puppies escaped, they went back in the manor to find them. [[Noah Framm|Noah]] and Henry rolled a few barrels that chased them away. The big vat of wine also breaks and the wine pushed them out of the manor. In the end, Selkirk gets arrested by [[Sheriff Bob]].
