'''Sparky''' is the sidekick of [[Goofy|Goofy's]] historical counterpart from London, England in the episode "[[Sherlock Goof]]" from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney's]] animated series, [[Goof Troop]].

==Background==
He was originally a normal mouse infesting the home of [[Mayor Baba|Sir Reginald]], who enjoyed foiling [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof's]] attempts to catch him. However, after one of [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] minions got caught in one of Sherlock's mousetraps, he went from exterminator to detective overnight, with Sparky becoming his sidekick.

===Personality===
Sparky enjoys a good laugh, even at the expense of other people. He is also arrogant, rolling his eyes as Sherlock received praise for catching one of [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] minions.

===Physical appearance===
Sparky is a typical, small, gray mouse. Unlike other non-anthropomorphic animals of the series, though, Sparky does have the limited ability to talk, albeit in short phrases and one-word sentences.

===Role in the series===
He only appears in the Goof History episode, "[[Sherlock Goof]]". He initially was a bother to the protagonist, [[Goofy|Sherlock Goof]], but after receiving fame for the capturing of one of [[Pete|Professor Inferiority's]] minions, he became Sherlock's sidekick.

==Trivia==
*Another character from Goof Troop is also named Sparky. He is the [[Myron the Bulk|Bulk's]] manager in the episode, "[[The Incredible Bulk (Goof Troop)]].
**Ironically, both characters are voiced by Frank Welker.
