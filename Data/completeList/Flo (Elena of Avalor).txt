|status=Active|owner=[[Princess Elena]]}}'''Flo''' is a character from ''[[Elena of Avalor]]''. She started out as an alpacamundi (half-alpaca/half-coati) model of the Carnaval float until Elena unexpectedly brought her to life with her new magical abilities.

== Role in the series==
Flo made her debut in [[The Magic Within]] She acts like a hyperactive child/pet. She helps Elena realize that her enhanced magic isn't something to fear as long as she uses it for good. 

In supsequent episodes Flo joins Elena on many adventures. She is always happy to help whether its making chocolate or being used as a test subject for magical spells. Her cheery nature helps Elena and others to look at the bright side of any situation.

Flo often speaks her mind without any tact, such as telling Armando how awful he is at singing. She is also impatient and will often look for a magical solution to solve problems, even if the person has no understanding of the subject.

She is also a romantic as she loves watching people getting together on Sweethearts Day and recalling the event over and over.

Flo sees Elena's family as her family. She even particpated in the song for Aubela singing about how she was also like a mother to her.

She is also very inquisitve, asking questions about everything about the world around her. She considers herself Elena's adorable sidekick and will follow her anywhere, even to the spirit world.

She is last seen sitting on the dias smiling at a newly crowned Queen Elena.
