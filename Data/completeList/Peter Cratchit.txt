His siblings are [[Betina and Belinda Cratchit|Betina Cratchit, Belinda Cratchit]], and [[Tiny Tim|Tiny Tim Cratchit]].

In ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', he is portrayed by [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse|Ferdie Fieldmouse]], to match Morty as Tiny Tim, though he is never referred to by name.

In ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'', Peter is played by a Muppet frog a few years older than [[Kermit the Frog]]'s nephew [[Robin the Frog|Robin]]. Peter takes after his father and tends to be brushed to the side by his more forceful sisters. In the character commentary on the Blu-ray, [[Rizzo the Rat]] says his real name is Peter the Frog. This is also mentioned in ''[[The Muppets Character Encyclopedia]]''.
