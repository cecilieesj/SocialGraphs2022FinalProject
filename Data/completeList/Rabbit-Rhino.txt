}}The '''Rabbit-Rhino''' is a creature featured on the animated television show ''[[Kim Possible]]''.
==History==
Rabbit-Rhinos are mutant cuddle buddies that are mixed of rabbits and rhinos. [[Amy Hall|DNAmy]] has created a gigantic rabbit with a rhino head and rabbit whiskers, ears, and teeth. A male was seen in the episode "[[Downhill]]" where it served as DNAmy's pet and minion.

It captured Ron, [[Steve Barkin|Mr. Barkin]], and Rufus. Kim sees the Rabbit-Rhino's footprints. She made it to DNAmy's lair, but she was attacked by a [[Snake-Cat]]. It started constricting her like an anaconda, but the two fell and the Snake-Cat is knocked out. Kim throws two cuddle buddies at the Pig-Man and Bird-Man. Mr. Barkin and Rufus were mutated and they become Naked Mole Man. The Rabbit-Rhino grabs Kim in his terrible paws. Kim sees the creator of cuddle buddies cuddling with Naked Mole Man. Kim had an idea, she told Snowy the Rabbit-Rhino doesn't care about him and told him he was another collectible to her. The Rabbit-Rhino becomes jealous and angry and fights Naked Mole Man.

Naked Mole Man picks up the Rabbit-Rhino and he falls and crushes the Pig-Man and Bird-Man. Rufus and Mr. Barkin were both back to normal, but Rufus was wearing Mr. Barkin's clothes and Mr. Barkin... he was naked and tells Ron that he needs pants. Kim and Ron become shocked that Barkin is wearing nothing. DNAmy's lair exploded and it is possible that her mutant cuddle buddies were dead. Kim and the others escaped and DNAmy was sent to jail.
