She is an art dealer who dated criminal businessman [[Kingpin|Wilson Fisk]], even after learning about his shady, unethical dealings. He proposed to Marianna at the time he had been found out and taken by the FBI in his own apartment, which she accepted, but was forced to stay away from Fisk and go on the run by [[Daredevil]]. Two years later, she was reunited with Fisk, who manipulated the FBI to ensure his release and turn the public against Daredevil. Marianna showed she could be just as ruthless as Fisk by ordering the death of FBI agent Ray Nadeem. Marianna then married Fisk, but shortly after, Daredevil broke into their penthouse and incapacitated Fisk. With that, Daredevil had removed his mask and revealed his identity as Matt Murdock, forcing Fisk to agree to all his demands in order to protect his new wife from harm. Marianna then stood by the utterly defeated Fisk and comforted him as Daredevil left the scene. But, she would be taken into custody, not being able to say goodbye to her husband.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, Vanessa Marianna became Vanessa Fisk, adopting her husband's surname when she married [[Kingpin|Wilson Fisk]]. They were married for many years and had a son, [[w:c:marvel:Richard Fisk|Richard Fisk]].
*Vanessa also appeared in the 2018 computer-animated film, ''Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'', voiced by [[Lake Bell]]. However, this is unassociated with Disney in any way, purely a Sony Pictures Animation project.
