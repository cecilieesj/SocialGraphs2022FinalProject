In [[2018]], the Mad Titan [[Thanos]] successful collects the [[Infinity Stones]], and wipes out [[Avengers: Infinity War|half of all life in the universe]]. Joquin is amongst the survivors. [[Avengers: Endgame|Five years later]], Thanos is defeated, and all the life taken in the incident are returned.

On a mission in Tunisia, with the Air Force, Torres assists Sam Wilson against a hijacking by the LAF, managing to rescue Captain Vasant, who was taken hostage. On ground, the pair settle in an outdoor cafe, and Torres watches as Sam works the mechanics of his wings. Torres records the scenery, and also captures footage of Sam accepting thanks from locals, impressed by his Arabic. He gives information on LAF's purpose, and while scanning the area with his phone, he captures an emblem that appears on his screen, which acts as a symbol for a group known as the [[Flag Smashers]]. He tells Sam how they thought the world was better during the Blip and an essentially want a unified world without borders. Sam has him keep his eye on it, and requests that he tell him, if the situation escalates. Joaquin confirms to do so, then proceeds to question Sam about [[Captain America|Steve]]'s whereabouts, sharing conspiracy theories on how people believe he's on the moon. Sam denies these, and the pair part ways. Later on, Joaquin attends a rally held by the Flag Smashers in [[Switzerland]], outside a bank. He goes undercover, with his camera, to make sense of the situation, and notices an individual handing out masks, that belong to the group, which he accepts. Suddenly, two bags are thrown through a window, and individuals run wild in the crowd. The bags are handed out to two members in masks, and Joaquin tries to apprehend the prime robber, but is stopped by the police, who believe he is guilty. He manages to escape from the officers grasp, and when he sees the individual attack an offer, he removes his mask and holds out his gun, ready to place the man under arrest. The individual takes ahold of Joaquin's arm with enhanced strength, and disarms, before throwing him to the ground, and kicking his face in, leaving him unconscious. Following this, Joaquin contacts Sam, and gives him the footage he captured, believing the man to be the leader.

Sam and [[Bucky Barnes]] leave for Munich, [[Germany]], to investigate the Flag Smashers, and Joaquin goes aboard the plane to escort the pair.

Following a mission by Sam and Bucky, they ask Joquin to gather information on Donya Martini.

Joaquin arrives in one of the settlements camps in Latvia, where he meets up with Sam and Bucky. Sam questions what their next step is, and Joaquin shares the fallout of [[U.S. Agent|Captain America]] killing a foreign national in public, has garnered an international interest, and higher ups have begun dealing with the situation, and taking jurisdiction. He walks over to Sam's wings, having noted their damaged appearance. While he browses the broken machinery, Sam asks him if anything can be done, about the Flag Smashers, but Joaquin states they can't, as the camp has been cornered off, and Karli has vanished, and making an effort to stay incognito, after the events with Walker. Sam believes this this is the reason to get involved now, but Joaquin points out she has followers around the world, on all platforms. He questions how Sam's wings broke, but Sam doesn't reply, and Joaquin quickly goes off the matter, and decides that all they can do now is wait. Sam thanks him, and leaves with the [[Captain America's Shield|shield]], and when Joaquin reminds him that he forgot his wings, Sam tells him to keep them. Later on Joaquin contacts Sam, and shares his scans, in places of interest, which were all targeted by the Flag Smashers. He reveals that earlier that day, he got one from New York, where the headquarters for the Global Repatriation Council is located.
