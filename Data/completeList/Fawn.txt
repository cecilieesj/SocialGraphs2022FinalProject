'''Fawn''' is a talented animal fairy and one of the main characters of the ''[[Disney Fairies]]'' franchise. She is the closest to [[Tinker Bell]] in personality and expresses her desire for her to be happy, which she suggests is into tinkering. Like all fairies, she is a vegetarian due to her strong love for all animals and knows that eating animals is slaughtering them.

==Background==
===Personality===
Fawn is a rascally tomboy full of joy and mischief. She is always ready to play, and the more rough-and-tumble the game, the better. Fawn is a born prankster — she likes to play tricks on Iridessa, Beck, and Horace — and Tinker Bell loves her mischievous nature. She speaks many different animal languages, but the burp-like toad-speak is her favorite.

Fawn also has a softer side to her, being one of the caretakers of Mother Dove in the books. She is fluent in most animal languages, given that she has a connection to animals and is considered one of the best of her talent. As said before, Fawn is a tomboyish rascal, and one of the things she takes a disliking to is getting herself gussied up. As a caretaker of animals, Fawn has shown to have a strong motherly side, especially seen when she's dealing with baby birds, as she is known to assist the parenting bird in teaching the babies how to fly. She is also said to be the youngest of Tink's closest friends.

===Physical appearance===
Like all fairies and sparrow men, Fawn is small and hand-sized. She has a slender model. She wears an orange dress with a vine around her waist, dark brown leggings, and orange swirl flats. She has a Latina-looking appearance. She has medium skin, freckles, long light brown hair styled into a braided ponytail, and amber eyes. She has slightly orange-tinted wings. The original design for Fawn was a sleeveless top and a skirt.

In ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue'' and in the beginning of ''[[The Pixie Hollow Games]]'', Fawn's outfit is different. She wears an orange shirt and shorts. She does not wear shoes. Her shirt has brown spots all over it, resembling the patterns of a leopard.
[[File:Fawn's ankle bracelet.png|thumb|Fawn's ankle bracelet in ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue'']]

In ''Tinker Bell and the Legend of The Neverbeast'', Fawn's appearance changed to a dress with a strap at a side adorned with feathers and is wearing boots. She is seen wearing makeup and is completely different. In a deleted scene, Fawn says that she has "the same look but different cover".

==Film Appearances==
===''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]''===
[[File:Fawn001a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fawn in ''Tinker Bell''.]]
Fawn is first seen at Tinker Bell's birth, along with many other fairies and sparrow men, to see what talent Tink is destined to become. Tinker Bell is destined to become a tinker fairy, though the desire to go to the mainland alongside the nature-talent fairies gives Tink the wish to change her talent. Like her friends [[Rosetta]], [[Iridessa]] and [[Silvermist]], Fawn is against Tinker Bell's desire to change talents but goes through with it anyway to help her friend.

Fawn attempts to teach Tinker Bell how to teach baby birds the art of flight, which requires patience and coordination, something Tinker Bell lacks. Instead, the lesson leads to a deadly hawk attack and results in another failure for Tinker Bell's talent-changing mission. Later on, Fawn and the others spot Tinker Bell fixing a ballerina music box she found, proving to Fawn and the others that Tinker Bell is indeed meant to become a tinker fairy.

At the film's climax, Tinker Bell accidentally unleashes Sprinting Thistles as a result of [[Vidia]]'s plot to ruin the tinker. The thistles destroy all of the festivities are considered for the nature fairies to travel to the mainland to change the season. However, Tinker Bell adds her talent to good use by conjuring up several innovations, able to restore the preparations in no time. Fawn stands by Tink's side and uses these new innovations, and at the end, the season is able to change on schedule.

At the end, Fawn and the others travel to the mainland, with Tinker Bell by her side, who is to return the music box she restored to [[Wendy Darling|its rightful owner]].

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]''===
In the sequel, Fawn is first seen in the mainland, changing the season to the fall. Later on, she attends [[Fairy Tale Theatre|the show at the Fairy Tale Theater]] and sits along with Tinker Bell and [[Fairy Mary]]. The following days, Fawn spends time on preparations for the blue harvest moon festival, a night where blue pixie dust is gave upon Pixie Hollow and the pixie dust tree. Fawn is seen celebrating along with Iridessa, Silvermist, and Rosetta on behalf of Tinker Bell's success in owning the blue pixie dust.

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue]]''===
[[File:Tink3-disneyscreencaps.com-3940.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fawn in ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue''.]]
Fawn and her friends leave [[Pixie Hollow]] for the summer-long camp on the mainland. There, Tinker Bell is captured by a human girl named [[Elizabeth Griffiths|Lizzy]], having Fawn and the others stray off to rescue her. Due to the heavy rain, however, the fairies are forced to build a boat to get to Lizzy's house. While making way on the boat, Fawn notices a waterfall ahead and warns the others to brace themselves. Luckily, Silvermist is able to rescue them. Once they finally reach the human house, Fawn and her friends are attacked by their cat. Despite being an animal fairy, Fawn is unable to immediately tame the cat under pressure. A chase pursues before Fawn is able to find catnip, eventually taming the cat. While Fawn and the others are taming the cat, Vidia is kidnapped by [[Dr. Griffiths|Lizzy's father]] and is taken to London for study.

Fawn and the others grant pixie dust upon Lizzy and fly to Vidia's rescue. When all is peaceful again, Fawn and the others have a picnic with Lizzy and her father, who finally understands the error of his ways.

===''[[Secret of the Wings]]''===
[[File:foto-fawn-de-campanilla-el-secreto-de-las-hadas-047.jpg|thumb|250px|Fawn in ''Secret of the Wings''.]]
When it is time for animals to hibernate and retrieve their winter coats, Fawn begins to cross animals over the border to the Winter Woods. One particular rabbit is afraid to cross and tries to evade Fawn. The chase leads to the tinker fairies area where Tinker Bell catches the rabbit using a fishing rod-type invention. When Tinker Bell learns that Fawn crosses animals over, Tink offers to help, hoping to journey into the Winter Woods. However, when the two fairies arrive, Fawn says that animal fairies - and all warm fairies - are banned from crossing; they just see the animals off. Fawn then tries to wake one of the animals that began hibernating too early. While Fawn does this, Tink crosses the border.

Fawn notices and reels Tink back over with the rod. Fawn then notices that the tip Tink's wings were frozen and rushes the tinker to the healing-talented fairies. Silvermist, Vidia, Rosetta, and Iridessa meet with Fawn and Tink at the doctor. Tink recovers easily after her wings were warmed, and the fairies are able to leave. It was then that Tinker Bell tells her friends that her wings began to glow when she crossed the border. None of her friends believe her, including Fawn, who did not notice. To find out more, Tink crosses the border once again. When she returns, she tells her friends that she met her long-lost sister, a winter fairy named [[Periwinkle]].

To allow Periwinkle to visit the warm regions of Pixie Hollow, Fawn assists Tink and her friends in creating a snowmaking machine. The next day, the fairies introduce Peri to the wonders of the warm parts, showing off their unique abilities in the process. Fawn was able to show Periwinkle her first group of butterflies, something Peri has dreamed of for a while. Soon enough, however, Peri begins to become weak due to the heat, so Tink and the others rush her back over to the Winter Woods. [[Lord Milori]], the ruler of the Winter Woods, and [[Queen Clarion]] declare that Tinker Bell and Periwinkle may never see each other again for their own safety.

Some time afterward, the snowmaking machine goes on the fritz and freezes a portion of Pixie Hollow. Fawn and the others destroy the machine, but the half-frozen Pixie Hollow throws off the balance of the season. Soon enough, all of Pixie Hollow becomes threatened, including the Pixie Dust Tree. To save the tree, Peri and the frost fairies use their frost magic to preserve the tree, thus saving fairy life. In the end, Queen Clarion and Lord Milori allow warm fairies to cross the border. Fawn is last seen enjoying herself in the snow with her friends and the mischievous rabbit that was afraid to cross earlier.

===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''===
During the Four Seasons Festival, Fawn and the fairies prepare for their act when Zarina, the pirate fairy, puts all the fairies to sleep and steals the Blue Dust. She accompanies her friends in getting the dust back, but Zarina magically swaps their talents, and Fawn becomes a light fairy. She has trouble controlling her new ability at first (to the point that she accidentally fires off part of Rosetta's hair, though Rosetta doesn't know this until near the end). Eventually, she manages to master it to help defeat the pirates, and in the end, Zarina restores her original talent.

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast]]''===
[[File:Legend-of-the-NeverBeast-8.png|thumb|250px|Fawn's fierce determination and assurance that the Neverbeast would never hurt anyone.]]
Fawn is the protagonist of the film where she befriends a huge and mysterious creature known as the NeverBeast (who she calls [[Gruff]]).

However, Tink and her best friends are not so sure about this scary addition to Pixie Hollow. When the elite Scout Fairies set out to capture the monster, Fawn must trust her heart and take a leap of faith if she hopes to rally the girls to save the NeverBeast.

Throughout the film, Fawn sought to keep Gruff a secret as everyone else would have considered him a threat to Pixie Hollow, especially when she kept a baby hawk around. When she discovers that he had been building lightning towers in each region, Fawn couldn't keep him a secret any longer. By the time Gruff partially transformed, she assumed that he knocked Tinker Bell out cold. What she didn't know earlier was that he was actually ''saving'' her from a falling tree.

After Gruff was blinded by Nyx and the scout fairies, it was up to Fawn to help Gruff gather up lightning from the towers before it was too late for Pixie Hollow. Before they reached the last tower, it was destroyed by Nyx, and that the electricity Gruff gathered was lost back into the clouds. The only other option for her was to lead Gruff to the eye of the storm and gather all of the power at once. After Pixie Hollow was saved, Fawn was shown to have died from the impact. However, when Gruff rubbed off a bit of lightning from his fur, it had brought Fawn back to life. At the end of the film, she and the other fairies had to prepare a proper way for him to hibernate again for almost an entire millennium, meaning that Fawn could never see him again.

[[File:Fawndisneyfairiesbook.jpeg|thumb|250px|Artwork of Fawn in ''Fawn and the Mysterious Trickster''.]]
At the beginning of ''[[The Trouble with Tink]]'', Fawn is seen playing fairy tag.

Fawn is the central character in ''Fawn and the Mysterious Trickster'' with Tinker Bell and the other fairies. The story centers around Fawn, the mistress prankster of Pixie Hollow. However, [[Beck]] plays a prank on Fawn that is so good that it nearly scares the pixie dust off of her. Throughout more of the story, Fawn and Beck are at an all-out prank war. Eventually, Fawn is joked once again, but this time, Beck is innocent, leaving the true prankster a mystery.

In ''Beck and the Great Berry Battle'', she is seen at the beginning when a baby raccoon needed help. She is one of the first fairies to get hit by a berry during the Berry Battle before lunch. She also tries to help negotiate things between the hummingbirds and chipmunks but fails.

She appears briefly in ''Silvermist and the Ladybug Curse'', playing games with the other fairies at the fairy picnic.

==Other Appearances==
===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===
[[File:Fawn 1024x768.jpg|thumb|250px|Fawn in ''Pixie Hollow Games''.]]
Fawn appears in the television special, representing the animal talent fairies. In her "How Do I Train" short, Fawn picks her teammate through bullfrog-riding. At the end, when no one else is available, her teammate becomes Buck. At the time of the actual games, Fawn and Buck win the first competition, though the winners overall become Rosetta and her teammate Chloe, much to the delight of Fawn and the others.

===[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]===
Fawn is featured as the hostess of the Pixie Hollow mini-game. Fawn is planning on giving the last few cherries in Pixie Hollow to some baby birds in the game. However, Fawn eats all of the cherries, leaving behind only one seed. She needs a way to get more, with the baby birds becoming very anxious. Fawn asks Tink for help, and a plan commences. Tink takes a twig and drills a hole into the ground. Fawn places the last seed in the hole. The hole is covered up, and Silvermist sprinkles water on it. Iridessa then comes to shed light on the seed, and Rosetta uses some of her nature abilities to make the seed grow faster into a cherry tree, giving the baby birds plenty of cherries to eat.

===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===
[[File:46415 713354834442 3255484 n.jpg|thumb|250px|Fawn at one of the Disney parks.]]
Fawn and her fairy friends met regularly at [[Pixie Hollow (attraction)|Pixie Hollow]] in [[Disneyland]] during the run of the Disney Fairies franchise.

In the spring, a topiary of Fawn was featured during the [[Epcot]] Flower and Garden Festival. In the Spring of 2009 and 2010, Fawn, along with the other fairies, was featured in Fairies Primavera at [[Tokyo DisneySea]]. To date, Fawn is not seen in any of the parks and is considered rare.

==Trivia==
*Her name is a play on the word Fauna, which deals with animals, connecting with her fairy talent. Her name could also be a reference to the name of a baby deer.
*Her favorite flowers are Tiger Lilies.
*In ''Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue'', she is the only fairy in Tink's gang that is barefooted, aside from Rosetta who lost her shoes in one scene.
*Fawn is the second fairy in the ''Tinker Bell'' series to sing onscreen, after [[Lyria]]. In the short film "Tink'n About Animals", she sings "[[Fawn's Animal Group Song]]".
*Fawn's role in ''Legend of the NeverBeast'' is similar to Hiccup's from ''How to Train Your Dragon''. Both have housed what others think to be dangerous creatures (Gruff the Neverbeast for Fawn, and Toothless the Night Fury for Hiccup), and nearly die in the end, only to be saved by their creatures.
**Despite being voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin in this film, Fawn was coincidentally voiced by America Ferrera, who voices Astrid in the ''How to Train Your Dragon'' franchise, in her first appearance.
*Fawn seems to have an under referenced connection with frogs, in almost all the Disney Fairy shorts where she plays the main role, she's always seen working with them (''Eye on the Fly'', ''How I Train'' and ''No Croaking Around''). And in the first movie, ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]'' where [[Queen Clarion]] delivers the news of spring being postponed, Fawn is briefly shown carrying a frog.
