Coach '''Andre "Whiz" Wilson''' is a physical education teacher at Midtown School of Science and Technology.

Andre Wilson was created by [[Stan Lee]] and Al Hartley.



==Background==
:''"Looking good, Parker."''
:―Andre Wilson to Peter Parker

By 2016, Wilson worked as a physical education teacher at Midtown School of Science and Technology. During the classes he led, he set the Captain America's Fitness Challenge for his students to participate, although he commented that Captain America was now considered a criminal because of the Avengers Civil War. He also commended Peter Parker's physical aptitudes, unaware that the young man was actually the superhero known as Spider-Man.

:''"Why are you here? You don't even have detention.""Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis."''
:―Andre Wilson and Michelle Jones

Wilson also oversaw students who were given detention at his school, where he also played video recordings of Captain America scolding the students, although this task clearly bored Wilson. During one of those detention sessions, Wilson saw Parker leave the classroom and told him to come back, albeit in a very disillusioned way. He then asked Michelle Jones why she was here as she did not have detention, only to be told that she enjoyed drawing people in crisis just like Wilson himself.

:''"I mean, it’s crazy. I was there. And then I wasn’t there. And then… I was there again. And people asking me “where’d you go?” But I didn’t go anywhere, man. I was just not there. And then I was there again. Sorry, what was the question?"''
:―Andre Wilson

In 2018, Wilson was one of the many victims Thanos claimed with the Snap, but was resurrected by Hulk in 2023. The following year, in an interview with ''The Daily Bugle'', Wilson was asked about the Blip, before getting confused about the following question.
