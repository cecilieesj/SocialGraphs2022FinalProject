'''Sancho''' is a character who appears in the [[2021]] Disney live-action film, ''[[Jungle Cruise (film)|Jungle Cruise]]'', based on the Disney Parks attractions of the same name. He is a conquistador serving as one of [[Lope de Aguirre]]'s men who set off in an attempt to retrieve the Arrowhead from the Amazon only to be cursed by the jungle which defended its natural environment.

==History==
When [[Lope de Aguirre|Don Lope de Aguirre]] and his men went on an expedition for the [[Tears of the Moon]], Sancho and the rest of the conquistadors followed alongside their leader where he was struck by a snake but Aguirre saved him from being killed. After Aguirre was founded by the Guardians of the Tree and nursed back to life, he demanded that the tribe give him the sacred Arrowhead and the key to the Tears of the Moon. When they refused to do so, Sancho and the rest of the conquistadors attacked the tribe in war with them. However, the jungle defended its natural environment from intruders where Aguirre and his conquistadors were imprisoned in the region of Lagrimas de Cristal where Sancho, Aguirre, and the rest of the conquistadors, were punished by the jungle for stealing the Arrowhead where the conquistadors remained imprisoned for many years.

Years later, [[Prince Joachim]] and his soldiers arrive at the area where Aguirre and his conquistadors were punished by the jungle for stealing the Arrowhead where snakes and bees emerge from the imprisoned conquistadors as the undead conquistadors start to attack. At this time, Sancho became infested with bees and honey all around him and started coming to life seeking revenge against the Arrowhead.

Later when [[Frank Wolff|Frank]], [[Lily Houghton|Lily]], and [[McGregor Houghton|McGregor]] arrive at the Puka Michuna territory, Sancho and the other conquistadors came back to life and followed Aguirre in an attempt to steal the Arrowhead. During the ambush, Sancho attacked McGregor and his sister Lily but is suddenly struck by a Puka Michuna tribesman who hit him with a golf club. After Lily and her brother escape with the Arrowhead, Aguirre devises a plan for his men in a plan to take the Arrowhead from Lily much to Aguirre's revenge as Sancho sends some of his bees to alert Prince Joachim to know where Lily went.

The next day, Sancho's bees are summoned to contact Prince Joachim and his soldiers where one of them points to the area where the Arrowhead would be just as Joachim and his men arrive at the spot where the Arrowhead would be at just as Prince Joachim and his soldiers proceed to the area. At the La Luna Rota area where Aguirre and his conquistadors were punished by the jungle and after Frank, Lily, and McGregor find the sacred tree containing the Tears of the Moon, Sancho's bees appear in front of Joachim as Sancho himself appears in front of him in which while cornering Prince Joachim, he and the other conquistadors chase Lily while Frank shows the petal to Aguirre. Throughout the ambush, Sancho and the rest of the conquistadors leap down onto the La Quila where Aguirre urges Frank to give him the petal to which as Frank crashes his ship into the pillar to block the river, Sancho ended up being grabbed by the vines and was later petrified alongside Frank and the other conquistadors. Lily manages to revive Frank and save his life using a petal of the Tear of the Moon to bring him back to life.
