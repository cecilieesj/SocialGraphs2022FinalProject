'''Paul''' is the protagonist of the [[2016]] Disney animated short, ''[[Inner Workings]]''. His [[Brain (Inner Workings)|brain]] wants him to have a pragmatic personality, but his [[Heart (Inner Workings)|heart]] wants him to have a spontaneous personality. During the short film, he is unsure whether to follow his brain or his heart.

==Background==
===Personality===
Paul's personality seems to be mostly based around what his insides tell him. He is a rather pragmatic and self-conscious person. Believing that every minor thing in his life will make a big, negative impact on him. It is only through his constant avoidance of pleasures in life that he finally comes to the realization that he needs to be more outgoing and incidental, with his newfound philosophy becoming infectious to those around him.

===Appearance===
Paul is physically based on his creator [[Leo Matsuda]]. He is a tall thin man of Japanese descent with neatly combed black hair and giant square glasses. He is usually seen wearing a white dress shirt, black tie, grey sweater vest, dark grey pants and black shoes. He also wears a pin and a name tag.

==Role in the short film==
Throughout the short, Paul shows his two sides of personality: his pragmatic brain and his spontaneous heart. He leaves his house to go to work, but becomes distracted upon seeing a couple eating pancakes at a café, so he becomes unsure of what to do. After passing through a sunglasses vendor on his way to work, Paul's heart and brain have an argument.

As Paul goes to his office, he does not feel like going in sync with the other colleagues and even feels more miserable, despite his brain prompting him to continue working. However, his brain even feels more miserable just like one of the colleagues sitting next to him. Paul's brain and heart suddenly get along during lunchtime as he decides to become more spontaneous in the things he did not want to do at first such as eating a café breakfast, trying in a pair of sunglasses from the vendor, and getting into the water, making him relieved.

Feeling satisfied, Paul goes back to his office and feels the rhythm by typing on his keyboard when he and the other colleagues dance together, along with the three senior members he met outside his office.

==Trivia==
*Paul's design bears a very similar appearance to a younger version of [[Carl Fredricksen]] from the film, ''[[Up]]''.
*Goof: According to Paul’s watch, his heart and his brain get along at 12:00. But then he is seen eating a cafe breakfast despite the fact that most cafes stop serving breakfast specials at 10:00.
*Running Gag: Heart does something spontaneous which causes brain to calculate a negative outcome which ends with Paul in a coffin with a monk chanting “Infinitum Spiritum.” (the only dialogue in the short.)
