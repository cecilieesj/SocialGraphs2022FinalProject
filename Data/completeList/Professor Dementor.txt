'''Professor Dementor''' (birth last name '''''Demens''''', first name unknown) is a supervillain from the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Kim Possible]]''. He serves as a foil to [[Dr. Drakken]]; despite the two of them being mad scientists and supervillains, Professor Dementor is generally more successful and famous than he is.

==Personality==
Dementor has something of a [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] complex and is quick to anger. He generally follows a pattern of gloating, followed by exasperation, with a course of ranting to follow. He has an over-the-top German accent.

Dementor is a better scientist than Drakken and he is also capable of stealing devices for his own needs. His henchmen are more superior quality, as well. Kim generally has to work harder to foil Dementor.

However, like Drakken, Dementor also has traits of messing up his own schemes, although in lesser extent than Drakken. An example is, that he dropped his to-do-list, which allowed Kim and Ron to track him down with ease.

==Disney Parks==
Professor Dementor was one of the villains of the [[Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure]] game/experience at [[Epcot]]. He was the villain of the [[Germany Pavilion]]'s mission. After the Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure was changed to [[Agent P's World Showcase Adventure]], his statue was replaced by [[Dr. Doofenshmirtz|Dr. Doofenshmirtz's]].

==Family==
Little is known of his family, except that his mother is alive, and gets cross when he doesn't jingle. He also has a younger sister, named Hildegard, and a brother-in-law (employed as one of his henchmen) named Myron.

His family is apparently in the Strudel Business.

==Trivia==
*Dementor was mentioned several times before he appeared on-screen, mostly when being compared to Drakken.
*Dementor does not appear in the Shego-controlled Future of "A Sitch in Time." (Several other villains are also unaccounted for, including the Señor Seniors, DNAmy, and Motor Ed). It is possible that he was killed by Shego and her minions or, like Ron's parents, migrated to the Moon.
*Despite being a better villain than Drakken, Dementor has less appearances than him.
