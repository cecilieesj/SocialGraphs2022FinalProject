==Background==
Percival is described as the creator of the drink [[Pep!|PEP]]; however, in his first appearance, he is shown to have an unnamed, mentioned son. [[Doofus Drake]] felt enraged for hiring a grown-up to play his son to which Percival fearfully regrets on hiring his real son in his car.

==Role in the series==
Percival P. Peppington first appeared in the Season 2 episode, ''[[Happy Birthday, Doofus Drake!]]".''

When [[Goldie]] takes [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] to the carnival at the tree house doing a con artist plan, Percival attends [[Doofus Drake]]'s birthday party where Doofus blames him for hiring a grown-up actor pretending to be his son and demands him to hire a child actor to pretend to be his son. Just as Percival prepares to get his real son in his car, Doofus presses a switch that causes him to fall into a storage of honeybees, much to Doofus being unhappy for many liars in his party.

In "[[Louie's Eleven!]]", Percival can be seen briefly kicked out of the museum for supposedly attempting to crash the party. He later leaves in anger.

==Trivia==
* His design appears to be based on that of Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka in the 1971 musical fantasy film, ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory'', especially the cartoony depiction of him in the Wonka candy commercials and the design of Willy Wonka in the Wonka candy brand (now Nestl√© Candy Shop).
