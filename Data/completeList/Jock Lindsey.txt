He had several airplanes such as OB-CPO and OB1. Also, he had pet named Reggie, a boa constrictor.

==History==
Jock Lindsey was a skilled American aviator who frequently worked as a stunt-pilot from the 1920s through 1930s alongside several other famous pilots.  He was also leader of the, "Air Pirates Circus" which was awarded with annual stunt-show honours in 1931 by the ''Chicago Aviators & Aviatrices Flying Club''.  When he wasn't doing stunt performances, Jock assist in bringing passengers from the United States to South America as he established a base for himself in Venezuela.

By [[1934]], Jock became the aviator of archaeologist Indiana Jones though they frequently butted heads due to Jock bringing his pet boa-constrictor Reggie with him as Jones had a pathological fear of snakes.  In [[1936]], Jones and Lindsey travelled to [[Peru]] in search of the Chachapoyan Fertility Idol with some assistance from a man named Diego.  This mission was however sabotaged by rival archaeologist René Belloq who manipulated the local Hovitos tribe into attacking the pair while he made off with the idol.

When he and Doctor Jones were searching for the fabled [[Fountain of Youth]] in central [[Florida]] in [[1938]], the two crash-landed in the town of [[Disney Springs (town)|Disney Springs]]. Jock was attracted by the nature of springs and town and  in [[1948]], Jock built an airplane hangar in the town to settle down as his snake Reggie enjoyed the Floridian ecosystem.  At some point in time, Jock was brought into the membership of the ''[[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]]'' and also befriended their splinter-faction ''[[Adventurers Club|The Adventurers Club]]''.  This hangar became Jock's new headquarters and was decorated with objects and trophies from his many adventures.

In [[1955]], Jock turned the hangar into a bar which he opened to the populace of Disney Springs.  Due to his secrecy and adventuring, Jock was considered to be a considerably mysterious figure to the townsfolk.  He would continue using his plane the OB-3PO as his main form of transport but also got a steamboat known as, "The Reggie".

==Trivia==
*Jock Lindsey was played by real-life aviator Fred Sorenson who was not an actor and refused to reprise his roles in any film. He did, however, assist [[Steven Spielberg]] during production of Jurassic Park by flying to Hawaii to pick him up after he was stranded by a hurricane.
**This is alluded to in the Hangar Bar via a mounted [[Tyrannosaurus rex|T-Rex]] tooth with a note from, "S." saying, "Thanks for getting me off the island".
*Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar alludes not only to the Indiana Jones franchise but also different properties:
**'''[[Adventurers Club]]''': Jock was affiliated with several members of the Adventurers Club such as [[Samantha Sterling]], [[Hathaway Browne]] and [[Otis T. Wren]]. Photographs of these members are in the bar and Samantha Sterling's passport is in the lost & found. The goddess statue Babylonia appears in the bar in Jock's possession and his ice machine has a sign on it reading, "''Yakoose Ice Co. Est. 1938''" which references the character of the Mongolian Yakoose.
**'''[[Jungle Cruise]]''': The flight log has Jock mentioning one of the skippers from the Jungle Cruise having taken him to see [[Schweitzer Falls]]. In his bar's lost & found is a shrunken head next to several umbrellas, likely referencing the character of [[Chief Nah-Mee|Chief Nah-mee]] having attended the bar.
**'''Jurassic Park''': There is a framed T-Rex tooth with a note from, "S." reading, "Thanks for getting me off the island" in allusion to Steven Spielberg and ''Jurassic Park''.

This is a reference to the film ''The Rocketeer'' which the bar also references by having coasters from the [[South Seas Club]] appear in Jock's possession.
**'''THX 1138''': Jock's address is 1138 Seaton Avenue, referencing George Lucas' first film ''THX 1138'' (1971).
*Jock Lindsay and [[Mary Oceaneer|Captain Mary Oceaneer]] are the two S.E.A. members who are known farthest in the timeline as the latest chronological references to both occurred in 1955, being the only S.E.A. members known to have been alive and/or active in the 1950s.
*The OB-3PO's name is an allusion to the ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[C-3PO]].  Similarly, a salvaged plane inside of the Hangar Bar has the codes of, "RTO-D2" and, "RXE 2-4" referencing [[R2-D2]] and [[RX-24]].
*In the [[Adventure Trading Company]], the Daily Gnus newspaper had an advertisement for snake hatchlings from a man named, "Jacque".  It is theorized that this might have been a misprint of, "Jock".
