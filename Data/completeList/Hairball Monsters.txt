'''Hairball Monsters''' are monsters featured in the show ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. They are small, dangerous, and nasty creatures that are born from Troll hair and burnt by direct sunlight or Dragon fire. They only appear once in the series, in the episode "[[Adventures in Troll Sitting]]" in Season 1.

==Physical Appearance==
Hairball Monsters are little piles of Troll hair that have come to life. The ones seen in the series are entirely brown with red eyes and sharp fangs. They move about by either jumping, crawling or rolling around.

==Magical Powers==
Hairball Monsters have the ability to multiply as many times as they want instantly. They are extremely aggressive and vicious and will attack anything or anyone that comes close to them. They are quite resilient, but can be defeated easily if hit hard enough.

==Trivia==
*In order to defeat the Hairball Monsters, [[Jake Long|Jake]] and [[Stan Lipkowski]] (the Troll from which they came from) suck them into a vacuum cleaner that they throw out the window into the sky.
*Hairball Monsters look somewhat similar to Fizzgig, a fuzz ball dog-like pet featured in the film ''The Dark Crystal''.
