'''Edward "Ned" Low''' (c.1690â€“c.1724) is a historic pirate captain.

==History==
Ned Low was an English pirate captain active in the early 1720s. While he only operated towards the final days of the Golden Age of Piracy, he is remembered as having been one of the most brutal pirates in human history.

Ned Low was born in [[London]] around 1690 and was an illiterate thief with a tendency for violence. From a young man, he earned a reputation as a pickpocket, burglar and a prolific gambler. In 1707, Ned's brother Richard Low who was also a thief was executed by hanging for the crime of burglary.

Around 1710, Ned moved to the Americas where he would settle down in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Ned had a wife named Eliza Marble whom bore him a daughter but died during childbirth. Ned later abandoned this daughter and became a sailor, later turning to piracy. By 1722, Ned was a pirate captain known to ruthlessly mass murder captives and partake in brutal forms of torture. One incident of torture got so out of hand that Ned accidentally scarred his own lip with his own torture-device.

Ned Low supposedly died around 1724. One assertion is that he died when his flagship sank while others assert that he was mutinied and set out to sea, potentially later being captured and executed.
