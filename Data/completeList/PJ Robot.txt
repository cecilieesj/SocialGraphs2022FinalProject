'''PJ Robot''' is a supporting character from the [[Disney Junior]] show, ''[[PJ Masks]]''. He first appeared in the episode of "[[Wacky Floats]]" in the second season. His backstory was revealed in the episode "[[PJ Robot (episode)|PJ Robot]]". He joined and became the newest PJ Mask member instead of being the villain's sidekick.

==Background==
The PJ Robot was originally invented by [[Romeo]] as part of a plan to infiltrate HQ. Romeo intentionally made PJ Robot cute and friendly, knowing the heroes would like him and take him to HQ. However, PJ Robot began to genuinely like the [[PJ Masks (team)|PJ Masks]] too, and eventually doublecrossed Romeo to join them.

===Personality===
PJ Robot is very friendly and energetic and expresses his emotions by changing the digital face on his head.

===Physical appearance===
PJ Robot is shaped like an egg, colored in white with a coral red trim design. His symbol is a combination of a blue cat paw print, green lizard tail and coral red owl wings, representing his affiliation with the PJ Masks. PJ Robot has an aqua-colored digital face and wears white gloves on its hands.

==Trivia==
*His origin story is never revealed in the episode "[[Wacky Floats]]" until the episode "[[PJ Robot (episode)|PJ Robot]]".
**His actual first appearance is "[[PJ Robot (episode)|PJ Robot]]".

*The shape of PJ Robot's body is a reference to the character [[EVE]] from the film ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''.

*The facial expression on PJ Robot is almost similar to the 2005 Cartoon Network character Robotboy.
