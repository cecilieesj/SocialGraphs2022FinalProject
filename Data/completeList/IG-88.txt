'''IG-88''' is an assassin droid bounty hunter in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' Universe. He is hired by [[Darth Vader]] to capture [[Han Solo]] and also is the chief rival of [[Boba Fett]].

== Appearances ==

=== ''The Empire Strikes Back'' ===
IG-88 is summoned aboard the ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought ''Executor'' by [[Darth Vader]] in his search for the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.

=== ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]'' ===
IG-88 teamed up with [[Hondo Ohnaka]] to collect the bounty on Crimson Dawn lieutenant [[Qi'ra]]'s head. Tracking Qi'ra down, IG-88 and Hondo managed to apprehend Qi'ra. Turning the bounty hunter and the pirate against each other, Qi'ra convinced IG-88 to collect the bounty on Hondo instead of the bounty on her. Attacking Hondo, IG-88 was quickly stunned and put in binders. After Qi'ra had similarly tricked and apprehended Hondo, IG-88 was led away by Qi'ra so that she could collect the bounty on his head.

Later, IG-88 pursued Princess [[Leia Organa]] on [[Garel]], seeking a data-tape in her possession of Imperial base locations. Organa was assisted by [[Sabine Wren]], who identified the droid, and the pair fled as the assassin opened fire in the corridors of Garel City Spaceport. However, Wren planted a paint bomb, surprising IG-88, and covering him in purple paint. Leia convinced several [[stormtroopers]] to fire at the bounty hunter, and the droid was hit by a blast before retreating.

== Trivia ==
* [[Ralph McQuarrie]]'s production sketches show a sleeker design than the droid that appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and were later used as the model for the IG-RM Thug droids in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.
* The term "IG-88" is not the original name for the character, as the ''Empire Strikes Back'' script calls the character a "chrome war droid", and during production, it was called "Phlutdroid".
* The production puppet consisted of recycled props from ''A New Hope'', including the Mos Eisley cantina drink dispenser as IG-88's head.
* Another assassin droid named IG-11 appeared in ''[[The Mandalorian]]''.
