'''AC-38''', nicknamed '''Ace''', is an AC-series pilot droid that works for [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]].

== History ==
=== Background ===
AC-38 was an AC series pilot-droid who was owned by the Star Tours Travel Company at some point before the Battle of Yavin.  His unit was described by spokes-droid [[Aly San San]] as being friendly and personable but a bit testy at times.

Before one routine flight he was supposed to run, the console communicator [[C-3PO]] was sent in to deal with the computer systems of his [[StarSpeeder 1000]].  The glitch however caused C-3PO to be trapped in the pilot's seat as its captain and his attempts to leave the vehicle were troubled when the [[Galactic Empire]] raided the StarPort in-search of a rebel spy.  When it was discovered that the rebel-spy was aboard the StarSpeeder, C-3PO drove the speeder away without Ace.

Following this incident, AC units like Ace got recalled and retired from duty because of having the blame pushed on them.  Star Tours in-particular replaced them with the defective RX-unit pilot-droid which they had accidentally mass-ordered prior to their run-in with the rebellion and empire.  It is rumoured that Ace got repurposed to work as a janitor for Star Tours.

=== Development History ===
AC-38 was inspired by and modelled after RX-24 from the original [[Star Tours]] attraction who served as the ride's pilot.  He was however given a design closer to those of the droids from the Star Wars prequel trilogy.  In the ride itself, the pilot-droid character type was replaced with C-3PO from the [[Star Wars|Star Wars films]].

== Appearances ==

=== Star Tours: The Adventures Continue ===
Prior to a regular flight, Ace was supposed to fly passengers in a StarSpeeder 1000, but when the ship took off, C-3PO was in the pilot's seat instead.  He is seen in the pre-show video for the attraction in the load-area.

== Other Appearances ==

=== Star Wars: Droidography ===
AC-38 is mentioned by the rebel [[Battle Droids|battle-droid]] R0-GR who explains his fate following the events of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.
