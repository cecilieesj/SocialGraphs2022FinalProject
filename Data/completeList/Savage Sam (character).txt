==Trivia==
* His appearance and name change drastically between the two films. In ''Old Yeller'', he was named Young Yeller and was a Labrador Retriever. However, in ''Savage Sam'', he was named that and was a Bluetick Coonhound, as he was in the book. It is currently unknown why this change happened, however in the book he was always a Bluetick Coonhound; he inherited his colors from his mother, Miss Prissy. He was never named Young Yeller in the book. 
* In the first film, his barks would later be reused in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' for the [[Dalmatian Puppies|puppies]] during the ending scene.
* Also in the first film, his whimpering is really recycled sound effects from [[Lady]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' when she was a puppy.
* When he was fighting the pack of wolves his growls were recycled from his father in the first film.
