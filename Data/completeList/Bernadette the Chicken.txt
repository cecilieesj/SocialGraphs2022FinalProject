|quote ="Mmmmm! My lunch has come along just in time!!!" (Nintendo 64 version only)}}'''Bernadette''' is a large evil chicken that only appears in the video game ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers!]]''. She replaces [[Humphrey the Bear]] in Duckie Mountain as the first boss of the game in the console and PC versions.

==Role in the video game==
Bernadette encounters Donald who tries to get a missing part of [[Gyro Gearloose]]'s invention, the Tubal Teleport, required to take Donald back to [[Duckburg]], maliciously telling Donald that he won't get the device that easy. During battle, Donald was able to defeat her by attacking her weak spot, causing her to stumble off the large tree top while Donald gets the missing device for the Gyro's Tubal Teleport to add more power of Gyro's invention to go back to Duckburg. Afterwards, Gyro sends Donald to the Beagle Tower area to continue his adventure.

==Trivia==
*Bernadette does not appear in the handheld versions of ''Goin' Quackers!''.
