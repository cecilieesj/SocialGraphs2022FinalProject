}}'''Tanya Trunk''' is a pink female elephant from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[1992]] animated TV series ''[[Raw Toonage]]'' and spinoff from ''[[Bonkers]]''. She appeared in "[[Witless for the Prosecution]]" and "[[Get Me to the Church on Time]]" (from He's Bonkers) and briefly in "[[The Cheap Sheep Sweep]]" and "[[The Toon That Ate Hollywood]]".

==Background==
Tanya Trunk played her role of Jitters' bride in "''Get Me to the Church on Time,''" (from He's Bonkers). Judging by a few short scenes in the episodes with Miranda, Tanya is Jitters' girlfriend, but she is not embarrassed about the fact that she is twice bigger than Jitters.
