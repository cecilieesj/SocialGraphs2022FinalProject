'''Appoline''' is one of the secondary antagonists in ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]''. She is a [[France|French]] poodle as well as [[Colleen Mansfield]]'s pet.

==Appearances==
===''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]] ''===
In the beginning, Appoline is seen being accidentally covered in dirt by [[Papi]] and [[Chloe]]'s puppies. Chloe tries to tell her that they're just puppies, but she doesn't care. She has a [[France|French]] accent, but Chloe states that Appoline is actually from the Valley, although she denies it. Appoline is revealed to have won the dog show for a third year in a row. She and her owner [[Colleen Mansfield|Colleen]] are seen walking away after the conflict.Â Later, at the Beverly Hills dog show, Appoline is competing again for the fourth win. Her talent is paw-painting and makes a painting of a first-place trophy. In the end, due to Papi's lack of breeding papers, Appoline wins by default. 

Afterwards, Appoline is not seen again, but she is shown singing "[[Chihuahua]]" along with everyone else in the credits.

==Trivia==
*In the trailer, she was the only villain who was actually talking.
