|status = Active}}'''Domino''' is one of [[Dottie (102 Dalmatians)|Dottie]] and [[Dipstick]]'s puppies together with [[Oddball]] and [[Little Dipper]] in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]''. He has two black ears with rows of white spots like a set of game dice, thus earning him the name "Domino". He also has a blue (live-action)/red (cartoon) collar that has a domino hanging horizontally (live-action)/vertically (cartoon) from it. It is also worthy to note that Domino appears to have a lot of large black spots, as opposed to Little Dipper whose spots are more numerous and smaller. He is also one of the main protagonists of ''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''.


==Appearances==
===''[[102 Dalmatians]]''===
Domino first appears as a newborn puppy together with [[Oddball]] and [[Little Dipper]]. He is later seen when Oddball attempts to get "spots" from a wet black inkjet copier, after she notices that she doesn't have any spots, when she is suddenly thrown out the window, but is seen hanging from the windowsill. Domino and Little Dipper go out and try to save her, to which they succeed. He is later shown when [[Kevin Shepherd|Kevin]] and [[Chloe Simon|Chloe]] go on a date and he and his family are left watching TV. [[Jean-Pierre Le Pelt]] then kidnaps him, his siblings, and his mother. Domino is not shown for the rest of the movie, but makes a small appearance at the end of the film with Little Dipper.

===''[[102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue]]''===
Domino makes an appearance in the video game ''102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue'', which is based on the movie ''[[102 Dalmatians]]''. Domino and Oddball are the main characters of the game and have to rescue other puppies from being kidnapped by Cruella, after disobeying their parents of not getting involved. He has a red collar with an attached domino that hangs vertically.

In an early demo version of the game, he is referred to as [[Patches]]. It could either be that the game was originally intended to be set in the first generation, or (based on how Oddball has a different voice) this was supposed to be a placeholder name. Outside of Crystal the snow bunny, Domino is the only character not to be voiced by a placeholder in the demo game.

==Trivia==
*One known issue about Domino is his collar. In ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'', he is seen wearing a blue collar, whereas, in his cartoon form and merchandise, he wears a red collar. Though both collars feature a domino hanging horizontally (live-action) or vertically (cartoon) from it.
*The video game was not completely based on the live-action film, as the game features a different timeline and an entirely different plot.
**In the movie, although his brothers and sisters were dognapped, Domino is also captured.
**In the video game, Domino and [[Oddball]] were the rescuers. In the film, although [[Dottie (102 Dalmatians)|Dottie]] was captured, [[Dipstick]] was not.
*It is curious to note that in the game ''Puppies to the Rescue'', Domino and Oddball appear to have 98 brothers and sisters in addition to Little Dipper, while in the movie, it is only the three of them until Oddball rescues the other puppies from Cruella De Vil.
*Domino got his name from the pattern of spots on his ears.
*In some cliparts, Domino is seen with a spot on top of his head, but in some, there are none.
*In ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'', one of the 101 [[Dalmatian Puppies|Dalmatian puppies]] is named Domino.
