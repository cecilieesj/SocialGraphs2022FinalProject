For Wendy, she has her friends [[Lee]], [[Nate (Gravity Falls)|Nate]], [[Tambry]], and [[Thompson]] in a monster truck inviting her to do pranks. After Wendy leaves Dipper and Soos, Soos promises Dipper that "there's nothing in that world that could break him from their mission, but then Ernesto enters, introduces himself and invites him to play catch, to what Soos replies that "he's perfect" and that "even if it is all a dream, he has to play just one game, leaving Dipper alone with Mabel.

He later appears in Mabeland court when Dipper is tried for mentioning reality. When Dipper and Mabel reconcile in court, and Mabel decides to return to reality, Ernesto, along with the other imaginary creatures, turn against Mabel and chase down the twins, Wendy, and Soos to prevent them from escaping.
