'''Jormungandr''' is a character that appears in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]].

The legendary World Serpent of Norse Mythology, Jormungandr can take on the form of a humanoid snake man wrestler to give his opponents a fair fight.

==Background==
===Legend===
According to Scrooge McDuck, Jormungandr releases his tail and threatens to destroy Earth every ten years unless a mortal champion can help defeat him and his minions in combat during Ragnarök to stop the end of the Earth from occurring.

===Personality===
Jormungandr is described as the champion of Valhalla. He holds a brutal tournament to those who challenge him. Everyone cheers for him as the champion of Valhalla; however, when he mentions that he doesn't use his hands during the match, the fans turn against him for mentioning an action against the rules during wrestling.

==Role in the series==
Jormungandr appeared in the Season 3 episode "[[The Rumble for Ragnarok!]]", where he serves as Valhalla's greatest champion and the main antagonist of the episode.

Upon arriving in the arena in Valhalla, Jormungandr arrives to the arena telling the spectators that the match the fans are seeing is a best-of-three tournament where the fighters will fight against [[Scrooge McDuck]] (in his The Miser outfit) who is hated by all of Valhalla.

After a tough battle between [[Strongbeard]] and Hecka and Fenrir, Jormungandr prepares to face off against [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Dewey]] telling the crowd that Team Earth made it to the final round where they must defeat Jormungandr before the Earth is destroyed just as the fans cheer for him. During his introduction, Launchpad then explains to Huey that Jormungandr is taking on all the mortal earthlings and those who defeat Jormungandr saves the world. Jormungandr tells Scrooge that he is fed up with the richest person in the world to which [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] intervenes with him while Scrooge comforts Dewey about doing the right thing being difficult. Just as Webby keeps intervening, Jormungandr tells Webby that the warriors are not afraid to kill mortal earthlings just as [[Bentina Beakley|Mrs. Beakley]] (in a valkyrie outfit) fights him in a surprise attack and prepares to take him on. During battle, she and Webby prepare to knock him out during the tournament, to which he defeats them both. Scrooge then challenges to fight him, alongside Launchpad (in his Captain Crash alter ego), to whom he defeats both of them. Just as Jormungandr's fans cheer for him, Huey, Dewey, and Louie prepare to defeat him just as Dewey prepares to challenge him again.

During a rematch, Jormungandr tells him he is a popular, undefeatable champion during the match just as he tells Dewey he doesn't have to use his hands. Upon hearing this, Jormungandr's fans turn against him for cheating. Humiliated from all the booing crowd, Huey (with Strongbeard's strength) prepares to finish him off with his super strength to defeat him, winning against him. With Jormungandr defeated, Valhalla is saved once again, reverting him to his globe-wrapping serpent form.
