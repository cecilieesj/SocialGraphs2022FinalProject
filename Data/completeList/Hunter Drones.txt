'''Hunter Drones''' are robotic foot soldiers of [[Lord Dragaunus|Dragaunus]]. They have blasters on their hands. They are often easily destroyed by the Ducks. In "[[The Iced Ducks Cometh]]", they face off against a much larger Drone, nicknamed Tiny by [[Siege]]. [[Nosedive Flashblade|Nosedive]] destroys Tiny by crushing him with a zamboni.
