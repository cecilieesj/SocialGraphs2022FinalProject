Herbert is described to have "the best instincts in the video game industry; since he was six, he's picked the top-selling video game every year."

When Herbert tests Roger's game, while he does praise that the game has "potentially good graphics, [a] reasonably entertaining premise, the [player Dalmatian] [[Pongo|dog]] is well-conceived and the environments are engaging," he faults Roger's game for having the antagonist being a chubby dog catcher. (As he claims in the "novelization" of the film, "Am I a hero for outrunning an overweight government worker?")

He advises Roger that it's not hatred that he needs in an antagonist, but the desire to annihilate.  He then leaves to go to school to which Alan also leaves to take him there.

Herbert is last seen testing ''[[101 Dalmatians: Escape from DeVil Manor|Escape from DeVil Manor]]'', with Roger having [[Cruella De Vil|Cruella]] as the antagonist, to which he praises as an "excellent villain," which gets Roger his video game sale.
