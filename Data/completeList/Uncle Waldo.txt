|status = Active}}'''Uncle Waldo''' is a minor character and the uncle of [[Abigail and Amelia Gabble]] in Disney's [[1970]] movie ''[[The Aristocats]]''. 

==Background==

=== Personality ===
He appears to be extremely good-natured and friendly. However, he can be very loud and silly. He mentions a distaste for white wine preferring British sherry. He had a good relationship with his nieces, and gains the friendship of O'Malley, Duchess, and the kittens. Since he was never seen in a sober state, it is unknown just how much of his personality was influenced by his inebriated state.

=== Physical Appearance ===
Uncle Waldo is shown as a obese goose. He had white feathers with a buck orange beak, though he doesn't have tail feathers as shown in the film, they were taken away by a Chef, whom he was escaping from. He is also shown to wear a green (with a black stripe) top hat, though it is opened on the top.

==Appearances==
===''[[The Aristocats]]''===
Uncle Waldo first appears as [[Duchess]], [[Thomas O' Malley |O'Malley]], the kittens, and Abigail Gabble and Amelia Gabble are returning to [[Paris]]. As the group passes by a restaurant, Waldo comes flying out. The twins reveal the goose to be their uncle and immediately notice that his tail feathers are gone. Waldo leads the group to a menu on display. The menu reveals the dinner special to be "Prime Country Goose a la Provencale, stuffed with chestnuts and basted in white wine." Waldo apparently had the misfortune of being the intended meal before escaping the chef. Waldo notes that being British, he would have rather been basted in Sherry. O'Malley remarks that he must have been marinated rather than basted, as the goose is visibly drunk. Waldo then begins getting very loud, so his nieces say goodbye to the cats, and begin leading him away home to bed. As they leave, O'Malley and Duchess both note that they like him, especially when he's marinated. 

Waldo than appears at the end of the film, alongside Abigail and Amelia at the [[Bonfamille's Residence|Bonfamille Residence]], shown to be still drunk, yet he still sings alongside others the reprise of ''[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]''.

===''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''===
Uncle Waldo also made a cameo inside [[Fezziwig]]'s alongside others, clapping his hands to the beat of the music. Here, Uncle Waldo appears to be more anthropomorphized than in ''[[The Aristocats]]'', since he is actually shown wearing more clothing than just his hat, wearing a blue hat and coat, with a mint apron. 

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Uncle Waldo appears in the episode, [[Clarabelle's Big Secret|''Clarabelle's Big Secret'']]. He is shown in a photo of [[Donald Duck]],  showing a Goose Family Reunion as the duck confuses that he is more goose than duck, much to [[Clarabelle Cow]]'s interest.

==Trivia==
* Uncle Waldo was the last animated character that Bill Thompson ever voiced. Thompson died from septic shock at the young age of 58 in [[1971]], a year after ''The Aristocats'' was released.
* According to the ''House of Mouse'' episode; [[Clarabelle's Big Secret|''Clarabelle's Big Secret'']], Uncle Waldo is actually also a relative of [[Donald Duck]].
**This could be a reference to the fact that his voice actor, [[Bill Thompson]], also originally voiced Donald's uncle [[Scrooge McDuck]] in the [[1967]] animated featurette ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]].''

*In the Czech dubbed version of ''The Aristocats'', Uncle Waldo speaks with a Moravian Accent and also claims to be from Moravia. And instead of him preferring British sherry, he prefers Slivovitz.
