He is designed to reduce people, animals, enemy weapons, and technology to their primitive or prehistoric state; wrapping his tongue around the de-evolved object or victim and spanking his bottom three times will reverse the transformation. His one true place is at a wildlife park, resurrecting extinct animals for a Mesozoic zoo.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Retro is an orange, mammalian/reptilian dinosaur-like experiment with black eyes, a purple nose, tiny gold-tipped ears, gold markings on his back and gold spots around his eyes, and a dense, short tail and thick legs. His tongue is notably extendable.

===Powers and abilities===
Retro can wrap his extendable tongue around a person or object, and as he lets go, the person or object de-evolves into its primitive/prehistoric state.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 210 was the 210th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to reduce enemy weapons and technology to their primitive state, thus rendering them useless, but could also reduce people and animals to a primitive or prehistoric state. 210 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai, with 210's pod landing in a palm tree by a [[Lahui Beach|beach]].

When [[Charles and Mary|a vacationing couple]] used the beach's palm tree to catapult themselves into a nearby lake, 210's pod fell out of the tree and was accidentally splashed, activating the experiment. 210 then used his tongue to transform the couple's clothes into medieval clothes, their cell phone into a [[1930]] candlestick telephone, and their car into a [[Pre-1922#1920|1920]] station wagon.

210 later attacked a wildlife preserve, reducing some of the animals to their prehistoric state, including an elephant, tiger, and squirrel.

Eventually, 210 was captured by [[Stitch]], but the former escaped aboard a yacht and turned [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], and [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s [[Ellen and Lona|middle school friends]] into cave people.

Stitch then recaptured 210 using a tablecloth and took him back to the [[Lilo's House|Pelekais' house]] to discover how to reverse the latter's powers via [[Jumba's Computer|Jumba's computer]].

When Stitch found the answer, he muzzled 210 and took the latter back onto the yacht. There, Stitch released 210, who then turned the yacht into an Ice Age canoe. Stitch then wrapped 210's tongue around Lilo, Jumba, Pleakley, and Nani's junior high friends and spanked his bottom three times, returning the victims to their modern state.

Later, 210, christened Retro, found his one true place at the wildlife preserve turning modern animals into dinosaurs and prehistoric animals for a Mesozoic zoo.

In "[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]", Retro was oddly seen as one of the captive experiments in [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s [[Prison Asteroid K-37|prison cell]], suggesting [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] caught Retro, but this was an error. Retro was then sent back to Gantu along with all of Hämsterviel's other captive experiments after [[Woops|Experiment 600]] caused mischief and nearly blew Hämsterviel's cover to the [[UGF Troopers|prison guards]].

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
The first 624 experiments, including Retro, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Retro participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]], but it is unknown what he did. Although he was seen chasing after some of the Leroys, it is uncertain if his powers had any effect on them.

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

===''[[Stitch!]]''===
Retro made an appearance in a later episode of the ''Stitch!'' anime, along with [[Shrink]], [[Squeak]], [[Clip]], and [[Nosox]]. It is shown that when Retro's powers are used on [[Stitch]], he reverts to his original programming. This is because that was Stitch's earliest state after his creation. He also appeared in the special, ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand''.

==Trivia==
*In "[[Woops (episode)|Woops]]", Retro erroneously appeared with Gantu's other captive experiments, but he was captured by Lilo and Stitch.
*Retro's [[Experiment Pods|pod]] color is blue.
*Retro is one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
*In the ''[[Stitch!]]'' anime, Stitch reverted to his original programming while under Retro's powers, as this was Stitch's earliest state after his creation. Strangely, however, [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] was able to turn Stitch back to normal by simply reaching out to him and reminding him of his promise, as opposed to reversing the effects the usual way.
