'''Lazlo''' is the secondary antagonist of the [[2017]] [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' in the first and second season before reforming in the third season. He is [[Commander Heist]]'s (former) evil pet and sidekick. He is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

His usual goal is to help his evil master, Commander Heist steal things every time they both do something evil.

Despite being the secondary antagonist of the series, Lazlo does not appear in a lot of episodes, and for some reason, in [[Stop Lazlo!]], he gets the Smarty Hat on him and does the criminal action for himself as he plans to remove all of the hot dogs in Hot Dog Hills and to target the secret recipe even though it was supposed to be Heist's plan. As a result, Heist worked with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Goofy]] to stop him.

Lazlo usually gets defeated by getting arrested along with his owner, Heist every time they appear. However, they are somehow out of jail every time they come back.
