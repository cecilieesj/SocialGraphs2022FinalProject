The '''Spy''' is a character from ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' who appears in the episode "[[The Spy's the Limit]]".

During [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]]'s vacation at Monte Carlo, the spy pretends to be unconscious so that the duo can become spies themselves to distract Count Down while he sabotages his diabolical plan.

He is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Like many spies, this secret agent is shown to be very serious. His enemies are shown to be [[Count Down]] and his ninjas. He is also proved to be quite clever as he fakes passing out in order to get Timon and Pumbaa to distract Count Down while he sabotages his plan. By doing so, he disguises himself as one of his ninjas, that way, at the right moment, he can cause his enemy's plan to backfire.

===Physical Description===
The spy is shown to be a slender man who wears typical spy clothing, which are a white shirt covered in his tuxedo and a red bow tie. He also has straight brown hair and wears black gloves.

==Role in the series==
==="[[The Spy's the Limit]]"===
When Timon and Pumbaa arrive at Monte Carlo, they enter the casino, only to get thrown out by the owner. After Timon and Pumbaa get thrown out of the casino, the secret agent appears and fights off some ninjas. After the spy defeats the ninjas, Pumbaa makes him turn his head to realize that he forgot his brief case, which causes him to run into a wall, fall down the stairs, and lie down unconsciously.

It is now up to Timon and Pumbaa to become secret agents and finish the spy’s routines, which are to beat someone at Go Fish and stop the bad guy from doing his diabolical plan.

When Timon and Pumbaa re-enter the casino, this time with the owner letting them in as he is convinced that they are spies, they meet Count Down and play Go Fish with him. Count Down, however, wins the game and leaves to prepare for his plan. Timon and Pumbaa try to follow the man with their spy car, but are unable to control the vehicle. The car sends them flying in the air and landing on Count Down’s car, which goes to his secret lair.

Timon and Pumbaa disguise themselves as ninjas in order to not get caught, but Count Down can recognize Timon and he has the duo fight the ninjas. When Pumbaa defeats the ninjas by making them fall into a hole, the warthog falls as well, leaving Timon to stop Count Down on his own. When Timon tries to open his briefcase while confronting the villain, he accidentally pushes a button that destroys the briefcase and makes him get trapped.

Count Down explains his diabolical plan to Timon, which is to destroy the sun so that everyone would buy his electric heaters. Pumbaa then shows up in his female disguise, convincing Count Down that he would love to have some of his heat. But when Timon tries to get Pumbaa to free him, Count Down traps the warthog and he’s about to shoot the two friends. Pumbaa tells Timon that he was right when he told him that getting involved in the spy business was a bad idea, making Timon admit his mistake.

Suddenly, one of Count Down’s ninjas reveals to be the secret agent from earlier and he stops Count Down from destroying the sun and shooting Timon and Pumbaa. After Count Down gets defeated, the spy tells Timon and Pumbaa that he was pretending to be unconscious so that they can distract his enemy while he sabotages his HQ. Pumbaa then realizes that Timon was right about getting involved in the spy business after all, even though the meerkat didn’t know what he was doing. But then, Timon accidentally pushes a button that destroys the Earth, making Pumbaa tell his friend that it would hurt to know what he is doing.
