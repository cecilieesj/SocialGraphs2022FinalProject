'''Rongo the Strongo''' is the circus' strongman in the [[2019]] remake of ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''. Besides his duty, he also serves as [[Ringmaster|Max Medici]]'s bank accountant who helps him throughout his career in order to keep his show running.

==Role in the film==
Rongo is introduced as as the circus' strongman just as he and the other performers help build the tent. They later gaze upon the birth of [[Dumbo (character)|Jumbo Junior]] in awe. Throughout the film, he is one of the performers who appear in the freak show section when Max calls him over to the stage. During the act, he serves as the drummer while [[Puck (Dumbo)|Puck]] serves as his fellow musician. Later after the tent collapses due to [[Mrs. Jumbo]]'s rampage across it, Rongo and the rest of the survivors escape the circus.

Furthermore, Rongo and the other performers travel to an amusement park in [[Arkansas]] called Dreamland as Dumbo's act was a success. After it is found out that Vandevere Enterprises has fired all the performers, [[Holt Farrier|Holt]], his children, [[Joe Farrier|Joe]] and [[Milly Farrier|Milly]], and the performers plan to rescue Dumbo by releasing him into the wild alongside Mrs. Jumbo. Rongo plays an important role in arriving at [[Nightmare Island]] which he and the other performers barge into by using his strength to open the bars just as the performers take the transport vehicle with Mrs. Jumbo inside just before the park owner, [[V.A. Vandevere]], and his guards try to stop the circus troupe. Later, Rongo, Joe, Milly, and the rest of the performers spend their last moments with Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo before they get released into the wild.

Later when the circus is re-established as Medici Family Circus, Rongo retains his duty as the strongman.
