==Character History==
Graham was first introduced when he wanted Ellen and Gracie on his show. When family came, Avery, Tyler, Chloe, and Stan need to keep Gracie's ability to speak secret, so they mess up the show with their usual talents, Bennett also, unknowingly, helped by hoping his book sales would go up.

When Graham announced that him and his employees would be out of a job, Leslie was happy they would be together, however, Graham was joking about them being fired.

Graham was introduced again when he was hosting the 87th Hollywood Entertainment Awards. When the James-Jennings family formed a plan by having Stan's secret exposed, he would become famous and no one would ever experiment of him ever again.

At the show, the family need to wait until the right time for Stan to go on stage, but Stan does it now. He asked Graham what is the difference between sound editing and sound mixing.

While he was answering that sound editing is more placement of sound, while mixing is more adjusting until he realized that a dog was talking.

When Stan, his puppies, and his family do a performance about his secret to talk, his blog, and his puppies talking, Graham was impress and asked how he does it, to which he replies years of training with some of the finest vocal coaches in the world, which he later admits he's joking and admits he's ''really'' a talking dog.

With Stan being a celebrity, he doesn't have to worry about being experimented on ever again. In his blog, the next year, he was back at the Hollywood Entertainment Awards as a nominee. Graham was nominating Stan for "Best Talking Dog" as he stars in "The Bells of Portugal".
