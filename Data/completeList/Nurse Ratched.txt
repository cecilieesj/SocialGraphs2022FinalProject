'''Nurse Ratched''', also known as the '''Severe Nurse''', is a recurring character on ''[[Once Upon a Time]]Â ''and'' Ratched''

==Biography==
The nurse is in charge of the psychiatric ward in the hospital, keeping a close eye on visitor traffic. [[The Evil Queen|Regina]] gives her a rose upon her visit to see a patient, and the nurse informs her no one has come to visit "[[Belle]]" that day.
She is approached by [[Mad Hatter|Jefferson]], who pretends to be part of the hospital staff, when he goes down to the psychiatric ward. He informs the nurse that all the commotion upstairs is about a boy whose heart is failing. The tea he gives her is drugged, and after taking a sip, she promptly passes out at the front desk. This gives Jefferson the opportunity to take the keys to the rooms, and free Belle.
After the Dark Curse is broken she regains her memories as does everyone else in town.

After the Curse, [[Little Red Riding Hood|Ruby]] visits Belle in the hospital after she loses her memory of the Enchanted Forest. The nurse must sedate Belle after she becomes aggravated and tells Ruby that she must be sedated often due to her condition.
When [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]] discovers that Belle is missing from her hospital bed, he calls the nurse in and asks where she is. The nurse replies that Belle should still be here, to which Gold angrily and impatiently asks where she is, causing the nurse to go and check.
