'''Lord Angstrom''' is a character from ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]''. He exhibits nothing but contempt and a pompous air around "out-worlders", and he is only amongst them to relay a message to Mira Nova that she is soon to be wed.

It is soon revealed that he is merely using the wedding as a distraction so he can attack the palace with the help of a Tangean Grounder gang, as he wishes to usurp the throne from King Nova. Fortunately, Team Lightyear arrives in time to stop him, and Fop Doppler drops a chandelier on him when he attempts to escape.

At the end of the episode, Angstrom is seen arrested and taken away for his crimes.

In the episode "[[Good Ol' Buzz]]", Lord Angstrom is seen yet again fresh out of prison. This time, he has his sights set on Mira, only to realize that by the older version of Buzz being there, Mira is oddly absent due to his time-meddling. Lord Angstrom is soon rounded up again, and taken into custody by [[Star Command]].
