[[File:Gremlins-disney-dahl.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''The Gremlins''' are characters created by Disney and Roald Dahl for a film project in the 1940s that never saw production. However, they would still see light in the form of military insignia, a Disney illustrated storybook of Roald Dahl's original story and various comic book appearances throughout the war. Since then, the Gremlins have appeared in the [[2008]] ''[[Return of the Gremlins]]'' comic book miniseries from Dark Horse comics, a reprint of the original storybook and the ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' video games.

==Video game appearances==

=== [[Epic Mickey]] ===
[[Gremlin Gus]] is the leader of the Gremlins and serves as a guide for [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]. Almost like [[Jiminy Cricket]] from ''[[Pinocchio]]'', he is the one that tells the player all the basic controls and how to execute actions.

In the beginning of the game, Gus rescues Mickey from the maniacal [[Mechanical Arm]] in the [[The Mad Doctor (character)|Mad Doctor's]] Lab in [[Dark Beauty Castle]]. The Gremlins reside in [[Gremlin Village]], which resembles the [[It's a Small World]] attraction.

Throughout the game, 30 caged Gremlins can be spotted. Mickey can either help or abandon them.

If Mickey frees all 30 caged Gremlins, Gus will give Mickey the Gremlin Guardian Pin inside the [[Shadow Blot|Blot]]. For information on the caged Gremlins, see [[Gremlin Cage]].

===[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]===
The Gremlins, including [[Gremlin Gus]], return in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''. They play larger roles than in the first game. Caged Gremlins also reappear some with electrical force fields around them that [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] needs to turn off before [[Mickey]] can spin attack to break them open and free them.
