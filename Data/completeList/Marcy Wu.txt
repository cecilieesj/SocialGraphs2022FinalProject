'''Marcy Wu''' is a major character in the [[2019]] television series ''[[Amphibia]]''. She is a young Taiwanese-American teenage girl<ref>https://medium.com/@darya.png/matt-braly-on-amphibia-culture-and-alienation-the-metaphorical-and-fantastical-6887b1d527e8</ref> and the childhood best friend of [[Anne Boonchuy]] and [[Sasha Waybright]]. 

When the three are teleported to the world of [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] through the magic of a [[Calamity Box|music box]], Marcy lands in [[Newtopia]] where her intelligence and ingenuity catches the attention of [[King Andrias]] and his people. 

Marcy soon becomes the king's advisor, and an unknowing pawn in his plans for invading the world. After Andrias' treachery was revealed, Marcy became a host for [[the Core]]. She represents the emerald of intelligence on the [[Calamity Box]].

==Background==
Marcy is close friends with Anne and Sasha and serves as the brains of the trio, is an expert gamer, and has many clumsy moments that Anne and Sasha have to counter. She learned of a [[Calamity Box|mysterious chest]] located in some store that she, Anne, and Sasha stole it from and was alongside them when Anne opens it, which sends her, Sasha, and herself to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]]. Upon arrival in Amphibia and being found by the inhabitants of Newtopia, Marcy serves Andrias as his close aide and chief ranger of the Newtopian Knight Guard, unaware that he is secretly plotting a mysterious agenda involving her and her friends.

After the failed toad invasion, it was revealed that Marcy was the one who discovered the [[Calamity Box]] and informed [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] about it with knowledge about its power before it sent her, [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and Sasha to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]], making her the responsible one for sending the three girls to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]]. Marcy later turned against [[King Andrias|Andrias]] and assisted [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] in the battle for the [[Calamity Box]], but in the process, [[King Andrias|Andrias]] impaled Marcy with his sword, though not before she dropped the charged up music box, which sent [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and the Planters to Earth.

Following this, and during [[King Andrias|Andrias]]' invasion plan of Earth, Marcy remained in a comatose state of recuperation to heal her injuries. She was freed by [[Lady Olivia]] and [[General Yunan|Yunan]], but their efforts to rebel are ultimately in vain when Andrias captures them, and Marcy becomes the unwilling host of the Newtopian artificial intelligence and the true master of Amphibia, [[the Core]].

===Personality===
[[File:New Wartwood-Marcy's Inquisitive Nature.png|left|thumb|250px|Marcy's inquisitive nature.]]
Marcy is an intelligent young female, and is often seen researching things and taking notes. She is curious and takes interest in culture, being the one who discovered the Calamity Box. Marcy is also cunning and resourceful. In addition, Marcy is a good listener as she listens to her friends about their problems and offers them advice or comfort for whatever is bothering them. Marcy has shown to be a peacemaker as she tried to smooth out arguments between her friends, especially Anne and Sasha. Also, Marcy is very clumsy, but she generally remains forgetful and unbothered by it. Back on earth, Marcy was somewhat dependent on her friends, as she constantly relied on Anne to look out for her, and was used to having Sasha make decisions for her. Ever since she came to Amphibia, however, she has learned to take care of herself better, and make her own decisions without many people's influence. Despite this, both she and Anne are still often affected by Sasha's influence.

She loves video games, research, and puzzles. Marcy is also a highly energetic, adorable, cute and bubbly person, and gets easily excited about anything that interests her. Even things such as seeds, history, and other things girls her age normally wouldn't be interested in will cause her to talk nonstop. While people like [[Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger]] would view her as a weirdo because of her quirky personality, this would lead to her becoming friends with [[Maddie Flour]], as well as training as Maddie's apprentice in the magical arts. Despite her intelligence, Marcy is also a very naive person, as she's quick to trust the people around her and take them at their word, a trait that allows people like her friend Sasha, [[Captain Grime]], [[Mayor Toadstool]], and King Andrias to use her to their advantage. After Sasha revealed that she played her and Anne just to put Grime's invasion plan into motion, Marcy was shocked by her betrayal. She also refused to side with her because of her actions, and now sees how controlling she can be. Also, when King Andrias revealed his true nature once he's been given the Calamity Box, Marcy was horrified to discover she had been used by a genocidal maniac.

[[File:Anne Sprig Polly & Sasha laughing under the covers.jpg|thumb|250px|Marcy with Anne, Sprig, and Polly in a Slumber party.]]
Marcy cares about Anne and Sasha greatly, as she missed them when they were separated in Amphibia. However, upon reuniting with Anne and Sasha at different times, Marcy was happy to see them again and was relieved that they were okay, which shows that she was concerned about them. Also, Marcy cares about her other friends as she would do anything to help them, just like she would for Anne and Sasha. In addition, Marcy tries her best to make her friends happy, as shown in "[[A Day at the Aquarium]]", when she encouraged Anne to go with the Plantars instead of staying with her in Newtopia. Marcy also easily forgives her friends whenever they make a mistake as she would mostly see the good side of their intentions over the bad.

In "[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]", it is revealed Marcy has fears of loneliness and is insecure about being separated from her friends. On Anne's birthday, when she was informed by her family they would be moving to a new state, Marcy was heartbroken as she knew she had to leave her friends behind. When Marcy discovered the Calamity Box and its mystical powers, she revealed its existence to her friends, so they would use it to go on adventures together, despite not believing the box to actually have powers. It is also implied that the relationship she has with her family is strained, as she rarely talked about them to anyone except for Andrias or didn't even seem to miss them even once during her time in Amphibia. Marcy doesn't even appear to be bothered by the idea of never seeing her parents again.

[[File:Amphibia Marcy tries to justify herself.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Marcy tries to justify her actions.]]
On a related topic, Marcy also has shown to have a selfish side, as she always wanted her friends to like her interest, although she does want to share her dream of going on an adventure with her. However, after finding out that she and her family were moving away, Marcy had reach her breaking point as told her parents that they were ruining her life, especially her dream of going on an adventures with her friends. Although, upon discovering the Calamity Box, Marcy decided to run away from her parents and fulfill her dream of going on an adventure with friends by going to a new world as she tricked Anne and Sasha into stealing it. In addition, Marcy wasn't considering how Anne and Sasha would feel about it, as she only thought about what she wanted instead of what her friends wanted.

Upon arriving in Amphibia, Marcy decided to not tell Anne and Sasha about the move as she wanted to stay together forever. However, after King Andrias revealed that she sent her friends to Amphibia on purpose, Marcy tried to justify her actions, saying she helped her friends grow as people and Anne forming a friendship with Sprig. However, upon seeing her friends old and new being disgusted with her actions, Marcy not only realizes that her actions cost Anne and Sasha's trust in her, but also sees how selfish she was to them for taking them away from their lives back home. Filled with remorse, Marcy decided to make amends for her actions by helping her friends fight King Andrias, save Sprig from danger and use the Calamity Box to send everyone back home. Unfortunately, Marcy gets stabbed by Andrias as she accepts her fate and showed her remorse by apologizing to Anne for everything she has done before succumbing to her wounds.

Although her efforts in making amends for her actions helped Anne escape back to Earth and Sasha to Wartwood, Marcy thinks that it wasn't enough to show her friends how truly sorry she was for everything she has done, as she believed that it was going to take a lot more to win their trust back in her. Marcy also fears that Anne and Sasha won't forgive her or want to be her friend anymore.

While being possessed by the Core and had some parts of her memory erased, Marcy reverted back on her desire to have an adventure with her friends. However, after remembering what happen between her friends and realizing that the fantasy world she was in wasn't real, Marcy realized the mistakes she has made and was through running away. Once she was set free from the Core, Marcy apologizes to Anne and Sasha for everything she has done and told her about her fears of losing them. However, Marcy was assured by Anne and Sasha that they'll always be friends no matter where they were. Also, Marcy accepts the fact that she and her family were moving away, which suggests that she worked things out with her parents and reconciled with them. It is also implied that Marcy has learned not to take her family for granted and must always put them first and suggests that she apologized to her parents for her selfishness and for throwing a tantrum before running away.

==Role in the series==
===Before===
Back on earth, Marcy hung out with her two friends [[Anne Boonchuy|Anne]] and [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] all the time. She was a top student, but was so clumsy that Anne had constantly to look out for her, also she was used to having Sasha coming up with what to do. At some point, the 3 girls started a band called "Sasha and the Sharps".

[[File:True Colors-00118.png|thumb|250px|Marcy discovers the book that contain information of the Calamity Box.]]
On Anne's 13th birthday, Marcy was at the library when she discovered a book that contained info about the [[Calamity Box]], a mysterious music box with the power to travel to other worlds. Marcy's father texted her to come home as they needed to talk, and decided to head over there before meeting up with her friends. However, Marcy was told by her parents that they are moving because her dad got a new job out of state. Hearing this news, Marcy ran away in tears as she believes that her life was ruined because she would be separated from Anne and Sasha. When Marcy stopped at a thrift shop, she saw the very same box she just learned about and came up with an idea out of desperation; if the box was really magic, she, Anne and Sasha could go to a new world where they could have amazing adventures and be together forever. Marcy sent a picture of the Calamity Box to Sasha, then the three friends meet at the thrift shop. Once Sasha pressured Anne into stealing the box, the three friends went to a park to examine it. As soon as the box was opened, the human girls were transported to the world of [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]], but were separated. The part of Amphibia Marcy was sent to was the capital [[Newtopia]] where she met [[King Andrias|Andrias Leviathan]] the king of Amphibia himself who convinced her to let him help her find a way home and find her friends. [[Lady Olivia]] took her to a balcony that shows the young human girl a magnificent view as she explains how her family have cared for the land for generations; Marcy who is grateful to the Newts for taking her in and helping her promises to do her part and help them however she can. After doing some work for the newts, she eventually became the chief ranger of the Newtopian knight guard.

===Season One===
Marcy only appeared in photos and a non-speaking role in a flashback and was mentioned a few times.

===Season Two===
[[File:Marcy reunites with Anne Amphibia S2E06.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Marcy and Anne happily reunited.]]
During the Barbari-Ant Invasion, she was happily reunited with Anne when she came to Newtopia in hopes of finding a way home. After hugging (and putting out Marcy's cape that somehow caught fire), Anne introduced her to the Plantars. Marcy then excitedly introduces herself to the family, as she even deduces that they're from Frog Valley, judging from [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]]'s skull cranium and soil attached to him. This amazed Hop Pop and easily won him over by complimenting Hop Pop on his status as a farmer. Then Marcy begins to examine [[Polly Plantar|Polly]], as she points out to her that her legs will likely grow out of her in two months, which excited Polly and won her over. Marcy then introduces herself to [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]], but Sprig instead greets her with a skepticism, because of his discontent with trusting Marcy due to his family's previous battle against Sasha and her toad army. When Anne asks about where she's been, Marcy informs her that she had actually warped right inside the city of Newtopia. She managed to become well acquainted with them after realizing the newts were similar to a race known as "sephilons" she learned about while playing a video game known as Creatures and Caverns.

Anne asks Marcy for a way inside Newtopia, but unfortunately she can't let them in until the ants are dealt with, but luckily, she has a plan and leads them away. At a nearby tent, Marcy enters the tent and introduces the newts to Anne and the Plantars. While the newts admit they haven't agreed yet on a specific plan, Marcy assures them she has a plan of her own. She then proceeds to state the plan, which is to sneak into the hills of the ants and drive the queen away from their lair to force the rest of them to retreat with her. When Sprig questions how they'll manage to pull that off, Marcy shows everyone a belt equipped with stinkshrooms, that will let out toxic pheromones which are capable of driving the ants away. Anne then begins to point out the dangers of the mission, especially when knowing they'll inevitably have to fight through some of the colony to get to the queen. This leads Anne to suggesting she and the Plantars take care of the mission instead, due to her experiences in dealing with stuff like this in Frog Valley and was well aware of Marcy's clumsiness. Marcy assures Anne that she'll be fine (Just as Anne points out her burning cape again). Marcy, Anne and the Planter's then enter the Barbari-Ant colony where they are ambushed. Ignoring Anne telling to stay behind them, Marcy notices a plant and begins analyzing it, mixing it with chemicals in a beaker of which she had brought with her; this creates an explosive formula, allowing everyone to escape when Marcy throws it and blowing a hole in the wall. Once through, Marcy throws an insta-vine potion, which automatically begins growing vines in front of the wall to keep any more ants from chasing after them. Unbeknownst to her, Marcy had accidentally trapped Polly on the other side after realizing she never made it through the hole, causing everyone to rip apart the vines to let her through. Luckily, Marcy manages to throw another insta-vine potion at the wall just before the ants arrive again. They finally reach the queen in the egg chamber where they start planting stinkshrooms, with Marcy telling them that they would start releasing their pheromones 5 minutes after they are planted, so they would need to work quickly. As everyone begins getting to work, Anne soon pushes Marcy out of the way from a nearby falling rock, as they manage to stay out of sight from the queen by hiding behind the rock itself. Marcy then states she was about to move out of the way on her own, but Anne disagrees, believing she needs to make sure Marcy stays out of danger just like back home. Marcy reminds Anne that they're not back home right now, and she's managed to take care of herself up until now. It was then Sprig lets out a scream after a nearby egg hatches and the larva lunges towards his face, causing him to alert the queen. The Queen then lunges at Sprig and eats him whole, before screeching and calling even more ants to arrive. Marcy then points out that Sprig is still alive since ants take longer periods of time to digest their food, as she then proceeds to go save him, but Anne stops her once more. Anne asks her to stay put and that she could save Sprig instead, but Marcy reminds her that she's the most knowledgeable with Barbari-Ant biology and therefore most fit for the job. Anne continues to be persistent while believing she can still do it in her place. Marcy then demands to know why she won't let her do it, to which Anne then tearfully admits she had just got her back, and she doesn't want to lose her again. Marcy then promises Anne she can do it, as she proceeds to bounce her way towards the queen on the ants' backs, knowing they have bouncy bodies from her research. Once Marcy is also eaten by the queen, she manages to make her throw up both her and Sprig, with Marcy now having gained Sprig's trust. Marcy then shoots an arrow at a nearby rock to swing them safely to the ground, but the queen instantly slices the rope, causing them to crash to the ground as they're once again surrounded by the ants. It was then the stinkshrooms begin to go off in the nick of time, causing the queen and the rest of the ants to flee from the group as they tunnel away from Newtopian grounds.

[[File:Amphibia Anne and Marcy's vow.jpg|thumb|250px|Marcy and Anne vow to find Sasha then a way home.]]
As they group leaves, Marcy thanks Anne for having her back, but Anne is now convinced she really has changed (Then Hop Pop and Polly point out that once again her cape's on fire). Once the group is out of the cave, Sprig apologizes to Marcy for his prior suspicions of her. Marcy is just glad he's okay since she could tell that he means a lot to Anne and the two start to bond. The gates of Newtopia are finally open again as Marcy shows Anne and the Planters in. After reporting to [[Lady Olivia]] that the mission was a success and introduces her to Anne and the Planter's. Marcy has a word alone with Anne and then suggests they go find Sasha, but Anne informs her that she already had, only they had fight with swords and explosions, and now she's unsure of her current location. Marcy states that even if they found a way home, it would all be for nothing if Sasha wasn't with them. She also admits she's unsure of what to do since Sasha was always the one who came up with the decisions. Anne then suggests they should now begin making their own decisions, with her and Marcy agreeing with her because it has works out so for them. Both then declared to each other that together they'll find Sasha and find a way home. Anne then proceeds to tell Marcy everything that happen to her since coming to Amphibia.

Marcy took her friends to a burger joint where she continued to impress the Planters with how smart she is while Anne shows how silly she is. They then receive a note from the king via an arrow. Rather than giving a direct message gave them a scavenger hunt were when all the clues are gathered it reveal a hidden message. As Marcy uncovered the first 2 clues Anne feels more and more insecure about her own intelligence. After escaping a sewer gator Sprig accidentally reveals that Anne is jealous about how smart she is, Marcy reveals that she is jealous of Anne because how social she can be. Anne then discovers the third and final clue; the full message reads "Bring Me The Plantars".

Marcy brings Anne and the Planters to the [[Newtopia Castle|castle]] and presents them to before Andrias Leviathan, king of Amphibia. When Anne showed a picture of the music box, Andrias notices that the gems are gray rather than colored like they were previously. In order to learn more of the box and find the way home, Marcy must do some research in the archives. During her research with King Andrias she accidentally spills coffee on a tapestry, but discovers a button that opens a secret passage leading to a secret wing of the archives that had vital information.

The night before King Andrias would tell what their research uncovered, Marcy decides to have a sleepover with Anne, Sprig and Polly. Anne and Marcy realize that they never had a sleepover without Sasha as she is the "Queen of Sleepovers", but know that they have had enough experience to throw one for Sprig and Polly. They declare the sleepover mantra "Pajamas, junk food and gossip galore, pillow fights, movies and tearing up the dance floor and listen up cus' this I won't repeat; never ever go to sleep". They all proceed to run amok throughout the castle; upsetting Lady Olivia who tells them to never go into the basement. As the gang relax, they realize that it is only 9:00 pm and Anne insists that they do a Scare Dare Challenge with the loser's name going into the Book of Losers forever. Against Lady Olivia's warning, Anne suggests they head down into the basement. The kids sneak passed Lady Olivia, whom Polly draws on, and head down with them all refusing to turn back, lest their name end up in the Book of Losers. They enter a hallway full of mirrors and find a blocked doorway with a sign in ancient Newtonian runes saying that everyone correctly assumes that it's saying something like "Keep Out". They break it open anyway and find themselves in a flooded room full of coffins. Anne and Marcy try to prove their bravery by going to one of the coffins and taking a selfie, upon which [[Shadowfish|jellyfish/ghost-like creatures]] emerge. They immediately deduce that they are deadly and flee the coffin room together. Along the way, Marcy notices a room full of growing plants that do not need sunlight, and Sprig takes note of a destroyed painting of what looks like King Andrias with 2 other individuals; a [[Unknown Female Frog|frog]] and a [[Unknown Toad Warrior|toad]]. The gang find a trap door that immediately enters Marcy's room, much to Marcy's surprise and confusion, but the ghosts phase in any way. They quickly discover that holding a mirror up to them makes them solid and push them back into the basement. The kids refuse to go to sleep and stay awake until morning. After wondering so many questions, they agree that the sleepover was great and all four of them add their names to the book. Anne and Marcy reveal that they have added their names numerous times and that Sasha always won. When Anne states that she needs to make up with Sasha, Marcy comforts her and assures they will find her. Lady Olivia angrily enters to tell them that their meeting with King Andrias is soon.

[[File:King Andrias' Book.png|thumb|left|250px|King Andrias shows everyone a book with information on the music box.]]
The human girls and the Planters arrive in the throne room where King Andrias showed them a book that tells them that the 3 gems on the music box need to be recharged. In order to do that, one must go to three separate temples to have each gem charged up, but the book only gives information on one of them. Hop Pop wants to get back to [[Wartwood Swamp|Wartwood]] as soon as possible so as not to miss the annual harvest. Anne suggests going back to pick up the music box and meet back up with Marcy at the first temple. However, Marcy suggests that Anne stay with her in Newtopia as them separating is the last thing they should do. Anne and the Plantars are visibly saddened by this logic, and Marcy suggests that they spend the day to themselves before they leave. The next morning, Anne says goodbye to the Plantars as they head back to Wartwood. Seeing how sad Anne is, Marcy admits that sending a servant to retrieve the music box might not be a good idea and that someone trusted should go. Anne hugs her and runs off to meet with her surrogate frog family. Once Anne has left, King Andrias comes up to Marcy with a proposition he believes would be very interesting to her. The king promised Marcy to take her and her human friends with her to other worlds with him and go and even more incredible adventures and she and her friends would never be apart; all she had to do was bring the Calamity Box back to Newtopia and give it to him once it was recharged. Not knowing Leviathan's true motives, Marcy agreed.

[[File:The First Temple-00907.png|thumb|250px|Marcy falls in love with the Plantars' home.]]
Marcy arrives on her avian transport Joe Sparrow, who announces that she has information on the first temple. They must venture to recharge the first of the box’s gem (while temporally get distracted on how "rustic and cute" the Planter farm is). She explains that the temple is full of deadly traps and that no one has been able to surpass them. This actually excites Marcy, but Anne tells her that she has a habit of getting "lost in the zone" and tunes out everything else, much to her safety. Marcy brushes this aside as they arrive at the temple, via her sparrow steed. The group end up in a large cube shaped room where Anne discovers what looks like a puzzle cube. Upon holding it, the barer gets encompassed in a magnetic bubble. She gives the box to Marcy, who uses it to solve the puzzle. However, whenever she messes with it, it causes the room to turn and alter, harming Anne and the Plantars. Marcy manages to solve it and the door opens up, with Marcy excitedly rushing into the next room and disregarding her friends' wellbeing. The next room has a floor of colored tiles. The group quickly learn that the pink tiles are fire traps and blue tiles are spike traps. The green tiles are safe, but there are only two of them. Marcy jumps onto one and beckons someone else to hop on the other. Anne and Hop Pop both calmly argue with one another about who should jump on the green tile. While Hop Pop claims he should do it to redeem harming Anne, Anne feels she should do it as Hop Pop has suffered enough. Anne forcibly does so and manages to land on the tile, opening the door to the next room. Anne and Hop Pop continue arguing up until the next room, which contains a chess-like game called flip wart. Marcy just so happens to be an expert at the game, but upon setting up the pieces, Polly falls through the floor and ends up as the actual flip wart piece on a bigger board. Realizing that they are to be the actual pieces, Sprig and Hop Pop are also transferred to the big board while Anne is transferred to the opposing side, much to everyone's shock. Marcy uses her skills to try to avoid harming her friends, but the game cheats and Anne ends up harming Hop Pop. As Anne unwillingly chases Hop Pop across the board, Anne finally breaks down. She is not mad at Hop Pop anymore, but wants to have time to herself. Hop Pop understands, telling her to take as much time as she needs. Realizing that she has put her friends in danger, Marcy tries to forfeit and rushes the board before using Sprig as a projectile and destroying her own piece, ending the game. Marcy believes that she has lost her chance at recharging the gem. The temple leads them out with glowing green arrows. However, the group discover that the arrows are leading them to the outhouse. It turns out that the outhouse is actually the recharging station and that Marcy learning humility was the test. Marcy places the gem on the pedestal and the green energy is recharged into it (with the green also draining from Marcy's eyes as she loses her connection with it). The gem proceeds to point them in the next direction as the group plan to take a break for the time being before heading to their destination.

[[File:Wartwood Strating to warm up to Marcy.png|thumb|left|250px|Marcy being warmed up to by the Wartwood citizens.]]
Marcy is excited to be living among the citizens of Wartwood and get firsthand experience being among farming natives. However, the townsfolk, in their usual manner, do not take kindly to Marcy's appearance, leaving her feeling dejected. Anne comes to comfort her and tries to explain that it takes time for people to accept outsiders in Wartwood. Marcy believes that she needs "strategy" to get the people to accept her, but in her epiphany ends up knocking over the statue of the town's founder. The townsfolk are angry, but Marcy uses her science skills to fix and clean the statue, much to everyone's astonishment. Marcy decides to use her ways to improve the town, having done so with Newtopia. Anne shows Marcy all the problems with the town such as potholes, out of date streetlamps and broken fences. Despite all of this, the townsfolk still do not like Marcy all that much. When she wishes to do something bigger, [[Mayor Toadstool]] approaches her with numerous plans that he has to make the town look better. Anne prevents Marcy from taking any of them, as she knows that Toadstool's plans tend to go awry. However, in the middle of the night, Marcy, too excited to sleep, decides to take up Toadstool's plans to expand the town's appearance. The town looks brighter and cleaner, though a lot of it is just coatings over the preexisting buildings, as the Wartwood enjoys its appearance. Suddenly, the ground begins to give way as Wartwood was built over a swamp and the weight of the additions is causing it to sink. Anne once again tells Marcy that she should have been patient with the people, and she calls upon Joe Sparrow to take all the unnecessary buildings and toss them away. The town rises and the citizens criticize Marcy for her careless actions. However, they add that she acted impulsively just like Anne did when she first arrived and tell her that one day they will approve of her, much to her delight. Marcy then proceeds to rapidly rebuild all the buildings, with Anne claiming she is indeed on a level of her own.

[[File:Maddie and Marcy bonding.png|thumb|250px|Marcy and Maddie bonding over their shared interest in magic.]]
After shopping for seeds with Hop Pop, Marcy was awestruck with amazement when she gazed upon [[Frobo]], a mysterious robot that was befriended and named by Polly. Marcy began to examine it, after the Planters took the robotic frog in. While researching the flora and fauna, Marcy sees [[Maddie Flour|Maddie]] restoring a tree to its former glory and scolds her sisters [[Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger]] for their upheaval. Marcy introduces herself after they depart and shows an interest in learning spells as well. Maddie is enthralled by Marcy's passion, and the two head out to collect charms, much to the tadpoles' displeasure. Maddie tells Marcy that she used to play with her siblings all the time before she found her interest in magic, and now has little time to play for them. Marcy advises her to allow time, but Maddie considers her work to be more significant. While Marcy bonds with Maddie, Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger become jealous of her and decide that they need to be older in order for Maddie to play with them again. They steal her spell book and cast a spell in the morning, but Maddie chastises them for scribbling in her book. Despite this, the tadpoles feel they have finished the spell they need to use. Maddie and Marcy are successful in resurrecting Fleafy, but their triumph is short-lived due to the arrival of Rosemary, Lavender, and Ginger, who have risen to be giants. The three ends up causing mayhem all over town. Maddie realizes that they haven't mastered the growth spell and that they made their decision based on her advice to "grow up." Maddie, now that she realizes she's to blame for the crisis, has Marcy work on a cure as she grows to giant proportions to settle them down after they learn they can't stop rising. Maddie juggles her sisters as Marcy administers the cure to them. Maddie then apologizes to her sisters for not being a proper sister, taking Marcy's advice.

When they came to the second temple, they encountered Valeriana who was part of an ancient order, whose purpose was to study the gems and the box itself. After Anne completed the trials, Valeriana charges the stone, but Anne hears her friends screaming, thinking they're in danger and leaves. Anne found them, but they were actually fine and were instead watching cute animal videos. Marcy left with the group back to Wartwood not knowing the stone was not fully charged.

Before setting off to the third and final temple, Marcy pointed out that Anne that her clothes were worn down and needed new gear, so she called for Newtopian armorer Bernardo. After [[Bessie (Amphibia)|Bessie]] saved everyone from being blowing up, Anne finally got a new look, with it being just a chest plate over her old clothes, because she was finally feeling content with who she is. Sprig, Marcy and Bernardo approved Anne's decision, although Marcy thought Anne would look cute with a new hairstyle, much to Anne's chagrin.

When they reached the third temple, Marcy, Anne and the Plantars soon realized that the temple's trails were all about strength. They are rescued by Sasha, who tracked them down with [[Captain Grime|Grime]]. Marcy was happy to see Sasha and hugged her as they complimented each other's new outfits. Unlike Anne and the Planters, she was happy to let Sasha help them as she told about their quest to recharge the gems. They reached the final trail which was a giant rock monster with the power to increase the gravity around it; Marcy was rendered helpless because of the intense gravitational pull, but she watched Sasha defeated the stone guardian. When Sasha recharged the gem and Anne suggested opening it, Marcy stopped them and suggested that they should wait and bring it to King Andrias, so they could know how to use it properly. Unbeknownst to Marcy, Anne, and the Planters were right to be suspicious, because Sasha's change of heart turned out to be an act as she and Grime plan on invading Newtopia and are using them to get into the city.

[[File:Amphibia The Dinner at The Dinner.png|thumb|250px|Marcy at dinner with friends both old and new.]]
Marcy was at the Planters' farm when they invited Sasha and Grime over for dinner. It started out good, but soon went from awkward to a heated argument between Anne and Sasha. Marcy tried to remind them of their friendship; it was then that the desert grime bought over started destroying everything. After everyone was saved, she watched with tears of joy as her 2 best friends reconcile and then everyone enjoyed chocolate covered hornets. The human girls reformed their band "Sasha and the Sharps" to perform in Wartwood's Battle of the Bands; after a few hiccups, they managed to put on an amazing performance that the audience just loved. After the contest (where Grime won thanks to his 3-hour harp solo) Anne suggests taking a group photo before she, Marcy, and Sasha leave for home, to which everyone in Wartwood joins in.

[[File:Heroes of Amphibia.png|thumb|left|250px|Heroes of Amphibia.]]
The 3 human girls, The Planter family, Grime and Frobo all arrived at the gates of Newtopia on Joe Sparrow. Marcy asked Sasha and Grime to keep their hoods up before they gave the music box to King Andrias, so she can put in a good word for them and clear them of any crimes. However, just as Anne was about to hand it over, Sasha and Grime made their move and took the king hostage and gave the signal for their hidden toad soldiers to cause riots all over the city. Marcy tried to end the hostilities peacefully, but to no avail. Marcy, Anne, the Planters, Frobo, and Lady Olivia were being escorted to the dungeon when they were rescued by [[General Yunan]]. After the gang regrouped, Marcy looked through her telescope and estimated that the rest of the Toad Army was less than an hour away from Newtopia and once they got there the city would be completely overrun. Anne gave a motivational speech that inspired everyone to fight back, and then Anne gave everyone the plan to stop the rebellion. Marcy, Olivia, and Hop Pop would rescue King Andrias from the dungeon, Polly, Yunan, and Frobo would attack the Toads head on to distract them while Anne and Sprig would close the gate preventing the invading toad army entrance.

[[File:Marcy's apology.png|thumb|250px|Marcy apologizes before she succumbs to her wound inflicted by King Andrias.]]
After the mission was successful and Anne and Sprig defeated Sasha and Grime, Anne gave the box to Andrias who then revealed his true malicious intentions; he used the box to power his castle, allowing it to rise into the air, then activate the ancient factories all over Amphibia to create a [[Frog-Bot Army|robot frog army]] that flew to the flying castle. Andrias was planning to conquer other worlds just as his ancestors did, starting with earth. Marcy spoke, saying this was not part of the plan he told her, only for the mad king to admit he had been deceiving her all this time. When Anne and Sasha asked what they were talking about, Andrias informed everyone that Marcy got them all stranded in Amphibia on purpose, leaving both Anne and Sasha in shock. Marcy then told her friends about her family moving away and how she wanted to use the box so the three of them can always be side by side. Despite being told how could she do such a thing to them , like taking them away from their families and their lives, she then tried to justify her action by reminding them of the fun adventure they had; how Anne and Sasha have grown as people in Amphibia and Anne's friendship with Sprig were all because of her and she gave her "everything", only to distraught Anne, Sasha, Sprig and everyone to back away, leaving Marcy on her knees crying and saying she just didn't want to be alone and Leviathan mocking her for trusting him so blindly. When Anne and the others started fighting the robots, Marcy pulled herself together and joined in. When Anne activated the power of the blue gem and she fought Andrias, Marcy rode on Joe Sparrow to rescue Sprig from falling to his doom. She then took the Calamity Box from its pedestal and used it to open a portal to earth. When Anne and the Plantars jumped through the portal, Andrias stabbed Marcy with his laser sword in fury of her going against his wishes. Marcy told Anne she was sorry just before she collapsed from her injuries and the portal closed.

===Season Three===
[[File:The New Normal 7.png|thumb|left|250px|Marcy in a rejuvenation tank.]]
Marcy is revealed to be alive, but comatosed and inside a containment unit with wires attached to her body by Olivia and Yunnan, while Andrias reveals he has more things planned for her.

[[File:S3-Amphibia-Core-Marcy-Image.png|thumb|250px|Marcy possessed by [[the Core]].]]
Olivia and Yunan break Marcy out of her healing chamber, but just as they are about to make their getaway, the room projects holograms of their worst fears; for Olivia her mother being disappointed in her as the image transforms into a pollution monster, for Yunan a horde of evil looking Grubhogs because one nearly bit her arm off as a kid and for Marcy, it is a vision of Anne and Sasha morphed into a 2-headed giant reminding her how she betrayed them and told her they don't want anything to do with Marcy anymore. Yunan discovers that a bunch of robotic eyes covering the entire room are making the illusions, and the 3 destroy them all. After celebrating their victory, they try to escape again, but they are stopped by Andrias who saw the whole thing thanks to a creepy eye hidden in his crown. Just then, a mechanical multi-eyed monster with robot tentacles appears before them and straps Marcy to a chair. Andrias explains that the creature is called [[the Core]], and it was the combined intellect of Amphibia's greatest minds, and it desired a host and only the smartest one would do. It chose Marcy because, as stated by Olivia, Marcy was the only one to defeat Leviathan at Flipwart. Andrias admits that he truly did like Marcy and tried to suggest an alternative host, but had to obey his master's decision. Marcy struggles, but it is pointless as a helmet is placed on her head. Olivia and Yunan watch in horror, and even Andrias was unable to watch as Marcy screams in agony as the Core downloads its consciousness into her. The Core, now one with Marcy, then forebodingly greets everyone.
[[File:Amphibia Darcy mommet 1.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Darcy examining earth technology from Marcy's phone ]]
After Anne defeats another one of Andrias's robots, the Core-possessed Marcy then begins taunting him about his failure as a king, calling him pathetic. Andrias reassures his master that they will succeed, looking over his massive army of frobots saying that no one can stop them, especially not Anne, Earth, or anyone. Later, the Core-possessed Marcy decides to call itself Darcy (Dark Marcy) as reference to  Marcy's favorite video game. Darcy has Andrias erase Marcy's memories during a system tune-up. After Andrias says he is ready to invade earth Darcy temporarily shifted its voice to Andrias' late father King Aldrich claiming to almost be proud of him.

A few days later, "Darcy" prepares for the invasion and then lays a trap to capture Anne and Sasha, she, albeit under the control of the Core, then meets/reunites with Anne, under the control of Darcy whom taunts and questions her friendship with Sasha and Anne after examining her memories. After announcing their victory, Darcy decides to kill Anne so that she will not use her Calamity powers to defeat them. The latter, however, manages to outsmart her before Darcy announces that she will keep Anne alive for now, planning to dissect her as they, along with Andrias, begin the invasion on Earth. 

Within the recesses of Darcy's mind, an amnesiac Marcy finds herself surrounded by her interests including puzzles, books, and a whole fantasy world. Aldrich arrives and tells her that she can have whatever she wants and she excitedly embraces her world. Marcy tries to remember what important memory she has forgotten, but Aldrich continues to feed into her wants by turning her into a fantasy character and providing her with a more compliant Anne and Sasha. After false Anne and Sasha claim that 'they too, like whatever Marcy likes', she remembered and realized that the real Anne and Sasha will not necessarily like everything she takes interest in, Marcy finally sees through the Core's illusions and faces reality, even though the truth is painful sometimes. Aldrich "The Core" almost grabbed Marcy to be assimilated to The Core, but she stopped him from letting her joining the Core. She claims only a coward would choose to hide away in this simulated illusion. She overcomes it and then she rejects both the fantasy & Aldrich "The Core". Aldrich "The Core" left & trapped her in a black void. After Aldrich "The Core" leaves her to fade into nothing, Marcy says she believes in Anne and Sasha. Marcy holds the picture of her friends close as hope & waits for her friends to free her from The Core & the darkness so she can be whole again.

[[File:Please come back to us.webp|thumb|Marcy Wakes up after being freed by the Core.]]
Darcy prepares to finish Sasha off, but becomes alerted and disgusted by Andrias' weakness. She claims to Sasha, as fellow control freak, she will appreciate her next move, and forces her control over Andrias through his crown, demanding him to fight and while claiming they are all he'll ever need or have. While Darcy was distracted Sasha, inspired by what Anne told her earlier how 'it isn't about who they were before, but who they are now' that matters, finally puts her former self behind her as she attacks Darcy with the last of her strength. When Sasha attacks Darcy with her sword, Darcy laughs as they believed she missed, but it turns out she hit exactly what she meant to hit; the cord connected to Darcy's helmet, which causes it to break off. Darcy screams in shock, calling Sasha a fool and saying if she knows what she has done before screaming once more in anguish as all the robotic eyes inside the chamber shatter and orange energy seeps out of the human body. At last, Marcy is freed and loses consciousness. Anne, Frobo and the Plantars fly up to the castle to the freed, but still unconscious Marcy. Just before Marcy started to wake up & regain control of her mind & body, Anne & Sasha's tears landed on her cheeks & slowly started to awaken. She apologizes for her actions and getting them sent to Amphibia to begin with as she did not want to lose her friends. Anne tells her that no matter what happens, nothing will ever erase the good times they had together. A few moments later, she and her friends transport the castle back to Amphibia to announce their victory only to find the blood moon of Amphibia getting closer to the castle.

Marcy then reveals that during her time while she was in the Core's mind, she's reveals that if the Core fails to take over Earth and the Multiverse, the Core will destroy Amphibia using Amphibia's blood moon. [[Mother Olm]] shows up and informs her, Sasha, and Anne that the prophecy has finally come to past. Sasha then reveals to her that Prophecy is about her, Sasha, and Anne must save Amphibia. Valerana appears and helps the Girls connect with their stones and awaken their full calamity powers. Marcy, Sasha, and Anne took off to take on the Core and its remaining forces, they used their new Calamity Powers and destroy the Core's remaining forces. Marcy spotted Frobots approaching, she flew to go stop them, but trip over space debris, to her surprise the frobots came to help as Andrias had finally turn on the Core.

However, the Core prove too powerful for them, Marcy and Sasha started to grow weak as they're not used to their new powers. Anne decides to use both Marcy and Sasha's powers in order to used a spell that will destroy the Core, but could also end up killing Anne. Marcy and Sasha return to Amphibia and watch as Anne uses the Spell to destroy the Core along with the Blood Moon. Although they had succeeded in destroying the Core, Sprig and Frobo return with Anne's stone body, shocking and saddening Marcy and everyone. Marcy started to mourn along with everyone as Anne died and disintegrated. However Anne was later brought back to life in possession of shards of the Calamity Gems, much to Marcy and everyone else's relief and happiness.

The human girls start to say their goodbyes to all their amphibian friends. Marcy apologizes to the newts for technically being the cause of all their troubles, but Olivia and Yunan thank her for changing their lives. A repentant Andrias, quietly tells her to "take care, Kiddo". Anne, Sasha and Marcy then walk though the portal back to earth.

Sometime after returning to Earth, Marcy and her family moved out of state, but she still visited Anne and Sasha and kept in contact with them over the years. Marcy later became a webcomic artist and started publishing it online. Ten years later, Sasha picks up Marcy at the airport to celebrate Anne's birthday, the two were talking while driving to go pick up Anne. Marcy and Sasha arrived at the Aquarium to pickup Anne and the three were reunited and head out to celebrate Anne's birthday.

==Trivia==
[[File:Sasha thumbs up.jpg|thumb|250px|Marcy appearing just as manipulative as Sasha.]]
*Marcy is confirmed to be a gamer. She is shown playing a device that is shown to resemble a Nintendo Switch.
*Marcy's betrayal and backstabbing is foreshadowed throughout the series.
**In season 1, Marcy has a nefarious look on her face while Anne steals the music-box.
**Throughout the intros to season 2, Marcy appears cloaked with the Calamity Box overtop of Anne and Sasha as they sword fight. This represents Marcy as a greater threat in the story than Sasha and Anne's conflict, cloaks her as to imply mystery and hidden true identity, and has her back turned to the camera as lighting strikes it, paralleling Andrias stabbing her in the back with his flaming sword.
**In Marcy's first episode with dialogue in Season 2, Sprig spends the episode convinced she is going to betray the group.
***In the same episode, in a flashback Sasha tells Anne that, "One of these days she's going to get herself killed".
**The rest of the group functioning as flip-wart pieces in The First Temple while Marcy controls them with intent to not get any of them hurt only to obliviously inflict harm on all of them parallels Marcy manipulating Anne and Sasha into entering Amphibia, believing it to be for their best interest only for both to get hurt. Sprig also has the line, "You wouldn't be saying that if you were the pawn", foreshadowing Marcy being Andrias' pawn.
**When Maddie first meets Marcy, flames burst from behind Marcy's back and she falls over in a parallel to her backstabbing.
**After the three gems were recharged, Marcy fearfully stops Anne from using it until they meet King Andrias back in Newtopia.
**Following the "Battle of the Bands" when Anne is letting the frogs know they'll be going home soon, Marcy can be seen with a nervous and quizzical expression on her face.
*Marcy's voice actress, Haley Tju, voiced [[Karmi]] on ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]''. Interestingly, Tju is the only voice out of the main three human characters to actually be a teenager at the time of recording her dialogue. Both [[Brenda Song]] and [[Anna Akana]] are in their late 20s, early 30s at the time of recording.
**Tju played the younger version of [[London Tipton]] (Song's other role) in "[[A London Carol]]".
*Marcy Wu is the only character to receive design changes between seasons.
*Early concept art showed that Marcy was at one point going to have long hair and big round glasses.
*Throughout season 2, Marcy has a butterfly motif. This is evident by the character's fondness for butterflies and moths.
*Marcy’s last name Wu is a dialect of Chinese spoken in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the city of Shanghai.
*Contrary to her actual debut, in "[[Best Fronds]]" the brief appearance of Marcy implied that she herself was also somewhat manipulative of Anne. This is explained by "[[True Colors (Amphibia)|True Colors]]" revealing she intentionally wanted the three of them transported to Amphibia so she wouldn't be alone.
*Marcy has shown possible traits of ASD and ADHD.
**When asked if Marcy is Autistic in a reddit thread, Matt responded, "She was not written with that intention, but I think we get to know our characters better as we write them. In many ways, they tell us who they are, not vice versa. I am so happy to see people identify with her in this way."
**He later clarified his comments stating that while he is happy to see ASD people identify with her, he did not want to contradict them or their reasons for believing she was such, adding that he is "not qualified to commit to her being someone with ASD."<ref>https://twitter.com/Radrappy/status/1537268214538743809</ref>
*Marcy's fate in season three is similar to [[Echo (Star Wars)|Echo]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]]/[[Darth Vader]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'' due to:
**Gets injured to protect their allies (Presumed dead for Echo, war wounds for Anakin, stabbed for Marcy)
**Gets connected by wires by their enemies (CIS for Echo, Andrias for Marcy)
**Gets the villain to stab in the back (Andrias to Marcy, a common thing in ''Star Wars'')
**Gets recovered and overseen by the bad guy. (King Andrias, [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]])
**Gets evil by the bad guy (Fallen to the Dark Side for Anakin, possessed for Marcy)
*At the very end of Marcy's Theme Song Takeover, she says, "Hope nothing bad ever happens to me," which proves to be a tempting fate as she is turned into a physical host for the Core by King Andrias.
*Despite Marcy officially making her debut almost midway into Season 2, she quickly became the show's most popular and beloved character. The number of views of her own "Theme Song Takeover" surpassed Sasha's in just a few days on YouTube.
*When possessed by the Core, the credits list her name as "Darcy", which likely refers to the name of her possessed form.
**The name "Darcy" is a pun on "darkness".
