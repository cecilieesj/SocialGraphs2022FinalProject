He was performed and voiced by [[Steve Whitmire]] and appeared in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Dinosaur_TV Dinosaur TV] segments in two fourth season episodes -- "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_406:_Terrible_Twos Terrible Twos]" and "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_413:_Into_the_Woods Into the Woods]."

Blarney is adored by young children but is less popular with older viewers. He appears on videotapes released as part of the Blarney Home Video Library. Parents who order will "get a new video delivered to their child every hour for the next decade." Titles spoof not only the Barney franchise but other commercials for mail-order videos, from fitness and health tapes to bridge, computers and semi-religious quests.

A similar Barney spoof, [[Georgie]], appeared as a full-bodied character in "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_414:_Georgie_Must_Die Georgie Must Die]."

==Trivia==
*Blarney is clearly intended as a spoof of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Barney_and_Friends Barney the Dinosaur] given the company had a small rivalry against Lyrick Studios, the company that made Barney.
