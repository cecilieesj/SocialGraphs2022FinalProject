|status = Active}}'''Peter Pegasus''' (also known as '''Baby Pegasus''' or '''Young Pegasus''' in certain sources) is one of the main protagonists in "[[The Pastoral Symphony]]" segment of the [[1940]] film ''[[Fantasia]]''.
He is presumably the youngest of [[Pegasi Siblings|his siblings]], and bears the most resemblance to his parents, having [[Father Pegasus|his father]]'s coat and [[Mother Pegasus|his mother]]'s mane, tail, and eye color.

He's a playful little foal, eager to get in on the fun, and fly with his family.

The character's popularity within the Disney studio lead them to consider utilizing him in future Fantasia segments before work on any Fantasia followups were cancelled. Some of these proposed pieces were "Invitation to the Dance" and "Flight of the Bumblebee".<ref>[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-anecdotes-216/ "Animation Anecdotes #216".

==Trivia==
*Although he was referred to as Peter Pegasus during the film's production,<ref>{{Cite web|website=D23|url=https://d23.com/15-fascinating-facts-about-fantasia/|title=Fifteen Fascinating Facts About ''Fantasia''|author=Fanning, Jim|publisher=Disney}}</ref> the character was originally not heavily promoted with this name, and is occasionally referred to as either "Baby Pegasus" or "Pegasus" in certain materials and merchandise.<ref>[https://dlove.jp/mezzomiki/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_6831.jpg Disney Tsum Tsum Fantasia Collection]</ref><ref>[https://www.entertainmentearth.com/product/disney-the-world-of-miss-mindy-fantasia-pegasus-statue/en6001167 "Disney The World of Miss Mindy Fantasia Pegasus Statue". ''Entertainment Earth'']</ref>
*Most materials relating to Peter Pegasus' name were related to the unfinished standalone segments and the name became more prominently used again when these materials were re-discovered in the 1990s during the research for ''[[The Disney That Never Was: The Stories and Art of Five Decades of Unproduced Animation]]'' and the name has found new use since.
