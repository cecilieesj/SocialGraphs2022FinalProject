==History==
Jeek is an evil passling and Blunk's nemesis. A smuggler much like Blunk but has a tendency to make deals with the bad guys, as seen in season one when he steals the Heart of Kandrakar from Will to trade it with Phobos for money and in season two when he trades the Horn of Hypnos with Raythor. Coincidentally, Blunk is blamed for the stealing of the Heart of Kandrakar. In season two he becomes a Trance Marcher after he sold the Horn of Hypnos to Raythor. Also like Blunk, Jeek hates getting wet and having a bath.
