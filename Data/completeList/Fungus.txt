'''Jeff Fungus''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s [[2001]] animated film, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''. He is [[Randall Boggs]]' former assistant and currently [[Mike Wazowski]]'s assistant.

==Background==
===Personality===
Fungus is shown to be very clumsy and cowardly, the latter proved when [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] furiously threatens him to put him through the shredder if he does not bring another [[door]] to the station. He is generally incompetent and always bullied and abused by Randall, never having the guts to stand up to him.

Initially, Fungus is a kind monster and means well, even apologizing to [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] about his capture. He eventually falls victim to the machine himself. After Randall is banished to the human world and [[Henry J. Waternoose III|Mr. Waternoose]] is arrested by the [[CDA]], Fungus is a lot happier and takes on the job of making children laugh.

===Physical appearance===
Fungus is a small red monster with legs similar to those of a chicken and three eyes.

He wears three-lensed glasses.

==Appearances==
===''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''===
In the film, Fungus is [[Randall Boggs|Randall]]'s scare assistant. He is rather cowardly and wimpy due to the wrathful temper of Randall and helps him with his plan to revolutionize the scaring industry, although he regrets it.

He helps Randall (out of fear) to create the [[Scream Extractor]]. Fungus is initially a kind person and means well, even apologizing to [[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] about his capture. Due to [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]]'s timely intervention, Fungus falls victim to the machine himself, which blanches him white, proving that it would cause great physical harm if used on a human child.

Fungus is later seen, having recovered from the incident, operating machine's controls once again, this time testing it on [[Boo]] as Randall and [[Henry J. Waternoose III|Mr. Waternoose]] watch on in anticipation. He also assists Randall as they pursue Sulley and Mike (who had rescued the girl from the device) but falls behind due to a crowd of monsters congratulating Randall for supposedly breaking Sulley's Scare record, courtesy of [[Celia Mae|Celia]] at the PA system's controls.

After Randall was banished and Mr. Waternoose was arrested, Fungus is a lot happier and takes on the job of making children laugh. He is also grateful to his new boss Sulley, both for forgiving him for conspiring with Randall and assigning him a job on the newly-commissioned Laugh Floor. It is unknown if he also became a scarer, as it was revealed in ''[[Monsters, Inc. Scream Team Training]]'' that the monsters still use screams.

===''[[Monsters University]]''===
Fungus did not appear in the final film. Originally, he was also supposed to be added, but was scrapped.
