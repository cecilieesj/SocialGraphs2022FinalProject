The '''Lion Ringmaster''' is a character and antagonist who appears in the video game ''[[The Great Circus Mystery starring Mickey and Minnie|The Great Circus Mystery]]'' as the boss of the Haunted Circus level.

==Background==
The Lion Ringmaster is an anthropomorphic lion as his name implies whom the player encounters at the end of the Haunted Circus level. As the player passes by the circus wagon where the Ringmaster is lurking at during the end of the level after exiting the circus tent, the wagon then moves by itself and then stops to reveal the Lion Ringmaster leaping out of it. When the battle starts, the Lion Ringmaster constantly leaps throughout the level which the player must avoid his shadow to avoid getting damaged. Throughout the battle, the Lion Ringmaster's mane suddenly starts spinning which the player can take damage on jumping on him when his mane is spinning. The player must wait for the mane to return to its normal appearance so the player can jump on him without taking damage.

Aside from the jumping attacks, the Lion Ringmaster will occasionally sneeze which causes parts of his mane to be separate from him. The most dangerous attack during the battle the Lion Ringmaster does during the battle is when he tosses his mane at the player which the player must jump over and then jump on him to deal damage. The Lion Ringmaster repeats the pattern again. To make the battle easy, the player can also equip himself in a sweeper outfit to vacuum all the mane in order to make the battle easier.

==Role in the game==
