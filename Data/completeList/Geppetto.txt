{{Quote|Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others, that you deserve to have your wish come true.|The [[Blue Fairy]] before granting [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] life|Pinocchio (film)}}
'''Geppetto''' is a major character in [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]]'s [[1940]] animated feature film, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''. He is a kindly, old woodcarver and the creator of [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]], a wooden puppet that is brought to life by the [[Blue Fairy]] per Geppetto's wish to have a son.

==Background==
Geppetto is described by [[Jiminy Cricket]] as a woodcarver who lives in a small [[Geppetto's Workshop|home]] with his kitten [[Figaro]] and goldfish [[Cleo]]. Aside from his pets, he doesn't seem to have a family, but nevertheless remains kind-hearted and humble. According to the [[Blue Fairy]], Geppetto is somewhat of a saint, and he is implied to have spent the majority of his life selflessly bringing joy to others.

As mentioned, Geppetto is a woodcarver and is extremely talented in his work. His home is filled with a massive array of original creations, including toys, figurines, clocks, articulated knick-knacks, and other items created by Geppetto, himself. He also appears to have some musical talent, as he not only creates a number of music boxes but is seen playing the concertina.

===Personality===
Geppetto is a humble old man who gleefully spends the majority of his time working on unique creations in his workshop. Most of these creations are meant for the entertainment of both himself and others, presenting Geppetto as a playful child-at-heart. He doesn't have much sternness in his attitude, nor does has he shown any legitimately negative traits to his character, aside from being somewhat of a passive.

He is also very whimsical, with Jiminy describing his dreams as "lovely thoughts, but not at all practical", specifically referring to Geppetto's dream to have Pinocchio become a real boy. He doesn't make much of a fuss of how Pinocchio's sentience came to be, once they meet. Additionally, he speaks to and treats both Figaro and Cleo as his children, and, at times, confidantes, rather than animals. However, he also maintains some discipline towards them, as when Pinocchio ended up not coming home for dinner, he asks them to not eat until he finds him. He also has a little mischievous sense of humor, as he made Pinocchio playfully kick Figaro and scare him before the puppet was brought to life.

As Pinocchio's father, Geppetto is undoubtedly loving, nurturing, and protective. He was initially shocked at Pinocchio's presence, being a living puppet, but was quick to set that aside for the sake of providing him with the love that any human child should receive. After Pinocchio went missing, Geppetto wasted no time in searching the village and beyond to find his son; taking on dark streets, rainstorms, and the deadly whale [[Monstro]], Geppetto was relentless in ensuring his son was safe. After the two finally reunite, and Geppetto learns of Pinocchio's mishaps, he makes no effort to reprimand his evidently remorseful son, simply feeling grateful to finally be a united family once more.

===Physical appearance===
Geppetto is a slender elderly man with white hair, a thick matching mustache, thick gray eyebrows, blue eyes, a pink cherry nose, and pale skin. He wears frameless and rectangular spectacles, a light blue-colored shirt with baggy sleeves under a red-violet vest, a horizontal red-violet suspender with gold lining and dark crosses supported by two vertical brown suspenders with gold buttons holding black breeches, knee-high teal socks, and brown shoes with gold buckles. He also wore a brown apron when he was creating Pinocchio, and a red pointed stocking cap with a light blue pompom, a blue scarf with two pale blue stripes and a maroon coat with a brown patch and two buttons when he was looking for Pinocchio.

At night, Geppetto wears a mint green ankle-length nightgown with two white buttons, a red nightcap with a dark gray ornament, and red slippers.

==Appearances==
===''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''===
When first introduced, Geppetto is shown to be working on his latest, greatest creation, a marionette. Geppetto then names the puppet [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]], for he was made of pine, and plays around with it once he's completed. This makes Figaro very jealous, which Geppetto realizes eventually.

Geppetto then realizes it's time for bed and spots a wishing star from his bed. He reveals to Figaro his wish for Pinocchio to become a real boy. Afterward, Geppetto dozes off to sleep. During his slumber, Geppetto is visited by the Blue Fairy who grants Geppetto's wish for his acts of kindness to others. Through her magic, Pinocchio comes to life. He walks and talks, complete with a conscience, Jiminy Cricket. While Jiminy and Pinocchio are singing to celebrate their union Pinocchio falls off the shelf and makes much noise.

[[File:Pinocchio-disneyscreencaps.com-2657.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Geppetto meets the living Pinocchio for the first time.]]
After being awakened by the noise, Geppetto realizes that he, Cleo, and Figaro are not the only ones in the house at the moment. Geppetto spots Pinocchio, who he thinks is still just a puppet and places him back on the shelf. Pinocchio speaks to Geppetto, who believes he's dreaming and splashes water on himself. Geppetto realizes it's not a dream and begins to celebrate along with Cleo and Figaro. Pinocchio innocently catches his own finger on fire, and Geppetto panics. Geppetto then douses Pinocchio's finger with Cleo's fishbowl water and decides that the group should go to bed before anything else happens.

The next morning, Geppetto prepares Pinocchio for his first day of school, presenting him with a vest, a book, and an apple for the teacher. Figaro attempts to follow him, but of course, Geppetto stops him, explaining that school is not for cats. On the way unknown to Geppetto, Pinocchio is taken to [[Stromboli]] by local crooks [[J. Worthington Foulfellow]] and his sidekick [[Gideon]]. When Pinocchio doesn't return home, Geppetto goes out once again to look for his son. At one point he passes [[Stromboli's Caravan]], but neither he nor Pinocchio spot or hear each other. It is implied that he continues searching in vain before returning home in defeat and grief.

Later on, Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo eventually learn of Pinocchio's presence on Pleasure Island, presumably from Foulfellow and Gideon or (much probably) from some inhabitants of the town who heard the duo of conmen singing at night while taking Pinocchio to the Coachman, and sail out to rescue him, but are swallowed by [[Monstro]] the whale on the way. After Pinocchio and Jiminy are informed of Geppetto's fate via a message from the Blue Fairy as a dove, it is Geppetto who is rescued. 

After a search, Pinocchio is swallowed by Monstro (though Jiminy is not) and reunites with Geppetto, who is taken aback when he discovers Pinocchio having been affected by Pleasure Island's curse has donkey ears, tail, and bray in his laugh and wonders how that happened to him. Though Pinocchio is hesitant, to tell the truth, Geppetto puts it aside for the moment since they are together again and nothing else matters, and plan on how to escape Monstro. Pinocchio then plans to escape by lighting a fire with smoke to make Monstro sneeze, though Geppetto is hesitant due to the monstrous whale's temper. 

The plan works but leads to a deadly chase. Geppetto nearly drowns when their raft is destroyed, but Pinocchio manages to save him by grabbing his shirt and swimming to shore with him. Pinocchio, Geppetto, Cleo, Figaro, Jiminy are all sent to shore by a giant wave in the process, but Pinocchio is killed by it. 

Back at Geppetto's workshop, Geppetto and the others mourn Pinocchio's death. In honor of Pinocchio's courage however, the Blue Fairy revives Pinocchio as a real boy, also reversing the effects of Pleasure Island's curse he had contracted. Still overwhelmed by grief, Geppetto is initially ignorant of the fact that his son is alive (even while speaking to him), believing him to still be dead. However, when he looks up and sees Pinocchio, he rejoices to see his son alive and a real child. The family then celebrates in elation.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
[[File:37.PNG|thumb|250px|Geppetto with Pinocchio and Jiminy in ''House of Mouse''.]]
Geppetto made numerous cameo appearances in Disney's 2001-03 television series ''House of Mouse'', usually seen with Pinocchio or Figaro. In "[[House of Genius]]" he was amazed at the robots created by Ludwig Von Drake. In the episode "[[Goofy's Menu Magic]]" when the club was flooded in soup, Pinocchio and Geppetto can be briefly seen in the wooden raft in the sea of soup. In "[[Donald's Lamp Trade]]", Geppetto complained about how he didn't get any sleep, while Pinocchio stated: "I slept like a log". Geppetto can be spotted inside Monstro during [[The Ludwig Von Drake Song|Ludwig Von Drake's headcount of all the Disney characters]] in "[[Ask Von Drake]]".

Geppetto can also be seen in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'', with Pinocchio during [[The Best Christmas of All|the finale song]]. He can also be seen in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', being imprisoned in the kitchen alongside other protagonists when the [[Disney Villains]] take over.

===''[[Geppetto (TV Musical)|Geppetto]]''===
He was portrayed by [[Drew Carey]] in the 2000 TV film ''Geppetto''. The film was told from Geppetto's perspective (making him the protagonist this time) as he chased after Pinocchio during his adventures from the 1940 film, having his own adventures in the process. In the end, Pinocchio is turned into a real boy due to Geppetto learning what it means to be a parent, rather than Pinocchio learning what it means to be a boy.

===''[[Once Upon a Time]]''===
[[File:Once Upon a Time - 1x20 - The Stranger - Geppetto.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Geppetto in ''Once Upon a Time''.]]
Gepetto (Tony Amendola, Michael Strusievici as a young boy) is an elderly carpenter and Pinocchio's caretaker. Geppetto is orphaned when Jiminy accidentally transforms Geppetto's parents into puppets. To make amends, Jiminy looks after him. Geppetto later carves himself a son named Pinocchio out of magical wood. As a little boy puppet, he gives his life to save Geppetto from drowning in a storm. As a reward, Blue Fairy turns Pinocchio into a real boy. The Blue Fairy asks Geppetto to carve another enchanted tree into a magical wardrobe with the ability to save two people, the pregnant Snow White and Prince James from the Evil Queen's curse. However, the curse will send everyone to a land without magic and Pinocchio, who is a real boy because of magic, may turn back into a puppet. Geppetto bargains with the Fairy to use the second spot for Pinocchio and the Fairy lies to the others and says that the wardrobe can only save one. When Snow White's child is born, instead of giving up Pinocchio's spot to Snow White, Geppetto sends his son and tells him to protect the child and get her to believe in magic after twenty years.

In Storybrooke, he is '''Marco''', the town's handyman and an old friend of Archie, who is really Jiminy. Marco states that he and his wife are unable to have children. August Booth, the adult Pinocchio, later tells Marco that he failed his father and though he tried to keep his promise, he tried too late. Marco tells him that if he had a son, that would be enough. August offers to work as Marco's assistant though he cannot be paid, and Marco agrees to take him on.

===[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]]===
[[File:Geppetto.png|right|250px]]
In ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', Geppetto is very fascinated with gummi blocks that could be used to travel to other worlds. When the [[Heartless]] came and destroyed his world, he somehow escaped and has been traveling to many worlds to find [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]]. He is first met in the mouth of [[Monstro]], standing on his wooden ship, which Monstro had swallowed whole. It is never explained exactly how this occurred since Monstro swims between worlds in ''Kingdom Hearts'', and Geppetto had no way of traveling there. Nevertheless, he requests the help of [[Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], asking them to bring back his son, Pinocchio, when he notices Pinocchio wander off into Monstro, unaware he was following [[Riku]]. When they return to Geppetto later, Riku has taken Pinocchio hostage, and Geppetto pleads for Riku to give his son back to him, but Riku refuses, believing Pinocchio's heart will help revive [[Kairi]]. Sora, Donald, and Goofy pursue him to Monstro's stomach, where they retrieve Pinocchio and defeat the large Parasite Cage Heartless who had taken Pinocchio hostage earlier.

After the Monstro ordeal, he, like many other refugees, moves to [[Traverse Town]] with Pinocchio and opens up a shop in the First District after [[Leon (Kingdom Hearts)|Leon]] helps him find a home. At this shop, he designs blueprints for [[Gummi Ship]]s and gives them to Sora for free so that Sora can use them in the war against [[Maleficent]] and the [[Heartless]].

==Trivia==
*The name "Geppetto" is a variant of "Giuseppe", which is Italian for "Joseph", and it's also the diminutive for "Geppo", which is the Tuscan pronunciation for ''ceppo'', meaning a log, stump, block, stock or stub.
*In the original Italian story of Pinocchio, Geppetto was depicted as a woodcarver on hard times, so poor he can't even afford wood for a fire, so he paints one in his fireplace! He also was also a bit vain, as he wore a silly blond wig to try to hide his baldness, and also had a bit of an irascible side, especially if people made fun of his wig. The author Carlo Collodi was said to have based the character on an eccentric old man he knew growing up, only the real-life Geppetto was a coffin-maker, not a wood-carver! (Granted, both careers deal with wood...)
*In a deleted scene for the original film, Geppetto was to tell the story of Pinocchio's "grandfather", a mighty tree.
*In at least one book adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', like the 1953 ''Pinocchio'' (Little Golden Book), it is specified that Geppetto sailed to search Pinocchio on [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]], thus giving sense to his departure.
*Animator [[Art Babbitt]] once noted that Geppetto was his favorite character to animate.
*In ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'', Geppetto is mentioned when you click on a clock that in the bedroom with Jiminy Cricket saying, "That's a one of a kind cuckoo clock - made by Geppetto himself".
