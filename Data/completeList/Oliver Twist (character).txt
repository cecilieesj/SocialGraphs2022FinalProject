==Role in the film==
One rainy night, Oliver is born at a workhouse owned by Mrs. Corney after his unknown mother dies giving birth to him and leaves him a locket, which contains a portrait of her mother. Corney takes the locket and Mr. Bumble names the child Oliver from his rotating alphabetical list of names.

Six years later, Oliver is now working in the workhouse’s dye works. He wants to see his locket. Corney reluctantly shows it to him. She says that he can have it if he’s a good boy when he turns 12.
