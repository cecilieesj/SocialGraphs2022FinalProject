After their daughter turned into a beast and went missing, the King and Queen instructed the guards to hunt her down, unaware that the beast they were hunting was their own daughter. When they couldn't find Charlotte in the castle and discovered footprints, they assumed that the goblin, [[Morris (Sofia the First)|Morris]], has kidnapped her. They sent out their guards to find and arrest him. When they finally saw Charlotte as a beast, Philip and Everly at first did not believe she was their daughter. But Charlotte was able to convince her parents and they witnessed their daughter change back after becoming true friends with Morris.
