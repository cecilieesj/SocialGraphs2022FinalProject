'''Walter Beckett''' is the deuteragonist of the [[2019]] [[Blue Sky Studios]] animated film, ''[[Spies in Disguise]]''. He is a kid making weapons and gadgets for the U.S. government.

==Background==
Walter graduated from college when he was fifteen at the M.I.T. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Even as a kid, Walter believed that his humane gadgets are the best way to protect the world ever since his late mother told Walter that his unique ideas will do so in the future. As his young self wanting to make sure that his police officer mother is kept safe at work is what inspired him to create his unique gadgets. While everyone else at the agent work on valet affected weapons and gadgets, as its agents prefer to fight fire with fire, Walter stays true to his non-valet approach despite the fact that no one listens to him when it comes to his unique gadget ideas that many see as odd and weird.

===Physical Appearance===
Walter is a teenager with brown hair, light skin and, light blue eyes. He wears a zip-up hoodie on top of an untucked plaid green long-sleeved shirt, grey pants, and dark red shoes.

==Role in the film==
As a young child, Walter makes a gadget for his mother [[Wendy Beckett|Wendy]] to wear when on patrol just as he discusses with her about glitter making people happy only to notice that Walter took part of her cellphone to make this invention only for him to prevent this from happening just before his mother goes on her shift to keep the city safe just before she leaves.

Later at the Honor Trust Unity Valor agency at Washington D.C., [[Lance Sterling]] encounters Walter testing his invention on his plush unicorn Unitee just before a fellow agent Terrance arrives as he sends him an invite to watch the season finale of his favorite TV series ''Hearts in Seoul'' just before approaching Sterling, to which it is known that the kitty glitter he used was actually from him just as Lance explains that he is on his duty in completing his assignment, just as Walter approaches him at the elevator explaining to him that he is the world's greatest spy just as he decides to join Lance alongside him. Walter then approaches a group of agents whom Lance believed he would fire him. Later in a plan to find [[Katsu Kimura]], Lance then contacts Walter to help him with his assignment.

At home, Walter grieves over his late mother who passed away while a nearby pigeon named Lovey watches Walter's favorite Korean telenovela alongside Walter, after which he goes to his invention to know if it would act properly. Walter asks Lovey to borrow one of her feathers to which while using the feather, he tests it as he feels satisfied that it worked to which upon drinking the tech, it is known that Lance drank an ingestible formula that uses a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic editor that turns him into a pigeon as he explains to Lance about what he is about to experience is the future of espionage.

After Lance turns into a pigeon, he demands Walter that he should return to his normal form to which while escaping, he explains to him about why he is escaping from H.T.U.V., to which Lance warns him about Killian who disguises as Lance in a plan to stop him and prove to the Agency that he is not working for him just as he tells him that he is fired from the agency.

Leaving the house, Walter and Lance find Marcy and her squadron of agents demanding Lance to leave the premises immediately just as Walter tells the AI to auto drive to which during the chase, he and Lance argue to tell the computer whether to deploy the oil slick or not to which the computer reboots after an overlapped argument. Having deployed to oil slick and escaped from Marcy, Walter and Lance find themselves on a large truck just as Lance tells the car's computer to deploy the airstrip. Later at a plane, Walter tells Lovey that this is best opportunity to test so many gadgets he made to which the two see Lance using a touch screen to look for Kimura while Walter is told to work on an antidote to turn Lance back into a human explaining to him that he has been a pigeon for 18 hours while telling Lance about pigeon facts to which the plane suddenly arrives at Mexico, where Kimura is at.

Arriving at the hotel riviera at Playa Del Carmen, Walter and Lance walk past a group of Yakuza agents to which while looking at a receptionist giving guests their room key, Lance devises a plan to find Kimura and finish his assignment to which Lance becomes distracted upon seeing food on the floor to which he loses control of eating the food and encounters Lovey, followed by two other pigeons who keep chasing him much to Walter reacting to the pigeons following Lance. After Lance retrieves the card from Crazy Eyes to give it to him. Lance tries to go Kimura's hotel room as Walter asks him for help to which Lance denies that he doesn't need any help and risks himself to find Kimura himself.

Noticing Lance being attacked by Kimura, Walter arrives and electrocutes him before he can defeat Lance. As it is explained that [[Killian]] is at Venice, Italy, Kimura explains that when Killian arrives at the Agent Database, he will use the M9 Assassin to destroy the database unless Lance stops him. Walter and Lance then push Kimura in front of the door to prevent Marcy and the other H.T.U.V. agents from entering just as the two plan to escape to Venice to which Ears fires a blast at the door as Marcy notices an unconscious Kimura just as the two plan to evade Marcy and a group of agents by using a grappling hook to escape from them to which the two end up in the pool area at the hotel. Surrounded by a group of soldiers, Walter sees the multi-pen which would help them stop the soldiers only to be swallowed by Crazy Eyes as the pigeon blasts a large amount of gum on them to which the two manage to escape.

Onboard their ship at the Adriatic Sea on their way to Venice, Walter tells Lance that the antidote is complete only to result in failure all of a sudden just as he and Lance argue with each other about stopping Killian before Lance walks away. As the ship arrives at Venice, Italy, the two sail past the canals of Venice as the ship is headed towards the Agency Data Vault with Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes following them onboard as Lance tells Walter that the Data Vault is the supposed hideout of Killian only to be halted by Marcy again. Marcy explains to Walter that he is trying to protect the world just like his mother did to which she explains that Walter's mother sacrificed her life to save the world to which Marcy plans to help Walter get hired back to which upon noticing the explosion in the building, Marcy plans to find Killian, followed by Lance and Walter following her. Upon arriving at the Vault, the two notice a group of soldiers firing at the M9 Assassin which is resistant against the soldiers' bullets two which the two chase the Assassin only to notice it flew away.

Walter explains to Lance that in his pigeon form, he can fly fast just as he gives faith in himself so that Lance can stop the Assassin to which while about to fall off, Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes notice this as Lovey grabs him and teaches him to fly like a pigeon as the three pigeons teach him, followed by Walter using a Vespa to catch up with him. Throughout the chase, Walter grabs the device to which Killian stops him as the two find themselves at the plaza. As Killian approaches Walter, he explains to him that the device the two found belong to him as Walter asks Lance for help only to find out he is stuck and cannot help. As Killian prepares to kill Walter, Lance tells Walter to do something as he throws breadcrumbs for a flock of pigeons to arrive as the pigeons begin to attack him.

Diving underwater via submarine, Walter explains to Lance that he put a tracker on the radar before explaining that Lance could have never done it without his help to which upon noticing that he laid an egg, it is explained that Walter used Lovey's DNA on the serum just as Walter explains that he needs to find one more ingredient for the antidote so Lance can be a human again. Happy that Walter turned him back into a human, the submarine arrives at the Covert Weapons Facility where Lance tells Walter to be considerate of him to which Lance decides to face off against Killian himself.

Walter then plans to rescue Lance, but two M9 Assassin models attack much to Lance's worry as Killian takes everything from him. Furthermore, Walter sends in backup to help Lance defeat Killian in combat to which during battle, Walter attempts to take over Killian's system and disable the drones, but his plan failed due to an error to which the plan resumes when Walter leaves his hiding place. Walter tries to stop Killian from escaping using a multi-pen while continuing to take over Killian's system on his robotic claw to which Lance holds on him to keep him from leaving.  Lance, however, loses Walter as Walter continues his plan to get into the robotic claw's system is complete, as he is able to access the system on Killian's claw to which he receives an option to disable the drones to which Walter manages to deactivate the drones. He places an inflatable hug gadget on Killian which prevents him from falling to his death just as Walter begins to fall back to Earth. All M9 Assassin models sent by Killian are all deactivated thanks to Walter's plan as the H.T.U.V. agency celebrates, followed by Killian's defeat.

Marcy then notices Walter falling to his demise to which Lance, in his pigeon form again, saves Walter from falling to his death, followed by Lovey, Jeff, and Crazy Eyes who are on the way to saving Walter, along with a flock of pigeons. Back at Washington D.C., Walter and Lance are both fired from the agency to their disobedience. Lance tells Walter to look at the world around him upon seeing the Washington Monument from a distance, explaining that his mother would be proud of him if she were alive just as Lance praises Walter for his bravery in saving the world. Walter and Lance are taken back to the agency by Marcy just as Joy apologizes to him for misunderstanding him as a villain. With Lance hired back into H.T.U.V. once again to be the agent of the future, Walter joins alongside him to help the agency for their future.
