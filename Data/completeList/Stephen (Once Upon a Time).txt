==History==

[[File:Once Upon a Time - 1x05 - That Still Small Voice - Puppets.png|thumb|left|200px|Stephen and his wife as puppets]]In the Enchanted Forest, he and his wife, [[Donna]], are tricked by [[Jiminy Cricket]]'s parents, [[Myrna]] and [[Martin (Once Upon a Time)|Martin]], about an elfin plague. They give them a fake serum as a "cure". Unbeknownst to Jiminy, they switched the usual water serum they always use to scam people and give them the potion [[Rumplestiltskin]] had given Jiminy to get rid of his parents. Stephen turns into a puppet after drinking the potion along with his wife, which causes their son, Geppetto, much alarm and grief.

After the casting of the curse, Stephen and Donna remain as puppets in [[Rumplestiltskin|Mr. Gold]]'s pawnshop collection.
