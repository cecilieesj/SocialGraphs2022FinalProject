'''The Collector''' is a sinister being from the show ''[[Bonkers]]'', and the main antagonist of the two-episode pilot "[[Going Bonkers]]". As the first villain whom [[Bonkers D. Bobcat]] encounters, he is somewhat like [[Judge Doom]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. Obscured in shadows to start, he is later revealed to be an amalgamation of cartoon creatures. He wears gloves with pencils on the right, and sharpeners on the left, somewhat similar to Freddy Krueger's razor glove from ''Nightmare on Elm Street''. His main hobby is having [[Toons]] kidnapped and captured in suspended animation.

At the end of the two-part episode, his right glove comes off when he wriggles out of a pair of handcuffs, revealing a five-fingered human hand underneath. He also can resist walking on a banana peel, when other supposedly cartoons can't. It turns out he is really a deranged human nerd in disguise who has an obsession with cartoons. He is last seen backing away from his reflection in a mirror, apparently actually believing he is a Toon and having forsaken reality, and falling into a Toon world contained inside a steel box.

== Trivia ==
* The Collector is pretty much the opposite of [[Judge Doom]] in terms of its true identity. While Doom was a Toon disguised as a human, the Collector was a human disguised as a Toon.
*He is right handed as he is seen with the pencils on his right hand.
*He appeared in the Super Nintendo version of the Bonkers video game as one of the bosses. He's probably an actual toon in the game, instead of human posing as one and he's wearing a green jacket in the game instead of blue and the lens of his glasses are white instead of red.
