==Role in the Series==
The Student Council comes to Bea, saying that they are having a difficult time trying to choose the school dance queen, and said that Bea would be a perfect queen of the dance. They say that the dance queen had to be mature, sophisticated, and not embarrassing. They leave the area, leaving Bea feeling nothing but excitement for the school dance. However, Bea's parents are chaperoning, so she goes back and forth from the school dance to the retirement home. At the dance, the Student Council ask Bea if she is liking the school danceÂ so far. Bea says that the dance is quite regal, to which the Student Council reply that her answer was "queen-like". When Bea tells the Student Council a joke, they say that the joke was hilarious, although they didn't laugh at all. The Student Council kept wanting to see Bea, which makes her go crazy after going all the way to the school dance and back. When the Student Council were about to say the king and queen of the dance, Bea falls onto a mud puddle on the way, so when she comes, the Student Council consider a re-vote after seeing how Bea looks. After Bea and her parents talk about how they were having fun with each other, the Student Council finds the moment touching, so they gave Bea the crown ("[[Queen Bea]]"). The Student Council also auditioned for the Hokey Poke commercial. Although not shown, they get rejected by [[Chief (Fish Hooks)|Chief]].

==Trivia==
*One of them is a female and is pink, another is red, and the other one is orange.
*One is a female, a fact that the other Student Council members didn't notice ("[[Guys' Night Out]]").
