'''Captain Marvel''' (real name '''Maria Rambeau''') is a Marvel character who appears in the [[Marvel Studios|Marvel]] film, ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''. She is an alternate version of [[Maria Rambeau]] from the prime [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and originates from the Earth-838 universe. She is portrayed by [[Lashana Lynch]].

Captain Marvel was a member of the Illuminati, an organization compromised of the Earth's heroes. Together, the group fought against [[Thanos]], and were forced to defeat the [[Doctor Strange]] of their Earth, after he became corrupted by the Darkhold.

[[Doctor Strange]] forms the Illuminati, a band of heroes, originally compromising of himself, Captain Marvel, [[Professor X]], [[Captain Carter]], [[Black Bolt]] and [[Mr. Fantastic]], to make the difficult decisions, no one else can. The group unite against the threat of Thanos, but when Strange begins using the power of the Darkhold, his dreamwalking (possession of an alternate version of himself), leads to the annihilation of another universe. Strange renounces the evils of the Darkhold, and together, the group find the Book of Vishanti, the Darkhold's antithesis, a weapon they use together, to defeat [[Thanos]]. While the threat of the Mad Titan ends, the threat Doctor Strange poses, remains, and the group decide, he must be eliminated. Strange accepts his fate, and Captain Marvel looks away, as Black Bolt uses his sonic scream, to execute the sorcerer.

The group decides that world still needs faith in its heroes, and a statue is later erected of Doctor Strange, under the guise he died in battle.

After Doctor Strange from another universe arrives on their world, with [[America Chavez]], he is brought before the Illuminati to face judgement. His mere presence in their universe destabilizes their reality, and leaves space for an incursion, risking the wellbeing of their world. Mordo introduces the individual members of the organization, and when Strange makes a sarcastic remark, pointed toward Reed Richards, Captain Marvel snaps at him, for his behavior. Captain Carter makes a comment to Captain Marvel, regarding Strange's arrogance, comparing their Doctor Strange to him, and when he states the only difference between the two is he's alive, Captain Marvel reminds him, that he is, for the time being. Captain Carter informs Steven, they will determine his fate, and Captain Marvel asks him to speak up, in line of his defence. Strange warns the group of Scarlet Witch, but Captain Marvel affirms that the group are capable of neutralizing her. Strange argues back they can't, and asks for possession of the Book of Vishanti, but they dismiss his fears, stating he poses a larger threat, and explain the history of their Doctor Strange, and the destruction he left behind.

An alarm is suddenly triggered, and the sentries footage, showcases the carnage left behind at the hands of Wanda Maximoff, who has followed Steven into their universe, via dreamwalking. Captain Marvel realizes she's after America Chavez, and the group leave to stop her. They come face-to-face with the witch, but she kills Mr. Fantastic and Black Bolt within seconds of their confrontation. Captain Marvel flies into the air, and begins shooting an energy blast towards the her, as Captain Carter tries to attack her from the side. The Scarlet Witch's magical forcefield is able to withhold Captain Marvel's attack, and Wanda gets the better of her, throwing a statue in her direction, and hurling her against a wall. Scarlet Witch manages to kill Captain Carter, and Captain Marvel escapes the rubble, and continues her attack. She flies through the various layers of debris that Wanda uses as cover, and shoots at her, demanding she leave their universe. Scarlet Witch in turns, fires back, and the pair are thrown, in opposite directions. Before a weakened Captain Marvel can defend herself, Scarlet Witch topples a statues onto her, which kills her.
