== Role in the film ==
Anthony is looking forward to two things: passing his driver's test and to be able to drive his girlfriend, [[Celia Rodriguez]], to the prom. While he is talking to her on the phone, his younger brother, [[Alexander Cooper|Alexander]], thinks that he is talking nice to him. Due to misleading insults toward Alexander, she hangs up thinking that she is the one being insulted.

The next day, after Alexander's birthday "wish", Anthony notices a zit on his forehead. Their father, [[Ben Cooper|Ben]], advises him to cover it up with a Band-Aid. At school, he manages to make things up with Celia by talking to her in the hall. Afterward, he gets so excited that he jumps up, hits a banner, accidentally breaks the trophy cases it's attached to, and gets sent to the principal.

Later on, while Anthony is taking his driver's test, he receives a call from Celia. His driving examiner, Ms. Suggs, tests him about what is more important to him. When he chooses to answer the phone, she orders him to put it down. This causes him to accidentally drive recklessly, destroy several parking meters, damage the family minivan, and fail the test. During a family argument, he first pins the blame onto Alexander for his worst day ever.

By the time Anthony picks up a teal suit, Ben and [[Kelly Cooper|Kelly]] decide to be the ones to drive him and Celia to the prom. When she notices his suit, she thinks he looks like Willy Wonka. On their way to Nagamaki, he keeps silent as the others are making noises through their fists. At Nagamaki, they sit far away from the others and she scolds him on how she hates this kind of restaurant. Upon seeing Ben embarrassing himself, Anthony and the others kick trash cans around and he realizes that having a bad day with his loved ones makes it a good one. While Celia mentions that her unnamed friend is going to offer them a ride together, he refuses, breaks up with her, and realizes that the prom isn't really worth it.

Back home, Anthony notices that there's an Australian petting zoo for Alexander's birthday party and an alligator in the living room. He is last seen standing around in the backyard during the party.

==Trivia==
*When Anthony accidentally breaks the trophy cases, the teacher refers to him as [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]], the title character of the [[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|film of the same name]], also made by Disney.
*Anthony's personality is very similar to Buzz McCallister's from the first two ''Home Alone'' movies.
*Anthony's teal suit for the prom resembles Harry Dunne's from ''Dumb and Dumber''.
