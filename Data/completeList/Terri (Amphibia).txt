'''Terri '''is a secondary protagonist in the [[2019]] animated series, ''[[Amphibia]]''

==Background==
===Personality ===
Unlike her former boss [[Dr. Frakes]], Terri is down to earth and respectful. She helps Anne rescue the Plantars from Dr. Frakes at the cost of her job. Terri uses her own resources to build a new portal for the Plantars.

===Physical appearance===
Terri is a petite woman with fair skin, short blue hair, and freckles. She wears a lab coat with two patches, a pastel mint shirt with collar under a blue and gray stipend sweater vest, a brown skirt, circular black earrings, white socks, and brown boots.

==Role in the series==
Terri worked for Dr. Frakes for quite some time but was treated very poorly. One day [[Anne Boonchuy]] came to visit  Dr. Frakes' Brainasium asking questions about portals to other worlds. After finding out that the Plantars were talking frogs from another dimension she helped Anne rescue them from Dr. Frakes.  Even though Dr. Frakes threaten to ruin her career in the scientific community, Terri was positive she could get her own grant by helping the Anne and the Planters get back to [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]]  and build her own interdimensional portal.

Sometime later, Terri ends up becoming [[Dr. Jan]]'s assistant to help to build a portal to get Anne and the Plantars back to Amphibia.

In "[[Escape to Amphibia]]", she managed to construct the portal and learn that a certain song helps locate the connection to Amphibia. She succeeds in getting the portal to work, but couldn't make it big enough yet, so she has the Boonchoys and the Planters get specific supplies needed to enable this (along with yogurt-covered pretzels). However, the Plantars were captured by [[Mr. X (character)|Mr. X]] and the FBI, so Terri joined the Boonchuys' mission to rescue them which included [[Dr. Jan]], [[Ally and Jess]], [[Humphrey Westwood]], [[Molly Jo]], and a couple of Women from the Thai Community. While,  the Boonchuys and their friends went inside to rescue the Plantars, Terri and Dr. Jan stole the base's generator to help power up the portal which also cut off the base's power allowing the Boonchuys and their friends break free and save the Plantars. They later escape the base, return to the warehouse and use base's generator to power up the portal, but it still didn't make the portal bigger.

When Mr. X and the FBI arrived to captured them, Anne tapped into her calamity box powers to help make the portal bigger. Anne and the Plantars later escape through it while a giant praying mantis that Anne lure out to distract the FBI. Jenny and an FBI agent managed to subdue the mantis, but end up destroying the portal.
