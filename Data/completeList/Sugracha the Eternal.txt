'''Sugracha the Eternal''' (also known by her alias '''Mrs. Sugarby''') is a servant of [[Zhan Tiri]] and former pupil of [[Lord Demanitus]] who gathering her candidates to gain people's trust.

==Background==
Sugracha was originally a pupil under [[Lord Demanitus]], along with two others who traveled with their lord on his journey to study the legendry [[Sundrop Flower|sun]] and [[Moonstone Opal|moon]] drops. At one point on their journey, however, she, [[Tromus]], and [[Mother Gothel]] decided to betray Demanitus by siding with [[Zhan Tiri]] as her new loyal servants, after they freed her.

At some point, Demanitus defeated Zhan Tiri and imprisoned her in the [[Demanitus Device]] by sending her to the Lost Realm.

===Personality===
As Mrs. Sugarby, Sugracha disguises her true wicked and deceiving nature, with a kind one that would allow people to trust her.

===Powers and Abilities===
As a wicked spirit, she is capable of using dark magic, like a witch or sorceress.

==Role in the [[Tangled: The Series|series]]==
In "[[Painter's Block]]", she was freed from the prison when the Demanitus Device was used to once again end her master's blizzard. She utilized her freedom to find a way to free her master from her imprisonment; which came in the form of Corona's new art gallery. As there were many people that want their artwork to be placed in the gallery, she opened up an art class for those who want to improve; while secretly gathering her candidates that would allow her to perform a spell that would free her master.

In order for the spell to work, she needed five people to paint the giant tree at Janus Point exactly on each canvas. If one is painted differently, the spell wouldn't work. So to make sure that doesn't happen she puts her art students under a hypnotism spell.

She successfully hypnotized [[Feldspar]], [[Ulf]], [[Lance Strongbow]], [[Freidborg]], and [[Rapunzel]] to help her finish the paintings. When the spell was almost completed, [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] and [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]] arrived in time to stop her. With Eugene's encouragement, Rapunzel overcame the hypnotism and destroyed the canvas. As the portal to free Zhan Tiri was closing, she was kicked into the portal by [[Fidella]].

==Trivia==
*The line that Sugracha uses as she slowly puts Rapunzel under her spell is "Life is full of tough choices," a quote that is said by [[Ursula]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.
**While Sugracha says those lines to put her students under her control, she makes a tapping sound with her cane. Should her victims make the same kind of sound it would strengthen the hold that the evil spirit has on their mind.
