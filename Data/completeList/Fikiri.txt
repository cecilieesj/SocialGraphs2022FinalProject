==Background==
===Personality===
Fikiri is kind and respectful to her daughter Makini. She gives her advice about what Makini should do so that she can do well in the future.

==Role in the series==
===''[[Journey of Memories]]''===
In this episode, Fikiri and her mate Kitendo are only seen in flashbacks.

In the first flashback, Makini remembers that she had so much fun at the river with her parents. When Fikiri notices Kitendo feeling cold in the water, she tells him to test the water to see if it is just right or cold before diving in. In the water, she tells Kitendo and Makini that whenever they take a bath in the river, they should never feel afraid to be cold to which her mate tells the two to do it his way. Back in the present, Makini tells [[Bunga]] who made [[Fuli]] wet to remember what her mother told her in the past.

In the second flashback, Makini recalls that she spent time with her parents when she was at the oasis the last time in which she explains to [[Beshte]] that they told her she might be a Royal Mjuzi when she gets older. Fikiri then tells Makini it is time to go to which she explains to her mate that [[Rafiki]] should make paintings that lead to the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]]. When Kitendo tells Makini that spending time in the oasis' water is more fun, Fikiri tells her mate that following the path without water leads to the Tree of Life to which she explains to her daughter that Rafiki would like to meet her. She also tells that Rafiki is a Royal Mjuzi and she explains that Rafiki would believe that Makini might become a Royal Mjuzi to which she says that only the Voices of the Past at the Tree of Life would know that it is time for Makini to be the Royal Mjuzi. Makini's parents then explain that she will always be their daughter unless Makini can explore on her own when she gets older.

That night when the Lion Guard rests at the desert, Makini draws a picture of her mother as she wishes that she ran back to the Pride Lands to get help from her to get to the Tree of Life. In the third flashback, Fikiri tells her daughter that when they look back where they've been to, they can learn, even from their mistakes. Fikiri and her mate then sing to Makini to let her learn from the past of what she did so that she can learn more in the future. She and Kitendo take Makini to the Tree of Life where they present her to Rafiki and [[Janna]] in the area.

===''[[Return to the Pride Lands]]''===
In this episode, Fikiri is finally seen not in a flashback along with her mate Kitendo.

Fikiri and Kitendo attend [[Kion]] and [[Rani]]'s wedding while seeing their daughter as the Royal Mjuzi of the Tree of Life.
