==Background==
{{Quote|Your father and I dreamed so much of coming [[United States|here]], and when we finally came it was so hard.|[[Muneeba Khan]] to [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala Khan]]|Destined}}
Yusuf and his family lived in Karachi for generations. He meets [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]], and the pair who both dream of coming to America, move to [[New Jersey]]. They have a son together, named [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] and Yusuf works long hours, for little money. He becomes acquainted with [[Uncle Rasheed|Rasheed]], who attends the same mosque as him, and they became best friends.

Later on, Yusuf and Muneeba decided they wanted a second child. They tried for years, and almost lost hope, until they had a daughter. They decided to name her [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], derived from the Arabic word "Kamal", which means "perfection".

{{Quote|Oh, [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], my Kamala, the road is a long and winding one, so never fully stop at stop signs.|Yusuf Khan to Kamala Khan|Generation Why}}
[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x01 - Generation Why - Kamala and Yusuf.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
The [[Generation Why|first episode]] begins with Yusuf sitting at the family table, reading a newspaper. He interrupts his son, who is mid-prayer, and warns that if he doesn't stop praying long enough to to put food in his mouth, he'll starve to death. As [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] comes down to prepare for her driving test, he reassures her that she doesn't need to look in the mirrors, as often as she's been taught, and that it's important the instructor see she moves move her head. Yusuf is later called in to pick up his daughter after she failed, and crashed the car. He berates the instructor, on what he expected of Kamala, and leaves, to take Kamala to school.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x01 - Generation Why - Photography - Bruno Shows Zuzu to Yusuf.jpeg|thumb|250px]]
That evening, [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] arrives to give Yusuf the Zuzu, a device of his own making, which connects to all the electronic devices in the house, and responds through voice commands. Bruno then adds he programmed it to understand Urdu, to Yusuf's amazement. After he leaves Kamala asks her parents if she can attend AvengerCon, a fan convention, held in the evening, celebrating superheroes. When Kamala questions whether her parents trust her, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] replies she doesn't, but Yusuf quickly points out they do, but they don't trust anyone else, and she's still young, and they don't want her roaming around strangers at night. Kamala insists it isn't a party, and also mentions she would be dressing as [[Captain Marvel]], to her mother's disapproval. Kamala expresses her anger at being unable to do normal teenage things, and Yusuf points out she isn't normal, resulting in her storming off. He quickly clarifies that he meant she's special, but Kamala heads to her room. [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] later takes Yusuf and Muneeba, and convinces them to let Kamala go the convention, though they agree, under the conditions that Yusuf drive her there, escort her for two hours, and she wear a [[Hulk]] costume of Muneeba's making, which matches one she made for Yusuf too.

The following morning, they give Kamala an update on their decision, and Yusuf shows of the Hulk costume he'd be wearing with Kamala, while sporting green paint on his face, as a surprise. Kamala refuses to go under their terms, and labels it humiliating, hurting her parents feelings in the process. She tries to take back her words, but the damage is done, and Yusuf leaves Kamala's room, forbidding her to go, and on the verge of tears.

One night following their dinner, Yusuf struggles to program the Zuzu to follow his command. While trying to turn on the television, the device malfunctions, and causes the lights to go off, so he tells Kamala to inform Bruno that the machine is possessed by an evil djinn, and he needs to fix it.

The family later have dinner, together, and Yusuf makes conversation about the plight of salamanders in Pakistan, when Kamala excuses herself from the table for an assignment. Aamir later leaves for [[Tyesha Hillman|Tyesha]]'s, and Yusuf playfully points out to his wife that both children are out of the way.

Yusuf attends mosque, with Aamir, and his best friend, Rasheed. When [[Sheikh Abdullah]] is giving a sermon, he is forced to stop in the middle of his lecture, to ask two of the girls to stop talking. Kamala apologizes, and expresses how her lack of concentration is caused by the partition that separates them, causing Yusuf to turn around. He later seen converses with Rasheed, after their session in the mosque is over.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x02 - Crushed - Family Surround Kamala.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
During dinner, Yusuf talks about arriving to America, and Tyesha inquires about his family. He reveals that while his family lived in Karachi for many generations, Muneeba's family moved after the Partition of India. He then proceeds to tell the story of Muneeba's family, explaining that they had to go on the last train, leaving the city, and Muneeba's mother, [[Sana Ali|Sana]], who was just a toddler, got separated from her parents, but mysteriously returned to the train, just before it pulled out of the station, claiming she followed a trail of stars, that lead her back to her [[Hasan|father]]. He also adds that [[Aisha|Sana's mother]], was among those who disappeared, during the Partition. Following their conversation, Kamala suddenly faints, and Yusuf and the others gather round her, until she comes to.

Later that evening, Yusuf goes to check in on Kamala, and tries to open the door, but finds that its stuck. He manages to force it open, and finds Kamala in bed. He apologizes for waking her, and leaves.

On Eid, Yusuf discusses wedding prospects with Aamir, and suggests a cover band of Bon Jovi, seeing as how he's a fan. Tyesha arrives, and Yusuf becomes giddy, when she displays her knowledge on the musician. They all leave together, and head to the Eid Al-Adha festival, which takes place by their local mosque.

While Yusuf is eating, [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]] comes over, to wish him an Eid Mubarak. He returns the greetings, and Nakia campaigns for her vote for the Mosque Board. Yusuf informs her, his best friend Rasheed, is also running, but Nakia begins to make a case for herself, guilting Yusuf, of potentially robbing two women of their future, and also uses her relationship with Kamala. She hands him a badge and poster, to show his support for her, to Rasheed's confusion. 

Aamir and Tyesha's mendhi party is hosted in the Khan house. Yusuf is present, socializing with the various guests in attendance. He laughs at Aamir, when his son exits his room, after finding all his shoes have gone missing.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Yusuf with Fruit Pie.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Later that evening, Yusuf heads to Circle Q to buy some Hostess Cherry Fruit Pie. He greets Bruno, who is working behind the register, and notices some research papers, on the topic of Djinn. Bruno tries to put them away, but Yusuf insists on looking, and finds that they’re written in Urdu, which he can translate. The reports reads on a group of hidden Djinn, exiled from their home world, searching for the key to return home, which requires a primordial power.

The day of Aamir and Tyesha's wedding arrive, and his son has jitters while getting ready. Aamir discloses how he only has $732.49 in his savings account, and Yusuf advises he not worry, assuring him that he'll find his way after grad school. He talks of how Aamir should choose to live in love, rather than fear, and admires the courage his son displays, in choosing his family.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Yusuf and Muneeba.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Yusuf sits beside his son and watches as he gets married. A party is held at a venue, and the family take part in celebrations, including participating in a dance. Following this, the fire alarm is triggered, and Kamala is seen with a [[Clandestines|group]] of people who weren't invited to the wedding. The partygoers are escorted out of the building and Yusuf hears [[Auntie Zara|Zara]] claim that Kamala pulled the alarm. Yusuf and her family are unable to locate Kamala, and witness the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]] storm the building, and arrest the group that Kamala was seen with.

They eventually return home, waiting for Kamala, who arrives much later. Yusuf questions Kamala on what happened, but she can't provide any answers to her parents, to his disappointment, and he walks away.

Some time shortly after, Yusuf's mother-in-law, Sana, calls for Muneeba and Kamala to visit her, so the mother and daughter leave. Whilst the pair are abroad, Yusuf learns from his wife that Kamala is the masked super heroine of Jersey City, known as Night Light. 

Muneeba and Kamala return, and Kamala prepares to announce her secret to the rest of the family, but learns they're already aware. Yusuf is in awe of his daughter, but voices his concerns for her safety.

Later that evening, Yusuf is forwarded a video, published by Kamala's friend [[Zoe Zimmer|Zoe]] warning that [[Damage Control]] are targetting her superpowered friends, and have them surrounded.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x06 - No Normal - Scared Crowd.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The video prompts Yusuf, his family and other members of the community to arrive at Coles Academy High School, where the DODC are targeting Kamala. A young [[Kamran|boy]] comes out of the building, and after he refuses to comply with the DODC's instructions, the organisation fire at him. Yusuf witnesses his daughter shield the boy, as she create a barrier to protect him from gunfire. Yusuf urges Kamala to get out, but his voice is lost among the crowds cries. The DODC release a sonic device which emits a blast, throwing Kamala back. Yusuf screams for his daughter, but she rises back up, stronger than ever, with her powers in full effect. The powered boy attempts to throw a vehicle towards the DODC, but it ricochets off a car, and is thrown into the spectator’s direction. Before Yusuf and the others can come to any harm, Kamala uses her embiggened fists, to grab hold of it. The young boy’s power goes out of control and Kamala encloses a crystalline cage around them, neutralising him, until she is left alone, and the constructs created by the pair, disappear. Agent Deever orders for Damage Control to capture Kamala, but Yusuf and the others quickly surround Kamala. Before the agents can capture her, Kamala creates constructs in the air and leaves, prompting Yusuf and the others to cheer her on.

Later that evening, Yusuf finds his daughter sitting on the rooftop and joins her. He asks what her superhero alias is, but Kamala is still unable to answer. He tells his daughter that if she saves one life, she saves the world. He shares, how Muneeba and himself had difficulties in conceiving before she was born, and upon seeing her, they decided to give her name, which originates from the Arabic word "perfection", though is closer to "marvel" in Urdu. He declares her as their own little Ms. Marvel, and hands her, her domino mask. Kamala embraces her father, and the pair exchange love for each other. He watches on as his daughter creates platforms and walks on air, which he describes as absolute magic.

Yusuf doesn't appear within the film, but he is alluded to by his wife. When he was younger and living in Pakistan, he met [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] and the pair fall in love, much to the disapproval of Muneeba's mother. Yusuf proposed, but she couldn't stand to break her mother's heart, so refused his offer. Before departing, he decided to leave her a poem, which she shows to her mother, prompting a change of decision, and resulting in the young couple getting married a week later. They eventually move from Pakistan, and settle in [[New Jersey]], where they have two children.

Sometime later, Muneeba notices Kamala upset and recalls the story of how she and Yusuf married.
