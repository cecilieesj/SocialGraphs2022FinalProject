====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In [[2023]], a short period after the Blip, Sharon Davis attends a diner, and orders a drink. While she sits outside, she witnesses [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]], drive into town. A few moments later, Sharon becomes entrapped in [[Westview]], as the town and everything within, is transformed, into a black and white, 1950s sitcom. She is assigned the new identity of Mrs. Hart. Under this new persona, Sharon is aware of everything that happens, but has no control, and feels Wanda's pain. When she goes to sleep, she suffers from Wanda's nightmares. In this new life, she is still married to her husband, who has now been assigned the identity, of "[[Todd Davis|Arthur Hart]]".

Mrs. Hart attends a dinner, organised by her husband's employer and his wife, [[Vision]] and Wanda Maximoff. She makes a comment on the ambiance, and as Vision leaves, to fetch his wife, Wanda arrives in a negligee, and greets Mr. Hart, from the back, while covering his eyes, over her hands. When Vision turns on the light, he explains to Mr. and Mrs. Hart, it is part of her traditional [[Sokovia|Sokovian]] greeting. Mrs. Hart finds her to be exotic, and compliments her dress. As Wanda leaves to prepare the meal, she sits besides her husband, who is in discussion with Vision, on their workplace. As the two men continue, a clash of pots and pans can be heard in the kitchen, and Mrs. Hart offers to help, but Vision insists that everything is fine. When the same noise is heard again, Mrs. Hart heads towards the kitchen window, and as she opens it, Visions breaks into song, so Mrs. Hart dances along with him, and when she turns around, she finds the window has been closed again. Vision leads her towards the couch, and he starts a sing-along with Mrs. Hart to ''Ee-I-Ee-I-O'', while playing a ukulele. Wanda summons Vision to the kitchen, and Mrs. Hart greets the pair through the kitchen window, and Wanda returns the greetings, before abruptly closing it, and joining Mr. and Mrs. Hart. She hopes the pair are hungry, and Mrs. Hart discloses her head is beginning to feel whoozy. After various noisy disruptions, Mrs. Hart sits down, from her spinning head, and when Mr. Hart questions what they'll be eating, Wanda reveals the prepared meal behind them. When Mr. Hart finds she has made breakfast for dinner, and she quickly labels it as 'European', before he has the chance to say anything offensive. The four of them sit down together, and Mrs. Hart questions where they moved from, what brought them to Westview, how long have they've been married and why they don't have children yet. Wanda and Vision are unable to answer her questions, and Mr. Hart repeatedly asks why they arrived, but then finds himself choking, mid sentence. As he begins to do so, Mrs. Hart repeatedly tells him to stop it, with a smile on her face, in an almost trance-like state. She repeats these words as he falls on the floor. Vision manages to save her husband, using his abilities, and Mr. and Mrs. Hart, decide to leave, as if, unaware of what just transpired. She informs the two she had a lovely time, and sends her farewell, behind Wanda, whilst covering her eyes, the same way, Wanda entered. As they leave, Mrs. Hart compliments their lobster doorknocker.

The time period later moves into the 1960s. During a fundraiser talent show, Mrs. Hart can be seen amongst the audience, sitting alongside [[Agatha Harkness|Agnes]]. She witnesses Wanda and Vision's magic act, and watches as the two are crowned best comedic performance.

One day, while Mrs. Hart is out in town, Wanda appears, and suddenly, the true personas of the towns residents are restored. Mrs. Hart reverts backs to her true identity, of Sharon Davis, and approaches Wanda, alongside several other people. They all beg to be freed, and Sharon states that Wanda's grief is poisoning them. Wanda tries to assure the group that she is protecting them, but they all simultaneously beg to be freed. She screams at them to stop, releasing a burst of red [[magic]], and placing them all in a choke. Sharon falls to the ground, unable to breathe, alongside everyone else, and Wanda quickly undoes this. She pleads with Wanda, that if she won't let them go, let them die instead, and Wanda promises that she will free them. She begins lowering the Hex, surrounding Westview, and Sharon and everyone run to escape, but it is quickly brought back, before she has the chance to leave. A battle ensues in the sky, between Wanda, and Agatha Harkness, and once it's over, the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Before Wanda leaves, she makes her way in town to speak to [[Monica Rambeau]], and Sharon can be seen, amongst the various other townspeople, angrily staring at her, for the suffering she caused.
