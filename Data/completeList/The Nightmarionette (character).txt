'''The Nightmarionette''' is a one-time villain character from the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Hamster & Gretel]]''.
==Background==
===Physical appearance===
The Nightmarionette is shown to be a tall, dark-skinned man with no hair.
===Attire===
The Nightmarionette wears a long-sleeved, light purple shirt with dark purple sleeves, a sleeveless vest with three green buttons, dark purple pants and shoes.
==History==
Prior to being a supervillain, The Nightmarionette revealed that he was once a neo-scientist who was trying to figure out a way to read people's dreams via electromagnetic waves. However, the rest of the explanation was cut when the scene changed to [[Kevin Grant-Gomez|Kevin]] trying to find a parking space but later changed back when he revealed that his staff could project realistic holograms of people fear. As Hamster and Gretel attempt to attack him, The Nightmarionette uses his staff to create two holograms of Hamster and Gretel's fears (which are shown to be a scorpion with a toaster for a head and the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner). Luckily, Kevin arrived (after being unable to find a parking space) and rescued Hamster and Gretel from their fears.

The Nightmarionette then appeared on the news and used his Staff to give people more fears, including [[Veronica Hill]], whose fear is being a weather lady. Afterwards, he went to the Danville Gold Depository and used his staff to reveal the guards' fears as he plans to steal the gold. When Gretel arrived, The Nightmarionette tried to make her fear reappear, only to learn that she got over it thanks to Kevin and [[Fred (Hamster & Gretel)|Fred]]. He then raises the power of the staff to create another hologram of Gretel's fear, this time a lobster with a blender for a head. This led him to steal the gold while Gretel is facing her fear thanks to Kevin and his sock puppet.

Just then Hamster arrived and punched The Nightmarionette so hard, he flew into a building filled with very expensive harps, where an elderly couple are happy since he broke all their harps, and now he must pay for them.

==Trivia==
*A running gag in his appearance is that when he mentions his name, people (mostly Gretel) think that he's a puppet since a marionette is a puppet.
**After Gretel sees him in a building while being held up with some strings and thinks that that's how he got his name, he tried to explain that his name is actually a mashup like "Brunch", "Rom-Com" or even "mockumentary".
*The Nightmarionette has similar traits to the Batman villain Scarecrow, as both were scientists who invented something that revealed their victims' fears.
