}}The '''Fairy Godmother''' is a supporting character of the [[1997]] film ''[[Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella]]''.

==Role in the film==
After her [[Cinderella's Stepmother|stepmother]] and stepsisters, [[Calliope]] and [[Minerva]], pointedly flounce off to the ball without her, a dispirited [[Cinderella (1997 character)|Cinderella]] wishes harder than ever before to go. In answer, her Fairy Godmother suddenly appears at the window, stating that dreamers are silly because they never set out to achieve their dreams. 

The Fairy Godmother encourages Cinderella to make her wish come true but supports her by providing transportation in the form of a gilded [[Pumpkin Coach|pumpkin coach]], shapeshifted rats and mice as temporary servants, and a beautiful ballgown complete with a bejeweled tiara and [[Glass Slipper|glass slippers]]. Her hope renewed, she embraces her Fairy Godmother and eagerly rushes off into the coach, but not before her Fairy Godmother warns her that the magic will end at midnight. She happily muses on her good fortune as she makes her way to the palace with her Fairy Godmother along for the ride.

As the coach pulls up to the palace steps, the Fairy Godmother reassures Cinderella that she can handle this, but she'll have to do so alone if she wants her wish to come true. A while later, the sight of her stepmother advancing toward her frightens her into rushing back outside, begging to go back home. Her Fairy Godmother accuses her of giving up but provides moral support until she vanishes at [[Prince Christopher]]'s approach.

Once Cinderella returns home at midnight, she is treated especially cruelly by her stepmother, a sharp contrast to the bliss she experienced there. Unable to accept her stepfamily's harsh treatment much longer, she prays to her late father to help her find the strength to seek out a happier life. Her Fairy Godmother reappears at her misery and advises her to share her feelings with the prince, encouraging her to trust him to love her as she really is.

Once Prince Christopher and Cinderella are reunited, her Fairy Godmother gives them one last gift of elegant wedding clothes as she happily presides over their wedding.

== Trivia ==
* The Fairy Godmother is over six hundred years old.
