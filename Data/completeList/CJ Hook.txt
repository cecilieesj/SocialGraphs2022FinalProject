==Role in the film==
CJ appears in the animated series as [[Freddie Facilier|Freddie's]] best friend and partner-in-crime on the [[Isle of the Lost]]. In her first four appearances, she is only slightly seen in the shadows, peeking from behind curtains and reaching her hand out from under a table, behind a chair and kicking. After Freddie fulfilled her end of the bargain and helped her escape the island, she betrayed their arrangement by treating her as her minion instead of a partner. During the Neon Lights Ball, she sabotages the dance to rally the rest of the Villain Kids in a plot against Auradon, believing the villain children are destined to be better villains than their parents. When the VKs refuse to join her cause, CJ absconds on a magic carpet she stole from [[Jay (Descendants)|Jay]] and [[Carlos De Vil|Carlos]], though plots her return.

CJ reappears in "[[Options Are Shrinking]]" with [[Zevon]], helping him with his scheme to take over Auradon.

In "[[Celebration (Descendants: Wicked World)|Celebration]]", CJ seemingly shows up uninvited and looked as if she was going to ruin the Jewel-bilee. Instead, she encourages the VKs and AKs to get the show going, indicating that she might have decided to take a break from her evil-doing for the time being.  

==Trivia==
*In the ''[[The Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Isle of the Lost novel]]'' there is a character known as "Harriet" who is also the daughter of Captain Hook. In ''[[Descendants 2]]'' there is a character known as [[Harry Hook]] who is the son of Captain Hook. This was clarified in ''[[Rise of the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel|Rise of the Isle of the Lost]]'' that all three are siblings, with Harriet as the oldest, then Harry, and finally CJ being the youngest.
*CJ shares the same initials as her father's full name "Captain James Hook".
**Her full name, Calista Jane Hook, was revealed in ''Rise of the Isle of the Lost''.
*She is the fourth new character to appear in ''Descendants: Wicked World''.
*CJ was first introduced at the [[2016]] Toy Fair, announced by the Hasbro toy company.
*The face patterns on CJ's tights resemble the map of [[Neverland]] in ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.
*In the ''[[Escape from the Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel]]'', it is revealed that CJ was sent back to the Isle. Though she appears to not be bitter about it since she encouraged Harriet to go to the presentation about [[Auradon]] in the hopes that she would get picked.
