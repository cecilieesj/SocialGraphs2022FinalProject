'''Portlyn Maddison''' (Jillian Murray) is a co-star and antagonist in ''[[Mackenzie Falls]]''. She might play herself, or a character with the same name, but it is not known, for she haven't been on very many episodes. It is believed she plays [[Chad Dylan Cooper|Chad]]'s love interest on the drama. Chad says Portlyn will mysteriously disappear in a ballooning incident.

==Personality==
In her first appearance, she and Chad were filming a scene for ''Mackenzie Falls''. Later in the episode she and all other cast members competed in musical chairs against ''[[So Random!]]''. She is proved to not be very bright, as when she revealed Chad's plan to keep the ''So Random!'' cast fighting with each other so ''Mackenzie Falls'' could stay number one. She didn't mean to ruin his plan, but apparently, she didn't know that was a secret to the ''So Random!'' cast. And then Chad told her to "not talk without a script". In "West Coast Story" while competing in musical chairs, Portlyn almost lost, but Nico offered her his chair, because he was nice to the lady, which he regretted a second later. She is next seen in "Sonny at the Falls" at the end of it she reveals the plan to keep ''Mackenzie Falls'' the number one show.

Portlyn is from Lynchburg/Roanoke, [[Virginia]].

==Physical appearance==
Portlyn is often seen wearing the trendy ''Mackenzie Falls ''uniforms on set. She is thin and fit, and Sonny tells her "You have great legs, let's see how they move." She has long dark brown curly hair and fair skin. She wears preppy clothing and accessories, such as pearls, and has a clear complexion and classic beauty.
