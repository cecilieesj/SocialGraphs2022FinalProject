'''Ralph Bohner''' is a supporting character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], featured in the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[WandaVision]]''. He lived in [[Westview]] next to what would have been the home of [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision]]. He was placed under the thrall of [[Agatha Harkness]], who initially claimed him to be her husband, before having him pose as Wanda's deceased brother, '''[[Quicksilver|Pietro Maximoff]]'''. He was first mentioned in the [[Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience|first episode]], and made his debut in the [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]]. He is portrayed by Evan Peters.

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[WandaVision]]''====
In the [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]] of the series, "Pietro" arrives with an American accent much like Wanda's. The fact that the role was recast is referenced in the episode. He rings her door, and asks if he can give her a hug. Wanda looks at him in shock, before embracing him, and when he sees Vision, she refers to him as a "popsicle" and questions who he is.

In the [[All-New Halloween Spooktacular!|sixth episode]], it is revealed that this "Pietro" has the memories of the original (including his death) and is fully aware of how he looks different. "Pietro" tells Wanda that he only remembers being shot on the street and later hearing her calling him, which caused him to come to [[Westview]] as he knew his sister needed him. He is also aware of how the world of Westview is deliberately made to resemble a sitcom, with him playing the role of the man-child uncle that gives Wanda grief, as well as how Wanda appears to be in control of everything. Wanda questions what happened to his accent, to which "Pietro" points out that Wanda does not have her normal accent either. While he is talking to Wanda, she briefly has a vision of his corpse with bullet wounds, reminding her of his death. When Billy senses that [[Vision]] is dying outside of Westview, "Pietro" comments that it's not as though Vision can die twice. This angers Wanda, who uses her magic to throw him across the town square.

In the [[Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision)|seventh episode]], [[Billy Maximoff|Billy]] and [[Tommy Maximoff|Tommy]] ask Wanda what "Pietro" meant when he said about re-killing Vision, but Wanda tells them not to believe in anything that "Pietro" said because he is not their real uncle. As the twins are confused by this and ask who "Pietro" is, Wanda replies that she does not have all the answers. While talking with [[Darcy Lewis]], Vision also asks who is the imposter "Pietro", and Darcy replies she does not know. At the end of the episode, Wanda's next door neighbor Agnes is revealed to be a witch named [[Agatha Harkness]] and she is the one responsible for bringing this version of "Pietro" to Westview. During a post-credit scene, "Pietro" re-appears and catches [[Monica Rambeau]] while she is trying to enter the basement of Vision and Wanda's house to go after Wanda.

In the [[Previously On|eighth episode]], Agatha reveals that the "fake Pietro", or "Fietro" as she puts it, is an actual person who was the result of a "crystalline possession" who acted as her eyes and ears. She explains that she would not be able to manipulate the real Pietro with necromancy and bring him to Westview, because he is on another continent and "full of holes" and her magic has limits. 

In the [[The Series Finale|final episode]], "Pietro" is revealed to be an actor living in Westview named '''Ralph Bohner''', the continuously mentioned husband of Agnes, who is actually the real owner of the house Agnes was living during the sitcom and is being mind-controlled by her to act as her lackey. Monica manages to flip him and removes his necklace, which had been controlling him this entire time, and he reverts to normal, begging her to be spared.

==Trivia==
*Evan Peters, who posed as Quicksilver, also portrayed another version of him, in the ''X-Men'' franchise.
**The actors who portray the two Quicksilvers (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Evan Peters) appeared together in the movie ''Kick-Ass'', which was a superhero movie based on a comic book by Icon, an imprint of Marvel Comics.
***This was referenced, in the [[All-New Halloween Spooktacular!|sixth]] ''[[WandaVision]]'' episode.
*The costume Ralph wears for Halloween. in the sixth episode of ''Wandavision'', resembles Quicksilver's comic book costume.
*The character's reveal in the final episode was based on the famous twist from ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' wherein the [[Xu Wenwu|Mandarin]] is revealed to be an actor named [[Trevor Slattery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/marvelsheriff/status/1368951433060622344?s=21|website=Twitter|title=This is what Matt Shakman, the director of WandaVision, had to say about the Ralph Bohner twist.|date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>
*The revelation that "Pietro" is actually an actor named Ralph Bohner has a double meaning. Upon Monica learning his name, Ralph chuckles at his surname which sounds like "Boner", which typically refers to someone who has an erection. However, the word also means a goof up or a punchline. This could be a reference to the fact that his character, should one be watching the series for the first time, misleads the audience into thinking that he is Quicksilver of the ''X-Men'' films, only to be fooled that he is simply an actor who exists within the MCU.
**Additionally, his name is also a reference to Richard "Boner" Stabone from ''Growing Pains'' which director Matt Shakman starred in as a child.
