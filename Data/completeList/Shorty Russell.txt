== Role ==
When Moki returns from shooting the wolves, he tells Colonel Pierson about seeing Wahb. He admits to having rescued Wahb when he was a cub. Colonel Pierson is surprised by this revelation, but, although he isn't necessarily happy about it, he isn't upset with Moki. Soon after, Wahb has a run-in with Shorty. Shorty is out setting fence when he encounters Wahb. Although Wahb is in a curious mood and doesn't attack Shorty, Shorty is terrified and returns to the ranch with a vivid tale of how he survived a ferocious grizzly.

Later, as Wahb creates a stampede of cattle, Shorty runs over to a cowboy cook named Slim and they shoot at Wahb. After Shorty runs out of bullets, Wahb pushes Slim's chuck wagon into a river.
