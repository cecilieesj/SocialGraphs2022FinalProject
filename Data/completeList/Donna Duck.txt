==History==
[[File:Daisy Donna.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Daisy (named Donna) in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #1]]
The history of Daisy in animation can be traced to the appearance of her precursor Donna Duck in the cartoon short ''[[Don Donald]]'' (first released on [[January 9]], [[1937]]), directed by Ben Sharpsteen. The plot had Donald courting Donna somewhere in [[Mexico]]. Donald rides a donkey and lets Donna also ride it, but unfortunately, Donna hates the animal. Angered at blowing his chances with Donna, Donald trades in his burro for [[313|a flashy red car]]. Donna loves the car – until it breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and Donna drives away on her unicycle, leaving Donald.

The short is important for introducing a romantic interest for Donald. But one should note that Donna had little in common with Daisy other than both being female ducks and sharing a temper. Donna was more or less a female version of Donald both in design and voice. Her voice was provided by [[Clarence Nash]] and was a slightly higher version of that of Donald (Daisy had the same voice in her official debut, ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''). Donna was not intended as a recurring character and the Donald shorts of the following three years featured no female companion for him.

In ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #1 (published in 1940), Daisy Duck is named Donna in an image that appears based on ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''. The image contains Donald and Daisy, with the text "Donald's got a girl! —and Donna thinks that HE'S just dandy. Because his heart is full of—candy!"

Donna returned in [[Bob Karp]]'s Donald Duck daily strips from [[1951]], where she's a Mexican lady moving in as Donald's neighbor, causing Daisy to be jealous. This establishes the two as separate characters and marks the first time they appear together in a story.

Donna reappeared in a [[2012]] comic by Lars Jensen and Carlos Mota, called ''Too Many Donalds''. In this story, Donna visits [[Duckburg]] together with her new boyfriend [[Whitewater Duck]], Donald's distant cousin.

Confusingly, in spite of the above-mentioned comics showing Donna to be a separate character from Daisy, various other Disney products, such as the book ''[[Disney Dossiers: Files of Characters From the Walt Disney Studios]]'' and the ''Walt Disney Cartoon Classics: Starring Donald and Daisy'' VHS, refer to Donna and Daisy as being one and the same.
