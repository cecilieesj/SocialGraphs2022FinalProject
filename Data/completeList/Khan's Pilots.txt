'''Khan's Pilots''' are the squadron of [[Shere Khan#TaleSpin|Shere Khan]]. They provide the backbone of [[Khan Industries]]' air force of [[Khan Transport]]s.

Skilled aviators, dedicated workers, and loyal employees, Khan pilots carry out their assignments with great efficiency and effectiveness. They are universally, though sometimes grudgingly, acknowledged by peers and rivals alike as some of the finest corporate airmen in the skies.
