Zara attends the Eid Al-Adha festival, held by their local mosque and is amongst the company of her friends, who [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]] dubs the "Illumin-Aunties", a group of women who are in the know all regarding local business and affairs.

[[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] joins the group in conversation, and when the evening arrives she inquires about her great-grandmother, Aisha, to the fellow aunties. Zara informs Kamala that her family knew Aisha, and the many people who did, probably wish they hadn't. Kamala asks for further explanation, and Zara praises Kamala's mother, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]], who didn't deserve the shame that Aisha brought onto her family. The aunties discuss the various rumors surrounding Aisha, and Zara mentions she heard of Aisha's secret affair and taking off with someone. While talking, [[Auntie Ruby|Ruby]] adds that she heard Aisha murdered someone during the partition, to the shock of Zara. In the midst of their conversation, Zara and the others are alterted to the screams of a young boy, and find that he is hanging by a curtain attatched to a rail, from the window of the mosque tower. She and the others in attendance, rush in the young boy's direction. A young masked heroine, dubbed "Night Light" appears and Zara witnesses her create energy platforms in the air, and walk in young [[Hameed]]'s direction. He falls before she can reach him, but the she creates a construct in the middle of the air, which the boy lands on. The heroine runs over to him, causing Haumaira and the others to cheer, at his rescue. She and the others celebrates his safety, but before he can climb off the platform and onto the roof, it shatters, and Zara looks in horror, as the boy falls onto the hood of a car, with his impact slightly broken by constructs that Night Light created.

Zara attends her the wedding of Muneeba's son, [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]]. While in the venue, she witnesses Kamala pull the fire alarm, leading all the wedding guests to be escorted out. Once she and the others exit the building, Zara tells them what she saw Kamala do, but Ruby is dismissive of her, and cites her declining eye sight as an execuse for her statement being false.
