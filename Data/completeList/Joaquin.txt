Since he's also dedicated dancer who teaches tango, Joaquin charms the "meow" out of Dorinda Thomas. They form a special friendship, making the summer in Barcelona one the Cheetahs will never forget. His godfather is Luc.

==Background==
Not much is know about Joaquin, except that he is from centuries of Spanish nobility. He also teaches tango lessons.

==Events==
===The Cheetah Girls 2===
The day after the Cheetahs arrive in Spain, they go to have breakfast, they meet Joaquin an accountant, Luc's godson, and a handsome dancer who becomes a love interest for Dorinda . The next day after Dorinda finds out Joaquin is a dancer, she goes to his studio, where he teaches her tango ("[[Dance with Me]]").

That night Joaquin takes the Cheetahs to the Dancing Cat, a local Spanish night club where all the new artists perform their songs ("Why Wait") ("A La Nanita Nana").

The Cheetahs start to break up.

Right before Chanel is going to get changed to perform with [[Marisol Duran|Marisol]], the Festival Director informs that the Cheetah Girls are able to perform after getting a tip. Everyone is surprised when they see that the informer was his nephew, [[Angel (The Cheetah Girls)|Angel]]. He informed that Lola tried to sabotage the Cheetahs, and his uncle reinstates the girls as the Cheetah Girls. Lola tries to dispute, but the Director will not hear it. Marisol finally tells off her mother, saying she is quitting the competition because she loves to sing and her mother is just desperate to make her a star. The Cheetah Girls then perform "Amigas Cheetahs", and as a surprise, bring Marisol onto the stage, along with Joaquin's dancing crew, Angel on the guitar and the Director on the trumpet. Their song is a hit with the crowd.
