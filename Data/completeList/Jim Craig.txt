=== ''The Man from Snowy River'' ===
After the death of his father, proud young Jim Craig sets out to become his own man. Taking a job with horse rancher Harrison, Craig is treated poorly by the more experienced cowboys but wins the heart of the rancher's daughter, Jessica, when he helps her break a high-strung colt and later saves her life. When he's unfairly blamed for the loss of an expensive horse, Craig fights to restore his honor and prove that he's worthy of Jessica's hand.

=== ''[[Return to Snowy River]]'' ===
Jim Craig, accompanied by his herd of Australian horses, returns to his hometown of Snowy River to be with his love, Jessica. However, Harrison, steadfastly opposes their relationship, preferring Alistair Patton, an egotistical banker's son, as a potential suitor. When Patton learns Jessica wants to be with Jim, he sets out to steal Jim's prized horses.
