==Mighty Ducks==
Mallory is a gung-ho fighter on Wildwing's team who generally hates machines, though she is very handy with the Puckblaster. Her tough exterior hides a soft side, however. A fiery redhead, and a temper to match. Mallory is well-learned in Puckworld's version of the martial arts, although most of the time she is content with just using a Puck Blaster. She has a sharp tongue and usually directs it towards [[Nosedive Flashblade|Nosedive]]'s immature acts, or anything that she feels is "out of line." 

With her strong military background as a member of the "Puckworld Special Forces," she often thinks in black and white, a strict disciplinarian, and has high regard for the chain of command. She's stubborn, which can be a fault as much as a strength. Her jersey number is 15.


==Trivia==
* Mallory greatly resembles an adult version of [[Gosalyn Mallard]].
