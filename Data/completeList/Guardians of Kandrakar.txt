[[File:WITCHSymbols.png|thumb|The Symbols of the Guardians]]
The '''Guardians of Kandrakar''' are a group of five, magical warriors chosen to protect [[Kandrakar]], the center of the universe. Each Guardian rules over one the basic natural elements of Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. The leader rules over Energy or Quintessence, and controls the [[Heart of Kandrakar]], the magical pendant that allows the Guardians to transform into their superhero alter egos by channeling the power of the Aurameres.

In the first season of the [[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|animated series]], the Guardians were named the '''Guardians of the Veil'''. Later in the second season, they were referred to as the '''Guardians of the Infinite Dimensions'''.

When the Guardians transform, their appearance is similar to that of fairies. However, except the Guardian of Air, they could not fly, despite having wings. In the TV series, all five Guardians could fly.

Before striking their ending poses during the transformations, all guardians call out the names of their elements, except Will, who says 'Keeper' in the first season and 'The Heart' in the second season.
