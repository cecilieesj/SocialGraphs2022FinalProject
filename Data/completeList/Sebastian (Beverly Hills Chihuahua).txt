==History==
In the first two films, he was a minor character. In the first film, he was seen interacting with [[Chloe]]. Later, he and his friends were at a party, wondering where Chloe was and that the party was going on a magazine. In the second film, he was seen eating cake at [[Papi]] and Chloe's doggy wedding.

In the third film, he is more of a supporting character. Throughout some of the film, he helped Papi plan [[Rosa]]'s fiesta for her sweet 15 (in dog years). Sebastian auditioned different bands and adored some of them, though Papi was displeased with all of them, until they both found the right one. Later, Papi informed him that he was suspicious of [[Oscar (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Oscar]]'s hidden agenda involving [[Jenny (Beverly Hills Chihuahua)|Jenny]]. In the end, he was seen at the party with everyone else
