He likes to dance (hence his name), owns a portable telescope, and likes riding on the Ski Lift. He appears in most [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_Missions Secret Missions] and he gives players a thank-you card at the end of Mission 3, as an optional reward. The main reason in why he usually appears in Secret Missions is usually as a "side-mission" or "subplot", like having to fix his telescope or unjam the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Ski_Lift Ski Lift]. As of the mission called [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/The_Veggie_Villain The Veggie Villain], he currently needs glasses to see.

==Involvement in Missions==

*Mission 1 - His telescope breaks, he cries and it gets fixed by a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_agent secret agent] from the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/P.S.A. P.S.A.]
*Mission 3 - He cries and tells a [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_agent secret agent] that the power in the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Night_Club Dance Club] has gone out.
*Mission 4 - He cries because he wants to ride the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Ski_Lift Ski Lift], but it's broken.
*Mission 7 - At the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Ski_Village Ski Village], his snowman breaks and he cries about it, and he finds out the best snow in [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Island Club Penguin] is at the [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Snow_Forts Snow Forts].
*Mission 11 - He breaks his glasses when he sat on them and cries about it, and when you fix them he says he will tell all of his friends about you and then [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Dot Dot the Disguise Gal] sends you the present saying you helped one of her friends.
Oddly enough, he cries in every [http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_Missions mission] he appears in, and it's because of something that broke. Some penguins believe everything breaks because he has "Bad luck" all the time.
==Involvement in The Elite Penguin Force Missions==
*Alien Conspiracy - He asks you to help him decode several messages written in the snow. He later reveals that this was a test, and that he was watching you.
