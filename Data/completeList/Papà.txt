'''Papà''' is a character from the [[2012]] Disney/Pixar animated short, ''[[La Luna]]''. He serves as [[Bambino]]'s father and Nonno's son who helps his family look for the moon at night.

==Role in the short==

Papà is first seen rowing across the ocean on a quiet night alongside Nonno and his son [[Bambino]] where he and Nonno disagree with each other upon trying to get Bambino's hat straight. Seeing the moon below above them, he grabs a ladder for his family to climb to which when Bambino climbs up, he and Nonno observe Bambino reaching the moon as Nonno tells him to continue further. Suddenly, Bambino feels no gravity while at the top of the moon. Arriving there, Papà tells his son that he will rescue him to get him back on their boat to which upon grabbing the anchor, Bambino notices a shooting star pass by as he touches it, Papà and Nonno suddenly arrive on the moon. Papà enters a cabin to get the cleaning supplies out to which he tasks his son to clear away the stars just like him. Noticing Papà arguing with Nonno, their argument stops upon noticing a shooting star landing on the moon.

Seeing a bigger star, the two cooperate to get it out but they have trouble getting it out. Bambino suddenly touches the star and as the two notice their son climbing on top, Bambino hits it with his tiny hammer to which the big star shatters into regular-sized stars as the two react to the stars falling on the moon to which the two see their son who is safe in joy. Papà and his family work together in sweeping away the stars just before returning to their boat. Suddenly, Papà and his family later observe the half moon at night after an adventure on the moon.

==Trivia==
*Papà is based on director [[Enrico Casarosa]]'s father.
*In the [[2021]] Disney/Pixar film, ''[[Luca]]'', the character of [[Massimo Marcovaldo]] has a striking resemblance to Papà. Both, '' La Luna'' and ''Luca'' are directed by Enrico Casarosa.
