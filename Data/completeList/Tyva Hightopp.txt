'''Tyva Hightopp''' is a character featured in the [[2016]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] live-action film ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''. She is [[Tarrant Hightopp]]'s mother.

==Background==
Prior to her disappearance during Horunvendush Day, Tyva lived with her husband Zanik before she and the rest of the Hightopps felt disappointed during the failed coronation of Iracebeth, much to her husband believing that Witzend laments the failed coronation between Iracebeth and Mirana.

During the Horunvendush Day event, it is revealed that Tyva did not die along with the rest of her family but rather kidnapped by a group of Armored Cards to which she was later shrunk into the size of an ant along with the rest of her family on Iracebeth's childhood ant farm. When Tarrant finally finds his family, Tyva and the rest of the missing family members happily reunite with him in enthusiasm.

==Role in the film==
When [[Alice Kingsleigh|Alice]] travels to the past Toomalie Day event at the town of Witzend, Tyva is present attending the coronation of [[Red Queen|Iracebeth]] while her husband Zanik prepares to place a crown on jer in a plan for her to be queen of Underland to which as the crown cannot fit her head, it ultimately shatters, much to the crowd's reaction as [[King Oleron and Queen Elsemere|King Oleron]] tells Iracebeth that she is unfit to rule [[Underland]], much to her insults to the citizens of Witzend, causing [[White Queen|Mirana]] to rule instead, much to Iracebeth's prejudice as she seeks revenge against Tarrant's family. After Iracebeth and Mirana leave, Zanik tells his son that he disgraced the Hightopp family for costing Iracebeth her crown, causing disappointment to Tarrant throughout his life, much to his mother Tyva's worry as Tarrant sadly leaves in sorrow for the disgrace he did.

Alice then approaches Tyva and her husband leaving the church just as Princess Mirana apologizes to him for the incident she had with her sister to which Zanik explains that all of Witzend laments the day during the incident between her and Iracebeth. At the past Fell Day event, Tyva enters her husband's workshop where she talks with her husband about making hats being a serious business just before Alice leaves his workshop just as she briefly observes Zanik working on Tarrant's discarded hat, giving Alice an idea of Tarrant's missing family as it is shown that the names of the Hightopp family are not seen in the Underlandians Deceased section but rather missing. During the Horunvendush Day event, Tyva and the rest of her family end up getting ambushed by the [[Jabberwocky (2010)|Jabberwocky]] and a group of [[Armored Cards]] surrounding them and capturing them as the town of Witzend is on fire as the festival is ruined. Alice then recognizes that the Hightopp family is not dead but rather captured by the Red Queen as Alice decides to return to the present.

Tyva and the rest of Tarrant's family are shrunk into the size of ants just as Alice finds the family members for him, much to the Red Queen's fury. As the Red Queen causes a catastrophe across Underland, Tyva and the rest of the Hightopp family end up getting engulfed in time rust along with everyone else in Underland. With the [[Chronosphere]] back in place, the Hightopp family is brought back to life along with everyone caught in time rust. Tarrant then sprinkles some [[Upelkuchen]] on Tyva and the rest of Tarrant's family to help restore Tarrant's family back to normal size, just as Tyva is happy to see her son back as Tarrant happily reunites with his family in joy just before Alice leaves.
