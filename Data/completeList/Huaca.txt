{{Quote 2|“Carved from the ancient magical stone of the sacred mountain, this little figure has been the counselor and protector of every emperor since day one. He has a grand estimation of his own worth but is a tireless servant to the throne, ensuring that all runs smoothly in the empire. If only humans weren't so fallible! He has weight and dignity despite his diminutive stature ”|Official character description from ''Kingdom of the Sun'' production notes}}

'''Huaca''', sometimes spelled '''Hucua''', was a talking talisman who was an ally of [[Yzma]], and a considered antagonist in ''Kingdom of the Sun'', the alternate working title of ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''. 

He was once [[Kuzco|Manco]]'s advisor, but after getting tired of the young emperor refusing to listen to him, he went to work with the sorceress. He also appeared to be a stickler for tradition as in one deleted scene, he reprimanded Pacha, who switched places with Manco early on, for allowing a Llama to go free instead of letting it be sacrificed to bring the sun. The sun then comes up anyway.

While he didn't appear in the film when the film was retooled into ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', a reference to him is placed at the beginning of the dinner scene, where his likeness is used in the statue holding the candles. His role as Yzma's sidekick is given to [[Kronk]].

==Trivia==
*Sting wrote a song for him that was a parody of "Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?" from My Fair Lady, entitled "Why Can't a Human Be More Like a Rock?"
*Prior to the casting of [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Garry Marshall]] and [[Peter Ustinov]] were considered to voice him.
*Huaca's name means an object that is honored in the Quechuan languages of South America.
