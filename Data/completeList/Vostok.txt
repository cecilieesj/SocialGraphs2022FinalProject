}}'''Vostok''' is a character and antagonist from the ''[[PKNA]]'' comic book series.

==History==
Vostok is a scientist who works for [[Organization (PKNA)|The Organization]]. He dislikes [[Newton (PKNA)|Newton]] due to his lack of tact and diplomacy, and often sees himself forced to work with the droid, who dislikes him equally.

In issue #43, Vostok was arrested by the Time Police along with the senior leaders of the Organization. He's presumably placed in a cronocapsule in the prison Time Ã˜ to serve his sentence for numerous crimes.
