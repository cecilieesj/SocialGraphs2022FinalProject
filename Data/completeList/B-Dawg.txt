'''B-Dawg''' is a young golden retriever puppy who appears, along with his siblings, in the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' film series]].

==History==
B-Dawg enjoys musical hip-hop, bling, and rap. He wears a silver chain necklace with the letter "B" on it and usually ends his sentences with "dawg." His catchphrase is: "I am the ultimate P-U-P!" 

He is constantly trying to show off, and tries to convince everyone around him that he is brave, when he actually is terrified of many things. When talking to his siblings or his mom, he always uses slang, which often perplexes them. 

He is sometimes rebellious, as shown in [[Air Buddies|the first Air Buddies film]] when he said, "No one tells B-Dawg he has to take a nap," after Mrs. Niggles told the Air Buddies to rest. He lives in Fernfield, [[Washington]], with his famous all-star father, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], and mother, [[Molly (Air Bud)|Molly]]. His owner is Billy, a boy who is into music and dancing.

==Trivia==
*In the Air Buddies poster, he is seen wearing sunglasses. However, he does not wear them at all in the live-action movies. The same is true pertaining to the poster for the [[Treasure Buddies|sixth film]].
* Notably, B-Dawg retained his original voice actor longer than any other Buddy, as Skyler Gisondo voiced him from [[2006]] to [[2012]].
*In the first film instalment, B-Dawg was introduced the audience second, after Budderball. This implies that B-Dawg is second born. This may be, in part, why B-Dawg appears to always be trying to fight to the top.
