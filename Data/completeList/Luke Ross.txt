==Character History==
===Season 1===
In "New York, New Nanny", he meets Jessie and instantly develops a crush on her. He tries many ways to impress her, including voting yes when she is considered to be the new nanny, dressing up in a tux, giving her roses, having a dinner made for them, and asking her on a date. To get Jessie's attention, he and his three siblings run away in their parents' helicopter. He also attends Emma's science fair with Jessie.

In "The Talented Mr. Kipling", he is assigned as partners with Emma for a school assignment for their photography class. 
In "Used Karma", he starts pulling pranks on Ravi. Annoyed by this, Ravi gets back at him. Luke learns his lesson when Ravi gets back at him by pulling pranks on him and convincing him they happened because of his bad karma. In "Zombie Tea Party 5", he teams up with Jessie to beat his rival at a paintball game.

In "One Day Wonders", he performs in the park with Jessie. He dances while Jessie plays guitar and sings a song that she wrote.

In "Creepy Connie Comes a Callin", he gets a new math tutor, Connie, who was hired by Jessie. Jessie thinks Connie will be the perfect example to Luke until she finds out that Connie has an obsessive crush on him.

In "A Christmas Story", he helps Jessie and the Ross kids decorate their penthouse for Christmas and tries to get Jessie to kiss him under the mistletoe. He later goes to the mall and temporarily ends up in toy jail with Jessie and Emma because of an angry elf. At the end of the episode, he kisses Jessie on the cheek in surprise, just after she wakes up and before the family takes a picture.

In "Star Wars", he looks through Jordan Taylor's suitcase with Zuri and they find his cell phone and start prank-calling celebrities from his contact list.

In "Are You Cooler Than a 5th Grader?", he helps Ravi through his first day at Luke and Emma's school. Ravi ends up embarrassing Luke in front of his friends.

==Relationships==
===Jessie===
Luke has an extremely big crush on Jessie. Throughout the show, he constantly tries to hit on Jessie, as many times as possible. Due to being an air-head he usually misunderstands the idea that Bertram and Jessie are either acting or pretending to be a couple. He even gets creepy when it's revealed by Luke that he saved a DVD video of Jessie hanging out at the beach and that he placed a camera in Jessie's room to spy on her, however, Jessie found out about it and placed a note saying that he's a pig.

===[[Emma Ross]]===
Emma is Luke's older sister that fights with him a lot, even though they fight, they still have some fun adventures together. She usually doesn't enjoy hanging out with Luke, because of his repulsive and air-headed personality. While their relationship is somewhat antagonistic in the early episodes, the two soften up towards each other as the series progresses.

===[[Ravi Ross]] (Best Friend)===
Ravi is Luke's younger brother adopted from India and his best friend. Luke enjoys pulling pranks on Ravi, but they do share a good brotherly/friendly relationship. But, usually either manipulates him throughout his intelligence or constantly insults him about him not being able to get girls, being a nerd, never winning anything, or being nonathletic.

===[[Zuri Ross]]===
Zuri is Luke's younger sister adopted from Africa. They appear to have a good brother-sister relationship, as they both enjoy pulling pranks or making schemes.

===Morgan and Christina Ross===
They are the adoptive parents of Luke Ross. He was adopted by them at the age of 5. Morgan one time told Luke that he's from Krypton, however only said it as a joke, to which he never told Luke that was actually a joke, making him believe that he was actually from Krypton. Later on, he now understands that he's not really from Krypton.
