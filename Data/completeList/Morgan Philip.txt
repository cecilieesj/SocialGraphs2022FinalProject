'''Morgan Philip''' is a supporting character in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[2007]] hybrid film ''[[Enchanted]]''. She is the daughter of [[Robert Philip]], stepdaughter of [[Giselle]] and half-sister of [[Sophia Philip]].

==Background==
Morgan is [[Robert Philip]]'s imaginative 6-year-old daughter. She befriends Giselle and is not sure how she feels about the initial thought of her dad marrying [[Nancy Tremaine|Nancy]].

===Personality===
Morgan is an outgoing 6-year-old who is not afraid to speak her mind about Nancy to her father. Even though Giselle is a stranger to her at first, she speaks to her without being shy. She, however, is shy at the beginning of the movie.

===Physical appearance===
At 6 years old in [[Enchanted|the first movie]], Morgan is small and slender with brown hair and eyes, fair skin, and rosy cheeks. In [[Disenchanted|the second movie]], Morgan is a 16-year-old teenager.

==Appearances==
===''[[Enchanted]]''===
Morgan Philip likes the woman ([[Nancy Tremaine]]) that [[Robert Philip|her father]] is dating, but she does not consider her as the mother material type. When [[Giselle]]Â comes to the real world, Morgan immediately befriends her. Later, she starts to show tearful expressions when Giselle leaves. She even takes Giselle on a shopping spree with her father's credit card so that she can go to the King and Queen's Ball that is being held in New York City. Morgan is later seen after Giselle and Robert are a couple, dancing with her father and new stepmother.

===''[[Disenchanted]]''===
A teenage Morgan appears in this movie, now portrayed by Gabriella Baldacchino.
