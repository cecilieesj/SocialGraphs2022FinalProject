'''The Spine Chief''' is a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film, ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''. He is the chief of [[Spine]] in [[Kumandra]].

==Background==
===Physical Appearances===
The Spine Chief is an Southeast-Asian man who wears the grey color scheme clothing of his Kumandra tribe, Spine.

=== Personality ===
The Spine Chief appeared to be a very strong and easily intimidating person, and (like all other chiefs) had a strong distrust of the other lands. He also appeared to be aggressive and hot-tempered, since he was quick to lose his cool during the clans' meeting. He seems to view the Dragon Gem as more of a weapon than a sacred artifact, hinting more towards his personality as a warrior of Spine.

==Appearances==
===''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''===
The Spine Chief first appears when he and some of his tribe members attend the gathering of all of the tribe members of Kumandra at [[Heart (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Heart]], which [[Chief Benja]] hopes will make the Tribes be unified. At first, everything goes well, but when the Princess of the [[Fang (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Fang]] Tribe, [[Namaari]] tries to steal the gem and it soon leads to the gem breaking, resurrecting the [[Druun]] and The Spine Chief takes a piece back to his land where soon, the Druun attacked and only one spine soldier, [[Tong]] managed to survive.

6 years later, the Heart Tribe Princess [[Raya]], Tong, Namaari and a whole bunch of others managed to fix the orb and re-banish the orbs and bring everyone who was encased in stone back to life, including the Spine Chief.
