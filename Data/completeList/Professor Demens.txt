'''Professor Demens''' is a supposed ancestor of [[Professor Dementor]], featured from the ''[[Kim Possible]]'' episode "[[Rewriting History]]".

==Notes==
*As with ''everything depicted in the episode'', except the final few moments after [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]] wake to discover it was all a dream, it is highly questionable if Professor Demens was "real".
