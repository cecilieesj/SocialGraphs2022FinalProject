Najaf is greeted by [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] and her mother [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]], from his food truck, while the pair are running errands. He acknowledges the two, and briefly inquires about Muneeba's wellbeing. He makes conversation, complaining about the changing scope of the neighborhood, with the rich buying up the land, and Kamala wonders if that means they may get a Halal Guys, nearby, but Najaf reminds her, that they charge for extra sauce.

He agrees to give her his vote, if she agrees to make him the exclusive catering vendor, for all masjid holidays and special events. She agrees to do so, and hands him a poster of herself, which he places on the window his food truck.

That evening, Najaf and the others are attendees of the festival are alerted to the screams of a young boy, and find that he is hanging by a curtain, attached to a rail, from the window of the mosque tower. As he screams for help, Najaf points that Night Light, a local superhero, is approaching Hameed. He watches as the the heroine tries to calm young Hameed's nerves by distracting him, and the pair talk his favorite food, which he mentions is a combination of ice cream on pizza, to Najaf's confusion. When the rail breaks, Hameed falls, but Night Light manages to create an energy construct, which the two land atop of, mid-air. Najaf and the others give a round of applause for Night Light's heroics, but before Hameed can safely climb onto the roof, the construct shatters. Night Light manages to create smaller constructs below him, as he descends, to cushion his fall, but nonetheless, he drops onto the hood of a car, injured. Najaf and the others in crowd proceed to gather around him.
