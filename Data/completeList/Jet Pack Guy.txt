'''Jet Pack Guy''' has been a secret agent for the Penguin Secret Agency and the [[Elite Penguin Force]]. Jet Pack Guy is probably not his real name, but his code name, similar to [[Rookie]]. He always wears "Super Spy Gear", and always carries a Jet Pack, hence his name. Jet Pack Guy has been seen with his sunglasses lifted, revealing his eyes, but he has not been seen without his sunglasses.

==History==
Jet Pack Guy debuted in Secret Mission 2: G's Secret Mission. The sound of his jet pack's fuel wakes you up on the second day in the Wilderness. [[Gary the Gadget Guy|Gary]] had sent him to track you down and bring you back to the HQ. Originally, he was just supposed to be a random agent that came to rescue you by jet pack, but soon became a permanent agent.

He returned in Mission 10, joining Gary's plan to capture [[Herbert P. Bear]]. His Jet Pack crashed at the Beach, however, with a mixture of [[w:c:clubpenguin:Cream Soda|cream soda]] and [[w:c:clubpenguin:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]], the jet pack was able to be refueled. Later he was fooled by [[Klutzy]] into thinking Herbert was at the Dock due to the crab's fake polar bear cut-out. Then he helped trap the real Herbert P. Bear in the Night Club.

He made a brief appearance in Mission 11, inspecting the disappearance of several items in the Gift Shop.

If you look at the bottom of the Table of Contents in the [[w:c:clubpenguin:The F.I.S.H.|F.I.S.H.]] (Factual Informative Spy Handbook), you will see Jet Pack Guy without his jet pack.
==Elite Penguin Force==
Jet Pack Guy first appears in the Nintendo DS game similarly the way he did when he debuted; he came to rescue you and Rookie in the Wilderness. When seeing the agent land he yelled "IT'S THE JET PACK GUY!" making this his permanent nickname. This marked his second appearance in the history of Club Penguin. He then helps and guides you through the game, often along with [[Rookie]]. During Mission 8 you had to follow him on a jet pack so you could get to the Tallest Mountain to continue your [[w:c:clubpenguin:Elite Puffle|Elite Puffle]] training. During Mission 10, you must help him gather up the blueprints of the Test Bots by playing Ice Fishing. During Mission 12, he lands on the Wilderness after running out of fuel on his jetpack while chasing the jetpack Test-bot, and you must get extra jet pack fuel and continue the chase for him.
==Trivia==
*Jet Pack Guy is one of the few penguins which can wear two items of the same category at once. Jet Pack Guy can wear a Jet Pack and a tie, both of which are 'neck items'. This means that it is nearly impossible to imitate him.
*As revealed on the EPF Game 'System Defender' on the 'Advanced Training', he in fact has eyebrows under his glasses.
==Acquaintances==
*Jet Pack Guy is a friend of [[Rookie]], [[Gary the Gadget Guy]], [[Dot the Disguise Gal]], [[Puffle Handler|PH]], the agent, the Director and you.
*He, along the rest of the [[EPF]], are enemies of [[Herbert P. Bear]] and [[Klutzy]].
