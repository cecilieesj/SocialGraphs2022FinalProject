==Role in the film==
The Fenner Brothers are first seen removing their Real Estate Business sign next to the old sugar mill [[Tiana]] buys, which would one day become her [[Tiana's Palace|restaurant]]. They promise to bring the papers she has to sign after Mardi Gras but later at night, at the La Bouff's party; wearing horse costumes, they inform her that she was outbid by a gentleman and that unless she can top his offer by Wednesday, she "can kiss that place goodbye". Tiana tries to object, but they only reply to her that "a little woman of her background" would have difficulties running a restaurant business and should just stay where she's at despite complimenting her cooking. Shortly after, Tiana turns into a frog and she, with [[Prince Naveen]], get chased by [[Stella (The Princess and the Frog)|Stella]], they get a cake thrown launched onto them, thus making them resemble clowns. 

At the end of the movie, Tiana returns to the Fenner Brothers with her new husband, Naveen and alligator friend, [[Louis (The Princess and the Frog)|Louis]] and gives them the large sum of money needed for her to purchase the sugar mill. They were hesitant to accept it at first, but when Louis growled at them, scaring them stiff, they finally surrendered and gave Tiana the key to the place.

==Trivia==
*Their appearances are based on the film's directors, [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]]. Their names, in turn, are revealed in the end credits; Henry (short one) and Harvey (tall one).
*Harvey may be a bit more sympathetic than Henry, as he seemed reluctant to tell Tiana about being outbid, while Henry just thoughtlessly blurted it out.
*Technically, the Fenners were a bit correct in the notion that Tiana wouldn't have been to run the restaurant by herself, as she just bought the building but she needed more money in order to pay the personnel and for taxes. However, thanks to Naveen's and possibly Charlotte's financial support (which the brothers probably didn't think about), Tiana was ultimately able to run the place successfully.
*When they mention Tiana's background, they were likely referring to the fact that she came from a poor working family as well as lacking actual experience in running a business instead of her race.
