}}'''Petulia''' (know in [[Italy]] as '''Petulia Basettoni''') is a character created in 1996 by the Italian comic author Giorgio Pezzin and designed by [[Romano Scarpa]] as Chief O'Hara's wife for the Italian comics magazine ''Topolino''.

==History==
Petulia is the wife of [[Chief O'Hara]]. She makes her first appearance in 1996 in the comic story ''Basettotini e la dieta da fame'' (''Chief O'Hara and Hunger Diet''), published on ''[[Topolino]]'' n. 2109.

She appears mostly as a secondary character (always next to her husband) in many comics strips called "Gulp" and in series of stories like ''[[Ultraheroes]]. '' ''Topomiti'', ''Lezioni di Basettoni'' (''Chief O'Hara's Classes''), ''In due'', ''Un commissario in famiglia'' (''A Police Chief as Home''), ''Sorprese Pasquali'' ''(Easter Surprises'') and ''Non è facile essere Topolino'' (''It's not easy being Mickey Mouse'').

In the story, ''Trudy, Petulia e la sfida all'ultimo crimine ''(''Trudy Petulia and the Crime Challenge'') published on ''Topolino'' n. 2395, she becomes a friend of Trudy Van Tubb (Pete's wife) - as the job of the two companions often makes them participate in the places of the incident - and together they decide to participate in a quiz show about "Mousetown's Crime History". 

No more is know about Petulia past and family, but in the story ''Basettoni & Manetta e la vacanza di tutto riposo (Chief O'Hara & Detective Casey in: Total Relax Vacation)'', her aunt Primula appears. 

==Appearance==
Petulia has the appearance of an anthropomorphic dog, very well dressed and elegant; Semra has a handbag walking and often wears dresses with floral motifs. 

Petulia is a housewife and an excellent cook.
