}}'''Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir''' are three wolf hunters and the deuteragonists of ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', a segment of the [[1946]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] feature film ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
There really isn't any particular personality or traits offered for them, except for the fact that they are brave enough to rush to the rescue of a little boy named [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]] who is trapped by a [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] and sensitive enough to all start crying when it looks like Peter has been killed.

===Physical appearance===
They play off each other very well, Misha being tall and buff, Yasha being tall and slender, and Vladimir being very short, so short that when they start running he sometimes bounces between Misha and Yasha's bodies without slowing them down at all. Misha and Yasha both have black hair, while Vladimir has light red hair. They all have long beards. Each wears a different colored outfit, which appears to be fur-lined, possibly a testament to both their hunting prowess and the cold.

==Appearances==
===''[[Make Mine Music]]''===
Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir first appear when they're marching rhythmically through the woods and [[Sasha]] flies up and alerts them of a wolf up ahead. Though startled at first, they heft their rifles without hesitation and dash off after him. When they arrive at the scene, they find only Peter's hat and popgun lying in the midst of some wolf tracks. Believing him to be dead, they give great emphatic sobs until they hear a whistle. They look up and see him and [[Ivan]] with the wolf subdued in ropes. Led by Peter, they then march through the village in a victory parade with the wolf hanging on a pole and the villagers cheering and dancing in celebration.
