Whenever he shows his ideas to and shows Mr. Toymaker how it works, he is impressed, does it himself, and says, "I'm the head toymaker and you're just my assistant," and then everything ends up as a disaster and Mr. Toymaster blames it on and sends him to his room. His ideas that had been shown in the filmÂ are a toy-making machine, a chemical that reduces objects and humans, and one that grows objects and humans (which was actually successful by the end).
