'''Hadras''' is a character in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Background==

===Personality===
Under command of [[Davy Jones]], Hadras serves as a crew member of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''. Whenever he loses his head, he felt desperate to help retrieve his missing head back to its owner.

===Physical Appearance===
As with other members of the ''Dutchman'', Hadras has characteristics of sea creatures - his body covered with coral and barnacles. His head was ensconced with a conch shell (which would be merged into a hermit crab which could move independently on his body).

==Appearances==

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''===
On board the scuttled ship, Hadras and the rest of the crew confront [[Will Turner]] in combat while [[Davy Jones]] took control of the ship, with Will noticing [[Jack Sparrow]] was nearby on the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Onboard it, Hadras and the other crewmen went on it and held his motley crew as prisoners.

During a game of [[Liar's Dice]], Hadras watched [[Maccus]], [[Koleniko]], and [[Clanker]] play the game with the other crew members just as Will Turner offers to challenge against Davy Jones. Jones, however, calls Will's father [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|Bootstrap Bill]] a liar, punishing him to stay on the ship forever while telling Will to feel free to go ashore due to Will's father helping his son not lose the game.

The next day, Hadras and the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' raise the mast while Davy Jones prepares to summon the [[Kraken]] in order to kill Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and the rest of the crew, because Will took the key from him while he was sleeping. Later, at [[Isla Cruces]] when the crew spies on Jack and his crew surviving on Isla Cruces, Hadras and the rest of the crew plan to go after the crew who are seeking [[Dead Man's Chest]].

During the fight, Hadras loses his head, causing his head and body to become separated, thanks to Jack Sparrow who threw a coconut at him. Hadras tells his body to approach his head to which he managed to find his missing head and reunite it back to its owner. Hadras later confronted [[James Norrington]] who later threw the chest onto Hadras' head, closing him to lose his head once again, desperately trying to retrieve it back. Just as the ''Pearl'' faces against the ''Dutchman'', Davy Jones orders his crew to destroy the ''Black Pearl'' just as the ''Dutchman'' fires its cannons to destroy it. As the ''Dutchman'' fails to defeat Jack Sparrow, the crew of the ''Pearl'' celebrates as the moment is interrupted when the Kraken prepares to attack; it turns out that the Kraken is only searching for Jack.

After Jack sacrifices himself to save the crew, Hadras and the other crew members only find out that Jack took Davy Jones' heart with him just as Davy Jones plans to take revenge against Jack, much to the captain's rage.

===''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''===
Hadras returns in this film where Davy Jones and his crew have a conversation with [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckett]] of the [[East India Trading Company]] just as Davy Jones is forced to kill the Kraken. Later, by order of the EITC, Hadras and the rest of the crew attacked [[Sao Feng]]'s crew, the ''Empress'', and executed most of the crew of the ''Empress''. With [[James Norrington]] dead, Hadras and the other crew react in shock just as [[Maccus]] gives orders to escape the cabin just as Davy Jones manages to take command of the ''Dutchman'' under [[Ian Mercer|Mercer]]'s duty.

During battle at the maelstrom, Hadras and the other crew of the Flying Dutchman and the EITC soldiers fight against Jack's crew and [[Tai Huang]]'s men. The Dead Man's Chest, however, fell onto Hadras' head, stunning him and toppling him overboard.

After the battle stops when Davy Jones falls to his death, Hadras and the remaining crew members of the ''Flying Dutchman'' revert back to their human forms with Will Turner as the new captain of the ''Dutchman''. Afterwards, both the ''Dutchman'' and the ''Black Pearl'' destroy the HMS ''Endeavor'', defeating Cutler Beckett for good.

==Trivia==
*Screenwriters [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] and the end credits for ''Dead Man's Chest'' confirmed that it was Reggie Lee who played Hadras (identified as "Headless" in this film). In the credits for ''At World's End'', the character's name was identified as "Hadras", a name that was in production drafts for ''Dead Man's Chest''.
