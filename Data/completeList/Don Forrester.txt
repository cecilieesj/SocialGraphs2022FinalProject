'''Don Forrester''' is a minor character in ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''. He is the brother, cousin, or husband of [[Gloria Forrester]].

When the Forresters arrive, he mentions something about a cat ("You brought the dog. I don't want to hear any more about the cat."). He then pretends to "fish" [[Russ Thompson, Sr.]] down from the foundation and they give each other high fives. When he and Russ talk, Don doesn't seem interested in what Gloria witnessed: [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]] flying. He is dismayed when Russ says that plumbing was keeping the Thompsons from going on their fishing/camping trip despite a non-refundable $80 deposit, but they part.

Eventually, however, when leaving, Don strangely does see Wayne flying.
