==History==
Featherstone is the pink, plastic, lawn flamingo who lived locked in the shed at the old Laurence place until [[Gnomeo]] and [[Juliet (Gnomeo & Juliet)|Juliet]] released him and returned his second leg. Then, he's free as a bird. His first job seems to be to jump beak first into the lives of the people who set him free, Gnomeo and Juliet. Featherstone's is all about love and love lost- just what Gnomeo and Juliet need to learn in order to free themselves.

== Trivia ==
* He is likely named after Don Featherstone, the man who invented pink plastic lawn flamingos
