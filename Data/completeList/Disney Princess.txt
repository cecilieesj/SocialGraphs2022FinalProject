'''Disney Princess''' is a franchise with a line-up of fictional female heroines who have appeared in various [[Disney Animated Canon|Disney animated feature films]], owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], and created in the mid-1990s.

The franchise currently comprises of thirteen female protagonists from twelve different [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] films and one [[Pixar]] film, who are either royal by birth, royal by marriage, or considered a "princess" due to their significant portrayal of heroism in their respective films.

The character line-up has varied since the creation of the franchise. Currently, the franchise is comprised of 13 members: [[Snow White]], [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]], [[Aurora]], [[Ariel]], [[Belle]], [[Jasmine]], [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]], [[Tiana]], [[Rapunzel]], [[Merida]], [[Moana (character)|Moana]], and [[Raya]].<ref>[https://princess.disney.com/]</ref>

The Disney Princesses are featured prominently through theme parks, dolls, jewelry and apparel, video games, and crossover feature films and television shows.

From [[2012]] to [[2021]], with the exception of those created after the [[Disney Renaissance]], the Princesses were showcased in their enhanced and modified redesigned outfits instead of the ones that they wear in their own movies. The classic looks from their movies were brought back and enhanced for the Ultimate Princess Celebration event in 2021.

==History==
In the early 1990s, [[Disney Consumer Products]] realized the market potential for the female characters portrayed in the wildly successful Disney movies. Soon after realizing the demand, the Disney Princess franchise was launched.

In the mid-1990s the princesses began to be marketed together in the doll lines [https://imgur.com/UcaZjON ''Perfume Princess''], ''Musical Princess'', and ''Dancing Princess''.

On March 12, 1996, [[Walt Disney Records]] released the first compilation of the franchise: [[Princess Collection (Album)|Princess Collection]]. The album went on to peak at #4 on Billboard's Top Kid Audio chart.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/music/various-artists/chart-history/KID/song/192431 Disney's Princess Collection]</ref>

The first issue of the Disney Princess Magazine was published on [[June 24]], [[1998]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Its slogan was ''"Every girl can be a Princess!"''. The launch of the magazine was supported by extensive radio, press, and retail promotions, including a cross-promotion with Mattel in Toys 'R' Us and with Panini stickers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney Princess Magazine celebrates increase in sales as it turns 21|url=https://www.egmont.co.uk/blog/disney-princess-magazine-turns-21/|publisher=[[Egmont Group]]|date=January 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/united-kingdom/disneys-princess/ Disney Princess Magazine]</ref>

The Princesses to be featured in the franchise were chosen from classic Disney films. The characters were not chosen specifically for their royal titles, but rather for how well they fit into what Disney executives deemed "the Princess mythology". Mulan is an example of this concept; she has no familial ties to royalty but is still included in the character list. [[Tinker Bell]] and [[Esmeralda]] were once included under the same principle before it was decided that they were not suited for the "mythology".<ref>[https://www.comics.org/issue/1555925/cover/4/ Disney Prinsesser]</ref><ref>[https://imgur.com/7R6ECJG Disney Store Catalog]</ref> In 2005, though, [[Tinker Bell]] has starred in her own Disney franchise, the [[Disney Fairies]]. Other fairies were created specifically for the franchise. The line began with a book series by Gail Carson Levine and has since spawned toys, direct-to-video movies and other products based on the characters. At one point, [[Jane Porter]], [[Giselle]], [[Anna]], and [[Elsa]] were considered to be included in the line-up, but weren't realized.

==Character Background==
The characters themselves, despite appearing in separate films, have distinct similarities. The Princesses show good will towards all creatures, evidenced by the common ability to communicate with animals. The Princesses are known for their inner and outer beauty, as well as having beautiful singing voices, apart from Merida, who only sings a song with [[Queen Elinor|her mother]] when she is little in her film, ''Brave'', and Raya, who doesn't sing at all in her film, ''Raya and The Last Dragon''.

Almost every Princess, excluding Merida, Moana, and Raya has a romance that is resolved by the end of her debut film. These charismatic girls carry a similar personality in their eras.

At the beginning with the first three (Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora), their characteristics were well known as classy, graceful, and romantic daydreamers, who suffered from the actions caused by others. They held an inner strength through compassion, love, kindness, and, particularly with Cinderella, a strong sense of resilience, without having to demonstrate the more proactive traits of the later Princesses.

Since the Renaissance Era, these popular heroines became more active than reactive with Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Mulan. Their characteristics were known to be much more strong-willed, adventurous, feisty, cunning, and determined. As well their goals focused more on adventure and freedom than love, and these girls were more fighters for their dreams than the first three. They also existed in worlds which were more self-aware of the traditional and changing role of women; particularly Ariel, with her [[Ursula|villainess]] assuring her that women on land should keep silent, Belle, with [[Gaston|her villain]] assuring her that "it's not right for a woman to read", and Mulan, with her peers [[I'll Make a Man Out of You|extolling masculine traits]] in addition to [[A Girl Worth Fighting For|those of the ideal wife]]. The most recent ones - Tiana, Rapunzel, Merida, Moana, and Raya - are in the modern era; Tiana, an original character, is much more a realist than the others, as she does not need nor want magic to make a dream come true but with only hard work, whereas Rapunzel is much more like the idealistic ones than Tiana.

Snow White, Aurora, Ariel, Jasmine, Rapunzel, and Merida are born of royal heritage as daughters of kings and queens. Pocahontas can be considered as being of royal heritage, as she is the daughter of a chief and considered Native American royalty by the English, as well as being called a princess in her film's sequel. Raya can be considered as being of royal heritage, as she is the daughter of a chief and is addressed as a princess in her film. Cinderella, Belle, and Tiana become royalty through marriage. Mulan was neither royal by birth or marriage, but is still included in the line-up due to her high status by saving [[China]] and receiving grace from the [[The Emperor of China|Emperor]]. Moana, herself, states that she is not a princess, but as daughter to a chief, the roles are similar. And just like Mulan, she received grace from [[Te Fiti]] for saving the world from destruction.

In the [[2016]] film, ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'', [[Maui]] states that princesses have animal sidekicks. This has been evidently shown to be a common characteristic among the official members.

[[Walt Disney]] turned this classic fairy tale into his very first [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|animated feature film]]. Her true love is [[the Prince]], who breaks her sleeping death 'slumber' (caused by [[the Evil Queen]]) with love's first kiss. She befriends the seven dwarfs during her stay at their cottage. At age 14, she is the youngest of the Princesses.

In [[1950]], it was turned into an [[Cinderella (1950 film)|animated feature-length film]] by Walt Disney. Cinderella is the eldest of all the Disney Princesses. Her [[Lady Tremaine|stepmother]] turned her into the family's sole servant after the death of her [[Cinderella's Father|father]]. With magical help from her [[Fairy Godmother]], she attends a royal ball and meets [[Prince Charming]], and eventually marries him, thus freeing herself from her life of servitude. In the two sequels; "''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True|Dreams Come True]]''" and "''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time|A Twist In Time]]''", Cinderella also manages to repair her relationship with her younger stepsister [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and help her find true love. Aged 19, Cinderella is one of the oldest Princesses, and is often considered the leader; often being put in the center of the group shots, and having also been deemed Walt Disney's personal favorite heroine.

|model = Helene Stanley}}Best known as the heroine of the [[1959]] animated classic ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', which is based on Charles Perrault's "''La Belle au Bois Dormant''". Although her dress changes from blue to pink due to a disagreement between two of her guardians, [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Merryweather and Flora]], outside the film, she is most commonly seen wearing pink. She was cursed at birth to die before the sun sets on her 16th birthday by the evil fairy [[Maleficent]] by pricking her finger on the spindle of a [[Spinning Wheel|spinning wheel]]. One of the three good fairies, Merryweather, was able to weaken the curse by changing death to a deep slumber that could only be awakened by true love's kiss. By falling in love with [[Prince Phillip]], the prince of a neighboring kingdom (and unknown to either of them, her betrothed), she was freed from the curse. Aurora is shown to be one of the taller princesses in the franchise.

The heroine of the [[1989]] film, based on the Danish fairy tale "''Den Lille Havfrue''" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and the daughter of [[King Triton]], ruler of the sea. Ariel is a 16-year-old mermaid who falls in love with a dashing human [[Prince Eric]], an extension of her fascination with all things from the surface world. Her dream is to live a life on land. So it comes as no surprise when her dream causes her to fall victim to accepting a shady offer from [[Ursula]] the Sea Witch promising her a lifetime of happiness with Prince Eric as long as she carries out the rules outlined in the signed, binding contract. Ursula persuades her to trade her beautiful voice, in exchange for becoming a human for three days. During these three days, Ariel must not only make Prince Eric fall in love with her, but the two must seal their love with a kiss. If Ariel is unable to uphold her end of the agreement, she must return to the sea to live out her days in Ursula's lair as a prisoner, joining the many other "lost souls" that have fallen victim to Ursula's "wish granting" over the years. However, Ariel is able to defeat Ursula with Eric's help and thanks to her father, she becomes human permanently and marries Eric at the end of the film.

Hans Christian Andersen's original character dissolves into foam on the sea after the prince marries someone else, but through an act of compassion is transformed into a spirit of the air. Co-director [[Ron Clements]] felt the story was too tragic, and changed the original character from the tragic but hopeful heroine to the brave and resourceful Ariel.

The name Belle translates from the French word for "beauty". In the film, she selflessly trades in her freedom, for that of her [[Maurice|father]]'s, in a bargain with the [[Beast]], thus becoming his prisoner/guest. She soon learns to see the good hidden behind his hideous appearance and rough manner and over time, falls in love with him. By confessing her love at the end of the movie, she breaks the curse placed on him by the enchantress. The Beast and his staff are then restored to their human forms, and Belle becomes his princess.

She falls in love with [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]], a street rat, and falls in love with him again after he makes a wish from a [[Genie]] to become a prince. Though Jasmine did not recognize Aladdin in his prince disguise, she fell in love due to him seeing her as a person and for him having a good heart. After Aladdin reveals his true identity and saves Jasmine and her kingdom from [[Jafar]], Jasmine's father removes the royal law so Jasmine can be with Aladdin, whom she eventually marries.

She is based on Princess Badroulbadour (Arabic بدر البدور, ''badru l-budūr'', "full moon of full moons") featured in the story of "''Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp''" from "''One Thousand and One Nights''" of Scheherazade. Interestingly, the original story took place in [[China]] and not the Middle East.

Her real name was Matoaka since Pocahontas was her nickname and meant 'Playful One'. She is a free spirit, which she gets from her deceased mother. Pocahontas wants to choose her own path and doesn't want to marry her father's choice for a husband, [[Kocoum]]. Once the English settlers arrive, she teaches a man named [[John Smith]] about nature and her culture. The two later fall in love. Once John is taken prisoner, Pocahontas helps prevent a war from commencing between their people. At the end of the [[Pocahontas (film)|film]], John is wounded and sent back to [[London]] for treatment, where Pocahontas remains in her village to look after her people.

Mulan pretends to be her father's son, Ping, risking death, and dishonor if she is discovered. Joining a struggling troop of rookies led by Captain [[Li Shang]] (or simply Shang), "Ping" is the driving force behind the troop's dramatic change into respectable soldiers. "Ping" is admired by everyone until "he" is injured during the battle and requires medical care, resulting in the outing of "his" secret. Since "Ping" had saved Shang's life, Shang repays his debt and spares Mulan's life. No longer allowed in the Imperial Army, Mulan goes rogue and defeats the leader of the Hun army, [[Shan Yu]]. The Chinese Emperor praises Mulan, recognizing her as a hero for saving China and for bringing honor to her family. Mulan is welcomed back into her home with loving, open arms. Shang arrives at Mulan's home shortly after her return, and the two's feelings for each other are made known.

The character of Mulan is based on the heroine from the well-known ancient Chinese poem "''The Ballad of Mulan''" (木蘭詩). She is the only Disney Princess who is not royal by blood or marriage. However, she has been bestowed the honor of a being an official [[Disney Princess]] because of her popularity as well as what she represents. The film is praised for its cultural authenticity and prevailing messages including family, love, courage, and most notably, the empowerment and equal rights of women.

She dreams of opening her own [[Tiana's Palace|restaurant]] through hard work. By kissing [[Prince Naveen]] in frog form, she is turned into a frog because she kissed him for material gain, not love, and the magic can only be broken by a princess, so they are forced to set on a journey to find a way to undo the magic. Eventually, she finds herself falling for the handsome but spoiled prince who manages to change his ways, and willingly gives up her desires to be with him. By marrying the prince, Tiana becomes a real princess, and with her love, breaks the spell with a kiss. They finally open their own restaurant at the end of the film.

Tiana officially became a member of the Disney Princess line-up on [[March 14]], [[2010]], at the New York Palace Hotel in Manhattan, [[New York City]].

|voice = [[Mandy Moore]]<br>Kelly Lansdowne
|singing voice = [[Mandy Moore]]}}The heroine from the animated feature ''[[Tangled]]'' is based on the German title character from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale "''Rapunzel''". Her long hair, which is said to measure 70 feet (21 meters) in length, not only has magical healing powers but can also be used as a weapon. Given the power by a magic golden flower, [[Mother Gothel]] kidnaps her as an infant to use her power to keep herself young. 18 years later, Rapunzel sneaks away from her [[Rapunzel's Tower|tower]] with a thief, [[Flynn Rider]], and sets on her own journey to find the flying lanterns that float into the sky every year on her birthday. Along the journey, Rapunzel falls in love with Flynn who starts revealing the caring individual he is behind his roguish exterior while slowly discovering her true identity as a princess. To free her from Gothel's clutches, Flynn cuts her hair, thus destroying her power, and she is returned to her family before she eventually marries Flynn. Rapunzel was "officially welcomed into the Disney Princess Royal Court" during a promotional event at Kensington Palace in [[London]] on [[October 2]], [[2011]]. Rapunzel's marriage to Flynn is later shown in [[Tangled Ever After]], and their later adventures in-between the movie and the wedding are later depicted in [[Tangled: The Series|Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure]].

====11. [[Merida]]====
{{Infobox Disney Princesses
|image = Merida.3.png
|name = Merida
|film = ''[[Brave]]''
|voice = [[Kelly Macdonald]]<br>Ruth Connell}}Merida is the 16-year-old daughter of [[Queen Elinor]], who rules the kingdom alongside her husband, [[King Fergus]]. Queen Elinor's expectations and demands of her daughter make Merida see Elinor as being cold, unfeeling, and distant, causing friction between the two. Despite Elinor's desire to see Merida as a proper royal lady, Merida is an impetuous girl with wild, unruly ginger hair and a passionate desire to take control of her own destiny. Merida has honed her skill with the bow and is the most skilled archers in her kingdom. She is also well-trained in sword-fighting and an expert horsewoman, riding wildly across the countryside on her horse, [[Angus]].

When Merida comes of age to have her hand in marriage, Merida becomes determined to not be forced into marriage, where her actions nearly cause a war between the kingdom and the three clans. After a heated argument with her mother, Merida visits a witch who grants her a [[Spell Cake|spell]] to change her fate. Merida uses the spell on Elinor in an attempt to make her change her mind about the marriage, only to turn Elinor into a bear. As the two work together in finding a way to break the curse, they manage to rekindle their bond and Merida manages to resolve peace between her kingdom and the clans without being forced into marriage. After preventing a war and the defeat of the demon bear [[Mor'du]], Merida breaks the spell by reconciling with her mother, who becomes human again and the two remain closer than ever before.

She is the first princess from a Pixar film, the first original princess in the line-up that is not inspired by either literature (Snow White, Cinderella, etc.) or real life (Pocahontas, Mulan) works, and the first without a love interest. She also never sings a major song, thus breaking away the traditional line-up, though as a child, she sang a small verse of a song in Gaelic with her mother, and Merida's rich Scottish brogue makes her the second Disney Princess with an accent other than Standard American or British. Merida officially joined the Disney Princess court on [[May 11]], [[2013]], at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Cinderella Castle]].

Due to an ancient law upheld by her father, Chief Tui, Moana is forbidden from ever going beyond the reef. She eventually finds the courage to do so, with the help of a powerful demigod named [[Maui]], and the guidance of her [[Gramma Tala]]. In restoring [[Te Fiti]]'s lost heart, the world is freed of darkness, allowing Moana's people to voyage the seas as freely as they please.

The fourth Princess to come from the minds of [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] (Ariel, Jasmine, and Tiana), Moana is one of the few Disney Princesses not to be based on a preexisting character. Rather, her story—save for real-world ties to South Pacific mythology—is almost wholly original. Furthermore, unlike her most recent predecessors, Moana was not inducted with a coronation event. Instead, she was slowly integrated via ''Disney Princess'' marketing such as books, social media posts, and toy lines following the release of her film, before being added as a member to the franchise's official website in [[2019]].

In learning to trust, Raya gets rid of the Druun, and they become Kumandra once again.

The third Princess to be Asian, Raya is one of the few Disney Princesses not to be based on a preexisting character. Raya is also the only princess who's mother is unknown to be either alive or deceased, since her mother is not seen or mentioned throughout the film.

===''Kingdom Hearts'' series===
[[File:Princesses of Heart KH1.png|right|300x300px]]
In the games, five of the official princesses are part of the '''Seven Princesses of Heart''' (セブンプリンセス ''Sebun Purinsesu''), a group of maidens with hearts of pure [[Light]], devoid of [[Darkness]], and were created when the [[Keyblade|X-blade]] was split into seven pieces of light and thirteen of darkness. They are referred to this name because they allow access to the [[Door to Darkness]] when gathered together, and whoever gathers them will gain the power to rule over the worlds. The members in this incarnation are:
*'''[[Kairi]]'''
*'''[[Alice]]'''
*'''[[Snow White]]'''
*'''[[Jasmine]]'''
*'''[[Belle]]'''
*'''[[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'''
*'''[[Aurora]]'''

Notably, two other Disney Princesses, [[Ariel]] and [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]], appear as well but are not Princesses of Heart. Instead, they serve as party members that fight alongside [[Sora]] in their journey to save the worlds.

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', it was revealed that another generation of the Princesses of Heart exists, and is elaborated upon in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''. Referred to as the "New Seven Hearts of Light", these pure-hearted maidens consist of the more recent members from the Disney Princess franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kh13.com/news/nomura-talks-about-let-it-go-the-gameplay-of-arendelle-and-the-carribean-the-new-princesses-of-hearts-and-situation-commands-in-kingdom-hearts-iii|website=KH13|title=Nomura talks about "Let It Go", the gameplay of Arendelle and The Caribbean, the new Princesses of Heart and Situation Commands in Kingdom Hearts III|date=June 17, 2018}}</ref> Each inherit the title from previous members who no longer have need for the position once they willingly accept light over darkness. Kairi is the only member from the original group that is part of the new seven lights. [[Rapunzel]], [[Anna]], and [[Elsa]] are potential candidates; unfortunately, they become targets to [[Organization XIII]] as part of their fall-back plan in case the seven guardians of light cannot congregate. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, and Moana are the only ones who haven't appeared in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series yet.

===''Kilala Princess'' series===
In the manga series, six of the official Princesses appear, each having the power to bring peace to the world. After her best friend [[Erica Ange|Erica]] is kidnapped, Kilala uses the power of the [[Magic Tiara]] to open the Gate of Dreams in order to find her, interacting with each of the Princesses and receiving a gem from each of them to power the Tiara during this time. Using the six gems she'd collected, Kilala manages to free the citizens of [[Paradiso]] from [[Valdou]]'s control - gaining the final gem when she accepts that she is the seventh Princess and chooses to become one in her own way. The seven Princesses appear as follows:
*'''[[Snow White]]'''
*'''[[Ariel]]'''
*'''[[Aurora]]'''
*'''[[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'''
*'''[[Jasmine]]'''
*'''[[Belle]]'''
*'''[[Kilala Reno]]'''

===''Ralph Breaks the Internet''===
[[File:Ralph Breaks the Internet Disney Princesses.jpg|right|250px]]
In the [[2018]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film, digitally animated versions of the princesses (described as "netizens") appear as residents of the [[Internet]]. [[Vanellope von Schweetz]] encounters the group during her visit to [[Oh My Disney]]; in during which, Vanellope reveals herself to be the princess of ''[[Sugar Rush]]'' and is subsequently inducted into the line-up. Not including Vanellope, the fourteen official members of the court are designated as follows:
*'''[[Snow White]]'''
*'''[[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]'''
*'''[[Aurora]]'''
*'''[[Ariel]]'''
*'''[[Belle]]'''
*'''[[Jasmine]]'''
*'''[[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]]'''
*'''[[Fa Mulan|Mulan]]'''
*'''[[Tiana]]'''
*'''[[Rapunzel]]'''
*'''[[Merida]]'''
*'''[[Anna]]'''
*'''[[Elsa]]'''
*'''[[Moana (character)|Moana]]'''

A toy line based on the princesses as they appear in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' was launched following the film’s release. Dubbed “'''Comfy Squad'''” or “'''Comfy Princesses'''”, the sub-franchise includes merchandise depicting the princesses in their casual clothes from the movie. Vanellope acts as the line’s mascot.<ref>https://www.shopdisney.com/vanellope-with-comfy-princesses-dolls-gift-set-ralph-breaks-the-internet-460020912866.html Comfy Princess Doll Set]</ref><ref>[https://www.laughingplace.com/w/articles/2020/09/17/amazon-exclusive-hasbro-disney-princess-comfy-squad-comfy-castle/]</ref> Since they're not official members of the franchise, Anna and Elsa are only occasionally featured in the line.

===Mickey's Pirate and Princess Party===
Beginning on [[January 22]], [[2007]], the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World hosted their newest [[Hard Ticket|hard ticket]] (separate admission) event, "Disney's Pirate and Princess Party", renamed "Mickey's Pirate and Princess Party" in [[2008]]. The event combines the "[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]" attraction and movie series and the Disney Princess line, and {{WikipediaLink|cosplay}}ing as both pirates and royalty is encouraged. Visitors can have meet and greets with characters from both franchises, and the other classic characters dressed as buccaneers and royals, and take part in various activities. Other features include the "Disney's Enchanted Adventures Parade" and the ''"[[Magic, Music and Mayhem]]"'' fireworks spectacular. Because the event has become so popular, Pirate and Princess events have become an annual hard-ticket staple with dates into August and September of [[2007]] and January through June of [[2008]].

==Trivia==
*As of [[2022]], there are a total of thirteen Princess films featuring nine Princesses (6 by birth, 3 by marriage), one heroine and three that are daughters of a chief (the first and third one are recognized as princesses, while the second one is recognized as a heroine).
**The line-up also features eight characters loosely based on fairy tales (Snow White; Cinderella; Aurora from "''Sleeping Beauty''"; Ariel from "''The Little Mermaid''"; Belle from "''Beauty and the Beast''"; Jasmine from "''Aladdin and the Magic Lamp''"; Tiana from "''The Frog Prince''"; and Rapunzel), one character based on a real person (Pocahontas), one character based on a legend (Mulan), and three characters created for original stories (Merida from ''Brave'', Moana, and Raya from ''Raya and The Last Dragon'').
*Initially, one of the unspoken rules of the franchise is that none of the Princesses should ever make eye contact in any official merchandise, keeping their "mythologies" separate. The Disney Princesses were designed to have all the Princesses unaware of each other's presence.
**[[Roy E. Disney]] objected to the creation of the Disney Princess franchise, as he said, "Cinderella and Snow White could never be seen together because their stories take place in different times and places."
**Going against the franchise's initial marketing strategy, the Princesses, along with Vanellope, Anna, and Elsa, interact with each other for the first time in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.
***The reasoning for including Anna and Elsa in the film's variation of the line-up was due to the filmmakers recognizing the unofficial Princesses as princess characters that have the strongest association with the franchise, as well as sharing the connection of being from Walt Disney Animation with Vanellope.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/20/ralph-breaks-the-internet-inside-the-disney-princess-scene-everyones-talking-about|title=Ralph Breaks the Internet: Inside the Disney Princess scene everyone's talking about|website=IGN|date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>
**As of 2022, as part of the Ultimate Princess Celebration, Disney has released promotional photos of the Princesses interacting with each other and acknowledging each other's presence.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/DisneyPrincess/posts/10158813587047620</ref>
*As of 2022, Snow White, Merida, and Raya are the only Princesses who have never had a sequel or spin-off.
**It should be noted that Walt Disney himself was not in favor of the idea of giving Snow White a sequel or a spin-off.
*Out of all the thirteen Princesses, eight of them have used magic actively on others or their surroundings: Cinderella and Aurora with wands, Ariel with her father's [[Trident (The Little Mermaid)|trident]], Belle with the [[Enchanted Mirror]], Jasmine with the [[Magic Carpet|Carpet]], Rapunzel with her [[Rapunzel's Magic Hair|hair]], Merida with the [[Spell Cake]], and Raya with the [[Dragon Gem]].
*Snow White and Belle are the only Princesses to have magical mirrors involved in their stories.
*Each of the Princesses have their own outfits which represent their uniqueness and character in the franchise:
**Snow White, Jasmine, Merida, and Raya all wear casual attire.
***Jasmine is also the only Princess to wear long puffy trousers as part of her outfit.
**Cinderella and Belle both wear ball gowns.
**Aurora is the only Princess to wear a typical princess gown.
**Ariel is the only Princess to be seen in her mermaid tail or wearing a bouffant gown as a human.
**Pocahontas, Mulan, Moana, and Raya all wear their ethnic outfits.
***Moana is also the only Princess to wear a skirt as part of her outfit.
**Tiana is the only Princess to wear a wedding gown (without the veil). She is also the only Princess to wear a wedding gown that is not white (the color is green in her case); although she ''does'' have a separate white wedding gown, which was used in her second wedding.
**Rapunzel, Belle, Mulan, and Cinderella are the only Princesses to wear peasant dresses (Aside from Aurora when she was in the forest as Briar Rose).
*Snow White, Aurora, and Belle are the only Princesses to have lived in cottages. Aurora and Belle were official residents of their respective cottages, while Snow White moved in with the dwarfs temporarily.
*Pocahontas is the only Princess to wear her signature outfit throughout the course of her entire film.
**In Ariel's case, she was seen as a mermaid for most of her time onscreen, while only seen briefly in her bouffant gown as a human during her dinner with Prince Eric and Grimsby.
**Snow White is briefly seen wearing a ragged dress in her film.
**Cinderella was only seen wearing her gown when she went to the ball.
**Aurora was only seen wearing the pink version of her dress during her dance with Prince Phillip at the end of her film.
**Belle was only seen wearing her gown twice in her film: when she had both dinner and a dance with the Beast, as well as dancing with the Beast once again in his human form at the end of the film.
**Mulan was only seen in her signature outfit during the first part of her film, as she spends the rest of it dressed up as a soldier.
**Tiana was only seen in her signature outfit during her first wedding with Prince Naveen.
**Jasmine wears a low class garment over her signature outfit when she disguises to leave the palace, a different dress when Jafar takes over Agrabah and a slave dress in the film's climax.
**Rapunzel is briefly seen in a pale pink dress in the final scene of her original film.
**Moana gains a new chief's outfit during the final sequence of her film.
**Merida wears a sky blue dress during the archery competition at the beginning of her film.
**Raya wears three blue outfits as a child in the beginning of her film.
*Tiana is considered the most stylish Disney Princess.
*Jasmine is the only Princess to be seen wearing the outfits of her other fellow Princesses.
*Moana is the only Princess not to be seen wearing a garment that has a shade of blue.
**However, she does have an accessory that incorporates the said color (the pendant of her grandmother's necklace).
***Snow White has a blue bodice for her signature outfit.
***Cinderella's ball gown has been recolored from silver to blue for the franchise.
***Aurora has an alternative blue princess dress, opposing to the signature pink that she has.
***Ariel was seen wearing a blue dress while touring around Prince Eric's kingdom.
***Belle's signature peasant dress incorporates the shade of blue.
***Jasmine's turquoise outfit can be considered a shade close to that of blue.
***Pocahontas wears a blue shirt as part of her comfy outfit in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''.
***Mulan was seen wearing a dress with the color blue during the final battle with [[Shan Yu]].
***Tiana was seen wearing a blue princess costume during [[Charlotte La Bouff]]'s welcoming party for Prince Naveen.
***Rapunzel was seen wearing a blue nightgown in her TV series.
***Merida's teal outfit can be considered a shade close to that of blue.
***Raya wears three blue outfits as a child.
**Snow White, Aurora, Belle, Pocahontas, and Merida are the only Princesses to wear their signature outfits at the end of their films.
**Cinderella's first Princess dress was pink. Aurora's first Princess dress was blue. 
***In merchandise, Cinderella's final Princess dress is blue, while Aurora's is pink.
*Merida, Moana, and Raya are currently the only Disney Princesses to not have love interests, though Merida and Moana were originally going to have love interests. [[Young MacGuffin]] was intended to be Merida's Prince during production, before it was ultimately decided she would remain single.
**Merida is unique among the Disney Princesses in that she's the only one to be from a [[Pixar]] film, isn't based on a real person or literature, and doesn't have any onscreen singing moments in her film. Merida's also the first Disney Princess to display an actual accent.
**Moana is also unique among the Disney Princesses in that she's the only one from a Disney film that isn't based on a real person or literature.
**Raya is also unique among the Disney Princesses in that she's the second one from a Disney film that isn't based on a real person or literature, and she also, along with Merida, doesn't have any onscreen singing moments in her film.
*Regarding the relationship status of the Princesses:
**Snow White, Aurora, Ariel, and Rapunzel are the only Princesses who are both royal by birth and marriage as they all end up with men who were also born into royal families.
**Belle and Tiana are the only Princesses born as commoners that become royalty through marriage as they all ended up with men who were born into royal families. Before she got married, Cinderella was not born a monarch or a commoner, but was still born into the upper class before her stepfamily turned her into a servant girl, as her late father was an aristocrat.
***Coincidentally, all three Princesses wear opera gloves and aprons.
**Jasmine's the only Princess who is royal by birth that marries a commoner.
**Pocahontas is the first Disney Princess with two love interests, [[John Smith]] and [[John Rolfe]]. She is the only Disney Princess to not end up with her original love interest however, and falls in love with John Rolfe (who she married in real life) in the sequel. Despite that, John Smith is still regarded as Pocahontas' official love interest.
**Mulan is the only Princess who's neither royal by birth nor marriage. Instead, she marries Li Shang, a captain of the Chinese army.
***However, Mulan would have become a princess had she married [[Prince Jeeki]] at the end of ''[[Mulan II]]''.
**Merida, Moana, and Raya are the only Princesses to remain single as they don't have love interests in their respective films.
***However, it should be noted that Merida had an arranged marriage as a conflict.
**Cinderella, Aurora, and Rapunzel were initially unaware that their love interests were princes when they first met them until they later found out by the end of their films and vice versa with their princes, minus Cinderella who became royalty through marriage.
***Rapunzel found out Eugene is a long-lost prince in the second season finale of ''[[Tangled: The Series|Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure]]''.
*Each Princess is represented by one or more objects:
**Snow White – [[Poisoned Apple|red apple]]
**Cinderella – [[Glass Slipper|glass slipper]] and [[pumpkin]]
**Aurora – golden tiara, spindle, [[Spinning Wheel|spinning wheel]], and pink rose
**Ariel – [[dinglehopper]], seashell, and [[Trident (The Little Mermaid)|trident]]
**Belle – book, red rose, and [[Enchanted Mirror|mirror]]
**Jasmine – the [[Genie's Lamp|magic lamp]], [[Magic Carpet|flying carpet]], and lotus
**Pocahontas – her mother's necklace, feather, compass, and leaves
**Mulan – peach blossom, oil-paper umbrella, fan, [[Sword of Shan Yu|sword]], and [[Mulan's Hair Accessory|hair comb]]
**Tiana – lily pad flower, gumbo pot, and her wedding tiara
**Rapunzel – sun insignia, [[Lanterns|lantern]], paintbrush, and the [[Sundrop Flower]]
**Merida – [[Merida's Bow|bow/arrow]], [[Will O' the Wisps|will o' the wisp]], and [[Merida's Pendant|bear pendant]]
**Moana - [[Heart of Te Fiti]], seashell, her [[Gramma Tala|grandmother]]'s [[Moana's Necklace|necklace]], oar, and pink plumeria
**Raya- [[Dragon Gem]], her Dragon Blade, and Sisu's Necklace
*Except for Merida and Raya, each Princess has their own "I Want" song:
**Snow White – "[[I'm Wishing]]"
**Cinderella – "[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]"
**Aurora – "[[I Wonder]]"
**Ariel – "[[Part of Your World]]"
**Belle – "[[Belle (song)|Belle (reprise)]]"
**Jasmine – "[[Speechless]]" (live-action remake)
**Pocahontas – "[[Just Around the Riverbend]]"
**Mulan - "[[Reflection]]"
**Tiana – "[[Almost There]]"
**Rapunzel – "[[When Will My Life Begin]]"
**Moana - "[[How Far I'll Go]]"

*Each Princess has an animal/non-human best friend:
**Snow White - Seven Dwarfs
**Cinderella - [[Jaq and Gus]]
**Aurora - [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]]
**Ariel - [[Sebastian]], [[Flounder]], and [[Scuttle]]
**Belle - [[Philippe]], [[Lumiere]], and [[Cogsworth]]
**Jasmine - [[Rajah]]
**Pocahontas - [[Meeko]] and [[Flit]]
**Mulan - [[Mushu]], [[Cri-Kee|Cri Kee]], and [[Khan]]
**Tiana - [[Ray]] and [[Louis (The Princess and the Frog)|Louis]]
**Rapunzel - [[Pascal]]
**Merida - [[Angus]]
**Moana - [[Pua (Moana)|Pua]] and [[Heihei|Hei Hei]]
**Raya - [[Tuk Tuk]]

*Mulan and Tiana are the only Princesses to date who have killed the antagonists ([[Shan Yu]] and [[Dr. Facilier]]) in their films. Mulan has actually killed more people than any other Disney character, having buried (almost) an entire Hun army in a snow avalanche from which few escaped and survived.
**Moana and Raya are the only Princesses to redeem their primary antagonist (before turning into Te Kā, [[Te Fiti]] was a source of goodness to the islands, until Maui stole her heart, which ultimately caused her to become a destructive entity). Raya trusted Namaari with the Dragon Gem pieces, and Namaari ended up doing the right thing. They are also the only Princesses so far to encounter two antagonists in one film, Moana encountered both a male and female antagonist in the same film, and Raya encountered two females, a mother and a daughter.
**Cinderella and Rapunzel have both been able to redeem secondary antagonists. Cinderella was able to save her younger stepsister Anastasia from Lady Tremaine's influence in "A Twist In Time", and Rapunzel was able to repair her relationship with Cassandra in "[[Plus Est En Vous]]" when [[Zhan Tiri]] turned on them both.
*The first eight Princesses were once represented as elements on a periodic table at a candy store at Downtown Disney in Orlando, FL.
**Snow White: S - sulfur
**Cinderella: C - carbon
**Aurora: Au - gold
**Ariel: Ai - fictional
**Belle: B - boron
**Jasmine: J - jodium, former name of iodine
**Pocahontas: P - phosphorus
**Mulan: Ml - fictional
*Rapunzel was the first Princess in the franchise to be computer-animated, rather than traditionally hand-drawn. However, she and the other computer-animated Princesses have hand-drawn redesigns when appearing with the other Princesses in merchandise or pictures.
*Several of the Disney Princesses are animated by the same person. [[Marc Davis]] animated Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora. [[Glen Keane]] animated Ariel, Pocahontas, and Rapunzel. [[Mark Henn]] animated Belle, Jasmine, Mulan, and Tiana.
*There are seven Caucasian Princesses: Snow White and Rapunzel (German), Cinderella, Aurora, and Belle (French), Ariel (Mediterranean), and Merida (Scottish). The six non-Caucasian Disney Princesses are Jasmine (Arabian), Pocahontas (Native American), Mulan (Chinese), Tiana (African American), Moana (Polynesian), and Raya (Southeast Asian).
*Tiana is the first Disney Princess to have a public coronation as all the Princesses up to Mulan were already in the line-up when the franchise first launched in the early 2000s.
**Moana is the first Princess to be inducted into the franchise without a public coronation; the method of her inclusion was drawn towards merchandise and social media promotion instead.
**Disney has inducted Raya into the franchise during World Princess week, without a public coronation.
*''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was the only film in the franchise which won an honorary Oscar. ''Brave'' won an Oscar as Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. ''The Little Mermaid'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', ''Aladdin'', and ''Pocahontas'' won two Oscars (Best Soundtrack, Best Original Song). ''Cinderella'', ''Sleeping Beauty'', ''Mulan'', ''The Princess and the Frog'', ''Tangled'', ''Moana'', and ''Raya and The Last Dragon'' received award nominations.
**Merida is one of only three official Disney Princesses, with the other two being Tiana and Moana, to be featured in more than one animated film that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (Brave, Ralph Breaks the Internet).
*Cinderella, Tiana, Rapunzel, Merida, Moana, and Raya are shown as children in their original films. Ariel is shown as a child in her prequel movie, ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]''.
*Ariel is the only Disney Princess who isn't born a human, but she eventually becomes a human.
**Ariel is also the first Disney Princess to have [[Melody|a child]].
*Out of the thirteen Princesses in the line-up, only five are actually seen getting married on screen: [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]], [[Ariel]], [[Jasmine]], [[Tiana]], and [[Rapunzel]]. Jasmine got married in the sequel ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', and Rapunzel got married in the short ''[[Tangled Ever After]]''. In the sequel of her film, ''[[Mulan II]]'', Mulan almost gets married to a prince of a neighboring kingdom for political reasons, but Mushu interferes and stops the marriage.
*Cinderella, Aurora, Belle, Jasmine, and Mulan are so far the only Princesses to have a live-action remake of their original films, though Aurora's film was reimagined to focus on [[Maleficent]]'s point of view. Ariel and Snow White are confirmed to have a live-action remake of their respective movies in development.
*Pocahontas is the only pre-Revival era princess to not have a confirmed live-action adaptation of her film.
*Out of all thirteen Princesses, Snow White, and Cinderella are the only orphaned Princesses; Aurora, Mulan, Rapunzel, Merida, and Moana have both their parents alive; Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas have only their fathers alive; and Tiana is the only one who has her mother alive while her father died.
**Tiana is unique with this as her deceased parent is seen at the beginning of the film and died later on.
**Raya is unique among this as it is unknown if her mother is alive or deceased, since she is never seen or mentioned throughout the film.
*Considering the death of the Evil Queen, Snow White is the only Princess who doesn't have a living parental figure anymore.
*Fa Mulan is the only Disney Princess to have a known last name.
*Aurora and Mulan are the only Disney Princesses to go by aliases (Aurora as "Briar Rose" and Mulan as "Ping"). Although in Aurora's case, she thought Briar Rose was her real name until she was informed of her true identity. In earlier concepts of her film, Raya was going to go by the alias, ''The Dragon Blade''.
*Snow White, Cinderella, Belle, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Rapunzel's names are from their original stories.
*Snow White, Cinderella, Pocahontas, Mulan, Moana, and Raya are the only Princesses to have their names eponymous to the title of their respective films. Aurora, Ariel, Belle, and Tiana are the only Princesses to have film titles referencing to their character. Jasmine is the only Princess to have the title of her film eponymous to her love interest. Rapunzel and Merida are the only Princesses to have adjectives as film titles (although at one point, Rapunzel's film title was originally going to be eponymous during the production).
[[File:Once Upon a Time Disney Princesses.png|thumb|250px|The 10 official Disney Princesses as portrayed in ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.]]
*The Disney Princesses have appeared in the [[ABC]] series ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', with the series centering on [[Emma Swan]], the daughter of Snow White who has to break a curse. The ABC Studios is owned by Disney, and therefore they have rights to the Princesses. [[Snow White]], [[Aurora]], [[Ariel]], [[Belle]], [[Jasmine]], [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]], [[Tiana]], and [[Merida]] have all appeared on the show. The series has also featured two different versions of [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] and [[Rapunzel]].
**Pocahontas, Moana, and Raya are the only Princesses who did not appear on the show, nor did they appear in the [[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|spin-off]].
*Only four of the thirteen Princesses (Jasmine, Mulan, Rapunzel, and Merida) have appeared as playable characters in ''[[Disney Infinity (series)|Disney Infinity]]''.
**Moana was to be added, but has never happened due to the series' cancellation.
*Snow White, Aurora, and Merida are the only official Disney Princesses that appeared in ''[[Sofia the First]]'' who don't have a song.
*Pocahontas, Moana, and Raya are the only Princesses who didn't appear in the series ''Sofia the First''.
**According to a producer, Pocahontas wasn't able to appear in the show because it was difficult to create an episode involving her character.
**''Sofia the First'' ended in 2018, Moana was only inducted as an Official Disney Princess a year later, and Raya was inducted as an Official Disney Princess 4 years later.
*Ironically, despite most of them having a royal status (in Mulan's case, a recognizable status), a majority of the Princesses were seen doing physical labor (chores or servant work).
**Ariel and Raya are the only Princesses who weren't seen doing any form of physical labor.
**Jasmine was the only Princess who was magically forced to do physical labor.
*Except for Cinderella, Ariel, and Merida, all the Disney Princesses are shown to have no siblings.
**Ariel is the youngest of seven daughters ([[King Triton's Daughters|Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista, and Andrina]] are her six older sisters) while Merida's the oldest and only daughter of four children ([[Harris, Hubert, and Hamish]] are her three younger brothers).
**Biologically-speaking, Cinderella's an only child. However, through her father's marriage to [[Lady Tremaine]], she gained two stepsisters, [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]] and [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]].
**Belle was originally going to have [[Belle's Sisters|two older sisters]]. However that idea was ultimately scrapped due to the possibility of them being confused with Cinderella's stepsisters.
***Another concept included Belle having a younger sister named [[Clarice]], although that concept was eventually scrapped too.
**Mulan's an only child in her original animated film, but has [[Hua Xiu|a younger sister]] in her live-action remake.
***The original literary source has stated that Mulan had a younger brother.
**At one point, Moana was going to be [[Moana's Brothers|the youngest and only daughter of ten children]] before the idea was ultimately scrapped.
**Although Rapunzel had no siblings in her original movie, her TV series, Tangled: The Series, revealed that Mother Gothel had a daughter before kidnapping Rapunzel and coincidentally, that daughter became Rapunzel's lady-in-waiting known as [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]]. This would make them adoptive sisters.
**Of the Princesses who officially have siblings, Ariel and Merida are the only ones with biological siblings. Cinderella and Rapunzel are the only ones with no blood-related siblings, but acquired siblings through either marriage or adoption.
*Out of the thirteen Princesses, Ariel, Jasmine, Tiana, Rapunzel, and Moana are the only ones to be the protagonists (or in Jasmine's case, deuteragonist) of animated series based on their respective movies: ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'' for Ariel, ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]'' for Jasmine, ''[[Tiana (TV series)|Tiana]]'' for Tiana, ''[[Tangled: The Series]]'' for Rapunzel, and ''[[Moana, The Series]]'' for Moana.
*In 2011, Jodi Benson, Paige O'Hara, Linda Larkin, Anika Noni Rose, and Lea Salonga were named [[Disney Legends]]. At the ceremony Benson, O'Hara, Rose, and Salonga sang "[[A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]" together. Benson's, O'Hara's, Larkin's, and Rose's plaques are presented together on the same post at the Team ― Disney Michael D. Eisner Building. In 2019, Ming-Na Wen was also named a Disney Legend.
*[[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] have directed the most of the official Disney Princess films, with four entries.
*[[Jodi Benson]], [[Jennifer Hale]], and [[Auli'i Cravalho]] are the only actresses to play more than one Disney Princess in a Disney production. Benson voiced Belle in addition to her regular role as Ariel in episodes of ''[[House of Mouse]]'', Hale served as the voice actress for both Cinderella and Aurora from 2001-2010, and Cravalho played Ariel in the 2019 TV special ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney: The Little Mermaid Live!]]'' after voicing Moana. [[Lea Salonga]] is also the only woman to provide the singing voices for two Disney Princesses: Jasmine and Mulan.
*Mulan, Moana, and Raya are the only Princesses not to have celebrities pose as them for the [[Disney Dream Portrait Series]].
*The whole Disney Princess concept was parodied in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "[[Black Vortex]]" with Gamora going to a parallel universe where she is a princess.
*On [[February 6]], [[2021]], when [[Disney Store|shopDisney]] released merchandise for ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]'', some of them was described as part of Disney Princess collections, specifically the merchandise focusing around the main character, [[Raya]]. This goes as well with the deuteragonist of the film, [[Sisu]]. Disney has now officially inducted Raya into the franchise.
*When [[Vanellope von Schweetz]] tells the Disney Princesses she doesn't have a mom, the motherless Princesses all huddle up to her and say "Neither do we," while the Disney Princesses with mothers can be seen in the camera angle when Rapunzel asks if she thinks all her problems can be solved by a big strong man.
*Raya is the only official Disney Princess to not be featured in the Princess Segment of Ralph Breaks the Internet, reason being that ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' was released in 2018, and ''Raya and The Last Dragon'' was released in 2021, and she was added to the franchise in 2022.
**Raya is the only official Disney Princess who hasn't met Vanellope onscreen.
*Snow White is the only Disney Princess whose father never appears in her original film, but he was originally supposed to.
*Each of the Disney Princess theme songs are a reflection of the way that the Princesses were marketed during the time of the respective song's release. 
**"[[If You Can Dream]]" was released when the Princesses were still marketed as damsels and romantics. 
**"[[The Glow]]" was released when the Princesses were slowly being marketed as independent women. 
**"[[Live Your Story]]" and "[[Starting Now]]" were both released at a time when the Princesses were already established as heroines.
*According to Box Office Mojo, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Tiana, Rapunzel, Merida, Moana, and Raya are the only Princesses to have their films peak at no. 1 at the box office.
*The films of the original six Princesses all became the highest Grossing Animated Film Of The Year during the respective years of their release.
*Aurora and Raya are the only Princesses whose films were not successful at the box office during their initial releases.
**Aurora's film would later gain a strong following during its theatrical re-releases and on home media. Her inclusion in the Disney Princess line-up also helped establish the legacy of her film.
**Raya's film was not initially a hit at the box office due to it being simultaneously released in theaters and on [[Disney+]] with a premium charge due to most cinemas being closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. It would, however, become a huge streaming hit once it became available to all Disney+ subscribers after the premium fee expired.
***Raya is also the first Princess to debut during the COVID-19 pandemic.
