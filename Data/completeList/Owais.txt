====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Owais arrives with [[Zainab]] to greet his cousin, [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] and aunt, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]] at the airport. When they arrive Owais signals them to his direction and greets the pair. Kamala comments that Owais is taller than she remembers, and he in turn, replies that Kamala is still really short, which the group laugh off. Muneeba's mother and Kamala's grandmother, Sana, also arrives to escort Kamala and Muneeba, back to her house. Owais says his goodbyes, as Kamala and Muneeba leave.

The next day, Owais and Zainab arrive to Sana's house to fetch Kamala for a day out. They enter Kamala's room where they find her sleeping with a giant stuffed sloth, which Owais comments on, but Kamala informs him it's simply a napping pillow. They leave as she gets ready and Owais remarks that she can bring her flying teddy bear.

The group’s first visit is to the boat club, but they are denied entrance, because Kamala is wearing jeans, which goes against their policies, forcing them to eat out on the patio. As Zainab laments about missing the buffet, Owais chimes in on missing the AC, which is also placed indoors.

After they eat, Owais and Zainab give Kamala a tour of their surroundings and the historical significances, and the trio browse the local markets. Owais questions if it’s exotic enough for the ABCD's Instagram, and clarifies that ABCD mean American-Born Confused Desi, and Kamala snaps that she knows what it means. She inquires about checking a train station and when Owais questions why, she states it's for historical purposes, but Zainab tells Kamala they're going, as they have friends to meet for coffee, and she should just meet them after. Owais and Zainab then leave.

Owais and Zainab arrive to Sana's home to help Muneeba, who can't seem to locate Kamala. Owais asks if Kamala has a phone, which Muneeba confirms, and he informs his aunt that she can use the "find my phone" feature, which would be included in the family pack, to find where she is. She asks if it's like spyware for parents, which he somewhat confirms, and she questions why she is only just hearing about this.
