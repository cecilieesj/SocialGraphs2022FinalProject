==Background==
Wingnut lived with Gribble ever since before Milo's first arrival on Mars where he was to be his wingman, but was denounced for being a futile pilot. In spite of this denunciation, he also helps Milo and Gribble whenever in trouble.

==Role in the film==
Wingnut is introduced as a male Martian living underground alongside the other male types. [[Gribble]] explains to [[Milo (Mars Needs Moms)|Milo]] that he isn't useful to Gribble's plans as a wingman. He then notices Milo telling Gribble to help him find his mother to which Gribble tells Milo about the way how Martians are cruelly treated by the [[Supervisor]]. He then appears again when Milo and Gribble survive a violent ambush and end up dancing with the underground Martians where he tries to escort the two to safety via entrance to the translucent cavern while some SISS soldiers grab him.

Towards the end of the film, Wingnut is shown to have survived as indicated by him in a prison cell just as Gribble uses a computer to open up his cell, freeing Wingnut from his cell alongside other underground Martians in their cells. Later while observing a tragic footage of Martian hatchlings being transported to underground, Gribble devises a plan for Wingnut and the other underground Martians to save the Martian babies from demise. Later when Milo saves his mother from a gruesome demise, Wingnut and the other underground Martians burst to the spot where the Nanny-bots raise the babies, stopping the Supervisor's devious plan.

Later when the Supervisor's lies are discovered just as Ki shows a true Martian family mural on the translucent cavern area, Wingnut and the other Martians turn against her for her betrayal and lies just as the Martians celebrate their rejoice. Wingnut's further fate is unknown.

==Trivia==
*During the scene where Gribble frees Wingnut from his prison cell, he shouts "Come on out, you freakazoid!", presumably a reference to an animated TV series called "Freakazoid!".
**In that same scene, Milo says, "Who let the dogs out?", a reference to a popular song performed by popular band, Baha Men.
*Wingnut's voice actor, Kevin Cahoon, previously played [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Ed]] in the [[The Lion King (musical)|Broadway production of ''The Lion King'']], which led to his satisfaction for the audition of his character he chose in ''Mars Needs Moms''.
**Coincidentally, ''[[The Lion King]]'' received a limited theatrical 3D re-release on [[September 16]], six months after ''Mars Needs Moms'' was released on the same year.
