He is a stuffed teddy bear and [[Penny (The Rescuers)|Penny's]] best friend. His face is based on [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Penny takes him almost everywhere she goes and loves and cares for him deeply. Though no one might be able to see it, Teddy also loves and cares for Penny and sometimes serves as a source of comfort for her. In the film, Teddy is used as a threat by the evil [[Madame Medusa]] that Penny would never see him again unless she finds the [[Devil's Eye]]. Later, Medusa hides it in his stuffing, but Penny gets him back and they both escape from Medusa's clutches. He is later seen with Penny who has finally been adopted.
