'''Ashtin Carnaby''' (otherwise known as '''Carnaby''') is the secondary antagonist in ''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]'', acting as the main antagonist in the film's second segment. Described by his Sam McKeane as "slipperier than a spotted toad in a rainstorm."

==Role in the film==
In the film, an artifact hunter ([[Sam McKeane|Mr. McKean]]) in Mr. Whitmore's employ was attacked by Chakashi's familiars, being badly scratched up. Taking advantage of the empty home, Carnaby proceeded to steal pottery McKean had taken from a hidden Indian village.

Upon meeting Team Atlantis, Carnaby became consumed by greed at the idea of finding an entire village of artifacts to sell at his trading post. Upon reaching the village, where it was revealed an Atlantean was responsible for the emergence of several Native American and Mesoamerican cultures, Carnaby knocked out the group with a homemade prairie grass mixture and tried to bury them alive with dynamite. Chakashi attacked Carnaby, turning him one of the many coyote spirits that he commanded.
