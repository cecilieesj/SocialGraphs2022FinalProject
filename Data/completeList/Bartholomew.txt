'''Bartholomew''' was one of [[Ratigan]]'s henchmen in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1986]] animated feature film, ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''. When he called [[Ratigan]] a rat, he was eaten by [[Felicia]] the cat.

==Role in the film==
Bartholomew is an alcoholic. He is constantly seen drinking from a beer mug and becomes disappointed whenever he runs out. During [[The World's Greatest Criminal Mind|Ratigan's song]], when Ratigan dumps a bottle of champagne into his water fountain, Bartholomew gets very excited and immediately runs over to the fountain, where he starts drinking from it. Then Ratigan kicks him and Bartholomew falls and starts swimming around in it. When Ratigan talks about his history with Basil, Bartholomew starts crying about the part that Ratigan never had a moment's peace in mind.

Later, when they are finishing up a verse of the song, he drunkenly says, "To Ratigan, the world's greatest rat!", which makes Ratigan very mad (as he despises being called a rat). He throws him outside the hideout and summons [[Felicia]] with a bell. However, Bartholomew is too drunk to notice her, and she easily catches and eats him. Bartholomew starts drunkenly singing the praises to Ratigan, and is swallowed whole just as he is about to call his vengeful boss a rat again. After a short period of mourning from the other henchmen, Ratigan suggests that they finish the song before he has Felicia eat the rest of them, which they do out of fright.
