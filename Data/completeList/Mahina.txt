'''Mahina''' is a character who was featured in the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, "[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]".

==History==
===Background===
Mahina serves as one of the four emcee birds featured in the Japan-exclusive incarnation of the Enchanted Tiki Room. Throughout the attraction, she and the other emcee birds try to investigate the case of something weird going on in the Tiki Room attraction. After the culprit behind the mess is revealed to be [[Stitch]], Mahina and the other emcee birds scold Stitch for disrupting the show to which Stitch then apologizes to them for doing pranks in the Tiki Room. After Stitch accepts to perform in the show after promising not to do anymore pranks, Mahina then performs with Stitch with the other emcee birds just as they participate with him during the end of the show.

===Development History===
After [[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Get the Fever!]] closed in early [[2008]], the hosts from this incarnation of the attraction, Danno, Lava, Scats, and Buddy, are replaced by four new unique bird hosts: Mahina, Manu, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli when the attraction opened on summer 2008 where the incarnation features a storyline different from the one in the original incarnation.

==Role in the attraction==
Mahina and the other four emcee birds are introduced singing the musical number "[[Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride]]" to which during the song, the lights go out just as the four emcee birds look at the strange graffiti written on the wall whom Waha Nui thinks it is the Big Kahuna who is behind the mess, which Manu warns the other emcee birds, telling them that if they make the Big Kahuna angry, the Tiki Room would be in trouble. Mahina explains to him that the writing on the wall says "Aloha e komo mai" to which Hau'oli explains that this writing is the title of their next musical number to which Mahina explains to the other emcee birds that the tiki gods must be knowing about this song just as the musical number "Aloha, E Komo Mai" begins. During the song, Mahina performs her part during the musical number just as the other Tiki Birds sing along with her followed by Manu telling everyone to sing along.

After the song, Mahina listens to Manu and Waha Nui discussing with each other about the "Big Kahuna" to which the musical number "[[Hawaiian War Chant]]" begins. As the [[Orchids]] begin their next musical number, Mahina notices Stitch disrupting the show upon noticing Stitch's arms popping out of the flowerbeds as Stitch is disrupting the show much to Waha Nui's worry as Manu warns Mahina, Waha Nui, and Hau'oli to not upset the Big Kahuna in which Waha Nui plans to cancel the musical number to which the song suddenly ends.

As the emcee birds are discussing about the Big Kahuna, Mahina asks Waha Nui to know if he is all right while Manu plans on giving out the next musical number "[[On the Beach at Waikiki]]" with the [[Showgirl Birds|Winged Wahines]] performing their part after Waha Nui tells Manu to give his plan to present the next song throughout the show. Noticing the plastic blue ears on their heads, Mahina notices the Winged Wahines that they will leave for Waikiki and not finish their song as Mahina asks Manu to know what he will do know to which he sings that he will "fly off to the beach at Waikiki".

After the song, the culprit behind the trouble is revealed to be [[Stitch]] who was playing pranks throughout the show just as Mahina and the other emcee birds worriedly notice this and it is revealed that the "Big Kahuna" is actually Stitch doing pranks. Mahina and the other emcee birds scold Stitch for causing trouble in the show. Worried that being punished in the Tiki Room is no fun for him, Stitch then promises not to do anymore pranks in the show to which a reprise of "Aloha, E Komo Mai" plays throughout the show just as the emcee birds accept Stitch's promise. Mahina then sings with the other emcee birds during the reprise while singing with Stitch accepted in the show. As the song pauses, Mahina is happy that Stitch is accepted to be in the show after promising not to do pranks anymore just as Mahina and the inhabitants of the Tiki Room sing with Stitch accepted to perform with the entire Tiki Room cast (except for the Winged Wahines who left during the show) just as they sing along happy about being in Stitch's ohana. As the show ends, Mahina and the other emcee birds bid a farewell to the guests as she and the other emcee birds discuss that the "Big Kahuna" does not exist and it is actually Stitch the whole time throughout the show.
