'''Clarice''' is a character that was deleted from the final film version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. She was [[Belle]]'s younger sister. She was cut because Linda Woolverton, after rewriting the film from scratch at Katzenberg's order, wanted to place more emphasis on Belle's loneliness.

==Background==
Clarice loved her family very much and took any opportunity she could to assist them.

==Role in [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|the film]]==
Clarice is first seen in the alternate opening happily playing in the yard of [[Maurice|her father's]] mansion with he and Belle. When her [[Marguerite|Aunt Marguerite]] arrives, she is shown to be somewhat afraid of her and runs to hide between Maurice's legs. Later, after her family has moved into [[Belle's cottage|the cottage]], she, her father, and her sister enjoy a happy moment together dancing to the music played by her mother's former music box that has just become Belle's birthday gift. When tax collectors arrive and tell Maurice that he must either pay them the money he owes or lose the house as well as [[Philippe|Orson]], Clarice becomes upset and argues that they simply cannot take the horse. When Maurice has left to sell the music box and Marguerite invites [[Gaston]] to the house for tea, Clarice attempts to flatter him by serving him tea before her aunt shoos her out of the room so that he and Belle can talk privately. She is last seen on the night her father has failed to return asking her sister whether or not he has got lost in the storm.
