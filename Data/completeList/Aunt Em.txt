====Before the First Curse====
After Dorothy returns from [[Land of Oz|Oz]], Aunt Em is the only one who believes Dorothy about her travels to the magical land, as the rest of the family tried to have Dorothy committed. Aunt Em then gives [[Toto]] to Dorothy as a gift and dies soon after.

====After the Third Curse====
After Aunt Em dies, she is sent to the [[Underworld]], where she runs a [[Aunt Em's Diner|diner]]. She is rivals with the [[Blind Witch]], who is her business competition.

After the heroes discover Dorothy is under a sleeping curse, placed on her by [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]], they try to find ways to get back to Oz to save her.

The heroes go to the Blind Witch's diner asking her if they know anything about Aunt Em. The Blind Witch reveals her hatred for Aunt Em and tells them where to find her diner. She greets them there, and Emma tells her they are trying to help Dorothy, as she needs True Love's Kiss to wake her from the sleeping curse. She asks Aunt Em to blow a kiss into a bottle. However, after Aunt Em takes the bottle, she melts into a puddle. Shocked, the heroes question what happened, and [[Hades]] reveals himself, explaining that he laced her soup with water from the River of Lost Souls. He wipes her up with a dish rag and drains her into a jar. Because of this, her headstone in the Underworld cemetery becomes cracked, indicating she's gone to a worse place. Hades later empties her into the River with the rest of the lost souls.
