==Background==
Eugenia Ferdinand-Ferdinand is the vice-president of the New Quackmore Institute. She was working for [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and now she is currently working for [[Donald Duck]], but has also a rivalry relantionship with him for who will become the new president of The New Quackmore Institute.

==Role in the series==

In "[[Mount Rushmore or Less]]", Eugenia Ferdinand-Ferdinand arrives at Clinton Coot's cabana and explains that she has arrived for the annual soirée and as the inhabitants of Clinton's cabana are residents, everyone must attend as an evening of elegance and sophistication, asking the Caballeros to set it out. [[April, May, and June]] remember what Eugenia said to the group to which the three dress Xandra properly while the Caballeros are playing cards. Later when, [[Baron Von Sheldgoose]] and his ancestor [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] return to their mansion, they approach Eugenia who explains to them that the annual soirée is happening tonight, demanding Sheldgoose to explain his absences and if he doesn't explain himself about his absences, Eugenia will become the new president of the New Quackmore Institute. Felldrake then tells his ancestor to prepare for the soirée. Then as Sheldgoose continues planning to become president as he plans to seek revenge against Eugenia, Felldrake warns that they must retrieve the Spark of Life which is more important than his evil plots. Outside, the Caballeros see Eugenia outside to upon seeing her, she leads the board members to enter the mansion, granting access to her and the guests to which the Caballeros attempt to follow them but cannot enter so the three decide to find an alternate way to enter. Eugenia is then present during a meeting with Felldrake where Sheldgoose delivers a speech of becoming the new president of the Institute to which the members are furious about Sheldgoose's lies and nonsense to which a nearby chef warns him that there is a bear in the house. Suddenly, [[Humphrey the Bear]] arrives and scares the guests away, leaving the speech incomplete as the guests led by Eugenia run away as the Caballeros notice Sheldgoose going after Humphrey in the mansion.

In "[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]", Eugenia and the other residents of the New Quackmore Institute react to the storm caused by Sheldgoose, fearing that Sheldgoose is destroying the New Quackmore Institute while Felldrake continues to evolve into a more powerful monster to destroy the world. With the New Quackmore Institute in ruins, Eugenia is furious of what Sheldgoose did to the New Quackmore Institute to which upon facing her, the mention of the institute being her's made the evil sorcerer call and turn Eugenia into a rat-faced worm, much to his evil plans. With everything back to normal after Felldrake was defeated, Eugenia approaches Sheldgoose where she strips him from being president of the Institute as Eugenia gives her own position to herself as the president of the Institute. April, May, and June show Eugenia the document they fixed where they explain to her that should Sheldgoose's title of being president be stripped off, the title would pass on to Clinton Coot (or in this case, Donald Duck). Showing Eugenia the document, Debbie Affidavit declares Donald as the acting president of the Institute until a proper election can be held to which Eugenia tells her to know who will see who wins the presidency just before Xandra, the Caballeros, Daisy, the nieces, Ari, and Humphrey the Bear move to the mansion Sheldgoose used to live at.

==Trivia==
*The name "Eugenia" is the female version of the name "Eugene".
*Her appearance is like as a male peacock (because male peacocks have blue feathers with tail feathers colored in green with circles on them); in real-life, female peacocks have brown feathers with gray tones and their tails are much shorter than males.
** It's possible that she may, in fact, be transgender, which would explain the male peafowl plumage.
*It is possible she likes the color pink because she wears pink clothes.
