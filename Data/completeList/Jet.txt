In Into the Unknown, Ricky sees Jet for the first time and tries to say hello but, Jet ignores him. When Ricky goes to his cabin to grab his snowsuit, he tries to talk to Jet again, but Jet still ignores him. When he talks, Ricky asks if he sing as well, but Jet says not anymore. Later when Jet decided to audition for the musical, he hands Jet the paper and encourages him to sing, later calling him a "little Ricky". During the montage while Nini sings ''You Never Know'', Ricky leaves a note on Jet's bed saying "Pretty good for a guy who doesn't sing" but after sharing a look, Jet crumbles the note up and throws it away. In The Woman in the Woods, Jet runs into Ricky while he's at the shrine. After making a joke about eating the food at the shrine Ricky asks him about why he doesn't sing anymore and he opens up about having a bad music teacher and being misdiagnosed with ADD. Later while EJ's singing ''The Ballad of Susan Fine'' Ricky playfully hits Jet's arm with twizzlers like he's playing the drums. After when Maddox gets upset with him for making a joke out of her favorite Camp tradition he mentions that Ricky wanted him to relax and open up.
