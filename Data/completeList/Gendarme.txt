While not physically seen in the final film, he and his troops are referred to several times by the film's cast.

In an alternate scene, the two local crooks [[Honest John|J. Worthington Foulfellow]] and [[Gideon (Pinocchio)|Gideon]] hide from him while he patrols the [[Village (Pinocchio)|village]] in search of crime. At nightfall, he crosses paths with [[Geppetto]] searching for [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]]. The Gendarme obstructs a poster advertising [[Stromboli]]'s puppet show depicting Pinocchio's face, causing the saddened Geppetto to keep on searching.

The Gendarme makes a brief appearance in the Disney theme park attraction [[Pinocchio's Daring Journey]], standing guard at [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]] and keeping eyes on the two aforementioned scoundrels Honest John Foulfellow and Gideon.
