{{Quote|I would rather be a good man than a great king.|Thor to [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], disguised as [[Odin Borson|Odin]]|Thor: The Dark World}}

'''Thor Odinson''', simply known as '''Thor''', is a superhero from [[Marvel Comics]] and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. He is the eponymous protagonist of the ''Thor'' films and one of the protagonists of the ''Avengers'' films. Thor is an [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] warrior-prince, the God of Thunder, and a self-proclaimed protector of Earth. Thor subsequently became well known for his actions on Earth, which included acting as a founding member of the [[Avengers]] despite being the only Avenger that is not from Earth. Thor is mostly known wielded the mystical war hammer [[Mjolnir]], which controls the weather, but he himself has god-like strength, durability, and agility.

Thor is based on the thunder god of the same name from Norse mythology. This version of the character was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], Larry Lieber, Russ Heath, Werner Roth, and Don Rico.

==Background==
===Personality===
Originally, Thor was very arrogant and full of himself and sought battle to prove his strength and heroism. He was also very short-sighted, acting on impulse or however he felt justified. Thor believed that he was entitled to the Asgard throne, and eagerly awaited his coronation.

For his reckless actions and behavior, Thor's father [[Odin Borson|Odin]] stripped him of his powers, titles, and rights, banishing him to Midgard until he proved himself worthy of his power. The plan worked and he returned humbled and much wiser and even thanked his father for the lessons he learned.

After his exile and subsequent return, Thor has become a noble warrior and a man of honor. He now thinks through his actions, trying to compromise before fighting. He fights not for glory but for the greater good. He also realized he was not yet ready to be king of Asgard, eventually deciding to abdicate his claim to it to better safeguard the well-being of the universe. He has dislike of mortal technology and science for creating supervillains and admires heroes with courage, honor, compassion, and the gift of battle. He was very wise about mortal tales and criticizing villains about their abilities they boasted. He has occasional difficulty with human and Earth culture but appears to have become more accustomed to it while working with the Avengers.

He has a large amount of respect for family, who have defined his personality—his father Odin and his mother [[Frigga]], who he loves very much. Had it not been for his wise father, he would still be full of arrogance and irresponsibility, a fact that he is well aware of. His mother's similarly wise but gentle touch taught him to fight for good. He initially has a complicated relationship with his troublemaking brother [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], upset with him for the trouble he has caused on Earth and Asgard. However, he does care for his brother, and wishes for him to stop his dangerously mischievous ways. Despite this, Thor is not above fighting his brother if it means protecting others.

===Physical appearance===
Thor is a very tall and well-built Asgardian male; he has very large biceps and long, muscular legs. Fair-skinned and blue-eyed, he has golden blond hair that grows slightly during the events of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, reaching just around his shoulders by ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''. His hair was shaved in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', while forced to be a gladiator. He also has moderate amounts of facial hair. During his battle with Hela, he lost his right eye and wore an eyepatch. He is given a new eye by Rocket.

He wears Asgardian-style clothing, reminiscent of Vikings, complete with a Viking-style helmet, although it is only worn in his animated appearances. He wears black armor with silver circles along the torso, with silver chainmail sleeves. He has red wristbands, a large golden belt and blue pants. In animated appearances, he wears tall golden boots. In his Cinematic Universe portrayals, they are the same blue as his pants.

His appearances are most often depicted with him wielding Mjölnir in his hands until its destruction.

===Powers and abilities===
[[File:Thor's Hammer.png|left|250px]]
He possess a number of superhuman attributes common among the Asgardians, however, as the son of Odin, some are considerably more developed than those of the vast majority of his race. He is the second most powerful Asgardian, with only his father being more powerful than him, and is one of the two strongest Avengers alongside the Hulk. Thor also has extensive combat prowess learned through centuries of training and battlefield experience.

====Powers====
*'''Asgardian Physiology:''' As an Asgardian, Thor has several superhuman abilities.
**'''Superhuman Strength:''' Thor has extraordinary strength, easily surpassing most other Asgardians. Typically in battle he will send opponents flying with a single blow, and has proven capable of outperforming a number of much larger opponents in tests of strength. With his bare hands, he showed himself able hold his own against the Hulk, and has overthrown a Leviathan with a single hammer blow. 
**'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Thor's advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than the musculature of a human, and his fitness is also greater than most other Asgardians. His muscles produce minimal fatigue toxins during physical activity, enabling him to exert himself at peak capacity for extended periods without tiring.
**'''Invulnerability:''' Thor's skin, muscle, and bone are extremely dense and durable compared to that of humans, contributing to a proportionately greater mass and extreme physical durability. Thor can withstand impact trauma up to blows from the Hulk with [[The Avengers (film)|a bloodied nose]] at best to [[Thor: Ragnarok|minor injuries]] at worst. Thor was hit by a direct lightning strike from Gungnir, showing no injury. He was struck several times by Algrim, with only a few cuts to his face. He has also fallen from great heights without sustaining lasting damage. Stripped of his powers and banished to Earth, he was hit with a car twice, suffering only slight daze.
**'''Superhuman Speed:''' Thor as an Asgardian can move faster than even the finest human athlete regardless of his great size, build and body density. He displayed this power while fighting Hulk in the Helicarrier as he tackled the Hulk through the wall of Helicarrier in a matter of second appearing as a blur.
**'''Superhuman Agility:''' Thor's agility, balance, and bodily coordination make him a great warrior in battle. He moves with incredible grace and speed despite his size and body density. He was able to dodge the wing of a jet fighter thrown at him by the Hulk while they battled in the hangar bay.
**'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Thor's injuries heal at a staggering rate. He has recovered from moderate penetration wounds to the abdomen in a matter of minutes, and has been able to stand to recover quickly from heavy impact trauma, including blows from the Hulk and a high impact fall. With Mjölnir in hand, his recovery has extended to complete bodily restoration after suffering mortal injuries in a non-powered state.
**'''Superhuman Longevity:''' Thor has a lifespan far longer than that of a human being. While not truly immortal, he is known to be over one-thousand years of age.
**'''Atmokinesis:''' Though Thor's relying on Mjölnir has caused a lack of practice, Thor is able to control weather without relying on Mjölnir. So far he has been seen only creating rain and electricity without relying on Mjölnir.
***'''Electrokinesis:''' Thor is able to generate electricity from his body without relying on Mjölnir.

====Abilities====
*'''Honed Agility:''' Centuries spent perfecting the art of close quarters combat have kept Thor at peak levels of fitness, and ensure that his coordination and reflexes are maintained at peak levels. He moves with surprising grace and speed for someone of his size, as evidenced when he easily ducked under the wing of a plane the Hulk threw at him during their Helicarrier battle, and during his many fights where he is shown easily maneuver around his foes.
*'''Master Hand-To-Hand Combatant:''' Thor is a superbly skilled warrior with a high aptitude and mastery of close quarters combat. He is known to be cunning and intuitive in battle, and has a wealth of experience from numerous conflicts throughout the Nine Realms. Even with his power stripped from him, he was able to fight, and astonishingly gain the advantage over, nearly a dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers, prompting an impressed Agent Coulson to comment that he made "some of the most highly trained soldiers in the world look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops".
*'''Master Hammer Fighter:''' After centuries of practice wielding Mjölnir, Thor is a master of short-handled mace combat. His technique involves wielding the hammer primarily by the handle to affect powerful close-range blows, and sometimes by the strap to achieve a fluid series of cyclical motions more commonly employed with mixed actions where the hammer's other traits are used. His technique also extends to using the hammer as a thrown weapon, which he does frequently to strike targets beyond his reach.
*'''High-level intellect/Master Tactician/Leader:''' For centuries Thor has led Asgard, including highly skilled warriors such as Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, into battle against forces with great leadership and employing strategies and tactics adapted from various civilizations across the Nine Realms, including forgotten ones. Although he is sometimes reckless and impulsive, Thor is highly intelligent.

====Weakness====
Thor has no true weaknesses, as he is immune to every known disease, toxin, illness, and ailment. However he will eventually die of old age (as Odin himself stated that Asgardians "are born, live, and die, just as humans do", though it will take around 5,000 or more years). The only things that can affect him are high-level magic users (such as Odin), or beings of similar or greater strength (such as the Hulk or Kurse), and the only material he seems to be unable to damage is Vibranium due to its ability to absorb and reflect vibrations, as shown when he fails to break through Captain America's shield or when he could not destroy Ultron's main body.

====Equipment====
*'''[[Mjolnir]]:''' Thor was entrusted with Mjölnir, a mystical hammer forged from the heart of a dying star. Odin himself stated that Mjölnir's power has no equal, as either a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build. Mjölnir, which resembles a mallet rather than a war hammer, has a number of elemental powers. Constructed of uru and combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin, it is for all intents and purposes, indestructible. It has deflected blasts from the Destroyer and reflected a blast back into the Destroyer and several energy blasts from invading aliens. Thor often uses the hammer as a physical weapon, with almost nothing being capable of withstanding a hammer blow or throw. A few examples of the abilities Thor has shown with Mjölnir are:
**'''Weather Control:''' Wielding Mjölnir grants Thor the ability to control the base elements of a storm. It can control the elements and can create giant raging electrical storms complete with thunder, lightning, hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, and torrential rains at a moment's notice. He summoned a class 5 tornado to battle the Destroyer and control the elements. He is remembered in myth and legends by the mortals of Midgard as the Norse Thunder God who used Mjölnir to summon rain, wind, thunder, lightning and more.
**'''Lightning:''' Thor's main weapon using Mjölnir is his lightning bolt. He summoned a lightning bolt strong enough to destroy a large piece of landscape in Jotunheim, a lightning bolt to knock down Loki on the Bifrost bridge, shot a lightning bolt at Iron Man that boosted his armor's power reserve to 475%. Thor shot a sustained lightning bolt at the portal of the Chitauri to ravage the re-enforcements that were swarming through
**'''Material Transformation:''' By summoning lightning from the sky into Mjölnir, Thor's clothing was transformed into his battle armor.
**'''Flight:''' Thor is capable of hurling Mjölnir with great force and, by holding onto the leather thong, is capable of flying through the air at tremendous speeds. How fast is not specified, but he was able to remain aloft in the middle of a Class 5 tornado, and traverse the distance from his father's chambers to Heimdall's observatory in seconds.
**'''Energy Projection:''' With Mjölnir, Thor can project powerful mystical blasts of energy. He can even channel energies for stronger energy attacks. With Mjölnir, Odin projected a powerful mystical blast of energy using it to channel an energy blast through it, taking away all of Thor's superhuman powers and destroys what was left of Thor's armor after stripping much of it from him and throwing him into the Bifrost.
**'''Mystical Link:''' Mjölnir obeys Thor's commands as though it were alive. Mjölnir went to Thor when it was in a crater from miles away, it came to him in seconds. Mjölnir will return to Thor whenever he throws it at an opponent. While battling the Hulk in a hanger of the Helicarrier, Thor summoned Mjölnir from another room and it came crashing through the Helicarrier to reach him.
**'''Worthiness Enchantment:''' Odin has ensured that only those who are deemed worthy may wield Mjölnir, and this test of worthiness effectively signals the worthiness to rule Asgard itself. The effect of this is that Mjölnir seems to be endlessly heavy to anyone who attempts to lift it, and it remains rooted to the spot if they try. Not even the Hulk, with his vast strength, can lift it, and attempts to use machinery to move it by avoiding direct contact are equally ineffective. Mjölnir's primary wielder is Thor, however, Odin can also heft the hammer with ease. Steve Rogers has budged it slightly and eventually was able to wield it, and the Vision has also proven capable of both lifting the hammer and wielding it in combat.
**'''Instantaneous Travel:''' Thor can also call upon Heimdal and the Bifrost Bridge whenever he desires, giving him nearly instantaneous travel between the realms. While on Earth, he frequently rides with the Avengers in one of the Quinjets for convenience, even though he can fly much faster than they can.
*'''Stormbreaker:''' A mystical axe crafted by Eitri and Groot, Thor requested this weapon be made so that he could return to Earth to help in the battle against Thanos and kill the Mad Titan. Stormbreaker is a more powerful version of Mjölnir and helps Thor focus his powers, in addition to being made out of Uru to withstand incredibly powerful energies like the [[Infinity Stones]], and has the power to destroy Thanos. It can also summon the Bifrost even after the bridge was apparently destroyed, enabling Thor inter-dimensional travel. After Mjølnir's reassembly, Thor allowed his adoptive daughter Love to wield Stormbreaker in combat.

====''Thor''====
[[File:ThorCeremony.png|thumb|250px|Thor at his coronation.]]
Centuries after the victory of the Asgardians over the Jotuns, Odin decides to make Thor King of Asgard. However, when Odin is about to name Thor king, he feels the presence of Frost Giants. Odin, Thor and Loki go to the vault and discovered that three Frost Giants have killed two Einherjar, Thor tells his father that Asgard must lead an army to Jotunheim, but Odin tells him that is prohibited. Despite the prohibition of his father, Thor and his friends go to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, while in Jotunheim, Thor kills and injures many Jotuns but in the course of the fight, he and his allies are surrounded by the Frost Giants.

Odin arrives in Jotunheim to ask Laufey to forgive Thor's actions but Laufey is unwilling to forgive him then Odin attacks him. Back in Asgard Thor argues with his father which caused his banishment from Asgard and the loss of his powers, falling to Earth he meets Jane and her friends. In this meeting, Thor is electrocuted by Darcy when she feels "freaked out" by his behavior. In the morning Thor wakes up in a hospital which manages to escape only to be hurt again, this time by Jane.

With the help of Jane, Thor infiltrates in one of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facilities to retrieve his hammer. When he fails to lift Mjölnir, Coulson sends agents to capture him. Coulson asks him some questions but he does not answer any, suddenly Selvig informs Coulson that Thor is his colleague "Donald Blake". Despite not believing him, Coulson releases Thor. The next day Thor is visited by his friends, the Warriors Three and Sif who informs him that Odin is still alive.

[[File:ThorComeback.png|thumb|left|250px|Thor regains his powers.]]
Later, Thor offered Loki his life in exchange to leave in peace to the people then the Destroyer hits him, with this Thor gets his worthiness to wield Mjölnir. Thor defeats the Destroyer with one blow of his Mjölnir, after this he and Coulson make an alliance and promises Jane to return soon. Back in Asgard, Thor and Loki have an intense battle, which results in the destruction of Bifrost Bridge.

When they're about to fall into the abyss and Odin comes to rescue them, Loki sees that his actions have not earned him the respect he wanted, so he allows himself to fall into the space while Thor laments the loss of his brother. Days later, Thor makes peace with his father and talk with Heimdall about the possibility of returning to Earth.

====''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''====
[[File:ThorTheAvengers.png|thumb|250px|Thor in ''The Avengers''.]]
When Asgard discovers the dastardly Loki is upon Earth, seeking the Tesseract, Odin uses dark sorcery to send Thor to Earth to stop him. Thor lands on the jet in which Loki is being escorted back to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier by Captain America, Iron Man, and the Black Widow and takes Loki from their custody. Thor tries to convince Loki to give up his plans and return home to Asgard with the Tesseract, though Loki still resents him.

Iron Man attacks him and the couple trade blows when Iron Man refuses to allow Thor to take Loki away. When Captain America intervenes and asks Thor to put Mjölnir down if he's against Loki's ambitions. In response, Thor bashes Iron Man aside and brings his hammer down on Captain America, who blocks it with his shield. The shield absorbs the impact, shocking Thor, who realizes they have the same goal and stops fighting.

They return to the Helicarrier, where Loki is put into a cell designed to hold the Hulk and dispose of him if necessary. Thor is quick to point out that while Loki is unstable he is still his adoptive brother. Later he asks Coulson about Jane Foster and is told that she was moved to a secure location when Loki returned and Erik Selvig was put under his control. Thor is asked by Fury if he is capable of inflicting torture on Loki to reveal his goals.

Later as Thor and the others argue, Loki's mind-controlled henchmen blow up one of the Helicarrier's engines and help free Loki, also triggering Banner to unwillingly transform into the Hulk and go on a rampage. Thor fights the Hulk after preventing him from killing Black Widow, being the only one who can match him in strength. After the Hulk has been lured off of the Helicarrier, Thor goes to make sure Loki is still contained. When he arrives the cell door is open, and Thor tries to stop Loki leaving. It turns out to be an illusion and Thor gets trapped in the cell. Loki threatens to drop the cage when Coulson confronts him with a gun made from the Destroyer. Loki stabs Coulson and proceeds to drop a horrified Thor. As he plummets towards Earth, Thor manages to smash free from the cell just in time to avoid the impact.

After recovering, Thor uses Mjölnir's powers to replenish his strength before he heads to New York City to confront Loki. Arriving at Stark Tower, Loki has used the Tesseract to open a portal allowing the Chitauri to invade Earth. Thor again tries to convince him to stop, since the Chitauri are destroying the world he wants to rule. Failing, he briefly clashes with his brother before Loki flees on a Chitauri vessel. Serving as First Sergeant of the group, Thor joins the team leader Captain America, Hawkeye, and the Black Widow on the battlefield and starts helping to fight the Chitauri just before both Iron Man and the Hulk join them.

Captain America orders Thor to use his power to stem the flow of enemies coming through the portal, which he does use lightning bolts. He then joins the battle once more and helps Hulk bring down a Leviathan. During the battle, he gets punched by Hulk for their earlier fight at the Helicarrier. Soon, Iron Man sends a nuclear missile intended for the city through the portal. This destroys the Chitauri base, causing the forces to be cut off from their power source and die, while the Black Widow closes the portal.

Once the crisis is over, Thor joins the other Avengers in confronting Loki, who had already been beaten into submission by the Hulk, and takes him into custody. After claiming the Tesseract, Thor takes Loki back to Asgard, by opening a portal with it and leaves the other Avengers in Central Park.

====''[[Iron Man 3]]''====
One year after the Battle of New York, when the evil scientist and terrorist [[Aldrich Killian]] kept Tony captured in his mansion he mentioned Thor when he referred to him as the "Big Dude with the Hammer".

====''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''====
In the beginning of the film, Thor and his allies continue to maintain peace within the [[Nine Realms]], recently fending off a group of [[Marauders]] attempting to start a war in the realms. During this war, Thor serves as a general in the Asgardian army.

On Earth, Thor returns to Jane after the latter accidentally absorbed the [[Aether]]. Foster first slaps him in the face twice, before he grabs her and gets beamed back to Asgard.

Soon, however, Asgard is invaded by the [[Dark Elves]]. During the invasion, Thor sees his mother die. In anger, he shoots a lightning bolt to [[Malekith]], the leader of the [[Dark Elves]] and throws [[Mjolnir]] into him and [[Algrim]]. Through this throw, he sends them back to their ship. The Asgardians then held a funeral for [[Frigga]] and the other dead Asgardians. Because Thor knows that Malekith will return he wants to move Jane, but Odin won't let him. He then comes up with a plan, for which he frees Loki. They, together with Jane, use one of the ships from the Dark Elves to leave the palace. While they are trying to leave [[Sif]] and [[Volstagg]] delay the guards. When the Dark Elves ship flies next to Bifrost Bridge, Thor pushes Loki out of the ship and jumps out himself, with Jane in his arms. They all land on an Asgardian Skiff driven by [[Fandral]]. During their escape, they get hunted by other Asgardian skiffs, but Fandral takes out those soldiers. Loki then brings them to Svartalfheim trough a secret passage.

On Svartalfheim, Thor and Loki start having an argument about trust. Loki says Thor can't trust him and uses his dagger to cut off Thor's hand. Loki then brings Jane to Malekith and says that all he wants in return for her is a good spot to see Asgard burn.

Malekith starts to draw the Aether out of Jane and while still doing this Loki turns of the illusion they used for Thor his hand. Thor then shoots a lighting bold which causes the [[Aether]] to explode. Loki saves Jane by jumping on top of her. Malekith, who already gained enough power leaves and tells Algrim to take care of them. He tries to do this by throwing a Black Hole Grenade in the air in which Loki almost gets sucked. Algrim then starts to beat up Thor but gets stabbed in the back by Loki. Algrim does not get hurt by this and uses the sword, which is still in his chest, to pierce Loki, who manages to press one of Algrim his bombs which causes him to die. At the same moment, Loki dies in Thor's arms.

Thor and Jane then enter a cave filled with objects that didn't come back when Jane and the others played in the storage house. Jane grabs the keys of Ian's car and then they walk further into the cave and get transported to the storage house in England.

When Thor and the others reach Greenwich, the Nine Realms are almost in line. Thor starts to fight Malekith. During this fight, they enter many different realms. The fight ends with Thor getting teleported to a subway and Malekith back to Greenwich. Here he starts to release the Aether.

When Malekith tells Thor that the Aether can't be destroyed. Thor tells Malekith that he, however, can be and uses the teleportation devices from [[Erik Selvig]] to teleport Malekith back to Svartalfheim. When the ship of Malekith starts to collapse, Selvig uses the last of his devices to teleport it to Svartalfheim, where it crushes and kills Malekith.

After the battle, Thor brings the Aether to Asgard and tells Odin (who is actually Loki using a magical disguise) that he does not want to become king. He then returns to Earth, where he is reunited with Jane.

====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
After the destruction of Project Insight, the Avengers were officially reassembled with Iron Man's financing and Captain America's leadership. The Avengers arrived in Sokovia to take down the last known base of HYDRA and retrieve Loki's scepter. While they fight, Thor was glad to retrieve the scepter as J.A.R.V.I.S. informed them that this was the most protected HYDRA base. Soon after, Captain America informed him that a powered people and it was the fastest person he had seen, even though he could not see him. Thor asked Rogers to retrieve the scepter at any cost. With the battle won, the team traveled back to [[Avengers Tower]]. During the trip, Romanoff asked him what was Hulk's contribution, Thor replied that the moans of his victims are still listening, seeing that Banner felt bad about what he had done, he unsuccessfully tried to make to feel good with him. Also, Stark asked him to study the scepter for three days, which Thor agreed.

Thor attended the party that Stark organized in honor of the victory over HYDRA. During the party, he and Stark discussed who was the best girlfriend, if Jane or Pepper. Although Pepper ran successfully Stark Industries, for him Jane was better. When the party ended, he saw how his teammates unsuccessfully tried to lift Mjölnir. Thor explained that they were not worthy to wield Mjölnir. Suddenly, a damaged robot arrived and described the Avengers as killers and then proceeded to attack them by Iron Legion. [[Ultron]] explained that was only one path to peace: their extinction; Thor then threw his hammer destroying Ultron. The next day, Thor returned to Avengers Tower from pursuing a Legionary and informed the group that the robot is heading to the north towards an unknown location. After locating the next destination of Ultron, the Avengers went to Salvage Yard to destroy Ultron and defeat the Maximoff twins. Here, they faced with Ultron and the twins. During the battle, Scarlet Witch used her powers on Thor, causing that the God of Thunder had a hallucination. With the team sad by defeat, Hawkeye took them to a place where they could relax and then out to fight.

Determined to find answers, Thor decided not to stay on the farm and chose to go with Erik Selvig so that he could help him find the Water of Sights. He warned Selvig that it was a very dangerous mission, Selvig replied that he would be disappointed if it was not. After finding it, Thor plunged into them and was able to see his entire vision and discovered that the gem from Loki's scepter was an Infinity Stone. Thor returned to [[Avengers Tower]] and using his Mjölnir, created a powerful lightning and gave birth to a synthetic android. He explained to his companions that this gem was an Infinity Gem Stone and Stark was right because the android might be able to defeat Ultron. He witnessed as Vision was able to easily lift Mjölnir. He traveled to Sokovia before his teammates to find out how they could stop the Ultron's Doomsday Machine.

Soon after, Thor helped Captain America save many civilians from Ultron Sentries. Angered by Thor's actions, Ultron took him to the church to fight hand to hand with him. Thor told Ultron that there's life in his breast he would not surrender but all this was in order to distract Ultron, allowing Vision hit him with Mjölnir. After attacking Ultron, Vision told Thor that Mjölnir had an amazing balance, he replied that the key is that it's not too heavy and gave the swing more power. As the Avengers defeated easily the Sentries, Thor challenged Ultron to fight with all their might, Ultron then summoned his Sentries to fight with the Avengers. He fought fiercely against Sentries and when Vision attacked Ultron, he along with Iron Man helped by blasted it with his Mjölnir. As Sokovia was about hit Earth, Thor and Iron Man destroyed the city to avoid the global extinction.

After Ultron's defeat, Thor went to [[New Avengers Facility]] to say goodbye to Tony and Steve. He told them that Vision was worthy to wield the gem and had a feeling, with the recent appearance of Infinity Stones, they were all pawns of someone powerful. Rogers asked him if he could do it, Thor replied that everything in this universe made sense, except Stark. Heimdall then opened the Bifrost allowing Thor to return to [[Asgard]].

====''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''====
A year after the Battle of Sokovia, when Thaddeus Ross presented the Sokovia Accords to [[The Avengers]] he was mentioned with [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] by Ross of the importance of the Accords. He also mentioned them when he interrogated Steve on the whereabouts of the strongest members in Avengers in which the latter remains unresponsive.

In the film's post-credits scene, Thor is seen discussing with [[Doctor Strange]] inside the New York Sanctum. Thor explains to Strange that he came to him for aid in finding Odin. Expressing interest in the mystical affair, Strange agrees to help Thor track Odin down.

====''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''====
At the beginning of ''Thor: Ragnarok'', taking place two years after the Battle of Sokovia, Thor is imprisoned in a cage in the realm of Surtur and explaining his current situation with hunting down the infinity Stones with an alien skeleton that had been long forgotten. However, he is soon released from the cage in chains, where he meets [[Surtur]], the ruler of Muspelheim. While confronting Surtur, Thor tells Surtur that he has seen Asgard in flames and falling in ruins and that Surtur is at the center of everything. The evil ruler of Muspelheim tells Thor that he has foreseen the Norse apocalyptic prophecy of Ragnarok and reveals his intentions to connect his crown with the Eternal Flame and bring about Asgard's doom. However, Thor reveals he will succeed in stopping Surtur and reveals that winning is what heroes do. He later breaks from his chains and has a fight between Surtur and his fire giants. Thor takes down Surtur and steals his crown and escapes to Asgard.

Thor goes back to Asgard and finds out Loki is alive and impersonating Odin. Thor forces Loki to reveal his true self to the Asgardians and after Loki is unmasked, Thor demands where Odin is. Loki, despite his treacherous tendencies, reveals he sent Odin to a nursing home in New York.

After Thor and Loki arrive on Earth, they discover the home is demolished and their father nowhere to be found. Suddenly, Loki gets caught in a portal where he is trapped in a bottomless abyss, while Thor meets the conjurer: [[Doctor Strange]]. The two talk and Strange offers his help to Thor to find Odin in exchange that Thor immediately departs Loki from Earth. Strange takes a lock of Thor's hair and pinpoints Odin in Norway. Retrieving Loki from the portal, Doctor Strange opens another portal to Odin's location. The two brothers are transported in Norway and they finally reunite with Odin; Odin tell to his sons he is dying and, after apologizing for all the mistakes he did, he reveals that with his death, the goddess of death, [[Hela]], his malevolent firstborn, will be free from her prison in Hel. As Thor and Loki face the horizon before them, Odin disintegrates and passes on, leaving Thor and Loki devastated.

At that moment, Hela emerges from her prison and confronts her younger brothers before their eyes. Thor presents himself, but Hela sarcastically says to him who he doesn't look like their father before she orders to him and Loki to kneel before her as their queen. Thor refuses and tries to promptly subdue her with his hammer but is incredulous when Hela blocks and destroys Mjölnir to Thor's shock and Loki's fear. Hela then proceeds to attack them. Loki, in panic, calls Volstagg to bring them back to Asgard with the Bifrost. Thor tries to stop this, knowing they must activate the portal when far from Hela or she will get to Asgard, but it is too late - the Bifrost take them into the portal with Hela after them. Thor asks Loki for help but he is kicked out of the portal and into space leaving Thor alone to fight Hela. Hoping to prevent Hela from taking over Asgard, Thor briefly fights her off and almost succeeds but is sent out of the portal and into space, while the portal brings Hela to Asgard and start her conquest.

Thor falls on a waste planet called [[Sakaar]], where he is captured by a woman named [[Valkyrie|Scrapper 142]] who takes him to see the [[Grandmaster]], the tyrannical yet charismatic emperor of Sakaar. The Grandmaster attempts to make Thor as a fighter of his arena game, Thor refuses until he sees Loki on Sakaar as well, having arrived weeks prior to Thor due to the portal and became an ally of Grandmaster. However, Loki can't free Thor without losing the Grandmaster's trust, so the God of Thunder makes a deal with the Grandmaster: if he will defeat his champion, he can go back to Asgard.

Thor is then outfitted as a gladiator, including having his hair severely cut, before arriving in the arena. While Thor readies his weapons, the doors to his opponent open and reveal the Grandmaster's champion. To Thor's surprise, it is none other than his fellow Avenger and friend [[Hulk]].

Thor is happy to see the Hulk, but when he calls him Banner, Hulk retorts Banner doesn't exist and there is only Hulk, and proceeds to attack Thor. Thor is initially reluctant to fight him, but when Hulk smashes him (in a similar way he did Loki) even after he tries to calm him with Black Widow's pacification technique, Thor finally decides fight back. Thanks to his status as a god, Thor is able to spar with Hulk on par until Hulk blocks an attack and proceeds to pound him into the ground. However, Thor then has a vision of his father and he gains the ability to summon lightning, which electrocutes Hulk. As Thor prepares to defeat Hulk, the Grandmaster, in fear of losing Hulk's popularity, activates Thor's obedience disk to weaken Thor and enable the Hulk to win the fight. Thor survives but is left unconscious by the blow.

In his prison room with Hulk, Thor is initially unable to convince the Hulk to help him escape Sakaar due to Hulk's happiness over finally being accepted, not feared, by others and belief that Thor is really friends with Banner. Thor soon discovers that Scrapper 142 is actually Valkyrie and the last of Asgardian Valkyries, whom he also tries and fails to get help from. Deciding to escape Sakaar and save his people alone, Thor finally breaks out of his prison and flees into Hulk's nearby [[Quinjet]]. Hulk follows him, wanting him to stay, but Thor manages to play a recording of Black Widow trying to convince Hulk to return after the final battle with Ultron. The message and sight of her causes Hulk to have an emotional reaction, transforming him back into Banner. With Banner, Thor is able to get Valkyrie to join his cause and later gets Loki back on his side as well. Together, the four form a team named the Revengers and start a revolution on Sakaar with the other gladiators to stop Hela and save Asgard. During the revolution, Loki tries to betray them to the Grandmaster but Thor electrocutes Loki with an obedience disk he attached in case Loki attempted his old tricks. As he escapes with Banner and Valkyrie on Grandmaster's ship, Thor advises to an incapacitated Loki he must change and become a better person as life is about change and growth, and he could be something more, leaving Loki with the remote for deactivating the disk away from him. After escaping a fleet of Grandmaster's forces, the three arrive in Asgard where Thor reconvenes with Heimdall with a plan to save Asgard.

In Odin's throne room, Thor confronts Hela who is shocked who her brother is still alive. Thor agrees that Odin did have his faults and that while Hela had a right to the throne, he couldn't allow her to rule because she's "just the worst" before they proceed to duel. In their battle, Hela is able to cut out Thor's right eye, repulsed by how he now resembled their late father. Soon, Thor is immobilized from the pain and Hela threatens him that no one will escape. Then, a ship carrying Saakarian Rebels lead by the redeemed Loki and [[Korg]] arrive to help the Asgardians evacuate and fight off Hela's army. While immobilized, Thor has another vision of his father Odin. Thor tells Odin he cannot stop Hela because she's too strong and without Mjolnir he's lost his strength, but Odin tells him Asgard is not a place but in its people, and reveals that Thor is stronger than him, not needing his hammer. Odin's final speech motivates Thor to recover and awaken his true powers as the god of thunder to force Hela away. Together with Loki, Valkyrie, and the reemerged Hulk, Thor decimates Hela's henchmen. Because Hela's power is tied with Asgard, Thor realizes that Ragnarok must be caused to finally end her threat to the Asgardians.

Thor sends Loki to revive Surtur and with Valkyrie, he starts to fight Hela until Surtur is restored into gigantic size. Thor and the others leave Hela and Surtur to fight and escape from Asgard with the other Asgardians on the rebel ship. Surtur succeeds in destroying both Hela and Asgard, and Asgardians are safe. Thor, now sporting an eyepatch, reconciles with Loki. As his people's new king, Thor decides to bring them to Earth as their new home.

In a mid-credits scene, Thor and Loki debate on whether Loki will be accepted on Earth after [[Avengers|all the things he has committed]]. Thor assures him that everything is going to be fine for them and their people when a much larger ship confronts them - one belonging to the Mad Titan [[Thanos]].

====''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''====
The Asgardians' ship, the ''Statesman'', is attacked by [[Thanos]] and the [[Black Order]]. Despite the passengers' best efforts, Thanos is able to kill half of the Asgardians while the other half get to escape pods from the destruction. Thor is defeated along with Heimdall nearby, while Loki is at the mercy of [[Proxima Midnight]]. Thor is held by the head by Thanos as Thanos orders to Loki to give him the Tesseract or he will kill Thor. Loki is initially reluctant but he succumbs and gives the Tesseract to Thanos. Loki reveals his ruse to buy time for Hulk to blindside Thanos with a surprise attack, making the Mad Titan give up his grip on Thor and away from the Tesseract.

After Thanos defeats Hulk with his superior physical strength, Thor tries to attack Thanos only to be chained up by [[Ebony Maw]]. A weakened Heimdall uses the last of his strength to send Hulk to Earth with the Bifrost. In response, Thanos kills Heimdall, much to Thor's anger. Thor watches as Loki attempts to appeal to Thanos to kill the Mad Titan, but Thanos sees his ploy and uses the Space Stone to stop the trickster in his tracks, where he then strangles and kills Loki. As Loki is dead and thrown to the ground before him, Thor screams in rage and cries clinging to his brother's corpse while Thanos destroys the ship by setting it ablaze.

Thor survives the destruction and is left drifting among its debris unconscious. After some allotted time, he is found by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] who had picked up the ship's distress signal. After they take him inside their ship, Thor wakes up and presents himself to his saviors and tells them what Thanos did to him, his friends, and his people. Thor discovers from [[Gamora]], one of the members, that Thanos is searching for all the Infinity Stones for his Infinity Gauntlet, and if he has them all in the Gauntlet, he will destroy half of the life in the universe with a snap of his fingers. Thor instantly consoles Gamora when he finds out Thanos is her father, and soon finds friendship with [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]] who he comically believes as a rabbit. The group splits up, with Thor going with Rocket and a teenage [[Groot]] to Nidavellier to make a new weapon for Thor while the other Guardians are tasked to go to Knowhere to stop Thanos from getting the Reality Stone.

Rocket converses with Thor about his grief over having [[Hela|lost]] [[Loki Laufeyson|his]] [[Frigga|whole]] [[Odin Borson|family]]. After Thor assures the only thing that is keeping him going is stopping Thanos, Rocket gives Thor a cybernetic eye to replace his lost eye. The group arrive on Nidavellier and find Eitri, a dwarf and old friend of Thor, who reveals that Thanos forced the dwarfs to build his Infinity Gauntlet and then killed the other dwarfs but spared him. Eitri agrees to help him build a new weapon called "Stormbreaker". Using his own strength to activate the machine, Thor helps create the new weapon while Groot uses his vines to form the weapon's handle. With Stormbreaker, Thor transports himself, Rocket, and Groot to Earth in [[Wakanda]], where some of the Avengers are fighting Thanos' army.

Thor, alongside Rocket and Groot, helps his comrades with Stormbreaker and his own electrokinesis to eliminate half of the henchmen. In the midst of fighting, Thor reunites with Steve Rogers whom he has a brief conversation with over Thor's haircut and Steve's new beard, and introduces to Groot. With the main members of the Black Order slain, Thanos' forces are defeated. However, at that moment Thanos arrives on Wakanda, having acquired five of the Infinity Stones and searching for the last one: the Mind Stone found on Vision. Scarlet Witch is forced to kill Vision but the effort is for naught as Thanos simply revives Vision with the newly-acquired Time Stone and rips out the Mind Stone, killing Vision twice, and completes the Gauntlet. Thor arrives too late and sees what Thanos has done. Attempting to avenge Vision, Loki, Heimdall, and the half of his people who were massacred, he strikes Thanos with Stormbreaker using all his might and taunts Thanos with his revenge. Though wounded, Thanos retorts that Thor should have struck him in the head as he snaps his fingers, resulting in Thor screaming in horror. After experiencing a flash of light, Thor angrily interrogates Thanos on what he has done but is ignored by Thanos and the warlord teleports away after mockingly smirking at Thor. Thor looks around and sees some of his friends vanishing into dust. Realizing that Thanos has succeeded in eliminating half of all life, Thor and the other survivors can only stand watch despairingly as the rest of their friends disappear.

====''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''====
Thor is first seen in shame, knowing his indecisiveness cost the heroes' victory. He joins the Avengers into traveling to Titan II, so that they could kill Thanos and bring back all who had been decimated. The Avengers arrived to Titan II and attacked Thanos. Thor chopped off Thanos' gauntlet hand, but Thanos had already destroyed the Infinity Stones. In anger, Thor chopped off Thanos' head, knowing there was nothing they could do to undo the titan's actions.

Five years later, Thor has become a recluse, living with Korg and Miek and spending his days eating junk food, drinking beer, and playing ''Fortnite''. After being convinced by Hulk/Banner and Rocket, Thor joins the rest of the surviving heroes as they travel back in time to retrieve the Infinity Stones. Thor and Rocket travel to 2013 to retrieve the Reality Stone, where Thor has a heart-to-heart with his mother about growing from failure before obtaining a past version of Mjolnir. After the Avengers return with the stones and Banner uses the Infinity Gauntlet to undo the snap and bring everyone back to life, Thor joins the rest of the heroes in their fight against Thanos and his army of Chitauri, Outriders and the Black Order. After Thanos and his army are killed at the cost of Iron Man's life, Thor crowns Valkyrie as the new king of Asgard, and then he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.

====''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''====
In the [[Glorious Purpose|first episode]], a version of Thor appears in a flashback from ''Avengers: Endgame'', when the [[Avengers]] time-traveled to aftermath of the Battle of New York to get the [[Infinity Stones]], and Loki manages to grab the [[Tesseract]] and use it to teleport himself, making the Thor from this timeline call for his brother after he escaped. 

After Loki was captured by the [[Time Variance Authority]] for disrupting the [[Sacred Timeline]], [[Mobius|Agent Mobius]] interrogates Loki in a Time Theater and shows him a recording of events from Loki's life on the timeline, including the Battle of New York, where Thor appears alongside the other Avengers. He also shows the time that Loki hijacked a plane as D.B. Cooper, and Loki tells him that he only did it because he was young and had lost a bet to Thor. Afterwards, Loki returns to the Time Theater and becomes emotional as he watches the future events of his timeline, including how he and Thor would witness their father's death together, would fight side by side during the Ragnarok and how his brother would finally accept him. He also sees his own sacrifice to save Thor from [[Thanos]] and how his brother clutched his body and cried while mourning his death.

In the [[The Variant|second episode]], when Loki is confronting the female [[Variants|Variant]] of himself, [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]], he calls her "Loki" but she rejects the name, making Loki become frustrated with her games and then states that now he understands why Thor finds them so annoying.

[[File:Throg - Loki EP5.png|thumb|250px|left|A Variant of Thor, Throg, is seen inside a jar in the Void.]]

In the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], Loki finds other versions of himself that were sent to [[the Void]] by the TVA and [[Kid Loki]] tells Loki that he was captured and ended up there for killing Thor. As the Lokis are walking to their hideout, a Variant of Thor which was turned into a frog, Throg, is seen trapped in a jar, jumping and screaming inside it while attempting to escape. 

[[Classic Loki]], who is an elder Loki, tells Loki that he survived his final encounter with Thanos by faking his own death with an illusion of himself, before drifting in space, away from Thor and the others. Classic Loki then decided to isolate himself at a remote planet for many years, but he eventually felt lonely and missed Thor, wondering if his brother also missed him. But when he left the planet to look for Thor, he was captured by the TVA. Later, Sylvie reveals to Loki that she fears that he might betray her in the end, but Loki replies that even if he had betrayed everyone who ever loved him, including Thor, he is now a changed person and won't do the same to her.

====''[[What If...?]]''====
In the [[What If... The World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?|third episode]], in an alternate timeline set during the events of ''Thor'' film, Thor goes to retrieve [[Mjolnir]] in the base of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in New Mexico. As Thor knocks out the guards inside the base, [[Phil Coulson]] spots him and tells to [[Nick Fury]] through the radio that the guy attacking them is "mid-20s, tall and with really great hair". Thor arrives at the crater that was set around his hammer while [[Hawkeye]] gets in a survey crane after Fury asked for an overhead visual. Thor is happy as he approaches his hammer and Fury orders Clint to hold his fire. However, when Thor is about to grab the hammer, he is pierced in the chest by Hawkeye's arrow and killed, because [[Hank Pym]] had shrunk himself and dislodged Clint's fingers from his bowstring. Hawkeye becomes surprised and claims that he didn't fire, but is imprisoned while S.H.I.E.L.D. takes Thor's body to the morgue. Examining Thor's blood tests, they find out that he is near a thousand of years old, and both Fury and Coulson notice that even dead, Thor still smells like lavender.

Later, after knowing about Thor's death, [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] assembles an [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] army and travels to Earth to avenge his brother. Loki meets Fury in New Mexico, and says he will destroy Midgard for what happened with his brother, but Fury manages to make a deal with him by promising to deliver Thor's murderer to Loki once they know who is killing the candidates to the [[Avengers]] Initiative. Eventually, after finding out the truth, Fury and Loki set up a trap to capture Pym. When Loki (disguised as Nick Fury) confronts Pym, he asks why he would kill Thor who was not directly involved with Fury's Avengers project. Pym replies that Fury would have recruited Thor to fight for S.H.I.E.L.D. anyway, and Loki then angrily concludes that Pym only killed him because he could.

{{Quote|Citizens of Midgard... Your dull lives are about to come to an end. Prepare yourselves... for the Party Prince!|Thor to the people of Las Vegas}}
In the [[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?|seventh episode]], set in another timeline during the events of the ''Thor'' film, Thor travels to Earth and throws a party that goes out of control. In this universe, Thor was raised as an only child because Odin did not adopt Loki. Instead, Odin had returned baby Loki to the [[Frost Giants]] after finding him abandoned. [[The Watcher]] explains that Thor's relationship with Loki is what made the God of Thunder learn many lessons during his childhood and shaped him into becoming a hero, changing the fate of the universe. As a consequence of not having his trickster brother around to keep things "lively", Thor became a very different person.

After his father enters his state of deep sleep, Thor is with [[Frigga|his mother]] who says she is going to her sister's home to celebrate solstice and asks him to study about the Nine Realms he will rule in the future. Frigga tells him behave and not throw any parties. Before leaving she warns Thor that [[Heimdall]] will be watching him. Despite his mother's request, Thor gathers the Warriors Three and plans to start a party anyway. He says he will travel to a planet so backward that even Heimdall will not pay attention to, Midgard. With this, he first arrives to Las Vegas and is followed by several aliens who were invited to his party.

During the party in Las Vegas, Thor meets [[Jane Foster]] who had tracked his arrival to Earth and was searching for alien invaders. Jane is surprised that Thor looks very different from what she expected of an alien. She asks him about the planet Alpha Star, which was destroyed eighteen months prior, and says that the astronomy that preceded the event happened again tonight on Earth. Thor confirms that he started a party on Alpha Star and Jane says that it destroyed the planet. Ignoring this, Thor becomes curious about the technology Jane is carrying. Thor says she must be a genius and praises her beautiful eyes, which makes Jane blush. As they start to develop romantic feelings for each, Thor and Jane spend the rest of the night together. Nick Fury, arrives and demands Thor to stop the party but is knocked out by [[Korg]].

The next day, Thor travels to Paris, where Loki and other Frost Giants go to his encounter. Because he was not raised as Thor's rival to the Asgard's throne, Loki did not become a villain and has no reason to antagonize Thor. The two greet each other like close friends and Thor is very happy that Loki came to his party. Loki says that Thor is "his brother from another mother" and they promise to be brothers forever. They are surprised to see a shooting start and Thor tells Loki to make a wish. However, it is revealed to be [[Captain Marvel]], who was called by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to stop the party because its destructive atmosphere had spread to various places on Earth. Refusing to end his party, Thor tells Captain Marvel to go away and calls her a "party pooper". The two start a long fight, with one punching the other from country to country. At one point, Thor tries to electrocute her with his thunder, but she simply absorbs it. However, she is eventually unable to move when Mjolnir falls over her chest. 

Later, Thor uses a phone to call Jane and asks to see her again. When she questions about Alpha Star again, he tells her that no one was hurt when it was destroyed and that it was not a planet, but actually a meteor that was falling apart anyway. They are affectionate with each other, and Jane even accidentally says that she loves him, which makes Thor smile. Jane later calls him again while Thor is eating Chinese food and Loki picks up his phone. She asks to talk to Thor, but the device is broken when Loki accidentally drops it. Afterwards, Thor is having fun with his guests when Captain Marvel appears to confront him again. While they are fighting, however, Frigga uses her magic to contact Thor by projecting herself as a hologram. She says that Jane told her about Thor being on Midgard, but he claims to be in studying in his room. Seeing that his mother is not fooled by this lie, Thor says he and his study group came to Earth for a "cultural exchange". Frigga doubts it, so she decides to travel to Earth to check it for herself what her son is doing. Seeing how Thor is fearful about his mother's arrival, Captain Marvel wishes him good luck and leaves.

Terrified, Thor searches for the others. He finds Loki constructing the biggest sling shot with the St. Louis Arch and asks him to stop the destruction and help him to clean up everything. However, Loki reminds Thor that they are brothers from different parents, so Frigga is not his mother. As Loki refuses to help and leaves with the other Frost Giants, Thor turns to the rest of his guests and announces that his mother is coming. He manages to convince them by saying she is very angry, so they help him to clean and rebuilt everything that was destroyed during the party. When Frigga finally arrives, Thor had set up a study with his guests to pretend that they had been studying the entire time. Captain Marvel appears and helps Thor by giving him an iPad with information about human civilization, claiming that he had requested it. Thor's lie is discovered, however, when his summons Mjolnir and it is still colorful painted and covered with beads from the party. 

Thor later visits Jane and gives her a bouquet of flowers. He tells her that calling Frigga was not a cool thing to do, but it was the right action, so he thanks her. He confesses that he likes her and thinks she is very attractive, then asks her for a date. Everything seems to be fine, when Thor witnesses a group of robots arriving through a portal, among them is [[Ultron]] in [[Vision]]'s body with all six [[Infinity Stones]].

In the [[What If... The Watcher Broke His Oath?|ninth episode]], Thor battles the Sentries in Vegas, sent by Ultron. As he continues fighting, the Watcher appears, trying to recruit him, but he was too distracted by Ultron's Sentries before he was grabbed by the Watcher. He was brought to a dimension beyond space and time, along with [[Captain Carter]], Star-Lord T'Challa, Gamora, and Killmonger, constructed by Doctor Strange, in a form of a pub.

====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====
The Wrecking Crew, trying to steal a piece of Stark Industries technology, are confronted by a squadron of police, whom they easily defeat using their powers. When Jane Foster arrives to treat the wounded, she is surrounded by the Crew, who start to advance on her when one of them is knocked back by [[Mjolnir]], which was thrown by Thor.

Instructing the 'mortals' to stand back, he subsequently defeats most of the Crew. When their leader takes Jane as a hostage, Thor uses Mjölnir to attack him from behind, freeing Jane. As they are getting acquainted, with Thor asking her why she risks her life if she is mortal, they are interrupted by Heimdall, who says Thor is desperately needed in Asgard. Saying goodbye to a dumbstruck Jane, Thor flies onto the portal, leaving her alone on the pier.

When Thor arrives in Asgard, he is informed by Heimdall that the [[Frost Giants]] are marching towards Odin's throne. Since the Odinsleep is almost upon him, the King is weakened, and must rely on his warriors to stop them. Expressing frustration at not being able to help Thor due to his duty to defend the Bifrost Bridge, Thor tells him that he will fell a Frost Giant in his name. Thor then goes to confront the Giants.

He arrives at the scene of the fight just as one of the Giants is about to kill Sif. He breaks the creature's ax just as it is about to crush the female Asgardian, then confronts another Giant who is armed with a sword. As they battle, causing massive property damage to Asgard in the process, Odin sees through his ravens that Thor has arrived, and breathes a sigh of relief. Thor continues to battle the Giants, and is about to finish them off when he is suddenly frozen by an unseen foe. He easily breaks free, but is pummeled by the remaining Giants. Just as one is about to bite his head off, Thor comes to and calls Mjölnir to him, just barely escaping the Giant's teeth. He then proceeds to kill the Giants with a massive bolt of lightning.

As he surveys his victory, Thor is suddenly attacked from behind by Loki. Thor, seeing who attacked him, pleads with Loki to return to the person Thor once knew, but the god simply laughs at him, telling him he had his chance to pick sides, and lunges with his spear. Using Mjölnir, Thor fights his brother and gains the advantage. He is about to finish Loki off with a huge blast of energy when Loki simply vanishes. Proclaiming that Loki cannot beat him, Thor is again attacked from behind by Loki, who tries his best to stop Thor. Having had enough, Thor simply deflects his brother's attacks, and captures Loki, bringing him before Odin.

Odin is heartbroken and infuriated by Loki's continued attempts to overthrow him, his own father, but Loki yells that Odin is not his father. He rants on about Odin being a liar and king of fools, but he pushes Odin too far, who banishes him to the Isle of Silence. When the deed is done, Thor approaches Odin, who tells him it is almost time for the Odinsleep, and that Thor has much to prepare. Thor, however, says that Balder and Sif will be there to defend him, while he goes back to attend Midgard. Outraged, Odin tells Thor that Asgard is his responsibility, not Midgard, but Thor rebuffs this, stating that he will not be apart of Odin's game any longer.

He accuses his father of keeping everyone under his heel, and that he could have stopped Lokis attack before it even happened. Just as Odin is about to lash out at him, Thor says that he will always be there to defend Asgard, if it needs it, but that he will see to Midgard until then. He storms out, with Odin allowing his son to leave. Thor expresses some regret to himself over his actions, but remains firm in his belief that Earth is where he is needed the most. With that, he flies off back to Midgard, failing to notice that someone was watching him as he left.

Thor is observing the city when he is approached by Balder. Thor asks him why he is there, but he sees the sadness in Balder's eyes and asks who sent him instead. Balder says that Odin wants Thor to return home to Asgard, to defend it while Odin sleeps. Thor, however, refuses, which makes Balder question why Thor stays on Midgard. Thor says that he is needed there more than Asgard, since they fighting in Asgard is meaningless, and everything that happens on Earth is not. They are interrupted by sirens, and Thor sees Jane Foster tending someone who is hurt. However, a car bounces off of another car, which had previously been in an accident, and is about to crush her when Thor swoops down and saves her. Expressing gratitude, Jane asks Thor if he had been following her, to which he responds yes, because she intrigues him.

The two of them go to a cafe, where they discuss their individual lives, where Thor tells her about Odin and the Odinsleep. Hearing that his world is in danger while Odin sleeps, Jane tells Thor he should go back. Just as it seems Thor might reconsider and go back home, there is an explosion. Thor takes off to investigate the disturbance.

Thor is the first of Earth's heroes to confront the mad and very powerful Graviton, and is the first to witness his gravity-bending powers, which affect even the mighty Asgardian warrior. However, not one to back down, Thor continues to fight, until he is sent beneath the ocean by Graviton's power. He remains buried beneath the sand until the other heroes of Earth arrive, and distract Graviton enough for Thor to free himself. Rejoining the battle, Thor teams up with Iron Man, Ant-Man and Wasp in an attempt to stop Graviton. When Graviton lifts a huge portion of New York, which he is going to use to destroy the rest of the city, Thor uses Mjölnir to stop him, then flies down to catch the huge portion of earth and prevent it from causing a huge tidal wave which would have killed thousands.

When they are all subdued by the insanely powerful villain, the Hulk arrives to aid them, and the battle shifts in their favor. In the end, after Hulk beats up Graviton, Wasp continues to sting him, Giant Man throws a huge ship on him, and Iron Man weakens him with a Uni-Beam, Thor unleashes his full power against the villain, and strikes him with a huge blast of lightning and magic, finally bringing the foe down (however, Wasp is the one to render him unconscious with a final sting when Thor's attack is done). After their victory, Thor group-hugs the informal team, but then S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives to re-capture the Hulk, who had been freed from the Cube along with most of Earth's villains.

As Hulk is about to attack, the others stand up for him, Thor included, and Iron Man says that the Hulk is as much of a hero as the rest of them were. Then, Iron Man asks the other four to join him as a team to bring down the remaining villains. When they all agree, and Wasp comes up with a name for the group, the Avengers are officially formed.

Thor and Iron Man searched for Hulk with Wasp and Ant-Man in the Quinjet. Thor told Iron Man he should rely on his instincts than on technology, but, just as he said that Iron Man found a frozen [[Captain America]], who was still alive. When Captain America was thawed out, he immediately started to attack the Avengers. He realized the world needed him again and he joined the Avengers.

Thor and Wasp chased down A.I.M agents and ran into MODOC, who eventually escaped. Thor told Wasp that Scientists are not meant to to be trusted. The two of them joined Iron Man, Captain America, and Ant-Man in battle against Wonder Man.

Thor then assisted his team during their hunt for former S.H.I.E.L.D. member [[Hawkeye]]. He and his team stealth fully chased Hawkeye through the city until Clay Quartermain, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., notified the Avengers that S.H.I.E.L.D. needed their help with the Leader. Thor entered the dome the Leader inhabited with the rest of his teammates, being the only one who didn't need a suit to keep the Gamma radiation from infecting them. When Wasp was turned into a wasp-like creature, Thor tried to snap her out of her trace, while protecting Doc Samson. These efforts were in vain to Wasp but Thor eventually returned her to normal, with help from the other Avengers.

Thor ended up being the only Avenger unaffected by the Gamma-radiation the Leader had released after his first failure. When questioned by the Leader on why he was not infected, Thor explained that it was because he was Asgardian and was unaffected by the same things mortals are. Realizing that he is useless in his plans, Leader has Abomination and Absorbing Man attacks him, the latter absorbing Mjölnir's material. However, Thor was able to control Absorbing Man and sent him flying into the Leader. He later helped Hawkeye and Hulk defeat Leader.

Thor and the rest of the Avengers faced the Masters of Evil, comprised of several supervillains they had previously faced. He was captured and talked to by [[Enchantress]], who told him that she wanted him after he asked what she wanted from the Avengers. After being freed, Thor aided in the battle against the villains until the Masters of Evil fled.

Thor helped Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Captain Marvel defeat a Kree Sentry Drone that was about to use the Nega-Bomb inside it to wipe out Earth. Ant-Man was knocked out but was still alive. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain Marvel took the bomb into space after the robot was destroyed. Thor threw the bomb far away from Earth. It exploded and the blast knocked Thor out. Hulk caught him and he recovered.

Thor helped Ant-Man and Wasp escort Blizzard to Prison 42. Later, he fought Kang the Conqueror and protected Captain America, who Kang blamed for the destruction of his timeline. He showed them the future. Thor blasted him with lightning and let him flee. Kang launched his machines and sent them to attack New York. Thor and the other Avengers defeated them and went into space to stop Kang. Thor stopped Kang from firing a weapon that could destroy the city, but got hurt. After Kang was defeated, Wasp visited him in the hospital.

Thor fought Radioactive Man with Iron Man and Black Panther at Stark Tower. He managed to throw him into the Arc Reactor, but Radioactive Man absorbed the energy. Iron Man tried to send it into the ground, but Thor unleashed lightning and send lots of water to pour onto the reactor, defeating Radioactive Man. He later felt magic and found out that The Casket of Ancient Winters was opened by Malakith, who was trying to bring the Dark Elves to Midgard. Thor, Black Panther, and Iron Man defeated him and closed the casket, which was then stolen by the Enchantress. Thor tried to follow her into Asgard, but found out that he was locked out.

Thor was teleported to Asgard where he was imprisoned and Mjölnir was put in a protection spell by Loki, who conquered Asgard. Loki reminisced to Thor about his admonishment of his father. Thor was not convinced of the accusations of Odin that Loki tried to convince him about. Loki explained to him that he only had to conquer Midgard, which made Thor furious. Loki explained how he fooled Thor of leaving Asgard and how he kept him in Midgard. Loki escorted Thor outside the throne room, where he warned Loki that he will avenge Asgard. Loki doubted it and showed his execution place.

Thor watched how Loki was furious that Avengers arrived in Asgard and calling out Hoarfen. Thor made a remark about that he still did not win even with the Odinforce. The Hoarfen was pushed into the throne room, where the Avengers, Faradei, Sif, and Warriors Three arrived. They fought each other and Thor watched when they were easily defeated by the might of Loki. They were about to be finished off until [[Iron Man]] appeared with his Uru Armor and distracted Loki. Thor was eventually freed by Hawkeye and ordered him, Ant-Man and Black Panther to go after the source of Loki's power the Yggdrasil, while he goes after Loki.

Thor touched through the magic spell of Loki to achieve his hammer back. He eventually reached Mjölnir and went after Loki. Thor fought against Loki, until he went berserk by the cause of Odinforce. He warned Loki that he could accidentally destroy all the Nine Realms, which he ignored and went through the process. When Giant Man pulled out the Tree of Life, Thor watched how Loki lost his power over the Odinforce. Thor stood alongside, Hulk, Captain America and Wasp and entrapped Loki between them and Black Panther, Ant-Man and Hawkeye. He saw that his father has awakened and how he punished Loki, sending him to the Midgard Serpent.

Thor stood alongside the other Avengers, where he was gratified by Odin that they were freed from Loki. Thor denied it since he himself was freed by Avengers. Thor showed gratitude towards his friends, which made Odin also gave his gratitude to them and all the Asgardians praised and cheered the heroes. Thor stayed at Asgard to rebuild it and secure Asgard from evil.

Thor worried about his father being too weak to fight against [[Surtur]]. Balder asked for his explanation, that Thor missed his mortal girlfriend Jane Foster. Sif interrupted them, telling that Thor should return. Before Thor could explain Odin arrived. He reported them that Surtur is not in Muspelheim and wondering why he did not attack Asgard yet. The Warriors Three arrived, reporting that something trouble Heimdall, Thor suggested that he will take care of it. Heimdall saw the Skuttlebutt and sensed Surtur's aura around. Thor decided to check it out and convinced Heimdall to go after the ship.

He arrived near the ship and is attacked by it, he deflected the attacks and broke in the ship. He noticed how there are beings encased in ice and soon after is ambushed by Beta Ray Bill. He took care of the Bill, by throwing Mjölnir at him. He was shocked to see Bill lifting Mjölnir. Bill with the Mjölnir prevailed against Thor and before he could deliver the final blow, he was teleported to Asgard, who was summoning the one worthy to lift Mjölnir. Thor was still in the ship, which detected that the Fire Demons were coming, he was soon after teleported to Asgard, where he warned his father about Bill. The former explained his backstory and Thor offered his help by letting him give his Mjölnir, Odin reminded him that there is another way. They went to Eitri who tried to let Eitri make another hammer for Bill, Thor convinced the dwarf king to make one.

Thor along with Bill and Sif went to the Skuttlebutt which was under attack by the Fire Demons. [[Enchantress]] possessed by Surtur showed up, which surprised Thor. Together with Bill they fend off the Fire Demons and Thor tried to wake the Enchantress up from Surtur's possession. Thor and Bill then unleashed their powerful attacks on her and freed her temporarily from Surtur's possession, and left the scene. Bill wondered if she would be gone for good, which Thor doubted. They went back to the Skuttlebutt and he bade farewell to Bill.

While Thor was away from the team, the Avengers had several members leave. Thor returned to the Avengers while they were in the middle of stopping a Skrull invasion. He returned after Queen Veranke told the Avengers that she and the rest of the Skrulls came to the world. Thor doubted they would win and fought alongside with several of the Avengers against the Skrulls. After returning and finding out Captain America had been replaced by a Skrull, he commented that Captain America would have to repair his relationship with the distrustful citizens.

Thor helped Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Iron Man find Spider-Man and Captain America after the Serpent Society attacked them.

He later helped Black Panther and Captain America defend Wakanda from Vision, who tried to steal Cap's Shield while it was being repaired. Thor, with the help of Hawkeye, Black Panther, and Captain America, repaired the Shield and defeated Vision. After the fight, Black Panther returned to the Avengers.

When the Wrecking Crew attacked New York, Thor helped Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Captain America fight them when he got struck by magic. He became a mortal could not fight. Iron Man and Captain America lost their powers too. Loki attacked them while piloting The Destroyer. Thor found inner strength and the Avengers regained their powers. They defeated Loki and placed The Destroyer in a container.

Thor, along with Wasp, Ms. Marvel, and Captain America, defended Prison 42 when Annihilus attacked it and tried to go through the portal. Thor told Skurge the Executioner that Amora was in the hands of Surtur during the fight, and promised to free her someday. When he was attacked by bugs, Skurge rescued him. After The Leader disrupted Annihilus' shields, Thor defeated him and saved Prison 42.

When the robot Avengers and Captain America attacked Thor and captured him, Vision saved the others and Wasp revived Thor, who then fought the robots. Thor tried to destroy Ultron but couldn't because he was invincible. Vision made Ultron's be able to be removed from his body. Thor knocked Ultron's head off and caused the robot to explode. He and the other Avengers escaped the building, which was now on fire, along with Vision who joined the team and has been a member since then.

==Trivia==
*Thor's Asgardian armor in Season 1 of ''Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' is quite similar to the one in the Marvel comics.
*Thor's Season 2 look in ''Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' and ''Thor'' is his current look in the comics which is also known as "Thor Reborn".
*Thor's transformation into a frog references when he himself was turned into a frog in the comics. In fact, his frog form also resembles Throg the Frog of Thunder, an amphibian ally of Thor who also has his powers.
*In ''The Avengers'', when Thor first appears on Earth, his 'costume' is a variant of his ''Thor'' costume and resembles the classic Thor design by Jack Kirby, with no sleeves and his trademark cape. Later in the film, when on the Helicarrier, his costume nods towards the Ultimate version of the character based on art by Brian Hitch, which had no cape, no sleeves and stripped-down armor. In the third act of the film, Thor summons lightning which magically completes his armor, adding his armor, discs and chainmail sleeves as he looked in ''Thor'', based on the [[2007]] redesign by Oliver Coipel. Whereas his ''Thor'' costume was black with silver discs, his suit in ''The Avengers'' is more blue-ish with much of the armor on his torso becoming silver.
*It is stated in ''The Avengers'' that Thor was able to get back to Earth thanks to the powers of Odin; however, Loki commented that Odin would have had to "summon up" a lot of "dark energy." This suggests that this action may be tiring, and possibly even dangerous or frowned upon by Odin, and was likely why the Bifrost meant so much to the Asgardians.
*[[The Evil Queen|Regina]] gave [[Henry Mills|Henry]] a ''Thor'' comic book in an [[Rocky Road|episode]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.
*Originally [[Chris Hemsworth|Chris]]' brother, [[Liam Hemsworth]], was on the shortlist to play Thor. After [[Kenneth Branagh]] decided to change the shortlist, he decided to consider Chris. Liam gave Chris tips on how to get the role.
**Ironically Luke Hemsworth, Chris' brother was cast as Actor Thor in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.
*[[Tom Hiddleston]] originally auditioned for the role of Thor, but was cast as [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] instead.
*Thor can speak Groot's language as he took Groot as an elective in Asgard.
*In the original comics, Thor took on the secret identity of Donald Blake, an American physician with a partially disabled leg. He transformed into Thor by can transform by tapping his walking stick on the ground; the cane becomes the magical hammer [[Mjolnir]].
*The event in which Loki turned Thor into a frog, mentioned during the play in the beginning of ''Thor: Ragnarok'', was going to be part of a sequence which was deleted from the [[Glorious Purpose|first episode]] of the ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' series. This sequence would be shown in the Time Theater as an event of Loki's past, in which Loki would take over the crown in Asgard while Thor is seen as a frog.<ref>{{Cite web|title='King Loki' Deleted Scene Would've Included Thor Transformed (Exclusive)|url=https://thedirect.com/article/loki-thor-king-throg-explained-exclusive |website=The Direct|date= [[July 16]], [[2021]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Loki Director Explains King Loki Deleted Scenes, Frog Thor Stories (Phase Zero Exclusive)|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/loki-kate-herron-phase-zero-exclusive-interview-king-loki-deleted-scenes-frog-thor/|website=ComicBook|date= [[July 23]], [[2021]]}}</ref> 
**This was also going to be Throg's first appearance in the series, but since it was cut, he only appears as a cameo in the [[Journey into Mystery|fifth episode]], voiced by Chris Hemsworth.
*During an interview with the Polish magazine, Elle Man, Chris Hemsworth confirmed that he will continue to play Thor after ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''. He joked claiming that Thor is only 1500 years old and is way too young for retirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/chris-hemsworth-confirms-thor-4-staying-mcu/|title=Chris Hemsworth Confirms He's Remaining in the MCU Beyond Thor: Love and Thunder|website=Comicbook|date=[[September 11]], [[2020]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/chris-hemsworth-thor-love-and-thunder-1234768042/|title=Chris Hemsworth Is ‘Definitely Not’ Saying Goodbye to Marvel After ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’|website=Variety|date=[[September 12]], [[2020]]}}</ref>
