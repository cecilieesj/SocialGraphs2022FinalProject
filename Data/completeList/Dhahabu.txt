==Background==

===Personality===
Dhahabu is described as the "charismatic leader of a group of zebras." Unlike most zebras, she is not always fearful, and be brave in order to help and fix her problems.

===Physical appearance===
Dhahabu has a slim build, with a lush gold-and-white mane and thin legs. Her fur and legs are striped with gold and white, and her eyeshades and muzzle are creamy in color. She has bright blue eyes that are framed by long black lashes.

==Role in the Series==
===''[[The Golden Zebra]]''===
Dhahabu made her appearance in the Season 2 episode ''The Golden Zebra''. When [[Simba]] says that he is not the first king who faced a water shortage, [[Rafiki]] then explains to him that the water hole is shown as a wall painting in which he was not familiar in seeing the shortage on the wall; Makini then explains to Simba that the water hole was in the Back Lands and is part of the grazing area where Dhahabu's herd grazes on. Simba then tasks [[Kion]] to talk to the zebra leader Dhahabu to ask her to share the water hole with the [[Pride Animals]]. After getting past [[Makucha]] in the Back Lands, Kion asks two zebras to find another zebra named Dhahabu to talk to in which the two agree to escort the [[Lion Guard]] to talk to her. She then first appears during the song "[[Fabulous Dhahabu]]" where she sings that she is different than the other zebras because she has golden and white stripes unlike others having black and white stripes and instead of panicking and running, Dhahabu's herd frolic and romp, unlike the lead zebra [[Thurston]] who panics and runs. The Lion Guard then reacts to her uniqueness because she is an extremely rare zebra found.

The Lion Guard came to her and introduce themselves to Dhahabu as she introduces the Guard to the grazing spot where her herd spends time at, much to Kion thinking of his plan given by Simba by asking her to share the watering hole. Kion then explains to her that there is a drought in the [[Pride Lands]] and asks her that the water hole needs more water in which Dhahabu asks the guard to bring a Tamboa plant to her herd. The Lion Guard then plans to find the plant that Dhahabu requested in order to share her water in return. The Lion Guard retrieves the plant for Dhahabu as requested by her to share the water hole, but Dhahabu refuses because one of her rules about the water hole is a secret. Kion then asks [[Ono]] to look at the water hole that Dhahabu's herd grazes at in which Ono explains that the reason why Dhahabu refuses to see is that the water hole is dried up. Feeling sad of herself after the zebras are unhappy that the water hole dried up, Kion then explains that the reason she didn't tell her herd about the dried up water hole is that she doesn't want to make her herd unhappy about this. Dhahabu and the Lion Guard plan to go to the dried up water hole Ono discovered in which Ono explains that a rockslide blocked the waterfall and caused the water hole to dry up. The Lion Guard then plans to get rid of the rockslide to bring the water back to the water hole, despite Dhahabu's warnings that this side could be a leopard territory.

When Dhahabu plans to be a good leader just like Kion said, she and the Lion Guard work together to get rid of the rockslide, but are suddenly ambushed by Makucha. Dhahabu stands up against the leopard refusing to share the water with her herd as Kion escorts Dhahabu to hide from him and [[Beshte]] to move the boulders, as Makucha and his [[Makucha's Leap|pack of leopards]] attack the Guard. The Lion Guard was able to defeat some of the leopards attacking them as they retreat, as Kion then explains to Makucha about a good leader doing something when he sees a problem; Dhahabu then explains to Makucha about what a good leader does in which she kicks Makucha into the rockslide, bringing water back to the water hole as the leopard retreats. Dhahabu then reforms as she allows the animals to share the water hole with her. Back in the Pride Lands, Dhahabu explains to the Pride Landers that she brought the water from her water hole to share as she tells the animals and the Lion Guard to frolic and romp just like what her herd does.

===''[[The Queen's Visit]]''===
Dhahabu returns in this episode where she visits the Pride Lands to discuss a water treaty. There, [[Kiara]], [[Tiifu]], and [[Zuri]] escort her on a tour around the Pride Lands while the Lion Guard follows them. During the tour, a lightning bolt strikes the plains, causing a fire and putting the zebra in danger as [[Fuli]] had to shout at her telling her to jump as the only way to escape the fire in which the two manage to escape as the rest of the Guard put out the fire.

After rescuing, Dhahabu praises Fuli for her bravery for rescuing her from the fire and Tiifu and Zuri for being on her side as she insists the three stay with her during her visit. While Fuli is willing to leave the Guard, Kion asks her that they must appease Dhahabu for her treaty in which she agrees. Later, a [[Reirei's Pack|pack of jackals]] ambushes her and the Lion Guard and the two zebras [[Raha]] and [[Starehe]] manage to protect the golden zebra from being eaten. After protecting her from the jackals, Dhahabu convinces the situation telling Tiifu, Zuri, and Fuli to be her permanent guard. Much to the Lion Guard being surprised that Fuli is leaving the group and instead of correcting Dhahabu, Raha and Starehe let Zuri take credit in being the Queen's Guard.

Later when Dhahabu is at a water hole, the jackals attack again along with crocodiles as Ono is surprised that the jackals are attacking her as the Lion Guard, along with Raha and Starehe, manage to rescue her, fighting off the predators as they retreat. She then thanks Fuli, Tiifu, and Zuri for their actions in protecting her as the group return to [[Pride Rock]], where Dhahabu renews the water treaty in the Pride Lands.
