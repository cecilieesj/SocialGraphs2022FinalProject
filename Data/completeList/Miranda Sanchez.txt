'''Miranda Isabella Sanchez''' is a fictional character from the TV series ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''.

==Family==
It is stated in several episodes that Miranda and her family are from [[Mexico]], and they celebrate its cultures and holidays. The Halloween episode shows her family preparing for DÃ­a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) which is a holiday dedicated to celebrating loved ones who have passed. She also knows some Spanish when the gang attempt to go on a Spanish game show, but not enough to be very helpful.

Miranda is shown babysitting her baby sister in one episode; this is the only sibling she is portrayed as having in the series, but a planned spin-off for which a pilot episode was filmed but never aired featured Miranda's sister, Stevie Sanchez, as the titular character and made her just a few years younger than Miranda.

Near the end of the series, Miranda appeared less in the show, although she appeared in the final episode. She was, however, absent from ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'', which went to theaters in 2003.

She did not appear in ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'' was due to her visting family in [[Mexico]].

==Trivia==
*In 4th Grade, Miranda snacked on puppy's biscuits.
*Miranda is of Mexican heritage in comparison to the Filipino actress Lalaine in reality.
*It is revealed in "Misadventures in Babysitting" that she has a baby sister, but her infant sister was never seen in the series.
*Her parents are Edward and [[Daniella Sanchez]], and she has a sister, Stevie, as revealed later when Disney Channel announced the spin-off show about her sister, What's Stevie Thinking, starring [[Selena Gomez]] as Stevie (though the show never aired).
*Miranda is smart, witty, and sometimes doesn't get along with Gordo. She and Lizzie were friends with Kate for a while, but Kate gained popularity and became their nemesis.
*Matt had a crush on her in the episode, "Working Girl".
*She was born on December 15, 1989.
