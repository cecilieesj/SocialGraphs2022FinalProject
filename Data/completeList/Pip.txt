{{Quote|I gotta lay off the nuts!|Pip}}
'''Pip''' is a chipmunk who is a friend of [[Giselle]] and the secondary tritagonist of ''[[Enchanted]]''.

==Role in the films==
===''[[Enchanted]]''===
Pip first appears at [[Giselle]]'s hollow tree house and (but not quite) saves her from a troll. When [[Queen Narissa|Narissa]] pushes Giselle into a well, Pip witnesses this and rushes to alert [[Prince Edward]]. They travel to [[New York City]] the next day, but as soon as Pip arrives, he realizes that he is barely able to speak. He figures out Narissa and Nathaniel's evil plot to kill Giselle and tries to warn Prince Edward, but he misinterprets all of his movements. He is then captured by Nathaniel but manages to escape and find Giselle to tell her about Prince Edward.

He becomes captured again when Nathaniel finds him and traps him in a plastic ball. However, he manages to escape and roll his way up to the Woolworth Building. Prince Edward releases him, and he immediately rushes up to help Giselle and Robert defeat Narissa.

After everything was over, he returns to [[Andalasia]] and publishes a book about his experience in New York, which turns him into a celebrity.

===''[[Disenchanted]]''===
Pip returns to the real world in the second film via Giselle's wish for a fairytale life in Monroeville. However, this time, he retains his ability to speak unlike the first time. At one point, he is transformed into a talking cat against his will.

==Trivia==
*Pip is probably based on [[Timothy Q. Mouse]] in ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]''. Like Timothy, he assists the hero, and (in his animated form) speaks with a New York accent.
*Jeff Bennett‘s voice for Pip is the same voice he uses for Ace in ''The Powerpuff Girls''.
*Pip was inspired by wisecracking Disney sidekicks, like [[Mushu]] the dragon from ''[[Mulan]]'' and [[Timon]] the Meerkat from ''[[The Lion King]]''.
