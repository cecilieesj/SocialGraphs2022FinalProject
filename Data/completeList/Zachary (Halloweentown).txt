== Appearances ==

=== [[Halloweentown High]] ===
After [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]], [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]], [[Sophie Piper|Sophie]], [[Gwen Piper|Gwen]] and [[Aggie Cromwell|Aggie]] permanently open the portal between the human realm and [[Halloweentown (place)|Halloweentown]], Marnie suggests to the [[Halloweentown Council]] that several students from Halloweentown be allowed to attend high school in the human realm. Zachary is a Zombie chosen to be one of these students, alongside an Ogre named [[Chester (Halloweentown)|Chester]], a Troll named [[Natalie]], a Wood Nymph named [[Nancy (Halloweentown)|Nancy]], a Witch named [[Cassie]], a Warlock named [[Ethan Dalloway|Ethan]], a Gremlin named [[Bobby (Halloweentown)|Bobby]], a Werecat named [[Jessica (Halloweentown)|Jessica]], and a Werewolf named [[Pete (Halloweentown)|Pete]].

Upon arrival at his new school, Zachary is provided a disguise that hides his identity as a Zombie and is told that he is a foreign exchange student from Canada - though he, like many of the other Halloweentown students end up spending most of their time in apart from the rest of the student body. This prompts Marnie to encourage everyone to get involved in extracurricular activities in order to socialize.

During a visit to the local mall, Zachary is offended by the portrayal of creatures at a Halloween store, something that leads to Ethan picking a fight with a couple of guys saying that everything related to Halloween is for freaks. During the scuffle, [[Edgar Dalloway]] floods the scene with purple smoke, allowing Ethan to plunge an iron dagger into one of the pumpkins in the display as his father had told him. Once Aggie clears the smoke, it reveals Zachary and the other students for what they really are, prompting a hasty retreat back to the Piper-Cromwell family home. Following Cassie's kidnapping at Edgar's hand, many of the Halloweentown students returned home - including Zachary - with only Pete, Chester, Natalie, and Ethan remaining.

After the portal to Halloweentown is closed by Edgar, it is promptly reopened by the Halloweentown Council after Chester, Pete, and Natalie reveal themselves and are accepted by their fellow students; thus proving that humans really have changed. Then, Zachary returns to the human real alongside Gwen, Cassie, Bobby, Jessica, and Nancy and The Halloweentown Council captures Edgar within a Witch's Glass. Declaring peace between the two realms, The Halloweentown Council takes their leave, allowing Zachary and the rest of Halloweentown to traverse between the two freely.
