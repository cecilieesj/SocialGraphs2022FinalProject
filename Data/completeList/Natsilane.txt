'''Natsilane''' from the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]] animated series, ''[[Gargoyles]]'', is the young chieftain of the Haida on Queen Florence Island. He goes by the Western name of "Nick". He appears in the episode "[[Heritage]]".

Educated at the University at Harvard, Natsilane was skeptical about the legends and beliefs of his people, particularly the old tales of [[Raven (Gargoyles)|Raven]] lurking on a volcano top and periodically laying waste to the island.

==Trivia==
*Natsilane is based on the culture hero of Native American mythology, who is most famous for having created the first killer whale (orca) out of a block of wood.
