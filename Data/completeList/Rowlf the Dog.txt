'''Rowlf the Dog''' was the first Muppet to reach national stardom as a cast member of ''The Jimmy Dean Show'' from [[1963]] to [[1966]]. He later went on to serve as the resident piano player and music composer on ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show The Muppet Show]'', where he also played the silly surgeon Dr. Bob in the recurring sketch "Veterinarian's Hospital".
==Appearances==
===''[[w:c:muppets:The Muppet Movie|The Muppet Movie]]''===
Rowlf was prominently featured in ''The Muppet Movie'' as a piano player at [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Terrace_Restaurant The Terrace Restaurant], where he first meets [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]. When Kermit is down, Rowlf shares his motto in life, a motto even he can't follow - "stay away from women." The two sing "[[w:c:muppets:I Hope That Somethin' Better Comes Along|I Hope That Somethin' Better Comes Along]]". An original draft of the script describes the song as "a sad/funny little duet based on the old 'can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em' theme, designed to allow for some good harmony howling from Rowlf."

The song featured a rare pairing of characters, as [[Jim Henson]] virtually performed a duet with himself. In order to achieve the effect, the vocals of the two characters were recorded separately by Henson and then combined.

Rowlf soon joined Kermit and the rest of the gang on their way to [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Hollywood Hollywood]. Before joining the Muppets, Rowlf's life was simple - he lived alone, would "go to work, come home, read a book, have a couple of beers, take [himself] for a walk and go to bed." While in the desert, Rowlf played harmonica as [[Gonzo]] sang "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/I'm_Going_to_Go_Back_There_Someday I'm Going to Go Back There Someday]" (while [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] played guitar). Rowlf served as the film's cameraman in the finale, as the Muppets prepare to shoot their movie.

Rowlf appeared in the promotional special ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_Go_Hollywood The Muppets Go Hollywood]'', accompanying [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Johnny_Mathis Johnny Mathis] as he sang "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Never_Before,_Never_Again Never Before, Never Again]".

===''[[w:c:muppets:The Great Muppet Caper|The Great Muppet Caper]]''===
Rowlf is seen playing the piano at the [[w:c:muppets:Happiness Hotel|Happiness Hotel]] welcoming Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo. He also joined with the other Muppets to help clear [[Miss Piggy|Miss Piggy's]] good name and catch the thieves red-handed.

===''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''===
Rowlf makes a brief appearance as a piano player at [[Fozziwig|Fozziwig's]] Christmas party.

===''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''===
Rowlf appears briefly as a patron at the [[Admiral Benbow Inn]] at the beginning of the film.

===''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''===
Rowlf appears at the very end of the film, singing along with Dorothy and the other Muppets.

===''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''===
Rowlf appeared as one of the main characters in ''The Muppets'', again performed by Barretta. He rejoins the Muppets to help put on the telethon to save the Muppet Studios. At one point, he laments being excluded from the montage gathering the Muppets; a clip is then shown of Kermit, Walter, Gary and Mary asking Rowlf, who is laying in a hammock if he wants to join the reunion, to which he replies "Okay."

Rowlf returns to his role as the pianist for [[The Muppet Orchestra|the Muppet Theater orchestra]], playing for both "[[w:c:muppets:The Muppet Show Theme|The Muppet Show Theme]]" and the musical finale of "[[Life's a Happy Song]]". Rowlf also performs in The Muppet Telethon as a member of the Muppet Barbershop Quartet, along with [[Link Hogthrob]], [[Sam the Eagle (Muppets)|Sam Eagle]] and [[Beaker]], singing "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" while shaving [[Jack Black]].

A sinister doppelg√§nger of Rowlf, named Roowlf, appears in the film as a member of [[The Moopets]].

Rowlf starred in the Muppets' promotional tie-in commercial for Alamo Rent a Car, and Yamaha Entertainment's Muppets sweepstake. Rowlf was also featured in a series of promotional posters spoofing ''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn'' as WereRowlf. He also appeared in the OK Go music video for "The Muppet Show Theme Song."

According to an interview with ''Yamaha All Access'', Rowlf considers Jason Segel "a fine piano player. During the movie, we jammed together between takes. Boogie-woogie! Jason plays a mean boogie, and my woogie is still wagging, even if I say so myself.

Rowlf appeared in the opening of Jim Henson's Musical World, both in video from his performance with Jimmy Dean at Carnegie Hall in 1965, and in the actual hall. He lamented the fact that it took Carnegie Hall 47 years to invite him back. Rowlf also sang "I Never Harmed an Onion" at the Just for Laughs show in July 2012.

==Post-Henson==
After the death of [[Jim Henson]], Rowlf continued to appear in Muppet productions, silently (and usually briefly). A rumor arose that the character would be permanently silent as a sign of respect to Jim. As [[Brian Henson]] commented on in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Audio_Commentaries audio commentary] for ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Christmas_Carol_(video) The Muppet Christmas Carol]'', Rowlf continued to appear as a tribute to the character and Henson's legacy. Still, he wasn't immediately recast and kept in the forefront like Kermit, because at the time, the Muppeteers didn't feel there was a suitable and appropriate performer for the task.

Rowlf was featured silently in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (playing piano at [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fozziwig Fozziwig]'s party) and ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (as a patron of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Admiral_Benhow_Inn The Admiral Benbow Inn]).

[[Bill Barretta]] starting taking on the character in 1996 and gradually transitioned into the role. Although Rowlf only appeared in one episode of ''Muppets Tonight'', he uttered his first words since Jim's passing in [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_102:_Garth_Brooks episode 102]; while playing piano during the closing number, Rowlf exclaims "Oh yeah!" He also appeared in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppets_from_Space Muppets from Space]'' as a resident of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Boarding_House the Muppet Boarding House] and, at one point, muttered an audible "Oogh!".

Rowlf had several lines of dialogue, a first since Henson's passing, in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_The The Muppet Show Live]'' in 2001 and also spoke 2 lines of dialogue ("Hey, Kermit!" and "Yeah! Heh, heh. Oh!") in ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/It's_a_Very_Merry_Muppet_Christmas_Movie It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie]'' in 2002.

Rowlf appeared in the "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Keep_Fishin Keep Fishin]" music video for rock band Weezer. Although he's only briefly seen (one ''can'' hear him muttering "Good job, River" and "Yeah"), Rowlf had a more prominent role in the behind the scenes making-of special that accompanied it, ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Weezer_and_the_Muppets_Go_Fishin' Weezer and the Muppets Go Fishin']''.

In 2005, Rowlf had a 190-word monolog in the second episode of ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Statler_and_Waldorf:_From_the_Balcony Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony]''. Additionally, Bill Barretta recorded the vocals as Rowlf singing "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Christmas_Party_Sing-Along The Christmas Party Sing-Along]" for the 2006 album ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/A_Green_and_Red_Christmas A Green and Red Christmas]''.

For ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Pepe's_Extended_Interview_with_Quentin_Tarantino extended interview with Quentin Tarantino], [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino Tarantino] commented on how he was disappointed that Rowlf didn't appear much in the movie. [[Pepe the King Prawn|Pepe]] explained this by saying Rowlf was in a car accident and broke his tail and preferred to not do too many scenes.

Rowlf was prominently featured in a pair of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_viral_videos online videos] in 2008: the first being "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_viral_videos Rolling with the Skateboarding Dog]" (where [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] comments on his age) and the next being "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_viral_videos Skateboarding Dog Gets Served]" (where Rowlf tries to show up [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Tyson Tyson], a skateboarding bulldog).

Rowlf made a rare live appearance on ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Late_Night_with_Jimmy_Fallon Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]'', where he sings the "8 maids a-milking" line for [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas The Twelve Days of Christmas] number while playing keyboards with [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Roots the Roots].

Rowlf has a speaking cameo in the "Game Day" episode of ''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_Kitchen_with_Cat_Cora The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora]''. Referencing his absence in recent years, he comments "It's a small part, but times are ruff."

Rowlf also had a semi-prominent role in ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''. He was also notably featured in the [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/OK_Go OK Go] music video for "[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show_Theme The Muppet Show Theme Song]".
