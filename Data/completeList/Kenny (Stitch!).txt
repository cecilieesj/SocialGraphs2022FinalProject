'''Kenny''' ('''Kouji '''in the [[Japan]]ese original) is a character in the first two seasons of ''[[Stitch!]]''. He is the older brother of [[Penny (Stitch!)|Penny]].

==Role in the series==
Kenny is Penny's older brother, although they appear to hate each other for unknown reasons. However, in an episode of the first season, when Kenny gets turned into a toddler by [[Babyfier]], Penny is shown to feel sad for her brother, even though she usually despises him. Kenny and his friends, Marvin and Ted, are also known as Penny's minions.

Despite his hostility and rivalry with [[Yuna Kamihara|Yuna]] and [[Stitch]], Kenny, like her sister, has shown that he can sometimes get along with them. An example of one of these moments is when Stitch helped Kenny make [[Sasha]] fall in love with him, using his cousin [[Hunkahunka]].

At the end of the second season, Kenny, along with everyone else, had tears of happiness in his eyes when he saw that Stitch had managed to survive the explosion of the black hole, showing that he was also incredibly affected by the idea that Stitch had died in the explosion.

Kenny is also shown to be in love with both Sasha and Yuna's cousin, [[Tigerlily Sakai|Tigerlily]]. As evidence, at the end of one of the episodes of the second season, after Stitch gave back everything his cousins [[Bonnie (Lilo & Stitch)|Bonnie]] and [[Clyde (Lilo & Stitch)|Clyde]] had stolen from the people of [[Izayoi Island]], his diary got to Tigerlily and she read it out loud that Kenny was still in love with Sasha, but at the same time he was attracted by Tigerlily's mature beauty. 

==Trivia==
*[[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] called [[Stitch]] "Kenny" when he was in his disguise in [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the original series]].
