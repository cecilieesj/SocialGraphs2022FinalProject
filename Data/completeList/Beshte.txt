{{Quote|Twende kiboko!|Beshte}}

'''Beshte''' is the pentagonist of the [[Disney Junior]] show ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is a hippo and one of [[Kion]]'s friends and a former member of the [[Lion Guard]]. His position on the team was the Strongest in the [[Pride Lands]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Beshte has been described as a happy-go-lucky hippo. He is the most genial character in the group and is very friendly and encouraging. He speaks with a surprisingly soft demeanor despite his size and is also very compassionate. Beshte has an appropriately large heart and never fails to treat his friends with kindness. He is also the first of his friends to recognize that [[Kion]] needs some space, even pointing out to [[Bunga]], Kion's best friend, what the cub needs.

===Physical appearance===
Beshte has a stout body with thick legs, dark gray-purple toenails, and three dark spots on his back. His body color is that of a neutral gray, which becomes much paler across his chest and jawline. His inner ears are pale pink, and the area around his eyes is a lighter shade of his body color. He has a disproportionately large snout, with small ears and eyes, as well as thick eyebrows. His teeth are rather large, with two protruding over his upper jaw, and a patch of black hair sticks up from his otherwise bald head. His eyes are bright blue.

In "[[Battle for the Pride Lands]]", as a teenager, Beshte has grown taller, the tuft of hair has gotten bigger and he has also starts to display small whiskers, similar in appearance to his father, [[Basi]].

===Abilities===

*'''Skilled Combatant:''' With his size and strength, Beshte is proven to be a great combatant against many opponents.
*'''Expert Swimmer:''' As a hippopotamus; Beshte is an excellent swimmer.
*'''Stealth:''' Beshte stated himself that he is not very good on land to have stealth, but he is proven to have great stealth in the water, as proven to be true against the hyenas.
*'''Singing:''' As demonstrated throughout the series; Beshte is an excellent singer.
*'''Animal Strength:''' Beshte is the strongest member in the entire [[Lion Guard]]; for example, he was able to push a large boulder with little struggle and the same with a heavy tree that was falling as he tries to hold it as much as he could with extra weight of the baboons that were living in it with Bunga. With his large size, he is able to show off his brute strength as he slams into the clan of the hyenas and the [[Outsiders]] to toss them into the air.
*'''Animal Agility:''' Beshte the third most agile member in the entire Lion Guard. However, he is more agile in the water, then he is on land.
*'''Aquatic:''' As a hippopotamus, Beshte is able to swim and hold his breath underwater for a certain period of time.

==Role in the series==

===''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]''===
Beshte makes his debut in the series premiere. Beshte is first seen in the Floodplains with the other hippos. During Kion and Bunga's game of Baobab Ball they leap over the hippos. Beshte doesn't mind and says hello to them. Later when Kion assembles his team. Beshte asks the hippos if they want a water slide. He pushes rocks and creates a waterslide.

Beshte soon joins his friends as Kion asks if they could all become part of the new Lion Guard. Beshte gets excited and is ready to see the [[Roar of the Elders]]. However Kion is only able to do a  little squeak. Suddenly [[Simba]] arrives and sees that his son has not chosen a group of lions for the Guard. He scolds Kion in front of Beshte and the others, and Kion leaves to do some soul-searching. Bunga begins to follow, but Beshte tells him that Kion wants to be alone.

Later when the hyenas are chasing the gazelles Beshte watches with [[Fuli]] and [[Ono]]. He is confused as to why the hyenas are continuing the attack, seeing as they have already taken down enough gazelles to feed them all. Kion and Bunga arrive, and Kion explains it is up to Lion Guard is going to stop the hyenas. Beshte is doubtful, remembering what Simba said, but Kion reminds him of their talents, and Beshte agrees. Kion comes up with a plan to take down the hyenas, and Beshte and the others prove willing to join the Guard. Kion places his paw on each of their shoulders, marking them with the [[Mark of the Guard]]. Beshte then proceeds to use his strength to knock over the hyenas, whilst Ono takes down [[Mzingo]] and the others help tackle the hyenas with Beshte. In the end, [[Janja]] taunts Kion, which causes him to use the Roar of the Elders to blow him and the other hyenas away as Beshte, Bunga, Fuli, and Ono watch in awe.
