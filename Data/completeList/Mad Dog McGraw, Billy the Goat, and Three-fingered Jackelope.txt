==Appearance==
Mad Dog is an obese, light brown anthropomorphic dog; Billy is a slender, gray anthropomorphic billy goat; and Jackelope is a slender, light blue anthropomorphic jackalope. All three wear Old Western clothes. Only Mad Dog and Billy wear black cowboy boots, but Jackelope is seen barefoot.

==Role in the series==
In a flashback, [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] were visiting the Old West. They were at a bar playing poker, and won. When three outlaws: Mad Dog McGraw, Billy the Goat, and Three-fingered Jackelope arrived at the bar, Mad Dog told Timon and Pumbaa to rendezvous with him at a given time for a showdown.

Because of Mad Dog's ultimatum, Timon and Pumbaa attempted to sell the town, but to no avail. The two friends then boarded a train to exile themselves from the town. However, Mad Dog and his minions later showed up to rob the train. Timon and Pumbaa disguised themselves as Mexican bandits with fake mustaches and spied on Mad Dog to see what he was up to.

Mad Dog and his minions later took Timon and Pumbaa to their hideout. Timon convinced Pumbaa to talk to the Jackelope (which he meant Mad Dog), while the former talked to Billy the Goat. Mad Dog then removed Timon and Pumbaa's fake mustaches after suspecting them for their behaviors, and the three outlaws pursued the two, who eventually plummeted down the river.

The scene then switches back to the present, where Timon and Pumbaa fall off the tree branches but miss the pit hole full of snakes and scorpions. Timon then decides to fight Mad Dog so that he and Pumbaa can save the Western town.

Timon and Mad Dog prepare to fight. Timon takes out two bananas, which causes Mad Dog to run away since he's allergic to bananas. Thus, Timon and Pumbaa trap Billy and Jackelope in a banana cage, and then pelt Mad Dog with bananas until he flees to prison.
