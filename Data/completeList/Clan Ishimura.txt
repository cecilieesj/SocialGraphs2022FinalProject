==Characteristics==
It is notable that gargoyles of Ishimura sometimes have fewer digits on their feet or hands, or have more digits on their wings than is found among other gargoyle clans. Besides that, many of the clan's members have thick brow ridges, horns, and spikes, often having more than one pair of horns. Many have spikes, blades, or forked features on the ends of their tails. Some members have beaks, but they appear to be a minority. So far, none of the observed members are hairless or light-haired, none have feather-like wing coverings, and none have their wings attached to their arms and legs.

==Background==
===History===
The gargoyles of Clan Ishimura fought alongside the samurai of ancient Japan. When peace found Japan, the gargoyles settled alongside the humans of Ishimura to help defend the town from criminals and to teach Bushido.

One of those students, [[Taro]] who was a poor student at best, grew up and became a very wealthy businessman. He formulated a plan to exploit Clan Ishimura for his financial benefit and duped the dissatisfied [[Yama]] into assisting him. A wrench was thrown into his plan, however, when the [[Avalon]] Travelers arrived. He calmly adapted the plan to include kidnapping [[Goliath]], [[Angela]], and [[Bronx]] with the domestic clan and display the whole lot in his gargoyle theme park.

Elisa, with the assistance of Hiroshi, the town's police constable, tracked them down to the theme park, where the two managed to help the rebelling gargoyles to escape. They also helped to dissuade the press from believing in the gargoyles by claiming they were invisible and a hundred feet tall.

Even though Yama believed that the theme park was designed so his clan could teach the children of the world Bushido, he acted without honor and betrayed his clan. For his punishment, he was banished until his last honor could be restored.

==Known Members==
*[[Kai (Gargoyles)|Kai]] - Clan leader
*[[Sora (Gargoyles)|Sora]] - Second in Command
*[[Yama (Gargoyles)|Yama]]

==Trivia==
*Clan Ishimura lives in a temple outside of the town.
*To show their trust and respect for their human protectorate, they sleep facing into the center of the temple.
*The decision to create a gargoyle clan in [[Japan]] was made partly because the TV series was animated in Japan.
*Unlike the other clans' names which have the name of the place they are in before the word "Clan", Clan Ishimura has the word "Clan" before the name of the place they are in. This is in reference to Japanese culture how people's family names go before their given names.
