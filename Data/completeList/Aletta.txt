'''Aletta''' is a character from [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s ''[[Soaring: Fantastic Flight]]''.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Aletta was the name of a falcon which belonged to one Cellino Falco in [[Mediterranean Harbor|Porto Paradiso]], [[Italy]] during the early 19th century.  Aletta would be passed down to the ownership of Cellino's daughter [[Camellia Falco]] after his death with Camellia becoming a balloonist, 19th-century aviator and the first female member of the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]].  After Camellia's death in 1875, Aletta would remain in the Museum of Fantastic Flight, seemingly agelessly while in the company of her mistress' ghost.

== Appearances ==
=== Soaring: Fantastic Flight ===
Aletta is seen on this attraction, flying with guests using her late-owner's [[Dream Flyer]] machines to glide through the skies.  Aletta's likeness can also be found throughout the queue for the attraction.


== Trivia ==
*Aletta's role in Soarin' replaces that traditionally occupied by [[Tinker Bell]] in [[Epcot]], [[Disney California Adventure]] and [[Shanghai Disneyland]].
*Aletta is similar to [[Duncan the Parrot|Duncan]] from [[Typhoon Lagoon]] in that they are both the avian pets of woman SEA members featured in the rides.
