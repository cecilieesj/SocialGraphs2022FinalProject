'''Brody Carlson''' is the new kid who comes in the episode, "The Wrath of Swan". He was only a guest star. Brody is portrayed by [[Billy Unger]].

==About==
He asked Kim to the cotillion after Jack rejected her, but he did it as a plan of initiation to enter the Black Dragons. He is a 1st degree black belt. He made Jack jealous by flirting with Kim constantly. Rudy reveals that he tried to recruit him but Brody was dead set on being a Black Dragon.

At the cotillion, he is crowned King with Kim being his Queen, but then the plan takes action. The Black Dragons, mainly Frank, had sprayed Kim with mushroom gravy. When the Black Dragons wanted to fight the Wasabi Warriors, he regretted doing that to Kim, and he stepped up and did the right thing, winning against Frank.
