The '''Barrel of Monkeys''' is a real-life toy/game by [[wikipedia:Milton Bradley|Milton Bradley]] seen in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' franchise. It consists of a colored barrel ([[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s is yellow) containing twelve red monkeys. The goal of the game is to pick up the most monkeys by creating a chain with their hooked arms.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story]]''===
In the first film, they are first seen being used by Andy's toys as they try to save [[Buzz Lightyear]] after falling out of the window of Andy's room in ''Toy Story''.

The monkeys appear again at the end of the film in Andy's room engaging in the Christmas festivities with the rest of Andy's toys, hearing what presents Andy receives for Christmas from the [[Green Army Men]].

===''[[Toy Story 2]]''===
In the second film, they appear in a scene where Andy has [[Hamm]], portraying as "Evil Dr. Porkchop," give Woody the choice of "Shark" or "Death by Monkeys" for a captive [[Bo Peep]]. They are later seen at the very end of film joining the rest of the toys to watch [[Wheezy]] sing "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]."

They later appear in one of the [[outtakes]], harassing [[Mr. Potato Head]], when [[Mrs. Potato Head]] suggests that he take monkey chow with him in his parts storage on the journey to save Woody.

===''[[Toy Story 3]]''===
In the third film, they are seen in an opening scene during Andy's play scenario that takes place in the wild west. [[Hamm]], as Evil Dr. Porkchop controlling his ship, activates the button labeled "Death by Monkeys," which unleashes a barrel that explodes when it hits the ground, sending thousands of monkeys scattering in all directions. The monkeys grab [[Woody]], [[Jessie]], and Buzz, holding them hostage, as Mr. Potato Head, whom Andy portrays as the villainous [[Mr. Potato Head#One-Eyed Bart|One-Eyed Bart]], prepares to finish them off.

Later, when Woody gathers all the toys remaining, none of the monkeys are seen. Since Barrel of Monkeys is actually a game, the monkeys may have been put in the attic.

===''[[Toy Story Toons]]''===
===="[[Hawaiian Vacation]]"====
The Barrel of Monkeys are seen in the ''Toy Story Toons'' episode, "Hawaiian Vacation". In the episode, [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] is seen to have three red barrels. Each barrel is being played by an [[Little Green Men|Alien]] as a drum, while the monkeys dance as they put on a Hawaiian show for [[Ken]] and [[Barbie]].

===''[[Toy Story 4]]''===
In the fourth movie, they appear at the beginning of the movieÂ in the flashback when [[RC]] is stuck in the flood so the monkeys helped Slinky get more stretched.

==Trivia==
*[[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s Barrel of Monkeys is based on the '90s variety.
*It is a possibility that the Barrel of Monkeys was given to Andy for his birthday in the first ''[[Toy Story]]'' film, as they were not seen until [[Rex]] was trying to help [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] when he was pushed out of the window.
*Aliens hanging in the same fashion as the Barrel of Monkeys appear in ''Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast.''
*There are approximately 1.4 million monkeys in the "Death by Monkeys" explosion in the Western opening of ''Toy Story 3''.<ref name="Bluray">"Cine-Explore" (supplementary material on Blu-Ray disc release of ''Toy Story 3''). 2010. Blu-Ray disc. Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2010.</ref>
