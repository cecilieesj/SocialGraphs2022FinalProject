{{Quote|This is StellaLou. Her dream is to become a dancer and performer in New York.|StellaLou's backstory.}}

'''StellaLou''' (ステラルー) is a lavender rabbit appearing in [[American Waterfront]] at [[Tokyo DisneySea]]. She loves dancing.

==Background==
One day, Duffy came to American Waterfront and saw a little girl bunny named StellaLou who was practicing a dance in front of the [[SS Columbia (Tokyo DisneySea)|S.S. Columbia]]. When she stumbled, Duffy called out to her in concern. StellaLou told Duffy that she dreamed of becoming a dancer. Duffy thought that a dream was just something you had when sleeping, but StellaLou explained that a dream is also seeing what you want to be when you grow up. StellaLou was practicing so hard, Duffy was sure her dream would come true.
