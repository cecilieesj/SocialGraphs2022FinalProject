== History ==

=== Background ===
Ice is a Floridian alligator which came to inhabit the hastily built ski-resort of Blizzard Beach, built after a freak snowstorm hit [[Florida]]. When the resort began melting, the gator gleefully took up water skiing at the locale and crashed through the roof of the nearby Beach Haus.

This event inspired the resort owners to transform Blizzard Beach into a sort of water-park resort from the remains of the ski-resort. He and his unnamed niece (who appears in statue form at the Tike's Peak kids area) have been playing on the slopes ever since.

=== Development History ===
Ice was created to be the mascot for Blizzard Beach and is affiliated with the alligator in the park's backstory. Originally created by Imagineer Tim Kirk in a "Ski Florida!" gag sketch related to the project, Jim Shull would refine the design into its final form. His popularity led to the creation of hisÂ [[Disney's Typhoon Lagoon|Typhoon Lagoon]] counterpart, [[Lagoona Gator]]. A third gator was planned for [[Disney's River Country|River Country]], named Ranger Gator, but ultimately wasn't used.<ref>https://twitter.com/JimShull/status/1422698688644665344</ref>

== Appearances ==

=== Blizzard Beach ===
Ice's presence is found throughout the park in (faux) ice sculptures of his likeness. His body outline can be seen in the roof of the Beach Haus gift-shop. Furthermore, he will make [[Theme Park Characters|meet 'n' greet]] appearances.
