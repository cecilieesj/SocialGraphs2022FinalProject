{{Quote|It's only because I still worry over you that you have survived.|Frigga}}

'''Frigga''' is the wife of [[Odin Borson|Odin]], the mother of [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] and the adoptive mother of [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]].

This version of the mythological Frigga was created by [[Stan Lee]], Robert Bernstein, and Joe Sinott.

==Background==
===Personality===
Frigga is a strong woman, a majestic queen, and perfectly able to stand at [[Odin Borson|Odin]]'s side. Despite her attention to protocol, she is a loving and tender mother to both her sons. When Odin brought the infant [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] to Asgard after the war with the Jotuns, Frigga accepted him as her own without any hesitation, although she believed that Odin should have told him the truth about his origins all along. While she clearly attempts to believe in only the good in her sons, she is also intuitive and perceptive about other intentions. She is also generally accepted as a good judge of character.

===Powers and Abilities===
As an [[Asgardians|Asgardian]], Frigga possesses superhuman physical attributes, such as increased strength, fast reflexes, longevity, and exceptional beauty. Despite the notion that not many Asgardian women are warriors, Frigga is ready, willing, and certainly able to hold her own even against Jotuns. During the attack in Odin's bed-chamber, she manages to kill a Frost Giant with a single strike.

====Powers====
*'''Longevity:''' As an Asgardian, Frigga possesses a natural lifespan of approximately five-thousand years.
*'''Superior Reflexes:''' Frigga's mobility and co-ordination are honed to the levels of an athlete.

==== Abilities====
*'''[[Magic]]:''' Frigga has knowledge of Asgardian techniques for creating realistic illusions. She has demonstrated the ability to create a flawless decoy of a person in her vicinity and has also sent an animated image of herself to another location within the Asgardian palace. In both cases, the optical illusions had accompanying projected sound.
*'''Swordsmanship:''' Frigga has advanced martial training with long blades, and uses a longsword in a reverse-grip with a highly mobile low stance.

==Appearances==
===''Thor''===
Frigga is the wife of Odin Borson, mother of Thor, and the queen of [[Asgard]]. She is compassionate and nurturing to Thor and to her adopted son [[Loki Laufeyson]], the son of King Laufey whom Odin brought with him from Jotunheim after the war with the Frost Giants. She raised both of her sons with equal love and warmth and is loved dearly by both of them in return. She appears to be a good and wise queen who is very highly regarded by all of her husband's subjects.

When Thor was about to be made king of Asgard, Frigga assisted in the ceremony, standing beside Loki and gazing at Thor with pride as well as hope that he will become more mature and intelligent than he currently was. She was absent during Thor's banishment by the hands of Odin, but learned about it soon afterwards, presumably from Loki. Angered by the news, Frigga confronted her husband and insisted that he return Thor to Asgard. When Odin refused, she eventually came to accept that there was a reason for his actions.

When Odin fell into the Odinsleep, Frigga stayed at his bedside, afraid that he had put off the sleep for too long and would never awaken. It was also at this time that Loki learned of his true parentage and questioned Odin's intentions in taking him from Jotunheim. Frigga tried to reassure her adopted child that he was loved and an integral part of the family, even going so far as to make Loki king in his father and brother's absences. She went on to express her hope for Thor's return, which prompted Loki to visit his brother on Earth. There he falsely told Thor that Odin had died and Frigga had forbidden their banished son from ever returning to Asgard.

Loki then made a secret pact with Laufey, in which he claimed that he would enable the Frost Giant king to enter Asgard and kill Odin. Frigga bravely defended her sleeping husband and slew one of the Jotun warriors before being thrown across the room by Laufey. Loki appeared and slew Laufey with the staff Gungir, revealing their pact to be a trap. Unaware of her adopted son's deception, Frigga embraced Loki as he promised to make the Jotuns pay for what they had done. Thor returned to the palace immediately afterwards and Frigga ran to him, embracing him with even greater joy. When Thor informed her of Loki's mischief and his ordeal in returning, she did not lash out at either of her children despite her shock and confusion. Upon receiving news of Loki's death, Frigga went into mourning and found it difficult to comfort her husband and firstborn son.

===''Thor: The Dark World Prelude''===
One year after Loki's "death", Frigga discovered that Loki had survived and made a deal with [[Thanos]] and the Other. She tried to talk to him, but Loki told her it wasn't a good time to talk. Frigga told Thor and Odin that he was alive and that he was planning to do something with the [[Tesseract]].

After Thor and Loki return to Asgard, Frigga was relieved to see Loki back. Odin told Loki that the only reason he wouldn't be executed was because Frigga still loves him.

===''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''===
{{Quote|You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.|Frigga to Loki}}
Frigga is relieved when Loki returns to Asgard, but she is disheartened towards Loki's villainous acts at the same time. At her urging, Odin allows Loki to live as a prisoner, but he initially can not see Frigga again. 

Frigga later visits Loki, and it is revealed that she has been sending books for him and other things to make his time in prison as comfortable as possible. They argue about his desire to rule, which led to his imprisonment, and also about Odin as Loki states that he is not his father. Frigga then replies that if that was the case, she would not be his mother either, which Loki agrees but is cleary hurt by this truth. Noticing how her son was affected by his own words, Frigga states that Loki can be much more perceptive about others than about his own feelings as the illusion she is projecting inside the prison disappears, leaving a tearful Loki alone.

She is killed by [[Malekith]] and [[Algrim]] while protecting [[Jane Foster]], who incorporated the Aether. Her death takes a heavy toll upon both of her sons, who become encouraged to work together in her memory to defeat Malekith.

===''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''===
Thor and [[Rocket Raccoon]] travel back to Asgard in 2013 to obtain the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, moments before the Dark Elf attack and Frigga's death at the hands of Malekith and Kurse for refusing to reveal its whereabouts. Thor covertly spied on Frigga, but she was able to detect her son's presence due to the fact that she was raised by witches. They had a heart-to-heart conversation, in which she imparted Thor guidance to succeed in defeating the Mad Titan [[Thanos]] but she did not allow him to inform the circumstances of her death because Frigga was here to help Thor's future, not hers. She then met Rocket, who was being pursued by the guards after extracting the Stone from Jane's body and told Thor they had to leave. Before departing, Thor summoned [[Mjolnir]] with Frigga telling Rocket that the process took some time. As they prepared to leave, Thor bid farewell to his mother, thus continuing the original timeline.

===''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''===
In the [[Glorious Purpose|first episode]], Frigga is seen during a footage when a member of the [[Time Variance Authority]], Mobius, is interrogating the Loki from 2012, who escaped from the Avengers when he was arrested in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and trying to tell him what would happen if he had not deviated from his predetermined future. 

Mobius shows him how he would reencounter his mother at Asgard after being arrested, as seen in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', but Loki initially thinks it is just a trick as these events still had not happened to him. Mobius shows that Loki inadvertently tells the Dark Elves his mother's location when he tries to send the enemies that are invading the palace to Thor, which results in Frigga's death. Loki is very distressed by this, he asks Mobius to see Frigga and claims that he is lying, but Mobius just replies that this is just what it repeatedly happens in the proper flow of time if Loki had not deviated from his path. Loki then threatens to kill him, but Mobius provokes him by asking if he will do the same as he did to his mother, infuriating Loki even more and he attempts to attack him, but is prevented by a time twister that Mobius is carrying. 

Later, after briefly escaping from the interrogation room, Loki returns to the room alone using the time twister he stole from Mobius and decides to see the rest of the footage of what happens in his future after Frigga's death, and cries as he watches the lifeless body of his mother being displayed onscreen.

In the [[Lamentis|third episode]], Loki tells about his mother to [[Sylvie Laufeydottir|Sylvie]], a female version of himself. Sylvie notices how Loki is a good magician and Loki explains that his mother, Frigga, is who taught him how to use magic. Sylvie asks him to tell more about her, and Loki replies that she was the queen of Asgard, a good and decent person. Sylvie then asks if he is really sure that Frigga was his mother, and Loki explains that he was adopted, which prompts Sylvie to reveal that she always knew that she was adopted, surprising Loki that only was told about the truth of his origins much later in his life. Despite this, Sylvie explains that she can barely remember her mother, so Loki continues to tell her how Frigga used to do magic for him when he was young and how she always believed in him, then casts fireworks from his hand, showing Sylvie a magic trick that Frigga taught him.

==Trivia==
* Frigga's portrayal in the Marvel Cinematic Universe holds many differences to her comic counterpart:
**In the comics, Frigga has a deep knowledge of magic, but this aspect is not shown in ''Thor'', but it was explored briefly in the sequel.
**Also, in the comics Frigga is shown to have not accepted Loki as her own child and even grew to hate him, denying him the right to call her his mother, for his mischief and mayhem against the throne of Asgard. This is opposite her portrayal in the first film. In the second film, she does hold him accountable for his invasion of Earth in ''The Avengers''.
**In the comics, Frigga is Thor's step-mother and raised him in place of his biological mother, Gaea, the Elder Goddess of Earth.
