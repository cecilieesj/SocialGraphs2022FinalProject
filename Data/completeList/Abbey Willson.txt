She is seen as a snobby, rich, egotistical teenager who frequently shows obvious signs of envying Sierra for being more popular than she is, often complimenting her whenever Riley shows anger towards Sierra. However, there is no matter how greatly she wishes to be as cool as Sierra, she always hangs by Riley and Tasumi's side. She makes her first appearance in "[[The Jerky Girls]]" and her last appearance in "[[R2: A Tale of Two Rileys|A Tale of Two Rileys]]". She is Riley's other best friend. Even though she dislikes the popular girls such as Sierra, she is seen wanting to be a part of them so bad, and has a habit of telling Sierra she is cool, even though she does not mean to. It also seems that her parents are rich. For some reasons, she can be hypocritical. She has a younger sister named [[Tiffany Willson|Tiffany]] who dated [[Todd Daring|Todd]] (Riley's brother) in the episode "[[A Little Tiff]]".
