}}'''Moses Puloki''' is [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]]'s hula teacher in the [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]].
He is very patient with his young students and very tolerant of their antics. However, he is often exasperated by the way [[Mertle Edmonds|Mertle]] and [[Elena, Teresa, and Yuki|her friends]] disrespect Lilo, but strangely doesn't do anything about this because it usually looks like everything was Lilo's fault.

==Trivia==
*In the intro sequence of [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the series]], Moses appears in two squares in the hula dance, with his image and movements mirrored to one another.
*In "[[Spooky (episode)|Spooky]]", Moses' worst fear is spiders.
*For some reason, his surname changed to "Petuli" in the episode "[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]", as Lilo called him "Mr. Petuli" when she arrived at the [[Kaiāulu Hale|hula halau]] late after feeding [[Pudge]], though he still had his given name as Lilo referred to him by his first name back at [[Lilo's House|her house]] after school.
*The classmates often call him "Kumu", which means "teacher" in Hawaiian.
*His voice actor, Kunewa Mook, is a ''kumu hula'' in real life.
*While Moses is calm and friendly to Lilo, he's not very supportive of her. As a matter of fact, he occasionally comes off being highly dismissive of her and will even outright ignore her when she is clearly being bullied by Myrtle.
