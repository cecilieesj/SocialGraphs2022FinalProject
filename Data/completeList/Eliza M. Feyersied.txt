'''Eliza M. Feyersied''' is the founder of the [[Fireside Girls]]. She is first seen in a window that looks like a painting. She helps [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] to get her tickets to the Paisley Sideburn Brothers concert by allowing her to become a Fireside Girl if she earns 50 patches. Candace fails to earn the final patch in time, but she gives her a special patch for breaking the all-time record and awards her with the tickets ("[[Fireside Girl Jamboree]]").

She is very elderly and uses a walker. Since she founded the Fireside Girls, she knows everything about the group and the people in it. She also built the Fireside Girls clubhouse, which is a log cabin in the middle of downtown [[Danville]].
==Trivia==
*Her surname, Feyersied, sounds very similar to "Fireside".
*She makes a cameo in "[[Lights, Candace, Action!]]" when the audience turns old on the back row in a purple dress.
