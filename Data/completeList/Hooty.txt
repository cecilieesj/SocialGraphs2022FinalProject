'''Hooty''' is the title character of the animated series ''[[The Owl House]]''. He is a small house demon attached to the front door, who serves as the guardian of the [[The Owl House (location)|Owl House]].
Hooty is also the house itself and controls everything in the Owl House. He can feel pain if parts of the house are attacked. He can also use an elongated neck to stretch out from the door to play in the mud or travel to distant parts of the Isle.

In the episode "[[Echoes of the Past]]", Hooty reveals he can disconnect with the house and ride in a cuckoo clock style backpack to travel to areas not on the Isle itself. Doing this however, he exposes his internal organs causing people to get sick at the sight of it.

== Background ==
Hooty's origin remains unclear. In [[Something Ventured, Someone Framed]], he mentioned that Eda has acted as his teacher sometime in the past, but the details of this are vague at best. In [[Understanding Willow]], he mentioned that it all started with a hunt and the skies were blood red.  Hooty has a habit of barging, or rather slithering, into rooms or situations unannounced and sometimes holds conversations with inanimate objects and insects. He lacks social skills and practically puts off anyone he comes into contact with including [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]], [[King (The Owl House)|King]] and [[Luz Noceda|Luz]]. Due to being ignored by everyone frequently, it can be assumed that his surreal personality is due to him suffering from severe loneliness. In [[Understanding Willow]], [[Gus Porter]] did seem to find him more interesting than either Eda or King, but quickly became victim to Hooty's eccentric ramblings while interviewing him. Nevertheless, Eda mentioned in [[Agony of a Witch]] that while Hooty can be annoying sometimes, he still has a place in her heart. In the same episode, Eda reminded Luz to feed Hooty before turning into the owl beast, suggesting that she secretly cares about Hooty.

=== Physical appearance ===
Hooty resembles the head of an owl with a small beak, a golden brown crown, a light brown face and dark brown eyes.

== Role in the [[The Owl House|series]] ==
Hooty, for the most part, does not play directly into the plot of the series, though he has had a significant amount of moments where he aids the heroes in one way or another. Some of his more notable entries are when [[Luz Noceda|Luz]], [[Willow Park|Willow]] and [[Gus Porter|Gus]] all decided to hold a moon conjuring inside of him and accidentally uprooted him from the ground; revealing that he does possess a pair of bird legs underneath. He mostly puts himself out there to annoy or intrude on other people's privacy and loves to annoy those that his residents have had some quarrel with such as [[Lilith Clawthorne|Lilith]] and [[Amity Blight|Amity]], though in the latter's case it did not end well for him. He was also there to comfort Luz after [[Eda Clawthorne|Eda]] succumbed to her curse and was taken by the Emperor's Coven.

At the start of the second season, Hooty expressed interest in being best friends with Lilith. Initially, Lilith was put off by him, but when he helped her gather ingredients for a scrying potion by fighting with fire bees, they started to get along to the point Lilith gave him a nickname.

==Relationships==
===Inhabitants of the Owl House===
[[File:Separate Tides (109).png|thumb|250px|Lilith and Hooty getting along.]]
Due to Hooty being practically omnipresent all the time, he mostly finds himself interacting with Eda, King and Luz (and later Lilith) every waking hour of the day. Hooty does not seem to realize that everyone is put off by his behavior as no one has the gumption to tell him this. He seems to view Eda as an almost maternal like figure as she is usually the one that initiates the need to care for him. Whether he actually returns the sentiment is not known, though Eda does care a great deal for the roof over head. Hooty treats Luz and King almost like siblings and will sometimes team up with the latter over various schemes as they share similar wants and needs. He actually gets along well with Luz, though she too can sometimes find him disturbing. In "[[Agony of a Witch]]", Hooty was able to recognize that Luz was sad and calmed down for once to comfort her.

When Lilith begins living in the Owl House, Hooty makes it his goal to befriend her, despite previously beating her up in the pre-mentioned episode to defend Eda. It is possible that he displays sympathy, hence his desire to befriend her and make her feel like she is part of the family. Lilith is apparently the first person to openly insult him for his flaws, as he was deeply hurt upon hearing it. Nevertheless, he defends her from the fire bees, which results in her coming to respect the house demon. He begins calling her Lulu for short while she in turn nicknames him "Hootcifer" (a play on Lucifer).

===Visitors===
While the inhabitants of the Owl House are used to Hooty, those who visit him are prone to get quickly irritated by his antics. Willow, Gus and Amity have all visited and had a run in with Hooty with differing results. Amity, with her short fuse, physically attacked him when he barged in unannounced while she was trying to converse with Luz. Willow, though having the least interaction with him, seemed genuinely intrigued with him. Gus openly thought of him being the most interesting thing as the Owl House itself and wanted to interview him for a project. However, he quickly gave up when Hooty would not stick to the subject. Through all three children, Hooty seemed somewhat oblivious to their feelings towards him.

==Trivia==
*In the Russian dub, Hooty is called Sychik.
*In "A Lying Witch and a Warden", Hooty extends his mouth open to allow people to enter the house. However, he does not ever display this ability ever again. Instead, he opens up like a regular door.
*In "Covention," Eda uses her staff to create multiple heads similar to Hooty, and they could also elongate their body.
*According to Dana Terrace in her reddit AMA, Hooty has an evil twin sibling named "Booty."
*In a table read of an ''Owl House/[[Amphibia]]'' crossover panel treat during the 2021 Comic-Con <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abPA7ZdndTI Disney Television Animation: Amphibia and The Owl House]</ref>, Eda briefly mentions something about Hooty being a "Kitten" to Luz, but doesn't explain what she meant by it. Whether what Eda said about Hooty is true or was only created for the table read alone, is unknown.
*Alex Hirsch originally provided Hooty's voice as a temporary placeholder for the pilot, while Terrace searched for an actor to voice him in the series proper, but she ended up enjoying his performance and became his official voice actor.<ref name="Placeholder"/>
*Hirsch described his voice for Hooty as "100% [him] doing the worst [[Mickey Mouse]] impersonation [he] could".<ref name="Placeholder">[https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/1427479817595756546 I first did Hootyâ€™s voice as part of a scratch (temporary, placeholder) recording for the Owl House pilot. It was 100% me doing the worst Mickey Mouse impression I could to try to make Dana laugh. She of course recognized greatness and left it in]</ref>
