Ezekiel Tugbottom is a ghost and wasn't a real founder of [[Brighton]]. He's also a brother of [[Sally Tugbottom]]. He got his false fame in life by using his family's press to take credit for his sisters exploits in a manner similar to telling tall tales. 

160 years later he came back as a ghost to admire the statue in his honor. It didn't take long for [[Molly McGee]] to realize that Ezekiel is nothing like the legends say he was; he was mean-spirited and arrogant. After Molly's friend [[Libby Stein-Torres]]' did some research the two human girls found out that it was Ezekiel's sister Sally who saved all those people from the tornado and inspired everyone to rebuild the town and Ezekiel was nothing but a lazy coward who didn't even like turnip greens and was never friends with a bear. Molly then tried to expose Ezekiel as the fraud and a liar, he truly was, but unfortunately, Ezekiel tried to stop her from destroying his false legacy only for him to reduce his beloved statute to a pile of rubble instead. Angered by this turn of events  Ezekiel tried attacking Molly again, but she was saved thanks to [[Scratch (The Ghost and Molly McGee)|Scratch]] telling Sally what what he had been doing and Ezekiel was hogtied and thoroughly reprimanded by his sister for his actions. 

After the truth came to light a Statue of Sally has built right were her brother's once stood so everyone in Brighton would know she was the true hero. Ezekiel desperately tried to convince Molly to get a smaller statue of him built only for him to be tugged by the ear by Sally back to the Ghost World.
