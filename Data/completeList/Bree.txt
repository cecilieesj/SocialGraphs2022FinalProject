'''Bree''' is a supporting character in the [[Disney Channel Original Movies|Disney Channel]] movie, ''[[Zombies (film)|Zombies]]'' and its subsequence sequels. She is [[Addison Wells]]' best friend and the girlfriend of [[Bonzo]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Bree is a highly excitable young teen who is very supportive and out-going. At first, she was shown to be shy and slightly self-conscious about herself, but thanks to Addison as well as Bonzo, she has become more of an extrovert. She can be somewhat talkative, though no one ever seems too bothered by this. She is loyal to her friends and progressively minded. 

===Physical appearance===
Bree is of African-American descent and wears round glasses. She initially wore blue and white, but now wears mostly pink and green color schemes to match with her school at Seabrook.

==Trivia==
*Bree was not in the original ''[[Zombies & Cheerleaders]]'' pilot and was most likely added so as to give the character of Addison someone to talk to. It is also possible that she was created as a replacement for Jerry, a nerdy human who hung out with the zombies, and did so when Addison was given equal focus as Zed.
*She can apparently understand zombie language very well.
