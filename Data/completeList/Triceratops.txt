==Appearances==
===''[[Fantasia]]''===
Many Triceratops appear in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' segment of ''[[Fantasia]]'' as adults and babies. They move in herds to find food. Many were seen running when the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] attacks, one of which ran into a lake to swim away as three [[Brachiosaurus|Brachiosaurs]] dived down to avoid the T-Rex as well. During the drought at the end of the segment, Triceratops walks with other dinosaurs to find more food and water, but all of them end up going extinct from starvation and dehydration.

A [[Triceratops (Tarzan)|Triceratops]] appeared in an episode of ''The Legend of Tarzan'' as one of the first dinosaurs [[Tarzan (character)|Tarzan]] and company encounter, when it charges at them.

===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===

====[[Disneyland]]====
A family of Triceratops is seen watching their eggs hatch during the [[Primeval World]] diorama on the [[Disneyland Railroad]].

====[[Walt Disney World]]====
At [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], the spinner attraction [[TriceraTop Spin]] of [[DinoLand U.S.A.|DinoLand, U.S.A. ]]features tin-toy triceratops vehicles for a [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant|Dumbo]]-esque spinner. These being themed around a roadside attraction at the Chester & Hester's Dino-Rama amusement-park.

Several triceratops were shown on the "Theories of Extinction" mural when it was displayed in the queue for [[Dinosaur (attraction)|Dinosaur]] until it was replaced in the most recent refurbishment.

====[[Tokyo Disney Resort]]====
The skeleton of a Triceratops can be seen in the rock-work of [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad|Big Thunder Mountain]] from the [[Western River Railroad]], being visible right before entering the Primeval World display.

A Triceratops skull is among the cargo at the New York docks at [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s [[American Waterfront]], apparently on the way to the American Museum of Natural History.

==Trivia==
*''Triceratops'' was incorrectly shown to have legs that sprawled out like those of a lizard. In real life, ''Triceratops'' had legs directly underneath its body like those of a rhino.
*There are currently two species of ''Triceratops'' known from the fossil record, ''T.horridus'' and ''T.prorsus''.
*At one point in time, ''Triceratops'' was often believed to be a younger version of another ceratopsian, ''[[wikipedia:Torosaurus|Torosaurus]]''. This was mostly due to the fact that they were in the same subgroup of ceratopsians and had lived in the same fossil formations, though ''Torosaurus'' was more common in the south and ''Triceratops'' being more common in the north. However, a study by Yale University published in [[2012]] proved that they are distinct species.
*In the Hell Creek Formation, a specimen of ''Triceratops'' preserved with skin impressions indicates that it may have been covered with quills or bristles in addition to scales. A similar type of pelage was found on [[wikipedia:Psittacosaurus|Psittacosaurus]], a distant relative. 
*Triceratops was supposed to be on Disney Dinosaur as it was seen in the concept art but was cut including its cousin, Pentaceratops.
*Two triceratops named Sam and Will were supposed to be seen in ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'' as they were seen in the toy sales, but both were cut from the film.
