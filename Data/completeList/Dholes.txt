The '''Dholes''' are minor antagonists in the ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'' TV series, and were the main antagonists in their only appearance, "[[Red Dogs (episode)|Red Dogs]]". They are notorious pack of dholes who, according to [[Bagheera]], are marauders that almost destroyed the jungle, where the cubs lived, the last time they came.

==Role in [[Jungle Cubs|the series]]==
In the series, an episode featured the cubs driving the dholes out of the jungle by themselves; with the dogs attempting to attack [[Shere Khan|Khan]] in the temple where the cubs hung out. Bagheera, [[Kaa]], [[Colonel Hathi|Hathi]] and [[King Louie|Louie]] lured the dholes into a chase, each one hiding after a certain distance to allow another to take over, culminating in [[Baloo]] tricking them into falling into a gorge filled with bees.

==Trivia==
*Like the cubs (excluding Louie), the wolves and [[Mowgli]], the Dholes are characters adapted from the original novel.
**The Dholes are also the ones who kill Akela in ''The Second Jungle Book''.
*The Dholes resemble the original design of [[Tabaqui]] and also [[Don Karnage]]. Ironically, both them and their pack leader are both voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].
