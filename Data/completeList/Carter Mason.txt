'''Carter Mason''' is one the main protagonists of [[Disney Channel Original Movies|Disney Channel's Original Movie]] ''[[Princess Protection Program]]''.
==Biography==
Carter Mason is the daughter of Major Joe Mason, an agent of Princess Protection Program. She is an insecure and tomboyish girl who works at the local bait shop her dad owns. 

== Film Appearance ==
Princess Rosalinda  is about to be crowned queen of the small kingdom of [[Costa Luna]]. General Kane, the dictator of neighbouring country Costa Estrella, infiltrates her palace with his agents during her coronation rehearsal, and attempts to capture the royal family and take over the country. Carter's father, Major Mason, whisks her away to safety via helicopter.

The Princess Protection Program hides Rosalinda in The Masonsâ€™s home in [[Louisiana]], where she has to pretend to be Carter's cousin from Iowa named Rosie Gonzalez. Though Carter initially treats Rosie with annoyance and barely-masked hostility, she warms up to her after Rosie explains her situation, and the two become close friends. Carter teaches Rosalinda to act like a normal girl and Rosie shows Carter how to disarm those that scorn them by behaving as a princess. The two are nominated for the homecoming queen, which makes Carter's rival, Chelsea, jealous.

In an attempt to trick Rosie into exposing her location, General Kane announces plans to forcibly marry Rosie's mother, Queen Sophia. Rosie is distraught and tells Carter that she has decided to secretly return home. Knowing Costa Luna is still too dangerous, Carter secretly devises a plan to pose as Rosie and then use herself as bait to lure Kane into capture. Mr. Elegante, Rosie's royal dress designer, tells Kane that Rosie will be attending the homecoming dance and will be wearing a blue dress that he actually sends to Carter. In the meantime, Rosie agrees to help Carter behave like a princess by helping a group of girls dress up for the dance; The girls all wear masks, which helps Carter disguise herself as Rosie.

According to plan, Kane and his agents mistake Carter for Rosie and lead her to Kane's helicopter the night of the dance. However, Rosie narrowly discovers and ruins the plan by exposing herself to Kane, insisting that this is not Carter's fight. Fortunately, agents of the Princess Protection Program, including Mr. Mason, have been waiting inside the helicopter and rescue both girls. The PPP agents quickly apprehend Kane and his henchmen and turn them over to the international authorities.

At the end, Carter realizes what "a jerk" Donnie is and goes to the dance with Ed, her best friend who has had a crush on her for a long time. Rosie is crowned Queen of Costa Luna with Carter, Major Mason, Ed, Queen Sophia, and Mr. Elegante in attendance.
