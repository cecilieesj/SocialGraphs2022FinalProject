{{Quote|Andrea Davenport. Social influencer, future disrupter, Brighton Middle School's official goodwill ambassador.|Andrea introducing herself to [[Molly McGee]]|First Day Frights}}
'''Andrea Davenport''' is a minor character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. Her family owns a department store chain. 

==Background==
===Personality and traits===
Andrea is a top student at [[Molly McGee|Molly]]'s school, who is highly respected among her teachers and fellow students. She is very egotistical, and somewhat snotty and crude, but still remotely nice when it comes to newcomers. She despises anyone who mispronounces her name ("Ann-drea" instead of "Ahn-drea"), even if it is accidental, to the point of having the offenders mistreated and outcasted. Most of the school appears to be afraid of her, even the teachers.

She takes immense pride in her family's department store business, and always seizes any chance to boastfully promote it through social media, filming and even in the school's talent show.

Nonetheless, it is later revealed in "[[The Don't-Gooder]]" that Andrea is deep down extremely lonely, due to her father prioritizing money above her emotional needs and subsequently neglecting her. She, in fact, can be quite happy when he gives her the attention she needs.

In "[[Home is Where the Haunt Is]]", she can be very sympathetic as well, such as convincing the rest of Brighton citizens to donate their money to rent the house back to the McGees.

===Physical appearance===
Andrea is a young, fair-skinned girl of medium height with waist-length, blonde hair which she dyed her hair light blue and fades to periwinkle, and has one blue streak, freckles under her eyes, brown eyebrows, and light brown eyes. She wears purple eyeshadow and has freckles under her eyes. Her attire consists a bright pink hoodie with white strings, a purple skirt held with a pink belt, maroon leggings, and white whine-heeled boots with slate gray soles.

==Trivia==

*Andrea's surname is taken from Davenport, [[Iowa]], which is where producer Britta Reitman grew up.<ref>https://twitter.com/InevitablyBill/status/1444794908250976261</ref>
*Early art development indicated that Andrea would wear green and have blond hair. Her appearance implied that she was more of a stern and snooty student body type of character, before becoming an influencer.
