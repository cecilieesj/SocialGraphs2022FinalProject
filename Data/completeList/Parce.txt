'''Parce''' is a jaguar who is the companion of [[Antonio Madrigal]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s 60th animated feature film ''[[Encanto]]''.

==Background==
Parce is Antonio's pet jaguar. Like the rest of Antonio's animals, Parce does not speak; in spite of not being able to speak, he is able to communicate with Antonio along with the other animals Antonio has.

== Appearances ==
=== ''[[Encanto]]'' ===
When [[Antonio Madrigal|Antonio]] receives his gift at the [[Casa Madrigal]] as announced by [[Alma Madrigal|Abuela Alma]], Parce passes through the tapirs, capybaras, coatis, and toucans just as he picks up Antonio who rides on his back across his new rainforest-themed room. He deploys Antonio into a hammock with three coatis on it, followed by Antonio swinging on a boa constrictor and landing on Parce's back again as he enjoys his new gift.

Later when [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]] is discussing with [[Bruno Madrigal|Bruno]] privately in a nearby room about what will happen to the Casa Madrigal's fate while trying to find a big open space, Antonio tells Bruno to go to his room so he can have a vision, explaining that the rats told him about their situation just as the child tells Parce not eat the rats, much to the jaguar's dismay. Later, as the Casa Madrigal is being destroyed, Parce and the rest of Antonio's animals evacuate with their owner just as the Casa Madrigal suddenly collapses (also causing Antonio to lose his gift).

During the end of the film, when the Casa Madrigal is rebuilt, Parce and the rest of animals return to rejoice with Antonio's gift back at the Casa Madrigal as Antonio happily rides on him. Later, when one of Bruno's rats is preparing for a family picture, Antonio hangs on to his pet jaguar just before the rat takes a family photo at the newly-built Casa Madrigal which is later displayed on a wall.

==Trivia==
*In real life, it's illegal to keep jaguars as pets as it's considered illegal trafficking as part of wildlife trade.
*Parce is erroneously identified as a "leopard" in the English closed captions for the film. In real life, while jaguars and leopards are quite similar in appearance, they are two different species from different continents. Jaguars (''Panthera '''onca''''') are bulkier in appearance and are the only members of Panthera still found in North and South America. Their fur patterns consist of large rosettes with spots inside them. Leopards (''Panthera '''pardus''''') are leaner in appearance than jaguars, have smaller and more numerous spots, and are found in Africa and Asia.
*In [[Disney Emoji Blitz]], the asset for [[Proxima]] is reused for Parce.
