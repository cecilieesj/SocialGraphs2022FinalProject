}}'''Sootinai''' is a smoke spiritÂ who appeared in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' TV series]] episode "[[The Vapor Chase]]".

==Role in the episode==
Sootinai was originally composed of smaller smoke spirits. When all of the spirits merged into one, they became Sootinai. Sootinai can absorb the smoke from fires, making him himself larger and more powerful. His name derives from the phrase "Soot in Eye".

He was originally summoned by [[Abis Mal]]. After his defeat, [[Haroud Hazi Bin|Haroud]] brought the wet ashes which remained back to his master, who hoped to sell them for quick cash. Sootinai emerged from the sopping mess and scared the two away. It is then revealed to be [[Genie]] playing a prank.
