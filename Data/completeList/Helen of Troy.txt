|alignment = Good}}'''Helen of Troy''' is a recurring character on the Disney animated series, ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules]]''. She is a popular girl at [[Prometheus Academy]] and the girlfriend of [[Adonis]], though she is very close friends to [[Hercules]] and generally a very kind person. 

==Personality==
Helen of Troy is a very sweet if not generally vain character. She is a popular girl and is aware of her own popularity but does not hesitate to help others. She is very beautiful and sweet toward everyone, popular and unpopular (Cassandra, Icarus, and Hercules). While Helen's very beautiful, she doesn't appear to be that intelligent, though she's certainly much smarter than Adonis (as shown in "Song of Circe").

==Trivia==
* In the episode "[[Hercules and the Son of Poseidon]]", Helen dresses as a mermaid for the Homecoming parade, a nod to Jodi Benson's role as [[Ariel]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.
* Unlike her mythological counterpart, this version of Helen of Troy is not the mortal daughter of Zeus and half-sister of Hercules.
* In the original Greek mythology, Helen was the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. Depending on the telling, she is either kidnapped or whisked away by Paris of Troy, which inevitably led to the Trojan War.
