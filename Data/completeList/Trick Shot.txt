==Appearances==
===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===
He is a master archer, and can take out targets with much ease. Originally, Trick Shot was Clint Barton. Ever since he left the circus, a new Trick Shot has taken his place. He and [[Hawkeye]] battled it out in combat in the episode "Crime and Circuses". Hawkeye was able to overpower him, and took his costume to fool the Ring Master and Princess Python.

==Trivia==
*In the comics, there have been two archers known as Trick Shot. The first of which was '''Buck Chislom''', who was part of the Circus Hawkeye grew up in and mentored Hawkeye into mastering the bow and arrow, he eventually developed cancer and became a supervillain, though aided Hawkeye in a number of scenarios. The second was Clint's brother, '''Barney Barton''', who was trained under Buck in a revenge plot by [[Baron Zemo]] after he was seemingly killed.
