'''Estelle Dabney''', better known as "'''Mrs. Dabney'''", is the Duncans' grouchy neighbor in the sitcomand the main antagonist/anti-hero on  ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]''. She and Gabe play tricks on each other a lot, as seen in several episodes. She is played by Patricia Belcher

== Relationships ==

=== Gabe Duncan ===
Mrs. Dabney seems to have a very hateful relationship with Gabe, often insulting each other. However, they sometimes seem to be joking with each other. When Mrs. Dabney set a trap on Gabe, Gabe was mad at first, but then said, "Well played, Mrs. Dabney. Until next year." (Scary Had a Little Lamb)

=== Teddy Duncan ===
Out of all the Duncans, Mrs. Dabney has the best relationship with Teddy. Mrs. Dabney also refers to her as the "least disturbing" of all the Duncan kids.

=== PJ Duncan ===
Mrs. Dabney does not like '''PJ''' much. As the series progresses, she begins to like him more than she used to because she learns he rarely causes her annoyance. The two shared interests as shown in "''The Tears of Tomorrow'"'' when they became obsessed with an old show which soon canceled, and they also ice skate together one time.

=== Bob Duncan ===
Mrs. Dabney has a decent relationship with Bob. In The Curious Case of Mr. Dabney, she asked him to rid her house of the smell of a dead possum since he is an exterminator. They also found out that they both love "Higgins & Zork" in the episode Charlie Shakes It Up!.

=== Charlie Duncan ===
We don't see these two interact much throughout the series. Sometimes, Charlie is seen in the Dabney household playing with Mrs. Dabney. In the episode "Teddy and the Bambino", Charlie and Mrs. Dabney are seen playing Charlie's game, "Puppy Town". It seems that they have a good relationship just like her and Teddy.

=== Mr. Dabney ===
In The Curious Case of Mr. Dabney, Mrs. Dabney hinted that she didn't like her husband very much. In It's a Charlie Duncan Thanksgiving it is revealed that they're divorced.

=== Amy Duncan ===
Their relationship is not a really close relationship but it is mentioned in a few episodes. In Rat-A-Teddy they worked together to get revenge on the kids and there they became friends.
