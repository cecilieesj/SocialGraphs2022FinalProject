'''The King''' is an unnamed king of a mythical kingdom that was being constantly attacked by a selfish and brutal giant called [[Gustav the Giant|Gustav]]. With no idea of what to do, the King hires an alleged giant slayer ([[Mickey Mouse]]) to stop the gigantic villain.

The character made his debut in the animated short, "[[Brave Little Tailor]]". He also makes a cameo in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode "[[Roll 'em]]" as an actor.
