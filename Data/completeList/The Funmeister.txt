=== Background ===
The Funmeister is a sort of supernatural being comparable to a spirit or deity.  He is a moon faced spirit whose name comes from rough Germanic languages.  The Funmeister embodied festivity, the celebration of life and the sharing of laughter.

The Funmeister's origins go back to having been worshiped by barbarian tribes following the collapse of Rome.  The Funmeister was worshiped in [[Florida]] by the indigenous Seminole tribe who lived on the island that would become Pleasure Island in [[Lake Buena Vista]].

While in Mexico around the year [[1900]], wealthy adventurer [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]] began having visions of the Funmeister.  The visions guided Merriweather to Pleasure Island in [[1911]] where he found a totem of the Funmeister as left behind by a ghostly Seminole tribe.  Due to being seen as a representative of the Funmeister, the spirits of the tribe allowed for Merriweather to purchase and settle on the island with him coming to hold the moniker of, "Grand Funmeister" and throwing parties nightly as tribute to the spirit.
