'''Mr. Burgermeister''' is a character from [[Tim Burton]]'s [[2012]] film ''[[Frankenweenie]]''. He is the mayor of [[New Holland]], and uncle of [[Elsa Van Helsing]].

==Background==
Mr. Burgemeister is the Frankenstein’s next-door neighbor and Mayor of New Holland. A crotchety fuss-bucket, he is fanatical about his garden and can’t stand [[Sparky (Frankenweenie)|Sparky]] or anything else that threatens the perfection of his tulips. Mr. Burgemeister also asserts his authority over his niece [[Elsa Van Helsing|Elsa]] by making her the reluctant star of his New Holland Dutch Day celebration.

==Trivia==

*His face looks very reminiscent of Finis Everglot from ''[[Wikipedia:Corpse Bride|Corpse Bride]]'', a previous stop-motion picture hit co-directed by Tim Burton. However, Mr. Burgermeister is taller than Finis and not as mean.
*He did put his arm around Elsa when she was crying, showing that he does care for her, despite being so strict.
*The mayor was named after and crafted to resemble Burgermeister Meisterburger, the fun-hating mayor of Somber Town from the Rankin/Bass stop motion film, ''[[Wikipedia:Santa Claus is Coming to Town|Santa Claus is Coming to Town]]''.
*His first name is revealed to be Bob as Elsa says "Yes, uncle Bob."
* Burgermeister shows the same disliking [[Victor Frankenstein]], like the way Finis Everglot shows his dislike for Victor Van Dort.
*His role as Elsa Van Helsing's uncle is a wordplay on a [[wikipedia:Dutch uncle|Dutch uncle]], someone who issues frank, harsh, or severe comments and criticism in order to educate, encourage, or admonish someone. He sternly insists that his niece Elsa is going to be the star performer at the New Holland Dutch Day celebration.
*Burgermeister is derived from the word meaning "Mayor" in German.
