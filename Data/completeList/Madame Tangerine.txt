'''Madame Tangerine''' is cast-member given name for a character in [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|The Haunted Mansion]].

==History==
Madame Tangerine is one of the ghosts inhabiting the Haunted Mansion. While her personal origins are unknown, it is known that she died and moved in prior to the year [[1936]] as she was documented by the Johnson Family which owned the estate at the time.

==Appearances==

===The Haunted Mansion===
Madame Tangerine appears in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom where she sits at the dining-room table across from Great Caesar's Ghost. She is seen phasing in and out of sight, blowing out 13 candles on a cake.

====[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]====
Madame Tangerine and Great Caesar's Ghost are the only dining-room table ghosts who are constants during the seasonal Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay. Here ,she typically interacts with a macabre gingerbread display replacing her cake.

===[[Camp Discovery]]===
Tangerine is mentioned in [[Shanghai Disneyland]]'s Camp Discovery on [[Adventure Isle]]. The paper mentions her as having ruined the 29th birthday party of Eunice Johnson who was one of the owners of the Haunted Mansion in the 1930s. Specifically, she is said to have blown out her birthday candles after Eunice failed to do so.

==Other appearances==

===Printed media===

====The Ghost Gallery====
In the non-cannon but influential Ghost Gallery backstory created by cast-members of [[Walt Disney World]], Madame Tangerine was given her moniker along with the alternate identity of '''Victoria Abigail Boufont'''. In this story, she is identified as being the great-aunt of [[Master Gracey]], who got her nickname from her mop of orange hair and was known for throwing parties and events in the ballroom of Gracey Manor. One Halloween party in particular had her decorating the manor's graveyard with halloween props including an authentic Egyptian mummy only for her guests to die of tea tainted by [[Hitchhiking Ghosts|corpse]]-matter from a nearby well.

These parties lead to her being hated by [[Madame Leota]] who decided to curse Mme. Tangerine to die in 13 years from that day. Contrary to Leota's intention this only resulted in Boufont throwing grand parties and scavenger-hunts to celebrate Leota's cursing of her to die in 13 years. After these thirteen parties, Abigail passed away with a smile on her lips and left behind the 13-candled cake in the ballroom as a celebration of this.

====[[Disney Kingdoms]]====
She makes brief appearances in Disney Kingdoms: Haunted Mansion comics within the ballroom where she was trapped by [[Captain Gore|the Captain]] along with several other ghosts. In this comic, she vocally disagrees with [[Pickwick]] celebrating with the mortal [[Danny Crowe]] despite Pickwick intending on turning him into a ghost.

==Trivia==
*In official blueprints for the attraction, she is labelled as, "'''The Ghostess'''" which is a moniker now affiliated with the character of [[Little Leota]].
*Tangerine shares her face mould with one of the Phantom Five minstrels in the graveyard and also some [[The Crew of the Wicked Wench|crew-members]] of the [[Wicked Wench]] from Pirates of the Caribbean.
