[[File:Kiera.jpg|thumb]]'''Keira''' is a kangaroo who appears in the ''[[T.O.T.S.]]'' episode "[[The Bouncy Bouncy Baby]]." She bounces a lot, causing a bumpy flight for [[Pip (T.O.T.S.)|Pip]] and [[Freddy (T.O.T.S.)|Freddy]], though the former was locked in the crate with her to keep her entertained.

==Appearance==
Keira is a light tan colored Kangaroo with blue eyes. She wears a magenta colored bow, collar with T.O.T.S. symbol, and a diaper with magenta trims and cactus patterns on it.

==Trivia==
*While not being all that interested in Pip's kangaroo facts, she ends up becoming friends with him after he makes her laugh during the "Get Silly" song number and they share a bounce together after he and Freddy deliver her, showing that she does like him.
*She is voiced by Charlie Townsend, who also voiced Mia the Kitten, Octavia the Octopus, and Camille the Camel.
