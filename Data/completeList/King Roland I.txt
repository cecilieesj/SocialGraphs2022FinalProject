'''King Roland I''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Junior]] animated series'' [[Sofia the First]]''. He was the previous King of [[Enchancia]] and the father of [[King Roland II]] and [[Aunt Tilly|Duchess Matilda]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Roland I is shown to have a very strict and serious personality. He is also a firm believer in etiquette as shown when he tells his daughter, "This is not the kind of behavior we expect from our future Queen!" He is also willing to bend rules for the sake of Enchancia, as shown when he gave his crown to his son instead of his daughter.

===Physical Appearance===
He looks a lot like his son as a grown-up. He has brown hair tied up in a ponytail, green eyes, and fair skin.

==Role in the Series==
King Roland is mentioned many times throughout the series. According to Cedric and Goodwyn, Goodwyn the Great saved his life nine and a half times, one of which was from a kraken. He is considered to be one of the best kings Enchancia has every had, and his son holds him in high esteem and feels like he lives in his shadow. However, Roland I put heroics above his family life, which brought Roland II to be a better father than his own father was.

He finally makes his debut appearance in "[[Through the Looking Back Glass]]". He first appears when Sofia and Calista use the latter's Looking Back Glass to find out about the incident at Cordelia's Sorceress Ball that broke the relationship between Cordelia and her younger brother Cedric. He reveals that he was originally going to pass his crown down to his daughter Tilly. However, when Tilly abdicated her role as heir to her brother, he and his wife knew he would be a great King as it was their son's dream.
