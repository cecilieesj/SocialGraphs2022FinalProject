'''Christine''' is a rabbit-friend of [[Ojo|Ojo's]] on ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''. She doesn't normally stay at [[The Big Blue House|the Big Blue House]], but sometimes visits to play. Although Christine is never heard speaking on the show, it's never been said that she can't.

Christine is first seen in "[[Friends for Life (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Friends for Life]]." Ojo notices that she hangs around the [[Otter Pond]], but is shy and runs away when anyone approaches her. She gets some carrots from [[Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House)|Bear's]] refrigerator and pretty soon, they're friends. In this episode, Christine is known only as "rabbit" --- her name is not given until later in the series.
