==Role in the film==
Flash is a German Shepherd actor who stars in a TV show (called ''Flash the Wonder Dog''), in which he plays a heroic dog who fights crime along with his bird sidekick, [[Conrad Cockatoo]]. Dale is shown to have a certain admiration for his show due to its fast-paced action and believes Flash to be a real hero, much to Chip's dismay. In contrast to the role he played, the real Flash was very afraid of heights and had a stunt dog named Sam do some of the heroic stunts in some scenes for him. He was dognapped by [[Fat Cat]], who didn't like the fact that the hero and star of the show was a dog. Though Flash escaped with the help of the Rescue Rangers, Fat Cat and his gang framed him for several crimes and the Rescue Rangers knew Flash couldn't have committed those crimes because he was locked up. Once the "real" Flash revealed his true colors to his number one fan, Dale shuns him. Seeing that Flash escaped and his sidekick, Conrad was going to be the new star in the new TV show, ''Conrad the Wonder Bird'', Fat Cat came up with another plan on how to get rid of the bird using his Flash disguise "again" as another way of framing him. The plan was simple: use his disguise to viciously attack Conrad for the entire nation to see! However, with the help of the Rescue Rangers, Flash not only cleared his name, but he overcame his fear of heights, saved Conrad, and looked like a real hero to everyone. He was awarded honorary membership in the Rescue Rangers while Chip and Dale were awarded honorary "wonder dogs" (unnoticeably at first).

==Trivia==
*Flash is very similar to [[Thunderbolt]] from the ''[[One Hundred and One|101 Dalmatians]]'' franchise, as both are famous heroic dogs who don't do their own stunts, both are German Shepherds, both are the stars of their very own shows, and both are idolized by another animal character ([[Chip and Dale|Dale]] for Flash; [[Patch]]/[[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]] for Thunderbolt). The only difference is that while Flash is afraid of heights, Thunderbolt has no fear of high places.
*His summoning cry is: "Ya-da-da-da-daaaaa!", the first few notes of "{{WikipediaLink|Ride of the Valkyries}}".
