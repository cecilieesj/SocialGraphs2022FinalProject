'''Professor Elliot Randolph''' is a professor specializing in Norse mythology.

==Appearances==
===''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''===
Elliot was a freemason at [[Asgard]] who worked for centuries until he hid the [[Berserker Staff]] in three areas around Midgard. He became a human professor for the rest of his life. Eventually, a group of young paganists found one of the parts of the staff, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sought him as a consultant. Randolph later explained to them who he was really are after Agent [[Grant Ward]] saw him trying to gather the three parts of staff. Randolph led Coulson's team to the church in Ireland where the final piece was hidden, explaining to them how the monks of the church had kept a vow of silence to protect his secret. Here, he was ambushed by the paganist group leader Jakob Nystrom who stabbed him with the Staff. Despite this, Randolph managed to survive after Coulson and his team defeated Nystrom and his group. After what happened, Coulson recommended him to move to Portland, Oregon.
