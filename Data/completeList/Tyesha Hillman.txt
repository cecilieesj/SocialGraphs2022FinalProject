While Tyesha doesn't appear in the [[Generation Why|first episode]], she is mentioned when [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] tells his family that he is going over to hers, later on in the evening, and they ask that he give their greetings to her [[Mr. and Mrs. Hillman|parents]].

Tyesha first appears in the [[Crushed (Ms. Marvel)|second episode]]. She and Aamir go to an Indian restaurant and run into Aamir's younger sister, [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], who is there with an unknown boy. Kamala greets the pair, and refers to her friend, [[Kamran]], as their cousin. Tyesha looks unconvinced at this, but Aamir buys into Kamala's claim. Tyesha gives her welcomes, while shooting Kamala a sly look at the same time, aware she is fabricating a story. She doesn't say anything, and scurries off Aamir elsewhere.

Tyesha later attends a dinner with the Khans, and they discuss Aamir's past, working at Hot Topic and learning he had a goth phase, which she and the others all laugh to. Tyesha questions how long their family lived in Karachi, and [[Yusuf Khan|Yusuf]] states how his family had been there for generations, while [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]]'s moved, after the Partition of India. They inform Tyesha of how the British left the colonies in shambles, and a civil war broke out. Aamir adds that every Pakistani family has a Partition story, none of which are good. Muneeba wants to change the topic, and reminds them they're there to celebrate, as she clears the dishes off the table. When Muneeba heads to the kitchen, Yusuf recounts the story of how Muneeba's family had to get onto the last train that was getting out of the city, but her mother, [[Sana Ali|Sana]], who just a toddler, got lost. When the train took off, Sana was miraculously onboard, and claimed to have followed a trail of stars, back to [[Hasan|her father]]. When Tyesha inquires about [[Aisha|Sana's mother]], Yusuf reveals she was among those who disappeared during the partition. Following their conversation, Kamala faints at the table, and Tyesha and the others gather around her, until she comes to.

Tyesha arrives to the Khan House on Eid, dressed in festive attire, where she is greeted by Aamir and Yusuf. Aamir questions how she'd feel if their first dance was to "Livin' On A Prayer". She expresses how it's better than "You Give Love A Bad Name", which excited Yusuf as he is a fan of Bon Jovi.

Tyesha and the family all attend the Eid Al-Adha festival, held by the local mosque, and expresses her admiration for the setup. She comes across a friend, and greets her.

The day of the Mehndi party arrives, and is hosted at the Khan's house. While Tyesha is getting her henna done, she looks at the vast amount of guests in attendance, and asks Kamala if they're all her family. Kamala comments that they're Pakistani, and roll pretty deep, humoring Tyesha.

On the day of her wedding, Tyesha sits amongst her parents and in-laws, as she and Aamir are married by [[Sheikh Abdullah]]. a party is held at venue. Aamir and his family take part in celebrations. She watches as her families participates in a dance, and joins them in the end. Following this, the fire alarm is triggered, and the partygoers are forced to exit the building. Outside, Tyesha stands by a distraught bride and congratulates her, complimenting her on her look, which the sobbing bride returns.

Tyesha and the family wait outside, for Kamala, but are unable to locate her. [[Damage Control]] storm the building, and arrest a [[Clandestines|group]], that Kamala was seen with, during the wedding. They eventually return to home, where Kamala joins them, much later, but she is unable to provide any answers.
