[[File:Akela_Amador.png|thumb|250px]]'''Akela Amador''' is a minor character from ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' She was originally a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent trained by [[Phil Coulson|Coulson]], but after a mission, she disappeared. Eventually, she goes blind in her right eye. After being "rescued" by an [[Centipede Project|unknown agency]], she receives sight back in her eye by means of a mechanical prosthetic known as the Backscatter X-Ray Eye Implant.

Someone begins telling her to commit crimes, and threatens to throw the kill switch if she does not. [[Leo Fitz|Fitz]]-[[Jemma Simmons|Simmons]] try to safely remove the kill switch, but must take out the whole prosthesis before it detonates.
