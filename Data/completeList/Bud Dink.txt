Mr. Dink always has a number of high-tech gadgets that were "very expensive" and speaks with a lisp. He is also claimed to be a writer in the first episode. Since he buys tons of expensive gizmos, it's safe to assume he has a lot of money. Doug frequently goes to Mr. Dink for advice, but his advice usually ends up making the situation worse. He always refers to Doug as "Douglas", and likewise says the real names when addressing the other kids as well.

==Trivia==
*The Dink in Mr. Dink's name stands for ''Double Income No Kids'', which would explain his ability to produce such "very expensive" purchases.
*It is revealed in Doug's Dental Disaster that Mr. Dink has a set of false teeth, which he's had for almost 12 years. He attributes this to the fact he used to drink a lot of chocolate shakes.
