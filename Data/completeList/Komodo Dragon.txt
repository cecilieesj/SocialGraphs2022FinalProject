'''Komodo Dragon''' is a minor character in the third season of ''[[The Lion Guard]]''. He is the only other Komodo dragon (hence his name) other than [[Ora]] that is able to speak.

==Background==
===Personality===
Komodo Dragon is always loyal towards his leader Ora. He's always wiling to take chances like when he came back for Lumba-Lumba to eat her. He is intelligent compared to other lackeys of villainous leaders and is really confident.

===Physical Appearance===
Komodo Dragon has green skin, his back and his head are dark green, his lower belly and tail are light green, his feet and stripes of his tail are brown. His eyes are yellow and black, his lower teeth at his upper mouth and his mouth always has saliva escaping, much like Ora and his friend.

== Role in the series ==
===''[[Dragon Island]]''===
As the [[Lion Guard]] arrives to the other side of Dragon Island to find the next [[Moja Kwa Moja Stone]], Komodo Dragon, his leader Ora, and his other fellow follower approach Kion's team thinking they are intruders. Just as Ora and the other Komodo dragons prepare to fight, Kion uses the [[Roar of the Elders]] to clear them away; the Roar not only blasts away the Komodo dragons, but also decimates the water surrounding the island due to Kion not controlling the Roar properly.

In a plan to bring [[Lumba-Lumba]] back to the ocean, he is shown to have survived Kion's Roar with Ora alongside his fellow henchman. Preparing to eat Lumba-Lumba, [[Anga]] notices the Komodo dragons preparing to eat her. Fortunately, Anga, [[Makini]], and [[Ono]] arrive at the spot where Lumba-Lumba is stranded at just as Kion and his team work together to bring Lumba-Lumba back to the ocean and defeat the Komodo dragons. As the group follows the path to the next landmark marked by the Moja Kwa Moja Stone, Ora and his group are caught in the ocean wave. However, Ora is shown to have survived just as he accepts to join [[Makucha's Army]] to take revenge against Kion (this time without his fellow Komodo dragons).

===''[[Triumph of the Roar]]''===
Komodo Dragon is shown to have survived his encounter with the Lion Guard just as he gives reinforcements to Makucha's Army to take over the [[Tree of Life (The Lion Guard)|Tree of Life]] in a final showdown. He and the rest of the army stampede across the Tree and start attacking the victims inside. Fortunately, Kion created a tornado using the Roar to defeat all the members of Makucha's Army in order to keep the Tree of Life safe from predators.

==Relationships==
===Friends===
===[[Ora]] and his bank===
This lizard is good friends with Ora. Whenever his master Ora leads the other two Komodo dragons, he and his fellow henchman follow wherever Ora lead them to. He started working together since his first encounter with the Lion Guard. Despite his defeat, he is still good friends with his leader and his other fellow henchman.

=== [[Makucha]], [[Chuluun]], [[Mama Binturong (character)|Mama Binturong]], and the rest of Makucha's Army ===
Komodo Dragon joined forces with Makucha's Army to add reinforcements to take over the Tree of Life and eat the rare animals.

=== Enemies ===

=== [[Kion]], [[Bunga]], [[Beshte]], [[Ono]], [[Anga]] ===
Komodo Dragon is enemies with the Lion Guard since this group interfered with his plans to eat animals which breaks the Circle of Life.

=== [[Heng Heng]] ===
