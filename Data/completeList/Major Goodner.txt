Major Goodner is an Air Force Major, and was an associate of the late [[Maria Rambeau]], who also served in the organisation. Monica attempts to find a way back into [[Westview]], through the Hex and contacts Major Goodner, giving her updates her on what they need, to enter the barrier, blocking the town. Major Goodner and a team set up, outside the Hex, and she greets Monica, and her colleague, [[Jimmy Woo]], when they arrive. Monica thanks her for coming, and tells her, that Maria would appreciate their loyalty, and Goodner replies that Maria isn't the only one they're loyal to. She showcases Monica the space rover, they brought her, that will help her reenter Westview. While Monica gets ready, Goodner tells them they're set. Woo questions how much faith she has in the vehicle, and she informs him its their most heavily armored space rover, and Monica will sail through unharmed. Monica enters the vehicle and drives towards the Hex. Half of the rover passes through, but upon making contact, it struggles to move forward, and Goodner finds that that density is matching her. Monica exits the rover, and Goodner, Woo and the team run towards her, but the space rover is thrown back in their direction, with the half that contacted the Hex, transformed into a van. Goodner then witnesses Monica run into the Hex, without any protection.
