==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Miss Fritter loves the smash-and-crash life of demolition derby. A local legend at the Thunder Hollow Speedway, Fritter's formidable school-bus-size is intimidating, but it's her smoke stacks of doom, razor-sharp stop sign and crazy collection of her victims' license plates that usually steers her opponents in the other direction.''<ref>{{cite web|author=Samad Rizvi |url=http://pixartimes.com/2017/03/09/cars-3-cast-adds-nathan-fillion-kerry-washington-and-lea-delaria/ |title='Cars 3' Cast Adds Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington, and Lea Delaria |publisher=Pixartimes.com |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}</ref>
