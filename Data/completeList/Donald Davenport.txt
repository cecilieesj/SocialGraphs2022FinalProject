==Background==
He is a scientist and inventor that gave chips to Adam, Bree, and Chase, giving them bionic abilities and turning them into superhumans. He actually tried to hide the Lab Rats from Leo and Tasha, but failed to do so, when Leo accidentally found the lair.

==Personality==
He can be full of himself, sometimes boasting about himself. He often doesn't see that Adam, Bree, and Chase just want to be normal teenagers sometimes. He can also be childish and stubborn at times, but he can be very caring and helpful when others are in need of help.
