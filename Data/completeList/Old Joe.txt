==Role in the [[A Christmas Carol|film]]==
During [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]'s future, his former maid is seen selling his clothing to a fence named Old Joe. During this, Mrs. Dilber and Old Joe share some banter about a mysterious death on Christmas Day and that they would somehow profit from this death. Scrooge, now noticing all of his stolen goods, yells to his former maid that she is fired, but because [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come]] shrank him earlier, she can't hear or see him. But then Old Joe swings a fire poker in Scrooge's direction. Actually, Old Joe is aiming at a rat standing next to Scrooge. This starts a three-way chase between Old Joe, the rat, and Scrooge.
