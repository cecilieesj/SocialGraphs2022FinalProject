'''Bobbi Fabulous'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0352294/?ref_=tt_cl_t13</ref> is a recurring character in the animated series of [[Phineas and Ferb|''Phineas and Ferb'']]. He was the bass guitar player for the band known as [[Love Handel|Love H채ndel]], which was and still is a famous band in [[Danville]]. After the band broke up, he worked at a hair salon which soon became his own Bobbi's Hair Emporium. [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda Flynn]] goes there to keep her hair looking as it always does. Before he opened his hair salon. After being approached by Linda's sons [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]], which included having him sing along with the song ''[[Fabulous]]'' to convince him he more than just part of the background, he reunited with [[Love Handel|Love H채ndel]] to perform a concert on [[Lawrence Fletcher]] and [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]]'s anniversary. On the soundtrack, his name is written "Bobby Fabulous".

Though he is very fashion-savvy and generally good natured, Bobbi can be extremely snobby, vain, and narcissistic, especially around people he considers "Slovenly," most notably Love H채ndel drummer [[Sherman (Phineas and Ferb)|Sherman]], occasionally pointing out his faults.

==Trivia==
*Bobbi's hair (which is fake) is the same style as Linda's hair, only a different color. This is likely not a coincidence, because Linda gets her hair done at Bobbi's salon.
**In fact, nearly everyone who goes to his salon has his hairstyle, including the employees who also share his hair color in addition to style.
*When Bobbi tells Phineas to, "Talk to the hand." Bobbi's hand makes a statement that is a call-back for [[Norm]], "Secretly, I'm very lonely." ("[[w:c:phineasandferb:User:Felinoel/Swampy Marsh Correspondence#.22|Secretly, I'm very lonely]]")
*Bobbi, along with [[Danny (Phineas and Ferb)|Danny]] and [[Sherman (Phineas and Ferb)|Swampy]], are named after producers of the show, [[Dan Povenmire]], Bobby Gaylor, and especially, [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]].
*Bobbi may also be named after Alan "Mr. Fabulous" Rubin of the Blues Brothers.
*'''[[wikipedia:Yes (band)|Yes]]:''' He may be modeled on bass player [[wikipedia:Chris Squire|Chris Squire]], who is famous for his stylish costumes in concert.
*Bobbi is the one who seems to have changed the least since the 90's, the only differences being that when he is older, he has glasses and a soul patch.
*His clothing when not onstage consists of a black turtleneck and white jeans.
*Bobbi's voice for ''[[Just Passing Through (song)|Just Passing Through]]'' is radically different from his talking voice, sounding much more sung by [[Dan Povenmire]] ("[[Just Passing Through]]").
*He is the only [[Love Handel|Love H채ndel]] member to have a Tri-Stone Area version in "[[Tri-Stone Area]]".
