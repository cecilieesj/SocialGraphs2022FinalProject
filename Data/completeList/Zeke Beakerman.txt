'''Zachary Ezekiel "Zeke" Rosenblatt Beakerman'''Â is the best friend of Justin. Zeke is considered "cool", yet nerdy. He attends Tribeca Prep and is in advanced chemistry along with Justin. He is also part of an "alien language" club; he and Justin often speak "alien" to each other. Dan Benson, however, first appeared in "Movies," where his character's name was Zack Rosenblatt, but he was later re-cast as Zeke Beakerman.

==Background==
===Biography===
Zeke and Justin are also on the same Quiz Bowl team in "Smarty Pants". Zeke and Justin have tried out for several sports teams, but have apparently failed at all of them (including cross country and tennis), except Justin in the basketball team, and Zeke in cheerleading.

In "Fashion Week", they succeeded at talking to models, by playing their "nerd game". Zeke got the role of Peter Pan in Justin's school play in "Fairy Tale." In the episode "Wizard For A Day", he is upset when he realizes the real aliens do not understand his "alien speak". Zeke and Harper go to "Zombie Prom" together. As of Season 3, Zeke has been featured in episodes more often. In "Alex Saves Mason", he came close to finding out the Russo's secret, after witnessing Mason transform from a wolf to an in-between stage of human and wolf. In season 4, Zeke eventually finds out the Russo's are wizards.
