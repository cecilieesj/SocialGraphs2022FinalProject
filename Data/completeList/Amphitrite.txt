==Role in the [[Hercules (TV series)|series]]==
In the animated series, she has a small recurring role, often serving as the calming voice of reason to her husband, Poseidon.

In "[[Hercules and the Son of Poseidon]]", Poseidon introduces Hercules to his son [[Triton (Hercules)|Triton]], a sea prince who wants to go to Prometheus Academy with him. It turns out Triton is somewhat of a nerd, wanting to be like his cousin; he has considerable acrobatic skills but terrible balance and timing, much like Hercules himself, causing him to be a constant source of humiliation. Icarus and Cassandra remind Hercules that he and his cousin are not so different, so he tries to apologize. Unfortunately, overhearing what his cousin thought of him, Triton has stolen Poseidon's trident and accidentally unleashed a sea monster. The two cousins team up to defeat the monster, and Poseidon arrives to take back his trident, not punishing Triton thanks to Amphitrite intervening.

In "[[Hercules and the Poseidon's Cup Adventure]]", Poseidon, tired of being forgotten, holds a boating race in his honor, with Adonis competing for Thrace against Hercules and Icarus. However, when their star rower Hylas is injured, the King of Thrace hires Hercules instead, who abandons Icarus. Fortunately, she has taken a special interest in Icarus and helps him and his father Daedalus complete their boat. At the gala held the night before the race, Hercules declares himself bigger than Poseidon, which causes the sea god to unleash Charybdis, a giant maelstrom sea creature, during the race, which causes both his and Icarus' ships to nearly sink. Rescuing first his friend and then Adonis, Hercules looks on as Icarus wins the Poseidon Cup, being the only one to have truly earned it.
