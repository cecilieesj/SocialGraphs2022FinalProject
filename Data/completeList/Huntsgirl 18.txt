==Background==
She was a girl, who attended the Huntsclan Academy and took an interest in "Huntsboy 89", who was really [[Arthur Spudinski]] in disguise.

However another apprentice, Huntsgirl 23, also liked "89" and the two fought over him. They both were dates of Spud for a dance at the Academy which eventually led to a fight breaking out again between them after Huntsgirl 18 heard a rumor about 23 name-calling her<ref>[[The Academy]]</ref>.

It is unknown if Huntsgirl 18 was destroyed with the rest of the Huntsclan<ref>[[Homecoming]]</ref>. She might have escaped the fate if she had washed-out of the Academy or quit.
