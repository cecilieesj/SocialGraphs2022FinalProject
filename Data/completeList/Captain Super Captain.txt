'''Captain Super Captain''' is a superhero citizen from ''[[Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Captain Super Captain is the fundamental superhero: powerful, brave, and booming with a slight ego. Though he is overconfident with his superpowers, he does learn to acknowledge that his non-super talents can also make him a hero, thanks to Penn. He also appears to have a strong degree of care for allies and relatives whether they be mind-controlled or simply evil, as he often implores them to be good rather than directly fight them. Much to the irritation of everyone else, Captain Super Captain has a habit of taking time to announce his name in a bombastic manner.

==Trivia==
*It is revealed in "[[I'm Still Super!]]" that Captain Super Captain and his brother are Jewish.
*He is probably a good singer, as he sang at Giant Old Lady's son's wedding.
*His voice actor, Adam West, was famously known to portray DC character Batman from the 1960s to the 1980s.
*In "[[Save the Worlds]]", Captain Super Captain reveals that he is allergic to monkeys.
