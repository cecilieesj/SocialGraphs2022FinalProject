'''Prince Nevarhas Bin-Broak''' is the wealthy and whimsical ruler of a Middle Eastern kingdom and one of the chief characters in the ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode "[[I Only Have Ice for You]]".

==Background==
Surrounded by servants and attendants, Prince Nevarhas Bin-Broak fell heir to a multi-million shaboozie fortune, enabling him to fulfill his most outrageous desires. One of his greatest desires was to have his very own private ski slope. He requested [[Higher For Hire]] to deliver a giant iceberg to his kingdom and drop it off near the palace.

Nevarhas Bin-Broak also has his own harem, which is shown briefly with him during a cameo appearance in the episode "[[The Golden Sprocket of Friendship]]".
