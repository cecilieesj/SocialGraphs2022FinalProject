==Background==
===Personality===
Raja is a very lighthearted fellow. He is kind as shown when he warns Elena about King Hector being bossy. He is shown to be used to following Hector's lead to the point where it's hard to say no to him but this isn't so to the point where it makes him stupid as shown when he finally stands up to Hector. He also values his belongings as shown when he was angry that the baby Marposa rammed his ship. He is also shown that while he likes Hector's top of the line gifts he doesn't like Hector at all as shown when he tells Elena he's glad they don't have to listen to Hector anymore.

==Role in the Series==
King Raja makes his debut in "[[Royal Retreat]]".

He first appears when [[Elena Flores|Elena]] arrives at King Hector's Royal Retreat. Raja warns Elena that Hecter can be harsh and difficult. His warning comes true after [[King Hector]] shows up. Hector shows him this year's gift for them: A Sea Blaster, a ship he claims is indestructible. Suddenly, they see a Marposa ramming his ship. Hector orders an attack planned and Raja, angry that the Marposa attacked his ship, goes with him while Elena checks on her family. Later, Elena comes back and reveals the Marposa is just a baby looking for it's mother. Hector refuses to listen and tells the other Kings he won't give them the Sea Blasters he promised if they say they agree with her which makes Raja cave in. Hector later reveals he just wants the Marposa for his aquarium and captures the baby Marposa. This makes the mother Marposa attack the ship. When [[King Lars]] tells Hector they should let the baby go, Raja agrees with him telling him he doesn't need any more sea creatures for his aquarium but Hector once again threatens to not give them their own Sea Blasters if they don't do what he tells them. When Elena apprears, Raja does nothing to stop her and leaves with her and attend her Royal Retreat, glad that they don't have to listen to Hector anymore.

== Trivia ==
* the direct translation of the name is the English and the Sanskrit name for King/Prince.
