== Background ==
He is a world champion professional wrestler, boasting such descriptors as "the greatest wrestling talent in the world" and "the finest wrestler on the planet Earth." Local to [[Spoonerville]], he stars in the television program ''Wrestling for Dollars'', which is filmed at the Spoonerville Amphitheater<ref>This building was named such in the episode "[[Shake, Rattle & Goof]]".</ref> and broadcast across the country.<ref>''Wrestling for Dollars'' is mentioned in both the ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode "[[Down & Out in Duckburg]]" and in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode "[[Apes of Wrath]]", meaning that the program is broadcast outside of Spoonerville in both [[Duckburg]] and [[St. Canard]].</ref> He is also one of [[Goofy]]'s close friends, and runs a diner at which he works as its chef.

To keep his wrestling identity a secret, he lives a double life in which he uses his real name at the restaurant and wrestles as the Bulk. Between the two jobs, he prefers being a chef and longs to retire from wrestling to work at his diner full-time. However, he remains under strict contract to work for his wrestling manager, Sparky, until he is beaten fair and square in the ring by a challenging opponent.

He also bears a strong moral compass, refusing to take the easy path to retirement of simply throwing his matches and letting his opponents win, as doing so would not only violate his contract and lead to much unwanted scrutiny, but also, in his own words, "Wouldn't be right."

He is eventually able to finally quit the wrestling business when Goofy helps [[Pete]] defeat the Bulk in a fair match that sees Pete succeed the Bulk as the champion, which leads to Pete having to fight all of the Bulk's other opponents (being clobbered by them as a result) while the newly-retired Myron offers to cook Goofy anything he wants for dinner.

==Trivia==
* Both his real name and status as a wrestler are references to real life wrestler Hulk Hogan, while his wrestling name (like the title of the episode itself) is a reference to the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]]''.
