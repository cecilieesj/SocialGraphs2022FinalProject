Isabel lives in [[Westview]], and is married. In [[2023]], a short period after the Blip, Isabel's husband leaves for a business trip, when she becomes entrapped, as the town and everything within, is transformed, into a black and white, 1950s sitcom. She is assigned the new identity of Beverly. Under this new persona, Isabel is aware of everything that happens, but but has no control, and feels Wanda's pain. When she goes to sleep, she suffers from Wanda's nightmares. As Isabel, she is a member of a planning committee, hosted by [[Dottie Jones]].

She first appears in the [[Don't Touch That Dial|second episode]], which takes place in the 1960s. A meeting is held, and Beverly arrives, with a platter, alongside the other women of the neighborhood. When all the women have gathered together, Beverly outlines all the various tasks she's done, in preparation for the upcoming talent show, which is being held for the children of Westview Elementary. When Dottie inquires about the chairs, Beverly apologizes, and admits she didn't ask about the them. Dottie retorts that she shouldn't ask to "chair" any committees in the future, to the amusement of some of the other women at the committee, and she points out to her, that the devil's in the detail. Beverly returns to her seat, and [[Agatha Harkness|Agnes]] offers her a drink from her flask, pouring it in her glass. Once Dottie is finished talking, she gives permission to Beverly, and the other women, to clap, before shushing them. When the time of the talent show arrives, Beverly sits alongside Dottie, and her husband, [[Harold Proctor|Phil Jones]]. She witnesses [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] and [[Vision]]'s magical comedic performance, and is in awe when she witnesses Wanda lift a piano with one hand, before she accidentally reveals it to be a cutout. When Vision pulls a hat, though his own body, the curtains are pulled back, with a set of mirrors, implying that's how the trick was performed, but Beverly questions if that's how mirrors work, before Dottie tells her to shut up. She continues to watch the rest of the performance, and joins in on the applause, once the duo are over. When Wanda and Vision and crowned, best comedic performance, Beverly can be seen clapping alongside everyone else.

One day, Beverly is out in town, shopping with Dottie, when Wanda appears, and suddenly, the true personas of the towns residents are restored. Beverly reverts backs to her true identity, of Isabel, and approaches Wanda, alongside several other people. Isabel tells Wanda that her husband was on a business trip, and to tell him that she loves him, and not to return to Westview. Wanda tries to assure the group that she is protecting them, but they all simultaneously beg her, to free them. She screams at them to stop, releasing a burst of red magic, and placing them all in a choke. Isabel falls to the ground, unable to breathe, alongside everyone else, and Wanda quickly undoes this. Wanda promises that she will let them go, and begins lowering the Hex, surrounding Westview. Isabel and everyone run to escape, but it is quickly brought back, before she has the chance to leave. A battle ensues in the sky, between Wanda, and Agatha Harkness, and once it's over, the Hex begins to disappear, restoring the town, and its residents, to their original state. Before Wanda leaves, she makes her way in town to speak to [[Monica Rambeau]], and Isabel can be seen, amongst the various other townspeople, angrily staring at her, for the suffering she caused.
