The '''Polichinelles''' are characters who appear in the [[2018]] Disney film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''.

==Background==
They are a group of playful clowns residing in the skirt of the giant [[Mother Ginger]] automaton in the Land of Amusements. They constantly play around [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] whenever she enters the circus tent and speak in a high-pitched tone. What makes them unique is when one Polichinelle opens up, another one pops out in the style of a Matryoshka doll.

==Role in the film==
As [[Clara Stahlbaum|Clara]] enters the giant hoop skirt of the automaton [[Mother Ginger]] in the Land of Amusements, one Polichinelle gazes upon Clara who opens himself to reveal another one, forming into a group of six Polichinelles dancing around Clara who tries to escape, but two of them block her. The small member pushes Clara while another one raises a seat to a room where another Polichinelle plays an organ where the key required to open Marie's last gift is at. [[Phillip the Nutcracker|Phillip]] enters the skirt of the giant automaton just as the Polichinelles surround him. Clara, however, grabs the key and takes Phillip with her to escape the clowns surrounding Phillip.

Furthermore, as Phillip arrives at the Land of Amusements again, he approaches the six Polichinelles, explaining to them that he isn't threatening the clowns, followed by Mother Ginger asking the jesters to let him in, followed by Phillip explaining to her that Sugar Plum is planning to conquer the Four Realms with an army of toy soldiers just as Mother Ginger, the Polichinelles, and Phillip plan to stop her tyranny.

The Polichinelles later participate during battle against the army of toy soldiers summoned by Mother Ginger in a plan to take over the Four Realms just as the clowns bounce on them. One Polichinelle enters the Engine Room and brings Mother Ginger out of him to help Clara fight against the toy soldiers preparing to kill them. The battle, however, ends after Sugar Plum is reverted to her lifeless porcelain form, alongside the other tin soldiers.
