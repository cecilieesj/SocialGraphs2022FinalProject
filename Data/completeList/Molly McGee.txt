'''Molly McGee''' is the titular protagonist of the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Ghost and Molly McGee]]''. She is a 13-year-old Thai-American girl who befriends a grumpy ghost named [[Scratch (The Ghost and Molly McGee)|Scratch]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Molly is described to be an optimistic girl who lives to make the world a better place.

===Physical appearance===
Molly is a girl of small height. She has tan skin, dark brown hair with a reddish tint placed into a ponytail with a pink headband, and dark brown eyes.

Her clothes consist of a white t-shirt with black edges covered with a sleeveless ripped bottom jean jacket, waistband bike shorts, a magenta-and-purple zig-zag patterned plaid skirt, white and mint socks, and yellow-and-pink sneakers.

===Powers and Abilities===
When Molly became a ghost in "[[Molly vs. The Ghost World]]", she discovers that due to her immense joy, everything she touches suddenly turns nice and colorful. Her joy is so overwhelming that it frees all the ghosts sent to the Flow of Failed Phantoms and disintegrates the Chairman with a single touch.

==Trivia==
*Molly is the second main character from a Disney animated series to be a Thai-American. The first one is [[Anne Boonchuy]] from ''[[Amphibia]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CAPEUSA/status/1388695881453502472|title=CAPE Post|website=Twitter|date=May 1, 2021}}</ref>
**Coincidentally, both characters are thirteen years old.
*Molly is biracial, just like her voice actress, [[Ashly Burch]].
**She is also the second main Disney Channel character after [[Jake Long]] from ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]'' to be a Eurasian whom the latter is of both Chinese (maternally) and European-American (paternally) descent.
***Jake was also 13 (during season 1) and had a younger sister; opposed to Molly's younger brother.
*Molly was originally going to have a beauty mark below her right eye in one of the art promos by one of the crew members.
*Molly was originally going to be named '''Piper''' and her family was going to move to Transylvania rather than another American town.<ref>https://twitter.com/InevitablyBill/status/1527321949973536781</ref>
*Molly was originally going to be half-Black rather than half-Thai.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe1-XelDNtQ</ref>
*The bottom of Molly's skirt was designed to mimic the bottom of [[Scratch (The Ghost and Molly McGee)|Scratch]].
*"[[Lock, Stock, and Peril]]" implies that Molly has a form of ADHD, as her hyperactive personality, combined with the fact that she is easily distracted are indications of having that disorder.
