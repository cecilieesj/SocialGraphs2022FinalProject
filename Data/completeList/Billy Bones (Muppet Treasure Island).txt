'''Billy Bones''' is the drunken, wizened resident of the [[Admiral Benbow Inn]] in ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''.

An inveterate teller of tales, Bones spends his days recalling his time as a member of Captain Flint's crew, before Blind Pew, [[Black Dog]] and other old shipmates seek him out. The already nervy Bones, terrified of [[Long John Silver (Muppets)|the one-legged man]], is further distressed by the receipt of the Black Spot. The captain entrusts the map to [[Jim Hawkins (Muppet Treasure Island)|Jim Hawkins]] (as well as giving him, [[Gonzo]] and [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] a warning about running with pointy objects), but dies soon after of a heart attack in one of the bedrooms.

Billy Bones also possesses a Scottish accent (a trait not mentioned in the original novel).
