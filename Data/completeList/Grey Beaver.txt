== Role in the film ==
When a group of native Alaskans discover the cub, their chief, Grey Beaver, notes his “white fang,” proving the animal is descended from a domesticated dog. Grey Beaver adopts the cub and names him “White Fang.” Jack and Alex travel downstream to Grey Beaver’s village, and spend the night there at the chief’s invitation. Jack is intrigued by White Fang and tries to befriend the dog, but Grey Beaver discourages him, explaining that dogs are for work, not friendship. In the morning, Jack wanders away from the village and is pursued by a bear. He takes cover under a woodpile while White Fang comes to his defense and chases the bear away. Jack rewards the dog with a piece of jerky before he and Alex leave. After they arrive at Scott Conroy’s abandoned cabin, Alex offers to work the mine if Jack teaches him how to read. Meanwhile, Grey Beaver and White Fang arrive in Klondike City, where they encounter Beauty Smith and his fighting dog, Buck. While Grey Beaver offers animal pelts to a storekeeper, Beauty instigates a fight between the two dogs and White Fang wins. When Grey Beaver emerges from the store, Beauty demands compensation for his injured dog, forcing the chief to surrender White Fang.
