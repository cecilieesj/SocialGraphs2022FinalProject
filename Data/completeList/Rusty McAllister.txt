==Background==
===Personality===
So far from the movie, Rusty seems to be shy, quiet, and a bit nosey. Then yet he is also a nice and respectful person. He's only appeared three times in the movie. It also hints that Rusty is curious about superheroes when he once saw [[Mr. Incredible]] use his powers while lifting his car in a very angry mood and was easily-surprised by this. He must be very inspired by superheroes actions and their powers. Also [[Mr. Incredible]] might be one of his biggest fan's in the film.

==Role in the film==
Rusty is a minor character on the feature film ''[[The Incredibles]]''. He's a little boy that rides a tricycle and wears a cap. He really loves superheroes. It's possible that he might be a neighbor to [[Mr. Incredible]] since he appeared on his street. Rusty sees [[Mr. Incredible]] lifting up his car in an angry manner after having a bad day at work in a attempt to throw it. While using his powers, he becomes surprised that he blew a bubble with his gum which suddenly pops. He then appears again on [[Mr. Incredible]]'s yard and he asks Rusty: "Well, what are you waiting for?" then Rusty responds: "I don't know, something amazing, I guess". His last appearance in the movie was near the end of the film when [[Syndrome]] gets defeated by the Parr family and The Incredibles house blows up and after it blew up. Rusty says in an amazed way: "That was totally wicked", which means that he really loves superheroes and appreciates what they do.
