'''Craig Bean''' is a supporting character of the animated series ''[[Pepper Ann]]''. He is an eighth grader and the main love interest to [[Pepper Ann Pearson]] who displays a cool personality and equally likes to hang out with her.

==Background==
Craig Bean is the object of [[Pepper Ann Pearson|Pepper Ann]]'s affection. He is a calm young student at Hazelnut Middle School who has his own band and is admired by all the girls at school. As explained in "[[The Great Beyond]]", Craig got his start in guitar playing from his grandfather. Following his passing, he was unable to play until one day he decided to do so on a whim. Since then, he continues to play guitar as a way to remember his grandfather. Pepper Ann mentions that he also has a younger brother named Joey Bean who unlike Craig is allergic to everything and had trouble tying his shoes.

Craig for the most part remains very friendly with Pepper Ann throughout their time together in middle school. While not outright said if he had a crush on her as well, he did admire her and was genuinely impressed with all of her accomplishments. As time goes on, they start to become closer and hang out more often. At one point, Craig thought that he was taking her away from her friends [[Nicky Little]] and [[Milo Kamalani]] and was willing to leave her be so that she could spend time with them. By the series end, he and Pepper Ann remain close.

In "[[The Finale]]", it is established that in the series' version of [[2013]], that Craig stayed in Hazelnut and became a teacher at the school as a coach, swim class instructor and trigonometry teacher. He also adopts a dog and names her M' Girl, which Pepper Ann misinterprets as meaning that he already has a girlfriend. When she realizes the truth, she asks him out and he accepts.

===Personality===
Craig is a calm and reserved young man who is very friendly and down to earth. Unlike Pepper Ann who has an overactive imagination and easily misinterprets things, Craig is shown to be a more adjusted person who appears to have a better grasp of various concepts. He very rarely gets angered, but when he does, he displays the same calm demeanor, but with more intensity. Even as an adult, he retains his "cool guy" persona, but with more maturity.

===Physical appearance===
Craig is a tall slender Caucasian boy with waterfall brown hair, dark sunglasses and braces. He usually wears a red shirt with a collar and a black stripe going down it and blue jeans with a ripped hole in the knee. He wears a brown belt and the rim of his underdrawers can bee seen. He also wears plain brown shoes. 

==Trivia==

*In "[[A No Hair Day]]", he is revealed to have a mild form of [[wikipedia:Cutis verticis gyrata|cutis verticis gyrata]], in other words, a wrinkled head.
