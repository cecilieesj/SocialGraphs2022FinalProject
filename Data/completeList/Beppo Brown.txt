He is the father of [[Django Brown]] (one of [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]]’s friends) and [[Jenny Brown]] (one of [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]’s friends). He is voiced by [[Joel Grey]].

==Career==
Beppo is a well-known environmental installation artist, and has had at least three exhibitions at Jefferson County’s museum of contemporary art. All of his sculptures seem to be based on over-sized versions of everyday objects. One exhibition is called “Really Big Art Supplies”; another one is called “Donuts Over The Mountain”, and is, as the name implies, several over-sized donuts placed over a mountain range (“[[Oil on Candace]]”).

==Relationships==
===[[Django Brown]]===
[[Django Brown|Django]] seems to have inherited artistic talent from his father, but he seems intimidated by the fact that he can only make “small” things compared to Beppo’s over-sized creations. Phineas and Ferb tried to help Django make a huge painting to impress Beppo, but in the end, Beppo told Django he liked his art fine and honored it by hanging it on his giant fridge (“[[Oil on Candace]]”).

===[[Jenny Brown]]===
Nothing is really known about their relationship, but it is known that she is his daughter as confirmed by [[Dan Povenmire]].
