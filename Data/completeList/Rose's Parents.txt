{{Quote|My parents didn't die, [[the Huntsclan]] took me from them.|[[Rose]] realizing that she has a family}}

'''Rose's Parents'''Â are [[Rose]]'s seldom-seen mother and father. Not much is known about them, not even their names.

==Role in the series==
Not long after Rose and her unnamed twin were born, Rose was taken away from her family by [[the Huntsclan]] after her dragon birthmark was identified by the doctors and was raised by them who told her that her parents were dead. They are not seen again until the [[Huntsman (American Dragon: Jake Long)|Huntsman]] used their safety to blackmail Rose when it becomes known she was a traitor, where they were seen on a video screen eating dinner. Rose cooperated, but in the end, once again betrayed the Huntsman by using the [[The 13 Aztec Skulls|Aztec Skulls]] to destroy the Huntsclan.

In an attempt to save Rose, [[Jake Long|Jake]] used the Aztec Skulls to wish Rose had never been kidnapped, thus putting her in a normal life with her parents. They moved to Hong Kong shortly after and are not seen again until Jake needs her help in defeating [[the Dark Dragon]].

==Trivia==
*Rose's parents are only seen in three episodes, and out of all those episodes, only Rose's mother had lines.
*The gender of [[Rose]]'s twin is not indicated.
*With allowance for art styles, Rose's father bears a striking resemblance to [[James Timothy Possible]] from ''Kim Possible''.
