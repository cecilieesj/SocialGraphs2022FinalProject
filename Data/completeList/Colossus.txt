'''Colossus''', also known as the '''Mummy Hamster''', is a pet hamster of [[Nassor]] in the film, ''[[Frankenweenie]]'', the others being [[Shelley]] and the [[Were-Rat]]: he is the weakest among them.

==Appearances==
===''[[Frankenweenie]]''===
When Nassor is convinced he can bring his pet hamster, Colossus, back to life with a combination of incantations and [[Victor Frankenstein]]'s scientific secrets, Mummy Hamster is born! The mummy-wrapped little monster has a bigger-than-life idea of what he actually is. He later dies again when he is crushed under the gargantuan heel of [[Shelley]].

==Trivia ==

*Since the other monsters are meant to bare a resemblance to the original Universal Movie monsters, Colossus is meant to represent ''The Mummy''. Ironically, Nassor, his owner, bares a strong resemblance to actor Boris Karloff, who not only played the Frankenstein monster from ''Frankenstein'', but as Imhotep from ''[[wikipedia:The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''.
