'''Wexler''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' episode "[[Throw Mummy from the Train]]".

==Role in the Series==
The greedy assistant Wexler steals the ring to unlock the diamonds of the [[Sphinx]] of Inka-dinka-do from his companion, Dr. Crockery. He eludes the mummy assigned to guard it, [[Hiram]], and Wexler tries to hide the ring. However [[Chip and Dale|Dale]] gets it for a while, putting the Rangers on the case. Chip and Dale enter Wexler to tickle him in order to prevent him from inserting the Pharaoh's ring on the Sphinx's forehead, ultimately defeating him. In the end, he was arrested by Dr. Crockery and the police and taken to jail where he was to continue cataloging the artifacts in his jail cell as arranged by Dr. Crockery; much to his dismay.
