'''Dickie''' was a student from [[Norrisville High]] back in [[1985]]. He appeared in the episode "[[Stank'd to the Future]]".

==History==
During the prom of 1985, Dickie's love interest, Tawny, stood him up at the dance, which caused him to get [[Stank|Stanked]] by [[The Sorcerer (Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja)|the Sorcerer]]. At this time, [[Mac Antfee]], who had been the Ninja for longer than four years, had no intention of missing out on having fun at the prom. Instead of Destanking Dickie, Antfee locked him inside the school's freezer, where he was encased in a block of ice.

Years later, when [[Randy Cunningham]] unintentionally caused a power outage at school, the power to the freezer was cut off, causing Dickie to thaw out and cause havoc. Randy ended up doing battle with Dickie, and reverted the monster back to normal when he threw a possessed corsage into a wood chipper. The last thing that Dickie recalled was preparing to meet his girl Tawny at the prom. But after finding out that three decades had passed, Dickie started going into an emotional state.

The Sorcerer Stanked Dickie once again, turning him into a monster again. Once again, he went on a rampage, searching for Tawny while calling out her name. Randy tried to figure out what the Stank had possessed this time. But Randy found out that neither the photo nor the mixtape nor the 80's telephone had been Stanked. Unable to withstand Dickie's anger, Randy momentarily shut the beast inside a storage shed, trying to figure out what he'd missed. It was then that Tawny's photo caught Randy's eye, upon which the Ninja deduced that Tawny would have to be middle-aged by now.

Randy asked Miss Zingwald, the poetry teacher, what her first name was. She said her name was Mary Elizabeth, but everyone called her "Tawny". Hoping that this would revert Dickie back to normal, Randy took her outside. By this time, Dickie had broken out of the shed. When Dickie approached Miss Zingwald, she recognized him by his fanny pack, bow tie, and hairdo. Dickie was so pleased to be reunited with his long-lost love that the spell was broken, and he transformed from a teenager into a middle-aged man.

==Personality==
Dickie comes off as a typical teen from the 1980s, using the lingo from that era and having things like a fanny pack and a cassette tape. However, he seems pretty easy to stank, getting stanked because his girlfriend, Tawny, stood him up at the dance. He also becomes very emotional when he discovers he's stuck in the future and separated from his loved ones. He is quick to get excited or panicked in particular situations.

==Trivia==
*[[Howard Weinerman|Howard]] learned that Dickie didn't have the best of relationships with his parents after talking to him.
*Dickie is the first character seen with an abstract thing he holds most dear while stanked.
