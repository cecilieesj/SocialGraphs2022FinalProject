Can we keep him?"}}'''Heimlich and Schnitzel''' are two characters from the ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]'' TV series who appear in the episode "[[Don't Have the Vegas Idea]]". They were voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Corey Burton]] respectively.

==Background==
===Personality===
Heimlich and Schnitzel are shown to be intimidating and tormenting toward those who they regard as ridiculous, in the case of [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]].

===Physical description===
Heimlich is shown to have gray hair and white mane, while his brother Schnitzel on the other hand has white mane and gray hair.

==Role in the series==
Timon and Pumbaa are in Las Vegas searching for a way to earn money in order to dine at a seafood restaurant serving lobsters (for which they mistake as bugs), they stumble upon finding a lion show to which they enter. Heimlich and Schnitzel are preparing for a show when their trainers: [[Sigmund and Lloyd]] argue and break up to which Timon takes the opportunity to run the show in order to raise money, but Pumbaa is frightened to come across lions as they are known to eat warthogs. Schnitzel comments on his dislike toward his trainer.

As the show begins, Timon and Pumbaa enter the lion cage to facilitate Heimlich and Schnitzel during their performance. Timon tries to calm Pumbaa, who is frightened, into thinking that the lions are only actors performing in a Las Vegas stunt. Timon, who to them ridiculously attempts to initiate the performance, is instead frightened over their harsh response, in which Heimlich and Schnitzel begin to tease their attempts by responding harshly as they perform their acts, but focus mainly on Timon, after finding the lions' performance inconsiderate, while Pumbaa is no longer frightened and is instead entertained by their performance.

Heimlich and Schnitzel's trainers, still arguing, hear about Pumbaa's idea for a television special. They eventually reunite and decide to run the show again, under the lions' condition, which is to torment their trainers.
