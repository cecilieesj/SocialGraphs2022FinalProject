'''The Grandmaster''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and the secondary antagonist in most stories depicting him. He is an ancient alien being who finds enjoyment in challenging superheroes and pit them against each other. He is the brother of the [[Collector]].

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''====
During the credits of ''Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2'', the Grandmaster can be seen dancing along to the music playing in the credits.

====''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''====
The Grandmaster appears as the hedonistic ruler of [[Sakaar]]. He hosts the Contest of Champions, gladiatorial fights where he subjects interdimensional life-forms into fighting each other nearly to death. Prior to the film, the Grandmaster took in [[Valkyrie]] as one of his collectors for potential gladiators. When [[Thor Odinson|Thor]] and [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] arrive on Sakaar, Loki (who came two weeks prior to Thor) wins Grandmaster's favor and becomes Grandmaster's ally. Thor is sent to fight in the Contest of Champions where the Grandmaster informs him that should Thor win against his champion, he would be freed.

At the arena, Grandmaster watches from his cabinet and learns that his champion, the [[Hulk]], is an old ally of Thor. Thor tries to calm the Hulk down, but the two soon engage in a fight. Thor almost defeats Hulk; however, the Grandmaster sabotages the fight by activating Thor's obedience disk, leaving Thor weakened and allowing Hulk to win the fight. Despite Hulk's victory, Thor is spared and instead held captive by the Grandmaster. Soon, however, Thor escapes with the Hulk and manages to turn him back into Bruce Banner. Believing that the Hulk's disappearance is because Thor kidnapped him, the Grandmaster announces that his forces will be hunting down Thor.

The Grandmaster sends Valkyrie and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, but Valkyrie decides to help Thor and Banner liberate the other gladiators, while Loki tags along for convenience. With an uprising on his hands, the Grandmaster orders the people and his bodyguards to not let Thor and his comrades leave the planet. His plot is unsuccessful, and the Grandmaster's empire is overturned by the revolution. After being found by the rebels, the Grandmaster tries to convince them to thank him, claiming that without him, they would have nothing to rebel against.

==== ''[[What If...?]]'' ====
The alternate Grandmaster first appeared in "[[What If... Thor Were an Only Child?]]", where he serves as a DJ for Thor's party.

Another Grandmaster appeared in "[[What If... Ultron Won?]]", as Ultron invades Sakaar, he watches in horror as this planet gets destroyed.
