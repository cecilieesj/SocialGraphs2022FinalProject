In this comic, she has a party in [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]'s home, where Mickey's twin nephews [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse|Morty and Ferdie]] keep annoying him throughout the night.
Later, in ''Goofy's Hallowe'en'' (an illustrated text story from Walt Disney's Comics & Stories #38), she has another party. Goofy thinks he isn't invited (his invitation was still in his mailbox), and decides to learn proper etiquette. Miss Bovina had a major role in this comic.
