[[File:Valiant-04.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Rollo]]
'''Rollo''' is a character in ''[[Valiant]]''. He's a member of the French Resistance: Mouse Devision and he's an expert of sabotage, he likes it so much that he will go out of his way to make sabotage (even when he hears the word). Which shows he may well be a bit crazy. He helped [[Charles De Girl]] guide Valiant and the Royal Homing Piegeon Service through the battle field to get the message.

He was voiced by Buckley Collum.
