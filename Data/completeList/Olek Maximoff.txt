'''Olek Maximoff''' is a character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. He was first referenced in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', and made his debut in the [[Disney+]] series, ''[[WandaVision]]''. He is the husband of Iryna Maximoff, and the father of twins, [[Quicksilver|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]]. He lived in [[Sokovia]], where he worked as a DVD salesman, and died alongside his wife after a Stark missile landed in their home. He is portrayed by Daniyar.

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
While discussing ways to defeat the [[Avengers]], [[Ultron]] brings up the death of [[Quicksilver|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]]'s parents, having seen the records. Pietro gives detail, by talking about how a missile landed in their home, and when the first shell hit, two floors below, it made a large hole in the floor, with their parents falling in. Wanda reveals that the missile was produced by Stark.

====''[[WandaVision]]''====
Olek is first mentioned in the [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]]. While discussing [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]], [[Jimmy Woo|Jimmy]] gives a quick brief on her history, and mentions that she was born in [[Sokovia]] in [[1989]], to [[Iryna Maximoff|Iryna]] and Olek Maximoff, both killed during an air raid when Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

Olek is featured in the [[Previously On|eighth episode]] of the series. After [[Agatha Harkness|Agatha]] captures Wanda, she forces her to relive her most traumatic memories, and starts with the day her parents died. Olek returns home from work, and greets his wife, who rushes over to hug him. She opens his briefcase, and finds that he hasn't sold a significant amount, worrying her, but Olek reassures her that he'll sell them tomorrow, meaning they have more for their TV night. Pietro arrives in the room, demanding his parents speak in English, as that is the only rule of TV night. He takes off his jacket, and gives it to his son, to hang, and asks where Wanda is. She enters the room, and he gives her a hug and kiss on the cheek. He's ready to begin, now that the entire family is here, and asks Wanda to pick the TV show, for tonight. He opens up his case, but Wanda's choice isn't there, and he remembers that he kept it in a special place for extra safekeeping. He moves a rug, attached to the wall, and beneath it is a hole, containing Wanda's choice. He takes out ''The Dick Van Duke Show'', and confirms this is her pick. Pietro complains that they have to watch another sitcom, and Olek remembers her choice to be the "walnut episode". Iryna describes the synopsis, and uses the term "Shennanigans", causing Pietro to ask what it means. Wanda, Iryana and Olek all give examples, with Olek defining it as silly mischief that always becomes fine. He plays the series, and the family begin watching together. In the middle of the show, a missile lands in their home, killing Olek and Iryna.
