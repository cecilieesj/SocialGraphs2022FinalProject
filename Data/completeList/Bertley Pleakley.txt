==Role in the series==
He made an appearance in "[[Fibber (episode)|Fibber]]" where he,along with [[Mrs. Pleakley|his mother]] and his sister, [[Pixley Pleakley|Pixley]], arrived in [[Hawaii]] when they believed [[Pleakley]] was getting married. Bertley is shown to be sulking and grumpy, at the dinner table that their family were talking about Pleakley's name "Wendy" means "brave warrior" on their home planet, Bertley silently yet furiously spoke that he really wanted that name. Bertley seems to have odd tastes in woman, at the wedding, when [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] took [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s place, Bertley was in awe by "her" beautiful, and even took an interest in Nani. Due to the arrival of [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]], who unintentionally revealed that Experiment 032 ([[Fibber]]) is a lie detector, Pleakley revealed the truth to them, which they were greatly upset at that Bertley verbally expressed he hates him, however, Fibber beeped at all their lies, revealing the family doesn't hate him, in their moment of honesty, Bertley revealed he's jealous of his brother, describing him as a "tall, handsome, and a babe magnet" which Pleakley took fond. The reason for this was because of their mother, who admitted she pushed her children too hard all because she wanted them to be happy. Though Pleakley tells them that he is happy with his family. Bertley than to know if she can marry Nani as he hold up some flowers, to which Nani and David refused. They than made amends with each other and left.

Bertley, along with his mother and sister, appeared again in ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', where they attend Pleakley being awarded of the position of being Head of Earth Studies at Galactic Alliance Community College. Bertley happens to be asleep before his mother nudges him to wake up.
