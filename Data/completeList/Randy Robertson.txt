Randy was present when his school went on a field trip to Oscorp. Some time later, he and [[Liz Allan]] planned the event where [[Max Modell]] would give a special lecture at their school.

Later, Randy came across Liz watching the Screwball website and told her that she is a criminal and that if she wanted to change the world, she would do it in a legal way, like his blog. At a construction site, Randy tried to record his father, [[Robbie Robertson]], give a speech but a construction machine malfunctioned. Later, during gym class, the [[Absorbing Man]] came and kidnapped Randy demanding that Screwball reveal herself. She did so and was captured too. During transport, Screwball revealed herself to be Liz. They were rescued by [[Spider-Man]].
