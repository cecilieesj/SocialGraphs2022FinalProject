Doc, [[Lambie]], [[Stuffy]] and [[Chilly]] go downstairs to find him, bumping into [[Donny McStuffins|Donny]] and [[Dr. McStuffins]] along the way. In the living room, Stuffy roars to call Pip, and Doc finds him in the floor lamp and the gang bring him back to Penny. Doc finds that one of the patches to hold Pip on Penny's back has fallen off and tells her how she wandered off from her mom at the shoe store. After singing a song about sticking with Penny, the babies learn their lesson and the gang show them their painting.
