==Role in the film==
Larry is a dim-witted yet very good-hearted anaconda snake who tries to keep up with [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]] and the gang, despite his lack of hands or legs. Though he does help, being the stretchiest animal in the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]], and his elongated body can be used as a variety of things. He is used as a slingshot during the curling championship when Samson is about to fling his turtle curling iron across the ice rink, but slips. Larry is also used as a prop when he and the other animals become trapped inside a garbage truck. Samson uses Larry to hold the trash compressor open, but it fails. Larry then frightens the truck driver, and the animals manage to escape. Larry is almost killed as a trio of rabid stray dogs try to attack the snake, so Samson make him along with the other two escape through the sewer rather than fight. He accompanies Samson during [[Ryan]]'s rescue and gives Ryan a choking hug upon finding him. Larry is last seen on the boat wearing a fruit hat and makeup done by Cloak and Camo as a "snake-over", and dances with his zoo friends as they head back home.

==Trivia==
*Larry is the second Disney snake character who is a protagonist, the first being [[Murgatroid]] from ''[[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue]]'', the third being [[Juju]] from ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''.
