==Appearances==
===''[[Avengers Assemble]]''===
Not much is known about Nuke's past other than that he died prior to the destruction of their home planet.Â He appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme. When the Avengers raid the Squadron Supreme's citadel a third time, they find it is actually draining some energy from Earth's core in order to restore Nuke who then destroys the citadel (though Ant-Man manages to shrink himself and the other Avengers to safety onto Mjolnir). Nuke then meets up with Nighthawk as he is pleased that the Squadron Supreme is back together. Nuke is present when Nighthawk makes his demands on television. In the episode "Avengers Underground," Iron Man, Thor, and Falcon trap Zarda and Nuke in the same prison box. As part of his contingency plan Nighthawk then teleports Nuke and Hyperion to the tower where Hyperion absorbs Nuke's power with the intent on destroying Earth.

==Trivia==
*Nuke is based on the DC Comics superhero Firestorm.
