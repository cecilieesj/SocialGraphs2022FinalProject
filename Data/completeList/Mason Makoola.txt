'''Mason Makoola''' is a tritagonist of the series, [[Pair of Kings]]. He is the royal bodyguard and advisor over Kinkow Island. The nickname that Kings [[Brady Parker|Brady]] and [[Boomer Parker|Boomer]] usually call him is a sasquatch.

==History==
===Season One===
In Return of the Kings, he returns Boomer and Brady to Kinkow and makes them the kings of Kinkow. Mason knows that Boomer and Brady are the Kings of Legend. He doesn't like it when Brady is mocking about his daughter since Brady has a crush on Mikayla.

===Season Two===
Makoola tries to convince island elders that the twins are in fact the legendary kings, but when Brady and Boomer lie to him, he loses all trust in them. Brady and Boomer come back to Kinkow and defeat Zadoc, earning back Mason's trust.

===Season Three===
In the first episode of season 3, it was shown that Mason knew that Boomer and Brady have another brother (Boz) because they're triplets. He felt embarrassed that he said Brady is a king of legend when he really wasn't, or so it is believed, (quite possibly, that change in the movie.)

==Physical Appearance==

Mason Makoola is part Sasquatch. Mason is tall, muscular, with a very deep voice.
==Personality==

He is wise, strong, good with a machete (he chopped a palm tree and a table in half), and loyal to the kings, Boomer and Brady, though he sometimes gets annoyed by the antics the kings put themselves in. He's also the overprotective father of Mikayla, of whom Brady is not-so-secretly crushing on. He was very close to the triplet's parents. He has a younger brother named Jason and they don't get along but eventually rekindle their brotherhood. He is part sasquatch. In season 3 Mason became a bit unsure of his answers because Brady left and he isn't the king of legend, despite all signs pointing to the brothers. He is also show to be hesitant because he was wrong before.

==Quotes==

"This is thirty-six inches of cold hard steel forged from the fires of Mt. Don't Touch My Daughter."
