== History ==

=== Development History ===
"Nipper" (1884-1895) is the name of a dog of a dog which was featured in the 1888 portrait His Master's Voice by Francis Barraud.  The painting showed Nipper the dog listening to a 19th-century gramophone, inferred to be playing the voice of Nipper's owner.  The portrait would come to be used as a logo for recording companies, notably [[RCA|RCA Records]].

When Space Mountain first opened in [[1975]], the attraction was sponsored by RCA and contained hefty allusions to the record-company.  Notably among them was an Audio-Animatronic of Nipper which appeared inside of a slowly rotating [[Flying Saucers|flying-saucer]] near the entrance to the attraction.  Within the dome of the saucer, Nipper was seen staring into his iconic gramophone which played and instrumental of the song, "[[Here's to the Future]]".

By [[1994]], RCA would discontinue its sponsorship of the attraction with the sponsorship being taken up by FedEx.  For obvious reason, Nipper's audio-animatronic was removed from the ride's entrance and changed to being a figure of a robot-dog by removing its outer mould, exposing its super-structure and AA mechanisms.  Nipper would be placed at the feet of a robotic tourist in Space Mountain's exit-ramp, holding a camera and implied to be the robot's pet.  In [[2009]] the robot version of Nipper would be relocated once again in a refurbished exit-ramp leading to the Tomorrowland Light & Power gift-shop.  The dog would be placed in a new vignette, themed around one of Space Mountain's tourism destinations.
