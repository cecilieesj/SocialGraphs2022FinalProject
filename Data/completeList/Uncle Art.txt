An intergalactic pizza man, Art takes his job seriously to the point of taking on a superhero persona in his deliveries. He was voiced by late [[Adam West]], who portrayed the superhero Batman in the [[Wikipedia:Batman (1966 TV series)|1966â€“1968 TV series]] and [[Wikipedia:Batman (1966 film)|film adaptation]], which can be connected to why Uncle Art was first mistaken by Lewis to be a charismatic superhero.

==Appearances==
===''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''===
Art first appears in the film running past [[Bud Robinson|Bud]] and [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] to make another delivery in his ship, the Anchovy Saucer. He later appears at dinner, reminiscing over a delivery when the spaghetti arrives and participates in the battle against [[Tiny the T-Rex]], briefly bombarding the dinosaur with pizza dough before it re-emerges and bites into the ship, bringing it down.

===[[Meet the Robinsons (video game)|''Meet the Robinsons'' (video game)]]===
Art hangs out with his ship parked outside and enlists [[Wilbur Robinson|Wilbur]]'s help to round up some creatures called Zumzats, which stowed away on his ship during a delivery. Later, in the alternate timeline, Art stops to deliver a pizza to Emperor [[Stanley (Meet the Robinsons)|Stanley]], allowing Wilbur an opportunity to enter the fortress.

== Trivia==

*Art's last name was present in earlier drafts of the film before falling out of use in the final film.
*Art off-handedly mentions his meatball pizza stopping a civil war on the Moon of Qward. Qward is a planet from the DC Comics universe primarily known as the headquarters of ''Green Lantern'' villain Sinestro.
