'''Parisia''' is minor character in 2019 series ''[[Amphibia]]''

== Background ==
=== Physical appearance ===
Parisia is a pale orange olm, wearing a gray headdress of some sort, with a red bead at the front. She has red and orange fire-like gills, with gold rings, and golden hoop earrings, with gold and red beads dangling from them.

She wears a gray necklace, with a black eye-like bead, with a red pupil in the centre, as well as red and gray bracelets.

== Role in the Series ==
Olms are revealed to be a subterranean Amphibian civilization, and reside in the city of Proteus. They are rare in Amphibia due to their sensitivity to sunlight and distrust of outsiders. They are also revealed to have their own coded language.

When [[Anne Boonchuy]], [[Sasha Waybright]] and the Plantar family arrived to see [[Mother Olm]], Parisia was shocked that they knew about her and was outraged that [[Lysil and Angwin]] had returned because they were originally night watchers from Proteus and were exiled because they started arguing, and in their carelessness, a swarm of troglobites sneaked into the city and almost destroyed it.

She refused to help, but after the olm twins risked their lives to save Proteus and Sasha actually stood up to her, Parisa was impressed by their determination. She allowed Lysil and Angwin back into the city under supervision and granted the humans and frogs an audience with Mother Olm. 

== Trivia ==
* The name "Parisia" may be derived from the Celtic Gallic word "parisio", meaning "working people", while also referring to the Parisii, the name for the Celtic people that lived on the banks of the river Seine in Gaul from the Iron Age to the Roman era. The Parisii lived in what is now the French capital city, Paris, which is named after the Gallic tribe.
**Her name may also be a reference to the animal's original discovery by Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers in the city of Paris.
