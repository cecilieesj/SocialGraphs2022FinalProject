'''Sharona Skye '''(Elisa Donovan) is a celebrity web blogger who works for Tween Weekly in the episode "Poll'd Apart". She is very mean to Tawni when she said that [[Sonny]] is much prettier than her.

Later on to get their own back, the entire cast of ''So Random'' turn up wearing her outfit. When she threatens to ruin them on her blog, she is horrified when Sonny tells her that they do not care what she thinks anymore, and has no power over them.
