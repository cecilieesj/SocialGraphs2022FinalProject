==Role in the film==
In the film, he is the only who despises the idea of getting the band back together. He claims he was the reason they stayed together while the others were drinking ([[Zeb Zoober|Zeb]]), blubbering ([[Tennessee O'Neal|Tennessee]]), or staring into space ([[Fred Bedderhead|Fred]]). He claims that they never thanked him for that. He also lied saying he was still rich, but in reality, he spent all of it, he has a job singing at weddings and children's birthday parties, and he lives with [[Elton John]] as a neighbor and gardener. Thanks to Beary, he remembers why he became a Country Bear in the first place and is willing to save the beloved [[Country Bear Hall]].{{DEFAULTSORT:Bedderhead, Ted}}
