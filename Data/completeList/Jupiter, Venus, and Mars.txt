'''Jupiter, Venus, and Mars''' are characters who appear in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. They are a trio of Roman gods whom [[Xandra]], [[Panchito]], [[José Carioca|José]], and [[Donald Duck|Donald]] encounter at the World Tree.

==Background==
Jupiter, Venus, and Mars are three Roman gods who inhabit the World Tree. Prior to their duties of taking care of the World Tree, they did war strategies back then before the Three Caballeros arrived but until Xandra returned, she later found out that they now do gardening in caring the World Tree in which the problems the three Roman gods now face are the termites. However, when [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] came to the World Tree for world domination, they were unaware of Felldrake at first but when Felldrake turned the World Tree's termites into mutant forms, the Roman gods returned to their war strategies in protecting the Tree from the termites as well as working together in defeating Felldrake to which the Roman gods, along with Xandra and the Caballeros, were able to protect the Tree.

==Role in the series==
In "[[World Tree Caballeros]]", Jupiter, Venus, and Mars approach [[Xandra]] and the Three Caballeros to which the three suddenly recognize Xandra who returned to the World Tree. Upon arriving there, Venus explains to Xandra that she hasn't changed to which as Xandra explains to them about them using gardening tools as weapons, Venus explains that the Roman gods no longer do war strategies and now take care of the World Tree, to which Jupiter explains that the World Tree has remained unchanged since the Titan War to which Mars explains that this is the reason why they now do gardening at the World Tree. Xandra then introduces the Three Caballeros to the Roman gods who explains to the three that Felldrake has returned for world domination in which Venus explains that the only problems they face now is the termite problem just as Jupiter plans for a feast for Xandra and the Caballeros to which Xandra and the Caballeros attend their feast.

Later when [[Baron Von Sheldgoose|Sheldgoose]] has cast a spell on the termites, José, Donald, and Panchito are chased by the mutated termites to which while being surrounded, they fear that only Xandra would help save them. Meanwhile, Xandra discusses with the Roman gods about what happened even before Felldrake came to which Jupiter explains that they have remained the same for many years to which Xandra explains that she was trapped in a magical atlas. Xandra then explains to them to return to their heroic duties to stay focused in protecting the World Tree to which while discussing, Jupiter tells Xandra that there are termites behind her to which the termites begin charging down the Tree, reminding Mars of the Titan War all over again just as Xandra, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars hide under a table during the ambush. Later when Xandra sees Sheldgoose taking the World Fruit, she tells the Roman gods to stop Felldrake's evil plans.  Xandra explains to Daisy's nieces for help to which June explains to her to look inside herself to be heroic. Reminding Xandra of the nieces, she devises a plan to the Roman gods to return to their fighting skills so that they can be mighty heroes.

Later, when the termites surround the Caballeros, Xandra brings in Jupiter, Venus, and Mars to return to their combat skills in helping rescue the Caballeros to which the three were able to dispatch the termites, turning them from the mutated forms to their normal forms. Having taken care of the termites (reverting them back to their normal forms), Xandra notices Felldrake absorbing powerful magic as Xandra faces him and his descendant to which Sheldgoose and his ancestor send a meteor shower to destroy the World Tree to which Xandra, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars protect the Tree from the meteor shower with help from the Caballeros to which the three are tasked to distract him to which in a plan to stop him, Jupiter tosses the three to the spot Sheldgoose is at as the gods continue deflecting the meteors to which as the Caballeros confuse Sheldgoose, Xandra fires a perfect shot at Sheldgoose, causing him to drop the World Fruit as the meteor Sheldgoose is on crumbles as the Caballeros rope a branch for them to avoid falling, leaving Felldrake and Sheldgoose defeated. Xandra praises the gods for their heroism as the gods celebrate their victory with Earth-themed pie.

In "[[Sheldgoose Square Dance]]" when Sheldgoose summons the Moon Bots to attack Xandra and the Caballeros, Xandra summons Jupiter, Venus, and Mars via zoom point during the final battle to which the Roman gods were able to defeat the Moon Bots, helping the Caballeros reach the Summoning Chamber. Later when Felldrake prepares for a new age of darkness, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars are sent back to the World Tree via zoom point as it is shown that the reinforcements summoned during the final battle are sent back to their respective homes. Even after the final battle has ended, it is likely that Jupiter, Venus, and Mars have been sent back to the World Tree still retaining their duties in protecting it.

==Trivia==
*Jupiter has a striking resemblance to [[King Triton]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (franchise)|The Little Mermaid]]'' franchise.
*Jupiter can be briefly seen in the first episode "[[Dope-a Cabana]]" during the prologue sequence prior to making a proper appearance in "World Tree Caballeros".
*In "World Tree Caballeros", a running gag is whenever Mars mispronounces Xandra's name, the other characters correct him by saying, "It's Xandra!".
