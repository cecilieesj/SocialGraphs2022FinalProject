==Background==
Dr. Tobar resided in a laboratory behind a steel door across from Dr. Johnson's examination room at [[Duckburg]] Hospital. He was always trying to protect germs rather than get rid of them. Using his most recent invention, the Germinator Ray, Tobar shrunk himself down to microscopic size and snuck into Dr. Johnson's room. He managed to get inside [[Donald Duck]]'s body and into the brain. Once Tobar rewired the controls inside Donald's brain, he gained complete control of Donald's body and commenced his plan, which he referred to as "Operation Germination".

==='''Physical Appearance'''===
He is a short man with light green hair, pale face and skin, reddish orange eyes and brown bags on his eyes, and bad teeth and wears a white lab coat, an inside dark-red shirt and blue bow tie.
