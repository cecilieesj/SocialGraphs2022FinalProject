}}'''Fisher''' is a Seagull character that appears in the [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' reboot]].

==Background==
As shown in "[[The Ballad of Duke Baloney!]]", Mann and Fisher rescued [[Flintheart Glomgold]] after he fell into the sea and disappeared for months during the events of "The Shadow War!". When Duke became amnesiac, he and Mann start helping Duke with their duty until it is found out that "Duke Baloney" is Flintheart Glomgold the whole time where the two turn against him for being a fraud.

==Role in the series==
Fisher and his partner [[Mann]] are introduced in the Season 2 episode, "[[The Ballad of Duke Baloney!]]".

Fisher and his companion Mann are first seen bringing a net to their ship, looking at something weird they caught during their fishing campaign. They discover an amnesiac [[Flintheart Glomgold]] upon capturing him. When [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Louie]] and [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]] arrive at Bait 'n Such and talk about what happened to Glomgold (disguised as "Duke Baloney"), he and Mann arrive at the spot where their conversation is interrupted just as Mann tells the two that Bait 'n Such is a bully-free zone as she does not tolerate anyone bullying employees. Just as the two leave, Louie and Webby discuss about Flintheart Glomgold's disappearance in [[Duckburg]]. Meanwhile at Chums when Glomgold is talking with Louie and Webby as he and Mann introduce "Duke" to the two. Trying to prove to reveal Glomgold's true identity, Fisher then asks Glomgold an offer to buy a Pep for everyone at Duckburg, the two prepares to investigate the case of Glomgold's disguise as he, Mann, and Glomgold leave Chums and discover the McDuck Enterprises fishing boat arriving back on shore. Glomgold, however, slowly remembers that the boat is linked to [[Scrooge McDuck]] as Mann tells him to catch up with the two.
Later, Glomgold brings Fisher and his companion to catch more fish than the McDuck Enterprises boat in order to make him rich. Devising a devious scheme towards the two, Fisher warns that if they overfish, the ocean will have less fish than before. Just as he and Mann leave, Glomgold decides to take revenge against the McDuck Enterprises fishing boat while Louie and Webby are having trouble finding out who "Duke Baloney" really is. The next day, Glomgold arrives where Fisher and Mann greet him where they want him in their family with the sign he received from them. [[Scrooge McDuck]], however, arrives and interrupts the conversation between the couple and Glomgold as he is looking for "Duke Baloney" to which he decides to let his nemesis be part of the couple's family.
When Louie and Webby are in danger, Fisher is seen among the crowd cheering for "Duke" who is about to save them. However, it is found out that "Duke Baloney" is Flintheart Glomgold (due to his disguise beard disintegrated by thunder) the whole time just as Fisher and the crowd turn against him for his lies and deception to the citizens of Duckburg.

In "[[Moonvasion!]]", Fisher is one of the victims under attack by the Moonlander alien invasion. His further fate is unknown after the battle ceased.

==Trivia==
*Fisher slightly resembles [[Scuttle]] from "[[The Little Mermaid]]".
