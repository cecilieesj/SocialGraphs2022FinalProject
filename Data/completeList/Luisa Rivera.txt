'''Luisa Rivera''', also known as''' Mamá''', is a supporting character in the [[2017]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]''. She is the wife of [[Enrique Rivera|Enrique]] and the mother of [[Miguel Rivera|Miguel]] , a considerate, gentle, and kind-hearted mother, a personality she shares with [[Mamá Coco]].

==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Miguel's loving mother who gently encourages her son to embrace their family's traditions.''

==Role in the film==
Luisa appears pregnant with her second-born during most of the film. While in the Rivera workshop making shoes, [[Abuelita (Coco)|Abuelita]] returns home to inform her and [[Enrique Rivera|Enrique]] that she caught Miguel at the Mariachi Plaza. At sunset, she helps her nephews set up marigold petals for Día de Los Muertos. Later, Luisa, Enrique, and Abuelita tell Miguel that they have decided to let him into the shoemaking business. Luisa, along with the other Riveras, witness Miguel getting into an argument with Abuelita that causes Miguel to run off in anger. 
Concerned for Miguel, she and Enrique follow Miguel to the town's cemetery to look for him. However, at that time, Miguel had become a spirit, so Luisa is unable to see him as she calls out for his name.

Miguel returns home the next morning, alerting the Riveras. After failing to help Mamá Coco remember, Luisa comforts Miguel with Enrique, consoling that they are together now. However, Miguel decides to play the song "[[Remember Me (song)|Remember Me]]" to Mamá Coco, which brings her back to her senses. Luisa is moved by the moment, and along with the rest of the family, she learns about Coco's father [[Héctor]] from Coco's stories and letters.

Sometime before the next Dia de Los Muertos, Luisa has given birth to a little girl and names her after Mamá Coco. She stands next to Enrique and her baby daughter as they watch Miguel play the [[Héctor's Guitar|guitar]] for [[Proud Corazón|the celebration]].

==Trivia==
*Luisa is one of the six characters in the movie to be voiced by the same actor in both the English and Latin American Spanish dubs of the film, the others being her great-grandfather-in-law [[Héctor]], her grandfather-in-law Julio Rivera, the Departure Agent, the Security Guard, her brother-in-law Tío Berto.
