'''Valentina''' is a supporting character in ''[[West Side Story]]''. She runs Doc's Drugstore and acts as the confidant to [[Tony (West Side Story)|Tony]] in his quest to win the heart of [[María Vasquez]] while also putting up with the street war.

==Background==

===Personality===
Valentina is a wisened woman who is very patient and approachable. She is very big on compassion and hospitality and is implied to be the only person who took a chance on Tony following his parole. She has high morals and tries to see the best in everyone regardless of their background or upbringing. This is all the more heartbreaking when she witnesses the [[Jets]] attempting to harm [[Anita (West Side Story)|Anita]] and scolds them for being malicious and unsympathetic for ignorant reasons.

==Trivia==
*Valentina was invented for the film and replaces the character Doc. He is mentioned in the film as Valentina's late husband and is seen in a photo within his drugstore.
**The role of Doc was portrayed by six actors in previous performances. When the original Broadway show opened back in [[1957]], Doc was portrayed by Art Smith and then by David Bauer when the show opened on the West End the year after. In the [[1961]] film adaptation, Ned Glass portrayed him. In the [[1980]] Broadway revival, he was played by Sammy Smith, Greg Vinkler in the [[2009]] revival, and then by Daniel Oreskes in the [[2020]] revival.
*[[Rita Moreno]], a longtime Hollywood veteran, portrays the character in honor of her portrayal of [[Anita (West Side Story)|Anita]] in the [[1961]] film adaptation.
