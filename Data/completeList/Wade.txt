'''Wade''' is [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] and [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]]'s Communication Guru. He's ten years old and has already graduated high school and college. He created the [[Kimmunicator]] which has provided Kim with the tools needed to fight her foes. Though Wade is on the large side, his brain is even bigger. He rarely leaves the house and has only been seen in person twice prior to Season Four.

==Background==
===Talents and Skills===
Wade is a talented kid, as he interlinked with the whole world in his very own room at home and created several small [[w:c:kimpossible:Wade's Gadgets|gadgets]] for Kim and Ron. He likes technology and prefers to solve things in the technical way. As already established, his hacking has few obstacles that he can't beat, and anything to do with technology is something Wade can generally get into and deal with. Overall, Wade is a computer nerd.

However, in the field he's shown to be less than useful as he's had at least one friendly fire incident with a stun device ("Odds Man In") that resulted in him and Kim being captured. Nonetheless, he can ride horses ("[[Cap'n Drakken]]") and his gadgetry talents are useful in a support role on the team when in the field ("Homecoming Upset"). He finished high school and college in eight months.

===Personal History===
The person responsible for maintaining Kim's website (having met her and Ron under unspecified circumstances), Wade contacts Ron and Kim to provide them with their various missions, as well as sending them assorted gadgets and information. According to Kim, Wade completed his high school and college education in eight months. Despite being a genius, Wade was only ever seen in person for the first time during the group's confrontation with [[Team Impossible (characters)|Team Impossible]] when angry at the team in question for sending a virus that had shut down his system, although following this meeting he proceeded to maintain more regular personal contact with Kim and Ron.

Wade's hacking talents are regularly put to good use, as firewall defenses like Drakken's can only keep him from getting into the deepest things ("Crush"), and he's able to tap into Global Justice spy satellites when need be ("[[Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time|A Sitch in Time]]"), and was even able to "hack into the unknown" to find out about Yamanouchi. Few things have been recorded to be able to withstand his hacking, the lab in which the Centurion Project was developed being one of them ("October 31st").

Wade is also an inventor, sometimes bordering on being a mad scientist himself. Among his more mundane devices includes Kim's iconic grappling hook, laser lipstick, and a compact mirror capable of deflecting energy weapons. On the higher end comes Kim's battle suit ("So the Drama" ) and a love ray ("The Cupid Effect"). Regardless of what scale, Wade's inventions are reliable and only break when damaged or improperly used by the user.

==Relationships==
He's a good friend to the protagonist, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]], and her sidekick/boyfriend, [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]]. He once had a crush on [[Monique]], Kim's best friend, in "[[The Cupid Effect]]", but after the events went astray, they ended up as good friends and he found someone with the brain-size in his range, named Olivia. Otherwise he seems to have a friendly relationship with the rest of the Possible family, as evidenced by him knowing them and having semi-regular contact with the Tweebs by Kim's Senior Year ("Trading Faces").

His enemies include all villains Kim ever faces, though he is never actively involved in the fights except with [[Team Impossible]], and even though all he did was activate their own McHenry Laser Grid on them.

===Family===
Wade's unnamed mother appears to be African-American. Only she has rarely appeared on the show, but his father is clearly mentioned as being around especially when using his socks. They both seem unconcerned with their son's way of spending all his time, and his mother seems to really enjoy Wade's inventions and cleverness. He supposedly also has a great-grand-uncle, who appeared in "[[Rewriting History]]" and was a photographer 100 years ago, though he may or may not have existed due to the episode being a dream sequence.

In Season 4, it is mentioned that Wade's father, Lontaine, is often absent. So much so that his wife questioned that flowers he supposedly sent her for Valentine's Day (it was actually the Seniors in order to gain access to Wade's computer) were really from him ("[[The Cupid Effect]]"). Nothing else has been said on the rest of his family.

==Trivia==
*According to the pre-show pre-production Series-Pitch Bible written by Schooley and McCorkle, Wade's last name was "Load".{{Citation needed}}
**However, since much of the Bible ''did not'' make it to screen—Kim's father invented and sold snacks, her mother (Kim Sr.) was a senator, Zita Flores was her best friend, and more—it can only be considered as apocryphal and non-canon.
