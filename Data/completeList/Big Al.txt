[[Disneyland Casting Agency]]|shows=[[The Wonderful Spring of Mickey Mouse]] (cameo)}}'''Big Al''' is an overweight gray bear who performs in the Disney theme park attraction [[Country Bear Jamboree]]. He also appears in the [[The Country Bears|2002 feature film]] based on the attraction.
==Background==
===Biography===
From [[1972]]'s Country Bear Jamboree record album:

''Big Albert says, “I was born in a cave near the Princess Theater in Pocatello, Idaho”. There was music in his blood, and he’s been playing his guitar since he was a child. It’s become more difficult—Big Al has grown, and the guitar hasn’t. He loves to sit in front of his cave and sing. He was the first to practice ecology; he didn’t litter his cave with tin cans and paper cartons—he ate ‘em. He was resident bard and balladeer in the swamp before Walt Disney World was built (and three badgers and an alligator have expressed great joy that he is now singing for people). This is Big Albert’s 10th farewell appearance.''

=== Development History ===
Big Al was designed by animator [[Marc Davis]] and modelled after Disney imagineer [[Al Bertino]].

==Appearances==

=== Big Al's ===
Big Al's is an outdoor gift-shop found in the [[Frontierland]] of the [[Magic Kingdom]].  Big Al appears on the shop's sign as the spokesperson for the shop which predominately sells plushies and [[Davy Crockett]]-style coonskin caps.  The shop is themed to having been Al's cabin which he later turned into a shop to bank in on the success of the Country Bears.

=== Big Al's Icy Igloo ===
During [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s 1992 "Disney's World Fair" event, Big Al hosted the temporary "Big Al's Icy Igloo" snack stand, which featured an oversized inflatable of the character.

=== The Country Bear Jamboree ===
Big Al appears during the ending of the show, singing "Blood on the Saddle" and threatening the momentum of the show in the process. The other bears start bringing their singing together to counter Al's off-key crooning and eventually drive him off stage.

=== [[Country Bear Vacation Hoedown]] ===
In Country Bear Vacation Hoedown, Big Al sings "I Got Lost On My Way To Your Heart" while wearing camping gear and a miner's helmet. 

=== [[Country Bear Christmas Special]] ===
In the American [[Country Bear Christmas Special|Country Bear&nbsp;Christmas Special]], Big Al dresses up as Baby New Year and sings "Another New Year", while in the Tokyo Disneyland version, he sings "Auld Lang Syne" in a purple suit while lamenting his wife leaving him and taking his beloved hound dog with her. In these versions of the show, the other bears don't seem to have much of a problem with him performing, since they actually let him take part in the finale and sing.

=== [[Goofy's Sky School]] ===
In the queue of Goofy's Sky School at [[Disney California Adventure]], a letter from Big Al and the "Bear Brothers Backwoods Brewery" can be found on a bulletin board. Responding to a letter from Goofy asking if they can make some cheap fuel out of moonshine, Al has offered him a few batches while warning him that it hasn't been tested for machines and can pack a wallop.

=== Hot Pop-Corn ===
A miniature figure of Big Al turns a popcorn crank in Tokyo Disneyland.

=== [[Main Street Cinema]] ===
Outside of the Main Street Cinema is a posting from the [[Disneyland Casting Agency|''Disneyland Casting Agency'']].  This advert reads as, "''Openings for Talented Bears: Sought for [[Country Bear Jamboree|Country Western Musical]]. Must play an instrument. Singing experience preferred. Trainers contact Big Al at C.B. Playhouse''".

A storybook released to coincide with the opening of [[Walt Disney World]] in [[1971]], ''Big Al Moves In'' tells of how Al came to live and perform with the Country Bears.

Riding the truck, he ends up at Walt Disney World, where nobody bats an eye at him for being a talking bear. He makes his way to Grizzly Hall in Frontierland and meets the other Country Bears, who offer him a job performing with them and a place to stay.
