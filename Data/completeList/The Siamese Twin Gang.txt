'''The Siamese Twin Gang''' are two Siamese cats that own a laundromat and an illegal underground casino. Though not major villains, these two characters have been considered as Asian stereotypes due to the fact that they own a laundromat and speak in fractured English. They bear a resemblance to [[Si and Am]] from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. Both of the cats are voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].
