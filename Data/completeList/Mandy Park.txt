'''Mandy Park''' is [[Nick Szalinski|Nick]]'s girlfriend and [[Adam Szalinski|Adam]]'s babysitter in Disney's [[1992]] hit film, ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]''.

== Role in the film ==
Mandy is a girl who frequents the water park that Nick works concessions at. As a result of seeing her often, Nick has developed a crush on her, though she doesn't feel the same way. One day, Nick's father [[Wayne Szalinski|Wayne]] hires her to babysit Nick's little brother [[Adam Szalinski|Adam]] in order to spend some time with Nick, which she agrees to. However, when she arrives, she discovers Adam is now 7 feet tall, and faints at the sight.

Nick is forced to bind and gag her in order to ensure she doesn't panic and alert anybody. To get her to calm down, Nick reveals that Adam has started growing as a result of coming into contact with an [[Szalinski's Growing Machine|experimental growth ray]], and that Wayne and his wife [[Diane Szalinski|Diane]] had gone off to get his father's [[Szalinzki's Shrinking Machine|shrink ray]] to restore him to normal. Unfortunately, adam grows again to 14 feet tall, and escapes the house with Nick and Mandy in pursuit (after Nick promised to double Mandy's payment if she helped). However, they all get taken into custody by [[Dr. Charles Hendrickson]] and [[Clifford Sterling]], only for Adam to grow again and escape. He then places Nick and Mandy into his overall pocket after mistaking them for toys, and although they manage to escape into a convertible, Adam puts them back in after mistaking it for a toy car.

Fortunately, Adam is successfully shrunken down via a plan devised by Wayne, Diane, and Clifford (who by this point has decided to help Wayne restore his son to normal). However, Nick and Mandy are also shrunken down due to being in Adam's pocket. Wayne finds them shrunken the next morning, but decides to give them a few minutes before undoing the shrinkage. At this point, Nick and Mandy confess their feelings for each other and kiss.

It is unknown if Mandy continued dating Nick after the events of the film.
