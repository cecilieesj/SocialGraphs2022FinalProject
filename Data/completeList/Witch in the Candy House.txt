}}'''The Witch''' is the main antagonist of the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' Cartoon short "[[Hansel and Gretel]]" from 1999. She is a nameless witch who lives in her Lebkuchen House.

==Appearances==
===''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''===
The Witch plays much like the original character of the witch in a musical retelling of the classic fairy tale.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
She appears in the ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' special, as [[Jafar]], as soon as he has taken over the House of Mouse, decides to play the ''Hansel and Gretel'' short (since it ends with Mickey and Minnie running off terrified, and is the closest the villain can get to a cartoon where evil wins).

==Trivia==
*She shares many similarities with The [[Witch (Babes in the Woods)|Witch]] from the Silly Symphony [[Babes in the Woods]], who is also based of the witch from the story of Hansel and Gretel.
*She is opposite to Hazel the Witch.
