Olivia attended Custer's Grove High School, where she developed a relationship with [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]]. John was a football player, and Olivia used to sneak in, before each game to see him. The two eventually got married.

John is later selected by the US Government to become the new Captain America. He is set to do press, starting with his former high school, and Olivia accompanies him. She finds him in the locker room, and questions if he's reliving the glory days. The pair reminisce about their time in high school, and she questions whether he's nervous. He jokingly denies it, then admits the pressures he feels, upon his new status. Olivia advises him to be himself, and tells him that the audience will love him. She wishes him luck, and leaves, just as her schoolmate, and John's partner, [[Battlestar|Lemar Hoskins]], walks in. He asks if John's puked yet, and when she replies he hasn't, she informs him, it's his turn, to talk to him.

When John publicly kills a foreign enemy, Olivia stands by his side in [[Washington]], for his trial. Once its over and John is stripped of his titles, Olivia advises him to visit Lemar's parents. She proceeds to talk about what they can do afterwards, but is interrupted by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who arrives to give John an opportunity to work with her.

Olivia also appears in [[One World, One People|the final episode]] as a smaller role where she is by her husband's side when he is offered help by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Olivia joins John when he is made US. Agent and supports him in this role.
