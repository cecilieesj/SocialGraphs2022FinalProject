'''Peter Thorndyke''' is the main antagonist in ''[[The Love Bug]]''.

==Role in the film==
Peter is a car salesman and race car driver by profession. He owns a European Imported Car dealership and sells [[Herbie]] to [[Jim Douglas]]. He discovered that Jim was winning by Herbie and wanted to dispose of him - by pouring Irish coffee down his fuel tank.

When Tang Wu meets him, Peter bargins with him if he wins, Peter can have Herbie. But if Jim wins, Tang can have his shop, and Jim won. Peter is now a mechanic in Tang's Car Shop. Despite his villainous character, he appears to be a very skilled racing driver, finishing behind only Jim in the various races in the movie. He also wins the race before the El Dorado event.

Peter's most famous car is a yellow GT car he calls the "[[Thorndyke Special]]", which is actually an Apollo 3500 GT. He also drives a Ferrari and a Jaguar in various races in the film.

Although never specifically mentioned in the film, Peter appears to be British, as he speaks with a thick British accent.
