|quote = }}'''Elaine Perigrew'''Â is Doug's art teacher in [[Disney's Doug|Disney's ''Doug'']]. She gushes even over the simplest form of art the moment she sees it, and in one episode of the Nickelodeon series, she mistakenly gave Doug the credit for the hand-painted drawing, that turned out to be the back of Doug's landscape painting that was covered by [[Porkchop]] and a raccoon chasing each other.
She is voiced by [[Fran Brill]].
