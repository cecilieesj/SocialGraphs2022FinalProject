The '''Herald''' is a minor character in the [[1950]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''. He is mostly bald and wears a white wig.

==Appearances==
===''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''===
He is first seen delivering the invitations to the Royal Ball. He later accompanies the [[The Grand Duke|Grand Duke]] in finding the girl whose footÂ fits into the [[Glass Slipper|glass slipper]]. His job is to carry the slipper, and to try it on the young ladies' feet. When the slipper won't fit [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]]'s foot, she kicks his head into the piano keys. He also tries to make the slipper fit [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]]'s foot, which it doesn't. As he and the Grand Duke are about to leave, [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] rushes downstairs to the Duke. [[Lady Tremaine]], in her determination to keep Cinderella from having a happy ending that her own daughters won't have, trips the Herald bearing the glass slipper, causing it to smash. Luckily, Cinderella has the other slipper, which is fitted by the Grand Duke.

===''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''===
He makes a cameo in the beginning when bringing the slipper to the Tremaine's house, but he doesn't appear throughout the rest of the film.

===''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''===
He appeared in the episode "[[Disney on Parade (episode)|Disney on Parade]]" in the Cinderella section.
