==Appearances==
===''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''===
Lulubelle comes upon Bongo after his failed attempt to catch a fish for breakfast. Bongo instantly falls in love with her, thinking that it's too good to be true, but their interlude is cut short by the appearance of [[Lumpjaw]], who wants Lulubelle to himself. Lulubelle tries to assert the fact that she loves Bongo by slapping his cheeks, but Bongo mistakenly regards it as her dumping him and walks away brokenhearted with Lumpjaw having Lulubelle to himself. But when Bongo sees a couple of other bears showing their love by slapping each other, he realizes that Lulubelle really loved him after all and rushes back to save her from Lumpjaw. Near the end of the battle, after Bongo and Lumpjaw fell in the waterfall, Lulubelle cries, thinking that Bongo is dead, but he managed to survive. Bongo slaps Lulubelle for his love towards him and Lulubelle the same. The film ends on Bongo and Lulubelle climbing up a pair of trees that bend into the shape of a heart.

===[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]===
Lulubelle was a fairly common character at the Disney Parks, usually appearing alongside Bongo. Both she and Bongo have been retired since the early [[1990|'90s]].

==Trivia==
*In the ''Bongo'' comics, Lulubelle is absent for undisclosed reasons, showing only [[Bongo the Bear|Bongo]], [[Lumpjaw]], and various forest animals thereof.
*In the 1948 Golden Book based on the segment, Lulubelle is explicitly described as only a friend to Bongo, resulting that Golden Books wanted to reduce the romantic themes for the younger readers.
*Lulebelle's original names were "Suzie" and "Silverear"
*In the original story, there is a bear named '''Silver Ear''' who grabs Bongo's attention, however she dislikes his civilized ways. She ends up mating with Lump Jaw and savagely shoos Bongo away. At the end of the story, Bongo ends up with another bear from another circus.
