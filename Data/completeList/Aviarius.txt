==History==
He is an enemy of [[Team Go]] with an extensive collection of bird minions and bird-based gadgets such as the "Flamingo of Doom" and the "Heat-Seeking Hummingbirds." His secret lair, "the Nest," lies upon the peak of Go Mountain, just outside of Go City. He imprisoned the [[Wego Twins|Wego twins]] there and stole their powers in an attempt to lure [[Shego]] and [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] (who Aviarius had accidentally transferred the powers of [[Hego]] to) to his lair to steal their powers as well and from that point own "the complete set" of Team Go's powers.

==Trivia==
* He is likely a parody of the ''Spider-Man'' villain Adrian Toomes, AKA the Vulture.
*With his bird theme weaponry and appearance, Aviarius is similar to Penguin from Batman's rogue gallery.
