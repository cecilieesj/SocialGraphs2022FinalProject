==History==
She is a former cleaning lady who worked at a research lab. One day she accidentally inhaled the fumes of an experimental bathroom disinfectant. The fumes had a strange effect on her and turned her into a cleaning-obsessed villain. She was later recruited by [[F.O.W.L.]] for their dastardly plans. She hates, and is even afraid of, dirt. She has a sister named [[Ample Grime]], also a F.O.W.L. agent.

Ammonia Pine appears as the primary villain in only one episode--"[[Dirty Money]]" (the third episode in production order). Her other two appearances, "[[Cleanliness is Next to Badliness]]" and "[[Dirtysomething]]", featured her paired with [[Steelbeak]] and Ample Grime respectively. She also makes cameo appearances in "[[Ghoul of My Dreams]]", "[[In Like Blunt]]" and "[[Time and Punishment]]".

===Comics===
Ammonia Pine never actually appeared in any of the ''Darkwing Duck'' comics published when the show was originally airing (though her outfit was among the villains' costumes seen having gained sentience in the ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' story "Vogue's Gallery!"). She finally appeared in the comics in the form of a brief cameo in "[[Crisis on Infinite Darkwings]]", the second arc of the ''[[Darkwing Duck (Boom! Studios)|Darkwing Duck]]'' comic by [[Boom! Studios]]. She later appears alongside fellow F.O.W.L. agents [[Hotshot and Flygirl]] in "[[F.O.W.L. Disposition]]". In that arc, she manages to capture [[Gosalyn Mallard|Gosalyn]] and [[Honker Muddlefoot|Honker]] but ends up getting turned into a pile of mud by [[Morgana Macawber]].

Ammonia reappears in the ''DuckTales''/''Darkwing Duck'' crossover story "[[Dangerous Currency]]", with no explanation of how she returned to her normal form, where she is a member of the "League of Eve-il" along with [[Magica De Spell]], [[Cinnamon Teal]], and [[Camille Chameleon]]. They form an alliance with the [[Phantom Blot]], the Fearsome Four, and the [[Beagle Boys]]. They later merge with [[Negaduck]] when it is revealed that he is the source of the evil slime Magica and the Blot have been using to take over Duckburg and St. Canard (strangely, Ammonia, neat freak that she is, doesn't seem to care about the slime making everything dirty), but they are all ultimately sucked into the [[Wasteland]]. However, the crossover, which was not approved by Disney, is considered non-canon.

Canonically, Ammonia's next and last appearance was in "[[Orange is the New Purple]]", in which she is revealed to be incarcerated in St. Canard's new maximum-security prison. After Negaduck traps Darkwing inside the prison and lets all the villains loose from their cells, he encounters Ammonia waxing the floors and slides past her, leaving her to get consumed by an attacking [[Muckduck]], who he was on the run from.

== Trivia ==
* Her name is, of course, a reference to the cleaning chemical Ammonia (NH3) which is used to clean porcelain, glass, and steel surfaces without leaving streaks. The surname, Pine, was most likely chosen for the fact that some cleaning products famously use a pine scent such as ''Pine-Sol'', ''Pinalen,'' and ''Pine-O-Pine''.
* Her behavior and weakness seem to imply that she might have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
* Despite being one of the few recurring members of F.O.W.L., Ammonia did not reappear in the ''DuckTales'' reboot.
