'''Sydney''' is a character on [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[That's So Raven]]''.

She is a girl at Bayside Community Center, whom [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] mentors. When they first meet, Sydney embarrasses Raven by constantly insulting her. However, when Raven learns that Sydney is a foster child, they quickly develop a friendship. Sydney is an aspiring comedian, and she even "performed" at [[Cory Baxter|Cory]]'s "bro mitzvah" in the episode "[[Raven, Sydney and the Man]]". Raven and Sydney are now very close friends, and even enter a Little Miss and Her Big Sis pageant. Raven and Sydney are often compared as sisters, although they are not actually related. In the episode "[[Rae of Sunshine]]", Sydney has trouble making friends so she embarrasses Raven again, but then at the end, she makes friends without embarrassing Raven.{{CharacterStub}}
