==Background==
===Personality===
PR-T is a robotic hairdresser aboard the [http://pixar.wikia.com/Axiom Axiom] and due to the fact that she has a supportive voice chip inside, she is very talkative with some automatic flattery. Her main catchphrase is: "You look gorgeous!" when she beautifies any customer who doesn't have to be human.

=== Physical description ===
Around her body are multiple arms that have a lighter shade of pink than her body and her bottom is nearly white. Sometimes she can move her head for lookouts.

===Powers and abilities===
PR-T can rotate her body to exchange the number of arms that hold these known grooming items:
*Pink [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick lipstick]
*Blush
*Curling iron
*Eye shadow
*Hair tweezers
*Mascara
*Nail polish
*Powder sponge
*Scissors
*Toothbrush
*Electric shaver
*Nail buffing stick
The circle-shaped mirror is the only non-grooming item that she holds in her arm and it's also used to deflect beams. When she opens her head, she reveals a hairbrush.

==Role in the film==
There are plenty of PR-T robots in the Axiom. About 16 of them work in the BNL beauty shop beautifying customers. Two of the same bot work at the lobby desk. One is very loyal to [[Captain B. McCrea]] who is stuck in boredom and another with the red boot is a reject robot who is confined to the [http://pixar.wikia.com/Repair_Ward Repair Ward], encounters [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] and follows his favorite music. She is one of the malfunctioning robots to be accidentally freed by him. Confronted by many Stewards that [[AUTO]] has summoned by pressing buttons and shocked while putting on pink blush, she is the first malfunctioning robot to attack them by reflecting the Stewards' tractor beams when two of them restrains [[EVE]]'s arm. After HAN-S defeats all the Stewards, PR-T, [[M-O]] and all the other malfunctioning robots resume following EVE who carries the weak WALL-E to the Lido Deck and allow her to put the plant in the holo-detector. In the middle of the mission, PR-T, M-O and all the other malfunctioning robots are pushed aside due to the tilting of the Axiom by the autopilot. At one point, she beautifies one of the people before a lot of them get up. As a result of WALL-E being severely crushed, all these other robots and all the human passengers mourn him on the way to return to Earth. Near the end, she is seen beautifying [[WALL-E Transport Vehicle|WALL-E's truck]] after being surprised about his love to EVE. In the credits, she helps a crew make a campfire to keep people warm. She also builds a big building with a Steward who holds bricks with his tractor beam and one WALL-A robot who supports him.
