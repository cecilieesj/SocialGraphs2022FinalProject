'''Persephone''' is the Greek Goddess of Eternal Spring in the [[1934]] [[Silly Symphony]] animated short, ''[[The Goddess of Spring]]''. Her abduction to the underworld by the dark lord, Pluto, and return to her beloved mother was the ancient Greeks' way of explaining the turning of the seasons.

In ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', she doesn't appear. However, her story and romantic relation with Hades are attribued to [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena the Wicked Witch of the West]].

She does not appear in the ''Hercules'' franchise'','' thus making Hades a bachelor.
