'''Mr. Jones''' is [[Ronald Tompkins|Ron Tompkins]]' pet iguana and the former secondary antagonist of ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''.

==Background==
===Personality===
Despite being an iguana, Mr. Jones acts more like a dog. He follows his training by his master [[Ronald Tompkins|Ron]] closely, even inadvertently exposing his toy-napping scheme to [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]] and [[Mrs. Anderson|her mother]] by doing so. However, his loyalty to Ron is presumably discarded when he is sent to the iguana sanctuary and thus no longer has any animosity for any toys that he used to abduct for his owner.

==Appearances==
===''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''===
Mr. Jones is a pet iguana owned by [[Ronald Tompkins|Ron]], the manager of [[Sleep Well]]. Ron trained him to retrieve toys from visitors and bring them to his office, where he placed them in a basket and rang a bell to alert Ron.

When [[Bonnie Anderson]] and [[Mrs. Anderson|her mother]] arrived at the hotel for the night, Mr. Jones, after a period of time, brought the entire toy gang along with [[Combat Carl]] and [[Jessie]] (whom Mr. Jones found hiding behind a shower curtain that he slashed with his claws), eating one of [[Mr. Potato Head]]'s arms in the process. After Mr. Jones rang Ron's bell to alert the owner of his success, Ron praised his pet lizard before locking Jessie in a cabinet with the other stolen toys.

Mr. Jones then proceeded to rest until he saw Jessie (who managed to escape) sneaking toward the curtain hiding Ron's scheme. He attacked her, but after she noticed Mr. Potato Head's arm and Combat Carl's hand (which Mr. Jones had eaten sometime before the main events of the story) in the back of his mouth, she kicked the lizard's stomach, forcing him to cough up Combat Carl's hand, then pushed her head and arm inside his mouth, retrieving Mr. Potato Head's arm before escaping.

With the help of Mr. Potato Head's arm, Jessie tricked Mr. Jones into yanking off Ron's curtain, revealing his scheme to Bonnie and her mother. After Jessie froze because of the presence of the humans, Mr. Jones retrieved her and brought her to the basket before ringing Ron's bell, further exposing his owner. Later, Ron fed him with a dog dish, which he proceeded to eat, just as two police officers arrived to arrest his owner for theft. It is unknown what happened to him afterward, although according to the commentary on the DVD, he was to be sent to live in an iguana sanctuary called Iguanaland.

==Trivia==
*According to director [[Angus MacLane]], Mr. Jones has a missing scale on his left breast, in allusion to the great dragon Smaug from Tolkien's ''[[wikipedia:The Hobbit|The Hobbit]]''.<ref>https://twitter.com/AngusMacLane/status/414064851397251072</ref> Incidentally, a film adaptation of ''[[wikipedia:The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' featuring Smaug was released around the same time as ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''.
*The model for Mr. Jones was recycled for a giant lizard kaiju in a monster movie [[Dash Parr|Dash]] watches on the motel television in ''[[Incredibles 2]]''.
*Mr. Jones is one of the few non-toy ''Toy Story'' characters who know toys can come to life.
