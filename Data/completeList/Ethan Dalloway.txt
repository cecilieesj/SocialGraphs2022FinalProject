Ethan was a warlock, and one of the few students from Halloweentown to go to high school in the mortal world. He travels to the mortal world as part of an experiment to live among mortals, and plays a rival of Marnie in the third installment, but after changing to turning against his own father to become good.

===''Return to Halloweentown''===
He becomes Marnie's love interest in the fourth installment. He is supposedly a warlock, but in the 4th movie says he renounced his powers after his father lost his to the Halloweentown Council. He is now a mortal like the Sinister sisters who also lost their powers because their father worked for the Dominion, but he and Marnie appear to continue their relationship. Ethan's father also worked for the Dominion once upon a time. At the end of the fourth installment, Ethan and Marnie are a couple and begin dating regularly.
