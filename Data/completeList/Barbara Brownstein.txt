Barbara visited the S.S Tipton in the episode, "Flowers and Chocolate". She started dating Bob, Zack and Cody's friend, sometime after Zack and Cody had left for the S.S. Tipton. When Barbara arrives on the ship, she is afraid to tell Cody about her relationship with Bob, thinking that he is still in love with her. However, Barbara is unaware that Cody has fallen in love with Bailey.

When Barbara meets Cody, she eventually tells him that she is dating Bob. Feeling jealous, Cody lies and tells Barbara that he is dating Bailey. Barbara suggests that they double-date, and Cody reluctantly agrees. They go to see a movie being played on the ship.

They both find out the truth. Bailey and Barbara become upset and they both leave. Cody isn't seen apologizing to Barbara, but he does apologize to Bailey. Cody and Barbara do make up however.
