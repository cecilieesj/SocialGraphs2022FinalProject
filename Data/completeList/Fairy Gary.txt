'''Fairy Gary''' is the overseer of the dust-talent fairies from Disney's [[2009]] film [[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]], sequel to the 2008 film ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]'', prequel to the ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'' saga.

==Background==
Fairy Gary has a big brown mustache, hair and eyebrows, and a rather large nose. He speaks in a Scottish accent and wears a kilt. Other dust-talent fairies and sparrowmen referred to his kilt as a "skirt," which caused him some embarrassment. All the same, he and the other Dust-Talent fairies like to tease [[Terence]] about having a crush on [[Tinker Bell]].

Fairy Gary is proud of his collection of teacups. Each cup in his collection holds an equivalent of one cup of pixie dust. He especially likes the cup that is actually a teacup from a doll's tea set on the mainland.

Although Fairy Gary spends a lot of his time in the Pixie Dust Depot, he has his little jobs to do just like any other fairy or sparrowman. Occasionally an object - usually something small like a button, but once a whole cart - falls into the Pixie Dust Well. When this happens Fairy Gary dons his suit, which is similar to a scuba diver's suit, and goes into the well to fish the object out.
==Appearances==

===''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]''===
At the beginning of the movie, he is overlooking the tinkers fairies' work, and also has a brief conversation with Terence. Later in the movie he helps carry a pixie dust holder during the Autumn Revelry.

===''[[Pixie Hollow Games]]''===
Fairy Gary is shown at the time where all the teams are announced. Fairy Gary and [[Terence]] are partners for the Dust Keeping talents. Fairy Gary flies out holding the flag and shouts "Dust Keeper Pride!" while Terence stays toward the ground covering his legs, since they are both wearing kilts.

===''[[The Pirate Fairy]]''===
Fairy Gary is against [[Zarina]]’s curiosity and desire on experimenting on [[Pixie Dust]], stating it's forbidden to do so by Dust keepers as it's too powerful and dangerous. 

However, despite his orders, Zarina secretly keeps experimenting on Pixie Dust using Blue dust and certain ingredents which created colored Pixie Dust with the abilities of specifical fairy talents, but while experimenting with pink pixie dust, she accidentally pours it over a sapling which grows out of control and destroys the Pixie depot, to his surprise, he notices the pink dust over the plant and quickly realizes it was made by Zarina, who apologetically offered to repair all the damage done, but Fairy Gary had enough and reminded her that he told her she shouldn't have tampered with the dust and and prohibits her from being a dust keeper, saying it was too dangerous, which devasts Zarina, who sadly takes her experiments and runs away from Pixie Hollow.

One year later, Fairy Gary is seen at the coliseum watching the Winter fairies performing, when Zarina (who has joined the Neverland Pirates), uses her pink dust to bloom poppies which put almost everyone at the coliseum to sleep to steal the Blue Pixie dust. 

After Tink and her friends, including a reformed Zarina retrieve the stolen Blue dust, they use Zarina's colored Pixie dust to wake up the other fairies two days later, including Fairy Gary who was happy to see Zarina again and warmly embraced her, having forgiven her earlier incident, and just when Zarina was going to promise him not to tamper with Pixie Dust again, Tink and her friends mentioned Zarina has mastered her ability on Pixie Dust and that she was able to grew another Pixie dust tree on Skull Rock, which impressed Fairy Gary and asked Zarina if her new talent had a name, to which Zarina called it "Pixie Dust Alchemy".

At the coliseum, Zarina restaured her friends' original talents with her alchemy, who made a grand performance, impressing the other fairies.
