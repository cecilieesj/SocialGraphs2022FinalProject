==Trivia==
*When Beary Barrington makes a deal about giving the Country Bear tour bus to "Cha-Cha" if Zeb Zoober loses a music duel with her bar house band, Roadie mentions that the bus was a place where he raised his kids, which is possible to conclude that he was married to an unknown wife and had some kids, nevertheless, it is unknown as to what happened to his family; either they left him after the band broke up, vice versa, or the wife passed away and the kids grew up.
