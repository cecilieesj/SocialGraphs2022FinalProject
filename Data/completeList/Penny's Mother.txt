== Personality ==
Penny's Mother is a kind, love hearted woman who loves her daughter so much and is willing to protect her no matter what. She even cares about Bolt too regardless if he goes missing, telling her daughter that he still loves her so much, and will always be there for her. 

== Role in the [[Bolt (film)|film]] ==
She is the mother of [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]] (as her name suggests). Her real name is unknown. She knows how Penny feels about [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]] and tries to stand up for her when her daughter's [[agent]] pushes the two apart. When Bolt went missing due to believing that Penny is kidnapped by Calico in the show, she comforts her daughter by saying that Bolt loves her and that he isn't scared in the world outside the studio and helps her to make "Lost Dog" flyers. When the studio caught fire, she was the only one that noticed her daughter missing and tried to find her.

After Bolt saved Penny and the two were placed in the ambulance, her worries were not helped when the agent believes they could use the incident for publicity. Disgusted with the agent's complete lack of care for Penny's well-being (and fed up with everything the studio's put her daughter and Bolt through), she angrily throws him out, telling him the three of them quit and slams the door in the callous jerk's face.

She and her daughter adopt [[Mittens]] and [[Rhino]] when they discovered the two at the hospital. After Penny and Bolt recover, they move to a rural home, where she grows very close to their new cat and hamster, and became close like a family with the pets.

==Trivia==
* Since [[Penny (Bolt)|Penny]]'s real father is not seen in the film, it is unknown if Penny's mother is divorced or widowed.
*She could’ve been charged with assault for pushing the Agent out of the ambulance.
