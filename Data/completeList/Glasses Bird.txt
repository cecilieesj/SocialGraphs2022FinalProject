The '''Glasses Bird''' is a character from the [[1951]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. It is one of the first creatures from [[Tulgey Wood]] who appears onscreen which Alice encounters at the aforementioned area.

==Background==
The Glasses Bird, as its name implies, is an eyeglass-like creature with a pair of tips used as its legs, a beak between its two eyes (hence its name), and a pair of dark blue eyes with tiny black pupils on both of its lenses. When Alice first encounters it, the Glasses Bird lands on Alice and lands in front of her face curiously to which as Alice doesn't notice that she is wearing it, she approaches the Mirror Bird where the Glasses Bird appears on the former's face via reflection. Despite its name, the Glasses Bird does not resemble any existing species of bird at all, despite having a beak.

==Appearances==

===''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''===
The Glasses Bird is one of the first creatures which [[Alice]] encounters in [[Tulgey Wood]] along with the Mirror Bird. Amongst the various eyes seen above the sign, the Glasses Bird leaps onto the sign and approaches Alice who is curiously exploring Tulgey Wood and as it lands in front of her face, Alice approaches the Mirror Bird and as Alice approaches it, she sees the Glasses Bird on the Mirror Bird's reflection just as the latter smiles to see Alice wearing the Glasses Bird just as Alice tells them, "No more nonsense" just as Alice suddenly walks into an area where a family of [[Horn Ducks]] is sleeping, much to the Glasses Bird and Mirror Bird feeling worried. Two additional Glasses Birds are later seen approaching Alice who is singing "[[Very Good Advice]]" where two of them and the other creatures of Tulgey Wood approach her singing. Soon as Alice cries, another Glasses Bird also cries (with its eyes making a sad expression) and tearfully reacts to Alice who is lost in Tulgey Wood alongside an Umbrella Vulture and two [[Hammer and Pencil Birds|Hammer Birds]] who are also tearfully reacting to Alice just as the Glasses Bird and the other creatures of Tulgey Wood suddenly disappear. The Glasses Birds make no further appearances throughout the rest of the film.

===''[[Bonkers]]''===
In the ''Bonkers'' episode "[[Color Me Piquel]]", two toon characters use a design similar to the Glasses Bird from the ''Alice in Wonderland'' film consisting of a mother and a son. The mother eyeglass toon has green rims and wears a pink bow and has yellow legs and a beak while her son is another eyeglass toon who has the same colored legs and beak as his mother except with a pair of red rims. Throughout the episode, [[Bonkers D. Bobcat|Bonkers]] and [[Lucky Piquel]] manage to help find the missing son who was kidnapped by [[Warris and Donald|two malicious toons]] and reunite him back to his mother.

In the Fantasyland hub of the discontinued video game, one of the costumes which the player could choose is Alice wearing the Glasses Bird as her eyeglasses based by the moment of Alice's encounter with the Glasses Bird from the ''Alice in Wonderland'' film. This costume was one of the tasks part of [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]]'s storyline and when the player customizes Alice with the Glasses Bird, she comments that she had never seen spectacles like these before, completing the task.
