'''Cassie''' is a character in ''[[Halloweentown High]]''. She's a witch and one of the transfer students in the film. With the exception of her old friend [[Ethan Dalloway]], Cassie is the only one of the transfer students to not need to disguise herself with a magical costume, only wear appropriate clothing for attending a mortal high school.

When she first meets [[Marnie Piper|Marnie]] and [[Dylan Piper|Dylan]], the first impression given about her is that she's energetic, inquisitive, and a bit dense; she openly asked if they were humans, something that would be a dead give away that she wasn't.

[[Edgar Dalloway]] later sealed her in a Witch's glass to help instigate things by causing a disapearance. Gwen later found and freed her, allowing Cassie to join her friends in the haunted house. Once the [[Halloweentown Council|Council]] decided that there was no threat to [[Halloweentown (place)|Halloweentown]] anymore, Cassie joined everyone at the fair for fun.

==Trivia==

*She is not shown using her powers despite being a witch.
