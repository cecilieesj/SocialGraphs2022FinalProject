Shirin is a close family-friend to Sana Ali. She becomes associated with her family, including Sana's daughter, [[Muneeba Khan|Muneeba]].

When she learns that Muneeba's son, [[Aamir Khan|Aamir]] will be getting married, she flies to [[New Jersey]], to attend the ceremony. She arrives at the Khan Residence, where the mehndi party is being held. While she's sitting down, Muneeba greets her, happy to see that she's arrived. Shirin think nothing of making the journey for a friend, and Muneeba assures that she's more than a friend. Shirin expresses her sympathy, in learning that Sana couldn't make it to the wedding, and how hard it must be for Muneeba, not having her mother present to celebrate with her. Muneeba dismisses her mothers attitude as typical, not expecting her to attend, as she wasn't present for her own wedding. Shirin comforts her by letting Muneeba know, it's probably for the best as there will be less drama, and comments on the eternal struggle between mothers and daughters. She looks over to [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], who is sitting besides them, and asks that she make sure she not give her mother any trouble, which Kamala laughs off. When Gabe hides all of Aamir's shoes, Shirin laughs along with the crowd.
