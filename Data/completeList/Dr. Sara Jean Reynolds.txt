==Role in the film==
Sara is first seen outside of [[Medfield College]]. She tells Philip that their wedding is today and also tells him to be there tonight as he promises.

However, Philip is too busy doing his latest experiment which makes him break the promise to Sara, and she becomes heartbroken after he discovers a green goo-like thing called [[Flubber (character)|Flubber]] and studies it along with his hovering robot assistant, [[Weebo]], for the entire night.

That morning, she became really upset at Philip for not showing up at the third wedding and angrily tells him that their relationship is over. As he tests his car with the Flubber experiment, he realizes that his old assistant, [[Wilson Croft]], begins a relationship with her.

Weebo tells Philip to tell her the truth. After he begins another test using the effects of Flubber on a basketball, he uses the fluid and sprays it on one of the basketball player's shoes and tests it out. Weebo goes to Sara's house to tell her the truth as she reconciles with Philip.

Philip begins to demonstrate Flubber's abilities to Sara. After Hoenicker's assistants, Wesson and Smith, destroy Philip's lab, steal Flubber, and destroy Weebo with a baseball bat. Sara then asks Philip if she can be fixed. He tells Sara that although he can repair her body, he cannot “bring back the life it was she had”, meaning that she would just be another mindless machine with no memory of her previous life.

She and Philip avenge Weebo's death and retrieve Flubber to battle Wilson, Bennett, and Hoenicker.

After she and Philip get Flubber back and raise enough money to save the college, they are married as Flubber becomes their son and Weebo's daughter, [[Weebette]], takes her place as their daughter as they head to [[Hawaii]] in Philip's car at the end of the film.
