'''Bastion''' (sometimes spelled '''Bastian''') is a deleted character from ''[[Tangled]]'', then known as ''Rapunzel''. He was intended to be the deuteragonist.

==Role in the film==
Bastion was originally the love interest of [[Rapunzel]]. In the film's original plot, young Bastion was orphaned at a young age and grows up to become a thief to make ends meet. Unlike [[Flynn Rider]], Bastion despised his lifestyle and wanted to go straight. His only companion was a basset hound named [[Beau]] (a character carried over from another version of ''Tangled'' called ''Rapunzel Unbraided''). He mostly got by with his large intimidating appearance though, deep down, he was a sensitive man.

He was to be in league with two other thieves, one named Crowley and another unnamed one. They worked for Griffol, who was an aristocrat working for the [[King Frederic|king]] and [[Queen Arianna|queen]], but secretly planned to usurp them.

Bastion ends up finding Rapunzel's tower and falls in love with her and would have to convince her to leave the tower over 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the way through the film.

The name Bastion would still be kept for quite some time even when the design began to move more closely to his final appearance as seen in the film.

==Trivia==
*Bastion's design would later be loosely recycled for [[Kristoff]] in ''[[Frozen]]''.
*Bastion was affectionately referred to in passing as "Bear Flynn" by the story team and it is a nickname adopted by the fan community as well.
