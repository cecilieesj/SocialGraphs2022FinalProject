This Latin-style trio consisted of a tomato playing bongos, an eggplant playing maracas, and Mr. Broccoli playing a xylophone.

They sang the song "[[Veggie, Veggie, Fruit, Fruit]]" along with [[The Fiesta Fruit]] and [[Bonnie Appetite]].

The Colander Combo, sans their performing outfits, would appear in the 1984 educational film [[Harold and His Amazing Green Plants]] to teach the title character about how plants grow.

==Trivia==
*Mr. Broccoli (who would occasionally flip off his sunglasses and shout "Cha-cha-cha!") became the most popular character in the show, similar to how [[Big Al]] did in the [[Country Bear Jamboree]].
*Broccoli & Co., the gift shop that was located near the show's exit, was named after Mr. Broccoli.
