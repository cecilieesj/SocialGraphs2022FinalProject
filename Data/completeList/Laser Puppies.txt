The '''Laser Puppies''' are eight little puppies with laser eyes that appear in the [[Disney XD]] animated series, ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''. They were created by Star's wand when she first moved in with the Diaz family. The puppies became Marco's pets as he was the one who cared for them the most. Because of their laser eyes, they were usually the only dogs at the dog park due to all the other dogs running in fear with their owners. They love their daily walk, even when it's a raging rainstorm outside the Diaz's house.

==Trivia==
*In the episode "[[My New Wand!]]" one of the laser puppies is named Sajak.
*[[Daron Nefcy]] confirmed in a Reddit Q&A that following the events of "[[Cleaved]]", the puppies are now just regular puppies.
*Seeing as how the puppies were created by Star, it can be inferred that she is technically their "mother" and were "birthed" by her wand.
