The '''Yeti''', or the "'''Abominable Snowman'''", is a cryptid said to live in the [[Himalayas]] of Central [[Asia]].

It has appeared in various [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] media, most prominently in the theme parks and is usually depicted as a ferocious territorial beast. The most well known and recurring Disney incarnation of the creature is the one from the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] attraction at [[Disneyland]], known by the nickname of '''Harold'''.

==History==
===Background===
====Matterhorn Bobsleds====
Nicknamed Harold, this yeti is a resident of the [[Matterhorn]] mountain in the [[Switzerland|Swiss alps]]. It is unknown how or when the yeti would have done so (especially considering it is a cryptid from the Himalayas) but it is known to be deeply and violently territorial.

Over the course of its life in the Matterhorn it has seen a large number of human intruders. This includes humans in bobsleds, the Wells mountaineering expedition, Swiss natives with alphorns, and even [[Skyway|skyway buckets]] pass through its domain. Many of these were violently attacked by the yeti's hand and used to decorate its lair within the mountain.

====[[Expedition Everest]]====
Nicknamed '''Betty the Yeti''' or '''the''' '''Disco-Yeti''' by guests, this yeti is the legendary guardian of the Himalayan mountains, said to reside in the Forbidden Mountain. It is unclear to what extent the yeti is a mythical protector and to what extent it is simply an animal, but regardless it causes harm to those which dare disturb the Forbidden Mountain.

In the village of Serka Zong at the mountain's base, an old train line originally belonging to the Royal Anandapur Tea Company was constructed through the Himalayas. However, the train lines closed in the first place due to incidents in the 1930s where the Yeti attacked the trains moving through its territory in the Forbidden Mountain.

Since this time, many journeyed to the forbidden mountain and many had claimed encounters with the feared yeti. Notably there was the League of Adventurers which tried to build passages through the mountain in the 1930s. Additionally there was the, "Lost expedition" which had its camp found in shatters with a broken camera containing blurred photos of the yeti.

The tea trains were re-opened by Himalayan Escapes, a tourism company hoping to use the trains as transport to the Base Camp at Mount Everest. However when the trains once more became active, so too did the yeti's wrath.

===Development History===
====The Cryptid====
In real-life, the Yeti is a legendary ''cryptid'' (animal/being of unconfirmed/dubious existence) which is said to inhabit the mountains of Himalayas. It originates from the folklore and myths of the Himalayan region which have been active for centuries with it traditionally being referred to as: ''g.ya' dred, Yachê'', and ''g.ya''' which would later be anglicized as, "Yeti". Most traditional names referencing the creature being comparable to a bear or a legendary hybrid of man and bear, specifically the Himalayan brown-bear.

In 1921, a group of British mountaineering military officers coined the term, "The Abominable Snowman" in reference to a series of large tracks found in the snows, resembling those of a giant human or bear footprint. According to the British documents, their sherpa proposed the tracks might have belonged to, "Metoh-kangmi" which the British took to mean, "Abominable Snowman" while in reality it translated to, "Man-Bear of the Snows". The iconography of the yeti as an, "Ape-Man" was largely manufactured by Western pop-culture due to a trend of colonists altering regional cultural traditions into said caveman-like monsters (E.G., the Sasq’ets cultural practice of nomadism of indigenous [[Canada]] being reinterpreted as the monstrous [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]]).

Following this, interest in the yeti grew which lead to large amounts of media regarding religious objects such as a yeti scalp, yeti hand-bone, yeti fur, yeti feces, and even a yeti mummy being in possession of Tibetan religious organizations. When tested for DNA, the bones came back as belonging to Himalayan brown bears, the mummy as being of a Himalayan brown-bear, most of the fur/hair as belonging to Himalayan brown-bears with the infrequent yak hair, teeth belonging to the atheistic black-bear, and the scalp being made from an elk or fox-hide. It should be noted that atheistic black-bears and Himalayan brown bears are both native to the region, live in high altitudes, have many bones virtually identical to human bones (namely their claws), and can walk on their hind-legs. Furthermore it should also be said that any observation of the yeti or any other fauna of the Himalayas would be altered by intense winds, snows, and the human brain being continuously deprived of oxygen.

====Matterhorn Bobsleds====
The Abominable Snowman was first introduced to the Matterhorn Bobsleds for it's 1977 refurbishment. According to ''The Disney Mountains: Imagineering at its Peak'', plans existed for the creature to be installed as part of the original 1959 attraction, but budget crunches and scheduling deadlines lead the concept to be shelved. Other historical sources have suggested that the original Snowman figures were repurposed from [[Gorilla Raiders|gorilla figures]] originally built for the [[Jungle Cruise]].

New Snowman figures were installed in 2015 as part of Disneyland's 60th Anniversary. This new animatronics presented a more expressive creature with a wider, more fluid range of motion and less aesthetically synthetic design. An additional effect was added to the lift-hill where guests saw a CGI animation of the yeti following them behind transparent ice.

====Expedition Everest====
The Yeti built for Expedition Everest was the culmination of extensive research of the Yeti's role in Nepalese and Tibetan culture and primatology to create a believable animal. These influences included the ''Gigantopithecus'' often cited as a potential identity for large ape cryptids, as well as the snub-nosed langur, a high-altitude monkey living in the mountains of Sichuan. The animatronic figure built for the attraction's final scene would be one of the largest and most advanced Audio-Animatronics figures ever built for a Disney attraction.

Most of the figure's weight would be held up by a slide and boom structure emerging from its back. It was powered by a 3000 psi hydraulic thruster that could be recharged in 20 seconds and the combined thrust of all the figure's linear actuators working together could put out a force equivalent to a jet engine. Because of this, the support base for the figure and it's boom would be kept separate from the structures of the mountain and the ride track. However, problems with this support structure would result in the figure being kept a static "B-Mode" for years.

This B-Mode uses strobe lights and fans to convey movement, a back-up plan that has resulted in fans nicknaming the figure "Disco Yeti". Plans to fix the figure have existed for some time, but with Animal Kingdom's low guest capacity, these have been benched for some time.

==[[Disney Parks]]==

===[[Disneyland]]===

====[[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!]]====
One of the original yeti animatronics from Matterhorn Bobsleds makes a cameo in the queue area of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!]]'' as part of the [[Collector|Tivan]] Collection.

====[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]====
A yeti appears on the Matterhorn Bobsleds at [[Disneyland]] as the main antagonist of the ride. It is sometimes referred to as Harold and it exists as three Audio-Animatronic figures to roar at the riders. One can be seen on both tracks, while the other two can be seen on their respective tracks. In addition to the figures, each track has its own set of glowing red eyes that belong to the monster.

When Harold was first introduced to the attraction in 1978, the marketing campaign focused around the mystery of the monster now lurking in the caves of the Matterhorn Bobsleds. "Fleeting sightings" of the creature put him between seven and nine feet tall, with footprints being measured to be eight inches wide and eighteen inches long, and a thunderous roar being measured 6.9 on the Richter scale. Footprint casts of the Yeti "discovered by Matterhorn mountaineers" were put on display on the queue path around the mountain.

In 2015, to celebrate Disneyland's 60th anniversary, the old yetis were replaced with new ones that move more fluidly and with a less limited range of motion. As the cars go up the initial lift hill, the Yeti also now peers at the guests through thin layers of ice. After roaring a few times, he follows the guests to the peak of the mountain. In both of his appearances as an actual animatronic, he is now hidden behind a few rocks from the waist down.

Though he was initially depicted as attacking riders unprovoked, it was stated that the new incarnation of the yeti is simply trying to protect his environment.

===[[Shanghai Disneyland]]===

====''[[Camp Discovery]]''====
Pictures of the Yeti figure can be seen at Shanghai Disneyland's Camp Discovery attraction, taken from a 1930s expedition by the [[League of Adventurers]] which were trying to help build trails through the Himalayas.

===[[Walt Disney World]]===

====[[Disney's Blizzard Beach|Cross Country Creek]]====
In this Blizzard Beach attraction is an ice-cave containing several cave-etchings of unknown origin. One of these carvings depicts the yeti in-front of the Forbidden Mountains, attacking a pair of humans.

====[[Expedition: Everest]]====
[[File:Expedition-Everest-Yeti-783404.jpg|thumb|250px|Animatronic Yeti figure.]]
The Yeti is, again, the main antagonist of this rollercoaster at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. Its presence can be felt throughout the queue where it is represented with statues, monuments, and even a wood carvings of its foot-print.

The Yeti Museum featured in the attraction's queue also chronicles a failed 1982 expedition to the Forbidden Mountain with blurry photographs of the angry Yeti and the battered remains of the climbers' camp. Despite this evidence and the warnings of the Yeti Museum's curator, Himalayan Escapes does not believe in the Yeti and thinks their rail service is perfectly safe.

After the train sets off, it climbs up the mountain, passing through an ancient temple with artwork of the yeti and many offerings left by the people of the region. At the top, it makes a turn to find the tracks ahead have been torn up by the Yeti. Then the train reverses into a cave (via powerful switches). After going a little ways, the riders see the Yeti's shadow as it starts to tear up more tracks. Soon another set of switches activate and the Yeti's shadow disappears as the train goes down an 80 foot drop. After the train makes a turn at the bottom of the drop, it enters a cave, where riders hear the Yeti's roar. After making two loops outside, the train is then lifted back into the mountain for the last time where riders encounter the yeti face to face.

The vocal effects for the Yeti were provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]].

====[[Skipper Canteen]]====
One of the books found in the Skipper Canteen's library is ''Expedition Everest: The Search for the Yeti'' by [[Harrison Hightower III]]. Hightower being a character from [[Tokyo]]'s incarnation of the [[Tower of Terror]] who is well known for his morally questionable acts of grave-robbing, colonial theft, and big-game hunting. This seems to imply that before his demise in 1899, Hightower attempted to find the yeti, likely to try and put on display in his [[Hotel Hightower|collection]].

In the meta element of the allusion, this is in-reference to Harrison Hightower III's actor being imagineer Joe Rhode who also was the lead developer behind Expedition Everest.

====[[Wilderness Explorers (Animal Kingdom)|Wilderness Explorers]]====
In this attraction, members of the [[Wilderness Explorers]] must learn about the culture of the yeti from locals of Serka Zong to gain a, "Yeti Badge". Said yeti badge depicts the Matterhorn incarnation of the yeti with additional illustrations of the beast being in the Wilderness Explorers guidebook.

====''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''====
A friendly Yeti named Gary appeared as a concierge in the 12th episode, "[[Shangri-La-Di-Da]]" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], alongside an entire resort staff of yetis. As Donald and Daisy arrive at the Shangri-La Resort and Spa, Gary greets the couple to the Himalayas' very own Shangri-La Resort and Spa, explaining that he works as the Resort's concierge, activities coordinator, and licensed behavioral therapist. Seeing Donald and Daisy in front of the desk, he directs the two to enjoy natural resources of Shangri-La.

Gary sings to Donald and Daisy where he introduces the two to the Shangri-La Resort and Spa as a group of Resort staff members who, just like Gary, are all yetis. The yeti staff members participate during the musical number, "[[Shangri-La-Di-Da (song)|Shangri-La-Di-Da]]", to the couple about the activities done at the Resort to which while exploring the Resort, Gary, the head yeti, explains to Donald and Daisy that here at the Shangri-La Resort and Spa, he and the staff members of the Resort treat all problems. Gary then gives out a rule to guests that visitors who stay in Shangri-La must stay there until their problems are taken care of, telling Donald and Daisy to sign if they want to stay and leave Shangri-La as part of the Resort's policy.

Later, the yetis are giving Donald and Daisy a relaxing massage at the Resort where the two apologize to each other. A yeti waiter politely offers Donald a glass of lemon and ambrosia water to which Donald rudely tells him leave him alone. However, it is figured out that Donald's temper is a problem to the Resort staff as the yetis plan to take care of Donald's anger as part of the Resort's policy. As Xandra is looking for Donald and approaches Gary, she requests him to pick up Donald to which Gary explains that Donald is not ready yet because of his temper problems after signing the contract, Donald cannot leave the Resort until all of his problems are solved (especially when it comes to his anger problem). Gary instead decides to interest Xandra in a Himalayan seaweed wrap to which Xandra decides to return to nether New Quackmore Institute at Clinton Coot's cabana.

Gary introduces Donald and Daisy to the group therapy as part of their stay. As the therapy process begins, Daisy gently interacts with the pillow given by Gary while Donald angrily rips it apart where Gary notices Donald having anger problems to which Donald denies followed by Daisy politely asking Donald for a game of croquet to which he denies. Donald and Daisy attempt to leave the Resort, but Gary and the Resort staff cannot allow Donald to leave due to his anger problems and due to the fact that Donald has signed the contract, preventing Donald from leaving until all of his problems are solved (especially his anger problem). Much to Donald's anger, two Resort staff members escort Donald to the Pool of Self-Reflection to help solve his problems.

At the Pool of Self-Reflection, Gary tells Donald to reflect on the depths of his anger in order for him to leave or his anger will make things even worse. As Donald is having trouble dealing with his anger, the yetis watch Donald try to reflect himself. Gary then tells a fellow yeti that Donald reflecting his anger might reflect his perfect success rate. However, as Donald starts calming himself, the reflection of anger suddenly starts weakening, due to Donald's calmness as the yetis feel happy that Donald is starting to take care of his anger issues, finally taking care of his own issues. Gary, the head yeti, congratulates Donald for conquering his anger, which solves his problems and finishes his anger treatment just as the rest of the Resort staff celebrate Donald's success. As a result, Gary finally allows Donald and Daisy to leave, explaining to them that the staff have unlocked the gates so that the two can leave the Resort, but before they can leave, Donald and Daisy must complete Gary's satisfaction survey. As a result, Donald and Daisy reunite happily with each other just before the two leave the Resort as the yetis bid them a farewell as the two arrive at the New Quackmore Institute.

==Trivia==
*In the French dub of ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', [[Bigfoot]] is renamed "the Yeti".
*[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge]] has an homage to the Yeti in ''[[Dok-Ondar]]'s Den of Antiquities'' where a taxidermy Wampa is arranged in a position mirroring the Matterhorn Yeti.
*Unlike most depictions in which it has white fur, the Yeti is described as having brown or reddish-brown fur.
*The yeti is similar to the [[Spirit of Big Thunder|Thunderbird]] from [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]. Namely that they are both Disney Parks characters based on famous cryptids and are renowned of legendary status to locals while being characterized as powerful protectors of their respective mountains.
*''Expedition Everest'''s depiction would be the most accurate to legend, since it is brown rather than white as in other Disney works.
