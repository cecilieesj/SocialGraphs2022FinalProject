[[The Shadow Blot]]}}'''Beetleworx''' are enemies in ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. Originally created as a construction crew for when [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] ruled [[Cartoon Wasteland|Wasteland]], they subsequently became the [[Shadow Blot]]'s Shock Troops when the Blot Wars began.

==Background==
The Beetleworx are built from discarded [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] bits, and are part "painted" and part "inert". Unlike the game's secondary enemies, the [[Blotlings]], using [[Paint|paint]] on them will not make them allies but can gum up their works and slow them down. The Beetleworx can only be defeated by destroying them; doing so in the first game would also fill Mickey's Guardian gauge green, due to [[Thinner|thinning]] out the shell. Models include Tankers, Bashers, Spinners, and Hoppers. Like [[Spatters]], they take on different forms in different areas of Wasteland.

Because Oswald felt Mickey stole his fame and popularity, he was given types of Beetleworx made by the Mad Doctor that looked like Mickey's friends [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]], and [[Goofy]], to make him feel better. These are shown to be very friendly towards Mickey since they were made before the Blot Wars. They have personalities very similar to Mickey's real friends. They are found in pieces scattered through the Wasteland and can either be repaired, in which case they become friends, or left as they are.

===Hoppers===
'''Hoppers''' are the most common variety of Beetleworx, and as their name implies, they hop around the levels and headbutt you. Hoppers are bird-like creatures that take on the form of various birds, such as the [[Buzzie, Flaps, Ziggy, and Dizzy|vultures]] from ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', which can be found in Ventureland and Lonesome Manor, [[Friend Owl]] from ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]'', found in [[Bog Easy]], [[Scuttle]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', found on [[Mickeyjunk Mountain]], and some kind of droid found in [[Tomorrow City]]. A variant based on the devils in [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride|''Mr. Toad's Wild Ride'']] appears in ''Epic Mickey 2''.

===Bashers===
Sword-wielding Beetleworx who attack by spinning their torsos, '''Bashers''' are cybernetic conversions of Disney characters. Some of the pirates of [[Captain Hook]]'s crew in [[Ventureland]] were converted into Bashers, while others were built by the Mad Doctor. Besides the pirate variation in Ventureland, Bashers in Lonesome Manor are designed to resemble skeletons and the ones in Tomorrow City are based on [[Maximilian]] from ''[[The Black Hole]]''. In ''Epic Mickey 2'', another variant based on [[Tik-Tok]] from ''[[Return to Oz]]'' appears in the [[Floatyard]].

===Spinners===
Armed with buzzsaws, '''Spinners''' are spider-like Beetleworx that appear in Tomorrow City and [[Lonesome Manor]]. One variety seems to be modeled after the skeleton spider from the short film "[[The Mad Doctor]]". Another model appears in Tomorrow City, however, its origins, like the Hopper, are unknown. The Tea Cup Spinner can be seen whenever the players revisit the [[Train Tunnels|Clock Tower Diorama]] in '' Epic Mickey 2''.

===Tankers===
'''Tankers''' are the strongest form of Beetleworx. They have heads of different Disney characters, bodies of different vehicles and objects, cannons for arms, and spider legs. Tankers are armed with cannons that can shoot paint and thinner. In Tomorrow City, they take on the appearance of a golden [[Light Cycles|Light Cycle]] from ''[[Tron]]'' for a body and the guards from ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' as a head. In Lonesome Manor and [[Rainbow Caverns]], they appear with the face of [[The Evil Queen|the Wicked Queen]]'s Witch form and the [[Poisoned Apple|poisoned apple]] as a torso.
A third variety appears in the Floatyard, based on [[Ursula]]. There was a scrapped variety with the head of [[Hades]] from ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', the plasma blasters from [[Gantu]]'s ship, and Mickey's car as a body. Despite the fact the Hades Tanker was scrapped, it served as the body design of the other two (not counting the shells). In ''Epic Mickey 2'', however, the scrapped Hades Tanker can be seen whenever the players revisit the [[Train Tunnels|Blot Diorama]].

==Trivia==
*When the pirates are transformed into robots by this process, it bears similarity to [[List of cameos in Wreck-It Ralph|Doctor Eggman]]'s [[w:c:sonic:Roboticizer|roboticizer]] from ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.
