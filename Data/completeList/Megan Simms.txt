'''Megan Simms''' is a recurring character in Season 2 of ''[[Austin & Ally]]''. She is first seen in the episode "[[Magazines & Made-Up Stuff]]", as a 10 year old reporter, for a magazine named Cheetah Beat. She also appears in "Parents & Punishments".

She is portrayed by [[Aubrey K. Miller]].

==Personality==
Megan seems to be a cheerful, sweet girl most of the time, but when she doesn't get something her way, then she quickly turns into a threatening girl, much like Trish.

==Character History==
Megan has only made two appearances on the show as of now, so most of her history is unknown. At some point, when she was 10 or younger, she got a job as a journalist for a popular teenage magazine called ''Cheetah Beat'' and quickly became their top writer.

==Appearances==
*"[[Magazines & Made-Up Stuff]]"
*"[[Parents & Punishments]]"
*"[[Partners & Parachutes]]" (unaired episode; IMDb confirmed)

==Relationships==
===Nelson=== 
In "[[Parents & Punishments]]", it is shown that Nelson has a small crush on Megan, apparently, thinking that she was extremely pretty, and smiles when he sees her. Megan says she's flattered, but her career comes first. It is unknown if she returns his feelings.

===Ally Dawson===
Megan first meets Ally in "[[Magazines & Made-Up Stuff]]" while interviewing Austin for a Cheetah Beats article. Megan admires and looks up to Ally because she's Austin's songwriter. But towards the end when Megan asks how she writes those 'epic' songs, Ally lies and says she bungee jumps off of the tallest bridge in Miami and is forced to do it by Megan. In "[[Parents & Punishments]]", Megan interviews Ally for her very own Cheetah Beats article and calls her a hero for (accidentally) donating all of Sonic Boom's instruments to the music program.
