'''Sergeant Spinelli''' is a character from ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. He is the chief of one of the departments in the police station, where the [[Rescue Rangers]] like to watch for cases.Â They enjoy his office, likely because Spinelli eats a lot and likes cheese dishes (which primarily attracts [[Monterey Jack]]). As the chief of the department (which, probably investigates all kinds of loss, thefts, etc.), Spinelli has two patrol cops: [[Officer Kirby and Officer Muldoon|Muldoon and Kirby]].

He appears in the episodes "[[Catteries Not Included]]", "[[The Carpetsnaggers]]", "[[To the Rescue]]", "[[Battle of the Bulge]]", "[[Seer No Evil]]", "[[Mind Your Cheese and Q's]]", "[[Out of Scale (Rescue Rangers episode)|Out of Scale]]" and "[[Dirty Rotten Diapers]]."

==Trivia==
* [[Jim Cummings]] based Spinelli's voice on his aunt.
