==Appearances==
===''[[Descendants]]''===
On [[Evie]]'s first day in class, Mr. Deley attempts to humiliate her by asking about the atomic weight of silver. Evie manages to count it correctly with the [[Magic Mirror]] hidden in her hand.

When it came time for a test, [[Chad Charming]] takes her mirror and gives it to Mr. Deley, who thanks Chad for giving it to him and later uses it as an excuse to expel her. But [[Doug (Descendants)|Doug]] begs him to give Evie a chance. He then agrees to return Evie's mirror and let the matter slip if she passes the test, which she does in the end. To her delight, Evie feels a fulfillment never felt by this success.
