'''Ramas''' are a cross between a ram and a llama. They appear in the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[True Gritty]]".

==Background==
Ramas are the same size as llamas, but will ram you with their horns if you turn your back on them.

Found in the wild around the Northern Mountains, they are used by the Barbic Bears of [[Ursalia]] to carry great amounts.

[[Cubbi Gummi|Cubbi]] learns all about them from [[Gritty]] when the two go on a rama roundup in search of water for Ursalia.
