'''Marzipan''' is a minor villain and an antagonist from the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[Eye of the Beholder (Gummi Bears)|Eye of the Beholder]]".

==History==
She has magical powers that can enchant people. She almost marries [[King Gregor]], and even had [[Princess Calla]] under a spell to the point that she almost breaks her promise and exposes her own friends, the [[Gummi Bears]], to the humans of [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]].

But Marzipan's plans are foiled by [[Sunni Gummi|Sunni]], who figures out that sugar is her only weakness. 

She usually appears as an enchanting young woman, but this look is merely a deception; her true form is that of a hunched-over, green-skinned hag.

==Trivia==
*She is named after the confection marzipan, which primarily consists of ground almonds and sugar.
**This is ironic on some level, as sugar is her only weakness, and causes her to revert to her true form.
*Marzipan is one of a relatively small group of humans who find out about the existence of [[Gummi Bears]] during the course of the series. Other humans that become explicitly aware of the bears, are [[Cavin]], [[Princess Calla]], [[Duke Igthorn]], [[Lady Bane]], [[Sir Gawain]], [[Princess Marie]], [[Angelo Davini]], [[Flint Shrubwood]], [[The Hunter|the Hunter]], [[Rotocelli]], [[Doctor Dexter]], [[Lord Willoughby]], [[Prince Yen Moon]] and his subjects, Carney's assistant from the episode "[[Never Give a Gummi an Even Break]]", and the boy who turned himself into a Giant, from the episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Stone]]".
