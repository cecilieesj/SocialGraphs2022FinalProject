}}The '''Olympian Gods and Goddesses''' are the rulers of the world of [[Ancient Greece]] in ''[[Hercules (film)|Hercules]]''. They are divine immortals who control the forces of nature. They are related to the older [[Titans]], their ancestors, and chief enemies. There are now twelve major gods who rule over the country, the Olympians, all of whom are under the absolute rule of [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]], king of the gods. They reside high above on [[Mount Olympus]] where they discuss affairs related to the mortal world or matters regarding monsters or disorders in nature.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
All Olympian gods and goddesses are human in appearance but far greater in height and stature; though they can manifest themselves to the heights of typical humans for interactions sake. They possess a glowing aura of divinity emitting from their body; also, they possess a wide range of skin and hair color.

===Powers and Abilities===
The Olympians Gods and Goddesses are incredibly powerful beings that possess abilities such as: nigh-omnipotence, immortality, superhuman strength, shape-shifting, teleportation, and omnipresence. The gods also possess energy-based abilities, such as magical powers and energy projection. They can grant powers to non-godly thing, since some are capable of life-giving to objects or giving supernatural powers tothose  who don't possess it with ease. However, unlike in myth, their superhuman physical capabilities seem more restricted.

Some gods have abilities related to their specific domain. For instance, Poseidon has control over water, and Apollo having control over the sun.

Though they are mighty, the gods do have weaknesses. Magic can harm them; also, they can't break through magic chains.

==Trivia==
*In original Greek mythology, most, if not all the Olympian gods and goddesses, were related in one form or another, such as Athena and Ares being children of Zeus, and husband and wife Zeus and Hera actually being brother and sister. With the exception of recognizing Ares and Athena being brother and sister, and Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades being brothers, these blood relations are seemingly disregarded in the Disney interpretations. The gods and goddesses' penchant for infidelity, another recurring motif in Olympian mythology, is also disregarded for obvious reasons.
*A lot of the gods and goddesses are portrayed as being much more benevolent in the movie than in the original myths, especially Hera and Zeus. Conversely, Hades is portrayed as being more malevolent than in the myths.
*In ''[[Once Upon a Time]]'', [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]] and [[Zeus (Hercules)|Zeus]] are the only Olympian Gods who appear in the show. The demi-god Hercules also appears. In the case of Demeter and Persephone, their roles were replaced by [[Queen of Hearts|Cora]] and [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Zelena]].
