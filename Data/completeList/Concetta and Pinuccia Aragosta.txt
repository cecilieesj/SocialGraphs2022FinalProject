'''Concetta and Pinuccia Aragosta''' are characters featured in the [[2021]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature film, ''[[Luca]]''. They are a pair of elderly women who live in [[Portorosso]] who are later revealed to be sea monsters in disguise.

==Background==
Screenwriter Jesse Andrews disclosed that he spent three years in the Cinque Terre area, in order to work in the production of ''[[Luca]]''. There, he rented "a room right above the piazza", from two sisters (whom he identified as "Concetta and Pinuccia Aragosta", accompanied by a screenshot of the characters). He added that ''"at no point during the entire three years did I ever see either of them smile"'',<ref name="inspiration">{{cite web|last=Andrews|first=Jesse|url=https://twitter.com/_jesse_andrews_/status/1387482556963061760|title=Jesse Andrews on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|date=April 28, 2021|accessdate=January 19, 2022}}</ref> suggesting that the characters drew  a fair amount of inspiration from the landladies.

===Personality===
Concetta and Pinuccia Aragosta both appear to be grumpy women, as they're nearly always seen scowling. When [[Alberto Scorfano|Alberto]] convinces [[Luca Paguro|Luca]] to salute them with the ''"What's wrong with you, stupido?"'' line, they take offense and hit both boys with an umbrella and a purse. They also throw the gelati they had just bought at the boys, although they end up eating and enjoying them.

They appear to be used to life in [[Portorosso]]. When [[Giulia Marcovaldo|Giulia]] rushes with her bike between the two of them, they simply say ''"Ciao, Giulia"'', unbothered. They also appear to like gelato, as they're seen eating it in their first scene and in the credits pictures.

===Physical appearance===
One of them is tall and thin, with a long nose, while the other is short and stout, with a big, round nose. Both of them wear headscarves.

===Powers and abilities===
By the end of the film, they reveal themselves to be sea monsters. It stands to reason that they possess the same standard sea monster abilities as [[Luca Paguro|Luca]] and the others, including shapeshifting.

===Development===
In the deleted scene "Gelato Trouble" included in the Blu-ray / Digital format releases of ''Luca'', the scene featuring Luca and Alberto getting into trouble with gelato was extended compared to the one seen in the final version of the film which was used as an homage to spaghetti western films with Luca himself learning the wrong ways given by Alberto to which for the final cut, the scene where Alberto teaches Luca to say "What's wrong with you, ''stupido''?" to Concetta and Pinuccia remained in the final version but was shortened unlike in the deleted scene. Additionally unlike in the film where Concetta and Pinuccia's dialogues only consisted of grunts, the parts where Concetta and Pinuccia had dialogue were included in this deleted scene, while the part where the said duo report Luca and Alberto to a local Portorosso officer to deal with the two about the problem was not included in the final version of the film.

==Appearances==
===''[[Luca]]''===
Concetta and Pinuccia are first seen in their elderly women forms strolling across the town of Portorosso just as [[Luca Paguro|Luca]] and [[Alberto Scorfano|Alberto]] walk past them just as Luca tells them, "What's wrong with you, ''stupido''?", much to the duo being offended by Luca's words just as he and Alberto are hit respectively just as the two retrieve two gelato cones from them respectively. Later during the end of the film after Luca, Alberto, and Giulia are declared the winners of the Portorosso Cup with sea monsters being accepted into the town of Portorosso, Concetta and Aragosta are seen holding their umbrellas where the two drop theirs  and are revealed to be sea monsters in disguise the whole time just as they are seen applauding the trio's victory.

===''[[Ciao Alberto]]''===
Alberto passes by Concetta and Pinuccia just as Alberto grabs a cone filled with multiple gelato scoops on it just before Alberto gets distracted upon hearing a girl kicking a football which Alberto kicks it back to her. They later appear again in the short during a montage of Alberto delivering fish to the Portorosso citizens just as one of the Aragostas catches a fish, much to their frown. One of the Aragostas is later seen in a line of angry customers who approach [[Massimo Marcovaldo|Massimo]] after complaining about what Alberto did to them during his delivery job.

==Trivia==
*In the very beginning of the film, [[Luca Paguro|Luca]] says hi to one Mrs. Aragosta, who appears to be his neighbor. That Mrs. Aragosta is possibly a relative of theirs, since her appearance differs from the sea monster form of both of them.
