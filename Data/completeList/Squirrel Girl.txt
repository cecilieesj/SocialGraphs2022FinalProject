==Trivia==
[[File:Squirrel Girl (cropped).png|thumb|150px|Milana Vayntrub as Squirrel Girl from the ''New Warriors'' pilot.]]
* In the comics, Squirrel Girl was originally a joke character, in an adventure that saw her team up with [[Iron Man]], and with her help, actually managed to defeat [[Doctor Doom]] with her squirrel sidekicks. Since then, a running gag throughout her appearances shows her being able to beat some of the most powerful villains and threats in the Marvel Universe, including [[Thanos]], [[M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Galactus]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], [[Mandarin]], [[Terrax]], Bi-Beast, [[Abomination]], [[Ultron]], Fin-Fang Foom, and even [[Deadpool]]. Joining the obscure hero team the '''Great Lakes Avengers''', Doreen eventually rose to prominence after she realized the team wasn't pulling their own weight. She would be hired by [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Power Man]] as a nanny to look after their infant daughter '''Danielle Cage'''. Doreen was incredibly responsible with this task, fiercely protecting Danielle from many threats intent on kidnapping her.
* Milana Vayntrub, who voices Squirrel Girl in the ''Marvel Rising'' series, was to portray the character in live action in the ultimately unproduced ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|New Warriors]]''. She was to serve as the lead protagonist and head a group of untrained c-list heroes. Shannon Purser of ''Stranger Things'' fame and [[Mae Whitman]] were both considered with Whitman almost cast, though she had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. [[Anna Kendrick]] was a popular choice, but she had no interest in the role.
