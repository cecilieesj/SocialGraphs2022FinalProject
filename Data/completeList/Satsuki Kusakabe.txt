'''Satsuki Kusakabe''' is the 11-year-old sister of [[Mei Kusakabe|Mei]] in ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Satsuki, like all sisters, can get rather angry at her sister, Mei. Particularly at the end of the film when they find out that their mother won't be coming home from the hospital for the weekend. Satsuki likes to think of herself as grown-up and caring for her sister. She is very lively although not quite as much as Mei. Satsuki is a good sister on the whole and looks after Mei to the best of her ability despite being upset about their ill mother.
