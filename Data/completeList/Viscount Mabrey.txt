'''Viscount Mabrey''' is the main antagonist of the [[2004]] film ''[[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement]]'' who was portrayed by [[John Rhys-Davies]] as a former member of the Genovian Parliament and the uncle of [[Mia Thermopolis]]'s love interest, [[Nicholas Devereaux]].

==Biography==
Viscount Mabrey first appears picking up Mia's tiara after it falls off and giving it back to her, however he plots to have his nephew Lord Nicholas to inherit the throne of Genovia, as he is another heir, by having him to seduce Mia Thermopolis to break off her engagement to [[Andrew Jacoby]] and thus making her unable to become queen as stated by the Genovian law, however this fails as Nicholas genuinely falls in love with Mia and starts to have second thoughts about stealing the throne, but Mabrey refuses to back down and falsely tells Nicholas to tell Mia that the crown is hers, while secretly paying a man to videotape them together and broadcast it on the news in a last attempt to get the throne, but Nicholas declines to become king and disowns Mabrey, who is last seen banging the doors, begging to be let inside.
