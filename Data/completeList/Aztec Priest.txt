The '''Aztec Priest''' is a character featured in the now-defunct [[El Rio del Tiempo]] attraction at [[Epcot]].

==History==

===Background===
The Aztec priest is a high priest encountered during the scene of what [[Mexico]] once was before the conquistadors arrived for many years which is the attraction's first sequence. The voice guiding the guests to the sequence representing Mesoamerican culture is heard when they pass through the voice of the priest guiding them across the section representing of what Mexico once was before the Spaniards came for many years. The sections encountered after passing through the Aztec priest consist of traditional Mesoamerican culture as depicted through viginettes consisting of live-action scenes.

===Development History===
The Aztec priest was developed for the former attraction [[El Rio del Tiempo]] at the [[Mexico Pavilion]] where the figure of him was displayed during the first act representing Mesoamerican culture since the attraction first opened on [[October 1]], [[1982]], the day [[Epcot]] opened. He remained in the section representing Mesoamerican culture over the years prior to it closure on [[January 2]], [[2007]].

The attraction later reopened on [[April 6]], [[2007]] as [[Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros]]. The Aztec priest figure was removed from the attraction and is replaced by an animated screen depicting [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]] and [[Jos√© Carioca]] looking for [[Donald Duck]] all across Mexico. Thirteen years later after the attraction closed and after thirteen years of absence, the Aztec priest was displayed in the Inside the Walt Disney Archives touring exhibit starting in the {{WikipediaLink|Bowers Museum}} in {{WikipediaLink|Santa Ana}}, [[California]].

==Appearances==

===[[El Rio del Tiempo]]===
The Aztec priest appears during the attraction's first sequence representing Mesoamerican culture, the pre-colonial era of Mexico. When the guests enter the ancient ruins, the spirit of the Aztec priest narrates of what Mexico was like before the Spanish came for many years.

At the end of the attraction, the voice of the priest returns to offer the guests a farewell.
