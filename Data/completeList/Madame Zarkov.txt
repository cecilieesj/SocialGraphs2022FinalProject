'''Madame Vidalia Onionski Zarkov''' or more simply '''Madame Zarkov''' is a character from the [[Adventurers Club]] of [[Pleasure Island]] who has additional connections to [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]].

==History==

===Background===
During the latter-end of the 19th century, Vidalia Onionski Zarkov was a Romani woman, who worked as a proprietress at the [[Museum of the Weird]], an establishment which held a collection of arcane and supernatural relics. She was an apparent advisor on the mystic in some regard for the [[Society of Explorers and Adventurers]], namely to club-president [[Jason Chandler]]. Around 1880, Jason contacted Zarkov to assist fellow S.E.A.-member [[Barnabas T. Bullion]], who was encountering paranormal disasters in his [[Big Thunder Mining Company|mining-operation]] at [[Big Thunder Mountain]]. Due to the mountain being inhabited by a [[Spirit of Big Thunder|vengeful spirit]], Zarkov advised Chandler to urge Bullion to abandon his mining.

In the early 20th century, Madame Zarkov would become a member of the Adventurers Club, a splinter-faction of the S.E.A., which was created by business-tycoon [[Merriweather Adam Pleasure]]. In [[1937]], Zarkov would attend a [[December 31|New Year's Eve party]] on Pleasure Island at the Adventurers Club headquarters on Pleasure Island in [[Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]].

===Development History===
Madame Zarkov was a live-performed character created for the Adventurers Club of [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]]. She would later be incorporated into Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at the [[Magic Kingdom]] with additional allusions to the Museum of the Weird and S.E.A. The Museum of the Weird is an unbuilt attraction planned to be an extension of the [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]] in [[Disneyland]]'s [[New Orleans Square]], which was developed by imagineer [[Rolly Crump]]. Zarkov's connection to the Mansion might be inspired by, "'''Madame Z'''", a character created by [[Marc Davis]] for the Haunted Mansion, who later evolved into [[Madame Leota]].

==Appearances==

===The Adventurers Club===
Zarkov was an irregular character at the club who typically served as a replacement for regular-character Samantha Sterling. During the club's later performances, they would both often appear in the attraction more regularly.

===Big Thunder Mountain Railroad===
In the queue for this attraction, Madame Zarkov is mentioned by Jason Chandler in a letter sent to Barnabas T. Bullion referring to the supernatural occurrences of Big Thunder Mountain.
