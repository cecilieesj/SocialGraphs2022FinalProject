He worked as an assistant to [[Margot Yale]], but was also secretly a member of the Quarrymen. He tipped off John Castaway to Margot's plan to secretly send [[Angela]] and [[Bronx]] upstate by train. Castaway promised Maxwell a Silver Hammer at their next rally.

Since Castaway was soon imprisoned, it can be safely assumed that Maxwell never got his Silver Hammer.
