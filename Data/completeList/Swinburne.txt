==Role in the film==
When he was in the market he heard [[Miss Eglantine Price]] and [[Professor Emelius Brown]] saying that they have [[The Spells of Astoroth]]Â (which belongs to Paul), and he reported this to the [[Bookman (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)|Bookman]]. He forced Miss Price, Professor Brown, [[Charlie Rawlins|Charlie]], [[Carrie Rawlins|Carrie]], and [[Paul Rawlins|Paul]] to come with him to see the Bookman, first by asking Professor Brown, who was not listening to the request. When he saw Emilius was ignoring him, Swinburne got more forceful, bluntly remarking "Would you fancy this?" and brandishing a knife. Professor Brown was momentarily shocked, but then dryly remarked "Yes good chap, you now have my undivided attention" and proceeded to follow Swinburne into the Bookman's shop.

He joined the Bookman on trying to get Paul's book, implying they would do so by violence. While Miss Price, Professor Brown, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul escaped on the bed the Bookman told Swineburne to get the book, but they got away before he could get at them.
