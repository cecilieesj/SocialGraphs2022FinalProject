'''Shutterbug''' is a major character in the ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'' television series on both [[Disney Channel]] and [[Disney Junior]]. She is a ladybug robotic drone who often flies places, finds the kid(s) in trouble, takes a picture of what they don't know how to do, and then sends it to the unique tracking satellite that orbits directly to Oso's location, then downlinks the signal, and has a special assignment to help the kid(s) after he messes up on his special assignment whether Paw Pilot says "Special alert, Special alert!" and whether Mr. Dos, Oso's talking watch talks to him about the problem and his special assignment after Paw Pilot says Special Alert after he already messed up or when paw Pilot says Special Alert before he messes up on his exercise like in Live and Jump Rope where Oso was trying to jump over laser beams, but he couldn't remember when he needed to jump and Paw Pilot alerted Oso and Oso touched the laser beam and the alarm set off and the HQ set a trap for Oso by lifting part of the hallway and then gives Oso a little slide and Oso slides down and ends up in his sports car. She even appeared in Octo-puzzle behind a chair where Oso was sitting. Then she left immediately

Personality: Shutterbug does not have a natural personality of any kind, however, she loves to take photos and since she is a very small drone, no one can really see her. Allowing her to spy on kids who need help more easily. She does not like kids in trouble or who need help seriously, which she often sends the special alert signal to the U.N.I.Q.U.E Trackin Satellite that heads to Oso's location, and then drops the signal.

There are multiple shutterbugs at the unique dome that are in different colors, there is a white shutterbug, a grey and black one. A pink one, a red one (The main one). A blue shutterbug (wolfie owns this one). Pink shutterbug (Owned by Dotty). a green one, an orange one, a yellow one. And even a purple one scouting out spying across earth.
