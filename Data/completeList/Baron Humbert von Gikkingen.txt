{{Quote|I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, and I have come for [[Haru]]!|Baron|The Cat Returns}}

'''Baron Humbert von Gikkingen''', also known simply as "'''The Baron'''", is a major character in the [[1995]] film ''[[Whisper of the Heart]]'' and the title deuteragonist of the [[2002]] film ''[[The Cat Returns]]''. 

He is a (living) statue of an anthropomorphic cat who is fully dressed (including a top hat and shoes). At night, he comes to life. He belongs to the owner of an antique shop named Shiro Nishi. In ''The Cat Returns'', he owns the Cat Bureau. In the original Japanese versions of ''Whisper of the Heart'' and ''The Cat Returns'', he is voiced by Yoshihiko Hakamada and Shigeru Tsuyuguchi, respectively, while in the English version of both films, [[Cary Elwes]] did his voice.

==''Whisper of the Heart''==
In ''Whisper of the Heart'', the Baron was a statue that Shiro Nishi owned. He had a lost female counterpart and Shiro was desperate to find her.

==''The Cat Returns''==
Due to his popularity, Baron was given a bigger role in ''The Cat Returns'', where he, along with Muta, aids [[Haru|Haru Yoshioka]] as she is unwittingly brought into the Cat Kingdom. The Baron works in the Cat Bureau.
