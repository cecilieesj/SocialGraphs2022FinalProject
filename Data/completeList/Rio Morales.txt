In the episode "Miles From Home", she is about to celebrate her birthday alongside [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles]], but her son is called away to help [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]] save the multiverse from the [[Green Goblin]]. In the process, the Siege Perilous is destroyed and leaves Miles stranded in Peter's universe, much to Rio's dismay. In "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 4, Rio is kidnapped by [[Wolf Spider]], but is subsequently saved by the 'prime' Spider-Man, Kid Arachnid and [[Spider-Woman]]. Rio later leaves with her son to the 'prime' universe.

In [[Mother's Day Mayhem]], she, Miles, Peter, [[Aunt May]], [[Spider-Gwen|Gwen]] and [[Helen Stacy|Helen]] plan to go to the park for the Mother’s Day picnic but, it’s interrupted by [[Doctor Octopus|Doc Ock]] when she escapes jail.
