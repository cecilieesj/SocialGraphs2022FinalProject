}}'''Tiny''' is a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] that appeared in ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''. He was briefly under the control of [[Michael Yagoobian|Bowler Hat Guy]]'s [[Mini-Doris]], but later became a pet to the Robinsons. He is voiced by Joe Mateo.

==Appearances==
===''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''===
Tiny is a Tyrannosaurus Rex that was brought under the control of the [[Mini-Doris]] that was remotely controlled by [[Michael Yagoobian|Bowler Hat Guy]], who got the idea when seeing the Mini-Doris hovering over a dinosaur topiary on the grounds of [[Anderson Observatory]]. Wanting to keep it a surprise, he didn't inform Doris, who was planning on cutting the chandelier to get rid of [[Wilbur Robinson|Wilbur]], and was enraged by the blatantly obvious attack as opposed to her subtle actions. After a fight with the family and Bowler Hat Guy again being told by a controlled minion that his plans weren't thought through, the Tyrannosaurus is freed from Mini-Doris' control when Wilbur shoots it off his head with [[Gaston Framagucci|Gaston]]'s Meatball Canon and turns out to be a rather docile specimen and is shown to be acting like a puppy. Even after [[Doris]]' actions are undone by the climax of the film and he should have been sent back as a result, Tiny still appears to see [[Lewis Robinson|Lewis]] back off to the past, now a pet of the Robinson household.

=== [[Pet Project (unproduced short)|''Pet Project'']] ===
In this unfinished short, it's revealed that Tiny was raised from a dinosaur egg that Bowler Hat Guy stole during his short trip to the Cretaceous. He was quickly grown to a large size on cheeseburgers and a Robinson Industries growth formula, though accidentally breaking Mini Doris during the growth process. While physically appearing like an adult, he retained a puppy like demeanor, which made training him as an attack beast difficult. However, things got back on track once Bowler Hat Guy was able to reactivate Mini Doris.

===''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]''===
Tiny makes a cameo appearance in the [[2012]] animated film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' as a video game dinosaur in [[Game Central Station]], heavily resembling [[w:c:primalrage:Sauron|Sauron]] from ''[[w:c:primalrage:Primal Rage|Primal Rage]]''. The colors on this Tiny are lighter and more cartoony than seen in ''Meet the Robinsons''.

== Trivia ==
* In the original book, the Robinsons did not have any pet dinosaurs. Instead, about three dinosaurs come hang out at their pool whenever someone leaves the time machine on.
* Tiny was featured on a promotion for ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''. 
* Tiny is essentially the opposite of Frankie. While Frankie is an amphibian given sentience and sapience, Tiny is a time-displaced extinct reptile who has a dog-like mental state. While under Bowler Hat Guy's control, Frankie's weakness is his frail body in comparison to the humans and Tiny's weakness is his huge, clumsy body.
