==Personality==
Louie is buffoonish and sometimes grumpy. His cartoons often see him chasing after either Donald Duck or Goofy.

==Appearances==
===''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''===
Louie, along with [[Humphrey the Bear]], appears in the episode "[[Bearing Up Baby]]", where he attempts to attack Humphrey and the Rescue Rangers.

===''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]''===
He first appears in "[[Goofy's Big Kitty]]", where escapes from a circus and hides in Goofy's home and is mistaken for [[Mr. Pettibone|Goofy's new kitten]].

He later appears in ''[[Goofy's Radio]]'', where he tries to eat Goofy but uncontrollably dances to the music of Goofy's radio.

===''[[House of Mouse]]''===
Louie makes a small appearance in "[[Goofy's Valentine Date]]". He also appears in "[[Pluto Saves the Day]]" just before "Goofy's Big Kitty" is shown, where Goofy tells him that this cartoon stars Goofy and him, then roars at him making Goofy say ''him and'' Goofy.

==Trivia==
*His design is identical to the tiger in the Goofy short, ''[[Tiger Trouble]]''. Drawings of Louie in a model sheet are animation drawings of the tiger from ''Tiger Trouble'' but without the stripes. Co-incidentally, [[Raja|Raja the Tiger]], the secondary antagonist of the animated short, ''[[Goliath II]]'', bears a close physical resemblance to both Louie and the tiger from ''Tiger Trouble''.
*His son appears once in ''[[Hook, Lion and Sinker]]''. Louie attempts to catch [[Donald Duck]]'s fishing trip prizes with help of a young lion cub who had to pick bullets out of his backside.
*''[[Grand Canyonscope]]'' is the only short that Louie appears in that doesn't have a "lion" pun in the title.
