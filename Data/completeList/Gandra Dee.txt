Gandra Dee appears in Season 2 of ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]''. She is portrayed as a grunge style scientist who doesn't kiss up to millionaires and does her own thing.

In Season 3, where "[[Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!]]" depicts the mosquito that was bothering Donald turns revealed to be a F.O.W.L. robot, Gandra Dee states that the Duck family have found the hidden journal of Isabella Finch. In between the events of "[[Escape from the ImpossiBin!]]" and "[[The Split Sword of Swanstantine!]]", where the McDuck family are now aware that Gandra Dee is a F.O.W.L. agent. However, in "[[Beaks in the Shell!]]", it is revealed that she was merely using F.O.W.L.'s mainframe to work on a virtual reality project with Fenton (with whom Gandra has entered an official relationship with) and intended to leave F.O.W.L. once it was completed. Unfortunately, Bradford Buzzard found out and had Gandra locked away in the lost library at the end of the episode.
