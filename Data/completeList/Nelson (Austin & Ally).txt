{{quote|Aww, nartz!|Nelson's catchprase}}
'''Nelson''' is a recurring character in Seasons 1 and 2 of ''[[Austin & Ally]]''. He is an awkward young boy who takes music lessons from [[Ally Dawson|Ally]] because he wants to be an aspiring musician. He is very absent-minded, so he tends to do things the wrong way or doesn't understand them well. He usually comes in with something/someone that he believes he's supposed to have a lesson on, only for Ally to then tell him that he's supposed to have a different type of lesson. A recurring gag is that when something goes wrong, he exclaims "''Aww, nartz!''". Nelson is also a part of a music program at his school.

==Personality==
Nelson is shown to be a very good kid with good intentions. He always has a nice attitude and is very sweet. His catchphrase is "''Aww, nartz!''", which is also the name of his teddy bear.
