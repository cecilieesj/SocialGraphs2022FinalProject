The '''Caretaker''', semi-officially named '''Silas Crump''', is a character found within [[Haunted Mansion (location)|the Haunted Mansion]].

==History==
===Background===
The Caretaker is the groundskeeper for [[Haunted Mansion (location)|the Haunted Mansion]] and/or its adjacent cemetery. He does a nightly job with his dog with both master and pet being terrified of the manor's undead residents.

Many names have been put forward for the Caretaker over the years but the closest to an official one is Silas Crump. This name coming from a crate which could once be found in [[Liberty Square]] which was addressed to him.

==Appearance==
All the figures share the same face mold and basic costume (barring variations in the length of his scarf). The hairstyle of the Caretaker varies considerably however; for example when [[Walt Disney World Dolphin|Walt Disney World]] first opened, he sported red hair with a Lincoln beard, something still displayed in the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] attraction, meanwhile the [[Disneyland]] version is clean-shaven with white hair.

==Appearances==
===The Haunted Mansion===
The Caretaker appears in all mainstream versions of the Haunted Mansion. He and his dog stand at the gates of the cemetery right after the guests fall from the attic. The caretaker and dog are seen cowering at the sight of the ghosts.

===Live-Appearances===
The Caretaker has made a handful of meet 'n' greet appearances as a face character, where he gives his dog's name to be "Bones". He notably opened the opening show to the Mansion's 50th-anniversary celebrations in 2019, warning the audience that he was feeling, down into his bones, that more supernatural activity would be afoot tonight than there had been ever since the Mansion first opened five decades earlier.

==Other Appearances==
===Film===
====[[The Haunted Mansion (film)]]====

====[[Muppets Haunted Mansion|''Muppets Haunted Mansion'']]====
The Gravedigger, portrayed by Darren Criss, appears in the Disney+ special, with a Muppet dog.

===Printed Material===
====The Ghost Gallery====
In the 1990s, cast-members of the Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World created a backstory for the attraction as a means of answering guest questions. All of this backstory was recorded on paper and while unofficial, has since influenced both the original Haunted Mansion's official and semi-official features as-well as adaptations based on the Haunted Mansion.

In this story, he is a Walt Disney World cast-member named '''Dick O'Dell''' who was given a room in the Haunted Mansion to live in after the manor was moved to [[Florida]] from [[New York]] as an attraction. His dog is the child of Loki, the ghost dog seen in the ride who itself is the child of the [[Hellhound]] in the ride which once belonged to [[Master Gracey]].

====[[Haunted Mansion (comic book)|''The Haunted Mansion'' (SLG Comics)]]====
The Caretaker is named '''Horace Fusselbottom''' in the comics. While depicted as incredibly nervous and easy to frighten, Horace actually has a courageous spirit beneath his frightened fa√ßade, with the ghosts enjoying his company so much that they frighten away a replacement in "The New Groundskeeper".

In "The Groundskeeper's Secret", his motivation for taking the job of watching over a haunted house and graveyard is revealed. A widower, Horace buried his deceased wife in the graveyard adjacent to the Mansion, allowing him to meet her spirit every night while on the job.
