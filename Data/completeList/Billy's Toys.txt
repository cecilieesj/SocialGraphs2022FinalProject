In this short, [[Tinny]] is first shown to be Billy's newest toy. Tinny is first very optimistic about being played with, until he sees Billy drool on a Rock-a-Stack and destroy a string of beads. Out of fear, he runs under the couch, where he finds the rest of Billy's toys hiding from Billy as well. Once Tinny sees Billy fall and start crying, he decides to cheer him up. He goes out, and amuses Billy for a little while, only to find that Billy is interested in other things. After the credits, the race car driver and coffee pot toys move about across the floor after Billy and Tinny left the room. In the DVD audio commentary, it is said that each team member modeled (created) one toy each.

In ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', the toys (specifically the alarm clock, the coffee pot, the collapsable dog, the basketball, the helicopter, the airplane pilot, the fire hydrant, the elephant, and the robot) make a cameo appearance at [[Sunnyside Daycare]] in the youngest classroom: the [[Caterpillar Room]], most-likely donated at some point. When Andy's toys are first donated and anxious to be played with again, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] notices the other toys hiding. The alarm clock was seen on top of a shelf near the windows, but it jumped off from it from behind to the floor, where the rest of Billy's toys are all huddled together under the shelf in the same fashion as in ''Tin Toy''. They find out this is because the young children don't know how to play with them, and are very rough. Earlier in the film, some of these toys like the elephant were seen wandering around the Caterpillar room when [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]] introduced Andy's toys to the room.

The collapsable dog also appeared in the ''[[Toy Story Toons]]'' short ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'' as one of the "sinker" toys.
