}}'''Shane Wolfe''' is the protagonist of the [[2005]] Disney action comedy film ''[[The Pacifier]]''.

==Personality==
Being a Navy Lieutenant, Shane was a strict disciplinarian who took his job very seriously. He applied this same strict attitude when he was taking care of the Plummer kids as he thought that they needed it, only to later regret doing so and became kinder to them and helped them with their recent problems.

==Role in the film==
Shane was the son of a Spec Ops soldier. After his parents divorced when he was young (which led to his mother leaving Shane), his father enrolled him into military school, which he has always reckoned was due to how his father liked the life of a soldier more than that of a parent. After Shane lost his father, he made himself believe that if he talked to anyone about how he felt following this then he would letting his father down.

Several years later, Shane became a lieutenant in the Navy SEALs. He led and choreographed several rescue missions and snatch-and-grabs from all around the world. One of his latest missions was to rescue Professor Howard Plummer, who'd been kidnapped by Serbian rebels. After he and his men took out the rebels, Shane was able to get Howard to their way out. Unfortunately, he later found the crew of the helicopter they were using to escape dead and was too late to save Howard before he himself got shot and injured. This ended up with Shane being in the hospital for two months.

After being released, Shane is told by his boss, [[Captain Bill Fawcett]], that Howard was working on the nuclear code scrambler GHOST. This was maybe why the Serbian rebels kidnapped him as they may have thought he had the GHOST on him. Bill said that his boss, Admiral Blair, was contacted by Howard's widow, [[Julie Plummer|Julie]], as she thought the GHOST was in her house. Bill had Shane take care of the house and the Plummer kids, [[Zoe Plummer|Zoe]], [[Seth Plummer|Seth]], [[Lulu Plummer|Lulu]], [[Peter Plummer|Peter]] and [[Tyler Plummer|Tyler]], while he and Julie were dealing with a safety deposit box. Unfortunately, Shane didn't get on so well with the kids because of how he thought they weren't disciplined and Zoe and Seth didn't like his strict militaristic attitude.

Shane was soon able to get on the kids' good sides after he protected them from a couple of intruders after the GHOST, and agreed to listen to them if they listened to him. He then proceeded to help them out â€“ Zoe with her driving test, Lulu and her Fireflies troop with self-defence against another one, the Bear Troop, that was bullying them and Seth with a production of ''The Sound of Music'' that he was in. Shane also able to find the GHOST, and greeted Bill and Julie after they returned from getting the safety deposit box. While being congratulated by Bill, he and Shane ended up at gunpoint by the Plummers' North Korean neighbors, [[Mr. & Mrs. Chun]]. This led him to realize that Bill was a double agent after the GHOST.

Shane was later able to get the GHOST after being forced to at gunpoint by Bill. He and Julie were then able to knock Bill and Mrs. Chun out, and also help to take down Mr. Chun. After the GHOST was successfully retrieved, Shane ended up changing careers and later became the school wrestling coach.
