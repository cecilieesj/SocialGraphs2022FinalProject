The '''Bat Queen''' is a character who appears in the [[Disney Channel]] animated series, ''[[The Owl House]]''. She is the wealthiest demon on [[The Boiling Isles]], who was once a giant's [[palisman]], until she was broken and discarded. Now, she serves as a protector to other palismen, who have been broken and abandoned.

In Season Two, she teamed up with Eda and Principle Bump, to create "Adopt a Palismen Day". Abandoned palismen were given another chance at finding new owners due to the fact Palistrom Trees are rare. 

==Background==
Thousands of years ago, the Bat Queen used to be on a staff belonging to a giant, until she was abandoned after being broken. Over the years, she had forgotten about her owner and the truth over what happened. She took it upon herself to protect other palismans, who had been abandoned and became a mother of three baby bats.

The Bat Queen is known to be extremely wealthy and lives in a nest filled with treasure. She is also very protective to not only her children but to the other abandoned palismen.

===Physical appearance===
The bat queen is a giant head with Asian characteristics and long greasy black hair. She has bat wings and talons which feature her interlock.
