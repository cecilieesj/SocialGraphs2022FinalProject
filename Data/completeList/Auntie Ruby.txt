[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x01 - Generation Why - Ruby and Muneeba.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Ruby arrives at Saeed Fashions, a fabric shop, to pick up her clothing. She asks [[Shakat]], the tailor, if her clothes are ready, and encounters her friend, Muneeba, who is also there, with her daughter, [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], shopping for her [[Aamir Khan|sons]] upcoming wedding. She informs Muneeba that Fatima, a mutual associate of theirs, broke off her engagement. Muneeba questions why, and the pair begin gossiping, as Ruby snarkily replies that Fatima felt she wasn't ready for commitment, and left for Europe to "discover" herself. She questions what Fatima would need to discover, when Kamala chimes in the conversation to praise her, as she's fulfilling her dream. Ruby looks disapprovingly, towards Kamala, regarding her comment and states that Fatima will remain unmarried, given her behavior. She continues, stating she witnessed Fatima with a boy named rob from Belgium. As the tailor measures Kamala's clothes, Ruby comments that Kamala is too short for the dress, to which Muneeba agrees with.

Ruby attends the Eid Al-Adha festival, and is amongst a group of other women, that [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]] dubs the "Illumin-Aunties".

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x02 - Crushed - Aunties Worry.jpg|thumb|250px]]
When the evening arrives, Kamala inquires about her great-grandmother, Aisha to the fellow aunties, but they're all reluctant to discuss her. They all mention the various rumors surrounding her, and Ruby comments that she heard that Aisha killed a man, during the Partition. In the midst of their conversation, Ruby and the others are alerted to the screams of a young boy, and find that he is hanging by a curtain attached to a rail, from the window of the mosque tower. Ruby calls for someone to phone 911, and rushes in the [[Hameed]]'s direction. She fearfully watches, as the rails begin to break, and he's closer to falling to his death, when a young masked heroine, dubbed "Night Light" appears. Ruby witnesses Night Light create energy platforms, in the air, and walk to the Hameed's direction. He falls before she can reach him, but the heroine creates a construct in the middle of the air, which the he lands on. Night Light then runs over to him, causing Ruby and the others to cheer, at his rescue. She and the others celebrates his safety, but before Hameed can climb off the platform and onto the roof, it shatters, and Ruby looks in horror, as he falls onto the hood of a car, with his impact slightly broken by constructs the Night Light created.

Ruby attends Aamir and [[Tyesha Hillman|Tyesha]]'s Mehndi, hosted at the Khan residence, and asks [[Sheikh Abdullah]] how he is, after hearing news that the FBI entered the mosque to accuse him for being associated it with Night Light. He clarifies that only a few agents from [[Damage Control]] came.

{{Quote|What? You can't see anything. You know the DMV revoked her driver's license?|Auntie Ruby on [[Auntie Humaira]]|Destined}}
[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x03 - Destined - Photography - Bruno and the Aunties.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
On the day of the wedding, Ruby is among the guests. [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]] asks why the bride and groom place their heads against each other, and Ruby explains that the tradition is meant to bring fortitude in a marriage so that every time the couple clash, they come closer. He asks if it's true, and Ruby doesn't know, but thinks the idea of a couple banging their head is just fun. During the festivities, she participates in a dance, along with Kamala, Nakia and Bruno. Shortly after, Ruby returns to her table and is making conversation, when the fire alarm is triggered, and she is escorted out of the building, along with the other guests. Zara states that she saw Kamala pulled the alarm, but Ruby is dismissive of her claims, with her poor eyesight, and points out that the DMV revoked her driver's license.

Ruby watches a video released by [[Zoe Zimmer]] warning of the dangers she and her superpowered friends face, at the hands of Damage Control, who are arriving at Coles Academy High School to capture them. Ruby takes off, in protest of the organisation's actions, and is met with various members from her local mosque, including the Khans and the Sheikh, among others.

[[File:Ms. Marvel - 1x06 - No Normal - Scared Crowd.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Ruby watches on, as a [[Kamran|young powered boy]] exits the school and Damage Control try to apprehend him. When they begin shooting, Night Light arrives, for his protection, while the crowd objectifies at Damage Control's actions. The powered boy throws a DODC vehicle in response, but it ricochets onto the crowd. Before it can crush Ruby and the others, Night Light uses her embiggened hands to take hold of it. The boy releases a surge of energy, and produces a large scale of crystalline constructs everywhere, but Night Light manages to placate him. The boy gets away, leaving Night Light alone, and Ruby, along with the others, gathers around her, to prevent Damage Control from having her arrested. Before they can detain her, Night Light creates constructs in the air and escapes, and Ruby and the others cheer for her victory.

{{Quote|Ruby here with today's news. Everyone keeps asking me, "Ruby, do you know who she is?" If I knew who she was, I wouldn't tell you here.|Ruby to her TikTok followers|No Normal}}
After her encounter, Ruby records a TikTok of her experience, and denies any knowledge of the masked hero's identity, while also commenting on the difficulties she'll face, in finding a husband.
