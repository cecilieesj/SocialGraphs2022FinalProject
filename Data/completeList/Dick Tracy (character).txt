==Personality==
Dick is very good at his job, and he is usually tough on those who commit crime. He can also be nasty to criminals, as he has shown this when [[Itchy]] wants the phone, but he pulls the wire and throws the phone to him. He's also quite smart, as he refuses a bribe from [[Big Boy Caprice]].

He also puts his job before his personal life, but is also soft on those he truly cares about such as his girlfriend, [[Tess Trueheart-Tracy|Tess Trueheart]], and eventually the Kid (later to be known as [[Dick Tracy, Jr.]]).

He's also quite a capable fighter and able to show feats of strength.Â As shown when he beat [[Steve The Tramp]] into submission, despite the latter being taller and more muscular than him, knocking out 7 gangsters with one punch during a montage of arrests he was making when cracking down on Big Boy's operations and beating Big Boy himself with a flurry of punches after the latter was beating him with a lead pipe.

==Physical appearance==
Dick has a slender physique. His skin is quite fair. He has blue eyes and black hair. He wears both his trademark yellow trench coat and fedora hat with a black band that has a bow tie on it. He also wears a red necktie, black blazer, black vest, white dress shirt, and black pants and police shoes.
