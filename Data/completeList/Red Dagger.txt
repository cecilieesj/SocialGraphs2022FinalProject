*'''Combatant''': Kareem is skilled in various attack styles. He fought against Kamala, while she used her powers. When the Clandestines attacked the Red Daggers, he was able to fend them off, for a prolonged period of time.
*'''Noor Sensing''': Kareem has the ability to locate those who possess access to Noor, within close proximity. When Kamala arrives at the train station in Karachi, Kareem's senses lead him to her, where he mistook her for a member of the Clandestines.

Red Dagger first appears in the [[Seeing Red|fourth episode]]. Kareem senses the presence of Noor, which leads him to a train station in Karachi. He encounters a [[Ms. Marvel|masked American]], whom he believes to be a member of the [[Clandestines]], and the pair come to blows. Kareem battles her with his knives, but is no match against her power in creating energy constructs. The clash comes to a halt, when Kareem realizes she isn't a Clandestine, and questions how she got ahold of her [[bangle]], from Aisha. Kamala questions how he knows of Aisha, and Kareem hurries her from the station, when the authorities arrive.

He leads her to their secret headquarters, hidden behind A.B.C. Chinese Restaurant, and unmasks himself, and she precedes to do the same. [[Waleed]] introduces himself, and welcomes her, as the descendant of Aisha. The trio have lunch, and Waleed and Kareem explains the history and function of the [[Order of the Red Daggers|Red Daggers]], as well as how the [[Noor Dimension]] works and on the nature of the Clandestines motivations.

During the evening, Kareem introduces Kamala to his friends, and the group sit over a bonfire and music, as they share food. Kamala questions if the biryani is spicy, and he prompts her to try it, while teasing her, to his friend.

Kamala later returns to the Red Daggers Headquarters, where she displays her powers, in front of Kareem and Waleed. She is gifted a blue vest by Waleed, and Kareem gives admiration to her new look. At that moment, the Clandestines break through the glass ceiling, to capture Kamala. Kareem briefly battles with [[Aadam]], before he moves Kamala from harms way. Waleed barricades the entrance, to prevent them from taking hold of her, and once he manages to escape from them, the trio exit the building. They climb into an auto rickshaw, and Kareem drives them away, while the [[Saleem]] pursues them, in a rickshaw of his own. Aadam and [[Fariha]] commandeer a truck, which quickly begins to speed before them. The truck nudges the rickshaw, placing it sideways, and pushed against the truck. Kamala uses her powers to push the rickshaw off the truck, sending herself, Kareem and Waleed onto the aside, while the truck topples on the road. The other rickshaw begins to further catch up, and Kareem drive off again, but Waleed instructs them to detach the carriage, as it’s slowing the group down. Kareem drives the bike by itself, while Kamala grabs hold of him, but the pair crash into cars located in their incoming direction. They fly off, but safety land on constructs created by Kamala. Waleed instructs the pair to flee, while he fends off the Clandestines, from their direction. Saleem continues to run after them, and Kareem finds himself surrounded by three of the Clandestines. Kamala hits Saleem with a truck, and the pair flee together. They find themselves in alleyway, and Waleed throws two daggers, into Saleem, from a nearby balcony. The pair continue to run, and Waleed’s body crashes on ground before them, killed by Najma. Upon seeing her, Kareem tosses a flammable canister into a boiling pot, which bursts onto her. Kamala and Kareem escape through a door and emerge into a courtyard, and surrounded by hung clothing. Aadam and Fariha follow the pair, and burst through, to attack. Aadam strikes Kareem with his mace, but Kamala uses her powers to best him, and helps Kareem back up. Najma arrives and swings a blade towards them, catching Kareem on the side, and he briefly falls back. Aadam approaches him once again and the pair clash. Kareem cuts a clothes line to create cover for himself, and stabs Aadam from behind He joins Kamala’s side, as Najma attempts to strike her, but she misses the young heroine, and catches her bangle instead, releasing a burst of energy, sending Kareem, flying back.

Kareem comes to, to find that the Veil of Noor has materialised in the courtyard.  He watches as Fariha step towards it, before her body is petrified into rock, and she disintegrates. The Veil begins to expand, and Kamala creates a shield to protect Kareem, while he beckons the locals away from the area. Najma makes the decision to sacrifice herself and close it, and Kamala attempts to run after her, but Kareem holds her back. They watch as Najma gives her life, dying in the same manner Fariha did, as the Veil evaporates. Kamala's mother and grandmother, who were standing back, witness the whole thing and call her over. Muneeba questions who Kareem is, and he greets the pair, before awkwardly running off. After talking with her mother and grandmother, Kamala returns to him to say her final goodbyes. She asks if he'll be okay, and Kareem reassures her, he'll be fine, and tells Kamala that Waleed would be proud. She thanks him for everything, and he reminds her that he's just a call away, though warns that U.S. Government have hold some warrants on his arrest. Before they part ways, he removes his red scarf, and hands it to her.

A short while after Kamala returns to the U.S., Kareem recieves a call from her. She asks for help on the behalf of [[Kamran]], the son of Najma, and a former member of the Clandestines. She reminds Kareem, that she too, is related to the Clandestines, and needs his help, to get Kamran out of town. Kareem has a contact, who will be able to smuggle Kamran away, and requests that Kamala get Kamran to the harbor by midnight.

Kamran manages to escape from Damage Control, and meets Kareem's contact, who brings him to Karachi. There, Kareem meets with Kamran inside A.B.C. Restaurant.
