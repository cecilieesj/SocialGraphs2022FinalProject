==Background==
A techno-organic being, half-machine and half-eldritch alien being, he keeps the population of the planet Camazotz under his control with mind control that combines mind-controlling implants with his own cosmic powers. The brilliant scientist [[Mr. Murry|Dr. Alex (or Jack) Murry]] accidentally travels to Camazotz via the tesseract, at which point It makes Dr. Murry into another of his slaves, leading Megan to save him before it is too late. Dr. Murry's daughter, [[Meg Murry|Meg]], uses the tesseract to rescue her father, but in the process her brother, [[Charles Wallace Murry|Charles Wallace]], has his mind taken over by It/Red. In the end, Meg performs an act of true love, which destroys It and frees everyone from his control.

===[[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|''A Wrinkle in Time'' (2003)]]===
The It first appears in his headquarters Central Central Intelligence watching over Meg, Charles, and Calvin who have arrived at the planet Camazotz where the three manage to survive a violent sandstorm and end up in the local neighborhood to survive the area, followed by the three talking to a few local residents to know where the headquarters are at to which the three approach the Central Central Intelligence headquarters to face the It. Upon approaching, Dr. Murry's daughter, [[Meg Murry|Meg]], uses the tesseract to rescue her father.

Later, the It's agent, the Man with Red Eyes, appears in front of Meg, Charles, Calvin, and Mr. Murry where he faces the four to which Charles' father tells him to stay away from this being to which the Man denies, explaining that he helps his people achieve understanding by serving and being the voice. Despite the warnings given by Meg and her father, Meg's brother, Charles Wallace, then accepts his offer where the Man controls his mind under a corrupting influence where his mind is taken over by It in process. Charles, under the control of the malevolent being, puts Meg midair while Calvin and Meg's father attempt to rescue her and escape where Meg's father uses [[Mrs. Who]]'s pair of glasses to escape, much to the It's notice, causing Meg to be separated from her father and Calvin.

After Meg returns back to Camazotz, Meg arrives at the spot where Charles Wallace (under control by the Man with Red Eyes) who is serving the It at a dining room Meg confronts It where he offers a strawberry banana smoothie to Meg to which she rejects his offer. Later while confronting the It, Meg begins counting the numbers the elements of the periodic table from one to thirteen in order to which a vision of Calvin suddenly appears to distract Charles and get him out of the It's influence.

However, after Meg finds out that her return to the real world was all an illusion, Meg felt upset that Charles Wallace (still serving the Man with Red Eyes) sent her to the event that was actually part of It's lies. The Man with Red Eyes explains that he can make a very long and miserable life where he tosses a piece of chalk at Meg where she finds herself at the Westover Community School to which as the Man with Red Eyes appears, he explains to Meg that Charles has been a threat to him to which Meg denies, inspiring Meg to rescue Charles Wallace from then Man with Red Eyes. Thereupon, he confronts Meg, thinking she is a threat to Charles Wallace much to Meg explaining that she still loves him where Meg attempts to let Charles trust her to which he refuses to trust her at first, much to the It reacting to Meg attempting to get Charles Wallace to love her. After trying so hard, Meg performs an act of true love so that Charles can finally accept Meg's trust, which destroys the It and frees everyone from his control.
