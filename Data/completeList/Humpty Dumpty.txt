'''Humpty Dumpty''' is a cartoon character inspired by the popular nursery rhyme of the same name.

==History==
The original nursery rhyme has been dated all the way back to late eighteenth century England, though there is no definite source as to how it was conceived or what its meaning is. The rhyme has been altered over the centuries, but the most popular one to this day is as follows:

<poem>
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again
</poem>

==Trivia==
