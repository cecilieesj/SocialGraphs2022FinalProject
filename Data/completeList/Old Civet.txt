He is an unnamed, elderly Asian palm civet (hence his name) who lives on Dragon Island and gives travelers advise whenever they attempt to go to the other side of Dragon Island.

==Personality==
The old civet shows a serious personality whenever Kion and his team attempt to get to the other side of the island.

==Role in the series==
==="[[Dragon Island]]"===
On their way to the next moja kwa moja stone on the other side of the island, the Lion Guard encounters the old civet spying on Kion's team down below standing on a palm tree. Talking with the Guard, the old civet warns them that the other side of the island is danger, to which he is explaining to them that on the other side is an area of dangerous Komodo dragons that can kill their prey with a deadly bite. Giving the advice to the group, Kion and his group decide to go to the island to find the next stone, ignoring the civet's warning about the island's dangers.

Having found the moja kwa moja stone on the other side of the island, brought [[Lumba-Lumba]] back to the ocean, and defeated Ora and his two followers, the Guard decides to follow the path marked by the next moja kwa moja stone to which the old civet appears again talking to the Guard before they leave the island. Misinterpreting and confusing him, Bunga tells the civet that he and the Guard took care of Ora and his followers just as Bunga bids a farewell to the civet while the Lion Guard continues their journey to follow the path to the next stone.

==Trivia==
*He is the first civet to appear in the ''Lion King'' franchise.
