The '''Showgirl Birds''' are a group of white cockatoos who appear in [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]] as featured performers, singing "[[Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing]]".

==Background==
They descend from the ceiling in the middle of the theater, perched on a "Bird Mobile". Throughout the show, each Showgirl Bird is presented but in recent performances, Jos√© notices Rosita missing from her stand, explaining "I wonder what happened to Rosita..." before they sing "Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing".

The six lead singers of the group are Collette, Suzette, Mimi, Gigi, Fifi, and Josephine. A seventh member of the group, [[Rosita]], is famously missing and is finally placed after a long absence in the centerpiece of the [[The Tropical Hideaway|Tropical Hideaway]] restaurant, mingling with guests.

==Appearances==
===[[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room|The Enchanted Tiki Room]]===
As said above, they descend from the ceiling and perform the song "Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing". They later appear at the end of the show where all the inhabitants of the Tiki Room bid a farewell to guests.

===[[The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management)|Under New Management]]===
The Showgirl Birds only appear at the end of the show when the birds sing their own rendition of "Conga".

===[[The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!|Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!]]===
In this version of the attraction, the Showgirl Birds (referred to as the "Winged Wahines") only make a brief appearance where they perform "[[On the Beach at Waikiki]]". The song, however, is interrupted when the Tiki Birds discover them wearing plastic [[Stitch]] ears as they become disgusted as they plan on not finishing the song until Stitch is gone. Unlike in other versions of the show where they appear at the end, they do not participate during the end of the show.

=== [[The Tropical Hideaway]] ===
The Tropical Hideaway has the showgirl bird Rosita resting on luggage along the riverside of the [[Jungle Cruise]].  Here she cracks jokes and whistles for guests as she supposedly waits for a [[Jungle Navigation Company|Jungle Navigation Co.]] boat she has scheduled.

In addition to this, the birdhouses for all of the showgirl birds can be spotted atop the building with their names all listed.{{Enchanted Tiki Room}}
