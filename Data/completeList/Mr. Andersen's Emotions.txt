==Trivia==
*Mr. Andersen's Anger has better temperament than Riley's; when being strict with the daughter's attitude, he doesn't explode in flames. But he does a small explosion when trying to handle the possibility she is dating, nearly kicking Jordan out. His interactions with Fear, unlike Riley's, are more professional, treating him with respect as his second-in-command. He is also voiced by director [[Pete Docter]].
*In the movie, Anger and Fear are the only emotions of Mr. Andersen who speak, with Fear having the most dialogue. Mr. Andersen's Joy, Sadness and Disgust speak for the first time in ''[[Riley's First Date?]]''.
