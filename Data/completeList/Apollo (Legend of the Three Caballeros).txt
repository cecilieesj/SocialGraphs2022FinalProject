'''Apollo''' is a character who appears in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. He is based on the god of sun of the same name where he helps Xandra and the Three Caballeros return from the World Tree to the New Quackmore Institute.

==Background==
Apollo is the God of Sun who supports Xandra in helping the Caballeros return from the World Tree to the New Quackmore Institute. For transportation, Apollo rides on a chariot to bring Xandra and the Caballeros back to the New Quackmore Institute, providing the four good service and support. After Apollo drops off Xandra and the Caballeros to the Institute, he not only thanks Xandra but also thanks the Caballeros for saving the World Tree from Felldrake's evil plans. Apollo not only uses a chariot but also has a sun-themed watch which he uses to know when it is time for him to bring in the nighttime to which Apollo punctually departs from his chariot to bring in the nighttime.

==Role in the series==
In "[[No Man Is an Easter Island]]", Apollo is seen bringing [[Xandra]], [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]], [[José Carioca]], and [[Donald Duck]] back to the New Quackmore Institute where he rides on his chariot to which Apollo departs Xandra and the Caballeros to their destination. After Xandra thanks Apollo for giving the four a ride back to New Quackmore, Apollo not only thanks Xandra but also thanks the Caballeros for saving the World Tree from [[Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose|Felldrake]] who was planning for world domination in the [[World Tree Caballeros|previous episode]]. After thanking the Caballeros for saving the World Tree, Apollo checks his watch and notices that he is late for sunset. He then departs off with his chariot driving it into the sun to bring in the nighttime.

==Trivia==
*Despite his very brief appearance in the opening of "No Man Is an Easter Island", Apollo is prominently featured in the series' intro.
*The way Apollo drives into the sun to bring in the nighttime is an homage to the ''[[Fantasia]]'' [[Apollo (Fantasia)|iteration of Apollo]] from "[[The Pastoral Symphony]]" segment where said iteration drives his chariot during the evening during the end of the segment just before [[Morpheus (Fantasia)|Morpheus]] appears to bring in the nighttime.
