==Personality==
Although he is [[Samson (The Wild)|Samson]]'s father, not much of his personality is known throughout the film as he only appears in a flashback. In the flashback which is at a circus, he is shown to be extremely harsh towards his son by telling him to roar like an adult lion. When Samson tells his father he can't roar at a mechanical wildebeest, his father tells him to do it immediately to which Samson approached the mechanical wildebeest and attempted to roar at it, but ultimately makes a squeaky growl, disappointing his father and causing the crowd to laugh.

==Role in the film==
His only appearance in the film is in a flashback when Samson reveals to [[Ryan]] that he wasn't born in the wild but, in fact a circus. Before this confession, [[Benny (The Wild)|Benny]] the squirrel was the only one Samson ever told about his dark past.

In the flashback, Samson's Father is shown to have been very strict with Samson when he was a cub and one day he set him out to roar for the audience at the circus but Samson was only able to make a squeaky growl when trying to roar back at the mechanical wildebeest to impress the audience, which caused the audience to laugh at him. After this, Samson's ashamed father told him that if he was born in the wild, he would know how to roar before disowning his son and allowing him to be sent to the [[Central Park Zoo|zoo]]. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards, though he might still have been working with the circus or have died of old age before the events of the film.

Surrounded by [[Kazar]]'s predatory wildebeests, Ryan deems Samson a good father, a stark contrast compared to the one his grandfather was.

==Trivia==
*While ''The Wild'' itself is criticized for being a copy of ''Madagascar'', Samson's father's voice actor, Kevin Michael Richardson, would coincidentally later voice [http://madagascar.fandom.com/wiki/Maurice Maurice] and multiple characters in the animated series ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' and ''All Hail King Julien'', both of which are inspired by the aforementioned DreamWorks franchise.
