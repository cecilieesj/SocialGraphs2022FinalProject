In the opening credits of ''The Incredible Hulk'', Betty helps Bruce during an experiment involving gamma radiation that results in the creation of the Hulk. During the Hulk's first rampage, Betty is injured and hospitalized. By the time she comes to, Bruce has left.

Betty eventually reunites with Bruce at a pizzeria while she was at a date with Dr. Leonard Samson. She convinces Bruce to stay the night. The next day, General Thunderbolt Ross arrives on the Culver University campus and results in a massive battle between Ross's men and the Hulk. During the fight, the Hulk becomes protective of Betty and eventually flees with her, the two bonding in a cave that night.

The next day, Bruce and Betty travel to New York City to meet with Dr. Samuel Sterns. Sterns tests an antidote on Bruce, and while the pain from the antidote causes Bruce to turn into the Hulk, Betty reverts Bruce back to normal, causing the antidote to work. However, General Ross and his men capture the two. On their way back to Thunderbolt Ross's base, soldiers report that Emil Blonsky, now the Abomination, is on the rampage. Bruce, realizing that only the Hulk can stop the Abomination, transforms back into the Hulk and engages the Abomination in combat. Following the Abomination's defeat, Hulk and Betty share a moment before the Hulk leaves.

31 days later, Bruce arrived in a cabin and arranged to send Betty's necklace back to her.
