'''Mr. Jameson''' is a character in ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. He is the father of [[Keoni Jameson|Keoni]] and, on several occasions, [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]]'s employer. He owns several businesses around Kauai, including the [[Birds of Paradise Hotel]].

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Like his son [[Keoni Jameson|Keoni]], Mr. Jameson has tan skin, but has brown combed hair instead of red, and is usually seen wearing a pink shirt. He also has a lean and muscular build.

===Personality===
For the most part, Mr. Jameson is a jovial man who takes the work of his employees to an earnest degree. He is usually seen with a smile on his face and in a bright, happy atmosphere. However, he can be strict when it comes to having unwelcome visitors at his [[Birds of Paradise Hotel|hotel]]'s pool, which is only reserved for guests. Overall, he is nice and compliments people on their hard work. Despite being a businessman, he is very friendly but always keeps his nose on any potential money-making businesses. He also seems to be a fairly good father, as he and Keoni get along just fine.

==Role in the series==
Mr. Jameson appears in a few episodes, including "[[Cannonball (episode)|Cannonball]]", "[[Nosy (episode)|Nosy]]", "[[Melty (episode)|Melty]]", "[[Babyfier (episode)|Babyfier]]", and "[[Drowsy (episode)|Drowsy]]". He is mentioned in certain episodes by [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] when she begins working under Mr. Jameson as a [[Rental Hut|rental person]].

In "Cannonball", he kicked Nani and [[David Kawena|David]] and out of his [[Birds of Paradise Hotel|hotel]]'s pool because it was only allowed for guests.

In "Melty", he fired Nani because he couldn't afford her after [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]]'s antics caused one of his expensive hotels to be destroyed.

In "Babyfier", he was a victim of [[Babyfier]]'s de-aging powder, but was changed back to normal along with the rest of the babyfied adults. 

==Trivia==
*In the intro sequence of [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the series]], Mr. Jameson appears in two squares in the hula dance; however, his image and movements are not mirrored to one another.
