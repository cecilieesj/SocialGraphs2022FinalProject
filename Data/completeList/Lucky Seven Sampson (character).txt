He is a mischievous, but clever rabbit who claims to be born "beneath the lucky star" and confirms this with the number 7 being visible on his right rabbit's foot as a birthmark. He's a tramp that travels by sneaking onto cars or trucks and lives by stealing food from stores and strangers. Despite his mischievous behavior, which quickly gets him into trouble, he manages to escape any harm with little effort thanks to his luck. He also goes out of his way to sing and dance to children and says that "making people happy, that's my favorite game."

==Personality==
Lucky Seven Sampson is seen to be very helpful in teaching kids the multiplication table for the number 7, but is unaware of the anger and frustration he causes to the adults whenever he does so, but due to his good luck, he always manages to avoid harm, while leaving those he encountered with either good or confused opinions of him, such as the policeman, the guy he took the ice cream from, and the construction worker he took the huckleberry pie from, who were about to deal with him for the trouble he caused, only for him to stop them in bewilderment before apparently falling to his presumed death, to their shock, only to land safely in the back of a lettuce truck and make his escape until he might return in the future.

Being a tramp, he travels from town to town via sneaking into produce trucks and collecting food by simply stealing it from stores and complete strangers, making adults see him as a mischievous character, yet he always manages to escape any potential harm due to his good luck being a rabbit with the number 7 as a birthmark on his rabbit's foot. Kids see him not as adults see him, but as being very helpful when he teaches the kids, he meets their 7 multiplication table before taking his leave once he realizes he's overstayed his welcome and it is time to depart.
