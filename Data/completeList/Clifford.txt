Clifford is the only character introduced in ''The Jim Henson Hour'' to make any further appearances.

He is often seen wearing sunglasses and his multicolored dreadlocks give his appearance a Rastafarian feel. At one time, he was also a member of [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]].

After the ''Jim Henson Hour'', Clifford was planned to become the host of the next Muppet show. This was a decision kept by the company after Jim Henson’s death and became the basis for ''Muppets Tonight''. In the first episode, [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] asks a group of Muppets if any of them want to host the new show. Every other Muppet rushed out of the room except Clifford, resulting in him getting the job. 

During the ''Muppets Tonight'' era, Clifford's personality was changed from a cool, laid-back character to a more uptight and stressed out person, on account of the duties of being the host, putting him in Kermit's shoes. His appearance was changed as well; he was featured with eyes instead of his sunglasses for the first (and only) time and his casual clothes were replaced with a generic talk-show host outfit. 

After ''Muppets Tonight'' ended, Clifford returned in ''Muppets from Space'' and ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', where he was returned to his original sunglasses-look. At ''MuppetFest'', Kevin Clash revealed that he disliked the eyes, and would refuse to perform Clifford again, unless he was wearing his sunglasses.

According to Kermit, Clifford is no longer with the Muppets and went back to working as a bass guitarist and male model.
