He is designed to poke holes in water containers.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 036 was the 36th experiment created created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. He was designed to use his spiky tail to poke holes in water containers. 036 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At an unknown point, 036 was presumably activated, captured by [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]] and [[Stitch]], and named Poki.

In "[[Shoe (episode)|Shoe]]", Poki was one of the experiments that helped turn [[Jumba's Ship|Jumba's ship]] into a hotel.

In "[[Remmy (episode)|Remmy]]", Poki was one of the experiments in Lilo's dream.

===''[[The Origin of Stitch]]''===
Poki was one of the experiments that was gliding on the screen, but he is 575 instead of 036.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
In the film's opening, Poki can be seen with [[Slushy]] as the latter sells [[Shave Ice]].

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Poki, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, [[Lilo Pelekai|Lilo]], [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]], and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed.

Poki participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]].

The Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle, but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben, and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Poki was activated off-screen.
*Poki is one of the few experiments to not have his one true place revealed.
*He is also one of the few experiments to not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
