==Background==
===Official Description===
:''Legend is the Clade’s three-legged, perpetually happy family dog who unknowingly loves charging towards danger. When Ethan sneakily signs on for the mission to the strange world, his loyal companion remains by his side, eager as ever to please his human. However, his presence—and instinct to naively and energetically greet every stranger—may do more harm than good.''<ref>[https://whatsondisneyplus.com/strange-world-inside-scoop-on-the-characters-environments/ Strange World: Inside Scoop On The Characters & Environments]</ref>

==Trivia==
* His design is very reminiscent of [[Max (The Little Mermaid)|Max]], the Old English Sheepdog from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.
*He only has three legs meaning he might have gotten Osteosarcoma, which is a rare disease in dogs when they lose a leg.
