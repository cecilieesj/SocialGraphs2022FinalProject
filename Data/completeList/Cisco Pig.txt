===Physical Description===
Cisco Pig is a short and obese warthog with human hands, human ears, a shaven face, mustache that resembles tusks and he wears Old Western clothes. Unlike [[Pumbaa]], he has no warts.

==Role in the series==
Cisco Pig and his gang are about to rob a train. When Cisco Pig gets on the track to do so, he keeps missing the train. On his last attempt to rob it, it runs over him, making his gang think he's dead.
