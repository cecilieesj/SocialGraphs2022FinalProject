'''Bizz Leapyear, Buzztron, and Blip Laserfist''' are deleted characters in the [[2019]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]''. They are a trio of [[Buzz Lightyear]] lookalikes whom the real Buzz himself finds at [[the Carnival]] but for the final cut, they were deleted from the film. Therefore, they were replaced by [[Ducky and Bunny]] with the scene being reworked.

==Background==

===Development===
When the ''Toy Story 4'' film is set in a carnival, [[Josh Cooley]] (director of the film) has decided that the film would take place in the carnival where the toys would find toys that impersonate Buzz Lightyear where Buzz himself meets a couple of toys who impersonate him at the Star Adventurer carnival game. In the deleted scene, Bizz, Buzztron, and Blip descend down and approach Buzz Lightyear where they think Buzz is an imposter, to which Buzz explains that they are the ''real'' imitations of Buzz Lightyear. Bizz introduces herself as the "star comrade of the fifth allegiance", Buzztron introduces himself as the "space robo-leader of attack force in space", and Blip explains that he likes to dance. Bizz explains to the real Buzz that she and the other three plan to lure players into making carnival games like Star Adventurer almost impossible to win. Buzz asks the three of them to untie him to which instead of simply pulling the strap on Buzz, Buzztron instead throws a brick to help Buzz escape to which Buzz leaps down from the display wall as the three toys impersonating Buzz find Buzz's actions interesting. While trying to escape, the three help the real Buzz open the grate but they cannot and feeling exhausted, Buzz explains to the three of them that they have never been played with to which the three don't understand what playtime is to which Bizz and Buzztron explain that they are attractive prizes luring players who participate in Star Adventurer to have a very low chance of winning in which Bizz explains to Buzz that he is now one of the carnival toys who lure players into having very low chances of winning carnival games to which Buzz decides not to accept Bizz's offer. Suddenly, when a [[Axel|carnie]] opens Star Adventurer, he suddenly sees Buzz Lightyear out of the display wall in which the real Buzz and the three lookalikes of Buzz foil him in a plan to help Buzz escape. After escaping, Buzz feels disappointed with the three for foiling the carnie and stealing his wallet, as Buzz explains to the three that he will choose his own path and not follow them. Despite this, they continue following Buzz across the carnival.<ref>Deleted Scene "Knock-Offs" (''Toy Story 4'' Blu-ray bonus feature disc / Digital Formats).</ref>

For the final version, they were deleted and were replaced [[Ducky and Bunny]] and this scene was reworked.

==Trivia==
*Of all the imitations of Buzz Lightyear, Buzztron is the largest of the three and is the only one who is a robot type. Additionally, Blip Laserfist is the shortest of all the three.
