==Physical Appearance==
Either overweight or covered in padding, the Fixer is by no means a small individual. He has mint skin and blue hair. He also has a thick, scraggly beard beneath his green lips and a full face with dark bags under his eyes.

The Fixer is hardly ever seen without his floating chair and jumpsuit. Upon his head is a sort of hat of unknown make and purpose.
