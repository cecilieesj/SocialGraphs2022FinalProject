'''Vivian Garcia-Shapiro'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0162563/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2</ref> is a recurring character in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', voiced by Eileen Galindo. She is [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella]]'s mom. She enjoys playing in a jazz band with [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher|Linda]] and [[Jeremy Johnson|Jeremy]]'s moms. She lives across the street with Isabella as well as [[Pinky the Chihuahua|Pinky]], and has a rapid way of speaking.

==Background Information==
*Vivian has only spoken in 12 episodes in the entire show. She has made cameo appearances in a few more episodes.
*Oddly, Vivian seems to embody both of her last names: She appears to be Hispanic, yet speaks with a Yiddish accent.
*She revealed that she is a descendant from Mexican-Jewish roots ("[[Picture This]]").
*Based on the mixture of her appearance and speech patterns, she may have been raised in a Mexican-Jewish household. It is also possible that she adopted some mannerisms from Isabella's yet-unnamed father, whom many speculate to be of Jewish descent.
*In "[[The Fast and the Phineas]]", Vivian reveals that Candace, at some point in her life, was wearing braces. She also thinks Candace is too thin, and encourages her to eat by offering her a matzo-burrito ("Picture This"). She may enjoy the burritos herself, which is a marriage of staple foods in both Mexican and Jewish cultures.
*Vivian calls her daughter "Isa" ("[[Hide and Seek (Phineas and Ferb)|Hide and Seek]]"), which is a common shortening of her name in Spanish-speaking countries.
*Vivian is shown to most likely be married since she has a wedding ring ("No More Bunny Business") although she is never seen wearing it.
*She has an aunt who in turn has a sister. ("[[Agent Doof]]")
*She can be seen at the Love Handel reunion concert, so she is probably a fan.
*She was seen walking with a man at the neighborhood party, presumably her husband. ("[[Love at First Byte]]")  She was also dancing with him in "[[Happy New Year!]]".
