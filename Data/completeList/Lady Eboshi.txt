[[File:Eboshi.png|thumb|250px]]
'''Lady Eboshi''' is the main antagonist of the [[1997]] [[Studio Ghibli]] film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (Although, some could argue the Monk [[Jigo]] is the bad guy whom she is working for). She was voiced by YÅ«ko Tanaka in the original version and [[Minnie Driver]] in the English dub.

== Personality ==
While she is the closest thing the movie has to the main antagonist, she is not really a villain. She is still likable and is well aware of the consequences of war. She just wants to create peace amongst the other humans. She doesn't want to harm the forest animals but has to hunt down the spirit god.
