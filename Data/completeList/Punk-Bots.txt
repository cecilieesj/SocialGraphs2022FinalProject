{{Quote|Let's destruction commence, eh lads? Rock 'n' roll!|Lead Punk-Bot}}
The '''Punk-Bots''' are a trio of mechanical delinquents from the [[Disney XD]] series, ''[[Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja]]''. Created by [[Willem Viceroy]], they serve as the primary antagonists of the episode "[[McSatchlé]]". The leader is voiced by [[Billy Idol]].

==Background==
Viceroy programmed the Punk-Bots to rouse rabble at the McSacStore as part of the latest plan to lure the Ninja out of hiding. Once the Punk-Bots were activated and parachuted down, they started snatching up McSatchlés and causing random destruction. Of course, this didn't go unnoticed, and [[Randy Cunningham]] transformed into the Ninja and confronted them. When Randy thought he'd beaten them, Viceroy activated their secret surprise. The satchels they had swiped combined to form a suit of indestructible armor around them. However, the zippers on the satchels weren't made of the same material due to McFist wanting to reduce the production cost. Randy was able to remove the armor from the Punk-Bots after learning about said weakness and finished them off with a Ninja Hot Ball once they were exposed.

The Punk-Bots later appears in the episode "[[Escape from Scrap City]]". When Randy and [[Hannibal McFist]] ended up crash-landing in the junkyard called [[Scrap City]], McFist found out the Punk-Bots (as with all the others in the junkyard) were still loyal to him. The Punk-Bot leader sent out a seemingly cute-looking robot named Dale to lure the Ninja to the arena. After McFist started mocking the way Randy fell for the trap, the Punk-Bot revealed the rest of the plot. The Punk-Bot put both McFist and the Ninja on trial for sending him and many other machines to the junkyard in a fight-to-the-death event. When both combatants declined to carry on, the Punk-Bot activated a [[Destructo-Bot]] to finish them both. Randy did battle with the infernal contraption and managed to destroy it using its own saw blades, destroying the arena's gate in the process. Randy and McFist managed to escape the arena with many of the robots in pursuit. Randy was able to hold them off long enough for Mort Weinerman to pick them up. The Punk-Bot grabbed onto the vehicle, but McFist closed the door on him and sent him plummeting back into the junkyard.
