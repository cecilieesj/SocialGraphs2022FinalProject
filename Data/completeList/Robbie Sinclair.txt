==Personality==
Robbie is an average teenager. He's a bit of a rebel, questioning his father's authority and often playing a part in episodes focusing on environmental issues.

==Role in the series==
Robbie Sinclair (full name Robert Mark Sinclair) is [[Earl Sneed Sinclair|Earl]] and [[Frances Sinclair|Fran Sinclair]]'s teenage son. Although beginning the series at 15, Robbie celebrates his sixteenth birthday in the first season episode "[[The Howling]]". Intelligent but conflicted, Robbie is frequently torn between teenage hormones and general rebellion and more specific questioning of such institutions as "Hurling Day" or the general motives of [[WESAYSO]] and [[the Chief Elder]].

==Trivia==
*Robbie is the only member of the Sinclair family to ever wear shoes; the rest of them appear barefoot.
