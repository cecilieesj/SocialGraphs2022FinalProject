'''Slue-Foot Sue''' is a cowgirl from the ''[[Pecos Bill]]'' segment of the [[1948]] film, ''[[Melody Time]]''.
==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Slue-Foot Sue has a curvy, slender build, with fair skin, blue eyes, red braided hair, red lips, and rosy cheeks. For her attire, she wears a green shirt with a brown sleeveless vest and a brown skirt with brown boots and a white cowboy hat and gloves. For her wedding day, she wears a beautiful yellow wedding dress with a huge steel-spring bustle and a long skirt covering her boots.

===Personality===
Slue-Foot Sue is a redhead in braids from another part of her world. She is a thrill-seeking daredevil with no fear or shame for anything. In the end, she was self-shot to the moon where she stays due to [[Pecos Bill (character)|Bill]]'s jealous horse [[Widowmaker]], as well as her decision to wear a bustle while riding said horse.

==Appearances==
===''[[Melody Time]] ''===
Slue-Foot Sue is presented as a catfish riding cowgirl. She captures the attention of Pecos Bill and the two fall in love. The two eventually make plans to marry. The day of the ceremony, Sue dresses in a beautiful yellow wedding dress with a huge steel-spring bustle and insists on riding Widowmaker, Pecos Bill's horse. However, Widowmaker is jealous of Sue, because she had taken away Bill's attention from him. As soon as Sue got on Widowmaker's back, he attempts to throw Sue off in a fit of rage. Admirably, she is able to stay on the bucking horse for quite a while. But because of the bustle she wears, Sue starts bouncing out of control and ends up shooting herself high into the air. Her bustle continues to bounce her higher each time she lands on it, and Bill attempts to rescue her with his lasso, but misses thanks to Widowmaker. At night, Sue finally bounces to the moon and stays there, leaving Bill to mourn her loss. The narrator then adds that this is why coyotes howl at the moon. It's presumed that Sue eventually dies from lack of oxygen(but as this is an animation, especially Disney, who knows what actually happened to it on the moon).

Slue-Foot Sue appears in the episode "[[House of Crime]]".
