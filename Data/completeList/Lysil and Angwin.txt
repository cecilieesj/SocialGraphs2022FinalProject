'''Lysil and Angwin''' are two former antagonists in ''[[Amphibia]]''. They are conjoined twin olms  who used to eat anyone who travel through Quarreler's Pass until they befriended two human girls and a frog family ([[Sprig Plantar|two particu]][[Polly Plantar|lar members]] whom they previously tried to eat).

== Background ==
===Physical Appearance===
Lysil and Angwin are large Olms. Each olm's side of the body have a different color from each otherâ€”Lysil's is purple and Angwin's is light pink while both of their bodies are covered in scars. They are also blind, hence the bleached eyes, and have two glowing branched gills forming tufts atop their heads.

===Personality===

==Role in the series==
Halfway to [[Newtopia]], [[Sprig Plantar|Sprig]] and [[Polly Plantar|Polly]] will not stop bickering, so [[Hop Pop Plantar|Hop Pop]] drops them off at Quarreler's Pass, a split road to let travelers vent their frustrations. The two continue to fight until they end up in a cave belonging to a two headed olm who intends to devour. They finally put their differences aside and use their vocal mimicry to get the olm to fight with themselves and escape where they reunite with Hop Pop and Anne.

During [[King Andrias]]' [[Frobots|Frobot]] military reign in [[Amphibia (location)|Amphibia]] Anne, the Planters and [[Sasha Waybright|Sasha]] come to see them to ask about [[Mother Olm]]. The Twins explain that they used to be night patrol guards of the city of Proteus until they were banished for carelessly letting intruders pass through Proteus due to their arguing with each other. Anne convinces  Lysil and Angwin to take them to Proteus. [[Parisia]], the guardian of the city of Proteus who is stubbornly in denial about King Andrias' forces closing in on them and refuses to help or be offered help from others. However after Lysil and Angwin both agree to put their lives on the line to rescue Proteus from a giant drill and after Sasha insults her for continuing to deny everything, Parisia was so impressed she allows the group to see the Mother of Olms and begrudgingly allowed the twins back into the Proteus (under heavy supervision).

== Trivia ==
