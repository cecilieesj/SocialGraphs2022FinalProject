'''Colonel Houndstoothe'''<ref>Page 2 of ''[[America Sings (soundtrack)|America Sings]]'' soundtrack book</ref> is a character at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]].

==History==

===Background===
Colonel Houndstoothe is an anthropomorphic Basset hound. In the "Going South" sequence of the attraction, he is seen sitting quietly on his rocking chair while the song, "[[Wikipedia:My Old Kentucky Home|My Old Kentucky Home]] is played in the background. Throughout the sequence, he is briefly seen saying, "It's the good life" just before the song resumes and loops into "[[Wikipedia:Polly Wolly Doodle|Polly Wolly Doodle]]" performed by the [[Swamp Boys]].

===Development History===
Colonel Houndstoothe was created for the [[America Sings]] attraction at [[Disneyland]] in the [[Tomorrowland (Disneyland)|Tomorrowland]] section where he was placed in the "Going South" sequence, which opened on [[June 29]], [[1974]]. However, America Sings closed on [[April 10]], [[1988]] in order to retheme the attraction to [[Innoventions]], with Houndstoothe and most of the animatronics moved to [[Splash Mountain]] at the [[Critter Country (Disneyland)|Critter Country]] section, which opened on [[July 17]], [[1989]].

As of [[2020]], the Disneyland version of Splash Mountain was announced for closure of having the attraction being completely reimagined into a [[The Princess and the Frog|''Princess and the Frog'']]-[[Tiana's Bayou Adventure|themed attraction]] in order to remove references to ''[[Song of the South]]'' due to outdated cultural depictions from the film itself which the attraction is based on. Therefore, it is currently unknown of what will replace Houndstoothe's animatronic in the rethemed version of the attraction.

==Appearances==

===[[America Sings]]===
Colonel Houndstoothe was featured during the former attraction's first act, "Going South" where he is seen during the "[[Wikipedia:My Old Kentucky Home|My Old Kentucky Home]]" sequence. As the song plays, Houndstoothe then says, "It's the good life" while sitting quietly on his rocking chair while observing the landscape. Just as Houndstoothe continues sitting on his rocking chair, the ears of corn open themselves to reveal the yellow part inside just before the sequence fades with birds heard chirping in the background just as the weathervane on Houndstoothe's hut briefly spins. The sequence then fades into the "[[Wikipedia:Polly Wolly Doodle|Polly Wolly Doodle]]" sequence.

===[[Splash Mountain]]===
In the California version of Splash Mountain, Houndstoothe can be seen during the "[[Everybody's Got a Laughing Place]]" sequence where he is seen quietly sitting on a rowboat where he is seen with several beehives on his boat, albeit his hat placed on it.

==Trivia==
*Colonel Houndstoothe's name is derived from the word "houndstooth", a checkered pattern which resembles a canine's tooth used in articles of clothing and jackets.
