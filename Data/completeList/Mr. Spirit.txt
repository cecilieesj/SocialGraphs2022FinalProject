'''Mr. Spirit''' (generically credited as '''Disney Narrator''') is a character who appears in ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''.

==Background==
Mr. Spirit's face appears on a teapot appearing as a reflection of Donald himself. He is very kind in helping Donald control his anger ever since he was refleting in the Pool of Self-Reflection as Donald had a hard time controlling his anger at the Shangri-La Resort and Spa as part of the Resort's policies given out by the [[Yeti|yeti staff]]. Thanks to his advice, Donald was able to conquer his anger at the Pool of Self-Reflection so that Donald can leave the Shangri-La Resort and Spa with Daisy.

==Role in the series==
In "[[Shangri-La-Di-Da]]" when [[Donald Duck|Donald]] is facing his anger reflection, Donald finds himself in a dream while attempting to deal with his anger issues where he faces a teapot behind him. Mr. Spirit's face appears and talks to Donald to know what brought him here to which he plans to take a look at the wrong actions Donald did before he started dealing with his anger issues. Mr. Spirit then recaps the wrongful actions Donald did in the previous episodes before looping back to Donald himself. After recapping the montage, Donald talks to Mr. Spirit explaining to him that he has an anger problem to which he explains to Donald that owning up is the first step to recovery. In order to help Donald deal with his anger, Mr. Spirit gives Donald a leaf to relax on so he can help deal with his anger issues. He then tells Donald to wake up and have a better behavior so that he can deal with his anger issues. Donald manages to conquer his anger issues, causing the yeti staff to allow Donald and [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] to leave the Shangri-La Resort and Spa.

==Trivia==
*Compared to [[Donald's Kettle|the reflection seen on Donald's tea kettle]] in the [[Dope-a Cabana|first episode]], Mr. Spirit's face which appears on a teapot in Donald's dream is much kinder compared to the previous one. Coincidentally, they occasionally use the word "Wink" in sentences.
