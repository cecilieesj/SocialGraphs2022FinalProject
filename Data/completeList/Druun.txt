The '''Druun''' are the main antagonists of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2021]] animated feature film ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''. They are a mindless plague born from human conflict and discord. The Druun have the ability to turn living creatures into stone, namely humans and dragons, and multiply every time they do so.

==Background==
The Druun are said to be a mindless plague that spreads like a relentless wildfire, consuming everything in their path until there is nothing left but ash and stone. They wander [[Kumandra]] and target any living creature they encounter, turning everything into statues. However, the Druun are repelled by both the [[Dragon Gem]] and water. The Druun are born from human malice; they bear no discernible goal beside consuming everything in their path.

When the Druun emerged, the land was completely ravaged as many living beings fell victim to them with no way of fighting back. To save humanity, a group of dragons combined their magic to form an orb that could keep away the Druun. It worked, yet all dragons remained as statues, except for [[Sisu]]. The orb, known as the Dragon Gem, survived and came under the protection of [[Heart (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Heart]]. 

==Role in the film==
After the banishment of the Druun, [[Kumandra]] was divided into five distinct tribes. The tribes constantly fight for ownership over the [[Dragon Gem]], believing that it has magical properties that can make their own land flourish. However, when the orb breaks during a scuffle, the Druun are awakened once again. In a desperate bid to save her [[Chief Benja|father]] and eliminate the Druun for good, [[Raya]] makes it her mission to find [[Sisu]] to help restore the Dragon Gem pieces.

The Druun make their last assault on [[Fang (Raya and the Last Dragon)|Fang]], nearly wiping out all of the remaining population. It is only thanks to the efforts of Raya and her friends, the Dragon Gem is restored to its original form, releasing a massive shockwave of pure dragon magic that banishes the Druun from Kumandra for good, ending their reign of terror. All of the victims, including the family members of Raya, [[Boun]], [[Tong]], and [[Noi]], and even all the dragons, that were turned to stone by the Druun are revived.

== Trivia ==
* The Druun immediately succeeds [[King Runeard]] in [[Frozen II|''Frozen II'']] as a villain from the [[Disney Animated Canon]] to die.
* Originally, in one version of the story, the Druun were portrayed as two-legged human-like monsters.
