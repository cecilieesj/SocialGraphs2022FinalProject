'''Helen Pevensie''' is a character who appears in the [[2005]] Disney/[[Walden Media]] adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.

==Background==
Helen serves as the mother of [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]]. Though she cares about them, she leads them to safety when it comes to the dangers of the air raid in London.

==Role in the film==
During the dangers of World War II in London, the Pevensie family is forced to evacuate with Helen telling her children to escape to which upon leaving the house, the family ended up finding shelter as they manage to escape from the air raid in time. To stay safe, Helen sends the children to a train station where she sends them to safety where the Pevensies board the train where the children arrive at Professor Digory Kirke's mansion just as the Pevensies emotionally bid her a farewell. She is not seen again afterwards.

==Video game appearances==

===''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (video game)]]''===
Helen appears as a non-playable character in the video game adaptation of the Disney film, doing the same role she did in the film where she sends the children to safety at the Professor's house. Like in the film, she only appears in the first level of the game which does the same plot used for the film.

==Trivia==
*Though her name is mentioned in the books, she never appears in the books. The name "Helen" was used on the Disney/Walden Media adaptation of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''. While deciding a proper name for the character, some of Helen's possible names include Violet and Miriam (and possibly others) while filming, but her name "Helen" was finally chosen. Helen is the name of C.S. Lewis' wife, the mother of [[Georgie Henley]] (the actress who plays [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]]), and the name of the First Queen of Narnia.
