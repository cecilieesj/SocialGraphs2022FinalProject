==Role in the series==
Earl is one of the lead characters in the television series ''Dinosaurs''. Identified as a ''[[wikipedia:Megalosaurus|Megalosaurus]]'', Earl is the 43-year-old head of his family, consisting of his wife [[Frances Sinclair|Fran]], teenage children [[Robert Mark Sinclair|Robbie]] and [[Charlene Sinclair|Charlene]], mother-in-law [[Ethyl Phillips]] and infant son [[Baby Sinclair]]. Married for over 15 years, Earl tends to take his more sensible wife for granted, who often brings him down to earth with a sharp "Earl Sneed Sinclair!" Earl's own family background is seldom delved into, but he was the class runt in high school and has an estranged sister, country singer, [[Pearl Sinclair]]. He is given two common nicknames--''Pally Boy'' by [[Roy Hess]] and ''Not the Mama'' by Baby.

Employed as a low-level tree-pusher for the voluminous [[WESAYSO]] Corporation, Earl is old-fashioned and resentful as his family often tries to break with dinosaur tradition, yet usually caves in (though in the show's final episode, "[[Changing Nature]]," he is very supportive of new technology).

Earl's best friend is [[Roy Hess]] and it's sometimes unclear whether work is a refuge from home or home is a refuge from work. In particular, Earl struggles with being a new father again and Baby Sinclair's continual address of "Not the Mama" over "Daddy" is a source of frustration. One such attempt to win his youngest son's approval involved adopting the superhero persona Captain Impressive ("[[Earl, Don't Be a Hero]]"). Earl's other desire, outside of being left alone to snack and drink beer, is to achieve recognition from [[Bradley P. Richfield|B.P. Richfield]] and the outside world, whether by becoming "[[Employee of the Month]]" or through laying claim as the discoverer of [[Sinclair City]] ("[[The Discovery]]").

Though usually content to watch television and avoid serious thought, Earl could be occasionally galvanized into action by either his family or a delayed conscience. His achievements during the series' run included running for [[The Chief Elder|Chief Elder]] ("[[And the Winner is...]]"), becoming the network's lead television programmer ("[[Network Genius]]"), and trading places with a tree ("[[If I Were a Tree]]"). Earl also used to play the accordion and was surprisingly good at it ("[[Swamp Music]]").

Despite his occasional moments of enlightenment, the well-meaning but dense Earl ultimately contributes to the extinction of his entire species ("Changing Nature").

==Behind the Scenes==
Earl was a full-bodied, realistic animatronic puppet with the facial radio controls operated by [[Dave Goelz]] in season 1 and the first part of season 2 and by Mak Wilson for the rest of the series' run. The bodysuit was performed by [[Bill Barretta]] (in one of his earliest Henson projects) and, on occasion, [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Fisher Tom Fisher].

==[[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Parks]]==
Earl and the rest of the show's main cast appeared in a Dinosaurs-based parade at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] when the series was running.

==Quotes==
*"You do that one more time and I'm gonna throw you across the room!"
*"All right, that ends right now. I've had it up to here with this 'Not the Momma'. I am not 'Not the Momma', I'm your daddy, and you only get one, buster, and that's what you're gonna call me. Daddy. Now say, 'Daddy.'"
*"Honey, I'm home!"
*"Exactly! And it's that kind of delusion that's made our country what it is today."
*"As you can see, I have separated all known dinosaur wisdom into three categories: animal, vegetable, rocks."
*"Water is the opposite of fire, which we have previously established as a vegetable. What's the opposite of a vegetable? Fruit. So, water is a fruit! Fruit is not a vegetable, so it has to be either an animal or a rock. We know it's not an animal. Therefore, fruit is a rock."
*"Son, under our system, a guy can't muscle his way to the top without any opposition. We are required by our constitution to let the voters think they have a choice. That's democracy."
