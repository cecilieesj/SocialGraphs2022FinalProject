== Background ==
Melephant Brooks is one of the senior toys in [[Bonnie]]'s collection. However, since he's a senior, he is mostly in the closest alongside the other senior baby toys, though before that he was played with plenty, liking the game house.

===Physical appearance===

== Appearances ==

=== [[Toy Story 4|''Toy Story 4'']] ===
Melephant Brooks is first seen in the beginning of the film, alongside all of Bonnie's other toys, with [[Dolly]] comforting them, that whenever [[Mrs. Anderson]] comes to clean the room, they are put in the closet, with [[Woody |Woody]] trying to lead, though he is stopped, though after she finishes breakfast, Bonnie comes to play town, casting her toys in roles: Dolly as mayor, Hamm as the banker, Slinky as the ice cream man, Trixie as the hat shop owner, Buzz as the mailman, Mr. Pricklepants as the baker, and finally the Sheriff, which she pulls out Woody's tag and gives it to Jessie, with Melephant, the other baby toys, [[Old Timer]] and Woody behind.

After Woody is left behind, he first seems distressed but upon Melephant and the other toys watching him, he plays it off, with them going to the window finding out that Bonnie was playing hat-shop, with them remembering when she played house with them, Melephant liking the game, calling it simple.

Then, when Old Timer realizes the fact that Woody got a dust ball, they seem excited to to give it a name (symbolizing he is being used less and less), though the cowboy pays little attention, though when Chairol mentioned tumbleweed, Melephant thought it made plenty of sense. However, when Dolly went to check up with Woody, only Melephant and the other toys are present, seeming confused on the events.

Melephant then comes to say that he knows everything about love, though when Forky asks how do you get love, he tells him no idea! Though when Carl and Chairol respond incorrectly, Melephant declares that he will act it out with Chairol, doing so. However, Forky declares love boring, startling Melephant as then, Carl begins crying, revealing he has feelings for Chairol, startling the spork and the other baby toys. However, suddenly Bitey White then confronts Carl, cross that he loves Chairol, though he is in a relationship with Bitey, Carl stating his love with Bitey was a lie. As trouble insures, Melephant then comes forth saying when he fake kissed Chariol he wanted Carl and Bitey to break up so he could date, Bitey, much to her excitement, though Chairol then states when they fake kissed, she felt something, leading to a large argument, with [[Forky]] seeming very interests, seeming to join the fight
