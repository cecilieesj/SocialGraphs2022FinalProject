'''Prince Yen Moon''' is a character from the ''[[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' episode "[[The Magnificent Seven Gummies]]".

He is the prince from [[Shangwu]], a kingdom in the [[Asia|Far East]], who decided to travel to [[Dunwyn Castle|Dunwyn]] in order to find [[Gummi Bears]].

After a long journey, he collapses in the courtyard of Dunwyn Castle. He is received at the court of [[King Gregor]], who is pleased to have a visitor from Asia come to Dunwyn, but regrets to inform him that no reports have been made of Gummi Bear sightings in Dunwyn for over 500 years.

[[Cavin]] decides to tell Gruffi about the occurrence when he sees Prince Yen Moon hold a jade Gummi statue, which [[Zummi Gummi|Zummi]] later says was a token from the Great Gummies. The Gummies agree to meet Yen Moon, who asks for their assistance in banishing a [[Dragons|dragon]] that has been wolfing down the crops of Shangwu.

The prince is willing to return a favor, and agrees to solve a problem in [[Gummi Glen]] in exchange for their help. Prince Yen Moon fixes the broken air conditioning in Gummi Glen (by repairing a broken gear which powered a machine at Moria Mountain, that is supposed to circulate mountain air through the Glen's vast tunnel systems).

In return, the Gummies travel to Shangwu, where they are amazed at experiencing a kingdom where humans know about Gummi Bears and receive them as honored guests. The Gummies decide to follow the same path as their ancestors, and use strategy and magic to foil the troublesome dragon.
