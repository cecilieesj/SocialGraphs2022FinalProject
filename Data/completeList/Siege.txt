==History==
He is a soldier who is aggressive and has a strong hatred for the Ducks (particularly [[Check "Grin" Hardwing|Grin]], due to the large duck being able to go toe-to-toe with him on a daily basis and generally win or draw in the fight). He can also be viewed as Dragaunus' military advisor & weapons expert, though the window is pretty wide. His cruel nature is mechanically and technologically minded, and he believes that brute force is the only means of victory. He often builds weapons and vehicles and directly uses them against the Ducks. He scoffs the dark magic of the ancient Saurians, but Dragaunus seems a little more tolerant and opens to his ideas as a result. However, when he fails, he gets little better treatment than the others in the group.
