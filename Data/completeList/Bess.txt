[[File:Bess5.png|thumb|250px]]'''Bess''' is the art-talent fairy at [[Tinker Bell]]'s [[Pixie Hollow]]. While she's the best artist around, when she starts painting, look out! Things can get messy pretty quick.
==History==
She is outgoing, caring, and fun to be around. She loves to paint. Her favorite of many friends are Lily and Quill. Bess gets so involved in her creations that she often doesnâ€™t notice that she has paint splattered on her clothes and in her hair.

Bess's studio is made out of an old tangerine crate which washed up on the beach one day. It is her favorite place to be in the world.

Bess' best known paintings are the ones of Mother Dove that she paints every year. The first was painted around the time [[Prilla]] came to Pixie Hollow. She is considered the most talented art fairy in Pixie Hollow.
