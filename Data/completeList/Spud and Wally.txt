'''Spud and Wally''', are two criminals and the major antagonists from [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]'s 1992-1993 animated series, ''[[Goof Troop]]''.

==Background==
They're the two crooks who literally steal Pete's house in "[[Nightmare on Goof Street]]", who makes off with his RV and kidnap Max in "[[O, R-V, I N-V U]]", and holds him for a ransom in "[[The Good, the Bad and the Goofy]]", in which they are finally incarcerated.

===Personality===
Even though their personalities were as dimwitted, stupid, mean, and cruel, but they are described in the latter of the episodes as "two of the most wanted crooks in the country".

===Physical Appearances===
Wally is a slender, tall and lean, anthropomorphic weasel with long brown hair and a shaven face and wears a dark lavender purple hat with a very dark purple stripe, a dark cocoa brown suit jacket, tan brown sagging pants with a belt and a purple shirt.

Spud is an obese, stout, bare-footed anthropomorphic dog with red curly wig-like hair and wears gray pants with a belt and a light blue long-sleeved shirt with only a button tucked in, a brown jacket and a light tan hat with a black stripe.

==Role in the series==
They make their debut in "''[[Nightmare on Goof Street]]''" when they trick Pete into letting them take his house apart. After Pete realizes they have stolen his house, He (along with Goofy's help) gets the house back. But the crooks escape.

Their next appearance as the main antagonists, is in "''[[O, R-V, I N-V U]]''". They trick Max into giving them a tour of the RV so he could impress Pete as partner. But they steal it and kidnap Max as a hostage. After P.J. rescues Max the crooks are then fought by the two boys. However, they destroy the RV in the process.

Their final appearance is in "''[[The Good, the Bad and the Goofy]]''". After Goofy and Pete defeat them once and for all, they are taken to prison.

==Trivia==
*Spud and Wally were also used from the characters, [[Jasper and Horace]] in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1961]] animated feature film, ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.
*They are the most frequent villains in the series. Although Giblet appeared in the same number of episodes, he mostly served as the anti-hero.
