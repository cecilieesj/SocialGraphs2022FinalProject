==History==
she was a rich and beautiful young woman in life who checked in with her husband on their honeymoon night in 1942, but the next day, he went off to fight in World War II. Irene waited for 3 years, but he never came back. It turned out that he had met an Italian woman and they opened up a pizza parlor in Naples. After finding out this shocking revelation, Irene grew angry and, in a fit of rage, threw the silver hairbrush her cheating husband gave to her before he left at her mirror. As it shattered, one of the flying glass pieces cut her, and she died.
