The '''Sirens''' are deleted villains from the 2020 Disney/Pixar film, ''[[Onward]]''.

==Background==

===Development===
The Sirens were created to be villains in ''Onward'' and appear as shifty Real-Estate agents who sell rundown homes on the foundation of a sinking swamp. They appeared in a deleted scene where they are encountered by [[Ian Lightfoot]] and another deleted character, [[Jenny (Onward)|Jenny]]. They hypnotize the teens into staying in one of their homes which begins to sink along with them, but they can't escape due to being hypnotized. Fortunately, Ian's brother, [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]], comes to their rescue when he is revealed to be immune to the sirens singing and sings very off-key, which is a weakness for them and this also snaps Ian and Jenny out of their hypnosis.

They were soon cut, because the people behind ''Onward'' believed that a villain for the film was unnecessary.
