She is designed to use her spring-like body to launch boulders. Her one true place is helping people reach high heights.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
Sproing is a dark navy blue and white koala-like experiment. She vaguely resembles [[Stitch]] with a coiled, spring-like body, a large white patch on her face, a wide mouth, red round nose, large, dark eyes, and two small ears and antennae.

===Powers and abilities===
Sproing can launch boulders by using her spring-like body, bounce and jump really high. She is able to hold heavy weights with her strong coils.

==Appearances==
===''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''===
Experiment 249 was the 249th genetic experiment created by [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] with [[Dr. Hämsterviel|Hämsterviel]]'s funding. She was designed to launch boulders. 249 and the other first 624 experiments were deactivated and smuggled to Earth by Jumba during his mission to capture [[Stitch|Experiment 626]].

All of the experiment pods were released and scattered across the island of Kauai.

At some point, 249 was activated, captured, tamed, and named Sproing.

===''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''===
Sproing was seen when [[Lilo_Pelekai|Lilo]] was making her rounds with [[Scrump]] to check on all of the experiments, and she finished up near the movies, where Sproing was elevating a man who was changing the letters on the display outside the theater.

Later, the first 624 experiments, including Sproing, were rounded up by [[Leroy]] and taken to a stadium to be destroyed. However, Lilo, [[Stitch]], [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]], [[Pleakley]], [[Reuben]] and [[Captain Gantu|Gantu]] arrived before the experiments could be destroyed

Sproing participated in the following battle between the experiments and the [[Leroy Clones|Leroy clones]] by trapping Leroys in her coils.

However, the Leroys soon gained the upper hand in the battle but were defeated when Lilo, Stitch, Reuben and several other experiments performed the song "[[Aloha ʻOe]]", which caused the Leroy army to shut down due to the original Leroy's fail-safe.

==Trivia==
*Her unique design is a reference to {{WikipediaLink|Slinky}} toys.
*Sproing is one of the few experiments who does not appear in the group photo at the end of ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]''.
