'''Lewis' Mother''' is his biological parent and a minor character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2007]] animated feature film, ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''. She had such an influence on [[Lewis Robinson]] that it was her that inspired him to invent his [[Memory Scanner]].

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
Only a few brief glimpses of her face are seen in the beginning and toward the ending when [[Wilbur Robinson]] takes [[Lewis Robinson]] back to his time, but it is assumed that she's a redhead with curly red hair in a bun hairstyle and her attire was a dark, grimy cloak with red pointy shoes and her attire in Lewis' drawing was a dress, a bow in her hair and some flats.

==Role in the film==
She first appears in the beginning of the film in 1995 abandoning her [[Lewis Robinson|child]] at the [[Sixth Street Orphanage]]. She looks at Lewis and gives him one last hug before a loud scraping noise alerted her and she left him at the front door of the orphanage, walking away into the distance. Having disappeared, no one has seen her since and only Lewis has a very faint but important memory.

It is unknown on why she had given Lewis up for adoption, but [[Mildred (Meet the Robinsons)|Mildred]] tells Lewis that she thinks Lewis's biological mother maybe didn't know how to take care of him. From little that can be seen of Lewis's biological mother, she does appear rather young, so it's possible that at least part of the reason she gave her son up for adoption was that she didn't feel ready to be a parent and wanted to give Lewis a better life or was unable to provide for Lewis.

==Trivia==
*Her true name as well as her background information are unknown.
*It is unknown if she had a spouse or if she was widowed, separated, divorced or single.
*According to the DVD commentary of the film, her CG body model is the same as [[Franny Robinson]]'s, just with a cloak.
*When [[Lewis Robinson]] asked his future self (Cornelius), if he had ever met her, he answered nervously that Lewis would have to find out for himself, possibly indicating that he did find her at some point before the events of the movie.
*A deleted scene that shows Lewis using the Memory Scanner on himself successfully instead of Dr. Krunklehorn would have shown him getting a glimpse of his mother, possibly before she gave him up. She appears to be crying at a table before coming over to see him. He turned off the Scanner after a moment, deciding it was enough for him.
