{{Quote|Mistress mine, thy will is thine, tell me your wishes three|Cyrus to Alice}}
'''Cyrus''' is a character on [[ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''. He debuts in the first episode and is portrayed by Peter Gadiot.

==History==
Before meeting [[Alice#Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|Alice]], Cyrus spends a hundred years in his bottle, serving to grant the wishes of many people.

Forever housed in a bottle, Cyrus receives quite the shock when a lovely young woman, Alice, uncaps the top and enters. He inquires why she is in his bottle, to which Alice replies that if he reveals her location, she will become big and shatter his bottle. Cyrus smiles and says she should not do that as good bottles are hard to come by. As the two talk, Cyrus asks her why she is here, to which Alice states she needs proof to show her father that [[Wonderland#Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|Wonderland]] is real, and pulls the [[White Rabbit#Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|White Rabbit]] out of her bag. She stuffs the rabbit back in, and Cyrus tells her his only wish is for freedom. Then, he offers Alice three wishes.

Together, Cyrus and Alice travel and have many adventures together. As they go along, he asks Alice to finally make her wishes, as he is falling in love with her. Knowing that the longer he stays with her, the more it will hurt when she makes her wishes and he is separated from her forever. To his surprise, Alice returns the feelings, and vows to never make wishes, so that the two can be together always. The two bury his bottle, and continue on their adventures.

A while later, Cyrus proposes marriage to Alice on a cliff overlooking the Boiling Sea. Alice accepts even before Cyrus can finish his proposal, and the two share a romantic kiss. Then, Cyrus shows Alice the necklace he wears, and tells her it will always shine when their hearts are near. Interrupted by the [[Anastasia Tremaine#Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|Red Queen]] and her guards, and the two fight against them until only a few guards remain. When they threaten Alice, Cyrus breaks free of the guards and helps her. However, before they can reunite and escape, the Red Queen uses magic to push Cyrus off the cliff. To Alice, he appears to fall to his own death after disappearing past the sea's smoke, but in actuality, is saved by [[Jafar#Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|Jafar]]'s flying magic carpet.

Cyrus is taken captive as a prisoner in Jafar's lair. Upon sensing Alice find his necklace somewhere in Wonderland, he awakens to discover himself trapped in a cage.
