====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Zoe attends Coles Academic High School, in New Jersey. She used to be driven by her mother, alongside [[Nakia Bahadir|Nakia]], [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]], and [[Bruno Carrelli|Bruno]], but once she gained a mass social media following, her demeanor towards them and their relationship changed.

While walking down the stairs at school, Kamala bumps into Zoe while distracted, to Zoe's annoyance. Kamala apologizes to her, and Zoe quickly assures her its fine. When Kamala compliments the jacket she's wearing, Zoe returns the favor, by admiring her necklace. Kamala awkwardly goes on to explain its her name in Arabic, but Zoe has no interest in further continuing the conversation, and leaves.

During PT, Zoe smacks the ball in Kamala's face in a game of basketball. Zoe laughs, and Nakia rushes to her friend's aid, accusing Zoe of doing it on purpose, which she denies.

On the day of AvengerCon, Zoe attends the event, and dressed up as [[Captain Marvel]], for a cosplay competition. She and the other contestants take the stage, as they show off their costumes, when one of the cosplayers emits an energy construct from her hand. Zoe watches in shock, as she continue to emit more, and then joins the crowd in an applause, assuming she was part of an act. She approaches the girl to give her admiration, and asks if she's available for parties, before proceeding to request a photograph. At that moment, a wire holding a giant model of [[Mjolnir]] is let loose, and directly hits Zoe. She is caught on it, as it swings back and forth, before slipping off. As she falls to the ground, the competitor with powers, creates a construct of her elongated arm, which breaks Zoe's fall, and saving her from harm. Zoe looks for her in the midst of the chaos, but she escapes her sight, among the various attendees, running from harms way.

Following the ordeal, Zoe publishes a video, recounting what happened at AvengerCon, from her perspective, leading to a massive increase in online followers.

At school, a group full of students gather around her, as she recalls the story, for them to listen to. [[Paul (Ms. Marvel)|Paul]] asks who the heroine was, and Zoe dubs her Night Light. She proceeds to invite them out for a party on Friday, in celebration of the "fragility of life", as well as her social media increase, to half a million followers. [[Kamran]], a new senior at school, passes Zoe by, and she invites him, adding that she'll message him the details.

On the night of the party, various members of Coles Academy are present. Zoe watches as Kamran dives into the pool from above, and smiles. The incoming noise of the police sirens soon arrive, and the teenagers are alerted to the arrival of the police. Zoe fears her parents reaction, as all those in attendance, scatter.

Zoe is later brought in by the [[Damage Control|Department of Damage Control]] for questioning. She initially believes she was brought in, because of the party she held, and attempts to defend herself. [[Agent Cleary]], who is sent in for her interrogation recognizes her, based on her social media, and claims to be a massive fan. Zoe gets excited at the prospect of this, and he shares how his co-workers are fans too. She expresses her happiness, for Cleary's admiration of her videos, and he goes on to talk about how well she must've faired at AvengerCon with her fans. Cleary suddenly changes his demeanor and asks whether the enhanced individual tried to kill her, but Zoe denies this and states she saved her life. Cleary then proceeds to imply that Zoe planned the incident at AvengerCon for likes, with the enhanced individual. He questions if she was her sister, claiming they have similar appearances, but Zoe denies they share any likeness. [[Sadie Deever|Agent Deever]] enters, and questions what she does know about the powered individual. Zoe admits she didn't get a good look at her, and Deever proceeds to interrogate her, asking if she had any accent, and what race she was. Zoe looks down, and shakes her head as Deever asks if she was Latinx or Middle Eastern, but when she asks if the individual was South Asian, Zoe doesn't react. She listens in, as the agents announce a tri-state sweep, searching every temple, community center, and mosque in the area.
