==General Description==
===Physical Appearance===
Half rhinoceros and half monkey, Rhinokey is a Wuzzle who has a rhino-like snout with a horizontal-striped horn, pink fur, a long tail, and rhino-like legs. He is in a posture that is very much like that of a monkey's.
===Personality===
Rhinokey is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky prankster. He loves to play practical jokes. He can be obnoxious, but he loves his friends.

==Appearances==
===''[[DuckTales (2017 series)]]''===
Rhinokey makes a cameo in the episode "[[The Lost Cargo of Kit Cloudkicker!]]". This version is a non-sapient fusion of a rhino and a gorilla, implied to be the result of being fused by the Stone of What Was, and referred to as a "Rhinocera" by [[Della Duck]] and "Gorill-roceros" by [[Kit Cloudkicker]]. It chases the heroes before getting stuck in a wall.
