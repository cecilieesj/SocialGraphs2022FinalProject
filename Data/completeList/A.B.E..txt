'''A.B.E.''' (short for '''Automatic Branch Engineer''') is an animatronic train conductor with a Jimmy Stewart-like voice created by [[Gremlin Prescott]] who looks after the [[Cartoon Wasteland|Wasteland's]] [[Train Tunnels|Train Tunnel]] Dioramas in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.

He asks [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] to help fix the three dioramas and to repair the damage caused by the quake. The player receives a golden pin after repairing the dioramas, however, if the players damage any of the dioramas, A.B.E. will summon [[Beetleworx]] to attack them.

His exact origin is unknown, although it is believed that he is partially based on an animatronic [[Abraham Lincoln]] from various American Disney attractions, he also shares some similarities to other animatronic robot characters such as the [[Timekeeper]] and [[Tom Morrow]].
