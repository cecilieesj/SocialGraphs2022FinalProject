}}'''The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity''' is a creature who appears during the first and third parts of "[[Weirdmageddon]]" in ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

==Background==
===Physical appearance===
The monster consists of a gigantic man's head, with a round nose, a five o'-clock shadow, thick red eyebrows, and red hair on his temples. Attached to the top of his head is a muscular arm which he uses to drag himself around.

==Trivia==
*The character was originally voiced by comedian/actor [[Wikipedia:Louis C.K.|Louis C.K.]]; however, following the controversy with Louis C.K. in which multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, all the character's lines were redubbed by [[Alex Hirsch]], the show's creator and the voice of several characters.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/louis-ck-disney-gravity-falls-sexual-misconduct-allegations-a8124231.html</ref>
