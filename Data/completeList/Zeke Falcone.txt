'''Ezekiel "Zeke" Falcone''' was born in Japan, as revealed in the episode "Head of Skate". He was born on March 6, 1996, as revealed in "Not My Sister's Keeper". His best pal is Luther whom Zeke has known since their youth and both share a love for skateboarding, video games, and talking about girls. Zeke is the smarter of the two, but he is a C- student and only got an A+ once in the episode, "Board in Class". His biggest weakness, however, is his crush on Olivia Masterson, his next-door neighbor, but later on, in the series does not really care for girls much and thinks that the only "perfect girl", is his skateboard, as he says in episode "Double Crush." His last name is revealed to be Falcone in the episode "The Bro List" and is the oldest but is shorter than Luther being about 6'0". Zeke and Luther are considered the best skaters in town which has caused competition from others like their friendemy, Kojo to even the legendary Tony Hawk.
