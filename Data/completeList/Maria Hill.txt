===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
====''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]''====
Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrived at the main facility of the Project PEGASUS. Seeing the Tesseract's instability, Fury ordered her to protect two prototypes. Hill disagrees with this request and that for her the life of agents is more important. Suddenly the [[Tesseract]] creates a portal that transports Loki to Earth. After hypnotizing Selvig and Barton, Loki escapes with the Tesseract. Fury told Hill that Agent Barton betrayed them, which Hawkeye listened and immediately attacked her. She informed Fury informed that there were many casualties after the destruction of the Project PEGASUS after unsuccessfully chasing Loki and Barton. With this information, Fury told her that now was a war.

Now with the team of experts assembled at the Helicarrier, she was surprised that Stark knew thermo-nuclear physics, which he responded that he studied the all night Selvig's notes. When Hawkeye's team attacked the Helicarrier, she bravely defend Fury and the other agents from the mercenaries hired by Loki.

During the battle of New York, Hill informed Fury that the [[World Security Council]] had taken control of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] plane, for the purpose of bombing of New York City and stop the alien invasion. Hill saw her boss refused to follow this order from the council. Finished the war, she asked if the Avengers were to return, which Fury said yes because they would need later to defend them from a possible new threat.

====''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''====
Fury calls her to report that suspicious information about the Project Insight. She said she would be there in four hours, which he said she needed in three. Hill arrived in Washington only to learn that a mysterious mercenary had attacked Fury. She witnessed the operation on Fury and saw his boss died before her eyes. After the supposed death of Fury at the hands of the Winter Soldier, Maria carried away the Fury's body to prepare him for his funeral.

She later infiltrates in the strike team in order to free her colleagues and Sam Wilson, who was helping Rogers and Romanoff. Hill managed to free them by electrocuting a guard and then used special device to escape from custody. After freeing Rogers, Wilson and Romanoff, she takes them with Nick Fury, who had facked his death. Fury and Hill revealed to Roger that they already knew the HYDRA's plan to impose a new world order.

The next day, she, Falcon, and Captain America broke into the [[Triskelion]] and they took control of communications there that allowed Rogers to give his speech and reveal HYDRA to the world. When Rogers and Wilson replace the chips, Hill is allowed to reprogram the Helicarrier's systems to destroy each other. Hill asked Rogers out of there immediately, but he refused and ordered her to fire because for him it was more important the safety of the people than his life. After stopping the Project Insight, Hill went to a job interview at [[Stark Industries]] and thus doesn't go the prison.

Hill was responsible for interviewing and evaluating Agent Grant Ward after he recovered a Chitauri device. Having evaluated Ward, she assigns him to the newly formed Coulson's team. While Coulson and his team was in his first mission, Hill and Dr. Streiten discussed that Coulson must never know the truth about his survival.

One night, Hill spoke by phone with Pepper Potts as FBI agents were following him (she also believed that they were inexperienced). Suddenly, she was intercepted by Melinda May, who demanded information about Project TAHITI. The conversation ends when FBI agents appeared, which Hill was upset for having taken so long to find her. She later gave the location of Providence to [[Glenn Talbot]] in order to protect [[Phil Coulson]] and his team. That night, Hill asked Coulson leave SHIELD and work for [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as the world saw them as a terrorist group. He refused because Stark thought he was dead. Before ending the talk, he asked her to say hello to Stark, but changed his mind when he remembered that Stark still believed he was dead. Hill left the motel, but not before to tell May that Ward was a member of [[HYDRA]].

In 2015, Maria Hill contacted Phil Coulson after learning that he and his team had discovered the location of Loki's scepter. They discussed the recent events and mocked on inefficient methods of Robert Gonzales. Hill asked if the Theta Protocol was ready, Coulson said yes and it was time to call in the Avengers.

====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
Maria Hill received the Avengers after a successful battle against [[HYDRA]]. She explained to Captain Rogers what skills have the two people who attacked during the battle. As Rogers did not understand her explanation, Hill said that the boy was super fast and the girl, very weird. She attended at the party organized by the Avengers, in honor of the victory over HYDRA and for recovering Loki's scepter. Try to lift [[Mjolnir]] was the game that the Avengers made when the party ended, while all Avengers tried and failed, she did not even try. The group passed pleasantly until they were interrupted by the rogue robot, Ultron, who came to bring his message of peace. Eventually, Thor destroyed Ultron's first body but they knew he would return.

Nick Fury requested to Stark that Hill join her in planning support for the Avengers' battle against Ultron and his army. When a sentry broke into the Helicarrier, she and Fury combined efforts to destroy it and prevent an attack to the other agents. After Ultron's defeat, Hill is seen working at the [[New Avengers Facility]].

Shortly after the Battle of Wakanda, Hill and Fury were driving around Chicago and checking on Tony Stark's whereabouts. The two detected unidentified sensors around Wakanda, but before they could investigate, a car swerved in front of them. They discovered that the car's driver was gone and could only watch in horror as Thanos's finger snap resulted in massive amounts of citizens disintegrating. Soon, Hill found herself disintegrating, calling out to Fury for help.

====''[[What If...?]]''====
