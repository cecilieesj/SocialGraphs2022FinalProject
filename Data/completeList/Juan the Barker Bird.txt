'''Juan the Barker Bird''' is a character from ''[[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room|Tropical Serenade/Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]''.

==History==

===Background===
Juan was one of the enchanted macaws of the Tiki Room and a cousin of the performer bird [[José]]; both of them had Mexican accents. While José hosted and performed in the Tiki Room, Juan worked to drum up business for their show by perching outside the Tiki Room to invite in would-be guests.

===Development History===
Built as audiences in 1963 didn't understand what an audio-animatronic show would be. Inspired by carnival-barkers, the imagineers used Juan as a depiction of what to expect in the show as he promoted the attraction.

Juan was to be José's cousin due to them sharing a voice-actor in the form of [[Wally Boag]] and also having a copied audio-animatronic. Two variants of the bird existed; one a copy of José's animatronic with red plumage while the other more popular animatronic was blue. He would be dressed up to mirror a carnival-barker, being given a traditional barker's hat, cane, collar and bow-tie.

Ultimately Juan was removed due too much high traffic outside of the Enchanted Tiki Room as guests observed him, blocking the entrance/exit of [[Adventureland (Disneyland)|Adventureland]]. Additionally years later in [[2000]], wood rot would cause the canopy of the attraction where Juan was once perched to collapse.

==Appearances==

===[[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room]]===
Perched nearby the idol of the goddess [[Uti]] in her canoe atop a canopy of the Tiki Room. Juan enticed guests to enter the Tiki Room by telling them of what would occur within the performances.

===[[The Walt Disney Story|Walt Disney Story]]===
The original red version of Juan would be moved to a display case at the [[Walt Disney]] Story in [[Main Street, U.S.A.]]'s opera house.

===[[Walt Disney Family Museum]]===
A replica of Juan is on display at the Walt Disney Family Museum, being used to demonstrate how audio-animatronics work as guests can use a joystick to manipulate his actions.

==Trivia==
* [[The Tropical Hideaway]] in Disneyland features an allusion to Juan's history. At [[Rosita]]'s perch, she is seen in possession of a cane and hat identical to those once owned by Juan.
* Thanks to the success of Juan, [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] in [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Adventureland (Magic Kingdom)|Adventureland]] would feature its own [[Barker Bird]] until its removal in 2006.
* [[Clyde and Claude]] were sorts of successors to Juan in the [[Magic Kingdom]].
