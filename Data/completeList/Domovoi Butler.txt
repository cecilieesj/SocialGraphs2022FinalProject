}}'''Domovoi Butler''' is a character in the [[2020]] film ''[[Artemis Fowl]]''. As the sworn protector of [[Artemis Fowl II]], he has a younger nieceÂ named Juliet Butler and aids Artemis in his plan to rescue his father.

==Personality==
This gigantic man is akin to a one-person army. Although skilled with weapons, his mastery of martial arts often makes it unnecessary. He comes from a long line of Butler family members who have protected the Fowls over the years and his only goal is to keep young Artemis safe. He accepts being referred to as either "Domovoi," or "Dom," but absolutely will not allow anyone to call him "The Butler."
