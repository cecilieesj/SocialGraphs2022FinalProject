He was portrayed by [[Luke Benward]] and was the boyfriend of Teddy Duncan until they had to break up when Beau moved away.

==History==
He is an employee of Bob's Bugs Be Gone. He first appears in "Rat-A-Teddy:, where he becomes Bob's new employee. Beau also meets Teddy and they seems to be in love in first sight for both of them. 

In the end, Bob hires Beau, who starts to see something in his daughter, Teddy. In Charlie 4, Toby 1, Teddy helps Beau call his ex-girlfriend from his hometown who still has feelings for him. In Teddy's New Beau, Beau takes Teddy to a local country western hangout with another girl so that it's not considered a date, but the other girl doesn't show up. Instead, Beau and Teddy enjoy the night by themselves.

At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Beau had never really invited another girl to join them and that he only told Teddy this so that she would agree to go with him to the hangout (he knew about her being reluctant to date). He also tells Teddy that he wants to go out with her, and kisses her on the cheek.

In Teddy's Choice, Teddy invites Beau to her 18th birthday, but her ex-boyfriend Spencer shows up and she must choose between Spencer and Beau. In the end, she chooses Beau over Spencer even though Spencer wanted them back together. In The Bug Prom, Teddy goes to the Bug Prom with Beau and his aunt, Karen, who happens to be Amy's ex-boss.

In Bob's Beau-Be-Gone, Beau moves back to Tennessee for good, leaving Teddy sad and Bob devastated, but eventually they both get over it; Teddy helping Bob to video-chat.
