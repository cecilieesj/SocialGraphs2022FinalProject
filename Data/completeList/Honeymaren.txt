'''Honeymaren''' is a supporting character in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[2019]] animated feature film, ''[[Frozen II]]''. A member of the [[Northuldra]], Honeymaren wants nothing more than to bring peace to [[the Enchanted Forest]]. She is bold and brave, with a reverence for the magic of nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/09/23/frozen-2-new-characters-disney-trailer/|title=Frozen 2 Trailer Introduces New Characters|website=ComicBook.com|date=September 23, 2019|first=Charlie|last=Ridgely|format=Article}}</ref>

==Background==
Honeymaren and her brother, [[Ryder Nattura]], were born in [[the Enchanted Forest]] after the events of the Northuldran and Arendellian war. Due to the curse that prevented anyone from entering or leaving the forest, Honeymaren had never been outside of the forest. She would be raised as a reindeer shepherdess. With a staff on her person at most times, Honeymaren also served as a protector of her people, fending off threats like [[Lieutenant Mattias]] and [[Royal Guards (Frozen)|his guards]].

==Role in the film==
Honeymaren leads the ambush against [[Elsa]] and her party when they enter [[the Enchanted Forest]]. She commands [[Anna]] to lower her weapon, prompting [[Lieutenant Mattias]] and [[Royal Guards (Frozen)|his men]] to order the [[Northuldra]]ns to lower theirs. When Honeymaren and her people try to forcibly remove Anna’s weapon, Elsa stops them with her ice magic. Honeymaren, like the rest, is shocked by this reveal. She is doubly confused when [[Olaf]] reveals himself. 

When the [[Bruni|Fire Spirit]] appears and sets the forest ablaze, Honeymaren and her people are evacuated. However, Elsa is able to tame the spirit with her ice magic, much to the shock of the tribe, including Honeymaren. Immediately afterwards, Elsa pulls out a [[Iduna's Scarf|scarf]] and drapes it around Anna's shoulders. Taking notice, Ryder mentions that it is a Northuldra scarf, with Honeymaren pointing out that it belongs to one of their oldest families. This leads to the revelation that Elsa and Anna's mother, [[Queen Iduna]], was Northuldra. Honeymaren joins her people in welcoming Elsa and Anna into their tribe by singing "[[Vuelie]]". Elsa promises to lift the forest's curse and prepares to head north, but Honeymaren warns that the [[Earth Giants]] roam the north at night. [[Yelana]] invites Elsa and her party to stay with the Northuldra tribe until morning. At this time, Honeymaren introduces herself to Anna, who promises to do all they can to help.

That night, Honeymaren takes a closer look at Iduna's scarf. She points out the symbols on the scarf that represent the elemental spirits. However, she also reveals a centerpiece represents a fifth spirit, which is said to be a bridge between humans and the magic of nature. Elsa wonders if that fifth spirit is the voice that's been calling out to her. Honeymaren believes it may be, but notes that only [[Ahtohallan]] knows. She and Elsa briefly sing the "[[All Is Found]]" lullaby, with Honeymaren asking why lullabies always have to contain some terrible warning. Just then, the Northuldran camp is visited by the Earth Giants. Honeymaren hides, advising Elsa to do the same. The next day, she and the rest of the tribe head west.

Later, Elsa and Anna successfully lift the curse upon the forest, evaporating the mist and pacifying the spirits. Honeymaren and Ryder meet at the Enchanted Forest's entrance and are equally mesmerized by the sight of the clear skies. Honeymaren playfully nudges her brother, who expresses his wonder. After Elsa relays her experiences at Ahtohallan to Honeymaren and Yelana, Honeymaren notes that Elsa belongs in the forest, which the Snow Queen agrees. She abdicates the throne of Arendelle to Anna, and remains in the forest among Honeymaren and the rest of the Northuldran. Honeymaren is last seen months later, riding alongside Ryder on the backs of reindeer taking their herd out for a run as Elsa passes them by on her way to Ahtohallan on [[the Nokk]], being helped up to the top of the nearby cliff by the lead Earth Giant.

==Trivia==

*Though she does not have a song of her own, Honeymaren sings twice in the film: first as a member of the chorus in “[[Vuelie]]“, and again with Elsa in a brief reprise of “[[All Is Found]]”.
*According to tie-in books, Ryder's last name is Nattura. However, it is unconfirmed whether or not Honeymaren shares the same last name.
