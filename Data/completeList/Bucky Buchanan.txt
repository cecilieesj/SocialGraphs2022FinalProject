'''Bucky Buchanan''' is the main antagonist and later supporting character in the [[Disney Channel]] movies ''[[Zombies (film)|Zombies]]'', ''[[Zombies 2]]'', and ''[[Zombies 3]]''. He is the conceited cousin to [[Addison Wells]] and rival to [[Zed Necrodopolis]].

==Background==
===Personality===
Bucky is arrogant, competitive, and extremely conceited. He prides himself on his cheering abilities and does not care what he has to do in order to achieve his goal. He can be crafty and shows initiative when it comes to pulling off schemes. However, he has a habit of not thinking things through and is very short-sighted, as he didn't think about how to prevent the zombies from attacking him and his allies when they hacked Zed and his friends Z-Bands to make them go crazy. Following the first film, he accepts some form of humility and while he still lacks a progressive mindset, he is not as villainous as he once was. Bucky occasionally shows bouts of being weak willed, at least when it comes to physical confrontations and reluctantly accepts the changes happening in Seabrook. In the third film, it is implied that his mindset is based on his own personal fears of being ostracized for being different. When the Aceys tell him that they would accept him regardless of whether he was different, he apparently embraces the changing town while still retaining his competitive nature.

===Physical appearance===
Bucky is a tall Caucasian student with black hair who is usually adorned in a green jacket with pink accents that match his school's colors.
