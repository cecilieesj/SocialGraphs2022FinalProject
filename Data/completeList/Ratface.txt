}}'''Ratface''' is a villain in the ''Donald Duck'' and ''Uncle Scrooge'' comics. He is the pet raven and faithful servant of [[Magica De Spell]], able to communicate with his mistress and to assist her in her hunt for [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s [[Number One Dime|Old Number One]].
==History==
Ratface made his debut in ''The Unsafe Safe'' (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #38, [[1962]]), written and drawn by [[Carl Barks]]. In early appearances, the raven is still unnamed and assists MagicaÂ alongside other animals, such as cats and spiders. However, Ratface soon became Magica's only assistant, and still frequently appears in comics.

==Appearance==
Ratface is a non-anthropomorphized black raven, who, quite notably, has the ability to speak with his mistress. In some stories, rather than speaking, his thoughts can be read, allowing him to give his opinion on Magica's evil plans or to go in conversation with Magica herself.

== Trivia ==
* In Italy, Ratface is called Gennarino, in honor of St. Januarius, protector of Naples, where Magica lives.
* When they were depicted together, the main difference between Ratface and Poe was their beak colour: orange for Poe, black for Ratface. Modern comics, where Poe does not appear, gave Ratface an orange beak
