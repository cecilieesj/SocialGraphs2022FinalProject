'''Foo-Foo''' is [[Miss Piggy]]'s dog, who appeared in the fourth and fifth seasons of ''The Muppet Show''. She speaks only in barks and other typical dog sound effects.

==Background==
Puppeteer Steve Whitmire recalled how he got the role:
{{quote|I think [getting the part] was largely because [[Dave Goelz|Dave]] was going to do it but he didn't really want to do it. Foo-Foo was kind of a prop for Miss Piggy in a lot of ways. It was just something for her to play off of.<ref>Plume, Kenneth. "[http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/interviews/Whitmire2.shtml Ratting Out: An Interview with Steve Whitmire]", Muppet Central. July 19, 1999.</ref>|Steve Whitmire}}

In 2011, during the promotion for [[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]], Miss Piggy told ''People Magazine'' that she has had to "re-home" Foo-Foo. As Piggy explained, "[Foo-Foo] really didn't much care for [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], it seems... She seems to be prejudiced against green people. Anything the color green, she would nip at. So in order to have a future with my Kermie, I had to make that sacrifice." Piggy assured ''People'' that she is sending Foo-Foo to pet therapy, and she'll be happy to welcome her dog back home when she gets over her aversion to Kermit.<ref>Jones, Oliver and Liz Raftery. "[http://www.peoplepets.com/people/pets/article/0,,20544797,00.html Muppet Mess: Miss Piggy Forced to Choose Between Her Dog and Her Frog]", People.com. Nov 11, 2011.</ref> She did return, however, in ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', hopefully indicating that the therapy was successful.

The Foo-Foo puppet made a few appearances on ''The Jim Henson Hour'' in the recurring "Fashion Dolls" sketch, where the dog was called Freddie. She also made a cameo in ''Kermit's Swamp Years''.

According to ''[[The Muppets Character Encyclopedia]]'', Foo-Foo has siblings named Oui-Oui, Poo-Poo, Num-Num, Goo-Goo, and Fred.

==Performance==
On ''The Muppet Show'', Foo-Foo was portrayed both by a puppet and a live dog. A 1979 issue of The Muppet Show Fan Club newsletter (vol. 2, no. 2) provided a behind-the-scenes scoop:

{{quote|Can you tell which is the live dog and which is the puppet? Miss Piggy's new dog, Foo-Foo, is not really one puppy, but two. The one on the left is a puppet, modeled on the live dog on the right. It took a long time to find a puppy small enough to be in scale with Miss Piggy. The live Foo-Foo was born on December 13, 1978. She is a special sort of toy poodle and is one of the last ten of her particular line, a line bred down to the smallest possible size from a standard poodle. Foo-Foo is still growing, and as she grows, the puppet Foo-Foo will be rebuilt to match. When fully grown, she will still be less than nine inches tall. Watch carefully when Foo-Foo is next on the show -- if she's running around, it will ''probably'' be the live version. If she's reacting in close-up, it will ''probably'' be the puppet... but you can't be sure...!|The Muppet Show Fan Club}}
