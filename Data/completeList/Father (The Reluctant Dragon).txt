'''The Father''' is a minor character in the [[1941]] Disney animated short, ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (short)|The Reluctant Dragon]]''. He is the father of [[Boy (The Reluctant Dragon)|the boy]].

==Role in the short==
The Father is first seen running away scared with his flock of sheep. When passing by his [[Boy (The Reluctant Dragon)|son]], who is sitting next to a tree while reading a book about knights and dragons, he stops. When his son asks what's the matter, the father tells him that he and his sheep saw a monster, which caused him and his sheep to run away scared in the first place, and through the description of the beast, his son deduces that he only saw [[The Reluctant Dragon (character)|a dragon]]. Shocked and terrified by the news, the father runs to town to warn the people about the dragon. He isn't seen throughout the rest of the short after this.
