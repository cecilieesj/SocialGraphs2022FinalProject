[[File:Thinner_Mickey.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''Thinner Mickey''' is a deleted concept from the video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. This was supposed to be a form of [[Mickey Mouse]] that he would turn into if he used too much [[Thinner]] or made bad choices such as destroying enemies with Thinner, thinning the environment and townsfolk or defeating bosses with Thinner. If the player did bad things, Mickey's [[Paint]] would melt off of his body, leaving only his outline and getting claws and sharp teeth.

This idea was later shelved and changed to the "Scrapper Mickey", before the idea was eventually removed entirely, likely due to being too dark and scary.
