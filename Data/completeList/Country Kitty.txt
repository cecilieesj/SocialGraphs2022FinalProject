[[File:Country_Kitty.png|thumb]]'''Country Kitty''' is was a member of the all-girl group known as the [[Stray Kitties]]. She is played by Skyler Vallo.

==Background Information==
She appeared in "[[Solos & Stray Kitties]]". Country Kitty's shtick is primary dressing in a cowgirl uniform with cat-ears, and line-dancing, in spite of the fact that the music she dances to is strictly standard contemporary girl-group pop rather than country and western music. She also tends to profile herself on wearing an excessive amount of makeup, and feels threatened when she sees [[Ally Dawson]] more heavily made up with her while dressed as "Wicked Kitty."
