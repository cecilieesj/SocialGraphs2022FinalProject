'''Victor Thelonious Baxter'''<ref>His middle name is said in Raven's Home episode "The Big Sammich"</ref> is the goofy, yet still lovable father of the titular character [[Raven Baxter|Raven]] in ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and ''[[Cory in the House]]'', played by American actor Rondell Sheridan from 2003 to 2008. He starts out as a chef in a restaurant, but he later opens his own restaurant, The Chill Grill. His biggest rival is Leonard Stevenson. In ''Cory in the House'', he gets a job as the President's chef, and it is unknown what became of his restaurant. His catchphrases are "Here comes the pain!" and "I'll go pack!" (''Cory in the House'').

He makes a guest appearance in the ''[[Raven's Home]] ''episode "Just Call Me Vic". He is also referenced by Raven, when she talks of how she drove her parents crazy. He is mentioned once again in "[[Vest in Show]]", where Chelsea reminisces with Raven, about working with Victor in the [[Chill Grill]]. He returned in Season Five of the show as a main character, in which Raven and Booker will care for him as he has a “mild heart attack”.<ref>https://deadline.com/2021/10/ravens-home-renewed-season-5-disney-channel-rondell-sheridan-reprise-original-role-casting-changes-1234847720/</ref>
