'''Munki-Gu''' is an antagonist and one of the neutral characters in the [[Disney Junior]] television series ''[[PJ Masks]]''. As a mischievous monkey, he has been trapped in a stone for a thousand years and first appeared in the Season 4 episode "[[PJ Party Mountain]]." 

==History==
A thousand years ago, Munki-Gu was turned into a stone statue for being too naughty. The statue was kept among other relics on Mystery Mountain. His flying boots were taken from him and locked in a small cage.

In "PJ Party Mountain," Night Ninja got his hands on the statue and used it to impersonate An Yu. Due to his tampering with the statue, Munki-Gu regained some form of consciousness, and became able to move around on his own despite being a statue. An Yu called the PJ Masks to Mystery Mountain to help her capture the statue. Instead, Gekko ended up accidentally freeing Munki-Gu completely by patting the statue on the head three times.

Gekko tried to teach Munki-Gu to behave, but to no avail. When Munki-Gu's actions angered the mountain, he agreed to help Gekko calm the mountain down again by dancing, but tricked Gekko into giving him back his flying boots (which he claimed were dancing shoes). After the mountain was calmed down, Munki-Gu used his flying boots to escape from the mountain and into the city.   

==Official Website description==

Accidentally freed by the PJ Masks, this prankster monkey brings unwanted – but at times, useful – comedy and chaos to their world. Munki-Gu uses his powers to outwit and trick whoever he meets – so watch out! 

==Personality==
At first, Munki-Gu appears to be an innocent monkey. However, he then reveals himself to be mischievous and naughty once Gekko accidentally patted his head 3 times. Munki-Gu is also shown to be a very disobedient monkey as he refuses to listen to others, especially the PJ Masks. As naughty as he is, he's also shown to be a very funny and silly monkey as he likes playing and pulling pranks on others.
