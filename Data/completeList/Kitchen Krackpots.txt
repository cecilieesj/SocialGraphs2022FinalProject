|appearance = Various anthropomorphic Kraft-brand condiment packages}}The '''Kitchen Krackpots''' was a jazz band comprised of anthropomorphic oversized Kraft-brand condiment packages. They served as the house band in the former [[Kitchen Kabaret]] show at [[Epcot]]. These animatronics were the first food products to come. 

The 5 members of this band included:
*A Mayonnaise jar, leading the group on beet and tuna can drums
*A Barbecue Sauce bottle, playing an egg-beater like a bass
*A Parmesan Cheese container, playing a banjo made out of a measuring cup
*A Mustard bottle, playing a saxophone made with a drinking straw
*A Salsa jar, playing a matchstick piano

==Role in the Show==
===Act 1===
The Band first played a ragtime intro, before [[Bonnie Appetite]] appeared to sing. The Kitchen Krackpots came out of the floor and reappeared in the ending of the show.

===Finale===
The Kitchen Krackpots, along with the rest of the cast, sang a medley of each of their songs. All of the cast came back out and Bonnie said good bye before the curtains with the Kraft logo covered the stage.

==Trivia==
*The only member of the band that actually spoke in the show was the group's leader, the Mayonnaise jar. He said two lines during the show: "Okay, Krackpots. Let's get cooking!" and "All right, gang, take it on home!". However, since none of their mouths moved, it's not entirely certain which member actually said those lines.
*In [[1993]], when Nestle replaced Kraft as the sponsor of [[The Land]] pavilion (where Kitchen Kabaret was located), some of the Krackpots were redesigned, presumably to reflect Nestle-brand packaging. The Mayonnaise jar was changed into a Spaghetti Sauce jar, the Barbecue Sauce bottle became a Salad Dressing bottle, and the Parmesan Cheese container became a Pepper container.
