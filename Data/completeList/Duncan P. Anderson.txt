'''Duncan Pepperidge Anderson''' is the assistant supervisor of MIFT in the [[Disney Television Animation|Disney]]â€¢[[Pixar]] animated series, ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.

== Background ==
=== Personality ===
Duncan is an ambitious monster who desires to be the head of MIFT. Much like [[Randall Boggs]], he is not above using underhanded or conniving tactics to achieve his goal. Unlike Randall, Duncan has redeeming traits and morals and actually gets along with his co-workers most of the time.

=== Physical appearance ===
Duncan is an olive green monster with four orange eyes on stalks. Strangely, Duncan's eyestalks are all different sizes in height. Duncan has multiple characteristics of a dragon such as webbed wings, long, skinny fingers which resemble claws, and dragon-like feet, but has a different body shape than a dragon.  

He used to have a pencil mustache, as seen in "[[The Vending Machine]]". He likely shaved it sometime after his employment photo.
