}}'''Erik "Odin" Hellstrom''' is the main antagonist in the third and final adventure in ''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]''.

==Background==
===Physical Appearance===
He is a tall and slender white-haired man, with a white beard, mustache, thick bushy eyebrows. He wears a Viking helmet, an eyepatch and neutral-colored armor.

==Appearances==
===''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]] ''===
He was once a fierce competitor to [[Preston B. Whitmore]], having built a large shipping empire with cruise liners. At some point, he bought the largest castle in Iceland and named it "Asgard", leading the press to dub him "the Modern Odin". He lived like a god until his company was shut down when the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929 stock market crashed]. He lost his money, power, and, to Whitmore's assessment, his mind. 

Many years later, Hellstrom had indeed become completely insane, believing himself to be the Norse god king, Odin. After unsuccessfully trying to buy from Whitmore an ancient spear called the [[Gungnir]], revealed to be an artifact of Atlantean origin, Hellstrom stole it. When [[Milo Thatch|Milo]], [[Kida Nedakh|Kida]], [[Audrey_Ramirez|Audrey Ramirez]], [[Vincenzo Santorini]], [[Gaetan Moliére]], and [[Obby]] track Hellstrom down in the frigid Nordic Mountains, he presumes Milo to be the trickster, Loki, and Kida to be his long lost daughter, Brunhilda, and kidnaps her. His intentions are to end the world in Ragnarok (and most likely, rebuild it to his liking). 

Using the spear, he awakens two ancient demons, [[Surtr|Surtr the Chaos Lord of Fire]] and Ymir, the Chaos Lord of Ice. Well-placed explosives used by Vinny make the two demons turn on each other, causing them to lose the spear. Kida retrieves it and uses its power to drop Asgard on the two Chaos Lords, eliminating them and stopping Ragnarok. After the castle is destroyed, Hellstrom mourns over his defeat and is presumably sent to a mental hospital.

==Trivia==
*Hellstrom's appearance is greatly based on Odin, the god of wisdom in the Norse mythology.
*Before he went insane and took on the form of Odin, his appearance is based on famous actor Vincent Price.
**Interestingly, the late [[William Morgan Sheppard]], Hellstrom's voice actor, had also voiced [[Odin (Gargoyles)|the real Odin]] in ''[[Gargoyles]]''. Indeed, it is unknown what would have been made of Hellstrom's storyline if the cancelled ''[[Team Atlantis]]'' TV show had indeed crossed over with ''Gargoyles'' as was planned.
*Hellstrom's crows represent Huginn and Muninn, Odin's ravens who flew around the world of mortals, Midgard, and brought information back to him. The wolf may represent Fenrir, the monstrous wolf from Norse mythology.
*Contrary what was described in ''Milo's Return'', Brunhilda is not actually Odin's daughter.
