'''Wanda Maximoff''' (also known as '''Scarlet Witch''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who has appeared in many Marvel-related productions.

In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], she debuts in the films as a cameo in the mid-credits scene of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and becomes a more prominent character after returning in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''. In addition to the films, she and [[Vision]] are also the titular protagonists of the [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]''. 

Wanda is the twin sister of Pietro Maximoff, alias [[Quicksilver]]. She started out as a vengeful lackey to the evil [[Ultron]], before redeeming herself and joining the [[Avengers]] following the death of her brother, who would have done likewise if he had lived.

Scarlet Witch was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Background==
Wanda was born in the country of Sokovia alongside her older twin brother Pietro. They became orphans when a mortar shell hit their house while they were having dinner. Years later, Sokovia became a war zone. She and her brother participated in different riots in an attempt to drive the foreign forces out of their country. However, all these riots were planned by [[HYDRA]], who had taken up residence in Sokovia and used the riots as cover for their illegal experiments.

One day, List, a HYDRA scientist approached them to offer the opportunity to get enough power to drive war out of Sokovia. Wanda was skeptical but was finally convinced by Pietro. As a result of these experiments, she won numerous mental powers such as telekinesis, hypnosis, and energy projection; while Pietro achieved superhuman speed.

===Personality===
Wanda is a serious and introverted individual with emotional fragility due to her upbringing. At her core, however, Wanda has a caring personality devoted to protecting innocents, and a willingness to fight for what she feels is right. While she is very passionate about her beliefs and quite direct about how she feels, this has proven to be a deadly flaw, as it makes her prone to impulsiveness and error. Included was siding with Ultron, an impact that deeply influences much of her actions thereafter.

Although capable of acknowledging her mistakes and learning from them as well, Wanda feels the burden of guilt and remorse for her actions, which has led to times of inaction. Before turning to the Avengers, Wanda was vengeful toward her enemies, as she was willing to psychologically torture the Avengers and wanted to personally hunt down towards Ultron for Pietro's death. Wanda's hostility has toned down since, but she is still prone to fits of powerful anger.

===Powers and Abilities===
====Powers====
*'''[[Magic|Chaos Magic]]:''' Wanda has the ability to cast magical spells by harnessing magical energies from other dimensions<ref name = "Wanda's Chaos Magic"/>, despite she has never had any training in how to use her powers.

After a year and a half of study, Wanda has fully mastered her powers, becoming the most powerful witch alive and one of the most powerful beings in the universe.

**'''Telekinesis:''' Wanda has the power to move, levitate, and even immobilize objects and people without touching them.
**'''Energy Blasts:''' Wanda has the power to generate unique reddish energy from her hands and can harness it to create energy blasts.

==Appearances==
===Marvel Animated Universe===
====''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''====
Scarlet Witch can be seen on Fury's wall of Skrull suspects in the episode "Infiltration".

====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====
''The Super Hero Squad Show'' version of Scarlet Witch makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Flight of the Iron Spider".

===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''====
Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver appear in a mid-credits scene, where she and her twin brother were confirmed to have not been present at SHIELD's headquarters at the time HYDRA was defeated there and Operation Insight was shut down due to [[Baron Strucker]]'s actions. Strucker also revealed he intended to use them for an unspecified purpose.

====''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''====
When the Avengers attacked the HYDRA Research Base, List asked Strucker to send the Maximoff twins to fight against the Avengers, Strucker replied that not yet because they had not reached its full potential. However, she and her brothers managed to escape and went to the battlefield to confront the Earth's mightiest heroes. When Tony Stark found out about Strucker's secret lab, Scarlet Witch used her powers against Stark, causing him a vision that would change his way of seeing the world. However, Stark took Loki's Scepter; her brother, Pietro asked why she let him take the scepter, in which she simply smiled in response.

The next day, Scarlet Witch and [[Quicksilver]] were summoned by [[Ultron]], who wanted them to be part of his team. During the meeting, she prevented Pietro from telling him the story of how their parents died. Ultron requested them to please tell him. Quicksilver told Ultron how they spent several days waiting to die for Stark's fault. Ultron promised them that they would tear the Avengers from inside. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver accompanied Ultron to Salvage Yard to buy [[Vibranium]] from Ulysses Klaue for his new body. When Klaue saw Wanda and her brother, he recognized them as Strucker's experiments. He warned them that if they used their powers against him, he would know that they were not in charge and told them that the man in charge should appear. The man in charge turned out to be Ultron.

Suddenly, the Avengers arrived, which led to a fight between the Avengers, Ultron, the Maximoff twins, and Klaue's men. While Ultron and [[Iron Man]] were fighting, Scarlet Witch managed to defeat almost all the Avengers by hallucinations. After attacking the beautiful [[Black Widow]], she was attacked by [[Hawkeye]], who told her that he was not a fan of mind control. Using his speed, Quicksilver took Scarlet Witch away from the danger. While recovering, Scarlet Witch saw [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] alone, she then decided to use her powers against him in order to take revenge on the Avengers.

She, Quicksilver, and Ultron arrived in Seoul, South Korea, and attacked Helen Cho's laboratories. Ultron asked Doctor Cho if she could create a new body for him, but when she refused this request, he used Loki's scepter on her. As the synthetic body was ready, Ultron proceeded to upload himself into his new body. This allowed Scarlet Witch to read Ultron's mind and found out that he sought to eliminate the human race. She asked Ultron his reasons, he replied in order that humanity could improve. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver realized that Ultron lied to them and abandoned Ultron, but not before she released Helen Cho from Ultron's mind control. Ultron then attacked them, only to apologize afterward. Later, she and her brother helped [[Captain America]], who was fighting against Ultron. During the battle, a train went off the rails, and she managed to stop it using her powers. She and her brother accompanied Captain America to Avengers Tower to stop Tony Stark, who sought to use the synthetic body to fix everything that he caused. However, they could not prevent the birth of the [[Vision]].

Scarlet Witch, along with Quicksilver, Vision, and the Avengers, traveled to Sokovia to stop Ultron and thwart his plans of global extinction. Before the battle, she used her powers on civilians to evacuate and go to a safe place. When the battle began, she was very scared. But when [[Hawkeye]] encouraged her, she left her hiding to fight and prove that she was an Avenger. She later offered to guard the key against Ultron, despite the doubts of her brother. When her brother was killed, she quickly felt the loss of her brother at the hands of Ultron, causing a great explosion of energy. As Ultron was badly wounded, she approached him and ripped off his metal heart to show him how she felt when Pietro died.

However, an Ultron drone managed to activate the doomsday machine, sending Sokovia directly to crash into Earth. When it seemed that everything was lost to her, the Vision arrived and saved her from imminent death. After Ultron's defeat, she was recruited along with [[War Machine]], the [[Sam Wilson|Falcon]], and the [[Vision]] as new members of the Avengers.

====''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''====
{{Quote|I used to think of myself one way. But after this... I am something else. And still me, I think. But that's not what everyone else sees.|Wanda to Vision about her magic powers|Captain America: Civil War}}

Scarlet Witch, now a new member of the Avengers, is working undercover as one of Captain America's spies; looking for Rumlow, who now goes by the alias; [[Crossbones]] since his last encounter with Captain America and who plans to steal a biological weapon from a laboratory in Lagos. She helps Captain America enter the building where the lab is located by removing all the poisonous gas Crossbones threw in to kill some people, infiltrate the lab, and steal the weapon; using her powers. After Captain America manages to capture Crossbones after a long chase, whom he unmasks to notice his burnt and scarred face since their last encounter, while his other team members: Black Widow and Falcon subdue his men, Crossbones tries to commit suicide by blowing himself up along with Captain America but when Scarlet Witch tries to displace the blast into the sky, it destroys a nearby building, killing a number of Wakandan humanitarian workers.

Back at the team's headquarters, in her room, Scarlet Witch feels guilt, regret, fear, and remorse as she watches the latest news that happened back in Lagos; blaming herself for those people's deaths. Just then, Captain America and Vision come into her room to comfort her. But that isn't enough to cheer her up as U.S. Secretary of State Ross arrives and informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations (Marvel)|United Nations]] is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish an international governing body to oversee and control the Avengers. Thus, the team is divided. Scarlet Witch decides to stay on Captain America's side along with Falcon since Captain America has more faith in his own judgment than the government's while the rest of the team stay on Iron Man's side, who agree to sign the Accords since Iron Man feels responsible for Ultron's creation and Sokovia's destruction.

She is then placed under house arrest at the Avengers' headquarters with the Vision overlooking her (and cooking for her), who has sided with Iron Man because he wants the world to see Wanda as the kind-hearted woman he sees her as. Eventually, Hawkeye arrives under Captain America's orders to break her out. When he's overpowered by Vision, Hawkeye reminds Wanda that she has the ability to beat him, and she uses her powers to send Vision through multiple stories of the building all the way down. During the Avengers battle, her powers, along with Black Widow's double-agent act, prove essential in helping Winter Soldier and Captain America escape to find Helmut Zemo, who destroyed a nearby building in Vienna, where a conference was being held, that killed more people including T'Chaka, king of Wakanda and framed the Winter Soldier as the culprit for it. She is then arrested alongside her other teammates and placed in holding cells in the Raft until they are freed by Captain America at the very end.

She is last seen reunited with [[Vision]], who has adopted a human disguise, living peacefully in Europe.

====''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''====
A year of peace is interrupted by the arrival of [[Proxima Midnight]] and [[Corvus Glaive]], who want the [[Infinity Stones|Mind Stone]] from Vision. Wanda rushes to his defense; the battle is ultimately a stalemate.

Wanda, seeing that their forces are struggling against the Outrider onslaught, leaps into battle and saves Black Widow and Okoye from a tank, which she throws at several Outriders. She is then caught off balance when Proxima Midnight threatens her, only for her to throw her in the path of another tank when Black Widow and Okoye appear. She returns to Vision's side until Thanos arrives, telling her she cannot destroy the stone until he himself dies. Vision urges her that this is the right course of action. Relenting, at last, she unleashes a stream of energy into the stone while Thanos fights the Avengers and wins. She blows up the stone, killing Vision, much to her horror, and throwing her to the ground. Thanos tries sympathizing with her, but she bitterly calls him ignorant. She is forced to watch as Thanos tries and succeeds in extracting the Mind Stone from Vision's corpse. This completes Thanos' collection of Infinity Stones.

Wanda is killed when Thanos unleashes his power, exterminating half of the universal population and numbering her among the fatalities.

====''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''====
{{Quote|You took everything from me.|Wanda to [[Thanos]]|Avengers: Endgame}}

Wanda is resurrected when Hulk/Bruce Banner uses the Infinity Gauntlet to undo the snap and bring everyone back to life. She joins the battle against Thanos and his army of Chitauri, Outriders, and the Black Order. During the battle, she confronts Thanos and nearly overtakes him, forcing him to call in back-up. In the aftermath of the battle, Wanda attends Tony Stark's funeral after he sacrificed his life by snapping his fingers by destroying Thanos' forces. At the funeral, she tells Clint that Natasha and Vision would both be proud of them.

====''[[WandaVision]]''====
{{Quote|You are my sadness and my hope. But mostly, you're my love.|Wanda to [[Vision]]|The Series Finale}}
Wanda, still grieving over [[Vision]], uses the piece of the [[Infinity Stones|Mind Stone]] that lives inside her to recreate him and also creates a world where the two live as a married couple with two twin boys in a suburban sitcom like world. This world was created by trapping all the inhabitants of a town called [[Westview]] (located in New Jersey) inside a magic energy field (called "Hex") that surrounds the area, keeping the illusion of the sitcom and forcing the people inside to live the fantasy with Wanda, and if anyone mentions [[Quicksilver|her brother]], [[Ultron]], or anything in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's reality, she ejects them.

Throughout the series, Wanda tries to teach her children about powers and real life issues like death when their dog Sparky dies. Wanda is visited by a guy who claims to be her brother Pietro. Wanda sometimes has visions of her loved ones as corpses, such as Pietro and Vision, and is determined to keep her children safe from any kind of danger. When Wanda finds out Vision is dying because he left Westview, she expands the Hex, which brings more people from outside, such as [[Darcy Lewis]], to the town and turns them into characters based on her reality. In the [[Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision)|seventh episode]], Wanda finds out her neighbor Agnes is really a witch named [[Agatha Harkness]] who has been behind everything that has been happening ([[Agatha All Along]]) such as bringing a fake version of Pietro to the town. Following the reveal of Agatha Harkness, Wanda must try and protect her loved ones from Agatha's plans and cause of danger.

In [[The Series Finale|the final episode]], Wanda finds out there is another Vision, a white colored one, that Hayward rebuilt from his previous body parts from the ''Infinity War''. This Vision was programmed by Hayward to kill Wanda and the other Vision who is inside the Hex. Wanda confronts Agatha and tries to deny that no one taught her magic, but Agatha reveals Wanda is actually a Scarlet Witch, a powerful sorceress. Wanda saves her children and Vision, and then fights and beats Agatha, which soon reveals Wanda's true powers. During the battle, Wanda is confronted by the residents of Westview, who are suffering under her control because they are able to feel the pain of her grief. Realizing how her reality is harming those people, Wanda decides to set everything right and remove the Hex that surrounds the town, despite knowing that her family will be gone once her magic is removed from Westview. Wanda then goes home, and says goodbye to her sons as she puts them to sleep. She and Vision have a final moment, and Wanda explains to him that he is a piece of the Mind Stone that lives within her and also her love. Vision and Wanda say that they will see each other again, before he disappears along with the Hex. Wanda then talks to Monica and apologizes for all the pain she caused, before flying off and escaping into the wilderness. She is last seen reading the Darkhold and trying to find her children, who are heard screaming her name.

====''[[What If...?]]''====
The zombified Wanda appears in "[[What If... Zombies!?]]" as her infection with the Quantum Virus drove Vision's grief.

====''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''====
[[File:Scarlet Witch (DSITMOM).png|thumb|250px|The villainous Scarlet Witch.]]
Influenced by the ''Darkhold'', Wanda goes full length to see her sons (Billy and Tommy) again, by trying to steal [[America Chavez]]'s power of traveling the Multiverse. Wanda travels through various universes to find her children. Wanda ends up on Earth-838, where she kills the Illuminati team. Wanda embraces her villainess as she confronts another version of herself, who is a single mother to Billy and Tommy. Wanda scares the alternate versions of her sons, which she regrets as she is comforted by her alternate self. Wanda ends up sacrificing herself after battling America, as Wanda destroys the ''Darkhold'', leaving it unknown if she has died or is still alive.

====''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]''====
Whilst Scarlet Witch doesn't appear in the series, an animated version of her can be seen, amongst the other heroes, in the [[Generation Why|first episode]], as [[Ms. Marvel|Kamala]] narrates the final chapter, in her 10-part series, about the battle against [[Thanos]].

==Trivia==
*In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', [[Elizabeth Olsen]] and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] played twins, but in the [[2014]] film, ''Godzilla'', they played wife and husband.
*When Wanda hypnotized Tony Stark in the beginning of ''Age of Ultron'', she gave him the final push to motivate him to create [[Ultron]], as he was suffering with his fear of aliens attacking the Earth and the Avengers not being enough since the Battle of New York in ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'' film.
*There are notable differences between the portrayal of Scarlet Witch in the films and in the comics:
**In the comics, Scarlet Witch is a Romani-Jewish woman. In the films, Scarlet Witch was cast as a non-Jewish woman with the character's Romani ethnicity being erased and her Jewish culture being unmentioned but likely absent.
***Her having been Romani-Jewish in the comics was a vital part of her backstory in the comics as even in modern Europe, Romani peoples and those of Jewish faith are often discriminated against and ostracized.
**While she was originally a super-villain subordinate in the comics, in the comics she was originally a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. The Brotherhood of Mutants is a group of mutants led by her father, [[Magneto]], who fought against the government in hopes of achieving equal civil-rights. In the films she was made into a member of HYDRA, a group of neo-Nazis (again contributing to the erasure of Wanda's Jewish/Romani heritage in the films).
**In the comics, Wanda has legitimate mental-instability that materializes via her powers. This was alluded to in the films but is ultimately unrepresented. It would later be fully introduced and play a major part in ''WandaVision'', due to her grief for Vision's death.
*Wanda's accent becomes less and less thick with each subsequent film she appears in, and is completely gone by ''WandaVision'' except when she gets angry.
*There were issues regarding Scarlet Witch's inclusion in the MCU due to her being both an X-Men character and Avengers character and Disney did not own X-Men at the time of ''Age of Ultron''. Quicksilver was killed off in the MCU as a result while alive in the Fox X-Men films, meanwhile Scarlet Witch was only implied to exist in the Fox films.
**She was also not directly called Scarlet Witch in any of the films of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], only being called by her alias in the ''[[WandaVision]]'' series, which was produced after the Fox acquisition.
**She is also never referred to as a mutant. Her being born a mutant was opted out for having been given powers. Although it is later revealed in the ''WandaVision'' series that she was actually born a witch and always had dormant powers.
**In the comics, she and her brother [[Quicksilver]] are also the children of ''X-Men'' supervillain [[Magneto]]. Prior to the Marvel-Fox merger, the Marvel Cinematic Universe weren't allowed to reference that.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the 'X-Men' and 'Avengers' movies|website=Business Insider|date=[[May 1]], [[2015]]}}</ref>
*After 50 years of appearing in various Marvel publications, Scarlet Witch's cameo in the 2014 film, ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' marked her first-ever theatrical live-action appearance.
*The storyline of the ''WandaVision'' series seems to be based on the House of M event from the comics. Scarlet Witch was also married to [[Vision]] at one point in the comics. On top of that, in the reality created by her during the House of M event, she had twin sons with Vision, who eventually disappear alongside their fake reality, but then get reincarnated into two teenage boys that would become the superheroes Wiccan and Speed.
*[[Kevin Feige]] later revealed that Scarlet Witch is an actual sorceress, with her powers being magical in nature, and that she in fact involuntarily casting several spells. Feige also later revealed that Wanda's Chaos Magic pulls energy from other dimensions.<ref name = "Wanda's Chaos Magic">{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/wandavision-what-is-chaos-magic-explained-marvel-comics/|title=What Is Chaos Magic in MandaVision? Marvel Magic Explained|website=ComicBook|date=[[February 26]], [[2021]]}}</ref>
*[[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Sasha Pieterse]], and [[Saoirse Ronan]] were considered for the role of Scarlet Witch before Elizabeth Olsen was cast.
*[[Monica Rambeau]], one of the [[S.W.O.R.D]] agents, believes Wanda is powerful enough that she could have defeated Thanos single-handedly. Kevin Feige also had previously confirmed that the Scarlet Witch is the strongest character in the MCU and that she almost defeated Thanos by herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-strongest-mcu-hero-kevin-feige/|title=Scarlet Witch Is Strongest MCU Hero, Says Kevin Feige|website=Screenrant|date=[[December 30]], [[2019]]}}</ref>
*According to the [[On a Very Special Episode...|fifth episode]] of ''WandaVision'', Wanda is yet to adopt the alias "Scarlet Witch" in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In the [[Previously On|eighth episode]], she is called by her alias for the first time.
*Her Sorcovian fortune teller costume she wears for Halloween in the [[All-New Halloween Spooktacular!|sixth episode]] of ''Wandavision'', is the spitting image of her comic book costume.
*In the [[Previously On|seventh episode]] of ''WandaVision'', the director of S.W.O.R.D., [[Director Hayward|Tyler Hayward]], refers to Vision as Wanda's "soulmate" when he tells her that she has the power to bring him back to life. As "soulmates" is a pair of individuals with a strong bond that complement each other, also often defined as a soul split in two, this foreshadows Wanda using a piece of herself as her heart and/or soul to bring Vision back, something that happens in the end of this same episode. During the scene, a yellow colored energy comes out of her to give form to him inside the new reality and in [[The Series Finale|the final episode]], it is confirmed that Vision was created from a piece of the [[Infinity Stones|Mind Stone]] that lives inside Wanda.
**The creator of the series, Jac Schaeffer, further reinforces this idea by calling the Vision recreated by Wanda "Soul Vision".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/wandavision-series-finale-interview-jac-schaeffer-161951|title='WandaVision' Creator on Agatha's Master Plan, That Ralph Bohner Reveal and White Vision (Exclusive)|website=Entertainment Tonight|date=[[March 10]], [[2021]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedirect.com/article/wandavision-white-vision-paul-bettany-mcu-future|title=WandaVision Producer Addresses White Vision's Future In MCU|website=The Direct|date=[[March 10]], [[2021]]}}</ref>
