{{Quote|I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.|Gamora|Guardians of the Galaxy}}

'''Gamora''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] heroine who is a member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], she is one of the titular protagonists of the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' films, and also appears in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. She is a former assassin who once served her adopted father, [[Thanos]], before freeing herself and sought to stop him once and for all.

Gamora was created by Jim Starlin.

==Background==
Gamora is widely known at the most dangerous woman in the universe and skilled in the use of every weapon. She is a survivor of Thanos' massacre on half the Zen Whoberians. The strength she displayed as a child resisting [[Chitauri]] forces caught Thanos' eye that the warlord decided to take her in as one of his own once he killed her family.

===Personality===
Gamora is very strong and deadly. While her upbringing by Thanos could have turned her into someone like [[Cull Obsidian]] or [[Nebula]], Gamora is actually very friendly and naturally driven by the desire to do what is right, as opposed to what is easy. The latter trait puts her at odds with [[Star-Lord]], who has tender feelings for her, which she eventually reciprocates.

Gamora's selflessness was shown by the fact that she was willing to let Star-Lord kill her to prevent Thanos from learning the location of the Soul Stone and later quickly and desperately attempted suicide to prevent Thanos from acquiring the Stone.

After being sacrificed by Thanos, Gamora's soul trapped in the Soulworld showed a more defeated side, seemingly being the only hero who humbly accepted Thanos' victory, as when Thanos came to her, she bore no ill will towards him and calmly asked if he did it. She even showed a softer side when he solemnly replied that achieving his goal needed him to sacrifice her, sadly smiling as if to comfort Thanos.

===Abilities===
*'''Master Martial Artist''': Trained extensively by Thanos and having years of fighting experience when carrying out Thanos' missions, Gamora is highly proficient in both armed and hand-to-hand combat. Gamora's skills were so advanced that even Thanos himself held her at such high regard that he openly considered her the finest of his children and the fiercest woman in the Galaxy, with her being known to having constantly beat Nebula, a very proficient fighter in her own right, in their spars.She quickly gained and maintained the upper hand over Star-Lord, easily broke out from Groot and Rocket's attempts to restrain her, and while holding back, as she was only attempting to reason with Nebula rather than kill her, easily held her own against and eventually defeated Nebula even after Nebula disarmed her.
*'''Master Assassin''': Gamora is an exceptional assassin, being so great that she was known for never having failed her missions while under Thanos' tutelage and even earning such fearful reputation that she was considered the "deadliest woman in the galaxy" due to her work as an assassin.
*'''Sword Mastery''': Gamora is shown to be highly skilled in using her sword, with it being her primary method of combat, as she was able to easily amputate and overpower Groot, battle against Nebula wielding her batons during the Battle of Xandar, disarming her of one of her weapons, and cut down the Abilisk. 
*'''Expert Marksman''': Although Gamora was known to prefer using melee combat, especially swords, much more often, her training under Thanos nevertheless allowed her to acquire a level of proficiency in using firearms. She displayed this skill when she effectively wielded a rifle while battling the Abilisk, and later turned a ship's turret into a hand-held weapon and accurately shot and swiftly destroyed the M-Ship Nebula attacked her on.
*'''Expert Pilot''': Gamora is a capable pilot, as shown when in an attempt to escape from Nebula and a group of Sakaarans on Knowhere, Gamora was able to single-handedly command and fly a mining pod with relative ease. She managed to avoid being decisively shot down until she was eventually forced to escape to space, which shut down her pod and allowed Nebula to shoot her down.

===Weapons and equipment===
*'''Godslayer''': Gamora's weapon of choice, a retractable sword that she used to amputate Groot's limbs when he attempted to restrain her, and in her duel against Nebula. The original Godslayer was broken in two when she attempted to kill an illusion of Thanos before she stabbed him with a part of the sword. A past version of Godslayer is still in use by a version of Gamora from 2014.
*'''Gamora's Switchblade''': Thanos gave her a switchblade during their first encounter on Zen-Whoberi. Gamora later used it in her attempted assassination of Thanos on Knowhere.
*'''Power Stone''': During their final battle with Ronan the Accuser, Gamora and the other Guardians of the Galaxy used the Power Stone in tandem to direct the Stone's energy at Ronan, destroying his body and killing him.
*'''Plasma Rifle''': During an encounter with the Abilisk, Gamora used a plasma rifle to fight off an attempt to kill it, only to have it run out of ammo.
*'''Cybernetic Skeleton''': While in the service of Thanos, Gamora had cybernetic appendages installed in her providing enhanced strength and durability.
*'''Ocular and Respiratory Implants''': Gamora had implants installed in her visual system and respiratory system, providing enhanced stamina and vision.
*'''Aero-Rigs''': Another invention of Rocket, a jet-pack device that allowed Gamora to fly smoothly through the air while fighting the Abilisk.

==Appearances==
===[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]===
====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''====
In the film, she is hired by the [[Collector]] to secure the [[Orb]] and agrees to aid [[Ronan the Accuser]] and her sister [[Nebula]] under the pretense of helping Thanos but in truth to prevent the Orb from falling into the wrong hands.

[[File:Guardians Of The Galaxy TRC1100 COMP V044.1043.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gamora confronts Peter Quill.]]
She locates the Orb to be in the possession of [[Star-Lord]], and assaults him on [[Xandar]] while he tried to sell the artifact to a merchant. Her attack is hindered, however, as two criminals, [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]] and [[Groot]] arrive trying to capture Star-Lord for the high bounty on his head. In the battle, all four are arrested by the [[Nova Corps]] and transported to the Kyln prison facility. With her reputation as an assassin and connection to Ronan renown, Gamora becomes a quick target to prisoners and guards alike on the ship, especially by a prisoner named [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], whose wife and child had been murdered by Ronan. With Gamora being connected to Ronan, Drax attempts to kill her, but Star-Lord arrives on the scene and convinces him to let her live since he can get Ronan through her.

[[File:Guardians Of The Galaxy NBJ0600 comp v033 grade.1203.jpg|thumb|250px|Gamora alone with Peter Quill.|alt=]]
Thankful for Star-Lord's assistance, Gamora explains to him her plan to betray Ronan and gets him, Groot and Rocket to work together to escape the Kyln in exchange for the payment promised to her by the Collector. Initiating the plan, the group creates a prison riot while Rocket rewires the ship's systems and are able to arrive at the docking bay and escape onto Star-Lord's ship, however Drax joins the group due to aiding them during the riot, much to Gamora's chagrin. Once they arrive at [[Knowhere]], the location of the Collector, the group recuperates before delivering the Orb. Star-Lord attempts to woo Gamora, but she rejects his advances, finding Star-Lord to be insensitive towards her. Eventually, they arrive at the Collector's base, where the Collector introduces himself. Examining the Orb, the Collector explains that the Orb in fact holds an [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Stone]]. However, Tivan's assistant, [[Carina]], grabs the Stone to use it to help her escape from the Collector's torment but its power proves to be too much for her body, and she is destroyed in an explosion of energy, which sends the group flying outside.

Ronan arrives due to Drax contacting him to battle, forcing the others to escape by mining ships and are pursued by Ronan's followers. When they chase them into space, Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating and vulnerable to death. To save her life, Star-Lord ejects himself from his ship and gives her his helmet for her to survive while he summons his former Ravager captain [[Yondu Udonta|Yondu]]; Yondu arrives and collects the pair before they succumb to the exposure. Rocket, Drax, and Groot arrive to attack the Ravager ship, but Star-Lord manages to persuade Yondu to help them stop Ronan in exchange for giving him the Infinity Stone to sell. Although the rest of the group is doubtful knowing that fighting against Ronan would cost them their lives, Gamora chooses to fight to prevent many other lives lost by Ronan along with everyone else.

[[File:Gamorareachingout.png|thumb|250px|Gamora tries to save Quill.|left]]
They then set course to Xandar, where Ronan is about to purge the planet. With the aid of Yondu and the Nova Corps, Gamora, Star-Lord, Rocket, Groot, and Drax manage to breach Ronan's ship where they are confronted by Nebula. Gamora combats her sister while the others move towards Ronan. Just as Gamora gains the upper hand, Nebula falls with her cybernetic arm clinging on the ship's edge. Gamora tries to lift her up, but Nebula refuses the mercy and cuts her arm off, landing on a ship which she hijacks and escapes. With Nebula defeated, Gamora deactivates the barrier to Ronan's chambers and rejoins the group, but they find themselves completely outmatched by his power until Rocket flies Star-Lord's ship through the ship and collides with Ronan.

The damage causes the ship to crash land on Xandar with the group still in it, but Groot wraps his branches around them to protect the group from impact but sacrificing himself in the process. Ronan emerges from the wreck and dubs the heroes "Guardians of the Galaxy" while stating their efforts to be meaningless and prepares to destroy Xander, but Star-Lord distracts him allowing Drax to destroy Ronan's hammer. Star-Lord grabs the Infinity Stone but its power begins to destroy him until Gamora reaches through the field of energy to Star-Lord and joins hands with him. Drax and Rocket do the same, and they are able to contain its power. With it, Star-Lord uses the Stone to destroy Ronan.

[[File:StarlordandGamora.png|thumb|250px|Gamora sets out with the rest of the Guardians.]]
To prevent the Stone from being used to create any more chaos, Quill switches it with a false one to give Yondu while giving the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As a reward for saving the planet, the Nova Corps rebuild Quill's ship and make their team an official protection force, expunging the Guardians' criminal histories as well. Gamora notes to Drax that he had received his revenge against Ronan and his family would be happy, but Drax states that Ronan was only a puppet; Thanos is the one he must hunt down. Taking off in their ship, the Guardians prepare to leave on their next adventure.

====''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''====
Gamora reappears in this film as an enemy to Ego and the Sovereign. Gamora and Peter get closer romantically and finally realize their feelings for each other and they start dating in the following 4 years before the Infinity War.

====''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''====
[[File:AW Trailer 2 pic 4.png|thumb|250px]]
Hearing a distress call from the ''Statesman'', the Guardians recovered the Norse God of thunder, [[Thor Odinson]]. He revealed to the team that [[Thanos]] had collected the space stone, and destroyed Xandar to collect the Power Stone. When telling them that he was going to Knowhere, the Guardians went to the planet as Rocket, Groot, and Thor travelled to the dwarf planet to create a powerful weapon.

On the way to Knowhere, Gamora took [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill/Star-Lord]] to one side and made him promise to kill her if Thanos captured her. Gamora told him that she knew something that Thanos could never know. Star-Lord asked her what it was, but Gamora refused to tell him, stating that he would be in danger if he knew as well. As they embraced each other and kissed, their moment was interrupted by [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], who was "mastering" the art of being invisible by standing totally still. As the two rebutted his argument, [[Mantis]] appeared and greeted him much to his disappointment.

[[File:GamoraTellsS-LordToShootHer.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Gamora asks Peter Quill to kill her.]]

On Knowhere, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis confronted the Mad Titan, with Gamora stabbing him with the switchblade he gave her. It was then revealed that Thanos already got the Reality Stone from the Collector and used it to stage the event. While the Mad Titan has Gamora in his grip, she and Peter confess their love for each other and she asks him to keep his promise to kill her. However, Peter fails to kill Gamora as Thanos uses the stone he just acquired to turn his weapon into bubbles before kidnapping her from the team. 

Thanos takes her back to his ship, where Gamora argues with Thanos on balancing the universe. After failing to both reconnect with Gamora and justify his plans to her, Thanos reveals that he is holding her adoptive sister [[Nebula]] captive after foiling her attempt to kill him. Gamora witnesses Nebula being tortured by Thanos while he demands her to reveal the location of the Soul Stone. Despite Gamora's claims that she doesn't know the location of the stone, Thanos reveals a hologram projection from Nebula's memory, where Gamora tells her sister that she found the stone. As Thanos continues to torture Nebula, Gamora can't stand watching her sister in pain and finally confess the location of the stone to save her. With this, Gamora reveals that she found the stone on [[Vormir]].

[[File:4k-infinitywar-movie-screencaps.com-15435.jpg|thumb|250px|Gamora is forced off the cliff by Thanos.]]

Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where the two meet the Stonekeeper, [[Red Skull]], who reveals that the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone the person loves the most. This raises Gamora's confidence, as she states that Thanos has failed in his task because he doesn't love anyone. However, when Thanos cries for having to sacrifice his favorite adopted daughter, Gamora realizes to her horror that she was wrong. With the reaveal that Thanos truly does love her, Gamora tries to prevent what is to happen by attempting to commit suicide with her switchblade, but Thanos stops her using the Reality Stone to turn the blade into bubbles. Heartbroken, Thanos reluctantly kills Gamora by throwing her off a cliff, allowing him to gain the Soul Stone.

After Gamora failed to stop the Mad Titan, the other heroes are also unable to defeat him. The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange are all beaten by Thanos, leading to him wiping out half of the life in the universe. Despite her death, Gamora's soul lies within the Soul Stone and Thanos later talks to young Gamora after succeeding in his goal.

====''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''====
[[File:Gamora (Back In 2014).png|left|thumb|250x250px]]
When Thanos of 2014 travels forwards in time to the present in order to attack the heroes of Earth, the Gamora 2014 follows him to the present. After Hulk/Bruce Banner uses the Infinity Gauntlet to undo the snap and bring everyone back to life, 2014 Gamora joins the other heroes in their fight against 2014 Thanos and his army of [[Chitauri]], Outriders and the [[Black Order]], with a resurrected Quill overjoyed to be fighting side by side with the 2014 Gamora, even though the latter has no memory of him.

After the battle, the 2014 Gamora survives Tony's snap off-screen but is not present at his funeral. A deleted scene confirms her survival, and she is shown mourning Tony's death after the battle before leaving on her own. While the Guardians prepare to go back to space, Quill is shown to be searching for the 2014 Gamora.

====''[[What If...?]]''====
Gamora first appeared in "[[What If... Ultron Won?]]". Ultron targeted Vormir, as she, along with other Guardians, became the victims of Ultron's universal onslaught.

Another Gamora appeared in the [[What If... The Watcher Broke His Oath?|final episode of ''What If...?'' season 1]]. In her reality, she slain her father Thanos and allied with [[Iron Man]] on a quest to destroy the Infinity Stones. She requested Eitri to melt an Infinity Gauntlet, not long before she met the Watcher.

===Marvel Animated Universe===
====''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''====

When Rocket Raccoon's ship is pulled into the Chitauri ship, Rocket fakes surrender so that they can free the captive Guardians of the Galaxy members. Afterwards, Spider-Man discovers that the Chitauri are planning to destroy the Earth. The Guardians plan to run the Chitauri ship into the sun while fighting the Chitauri forces. When their tactic does not work, the Guardians end up making their way towards the Dark Matter Cannon. While Nova and Spider-Man head to the Dark Matter Cannon, the Guardians fight the Chitauri and Korvac. After Korvac is defeated by Groot, Nova destroys the Dark Matter Cannon and the Chitauri ship is destroyed.

In the episode "The Return of the Guardians of the Galaxy", Gamora was seen recuperating on the Guardians of the Galaxy's spaceship when they land on Earth at the time when Titus leads the Chitauri into targeting Nova's helmet. When she recovers in time to help fight Titus' forces, she voiced her disdain that they had to land on Earth. After Titus was defeated and the remaining Chitauri escape, Nick Fury was displeased that Gamora showed up on Earth again when she said that she wouldn't return. Gamora stated "I lied" and then left with the Guardians of the Galaxy with Titus in their custody.

==Trivia==
*Before [[Zoe Saldana]] was cast as Gamora: Gina Carano, [[Rachel Nichols]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Olivia Wilde]], and Thandie Newton were all considered for the role.
*Zoe Saldana has said the relationship between Gamora and [[Nebula]] is her favorite aspect of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', and hits close to home for her, having sisters of her own.
*In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gamora was adopted when she was a child by Thanos after a genocide he committed on her home planet. In the original comic books, she was created by Thanos using genetic engineering.
*Gamora shares a similar name to a fictional kaiju from the Ultraman franchise, Gomora.
*As of the mainline comic book series in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3 comic series, she was given a full name '''Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan'''. As she is Gamora Zen Whoberi and calls [[Nova (Marvel)|Nova]], "Richard-Human" instead of "Richard Rider", it may be a cultural affectation of her species.
**This was actually being included prior to the first ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' movie first released, and yet to give her official full name in Marvel Cinematic Universe for years.
