==Appearances==
===''[[Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''===
The son of Midtown High teacher [[Spencer Smythe]], Alistair was also a student of his father. When visiting Oscorp Tower on a field trip, Spencer insisted Alistair be paired with [[Harry Osborn]], a former Midtown student who had joined the student group for his friend [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].

When the tour guide asked for volunteers to try out a two-manned robot, Alistair attempted to come forward, but Harry stopped him to suggest Peter and his trip partner [[Liz Allan]] went instead, much to Alistair's annoyance. He later applied to Osborn Academy for Geniuses, being accepted sometime later.

After [[Vulture (Marvel)|Vulture]] was released from prison and given a teaching position at Osborn Academy, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] told him to go to Horizon High to steal the V-252. He refused, however, Alistair volunteered to do it for him.

At the Stark Expo, Alistair, Vulture, and a few Osborn Academy students in Vulture suits tried to combat [[Ghost]], but Ghost made their suits malfunction.

==Trivia==
*This is the first teenage adaptation of the character.
