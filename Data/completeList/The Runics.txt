Nashter is the former leader of The Runics. He ran away from his position when his superiors punished him for failing the mission.

He has control over the element of quintessence, which he uses for evil purposes. His other abilities include flying, telepathy and general magic use. It is not known which planet he comes from but he mentions that he used to play a game like soccer there, the only difference being the use of magic.
