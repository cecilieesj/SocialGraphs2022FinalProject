'''Tano''' is a minor antagonist that appears in [[The Lion Guard|''The Lion Guard'']].  He is a loyal member of [[Janja's Clan]]. Tano along with his fellow clan member Nne aided Janja in his plans to attack the [[Pride Lands]], but were always stopped by Kion and the Lion Guard. However, when he was appointed to be second-in-command alongside [[Nne]], he slowly took advantage of the position to control [[Janja]]. Tano and Nne betrayed Janja and attempted to score the meal themselves, but they were thwarted by [[Kion]]'s [[Roar of the Elders]]. They made they're betrayal to Janja's not smart side, as seen in "[[Janja's New Crew]]." They end up returning to the clan and continue serving under Janjaâ€™s lead.

==Background==
===Personality===
Despite his initial unassuming nature, Tano is clever, and ruthless, providing more ingenious schemes than even his leader can come up with. He will gladly abandon others which he feels are preventing him from reaching his goal or are slowing him down in the process, regardless of how much higher in rank that individual may be; like his clan leader and acts derisively toward Janja. Tano is also very arrogant; despite losing constantly to Kion when he uses his Roar of the Elders, he frequently underestimates its true power, as he taunted Kion to see if he would use it again.

===Appearance===
Tano is a gray hyena with long forelegs and a sloping body. He has a darker gray muzzle and spots on his back and neck. His paws, tail, and ears are black, and a few hairs sprout from his otherwise smooth head. He has large, round ears with dull pink inner ears.

===Abilities===
*'''Expert Hunter:''' Tano is a capable hunter.
*'''High-Level Intellect:''' Tano is shown to be one of the most intelligent hyenas of the hyena clan, his intellect surpasses Janja's.

==History==
===''[[The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar]]''===
Tano is first seen with his clan in the [[Outlands]], where he is watching Janja chew on a bone. Along with his clan mates, he laughs at Janja for not noticing a butterfly on his head. Later, Tano sings "[[Tonight We Strike]]" and joins his clan in invading the Pride Lands. During the clan's attack on a herd of gazelles, Tano is defeated by Fuli, though he is ultimately banished from the kingdom by Kion's Roar of the Elders.

===[[Never Judge a Hyena by its Spots]]===
Tano and the rest of the clan are blocking [[Jasiri]] from escaping them. They converge on her, with Tano grinning as Cheezi decides to go first. However, Jasiri knocks him into Tano and the others, causing them to fall in a heap. Kion arrives, and a battle begins. Tano sneaks up behind Kion, but Jasiri pins him down before he can advance further. The clan finally manages to back Kion and Jasiri into a corner, but Kion uses the Roar of the Elders, and the hyenas flee.

===[[Can't Wait to be Queen]]===
Tano participates in ambushing [[Kiara]] at Broken Rock, as Janja hopes to ransom her for Simba's kingdom. However, when the Lion Guard arrives in Kiara's defense, Janja calls for a retreat.

===[[The Kupatana Celebration]]===
When [[Dogo]] the jackal pup invades the hyenas' dens, Tano and his clan take chase. They eventually corner Dogo in a canyon, but the Lion Guard comes to the pup's rescue. Happy to have Dogo off his paws, Janja lets Kion take responsibility for the pup, and the clan returns to the deep Outlands.

===[[Fuli's New Family]]===
In the Outlands, Tano is resting peacefully with the rest of his clan, when all of a sudden an excited Cheezi races into the den with news of a meal that is being 'delivered'. The meal in questions is revealed to be Bunga, and Tano follows his clan to the lone honey badger. Tano and his clan surround him, but Fuli arrives just in time to save her friend from being hyena food, leaping onto a rock which breaks and starts to flow down the lava. Unwilling to give up, Tano and the rest of his clan follow them, racing down the side of the fast flowing lava. When they reach the end, the rest of the Lion Guard pop out nearby, prompting Tano to run.

===[[Janja's New Crew]]===
While the Lion Guard is patrolling the Pride Lands, Tano and his clan mates spy on them from a ridge. Janja plans to attack a herd of [[wildebeests]] once the team is out of sight, but he ends up slipping on mud and gives the clan away. Furious, Kion uses the Roar of the Elders to blow them back into the Outlands, where Janja vents his rage on Cheezi and Chungu.

Janja accuses Cheezi and Chungu of always messing up his plans and banishes them from the clan. He then appoints Tano and Nne in their place and orders them to drive Cheezi and Chungu out of the Pride Lands. The two obey, barking and snarling at Cheezi and Chungu until they flee to the Pride Lands.

Later, Tano and Nne propose a plan to Janja: they bait the Lion Guard with a stampede of antelope and then change direction and attack a herd of oryxes instead. Impressed by the ingeniousness of the plan, Janja agrees.

Together, the three start a stampede of antelope, and Tano and Nne force Janja to hide from the Lion Guard with them. However, as they begin to chase the herd of oryxes, they betray Janja, forcing him off the edge of a high cliff. However, as they corner the herd in a dead-end canyon, the Lion Guard arrives, and Kion expels the two hyenas with the Roar of the Elders.

Once the Lion Guard turn their backs on them, Janja is quick to lead his clan back in to search once more for the gazelle, where they encounter and surround [[Nala]]. Nne snaps at her, forcing her to jump back to avoid him. Before any of them can make a move on her again, Kion arrives in time to use the Roar of the Elders in extreme anger, blasting the whole clan back to the Outlands.
