'''Gerald''' is a minor character in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' who is a very close friend of [[Nigel (Finding Nemo)|Nigel]].

==Appearance==
Gerald is a Pelican with a light white head and a dark brown torso, body, and tail. He has a orange throat pouch with a spiky end at the tip of his beak. He has dark purple eye circles around his eyes, and his head feathers are notably very messy and scruffy; probably to assume his scrappiness.

==Appearances==

===''[[Finding Nemo]]''===
Gerald scoops up and swallows [[Marlin]] and [[Dory]] after the two fish arrive at the [[Sydney Harbour]]. Marlin is determined not to be eaten after coming so far, so he and Dory lodge themselves in Gerald's throat, making him choke. The other pelicans, including [[Nigel (Finding Nemo)|Nigel]], witness Gerald choking and Nigel flies over to help his friend. Gerald opens his mouth to reveal Marlin and Dory to Nigel, who then hits Gerald's neck, making him spit out Marlin and Dory, who then try to escape from becoming a food for pelicans and Nigel whacks Gerald with his wing knocking him out. Gerald is not seen again after that.

==Description==
"This scraggy specimen loves his food, but he bites off more than he can chew when he tries to swallow both Marlin and Dory. They refuse to go down, and Nigel has to come to Gerald's rescue with a wing-slap on the back. When he's not choking on clownfish, Gerald can usually be found sitting on the roof of the bait shop, baiting the seagulls."

==Trivia==
*Even though he is labeled as a Brown Pelican ''(Pelecanus occidentalis)'', he does not have the signatured yellow pinch blaze on his head like real Brown Pelicans do.
