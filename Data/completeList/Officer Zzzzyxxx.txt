'''Officer Zzzzyxxx''' or simply '''Zzzzyxxx''' is a character appearing in [[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]] at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

== Background ==
Zzzzyxxx is an officer who works for [[Star Tours (company)|Star Tours]] as a security guard at spaceport customs sometime between 19 BBY and 0 BBY.  Zzzzyxxx has his own station located in-between Star Tours and the [[Pan Galactic Pizza Port]].  At his station, Zzzzyxxx would control safety for Star Tours and keep track of weather on different planets such as [[Bespin]].

== Appearances ==

=== Star Tours: The Adventures Continue ===
In Tokyo Disneyland, Zzzzyxxx could be found in-between Star Tours' exit and the entrance for the Pan Galactic Pizza Port where he would interact with guests.

== Trivia ==
* Imagineering show-writer Kevin Rafferty was inspired to make the character's name by the Zzyxx road in Las Vegas.
* Zzzzyxxx's figure design was repurposed in Walt Disney World for the character of [[Sonny Eclipse]] at [[Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe]].   According to Imagineer Kevin Rafferty, the two characters are intended to be cousins.
