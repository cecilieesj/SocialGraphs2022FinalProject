It is the sequel to the [[2009]] film, ''[[Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure]]'' and revolves around [[Tinker Bell]], a fairy character created by J.M. Barrie in his play ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' and featured in subsequent adaptations. The film was produced using Digital 3D modeling. It was released on [[DVD]] and Blu-ray by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on [[September 21]], [[2010]].

==Plot==
Like many other fairies from Pixie Hollow, [[Tinker Bell]] ([[Mae Whitman]]) attends fairy camp on the mainland. When she attempts to go find some lost things, Vidia ([[Pamela Adlon]]) asks her if she's going to the human house, which isn't too far from camp. The question makes Tinker Bell curious and she eventually sneaks off. Vidia follows behind to watch over her. When Tink reaches the human house, she is amazed by their "horseless carriage". She takes the time to flitter around under the car, while Vidia tries to get her to leave. Eventually they do, but on their way back to camp, Tink and Vidia stumble upon a fairy sized house made by Elizabeth Griffiths (Lauren Mote), a human girl who wishes to meet a real fairy. Tinker Bell immediately heads in to investigate, despite Vidia's constant warnings to leave. Tink claims it to be perfectly safe, so Vidia uses her wind to slam the door in an attempt to give Tink a little scare but it unintentionally locks Tink inside.

When Lizzy begins to approach the house, Vidia tries to free Tink but it's no use. Lizzy discovers Tink inside the house and takes her to her home. She prepares to show her father, Dr. Griffiths (Michael Sheen), but upon witnessing all the butterflies he has pinned in display cases for research, she decides to keep Tink a secret. Meanwhile, Vidia rallies Rosetta ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), Iridessa ([[Raven-Symoné]]), Fawn ([[Angela Bartys]]), Silvermist ([[Lucy Liu]]), Clank ([[Jeff Bennett]]), and Bobble ([[Rob Paulsen]]) to rescue Tink.

Back at the human house, Lizzy reveals her fascination with fairies to Tink. Tink is flattered by the child's obsession, and since it's raining outside, Tink decides to teach her nearly everything about fairies. She tells her how light fairies make rainbows, how animal fairies paint butterflies, and much more. They record their information in a new research book given to Lizzy by her father. During this time, Tink and Lizzy have grown a great friendship, but the rain dies down after a while, and Tink can return to camp. She gives a sad Lizzy a hug and makes her way out, but she watches Lizzy attempt to show her father the research before she leaves.

Unfortunately, Dr. Griffiths is too busy fixing the house's leaks. Tink returns and decides to fix the leaks so Lizzy may spend more time with her father. But with her father study, he ignore his daughter. Dr. Griffiths was planning on showing to a group of scientists, which causes a stern and suspicious Dr. Griffiths to ground Lizzy. After she chooses to release a butterfly. To make up, Tink shows Lizzy how to fly, and when her father finds footprints on the ceiling, she tells him about Tink. Lizzy didn't like to lie. He furiously discards the claims and begins to throw all her fairy drawings, and research book, into the trash.

Upon seeing this, Tink loses her temper completely, and the fairy reveals herself, telling the father off while doing so (though he only hears jingles when she talks). The astonishing sight of a fairy prompts Dr. Griffiths to capture Tink, but Vidia arrives and pushes her out the way. Vidia is then taken by Dr. Griffiths to London for research, but Lizzy and the fairies convince him to think otherwise, which he does. Vidia is freed, and form a friendships. Lizzy and her father are now closer than ever.

In the End, Tinkerbell holds a tea party for her fairy fairies near the fairy camp on the mainland. Along with Lizzy and her father joining.

Disney qualified the film in an unsuccessful effort to expand the category's final nominations from 3 to 5, as, under the Academy rules in effect that year, 5 films could only have been nominated in a calendar year in which 16 or more animated films were submitted. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film was released in cinemas on August 13, 2010, following a premiere held at the May Fair Hotel in London on August 8, attended by Lauren Mote."
