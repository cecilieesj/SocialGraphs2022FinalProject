==Trivia==
*This movie shares similarities to the Disney direct-to-video animated sequel, ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]''. They both take place after the events of their original films and use three episodes from ''[[Hercules (TV series)|Hercules: The Series]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Tarzan]]'' as flashbacks and fill the main plot. They both also serve as the series finale films to their respective television series, similar to ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''.
*Some of the dialogue between [[Hercules (character)|Hercules]] and [[Megara]] are altered to fit the episodes. An example of this is "Hercules and the Visit From Zeus" replacing the clip of Hercules graduating from Prometheus Academy. Also, in order to better segue into the stories from the sequences from "Hercules and the Yearbook", the opening scenes of each episode were cut.
