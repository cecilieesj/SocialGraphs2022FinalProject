'''''Mickey Cuts Up''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' short that debuted on [[November 30]], [[1931]].

==Synopsis==
[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] are next-door neighbours tending their yards. When Minnie is captured by a bird's song, Mickey hides in his bird-house and pretends to be a bird himself, until a cat attacks and blows his cover. Then he does a dance while wearing the house; their song attracts more birds, and again the cat. [[Pluto]] chases, but he's still pulling the lawnmower, and it causes much destruction.
