'''''The Santa Clause''''' (stylized as '''''The Santa Claus<sub><big><big>e</big></big></sub>''''') is a [[1994]] American film directed by [[John Pasquin]], distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and co-produced by [[Hollywood Pictures]]. It is the only film in the ''Santa Clause'' trilogy to be rated PG by the MPAA.

In the film, [[Tim Allen]] plays [[Scott Calvin]], an ordinary man who accidentally kills [[Santa Claus]] on Christmas Eve. When he and his young son finish Santa's trip and deliveries, they go to the [[North Pole]], where Scott learns he must become the new Santa and convince those he loves that he is indeed Father Christmas.

==Plot==
[[Scott Calvin]] ([[Tim Allen]]) is a divorced father and ad executive with a young son, [[Charlie Calvin|Charlie]]. On Christmas Eve, Charlie comes over to spend the night with Scott before going back to his mother's for Christmas Day. That night, they are awakened by a clatter on the roof. Going outside to investigate, Scott can see someone on the roof. He yells at the trespasser, which causes the man to lose his balance and fall to his death. He appears to be [[Santa Claus]].

Santa magically disappears after his fatal fall, but his familiar red and white suit remains. Scott and Charlie find a card in a pocket which reads ''If something should happen to me, put on my suit. The reindeer will know what to do.'' Santa's sleigh and eight reindeer are found perched atop the house. Scott puts on the suit to please Charlie, and begins delivering toys from rooftop to rooftop.

Their final stop is the [[North Pole]]. The head elf, [[Bernard (Santa Clause)|Bernard]] ([[David Krumholtz]]), shows Scott a tiny inscription on the card which says that, upon the death of the previous occupant, whoever wears the suit assumes the identity of Santa Claus and all the responsibilities that go with it. This is the "Santa Clause", as stated by Bernard: "You put on the suit, you're the big guy." (In other words, whether Scott likes it or not, he is now Santa Claus for life!) He also gives Charlie a snow globe. Then, he meets an elf named [[Judy]] who tells Scott that he only has eleven months, until the next Thanksgiving to get his affairs in order before becoming Santa Claus full-time, which he tries to refuse. Charlie and he spend the night at the factory. The next morning they awake back in Scott's home, where the only indication of their previous night's adventure is Scott's new silk pajamas with "SC" (which stands for either "'''S'''anta '''C'''laus" or "'''S'''cott '''C'''alvin") monogrammed on them. Scott dismisses it all as a dream.

Soon, however, Scott starts gaining weight and his boss, [[Mr. Whittle]] (Peter Boyle), likens him to the Pillsbury Doughboy. He develops a ravenous taste for Christmas treats, like Christmas cookies and hot cocoa. He grows a long gray beard, and shaving it off has no effect; it regrows instantly. His hair whitens, despite all attempts to dye it. He somehow knows who has been "naughty" and "nice". Children (who somehow know he's Santa despite Scott not dressing the part) approach him with gift requests. Scott's rapid transformation worries his ex-wife, [[Laura Miller|Laura]] (Wendy Crewson), and her new husband, psychiatrist Dr. [[Neil Miller]] (Judge Reinhold), who try to terminate his visitation rights to Charlie. They question Scott's mental stability, and believe that his changes are attempts at getting Charlie to like him.

Eventually, Scott's visitation rights to Charlie are taken away. Disheartened, Scott begins to lose some of his certainty about his job as Santa. While visiting Charlie on Thanksgiving, Charlie's insistence that Scott is Santa reawakens Scott's magic and he, with Bernard's help, whisks Charlie away to the North Pole. Laura and Neil, who think Scott has kidnapped Charlie against his will, call the police, who make a massive investigation.

Meanwhile, at the North Pole, Charlie helps Scott and the elves perfect a new sled and communication devices. He calls occasionally, but this only reinforces Laura and Neil's belief that he is being held against his will. Eventually, Scott, as Santa Claus, goes on with his Christmas Eve trip, but is arrested while delivering presents to Charlie's home, and is falsely accused of kidnapping him. A team of rescue-elves, the ELFS, free Scott from jail by tying up the front desk guard and using tinsel to break through the bars (which Scott is very impressed by), and fly Scott and Charlie home to his parents, to whom Scott/Santa gives the presents they always wanted since childhood but never got: Laura gets a vintage ''Mystery Date'' game and Neil gets an Oscar Mayer "Weenie Whistle". It was because of them not getting these presents that they became convinced Santa didn't exist.

Laura, finally realizing her mistake of not accepting that Scott really is the new Santa, tosses the custody papers into the fireplace and welcomes Scott to come see Charlie any time he wants. Bernard tells Charlie that the snow globe is magic. Anytime he wants his father to visit, all he has to do is shake it. Neal owes Charlie an apology for refusing to accept that Scott really is the new Santa and Charlie forgives him. After ten minutes, Charlie shakes it and Scott comes back, says he was off to Cleveland, and takes Charlie with him.

==VHS and DVD==
The film made its home video debut on VHS and Laserdisc on [[October 20]], [[1995]]. It was later one of Disney's earliest DVD releases, released on [[October 6]], [[1998]]. The DVD presented the film in non-anamorphic widescreen and included the theatrical trailer.

In [[2002]], to promote the release of ''The Santa Clause 2'', a Special Edition DVD was released, in pan-and-scan fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen variants. It included two featurettes, "So You Wanna Be an Elf?" and "Making Santa Snacks with Wolfgang [Puck]", and a set-top trivia game titled "Santa's Helper"; playing through the game allowed the viewer to watch the 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' short ''[[The Night Before Christmas]]''. The disc also included two DVD-ROM features, an Advent calendar titled "25 Days Till Christmas", and a writing program titled "Letters to Santa". For some reason, the theatrical trailer was not also included on this disc.

The movie was released on Blu-ray on October 16, 2012, both individually and in a box set with the sequels. The Blu-ray retained the two featurettes from the 2002 DVD, as well as the ''The Night Before Christmas'', but dropped the trivia game and the DVD-ROM features.

==Sequels==
The popularity of the film spawned two sequels, ''The Santa Clause 2'' in 2002 and ''Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause'' in 2006. Much of the character cast remains the same for each film, but with some additions.

In ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'', Scott has been declared to be the best Santa ever, but with Charlie on the naughty list and the work becoming more hectic, he learns he must find a suitable wife or give up his duties as Santa.

In ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'', the North Pole and its holiday operation is threatened by the villainous [[Jack Frost]] ([[Martin Short]]), who plans to take over Christmas.

There’s also a TV spinoff [[Santa Clauses]] which was released in 2022 during the holiday season.

==Trivia==
*Despite its PG rating, several scenes were cut from the film's Freeform broadcasts, including the scene where Scott (while still transforming into Santa) shows his enlarged chest to the dietitian (possibly due to a confusion with nudity) and mild swearing.
*Initial releases of this movie had Laura giving Scott a card with Neil's mother's phone number before she left. This was removed in future versions because the number on the card, "1-800-SPANK-ME" is a real sex hotline number and it raised huge phone bills.
*Though the story is set in a city in Illinois, the film was shot in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.
*The books ''The Berenstain Bears and Trouble with School'' and ''The Magic School Bus: On the Ocean Floor'' can be seen in the classroom of Charlie's school.
*In 2020, the [[Disney Channel]] aired [[w:c:bigcitygreens:The Santa Clause (Lip Switch)|a ''Lip Switch'' short]] presenting an abridged gag dub of ''The Santa Clause'' featuring the main cast of ''[[Big City Greens]]'' (with [[Bill Green|Bill]] as Scott, [[Cricket Green|Cricket]] as Charlie, [[Tilly Green|Tilly]] as Bernard, and [[Gramma Alice|Alice]] as Comet the reindeer).
