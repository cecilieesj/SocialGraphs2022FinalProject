'''''Cruella 2''''' is an upcoming American film that will be the sequel to the [[2021]] comedy crime movie ''[[Cruella]]''. Nothing is known much about the sequel except that it is set for  a possible release in [[2023]] on [[Disney+]], According to ''The Hollywood Reporter.''

== Development ==
=== Production status ===
According to ''Screen Rant'', Disney is moving forward with ''Cruella 2'' after the first movie's satisfying performance at the box office and Disney+ Premier Access, as well as its positive reception from critics and audiences alike, there seems to be high interest to see ''Cruella 2.'' This comes as good news for Disney+ and fans of Cruella, as the recent conflict between Scarlett Johansson and Disney over the hybrid release of ''Black Widow'' had cast some doubts over the possibility of Emma Stone appearing in a future Disney+ release. The favorable reviews ''Cruella'' has received are a good sign that audiences are interested in following Cruella's story in a direct sequel, a spinoff, or perhaps a ''101 Dalmatians'' movie. ''Cruella'' certainly lays the groundwork for another film and has a mid-credits scene that teases ''101 Dalmatians'' down the road.

In May 2021, both Emma Stone and Thompson stated that they would like to do a second Cruella film in the style of The Godfather Part II, as a combined prequel/sequel that bounces back and forth from the Baroness's origin and Cruella's new adventure. This would present the opportunity to bring back Glenn Close's iconic performance from Disney's early 2000s movies alongside Emma Stone's reimagining. We may even see the story from Cruella's perspective, or it could take the elements introduced in the first film and tell an original story about Cruella and her accomplices that further establishes de Vil's hatred of dalmatians. Taking all these possibilities into account, it's likely that Disney will take some liberties regarding ''101 Dalmatians'' canon to accommodate new stories. It also serving as both a sequel and prequel.

In June 2021, Disney announced that a sequel is officially in the early stages of development, with Gillespie and McNamara expected to return as director and writer, respectively. In August 2021, Stone closed a deal to reprise her role in the sequel.

== Overview ==
Cruella 2 will be directed by award winning, Australian-American commercial, music video and television director Craig Gillespie. He is best known for directing the films ''Lars and the Real Girl, Fright Night, I, Tonya,'' and the first ''Cruella'' film; he will be back to direct the second ''Cruella'' film. And ''Doctor Doctor'' star Tony McNamara will be on board to write the sequel.
