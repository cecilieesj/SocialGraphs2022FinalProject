==Synopsis==
Billy Coleman rescues a Redbone Coonhound from attack by another neighborhood dog. He takes it home with him so that its wounds can heal. In light of this event, he has a flashback to when he was ten living in the Ozark mountains with his two Redbone Coonhounds, Old Dan and Little Ann. Growing up in the Ozarks with his parents, Will and Jenny, and two younger sisters, Sarah and Alice, he wants to own a pair of Redbone Coonhounds but his parents tell him that they can't afford them. One day he finds an article in a sportsman magazine offering a pair in Kentucky for $25 each. He decides to earn the money himself. For two years, he works many different jobs, and manages to save $50. His grandfather writes to the kennel and finds out that the dogs have dropped in price by $5 each. He sends for two Redbone Coonhound puppies.

==Differences between the film and the novel==
While the novel and [[1974]] film version depict Billy to have long blond hair, he has dark brown hair in the [[2003]] film.

The novel depicted the raccoon hunting competition to last about six nights, whereas the two film versions place it at four nights.

In the novel and 1974 film version, Billy, Old Dan, Little Ann, and Rubin and Rainie Pritchard hunt for the legendary ghost raccoon at night, but in the 2003 film, they do so at day. Also, the 2003 film and the novel placed their betted money at five dollars, while the 1974 film placed it at two dollars.

In the 2003 film, when Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann encounter the mountain lion, Billy and Little Ann chase it away after it fatally injures Old Dan. In the novel and 1974 film version, Billy kills it with his axe to save Old Dan.
