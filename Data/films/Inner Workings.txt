==Summary==
“''This is the story of the internal struggle between a [[Paul (Inner Workings)|man]]’s Brain—a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart—a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.''”

==Plot==
A man named [[Paul (Inner Workings)|Paul]] has two sides of personality: his pragmatic [[Brain (Inner Workings)|brain]] and his spontaneous [[Heart (Inner Workings)|heart]]. He then leaves his house to go to work, but suddenly becomes distracted upon seeing a couple eating pancakes. Unsure of what to follow, he keeps listening to his pragmatic brain much to the heart telling him to join in the fun. After passing by a [[Kate (Inner Workings)|sunglasses vendor]], Paul's heart and brain have an argument on his way to the office.

Paul suddenly works at his office but does not feel like going in sync with the other colleagues much to his pragmatic brain prompting him to continue going in sync with them. Paul's brain also ends up becoming more miserable, just like one of the colleagues sitting next to him. Paul's brain and heart suddenly get along during lunchtime as he decides to become more spontaneous in the things he did not want to do at first such as café breakfast, trying in a pair of sunglasses from the vendor, and getting into the water, making him relieved.

Paul suddenly goes back to his office and feels the rhythm by typing on his keyboard where he and the other colleagues dance together, along with the three senior members he met outside his office as the short's signature song "[[California Loco]]" plays throughout the credits.

==Trivia==
*This short is an homage to the Disney shorts: ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' and ''[[Cranium Command]]''.
*The third [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] short film to be produced in a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, after ''[[Get a Horse!]]'' and ''[[Feast]]''.
*This was the last non-franchise [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] short film to be released in theaters worldwide, due to [[Disney+]] launching their own series of shorts simply titled ''[[Short Circuit]]'', until 2021's ''[[Us Again]]'', released with ''[[Raya and the Last Dragon]]''.
*Early concept art suggested that the short was originally going to take place entirely inside Boring, Boring & Glum with Paul's conflict coming from him being socially awkward and trying to woo his cubicle neighbor, a character who would morph into Kate.<ref>[https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-inner-workings Art of Inner Workings]</ref>
