'''''Pooh's Great School Bus Adventure''''' is an educational film based on ''[[Welcome to Pooh Corner]]''.

In the film, [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] and [[Piglet]] find that [[Christopher Robin]] has forgotten his lunch, so they decide to deliver it to him. However, none of the animals have ever ridden a school bus before, so the duo join [[Rabbit]], [[Tigger]] and [[Owl]] at the bus stop. There, they remember to demonstrate and discuss the rules and safety of riding the bus. Tigger gets so excited that he bumps into Owl and nearly runs onto the road until Piglet reminds him to stay back from the street. As everybody takes two steps back from the curve, [[Eeyore]] arrives and Rabbit reminds him that they should always be on time, so as not to miss the bus and get hurt trying to catch up with it. As the bus arrives, everybody sings a song about the importance of bus safety, before they all carefully hop aboard. 

In the bus, Owl remembers to tuck in his feet after Piglet almost trips over them, and Eeyore remembers to take his seat before the driver starts the vehicle. Pooh finds a feather which flies out of the window and takes out his honey pot for a snack. Piglet reminds him not to put any body parts out of the window or eat while the bus is moving. Pooh then accidentally drops Christopher Robin's lunch bag and out falls a toy school bus with a note. The note reveals that Christopher Robin had organized the entire thing so the animals could have a chance to ride the bus and that he made the toy for them. They arrive at school, but the animals wonder how they'll get home, given how they don't need to go to school. The driver offers to take them back to the Hundred Acre Wood where he'll be picking up more passengers nearby.

Back home, Tigger remembers to hold on the handrail while climbing out. Eeyore is found walking behind the bus, so he carefully catches up with the group. Everybody crosses the street, but not after Owl stops Rabbit from retrieving his carrot from under the bus wheel. The bus leaves and Pooh is sad, but Piglet and the others cheer him up, reminding him of their great adventure they never knew they were going to have. With Pooh now optimistic of another adventure on the way, the special ends as everybody reprises their song and continues practicing bus safety.
