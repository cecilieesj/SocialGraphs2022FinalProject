'''''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater''''' is a [[2007]] theatrical cartoon from [[Walt Disney Pictures]], directed by Kevin Deters and co-directed by Stevie Wermers-Skelton. This is the first theatrical Goofy solo cartoon short (other than a few educational films) made in 46 years, since ''[[Aquamania]]''. In the style of The Everyman cartoons of the 1950s, this short follows [[Goofy]] as he buys and then sets up his home theater system, to watch football.

==Production==
The short was partially produced using a new "paperless" production pipeline for Disney, the first major change in production technique for hand-drawn animation at Disney since the introduction of CAPS, and was also an attempt to see if the new digital animation tools could be used to produce a short with the same graphic look as that of a 1940s cartoon. Instead of animating with pencil on paper, some of the animators, such as [[Dale Baer]], worked on Wacom's Cintiq tablets along with Toon Boom Harmony for the animation, while other animators such as [[Mark Henn]] and [[Andreas Deja]] continued to work in the traditional method with pencil on paper. It was reported on Animation World Network that about 50% of the short was done in the new paperless technique. However, Disney's next hand-drawn animated feature ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' only used paperless animation, with the exception of the characters, which were still traditionally animated.

==Voice Cast==
*'''[[Corey Burton]]''' as Narrator
*'''[[Bill Farmer]]''' as [[Goofy]]

==Release==
The short was released with the Disney film ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' on December 21, 2007. It was also paired with ''[[The Game Plan]]'' for the film's release in the United Kingdom. The short was shown early at the "Animate with the Greats" class taking place at Facet's Theatre. Several Walt Disney Animation Studios animation artists taught the class, including Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers. It is also available for purchase on the iTunes Store. The three-minute ''[[Have a Laugh!]]'' version can be viewed on Disney's ''Have a Laugh!'' video page. Both versions of the cartoon were released on the first "have a laugh!" DVD release in October 2010. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2007. The short is also included in the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Film Collection Blu-ray/DVD that was released on August 18, 2015.

==Trivia==
*The two sports teams are called the Dawgs and the Geefs, both references to two of Goofy's alternate names over the years: Dippy Dawg (his earliest incarnation) and George Geef (his name from his 1950s "everyman" shorts).
*A fat cheering football fan resembles [[Pete]].
*When Goofy receives his home theater system, the box the system came in was branded "[[Dopey]] Digital" and has the SKU number [[Mickey Mouse|M1C-K3Y M0-U5E]].
*Before Goofy clears the top of a bookshelf to make room for one of his speakers, the items shown are a portrait of [[Walt Disney]], Goofy in his earliest incarnation with the 1932 cartoon ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', a caricature drawing of [[John Lasseter]], a picture of [[Clarabelle Cow]], and a gold statue of Goofy as a cherub.
*Goofy has a Mickey Mouse watch.
*Despite being made in 2007, long after Laserdiscs and VCRs had stopped being produced, the term "LD" is mentioned.
