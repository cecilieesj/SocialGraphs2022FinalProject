==Trivia==
* It's unknown how this was given out, but it was most likely given to viewers who subscribed to Disney Channel at the time.
* Some of the footage is especially made for the tape, although most of it is stock footage, such as the scenes taken from the Noise Day and Bear Day days.
* Clips from ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', ''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''The Adventures of Spot'', and ''Rolie Polie Olie'' are used when the respective shows are introduced.
