'''''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope''''', originally released as '''''Star Wars''''', is a [[1977]] film written and directed by [[George Lucas]]. It is the first part of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]] and the first Star Wars film released.

The film is set 19 [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] and the events of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]; construction has finished on the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], a weapon capable of destroying a [[planet]]. After [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], a leader of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], receives the weapon's plans in the hope of finding a weakness, she is kidnapped and taken to the Death Star. Meanwhile, a young [[Moisture farmer|farmer]] named [[Luke Skywalker]] meets [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who has lived in seclusion for years on the desert planet of [[Tatooine]]. When [[Lars Homestead|Luke's home]] is burned and his [[Beru Whitesun Lars|aunt]] and [[Owen Lars|uncle]] killed, Obi-Wan begins Luke's [[Jedi]] [[Jedi training|training]] as they—along with [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]] attempt to rescue the princess from the Empire.

Inspired by films like the [[Wikipedia:Flash Gordon (serial)|''Flash Gordon'']] [[Wikipedia:Movie serial|serials]] and the [[Wikipedia:Samurai|samurai]] films of [[Wikipedia:Akira Kurosawa|Akira Kurosawa]], as well as such critical works as [[Wikipedia:Joseph Campbell|Joseph Campbell's]] [[Wikipedia:The Hero with a Thousand Faces|''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'']] and Frank Herbert's [[Wikipedia:Dune (franchise)|''Dune'']] books, Lucas began work on ''Star Wars'' in 1974. Ground-breaking in its use of [[Wikipedia:Special effect|special effects]], this is considered to be among the most successful—and most influential—films of all time. Produced with a budget of [[Wikipedia:US$|US$]]11,000,000 and released on [[May 25]], 1977, the film became one of the most successful of all time, earning $215 million in the [[Wikipedia:United States|United States]] and $337 million overseas during its original theatrical release, as well as winning several film awards, including 10 [[Wikipedia:Academy Award|Academy Award]] nominations. It was re-released several times, sometimes with [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|significant changes]]; the most notable versions were the 1997 [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]] and the 2004 [[Wikipedia:DVD|DVD]], which were modified with [[Wikipedia:Computer generated imagery|CGI]] effects and recreated scenes. It was re-released in the Blu-ray format in [[September]] of [[2011]]. The film was selected to be preserved by the [[Wikipedia:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] as part of its [[Wikipedia:National Film Registry|National Film Registry]]. The film was selected in 1989, the program's first year in existence.

==Synopsis==
===[[Secret mission to Tatooine|Assault on ''Tantive IV'']]===
19 [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] and the events of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']], [[the galaxy]] is in a state of [[Galactic Civil War|civil war]]. The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] has won their first major victory by [[Battle of Scarif|stealing]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the Galactic Empire's secret weapon, the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. Hoping that the stolen plans can save her [[Alderaanian|people]] and restore freedom to the galaxy, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who is in custody of the plans, attempts to race home aboard the ''[[Tantive IV]]''. However, her ship is intercepted by the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial'' ''I''-class]] [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]'' over the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]].

[[File:Devastatortantiveiv.png|thumb|left|250px|Princess Leia is kidnapped by the Galactic Empire.]]
The ship is captured, and several Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s come aboard. After defeating the small number of [[Rebel trooper|guards]] defending the ship, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrives to assess the damage. Vader is outraged and questions [[Raymus Antilles|Captain Antilles]], whom he eventually strangles and kills. Hiding on the ship, Princess Leia is able to record a [[Hologram|holographic]] message with the help of [[R2-D2]], and gives the [[droid]] the plans for the Death Star and the responsibility of taking the message to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], a Jedi-in-hiding on Tatooine. Leia is spotted by stormtroopers and they shoot her with a stun blast and bring her before Vader. Leia claims she and the ship's crew were on a diplomatic mission to [[Alderaan]], but is disbelieved by Vader, who denounces her as a traitor and has her taken prisoner. Vader orders a message be sent to the [[Imperial Senate]], informing them that the ship was destroyed, with everyone on board killed. R2-D2 and [[C-3PO]] use an escape pod in order to escape the ship and reach the planet of Tatooine below.

===Luke's destiny===
[[File:Lukesaberanh.png|thumb|right|250px|Luke Skywalker receives his father's lightsaber.]]
{{Quote|There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.|Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Episode" />}}
After arguing and going their separate ways for a while, the droids are individually picked up by [[Jawa]] traders and brought aboard a [[Sandcrawler]]. They are later bought by moisture farmer [[Owen Lars]] and his nephew, [[Luke Skywalker]], a young farmer who lost his parents as a baby and hopes to one day be a starfighter pilot just like his friends. While cleaning R2, Luke discovers the hologram, at the mention of Obi Wan, he wonders if she means his neighbor Ben Kenobi.

While eating dinner with Owen and his Aunt [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]], Owen asks Luke to take R2 to [[Anchorhead]] the next day to have his memory wiped, and expresses his hope Luke will stay with them for one more harvest season before sending his application to the [[Imperial Academy|Academy]]. R2 escapes from the Lars' homestead in search of Obi-Wan, whom the droid claims to be the property of. Luke and C-3PO search the desert and find R2 the next day, only to be attacked by [[Tusken Raider|Sand people]]. Luke and his droids are rescued by Ben Kenobi, who confirms he is Obi-Wan.

At his home, Obi-Wan gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]], as Obi-Wan recalls his own friendship with Luke's father. He tells Luke that he and his father were a part of the [[Jedi]] order that once protected the galaxy before the Empire took over and that Darth Vader was once his apprentice before he fell to the [[dark side of the Force]] and murdered Luke's father. After viewing Princess Leia's message carried by R2-D2, Obi-Wan attempts to persuade Luke to accompany him to Alderaan. Luke refuses to go until the group discovers the remains of the Sandcrawler, the Jawas having been killed by stormtroopers searching for the droids. Realizing this, Luke hurries home only to find his aunt and uncle's charred remains, having been brutally murdered by the same stormtroopers.

Luke returns upset, but Obi-Wan tells him there was nothing he could do, and that he would have been killed too and the plans would be in possession of the Empire. With nothing keeping him on Tatooine, Luke, Obi Wan and the two droids travel to [[Mos Eisley]] to find passage to Alderaan, Princess Leia's home planet.

Aboad the Death Star, [[Cassio Tagge]] argues with [[Conan Antonio Motti]] about the stations vulnerability to the rebels and points out that the rebellion has been gaining support within the imperial senate. [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] enters the room with Darth Vader and informs them that the [[Emperor]] has dissolved the senate completely, sweeping away the last remnant of the Old Republic. Believing fear will keep the galaxy in line, Motti boasts the power of the Death Star, to which Vader replies that its power is insignificant compared to [[the Force]]. When Motti mocks Vader's belief in the Force, Vader [[Force choke|Force chokes]] him until Tarkin orders him to stop, and expresses his own desire to crush the Rebellion.

Back in Mos Eisley, Luke, Obi-Wan and the Droids run into a patrol of stormtroopers, who ask for their identification. Obi-Wan uses a [[Mind trick|Jedi Mind trick]] on the lead trooper, who lets them pass. Arriving at [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], the group hires [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and his [[First Mate]], a [[Wookiee]] named [[Chewbacca]], for 17,000 [[credit]]s, 2,000 in advance and 15,000 upon arrival, to take the four of them to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. After Han has a brief run-in with [[Greedo]] over his debts to crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba The Hutt]], which ends with Han fatally shooting Greedo, they make it to the Falcon's hanger. A brief scuffle with stormtroopers and henchmen sent by Jabba ensues, and the ''Falcon'' escapes Imperial Star-Destroyers over Tatooine and sets a course to Alderaan, unaware that the Death Star has just arrived there as well.

===Rescue of the princess===
{{Quote|Here's where the fun begins!|Han Solo|<ref name="Episode" />}}
Leia, having resisted being tortured with a [[Mind probe]] for the location of the Rebel Alliance's headquarters, is brought before Grand Moff Tarkin. Tarkin threatens to use the Death Star's [[Superlaser]] on Leia's [[Homeworld]] of Alderaan if she does not tell them the Rebel base's location. She reluctantly tells them the base is on [[Dantooine]], but Tarkin orders Alderaan to be destroyed anyway for its role in supporting the rebels.

Aboard the Millennium Falcon, Obi-Wan feels a great disturbance in the Force while Luke undergoes Lightsaber training with a [[Marksman-H training remote|training remote]]. Upon dropping out of [[Hyperspace]], they find what seems to be an [[Alderaanian Graveyard|asteroid field]] in Alderaan's place. The ''Millennium Falcon'' is then pulled aboard the Death Star by its powerful [[tractor beam]].

[[File:Got_A_Bad_feeling.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Heroes en route to the Death Star]]
Tarkin and Vader discover that Leia lied about the Rebel bases location when their forces only discover the ruins of a base on Dantooine. Tarkin orders her to be executed.

Having docked with the Death Star, Solo and the others ambush two stormtroopers and the Imperial scanning crew sent to investigate the Falcon by hiding in hidden smuggling compartments. With Han and Luke now disguised as the two stormtroopers, the group storms a control room to figure out how to escape. Obi-Wan separates from the group to disable the tractor beam, leaving the others alone. While connected to the Imperial Network, R2-D2 discovers Princess Leia is aboard the station and is set for termination. Luke convinces Han and Chewbacca to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue her]] with the vague promise of a grand reward. Han and Chewbacca reluctantly agree. Luke plans to march into [[Detention Block AA-23]], claiming that Chewbacca is part of a prisoner transfer. C-3PO and R2-D2 are instructed to remain behind, and the trio sets off on their rescue attempt. Upon being met with suspicion, they are quick to subdue the officers and guards in the princess's cell block. Luke frees Leia from her cell, but the group are pinned down by a squad of stormtroopers. Leia takes charge, blasting a hole in a nearby grate and jumping through while Chewbacca, Luke and Han all dive after the princess.

The chute ends up leading to a [[garbage compactor]] that is also home to a [[Omi|resident]] [[dianoga]]. Soon after landing, the creature pulls Luke under the surface, but releases him and is scared away when the Imperials realize where the heroes escaped to and activate the compactor. As the walls close in on the foursome, Luke desperately calls to C-3PO over his comlink asking for the compactor to be shut down. Leia struggles to get to the top and Chewbacca tries to unlock the door. R2-D2 manages to shut down the compactor just in time, although, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the comlink, C-3PO is briefly convinced that his master and friends have been crushed.

After escaping from the trash compactor, the group hurries back to the ''Millennium Falcon,'' hoping that Obi-Wan has successfully shut down the tractor beam. Leia and Han bicker about who is in charge of the mission, while Han muses no reward is worth dealing with Leia's scathing criticism. Luke and Leia briefly become separated from Han and Chewie when Han chases after a group of stormtroopers, only to run into a whole battalion and be chased by them instead. Luke and Leia nearly run into a large chasm and are forced to swing across with a [[Grappling hook]] amongst blaster fire, with Leia giving Luke a brief kiss "for luck". The group soon rejoins and makes there way back to the Falcon.

===Sacrifice and victory===
[[File:Obiwanvaderanhduel.png|thumb|right|250px|"You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."]]
{{Quote|This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi. It will soon see the end of the Rebellion.|Darth Vader|<ref name="Episode" />}}
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan, remaining completely undetected, shuts down the tractor beam. Vader, however, had sensed his presence through the Force, and, while Obi-Wan makes his way to the Falcon, confronts his old master and engages him in a lightsaber duel. Luke and the others make it back to the Falcon, where Luke and several stormtroopers witness the battle. Sparing one last glance at Luke, Obi-Wan allows himself to be struck down by Vader, thus becoming one with the Force and allowing Luke and the others to escape. Horrified and angered at having witnessed Obi-Wan's demise at the hands of Vader, Luke and the others are forced to flee on the ''Millennium Falcon'' under a hail of blaster fire from the stormtroopers.

Still mourning Obi-Wan's death, Luke helps Solo fend off a squadron of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. Despite their supposed victory, Leia correctly believes the empire let them go in order to track them to the rebel base. The crew of the Falcon finally meets the Rebel Alliance on the moon of [[Yavin 4|Yavin-4]], and the information in R2-D2 is turned over to them. [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna|Dodonna]] plans the attack on the Death Star, as the plans reveal a weakness in the Death Stars design in the form of a thermal exhaust port leading to the station's reactor. Believing a direct hit with [[Proton torpedo|Proton torpedos]] will cause a chain reaction that will destroy the station, Dodanna tells the pilots to man their ships in preparation for the battle. To Luke's dismay, Han leaves after receiving his reward to settle his debts.

[[File:Battle_of_Yavin.png|thumb|left|250px|Rebel fighters approach the Death Star.]]
The Rebel strike force begins its attack on the Death Star, as the space station approaches Yavin-4. A group of [[X-wing starfighter|X-wing]], and [[BTL Y-wing starfighter|Y-wing starfighters]], Luke among them, assault a trench on the Death Star's surface to hit the station's vulnerable spot before it can destroy the Alliance's base. During this, most of the Rebel craft, including Luke's friend [[Biggs Darklighter]], are picked off by a group of Imperial fighters led by Darth Vader. Tarkin is told by an imperial officer that the Rebels do pose a danger, but Tarkin refuses to evacuate in their supposed moment of triumph. With the Death Star only minutes from being in range to destroy Yavin-4, Luke makes one last run down the trench toward the exhaust port. Just as Vader opens fire on Luke from his personal [[TIE Advanced x1|TIE Advanced]] fighter, Han returns in the ''Millennium Falcon'' and attacks the Imperials, resulting in Vader's ship getting knocked out of the trench. Luke, aided by the voice of Kenobi and guided by the Force, accurately fires two proton torpedoes into the exhaust port, and the battle station explodes, killing Tarkin and everyone on board, while Vader escapes into space.

The few remaining ships (those of [[Wedge Antilles]], Luke, Han, and a [[Evaan Verlaine|Y-wing Pilot]]) return to Yavin 4 and a [[Royal Award Ceremony|victory ceremony]] commences, where [[Medal of Bravery|medals]] are presented to the heroes, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, by Princess Leia, as the rebels give them a standing ovation.

==Development==
===Conception===
During post-production on his previous film, [[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|''American Graffiti'']], Lucas repeatedly discussed the concept of a "[[Wikipedia:Space opera|space opera]]" with producer [[Gary Kurtz]]. In January 1973 Lucas began work on this, and by May had prepared a 14-page story outline for distribution among film studios.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams">''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''</ref> He had originally envisioned the film as being a continuation of both ''American Graffiti'' and [[Wikipedia:Apocalypse Now|''Apocalypse Now'']] (the latter of which he helped make before [[Wikipedia:Warner Bros. Studios|Warner Bros. Studios]] shut down his studio of [[Wikipedia:American Zoetrope|American Zoetrope]] and thus forced him to hand over development to his compatriot, Francis Ford Coppola). His note for the basic plotline for the film, which was intended to be a response to the Vietnam War era, was that it involved "[[Wikipedia:United States of America|a technological empire]] going after [[Wikipedia:Viet Cong|a small band of freedom fighters]]."<ref name="New York Post">{{Cite_web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/21/how-star-wars-was-secretly-george-lucas-protest-of-vietnam|title=How 'Star Wars' was secretly George Lucas' Vietnam protest|author=Smith, Kyle|date=2014-10-21|work=[[Wikiepedia:New York Post|New York Post]]|archivedate=20180826122931}}</ref><ref name="How Star Wars Conquered the Universe">{{BookCite|author=Taylor, Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|publisher=[[Wikipedia:Basic Books|Basic Books]]|date=2014|isbn=9780465089987}}</ref> According to Walter Murch, a former associate of Lucas when the latter was filming ''Apocalypse Now'', the space opera setting was conceived in large part because, due to the Vietnam War still going on, the audiences would not have been receptive to a direct attack on American involvement in Vietnam.<ref name="Metaphor">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.yomyomf.com/star-wars-is-a-metaphor-for-the-vietcong-kicking-american-ass-in-the-vietnam-war|title='Star Wars' is a Metaphor for the Vietcong Kicking American Ass in the Vietnam War?|author=Philip|date=2015-12-16|work=[[Wikipedia:YOMYOMF|YOMYOMF]]|archivedate=20160610224959|nolive=1}}</ref><ref name="Walter Murch">{{BookCite|author=Murch, Walter; Ondaatje, Michael|title=The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film|publisher=[[Wikipedia:Alfred A.

Lucas later proposed that terms like "space fantasy" or "science fantasy" better fit the story.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> He brought the outline to [[Wikipedia:Universal Studios|Universal Studios]] and [[Wikipedia:United Artists|United Artists]]; both rejected the project (the former refused directly, while the latter withheld their answer until after the 10 day wait period ended).<ref name="New York Post" /><ref name="KurtzIGN1">{{Cite_web|last=Kurtz|first=Gary|title=An Interview with Gary Kurtz|date=2002-11-11|page=1|website=IGN|url=https://ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/an-interview-with-gary-kurtz?page=1 |access-date=May 11, 2014|archivedate=20140513100038|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="How Star Wars Conquered the Universe" /> He also turned to [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], though they also turned him down.<ref name="New York Post" /><ref name="How Star Wars Conquered the Universe" /> Lucas disliked the studio system because his previous two films, ''American Graffiti'' and [[1138 (easter egg)|''THX 1138'']], had been re-edited without his consent.<ref name="Wired">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/05/lucas-2|title=Life After Darth|author=Silberman, Steve|date=2005-05-01|work=[[Wikipedia:Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']]|archivedate=20181121214346}}</ref> Still, aware that studios were unavoidable, he pursued [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], the head of [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]]. Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in me, [but] he did not invest in the movie."<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

===Production===
Lucas finished a draft of the screenplay in May 1974. As the draft developed, the characters evolved significantly. Early in development, Luke Skywalker's character changed from a 60-year-old general to a member of a family of [[Wikipedia:Dwarf|dwarfs]];<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name="Characters">''[[The Characters of Star Wars]]''</ref> the [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] smuggler, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], was envisioned as a large, green-skinned monster with gills.<ref name="Characters" /> [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] was inspired by Lucas' [[Wikipedia:Alaskan malamute|Alaskan malamute]] dog, [[Indiana]], who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.<ref name="Characters" /> The Force, a mysterious energy field, was initially conceived as the [[Kyber crystal]], a "galactic holy grail."<ref name="Genesis">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.lofficier.com/starwars.htm|title=The Star Wars Genesis: How the Classic SF Saga Evolved|author=Lofficier, Randy; Lofficier, Jean-Marc|date=1999|work=[https://www.lofficier.com lofficier.com]|archivedate=20200716191436}}</ref><ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> The completed script was too long for one movie; however, Lucas refused to condense it. Instead, he expanded the first third of it into one movie and left the rest for two future films, effectively creating the [[Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].<ref name="Maker">{{SWArchive|url=community/event/celebration/f20050419/indexp17.html|text=Thank the Maker: George Lucas|archivedate=20050423225452}}</ref><ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite_web|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|date=2010|title=The Lost Star Wars Stories: Episodes X-XII|url=http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/loststarwarsstories.html|website=The Secret History of Star Wars|archivedate=20201111175900|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lucas hired conceptual artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]] to create paintings of certain scenes during screenwriting. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.<ref name="McQuarrie">{{SWArchive|url=bio/ralphmcquarrie.html|text=Star Wars Biography: Ralph McQuarrie|archivedate=20040618190127}}</ref> 20th Century Fox approved a budget of $8,250,000; ''American Graffiti''{{'s}} positive reviews allowed Lucas to renegotiate his deal with Alan Ladd, Jr. and request the sequel rights to the film.

In 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on ''Star Wars'' in a warehouse in [[Wikipedia:Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys, California]]. Most of the visual effects used [[Wikipedia:Motion control photography|motion control photography]], which creates the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras. Model spaceships were constructed on the basis of drawings by [[Joe Johnston]], input from Lucas, and paintings by McQuarrie. Lucas opted to abandon the traditional sleekness of science fiction by creating a "used universe" in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name="Legacy">''[[The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars]]''</ref><ref name="ILM Bio">{{SWArchive|url=bio/industriallightmagic.html|text=Star Wars Biography: Industrial Light & Magic|archivedate=20010417114402}}</ref>

Lucas clashed with [[Wikipedia:Director of Photography|Director of Photography]] [[Gilbert Taylor]], whom producer Gary Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety."<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name="Taylor3">{{Cite_web|last=Williams|first=David E.|title=Gilbert Taylor, BSC is given the spotlight with the ASC's International Achievement Award|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/feb06/taylor/page3.html|date=2006-02|page=3|archivedate=20130826032800|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, with a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His camera suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor, who felt that Lucas was over-stepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions. Lucas eventually became frustrated that the costumes, sets and other elements were not living up to his original vision of ''Star Wars''. He rarely spoke to the actors, who felt that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words "faster" and "more intense."<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from [[Wikipedia:Board of directors|board]] members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. After production fell two weeks behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas that he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. The crew split into three units, led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor [[Robert Watts]], respectively. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name="Heritage" /> ILM concluded shooting on [[April 22]], 1977 with shot 110P, that of a Star Destroyer.<ref name="swi95">[[Star Wars Insider 95|''Star Wars Insider'' 95]]</ref>

''Star Wars'' was originally slated for release in [[Wikipedia:Christmas|Christmas]] 1976; however, delays pushed the film's release to summer 1977. Already anxious about meeting his deadline, Lucas was shocked when his editor's first cut of the film was a "complete disaster." After attempting to persuade the original editor to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced the editor with [[Paul Hirsch]] and [[Richard Chew]]. He also allowed his then-wife [[Marcia Lucas]] to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film [[Wikipedia:New York, New York (film)|''New York, New York'']] with Lucas' friend [[Wikipedia:Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese]]. Richard Chew found the film had an non-energetic pace; it had been cut in a by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in [[Wikipedia:Master shot|master shots]] that flowed into [[Wikipedia:Close-up|close-up]] coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously; whoever finished first moved on to the next.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name="Heritage" /> [[Wikipedia:Post-production|Post-production]] was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, [[Mark Hamill]]'s face was injured in a car accident, which made reshoots impossible.<ref name="Heritage" />

Meanwhile, ILM was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.<ref name="Heritage" /> Moreover, theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline, forcing Lucas to intervene frequently to ensure that they were on schedule.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial [[Starfighter combat/Legends|dogfights]] from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

During the chaos of production and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and [[Wikipedia:Sound effect|sound effects]]. Sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an "organic soundtrack." For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering his voice through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a [[Wikipedia:Scuba set|scuba]] tank implanted with a microphone.<ref name="Silicon">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/burtt/index.html|title=Ben Burtt|author=Papageorge, John|work=Silicon Valley Radio|archivedate=19970624121226|nolive=1}}</ref> Lucas never intended to use the voice of [[David Prowse]], who portrayed Darth Vader in costume, because of Prowse's thick English [[Wikipedia:West Country|West Country]] accent. He originally wanted [[Wikipedia:Orson Welles|Orson Welles]] to speak for Darth Vader. However, he felt that Welles' voice would be too recognizable, so he cast the lesser-known [[James Earl Jones]].<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.premiere.com/features/2164/the-force-wasnt-with-them.html|title=The Force Wasn't With Them|author=Russo, Tom|work=[[Wikipedia:Premiere (magazine)|''Premiere'']]|archivedate=20071106045549}}</ref> Nor did Lucas intend to use Anthony Daniels' voice for C-3PO. Thirty well-established voice actors, such as [[Wikipedia:Stan Freberg|Stan Freberg]], read for the voice of the droid. According to Daniels, one of the major voice actors recommended Daniels' voice for the role.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /><ref name="Characters" />

When Lucas screened an early cut of the film for his friends, among them directors [[Brian De Palma]], [[Wikipedia:John Milius|John Milius]] and [[Steven Spielberg]], their reactions were disappointing. Spielberg, who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film,<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Alan Ladd, Jr. and the rest of 20th Century Fox loved the film; one of the executives, Gareth Wigan, told Lucas, "This is the greatest film I've ever seen," and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> Although the delays increased the budget from $8 million to $11 million, the film was still the least expensive of the ''Star Wars'' saga.

===Music===
From the very beginning, Lucas' intention for "Star Wars" was that it would have very familiar sounding music, that despite the extraordinary visuals and events occurring onscreen, the music would be reminiscent of Earth and of the past. To that end, he originally wanted to fill the film with tracked classical music from various composers, in a similar fashion to 2001: A Space Odyssey.<ref name="FSM 1.97 MM article">{{BookCite|author=Matessino, Michael|container=Return of the Trilogy|title=Film Score Monthly|number=vol. 2, no. 1|publisher=Lukas Kendall|date=January 1997|issn=1077-4289}}</ref> Lucas' friend, Steven Spielberg, recommended composer John Williams to Lucas after their recent collaboration on Jaws (1975). Spielberg convinced Lucas that he should meet with the composer, who in turn convinced him of the need for original music.<ref name="new yorker john williams interview">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-force-is-still-strong-with-john-williams|title=The Force is Still Strong With John Williams|author=Reed, Alex|date=2020-07-21|work=[[Wikipedia:The New Yorker|''The New Yorker'']]|archivedate=20200930080836}}</ref> They also decided in this early meeting that the score should have a romantic musical sound, with leitmotifs for different characters and events, similar to the operas of Richard Wagner.<ref name="1997 liner notes">Liner notes of the 1997 Special Edition soundtrack release, notes written by Michael Matessino</ref>

Rough cuts of "Star Wars" used something called a "temp score", referring to musical material that was there to find a rhythm while editing but would not be kept in the final cut as it would be replaced by the final score. These temp tracks would help to inspire the direction John Williams was to take with his score as he began writing it.<ref name="1977 liner notes">Liner notes of the 1977 LP soundtrack release, notes written by Charles Lippincott</ref> Most of the temp tracks are not public knowledge, but some information has been revealed over the years. In one interview, editor Paul Hirsch confirmed that a cue from Bernard Herrmann's Psycho score containing the famous "3-note motif" was used to temp the scene where the heroes exit the smuggling chambers of the Millennium Falcon.<ref name="The Making of Psycho">The Making of Psycho (1997) - Laurent Bouzereau</ref> In another interview, Hirsch revealed that the opening to "The Sacrifice" from Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" was used to temp the scene in the desert, the Jawa scenes were temped from other parts of the same piece, and the Main Title crawl was temped with the overture of Ivanhoe by Miklós Rózsa.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars book">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref> Later, in his own book, Hirsch would claim that the Main Title crawl was temped with Erich Korngold's theme to the 1938 Robin Hood. It is unknown which of these claims is correct. Also in his book, Hirsch mentions that the Cantina scene was tracked by Benny Goodman's "Avalon" from his Carnegie Hall performance, some of the early battle footage was tracked with "Dance of the Adolescents" from "The Rite of Spring", and the approach to the Death Star was temped with the music from the approach to Kong Island from Max Steiner's King Kong score.<ref name="Paul Hirsch book">{{BookCite|author=Hirsch, Paul|title=A Long Time Ago in a Cutting Room Far, Far Away|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=2019-11-05|isbn=9781641602556}}</ref> In an interview, sound editor Ben Burtt said that Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony was temped into the medal ceremony (Hirsch mentioned this in his book too), and parts of Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony were temped as Luke's theme.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars book" /> Homages to many of these known temp tracks appear in the final score. For example, the cue [1m5-2m1] Desert Song from Star Wars is extremely similar to the opening of the Stravinsky piece it was temped with. Further, the music in [1m2] Main Title that plays when the underbelly of the Star Destroyer flies over the camera is very similar to the ending of "Mars - The Bringer of War" from Holsts' "The Planets". Even the 3-note motif from Psycho appears in the very opening of the Star Wars cue [7m1-7m2 New] The Hatch Opens, exactly where the temp track would have been.

On January 10th, 1977, Williams was invited to the spotting sessions, where he watched a rough cut of the film with Lucas, music supervisor Lionel Newman, music editor Ken Wannberg, producer Gary Kurtz, and film editor Paul Hirsch.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars book" /><ref name="Paul Hirsch book" /><ref name="Paul Duncan tweet">{{Twitter|kersched|status/1480583805547298821|[[Paul Duncan]]|archivedate=20220619200801}}</ref> Over the next several weeks, he would get to work writing the score. The way Williams wrote his score, he began by creating all the various leitmotifs and character themes (such as "[[Star Wars Main Title|Luke's Theme]]", "[[Princess Leia's Theme|Leia's theme]]", and "[[The Force Theme|Ben's theme]]", the "[[Jawa Sandcrawler|Jawa theme]]", the "[[Rebel Fanfare]]", and the "[[Imperial motif]]"). He then went on to create the actual score by stringing all the themes he created together in a way that would match up with what was happening on screen.<ref name="Films and Filming JW interview">{{BookCite|author=Elley, Derek|container=The Film Composer: 3. John Williams|title=Films and Filming|number=vol. 24|date=July 1978}}</ref> It's unknown exactly how long John Williams spent writing the score, but it is certain that he would have had at the absolute most no more than 8 weeks, given that they started recording on March 5th. This is unrealistic because there needed to have been time for the orchestrators to write out all the various parts for the players, so it is more likely that the score was completed in 7 weeks or less.

As with any creative process, parts of the score went through multiple revisions. One well-known example is the cue "Lost R2", which scores the famous "binary sunset" scene. This scene was originally scored with a very different sounding piece that contained "Luke's theme". When Lucas heard the cue, he asked if it could be rescored with "Ben's theme" because he felt it fit the scene better.<ref name="1977 liner notes" /> It can be argued that this opened the door for "Ben's theme" to be recontextualized into what we think of today as the "Force theme". Another interesting example of the score changing was the cue "A Home Destroyed". When this cue was written, it was designed to score the end of Ben's house, Leia's torture, the discovery of the attacked sandcrawler, and Luke returning home to find his guardians dead and his home burned. While Williams was writing the score, the film was re-edited so that the board room scene would occur where the torture scene used to be. This caused the cue to be split in half. The first 14 bars were recorded by themselves with a newly written ending featuring the "Death Star theme" for the transition to the boardroom scene. Then a second cue was recorded, being made up of bars 31-71 (attacked sandcrawler and burned homestead scenes) and bars 17-30 (Leia torture scene), with some new transition material written to join them.<ref name="jwfan comment explaining A Home Destroyed">Jay's comment explaining A Home Destroyed: {{Cite_web|url=https://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/34155-my-star-wars-soundtrack-tracklists-ot/&do=findComment&comment=1836621|title=My Star Wars soundtrack tracklists (OT)|date=2021-09-30|work=[https://www.jwfan.com John Williams Fan Network]|archivedate=20220619202343}}</ref> This isn't the only time editing of the film would require changes to the score, but it is one of the only examples where a re-edit resulted in the score being changed before it was recorded. The rest of the edits were done too late, and the remaining score changes were left to be made artificially by Ken Wannberg.<ref name="Paul Hirsch book" /> After the writing of the score was completed, the orchestrations were performed by lead orchestrator Herbert Spencer, who was assisted by Arthur Morton, Angela Morley, Al Woodbury, Alexander Courage and Williams himself.<ref name="Films and Filming JW interview" />

Note: Despite Williams claiming in an interview that Alexander Courage and he himself had both orchestrated cues, neither of their names appear in an orchestrator credit on any of the leaked manuscripts. There are however still four cues where the orchestrator credit is unknown because the sheets haven't leaked yet: [1m2] Main Title, [3m2 New] Lost R2, "Cantina Band", and "Cantina Band #2".

When it came time to record the score, Williams was given no choice but to record in London, presumably due to budget constraints and the fact that most of the film was shot in England.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars book" /> He did have the choice of which orchestra he wanted to work with, and he ended up choosing the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) due to its primary conductor being his friend André Previn. This was historically significant, as it was the first time Williams ever got to work with an organized symphony orchestra for a film.<ref name="1977 liner notes" /> Previous films of his usually recorded with freelance players. The score was recorded over the course of eight days between March 5th and March 16th of 1977 at Anvil Recording Studios in Denham, England.<ref name="1997 liner notes" /><ref name="1977 liner notes" /> People present at the sessions included John Williams himself, who was conducting, George Lucas, recording engineer Eric Tomlinson, his assistant Alan Snelling, and music editor Ken Wannberg. The orchestra itself was made up of 26 violins, 10 violas, 10 cellos, 6 basses, 11 woodwinds, 8 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, 2 tubas, 2 harps, 3 percussion, 1 timpani, 1 piano, and 1 celeste.<ref name="Gerhardt liner notes">Liner notes of the 1978 Gerhardt rerecording, notes written by Charles Gerhardt</ref> The score was recorded with approximately 23 microphones, placed at strategic positions around the orchestra. The mixing console, a Rupert Neve, had 24 inputs and 16 outputs. Recording engineer Eric Tomlinson used the console to create a live LCR (Left, Center, Right) mix while the orchestra was playing. The live mixes were recorded straight to two 35mm magnetic film recorders (with healthy Dolby A noise reduction applied). The live mix was also routed to tracks 1-3 of a Struder A80 16-track 2 inch recorder, with sections of the orchestra isolated on tracks 4-15 and a 50 hz pilot tone on track 16. The pilot tone could later be used for synchronization with the film during editing.<ref name="Chris Malone document">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.malonedigital.com/starwars.pdf|title=Recording the Star Wars Saga|author=Malone, Chris|date=2012-03-18|work=[https://www.malonedigital.com Malone Digital]|format=PDF|archivedate=20220619203126}}</ref><ref name="Alan Snelling interview">{{Blogspot|blogspoturl=underscorepodcast|url=2018/11/interview-alan-snelling.html|blogspotname=UnderScore|postname=Interview: Alan Senlling|archivedate=20220619223720}}</ref> After the recording was completed, the best takes were combined into performance edits by music editor Ken Wannberg. He created performance edits using one of the 35mm mag recordings, as well as with the 16 track tapes. (note: a performance edit is where sections of different takes are combined together to create the best possible recording of a given cue) The 16 track tapes were intended both for backup purposes, and to be sent off to be remixed by John Neal for the eventual soundtrack release on LP. The 35mm edits would of course be further edited by Wannberg into the final stems for use in the film.<ref name="Chris Malone document" /><ref name="1977 liner notes" /><ref name="jwfan comment about john neal auction">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/24113-some-john-williams-master-tapes-are-on-ebay-right-now|title=Some John Williams master tapes are on ebay right now....|author=Jay|date=2014-01-19|work=[https://www.jwfan.com John Williams Fan Network]|archivedate=20220619204007}}</ref>

====Releases====
The score to Star Wars has had several releases over the years. While many of these releases have been straight reissues of previous releases, there are currently four releases with unique programs that were independently mastered from the original session tapes:<ref name="explanation of releases">By comparing the credits for all releases from 1977 to present (7/1/22), we can conclude that the only teams that went back to the original masters were the OST (1977 - led by John Williams), Anthology (1993 - led by Ford A Thaxton), SE (1997 - led by Michael Mattessino), and Remastered (2018 - led by Shawn Murphy). Every other release is a reissue of one of these four</ref>
*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Original Soundtrack|1977 OST (20th Century Fox Records)]]
*[[Star Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack Anthology|1993 Anthology (Arista Records)]]
*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope Special Edition: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|1997 Special Edition (RCA Victor)]]
*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Remastered Soundtrack|2018 OST Remaster (Walt Disney Records)]]

===Sound===
''A New Hope'' was originally presented in monaural sound in many theaters, though the first-run [[Wikipedia:70mm film|70mm]] prints were some of the earliest wide-release examples of surround sound—something not seen in the commercial cinema since the [[Wikipedia:Cinerama|Cinerama]] and [[Wikipedia:Cinemascope|Cinemascope]] experiments of the early 1950s.

===Sources and inspirations===
The film drew inspiration from a number of sources. This was conscious and has been acknowledged by George Lucas in interviews. It is characteristic of much myth-building.

Lucas has stated that Akira Kurosawa's [[1950s|1958]] film ''The Hidden Fortress'' (USA release [[1960s|1962]]) was a strong influence. The resemblance between the two buffoon farmers in ''The Hidden Fortress'' and the two talkative droids in ''A New Hope'' is apparent. Indeed, when the droids find themselves alone on Tatooine, even the music and the style of "wipe" cuts are a clear homage to ''Hidden Fortress''. When [[Conan Antonio Motti/Legends|Motti]] is criticizing [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], he is about to mention the Rebels' "hidden fortress" before Vader cuts him off in the middle of the last word.

The climactic scene in which the Death Star is assaulted was modeled after (including some of the same dialogue) the 1950s film [[Wikipedia:The Dam Busters (movie)|''The Dam Busters'']], in which [[Wikipedia:Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Wikipedia:Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim "[[Wikipedia:Bouncing bomb|bouncing bombs]]" at German man-made dams in a bid to cripple the heavy industry of the [[Wikipedia:Ruhr|Ruhr]]. (''A New Hope'' cinematographer [[Wikipedia:Gilber Taylor|Gilbert Taylor]] had previously worked on the special-effects sequences for that film.)

Lucas has made mention of the film [[Wikipedia:633 Squadron|''633 Squadron'']] directed by [[Wikipedia:Walter Grauman|Walter Grauman]] when citing movies that inspired themes or elements in ''A New Hope''. The "trench run" in ''A New Hope'' wherein Luke flies his X-wing through a "trench" on the Death Star and destroys the ship was inspired, at least in small part, by the finale of 633 Squadron, which involves several Royal Air Force planes flying at low level up a fjord against heavy, ground-based anti-aircraft fire, to attack a factory located at the base of a cliff at the canyon's end.

==Release==
Wary that ''Star Wars'' would be beaten out by other summer films, such as [[Wikipedia:Smokey and the Bandit|''Smokey and the Bandit'']], 20th Century Fox moved the release date to Wednesday before [[Wikipedia:Memorial Day|Memorial Day]]: [[May 25]], [[1977]]. However, few theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, 20th Century Fox demanded that theaters order ''Star Wars'' if they wanted an eagerly anticipated film based on a best-selling novel titled [[Wikipedia:The Other Side of Midnight|''The Other Side of Midnight'']].<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> [[Wikipedia:The New York Times|''The New York Times'']] published the first advertisements for the film on [[May 15]], only ten days before its premiere.<ref name="Season 2 Directors">{{SWYoutube|u0Z7i0LnXOg|Mandalorian Season 2 Directors, We Celebrate a Birthday, and More!|archivedate=20200515034925}}</ref>

''Star Wars'' became an instant success upon release; within three weeks, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. Before 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37,000,000; in 1977, the company earned $79,000,000. Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Ladd became anxious during the premiere in [[Wikipedia:Japan|Japan]]. After the screening, the audience was silent, leading Ladd, Jr. to fear that the film would be unsuccessful. He was later told that, in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film. Meanwhile, thousands attended a ceremony at [[Wikipedia:Grauman's Chinese Theater|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], where C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

During the film's original theatrical run, there were a number of now-iconic television promotions:
*A re-creation of the cantina set for [[Wikipedia:The Richard Pryor Show|''The Richard Pryor Show'']] (September 13, 1977)
*''[[The Making of Star Wars]]'' TV special (September 16, 1977)
*A ''Star Wars''&ndash;themed [[Wikipedia:Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|''Donnie and Marie'']] episode (September 23, 1977)
*Mark Hamill on [[Wikipedia:Bob Hope television specials|''The Bob Hope All Star Christmas Comedy Special'']] (December 19, 1977)
*[[Wikipedia:Bill Murray|Bill Murray's]] "[[Wikipedia:Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1976–1977#Nick The Lounge Singer|Nick The Lounge Singer]]" singing the ''Star Wars'' Main Theme on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (January 28, 1978)
*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (November 17, 1978)<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/70starwars.html|title=Star Wars on TV|author=Hicks, L. Wayne|work=[http://www.tvparty.com TVparty!]|archivedate=20200513205029}}</ref>
*Carrie Fisher on ''Saturday Night Live'' (November 18, 1978)

===Merchandise===
[[Charles Lippincott]] was hired by Lucas' production company, [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]], as marketing director for ''Star Wars''. Because 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Marvel Comics]] for a comic book adaptation and with [[Del Rey]] Books for a novelization. Although ''Star Wars'' merchandise was available to enthusiastic children upon release, only [[Kenner Products|Kenner Toys]]—who believed that the film would be unsuccessful—had accepted Lippincott's licensing offers. Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its "empty box" Christmas campaign; these vouchers could be redeemed for [[Star Wars (toy line)|the toys]] in March 1978.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

The [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|novelization]] of the film was published in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been [[Wikipedia:Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by [[Alan Dean Foster]], who later wrote the first [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]''. The book was first published as ''Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker''; later editions were titled simply ''Star Wars'' and, later, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', to reflect the retitling of the film. Certain scenes deleted from the film (and later restored or archived in DVD bonus features) were present in the novel, such as Luke at Tosche Station with Biggs and the encounter between Han and Jabba in Docking Bay 94. Other deleted scenes from the movie, such as a close-up of a stormtrooper riding on a [[Dewback/Legends|Dewback]], were included in a photo insert added to later printings of the book. Smaller details were also changed; for example, in the Death Star assault, Luke's callsign is Blue Five instead of Red Five as in the film. Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" />

A [[Star Wars (radio)|radio drama]] adaptation of the film was written by [[Brian Daley]], directed by [[John Madden]], and produced for and broadcast on the American [[National Public Radio]] network in 1981. The adaptation received cooperation from [[George Lucas]], who donated the rights to NPR. John Williams' music and Ben Burtt's sound design were retained for the show; Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) reprised their roles as well. The radio drama featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Darth Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia. In terms of [[Canon|''Star Wars'' canon]], the radio drama is given the highest designation, G-canon.<ref>{{Blog|holocron|4|What is the Holocron?|Keeper of the Holocron's Blog|Leland Chee|archivedate=20051122155636}}</ref>

Over the years, several comic adaptations of the film have been produced:

*[[Star Wars (Marvel Comics 1977)|Marvel Comics]] launched their Star Wars series with a six-part adaptation of the film written by [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[Howard Chaykin]].
*In 1978, [[Al Williamson]] worked on an adaptation in comic strip form that was never released.
*Concurrently with the release of the 1997 Special Edition, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a new [[Star Wars: A New Hope - The Special Edition|four-part adaptation]] written by [[Bruce Jones]] and illustrated by [[Eduardo Barreto]].
*A [[Star Wars Manga: A New Hope|manga adaptation]] illustrated by [[Hisao Tamaki]] was released in Japan in 1997 and in the United States in 1998.

===Re-releases===
The film was originally released as—and consequently often called—''Star Wars'', without ''Episode IV'' or the subtitle ''A New Hope''. The 1980 sequel, [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl.

{{Main|Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)}}
''A New Hope'' was released on [[Wikipedia:DVD|DVD]] on [[September 21]], [[2004]] in a box set with ''The Empire Strikes Back'', ''Return of the Jedi'', and a bonus disc of supplemental material. The movies were digitally restored and remastered, and [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#A New Hope 3|more changes were made]] by George Lucas.

The DVD features a commentary track from George Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher. The bonus disc contains the documentary ''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]'', three featurettes, teaser and theatrical trailers, TV spots, still galleries, an exclusive preview of ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'', a playable [[Wikipedia:Xbox|Xbox]] demo of the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', and a "Making Of" documentary on the [[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (video game)|''Episode III'' video game]]. The set was reissued in December 2005 as part of a three-disc "limited edition" boxed set without the bonus disc.

{{Main|Original unaltered trilogy}}
The trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc Limited Edition DVD sets from [[September 12]], 2006 to [[December 31]], [[2006]]; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material. Controversy surrounded the release (often referred to as "George's [[original unaltered trilogy]]", or "GOUT" for short) because the so-called "unaltered" versions were from the 1993 non-[[Wikipedia:Anamorphic|anamorphic]] [[Wikipedia:Laserdisc|laserdisc]] masters, and were not re-transferred to modern DVD standards.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.mindjack.com/film/archives/2006_05_01_archive.html|title=Anamorphic Star Wars and Other Musings|author=Ian Dawe|date=2006-05-26|work=[http://www.mindjack.com/film/index.shtml Mindjack]|archivedate=20190203135525}}</ref>

It was re-released in the Blu-ray format on [[September 16]], [[2011]].<ref>{{SWArchive|url=movies/saga/bluraymay4/index.html|text=Bring the Complete Collection Home: Star Wars: The Complete Saga on Blu-Ray|archivedate=20110724012505}}</ref>

On [[April 7]], [[2015]], the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released ''Star Wars'' films. Fox released ''A New Hope'' for digital download on April 10, 2015 (while Disney released the other five films).<ref>{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-digital-movie-collection-coming-april-10|text=The ''Star Wars'' Digital Movie Collection Coming April 10}}</ref>

Despite The Walt Disney Company's [[2012]] purchase of Lucasfilm and the release rights to all future ''Star Wars'' films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to ''A New Hope'', which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through [[May]] [[2020]], at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tangled-rights-could-tie-up-384541|title=Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis)|author=Masters, Kim|date=2012-10-30|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter'']]|archivedate=20200215125918}}</ref> On [[December 14]], [[2017]], The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring most of Fox's parent company, [[Wikipedia:21st Century Fox|21st Century Fox]], including the film studio and all distribution rights to ''A New Hope''.<ref name="Acquire">{{DisneyCompany|url=walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2|text=The Walt Disney Company To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., After Spinoff Of Certain Businesses, For $52.4 Billion In Stock|archivedate=20200617112439}}</ref> On [[March 20]], 2019, the [[Wikipedia:Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|deal]] was officially completed.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-closes-fox-deal-creating-global-content-powerhouse-1174498|title=Disney Closes $71.3 Billion Fox Deal, Creating Global Content Powerhouse|author=Szalai, Georg; Bond, Paul|date=2019-03-19|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|The Hollywood Reporter]]|archivedate=20200611175708}}</ref> On [[April 12]], 2019, a [[Wikipedia:Blu-ray|Blu-ray]] box set containing the nine main installments of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars saga|saga]] remastered in 4K was reportedly announced to be in development for a 2020 release.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/film/content/105409/exclusive-skywalker-saga-4k|title=Exclusive: Disney are working on a 4K Blu-ray box set for Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga (updated)|date=2019-04-12|work=[https://www.thedigitalfix.com The Digital Fix]|archivedate=20190506104719}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Star Wars'' debuted on May 25, 1977 in 32 theaters, and proceeded to break house records, effectively becoming one of the first [[Wikipedia:Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://fromscripttodvd.com/star_wars_a_day_long_remembered.htm|title=May 25, 1977: A Day Long Remembered|author=Coate, Michael|work=[https://www.fromscripttodvd.com From Script to DVD]|archivedate=20200304005712}}</ref> It remains one of the most financially successful films of all time. Some of the cast and crew noted lines of people stretching around theaters as they drove by. Even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs, and cast members became instant household names.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /> The film's original total U.S. gross came to $307,263,857, and it earned $6,806,951 during its first weekend in wide release. Lucas claimed that he had spent most of the release day in a sound studio in Los Angeles. When he went out for lunch with his then-wife Marcia, they encountered a long queue of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann's Chinese Theater, waiting to see ''Star Wars''.<ref name="Heritage" /> The film became the highest-grossing film of 1977 and the highest-grossing film of all time until [[Wikipedia:E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial|''E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'']] broke that record in 1982. (With subsequent re-releases, ''Star Wars'' reclaimed the title, but lost it again to [[Wikipedia:James Cameron|James Cameron's]] 1997 blockbuster [[Wikipedia:Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']].) The film earned $797,900,000 worldwide, making it the first film to reach the $300 million mark.<ref name="Mojo">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2759034369|title=Star Wars Episode IV &ndash; A New Hope &ndash; Box Office Mojo|work=[[Wikipedia:Box Office Mojo|Box Office Mojo]]|archivedate=20200713075502}}</ref> Adjusted for inflation it is the second highest grossing movie of all time in the United States, behind [[Wikipedia:Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']].<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm|title=All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation|work=[[Wikipedia:Box Office Mojo|Box Office Mojo]]|archivedate=20100308041311}}</ref>

The ''New York Times'' described ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'' as "the most beautiful movie serial ever made." [[Wikipedia:Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert]] called the film "an out-of-body experience," compared its special effects to those of [[Wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']], and opined that the true strength of the film was its "pure narrative."<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-1977|title=Star Wars|author=Ebert, Roger|date=1977-01-01|work=[https://www.rogerebert.com RogerEbert.com]|archivedate=20180818102118}}</ref> [[Wikipedia:Vincent Canby|Vincent Canby]] called the film "the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure."<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/052677wars.html|title='Star Wars'—A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny&hellip;|author=Canby, Vincent|date=1977-05-26|work=[[Wikipedia:The New York Times|''The New York Times'']]|archivedate=20191108124533}}</ref>

''Star Wars'' won multiple awards at the 1978 Academy Awards, including [[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration]], which went to [[John Barry]], [[Norman Reynolds]], [[Leslie Dilley]] and [[Roger Christian]]. [[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] was awarded to [[John Mollo]]; [[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] went to Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew; [[John Stears]], [[John Dykstra]], [[Richard Edlund]], [[Grant McCune]] and [[Robert Blalack]] all received awards for [[Wikipedia:Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Effects, Visual Effects]].

At the [[Wikipedia:Golden Globe|Golden Globe]] awards, the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Alec Guinness), and Best Score. It only won the award for Best Score. It received six [[Wikipedia:British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations: Best Film, Best Editing, Best Costume, Best Production/Art Design, Best Sound, and Best Score; the film won in the latter two categories. John Williams' soundtrack album won the [[Wikipedia:Grammy|Grammy]] award for Best Album of an original score for a motion picture or television program, and the film was awarded the [[Wikipedia:Hugo Award|Hugo Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation. In 1997, the [[Wikipedia:MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] awarded Chewbacca the lifetime achievement award for his work in the ''Star Wars'' trilogy.{{Fact}}

Originally, if the film did poorly at the box office, Lucas planned to turn the novel ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'' into a low-budget sequel to the movie. According to an interview with Alan Dean Foster in [[Wikipedia:Empire (magazine)|''Empire'']] magazine, the book was written to be filmed as a low-budget sequel if ''Star Wars'' was not a huge success. Harrison Ford was not signed for the sequel as of the writing of the book, which is why Han Solo does not appear in the novel. However, with the success of ''A New Hope'', Lucas was free to make ''The Empire Strikes Back''.{{Fact}}

==Deleted scenes==
There are many short alternate takes throughout ''Star Wars'' where Luke appears in his poncho: Luke in the desert, in the Tusken Raiders' canyon, Luke finding the destroyed homestead, and in the hangar on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. The only poncho scenes that made the final cut were in Docking Bay 94, on the ''Millennium Falcon'' flight from the Death Star, and on arrival on Yavin 4.

===Aunt Beru's Blue Milk===
[[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru]] is in the homestead, pouring a blue liquid into a jug.

===Luke in the Desert===
[[File:EP4_luke_watching_battle.jpg|right|thumb|Luke with his [[Macrobinoculars/Legends|macrobinoculars]]]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] is in the Tatooine desert repairing a [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|moisture vaporator]], assisted by a [[WED Treadwell repair droid|Treadwell]] droid, when he notices shining objects in the sky. With his macrobinoculars Luke sees two ships engaged in combat beyond the atmosphere. He jumps into his [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]]. The malfunctioning Treadwell blows a fuse and is unable to follow. Luke speeds off into the desert to find his friends. The scene originally occurred after the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] is boarded, just before Darth Vader's first appearance in the film. It is thought that there is no longer any clear footage of this scene available. Existing footage has been degraded by poor film storage conditions over the years. Before the film was cut, this was the audience's first sight of the young Luke Skywalker, much earlier than in the final cut. It was removed along with subsequent scenes of Luke and his friends in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. George Lucas had originally written the scenes and shot them at the suggestion of his industry friends who thought that audiences wouldn't understand the story strictly being told from a droid's point of view. Upon realizing that the story was really about the droids' adventures and it was them leading things to Luke and Obi-Wan, etc. Lucas took the footage out.

===Tosche Station===
Luke's landspeeder races into the town of Anchorhead, nearly running over an old woman. Luke rushes into [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]] excitedly telling his friends about the battle above their planet. He is overjoyed to be reunited with his friend [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]] who is on planet leave from the Academy. [[Deacon|Deak]], [[Windy Starkiller|Windy]], [[Camie Loneozner|Camie]], [[Laze Loneozner/Legends|Fixer]] and Biggs all follow Luke outside to see the battle with Luke's macrobinoculars. The battle appears to have ended and Luke's friends ridicule him for making it all up. This scene was to come just after R2-D2 and C-3PO eject from the ''Tantive IV'' in an escape pod, and before the scene where [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] is led captive before Darth Vader. This scene establishes Luke's difficult relationships with his peers, and gives a picture of life on Tatooine. Storyline pacing may have been the deciding factor, but it should also be borne in mind that after Lucas's first screening of the rough cut of ''Star Wars'' in 1977, a fellow filmmaker jokingly accused him of producing "''American Graffiti'' in space." This jibe probably influenced Lucas to cut the scenes set in Anchorhead. The sequence where Luke nearly runs down an old woman was an effects shot that was never completed.

===Luke and Biggs===
[[File:LukeBiggs2-MOSW.png|right|thumb|Luke says farewell to Biggs]]
This scene is a conversation between Luke and his oldest friend, Biggs Darklighter. Biggs has left Tatooine and is on planet leave from the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]] where he is training to be a space pilot. Luke's envy of Biggs's success conflicts with his duty to his uncle and his reasons for remaining on Tatooine. Biggs quietly tells Luke that he has decided to join the Rebellion against the Empire. In a tense and emotional conversation, the two young men say their final farewells. This scene was to come in between the scene where C-3PO spots a distant Jawa sandcrawler in the desert, and the capture of R2-D2 by the Jawas in the canyon. The Luke and Biggs sequence was part of the whole Anchorhead backstory on Tatooine, and was cut along with the other early scenes on Tatooine, probably for reasons of story pacing.

===Vader and Chief Bast===
In this short scene, Darth Vader and Chief [[Moradmin Bast/Legends|Bast]] walk along a corridor on the Death Star. Bast reports that the search for the missing droids has extended to Mos Eisley spaceport. Vader observes that Princess Leia is resisting interrogation, and Bast boldly criticizes [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Tarkin's]] plan to break her as "foolish." The scene would have appeared between the scene where Han Solo encounters Jabba the Hutt in [[Docking Bay 94/Legends|Docking Bay 94]] (also cut), and the scene where Luke and Ben find the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] in Docking Bay 94.

===The Search for R2===
[[File:SearchForArtoo-MOSW.png|thumb|C-3PO pilots the landspeeder]]
R2-D2 has absconded from his new master, Luke Skywalker. Early in the morning, Luke and Threepio rush off in the landspeeder to search for R2, with Threepio driving the landspeeder. They talk about Artoo, Ben Kenobi, and how angry Uncle Owen is going to be. The scene belongs at the start of the sequence where Luke and 3PO search for R2, before the attack of the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. The moment was scored with a light version of Luke's theme; the music can be heard at the beginning of the cue "Land of the Sand People" on the original LP and CD configurations, or "Landspeeder Search" in the Special Edition album. Before the days of CGI, scenes like this landspeeder cockpit sequence had to be filmed against a rear-projection screen. The scene was dropped due to poor quality.

===Stormtrooper Search===
Various alien creatures are seen walking around a narrow street in Mos Eisley, and some Stormtroopers walk past.

===Darth Vader widens the Search===
This is a scene with Darth Vader and another Imperial officer on the [[Death Star]].
