==Plot summary==
===Vader's arrival to the Death Star===
{{Quote|The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.|Darth Vader|<ref name="Film" />}}
[[File:MoffJerjerrodGreetsVader.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Moff Jerjerrod greets Darth Vader aboard the newly built Death Star.]]
Almost a full [[Standard year|year]] after the events of ''The Empire Strikes Back'',<ref name="Princess and the Scoundrel">''[[The Princess and the Scoundrel]]''</ref> [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] lands in the docking bay of the incomplete [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], which the Empire designed to be more powerful than the first. He is greeted by [[Moff]] [[Tiaan Jerjerrod]], but demands construction be put back on schedule in order to complete the Death Star on time. Jerjerrod argues that they need more men, but quickly agrees to double their efforts when he learns that [[Darth Sidious|the Emperor]] is coming.

===Arriving at Jabba's Palace===
{{Quote|If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt&hellip; you'd probably short-circuit.|C-3PO to R2-D2|<ref name="Film" />}}
Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] and company have arrived on [[Tatooine]] in an attempt to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] their friend [[Han Solo]] from [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the Hutt's [[Boba Fett's Palace|desert palace]].
[[File:Jabba's_dais.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Jabba the Hutt reclines with his slave girl Oola.]]
First, the droids [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] arrive with a [[Hologram|holographic]] message from Skywalker asking Jabba to release Solo. In exchange, the two droids are presented as gifts to the crime lord; Luke promises that both are hardworking and that they will serve him well, which Jabba agrees to silently. However, when the message finishes, he states that there will be no bargain and that he won't give up his "favorite decoration". The two droids are then sent to their quarters, where [[EV-9D9]] harshly barks at the two when they explain what they can do. 3PO is ordered to be Jabba's interpreter, while R2 is tasked with working on the ''Khetanna''.

That evening, the [[Max Rebo Band]] (led by [[Sy Snootles]]) entertains the Hutt's guests. Jabba, engaged by the graceful gyrations of his collared slave girl [[Oola]], starts tugging on her chain and commanding her to come to him on his throne. Oola fearfully resists him, and in annoyance, Jabba pushes a button on his throne, and Oola is dropped through a hidden trapdoor at the foot of his throne, into the pit of the [[rancor]] monster, which immediately devours her.

===Saving Han Solo===
Later, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] (in the guise of [[bounty hunter]] [[Boushh]]) arrives with [[Chewbacca]] as her "prisoner" to collect part of the bounty Jabba sought years earlier when he put a price on Solo's head. After much bargaining (including Leia threatening Jabba with a [[thermal detonator]]), Jabba settles on a deal, and has Chewbacca imprisoned.

That night, Leia releases Han Solo from his [[carbonite]] coffin, and after revealing her identity to him, she kisses him. As they prepare to escape, they are caught by Jabba and his thugs. Ignoring Han's pleas, Jabba has the captain thrown in prison with Chewbacca. Although [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] (disguised as one of Jabba's prison guards) tries to sneak off with Leia, Jabba stops them and orders a [[Gamorrean]] guard to bring Leia to him. Leia warns the Hutt that he will regret capturing the Rebels, but Jabba ignores the threat and licks her face. Leia is forced to become Jabba's newest slave girl, being made to wear a [[Huttese slave-girl costume|dancing costume]] and chained to the throne as a trophy.

===Luke Skywalker arrives at the palace===
[[File:Luke_the_hutt.png|thumb|left|250px|Luke Skywalker meets with Jabba the Hutt, who flaunts his power by exploiting Princess Leia as his slave.]]
Later, Luke arrives at the palace. Jabba and most of his court are asleep, but are awoken by [[Bib Fortuna]] (who, in trying to impede the Jedi's entrance, is [[Mind trick|Force-tricked]] into welcoming him). Leia remains silent beside the Hutt, despite her rising hope at seeing Luke. Luke demands that Jabba release Han and his other friends, but Jabba refuses the young Jedi's offer. Luke uses [[the Force]] to pull a nearby blaster and attempts to shoot Jabba, but the Hutt activates the trapdoor to protect himself, dropping the Jedi and an unfortunate guard into the rancor pit.

After a battle with the rancor (which devours the fallen guard), Luke ultimately kills the monster by crushing it under the gate of its compound, piercing its neck with the spikes at the bottom of the gate. He is then captured and brought up by Jabba's thugs. Jabba, furious, chokes Leia until she falls back on his stomach, and orders the prisoners to be brought before him. Luke, Han, and Chewbacca are brought before Jabba, exchanging relief at each other's safety as Leia struggles with Jabba to sit upright before him.

Using C-3PO as a translator, Jabba sentences Luke and his friends to be taken to the [[Dune Sea]] for termination (over a course of a thousand years) by the man-eating [[sarlacc]] at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]]. Leia is spared from execution since she is Jabba's favorite slave. As Jabba orders the prisoners to be taken away, Luke warns him that he's made his last mistake, at which the Hutt laughs in amusement.

===Skirmish at the Great Pit of Carkoon===
{{Quote|Jabba, This is your last chance. Free us, or die.|Luke Skywalker, to Jabba Desilijic Tiure|<ref name="Film" />}}
Jabba, accompanied by Leia and several of his thugs, travels to the Pit of Carkoon via his [[Khetanna|sail barge]], while the prisoners are taken on a smaller [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|skiff]]. En route, R2-D2 is tasked with serving drinks to Jabba's guests, and the Max Rebo band plays music in the background. Jabba allows Leia to climb off his throne and watch her friends from a window. After a while, he gives a tug on her chain, playfully commanding her to come to him. Leia glares back at him and returns to watching, and Jabba chuckles. He later pulls her chain again, this time forcing her to run to him on his throne. Jabba then informs Leia that she will soon learn to appreciate him and makes her drink from his goblet.

Outside, Luke and his companions (with Lando, still in disguise) discuss their situation. Han, still half-blinded from the side-effects of [[Carbon-freezing|carbonization]], is sure that they are all going to die, and Luke tries to reassure him of their ultimate safety, but Han is not easily convinced. Elsewhere in the sail barge, C-3PO literally runs into R2-D2 and knocks over the shorter droid's drink tray. C-3PO laments their friends' imminent deaths, but R2-D2 shows a kind of confidence, which C-3PO doesn't see any reason for.
[[File:LukeGreenSaber-MOROTJ.png|thumb|right|220px|Luke attacks Jabba's guards with his new lightsaber]]
When the vehicles ultimately reach the pit, Jabba has C-3PO announce the group's deaths, but that he is willing to now listen to their pleas. Han calls Jabba names and tells him that he'll not get any pleasure from their pleading, much to the Hutt's amusement, and Luke offers a final chance for Jabba to free him and his friends or die. Jabba and his guests laugh off this last threat and order the execution to commence. Luke gets ushered off of a plank and into the sarlacc, only to Force-flip up through the air and onto the skiff. Meanwhile, R2-D2 launches Luke's recently built [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|lightsaber]] from a hidden panel in his housing, and Luke catches it and begins to kill his captors. As Jabba furiously orders his thugs to intervene, C-3PO gets knocked over. Leia looks around, ready to use her false submission to the Hutt to her advantage.

[[Boba Fett]] uses his [[jetpack]] to fly off of the barge and land on the skiff as Luke is in the act of freeing Han and Chewbacca. Luke uses his lightsaber to cut Fett's [[EE-3 carbine rifle|blaster]] in half, and Chewbacca pushes the bounty hunter onto the deck. Luke then jumps onto another of the accompanying skiffs to fight off the guards and thugs there.

While fighting a guard, Lando accidentally falls off the side of the skiff, and although he manages to hold onto a wire, one of the sarlacc's tentacles begins to pull him to his death, and Han and Chewbacca have to carefully rescue him. Han accidentally activates Fett's backpack when he turns around and smashes the butt of an axe against it. Fett subsequently flies out of control from the skiff, crashing against the hull of the barge before falling into the sarlacc's open mouth, making it belch.
[[File:Jabbachoke.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Leia prepares to strangle Jabba with the very chain he'd used to enslave her.]]
Aboard the sail barge, Leia smashes the controls for the sail barge's interior lights, throwing it into darkness, and proceeds to strangle Jabba with her chain, killing him, Leia jumps off of the throne and has R2-D2 help break her chain, then heads for the stairs to the top surface of the sail barge. Meanwhile, [[Salacious B. Crumb]] attacks the fallen C-3PO, and R2-D2 uses the same device he'd freed Leia with to chase the lizard-monkey away. Reaching the surface, the droids jump off the edge of the sail barge and land in the Tatooinian sand.

Luke and Leia defeat the remaining guards on the Sail Barge, then Luke has Leia point the guns toward the heart of the vehicle. They prepare to swing from a loose cable on the Barge's sails, and Luke discharges the guns, beginning to destroy the barge. They swing to their rescue on the land skiff with Han, Lando, and Chewbacca, then use magnets to pick up the two droids from the sand. They all drive off just as the sail barge explodes.

Later, all of the crew (except for Luke and R2-D2) depart [[Tatooine]] for the rendezvous point near [[Sullust]] (mentioned in ''The Empire Strikes Back'') where the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] is assembling, while Luke and R2-D2 (in their X-wing) head for [[Dagobah]] to fulfill a promise to Yoda made some time earlier.

===The Emperor arrives===
{{Quote|Patience, my friend. In time, he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.''"<br />"''As you wish.''"<br />"''Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.|Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader|<ref name="Film" />}}
On the second Death Star, Emperor Palpatine arrives and praises Darth Vader on his efforts in the construction of the Death Star. He also senses that Vader craves the continuation of his search for his son, Luke. The old [[Sith Lord]] assures his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] that Luke will seek Vader out, that only together would the Sith be able to turn Luke to the [[dark side of the Force]], and that everything was proceeding as Palpatine has foreseen.

===Returning to Dagobah===
{{Quote|But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.|Luke Skywalker, to Yoda|<ref name="Film" />}}
[[File:Yoda's_death.png|thumb|right|220px|Yoda dies and becomes one with the Force.]]
Luke and R2-D2 arrive on Dagobah to find a terminally ill [[Yoda]]. Luke has returned to complete his [[Jedi training]], but Yoda declares no further training is required. All that remains for Luke is to confront Vader. Yoda then reveals that Vader is indeed his father. The 900-year-old [[Jedi Master]] gives one last mention of wisdom to the young Jedi before he dies, disappearing in the way [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] did in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], thereby becoming one with the Force.

As Luke approaches his [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing]], the [[Force spirit|spirit]] form of Obi-Wan confirms that Vader was once [[Anakin Skywalker]], a former Jedi Knight who turned to the dark side of the Force. Kenobi also reveals that Luke has a twin sister, hidden from Luke at birth as protection from the Emperor. Luke senses that his sister is Leia. Kenobi warns Luke to bury his feelings, for they could in time "serve the Emperor."

===The mission begins===
[[File:Home_One_Endor.png|thumb|left|250px|The Alliance Fleet amassing near Sullust]]
At the rendezvous point near [[Sullust]], the Rebel Alliance gathers to reveal plans to attack the Death Star. As part of the plans, Luke, Leia, Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and a strike team must penetrate the [[deflector shield generator]] on the [[Endor|forest moon]] of [[Endor (planet)|Endor]] in order to deactivate the shield if the Rebel fleet is to attack the Death Star. However, Vader knows this because he could sense that his son was with them and allows them to land on the planet. Luke senses his father as well and begins to believe that he would endanger the mission by coming.

The strike team lands on Endor only to be discovered by [[Scout trooper|Imperial scout troopers]]. A [[speeder bike]] chase ensues, only for Leia to be thrown off her speeder and knocked unconscious. Luke and Han discover Leia's helmet, then they, with Chewbacca and the droids, try to find her. Leia is awakened by one of Endor's forest creatures, an [[Ewok]] named [[Wicket Wystri Warrick|Wicket W. Warrick]]. Suddenly, another scout trooper discovers Leia, but Wicket does away with the trooper before rescuing Leia.

Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and the droids, meanwhile, fall into a booby trap set by the Ewoks. R2-D2 cuts open the net setting them free, but the Ewok tribe discovers C-3PO and proclaims him to be their god. The droid's Human and Wookiee friends are taken prisoner, and the Ewoks proclaim Han to be the main course in a banquet in C-3PO's honor. Discovered by Leia, Luke then uses the Force to levitate C-3PO to show off his "great magic." Convinced of the Rebels' good intentions, the Ewoks set them free and later that evening make them "part of the tribe," thereby agreeing to join the fight against the Empire. But Luke decides the time has come to leave Endor and face Darth Vader. Leia follows Luke out of the tribal gathering, whereupon he tells her that Vader is his father and she is his sister. Leia is rendered utterly shocked, but accepts the truth. She is comforted by Han Solo.

===Meeting the Emperor===
{{Quote|Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken... about a great many things.|Emperor Palpatine to Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Film" />}}
Vader arrives in his shuttle on a docking bay, and Luke, having already surrendered to the Empire, talks with Vader in an attempt to bring the Sith Lord out of the dark side of the Force, but to no avail. The Empire takes Luke into custody for transportation to the Death Star. The next day, the Rebels attempt to locate the shield generator, and the Rebel fleet enters [[hyperspace]] from Sullust to prepare for the final attack. Luke and Vader finally enter the Death Star and confront the Emperor, who looks forward to completing Luke's training and believes that while Vader would never turn from the dark side, neither would Luke. He also reveals that it was he who coordinated the Rebels finding the secret plans and locating the shield generator so that the Alliance can fall into a trap of Palpatine's devising.

===The [[Battle of Endor]] begins===
[[File:BattleofEndor.png|thumb|right|275px|The battle of Endor starts.]]
The Rebels enter the heart of the shield generator, only to be taken prisoner by the Imperial forces. The fleet emerges from hyperspace for the battle, but discovers the shield is still up. As they contemplate their options, the Imperial fleet, which they were led to believe was away, appears and an intense battle begins. Han and the strike team are led out of the bunker by the [[stormtrooper]]s, but the [[droid]]s and the [[Ewok]]s have already orchestrated the attack on the Empire, and another intense battle commences with the Rebels and Ewoks on one side, the Empire on another. The Emperor shows Luke the full power of the Death Star as the station, now fully operational, destroys one of the Alliance's ships. Meanwhile, on Endor, the battle continues, with casualties (Rebel, stormtrooper, and Ewok) already mounting. Eventually, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca gain access to the bunker.

===Duel between father and son===
[[File:Return_of_the_jedi_4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vader and Luke battle each other on the 2nd Death Star.|alt=]]
Back on the Death Star, Luke, with the encouragement of Darth Sidious, lashes out at him with his lightsaber, only to be deflected by Vader, and the final duel between father and son begins. As Luke climbs onto a balcony, Vader throws his lightsaber at his son. It misses Luke and knocks the balcony down, taking Luke with it. Vader stalks for a hidden Luke to let down his guard, while quietly sensing within his son's mind that Luke has a sister. Vader threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not, prompting Luke to respond viciously in intense saber fighting, up to the point where Luke strikes off Vader's right mechanical hand. Sidious betrays Vader by encouraging Luke to take his father's place at his side, but Luke controls his anger and throws his lightsaber aside. He declares himself to be a Jedi Knight like his father Anakin had been before he turned over to the dark side into Darth Vader.

===Anakin's choice===
Han, Leia, and Chewbacca escape from the bunker just in time for its destruction, thus bringing down the shield. The Alliance is now free to attack the half-completed Death Star. On the Death Star, the enraged Emperor declares that if Luke will not turn to the dark side, he will be destroyed, and uses [[Force lightning]] against the young Jedi. He revels in torturing Luke by slowly increasing the intensity of the lightning. Luke then cries out to his father to help him. As the Emperor prepares to deliver the killing bolts, Vader prepares to make a choice; he looks at Luke and then the Emperor, conflicted whether to save his son or to continue serving his master.

Moved by his son's cries for help and unwilling to see him die, Vader turns back into the light side as Anakin and lifts the Emperor into the air, carries him over and throws him into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him. However, in the process, Anakin is struck by the Emperor's force lightning, which enters his organic remains, striking his life support system and his respirator, mortally wounding him. The ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and its remaining Rebel fighters enter the bowels of the Death Star, and some fighters engage in a point-blank attack on the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]], causing the [[Executor|Imperial flagship's]] destruction.

===Anakin Skywalker's Death===
{{Quote|No, you're coming with me. I'll not leave you here. I've got to save you"."<br />"''You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister you were right.|[[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]], in the moments before Anakin's death|<ref name="Film" />}}
[[File:Anakinredeemed.png|thumb|right|220px|Anakin Skywalker's last moments]]
On the Death Star, in the middle of the evacuation, Luke carries his father's ravaged body to the foot of an Imperial shuttle's ramp. Anakin stops Luke and asks him to remove his mask so that he can look upon the face of his son, just for once, with his "own eyes".

Luke removes the mask and sees the face of his father for the first time. Anakin's face is revealed to have turned pale white and scaly, and his head retains some vicious scars after 23 years from [[Duel on Mustafar|his duel]] with Obi-Wan Kenobi in Episode III: ''Revenge of the Sith''.

Anakin tells Luke that his son was right—he did have good left in him, and asks him to tell his sister the same. With that, Anakin Skywalker, the redeemed Jedi Knight, smiles at his son and dies peacefully. Luke bows his head in sadness.

===Knocking out the main reactor===
The ''Millennium Falcon'' and its strike force (in the last Rebel fighter inside) reach the Death Star's main reactor and fire [[concussion missile]]s and [[proton torpedo]]es at it, causing it to collapse. Luke escapes the Death Star with his father's body and flies out through the flames, as do Wedge Antilles and the ''Millennium Falcon'' before the Death Star explodes.

Seeing the destruction from above, Han senses Leia's love for Luke. He offers to step aside when Luke arrives, but she tells Han that Luke is her brother. After a moment of speechless surprise, Han and Leia engage in a passionate kiss.

===The big galaxy victory celebration===
{{Quote|Wesa free!|An unidentified Gungan|<ref name="Film" />}}
[[File:Anakinfuneral.png|thumb|left|Anakin Skywalker's cremation]]
That evening in Endor, Luke sets a [[Funeral of Anakin Skywalker|funeral pyre]] ablaze to cremate the body of his father, still encased in Darth Vader's outfit, as per the [[Jedi funeral|Jedi funeral rite]]. His father's organic body becomes one with the Force. Through the midst of the rising flames and fireworks, Rebel fighters streak across the sky in celebration of one of the greatest Rebel victories in the [[Galactic Civil War]].

[[File:MosEisley-celebration.png|thumb|right|Tatooine celebrates]]
The planets [[Bespin]], [[Parades on Tatooine|Tatooine]], [[Rally on Naboo|Naboo]], and [[Riot in Monument Plaza|Coruscant]] also celebrate. Luke is reunited with his companions Han, Lando, the droids, Chewbacca, the surviving Rebel fleet, the Ewoks, and his sister Leia. Luke then catches sight of the Force ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and a redeemed Anakin Skywalker. Luke is pleased: not only is he now a Jedi, but his father is once again on the [[light side of the Force]]. Leia takes Luke by the hand, and they rejoin their friends and colleagues as the spirit ghosts of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin look on with pride.

==Development==
[[File:Blue_Harvest.png|thumb|right|300px]]
{{Quote|When shooting ''Jedi'' in the United States we called the film ''Blue Harvest''. Camera slates, invoices, hotel reservations, call sheets, production reports, and crew hats and T-shirts all read ''Blue Harvest''. So when a visitor would ask, 'what are you shooting' and we said ''Blue Harvest'', they went on their way. Can you imagine what would have happened if we had said, 'We're shooting the next film in the ''Star Wars'' trilogy'?"|[[Howard G. Kazanjian]]|<ref name="SW.com Blue Harvest">{{SWArchive|url=episode-vi/classic/2000/07/classic20000703.html|text=Blue Harvest Letdown|archivedate=20041022202801}}</ref>}}
For several reasons, the working title of the project was ''[[Blue Harvest]]'' and dubbed "Horror Beyond Imagination" to engender no interest whatsoever in order to disguise what the production crew was really filming from fans and the prying eyes of the press. George Lucas had severed all his remaining ties to the Hollywood system out of a feeling of persecution after the success of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and had become a truly independent filmmaker. Lucasfilm is a non-union company, and despite George Lucas's stature and clout, that, says [[Howard G. Kazanjian|Howard Kazanjian]] in ''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]'', made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' were mammoth hits.

The title was used in all areas where it seemed necessary. The ''Blue Harvest'' ruse, credited to producer Howard Kazanjian, was very thorough, emblazoning the fictitious film's logo on a wide range of film production items including shirts, caps, coats, buttons, signs, invoices and stationery. The ''Blue Harvest'' facade did give a bit of a wink and nod to its true purpose, however, as the supposed film's logo (intentionally or unintentionally) utilized the distinctive ''[[Star Wars]]'' logo lettering style. In particular the ruse was employed during location filming in Yuma, Arizona. The filming took place in the dunes over the Thanksgiving holiday, where there was a reported crowd of 35,000 dune-buggy enthusiasts. After erecting a chain-link fence, employing a huge security force, and dodging a myriad of press inquiries, in the end approximately sixty fans saw through the ruse and refused to leave until they obtained a few autographs and photos.{{Fact}}

The film's director was the late [[Richard Marquand]], who passed away in [[1987]] of a heart ailment, but reports have suggested that George Lucas was still heavily involved in the shooting of ''Return of the Jedi'' and likely directed some of the second-unit work personally when shooting threatened to go over schedule. Lucas admits in the documentary ''Empire of Dreams'' that he had to often be on the set due to Marquand's relative inexperience with special effects, but comments by [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']] director [[Irvin Kershner]] on that film's DVD audio commentary track suggest that Lucas, who acted more as an advisor on ''The Empire Strikes Back'', had a similar role on the production of ''Return of the Jedi''. Moreover, George Lucas, according to Kershner, called ''The Empire Strikes Back'' Kershner's movie, not his.

Some have noted the differences between Richard Marquand's direction style and Lucas's direction style and say that they're dissimilar. The screenplay was written by [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and Lucas (with uncredited contributions by [[Wikipedia:David Webb Peoples|David Webb Peoples]]), based on Lucas's story. Howard G. Kazanjian served as producer.

[[File:RotjOrig.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Original movie poster]]
The documentary ''Empire of Dreams'' states that George Lucas initially intended to call the film ''Return of the Jedi'', but then changed it to [[Star Wars: Episode VI Revenge of the Jedi|''Revenge of the Jedi'']] when Lawrence Kasdan told him that "Return" was a weak title. On [[January 27]], a few months before the movie released, Lucas announced that the film would be titled ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref name="This Week! Ep1">{{SWYoutube|Li4auBiXm_0|Star Wars: The Clone Wars, The Child, Star Wars Nite, and More &#124; This Week! In Star Wars|archivedate=20200501233426}}</ref> In interviews, Lucas said that the reason for the change is that a Jedi would not seek revenge. There are many, though, who speculate that George Lucas had planned to call the film ''Return of the Jedi'' all along, and only used "Revenge" as a means to throw off merchandise counterfeiters. It has also been claimed that the reason for the change was because the working title of [[MemoryAlpha:Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'']] was ''The Vengeance of Khan'', and that the title was changed because of its similarity to ''Revenge of the Jedi''. In William Shatner's autobiography [[MemoryAlpha:Star Trek Movie Memories|''Star Trek Movie Memories'']], director [[Wikipedia:Nicholas Meyer|Nicholas Meyer]] confirmed that he didn't believe that [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] would allow [[Wikipedia:Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] to change his film's title from ''The Undiscovered Country'' to ''The Vengeance of Khan'' because of the making of ''Revenge of the Jedi''. Nevertheless, all of this potential controversy was erased when ''Star Trek II'' was retitled ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''Revenge of the Jedi'' finally became ''Return of the Jedi''. In any event, the working title was partially reused for Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith''.

Filming took place from [[January 11]] to [[May 20]], [[1982]], in [[Wikipedia:Redwood National and State Parks|Redwood National Park]] forests in [[Wikipedia:California|California]], the [[Yuma|Yuma desert]] in [[Wikipedia:Arizona|Arizona]], and at the [[Elstree Studios]], [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. A shot from the speeder bike scene was the last to be completed.<ref name="Empire Turns 40">{{SWYoutube|6UccH037VQ0|The Empire Strikes Back Turns 40, Queen's Peril Gets a Voice, and More!|archivedate=20200521205510}}</ref> During breaks in filming, First Assistant Director [[David Tomblin]] worked with [[Warwick Davis]] on ''[[Return of the Ewok]]'', a short film intended to be a promotional piece. However, the project was never completed and is presumed lost, with the only known copy being a VHS in Davis' possession (which has since been digitally archived by Lucasfilm).<ref>{{InsiderCite|46|Return of the Ewok (article)|Return of the Ewok}}</ref>

With a massive worldwide marketing campaign, ''Star Wars'' series artist [[Drew Struzan]] created the iconic and distinctive images for the movie posters and other advertising. In the film's release poster, Luke Skywalker is depicted holding a blue [[lightsaber]]&mdash;a lightsaber color that does not appear in the film. His new lightsaber is green&mdash;although it is blue in one trailer, suggesting the decision to make it green was made late in production. In fact, the decision was made to make Luke's blade contrast with the blue sky of Tatooine and make it more visible during the skirmish at Carkoon.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://movieweb.com/return-of-jedi-star-wars-luke-skywalker-why-green-lightsaber|title=Why Luke's Lightsaber Is Green in Return of the Jedi|author=Orange, B.

A wardrobe problem was present in the film in that all Imperial characters, regardless of rank, are shown wearing identical rank insignia, that of an Imperial Navy Commander. The production staff only recognized this halfway through the film's shooting, and the error remained uncorrected in the final version of the film.

Prior to production of the film, Mark Hamill speculated that Luke would end up turning to the dark side midway through the film, with the main conflict being whether Luke could return to the light side. A similar conflict would emerge in the comic serial ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''.

==Release==

The film was released on [[May 25]], [[1983]]&mdash;six years to the day after the original film.

===Merchandise===
The [[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (novel)|novelization]] of ''Return of the Jedi'' was written by [[James Kahn]]. While it contains many scenes that were deleted from the final cut, with the release of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Kahn's assertion that Anakin Skywalker's memories of "lava crawling up his back" have proved to be in error. In the novelization of ''Return of the Jedi'', Obi-Wan Kenobi recounts to Luke Skywalker that he and Anakin Skywalker had battled and that his father "fell into a molten pit." The novelization also erroneously refers to [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen Lars]] as Obi-Wan Kenobi's [[Owen (Kenobi)|brother]]. Owen Lars is, in fact, Anakin Skywalker's stepbrother. Incidentally, [[Joel Edgerton|Joel]] and [[Nash Edgerton]], Owen's portrayer and [[Ewan McGregor]]'s stunt double, respectively, in the [[prequel trilogy]], ''are'' brothers in real life. At the beginning of the confrontation in [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] throne room, the Emperor reads Luke's mind and discovers that Yoda completed Luke's Jedi training, and that Yoda is now dead. However, he gives no sign of recognition on hearing Yoda's name.

The film was adapted into comics form by [[Marvel Comics]]. Unlike the earlier film adaptations, it was not released as part of the [[Star Wars (Marvel Comics 1977)|ongoing Star Wars series]], but as a four-part ([[Return of the Jedi 1|1]] [[Return of the Jedi 2|2]] [[Return of the Jedi 3|3]] [[Return of the Jedi 4|4]]) mini-series of its own. The adaptation was scripted by [[Archie Goodwin]] and illustrated by [[Al Williamson]]. (A [[Star Wars Manga: Return of the Jedi|manga adaptation]], illustrated by [[Shin-Ichi Hiromoto]], was later released in Japan in 1998 and in the United States in 1999.)

While the first two ''Star Wars'' movies were adapted for radio in the early 1980s, it was not until [[1996]] that [[Star Wars (radio)|a radio version of ''Return of the Jedi'']] was produced. The adaptation was written by [[Brian Daley]] and was produced for and broadcast on [[National Public Radio]].

In November 1983, [[CBS]] aired the official making-of documentary, ''[[Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi]]''. The popularity of the Ewoks also led to two made-for-TV movies in [[1984]] ([[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure|''The Ewok Adventure'']] and [[1985]] (''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'') and an [[Ewoks (TV series)|an animated TV series]] that aired on [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] in 1985 and [[1986]].

===Special Edition and home video===
As with the other two films of his original trilogy, Lucas issued a [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]] of ''Return of the Jedi'', released on theaters on [[March 14]], [[1997]].<ref name="A Gift For Boba Fett" /> It makes a number of cosmetic [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|changes and additions]], including replacing a piece of music from the closing scene. In [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']] and ''Revenge of the Sith'', Anakin Skywalker is played by [[Hayden Christensen]]. However, in the original and Special Edition version of ''Return of the Jedi'', a much older actor named [[Sebastian Shaw]] played both the dying Anakin Skywalker and his Force spirit. In the DVD release, Anakin's ghost has become a young man, played by Christensen, and this is considered the [[canon]] version of the ghost. Lucas explains in the DVD commentary that Anakin has learned to control his life force beyond death, just as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda had before him. (This is briefly explained in ''Revenge of the Sith''.) So rather than appear as the older man who was Darth Vader, Anakin is able to return to the young man he once was before turning to the dark side.

The basic controversy arises from critics of Lucas's ongoing changes to all of the ''Star Wars'' films. On one hand, the redemption of Luke's father as an older man suggests that this is the image that should represent him after death. On the other, the older man was arguably never Anakin Skywalker until his final moments, and the vision of Hayden Christensen brings the story full circle: Darth Vader defeated, Anakin Skywalker at rest. Still, many fans argue that the insertion of Christensen is disrespectful toward Shaw.

On [[September 21]], [[2004]] the three original movies were released on [[Star Wars home video releases|DVD]]. There were a few further changes with this release, such as sound effects and improvements to the visual quality of the film.

During the sequence when the Emperor's defeat at Endor is announced to [[the galaxy]], an additional scene showing the celebrations on [[Theed]], Naboo was shown. A [[Gungan]] can be heard yelling "Wesa free" in this scene. In the scene showing the people of Coruscant celebrating, the Senate Building and the Jedi Temple have been added in the background.

With the release of the third episode that depicts how and why Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, George Lucas once again altered ''Return of the Jedi'' to strengthen the relationship between the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. Sebastian Shaw played Anakin in the hangar bay and in the final celebration scene in the original film. In the DVD release, Shaw portrayed Anakin in the hangar bay scene, though his eyebrows had been digitally removed so that his appearance more closely resembled Anakin's injured appearance at the end of ''Revenge of the Sith''. However, he was replaced by Hayden Christensen during the final celebration, appearing as he did in ''Revenge of the Sith'' prior to his injuries on [[Mustafar]]. Instead of simply reshooting the Force ghost of Anakin with Hayden, test footage of Hayden's head was digitally grafted to the body of Sebastian Shaw playing the role.

On [[September 12]], [[2006]], [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] released a two-DVD set consisting of the 2004 Special Edition and the unaltered original theatrical version. This release was limited, lasting through [[December 31]] of that year.<ref>{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/release/video/news20060503.html|text=This September: Original Unaltered Trilogy on DVD|archivedate=20060517020346}}</ref>

The film was re-released in the [[Wikipedia:Blu-ray|Blu-ray]] format on [[September 16]], [[2011]]. Among its bonus features, this released included previously unreleased [[Scenes cut from Star Wars|deleted scenes]] from the film.<ref>{{SWArchive|url=movies/saga/bluraymay4/index.html|text=Bring the Complete Collection Home: ''Star Wars: The Complete Saga'' on Blu-Ray|archivedate=20110507103835}}</ref> This release included a third round of changes to the film, mostly minor visual alterations.

On [[April 7]], [[2015]], the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released ''Star Wars'' films. As Lucasfilm had retained digital distribution rights to Episodes I through III and V through VI, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released ''Return of the Jedi'' for digital download on [[April 10]], 2015.<ref>{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-digital-movie-collection-coming-april-10|text=The ''Star Wars'' Digital Movie Collection Coming April 10}}</ref> On the official promo poster for ''Return of the Jedi'', Luke's lightsaber appeared blue; however, it is green in the movie.

Despite the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company's]] [[2012]] purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future ''Star Wars'' films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'', which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home-video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through [[May]] [[2020]], at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tangled-rights-could-tie-up-384541|title=Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis)|author=Masters, Kim|date=2012-10-30|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter'']]|archivedate=20200215125918}}</ref> On [[December 14]], [[2017]], The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring most of Fox's parent company, [[Wikipedia:21st Century Fox|21st Century Fox]], including the film studio and all distribution rights to ''A New Hope''.<ref name="Acquire">{{DisneyCompany|url=walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2|text=The Walt Disney Company To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., After Spinoff Of Certain Businesses, For $52.4 Billion In Stock|archivedate=20200617112439}}</ref> On [[March 20]], [[2019]], the [[Wikipedia:Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|deal]] was officially completed.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-closes-fox-deal-creating-global-content-powerhouse-1174498|title=Disney Closes $71.3 Billion Fox Deal, Creating Global Content Powerhouse|author=Bond, Paul|date=2019-03-19|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter'']]|archivedate=20200725043325}}</ref> On [[April 12]], 2019, a Blu-ray box set containing the nine main installments of the [[Star Wars saga|''Star Wars'' saga]] remastered in 4K was reportedly announced to be in development for a 2020 release.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/film/home-releases-news/star-wars-4k-march-2020|title=Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is set to arrive on 4K Blu-ray in March 2020|date=2019-04-12|work=[https://www.thedigitalfix.com The Digital Fix]|archivedate=20200727153852}}</ref>

==Reception==
While critical reception of the film was generally positive, ''Return of the Jedi'' is considered by some critics and many fans as the weakest film of the original trilogy. Some indication of public opinion can be gleaned by its relatively modest 72nd-place ranking in the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 films list. As a comparison, ''A New Hope'' is ranked at #20, and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' is ranked #12, as of April 24, 2016. In 1983, the late Roger Ebert gave the film a four-star rating, and Gary Arnold of the ''Washington Post'' described ''Return of the Jedi'' as "a triumph." Some contemporary fans and critics have found the film to be just as weak as the prequel films or just in comparison to the first two episodes.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/how-return-of-the-jedi-ruined-star-wars-forever-97620|title=How 'Return Of The Jedi' Ruined 'Star Wars' Forever|author=Taylor, Drew|date=2013-05-24|work=[[Wikipedia:IndieWire|IndieWire]]|archivedate=20171016013602}}</ref>

While the Jabba the Hutt sequence and many of the action set pieces (particularly the speeder bike chase on the Endor moon, the space battle between Rebel and Imperial pilots, and Luke Skywalker's duel against Darth Vader) are well regarded, the ground battle between the Ewoks and the stormtroopers remains a bone of contention. A large number of fans believe George Lucas pushed the "cutesy" factor with the Ewoks, especially with the belief that he did it to make it more marketable to children; and some of the production staff, such as Harrison Ford, felt awkward throughout the filming process about the Ewoks. However, other reasons were cited, such as the Wookiees, which were planned for that instance, being vetoed by Lucas due to the prior films showing that they were quite capable with technology via Chewbacca. In addition, fans seem to be rather divided on the premise that an extremely primitive race of small creatures could, albeit with aid, defeat an armed ground force comprising the Empire's best troops. Some fans call it ludicrous, while others credit the Ewoks' bravery, ingenuity, and determination, and draw comparisons between modern warfare in which familiarity with the terrain and guerrilla tactics can result in the defeat of a numerically and technologically superior force. In the commentary for the 2004 DVD release, Lucas explained that the Ewoks were an allegory for a technologically primitive force overcoming a powerful Empire, and compared it to examples like the Vietnam War, Attila the Hun and the Roman Empire, and the American Revolutionary War. ''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]'' reveals that the idea emerged and evolved from Lucas's interest in the Vietnam War in making ''Apocalypse Now'', in which specifically the primitive Vietcong overcame the United States.<ref name="Vietnam">{{Cite_web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/21/how-star-wars-was-secretly-george-lucas-protest-of-vietnam|title=How 'Star Wars' was secretly George Lucas' Vietnam protest|author=Smith, Kyle|date=2014-09-21|work=[[Wikipedia:New York Post|''New York Post'']]|archivedate=20200512050442}}</ref> This has been criticized by some, such as conservative commentator Bill Whittle, in the webseries ''Afterburner'' episode "[[Han shot first|Han Shot First]]," for its perceived offensive connotations and morally ambiguous implications.<ref name="Afterburner">{{Youtube|video=Ns1m_aXJa58|text=Afterburner with Bill Whittle: Han Shot First!|channel=channel/UCWq53_f3zgMcWuE-XFKSpyQ|channelname=Townhall Media|archivedate=20200701013338}}</ref> However, in the contemporary documentary ''[[From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga]]'', Lucas states that the Vietnam War was merely the inspiration from which the subplot evolved, rather than a political thesis. However, a note in the 1973 draft for ''A New Hope'' (then simply called ''Star Wars'') did make clear that the events of the film were inspired by "a large technological empire going after a group of freedom fighters" in a clear allusion to the events of Vietnam.<ref name="Vietnam" />

In [[2021]], the U.S. [[Wikipedia:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] selected ''Return of the Jedi'' for preservation in the [[Wikipedia:National Film Registry|National Film Registry]], considering it, "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="LoC">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-21-078|title='Return of the Jedi' Among 25 Eclectic Films Joining National Film Registry|date=2021-12-14|publisher=[[Wikipedia:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]]|archivedate=20220826034351}}</ref>
