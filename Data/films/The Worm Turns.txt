*A spider resembling the one in this short appears as the first boss in the Sega Genesis game ''[[World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck]]''.
*The music performed in this short is actually one of Franz von Supp√©'s most notable work, ''Leichte Kavallerie (Light Cavalry)''.
*This short was mainly made as an experiment to test the laboratory scene effects in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.
*Pete's line I knew I'd get ya! was later reused for [[Get a Horse!]]
