==Plot==
<small>From the official press-release:</small><br />
Inspired by the 1987 true story, "McFarland" follows high school coach Jim White (Kevin Costner), whose job-hopping leads him to predominantly Latino McFarland High School, located in an agricultural community in California's farm-rich San Joaquin Valley. Jim knows he has to make this school his last stop - he's out of options, with both his career and his family and finds himself in a diverse, economically-challenged community that feels worlds apart from his previous hometowns. Admittedly, the White family and the students have a lot to learn from each other -- but when Coach White notices the boys' exceptional running ability, things begin to change. Soon something beyond their physical gifts impresses White - the power of family relationships, their unwavering commitment to one another, and their incredible work ethic. With grit and determination, Coach White's unlikely band of runners eventually overcome the odds to forge not only a championship cross-country team, but an endearing legacy as well. Along the way, Jim and his family realize that they finally found a place to call home and both he and his team achieve their own kind of American dream.
