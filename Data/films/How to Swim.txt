==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*Goofy emerging from behind the beach-themed wall and going over to adjust a piano stool.
*Goofy "swimming" back toward the house and laying on his back, floating, resulting in him not seeing where is going and crashing into the bathtub.
*The entire scene of Goofy first arriving at the beach, struggling to dress in the locker, which falls in the water, and, inside a huge bubble underwater, having a picnic, only for the bubble to disappear from being pierced by Goofy's umbrella, so that Goofy gets cramps in the water.
*The initial moment of the stick figure drawing diving into the water, before Goofy attempts the same.
*Goofy putting on the swimming tube.
