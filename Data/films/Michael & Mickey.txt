'''''Michael & Mickey''''' is a 1991 short film produced as an outro for the [[Disney MGM Studios]] [[Backstage Pass|Inside the Magic: Special Effects and Production Tour]] walkthrough attraction, playing in the Walt Disney Theater at the end of the tour before previews of upcoming Disney films. 

An edited version would serve as the introduction for ''The Best of Disney: 50 Years of Magic'' television special that same year.

A clip from this special became an internet meme in late 2021.

== Summary ==
Greeting viewers from his office, Michael Eisner tells the audience that he is going to bring them to a screening of material from an upcoming movie. Mickey sneaks up behind him and playfully covers his eyes as part of a guessing game before the two check their watches (Michael wearing a Mickey Mouse watch and Mickey wearing a Michael Eisner watch) and make their way to the screening theater. A procession of Disney characters, animated and costumed, join them on their way to the theater. As Mickey takes his seat, [[Chernabog]] rises in the seat in front of him to terrify Mickey, only for Eisner to casually tell him he's blocking their view, causing him to cower in fear and get out of the way.

When the film preview ended, Mickey, Eisner and their audience would say farewell to the guests and get back to making movie magic.
