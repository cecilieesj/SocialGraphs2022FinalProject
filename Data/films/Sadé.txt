==Synopsis==
''Sadé'' centers on a young African girl named Sadé who, when her kingdom is threatened by a mysterious evil force, accepts her newly discovered magical warrior powers to protect herself and her people. With the help of the kingdom’s prince, Sadé embarks on an adventure that will allow her to embrace what makes her special and save the kingdom.<ref name="Deadline" />

==Trivia==
*This will be the first Disney feature that is led by an African princess. Although [[Tiana]] from ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' is also of African descent, she is African-American and thus does not count.
