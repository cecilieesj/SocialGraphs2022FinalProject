'''''The Simpsons: Welcome To The Club''''' is a ''Simpsons'' short special released on [[September 8]], [[2022]] on [[Disney+]].

==Plot==
The short begins when [http://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Bart_Simpson Bart Simpson] (secretly [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] in disguise) takes [http://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson Lisa] to a park where she would be a princess which Lisa feels unsure of going there which Lisa suddenly changes her mind of becoming a princess where the she arrives at the Enchanted Staircase section, only for the staircase to become flat where she ends up in a secret chamber. Lisa encounters a mysterious figure whom she confuses for "[[Snow White]]" but the figure is none other than [[The Evil Queen]] in her hag form, followed by other [[Disney Villains]] approaching Lisa consisting of [[Captain Hook]], [[Ursula]], [[Cruella De Vil]], [[Hades]], [[Scar]], and [[Kaa]] approaching her and this area is none other than Disney Villain Land. Kaa tells Lisa to join the villains which Lisa refuses, much to the Evil Queen and Cruella telling her to join the Disney Villains. Ursula then explains to Lisa that villains get to sing their own musical number just as Ursula, Hook, Cruella, and Kaa sing to Lisa about what it is like to be a villain. Throughout the song, various princes appear and join in only for the song to be interrupted by [[Mickey Mouse]]. The princes, along with [[Doc]] and [[Sneezy]], then apologize and lie on the ground to form the shape of Mickey's head.

== Voice Cast ==

* [[Nancy Cartwright]] as [http://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Bart_Simpson Bart Simpson] and [[Mickey Mouse]]
** Cartwright also voiced [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], while he was disguised as Bart
* [[Yeardley Smith]] as [http://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson Lisa Simpson] and [[Snow White]]
* [[Chris Edgerly]] as [[Prince Charming]] and Disney princes

* [[Dawnn Lewis]] as [[Kaa]] and [[Ursula]]
* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]]

==Trivia==
*At the beginning of the short when Bart explains to Lisa about the theme park in a plan to make her a princess, the statues seen there consist of [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]], [[Elsa]], and [[Tiana]] which are seen outside the castle.
**The three statues reference the statues of the Seven Dwarves at the Team Disney building at the headquarters of The Walt Disney Company in Burbank, California.
*This marks the first time [[Kaa]] appears in animation since ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]'' 19 years prior, and the second time he was voiced by someone other than [[Jim Cummings]].
*Similar to ''[[The Simpsons in Plusaversary]]'', none of the original voice actors of the Disney Villains returned to reprise their roles, including [[Pat Carroll]] (who died two months before this short was finished). However, [[Tress MacNeille]] does reprise her role as the Queen of Hearts, whom she has voiced in official Disney media since 1983.
**MacNeille also voiced the Evil Queen's hag form in ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' episode "[[Once Upon an Apple]]".
***Additionally, she voiced Cruella in two episodes of ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]''.
*In the end credits, [[Kaa]] has Homer tangled up in his coils which was reused from ''The Simpsons'' episode "Stop or My Dog Will Shoot" where Homer got tangled up in the coils of a python named Strangles. Unlike [[The Jungle Book|''The Jungle Book'']] and [[The Jungle Book 2|its sequel]], Homer's eyes are not in swirling colors as [[Mowgli]] and [[Shanti]] had when being hypnotized by Kaa.

**[[Maleficent]] and [[Diablo]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.
**[[Jafar]] from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''.
**[[Queen of Hearts]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.
*Cameos seen during the musical sequence:
**[[The Prince]] from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' appears in a magic mirror during Captain Hook's verse.
**The Prince from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', [[Prince Phillip]], [[Aurora]], [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]] from ''Sleeping Beauty'', [[Prince Edward]] from ''[[Enchanted]]'', [[Prince Eric]] from ''The Little Mermaid'', and [[Prince Charming]] from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', appear during the princes part of the musical sequence.
**At the end of the song, [[Doc]] and [[Sneezy]] from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' briefly appear, followed by cameos of [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse]].
