==Synopsis==
In a world where culture has nearly ceased to exist, one lone Mexican-American struggling to carry on her traditions unknowingly summons a dark and ancient creature to protect her.

==Plot==
In an alternate world, ethnic culture has greatly diminished. A tour bus passes by an elderly tamale vendor named Chepa who speaks an "ancient language" (actually basic Spanish) which amuses and shocks tourists who toss coins at her. Chepa is considered the last of her people who still celebrates Mexican culture. While at home indulging in her cultural roots, an earthquake knocks a photo of her mother off her ofrenda. She cries and prays for help and her tears drip through a puppet of the ancient creature, the Chupacabra, and through the floor creating a spell of some kind. At her door, a living wooden puppet version of the creature appears and after giving it aid, invites it inside. Chepa feeds and later dances with the Chupacabra; happy to finally have some company she surmises that she does not need to care about the world outside and falls asleep on her sofa with it.

In the morning, the Chupacabra beckons Chepa to take her tamale cart out again. Despite her refusal to do so, she decides to go out to please the Chupacabra. Once again, the tour bus arrives with the guide directing the people to Chepa. However, the Chupacabra roars at them, causing everyone including the guide to react in fear. The Chupacabra hops off the cart and runs across the street to Chepa's neighbor, an eldery Chinese woman named Nainai who had earlier looked reluctant to acknowledge Chepa. Nainai leaves her house where it is revealed that she has a living puppet version of a Nian. The Nian and the Chupacabra playfully interact with each other as a small child looks out from the bus; amazed at the sight of the creatures. As the bus leaves, Chepa and Nainai laugh together at seeing their respective cultural creatures uniting.
