| Notes                   = * This film was officially given the green light for production after overwhelming positive reaction to test footage of the film that was leaked online. Additionally, the same footage was recreated into a scene for the film.
*Reynolds, himself, confirmed that this incarnation of Deadpool is not connected to [[Wade Wilson (Earth-10005)|Weapon XI]] from ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (film)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-green-lantern-2-benm-156821/|title=Ryan Reynolds: ‚ÄòDeadpool‚Äô Not Connected to ‚ÄòX-Men Origins'; Talks ‚ÄòGreen Lantern 2‚Ä≤|last=Moore|frst=Ben|work=screenrant.com|date=28 Feb 2012|accessdate=12 Jan 2016}}</ref>
| Trivia                  = * Footage shown at San Diego Comic-Con 2015 shows Wade Wilson telling the people who turn him into Deadpool not to make his costume "green or animated." Ryan Reynolds, who portrays Deadpool, previously portrayed [[w:c:dc:Hal Jordan (Green Lantern Movie)|Hal Jordan]] in the 2011 film ''[[w:c:dc:Green Lantern (Movie)|Green Lantern]]''. The movie was poorly-received by fans and critics alike, with Reynolds' fully-CGI Green Lantern costume being a target of much criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2211046/deadpool-comic-con-trailer/|title=The 'Deadpool' Trailer Just Premiered And We're Dying With Laughter|last=Wickman|frst=Kase|work=MTV.com|date=11 July 2015|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>
* Stan Lee's cameo in the film is his first cameo in a 20th Century Fox/Marvel film since ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (film)|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' in 2007.
* Earlier drafts of this film's script feature several comic book characters that did not make the final cut of the film:
** [[Emrys Killebrew]], the scientist responsible for turning Wade Wilson into Deadpool in the comics, was supposed to be the mastermind behind the villains' plans in the film, but elements of his character were ultimately given to his henchman, Ajax, to simplify the story.<ref name="Two Cut">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Two-Classic-Deadpool-Characters-Were-Cut-From-Script-Why-111077.html|title=Two Classic Deadpool Characters That Were Cut From The Script, And Why|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|work=CinemaBlend|date=9 February 2016|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>
** Weasel assumed a role originally written for [[Patch]].<ref name="Two Cut"/>
** [[Wyre (Earth-616)|Wyre]], [[Kane|Garrison Kane]], and [[Sluggo]] were to be Ajax's henchmen, but, due to budgetary constraints, the three were combined into one character - [[Angel Dust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Deadpool-Was-Supposed-Have-Way-More-Villains-It-111867.html|title=Deadpool Was Supposed To Have Way More Villains In It|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|work=CinemaBlend|date=12 February 2016|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>
* This is the eighth Marvel film to be rated R, following ''[[Punisher: War Zone (film)|Punisher: War Zone]]''.
* This is the first film set in the [[Wikipedia:X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film universe]] in which neither Professor X nor Wolverine make an appearance. However, they are mentioned.
* The shot of the X-Jet leaving the mansion is the same shot used in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', just with a different X-Jet edited in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/deadpool-sneakily-reused-footage-from-x-men-the-last-stand/|title=Deadpool Sneakily Reused Footage From X-Men: The Last Stand|last=Wilding|first=Josh|work=We Got This Covered|date=27 May 2016|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>
* The post-credits scene of the film is a parody of the famous post-credits scene of ''[[Wikipedia:Ferris Bueller's Day Off|Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''.
