'''''Harold and His Amazing Green Plants''''' is an educational short produced as part of the Epcot Educational Media program. Exploring the process of how plants grow, it is a tie-in to [[The Land]] Pavilion and the [[Kitchen Kabaret]] attraction.

==Summary==
Harold is a lonely boy living in an apartment where everyone has a pet. Harold however, only has a tiny seed, and sees it as essentially a pet rock. One day however, three vegetables ([[The Colander Combo]] without their carnival gear) come to visit him and explain that he isn't getting the most out of his pet. They help him plant the seed in a pot of soil and explain the process of a plant's growth from a seed, photosynthesis, the purpose of flowers, and the vital role that plants play as a food source and in the ecosystem in general. Harold becomes inspired to keep more plants in his home and realizes he doesn't need a pet as fancy as the others in his apartment.
