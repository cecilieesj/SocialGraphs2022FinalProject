==Release==
''The King's Man'' had its world premiere in London, United Kingdom on December 7, 2021 and was theatrically released on December 22, 2021, its eighth proposed release date and more than two years after it was originally due to come out.

It was originally scheduled to be released on November 8, 2019, but was pushed back first to November 15, 2019, then to February 14, 2020, and then to September 18, 2020. The release date was again pushed back by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to February 26, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the delay of Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four films, ''The King's Man'' was moved up two weeks to February 12, 2021, before being moved again to March 12, 2021. In January 2021, the release date was delayed again to August 20, 2021. In March 2021, it was further delayed to the December 2021 date. The film will play in cinemas for 45 days before heading to digital platforms.

==Reception==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 43% based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Ralph Fiennes' solid central performance in ''The King's Man'' is done dirty by this tonally confused prequel's descent into action thriller tedium." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 77% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.

Steve Pulaski of ''Influx Magazine'' gave the film a "C-" letter-grade, calling it "the most ungentlemanly ''Kingsman'' movie yet."

*[[Tom Hollander]] previously played George V in BBC's TV movie ''The Lost Prince''.
