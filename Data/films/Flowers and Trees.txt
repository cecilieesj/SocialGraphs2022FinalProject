'''''Flowers and Trees''''' is a ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' that marked the first Disney animated short to be made in color. It was the first commercially released film to be produced in the full-color three-strip Technicolor process, after several years of two-color Technicolor films.

''Flowers and Trees'' was already in production as a black-and-white cartoon before [[Walt Disney]] saw Herbert Kalmus' three-strip Technicolor tests. Deciding that ''Flowers and Trees'' would make a perfect test for the process, he had the black-and-white footage scrapped, and had the short redone in color. The color ''Flowers and Trees'' was a commercial and critical success, winning the first [[Academy Awards won by Walt Disney Pictures|Academy Award for Animated Short Subjects]].

As a result of the success of ''Flowers and Trees'', all future Silly Symphonies cartoons were produced in three-strip Technicolor, and the added novelty of color helped to boost the series' previously disappointing returns. Disney's other cartoon series, the [[:Category:Mickey Mouse shorts|Mickey Mouse shorts]], were deemed successful enough not to need the extra boost of color, and therefore remained in black-and-white until 1935's The Band Concert.

Disney's exclusive contract with Technicolor, in effect until the end of 1935, forced other animators such as [[Ub Iwerks]] and Max Fleischer to use Technicolor's inferior two-color process or a competing two-color system such as Cinecolor.

==Synopsis==
It's spring, and the flowers, mushrooms, and trees do their calisthenics. Some trees play a tune, using vines for harp strings and a chorus of robins. A nasty looking hollow tree does battle with a much healthier looking tree for the attentions of a female tree, and starts a fire in the process.
