'''''Kim Possible''''' is a[[Disney Channel Original Movies| Disney Channel Original Movie]], based on the [[Kim Possible|animated series of the same name]]. The film follows the titular hero, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]], a typical high school girl who saves the world from evil villains with the help of her sidekick [[Ron Stoppable]], his naked mole-rat [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]], and computer genius [[Wade]]. A short teaser played during the premiere of ''[[Freaky Friday (2018 film)|Freaky Friday]]''. It was released on [[February 15]], [[2019]].

==Synopsis==
''Kim Possible'' begins as [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] and her best friend and sidekick, [[Ron Stoppable]], start [[Middleton High School]] where Kim must navigate an intimidating new social hierarchy. She is ready to tackle the challenge head-on, just as she has with everything else in life, but her confidence is shaken when she faces roadblocks at every turn—getting lost in the confusing hallways, being late to class and facing rejection during soccer tryouts from her frenemy, [[Bonnie Rockwaller|Bonnie]]. Kim's day starts to turn around when she and Ron meet and befriend [[Athena (Kim Possible)|Athena]], a new classmate and Kim Possible superfan who is having an even worse day than Kim. With Kim's guidance and friendship, Athena transforms into the newest member of [[Team Possible]]. Soon, Athena starts to eclipse Kim just as the nefarious [[Dr. Drakken|Drakken]] and [[Shego]] resurface in Middleton with a master plan to finally stop Kim. Now it is up to Team Possible—Kim, Ron, tech-genius [[Wade]], new friend Athena and [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]], a naked mole-rat that Ron meets along the way—to stop these super villains.

==Plot==
In Europe, American high school students and crimefighters Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable have thwarted a world dominating scheme of [[Professor Dementor]] and rescued his captive Dr. Glopman.

As Kim and Ron start their first day of school, Kim meets her old childhood friend Bonnie, who states that the school doesn't do cheerleading but soccer. Kim tries out for the soccer team but Bonnie demotes her to being the team's equipment manager as freshmen can't be on the team. They later meet a new student named Athena and take her on a mission to stop the plot of the evil Dr. Drakken. Athena defeats Dr. Drakken's abettor Shego, making her the topic of conversation at Middleton High School despite Kim's jealousy. When the school honors Athena and her good deed, Shego and Dr. Drakken force their way into the ceremony. Kim tries to defeat Shego and her army of henchwomen but falls to the ground, leaving Athena vulnerable to capture. Athena is taken away and Kim is laughed at. After Kim talks with her family and Ron, they decide to rescue Athena from Drakken's and Shego's lair.

At the lair, however, Kim discovers Athena is part of Drakken's and Shego's plan to copy/steal Kim's motivational essence and transfer it into Drakken using his brain-modulating device. Athena is revealed to be a gynoid built by Drakken, specifically for this. As Kim short-circuits the transfer machine, Dr. Drakken is turned into a pre-adolescent version of himself. Despite Kim's insistence that she leaves with them and save herself, Athena stays behind to turn off the now-unstable machine. The lair explodes and Athena is presumed killed but it is revealed that she has survived the explosion but her robotic parts are scattered. Kim and Ron take her home to be repaired and programmed to be a hero alongside themselves as they try to go back to their normal lives. As they go back to high school, Kim, Ron, and Athena form a martial arts club with the rest of the class joining, except Bonnie who is infuriated as she walks away humiliated.

However, during the credits, Dr. Drakken, posing as a gifted student with Shego posing as his mother, enrolls at Kim's high school and begins his plan to defeat her, thus setting up the events of the [[Kim Hushable]] shorts.

==Trivia==

*This is also the first live-action adaptation based on a Disney animated series.
*[[Christy Carlson Romano]] (who voiced Kim in the animated series) makes a cameo appearance as Poppy Blu.
*[[Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Patton Oswalt]] reprise their roles as [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]] and [[Professor Dementor]] from the animated series, respectively. They are the third and fourth actors to reprise their roles for a Disney live-action adaptation of a previous Disney animated production after both [[Jim Cummings]] and [[Brad Garrett]], both of who reprised [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tigger]] (also voiced by Cummings since the late 1980s), and [[Eeyore]] (whom Garrett voiced previously in ''[[Animated StoryBook: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'' and recently in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'') in [[2018]]'s ''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]''.
**Patton Oswalt is also the second actor to reprise the role of an animated character as a human (as opposed to a computer-animated character), following [[Jonathan Freeman]] playing [[Jafar]] in the [[Aladdin (musical)|''Aladdin'' musical]].
*Kim's original mission outfit from the series can be seen among Kim's gadgets.<ref>[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/7/71/Kim_Possible_%28film%29_%2896%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20190125172835]</ref> It was revealed that the live-action iteration of the character stopped using the outfit because it felt "cartoonish".
*The movie is somewhat similar to the old ''Spy Kids'' films.
*The origin of how Ron and Rufus meet is out of canon. In the film, Ron finds Rufus in a science lab where he lives in a terrarium for naked mole-rats, while in "A Sitch in Time", Ron buys Rufus at the [[Smarty Mart]] during his preteen years.
*Kim's Rocket Booster Day sweatshirt from "[[Monkey Ninjas in Space]]" can be seen hanging on Kim's wall in her room.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/dana_brookexx/status/1089711923753611266|title=Dana Brooke post|website=Twitter|accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>
*The film is seen as a reboot rather than a continuation.
*According to Adam Stein, the scene of Shego stalking Athena was inspired by the Raptor scene from ''Jurassic Park''.
*This is one of few DCOMs to end on a cliffhanger, with others being ''[[Upside-Down Magic]]'', ''[[Girl vs. Monster]]'', ''[[Teen Beach Movie]]'', and ''[[Zapped]]''.
*This is the second [[Disney Channel Original Movies|Disney Channel Original Movie]] that Zach Lipovsky one of the directors of ''[[Kim Possible (film)|Kim Possible (2019)]]'' has been apart of. Zach Lipovsky played Matt in ''[[Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century]]'' 20 years before.
