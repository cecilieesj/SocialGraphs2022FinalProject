'''''Clown of the Jungle''''' is a ''[[Donald Duck]]'' cartoon released in [[1947]]. It marks the first short film the [[Aracuan Bird]] (first seen in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'') appeared in. The cartoon was directed by Jack Hannah with music by Oliver Wallace.

==Synopsis==
Donald Duck is visiting the jungle to photograph its tropical birds, but things take a turn for the worse when Donald encounters the Aracuan Bird.

==Trivia==
*The hammer sound from "[[Roustabouts (song)|Roustabouts]]", can be heard when Donald and the Aracuan are hammering a nail.
*On ''The Chronological Donald, Volume Three'', the opening theme uses the cut-short 1947 Donald Duck theme instead of the first Mickey Mouse theme it originally used.
**The reason it uses the early '40s Mickey Mouse theme was because the 1947 Donald Duck theme was not finished yet. It would not be used until [[Donald's Dilemma]].
*Television airings on the [[Disney Channel]] and [[Toon Disney]] removed all the scenes involving the Aracuan attempting suicide, and the scene near the end when Donald tries to shoot the bird with a machine gun.
*When Donald goes insane and starts acting like the Aracuan at the very end, he breaks the fourth wall by walking along the black iris and shrinking with it.
