'''''Planes''''' is a [[2013]] theatrical spin-off of the [[2006]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film, ''[[Cars]]'' and its two sequels, ''[[Cars 2]]'' ([[2011]]) and ''[[Cars 3]]'' ([[2017]]), and the first film in the ''Planes'' duology. [[Pixar Animation Studios]], the production team of the ''Cars'' movies, however, did not produce the film. Instead, it was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]].<ref name="Collider">[http://collider.com/planes-direct-to-dvd-cars-spin-off/76676/ Disney Officially Announces PLANES, a Direct-to-DVD Spin-Off of Pixar's CARS]</ref> It was set to be released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on DVD and Blu-ray in fall 2013, but it instead had a theatrical release by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on [[August 9]], 2013.<ref name="CSRelease">[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=98312 Disney Sets Cars Spinoff Planes for a Theatrical Release]</ref><ref name="bom" /> It is the first Disneytoon Studios film released theatrically in North America since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'', which was released 8½ years earlier in [[2005]].

==Plot==
The movie starts with two jets soaring through the sky. From below comes a young crop duster named Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook). He challenges the two to a race, but they ignore him and fly away. He then zooms right past them to their amazement, though he wakes up from this fantasy, and it is shown he is just crop dusting a field with his employer Leadbottom (Cedric the Entertainer). Dusty expresses his dream to enter the Wings Across the Globe Rally, an air racing competition where planes fly all around the world, but Leadbottom thinks he's better off where he's at.

Dusty meets up with his best friend, a fuel truck named Chug (Brad Garrett). Together, they practice flying for the race, but Dusty accidentally burns himself out. Their forklift friend Dottie (Teri Hatcher) knows what he has been doing, and she thinks Dusty is gonna get himself killed if he tries to race. Chug suggests asking an older war veteran plane, Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), to help Dusty practice. They go see Skipper, but he almost instantly turns Dusty away.

The next day, Dusty, Chug, and Dottie go to the qualifiers to enter Dusty. There, they spot reigning champion Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith), showing off for his fans. When Dusty steps up to qualify, he is mocked for being a crop duster and coming from a farm. He surprises nearly everybody as he flies through the course with well-practiced maneuvers, but he only ends up placing sixth. He and his friends leave disappointed.

Forklift commentator Roper (Sinbad) visits Dusty the next day to tell him that one of the racers, Fonzarelli, has been disqualified for using illegal fuel, putting Dusty in the race. Skipper finds Dusty and tries to talk him out of racing, due to the fact that he wasn't built to race, but Dusty insists that he wants to prove that he is more than just a crop duster. This convinces Skipper to train him. They spend some time together practicing, which starts out awful. Although Dusty starts improving, it goes sour when Skipper tries to get him to fly above 1000 feet. Dusty gets dizzy when he looks down, and confesses that he is afraid of heights. Skipper is baffled, but they continue practicing anyway.

The time comes for the race, with the first leg starting in New York going to Iceland. Dusty meets the eccentric Mexican plane El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui; "El Chu" for short), who quickly becomes friends with Dusty. Dusty also becomes smitten by a plane from India named Ishani (Priyanka Chopra), while El Chu falls for French-Canadian Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). The racers fly off to Iceland, but since Dusty refuses to fly high with everybody else, he is last.

The second leg has the racers fly to Germany. A British plane named Bulldog (John Cleese) is blinded when oil from his propellers squirts in his eye. Dusty guides him down to safety, which earns him Bulldog's respect, but he is still in the last place. The third leg takes them to India, where at one point, Dusty and Ishani have a romantic fly around the area. Ishani knows that she has fans who are counting on her to win. She offers some advice to Dusty on flying through a tunnel for the next leg, which has the racers fly to Nepal. Dusty encounters a tunnel and almost collides head-on with a train. He blacks out for a while, landing in Nepal, initially thinking he is dead. Turns out he has managed to place first. The other racers come in, and Dusty notices that Ishani has a new propeller from Ripslinger, leading him to realize she was setting him up for a loss and almost killing him. Ripslinger himself is displeased when he learns that he is now second behind Dusty.

When the racers land in Shanghai, El Chu expresses to Dusty that he is having trouble winning over Rochelle. She is not impressed with his pompous attempts at winning her over. He tries to serenade her with an aggressive rendition of "[[Love Machine]]", but Dusty tells him to take it down a notch. Some forklifts pull in and play a softer version of the song with El Chu singing along. This gets Rochelle's attention.

El Chu comes to Dusty with multiple lipstick stains on his face on the way to the next location, meaning he and Rochelle are now together, and the plan worked a little too well. The racers take off over the Pacific Ocean. While Dusty is flying, Ripslinger has his two New Zealand teammates and henchmen, Ned and Zed (Gabriel Iglesias), sabotage Dusty by taking out his navigation antenna, leaving him lost across the ocean. He begins to run low on fuel as he is picked up by a group of planes known as the Jolly Wrenches. They take him to their carrier ship, the USS Dwight D.  Flysenhower, where he lands and is able to refuel. He spots a wall of famed flyers and starts looking for Skipper. He spots him but is surprised to see he only has one badge from one mission, realizing that Skipper lied to him about his war record. He gets in touch with Chug and Dottie, who tell him that they will meet him in Mexico since Chug and Skipper's forklift Sparky (Danny Mann) have sold a lot of Dusty-themed merchandise. Dusty asks Skipper if he only flew one mission, and Skipper was forced to confess that he did. The Jolly Wrenches make him fly out of there to beat the oncoming storm. In Mexico, Ripslinger was asked by the press about Dusty's disappearance and started to make insulting comments about Dusty. Ishani and El Chu, knowing that Ripslinger had something to do with Dusty's disappearance, calls him out by telling him that Dusty has ten times the engine and integrity he does and that he ''used'' to be a great champion. 

While flying in the storm, Dusty is distracted when he thinks about Skipper and crashes into the ocean. He is rescued and is met by his friends. However, he is badly damaged and is told that he must pull out of the race. When Dusty demands an answer from Skipper about why he had lied to him in the first place, Skipper reveals that his entire squadron was killed in action against an enemy battleship on his first mission, as he was the only one who survived. Dusty then considers dropping out of the race, but Chug and Dottie encourage him to continue. Additionally, the friendly racers offer repair parts for Dusty to continue to race alongside them. Dusty is fixed up and looking brand new, ready to re-enter.

Dusty manages to outfly the other racers on the final leg, coming in behind Ripslinger, Ned, and Zed. Ripslinger has his goons go sabotage Dusty again, but Skipper flies in to protect Dusty. He gets Ned and Zed away from him (at the cost of getting his Vertical Stabilizer damaged by Ripslinger) and tells Dusty to continue flying and forget about him, leaving him to catch up with Ripslinger. Dusty starts losing power, forcing him to tackle his fear of heights and soar high above Ripslinger. When they make it to the end of the track, Ripslinger slows down to pose for cameras, allowing Dusty to fly past him and cross the finish line. To his surprise, Ripslinger flies into some portable toilets, leaving him humiliated by being covered in oil slop. Everybody celebrates Dusty's victory, including Ishani, El Chu, and the other racers. Skipper rejoins the Navy, and Dusty is made an honorary Jolly Wrench. The two take off and race each other across the ocean.

==Production==
''Planes'' is based on a concept created by [[John Lasseter]].<ref name="THRReview">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/planes/review/600352 Planes: Film Review]</ref> Although Pixar did not produce the film, Lasseter, being chief creative officer of both Pixar and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], and director of ''Cars'' and ''Cars 2'',<ref name="awn1">[http://www.awn.com/news/voice-acting/jon-cryer-leads-voice-cast-disneytoons-planes Jon Cryer Leads Voice Cast For DisneyToon's Planes]</ref> was also the executive producer of the film.<ref name="blog1" /><ref name="USAPeek">[http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/03/25/planes-dane-cook/1998599/ Look!

Lasseter had this to say about the film:
{{Quote|We had such a great time exploring the world of ''Cars'' over the course of two films, so it seemed only natural for us to see where our imaginations would take us in a film where planes were the main characters. By expanding the ''Cars'' world, ''Planes'' gave us a whole new set of fun-filled situations and a great opportunity to introduce some fantastic new characters. The team at DisneyToon Studios has done such an amazing job creating a heartfelt story filled with great comedy, adventure, and emotion. I know audiences are going to love taking off into the wild blue yonder with these daredevil characters, as they experience a whole new kind of animated adventure.<ref name="Collider" />|John Lasseter}}

On August 20, 2011 at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], it was announced that Jon Cryer would be the voice of the protagonist Dusty.<ref name="awn1" /><ref name="blog1" /> However, Cryer dropped out of production and was replaced by Dane Cook.<ref name="DaneCook" /><ref name="CS" /><ref name="hwr" /> On February 27, 2013, the teaser trailer was re-released with dialogue from Cook instead of Cryer.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=100894 New Trailer for Disney's Planes Flies In]</ref> Jon Cryer did however receive credit for "additional story material" for the film, along with Bobs Gannaway.<ref>[http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/planes/5058932.article Planes Review]</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Planes'' received mostly unfavorable to negative reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 25% approval rating with an average rating of 4.6/10 based on 116 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "''Planes'' has enough bright colors, goofy voices, and slick animation to distract some young viewers for 92 minutes -- and probably sell plenty of toys in the bargain -- but on nearly every other level, it's a Disney disappointment."<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/planes/ Planes (2013)]</ref> Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 39 based on 32 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref name="MC">[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/planes Planes]</ref> However, the film earned an A− from audiences polled by CinemaScore.<ref name="DeadlineWeekend">[http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/were-the-millers-opens-to-1-7m-late-shows/ Friday: 'Elysium' #1, 'We're The Millers' #2, 'Planes' #3, 'Percy Jackson: Monsters' #4]</ref>

Peter Hartlaub of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' gave the film two and half stars out of four, saying, "Many will enter theaters thinking this is a Pixar film, with the raised expectations that accompany that mistake. But even cynical animation fans will see there's quality here. After a little turbulence, ''Planes'' comes in for a nice landing."<ref>[http://www.sfchronicle.com/movies/article/Planes-review-Familiar-plot-achieves-lift-off-4717566.php?t=4d0c53680647b02379 'Planes' review: Familiar plot achieves lift-off]</ref> Alonso Duralde of ''The Wrap'' gave the film a positive review, saying, "As shameless an attempt by Disney to sell more bedspreads to the under-10s as ''Planes'' is, it nonetheless manages to be a minor lark that will at least mildly amuse anyone who ever thrust their arms outward and pretended to soar over the landscape."<ref>[http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/planes-review-much-more-fun-being-stuck-cars-108301 'Planes' Review: More Fun, at Least, Than Being Stuck in 'Cars']</ref> Justin Chang of ''Variety'' gave the film a negative review, saying, "''Planes'' is so overrun with broad cultural stereotypes that it should come with free ethnic-sensitivity training for especially impressionable kids."<ref>[http://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-planes-1200575126/ 'Planes' Review: Disney’s 'Cars' Spinoff Is a Clunker]</ref> James Rocchi of ''MSN Movies'' gave the film one out of five stars, saying, "''Planes'' borrows a world from ''Cars'', but even compared to that soulless exercise in well-merchandised animated automotive adventure, ''Planes'' is dead in its big, googly eyes and hollow inside."<ref>[http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-critic-reviews/disney%27s-planes/#Review_0 Disney's Planes (2013)]</ref> Michael Rechtshaffen gave the film a negative review, saying, "Despite the more aerodynamic setting, this ''Cars'' 3D offshoot emerges as an uninspired retread."<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/planes/review/600352 Planes Review]</ref> Jordan Hoffman gave the film one out of five stars, saying, "The jokes in ''Planes'' are runway flat, and parents will likely reach for the air-sickness bag."<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/planes-movie-review-article-1.1420181 ‘Planes,’ movie review]</ref>

Bill Goodykoontz of ''The Arizona Republic'' gave the film two out of five stars, saying, "''Planes'' was originally scheduled to be released straight to video. Although the smallest children might like bits and pieces of it, there's nothing in the movie that suggests why Disney strayed from its original plan."<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/20130808planes-movie-review.html#protected The Arizona Republic]</ref> David Hiltbrand of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' gave the film one out of four stars, saying, "The animated film has all the hallmarks of a straight-to-DVD project - inferior plot, dull writing, cheap drawing - perhaps because it was intended for the bargain bin at Target, Walmart, and Costco."<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20130809_Disney_s__Planes__crashes_and_burns.html Disney's 'Planes' crashes and burns]</ref> Jen Chaney of ''The Washington Post'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, "This film is 100 percent devoid of surprises. It's the story of an underestimated underdog that's like every other kid-friendly, life-coachy story about an underestimated underdog."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/planes-doesnt-earn-its-wings/2013/08/07/cba1cc92-ff6d-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html 'Planes' doesn't earn its wings]</ref> Rafer Guzman of ''Newsday'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, "If ''Planes'' were a reasonably priced download, you'd gladly use it to sedate your kids during a long car ride.

However, Ned and Zed broke off Dusty's GPS antenna, causing him to get lost in a storm. Running low on fuel, Dusty attempted to get to Hawaii but ended up 375 miles south of where he needed to go. Luckily, Bravo and Echo found Dusty and were able to bring him back to Flysenhower for fuel.

Inside Flysenhower's hangar, Dusty sees the Jolly Wrenches Wall of Fame. However, he notices that Skipper had only flown one mission in World War Two, contrary to the many stories he had told Dusty earlier.

*This is the first Disneytoon film to be a successor to a Pixar film. Previous productions focused on mainly Disney properties.
*This is the only film in the ''Cars'' franchise not to involve [[Brad Paisley]].
*This film marks the last theatrical DisneyToon Studios film to be produced in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. This is also the only theatrical film in the ''Cars'' franchise to be produced in that aspect ratio, since all of the other films (including the [[Planes: Fire & Rescue|sequel]]) are produced in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.
*On July 14, 2013, Disney Channel held a "Night of Flight" event, featuring sneak peeks at new characters from the movie, during its "Night of Premieres" lineup, which included all-new episodes of its programs.
*When Dusty explains to Skipper about wanting to prove of being more than just a crop duster, one of the ''Cars 2'' [[Porto Corsa]] vintage artworks can be seen on the wall.
*The missions flown by the Jolly Wrenches are: Alameda Ridge, The Aleutians, Assault on Kunming, Assault at Olive Ridge, Attack of Tujunga Harbor, Battle of Airway, Battle of Balthazor Straights, Battle of Buena Vista, Battle of Draper Straits, Battle over Wake Island, Bridges of River Bradford, Campaign at Coral Sea, Campaign at Grandview Pass, Glendal Canal, Kenneth Canal Campaign, Raid of Howard Harbor, Raid on Milton Mountain, and Skirmish at Sonora Canal.
*The order in which the race is finished is: Dusty Crophopper (1st plane), Ripslinger (2nd place), El Chupacabra (3rd place), Rochelle (4th place), Bulldog (5th place), Ishani (6th place), with Antonio (7th place), Yellow Bird (8th place), and Van Der Bird (9th place).
*In the Brazilian version, El Chupacabra's love interest is different from the other versions. Instead, she is Carolina Santos, a Brazilian racer voiced by Brazilian singer [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivete_Sangalo Ivete Sangalo].
*This is also the second Disneytoon film to be scored by Mark Mancina after ''[[Tarzan II]]''. Ironically, Mancina previously composed the music scores for two [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] films (''[[Tarzan (film)|Tarzan]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]'') and the two Disney live-action films ''[[Man of the House]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|The Haunted Mansion]]''.
*This is the third and final Disneytoon film where mild language is used after the both G-rated ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in which [[Max Goof]] says "spaz" once) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]'' (in which [[Forte]] mentions "hell" during his song ''[[Don't Fall in Love]]''); Chug once says "freaking" profanely when Dusty is accepted to the race. This is another reason for the film's PG rating.
*The second [[Disneytoon Studios]] film to be rated PG by the MPAA, after ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''.
*Cedric the Entertainer and John Cleese both starred in ''Charlotte’s Web''.

==Goofs==
*In one of the stories in the ''World of Cars'' book, the Statue of Liberty is a Ford Model T. However, in this film, it is a forklift.
*The designs of the world landmarks (such as the Taj Mahal - ताज महल, and the Great Wall of China - 万里长城) do not resemble how they do in the credits at the end of ''Cars 2'', as they were car-ified in that film. But here, they are plane-ified.
*Yellow Bird seems to have his number changed in different parts. The qualifier leaderboard and Yellow Bird's tent as well as his appearance in the Germany to India leg show his number as 17. In New York and on the leaderboard at the start of the China to Mexico leg, his number is 1.
*When Dusty and Ripslinger are talking to each other at the pit row in New York, Little King is seen behind Dusty. When Dusty explains to the racers about El Chupacabra, Little King is in his tent. However, it could be that Little King drove to his tent during the close-ups of El Chu.
*When Dusty explains to El Chupacabra about Rochelle before the New York to Iceland leg begins, the "D7" and Jolly Wrenches insignia on Dusty are missing.
*When Dusty is escorted by Bravo and Echo to Dwight D. Flysenhower, his GPS antenna that Zed broke off is back on. It then disappears after they reach the Flysenhower.
*When the camera moves around the Flysenhower at the end of the film, there is a barrier fully surrounding the aircraft elevator/lift with Dusty and Skipper. In the close-up (when the elevator reaches the flight deck), the barrier has disappeared. The barrier should only retract into the deck of the lift once it reaches the flight deck (and not before), as it is to stop people and aircraft going over the edge.
*When El Chupacabra gives Dusty new wings, both of them have a #7 painted on them. But when Dusty passes Ripslinger, the viewers can see that only one wing has the #7.
*When Dusty was commenting about Ishani's propeller while in the pit row at John F. Kennedy International Airport, LJH 86 Special can be seen in Sun Wing's tent. However, he does not appear in there again after that and is replaced by Sun Wing.
*When the planes are getting ready before the race starts, Bulldog, El Chupacabra, and Ishani can be seen with their propellers spinning in the long shots but a few scenes later, they start spinning them in close-up.
