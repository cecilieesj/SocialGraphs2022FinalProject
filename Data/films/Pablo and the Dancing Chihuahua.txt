"'''Pablo and the Dancing Chihuahua'''" is a [[1968]] telefilm produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]]. It was originally broadcast on [[NBC]] as a two-part episode on ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' on [[January 28]], and [[February 4]], 1968. The telefilm was directed by Walter Perkins. In [[1972]], the program was released theatrically in the [[United Kingdom]] as a supporting feature to a re-release of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

==Synopsis==
A recently orphaned boy living in Mexico has one item that would link him to family, an old letter from an uncle with an address in Tucson, AZ. He set out across country and desert to locate this uncle in Tucson. At the border he was unwillingly linked up with a small chihuahua. The story is of their experiences as they made their trek across the desert, some funny and others harrowing. They encountered friendly people to aggressive Javelinas. They never found Pablo's uncle, but in the end they did find a loving family. 
Pablo and his "dancing" Chihuahua travel through 1800s Mexico seeking a relative. Through the "wilderness" Pablo and dog encounter curious characters and animals. Having seen the original airing and its repeat, I recall the distinct detail where Pablo and dog manage to quench thirst with cactus milk. While this film is probably hidden with ''[[Song of the South]]'' in Disney' "film vault", it is a dramatic piece and classic 1960s television.
