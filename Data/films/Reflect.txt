'''Reflect''' is an animated short film produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in the ''[[Short Circuit]]'' series that was released as a [[Disney+]] exclusive on [[September 14]], [[2022]].

==Synopsis==
A ballet dancer battles her own reflection, overcoming doubt and fear by channeling her inner strength, grace and power.

==Plot==
A young plus-sized child is performing her ballet moves when the other students and teacher enter. This causes the girl to become rather self-conscious as she tries to follow the teacher's instructions. She suddenly enters a fantasy where the mirror on the wall begins to glow and detaches itself into a giant claw that envelopes her. Surrounded by a shattered mirror, the girl becomes hopelessly lost until she remembers her ballet moves and the mirror begins to retract. The more she dances, the more the mirror begins to fade away. Eventually, the girl finds herself back in reality and continues to happily dance with her classmates. During the credits, images depict the girl dancing on her own. When the other students see her, they join in.
