'''''Legend of the Chihuahua''''' is an animated short exclusively released in the [[2009]] DVD/[[Disney Blu-ray|Blu-ray]] releases of the [[2008]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] live-action film, ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]''. It is a spin-off short which tells the origin of the Chihuahua through the style of animation and photo collage.

==Plot==
This short focuses on a Chihuahua, which dates back to the origins of the said dog breed. Some people believe this dog was introduced to the West by the Chinese while others say it was the Spaniards who introduced it. It is also believed that [[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Chihuahua by describing its characteristics during his travels to the New World. However, in fact, the Chihuahua's origins ''actually'' date back in the Ancient Americas to the ninth century, where the Chihuahua was known as Techichi, an ancestral relative of the Chihuahua which was loyal to the Toltecs at that time, served as a spiritual guide through the underworld, and was also used as a heat pack during the Mesoamerican civilization. The narrator then explains that the Chihuahua is the only breed of dog native to the Western Hemisphere, as Chihuahuas gained popularity from TV to movies, making it the 10th most popular dog breed. As the narrator explains about the Chihuahua being the smallest dog in the world, he explains that a Chihuahua's brain is the largest, which was the reason why Chihuahuas joined the Toltecs in battle and impressed the Spanish conquistadors, gaining the popularity of this dog breed. After telling the story, the narrator then explains to know who believes the Chihuahua might conquer next.

In Outer Space, the Chihuahua rides on a spaceship and notices an alien attacking his ship so he opens the airlock to rid the alien as the narrator bids the Chihuahua a good luck for the future.
