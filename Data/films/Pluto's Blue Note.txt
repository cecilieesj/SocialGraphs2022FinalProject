==Trivia==
*The song "[[You Belong to My Heart (Now and Forever)|You Belong To My Heart]]" which Pluto ''sings'' at the end was originally written and used in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]''.
**Also from the same film, the song that plays on the radio out in front of the music store is "[[Mexico (song)|Mexico]]".
*This cartoon marks the first (and to date, only) time where both of Pluto's love interests [[Fifi the Peke]] and [[Dinah the Dachshund]] are seen together, and is also Fifi's final appearance in animation until the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode "[[You, Me and Fifi]]" came out in 2019.
** Both Fifi the Peke and Dinah the Dachshund usually use the same dark brown fur in their respective cartoons, so a different coloring was given to Dinah here to indicate which one is whom; in this case she had a lighter brown fur color just like in the Pluto cartoon ''[[In Dutch|In Dutch]]''.
*When Pluto first puts his tail on a record, the music that plays is "[[Escravos de Jó|Caxangá]]", a traditional Brazilian song heard during the ''carnaval'' scene in ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''.
