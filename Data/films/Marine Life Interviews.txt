It was included as an exclusive bonus feature on the [[October 25]] Digital HD release and the [[November 15]] Blu-ray releases of ''Finding Dory''.

==Plot==
Residents of the [[Marine Life Institute]], [[Fluke and Rudder]], [[Destiny]], [[Hank]], and [[Bailey]] comment on [[Dory]] when she lived in the Marine Life Institute.

==Trivia==
*At the startup scene, [[A113]] can be seen briefly during the film leader countdown at "5" before the title appears.
*None of the actors who voiced the characters in this short are credited in the English version.
*Because [[Marlin]] and [[Nemo]] do not appear in this short, Dory is the only main character from the franchise to appear in this short. This makes it the first and only ''Finding Nemo'' production where Marlin and Nemo do not appear.
*This is the second movie-based [[Pixar]] short to be exclusively available on [[Blu-ray]], not on DVD, after ''[[Riley's First Date?]]''.
**Also, this short and ''[[Miss Fritter's Racing Skoool]]'' are the only ones released exclusively on Blu-ray that are currently not released on [[Disney+]] yet.
