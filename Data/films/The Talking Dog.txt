==Trivia==
*Some animation that was done on this short was dropped. It was animated for a pencil test.
*The animators, [[Fred Moore]] and [[Norman Ferguson]] would have both animated Pluto and Mickey.
*[[Pinto Colvig]], who had voiced [[Goofy]] and [[Pluto]] was upset for Pluto in the circus. Disney will not have the animated short, ''The Talking Dog'' and he wanted the animated short with Schaffer to ''Pluto's Party'' in 1952. Colvig's son, Vance Jr. told the crew of the studio ([[Ward Kimball]], Fred Moore, Norman Ferguson, [[Richard M. Sherman|The]] [[Robert B. Sherman|Sherman Brothers]], [[Thurl Ravenscroft]], [[Jimmy MacDonald]], [[Don DaGradi]], Bill Walsh, [[John Lounsbery]], [[George Nicholas]], [[Jack Hannah]], [[Jack Kinney]], [[Hamilton Luske]], [[Clarence Nash]], George Kreisl, Jerry Hatchcock, [[Bill Justice]], Robert W. Youngquist, [[Jack Boyd]], [[Charles A. Nichols|Charles Nichols]], [[Clyde Geronimi]], [[Cliff Edwards]], Lee Millar, and [[Paul Frees]]) that they wanted to do the animated TV musical film with Mickey Mouse and Jiminy Cricket. Disney told them and said, "All right. Do it for ''The Talking Dog'' in the feature movie with Mickey, Pluto, and Jiminy Cricket." He walked out the hallway in anger.
*Cliff Edwards who had voiced [[Jiminy Cricket]] in the [[1940]] animated feature, ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', wanted to get on the animated feature film, ''The Talking Dog'' and he didn't know about to do anything to Pluto.
*[[Walt Disney|Walt]] told an interviewer in 1951, "I'm tired of Mickey now. For him, it's definitely trap time. The Mouse and I have been together for about 22 years. That's long enough for any association."
