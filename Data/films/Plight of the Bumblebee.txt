}}'''''Plight of the Bumblebee''''' is an unfinished, and lost Disney animated [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] short produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|the Walt Disney Studios]] in [[1951]]. It was directed by [[Jack Kinney]].

==Synopsis==
[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] grooms a talented bee, Hector to be an opera star, but the bee gets drunk on nectar from the flowers on stage and ruins the show at the Opera House.

==Plot==
Mickey stumbles in the big city, where he finds a bee named Hector singing "bebop" (a bee who is jazz bopping), but notices that the bee occasionally hits a beautiful operatic note. Mickey decides the bee is destined for bigger things, and becomes his manager by signing him to a contract. However, he soon discovers that the reason Hector is singing in a malt shop is that he has a weakness for the flower's nectar.

In fact, whenever he has been drinking nectar, he becomes a sloppy "drunk". So, Mickey tries to keep Hector away from temptation. Unfortunately, for his operatic debut at the Opera House, the stage set is decorated with flowers and he overindulges, causing a female opera diva to faint in a fit causing chaos and ruining the show. After the performance, a defeated and heartbroken Mickey runs across a musical grasshopper outside and decides to try again.

==History==
In [[1981]], cartoonist [[Daan Jippes]] casually browsed through some index cards at the Disney Archives, and found some information about Production 2428 ("''Plight of the Bumblebee''"), including the location of three dusty boxes filled with stacks of animation by animators, [[Fred Moore]], [[Hal King]], John Sibley, and Cliff Nordberg, layouts, photographed storyboards, and exposure sheets. Also found, was the recorded soundtrack (with the final voices) on a transcription disc.

{{Quote|This big model sheet up here was all made from drawings that [Fred Moore] made forâ€¦ a featurette, called "''The Plight of the Bumblebee''." Mickey had a bee that could buzz operatic numbers, he was a great virtuoso that way. But the bee had a weakness, he was a "nectarholic": he'd get "drunk" on nectar, so Mickey had trouble controlling him this way. Fred got that picture about 90% animated, I understand, and [[Walt Disney|Walt]] dumped it because he got scared of the alcoholic connotations.|Disney Legend and comic strip artist [[Floyd Gottfredson]] stated during an interview.}}

==='''Legacy'''===
In [[2009]], the unfinished short was shown at the Disney Rarities panel at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]] in [[Anaheim]], [[California]].
