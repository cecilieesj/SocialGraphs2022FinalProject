'''A Magic Kingdom Yuletide Special''' is a half-hour Christmas special that originally aired on [[The Disney Channel]] in [[1985]].

==Synopsis==
[[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]] and the rest of their friends are celebrating the holidays. Unfortunately, [[Scrooge McDuck]] is not exactly in the celebratory mood, so Mickey and the gang attempt to change his mind about the magic of Christmas while celebrating the season.

Mickey and Minnie ice skate, with Frosty the Snowman joining the fun, though Scrooge is still unimpressed. Everyone then visits Santa's workshop, where the Seven Dwarfs work as [[Santa Claus]]'s helpers and it eventually winds up leading to the Nutcracker dance, performed by [[Baloo]], [[Br'er Bear]] and [[Liver Lips]]. The trip to the workshop ends with an encounter with a very familiar-looking Santa, played by [[Goofy]]. Santa/Goofy talks about his favorite day of the year (Christmas), but Scrooge attempts to muscle in and speak about ''his'' favorite day (payday).

Mickey and friends eventually do manage to convince Scrooge to enjoy the spirit of Christmas.
