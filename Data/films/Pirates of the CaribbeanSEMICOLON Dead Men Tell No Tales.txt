It was produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] once again, and Jeff Nathanson wrote the screenplay. It was released on [[May 26]], [[2017]].

==Synopsis==
Thrust into an all-new adventure, a down-on-his-luck Captain Jack Sparrow feels the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost sailors led by his old nemesis, the evil Captain Salazar, escape from the Devil's Triangle. Jack's only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it, he must forge an uneasy alliance with a brilliant and beautiful astronomer and a headstrong young man in the British navy.

==Plot==
13 years after the events of [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]], 12-year-old Henry Turner boards to the Flying Dutchman and inform his father, Will Turner, that the curse which binds Will to the Dutchman and only permit him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the [[Trident (Hercules)|Trident of Poseidon]]. Henry intend to recruit Jack Sparrow to help find it, but Will believes it's impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the Dutchman then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to find Jack and the Trident.

Nine years later, Henry is a sailor in the British Royal Navy. The ship sails into the supernatural Devil Triangle and stumbles upon the wreck of the Silent Mary, whose ghostly crew led by Spanish pirate hunter Captain Salazar attack. Salazar spares Henry's life to deliver a message to Jack: Salazar is coming for him.

In Saint Martin, a young astronomer and horologist named Carina Smyth is sentenced to death for witchcraft but escaped and briefly croses paths with Jack Sparrow as he and his crew spectacularly blunder a bank robbery. Having suffered a year of bad luck, Jack crew lost faith in their captain and desert him. Depressed Jack, trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass free Salazar and his crew from the Devil Triangle. Carina learn that Henry is looking for the Tridents location and offer to help him using her unknown farher diary. Carina and Jack are captured and face esecution, but are saved by Henry and Jack crew, setting seil on Dying Gull. Carina deciphers clues that the stars will lead to an Island where the Trident was hidden.

Meanwhile, Hector Barbossa heard from Mullroy and Murtogg that the revived Captain Salazar had killed several pirates at the seas and had destroyed his fleet. Barbossa manage to talk his way out of being killed by offering to help to find Jack and learn that the Trident could lead him to a new treasure. Salazar agree, wanting revenge on the pirate that caused his demise. Salazar pursues the Dying Gull, forcing Jack, Henry and Carina to flee to an Island, discovering that Salazar and his crew cannot go on land. After saving Jack from a forced marriage, Barbossa allies himself with Jack, returning his compass and restoring the miniaturized Black Pearl, trapped in a bottle from Blackbeard, to its original size. They all continue their journey to the Trident s Island, with Barbossa taking the command of the Pearl once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realized that Carina is the latter's long lost daughter. Barbossa tell Jack that he had left her in an orphanage with his diary so she could have a better life and refuse to tell the truth so she will continue to believe that his father was an astronomer. Approaching to the Trident Island, the Pearl evades a Royal Navy warship, which is destroyed by the Silent Mary before the Pearl run aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa and Carina use the Island magic to part the ocean and open a path to the Trident location on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and possesses him in order to walk on the ocean floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back, and Jack distracts Salazar, allowing Henry to break the Trident, breaking all the curses of the seas and restoring Salazar and his crew to life. However, the divided seas begins to collapse in on itself. The Pearl lowers its anchor to lift them to safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent to killing Jack. Carina realize finally that Barbossa is his father when she spotted a tattoo on his arm identical to the diary cover. Barbossa sacrificed himself to kill Salazar allowing the others to escape alive.

Sometime later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will Turner appears, free from the Dutchman. His wife, Elizabeth Swann appears moments later and the Turner family is officially reunited. Henry and Carina start to dating each other. Jack watches the scene from the Pearl before sailing away into the beloved horizon having being accepted by his crew as their captain once again, while also adopting Capitain Barbossa now-homeless [[Jack the Monkey|monkey]], who had obtained the compass for his new master.

In the post credit scene, Will and Elizabeth sleep in their bed together, when Will suddenly sees the claw of [[Davy Jones]]. It turned out to be a dream, but as he went back to sleep, several barnacles were found on the floor, indicating that Jones may have returned.

==Development==
In January 2011, Disney confirmed that [[Terry Rossio]] will write the screenplay for Pirates 5. In July 2011 [[Johnny Depp]] began negotiations to sign the contract.

In October [[2011]], [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] confirmed that they are working on a script. In an interview, [[Kevin McNally]] stated that a fall [[2012]] production start was possible. Because of the financial success of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]'', the film's director [[Rob Marshall]] might return for this addition to the series. On [[July 6]], 2011, [[Johnny Depp]] was reported to be close to a deal for the fifth film. Due to Depp's filming of ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (2013) they would not be filming the fifth installment until 2014. [[Orlando Bloom]] said he would like to return for a fifth film if he was offered. In August 2012 news that Depp signed on officially for the fifth film had surfaced.

In November 2012 Sunset, the ship which played the [[Black Pearl]] and the [[Queen Anne's Revenge]] in the second, third, and the later in the fourth film was docked into Long Beach [[California]] from Oahu, [[Hawaii]] where ''On Stranger Tides'' was filmed, waiting for her call up. In January 2013 Disney announced that [[Jeff Nathanson|rewrite]] ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales'' and that this would be released on [[July 10]], 2015.

In the fourth film, the cast and crew were told by Disney not to occupy their time in the near future, as the studio intends to shoot a fifth and sixth film back-to-back. However, it has since been stated that only a fifth film is in the works. On [[January 14]], 2011, it was confirmed that [[Terry Rossio]] will write the screenplay for the fifth installment, without his co-writer [[Ted Elliott]]. [[Johnny Depp]] said that he would be happy to return as [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] saying "As long as we can put all the puzzle pieces together, I would most definitely consider it." [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] said that the fifth film would be a stand-alone film. Speaking at the fourth film's press launch in Cannes, Depp said he would play the role for as long as it is popular with the public.

Disney has a wishlist of directors they would like to direct, as Rob Marshall has not yet accepted nor declined to direct. The list includes [[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Raimi]], Alfonso Cuaron, Shawn Levy, [[Chris Weitz]], and original ''Pirates'' director [[Gore Verbinski]]. Verbinski and Burton are Disney's top choices as they have both worked with Disney and Johnny Depp on numerous occasions. On July 6, 2011, Johnny Depp was reported to be close to a deal for the fifth film. In August 2012, news surfaced that Johnny Depp signed on officially for the fifth film. On January 11, 2013, Terry Rossio rewrite the film on the second draft of screenplay. On May 9, 2013, Deadline.com reported that Fredrik Bond, Rupert Sanders, Joachim Rønning, and Espen Sandberg were all shortlisted for directing the movie. On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Rønning and Sandberg from Norway would be directing the film. Production is slated to begin in Fall 2014 for a 2016 release.

On August 22, 2013, it was revealed that the title of the fifth film would be ''Dead Men Tell No Tales'', alluding to the line well-known from the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' theme park attractions. On September 11, 2013, Disney pushed back the release date of Pirates 5 until 2016 for script and budget issues and details for the film were rumored by Bleeding Cool, which includes a new female lead and troublemaker for Captain Sparrow who is suspected of witchcraft, which is a big part of the film, but she is actually a scientist, two new romantic leads from farming families, that get involved in Sparrow's plans, one of the film's leads is a ghost and a "former member of the British military now siding with Barbossa on a revenge mission", that gives the film its title. The film would start with an "awkward wedding" and concludes with "a riff on the myth of the Bermuda Triangle".<ref>[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-5-pushed-back-allegedly-over-script-issues-but-whats-it-all-about-anyway/ '''Bleedingcool.com''' - ''Pirates Of The Caribbean 5 Pushed Back'']</ref>

In March 2014, [[Bob Iger]] confirmed that the movie didn't have the greenlight just yet.

In an interview from April 4, 2014, Depp said that Bruckheimer and Disney had invited him in to collaborate with the writer Jeff Nathanson. He also said that he wants to bring a ''Pirates'' film that's very fresh and different for the people who saw the other ones. Depp also said that it might be the last one in the series.<ref>[http://www.m1905.com/video/play/745728.shtml]</ref>

On June 2014 Jerry Bruckheimer stated he hoped that the production of Pirates of the Caribbean 5 would begin in early 2015.

On 25 July 2014 Disney confirmed that Pirates of the Caribbean 5 will be released finally on 7 July 2017.

A spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot in [[Australia]] after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea''. According to Australian film industry sources, pre-production started in late September 2014 and filming is expected to commence in February 2015. This was officially confirmed by Disney and Ian Walker the Queensland Arts Minister on October 2, 2014, stating that filming will take place exclusively in Australia, being the largest production to ever shoot in the country. Village Roadshow Studios and Port Douglas were officially confirmed as filming locations.

On December 2014, Orlando Bloom told IGN that while he wasn't sure he'd be back, there were talks. He also mentioned a possible rebooting of the ''Pirates'' franchise, teasing a possible future film revolving around Will Turner and the relationship with his [[Henry Turner|son]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/16/orlando-bloom-says-pirates-of-the-caribbean-5-may-be-a-soft-reboot?abthid=5490638b31b1329844000007|title=ORLANDO BLOOM SAYS PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 5 MAY BE A SOFT REBOOT|publisher=IGN }}</ref>

On February 2015 the production begins with the return of Kevin McNally, Martin Klebba and Stephen Graham and actress Golshifteh Farahani confirmed to join in the cast and finish on July 2015 after 95 days of shooting. After nearly a year in post-production, reshoots and additional photography were conducted in Vancouver, Canada from March 24 to April 23, 2016.

During production, Johnny Depp and his then wife Amber Heard breached Australia's strict bio-security laws when they failed to declare their two dogs to the Australian Customs Service when they flew by private jet into Queensland, where filming was taken place. Heard was charged with two counts of illegally importing the dogs into the country and one count of producing a false document. In April 2016, Heard appeared in the Southport Magistrates Court and pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she was sleep deprived and made a mistake. The two bio-security charges were dropped, and she was placed on a one-month good behavior bond, paying a $1,000 fine for producing a false document. Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the bio-security laws. Australian newspaper The Guardian called the case the "highest profile criminal quarantine case" in Australian history.<ref>[[//www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/johnny-depp-fully-aware-of-breaking-australian-quarantine-with-dogs-tmg-court-papers-20170625-gwy2rw.html https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/johnny-depp-fully-aware-of-breaking-australian-quarantine-with-dogs-tmg-court-papers-20170625-gwy2rw.html]]</ref>
