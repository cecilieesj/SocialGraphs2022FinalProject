'''''The Nifty Nineties''''' is a Technicolor ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon released in [[1941]]. The short was directed by [[Riley Thomson]] and animated by [[Ward Kimball]], [[Walt Kelly]], [[Fred Moore]], Claude Smith, [[David Swift]], and [[Les Clark]] with effects animation by Art Fitzpatrick. The film stars Mickey and [[Minnie Mouse]] and romanticizes the decade of the 1890s.

The film features original and adapted music by [[Charles Wolcott]]. The voice cast includes [[Walt Disney]] as Mickey and Thelma Boardman as Minnie.

==Plot==
Set in the springtime, sometime in the 1890s, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] happen to meet each other in a public park one day. Minnie attracts Mickey by intentionally dropping her handkerchief so Mickey will return it to her.

They attend a vaudeville show where they first see a slideshow presentation called "Father, Dear, Father", which features the song "Come Home, Father" by Henry Clay Work. In the show, a daughter attempts to get her father to leave a local tavern because he hadn't come right home from work as promised and got drunk at the tavern. In the fourth picture in the slideshow, we see the clock tower, which reads 1:00 am. With mother home watching since tea and her son very sick in her arms, there can only be hope that the father comes home. The slideshow reduces Minnie to crying. Mickey tries to comfort her, telling her "Don't take it so hard. It's only a show".

The next act is "Fred & Ward, Two Clever Boys From Illinois" which features two song and dance men. [[Fred and Ward]] are caricatures of Disney animators [[Fred Moore]] and [[Ward Kimball]] who also voiced the characters.

After the show is over, Mickey and Minnie cruise the roads of the countryside in a Brass Era car. [[Goofy]] rides by on a penny-farthing bicycle, and [[Donald Duck]], [[Daisy Duck]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] ride on a bicycle built for five. At last, in a scene reminiscent of ''[[Plane Crazy]]'', the car crashes with a cow. Mickey and Minnie emerge from the wreckage unhurt, but when they try to kiss each other, the cow pops her head up between them.
