==Plot==
{{Quote|Once upon a time, a beautiful princess named [[Giselle]] was engaged to marry a [[Prince Edward|handsome prince]]... until the [[Nasira|evil queen]] pushed her into a well and into the world of York Giselle did go. But that story, ah, yes, you already know. No, this story is the tale of our brave little chipmunk, [[Pip]].|Narration before being interrupted by Pip}}
As the narrator tells the story of [[Giselle]]'s adventures during the events of ''[[Enchanted]]'', the scene the flips to [[Andalasia]] where it focuses on [[Pip]] who is staring at [[Prince Edward]] looking at a fake Giselle where he was frozen while attempting to fall in love with her to which Pip interrupts the narration throughout the story and plans to break the spell.

As Pip arrives at the spell room to stop Narissa to save Prince Edward, he obtains a wand inside the workshop where Pip uses the wand in an attempt to break the spell but is having a hard time finding a way to break the spell. However, to Pip's great misfortune, he accidentally caused all the residents of Andalasia to be frozen, rendering them motionless, much to Pip's sadness. Pip suddenly sees a jar full of acorns on a cabinet and with little hope to save Andalasia, he determines himself to grab some nuts to keep him satisfied, to which the nuts where affected by the magic by accident to which all the forest animals of Andalasia have been unfrozen and it is shown that anything frozen by accident can be undone with magic nut dust to undo the spell so Pip decides to do the same thing to Edward to which while planning to save Edward, Pip discovers a trapdoor in a plan to save Edward before it is too late while avoiding the trolls in an underground chamber.

Evading the trolls, Queen Narissa attempted to attack Pip, but successfully escapes from her upon finding a waterfall exit that directly led him to the chapel where Prince Edward is frozen. Pip uses magic nut dust on Prince Edward by sacrificing the nut by throwing the nut at Edward, breaking the spell and rescuing the Prince (also removing the fake Giselle). Upon rescuing Edward, he becomes free of the spell thanks to Pip as he told Edward of Giselle's plight and decides to go to [[New York]] to rescue her. The story ends with how Pip saved the day to which Pip tells the narrator to end the story already to which she continues narrating that Giselle and Edward lived happily ever after.
