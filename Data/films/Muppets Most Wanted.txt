''Disney’s "Muppets Most Wanted" takes the entire Muppets gang on a global tour, selling out grand theaters in some of [[Europe]]’s most exciting destinations, including [[Berlin]], Madrid and [[London]]. But mayhem follows the Muppets overseas, as they find themselves unwittingly entangled in an international crime caper headed by [[Constantine]]—the World’s Number One Criminal and a dead ringer for [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]—and his dastardly sidekick [[Dominic Badguy|Dominic]], aka Number Two, portrayed by [[Ricky Gervais]]. The film stars [[Tina Fey]] as [[Nadya]], a feisty prison guard, and [[Ty Burrell]] as Interpol agent [[Jean Pierre Napoleon]]. Disney’s “Muppets Most Wanted” is directed by [[James Bobin]] and produced by David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman. Bobin co-wrote the screenplay with [[Nick Stoller|Nicholas Stoller]], who is also executive producer with John G. Scotti. Featuring music from [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]®-winning songwriter [[Bret McKenzie]], “Muppets Most Wanted” hits the big screen March 21, 2014.''
