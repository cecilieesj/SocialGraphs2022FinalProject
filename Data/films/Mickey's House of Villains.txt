}}'''''Mickey's House of Villains''''' is a direct-to-video film, based on ''[[House of Mouse]]'', starring [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Goofy]], [[Daisy Duck]], and characters and villains from past Disney movies. It was released on both VHS and DVD by [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] on [[September 3]], [[2002]]. As the events of the film take place during the third and final season of ''House of Mouse'', it should not be confused with the episode, "[[Pete's House of Villains]]", in which Mickey lets [[Pete]] run the show.

While the film is available only in a cropped full-screen format on VHS and DVD releases, the original HD widescreen version of the film is available on current television broadcasts as well as on iTunes and Netflix.

==Plot==
It is Halloween night at the House of Mouse, and a lot of villains are showing up. [[Jafar]] has a trick in store for the usual heroes of the House, but the villains have to wait until midnight for him to unleash it. After a series of cartoons, Jafar, along with his new henchmen [[Captain Hook]], [[Cruella De Vil]], [[Ursula]], and [[Hades]], takes over the house with a musical number entitled "[[It's Our House Now!]]". All the other villains soon join Jafar's plan. The heroes, princesses and other Disney characters are trapped in the kitchen while Mickey and several others are thrown out into the street. They witness the House's name being changed to the House of Villains.

Mickey, Donald, Goofy and Minnie try to take their House back, but [[Chernabog]] stops them from entering the building. After another two cartoons, Mickey dresses in his sorcerer outfit from ''[[Fantasia]]'' (and ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'') and challenges Jafar to a magical duel using fireballs. Just when Mickey's sorcerer hat is knocked off, [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] escapes from the kitchen, flying on the [[Magic Carpet]] and gives Daisy Duck the magical lamp. Daisy hands it to Mickey who uses the lamp to suck Jafar into it. The rest of the villains run away and the House of Mouse is once again restored.

==Cartoons==
Like the show, the film shows several Disney cartoons. In fact, these shorts make up more of the movie than the actual plot with the villains. However, all their title cards are edited out. Among them, three of the shorts are classic ones:
*''[[Trick or Treat]]'' ([[1952]])
*''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'' ([[1937]])
*''[[Donald Duck and the Gorilla]]'' ([[1944]])
The other five shorts were all originally broadcast on ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' in [[1999]].
*''[[Mickey's Mechanical House]]''
*''[[How to Haunt a House]]''
*''[[Dance of the Goofys]]''
*''[[Donald's Halloween Scare]]''
*''[[Hansel and Gretel (House of Mouse short)|Hansel and Gretel]]''

==Trivia==
*Despite appearing on the DVD cover's backside and in the short "[[Mickey's Mechanical House]]", [[Pluto]] does not make an appearance in the film itself. Also, despite being used in the film's promotional trailers (via archive footage from the original ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' film), [[Mr. Smee]] only appears for a split-second in the final film.
*A trailer for ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' was shown after the special during its first broadcast, and is also on the DVD.
*[[Rob Paulsen]] provides the singing voice of [[Hades]] (during ''[[It's Our House Now!|It's Our House Now]]''), making this the first - and, as of 2020, only - Disney production where the character is voiced by someone other than [[James Woods]].
*Some of the scenes from the beginning of the film, such as Mickey's introduction, were re-used in "[[House Ghosts]]".
*The scene where Donald tries to scare the Beast, but gets scared by him was re-used in "[[Halloween With Hades]]", along with the scene where he said that he will never scare anyone.
*When [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] was about to battle [[Jafar]] in his wizard attire there is a direct reference to the dinosaur section of ''[[The Rite of Spring|Rite of Spring]]'' from ''[[Fantasia]]''. When Mickey appears on stage and all of the villains gradually turn their heads towards him is very similar to when the [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] appears and all of the other dinosaurs face him. Jafar's defeat at the end is similar to that of ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', where he gets sucked into the [[Jafar's Lamp|lamp]].
*Strangely, some of the characters involved in the takeover of the House aren't actually villains at all, most notably [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile|Tick-Tock]] (a neutral character who spent all of his screentime trying to eat [[Captain Hook]]), [[Witch Hazel]] (who is good in her debut appearance which was also featured at the start of the film), and the Haunted Mansion ghosts.
*[[Iago]] was also a villain but reformed before this film in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]''.
**It should be noted that [[Anastasia Tremaine]], another reformed character, is also shown as a villain. That's because ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'' was released five years after ''House of Villains'' and thus, in fact, she was still a villain at the time.
*Jafar was the only villain from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''; [[Razoul]] and [[Royal Guards (Aladdin)|his guards]] don't appear in the film. In fact, they would oppose Jafar.
*According to the Reel of Misfortune DVD mini-game, there are 6,469,952 spots altogether in [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]].
*In the film's trailer:
**[[Madame Medusa]] is featured as a prominent villain despite only appearing briefly in the film itself.
**[[Jafar]] briefly has Captain Hook's voice and Jasper has the Big Bad Wolf's.
*If one cuts out the cartoon shorts, this movie is only ten minutes long.
