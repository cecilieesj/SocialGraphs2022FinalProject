'''''The Truth About Mother Goose''''' is a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated short that was released on [[August 28]], [[1957]] in a double feature with ''[[Perri]]''. It was produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Film Distribution]].

It explains the historical backgrounds of three popular nursery rhymes: "Little Jack Horner", which is based on a story about a servant who stole the deed for an estate intended for King Henry VIII of England. "Mary, Mary Quite Contrary", which is about Mary, Queen of Scots, and "London Bridge", which concerns the history of the real bridge, which "fell down" and was rebuilt.

It was later re-edited into aÂ [[The Truth About Mother Goose (Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color episode)|''Wonderful World of Color'' episode]] alongside ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'', with both segments being re-edited to feature narration from [[Ludwig Von Drake]].

The scene with the Red Knight was reused in the [[1963]] animated film ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.
