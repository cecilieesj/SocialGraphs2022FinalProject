'''''Fraidy Cat''''' is a cancelled action comedy film, directed by [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] that was plannedÂ to be set to be released in [[2009]]. It was to have been a satire of {{WikipediaLink|Alfred Hitchcock}}'s film noirs.

==Plot==
Oscar, a cat and Corina, a cockatoo are pampered, spoiled house pets that live an easy life in their owner's London flat. However, when a fellow neighborhood pet is kidnapped and Oscar is the prime suspect, the two must set off on a mission to find out who the real culprit is so that they can clear Oscar's name.

|quote = "And this time around, these empty suits chose to bad-mouth "Fraidy Cat." Saying that the premise of the picture was far too obscure. "I mean, who today even remembers who Alfred Hitchcock was? So why would kids in 2009 pay good money to see an animated film that pays tribute to an old, fat, dead movie director?"

''Fraidy Cat'' began production in [[2004]], under the direction of Musker and Clements with [[Andreas Deja]], Harald Siepermann and Hans Bacher handling character and background designs. The initial storyreel was presented in May of that year and although many of the animators were impressed with it, David Stainton would not agree to release the movie. This was because he did not think that it would be able to be marketed to a general audience, on account of average people, especially children were not well-versed in Hitchcock's films.
