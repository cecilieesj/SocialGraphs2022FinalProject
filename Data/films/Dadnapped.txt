}}'''''Dadnapped''''' is a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] which premiered [[February 16]], [[2009]]. Starring actors from various [[Disney Channel Original Series]], the movie had 4.6 million viewers for its premiere. Although the story centers on a hostage situation, the kidnappers are inept and the film "practically oozes kid-pleasing content".
==Plot==
Melissa Morris (Emily Osment) desperately tries to gain more attention from her always preoccupied father, Neil, a best-selling author (George Newbern). Melissa lives in the shadow of Tripp Zoome (Jonathan Keltz), the adventurous and clever hero from her father's popular spy novels. Before a long overdue father-daughter vacation, her father gets kidnapped by obsessive fans: Wheeze (David Henrie) with his friend, Sheldon (Denzel Whitaker), and his brother, Andre (Moises Arias).

The tables turn however, when she must team up with them to find and rescue him from Merv (Jason Earles), and brothers Maurice (Phill Lewis) and Skunk (Charles Halford). It turns out Merv is just using Skunk and Maurice as part of a plan to get Neil to write one final book using his daughter as a reader. Wheeze, Andre and Sheldon get all of the Trip Zoome fans in town to gather together to rescue Melissa and Neil and they attack when Melissa manages to signal them.

The fans attack Merv, Maurice and Skunk and they try to run but are stopped by more fans. Merv sneaks out with Neil while Skunk and Maurice go after Melissa who escapes. Melissa defeats them and ties them up. Merv nearly gets away, but Sheldon, who had been trying to find where everyone went, spots him and alerts everyone else. Neil is rescued, but Merv tries to get away.

As he runs, Skunk and Maurice, still tied up, come out and see this and regretting what they've done use what they're tied up with to trip Merv, knocking him down and ending his escape. The police arrest Maurice and Skunk while Neil thanks his fans. Wheeze gives his number to Melissa before she and her father leave on their long-overdue vacation.
