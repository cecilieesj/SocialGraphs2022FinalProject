'''''Disenchanted''''' is an American fantasy-musical film and sequel to ''[[Enchanted]]'', produced and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in association with [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and Josephson Entertainment. The film was written and directed by [[Adam Shankman]]. It was released on [[November 18]], [[2022]] on [[Disney+]].

==Synopsis==
It has been 10 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn’t the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn’t been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family’s future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.

==Plot==
Ten years after the events of [[Enchanted|the first film]], [[Giselle]], [[Robert Philip|Robert]] and [[Morgan Philip]] are living happily together and welcome a new baby girl named [[Sofia Philip|Sofia]]. However, life in the [[New York City|city]] is starting to drag on Giselle and Robert, and Morgan has become a cynical teenager. Seeing a billboard for the idyllic suburbia known as [[Monroeville]], Giselle makes plans to move the family away, with Morgan being very reluctant to go. Their new house, described as a "fixer-upper", unsettles Morgan, Robert has to commute to New York to continue his job, and Giselle meets [[Malvina Monroe]], the snooty head of the town council. [[Prince Edward]] and [[Nancy Tremaine|Nancy]] arrive from [[Andalasia]] and bequeath a wish granting wand to them that can only be used by "a true daughter of Andalasia". Morgan befriends Malvina's handsome son [[Tyson Monroe|Tyson]]  but is shunned by everyone else at school. Giselle tries to help by building a cupcake stand, but this only embarrasses Morgan and Giselle is forced to take it down by Malvina.

Realizing that their new life is still hard, Giselle uses the wand to wish that their life was as simple as a fairy tale. The next day, the entire world has transformed into a fantasy land with the town now called Monrolasia. Only Giselle and [[Pip]] the chipmunk are aware of the changes that have happened with Morgan happy with her life and Robert believing that he is a brave adventurer, albeit a terrible one. While Giselle takes Morgan and Sofia into town, Malvina is revealed to have been turned into an evil magic queen and is holding a festival. Whenever the clock strikes, Giselle takes on a more snarky personality and seems envious of Morgan. She soon realizes that since she is a step-mother, she is becoming a wicked one and finds that Morgan's room is poorly kept. Incidentally, this causes Pip to transform into a tabby cat.

Giselle consults the [[Scroll|magic instructions]] and learns that she has until midnight that night to reverse the wish, otherwise everything will be permanent. Malvina, having figured out that Giselle has a magic wand, sends her two lackies [[Rosaleen]] and [[Ruby (Disenchanted)|Ruby]] to steal the wand, but realizes that she cannot use it, resulting in them also holding the instructions hostage. Giselle, realizing that she is losing herself to her wicked side, sends Morgan down the well back to Andalasia while she heads over to Malvina's to get the wand. The two of them instead decide to hold a battle at midnight to decide who will be the villain of the town. Morgan ends up in Andalasia with her memory restored, but finds the land being slowly sucked into a portal. Edward and Nancy reveal that since Giselle wished for the whole world to change, it is taking up all of Andalasia until there is nothing left. Morgan realizes that to save Giselle, she needs to use a memory tree (a childhood project of hers) to bring her back and she and Nancy head back to Monrolasia.

Robert returns from his day and realizes that Morgan is missing and heads out to find her. Giselle has Pip steal the wand from Malvina as she goes to attend the festival. She wishes that she was the queen and she and Malvina duel, causing the magic to rupture through the town. Morgan and Nancy find Tyson and Robert and head to the city hall to stop the duel. Morgan tosses her family tree project to Giselle who rips it up, but is encased with a magic spell that turns her back to normal. Giselle is about to wish everything back to normal, but Malvina puts Morgan into a sleep spell and demands the wand from her. She destroys it, but releases Morgan. Robert and Tyson head to the top of the clock tower to delay the final chime as Giselle tells Morgan that she is a true daughter of Andalasia and therefore capable of using it. Morgan wishes that she was home with her mother just as Malvina attempts to destroy the clock tower with Robert and Tyson in it.

Morgan awakens to discover that everything is back to normal and only she and Giselle are aware of the events while everyone else believes that they simply had a strange dream. Giselle goes over to apologize to Malvina for stepping over her plans while Malvina, showing a bit of humility, allows Giselle to join her council. Robert decides to move his practice to Monroeville so that he does not have to commute, Morgan and Tyson start a relationship and Nancy and Edward continue to visit the Philips in their now happy life.

==Production==
===Development===
In February [[2010]], ''Variety'' reported that Walt Disney Pictures planned to film a sequel with [[Barry Josephson]] and [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] producing again. Jessie Nelson was attached to write the screenplay and Anne Fletcher to direct. Disney hoped the cast members from the first film would return and for a release as early as [[2011]].<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118014677.html?categoryid=10&cs=1&nid=2248 'Enchanted' to see second chapter]</ref>

On [[January 12]], 2011, composer [[Alan Menken]] was asked about the sequel in an interview. His reply was, "I've heard things, but there's nothing yet. I don't know much about what's happening with that. Honestly, I don't know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I'm not frustrated that this isn't one of them. At the moment, I have a lot of stage things happening and I'm busy enough with that, so I really don't need more on my plate."<ref>[http://movies.about.com/od/rapunzel/a/Alan-Menken-Interview.htm Exclusive Alan Menken Interview - Tangled, Musical Comedy TV Series, Enchanted 2 and Snow Queen]</ref>

On [[March 28]], 2011, in an interview for his latest film ''Hop'', [[James Marsden]] was asked about the sequel.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=75545 Exclusive: James Marsden on Hop]</ref>

{{Quote|I don't know. I think that the clock is ticking on that one. [[Amy Adams]] and I are both saying, "If there's going to be a sequel, we're not getting any younger." Since we play sort of ageless animated characters. Hopefully we do. That was something really special, and I'd love to come back and do another. I've heard the same things you've heard. There's a script out there somewhere and there's talk of it, but I never believe it until I see the script and know that we're actually making that film. So I don't know. Too many eggs in that basket.|James Marsden}}

As of July [[2014]], Disney had hired screenwriters J. David Stem and David N. Weiss to write a script for a sequel, and also hired Anne Fletcher to direct the film.<ref name="Deadline">[http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/enchanted-2-disney-smurfs-writers/ Disney Casts ‘Enchanted 2′ Spell With ‘Smurfs’ Scribes]</ref>

On March 23, 2021, in an interview with JLGB, Menken revealed that [[James Marsden]] and [[Idina Menzel]] would also return, and that the role of [[Morgan Philip]] (initially played by child actress Rachel Covey in the original) would possibly be recast.

On April 26, 2021, Deadline reported that [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], and Jayma Mays were cast in the sequel, supposedly as the antagonists.<ref name="DL">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2021/04/disney-enchanted-sequel-disenchanted-maya-rudolph-yvette-nicole-brown-jayma-mays-1234744446/|title=Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown & Jayma Mays Joining Disney+’s ‘Enchanted’ Sequel ‘Disenchanted’|website=Deadline|date=[[April 26]], 2021}}</ref>

On May 17, 2021, Disney confirmed via Twitter the previously reported casting, alongside the additions of Kolton Stewart, Oscar Nuñez, and newcomer Gabriella Baldacchino, who will replace Covey in the role of Morgan, as well as a release year of [[2022]].

With the release of the trailer on September 9, 2022, comedian Griffin Newman revealed via Twitter that he would be the new voice of Pip the chipmunk, replacing both [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from the first film.

===Filming===
While the film takes place in upstate New York, it was really filmed in a village in [[Ireland]] called Enniskerry. Filming began on May 17, 2021 and concluded on July 21, 2021. Reshoots in Ireland took place in Buckinghamshire, [[England]] on March 28, 2022. Although the first live-action scene of Giselle and her family leaving their home was filmed on location in New York City at the same Riverside Drive apartment as the original film.

===Animation===
Unlike the first film, which had animated sequences directed by [[James Baxter]] with contributions from several veterans of hand-drawn animation at Disney such as [[Mark Henn]] and [[Andreas Deja]], this film's animated sequences were outsourced to a French-Canadian animation company called TonicDNA.

===Music===
{{Main|Disenchanted (soundtrack)}}
In May 2021, Stephen Schwartz said that the film will have seven songs and reprises, including two songs for Nancy, played by Menzel, who initially had a song in the first film, but was cut. In addition, he stated that the songs were being written in collaboration with the scriptwriters and directors organically, unlike the first film where the song spots were already indicated in the script.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Schwartz Scene Issue 70 – Spring 2021|first=Carol|last=De Giere|date=May 14, 2021|url=https://www.theschwartzscene.com/quarterly-newsletter/issue-70-spring-2021/|access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*This is the final Disney film to use the 2006 [[Walt Disney Pictures logo|on-screen logo]].
*This is the second sequel of a theatrical Disney film to be released on Disney+ in 2022, after ''[[Hocus Pocus 2]]''.
*Pip's line "Jumping jellysticks" is a play on "Jumping jellyfish", a catchphrase that was uttered by [[Sebastian]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and is commonly used in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''.
*On YouTube, the teaser trailer opens with the new Disney100 logo, but on Disney+, the teaser trailer opens with the traditional castle logo.
*This film marks [[Alan Tudyk]]'s third role in a live-action Disney film, after voicing [[K-2SO|K-2S0]] in ''[[Rogue One]]'' and [[Iago]] in [[Aladdin (2019 film)|the 2019 remake of ''Aladdin'']]. It is also his second role in a live-action film under the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] banner after the latter film, as well as his first role in a live-action Disney+ original film.
*Morgan and Pip are the only characters from the first film to not have their original actors reprise their respective roles in the sequel. In this case, Morgan is portrayed by Gabriella Baldacchino in this film instead of Rachel Covey, while Pip is voiced by Griffin Newman instead of [[Jeff Bennett]] or [[Kevin Lima]].
**Covey has a cameo in this film as the girl in Monrolasia who reminds Giselle that the festival is that night. ("For the festival? M'lady?")
*[[Nathaniel]] doesn't return in this film. This is due to the fact that he stays in New York, while the Philip family moves out of New York.
*The film's release date, November 18, is coincidentally also National Princess Day. This is to keep in mind that Giselle is a character notably inspired by [[Disney Princess|Disney Princesses]]. 
**It should also be noted that Giselle was once in consideration to be added into the official line-up, before plans were dropped.
*If you look closely in the illustration of Giselle and Robert exhausted on the couch from taking care of Sofia, there are some fashion designs and spools of thread, indicating that Giselle was still running Andalasia Fashions during this time.
*At the end of the film, as Pip goes to put the ''Disenchanted'' book back on the shelf, you can see a copy of his book ''Silence Isn't Golden'' from the first film two shelfs below.

==Easter Eggs==
Just like in the previous film, this film is full of nods to Disney films.

*In the animated prologue, when the camera sweeps through the castle of Andalasia, two characters resembling [[King Stefan]] and [[Queen Leah]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' walk on the bridge.
*In the village square of Andalasia, a fountain not unlike the one [[Belle]] sits near to read her book in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' appears.
**In the same shot, if you listen closely, you can hear a woman saying, "Bonjour!" in reference to "[[Belle (song)|Belle]]".
*The firefly who serves as Pip's lantern looks similar to [[Ray]] from ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''.
*Giselle and Robert's new daughter is named Sofia, quite likely in tribute to [[Sofia the First (character)|the titular character]] from ''[[Sofia the First]]''.
*In a verse that was cut from "[[Even More Enchanted]]", but heard during the end credits, Giselle mentions some "[[Jiminy Cricket]]s".
*In a deleted scene (shown in the trailer), Edward says that a year ago, Andalasia got trapped in the mouth of a giant whale, a reference to [[Monstro]] from ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''.
*The set of Monrolasia has various puns and Easter Eggs on the building signs too numerous to list.
*The gardeners that Giselle meets when they first move into their home are transformed into fairies resembling [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]] from ''Sleeping Beauty'', and are even listed as such in the credits.
*In "[[Fairytale Life|Fairytale Life (After the Spell)]]":
**Morgan dances with the broomstick, not unlike the ones in "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" sequence of ''[[Fantasia]]''. The film is also referenced by name in the song.
***This could also be a nod to when Merryweather made the mop and broom move when cleaning their cottage in ''Sleeping Beauty''.
**The appliances and silverware all sing not unlike the enchanted objects in ''Beauty and the Beast''.
**Some of Giselle's operatic trills (courtesy of [[Laura Dickinson]]) pay homage to [[Snow White]], including one phrase based on her vocalizations from "[[With a Smile and a Song]]".
**When the citizens of Monrolasia get in a kick line, they sing "So [[Be Our Guest|be our guest, be our guest]]!"
*Edgar transforms into a Magic Mirror similar to the one from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.
*The magic Scroll is voiced by [[Alan Tudyk]], who, since ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'', has become somewhat of a mainstay and good luck charm with Disney. The [[Ed Wynn]]-like voice he provides the scroll is similar to the voice given to [[King Candy]].
*The scroll asks Giselle if she saw falling flower petals, in reference to [[the Enchanted Rose]] from ''Beauty and the Beast''.
*Giselle's transformation into "wicked stepmother" has shades of [[Lady Tremaine]] from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''. When Giselle tells Morgan the list of chores she must do before going to the festival, it is pretty much exactly the same way Lady Tremaine listed the chores for Cinderella in the bedroom chamber scene.
**Giselle wielding the Andalasian wishing wand is a nod to Lady Tremaine having the Fairy Godmother's wand in possession in ''Cinderella III: A Twist in Time''.
*Giselle says that "villains you don't know who are villains until it's too late" don't count as villains, a subtle swipe at the recent trend in Disney films with characters such as [[King Candy]], [[Hans|Prince Hans]], [[Yokai]], [[Bellwether]] and [[Ernesto de la Cruz]].
*[[Pip]]'s transformation into an "evil cat" is a nod to [[Lucifer]].
*Near the end of "[[Perfect]]", Morgan sits atop a wagon in a pose like [[Ariel]], and water splashes behind her (from a lady with a bucket) like the end of the reprise to "[[Part of Your World]]" from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.
*A shopkeeper in the martketplace in Monrolasia says "sugar, dates, and pistachios!", just as another does to [[Jasmine]] in 1992's [[Aladdin (film)|''Aladdin'']].
*Morgan meeting Tyson, dressed as a peasant, in the town square mirrors the 1997 version of ''[[Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella]]'' as well as the 2015 [[Cinderella (2015 film)|live-action film]].
*During "[[Badder]]":
**Giselle and Malvina mention [[Maleficent]] and [[Cruella De Vil]].
**In Malvina's cabinet, she has possession of the [[Drink Me Bottle]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.
**Malvina also possesses a [[Poisoned Apple]], which was not only used in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', but also in the first film.
**Malvina also has the Spinning Wheel from ''Sleeping Beauty'', as well as the Enchanted Rose from ''Beauty and the Beast''.
*Giselle's carriage, which looks similar to the one she emerged from in Andalasia in the first film, is based on the carriage from the end of ''Cinderella''.
*Morgan falls into a sleeping curse, just like Snow White, Aurora and her own stepmother, Giselle.
*During "[[Love Power (Disenchanted)|Love Power]]", Giselle's memory tree transforms Morgan's rags into a beautiful ballgown, in homage to [[Marc Davis]]'s legendary animation of Cinderella's transformation.
**Also in "Love Power", Nancy sings "Let it glow, let it grow", a nod to "[[Let It Go]]" from ''[[Frozen]]'', which was also sung by Nancy's actress, Idina Menzel.
*Tyson's prince outfit is similar to Prince [[Eric]]'s.
*Morgan's ragged dress, when it was seen in animated form in Andalasia, looks similar to [[Cinderella's Dress|Cinderella's dress]], after it was torn by her stepsisters.
*When Giselle mentioned that stepdaughters live in attic or dungeons, this is a slight reference to Cinderella and Snow White.
*At the ball, Ruby and Rosaleen wear dresses based on the ones worn by [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]], respectively.
**Their transformations into toads might be in reference to a similar transformation in ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]''.
***It's also an obvious reference to ''The Princess and the Frog''.
*The way that Morgan escaped her room is similar to how Belle attempted to escape in the [[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|2017 live-action reimagining of Beauty and the Beast]].
**The way she also climbed down is a slight reference to ''[[Tangled]]''.
