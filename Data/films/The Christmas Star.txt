He hides out from the police in a nearby suburban neighborhood where he is befriended and helped by two local children who think he is the real Santa. He takes advantage of their naïveté to help him get his counterfeit money hidden somewhere in a local department store while he develops kind-hearted feelings for his two con victims that make him slowly understand the true nature of Christmas.
