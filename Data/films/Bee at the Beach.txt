'''''Bee at the Beach''''' is a [[1950]] [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] animated short.

==Synopsis==
[[Donald Duck]] and [[Spike the Bee]] fight over limited space at the beach.

==Releases==
===Television===
*''[[Good Morning, Mickey!]]'', episode #59 '''(edited)'''
*''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Walt Disney Presents]]'', episode #6.23: "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (animation)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]"
*''[[Donald's Quack Attack]]'', episode #35
*''[[Mickey's Mouse Tracks]]'', episode #10

===Home video===
*''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Seven|Walt Disney Treasures]]: The Chronological Donald, Volume Three''  '''(uncut)'''
*''[[Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites]]: Starring Donald'' '''(same edit as for ''Good Morning, Mickey!'' episode #59)'''
*''Everybody Loves Donald''

==Trivia==
*Instead of this cartoon in ''Donald's Bee Pictures'', it is mistakenly replaced by ''[[Tea for Two Hundred]]''. It is correctly used in later pressings.
*For some odd unknown reason, the ''[[Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites|Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites: Starring Donald]]'' DVD uses the unrestored 1980's [[Disney Channel]] print used in the anthology shows ''[[Good Morning, Mickey!|Good Morning Mickey!]]'' and/or ''[[Donald Duck Presents]]'' that cuts the entire opening with Donald and Spike entering the beach, and instead starts with Donald entering the ocean (not to mention the opening omits the Donald Duck title card and credits, as well as the closing title). The DVD release ''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Seven|Walt Disney Treasures]]: The Chronological Donald, Volume Three'' on the other hand presents the cartoon fully restored and completely intact with no scenes or titles missing.
*When one of the sharks try to eat Donald, the [[Hunter Dogs|Hunting Dog]] sound from '''''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]''''' can be heard when they jump out of the water.

==Goofs/Errors==
*When Donald covers four holes in his "Super Duper Raft" poked by Spike using his feet, only three toes are used instead of four.
