'''''Figaro and Cleo''''' is a [[Figaro]] cartoon, released in [[October 15]], [[1943]].

==Synopsis==
Figaro tries various methods of trying to get Cleo, the fish, for his supper. Strangely enough, in this short both Figaro and Cleo are owned by an elderly woman named Aunt Delilah.
===Plot===
A song helps to set up the plot, which is that Figaro wants to eat Cleo, but refuses to do so because it would be wrong. Simple enough, but then Figaro proceeds to try and eat Cleo throughout the rest of the short.

Figaro’s actions are completely counter to the song, even if he does seem somewhat reluctant about the role he’s adopted. Even then, after originally declining to eat Cleo, Figaro spends the next few minutes attacking the maid’s broom and then batting around a ball of yarn. 

After Figaro’s yarn debacle, he gets into repeated attacks on Cleo, none of which are successful or well planned. The climax of the short comes when Figaro dives head first into the fishbowl, nearly drowns and subsequently decides to change his ways.

==Characters==
*[[Figaro]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
*[[Cleo]]
*[[Mammy Two Shoes]] (voiced by Lillian Randolph)

==Releases==

* ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]]'', episode #2.3: "[[Jiminy Cricket Presents Bongo]]"
===Home Media===
* ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]: The Complete Pluto, Volume 2 '' (DVD)

== Trivia ==
* The unseen black lady's behavior towards Figaro but when he tries to eat Cleo is similar to Mammy Two Shoes from the Tom and Jerry series.
* This is the second time that Figaro behaves much like Tom Cat and Cleo is like Jerry Mouse in various ways, both are sometimes enemies unlike Tom and Jerry, Figaro acts antagonistic to Cleo; he tries to eat the goldfish but gets caught by the unseen maid (only in this short) and Figaro somewhat gets punished.
** Particularly, the short depicts Figaro and Cleo acting like foes, which is probably a reference to how Tom acts as an arch-nemesis towards Jerry as the victim.
* This animated short is based on a deleted scene from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'': In The Belly Of The Whale.
