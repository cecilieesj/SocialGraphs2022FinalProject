The film introduced the [[Muppet Babies (puppets)|Muppet Babies]] (toddler versions of the Muppet characters in a flashback/dream sequence). The Muppet Babies later received their own [[Muppet Babies|Saturday morning cartoon]], which aired from 1984 to 1990.

As the film opens, [[Kermit the Frog]] and ten of his friends are graduating from [[Danhurst College]] and are performing in a variety show on campus. Instead of splitting up and going their separate ways after graduation, the gang decides to try to take their act to [[New York City|New York]] and try to make it on [[Broadway]]. Kermit and the others are so confident in the show that they anticipate becoming instant stars, but as the months pass and their funds run dry, they are forced to go their separate ways and find jobs. Kermit remains in New York and gets a job at a local diner, befriending the owner, [[Pete]] ([[Louis Zorich]]), and his daughter [[Jenny]] ([[Juliana Donald]]) who works there as a waitress.

Complications arise in the form of unsavory jobs for Kermit's friends ([[Scooter]] becomes an usher at a movie theater; [[Rowlf the Dog|Rowlf]] runs the desk at a dog kennel), a jealous Miss Piggy who remains behind to keep an eye on Kermit and Jenny, and Kermit's additional failed attempts to break into stardom. After finally finding a producer who is willing to fund the show, however, Kermit is so excited that he unknowingly steps into the path of an oncoming vehicle and is knocked unconscious. He awakens with no memory of name, friends, or past, decides his name is Phillip Phil, and eventually falls in with a [[Mad Ave Advertising|group of fellow frogs]] who write ad campaign slogans.

After Kermit's companions are reunited in New York (along with the many friends they've each met along the way), despite the fact that Kermit is missing, they decide the best thing to do is to go on with the show in his honor. After the [[Amnesia|amnesiac]] Kermit visits the diner and his friends recognize him, they recover him and Miss Piggy manages to knock him back to his senses. The show, ''[[Manhattan Melodies]]'', is a tremendous hit and, during the finale, Miss Piggy and Kermit are joined together in marriage.

==Notes==
* Filming began on May 31, 1983 and ended on September 16th.<ref>''[[Imagination Illustrated: The Jim Henson Journal]]'', page 150</ref>
* The [[The Muppets Take Manhattan teaser trailer|teaser trailer]] for the film was composed entirely of footage created independently of the film. A breathless announcer describes the excitement and spectacle of Broadway and the many hopefuls who come to New York seeking stardom. Kermit and Miss Piggy only appear briefly at the end of the trailer.
* The film's title references the 1925 song "Manhattan," by Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers, with its lyric "I'll take Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island too." The Muppets popularized the phrase "Take Manhattan" as a title, which other films and TV series have used since.
* Instead of being traditional hand puppets, the tiny rats are controlled with rods to operate their heads and mouths.
* So far, this is the only Muppet Movie not to use any [[Breaking the fourth wall in Muppet films|fourth-wall references]].
* As was done with ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'', Miss Piggy had a human "stunt double," who was used in the long shots during the roller skating sequence.
*[[Baby Rowlf]] can be seen [[Inside jokes (Muppet movies)#The Muppets Take Manhattan|"operating" on a plush Big Bird toy]] during the Muppet Babies dream sequence, which appears to be the [[Talking Big Bird (CBS Toys)|Big Bird Talking Plush]] toy made in 1980 by [[Child Guidance]].
* The only Muppet Babies who appear in this film are [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babykermit|Baby Kermit]], [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babypiggy|Baby Piggy]], [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babyfozzie|Baby Fozzie]], [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babygonzo|Baby Gonzo]], [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babyscooter|Baby Scooter]], and [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babyrowlf|Baby Rowlf]]. [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babyanimal|Baby Animal]] and [[Muppet Babies (puppets)#babyskeeter|Baby Skeeter]] weren't introduced until ''[[Muppet Babies]]''.
*Two of the cages in the dog kennel are labeled [[Inside jokes (Muppet movies)#The Muppets Take Manhattan|"Jim" and "Frank."]]
*The soundtrack to this movie is the only theatrical Muppet movie soundtrack to have never been available on CD. However, three songs from the film were released on ''[[Music, Mayhem and More!]]''.
*Both [[The Muppets Take Manhattan Storybook|storybook]] and [[The Muppets Take Manhattan (Comic Book)|comic book]] adaptations include some scenes that weren't in the movie, possibly indicating that some scenes were deleted from the film. Scenes in both of these include a sequence where [[Statler and Waldorf]] attempt to cure Kermit's amnesia, and a scene where Gonzo told Kermit that the minister at the wedding was a real minister. Both of these books also reference [[Beauregard]] taking The Electric Mayhem to New York.
*During the scene where the Muppets try to get Kermit's memory back, Animal, Floyd, Janice, and Dr. Teeth can be seen in the dressing room during the first shot, but a few seconds later, the orchestra starts playing the music, and they are all seen as part of the orchestra, and out of the dressing room.
* Composer [[Jeff Moss]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1985 for ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' in the category Best Music, Original Song Score. The Oscar went to [[Prince]] for "[[Purple Rain Man|Purple Rain]]."
* A cameo for [[Dustin Hoffman]] as a producer was written, but Hoffman decided not to do it at the last minute.<ref>Misch, David [http://www.toughpigs.com/david-misch/ Tough Pigs interview with David Misch]</ref>
* Approximately 175 people as extras and a handful that were puppeteers performed during the wedding finale sequence. The crowd sequence took one day to film.<ref name="Cincinnati Magazine">Cincinnati Magazine: [http://books.google.com/books?id=wR0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=Rick+Lyon+Muppets&hl=en&ei=MdyDTeu-GpSqsAPbjcXxAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q&f=false Showbiz: Of Muppets and Puppets]</ref>
* There was a deleted scene in which two little people stayed in lockers by the Muppets.<ref>“A Conversation with Frank Oz” at the Museum of Moving Images, recounted at http://www.toughpigs.com/recap-frank-oz/</ref>
* Although he appeared in ''The Great Muppet Caper'', this film marks the first major role for [[Rizzo the Rat]] in a Muppet movie.
* The [[The Muppets Take Manhattan Wedding Seating Chart|wedding finale]] features many of Kermit's ''[[Sesame Street]]'' friends, although only [[Bert]], [[Ernie]], and [[Cookie Monster]] have speaking roles.
* Speaking on the film's MPAA rating, Jim Henson said, "There have been only four G movies this year. Isn't that amazing? I would never do a Muppet movie that wasn't a G. It's said that the G rating has a stigma. Kids don't want to see kiddie movies anymore."<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kXBmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p4wNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1094,3261552&dq=muppets&hl=en ''The Sun'', Vancouver B.C., page B9, July 10, 1984, from ''Baltimore Evening Sun'']</ref>
*After the Muppets separate, leaving Kermit alone in [[New York]] trying to sell the show, they send him postcards to let him know where they ended up across the [[The United States of America|USA]]. All of them quickly make new friends that they bring back to New York towards the end of the film, while Kermit's additions to the troupe consist of the Muppets he met in New York:

==Video releases==
The film was theatrically released by Tri-Star Pictures. Unlike the films that preceded it (''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'', and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''), this film was not produced by ITC, so the rights did ''not'' eventually go back to the Henson company. The movie was, like the previous ''Muppet'' films, first released on video by CBS/Fox Home Video in the mid-1980s, and later been re-released by Columbia TriStar (later [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]). It is one of two ''Muppet'' films that [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] does not own the rights to, the other being ''[[Muppets from Space]]''.

==Edits==
*The 1999 video release has a number of audio edits. The music played during the "Tristar Pictures" logo sequence is omitted, as are a few times when Animal yells "Bad man!" at Dabney Coleman. The 2001 DVD and Blu-ray releases don't have these edits.
*When the film aired on [[The Hub]], the Muppets bowing down after the [[Together Again]] number, the scene with [[Joan Rivers]] and the "[[Rat Scat (Something's Cookin')]]" number are edited out. When it aired on [[ABC Family]] in January 2014, only the former two scenes were cut.
*When this film aired on the [[Utah|LDS Church owned]] BYUtv, the music played during the "Tristar Pictures" logo sequence is omitted. The Muppets bowing down after the Together Again number, the scene with Joan Rivers, and Janice saying that she doesn't pose naked, "even if it is artistic" are also edited out.
