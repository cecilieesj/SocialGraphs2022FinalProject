*As revealed in the documentary ''[[Frank and Ollie]]'', future Disney animator [[Frank Thomas]] saw this cartoon as one of the first times emotions and pathos were depicted by an animated character during the sequence where the mouse was tormented in being a "nothing", convincing him to join the Walt Disney studio.
*This story is also similar to Aesop's Fables, "The Bat, The Bird And The Beast", the mouse is not welcomed by the birds nor his family, instead greeted only by the bats.
