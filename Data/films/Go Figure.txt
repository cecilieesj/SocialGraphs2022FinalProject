==Plot==
A talented teenage figure skater, Katelin Kingsford, dreams of being a champion when she is discovered by a famous Russian skating coach, Natasha Goberman. She does not have enough money to train with this famous coach who is associated with a private boarding school, but she has the opportunity to get a hockey scholarship so she can figure skate. She accepts the scholarship and learns to play hockey. She changes in the process. She learns about teamwork and making friends by playing hockey. Katelin also learns some lessons about life but also has to make choices. Her little brother Bradley loves hockey and learns through his big sister's experience how to be a better and supportive brother. Near the end, Katelin has to rush from her hockey championship to the trials for the US Olympic Women's Figure Skating Team. In the process, her hockey friends learn the truth which she had previously hidden out of fear of being ridiculed and her brother buys her time to get to the skating rink. Due to being forced to use her hockey skates, she messes up, but her friends arrive with her figure skates and rally the crowd into cheering for a second chance for her. Katelin is given a second chance and performs admirably and is chosen for the Olympics.
