'''''Music Land''''' is a package film produced by [[Walt Disney]] and released to theaters by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] on [[October 5]], [[1955]]. As the final Disney animated film to be distributed by RKO, it was also the last package film produced by Disney until ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' in [[1977]], following ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'', ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'', ''[[Make Mine Music]]'', ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', ''[[Melody Time]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''. Like ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' and ''[[Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons]]'', each of the cartoons had been released on its own at first before being fused together as one film. The separate cartoon shorts are now available on [[DVD]].

Although Walt Disney Productions had established its own film distribution firm, it still owed RKO one more feature film under the existing contract. In order to fulfill that final film commitment, Disney took a combination of four sequences from ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' and five from ''[[Melody Time]]'' to create a new compilation film entitled ''Music Land''.

The poster boldly declared it was "The Big Parade of Mirth and Melody!" The film was never shown again except once at a retrospective “Tribute to Walt Disney” at the National Film Theater in [[1970]]. There are no home video releases of the entire film available as these two aforementioned movies were already available on VHS, DVD, and digital.

==Film segments==

*''[[Trees (Melody Time)|Trees]]''
