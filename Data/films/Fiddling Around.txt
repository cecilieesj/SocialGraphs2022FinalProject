'''''Fiddling Around''''', also known as '''''Just Mickey''''', is a [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] short that was released on [[March 21]], [[1930]].

==Summary==
In a solo stage act, Mickey Mouse performs "Traumerei", and Brahms' Hungarian dance on the violin but, he is soon he is overcome with emotion and has to stop. He leaves the stage still overwhelmed by emotions until he hears the offscreen audience screaming for an encore. As an encore, he finishes with the finale to the William Tell Overture in a rousing (and ridiculously silly) violin performance.

==Trivia==
*The film's copyright was renewed on [[December 16]], [[1957]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3111213li/page/112/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries (1957 renewals)]</ref>
*This is the first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be released by [[Columbia Pictures]].
*This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon not by [[Ub Iwerks]].
*An issue concerning this cartoon is whether the title of the short is ''Fiddling Around'' or ''Just Mickey''. The former was copyrighted as such and was seen on the original theatrical poster, while the latter is its common title and it was shown on the recreated title card seen on the [[Walt Disney Treasures|''Walt Disney Treasures'']] DVD release ''Mickey Mouse In Black And White: Volume 2'', as no original release print with the title had yet surfaced. In 2009, [[David Gerstein]] uncovered an original 1930 release print which shows the title as ''Fiddling Around'', implying that ''Just Mickey'' was a working title.
*This is the first time the William Tell Overture is featured in a Mickey Mouse cartoon. The piece was later performed in the 1935 cartoon, [[The Band Concert]].
