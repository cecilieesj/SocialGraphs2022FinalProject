'''''The Moose Hunt''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' short that was released on [[May 3]], [[1931]].

==Synopsis==
Mickey and Pluto hunt for moose, but the hunt was delayed when Mickey thinks he shot Pluto and, later, when Mickey's gun falls apart in the foe's face.

==Characters==
*[[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Walt Disney]])
*[[Pluto]] (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]])

==Releases==
===Television===
* ''[[The Ink and Paint Club]]'', episode #1.37: "Mickey's Pal, Pluto"

===Home video===
'''VHS'''
* ''Pluto's Greatest Hits''
'''DVD'''
* ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]: Mickey Mouse in Black and White, Volume 2''

==Notes==
*This short is notable for having Pluto's only spoken line of dialogue, where he asks Mickey to "kiss [him]".
**However, if one listens very carefully, he also says to Mickey, "The moose!" when the moose arrives.
*During airings on ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', a couple of scenes featuring Mickey shooting with his gun were deleted, and Pluto's "Mammy!" impression, which refers to Al Jolson's famous song "My Mammy," was dubbed over by a single bark. It is for the latter reason that this film is included in the bonus-features "From the Vault" section on the 2004 [[Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD set ''Mickey Mouse in Black and White: Volume Two''.
