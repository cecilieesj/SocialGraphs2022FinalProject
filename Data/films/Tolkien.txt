'''''Tolkien''''' is a [[2019]] American biographical fantasy film. It is the first [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight]] film after Disney's acquisition of Fox on [[March 20]], [[2019]]. It is about the early life of English professor J. R. R. Tolkien, author of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as notable academic works.

==Plot==
Tolkien explores the formative years of the orphaned author as he finds friendship, love, and artistic inspiration among a group of fellow outcasts at school. This takes him into the outbreak of World War I, which threatens to tear the "fellowship" apart. All of these experiences would inspire Tolkien to write his famous Middle-Earth novels.
