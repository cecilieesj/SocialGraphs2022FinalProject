'''''Team Darryl''''' is a [[2018]] American direct-to-video short film featuring the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character [[Grandmaster]] which was produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]].

==Plot==
In [[2018]], Darryl Jacobson moved to [[Los Angeles]] for work which required he find a new housemate. The only one to answer his ad, however, was the [[Grandmaster]] whom Darryl initially believed to be a "Hollywood-type person" before realizing he is in fact an alien. The Grandmaster confirmed that he was once the ruler of a world called Sakaar and has since recruited Darryl as his new assistant/bodyguard to replace the late Topaz. Darryl admitted that though the Grandmaster was a very nice man, he was prone to bouts of extreme immaturity.

When queried as to his future plans, the Grandmaster revealed he decided to become the ruler of Earth. A goal Darryl is actually unsure as to how he would accomplish but has nonetheless been roped into to make a YouTube video announcing the Grandmaster's intentions. Unfortunately, the video has no views beyond Darryl himself prompting the Grandmaster to recruit a band so as to make a second video that advertises the first. The recruited band, however, does not meet the Grandmaster's alien preferences of music and he promptly turns his Melt Stick on David. Later that night, Darryl attempts to coach the Grandmaster in making an apology phone call to David's parents only for the alien to become distracted by a sexual fantasy about David's mother.

On the couch again, the Grandmaster reveals he intends to make Darryl his permanent assistant/bodyguard when he takes over Earth before professing his love to the human prompting Darryl to awkwardly reciprocate to the Grandmaster's smug satisfaction. Darryl later notes that the Grandmaster's personality makes it near impossible to tell whether he simply wants to hang out or melt someone, as such he is starting to miss his old housemate.
