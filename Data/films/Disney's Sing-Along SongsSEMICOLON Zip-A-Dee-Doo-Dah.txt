==Trivia==
*Hosted by [[Professor Owl]].
*The video was originally issued to promote the November 21, 1986 theatrical re-release of ''[[Song of the South]]'', celebrating the film's 40th anniversary, and representing the launch of the new home video series of (as yet, unnumbered) Sing-Along Songs videos.
*"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" comes second after the "[[Mickey Mouse March]]" in spite of headlining the title.
*This video features a short version of the "Mickey Mouse March"; the full version is on ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Collection of All-Time Favorites: The Magic Years|The Magic Years]]''.
*Footage for the song "[[It's a Small World (song)|It's a Small World]]" was taken from ''[[Disneyland Goes to the World's Fair]]'', which aired [[May 17]], [[1964]]. On the song itself, the pitch appears to be shifted one semitone higher on the recording after the snake charmer-style music.
*"Casey Junior", while containing the original footage from ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', also contained footage from ''[[The Brave Engineer]]'' and ''[[Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip]]''.
*"Give a Little Whistle", in addition to the original footage from ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', also contains footage from ''[[Mickey's Delayed Date]]'', ''[[Lend a Paw]]'', ''[[How to Play Football]]'', ''Dumbo'', ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'', ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', ''[[The Vanishing Private]]'', ''[[Melody Time]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Make Mine Music]]'', and ''[[The New Spirit]]''.
*After "The Unbirthday Song" is finished, the footage of the [[Dormouse]] floating down from the fireworks on an umbrella is shown, but his dialogue is re-dubbed to introduce the next song: "Music and magic go hand in hand. They compliment each other. A song can make your dreams come true. That is, if you have a [[Fairy Godmother|fairy godmother]]," which leads to "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."
*Ending footage for the reprise of "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" was taken from "[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (Walt Disney Presents episode)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]" where the Disney gang comes to pay tribute to [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]].
*It was also known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Cancion del Sur: Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]'' in Spanish when it was released in Spain.
*Known as ''Cendrillon: Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo'' in French, released in France and the United States.
*Both the 1994 and 2001 VHS re-release copies are considered the rarest since only a few copies were manufactured into stores.
*The 1986 original print and the 2001 print featured the ''Sorcerer Mickey'' logo with "presents" appearing below it.
*For some reason, the 2001 print starts with the same promo featured at the end of the 1990 print, then goes on to the ''Sorcerer Mickey'' logo and then the 1994 print's intro.
*This is one of the least internationalized volumes in the series, as only English, Spanish, and French versions are known to have ever been made.
