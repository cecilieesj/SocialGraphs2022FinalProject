{{Quote|When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet, "The Rite of Spring" his purpose was, in his own words, "to express primitive life." And so Walt Disney and his fellow artists have take him at the word. Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form, as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant, as the story of the growth of life on Earth. And that story, as you're going to see it, isn't the product of anybody's imagination. It's a coldly accurate reproduction of what science thinks went on during the first few billion years of this planet's existence. Science, not art, wrote the scenario of this picture. According to science, the first living things here were single-celled organisms, tiny little white or green blobs of nothing in particular that lived under the water. And then, as the ages passed, the oceans began to swarm with all kinds of marine creatures. Finally, after about a billion years, certain fish, more ambitious than the rest, crawled up on land and became the first amphibians. And then, several hundred million years ago, nature went off on another tack and produced the dinosaurs. Now, the name "dinosaur" comes from two Greek words meaning "terrible lizard", and they certainly were all of that. They came in all shapes and sizes, from little, crawling horrors about the size of a chicken to hundred-ton nightmares. They were not very bright. Even the biggest of them had only the brain of a pigeon. They lived in the air and the water as well as on land. As a rule, they were vegetarians, rather amiable and easy to get along with. However, there were bullies and gangsters among them. The worst of the lot, a brute named Tyrannosaurus Rex was probably the meanest killer that ever roamed the earth. The dinosaurs were lords of creation for about 200 million years. And then... Well, we don't exactly know what happened. Some scientists think that great droughts and earthquakes turned the whole world into a gigantic dustbowl. In any case, the dinosaurs were wiped out. That is where our story ends. Where it begins is at a time infinitely far back, when there was no life at all on earth. Nothing but clouds of steam, boiling seas and exploding volcanoes. So now, imagine yourselves out in space billions and billions of years ago, looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet, spinning through an empty sea of nothingness|[[Deems Taylor]]|Fantasia}}

'''''The Rite of Spring''''' is the fourth and longest segment in ''[[Fantasia]]''. It mainly focuses on the Big Bang and the Dinosaur age.

==Plot==
The whole score starts off with outer space at the start of the bassoon solo that it goes back in time, back to the fantastic, to 4.5 billion years ago. We see the Milky Way Galaxy coming out of the darkness. Comets, the sun, and shooting stars whiz by. We come down to a planet which is Earth being born and pass by the Earth's moon down to the surface. Light from the volcanoes light up and the volcanoes burst with lava. Then the volcanoes explode. Lava pours down from a volcano with rocks and hits the water, creating a storm and the sea to rise up, flooding the volcano and everything around. Then everything went silent.

The scene changes to the sea when we see the cells like the [[Choanoflagellates]], and blue microscopic blobs that split up, until the black smoke came. We see many sea creatures as the ages rolled by. One of the fish went up to land and became the first amphibian to crawl on land. Later, the dinosaurs appear, living their lives of what dinosaurs do. Up on top of a cliff, [[Pteranodon]]s swoop down to catch fish. One of them caught a fish but is pulled down by a [[Tylosaurus]].

Everything was going so quiet for the dinosaurs. Every dinosaur is doing what the dinosaurs would do. Until then, they look up ahead, as rain begins to fall, and see the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]]. It chases the dinosaurs and bites the [[Stegosaurus]]' tail. The Stegosaurus and the T-rex both fight, with the T-rex biting the Stegosaurus' neck and the Stegosaurus using its tail to beat the T-rex. The dinosaurs look on while Stegosaurus does its last two hits and T-rex bites its neck and brings it down, killing it. The dinosaurs leave while T-rex eats its remains.

Later, everything was destroyed. There was no food and water for the dinosaurs, nothing but dried up pools, branches, ruined trees, and mud. The sun is too hot for them. The dinosaurs move on and some of them are stuck in the mud with [[Ceratosaurus]] coming to them. The wind blows and some dinosaurs collapse, including the T-rex. Later, footprints are seen and we see the bones of the dinosaurs, showing that they are now extinct 65 million years ago.

Just as the moon began to form an eclipse with the sun, an earthquake suddenly erupted, wiping the dinosaur bones away. The wind then blew a storm and the sea inland, the lowland and everything around became completely flooded, and everything was silent once again. In the end, when the eclipse was complete, you see it set over the world of sea and land. The film then goes to either the intermission, which has the only appearance of the ''Fantasia'' title card (which was omitted on the 1991 UK VHS release) or the "Meet the Soundtrack" segment (as seen on the 1990 version as well as the 1991 UK VHS release).

==Trivia==
* A narrated version of the segment, titled "A World is Born", was produced as a school educational filmstrip in 1955, narrated by [[wikipedia:Holling C. Holling|Holling C. Holling]]. It was a mainstay in science classes of the 50s and 60s and would inspire paleontologists such as Stephen Jay Gould to pursue it as a profession.
* The eclipse was reused in the 1980 horror film ''[[The Watcher in the Woods]]''.
* The scene where the dinosaurs turn around to see the Tyrannosaurus rex is reused in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' where the villains turn to see Mickey ready to battle Jafar.
*This segment was originally going much longer and would have shown the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic age of mammals] as well as the dawn of man ending with humans creating fire and dancing triumphantly around a fire circle, but this was sadly scrapped due to human evolution being a controversial subject matter during the 1940s. <ref>https://www.yourclassical.org/story/2015/10/05/rite-spring-fantasia</ref>
**However, a few pieces of concept have surfaced online in the past few years. One piece of artwork uploaded to the internet, which was done in 2006, done by the late artist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Nielsen Kay Nielsen] shows a pair of saber-toothed cats (''Smilodon fatalis'') stalking a trio of woolly mammoths (''Mammuthus primigenius'').<ref>https://www.comicartfans.com/gallerypiece.asp?piece=136616</ref>
*Igor Stravinsky, the composer of The Rite of Spring, would ultimately dislike ''Fantasia'' as a result of the score being re-edited without his permission, alterations that were the result of the aforementioned Age of Mammals and Early Man scenes being cut.<br />
