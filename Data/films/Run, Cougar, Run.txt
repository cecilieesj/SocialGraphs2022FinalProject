'''''Run, Cougar Run''''' is a [[1972]] Walt Disney Productions animal/adventure drama, harkening back to the classic “nature” films which Disney made famous. Directed by [[Jerome Courtland]] and adapted from Robert William Murphy’s "The Mountain Lion", ''Run, Cougar, Run'' stars Stuart Whitman, Frank Aletter and Alfonso Arau.

==Plot==
Utah’s Redrock Mesa region is the setting for a cave-dwelling cougar family. Tragedy strikes when the male cougar is shot by a hunter, leaving Seeta, the mother, to provide for and raise her three cubs. These magnificent animals are captured splendidly as they experience growing up and learning to survive in an often harsh and dangerous environment.

Contrary to accepted belief, Seeta encounters, and is befriended by, a gentle sheepherder (Arau), debunking the myth that cougars and humans can’t co-exist. However, when the hunter returns, intent on tracking down the remainder of the family, Seeta and the shepherd’s relationship is tested mightily.
