'''''Squatter's Rights''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[Pluto]]'' short that was released on [[June 7]], [[1946]]. The cartoon is about a confrontation between Pluto and [[Chip and Dale]] who have taken up residence in Mickey's hunting shack. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in [[1947]], but ultimately lost to ''The Cat Concerto'', a ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon by [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]].

The film was directed by [[Jack Hannah]] and features the voices of Dessie Flynn as Chip and Dale, and [[Pinto Colvig]] as Pluto. Mickey Mouse was voiced by both [[Walt Disney]] and [[Jimmy MacDonald]], making this the debut of MacDonald as Mickey. He would go on to provide Mickey's voice for over 30 years. It was also Mickey's first post-war appearance. With the exception of a very brief cameo in ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1945), Mickey had not appeared in a theatrical film since ''[[Pluto and the Armadillo]]'' in [[1943]].

==Synopsis==
The chipmunks [[Chip and Dale]] wake up one winter morning inside the wood stove they have made their home. The stove is located in [[Mickey Mouse]]'s hunting shack (called "Mickey's Hydout") which appears to have been unoccupied for a while. Soon, Mickey and [[Pluto]] arrive for the hunting season.

Pluto soon discovers that the stove is occupied by the chipmunks and helps Mickey build a fire to smoke them out. Chip and Dale realize what is happening and blow out Mickey's matches and roll of newspaper before they can catch the wood on fire. Finally, Mickey is about to use a can of kerosene which the chipmunks can't blow out. From a hiding place underneath the stove, the chipmunks burn a hole in Mickey's boot with a match. Mickey assumes that Pluto is to blame and scolds him. Mickey remains unaware of the chipmunks throughout the film.

After Mickey leaves to get more wood, Pluto chases Chip and Dale across the room. They lead Pluto across a table and mantle above the fireplace. [[Pluto]] accidentally gets his nose stuck in the muzzle of Mickey's rifle, which is hanging over the fireplace. As [[Pluto]] tries to pull is nose free, he realizes that one of the hooks on which the rifle is mounted is directly in front of the trigger; the more [[Pluto]] pulls, the more he will cause the gun to go off in his face. Gradually, the table which [[Pluto]] is standing on with his hind paws starts to slide back. [[Pluto]] falls and makes the rifle fire, but the rifle's delay is just long enough that [[Pluto]] narrowly avoids the bullet. [[Pluto]] lands on the floor where the rifle hits him on the head momentarily knocking him unconscious. From the table above, [[Chip and Dale]] pour ketchup over the dog to make it look as if he is seriously wounded.

Suddenly, Mickey returns having heard the gunshot, and when he sees Pluto with the rifle beside him, he thinks his beloved pooch is dead. Pluto comes to and first starts to comfort Mickey. But when he sees the ketchup, he starts to panic, thinking it's his blood. Mickey hurriedly carries him off to find help. Thus, Chip and Dale regain working ownership over the property. This transfer of ownership is the reference of the film's title "squatter's rights" which is a form of adverse possession.
