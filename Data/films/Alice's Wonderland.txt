'''''Alice's Wonderland''''' is a 1923 silent short film, made in black and white, produced in Kansas City, Missouri. This short was the first of Walt Disney's ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' and had a working title of ''Alice in Slumberland''. The film was never shown theatrically, but was instead shown to prospective film distributors. It was included as a bonus feature in the [[2010]] Special Un-Anniversary Edition DVD release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

==Plot==
Alice ([[Virginia Davis]]) visits an animation studio, where the animators (including [[Walt Disney]]) show her various scenes on their drawing boards. A few of them: a cat dancing to a cat band; a mouse poking at a cat until it moves; a cat and dog boxing, while the animators crowd around cheering and acting as corner-men. That night, she dreams of taking a train to cartoon-land, where a red carpet reception awaits. She appears in live action. They have a welcoming parade, with Alice riding on an elephant. The cartoons dance for her, and she dances for them. Meanwhile, the lions break out of the zoo. The lions chase her into a hollow tree, then into a cave and down a rabbit hole. Finally, she jumps off a cliff and awakes back in her bed. Alice is woken up by her mother, and Alice tells her mother about her strange dream...

* This is the final short film to be produced by [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio]] and the only ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' short to do so. Subsequent animated short films beginning with ''[[Alice's Day at Sea]]'' would be produced by the [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio]] instead.
