An '''''Untitled Alien film''''' is an upcoming American science-fiction horror film, serving as a "standalone" installment and the seventh film overall in Alien franchise. It will be released on [[Hulu]].

==Production==
After the acquisition of [[21st Century Fox]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], it was officially confirmed at the [[2019]] CinemaCon that future Alien films are in development. In May 2019, Variety reported that the third prequel film was "in the script phase", with Ridley Scott attached to serve once again as director. In September 2020, Scott confirmed that work on the next instalment is ongoing, but was undecided with keeping it tied in with the plot set out in Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. In August 2021, however, a news report concluded that a sequel is currently uncertain.<ref>[https://www.slashfilm.com/591541/will-there-be-a-sequel-to-alien-covenant-heres-what-we-know/ Will There Be A Sequel To Alien: Covenant?
