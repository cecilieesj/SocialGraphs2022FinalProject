==Synopsis==
The film shows a story of children from a South African town flying kites down a hill after one boy is inspired by a colorful feather floating from the sky. The children find materials from places all over the town and produce equally colorful kites. After a walk, they fly the kites and release them into the sky for the ending of the film.

==Production==
The short film takes its title and inspiration from [[One by One]], a "freedom song" written and performed by [[Lebo M]] for ''[[The Lion King]]''. Although the song was cut from the final film, it did make it into the [[Disney Theatrical Group|Disney Theatrical]] [[The Lion King (musical)#Songs|adaptation]], before being used on this short.<ref name=awn1 />
