'''''The Mail Pilot''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon that debuted on [[May 13]], [[1933]].

==Summary==
Mickey the mail pilot is entrusted with a chest of money. He battles rain and snow, but his biggest battle is against Pete, who has a plane equipped with a machine gun and a harpoon cannon. Mickey's plane quickly loses its wings and propeller to Pete's armaments, but he improvises a helicopter blade with a clothes-drying rack, then, when that gives way, a replacement prop from a windmill. At this point, Pete harpoons him, and Mickey drags Pete through a bell tower, demolishing Pete's plane. Mickey delivers the money to Minnie and brings Pete to the authorities.

==Characters==
*[[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Walt Disney]])
*[[Minnie Mouse]] (voiced by [[Marcellite Garner]])
*[[Pete]] (voiced by [[Billy Bletcher]])

== Trivia ==

* This is the first cartoon where [[Billy Bletcher]] voices Pete, after having made a strong impression on the Disney studio when he voiced the [[Big Bad Wolf]] in [[Walt Disney]]’s ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'' released the same year. Bletcher defined Pete’s character as a whole, infusing the villain's voice with a speech pattern inspired by 1920s and 1930s gangsters, using such phrases as "See?!", "Tough guy, eh?", and referring to law enforcement as "Coppers". Bletcher would continue voicing Pete until [[1960]] when the Disney studio closed down the short films department.

==Comic strip adaptation==
