'''''The Little Whirlwind''''' is a [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] short that was released in [[1941]].

==Plot==
Mickey offers to clean [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]]'s yard in exchange for a piece of her homemade cake. But it's easier said than done when a [[Little Whirlwind|little whirlwind]] keeps him from finishing his chore. After many unsuccessful attempts of getting rid of it, he starts chasing it away with a rake until it calls for its mother for help. [[Mama Whirlwind]] arrives and starts chasing Mickey, sucking everything in her path in the process, and eventually Mickey himself. After wrecking Minnie's yard and dropping Mickey on her fountain, the two whirlwinds leave. Shortly after, Minnie comes outside and finds that her yard looks worse than before. Thinking that Mickey caused the mess, she angrily throws the cake at him, which Mickey then starts to eat as the cartoon ends.

==Characters==
*[[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Walt Disney]])
*[[Minnie Mouse]] (voiced by [[Thelma Boardman]])
*[[Little Whirlwind]]
*[[Mama Whirlwind]]

==Trivia==
*This cartoon introduced new, unique designs for both Mickey and Minnie that were short-lived. These changes in the designs included a slimmer body, perspective ears and a bigger head, hands and feet as well as the absence of a tail. They were also given buck teeth, but only shown when they're whistling. These designs would last until [[1946]] short ''[[Squatter's Rights]]''.
* Much of the animation of the Big Whirlwind is taken from ''[[The Band Concert]]''.
* This cartoon was featured in ''[[Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse]]''.
* Storyboards for this cartoon have Mickey drawn with his older, more circular ears, as they were made before his design was updated for the finished film.

*The majority of Mickey's antics with the whirlwind, including Mickey's inability to keep the leaves in the basket, the whirlwind leading the leaves in a parade, and Mickey trapping the whirlwind in a bag.
*Mickey mowing the grass as he is being chased by Mama Whirlwind.
