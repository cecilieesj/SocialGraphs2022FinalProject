'''''Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons''''' was an animated film released in the United States on [[May 19]], [[1937]], for a limited time to help promote the upcoming release of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. It was a collection of five Oscar-winning ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' shorts, bridged together with title cards and a narrator. Like ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'', each of the cartoons had been released on its own at first before being collected together as one film. The separate cartoon shorts are now available on [[DVD]].

At approximately 41 minutes, the film does not seem to fulfill today's expectations for a feature film. However, ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'', which at approximately 42 minutes also does not seem to meet the criterion, is considered by Disney as one of their Animated Classic Features (the official BFI, AMPAS and AFI definition of a feature film requires it to be over 40 minutes long, of which it does meet). When excluding the live action between the animated segments, the total amount of actual animation in ''Saludos Amigos'' is even less than an ''Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons''. The official book ''Disney A to Z'' by Dave Smith, however, does not include the film in its feature film list.

''Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons'' was re-released and updated with additional four shorts in 1966 with no narration.

Both versions of the film were released in the United Kingdom on VHS on June 21, 1993. Both versions of the film were released in Japan on Laserdisc on June 21, 1985.
