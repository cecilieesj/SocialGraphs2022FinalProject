The original date was to have been December 1, however, a speech at the [[Wikipedia:United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy]] by United States President [[Wikipedia:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]] postponed the debut for a week. The special also aired on [[Freeform]] as part of their annual 25 Days of Christmas programming blocks from 2009 to 2018 (it was oddly absent from the line-up in 2019 and 2020, despite said event still including the sequel).

==Plot==
The setting is a high-tech command center at the North Pole, where an elf named Magee (voiced by Sarah Chalke), the North Pole Christmas Eve Command Center Coordinator (NPCECCC for short) pairs a disgruntled elf named Wayne (Dave Foley), who after working tirelessly on Prep & Landing for 227 years, doesn't receive an expected promotion to be the Director of Naughty List Intelligence, which went to his sidekick Peterson. Instead, Magee partners Wayne with Lanny (Derek Richardson), an idealistic rookie who has an undying enthusiasm for Christmas, to prepare the world for the annual trip of Santa Claus. However, they get more than they can bargain for when a young boy named Timmy Terwelp captures them in action, enabling Lanny to respark the spirit of Christmas in Wayne. Meanwhile, Miss Holly, Santa's assistant gives a briefing back at the North Pole on the trip, and Magee gets word of a storm over Section 7, where they are located and utters "Oh, frostbite" and calls out a code of "figgy pudding", passing by Timmy's house, but Wayne decides to override Magee's call to pass by and visit the house. However, prep is lost when their tracking and landing device is lost in said snowstorm so they improvise from a display using an inflatable Santa snow globe, and save Santa's sleigh from disaster. In the end, Santa gives Wayne a snowglobe with a miniature version of Timmy's house, and they see him enjoying Christmas... and turns down a promotion to being in charge of the Nice List Intelligence.

==Production==
Prep & Landing was originally pitched by director Chris Williams as a short film for the newly re-opened theatrical shorts program at WDAS. Liking the idea, [[John Lasseter]] (Chief Creative Officer of Disney Animation) considered it to work best as a television special and with ABC executives were keen to repeat the success of the 2007 DreamWorks Animation special ''Shrek the Halls'', approved the project.

Following Williams' directorial debut on the short film, ''Glago's Guest'', he was moved on to co-direct the feature film ''[[Bolt]]''. The special continued production under the control of directors Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers-Skelton (Goofy's How to Hook Up Your Home Theater).

==Hidden Gags==
*In one scene, ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' is shown on the television of Lanny and Wayne's assigned house in tribute to John Lasseter's first stint at Disney, and Timmy Terwelp's name is a tribute to Tiny Tim.
*Santa's sleigh is codenamed "Rosebud" after the sled of [[Wikipedia:Orson Wells|Orson Wells]]' titular character in ''[[Wikipedia:Citizen Kane|Citizen Kane]]''.
*The "Go" code for launch is "Dash away," used before Magee authorizes launch. (As in, "Dash away, dash away, dash away all")
*The latitude and longitude of Timmy Terwelp's residence (N 34' 9' 20" / W 118' 19' 23") are in actuality that of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s world headquarters in Burbank, California; however, the site in question is in the Ohio Valley near Cincinnati, where it would snow a lot more than Burbank.
*Director Kevin Deters' hometown is Quincy, Illinois, home to Deter's Dairy. During a scene in which Wayne is "being naughty" and making himself a drink, the milk carton Wayne is using has the Deter's logo.
*The Christmas tree from ''[[Wikipedia:A Charlie Brown Christmas|A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' appears in Magee's office.
*A station wagon with the license plate "12501 WED" is the birthdate of Walt Disney (December 5, 1901).
*The German Shepard who was in the prologue getting dusted to sleep was a recolored version of the titular character of the 2008 film [[Bolt]] which was completing production as Prep & Landing was being made.
*The image of [[Goofy]] used in Timmy Terwelp's bedroom came from the poster for ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theatre''.
*The scene of Christmas Eve prep is all shot from an elf's point of view, which is why you never see Santa's face.
*The home of Timmy Terwelp seen in the snowglobe is actually based on co-director Kevin Deter's boyhood home, and a giraffe in Terwelp's bedroom represents a plaything that one of Deter's children played with.
*As Wayne prepares to enter Santa's office, Miss Holly is typing the lyrics to "[[Jingle Bells]]".
