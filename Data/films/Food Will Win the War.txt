'''''Food Will Win the War''''' is a [[1942]] Disney animated short film. It was produced under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

==Synopsis==
This short was produced to give encouragement to the hard-fighting but underfed and undersupplied U.S. Allies as well as remind domestic audiences of the importance of farmers to the war effort and to offset "panic fears" that "we're sending all our food overseas...we're going to starve."
