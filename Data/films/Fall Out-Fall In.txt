'''''Fall Out-Fall In''''' is an animated short starring [[Donald Duck]], it was originally released on [[April 23]], [[1943]].

==Synopsis==
Donald experiences one of the joys of army life; the extended march with an overnight respite in an uncooperative pup tent.

Donald Duck is ordered to go on a march. Donald is devoted to this, marking off the number of miles he has marched on the pack of the soldier in front of him. Donald's unit marches farther away from civilization, marked by signs that show his home base increasingly farther away. Donald marches through fair weather, then rain, then snow, and then a sweltering desert. To be expected, the elements and fatigue take their toll on Donald, as he is buried in snow then later tooting like a calliope in the heat. Donald's commander orders the unit to halt, and Donald is shocked by how many miles he has marched, which are marked on the soldier ahead of him in addition to his pack. Donald sees dinner being served and excitedly rushes to grab some food, but not until he sets up his pup tent. It takes Donald only seconds to pitch his tent, but a series of mishaps cause it to unfurl. The tent later shrinks when Donald dumps water on it.

At night, Donald is kept awake by the snoring of various other members, to include the bugler, machine gunner and mortarman. Donald manages to get some sleep, but only enjoys a brief respite before the bugler sounds reville. Donald is ordered to immediately break camp, to which he unknowingly has his gear wrapped around a pine tree. When ordered to march, Donald uproots the tree, carrying it with him as he marches in the rear of his unit.
