==Synopsis==
===Evacuating D'Qar===
{{Quote|There were heroes on that mission.''"<br />"''Dead heroes. No leaders.|Poe Dameron and Leia Organa|<ref name="Movie">{{Film|VIII}}</ref>}}
[[File:Black_One_vs_Fulminatrix_.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Poe flies the ''Black One'' against the ''Fulminatrix''.]]
Following [[Battle of Starkiller Base|their successful operation to destroy Starkiller Base]], [[Resistance]] fighters [[Battle of D'Qar|evacuate]] their [[Resistance base|main base]] on the planet [[D'Qar]] onto their [[Resistance navy|fleet]]. Before they can complete their evacuation, a [[First Order]] fleet of [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers]] under [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]] arrive. Seeking to destroy the Resistance, Hux orders [[Captain]] [[Moden Canady]] to destroy the Resistance fleet and base with his [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought]] ''[[Fulminatrix]]''.

After the ''Fulminatrix'' exits hyperspace, one of General Hux's officers reports that a single fighter is flying to confront them. Together with [[Gender|his]] [[BB-series astromech droid]], [[BB-8]], [[Poe Dameron]] confronts the ''Fulminatrix'' in his [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|X-wing]] ''[[Black One]]''. General [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], now [[Marriage|widowed]] by the [[Death|murder]] of [[Han Solo]] at the [[Limb|hands]] of their own son [[Ben Solo|Ben, alias Kylo Ren]], cautiously approves Poe's reckless plan. Over the intercom, Poe taunts Hux and pretends to ignore his threat to wipe out the Resistance. However, this verbal exchange turns out to be a ruse for Poe to power up his X-wing's cannons for an assault on the dreadnought.

Poe's X-wing quickly takes out the dreadnought's [[Point-defense laser cannon|point-defense cannons]]. When General Hux demands to know why Captain Canady is not shooting down the enemy fighter, Canady replies that the ship is too small and at too close range. He bellows orders to scramble the fighters, realizing that Poe wants to take out his cannons. Despite being attacked by [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE/fo fighters]] and [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter|TIE/sf fighters]], Poe calls upon BB-8 to fix the ship's cannons so they can take out the dreadnought's last cannon.

Canady's dreadnought manages to destroy the Resistance base from orbit but not before the last transport led by [[Lieutenant]] [[Kaydel Ko Connix]] escapes into space. With the evacuation complete, General Organa wants to evacuate the Resistance forces but Poe wants to take out the dreadnought. Disobeying General Organa's orders to disengage, Poe continues with the assault. BB-8 completes the repairs and Poe takes out the last cannon before shooting down the two pursuing TIE fighters.

===Bomber run===
[[File:The_Last_Jedi_Space_Battle.png|thumb|right|250px|Resistance StarFortress bombers advancing on the First Order.]]
With the Dreadnought's cannon's knocked out, [[MG-100 StarFortress SF-17|Resistance bombers]] advanced on the ''Fulminatrix''. Despite having starfighter escorts led by [[Blue Leader]] [[Tallissan Lintra]], several of the slow moving bombers are destroyed by TIE fighters. Captain Canady orders that the dreadnought's auto cannons be recharged so that they can target the Resistance cruisers. Several Resistance bombers are destroyed by a colliding TIE fighter, leaving [[Paige Tico]]'s ''[[Cobalt Hammer]]'' as the last remaining bomber.

As the auto cannons recharge, Canady orders his TIE fighters to destroy the last bomber. Poe contacts Paige who heads down to her bomber's bay only to find the bombardier [[Nix Jerd]] knocked unconscious. After a colliding TIE fighter kills the pilot [[Finch Dallow]], Paige manually releases the bomb load just as the Dreadnought's auto-cannon finishes recharging. The ''Fulminatrix'' and the ''Cobalt Hammer'' are destroyed in the ensuing explosions.

Despite the elimination of the dreadnought, General Organa is displeased by the high casualties including the loss of all of the Resistance's bombers. The Resistance vessels escape by jumping to [[hyperspace]].

Shortly later, [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]] confronts Hux via hologram transmission for his failure to block the evacuation and the loss of a dreadnought. He publicly humiliates Hux by using [[the Force]] to spin him on the floor. Despite Snoke's disappointment, Hux insists the Resistance cannot escape for long because they have them "tied on the end of a string."

Aboard the [[MC85 Star Cruiser]] [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']], [[Finn]], comatose after losing a fight with Ren on Starkiller Base, awakens and immediately starts looking for his friend, [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]]. Poe welcomes Finn back upon his return, telling him Rey has already left.

===Finding Skywalker===
[[File:Rey_returns_lightsaber_TLJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rey meeting Luke Skywalker.]]
Having arrived on the water world of [[Ahch-To]] with the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]] and [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', the [[Force-sensitive]] Rey meets Jedi Master [[Luke Skywalker]]. She hands him [[Skywalker lightsaber|Skywalker's lightsaber]] but he tosses it over his shoulder and walks away. A puzzled Rey follows Luke into his hut in the nearby [[Jedi village]].

Outside his door, Rey tells him that he needs his help. She returns to retrieve Skywalker's lightsaber and spots Skywalker's [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] submerged beneath the sea. Later, Rey has Chewbacca break down Skywalker's door. Skywalker recognizes Chewbacca and Rey tells them that they came on the ''Falcon''. Skywalker asks where is Han Solo.

===Snoke's lair===
[[File:Episode_VIII_Snoke_and_Kylo_Ren.png|thumb|right|250px|Kylo Ren in the presence of Supreme Leader Snoke.]]
Kylo Ren exits a [[turbolift]] and enter Supreme Leader Snoke's [[Snoke's throne room|throne room]] aboard the [[Mega-class Star Dreadnought|''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Supremacy]]''. Snoke commends Hux for his plan and sends him to the bridge to oversee the pursuit of the Resistance. After Hux leaves, Snoke recalls seeing in Ren the potential to become a new [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], but now doubts his apprentice's resolve to fully embrace the [[dark side of the Force]].

He orders Ren to remove his helmet, and upon seeing his scarred face&mdash;the result of his loss to Rey on Starkiller Base&mdash;he states that Ren has too much of Han's heart in him. Ren protests, claiming he embraced the dark side by killing Han, but Snoke furiously retorts that Ren instead psychologically weakened himself in committing the murder, causing him to be defeated by Rey, a junk scavenger who had previously never even wielded a lightsaber.

Ren reacts angrily to the insult, but Snoke repulses him with [[Force lightning]] and dismisses him as just "a child in a mask." Enraged, Ren destroys his helmet by violently smashing it to pieces against the walls of an elevator, before setting out in his personal [[TIE/vn space superiority fighter|TIE silencer]] to attack the Resistance fleet.

===The elusive teacher===
{{Quote|I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi...to end.|Luke Skywalker, to Rey|<ref name="Movie" />}}
[[File:Green_milk.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker was disillusioned by the failure of Ben Solo.]]
Back on Ahch-To, Rey updates him about the First Order's [[First Order-Resistance War|invasion]] of the galaxy. She tells him that they need his help and that they need Luke Skywalker. Skywalker refuses to help because he believes he stands little chance against the First Order and walks away. Rey insists that she is not leaving and follows him through the [[Temple Island]].

She finds Skywalker milking a [[Thala-siren]] but he avoids her. Skywalker uses a long pole to reach the other side of the cliff and catch a large fish. Rey follows him through the rain back to his quarters, fingering her [[S-thread transmitter bracelet|cloaked binary beacon]]. While following Skywalker up a mountain in the mist, she senses a voice calling to her from the [[Tree library]]. Inside, she finds the [[Sacred Jedi texts]].

Skywalker follows her and explains that the tree library was built a thousand generations ago to keep the sacred Jedi texts. Rey says that she saw this place in a dream. When Rey tells Skywalker that the Resistance sent her, he asks about her identity, homeworld, and motivations for coming here. Rey tells him that Resistance needs his help because of the First Order. When Skywalker asks what she is doing here, she tells him that she needs his help to master the Force. Skywalker refuses to teach her, believing that it is time for the Jedi to end. Rey says his sister Leia sent him and that they deserve to know why.

===Pursuing the Resistance fleet===
[[File:AttackOnTheResistanceFleet-TLJ.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Supremacy'' pursuing the Resistance fleet through space.]]
While the ''Raddus'' travels through hyperspace, General Organa grieves over the loss of Han. After the fleet exits hyperspace, Leia angrily reprimands and demotes Poe to captain for disobeying orders and leading Cobalt Squadron to their deaths. Poe protests but Leia tells him that there are things that he cannot solve by getting into an X-wing and blowing things up. Poe says that the fallen were heroes but Leia responds that they need living fighters and not dead heroes.

When Finn asks General Organa how Rey is going to find them, she shows him her cloaked binary beacon. Leia tells hers subordinates that their priorities now is to find a new Resistance base. They are soon followed by a First Order fleet led by Snoke's personal command ship, the ''Supremacy'', which has somehow tracked them through space. Poe thinks they should do another hyperspace jump but Leia realizes that the First Order has tracked them through lightspeed, and another jump would use up the rest of their [[fuel]]. Poe gets General Organa's permission to lead a starfighter defense.

Kylo Ren flies his TIE silencer, accompanied by three Special Forces TIE fighters, which inflict significant damage on the Resistance fleet. Before Poe and BB-8 can board their X-wing, Kylo Ren fires a pair of [[Torpedo/Legends|torpedos]] into the ''Raddus''<nowiki/>' starboard hangar which destroy all the parked fighters and kill several pilots, including Lintra. Poe and a damaged BB-8 survive the explosion. Meanwhile, General Organa and [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]] order the remaining Resistance ships to move out of range of the Star Destroyers.

Lining up for a bombing run on the ''Raddus''<nowiki/>' bridge, Ren hesitates to fire after sensing his mother's presence on board. However, his TIE fighter escorts take the shot, destroying the primary bridge and killing most of the Resistance's high command, including Admiral Ackbar. Ren then retreats to the ''Supremacy'' after General Hux warns that the fleet cannot protect him and his escort TIE fighters. A long pursuit begins, with the Resistance relying on their spaceships' mobility and [[deflector shield]]s to stay out of effective weapons range while their fuel supplies dwindle.

Leia survives exposure to space by using the Force to fly back to the door of the ''Raddus''<nowiki/>' bridge. Leia is rescued by her Resistance comrades but is rendered comatose by the ordeal. As she is being transported to the sick bay, the binary beacon falls out of her hand. Finn picks it up.

===A change of heart===
[[File:Dont_eat_our_friends.png|thumb|left|250px|A group of porgs confronting Chewbacca over the loss of their kin.]]
While Rey sleeps in her hut, Chewbacca roasts a [[porg]] over the fire. While settling to his meal, he is confronted by the porg's kin. Chewbacca tries to shoo them away but is struck by the sight of a sad-faced porg.

Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker visits the ''Falcon'' where he finds [[Han Solo's dice]], a memento to his fallen friend. Skywalker also has a brief reunion with R2-D2. Skywalker refuses to come back but R2-D2 plays back the old [[hologram]] message from his sister Leia calling [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] for help. Leia's message causes Luke to reconsider his decision. He visits Rey and agrees to give her three lessons, beginning tomorrow morning. Skywalker promises to teach her the ways of the [[Jedi]].

===A new commander===
[[File:Amilyn_Holdo_Ellen.png|250px|thumb|Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo assumes leadership of the Resistance.]]
Back aboard the ''Raddus'', [[Commander]] [[Larma D'Acy]] informs the assembled Resistance that General Organa is stable but in a coma. She regrets to inform them that Admiral Ackbar and the [[Resistance High Command]] perished aboard the bridge of the ''Raddus''. D'Acy tells them that if Leia were here, she would tell them to save their sorrow till after the fight. The chain of command falls to [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo|Holdo]] of the cruiser ''[[Ninka]]''. Holdo gives a brief rousing speech before dismissing them to their posts.

Poe warns Vice-Admiral Holdo that they will eventually run out of fuel. When he asks her what is their plan, Holdo reminds Poe of his demotion and dismisses him as a "hot-head" pilot whose recklessness she deems a liability. Holdo orders him to stick to his post and follow her orders. Holdo's actions grate Poe, who doesn't trust his new commander.

Finn, fearing for Rey's safety if she eventually returns to the fleet, decides to go looking for her and heads for the [[escape pod]] bay. There, he finds a young Resistance mechanic, [[Rose Tico]], mourning her older sister Paige, who perished during the bombing run Poe led over D'Qar. Rose mistakes Finn for a deserter. Before he can explain himself, she [[stun]]s him.

After awakening on a gurney, Finn tries to tell Rose about his plan to find Rey. Rose thinks that Finn is being selfish. He manages to gain her trust by convincing her that he can help take out the First Order's [[hyperspace tracker]], which he is privy to due to his time with the First Order. The two come up with a plan to infiltrate the Mega-Destroyer and take out the hyperspace tracker.

Finn and Rose share their plan with Poe and C-3PO in Leia's [[Medical bay]] room. Not trusting Vice-Admiral Holdo's leadership, Poe agrees to the plan, believing that it can save the Resistance and Rey. C-3PO says that Holdo will not agree to their plan but Poe is determined to proceed. Since they can't get through the First Order security, they contact [[Maz Kanata]], who is embroiled in a union dispute. While exchanging fire, Maz tells them to seek out the [[Master Codebreaker]] in the casino city [[Canto Bight]]. Before leaving to [[Mission to Canto Bight|seek out]] the Master Codebreaker, Finn passes Leia's binary beacon to Poe.

===Rey's first lesson===
[[File:Rey_and_Luke_First_Lesson_TLJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Luke teaching Rey about the nature of the Force]]
Meanwhile on Ahch-To, Rey and Kylo Ren begin communicating with each other through involuntary shared [[Force vision|visions]]. Rey is hostile to Kylo due to their last encounter. Startled by Ren, Rey shoots a hole through the roof of a hut, which annoys the native [[Lanai]] caretakers, who have maintained the Jedi structures since they were built.

Later that morning, Luke leads Rey through a cave into the [[First Jedi Temple]]. Skywalker quizzes Rey about her knowledge of the Force, telling her that the Force is not simply a power but is the energy that binds all things. For her first lesson, he tells her to close her eyes, breathe and reach out. Luke tickles her with a leaf.

During the lesson, Skywalker tells her to breathe and reach out with her feelings while touching rocks. Through the Force, Rey sees the island, the cycle of life and death, warmth, cold, peace, and violence. When prompted, she tells Luke that she sense the Force inside. Skywalker explains that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, urging her to reject her simplistic view of the Force as cleanly defined between the [[Light side of the Force|light]] and the dark sides of the Force.

Rey senses a [[Mirror cave|place beneath]] that is strong in the dark side beneath the island. Rey senses it calling out to her as the stones beneath her float. This summons a geyser of water. Rey says that it was trying to show her something Luke is alarmed that Rey showed little inclination to resist the dark side. Not being able to sense Skywalker in the Force, Rey realizes that Skywalker has cut himself off from the Force. Skywalker says he has seen this raw strength before in Ben Solo and that he regrets not taking action back then.

Later, Chewbacca has befriended several porgs, who have made their home aboard the ''Falcon''. Rey asks Chewbacca if they have heard anything from the Resistance to which he replies in [[Shyriiwook]] that he hasn't. Rey and Ren continue to experience shared visions, and Rey excoriates him for murdering Han Solo, while Ren mocks her need to find replacement parental figures, first in Han and now Luke. Kylo Ren asks Rey if Skywalker told him [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|what happened]] at [[Jedi Temple of Luke Skywalker|his Jedi Temple]].

===Misadventures on Canto Bight===
[[File:Canto_Bight_TLJ.png|thumb|right|250px|Finn and Rose traveled to Canto Bight to seek the Master Codebreaker]]
With the help of Poe, Finn, Rose, and BB-8 slip out of the Resistance fleet in a [[Resistance transport pod]]. Poe warns them that their mission is urgent because they only have 18 hours of fuel left. The travel to Canto Bight on the planet [[Cantonica]] in the [[Corporate Sector]]. The three Resistance operatives park their transport on a public beach, antagonizing the [[Abednedo]] businessman [[Slowen Lo]], who alerts the [[Canto Bight Police Department]] and tells them that the offworlders went to the [[Canto Casino and Racetrack|Canto Casino]].

While Finn is mesmerized by the wealth and opulence of the Canto Bight, Rose tells him that the city is built on exploitation. While watching a [[fathier]] race at the Canto Bight racetrack, she explains that she came from a mining system that was exploited by the First Order, who later tested their weapons on them. The two witness a child racer being beaten by the overseer [[Bargwill Tomder]]. Finn realizes that Canto Bight is the haunt of wealthy war profiteers who sell weapons to both the First Order and the Resistance.

BB-8 spots the Master Codebreaker dancing with "[[Lovey]]" and alerts Finn and Rose. However, they are spotted by Slowen Lo. Finn and Rose are stunned by the Canto Bight police officers, who have them arrested for committing parking violation 27B/6. Lovey notices the commotion but the Master Codebreaker is engrossed with a game of dice. BB-8 is thrown out of the casino by the police.

===Rey's second lesson===
After parrying with her staff, Rey practices with Skywalker's lightsaber while Luke watches. She uses her lightsaber to cut through a pillar of rock, which smashes a wagon belonging to two Lanai caretakers. Later that evening, Skywalker explains that now that the Jedi are extinct, they are deified and romanticized. He believes that the legacy of the Jedi is failure, arrogance and hubris because they failed to prevent the rise of [[Darth Sidious]] and his [[Galactic Empire]].

Skywalker reminds Rey that it was a Jedi Master who was responsible for training Darth Vader. Rey reminds Skywalker about the redemption of his father. However, Luke is still tormented by the guilt of his failure to keep Ben Solo from falling to the dark side, believing that he failed his sister and Han. Luke explains that he he sensed the darkness growing in Ren. When he went to confront him, Skywalker claims that Solo turned on him. When he awoke, Skywalker found his temple in flames and that Ben had taken some of his students and slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke but Luke blamed himself. Rey reassures Luke that the galaxy made him a legend and that she needs his help to find her place in this.

===Escaping Canto Bight===
{{Quote|It's all a machine, partner. Live free. Don't join.|DJ, to Finn|<ref name="Movie" />}}
[[File:DJ_in_Jail.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unable to find the Master Codebreaker, Finn and Rose sought the help of DJ instead.]]
In space, General Hux orders the destruction of the Resistance [[Nebulon-C escort frigate|medical frigate]] [[Anodyne (Nebulon-C)|''Anodyne'']]. However, the [[Unidentified Anodyne pilot|captain]] has already evacuated the ship and stays behind as it is engulfed. Vice-Admiral Holdo watches in horror. When Lieutenant Connix reminds her that they only have six hours of fuel left, she orders the emergency bridge crew to remain on their current cause. Poe worries about Finn and Rose's mission and sends a message that they are running on fumes.

At the [[Canto Bight police headquarters]], Finn and Rose encounter the [[slicer]] [[DJ]], who offers to help them disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker in return for freedom. With the help of BB-8, the Resistance operatives and DJ escape the police headquarters through the sewers. Pursued by the police, they head to the fathier stables, where Rose convinces the stable children to help them escape, leaving one of them, [[Temiri Blagg]], a Resistance [[ring]].

Temiri releases the fathiers, creating a stampede that allows Finn and Rose to escape through the streets of Canto Bight. Riding on a fathier, the two flee to the beach in an attempt to reach their transport pod. However, it is destroyed by pursuing [[Canto Bight Mounted Police]]'s [[Zephyr GB-134 speeder|speeders]]. Their fathier carries them up a hill to the outskirts of the city where they narrowly avoid falling off a cliff. Rose frees their fathier. Before the Mounted Police can catch up with them, they are picked up by DJ and BB-8, who have stolen the luxury [[yacht]] ''[[Libertine]]''.

===The cave===
[[File:Mirror_mirror_on_the_wall.png|thumb|right|250px|Rey faces her own reflection in the cave.]]
Back on Ahch-To, Luke revisits the cliff-side outcrop where he first began training Rey and attempts to re-open his connection to the Force, succeeding when he makes mental contact with an unconscious Leia. Meanwhile, Rey continues her conversation with Kylo Ren and demands to know why he hated his father Han. Noticing he is bare-chested, she asks if Kylo has something he can put on. Kylo Ren claims that his father treated him like garbage and that he was taken advantage of by Luke and his parents.

Recounting his version of his falling out with Skywalker. Ren claims to Rey that Luke grew afraid of Ren's growing power and tried to murder him while he was asleep and defenseless. He tells Rey to let the past die and to kill it if she has to, adding that it is the only way to realize her potential. Sensing the call of the dark side, Rey travels to a cavern beneath the island where the dark side is powerful and experiences a vision while touching a reflective rock wall, asking to see her parents but seeing only her own reflection.

===Revelations===
[[File:Luke_interrupting_Rey_and_Kylo_Ren.png|thumb|left|250px|Luke discovering Rey and Kylo Ren communing with each other.]]
Unable to find answers about her origins and family, she resolves to abandon her Jedi training and leave Ahch-To. Rey returns to her hut where she communes with Kylo Ren. Finding a kindred spirit in Ren, she reaches out through the Force connection to hold his hand. They are soon discovered by Luke, by now reconnected to the Force. Luke angrily destroys Rey's hut with the Force and demands that she leave Ahch-To immediately, but Rey attacks him in her rage.

Luke fends off Rey's attacks and disarms her, but submits when she threatens him with his own lightsaber. He confessed that he contemplated killing a sleeping Ben Solo upon discovering his corruption by Snoke but instantly relented when he realized that it was a passing moment. Ben, however, awoke to see Luke standing over him with an ignited lightsaber and immediately counterattacked, destroying Luke's new Jedi Temple and disappearing to become Kylo Ren.

Rey believes that Kylo Ren can still be saved from the dark side. Skywalker warns her that it is not going to end the way that she thinks. Rey is adamant despite Skywalker's warnings. She tries to return his lightsaber to him but he lets her keep it. Rey believes that Kylo Ren is their last hope. Unable to convince Luke to join the Resistance, Rey leaves Ahch-To without him to confront Ren, hoping to turn him to the light side, succeeding where Luke failed.

===An unexpected reunion===
[[File:Yoda_and_Luke_TLJ.png|thumb|right|250px|Luke and Yoda discuss the importance of masters.]]
Following Rey's departure aboard the ''Falcon'', Luke returns to the Tree library with a torch, intending to destroy the ancient Jedi texts. However, he is interrupted by the [[Force spirit]] of [[Yoda]]. As Luke hesitates at the task, Yoda himself summons a thunderbolt to destroy the library. Skywalker tries to enter the tree but is driven back by the flames.

Yoda remarks that he has missed Skywalker. Seeing the tree burning, Skywalker believes that it is time for the Jedi to end. Yoda counters that it is time to look past "old books." When Skywalker reminds him about the sacred Jedi texts, Yoda responds they were not "page-turners" which contained wisdom but that wisdom already exist. He tells Skywalker not to focus too much on the horizon but to pay attention to his immediate needs.

Skywalker blames himself for the loss of Ben Solo. Skywalker is unconfident teaching Rey, but Yoda encourages him to passed on what he has learnt. Yoda counsels Skywalker that failure can be the greatest teacher. As he and Skywalker watch the burning tree, he tells Luke "We are what they grow beyond. That is the burden of all masters."

===The hyperspace tracker attempt===
[[File:UndercoverFO.png|thumb|left|250px|Finn, Rose, and DJ disguised as First Order officers.]]
While traveling through hyperspace aboard the ''Libertine'', Rose asks DJ if he can disable help them to infiltrate the ''Supremacy'' and disable the hyperspace tracker. When DJ asks for a price, Rose and Finn promise that the Resistance can pay him later. DJ agrees to help in return for receiving Rose's [[gold]] pendant as upfront payment for his services. Finn, knowing how much the pendant means to her, orders DJ to return it, to which the criminal tells him his philosophy: "don't join." Finn also discovers that DJ and BB-8 stole the yacht from an arms dealer selling weapons to both the First Order and Resistance.

Proceeding with their plan, Finn, Rose, DJ, and BB-8 infiltrate the massive ''Supremacy''. After DJ slices through the First Order's sensor systems, he flies the ''Libertine'' inside the massive warship. They steal [[First Order officer]] uniforms from an automated launderette and make their way to a hyperspace tracker. BB-8 is hidden under a trash container. However, the intruders are spotted by the First Order astromech droid [[BB-9E]].

While DJ is tinkering with the tracker's systems, Finn tells Poe to be ready to jump into lightspeed at his signal. DJ managed to unlock the inner chamber of the hyperspace tracker. However, Finn and his team are soon apprehended by First Order stormtroopers led by [[First Order Security Bureau]] [[Colonel]] [[Ansiv Garmuth]] and Captain [[Phasma]], who gloatingly welcomes Finn home. BB-8, still disguised, is able to evade capture.

===Poe's mutiny===
[[File:Poe_meets_Holdo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poe clashed with Holdo over the future of the Resistance.]]
By now, the Resistance fleet is down to the ''Raddus'' and General Hux is confident of victory. Aboard the ''Raddus'', Poe angrily confronts Vice-Admiral Holdo for being secretive about her plans. He is anxious that the Resistance is down to one ship and asks what hope they have. Holdo responds that hope is a fleeting faith.

Starring at a computer screen, Poe realizes that Holdo has ordered the refueling of all the [[U-55 orbital loadlifter|Resistance transports]]. He is outraged that Holdo is abandoning the ''Raddus'' and denounces her as both a coward and a traitor. Holdo orders the guards to remove Poe from the bridge. Poe also contacts Finn, who tells him that they managed to find a code-breaker and convinces Poe to buy them more time.

Back on the ''Raddus'', Poe tells Holdo about his unsanctioned plan to send Finn and Rose to disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker. Believing that Poe has placed the Resistance in even more danger, she orders that the transports be prepared for departure.

In response, Poe instigates a mutiny, apprehending Holdo and her command staff. Poe and the mutineers including Lieutenant Connix take over the ship's emergency command bridge and try to restart the ''Raddus''. However, Holdo snatches a blaster and frees herself. C-3PO refuses to take part in the mutiny and heads to the door, which is being disintegrated. When the door collapses, he is startled to encounter a recovered General Organa, who stuns him.

Connix and C-3PO also surrender, ending the mutiny and allowing the evacuation to begin. In the hangar, Leia remarks that Poe is a troublemaker while Holdo remarks that she likes him. Holdo volunteers to stay behind and pilot the cruiser. Leia is unwilling to risk anymore losses but Holdo tells Leia that she taught her how. The two friends part following a handshake.

Later, a dismayed Poe awakes to see the transports evacuating from the ''Raddus''. Commander D'Acy tells Poe that they are evacuating to an old [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] base on nearby [[Crait]]. Leia tells Poe that she approved of Holdo's evacuation plan, and that Holdo was more concerned with protecting the light than being a hero. Holdo wishes her comrades godspeed on the bridge of the ''Raddus''.

===Snoke's trap===
{{Quote|Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you is restored.|Snoke praised Kylo Ren for capturing Rey|<ref name="Movie" />}}
[[File:Snoke_chillin_like_a_villain.png|thumb|left|250px|Snoke "welcomes" Rey into his throne room.]]
As the ''Millennium Falcon'' travels through hyperspace, Rey tells Chewbacca to get to safety as soon as he gets her signal to rendezvous. Rey climbs into her escape pod which is jettisoned out the ''Falcon'' after exiting hyperspace. Rey flies the pod into the hangar where she is greeted by Kylo Ren and a pair of [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]], who place her in binder cuffs.

As Kylo Ren takes Rey up the turbolift to Supreme Leader Snoke's throne room, she tells him that she feels the good in him and that she saw his future. She promises to help him. Kylo Ren responds that he foresaw that she will turn to him and claims to know who her parents are. Snoke is pleased with his apprentice for delivering Rey, telling him that his faith is restored.

Snoke bids Rey to come closer, admiring Rey's strength and remarking that lightness has emerged to meet the rising darkness. Snoke says that he warned Kylo Ren that as his powers grew stronger, so would his equal in the light. He then snatches Skywalker's lightsaber from Ren's hand with the Force. Snoke uses the Force to bring Rey closer to him.

Rey warns him that he underestimates Skywalker, Ben Solo, and her; and that it would be downfall. Snoke claims that he was responsible for the mental connection between her and Ren as part of a plan to find and destroy Luke; exploiting their emotions and desires. Snoke demands that Rey reveal Skywalker's location but she remains defiant. Snoke uses the Force to levitate Rey and probes her mind for Skywalker's location.

Having probed Rey's mind and learned Skywalker's location, Snoke releases his Force grip on Rey and mocks Skywalker for his "wisdom." He vows to destroy Skywalker and the Jedi Order. Rey tries to seize Skywalker's lightsaber with the Force but Snoke uses the Force to hurl it at her. He then uses the Force to levitate her and force her to watch the destruction of the Resistance fleet through a viewport. Rey grabs [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber]] with the Force but the [[Elite Praetorian Guard]]s flash their weapons. Rey charges at Snoke but he uses the Force to throw her to the ground. Kylo retrieves his lightsaber.

===Resistance in peril===
[[File:Episode_VIII_Stormtroopers.png|thumb|right|250px|Finn and Rose faced a public execution in the presence of First Order officers, soldiers, and pilots.]]
Meanwhile, in the ''Supremacy''{{'s}} hangar bay, Finn and Rose are brought out for a public execution in the presence of General Hux, Captain Phasma, and many First Order officers, soldiers, and pilots. Hux slaps Finn and thanks Phasma for her services. Finn and Rose learn that DJ has sold them out for his own freedom and financial gain.

Rose calls DJ a "lying snake" and struggles against her captors. DJ replies that they got caught and that the First Order was offering a better deal. DJ also reveals the Resistance's evacuation plan to the First Order, which is confirmed by the departure of 30 transports from the ''Raddus''. General Hux orders the ''Supremacy'' to open fire on the Resistance transports, destroying several ships and inflicting heavy losses on the Resistance. Vice-Admiral Holdo orders the transports to continue their journey to Crait.

Finn denounces DJ for his treachery but the criminal is indifferent to their struggle, remarking that "they blow you up today and you blow them up tomorrow." DJ claims that it is just business but Finn disagrees. Believing Finn and Rose to be a waste of [[blaster]] bolts, Phasma orders [[Executioner trooper]]s to behead them with [[BL-155 Laser ax]]es.

===Killing Snoke===
{{Quote|You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed. I cannot be beaten. I see his mind. I see his every intent. Yes...I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!|Snoke, to Rey as his final words|<ref name="Movie" />}}
[[File:ReyKyloVsGuards.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey and Kylo join forces against Snoke's guards.]]
Snoke orders Kylo Ren to kill Rey with his lightsaber. Believing he can read Ren's mind, Snoke is jubilant and mocks Rey. However, Kylo Ren uses the Force to activate Skywalker's lightsaber, which impales and cuts Snoke in half, killing the Supreme Leader. Ren uses the Force to pass Skywalker's lightsaber to Rey and the two join forces as the Praetorian guards converge upon them to avenge their fallen master. Kylo kills one with his lightsaber.

Rey manages to kill a Praetorian with her lightsaber but a second Praetorian wraps his [[Bilari electro-chain whip]] around her blade. Rey manages to break free by impaling the guard with her blade. A third guard divides his [[Vibro-arbir blade]] in half and charges at Rey. Ren is cornered by three guards but he breaks free and impales one, before throwing his body into a generator where he is disintegrated. As the three other guards converge on him, Kylo kills two but is grabbed by one who traps him in a headlock.

Rey is trapped by the other guard but manages to break free by dropping her blade and then slashing him. Rey helps Kylo to kill the last guard by handing him Skywalker's lightsaber, which he uses to impale the guard through the head, killing him. Rey implores Kylo Ren to order the First Order gunners to stop bombarding the Resistance fleet but Ren tells her to let the past die including the Jedi, Sith, Resistance and the First Order. He invites her to rule the galaxy by his side.

When Rey refuses, Kylo compels Rey to admit what she thinks she knew all along: that her parents were insignificant junkers who sold her for drinking money, and that they are dead and buried in the wastes of Jakku. He tells her that she comes from nothing and is nothing but not to him. Ren pleads with Rey to join him by his side.

===Holdo's sacrifice===
[[File:Finn_vs_Phasma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Finn fighting Captain Phasma.]]
Seeing the Resistance fleet in peril, Holdo climbs into the helm of the ''Raddus''. Not realizing Holdo's plans, Hux orders the ''Supremacy'' to continue firing. Using the Force, Rey and Kylo struggle for possession of Skywalker's lightsaber until it breaks into two, causing a large explosion.

Watching the ''Raddus'' powering away, Connix thinks she is running away but Poe disagrees. Holdo sacrifices herself to ram the ''Raddus'' into the ''Supremacy'' at [[lightspeed]], cleaving it in two and destroying much of its escort fleet instantly. The resulting explosion sets the ''Supremacy''{{'s}} cargo hold aflame and interrupts Finn and Rose's execution.

Amidst the inferno, Rose helps Finn up and the two search for a shuttle. However, Finn and Rose are cornered by Phasma and several stormtroopers. Before she can eliminate them, BB-8 commandeers a docked First Order [[First Order All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST]] [[walker]] and intervenes, blasting the troopers. Finn and Phasma duel amidst the chaos. Phasma manages to knock Finn to the ground with her staff. Rose and Phasma exchange fire.

With Phasma distracted, Finn knocks her to the ground with his [[Z6 riot control baton]]. With her helmet shattered, Phasma denounces him as "scum" but Finn retorts that he is "rebel scum." Phasma falls to her death in a fiery chasm when the floor beneath her gives way. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 then flee the ''Supremacy'', commandeering a [[Xi-class light shuttle|''Xi''-class light shuttle]].

In Snoke's chamber, Hux surveys the corpses of Snoke and his guards in disbelief. He sees the unconscious Ren and prepares to shoot him, but is forced to relent when Ren awakes. Learning that Rey has escaped on [[Snoke's escape shuttle]], Ren frames her for Snoke's death, but Hux knew that he was lying. Ren then orders Hux to prepare for a ground assault on Crait. This causes Hux to explode in fury at his rival's presumptuousness, but Ren angrily [[Force choke]]s him into submission, declaring himself the new Supreme Leader.

===Battle of Crait===
[[File:Swtlj-Crait-700x300.jpg|left|thumb|The Resistance ski speeders fly towards the First Order.|250px]]
On Crait, the surviving Resistance fighters regroup at the [[Crait outpost|abandoned rebel base]], which was once a mine. General Organa orders her forces to shut the shield door. Pursued by TIE fighters, Finn, Rose, and BB-8 crash-land their stolen shuttle inside the base. Following a brief shootout, a brief reunion ensues with Poe hugging BB-8. Rose leads the search for weapons and finds rusted ammunition and several old [[V-4X-D ski speeder|ski speeders]]. Poe and Leia also send a distress signal to their allies in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], seeking help.

Shortly later, they sense the earth shaking while the [[vulptex|vulptices]] scurry away. They realize that the [[First Order Army]] has arrived with a phalanx of [[First Order All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]], [[All Terrain MegaCaliber Six|AT-M6]] walkers and a [[superlaser siege cannon]]. C-3PO informs the others that BB-8 has done a schematics of the cave and found that there is only one entrance. Finn encourages the Resistance by reassuring them that allies will come and proposes that they take out the siege cannon.

While Resistance soldiers under General [[Caluan Ematt]] man the trenches and laser batteries, Poe, Finn, and Rose lead a charge with 13 old ski speeders to destroy the First Order assault force's massive siege cannon. Realizing that the Resistance is in the mine, Kylo Ren orders his forces to push them and dispatches TIE fighters. The speeders try to break off but several are destroyed by TIE fighters, which also strafe the trenches, killing many Resistance soldiers.

Rose is pursued by three TIE fighters but Rey and Chewbacca arrive in the ''Falcon'', shooting them down. The ''Falcon'' also draws the TIE fighters away, shooting down several. Kylo Ren orders his forces to take that "piece of junk out of the skies." The ''Falcon'' leads the pursuing TIE fighters into a canyon. The ship's rear cannon is crushed against the rocks, but several TIE fighters also collide with the rocks. Chewbacca, with a porg watching, fly the ''Falcon'' into a canyon that leads to the surface.

Finn and Rose approach the superlaser siege cannon, which begins powering up. Supreme Leader Ren and General Hux order their walkers to concentrate fire on the speeders, destroying several. Poe thinks it is a suicide mission and orders Finn to retreat but Finn is determined to take out the cannon. He accelerates his speeder, ignoring Rose's pleas.

Before Finn can complete his suicide mission, Rose prevents Finn from sacrificing himself to destroy the battering ram cannon, which then blasts a hole in the fortress. Poe and the surviving Abednedo pilot retreat into the trenches with the surviving soldiers. Finn climbs out of his wrecked speeder and rescues an injured Rose. When he asks why she stopped his mission, Rose replies that they survive by "saving what we love."

As the superlaser burns through the gate of the Crait base, Kylo Ren orders his forces to storm the base and show no quarter to the Resistance. Connix informs D'Acy that the Resistance broadcast has reached multiple points but that they have received no response. Leia laments that the galaxy has lost hope.

===Light versus darkness===
{{Quote|The Resistance is dead! The war is over! And when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi!''"<br />"''Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi.|Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Movie" />}}
[[File:Luke_Skywalker_on_Crait.png|thumb|right|250px|Luke makes his stand against Kylo Ren.]]
However, Luke suddenly arrives to comfort Leia. After exchanging pleasantries, Luke apologizes and tells Leia that he has come to confront Ren. Leia thinks her son is gone but Luke reassure her that nobody is gone. After handing Han's lucky dice to Leia, Luke walks out through the gate to confront Ren and the First Order while C-3PO and the rest of the Resistance look on.

Outside, Luke confronts Ren alone outside the breached door, giving the surviving Resistance fighters time to escape. Ren orders the First Order walkers to unleash a massive volley of turbolaser fire on Luke's position. Hux questions the amount of firepower but Luke emerges from the blast crater completely unscathed and mocks the First Order's firepower with a brush of his shoulder. Ren resolves to confront Skywalker despite Hux's objections, whom he shoves against the hull of the [[Upsilon-class command shuttle|''Upsilon''-class command shuttle]]'s cockpit.

Finn drags a wounded Rose on a makeshift stretcher into the Crait base while Ren lands his shuttle. Watching the battle, Finn wants to help but Poe realizes that Skywalker is buying them time to escape. Poe says that they are the "spark of resistance" that will burn the First Order down. After seeking C-3PO's advice, Poe decides to follow the vulptices, hoping they would lead them to a hole.

Meanwhile, Rey uses the beacon to track down her Resistance comrades' movements. She manages to track them down by following a group of vulptices. Finn and the Resistance encounter a pile of rocks which the vulptices are able to slip through but is too small for them. Outside, Rey discovers the pile of rocks and uses the Force to lift them. As the Resistance fighters stream out, Rey hugs Finn.

Outside, Kylo Ren confronts his uncle personally in a lightsaber duel on the salt plain outside the base, and asks Luke if he has come to forgive him or to save his soul. Luke replies no as the two draw their blades. Kylo charges at Luke but his uncle repeatedly evades Ren's attacks. Luke apologizes to Ren for failing him, but Ren angrily rejects his apology, declaring the Resistance is dead and the war over, and that with Luke's death shall come the ultimate death of the Jedi.

Luke counters by saying that both the Jedi and the Rebellion are born anew in Rey and the Resistance, and invites Ren to strike him down but tells he will always be with him just like Han. Ren tries, but is surprised to see Luke is still standing. He pokes his blade through Luke's torso, and to his horror it passes through him as if he were a ghost, revealing that Luke is physically still on Ahch-To and has been stalling for time via a non-corporeal [[Force projection]] of himself. Luke says goodbye to his fallen nephew before his projection fades away, leaving Ren furious.

===The Rebellion is reborn===
{{Quote|How do we build a rebellion from this?''"<br />"''We have everything we need.|Rey and Leia Organa|<ref name="Movie" />}}
[[File:Luke_fades_into_the_Force.png|thumb|left|250px|Luke becoming one with the Force.]]
The effort to create the projection was too much for Luke, and he collapses from exhaustion. With the last of his strength, he climbs up to the cliff where he trained Rey and stares out towards Ahch-To's binary sunset, similar to the one he saw on [[Tatooine]] [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|thirty-four years earlier]], before he became a Jedi. Luke then dies, and his body vanishes as he becomes one with the Force.

On Crait, Leia and Rey sense Luke's death. The First Order storms the base, but are too late to prevent the remaining Resistance fighters from escaping aboard the ''Falcon'', albeit not before Ren shares another force bond moment with Rey, who eventually shuts him out, much to his dismay.

After leaving Crait, Chewbacca hugs Leia. Finn opens a drawer on the ''Falcon'' to get a blanket for the gravely injured Rose, revealing briefly to the audience that Rey stole all of the books from the original Jedi library and Yoda did not destroy them after all. After being formally introduced to Poe, Rey laments Luke's death as she looks hopelessly at his broken lightsaber and the group's small numbers. Leia, however, notes that Luke is now at peace and that the Rebellion has all it needs to rise again.

Later, on Canto Bight, the stable children regale themselves with a story about Luke's adventures. They are interrupted by Bargwill Tomder who angrily orders the children to get back to work. Outside, Temiri Blagg, still wearing the Resistance Ring that Rose gave him, summons his broom with the Force and hopefully gazes up to the stars.

Regarding more mixed online user scores for the film, Dave Hollis, President of Disney theatrical distribution, commented, "Rian Johnson, the cast, and the Lucasfilm team have delivered an experience that is totally ''Star Wars'' yet at the same time fresh, unexpected and new. That makes this a ''Star Wars'' film like audiences have never seen – it's got people talking, puzzling over its mysteries, and it's a lot to take in, and we see that as all positive, that should help set the film up for great word-of-mouth and repeat viewing as we enter the lucrative holiday period."<ref name="Deadline audiences" /> When asked about the backlash, Johnson himself commented "Lucas never made a 'Star Wars' movie by sitting down and thinking, 'What do the fans want to see?' And I knew if I wrote wondering what the fans would want, as tempting as that is, it wouldn't work, because people would still be shouting at me, 'Fuck you, you ruined "Star Wars,{{" '}} and I would make a bad movie.

In late 2019, JJ Abrams, director of ''The Force Awakens'' and ''The Rise of Skywalker'', told ''Rolling Stone'': "When I read his first draft, it made me laugh, because I saw that was his take and his voice.

I don't think that people go to 'Star Wars' to be told, 'This doesn't matter.'" Abrams added that the sequel trilogy was "a story that I think needed a pendulum swing in one direction in order to swing in the other."<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/movies/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-jj-abrams.html|title=Will 'Star Wars' Stick the Landing?
