'''''In Search of the Castaways''''' is a [[1962]] [[Walt Disney Productions]] feature film starring [[Hayley Mills]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]] in a tale about a worldwide search for a shipwrecked sea captain. It was directed by Robert Stevenson from a screenplay by Lowell S. Hawley based upon [[Jules Verne]]'s 1868 adventure novel ''Captain Grant's Children''. It was Mills' third of six for the Disney Studios.

==Synopsis==
In company with her younger brother, Robert (Keith Hamshere), and her elderly yet young-at-heart friend, Professor [[Jacques Paganel]] ([[Maurice Chevalier]]), teenage Mary Grant ([[Hayley Mills]]) journeys to Glasgow, [[Scotland]], to persuade the comically brave Lord Glenarvan (Wilfrid Hyde-White) to rescue her shipwrecked father, Captain John Grant (Jack Gwillim). The expedition sets sail and ventures halfway around the world, to both [[South America]] and [[New Zealand]], respectively. The party suffers many assorted perils including an earthquake, a flood, a fire, an attack by a giant condor and an erupting volcano before finding and rescuing Captain Grant. A subplot involves a gunrunner named Thomas Ayerton ([[George Sanders]]), who is a treacherous former crew-member of Captain Grant's ship, and responsible for his disappearance. Another subplot involves a budding romance between young Mary Grant and Lord Glenarvan's handsome and loyal son, John (Michael Anderson, Jr.).
