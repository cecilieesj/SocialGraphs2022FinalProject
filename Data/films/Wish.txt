The film will be written by [[Jennifer Lee]] and directed by [[Chris Buck]] and Fawn Veerasunthorn.<ref name="Comicbook">{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/disneys-wish-animated-musical-wishing-star-announced-2023-ariana-debose/|title=Disney's Wish, Animated Musical About Wishing Star, Announced For 2023 With Ariana DeBose|website=Comicbook|accessdate=September 10, 2022}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
''Wish'' follows Princess Asha and her goat Valentino from the Kingdom of Rosas as she meets a literal star and goes through an epic adventure among the stars through the various worlds to help save her people. 

==Cast==
*[[Ariana DeBose]] as [[Asha]]<ref name="Comicbook"/>
*[[Alan Tudyk]] as [[Valentino]]<ref name="Comicbook"/>

==Trivia==
*As this film comes out during Disney's 100th anniversary, the fact that the plot is based on a wishing star similar to the one introduced in ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', and the stars seen in subsequent films such as ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', and ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', which serve as Disney's most iconic symbol, being mainly used in the first shot of the Disney castle logo since 2006, it can easily be considered a celebration for the company's centennial and possibly a "spiritual prequel" to ''Pinocchio''.
*The art style of the film will combine traditional hand drawn animation, Disney's original art style, with CG animation.<ref name="IGN">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/disneys-2023-animated-film-is-called-wish|title=Disney's 2023 Animated Film Is Called Wish|website=IGN|accessdate=September 10, 2022}}</ref>
*This is the third [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film to be released on [[November 22]], after ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Frozen II]]''.
*The film will reportedly have a bunch of Easter eggs referencing past Disney Animated Canon films.
