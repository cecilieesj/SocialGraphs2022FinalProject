==Summary==
When the park guests leave for the winter, Donald and the bears all wave goodbye, except for Humphrey, who's asleep on a hammock. He and all the bears reside in their cave for their winter hibernation, but Humphrey is being annoyingly loud. After getting a glass of water from Donald's house, he's just about to go inside when Humphrey yells, "OW! Humphrey pinched me!" That angers Donald, as he goes home complaining about all the fuss that Humphrey has given him. Later, Humphrey is kicked out of his cave because of his obnoxious snoring, After two unsuccessful attempts to sleep in a log and a train tunnel, Humphrey tries to find another place to hibernate away the winter.
