'''''Reading Magic with Figment and Peter Pan''''' is a [[1989]] educational [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated short from the [[Language Arts Through Imagination|''Language Arts Through Imagination'']] series starring [[Figment]] from [[Journey into Imagination|''Journey into Imagination'']] and characters from ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.

==Summary==
Figment is visited unexpectedly by [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] who has lost his way back to [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]]'s house and is in need of assistance. Apparently, he temporarily got pixie dust in his eyes. When Figment begins to write down directions for Peter, the boy who refused to grow up reminds him that he never learned to read. Figment agrees to bring Wendy to Figonia, but a miscalculation brings Amy instead. Through reading, Figment and his friend Amy vividly make the point that books can transport you to faraway lands, transform you into other characters, and open you up to innumerable adventures. By program's end, Peter agrees that being able to read is wonderful and magical. He may even learn to read himself!

Encourages the use of literature as the basis of creative play; showing how reading can help identify feelings, and that each person brings their own experiences and interpretations to the story.

== Trivia ==
* The theme song does not get used and the credits scroll also features a Peter Pan image next to Figment's.
* Features stock footage from:
** ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''
** ''[[The Jungle Book]]''
