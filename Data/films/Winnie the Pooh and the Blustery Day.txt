'''''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day''''' is an animated featurette based on stories from ''{{WikipediaLink|Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh}}'' and ''{{WikipediaLink|The House at Pooh Corner}}'' by A.A. Milne. The featurette was produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]], and originally released by Disney's [[Buena Vista Distribution]] on [[December 20]], [[1968]] as a companion to the film, ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. This was the second of the studio's [[Winnie the Pooh]] shorts. It was later added as a segment to ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' ([[March 11]], [[1977]]). The music was written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]].

''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'' won the [[1968]] {{WikipediaLink|Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Animated Short Film}}. The Oscar was awarded {{WikipediaLink|List of posthumous Academy Award winners and nominees|posthumously}} to [[Walt Disney]], who died more than two years before the film's initial release. It is also the first and only Winnie the Pooh production that has won an Academy Award. (''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', released 6 years later in [[1974]], was nominated for the same Academy Award, but lost to ''{{WikipediaLink|Closed Mondays}}''.) It is also the first Disney film to feature the MPAA logo (unveiled in 1968) in the credits. The short appears as a bonus feature on the 2006 DVD of ''[[Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin]]''.

==Sources==
The film's plot is primarily based on seven of A.A. Milne stories: "In Which Piglet Does a Very Grand Thing" (Chapter VIII from ''The House at Pooh Corner''), "In Which Eeyore Finds the Wolery and Owl Moves into It" (Chapter IX from ''The House at Pooh Corner''), "In Which Tigger Comes to the Forest and Has Breakfast" (Chapter II from ''The House at Pooh Corner''), "In Which Piglet Meets a Heffalump" (Chapter V from ''Winnie-the-Pooh'': Winnie the Pooh's nightmare of Heffalumps and Woozles), "In Which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water" (Chapter IX of ''Winnie-the-Pooh''), and "In Which Christopher Robin Gives Pooh a Party and We Say Goodbye" (Chapter X of ''Winnie-the-Pooh''). In the original story Pooh shows more initiative during the flood, finding his way to Christopher Robin by riding on one of his floating honey pots, which he names The Floating Bear, then having the inspiration of using Christopher Robin's umbrella to carry them both to Piglet's house.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the story, [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] tells Winnie the Pooh that it is "Winds-day" (a play on "Wednesday"), where upon Pooh decides to wish everyone "Happy Winds-day". He visits his friend, a young pink pig named [[Piglet]], who wears a scarf around his neck on this day. Piglet is blown into the air, his scarf unravelling all the while, and Pooh grabs hold of him. As they fly like a kite through the air, over the other characters' heads, Pooh wishes [[Kanga]], [[Roo]], [[Eeyore]], [[Rabbit]], and [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]] a happy Winds-day. But when they arrive at Owl's house, he informs them that the wind is due to "a gentle spring zephyr" rather than to a particular holiday. During the windstorm, Owl's house is knocked down, and Eeyore decides to find a new house for Owl.

That night, Pooh hears an unfamiliar noise coming from elsewhere in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]]. There is a knock on his door, then [[Tigger]] bounces inside in search of something to eat. After singing [[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers|his signature song]], he tries some honey, but dislikes it. Before leaving Pooh’s house, Tigger tells him that there are [[Heffalumps]] and [[Woozles]] in the forest and that they steal honey, Pooh's favorite food. Later, Pooh suffers from a nightmare in which Heffalumps and Woozles steal his honey while the song "[[Heffalumps and Woozles]]" plays.

Later that night, a storm floods the Hundred Acre Wood. Piglet, who is trapped in his home, writes a bottle-note for help, just before the waters carry him away, him riding a chair. Pooh, who is trapped in a honey pot, floats away from his home as well. The remaining beloved characters gather at [[Christopher Robin]]'s house, and Christopher discovers and reads the message ("Help! P-P-P-Piglet [Me]!"). He then sends Owl to inform Piglet of a rescue plan in the works, but just after he delivers the news, Piglet and Pooh are mixed up in a waterfall which switches Piglet to the honey pot and Pooh to the chair. When they arrive together at Christopher Robin’s house, he mistakenly thinks that Pooh rescued Piglet, and throws a hero party for Pooh.

During the party, Eeyore announces that he has found a new home for Owl. But everybody, unfortunately, learns that the one Eeyore found is Piglet's house. They are shocked and dismayed and try to tell Eeyore that Piglet already lives there. However, Piglet decides to reluctantly give his home to Owl, to which a touched Pooh offers to let Piglet live with him. Pooh suggests to Christopher Robin that the hero party should become a two-hero party because of Piglet’s generosity. He agrees, and the characters celebrate both Pooh’s and Piglet's good deeds that day.

==Trivia==
* According to a 1966 Disney News article previewing the film, the featurette's original working title was ''Winnie the Pooh and the Heffalumps''.
* This is the film with the first appearances of Piglet and Tigger.
* This is the only featurette with a hallucination scene.
* This is the only featurette to feature the entire cast of characters.
* This is the first ''Winnie the Pooh'' film not to begin with [[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Pooh's theme song]].
* Stock footage from ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'' is used.
* When ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' had further releases, this featurette version faded from existence, though it was made available as a bonus feature on the [[2006]] DVD release of ''[[Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin]]''. It also, along with ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', occasionally reran on [[ABC Family]] and [[Disney Junior]].
* The events of this short are disregarded beginning with ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]''.
*The poster art was reused for the poster for ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' except the title of the movie is used and Tigger's sign says "Me, Tooh" instead of "All-Nooh".
* The Disneyland Records album of this featurette included a book with early designs for Piglet (with a much larger snout) and Tigger (basically a "Disneyfied" version of the E.H. Shephard illustrations of him).
* [[Wally Boag]] auditioned for Tigger after Walt thought that he would be perfect for the role. But the role was too zany for a children's film, so Paul Winchell took the job instead.
* There is a deleted scene that has [[Gopher]] warning [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]] that there's a storm coming and tells him to dig a high hole. This is used in the LP album.

== Edits ==
The master of this short used on the 1989 NBC TV broadcast and on the 1990s UK home video releases uses slightly modified opening titles with slightly different text:
* The "Walt Disney Presents" text is omitted, instead beginning with the main title card "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day".
* The logos when saying based on the book by A. A. Milne's doesn't show the MPAA, RCA and the "All Rights Reserved" signs.
* When this particular master replaced the 1983/1986 master on home video starting in 1994, the original titles were used, along with the Buena Vista opening logo being restored for the first time.
* The 1990s UK home video releases used the altered titles, but the rest of the film is the 1983/1986 master.
