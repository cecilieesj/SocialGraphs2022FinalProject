==Trivia==
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|El Libro de la Selva: Ritmo en la Selva]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain and in limited quantities in the United States.
*Known as ''Le Livre de la Jungle: Il En Faut Peu Pour Être Heureux'' in French, released in France.
*"You Are a Human Animal" uses footage from ''[[Make Mine Music]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bulls Toil]]'', ''[[The Aristocats]]'', ''[[Farmyard Symphony]]'', ''[[You and Your Sense of Touch]]'', ''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]'', ''[[Birds in the Spring]]'', and ''[[Figaro and Cleo]]''.
*Professor Owl's introduction to Jiminy Cricket is entirely stock audio from ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Heigh-Ho|Heigh-Ho]]'' (from the introduction to "[[Zorro (song)|Theme from Zorro]]") and ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah|Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]]'' (from the introduction to "[[Give a Little Whistle]]").
*Jiminy Cricket's segments use stock footage from ''[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (TV special)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]'', ''[[You, the Human Animal]]'' (with original audio of Cliff Edwards), ''[[You and the Living Machine]]'', ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', ''[[I'm No Fool Having Fun]]'', ''[[You and Your Eyes]]'', ''[[You and Your Five Senses]]'', and ''[[You and Your Senses of Smell and Taste]]''.
*During "Winnie the Pooh", a clip of the opening scene from ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'' runs, then after a clip of Pooh bouncing on the lyrics to the chorus, Jiminy says "You can do better than that, so I'll give you more words. Let's do it over!" and the rest of the song lyrics appear on the screen during a montage of clips from all the featurettes.
**After the song, Jiminy then says "Great! Part of this song doesn't have real words. So have fun with it! Ooh-bee-doo with Baloo! Just make them up as you go along." which then leads into "I Wan'na Be Like You".
*During "I Wan'na Be Like You", at one point, Jiminy says "Baloo and Louie are singing whatever they want, and you can too!"
*During "Look Out for Mr. Stork" Jiminy says "Hmmm...Poor Mrs. Jumbo! All those babies and no sign of her little pachyderm."
*The 2006 DVD features the original post-credits promo, but Jiminy's narration is missing.
*"The Ugly Bug Ball" uses the original footage from ''[[Summer Magic]]'', then it also contains footage from classic Disney bug cartoons like ''[[Woodland Café]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Garden]]'' throughout the rest of the song, including new original animations for the middle and end lines of the song, it also takes out the instrumental breaks making the song a bit shorter than it normally is.
*"Old Yeller" uses a montage of clips from [[Old Yeller|the movie of the same name]].
*The closing credits use the still background from ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' instead of the normal blue one with G-clefs embossed.
*One of the last Disney videocassette releases to have the print logo sandwiched between blue lines on the tape label.
**However, the 1994 re-release had a surprise appearance on the 1984 Red FBI Warning screens at the beginning.
*The full version of "The Work Song" is included on "Colors of the Wind".
*The 1994 re-release still features the 1987 title card before the intro plays.
*The French and Dutch versions from 1996 featured the 1994 title card albeit without the film's name.
