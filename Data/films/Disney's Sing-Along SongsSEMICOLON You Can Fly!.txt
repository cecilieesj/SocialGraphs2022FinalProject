==Trivia==
*Released in 1988 to mark the 35th Anniversary of ''Peter Pan''.
*When Ludwig introduces the first song, "You Can Fly", a scene from ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]'' for the intro is shown.
*"He's a Tramp" was cut from the [[1994]] reprint and the [[2006]] DVD, but was retained in the Spanish version.
*The original post-credits promo narrated by Ludwig von Drake is also featured on the LaserDisc print, as well as the 1994 print VHS, and  2006 DVD. It is also seen on ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Fun with Music|Fun with Music]]''.
*During "The Merrily Song", a clip of [[The Three Little Pigs (characters)|Fiddler Pig]] jumping into the water is used from ''[[The Practical Pig]]'' and a clip of the traffic light switch is used from ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]''.
*In the uncut version of "The Merrily Song", Ludwig's glasses shatter. The cut version from the 1994 rerelease has Rat and Mole at the end.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Peter Pan: Voloras, Voloras]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain and the United States. When the Spanish version was released around 1993, ''He's a Tramp'' was still on the Spanish version even though it got cut in the English version.
*During the reprise of "You Can Fly", portions of the audio are recycled from the Disneyland attraction, [[Peter Pan's Flight]].
*The 1994 reprint of You Can Fly is very rare and hard to find in stores. 
*The 1994 reprint has the new logo, but the 2006 DVD retains the 1988 logo.
*Known as ''Peter Pan: Tu T'Envoles'' in French, released in France and the United States.
*Ludwig von Drake's segments use stock footage from ''[[Carnival Time]]'', ''[[Fly with Von Drake]]'', ''[[Kids is Kids]]'', and ''[[A Square Peg in a Round Hole]]''.
