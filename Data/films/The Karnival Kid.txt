==Cut Scenes==
*A few scenes were cut or changed before the film's release:
**When Mickey was chasing the hot dog, a gag would have been recycled from Oswald's "[[Africa Before Dark]]", where the hot dog was to run off and disappear into a burrow underground. Mickey squats by one of the burrow’s two holes, then removes his face and places it by the other hole. When the hot dog emerges from hole two near the disembodied Mickey’s face, he gets scared and dashes back through the burrow to hole one, where Mickey’s body catches him.
**After the weenie bit Mickey's finger, Mickey was to follow the hot dog behind a bull’s-eye pitch target game, where Mickey would get struck by a baseball.
***The animation of him getting struck was reused in the closing shot.
**There was originally a close up of Minnie singing "Love’s Old Sweet Song (Just a Song at Twilight)” while powdering her nose, and animation of Mickey sneaking up to the window before looking in admiration.
**The ending would have involved Mickey riding away on the bed like a galloping steed.<ref>https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mickey-mouse-in-the-karnival-kid-1928/</ref>

==Trivia==
*The film's copyright was renewed on [[September 12]], [[1956]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3101213li/page/120/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries (1956 renewals)]</ref>
*Mickey Mouse says his first words ("Hot Dogs") in this short.
*While [[Walt Disney]] normally performs Mickey, up until 1947, it was provided by someone else, who is unfortunately unknown at this rate, who allegedly performs Mickey's first words in this film. Although Walt Disney noticeably voices Minnie Mouse as well as Kat Nipp here.
*The gag in this cartoon where Mickey tips the top of his head as one would a hat when he meets [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] was borrowed from the [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'']] cartoon, ''[[Rival Romeos]]'', where Oswald does the same thing when he meets [[Ortensia]]. It was also cited as the inspiration for Disney artist Roy Williams to create the concept for the Mickey Mouse Ears hats that were worn on the original [[Mickey Mouse Club|''Mickey Mouse Club'']] TV show and are still sold at the Disney theme parks around the world today.
*This film would mark Kat Nipp's last theatrical appearance.
*The scene to which Mickey pulls down the trousers of a misbehaved hot dog and spanks it mirrors the exact event in the ''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'' cartoon, ''[[All Wet]]''.
*In ''[[Toontown Online]]'', there is a building on Punchline Place in Toontown Central named after this short film.
*The short is set to be featured as one of the Game and Watch-inspired ''Classic Kingdom'' minigames in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.
