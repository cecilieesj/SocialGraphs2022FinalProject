'''''Motor Mania''''' is a ''[[Goofy]]'' cartoon released by [[Walt Disney Productions]] on [[June 30]], [[1950]]. In this madcap motoring animation, [[Goofy]] (during his "Everyman" period) transforms into a Mr. Hyde-esque split personality, when he gets behind the wheel and provides the lowdown on how ''not'' to drive safely.

==Synopsis==
The cartoon shows how the character, as the pleasant, friendly, and good-natured "Mr. Walker" who "wouldn't hurt a fly nor step on an ant", undergoes a change in personality to the violent "Mr. Wheeler" when he gets behind the wheel of his yellow car. As Mr. Walker he's polite, safe, and good-natured while as Mr. Wheeler; he is very mean, reckless, and predatory. Upon reaching his destination in town (we are not shown the character's reason for traveling) and leaving his automobile, he reverts to the mild-mannered Mr. Walker, whereupon he is the victim of other motorists' unsafe (and sometimes even predatory) driving habits. However, once he returns to his car, he becomes Mr. Wheeler again, seeking to impose his own will upon traffic, to the point of blaming the tow truck which hauls him away for his slow pace after his own auto accident, and [[Breaking the Fourth Wall|breaks the fourth wall]] by telling the narrator, while educating him on safe driving habits, "Ah, shut up!"

==Trivia==
*This is the first ''Goofy'' cartoon to have a fully-redesigned Goofy, with a lack of both floppy ears and front buck teeth. It was also the first short to use a jazz remake of the theme song used in ''Goofy'' shorts prior.
*According to "[[The Goofy Success Story]]" from ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]]'', the in-universe explanation for the apparent disappearance of Goofy's ears is that, for this film, he had his ears tied above his head and hidden under his hat.
*This cartoon was used as an army commercial film in [[1955]].
*This cartoon reveals that road rage is not a recent phenomenon, but an issue recurring with each generation of drivers.
*Due to its subtle topicality, it and two [[1965]] Goofy cartoons about freeway safety, ''[[Freewayphobia #1]]'' and ''[[Goofy's Freeway Troubles]]'', have been shown in driving schools across the continent.
*This short was awarded the Buyer Trophy for the best film on traffic safety.
*Mr. Walker makes a cameo reading a newspaper in [[Toontown (Who Framed Roger Rabbit)|Toontown]] in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
*A few clips from this short were shown in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Max's New Car]]" (with re-dubbed audio) to prove how Goofy was a "responsible" driver.
* The "motor mania" term was also used in ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' short in ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' to explain [[Mr. Toad]]'s obsession with motor vehicles and may have coined the term for this short.
