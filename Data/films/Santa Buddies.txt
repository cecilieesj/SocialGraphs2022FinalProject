'''''Santa Buddies''''' is a [[2009]] film, and the fourth installment of the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' franchise]]. It was released on [[November 24]], 2009, only 9 months after ''[[Space Buddies]]''.

==Plot==
The film begins at the [[North Pole]] with [[Santa Claus]] (George Wendt) and his dog, [[Santa Paws]] (Tom Bosley), taking a look at the magical Christmas Icicle, which is melting because of nobody believing in Christmas anymore and if it continues to melt, Christmas will be gone forever.

[[Puppy Paws]] (Zachary Gordon) is Santa Paws' fun-loving son. He gets tired of the North Pole and finds [[Budderball]] on Santa's naughty list for eating the Thanksgiving turkey and figures he's just the dog to show him how to be an ordinary puppy.

The film then moves forward to the Buddies (Field Cate, Liliana Mumy, Josh Flitter, Skyler Gisondo, Ty Panitz) in Fernfield, who also don't have any Christmas spirit. They believe that their father is Santa Paws and that the naughty list is a way to scare them to behave. However, Sniffer (Tim Conway) replies that Christmas is about giving and a holiday they must learn to respect.

The Christmas Icicle makes a big crack and shuts off the power at the North Pole and makes the reindeer weak and powerless (earlier before he left the North Pole, Puppy Paws stares at the icicle stating "I wish Christmas would just disappear" causing it to crack).

Puppy Paws makes it to Fernfield to find Budderball in his home and Budderball himself introduces Puppy Paws to his siblings and Puppy Paws causes trouble to each of the Buddies: Budderball gets framed for eating the gingerbread cookies as he tries to get back on the nice list, [[B-Dawg]] gets beaten by Puppy Paws at dancing who even breaks a vase, [[MudBud]] teaches Puppy Paws to roll in the dirt, and unaware not to shake dirt out of his fur in the living room, he makes holiday shapes of the dirt spots causing Mudbud to wear a cover-up coat for the rest of the day, [[RoseBud]] gets an extreme Christmas makeover, and [[Buddha]]'s meditation statue gets turned into a snowman as Puppy Paws explains that the snowman is "what citizens of the North Pole medidate in front of".

Therefore, due to the incidents, the Buddies want Puppy Paws to leave. But they learn that he isn't hurting them as they are hurting themselves and decide to treat him with compassion. Suddenly, Puppy Paws gets dognapped by a dog catcher named [[Stan Cruge]] ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) and takes him to the pound. There, Puppy Paws meets a puppy named Tiny (Kaitlyn Maher) who is wishing for a Christmas miracle and sings a song about miracles, which teaches Puppy Paws himself about the true meaning of Christmas.

The Buddies, along with an elf dog named Eddy ([[Richard Kind]]), have come to the rescue. With Tiny and Eddy still in the pound, the elf dog speaks to Stan that he knows the dog catcher always wanted a puppy for Christmas, but his mother was allergic to dogs and never got one, which made Stan hate Christmas and become a dog catcher. Eddy becomes free from the pound and changes Stan.

With help from an elf named Eli (Danny Woodburn), Christmas spirit returns, the Christmas Icicle stops melting, and the North Pole is back in business, with Puppy Paws and the Buddies making it to the North Pole. The reindeer are not able to fly, and Puppy Paws and the Buddies volunteer to save Christmas ( it is revealed the Buddies remembered what Shasta taught them). A changed Mr. Cruge brings Tiny over to the child who has been asking for a puppy as a Christmas present and Tiny herself says her goodbye to the Buddies and Puppy Paws. After their last delivery, Santa Claus and Santa Paws arrive in Fernfield and Santa makes the Buddies (including Budderball) on top of the nice list, Puppy Paws becomes part of Santa's family, and the Buddies say farewell.

Stan gets invited to dinner with Tiny's new family and the film ends with the entire town, led by Stan, singing "[[Silent Night]]" in front of Fernfield's Christmas Tree as celebrating the holidays.

== Trivia ==

* This movie has to take place between [[The Search for Santa Paws|The Search For Santa Paws]] and [[Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups|Santa Paw 2: The Santa Pups]] since Santa Paws is already an adult dog in this one and in the Santa Pups movie.
* The Buddies, as well as their owners, don't appear in the Santa Paws movies mentioned above, but they were probably doing their own things during those two films when they aired.
*This is the second movie to involve the holiday Christmas as it first happened in Snow Buddies.
*This also the first film where the Buddies actually spend Christmas with their owners as they could not in the other [[Snow Buddies|film]] due to them being accidentally shipped to Alaska.
*This is the final film where Quinn Lord plays Pete, Ryan Grantham plays Sam, Sophia Ludwig plays Alice, Gig Morton plays Billy, and Nico Ghisi plays Bartleby. Five new actors will take their place in the next [[Spooky Buddies|film]].
**This is also the only Buddies movie where Ryan Grantham plays Sam since Nolan Gould did not return.
*This is the final Buddies movie where Liliana Mumy voices Rosebud.
*This is the third Buddies film to have the title begin with the letter S in the name.
