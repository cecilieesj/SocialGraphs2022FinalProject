'''''Ransom''''' is a [[1996]] American crime thriller film written by Richard Price & Alexander Ignon and directed by [[Ron Howard]]. The film stars [[Mel Gibson]], [[Rene Russo]], Brawley Nolte, Gary Sinise, [[Delroy Lindo]], Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler, Donnie Wahlberg, and Lili Taylor. Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

The original story came from a [[1954]] episode of ''The United States Steel Hour'' titled "Fearful Decision". In [[1956]], it was adapted by Richard Maibaum and Cyril Hume into the feature film ''Ransom!'', starring Glenn Ford, Donna Reed, and [[Leslie Nielsen]]. The film was also influenced by Ed McBain's police procedural novel ''King's Ransom''.

The film received mostly positive reviews, and was a major financial success, becoming the 5th highest-grossing film of 1996 in the United States.

==Plot==
While multi-millionaire Tom Mullen ([[Mel Gibson |Gibson]]) and his wife Kate ([[Rene Russo |Russo]]) attend a science fair, their son Sean is kidnapped. Sean (Nolte) is taken to an apartment by Maris Connor (Taylor), a caterer for the Mullens, along with criminal brothers Clark & Cubby Barnes and hacker Miles Roberts. Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding $2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, which begins operating from his New York City penthouse.

Detective  Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) of the NYPD is arresting a perpetrator in a convenience store when Cubby (Wahlberg) buys some FrankenBerry cereal. Shaker follows Cubby into the building where the kidnappers are residing, sees Sean tied in a bedroom, and holds Cubby at gunpoint, berating him for being so obvious; it is then revealed that Shaker is the mastermind behind the kidnapping and Maris is his girlfriend. 

Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is concealing his identity through an electronic voice distortion device, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry. Shaker indicated that Cubby would give Tom an address where Sean could be picked up in exchange for the money, but when Cubby appears ignorant of these instructions and simply demands the cash, Tom refuses to hand it over. The FBI sends a helicopter after Cubby and Cubby opens fire. FBI marksmen kill Cubby before he can reveal Sean's location.

Shaker sets up another ransom drop. Angered that the FBI followed him instead of the money and killed his only lead, Tom insists on taking the money without being tracked. Realizing the first drop was a setup and there is no guarantee that Sean will come back alive, Tom goes on the television news and offers the ransom as a bounty. The only way for the kidnappers to save themselves is to return his son, in which case he will withdraw the bounty and drop all charges.

Despite the pleadings of Kate and FBI Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins ([[Delroy Lindo |Lindo]]), Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance of having Sean returned. Shaker lures Kate to a meeting where he assaults her and tells her to pay the ransom or Sean will die. Upon seeing Kate's bruises, Tom responds by increasing the bounty to $4,000,000. Shaker calls Tom and warns him that he had one hour left to pay the ransom or Sean would be executed. Tom replies that Sean must be returned or else the kidnappers will be hunted down. Fed up with Tom's retaliation, Shaker fires a shot heard over the phone before the call cuts off, leaving Tom and Kate believing their son is dead.

Noticing Clark (Schreiber) and Mills (Handler) attempting to abandon the plan, Shaker forms a new plan: he will kill Clark and Miles, pretend to rescue Sean and claim the bounty for himself and Maris. He calls in a possible kidnapping to the NYPD, requesting backup. He then flashes his badge and gun at Clark and Miles. Clark tries running Shaker over with his van, but Shaker fatally shoots him. He then kills Miles, making it look as though Miles shot first. Maris, also trying to back out of the plan, shoots Shaker in the shoulder. Before she can fire again, Shaker kills her and re-enters the apartment just before a SWAT team charges in, finding a wounded Shaker sitting next to Sean.

Hawkins takes Tom and Kate to the scene of Sean's rescue. Tom thanks Shaker, who is being hospitalized. Hawkins takes Tom to Maris' body, where he recognizes her. 

Shaker appears at the Mullen penthouse to receive the reward, claiming he wants to avoid publicity. As Tom writes a check for him, Sean recognizes Shaker's voice and begins to wet himself in terror. Seeing Sean's horrified reaction and hearing Shaker speak the same phrase the kidnapper did, Tom realizes who Shaker is. Tom gives Shaker the check with a false signature, but Shaker realizes that Tom is on to him. Shaker threatens to kill everyone in the house, but Tom convinces him to take him to the bank so Tom can wire the money to Shaker's account. Shaker agrees, but threatens to re-kidnap and murder Sean at a later date if Tom attempts a double-cross. En route, Shaker orders Tom to ready his private jet to Guadalajara, Mexico, but Tom fakes a call to his pilot, actually calling Hawkins, whom Tom manages to tell covertly that the kidnapper is with him.

Cops converge on Tom and Shaker outside the bank. Shaker opens fire, shooting both officers. Tom lunges at Shaker, grabbing his gun. Tom throws Shaker through a store window and when they emerge, they are surrounded by armed policemen. Shaker draws his back-up revolver from an ankle holster. Tom and Hawkins fire first, killing Shaker. The film closes as Hawkins stops the police from arresting Tom.
