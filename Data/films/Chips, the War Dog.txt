==Goofs==
*In the first dog-feeding scene, a soldier gives a dog named Hercules a bowl of food. Hercules' dog house has a sign that says "Hercules" on it. In a following scene, Smythe gives Hercules a dog treat, and he's in a different dog house, without the name sign. In the rest of the shots, he's in the original dog house with the name sign.

==Quotes==
*Danny Stauffer: Private Stauffer, reporting for doggy duty, sir.
:Kathy Lloyd: Doggy duty?
:[stunned voice and look, over her face, after hearing his remark]
:Kathy Lloyd: Is that how you see this program?

*Danny Stauffer: [while reading a letter from Peggy and Jimbo, addressed to Chips] What's with you and chickens?

*Danny Stauffer: [Sternly to Chips, as he was eyeing a canary, of a lady, carrying a canary, bus was coming in to the bus route, but quietly to others, on bus] Don't even think about it!
:[Chips turns his head, from looking at the canary, back to Danny Stauffer after heaing his command & it is the movie's final verbal remark, then the Closing Credits begin]

*Sgt. Rust: [as Sgt. Rust goes to the barracks] The Bible had it all wrong, there is not just heaven and hell. They forgot to mention me, drill-sergeant Rust. It is time to rise and shine girls. My wish is your command.
:[louder to Danny Stauffer]
:Sgt. Rust: Are you dreaming, sweetheart? This is not your home, I am not your mother. Get up! Do you understand?
:[Sargeant Rust then lifted Stauffer's bed and knocking Stauffer to the floor and waking him up]
