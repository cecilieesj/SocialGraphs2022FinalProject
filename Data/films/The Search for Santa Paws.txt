==Plot==
When [[Santa Claus]] ([[Richard Riehle]]) travels to [[New York City]] and gets hit by a cab, loses his memory and gets the crystal that keeps him eternal stolen, it is up to his new friend, his puppy, [[Puppy Paws]] ([[Zachary Gordon]]), to save him. Meanwhile, a young orphan named [[Quinn]] ([[Kaitlyn Maher]]) arrives at a foster home run by a strict and no-nonsense woman named [[Ms. Stout]] ([[Wendi McLendon-Covey]]) who forbids anything that children love: toys, Christmas decorations, singing, even pets. She has a furnace that burns all the toys she confiscates from the girls. Despite the harsh rules she has to follow while staying at the foster home, Quinn eventually befriends the girls, including [[Janie (The Search for Santa Paws)|Janie]] ([[G. Hannelius]]) and [[Willamina]] ([[Madison Pettis]]). In order to save Christmas, [[Eli the Elf|Eli]] ([[Danny Woodburn]]) and [[Eddy (Santa Buddies)|Eddy]] ([[Richard Kind]]) the uncanny elf dog have to go to New York City to save Santa and Paws. But when Santa (Bud) is in the hospital, it takes the help of Quinn and Willamina to save Santa. When Kate and James take Bud from the hospital, Paws tells Eli to put his crystal next to Santa, he wakes up to find that Paws is a stuffed animal. They rush back to the [[North Pole]] and Paws turns into a full-grown dog named Santa Paws ([[Mitchel Musso]]), and Christmas is back on. Ms. Stout  is also fired from her job of taking care of the orphan girls at the foster home after Eli elf calls Miss Gibson the girls were all alone, much to the excitement of the girls, and Willamina and Quinn are both adopted to James and Kate Hucklebuckle.

== Trivia ==

* [[G. Hannelius]], who will voice [[RoseBud|Rosebud]] in Spooky Buddies, plays Janie in this film as an orphan girl.
*Kaitlyn Maher previously voiced a Yorkshire Terrier named Tiny in Santa Buddies, and will voice a Dromedary camel named Cammy in Treasure Buddies.
*At the end of the film, Quinn and Will get adopted and become stepsisters.
* Despite the scene where they let Augustus in the foster home, it is unknown what happened to the other orphan girls after Will and Quinn left them.
* The only time Quinn can be seen crying is when Will explains to her and the other orphan girls what happened in the basement.
* Will can be crying when she locked in the basement, when she sees Paws as a toy and then Mrs. Stout snatching him, and when she explains to the girls what happened in the basement.
** She is also seen crying in a deleted scene when Mrs. Stout gets rid of the food that magically appeared.
* Janie is only seen crying when her doll got taken away to be cremated. Will actually tries to console her in that scene.
* It's not until she and Paws are in the basement that Will finally hears Paws talking, meaning she finally started to believe in Christmas.
* There's a sequel to this film in which only Kaitlyn Maher appears in, where her character is not an orphan girl, but actually has a family.
