'''''The Devil and Max Devlin''''' is a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] motion picture released by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution|Buena Vista Distribution Company]], directed by Steven Hilliard Stern and released in early [[1981]], starring [[Elliott Gould]], [[Bill Cosby]], and Susan Anspach. Gould praised this film in interviews as the finest he ever did (along with the other Disney film ''[[The Last Flight of Noah's Ark]]''). It was considered to be controversial material for a Disney film at the time because of the subject matter and the fact that Bill Cosby was featured as a character of evil. It was also the first Disney film to actually contain swearing (not just religious connotations) such as "damn" and an unfinished "son of a bâ€”". This film was one of three films that influenced the creation of [[Touchstone Pictures]] to make movies for mature audiences. The film was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment on DVD in November [[2000]].

==Plot==
Max Devlin (Elliott Gould) is a shady landlord of a rundown tenement who is rather jaded and callous toward his fellow man. One day while chasing an errant tenant, he is run over by a bus and killed. He descends into hell (which resembles a corporate business) and meets the Devil's chief henchman Barney Satin (read: Satan) ([[Bill Cosby]]). He is told of his life of sin and the fact that he is doomed. However, he is given a chance to save himself by convincing three other people to sign their souls away. He returns to earth and begins his frantic quest. At first he thinks his return to Earth was just an intense nightmare, but realizes he cannot see his reflection and Satin appears randomly to check on his progress (as well as taunt him if he is drifting). Devlin finds three young ones whom he can convince to sign their souls: Toby Hart, a widow's son who wants to see his mother happy and thinks Max would make a good stepfather, Nerve Nordlinger, a nerdy outcast who wishes to prove himself through dirt bike racing, and Stella Summers, a high school dropout who wishes to sing. Aided by a small bit of Satin's magic, Devlin manages to aid all three.

Along the way, he discovers his innate decency, the fact that he really was not so bad all along. He falls in love with Mrs. Hart and they plan to marry. Eventually, through various methods, he obtains all three signatures on the fatal contract (which, after signing, prompts them to sense Max's hellish alliance and changes their personality for the worse). However, on his wedding day, Satin appears and tells him he will take these chosen ones right now rather than let them live natural lives. Max will be allowed to live his natural life, but is doomed to Hell upon dying. Satin says that because Max's wife is a born-again Christian, she can never enter Hell. However Max is horrified by the thought of his stepson's death, saying his wife would be ruined by losing both her first husband and son. Max's shock turns to anger and he prepares to destroy the contracts. In the film's most intense scene, Satin appears in full devil regalia and screams at Max of his terrible fate of torment in Hell if he burns the contracts. Max does so anyway, to sacrifice himself for the three souls, and suddenly realizes he is living again. His kind, unselfish act has deemed him unfit for Hell. When Max sees himself in a mirror, he realizes he has indeed been redeemed and the three kids he attempted to bamboozle have returned to their decent personalities. Max looks up to Heaven as a sign of thanks. In the final scene, Max and his new wife, along with Toby and Nerve, attend a concert where Stella performs.
