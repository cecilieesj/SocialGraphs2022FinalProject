}}'''''Neck 'n' Neck''''' is an animated short starring [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] released on [[January 23]], [[1928]].

The short was long thought to have been lost, until [[2018]], when it was discovered that anime historian Yasushi Watanabe had purchased an abridged two-minute version of the short, dubbed ''Mickey Manga Spide'' (loosely translated as "Mickey Cartoon Speedy"), 70 years prior—not knowing its significance. Upon reading ''[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons]]'', Watanabe contacted the ''Asashi Shimbun'' newspaper, which contacted the Walt Disney Archives to confirm the short's existence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201811140057.html|title=Lost Disney film featuring ‘origin’ of Mickey Mouse found in Japan|website=The Asahi Shimbun}}</ref>

The copy is currently being kept at the Kobe Planet Film Archive in Japan. In addition to Watanabe's copy, another 50-second clip from the film was also uncovered in the Kyoto Toy Film Museum archives.
