| Plot                    = After being saved by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Nova Corps]], now aware of [[Earth]] sent the [[Xandarian Chamber Orchestra]] to its cultural epicenter, [[Epcot]], in order to teach a [[Earth-1218#Residents|crowd of terrans]] about their culture through music.

Aware of this, [[Star-Lord]] and [[Gamora]] go to Epcot, in order to save the galaxy from "bad music". With help from [[Groot]], aboard the [[Benatar]], Star-Lord sends tunes from his [[Awesome Mix]] to the Orchestra's headsets. Star-Lord helps the orchestra play 4 different songs, while Gamora reiterates to him that "bad music" is not a serious emergency that warrants their presence. Star-Lord concedes, and begins to leave after the fourth song, but the Orchestra choose to play [[wikipedia:The Jackson 5|The Jackson 5]]'s [[wikipedia:I Want You Back|"I Want You Back"]] without his help. The Guardians stay to watch, but Groot alerts them that a fleet of [[Sovereign Drone Ships]] is attacking the Benatar. The two leave, but Star-Lord tells the Orchestra to choose a new name if they want to become a truly great cover band, and the Orchestra takes the name "The Star-Lords" in his honor, before finishing their song.
