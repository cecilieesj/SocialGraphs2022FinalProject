==Plot==
Similar to ''[[Jack-Jack Attack]]'', the short details events taking place off-screen during the film's story, in this case, showing us the night [[Edna Mode|Edna]] spent watching and studying [[Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] using his powers while [[Mr. Incredible|Bob]] caught up on some much needed rest. Taking Jack-Jack to Edna, she studies different superpowers he has. When Edna becomes crowded by multiple Jack-Jack clones, Jack-Jack uses his monster form, combining it with his fire form. Later, Edna examines Jack-Jack for his powers he used and giving him a red suit (the same one she gave to the Parr family) after studying as she returns him to his father Bob. Edna then explains to Bob that whenever she babysits Jack-Jack (unlike other babies), she does not charge him as Bob and Jack-Jack leave for home. Later, Edna notices Jack-Jack (presumably a clone of himself) next to her, as Edna runs off telling Bob that he forgot his baby.
