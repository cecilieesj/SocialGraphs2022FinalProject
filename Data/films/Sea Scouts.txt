**Donald protecting his hat from a seagull overhead.
**The nephews' attempt to hoist the anchor before Donald has to do it.
*Donald's attempt to hoist the anchor is shortened.
*Donald, not realizing he's underwater, thinking he saw a flying fish and a flying turtle.
*The nephews hoisting the sail too high and then lowering the boom on Donald's head, followed by Donald having to hoist the sail himself.
*Donald's first fall into the shark's mouth, along with the sail's rope.
* Donald sighing with relief as he clings for dear life to the rope's pulley.
*The nephews their boat out to save Donald.
