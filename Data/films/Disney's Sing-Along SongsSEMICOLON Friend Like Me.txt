==Trivia==
*Jiminy Cricket's segments use stock footage from ''You and Your Ears'', ''[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (Walt Disney Presents episode)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]'', ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]'', ''[[I'm No Fool in Water]]'', and ''[[You and Your Sense of Touch]]''.
*This is the only volume to have a different intro to the theme song play over the opening graphics. In its place, we hear the last couple of bars of ''Friend Like Me'', with the title ''Friend Like Me'' appearing in Disney's ''Aladdin''-style font, framed by blue and purple smoke, continuing into the remixed opening theme. The font is also used in ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: The Twelve Days of Christmas]]'' during "He Delivers" when Huey shouts, "I believe!" The remixed opening was heard on ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life|Circle of Life]]'', ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Honor to Us All|Honor to Us All]]'', ''Collection of All-Time Favorites'', ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs from Hercules|From Hercules]]'', and the UK versions of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Colors of the Wind|Colors of the Wind]]'' and ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Topsy Turvy|Topsy Turvy]]'' in Spanish, while the remixed closing theme was also heard on the 1993 and 1994 editions of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Heigh-Ho|Heigh-Ho]]'', as well as ''Circle of Life'', ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs from Hercules|From Hercules]]'' and ''Collection of All-Time Favorites''.
*This is the last volume to use a song from a live-action production.
*During the song "Friend Like Me", in the main portion of the video, when the Genie sings "Can your friends pull this out their little hat?", the shot of his bunny form was replaced with a repeat take of his dragon form breathing fire and forming the three girls. This shot was corrected in the LaserDisc release, as well as the reprise in both editions.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Aladdin: Un Amigo Fiel]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain and the United States. Also known as ''Un Amigo Genial ''and'' Un Genio Genial''.
*Known as ''Disney's Sing Mit Uns: [[A Whole New World|Ein Traum Wird Wahr]]'' in Germany.
*Instead of Professor Owl introducing Jiminy Cricket, Jiminy Cricket just shows up at the very beginning of the program, making this the first ''Sing-Along Songs'' video in which Professor Owl does not appear.
*The 1994 print is considered the rarest and hardest to find VHS tape since very few were sold in stores.
*A 1994 ''Sing Along Songs'' promo depicts a purple slipcover for this video, possibly a prototype. The purple slipcover was used for the Spanish-language release.
*The 1994 reprint does not have a new title card.
*The German release has the German words of A Whole New World (opening) and Friend Like Me (closing).
