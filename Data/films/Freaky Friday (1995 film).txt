'''''Freaky Friday''''' is a [[1995]] television film made for [[ABC]], starring Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann. It is based on the novel of the same name by Mary Rodgers, in which a mother and daughter switch bodies and get a taste of each other's lives.

==Plot==
Ellen Andrews ([[Shelley Long]]) and her daughter, Annabelle (Gaby Hoffmann), find it difficult to get along with each other, each professing that the other has no idea what her life is like. A pair of magical amulets causes them to switch bodies for a day, after which they have reached a better understanding of each other.

Among many changes from the original, this version of the story has diving instead of waterskiing as Annabelle's main hobby, which again plays a big role in the film's climax. Also, in the original (and the book), Ellen and Bill are marital partners and Bill is Annabelle's dad, whereas in this adaptation, Ellen is a single mom and Bill is her new boyfriend
