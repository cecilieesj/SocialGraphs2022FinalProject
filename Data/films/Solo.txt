It focuses on the early life of [[Han Solo]]. It is directed by [[Ron Howard]] and was released on [[May 25]], [[2018]].

==Synopsis==
Board the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and journey to a galaxy far, far away in ''Solo'', an all-new adventure with the most beloved scoundrel in the galaxy. Through a series of daring escapades deep within a dark and dangerous criminal underworld, [[Han Solo]] meets his mighty future copilot [[Chewbacca]] and encounters the notorious gambler [[Lando Calrissian]], in a journey that will set the course of one of the Star Wars saga’s most unlikely heroes.

==Plot==
On the planet [[Corellia]], orphaned children are made to steal to survive. Young adults [[Han Solo|Han]] and [[Qi'ra]] make an escape from a local gang. They bribe an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] officer with stolen coaxium (a powerful hyperspace fuel) for passage on an outgoing transport, but Qi'ra is apprehended before she can board. Han vows to return for her and joins the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet. When the recruiting officer asks for his surname, Han explains that he is alone with no family, so the recruiter gives him the last name "Solo".

Three years later, Han has been expelled from the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination and is serving as an infantryman on Mimban. He encounters a group of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by Tobias Beckett. Han attempts to blackmail them into taking him with them, but Beckett has him arrested for desertion and thrown into a pit to be fed to a Wookiee named [[Chewbacca]]. Able to understand Chewbacca's language, Han persuades him to cooperate to escape. Beckett, aware of the usefulness of a Wookiee's strength, rescues and enlists them in the gang to steal a shipment of coaxium on {{nowrap|Vandor-1}}. The plan goes awry when the Cloud Riders, a group of so-called terrorists led by [[Enfys Nest]], arrive, resulting in the deaths of two crew members, including Beckett's wife, and the destruction of the coaxium.

Beckett reveals that he was ordered to steal the shipment for Dryden Vos, a high-ranking crime boss in the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Han and Chewbacca volunteer to help him steal another shipment to repay the debt. They travel to Vos' yacht where Han finds Qi'ra, who has joined Crimson Dawn, and is Vos' top lieutenant. Han suggests a risky plan to steal unrefined coaxium from the mines on Kessel; Vos approves but insists Qi'ra accompany the team. She leads them to [[Lando Calrissian]], an accomplished smuggler and pilot who she hopes will lend them his ship, a freighter called the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Han challenges Lando to a game of sabacc, with the wager being Lando's ship. Lando cheats to win but agrees to join the mission in exchange for a share of the profits.

After reaching Kessel in the ''Falcon'' and infiltrating the mine, Lando's droid co-pilot L3-37 instigates a slave revolt. In the confusion, they steal the coaxium, but L3 is fatally damaged, and Lando is wounded during the escape. Meanwhile, Chewbacca manages to find a group of other Wookies that had gone into hiding after the Empire had conquered [[Kashyyyk|their original homeworld]], but when the others decide to take another ship to escape, Chewbacca chooses to stay with Han. With the help of L3's navigational computer, hot-wired into the ship's systems, Han pilots the ship through the dangerous and uncharted [[Millennium Falcon#Kessel Run|Kessel Run]] (encountering a gargantuan summa-verminoth in the process) in approximately twelve parsecs to elude an Imperial blockade. The ''Falcon'', badly damaged, lands on the planet Savareen to process the coaxium.

During a confrontation with Enfys, who tracked the team from Vandor, Lando flees in the ''Falcon'', deserting everyone else. Enfys explains to Han that she and her crew are not pirates, but rebels made up of victims from the tyrannical state of the galaxy trying to strike back at the syndicates and the Empire. Han becomes sympathetic to their cause and tries to trick Vos, but the crime lord reveals Beckett has already alerted him to the double-cross. Vos sends his guards to kill Enfys, but the Cloud Riders overpower them instead, leaving Vos defenseless. Having anticipated Vos's strategy, Han tries to take the coaxium, only for Beckett to betray Vos, escaping with it and taking Chewbacca hostage. Qi'ra kills Vos and sends Han after Beckett. She contacts Vos' superior, the former [[Sith|Sith lord]] [[Maul]], to inform him of the mission's failure, and claim Vos' position. She blames the failure on Beckett, never mentioning Han. Maul orders Qi'ra to meet with him on [[Dathomir]].

Han catches up to Beckett and confronts him, shooting Beckett before he can return fire. With his dying words, Beckett tells Han that he made a smart choice because he would have shot Han. Qi'ra leaves in Vos's yacht, while Han and Chewbacca turn the coaxium over to Enfys, who offers Han a chance to join the rebellion against the Empire; when he declines, she gives him a vial of coaxium, enough to purchase a ship of his own. Han and Chewbacca locate Lando and challenge him to a rematch in sabacc, once again wagering the ''Falcon''. Han wins, having stolen the card Lando was keeping up his sleeve in order to cheat, and he and Chewbacca leave for [[Tatooine]], where Han heard a crime lord is putting together a profitable job and the film ends with the ''Falcon'' jumping into hyperspace.
