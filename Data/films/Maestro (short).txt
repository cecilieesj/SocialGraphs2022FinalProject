The interns worked closely with their mentors to help bring their short to life.

==Plot==
An investigator is sent a file to examine a strange house that is supposedly haunted. During a rain storm, he navigates the dark rooms when a drawer suddenly begins opening and shaking to a beat. A chair swoops in and lifts the investigator up into the air. Brooms beginÂ sweeping on their own, plates cups and utensils start making musical sounds and the chandelier shakes on its own. Soon, everything is coming to life while making harmonized music and dazzling lights. The investigator hops out of the chair and picks up an ottoman to protect himself. The source of the musical objects reveals himself as a small ghostly boy, the titular Maestro, who appears and ends the music in a sudden finale. The investigator lowers the ottoman and applauds as the Maestro happily takes a bow. During the credits, the investigator is shown befriending the Maestro by learning music while also teaching him to have fun.

==Trivia==
* The brooms coming to life and the dishes and cups making music are most likely a reference to ''[[Fantasia]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', respectively.
