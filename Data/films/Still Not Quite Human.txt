'''''Still Not Quite Human''''' is a [[1992]] television movie written and directed by Eric Luke and starring Jay Underwood and Alan Thicke. It is the third and final film in a series based on the ''[[Not Quite Human]]'' novels by Seth McEvoy. The story, which has a darker tone than the previous films, features the human-looking android, Chip Carson, embarking on a mission to rescue his father, who has been kidnapped by a ruthless tycoon in order to acquire his knowledge of android technology. Robyn Lively doesn't return to reprise her role as Becky, but she is mentioned as having taken a job in another state.

==Plot==
After giving a failed presentation at a robotics convention, Dr. Jonas Carson (Alan Thicke) is kidnapped and replaced by a look-alike android. His android son, Chip (Jay Underwood), notices the swap and manages to reprogram the impostor into an ally. Since he is like an additional Jonas, Chip names him Bonus (Alan Thicke in a dual role). Chip enlists the aid of a small time pickpocket, Kyle Roberts (Adam Philipson), whom he has just befriended, to help him rescue his father. Bonus is able to lead them to the mansion where Dr. Carson is being held, but tight security prevents them from sneaking in successfully. Chip meets up with a schoolmate, Kate Morgan (Rosa Nevin), who now works as a police officer. Officer Morgan has been after Kyle's pickpocketing and illicit watch sales for some time, but agrees to not press charges if he helps Chip rescue Jonas. She devises a plan to assume the personas of wealthy investors in order to gain willful entry to Dr. Frederick Berrigon's (Christopher Neame) estate, seeking guidance from her rich Aunt Mildred (Betsy Palmer) to prepare them.

Their ploy gets them inside, but they are soon found snooping, so Kyle and Bonus keep the guards occupied while Chip finds his father. Just before he breaks into the room where his father is being held, Chip learns that Dr. Berrigon was trying to extract Dr. Carson's knowledge to aid in building a war machine android. A moment later, Chip is confronted by a working prototype and is forced to fight it, with Dr. Berrigon watching from a distance. Chip has to avoid its laserfire, initially, but he manages to smash the laser with a projectile. The battle becomes a contest of speed and raw strength, with Chip being knocked to the ground and nearly struck in the chest with the end of a metal rod. Chip scrambles up, sets a compressed hydrogen canister on a cart and smashes the valve off, causing it to speed toward the other android and smash it against a group of canisters, which explode. Dr. Berrigon, having witnessed Chip's victory, realizes that he must be Jonas' android, but Chip flings him into a mud pond. When several policemen follow Kate to make the arrest, a disheveled and frantic Dr. Berrigon yells for them to arrest Chip on account of him being a strong android; unconvinced, they haul him away. A reformed Kyle hugs Chip goodbye; feeling a power panel on Chip's back, Kyle shrugs it off as imagination. Aunt Mildred congratulates her niece on arresting Dr. Berrigon then becomes attracted to Bonus, starting a relationship with him.
