'''''The Simpsons in Plusaversary''''' is a [[2021]] crossover short film between the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters and ''[[Wikipedia:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]''. It was released on [[November 12]], [[2021]] on [[Disney+]], part of the "Disney Plusaversary" event.

==Official description==
:''The Simpsons host a [[Disney+]] Day party and everyone is on the list... except Homer. With friends from across the service and music fit for a Disney princess, Plusaversary is Springfield's event of the year.''

==Synopsis==
Several Disney characters are lined up to enter [[w:c:simpsons:Moe's Tavern|Moe's Tavern]], where [[Maui]] and [[Ralph|Wreck it Ralph]] are the bouncers, and [[Maleficent]] is checking the guest list to enter, and Homer claims he's not in the list, however when [[Goofy]] appears, he has second thoughts and forces him to be his +1.

In the Tavern, [[Darth Vader]] is drinking a beer, [[Doctor Strange]] is playing pool, [[Elsa]] is creating some ice in a bucket that [[Magic Brooms|a Fantasia's broom]] is filling with beer, while [[Buzz Lightyear]] and [[Din Djarin|The Mandalorian]] are having an arm wrestling match, which Buzz loses, and Moe mistakenly thinks that [[Donald Duck]] is choking, so Barney tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver on him.

At the table, Homer and Goofy are discussing about their feelings, while [[Happy]] is complaining how the party stinks before complaining to [[Grumpy]], and they get divided by Lisa who comes to the Tavern to collect Homer, that gets his beer struck by [[BB-8]], but cheers the place up with a song about [[Disney+]]. 

After the song, [[Mickey Mouse]]'s shadow appear over the door to the Tavern, overjoying everyone as the boss was arriving, but Bart appears instead, dressed as him, telling them to get back to work, and dragging Goofy away, while Barney drags Homer the other way.

==Trivia==
*Characters on the guest list include: [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Dopey]], [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]], [[Palpatine]], [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]], Aaron Burr, [[Jabba the Hutt]], [[Tramp]], [[King George III]], Bluey, [[Luca Paguro|Luca]], Sideshow Bob, [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]], [[Thanos]], [[Lightning McQueen]] (with the note he needs parking pass), [[Tiana]] and [[Prince Naveen]].
**Excluding characters based on real celebrities, out of all of the fictional characters listed, Bluey is the only one of them to not be owned by The Walt Disney Company and is also therefore a non-Disney character. Her presence on the list references her series being available on Disney+. Aaron Burr's and King George III's presence on the list reference the musical ''[[Hamilton]]'' being available on the service. Jeff Goldblum's presence on the list references his series ''[[The World According to Jeff Goldblum]]'' being available on Disney+.
**Despite the characters' mentioning in the guest list, only [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]], [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]], [[Tramp]], [[Loki Laufeyson|Loki]] and [[Tiana]] made a cameo in the short itself.
*Companies shown on Maleficent's pad: Disney, [[Pixar]], [[ABC]], FX, [[Marvel]], [[Lucasfilm]], [[Hulu]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[20th Century Studios]], and [[ESPN]].
*"[[Mickey Mouse March]]" plays when Bart, dressed as Mickey Mouse, enters Moe's Tavern.
*Some other Disney characters make cameos during the credits.
**Cruella is shown measuring Santa's Little Helper, as she often did to canine characters on ''[[House of Mouse]]''.
**As the [[Glass Slipper]] shines on Cinderella's foot, Jiminy Cricket and Ant-Man appear under it as Cinderella is about to step on them.
**The Beast plays pool, using Pinocchio's nose as a cue stick.
*The silhouette of Mickey Mouse is seen in the Gracie Films closing logo.
* This, along with [[The Simpsons: The Good, the Bart, and the Loki|The Good, the Bart, and the Loki]], are the first Simpsons shorts in a long time total of 13 years to receive a Japanese dub after years of the Japanese dub being long neglected after the Japanese dub on ''The Simpsons Movie'' (2007) and the show's fourteenth season.
**Japanese dubbings of the show's fifteenth season were added on Disney+ in mid-2022, but it is currently unknown when they were originally recorded.
* The Disney characters are not voiced by their regular voice actors in this short since the actors for ''The Simpsons'' did the Disney characters instead.
* The only characters that has been scrapped from this short are:
** [[Nick Wilde]] from ''[[Zootopia]]''.
** [[Nathaniel]] and [[Pip]] from ''[[Enchanted]]''.
** [[Rex]], [[Mr. Potato Head]] and [[Slinky Dog]] from ''[[Toy Story]]''.
** [[Captain Marvel]] from ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.
** [[Yoda]] and [[Leia Organa|Princess Leia]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''.
** Scrat from ''[[Blue Sky Studios|Ice Age Films]]''.
*Marge Simpson was absent from this short.
*[[The Muppets]] were noticeably absent from this short.
==Reception==
This short had received very little positive reviews from critics and audiences. The short has been claimed to work better as a commercial outside of the streaming service and was a wasted opportunity for Disney’s approach with the Simpsons.
