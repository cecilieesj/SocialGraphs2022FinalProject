'''''Jojo Rabbit''''' is a 2019 US biographical comedy-drama war film directed and written by [[Taika Waititi]].

==Plot==
A World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler ([[Taika Waititi]]), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.

* Alfie Allen as Finkel
* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Captain Klenzendorf

==Release==
''Jojo Rabbit'' was released on October 18, 2019, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. Before its release in the United States, it was premiered at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019.

It was also released on the same day with another WDS film ''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]].''

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, it gets 79% Tomatometer and 96% Audience Score. The site's critical consensus reads, "Jojo Rabbit's blend of irreverent humor and serious ideas definitely won't be to everyone's taste -- but either way, this anti-hate satire is audacious to a fault."

On IMDB, the film gets an average rating of 8/10.0, and on CinemaScore, it gets a grade of A.

On Box Office Mojo, the film earned $33,370,906 in North America and $56,964,119 in other territories.

In North America, the film was released in a total of 995 theaters and earned $142,110 on its opening date and $349,555 on its opening weekend.

In other territories, the biggest market was the United Kingdom, which earned $3,160,059 in its opening week and $10,329,585 in total.

In total, the film earned $90,335,025.

==Trivia==
* Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell both starred in ''Iron Man 2''.
* Stephen Merchant also played a role in a Marvel film: he was Caliban in ''Logan'', though that film is not connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
* Scarlett Johansson's character is executed for circulating revolutionary leaflets. This is the same crime for which Korg (Taiki Waititi) was imprisoned in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.
* Ironically enough, Taika Waititi, who plays Adolf Hitler in the film, is of Māori and Jewish descent, not unlike Steven Berkoff, a British actor of Jewish descent who portrayed Hitler in ''War and Remembrance''.
