Daisy, Daisy you're the one

I get so addlepated

And when I'm riding along the street

Everybody that I meet

Says "there goes the guy

that's crazy over sweet Daisy Mae".

==Trivia==
*As seen in the ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney|Disneyland]]'' episode "[[Where Do the Stories Come From?]]", the cartoon was inspired in a whole song written by [[Oliver Wallace]], which shares the title of the cartoon "Crazy Over Daisy".
*Along the cartoon, Donald keeps whistling the song and the cartoon ends with the music again. Donald also briefly whistles the song in ''[[Out on a Limb]]'' and ''[[Dude Duck]]''. He also briefly quacks the song in ''[[Chips Ahoy]]''.
*Donald's design in this cartoon, which notably has him resembling a younger version of [[Scrooge McDuck]], was notably reused for the younger Scrooge's appearance in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. Additionally, several early [[Toon Disney]] promos that used clips from this short had Donald mistakenly identified as Scrooge.
*The song "Crazy Over Daisy" had new lyrics written for the record ''Walt Disney Takes You to Disneyland'', and was retitled "Meet Me Down on Main Street". This new version of the song was performed by the Mellomen and was later reused as track 4 of the first disc for ''A Musical History of Disneyland''.
**An instrumental of this song is played in the film ''[[Disneyland, U.S.A.]]'', to represent [[Main Street, U.S.A. (Disneyland)|Main Street, U.S.A.]]
**In addition, an instrumental of this song can be heard in the [[Disney's Magic Artist]] CD-ROM whenever the user clicks on Daisy's interactive model sheet.
*This is the only cartoon to have Daisy Duck and Chip 'n Dale pairing together, until 1983 in Mickey's Christmas Carol.
*This is somewhat of a followup to ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]''.
*During his bicycle ride, Donald rides through reused animation of the band in the gazebo and the children playing from the "[[Casey at the Bat]]" segment of ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.
*The cartoon originally had special opening and closing titles, but are lost and the only version in circulation is the 1960's Buena Vista reissue print of the 1950's TV print.
