Following criticism from actor [[Peter Dinklage]] over the "stereotypical portrayal of dwarfs", Disney announced that the film will replace the titular characters with "magical creatures" and that casting for them will begin shortly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/snow-white-peter-dinklage-disney-response/|title=Disney Assures Peter Dinklage on ‘Snow White’ Reboot: ‘We Are Taking a Different Approach’ on Dwarf Characters|website=The Wrap|last=Taylor|first=Drew|date=January 25, 2022|access-date=January 25, 2022}}</ref> Apparently, according to to the following backlash, Dinklage ignored the difference between real life humans suffering from dwarfism and the dwarfs as mythical and fantastical creatures from European fantasy, folklore and mythology. Dinklage even wrongly stated that the dwarfs of ''Snow White'' live in a "cavern" instead of a cottage in the forest. This move has been criticized by people and fans (like professional dwarf wrestler Dylan Postl, better known by his ring persona "Hornswoggle") accusing Dinklage of hypocritically virtue signalling and ignoring the source material, and criticizing his words and the resulting response from Disney for being harmful to the dwarfism community, including the potential actors for roles of the dwarfs in a film based on an established property who denounced him as "hypocritical" and "selfish" and blamed him for making them lose job possibilities.<ref>https://movieweb.com/dwarf-actors-peter-dinklage-refute-comments/</ref><ref>https://thealteran.com/disney-ditches-potential-dwarfism-community-actors-after-peter-dinklages-woke-rant-over-snow-white-remake/</ref><ref>https://danaloesch.substack.com/p/i-think-folks-are-jumping-the-gun</ref><ref>https://www.npr.org/2022/01/26/1075761231/peter-dinklage-disney</ref><ref>https://boundingintocomics.com/2022/01/31/peter-dinklages-snow-white-complaint-blasted-by-dwarf-performers-hes-trying-to-take-roles-away/</ref><ref>https://boundingintocomics.com/2022/01/25/disney-instantly-caves-to-woke-criticism-of-live-action-snow-white-film-from-peter-dinklage/</ref><ref>https://www.newsweek.com/peter-dinklage-called-selfish-dwarf-actors-over-snow-white-criticism-1674923#aoh=16456773827861&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=Da%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fpeter-dinklage-called-selfish-dwarf-actors-over-snow-white-criticism-1674923</ref><ref>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10449549/Dwarf-actors-slam-Peter-Dinklage-canceling-seven-dwarves.html</ref> Comedian Brad Williams also expressed a similar sentiment, in that while he partly agreed with Dinklage, he stated that there are ways to work around the issue by depicting the Dwarfs as a potential love interest for Snow White and de-emphasizing the prince's role in the story, also complimenting the positive aspects of the characters: "I mean, they have jobs, you know? They got good friends. They got a house. They like to protect her. They're diamond miners, so they're rich. They're self-made, wealthy."<ref name="brad">{{Cite web |date=2022-01-27 |title=Brad Williams Pitches His Fix for Controversial Snow White Remake |url=https://movieweb.com/brad-williams-snow-white-controversy/ |access-date=2022-02-02 |website=MovieWeb |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="cbbrad">{{Cite web |title=Brad Williams Weighs in on Peter Dinklage's Snow White Dwarf Concerns |url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/snow-white-peter-dinklage-brad-williams-weighs-in-concerns/ |access-date=2022-02-02 |website=Movies |language=en}}</ref>

Despite the criticism made by Dinklage, actor [[Martin Klebba]] shared that he would be playing [[Grumpy]], thus implying that the seven dwarfs are still going to be in the film.

On February 22, 2022, it was announced by TheDisinsider that Sandy Powell, costume designer for the live-action [[Cinderella (2015 film)|''Cinderella'']],  has joined the crew for the film.
