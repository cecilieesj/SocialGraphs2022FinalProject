The '''Newman Laugh-O-Grams''' were minute-long short films made in [[Pre-1922|1921]] by [[Walt Disney]] in a garage he rented from his father. They include:
*A scene of Walt Disney sitting at his desk, drawing a picture of a criminal being kicked out of Kansas city.
*Disney's hand drawing a picture of a pair of women's legs in stockings in the middle of the paper with the top halves of two women on either side of her.
*His hand drawing a picture of someone driving a car that's in mid-bounce on a bumpy road.
*An animation of policemen walking into a police station, then being fired and literally thrown out before someone hangs a "cops wanted" sign on the station.

Like everything made during that time, they were all silent.
