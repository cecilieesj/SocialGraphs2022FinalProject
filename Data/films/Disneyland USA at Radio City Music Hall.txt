'''''Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall''''' is a six-minute short filmed in CinemaScope at Radio City Music Hall in [[1962]], created as a pre-show for the documentary ''[[Disneyland, U.S.A.]]'' In this short, [[Walt Disney]] on film interacted with [[Mickey Mouse]], a costumed performer on the stage of the nation's largest indoor theatre. The gist of the movie is that a [[New York]] telephone operator is looking to talk to [[Hollywood]], but gets connected to everywhere else. She finally gets through to Walt, who is not expecting company. Ever the showman, he puts on his coat and talks about taking [[Disneyland]] from a dream to a reality, occasionally addressing his star rodent from afar.
