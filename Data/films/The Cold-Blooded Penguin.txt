'''''The Cold-Blooded Penguin''''' is an animated short originally featured as a segment of ''[[The Three Caballeros]]''. The short features the voice of the late [[Sterling Holloway]] as the professor who narrates the adventures of Pablo. It was released in the 1940s.

==Synopsis==
A penguin, tired of the chilliness of his winter climate, decides to head for warmer shores.

==Plot==
Set in the South Pole is a land of ice and [[Penguins (The Three Caballeros)|penguins]] doing activities they do there such as fishing, skiing, swimming, etc.. While the professor takes the audience to meet an unusual penguin named [[Pablo]], this penguin always stays warm when he lives with his stove Smokey Joe in his igloo as his companion. Unlike the other penguins spending their lives and doing their activities in the South Pole, Pablo wishes to move to a tropical place where no other penguin has ever been to. As Pablo sets off to go to move to warmer areas, the other penguins bid a farewell but Pablo suddenly freezes as he did not bring his stove with him in order to move to the tropical shores. During his second attempt, Pablo brings his stove Smokey Joe with him but this plan did not work either. After his third attempt was not successful, two other penguins bring him to his stove Smokey Joe to unfreeze him in his igloo and Pablo gets an idea that would change his life: a boat leading him to the Galápagos.

Feeling inspired by the picture of the boat leading to the Galápagos, Pablo cuts half of the ice to make a boat as he sets sail for the tropical shores of the Galápagos Islands. On his way to the tropical islands, Pablo encounters a thick blanket of fog and manages to get past the foggy coast. Pablo suddenly ends up in the Straits of Magellan and passes through [[Chile|Chile's]] rocky coast. Meanwhile, Pablo sees another area in the Juan Fernandez Islands where he would stay warm, but it turns out that this island is already occupied by Robinson Crusoe.

That night, Pablo looks at his map and he ends up arriving at Viña del Mar, the area where the penguin is at. Pablo then sails past Lima, [[Peru]], sees the mountain of Quito, Ecuador, and sees the equator. Pablo cannot cross the equator, so [[King Neptune (character)|King Neptune]] helps him cross as Pablo sails to the Galápagos Islands. On his arrival to the Galápagos, Pablo noticed that his boat started melting, as well as his igloo home, so he uses his bathtub as a boat to reach the Galápagos Islands. Satisfied that he finally made it to the Galápagos, Pablo enjoys his new life in the Galápagos Island in paradise, but he starts to think that he might return back to the South Pole someday.
