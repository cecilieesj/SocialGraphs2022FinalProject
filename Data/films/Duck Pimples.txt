==Synopsis==
Donald's over-active imagination is inspired by scary stories on the radio and in books. He has an unpleasant stormy evening when a mysterious book [[Salesman|salesman]] comes to his door then disappears leaving him with a collection of whodunnit novels. He reads one and gets so fully involved in it that it appears that the characters are actually coming out of it and into his living room getting him involved in the missing pearls. Finally its author, [[J. Harold King]], steps forth and claims him innocent. The characters return to the novel from whence they came leaving him wondering if it was really just his "imagination". In the end, he had the shining pearls which they had appeared.

==Trivia==
*This cartoon's title is taken from the phrase "Goose Pimples", another word for "Goose Bumps", which often rise as a sign of fear. This is shown in the cartoon's title card where the word "Goose" has been crossed out and replaced with "Duck".
*The cop's real name is H.U. Hennessy, named after Disney artist Hugh Hennesy. J. Harold King is likely named after director [[Jack King]], and Leslie J. Clark is based on one of animator and one the legendary "nine old men", [[Les Clark]].

*Pauline bears a very similar resemblance to [[Jessica Rabbit]].
**She also bears a resemblance to [https://www.mariowiki.com/Pauline Super Mario's Pauline], due to the similar look and color scheme with the [https://www.mariowiki.com/images/b/b2/TDS_Pauline.png Donkey Kong Arcade sprite.]

*This cartoon was written by future famous gag cartoonist Virgil Partch, who left the Disney studios due to the 1941 animators' strike. This was his only screen credit.
*The cartoon is Disney's version of the Tex Avery-directed MGM cartoon, ''Who Killed Who?'' (1943), complete with suspenseful organ music and the detective in both cartoons being voiced by [[Billy Bletcher]].
