'''''The Plowboy''''' is a [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] cartoon released on [[June 28]], [[1929]].

==Synopsis==
As the title implies Mickey was depicted as a farmer alongside Minnie Mouse. He is first seen with his horse while plowng a field. Then Minnie comes along with her cow. She has Mickey milk the cow for her. As he does, the cow starts licking him in an apparent sign of affection. Mickey does not seem pleased and replies by rolling up its muzzle with its own tongue.

Mickey eventually manages to present Minnie with a full bucket of milk and proceeds to forcefully kiss her. Minnie's reply to this sign of affection is knocking his head with the bucket. At some point, the horse is stung by a bee, panics and starts galloping. By the time the horse calms down again, the plow has been broken. In the finale, Mickey resorts to using a pig as a plow.
