'''''Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too''''' is the third [[Winnie the Pooh]] short from [[Walt Disney Productions]], released in theaters on [[December 20]], [[1974]] as a double feature with ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]''. It was nominated for an {{WikipediaLink|Academy Award}} for Best Animated Short Film, also given to ''{{WikipediaLink|Closed Mondays}}''. It was later added as a segment to ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' ([[March 11]], [[1977]]). A soundtrack album was released simultaneously and featured such songs as "The Honey Tree" and "Birthday, Birthday." The film, whose name is a play on the slogan "[[Wikipedia:Tippecanoe and Tyler Too|Tippecanoe and Tyler too]]" made famous during the [[Pre-1922#1840|1840]] United States presidential election, is based on stories from ''[[wikipedia:Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' and ''{{WikipediaLink|The House at Pooh Corner}}''.

In [[1975]], ''Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too'' won the Grammy Award for "Best Album for Children" (this fact is mentioned during the pop-up facts during the film as a bonus feature for the [[2002]] DVD release of ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'').

== Sources ==
The films plot is primarily based on three stories found in the Milne books: "In which Pooh and Piglet go hunting and nearly catch a Woozle" (Chapter III of ''Winnie-the-Pooh''), "In which Tigger is unbounced" (Chapter VII from ''The House at Pooh Corner''), and "In which it is shown that Tiggers don't climb trees" (Chapter IV from ''The House at Pooh Corner'').

==Plot==
[[Tigger]] has been bouncing on anyone he comes across for fun, which gets on [[Rabbit]]'s nerves after he ruins his garden. After holding a meeting with Pooh and Piglet, Rabbit decides to take everyone, including Tigger, out into the Hundred Acre Wood. But during the trip, Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet purposefully ditch Tigger on the hopes he would get lost. The three hide in a log as Tigger searches for them. While searching, Tigger gets his tail caught on the log the three others are hiding in, but the others secretly get his tail free without him knowing they are hiding. The three then try to make it back home, but due to it being so misty they end up getting lost and wind up at a certain spot in every direction they take.

Pooh offers a silly suggestion to search for that same spot, and Rabbit abandons them to try to prove Pooh wrong. Pooh and Piglet find their way out of the mist by themselves. This was possible because, according to Pooh, 12 honeypots were calling to his stomach and he "couldn't hear them before because Rabbit would talk", and lets it find the way out. This is where they come across Tigger, who had escaped the mist with ease earlier, realizing that Rabbit's plan to lose him had failed. Pooh tells Tigger that Rabbit is still about in the mist so Tigger goes off to find him, for by this time, Rabbit has become lost trying finding his way home (unaware at the time that Tigger had already gotten out of the mist and was already on his way back to retrieve him), and ends up in a dark, damp, and misty part of the forest, to add to that he's scared by various animal noises. Frogs start croaking loudly, caterpillars munch loudly on leaves and after seeing frogs sitting there in front of him (plus more appearing and making more noise) it scares [[Wikipedia:The living daylights (idiom)|the living daylights]] out of him. The sounds get to him so badly that it drives him mad causing his eyes to make whirlpools and he frantically tries to run away only to be tackled by Tigger, who declares that Tiggers like him don't get lost easily, and then takes Rabbit home.

It's now snowing and [[Roo]] wants to go play. Kanga can't be with him, so she calls on Tigger to look after Roo which he gladly accepts. Along the way through the woods, Tigger and Roo see Rabbit skating on the ice. Tigger tries to teach Roo how to ice skate by doing it himself, but unfortunately, he loses his balance and collides with Rabbit and the result is Tigger sliding across the ice into a snowbank and Rabbit crashing into his house. Tigger then decides that he doesn't like ice skating. Later on, while bouncing around the woods with Roo on his back, Tigger accidentally jumps too high up a tree, only to discover he is afraid of heights and is too scared to come down. He calls for help and Pooh and Piglet (who are hunting for Jagulars) come to the scene. Roo successfully jumps down but Tigger refuses to follow suit.

Soon, Christopher Robin, Rabbit, and Kanga arrive and try to convince Tigger to jump. Eventually, Rabbit decides that the group would just have to leave Tigger in the tree forever, on which Tigger promises never to bounce again if he ever was released from his predicament. Sebastian Cabot (the narrator) chimes in for help. Tigger begs Cabot to "narrate [him] down from [the tree]," and Cabot tilts the book, allowing Tigger to step onto the text of the page. Tigger starts to feel better that he made it this far and before he can do otherwise, Cabot tilts the book again causing Tigger to fall down into the snow. Happy, Tigger attempts to bounce but Rabbit stops him reminding Tigger of the promise he made. Devastated, Tigger sadly walks away and Rabbit feels better that there will be peace, or so for only he feels. But everyone else is sad to see Tigger like this and remind Rabbit of the joy Tigger brought when he was bouncing and prefer the old bouncy Tigger. Seeing that he is outnumbered and they are getting him to admit his errors,, Rabbit feels sorry for Tigger, regrets his mistake, and takes back the promise he made and is given a sudden friendly tackle by an overly-excited Tigger, who then invites everyone to bounce with him and even teaches Rabbit how to do it. For the first time, Rabbit is happy to be bouncing, as is everyone else and Tigger sings his trademark song for the last time.

==Edits==
Both the 1986 VHS release and the 1990 [[Walt Disney Mini Classics|Mini Classics]] edition use a late 1970s TV print with two edits:
*Part of the [[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh theme]] is cut (leaving out the lyrics "You'll find the enchanted neighborhood... of Christopher's childhood days").
*There's a fake black fade out at the scene when Tigger was bouncing his way to save Rabbit, and the narrator's line when he was mentioning Rabbit getting lost in the woods was slightly shifted.
*Only on the 1986 VHS release (as well as the 1987 laserdisc), the opening credits are sped-up and condensed, along with two additional fade-to-blacks and a voice-over announcing the title. At least one of the fade-to-blacks were presumably done to edit out the Sears sponsor announcement (Sears sponsored all three featurettes when they were broadcast on NBC during the late 1970s.)
*Contrariwise, the 1986 Spanish-dubbed VHS release is fully uncut.

The 1986 master used for ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney|The Disney Sunday Movie]]'' uses remade opening credits with completely different text. There is also no "The End: A Walt Disney Production" card; instead, the camera freezes before the Pooh doll's eyelid opens completely after winking, resulting in an awkward edit where the doll's eye is left half open. (A similar awkward edit occurs on the 1997 European and Belgian French video releases of ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' where a remade version of "The End: A Walt Disney Production" is used, followed by dub credits of the French cast.)

==Trivia==
*When ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' had further releases, the original featurette version faded from existence, though it along with ''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'' occasionally reran on [[ABC Family]] and [[Disney Junior]].
*This is the first ''Winnie the Pooh ''featurette to not include any new songs, apart from [[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Pooh's theme]] and "[[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers]]".
*The [[Milt Kahl]] animation of Tigger singing and dancing his song "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" to Rabbit was previously used in ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''.
*This featurette marks the last time [[Junius Matthews]] and [[Sterling Holloway]] voice Rabbit & Pooh respectively, before their respective deaths in [[1978]] and [[1992]]. This excludes ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' since the film is mostly comprised of the original featurette trilogy, and thereby uses archive audio.
*This is also the first (the second, if you count the non-Disney appearance in ''Shirley Temple's Storybook'') time that Roo is voiced by a female. This would happen again in ''[[Welcome to Pooh Corner]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood]]'', and ''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]''.
*Originally, in the script, Tigger was just supposed to say "Goodbye", and this is reflected in the text of the onscreen book. But Paul Winchell ended up ad libbing, "TTFN, ta-ta for now", at the insistence of his wife.
