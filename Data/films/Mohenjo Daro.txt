===Development===
Ashutosh Gowariker announced the film officially in February 2014 with A. R. Rahman composing the film score. In August 2014, Hrithik Roshan was confirmed to play the male lead and was paid ₹50 crore (US$7.4 million).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hrithik Roshan demands Rs 50 crore for Ashutosh Gowariker's 'Mohenjo Daro'?|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-hrithik-roshan-demands-rs-50-crore-for-ashutosh-gowariker-s-mohenjo-daro-2018775|publisher=''DNA India''|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=29 September 2014}}</ref> Actress Pooja Hegde was signed as the female lead.<ref name="di">{{cite web|title = Hrithik Roshan to star in ‘Mohenjo Daro’ for Disney India|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/hrithik-roshan-to-star-in-mohenjo-daro-for-disney-india-1201281758/|publisher=''[[Wikipedia:Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=Naman Ramachandran|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> On taking up the project, in an interview, Gowariker stated that there was meagre and superficial information available about the people in that civilisation, particularly about their lifestyle, food and feelings. The lack of information about the period troubled Gowariker and he decided that whenever he would get a story to tell, it will be depicted in the 2500 BC-Mohenjo Daro.<ref name="bollyspice">{{cite web|title = Ashutosh Gowariker and Hrithik Roshan team up for Mohenjo Daro | url=http://bollyspice.com/83496/ashutosh-gowariker-hrithik-roshan-team-mohenjo-daro|work=Bollyspice |author=Núria Bonals Hidalgo|date=9 June 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> On the film's plot, he was quoted as saying, "While the plot will follow the discovery of Mohenjo-daro and the culture and the vibe of the ancient civilisation, it will largely centre on a love story."<ref name="bollyspice"/> It took Gowariker three years to piece together a plot of the entire civilisation through various cities and weave a love story into it.<ref name="bollyspice"/> During his reconnaissance, he met as many as seven archaeologists who had been closely involved in documenting the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilisation.<ref name="bollyspice"/> He had also visited the archaeological site of Dholavira.<ref name="bollyspice"/> Further, with the film being set in a certain period, the whole site had to be recreated in a film studio.

==Legal issues==

===Screenplay===
Director Akashaditya Lama alleged the makers with film script copyright infringement.<ref name=":0" /> According to Lama, in 2003, he shared the script with his friend, editor Ballu Saluja, an associate of Ashutosh Gowariker.<ref name=":0" /> Lama stated: "I sent him a handwritten script through Saluja which he returned after four days saying that he had just directed a period movie ''Lagaan'' (2001) and didn't wish to make another one immediately."<ref name=":0" /> Lama had registered his script titled "Saamrajya" under the Copyrights Act with Ministry of Human Resources Development in 2007.<ref name=":0" /> He went on to re-register the same script online in February 2010 with the title "Mohenjodaro" with the Ministry of Human Resources Development and the Department of Higher Education, India, under the Copyright Act.<ref name=":0" /> Two days later, he also registered the same script with the same title with the Film Writers' Association in Mumbai.<ref name=":0" /> However, in March 2015, lawyers on Gowariker's side responded: "Our client states that they had received a script from Mr. Ballu Saluja in 2003. However, our client returned the script to Mr. Ballu Saluja immediately without reading the same and they were not intending to make a historical film."<ref name=":0" />

===Finance===
In mid-September 2014, owing to non-payment of their regular expenses and remuneration, the workers belonging to Allied Mazdoor Union and Film Studio Setting refused to complete the pre-production work in Bhuj, Gujarat. To this stalled situation, Gowariker took a legal route and lodged a complaint with the 'Indian Film and Television Producers Council' accusing the members of stalling work that would result in losses to the company. Lawrence D'Souza, executive producer of the film, maintained that though their payments were ready, the remote filming locations of Bhuj delayed the reception of the same.<ref name="shoot1">{{cite web|title=Ashutosh Gowariker files complaint against union members for disrupting shoot|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2651027/Ashutosh-Gowariker-files-complaint-against-union-members-for-disrupting-shoot|publisher=''[[Wikipedia:Bollywood Hungama|Bollywood Hungama]]''|accessdate=27 September 2014|date=23 September 2014}}</ref>

===Cinematography===
Ayananka Bose had originally been signed as the cinematographer but when the film was delayed, he took up other projects as he was paid on a project-to-project basis. Bose failed to join the discussions prior to filming and requested Gowariker to be allowed to join the set directly after he was done with his other commitments. A displeased Gowariker replaced Bose with C.K. Muraleedharan.<ref>{{cite web|title='Mohenhjo Daro' DOP fired for taking up other projects during film's delay|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150129/entertainment-bollywood/article/mohenhjo-daro-dop-fired-taking-other-projects-during-films|publisher=''[[Wikipedia:Deccan Chronicle|Deccan Chronicle]]''|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=2 February 2015}}</ref>
