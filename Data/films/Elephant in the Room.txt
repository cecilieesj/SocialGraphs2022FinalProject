==Synopsis==
A lost baby elephant is taken in by a boy and his father to work on their banana plantation. As the two quickly bond, the boy discovers that his new best friend yearns for her family and home in the wild.

== Plot ==
In India, a baby elephant gets left behind by his herd, but is soon found by a boy and his father who nurse him back to health. The father uses the elephant to help collect bananas in their plantation while the boy plays with the elephant in his room as they share a loving bond. Unfortunately, the father forces the elephant to stay outside especially when it is raining. The elephant longs for his herd which the boy solemnly picks up on.

The next day, the father is taking the elephant out for work when the boy comes running with a bushel of bananas and a herd of elephants chasing him. He stops dead in front of their home just so the older elephants can recognize the lost baby. Father and son let the baby elephant return to his family as they look on.

During the credits, the boy and his father continue to happily collect bananas which they sell at the market. Later, they spot the elephants from afar and the boy and baby are reunited.

==Trivia==
*The short's title is an [[Wikipedia:Elephant in the room|idiom]] that refers to a difficult problem that no one wants to talk about.
