'''''Mickey: The Story of a Mouse''''' is a documentary film directed by Jeff Malmberg. It was released on [[November 18]], [[2022]] to celebrate [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]'s 94th birthday.

==Synopsis==
The documentary follows the history and [[Mickey Mouse/Filmography|filmography]] of Disney’s famous mascot [[Mickey Mouse]]. Some notable topics discussed include Mickey's origins, his influence on the world, his supposed role as a corporate mascot, and some controversies involving the mouse (including wearing blackface in ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'' and becoming a "yuppie" icon in the 1960s). Throughout, we also follow the production of a brand new Mickey short entitled, ''Mickey in a Minute'', which is shown in full at the end.

===Mickey in a Minute===
Mickey is walking through the halls of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building in Burbank, as he sees some posters from his shorts. When he gets to the poster for ''[[The Little Whirlwind]]'', the titular character sucks him through the poster. As Mickey is blown through the cyclone, he goes through his various looks from ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', his Roundup Day outfit on ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'', his sorcerer costume from ''[[Fantasia]]'', his role as the ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'', his bandleader uniform from ''[[The Band Concert]]'', shaking hands with celebrities in ''[[Mickey's Gala Premier]]'', and finally, ending up on the steamboat from ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.
