'''''Lake Titicaca '''''is a ''Donald Duck'' animated short of the segment of ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''. It was reissued as a stand-alone short on [[February 18]], [[1955]].

==Synopsis==
A short travelogue as Donald absorbs the sights, sounds and rugged terrain of Lake Titicaca from the basket boats to the llamas being controlled by a homemade flute.

==Plot==
Donald goes on a unique experience in Lake Titicaca where the lake there is even more colder than other lakes. He first experiences using a balsa boat which is different from other sailboats in the States as the narrator warns him strong winds may occur just like the Lake Titicaca in real life.

The segment features local colors from Lake Titicaca based on the illustrations of the artists such as shoppers and merchants. People in this area are unique such as those walking against the wind and those walking with the wind. The unique culture also features a woman with a rumble seat and then a llama. When Donald encounters a child and his llama and becomes overjoyed with them, the child allows Donald to try on the native costume that he wears. The narrator then explains that if a visitor goes traveling with a llama, it can help explorers discover the landscapes such as the dangerous suspension bridge.

The narrator then warns that a traveler must be cautious whenever he misbehaves or loses his temper (to which Donald replies, "SHUT UP! Ya big windbag!") on high altitude which can cause overexertion on the high altitude. Donald almost falls off along with the llama (it successfully reaches the other side of the mountain), but he falls into a pottery market after dropping and Donald bids a farewell to Lake Titicaca rowing on a pottery vase.
