==Plot summary==
Calvin Fuller is a nerdy young adolescent living in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseda,_Los_Angeles,_California Reseda], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California California]. The gangly, unsure youth is first seen at a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball baseball] game, standing at bat for his team, the Knights, ready for yet another strike out. Suddenly an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake earthquake] hits; as the others run for safety, the ground opens up under Calvin's boots and he falls through the chasm. Eventually he lands on the head of a 6th-century black [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight knight]. Upon hearing of his miraculous appearance, the elderly [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur King Arthur], seeing him as the savior whose appearance [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin Merlin] has predicted, dubs the boy Calvin of Reseda and invites him to dine with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court court].

Calvin begins his knight training to help Arthur retain his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_crown crown]. When the earthquake hit, Calvin had just grabbed his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack knapsack], a fact that enables him to wow the Arthurians with his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futuristic futuristic] "magic", including an introduction to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll rock and roll] via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_player CD player], and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife Swiss Army knife]. The young wizard also shows them how to make [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_skating inline rollerskates]. His work wins him adulation and renown; but it also rouses the jealousy of the Lord Belasco, who will use any means to take over the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne throne]. Meanwhile, Calvin finds himself falling in love with young Princess Katey. After he helps Arthur keep the crown, he is returned to the 20th century just before the moment when he struck out, and he steps up to the plate: this time, he is ready and hits a home run. He is greeted by his teammates - including a girl who looks like Katey - and is looked on by spectator who looks like Arthur, who is whittling a piece of wood with a pocketknife - the same knife Calvin gave King Arthur.

==Production==
Most of the 6th-century portion of the film was shot in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest Budapest], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary Hungary], while the majority of the 20th-century portion was filmed in late September 1994, at the softball field of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Central_Elementary_High_School London Central High School] (LCHS), an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States American] institution at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Daws_Hill RAF Daws Hill], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Wycombe High Wycombe], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England England].<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-0">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Kid_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court#cite_note-0 [1]]</sup> Dozens of LCHS pupils sought to participate in the project; those with permission from their teachers were allowed to venture to the shooting location, where they were auditioned and costumed. The "Ventilate 'em, Calvin" line spoken by one of the protagonist's teammates was originally offered to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student upperclassman] Shane Bursae, but was instead given to freshman Jerome Brumby after he was heard advising Bursae on his delivery. Bursae became the double for the pitcher, performing in all of the pitching shots in that portion of the film. Years after the green dug outs were taken down and were replace with a more modern look. The green dug outs were put in a local wood and broken up by LCHS'ers Mike Poore and Mike Fobes in 2000.
