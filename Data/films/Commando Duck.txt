'''''Commando Duck''''' is a World War II animated short starring [[Donald Duck]].

==Synopsis==
Donald is briefed on his mission to take out a Japanese airfield in the Pacific. He's to paratroop in at 06:00 on Position D4, then proceed down the inland river towards the Japanese airfield in a ravine 800 yards below the falls at the end of the river at Position F8, where he is to surround and wipe them out. Successfully landing and avoiding the native fauna, Donald begins his journey down the river and soon comes under fire from Japanese snipers. Narrowly escaping, he doesn't notice how close to the waterfall he is till it's nearly too late to avoid a drop. Thinking fast, Donald uses a rope to secure a point on the river side and begins to pull his way towards safety, but his plan is ended when a Japanese sniper shoots the rope, sending Donald over the edge. Donald's raft snags on a branch and begins to fill up with water and expand. Avoiding drowning, he begins to outrun the ever expanding raft now filled with a great sum of water till it bursts sending a flood of water rushing down the ravine. Seeking to outrun it, Donald finds himself facing a sheer drop down to the Japanese airfield. Rather then risk the leap he turns and faces his certain doom proudly, but a rock hurled by the water hits the log he is on sending him hurling out of harms way as the Japanese airfield is flooded and destroyed. Donald then begins writing his mission report in which he declares the enemy to have been 'Washed Out'.
