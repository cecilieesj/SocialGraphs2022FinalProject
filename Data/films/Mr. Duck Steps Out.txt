'''''Mr. Duck Steps Out''''' is a [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] cartoon made by Walt Disney Productions. The film was released on [[June 7]], [[1940]] and featured the debut of [[Daisy Duck]].

==Synopsis==
Donald visits the house of his new love interest for their first known date. At first Daisy acts shy and has her back turned to her visitor. But Donald soon notices her tailfeathers taking the form of a hand and signaling for him to come closer. But their time alone is soon interrupted by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] who have followed their uncle and clearly compete with him for the attention of Daisy. Uncle and nephews take turns dancing the jitterbug with her while trying to get rid of each other. In their final effort the three younger Ducks feed their uncle maize in the process of becoming popcorn. The process is completed within Donald himself who continues to move wildly around the house while maintaining the appearance of dancing. The short ends with an impressed Daisy showering her new lover with red kisses.

==Characters==
*[[Donald Duck]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
*[[Daisy Duck]] (voiced by Clarence Nash)
*[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] (voiced by Clarence Nash)

==Trivia==
*This short had two working titles: "Donald's Date" and "Donald in the Groove".
*As seen in storyboard sketches for this short (which can be seen on ''The Chronological Donald'' DVD), Donald was originally going to wear his traditional sailor suit, but in the final cartoon, his clothes were changed to more of a city slicker style.
*This short was one of the many featured in ''[[Donald Duck's 50th Birthday]]''.
*One of the dancers brought in as reference for Donald and Daisy's jitterbug was [[Virginia Davis]], the very same Davis who as a young girl appeared in the [[Alice Comedies|''Alice Comedies'']] of the 1920s.
*This marks the only time [[Clarence Nash]] provided Daisy's voice, and the only time Daisy has a "duck voice".
*In the [[Have a Laugh!|''Have a Laugh!'']] short version of this cartoon seen on [[Disney Channel]] interstitials, when Daisy's voice has been redubbed she has been erroneously given a normal voice.
*The 1968 reissue was one of the last new programs from Disney to use the 1960 variant of the Buena Vista opening logo that had been in use until 1966.
*This is one of the only times Clarence Nash voices all the characters

==History==
The short stands out among other Donald shorts of the period for its use of modern music and surreal situations throughout. After this short, the idea of a permanent love interest for Donald was well established. However, Daisy did not appear as regularly as Donald himself.
