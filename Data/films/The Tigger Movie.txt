'''''The Tigger Movie''''' is a [[2000]] animated family musical comedy-drama film directed by Jun Falkenstein. Part of the ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' series, this film features Pooh's friend [[Tigger]] in his search for his family tree and other Tiggers like himself. As such, the story line may be viewed as an allegory about an adoptee's search to understand the meaning of family.

The film was the first feature-length theatrical Pooh film to not be a collection of previously-released shorts, which is the case with [[1977]]'s ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. Thanks to its success, three more feature-length [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Pooh]] movies were released to theaters: ''[[Piglet's Big Movie]]'' in [[2003]], ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' in [[2005]] (both by [[Disneytoon Studios]]), and [[Winnie the Pooh (film)|the 2011 American film the same name as the bear]], from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]].

The film features original songs from the [[Sherman Brothers]], the long-time Disney songwriting team who are well known for their contributions to other Disney films such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', and ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', as well as the original ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' shorts. The film was originally slated for direct-to-video release until Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] heard the [[Sherman Brothers]]' score and decided to release the film in theaters worldwide.

The movie was narrated by the late [[John Hurt]].

== Plot ==
While trying to find somebody to play with, Tigger gleefully bounces around the Hundred Acre Wood, disrupting his friends' attempts to prepare for the winter and accidentally causing a huge rock to fall on Eeyore's house. Rabbit leads the others in trying to remove it with an elaborate pulley system known as his Rock Remover (which collapses) and Tigger intervenes. He activated his most powerful bounce called the [[Whoopty-Dooper-Loopty-Looper-Alley-Ooper bounce]] to knock the rock (which gets tangled with the crumbling Rock Remover along with Tigger's friends) and getting everyone covered in mud (except for Roo and Eeyore instead fell in-between a tree branch and a thorn bush respectively) and Rabbit to get annoyed that rock remover was ruined by Tigger's bouncing. Feeling alone, Tigger sulks on a bridge and Roo, trying to cheer him up, asks if there are other Tiggers. Fascinated by the idea, Tigger talks to Owl, who explains about family trees. Tigger, taking this literally, heads out to find a huge stripey tree and, after not finding one, instead writes a letter to his family. No reply comes and Tigger feels more alone then ever.

That night, the first night of winter, everybody (excluding Tigger) gathers at Piglet's house. Feeling sorry for him, Roo announces that they should write a letter to him. Everyone adds a bit of friendly advice (Kanga, "Dress warmly"; Pooh, "Eat well"; Piglet, "Stay safe and sound"; Eeyore, "Keep smiling"; and Roo, "We're always there for you") before signing 'your family' at the bottom of the page. Roo then slips the letter into Tigger's letter box. The next day, everybody is woken by Tigger, who brandishes the letter. He shouts joyfully that his family has written to him and also that they are coming to visit the next evening. They are all surprised, as they had never written down anything that even resembles that; nevertheless, Tigger replies that he always reads between the lines. They all try to tell Tigger the truth, but seeing his excitement makes them realize that it will only break his heart. Later, Roo gathers Pooh, Piglet, Owl and Eeyore over to his home. He and his mother [[Kanga]] say they are going to charade as fellow Tiggers to attend the party and make Tigger feel loved. They are halfway through making the costumes when Rabbit bursts through the door, telling them that they should be gathering supplies (or should already have) for the impending snowstorm.

Meanwhile, Tigger is preparing for his party when somebody rings the doorbell. He opens the door to reveal a large number of Tiggers who claim to be his family. A party ensues with drinks, dance, and games, and all the while, Tigger believes they are his family. Yet when the smallest (Roo) attempts the Whoopty-Dooper Loopty-Looper Ally-Ooper Bounce, and his mask falls off, the others reveal themselves as Tigger's friends. He discovers that they lied to him. In order to find his family, and deeply hurt by the lie, he leaves the room, stating that he is leaving forever ('''"T-T-F-E, Ta-Ta, For-Ever!"'''). He hikes through the snow until he finds a large tree on the cliffside, which matches the description he gave of his family tree. He bounces across the branches, finding nothing, so he sits there, waiting for his family.

Meanwhile, a crying and humiliated Roo comes over to Pooh's house, heartbroken and tearfully claiming that it was his fault Tigger left, for he wanted the tiger as a big brother. Then, Pooh, Roo, Piglet, and Eeyore mount an expedition to find Tigger. They ask Rabbit to lead them; he initially refuses but reluctantly agrees after seeing how much they miss the mischievous feline. When they find him, they tell him to return home, with Rabbit saying he should "Forget about all this other Tiggers nonsense". Tigger is greatly offended by them, but when a sudden avalanche caused by his irate shouting occurs, he pulls them all out of trouble. Unfortunately, Tigger himself is still caught in the avalanche.

Roo remembers the Whoopty-Dooper Loopty Looper Ally-Ooper bounce and travels down through the rock and snow to Tigger and wakes him from unconsciousness. To get out of the avalanche, they perform the signature bounce together. When the snow settles, [[Christopher Robin]] arrives on the scene and everyone tells him why Tigger left. Christopher tells Tigger he didn't have to leave to find his family. Tigger objects and reaches for his letter that, until recently, he believed to be from his family, but finds it missing. It is not until Owl, Kanga, Roo, Eeyore, Pooh and Piglet recite the letter for him that he realizes that they sent the letter, not his family. Hearing this, Tigger finally comes to realize what was true all along, that his family is right here and always has been: his friends. Once they return home, Tigger gives everyone gifts: Eeyore gets a new house (the guest house meant for Tigger's "Family"), Pooh gets lots of Honey, Piglet gets a stack of firewood, and Rabbit is promised that he will watch where he's going. Lastly, he gives Roo his heart pendant, but it's still empty. Christopher Robin remedies this by taking a picture of Tigger's "family" to close the movie.

==Production==
The film was simultaneously animated at the Walt Disney Studios and its Japanese chapter Walt Disney Animation Japan. The animation is traditional (2D), with characters moving across backgrounds painted in soft, warm watercolor hues in the style of book illustrations in children's literature. Each chapter starts off as a static illustration on a printed page, where characters then start moving. The bold ink lines in the foreground and the watercolor washes of the background are reminiscent of the original Pooh illustrator Ernest Shepard. Graphics during end credits are pen and ink line drawings also reminiscent of Shepard.

==Home video==
{{Main|The Tigger Movie (video)}}
The film was released on August 22, 2000 on both VHS and [[DVD]]. The VHS and DVD included the Kenny Loggins music video "[[Your Heart Will Lead You Home]]". The DVD also includes the additional bonus features the original theatrical trailer for the film that was appeared from ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving]]'' VHS.

The film was later re-released on 2-disc DVD on August 4, 2009 as a 10th anniversary edition. The 2-disc release includes a DVD and a digital copy. It contains all the 2000 DVD bonus features, but has more language tracks and special features.

The film was also re-released as a ''Bounce-a-rrrific'' special edition on Blu-ray on August 21, 2012. It contains the Kenny Loggins music video "Your Heart Will Lead You Home" and "[[Round My Family Tree]]" sing-along song, but includes 10 ''Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' segments.

==Soundtrack==
The songs for ''The Tigger Movie'' were written by Robert and Richard Sherman who had not written a feature for Disney in over 28 years. Their last fully original feature film score was for the Oscar nominated film, ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' which was released in 1971. Originally slated for video or television release, the score was so well received (in demonstration form) by then Disney CEO, [[Michael Eisner]], that the project's priority level moved up to feature theatrical release. This was due in great part to the perceived caliber of the song score throughout the studio. All the songs were created new for the film except for "The Wonderful Things About Tiggers" which was originally written in 1968 for the landmark ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' featurette, ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' (released in 1968). That song was also by the Sherman Brothers. The "punch line" of the song: "But the most wonderful Thing About Tiggers is I'm the only one..." provides the basis of ''The Tigger Movie's'' storyline. "Your Heart Will Lead You Home" was the last song written for the film and is a collaborative effort between the [[Sherman Brothers]] and singer [[Kenny Loggins]]. It marks the only time the threesome worked together on a song. Song titles include:

*"''[[The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers]]''"
*"''[[Someone Like Me (The Tigger Movie)|Someone Like Me]]''"
*"''[[Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce]]''"
*"''[[Lull-a-Bee]]''"
*"''[[Round My Family Tree]]''"
*"''[[How to Be a Tigger]]''"
*"''[[Your Heart Will Lead You Home]]''"
