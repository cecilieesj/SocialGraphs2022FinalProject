'''''The Night Before Christmas''''' is an animated ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' that was released on [[December 9]], [[1933]], following the previous year's ''[[Santa's Workshop]]''.

==Summary==
In a loose adaptation of Clement C. Moore's famous poem, St. Nick is seen delivering the toys that he made in 1932's ''Santa's Workshop'' to a house full of sleeping children. The toys come alive, and they dance around and have fun. The kids then wake up to find a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of toys.

==Censorship==
*The Amos and Andy toy sequence is cut entirely on television and VHS copies, as well as on the Walt Disney Treasures: More Silly Symphonies DVD as a mistake (Disney would do disc replacements where the cartoon now has the sequence restored back).
*Junior's face getting covered in fireplace soot, leaving him in blackface (which stays on him even as he opens his gift) is cut entirely on television and early VHS copies.

==Trivia==
*This cartoon was featured every Christmas on ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.
*[[Mickey Mouse]] puts in a "guest appearance" in wind-up toy form.
*Footage from this short film was used for the [[Disney Sing Along Songs]] volume, [[Disney Sing Along Songs: Very Merry Christmas Songs|Very Merry Christmas Songs]] for the songs "[[Up on the Housetop]]" and "Parade of the Wooden Soldiers".
*A Walt Disney Christmas VHS presented the cartoon's opening from a reissue print, but the original opening title has been restored back since the Walt Disney Treasures: More Silly Symphonies DVD.
