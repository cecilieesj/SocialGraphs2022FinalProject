'''''The Adventures of Huck Finn''''' is a [[1993]] Disney adventure film starring [[Elijah Wood]] and Courtney B. Vance. It is based on [[Mark Twain]]'s novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, though it focuses almost exclusively on the first half of the book. The film follows a boy named Huckleberry Finn and an escaped slave named Jim, who travel the Mississippi River together and overcome various obstacles along the way. The movie received a "PG" rating from the MPAA for some mild violence and language. This movie was filmed entirely in Mississippi.

==Plot==
Huckleberry Finn, the half-literate son of a drunk, runs away from home and follows the Mississippi River with an escaped slave named Jim. Along the way, the duo encounter adventures with colorful characters like The King and the Duke, two con men who impersonate British visitors in order to swindle three sisters out of their fortune, and Susan Wilks, the spunky 12-year-old girl who gives Huck his first kiss. Jim also re-educates Huck away from the racist views that he has grown up with.
