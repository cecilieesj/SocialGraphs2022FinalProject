== Trivia==
*This is the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid animated film in the series to use the new 2022 Disney logo, due to its Disney's 100th anniversary [[Walt Disney Pictures logo|logo]] to the public.
*Similarly, to ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', but unlike the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid|first installment]], the copyright holder was listed as 20th Century Studios on the film's poster and trailer, rather than Disney Enterprises, Inc.
*This is the second film in the series to be fully animated in a CGI format.
