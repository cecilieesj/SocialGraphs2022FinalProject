==Synopsis==
===The hidden Emperor===
{{Quote|At last. Snoke trained you well.|Darth Sidious, to Kylo Ren|<ref name="IX">{{Film|IX}}</ref>}}
[[File:SidiousandKyloRen-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kylo Ren confronting the Emperor.]]
One [[Standard year|year]] after the events of ''[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', a [[Palpatine's broadcast|broadcast]] using the voice of the [[Battle of Endor|presumed]] [[Death|deceased]] [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] is transmitted across [[the galaxy]], which threatens revenge. [[Supreme Leader]] [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] leads a [[Mission to Mustafar (First Order)|vicious assault]] against [[Alazmec of Winsit|Alazmec colonists]] on a healing [[Mustafar]], seeking [[Vader's wayfinder|a Sith wayfinder]] owned by Ren's grandfather, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. Ren wants to use the device as a guide in his hunt for the source of the broadcast, which he perceives as a threat to his power. The Supreme Leader [[Death|slaughters]] many Alazmec cultists alongside his [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] before retrieving the device and slotting it into [[Kylo Ren's TIE whisper|his TIE whisper]], allowing its dark power to lead him through the [[Red Honeycomb Zone|crimson nebula]] that surrounds the fabled [[Sith]] world of [[Exegol]].

Landing at the base of an enormous [[Sith Citadel|citadel]], Ren ignites [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|his blade]] and enters. He descends down a floating platform into a vast chamber lined with worn statues of Sith legends. As he descends into its depths, he hears the voice of Palpatine telling him that [[Snoke]] trained him well. Ren responds that he had [[Battle of Oetchi|killed]] Snoke, but the voice replies that he "made" Snoke.

Lightning dances around the young [[dark side adept]] as he listens to the taunting words, spoken in a voice transitioning from that of the Emperor to that of Snoke and, finally, to that of Vader: "I have been every voice... you have ever heard... inside your head."

Ren, unshaken, proceeds further into the citadel, walking for some time among the towering effigies. His path lit by his blade, the young man eventually wanders into a maze of unfamiliar equipment tended to by [[Sith cultist|robed acolytes]]. Tall cylinders filled with a sickly golden liquid hold motionless, incomplete bodies with the mutilated visage of the dead Snoke, confirming the Sith Lord's earlier words. Among these machines, bound by innumerable tubes and wires to machines of support and sustenance, is the emaciated and decaying figure of [[Darth]] Sidious, the true identity of the former Emperor Palpatine, himself.

Palpatine speaks, explaining to the Supreme Leader that he has died before, and that the [[dark side of the Force|dark side]] is a pathway to many abilities that some consider "unnatural," echoing his words to Ren's grandfather [[Standard decade|decades]] earlier from ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Ren raises his blade, but the threat seems to leave Sidious unfazed. Ren asks the Emperor what he could give him, and the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] replies that he can give him everything: a new [[Sith Empire|Empire]].

At the surface of Exegol, the icy ground cracks and yields as innumerable [[Xyston-class Star Destroyer|''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers]] emerge from the frozen sea into the tempestuous sky. As the [[fleet]] rises, Palpatine offers to give Ren command of what he calls the [[Final Order]] in return for killing [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], the last [[Jedi]], and thus ending the [[Jedi Order]] and becoming what his grandfather, Vader, could not. He tells Ren that he will rule all the galaxy as the new Emperor, but he also issues a warning that Rey is not who he thinks she is. Ren asks the Dark Lord who Rey is as thunder crackles.

===A vital mission===
{{Quote|He's definitely cheating.|Finn, on Chewbacca's playing of dejarik|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Finn-Falcon-Gunner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Finn manning one of the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} cannons.]]
Meanwhile, on the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', ex-stormtrooper [[Finn]] and [[Resistance pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] engage the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]] in an intense game of [[dejarik]]. The Wookiee takes some time considering his next move, and his human opponents jokingly suggest that he may be cheating. The implication infuriates Chewbacca, forcing Finn and Poe to calm him. Before their game can resume, an alarm sounds from the cockpit. Poe and Finn insist to Chewie that they won't turn off the game, before doing just that as they leave the dejarik table. Passing [[Klaud]], a Resistance technician, in the corridor, the trio arrive in their seats just as the ''Falcon'' exits [[hyperspace]].

The ''Falcon'' arrives at the [[Sinta Glacier Colony]] in order to [[Mission to Sinta Glacier Colony|meet]] a Resistance informant, the [[Ovissian]] [[Boolio]], who tells them about a mysterious spy in the [[First Order]] and gives them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to bring it to Leia. Finn proceeds to insert the message into [[R2-D2]].

Before more can be said, several squadrons of [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter|TIE/sf fighters]] and [[TIE/wi Interceptor|TIE whisper fighters]] enter the system, prepared to take down the ''Falcon''. As Finn prepares for the action and heads to the gunner cockpit, Boolio tells him to win the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] before heading off.

Forced to head into the depths of the colony by a wall of TIE fighters, the ''Falcon ''destroys a number of its pursuers before jumping to hyperspace through one of the colony's walls. The remaining fighters pursue them regardless, and Poe begins [[Hyperspace skipping|lightspeed skipping]] through a number of systems including the [[Mirror-Spires]] of [[Ivexia]] and the [[Megafauna Chasm]], whose dangers the [[First Order TIE Fighter Pilot|First Order pilots]] are unable to evade. Poe is able to outmaneuver the enemy, though his reckless trick-flying heavily damages the ''Falcon''.

===A Jedi rises===
{{Quote|Be with me. Be with me. They're not with me.|Rey, as she meditates|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Rey_meditates.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rey meditates trying to contact the Jedi from the past.]]
On the jungle world of [[Ajan Kloss]], which serves as the hidden base of the Resistance, Rey meditates solemnly, [[The Force|floating in the air]] alongside a number of rocks. She tries to maintain her composure and balance to contact the Jedi that came before her and connecting to the Cosmic energy of the Universe, but ultimately fails and, with a sigh, lowers herself to the ground. General [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who had been watching nearby, comforts the discouraged acolyte, assuring her that nothing is impossible and that she will be able to commune with the Jedi who came before her, as she hopes to.

Reinvigorated, Rey accepts the [[Skywalker lightsaber]] and takes off running on another bout with her training course. She expertly runs and leaps through the obstacles, imbuing her actions with the Force. She blocks every bolt from her hovering [[training droid]], but pauses and stares as it is revealed that Kylo Ren, to whom she is bound through the Force, is communing with his [[Vader's armor|grandfather's helmet]] and speaking to her from his chambers far across the galaxy.

[[File:AjanKloss-Rey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rey trains to become a Jedi and is instructed by her master Leia.]]
A vision, shared with Ren, terrifies the Jedi: the ascension of the Final Order above Exegol; the face of her [[Battle of Starkiller Base|murdered]] mentor and Ren's [[Parent|father]], [[Han Solo]]; the pained words of her master, [[Luke Skywalker]], as she tapped into the dark side; her duel with and alongside Ren against the [[Elite Praetorian Guard|Praetorian Guards]] of Snoke; the departure of her parents from [[Jakku]], leaving her behind in the grip of [[Unkar Plutt]]. Distracted by the vision, she ultimately batters the training remote with her staff, but damages [[BB-8]] in the process. Rescuing the droid from beneath the tree that had collapsed on him, Rey returns to the base and concedes to Leia that she feels tired and unready to wield the saber of her master. BB-8 excitedly volunteers to take up the mantle, which Rey dismisses. Leia kindly reminds her never to underestimate a droid.

Some time later, in the midst of Rey's studies of the [[Sacred Jedi texts|ancient texts]] she retrieved from the [[First Jedi Temple]], the ''Falcon'' returns. However, the ship has been damaged during the course of its escape from the First Order. Rey complains about the damage to the ''Falcon'' but Poe counters by pointing out that BB-8 has been battered by the earlier training accident. While Poe and Rey argue, Finn tries to brief Rey about their mission to meet with the spy. Despite their differences, Poe tells Rey that she is the "best fighter" in the Resistance and thinks that she should be helping them in the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] against the First Order rather than training on Ajan Kloss.

===Dark tidings===
{{Quote|We've decoded the intel from the First Order spy&hellip; and it confirms the worst. Somehow, Palpatine returned.|Poe Dameron|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:HumansInTheResistance-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Resistance comes to terms with confirmation of the Emperor's return]]
At the Resistance briefing room, Poe confirms the authenticity of the message sent across the galaxy: that Palpatine has returned. [[Rose Tico]] is dubious that the Sith Lord has truly risen again; [[Beaumont Kin]] raises the possibility of secrets only the Sith knew, like dark science, and mentioned [[cloning]] to explain his return, later remarking that there were always whispers of Palpatine's desire to cheat death. Poe explains that Palpatine has been planning his revenge for years and that the [[Sith Eternal]] cultists have built a massive fleet known as the Final Order. In sixteen hours, the Sith fleet will embark from Exegol to attack the free worlds.

[[C-3PO]] chimes in, noting that Exegol is not on any [[star map]]s, but is described in lore as the hidden world of the Sith. As the Resistance debates their options, [[Maz Kanata]] proposes that they find the Emperor's hidden world as it's the only way to stop him. Having retrieved a tome, Rey speaks with Leia in private. She tells Leia that the late [[Jedi Master]] Luke had been searching for a [[wayfinder]] in order to reach Exegol. Rey vows to finish her former Master's work. Believing that it is too dangerous, Leia initially refuses to support the mission. However, Rey responds that she will go with or without the General's blessing, knowing that her newest mentor would do the same.

Having received Leia's permission, Rey tells Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO that they need to travel to the [[Forbidden Valley|Forbidden Desert]] of [[Pasaana]]. Though Rey plans to go alone, Poe, Chewie, Finn, and C-3PO insist that they will accompany her. Though initially unwilling to accept the help and claiming she must accomplish the task alone, with a small speech from Finn, Rey accepts their aid. Finn invites his friend Rose to come along but General Organa has tasked her with studying the specs of old Star Destroyers in order to defeat the Final Order. Finn promises to return.

Before departing, C-3PO also tells R2-D2 that should he not survive, the [[astromech droid]] was the "best friend he ever had." Before leaving, Rey speaks once more with Leia, wishing that she could tell the Princess of Alderaan everything she wanted to. Reassuring her student once again, Leia simply says: "tell me when you get back" before handing her the Skywalker lightsaber. Leia tells Rey never to be afraid of who she is. Rey and her friends then depart Ajan Kloss aboard the ''Falcon''.

===The Supreme Leader's court===
{{Quote|We have a spy in our midst. Whoever that traitor is, it won't stop us.|Kylo Ren, to the Supreme Council|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Quinn_execution.png|thumb|right|250px|Supreme Leader Kylo Ren ruled the First Order through fear and terror.]]
A metalsmith, the [[Symeong]] [[Sith alchemist]] [[Albrekh]], welds Ren's helmet back together as he looks on surrounded by his [[Knights of Ren]]. With his helmet reforged, the Supreme Leader convenes a meeting of the First Order's [[Supreme Council]] aboard his ''[[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|Resurgent]]''[[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|-class Star Destroyer]] [[Steadfast (Resurgent-class)|''Steadfast'']], including [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]] and [[Allegiant General]] [[Enric Pryde]]. As Ren and his Knights stride through the ''Steadfast''{{'s}} corridors into the conference room, a [[Unidentified First Order stormtrooper (Steadfast)|stormtrooper]] notes the sudden appearance of the Knights of Ren, and his fellow [[trooper]] compares them to "ghouls."

Supreme Leader Ren slams Boolio's bloody, decapitated head on a table and informs the council that they have a spy in their midst, but says that this [[Treason|traitor]] won't stop the First Order from becoming a true Empire. Ren then asks if General Hux, his rival in the First Order power structure, is troubled by his appearance. General Hux dismisses this concern and compliments Ren, while General [[Bellava Parnadee]] says that she likes Ren's reassembled helmet.

General [[Domaric Quinn]] speaks up, dismissing the Sith loyalists as "a cult, conjurers and soothsayers." [[Allegiant General]] [[Enric Pryde]] refutes these concerns, stating that the resources of the First Order will be increased ten thousand fold by the incorporation of the Sith fleet into their own ranks. With a spiteful glance at a glowering Hux, Pryde remarks that the range and power of the fleet will "correct the error of [[Starkiller Base]]." Unconvinced, Quinn questions the fleet being a gift and what Palpatine might demand in return. In response, Ren brutally [[Force choke|chokes]] the general through [[the Force]] and lifts his body to the ceiling without even looking at him.

The Supreme Leader then commands his [[First Order officer|officers]] to prepare to crush any worlds that defy them and informs them that he and his Knights will be hunting for the [[scavenger]], Rey.

===Mission to Pasaana===
{{Quote|The Aki-Aki Festival of the Ancestors! This celebration occurs only once every forty-two years!|C-3PO|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Forbidden_Valley.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, and C-3PO visited Pasaana searching for clues to find a Wayfinder to Exegol.]]
The ''Falcon'' exits hyperspace above the desert planet of Pasaana. They land at Luke's coordinates and arrive at the [[Aki-Aki]] [[Festival of the Ancestors]]. Wandering among the crowd for a while, the group tries to keep a low profile. As Rey gazes at some Aki Aki youngsters, a child approaches her. Translated by 3PO, the child says she is named [[Nambi Ghima]] and offers a [[Husk necklace|necklace]] to Rey, who smiles and accepts the kind gesture. When Ghima inquires as to the Jedi acolyte's family name, she replies that she doesn't have one.

At that moment, Kylo Ren establishes a connection with Rey through their [[Force-bond]]. Speaking to her through this, Ren informs his quarry that Palpatine wants her dead. Rey comments that he is serving another master, but the fallen Jedi dismisses this, stating that he has plans of his own. Rey points out to Ren that he is haunted by killing his father, and Ren reminds Rey of her feelings of abandonment and loneliness from her parents abandoning her. After insisting that he will turn her to the dark side, Ren reaches out and grabs her necklace, pulling it through the Force into his own hands. Rey realizes the First Order will soon be coming and runs off to warn her friends.

Meanwhile, Ren brings the necklace to a First Order [[officer]] who recognizes the necklace as originating on Pasaana's Forbidden Valley. Ren orders Pryde to alert the local troops and to dispatch reinforcements to Pasaana. As Rey and her friends head back to the ''Falcon'', a stormtrooper finds them but is quickly shot by a mysterious figure. This masked savior asks Rey and her team to follow him.

Once they enter a transport, he reveals himself to be General [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], the man who destroyed the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] at the [[Battle of Endor]] many years prior. He shows them a hologram of a [[Sith wayfinder]] and explains that only two were ever created. He further reveals that he once accompanied Luke on a [[Mission to Pasaana|mission]] to track a man named [[Ochi]], whom they believed held information key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his [[Bestoon Legacy|ship]] abandoned. Lando apparently remained behind on Pasaana. While declining to join the fight due to his old age, the Rebellion hero offers them directions to Ochi's ship, which remains in the desert where he left it.

===Desert chase===
{{Dialogue|C-3PO|Oh! They fly now!|Finn|They fly now?|Dameron|They fly now.|attr=Resistance heroes react to the jet troopers|src=<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Poe-C3PO-Finn-Skimmer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poe, C-3PO, and Finn fleeing First Order forces on Pasaana.]]
Squadrons of [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE/fo fighters]] and First Order dropships fly overhead as the crew hurries through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders. However, they are quickly spotted by a stormtrooper and pursued by [[125-Z treadspeeder bike|First Order treadspeeders]], which are carrying [[First Order jet trooper|jet troopers]]. Poe and Rey split up to lose their pursuers.

Rey is pursued by the jet troopers and two treadspeeders while Poe takes the skiff speeder through a narrow canyon. However, they are intercepted by a treadspeeder lying in wait. BB-8 fires a colored smoke canister, blinding the pursuing treadspeeder and causing to crash onto rocks. Standing her group, Rey fires at the second treadspeeder, causing it to explode. She thanks BB-8, saying never underestimate a droid.

Meanwhile, Finn manages to tie a rope around the treadspeeder's engine. Poe then brings their skiff speeder to a halt, causing the pursuing speeder to crash against a rock. Chewbacca also shoots down a Jet trooper just as Poe's speeder catches up with Rey's speeder. However, the last remaining jet trooper shoots at their two skiffs, causing them to crash onto the rocks and throwing the Resistance team into the [[Shifting Mires|Sinking Fields]]. Rey and her comrades manage to shoot the jet trooper, causing the soldier to crash against the rocks. But then, the Resistance team are sucked by quicksand. Rey tells everyone to grab hold of something, but it doesn't work. As Rey and Finn are sucked into the sand, Finn yells "I never told you!..." to Rey before they both sink.

Back at the Resistance base, [[Major]] [[Temmin Wexley]] informs General Organa that they have received reports of a raid at the [[Festival of the Ancestors]]. Organa says that they cannot afford to fail on this mission. When Wexley says they have not heard from the ''Falcon'', Tico asks if he has to be pessimistic. General Organa asks if Wexley can be optimistic, with Wexley saying that he hopes that things turn out to be great.

===Lair of the vexis===
{{Quote|My programming forbids me from translating it.|C-3PO refuses to translate Sith|<ref name="IX" />}}[[File:Vexis-Databank.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rey healed a serpentine Vexis, which helped them escape the tunnels.]]
Meanwhile, Rey and her team fall through the quicksand into a network of underground tunnels. C-3PO think that they are in the underworld. Rey and Poe use the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive [[flashlight]] to guide them through the tunnels. Rey asks Finn what he meant when he said that he never told her. Finn says that he will tell her later. When Poe asks why Finn is keeping secrets, Finn replies that he will tell them when Poe discloses his "shady" things.

C-3PO leads them to a speeder and discovers a [[Sith Eternal crest|hex charm]], a common emblem of the Sith loyalists. Rey and Poe work out that Ochi was heading back to his ship when he got trapped inside the tunnels. Alongside his bones is a [[Blade of Ochi of Bestoon|dagger]] that Rey senses has a dark past, while 3PO recognizes that it is inscribed with the [[Ur-Kittât|ancient language of the Sith]] and is unable to translate due to restrictions on his programming dating back to the [[Galactic Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]]. Dameron complains to the droid that this is "the one time we need you to talk, and you can't."

While looking for a way out, the team is cornered by an aggressive serpentine [[vexis]]. They prepare to fight the beast but Rey notices that the serpent is injured. Using [[Force healing]], Rey manages to heal the creature, which tunnels through the rock to create an escape for the team. At the same time, it is revealed that the Knights of Ren have arrived on Pasaana, and are hunting them.

===A narrow escape===
[[File:ReyOnPasana-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rey faces Ren's TIE fighter, who tracked her through their Force-bond.]]
The team hurries to [[Bestoon Legacy|Ochi's ship]]. C-3PO thinks they should go back to the ''Falcon'' but Poe warns that the First Order will be waiting for them there. While climbing the rock where Ochi's ship rests, Rey senses that Kylo Ren has arrived through the Force, but sends her friends ahead to the ship before running back into the desert to confront her nemesis. Poe and Finn begin to start up Ochi's ship, and opening the blinders to check on Rey.

Seeing Rey running down the hill, Finn sends Chewbcca after her. However, a Knight of Ren is watching the Wookiee from behind. As Rey waits in the desert, Ren's [[TIE/wi modified interceptor |TIE whisper]] roars through the desert only meters above the sand. While Poe is waiting for Rey, Finn runs out of the ship only to find that the Knights of Ren and stormtroopers had captured Chewbacca and Ochi's dagger while the Wookiee was searching for Rey. Finn watches as Chewbacca is led aboard an [[AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport|Atmospheric Assault Transport]].

As Ren approaches Rey in his new TIE whisper, Rey runs into a leap. As the ship flies beneath her, she severs a wing with her lightsaber and sends the ship into a tailspin. It crashes in a fireball some distance away. Finn informs Rey of Chewbacca's capture and Rey uses the Force to try and pull down the troop transport that she believes is carrying the Wookiee. Poe and C-3PO also watch from the distance.

Kylo Ren, having emerged from the wreckage of his ship, advances across the desert and engages in a duel of the Force with Rey, each of them pulling the First Order transport to their side. In this struggle, Rey accidentally releases a burst of [[Force lightning]], destroying the vessel and seemingly killing Chewbacca. Ren allows the Jedi and her allies to escape in Ochi's vessel, as his own troops have captured the ''Falcon''.

===Setbacks for Team Rey===
[[File:D-Otrailer.png|thumb|left|150px|Despite seemingly "losing" Chewbacca, Rey and her team gained a new ally in the form of the droid D-O.]]
As the Jedi hunter's ship hurries away from Pasaana, Rey mourns that she has apparently killed Chewbacca. Finn attempts to reassure her that it is not his fault, stating that he knows the good person he believes her to be. Rey dismisses his words, telling him that she experienced a vision of herself and Ren on the [[Throne of the Sith]] while touching the dagger.

Meanwhile, the captured ''Millennium Falcon'' is escorted by First Order TIEs aboard the ''Steadfast''. General Hux informs Allegiant General Pryde that they captured the scavenger's ship but that Rey got away. Hux attempts to pin the blame for the loss of shuttle on the Knights of Ren. Pryde is not interested until Hux informs him that a second shuttle brought back a valuable prisoner. As a manacled Chewbacca is led aboard the bridge of the ''Steadfast'', Hux tells Pryde that the "beast" used to fly with Han Solo. Pryde orders that Chewbacca be brought to [[Interrogation Six]].

Back aboard Ochi's ship, Poe tells Finn and Rey they have eight hours left and asks what they should do. Finn proposes going back to base but Poe doesn't want to give up. Finn counters that Chewbacca was carrying the dagger and that without it, they have no way to reach Exegol. However, C-3PO reveals that he has retained the inscription in his [[memory bank]]s. Due to his programming, it cannot be retrieved without a complete redacted memory bypass, effectively a [[memory wipe]].

Despite the risk to C-3PO, a desperate Poe and Finn decide to perform the memory wipe since the galaxy is at stake. Poe decides to seek out a black market droidsmith on the planet [[Kijimi]], a place where he doesn't have fond memories. Despite the risks, Poe, Finn, Rey, and C-3PO resolve to do it in memory of Chewbacca. However, they are followed by another ship.

During the trip, BB-8 finds and reactivates the droid [[D-O]] on Ochi's ship, who requests a battery charge and befriends Rey. Rey takes pity on D-O, who had been treated badly by his previous master and tells the droid that he is safe with them.

===A new mission===
{{Quote|You were a spice runner?!|Finn, after finding out Poe's former occupation|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:ZoriiBliss2-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poe's reunion with Zorii Bliss on Kijimi.]]
The heroes of the Resistance make their way to the snow-dusted planet of Kijimi to execute their plan to discover what secrets the Dagger held. After landing in [[Kijimi City]], the Resistance team avoids a stormtrooper patrol, who are searching and rounding up local civilians. Shortly later, Poe and his friends are cornered by [[Zorii Bliss]] and her crew. She reveals that Poe has a colorful past, once worked as a [[Spice Runners of Kijimi|spice runner]] and that he still owes her money.

Zorii tries to collect a bounty on Rey, leading to a skirmish between the two sides. Rey gains the upper hand over Zorri with her lightsaber and Zorii agrees to help them. The group narrowly avoid a First Order patrol but the Knights of Ren have already tracked them there.

Zorii Bliss brings them through a back alley into [[Babu Frik]]'s [[Babu Frik's workshop|workshop]] in the [[Thieves' Quarter]]. As he is wired up to the computer, C-3PO grumbles that he does not have the faintest idea as to why he agreed to this operation and thinks he must be malfunctioning. Rey asks if Babu Frik can help them. Zorii interprets for Babu, who explains that he has found Sith words in C-3PO's forbidden memory.

Poe asks if Babu can make C-3PO translate the Sith inscriptions. Frik tells everyone that he can unlock the message to be read, but in doing so C-3PO's memory will be wiped. Still reeling from the loss of Chewbacca, the heroes argue about finding another way to get the job done, but in an act of self-sacrifice C-3PO voluntarily consent to the modifications, knowing that he will be lost in the act.

===C-3PO's sacrifice===
{{Dialogue|C-3PO|If this mission fails, it was all for nothing. All we've done. All this time.|Poe|What're you doing there, 3PO?|C-3PO|Taking one last look, sir. At my friends.|attr=C-3PO to Poe|src=<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Babu_Frik.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Babu Frik preparing to perform a delicate operation on C-3PO.]]
While Poe and Zorii leave to keep a watch for First Order patrols, Frik begins performing the hack on C-3PO. Meanwhile, Allegiant General Pryde informs Kylo Ren that the Knights of Ren have tracked the "scavenger," which [[Admiral]] [[Frantis Griss]] identifies as a settlement called Kijimi. General Hux proposes destroying the city but Ren raises his finger menacingly, cutting him off.

Outside the bar, Zorii and Poe reminisce about old times. There is some lingering connection there even though they had some sort of falling out in the past. Zorii tells Poe that she had saved up enough money to procure a [[First Order Captain's Medallion]], which she intends to use to travel offworld to the [[Colonies]], leaving her spice running days behind. Poe also tells Zorii that the Resistance sent out a distress call during the [[Battle of Crait]] but that nobody came, which he blames on fear and people giving up. Zorii disagrees and says that the First Order wins by making people think they are alone. She reminds Poe that there is more of them.

Meanwhile, Rey socializes with D-O, who takes a liking to Rey and her friends. Rey confides in Finn that she sensed that her parents were on Ochi's ship through the Force. Shortly later, Poe and Zorii return with news that the ''Steadfast'' is approaching Kijimi. Babu completes the hack, allowing 3PO to read the message inscribed on the dagger. The translated text points them to the location of [[Emperor's wayfinder]], which is located on the [[Death Star ruins]] on a moon of [[Endor (planet)|Endor]]. Having served his purpose, 3PO's memory wipe begins, and he shuts down. Once the memory wipe is complete, 3PO reboots with a completely empty memory.

===Rescuing Chewbacca===
[[File:Force-bond_battle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rey and Kylo Ren fought, while connected by their Force bond.]]
As the ''Steadfast'' arrives above Kijimi City, Rey senses that Chewie is alive. Before leaving, Zorii gives Poe her Captain's Medallion as a gesture of goodwill to help him and his Resistance team get through the First Order blockade. Poe tries to convince Zorii to leave, but she turns down his offer. As the heroes escape on Ochi's ship, the group makes the decision to use the passage device to board the ''Steadfast'' and recapture the ''Falcon'' and save Chewie.

The device works and their ship lands in the Star Destroyer without question. After landing, Rey, Finn and Poe shoot the stormtrooper sentries and head to Chewie's cell. While navigating through the Star Destroyer's corridors, Rey uses a mind trick to confuse the stormtroopers, enabling them to find Chewie. Heading into Chewbacca's detention block, they shoot the cameras. Sensing that Ochi's dagger is on the ship, Rey splits off from the group to retrieve the relic.

On Kijimi, Kylo Ren oversees a manhunt but senses that Rey is close. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn find Chewie and free him from his cell. Elsewhere, Allegiant General Pryde discovers Ochi's ship in the hangar and realizes that there are intruders aboard the ''Steadfast''. Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca exchange fire with stormtroopers while fleeing through the Star Destroyer's corridors. Poe is shot and the group are surrounded by stormtrooper reinforcements, who take them captive.

===Glimpses of Rey's past===
[[File:Hux_Databank_IX_TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|General Hux's resentment of Supreme Leader Ren led him to help Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca escape.]]
Meanwhile, Ochi's dagger leads Rey to Kylo's living quarters where she discovers Darth Vader's charred helmet. Rey finds and grabs Ochi's blade, which carries a vision of [[Miramir|her]] [[Dathan|parents]], when she breaks free of the vision a bond with Kylo begins. Ren tells Rey that he knows the rest of the story about her origins but Rey claims that he is lying.

Ren replies that he never lied to her and that her parents were "no ones" because they chose to be to keep her safe. Resisting his mental probe, Rey crosses blades with Kylo Ren, and a lightsaber duel breaks out between the two of them across two different locations, Kylo on the surface of Kijimi and Rey aboard the ''Steadfast''. Rey discovers that her parents left her on Jakku to protect her.

Meanwhile, Allegiant General Pryde orders the stormtroopers to terminate Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca. While parrying in Ren's quarters, Ren tells Rey that the Emperor had sent Ochi to find and recover Rey. When her parents got in the way and refused to tell Ochi where she was, the Dark Lord gave the order to kill them. As the lightsaber duel continues, Ren discovers that Rey is aboard his flagship after she shatters a stand containing Darth Vader's helmet. Ren tells Rey that she knows why the Emperor always wanted her dead.

===A new revelation===
{{Quote|You're a Palpatine.|Kylo Ren, to Rey|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:DyadofKyloRenandRey-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Kylo Ren reveals to Rey the truth about her origins and the nature of their bond.]]
Before the stormtroopers can execute Finn, Poe, and Chewie, General Hux arrives and volunteers to terminate the prisoners himself. Believing that this is the end, Finn attempts to tell Poe the secret he was going to tell Rey. However, Hux guns down the firing squad and tells a surprised Poe and Finn that he was the spy within the First Order that Finn and Poe had received information from.

Meanwhile, in the hangar, a mind-wiped C-3PO haggles with the stormtroopers. However, Rey arrives and guns down stormtroopers with Chewie's [[bowcaster]]. Before they can find the others, Kylo Ren returns in his shuttle. Rey sends C-3PO, D-O and BB-8 to find Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca. However, Hux leads the Resistance team to the hangar and convinces Finn to shoot him in the arm. When Finn asks Hux about his motives, he tells them that he wasn't doing it to help the Resistance, but rather because he didn't want Kylo Ren to win.

As stormtroopers converge in the hangar, Kylo Ren arrives and faces off Rey. When Rey asks why the Emperor would want to kill a child, Ren reveals that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; her father was the son of the Emperor. Since Ren's mother Leia is the daughter of Darth Vader, he also reveals that they are a [[Force dyad|dyad in the Force]], two that are one in the Force. Rey walks to the edge of the hangar as Kylo extends an offer for Rey to join him in killing the Sith Lord and taking his throne. However, Rey turns down his offer again as the ''Falcon'' arrives and uses its thrusters to throw back the stormtroopers. Finn helps Rey up the gangplank.

After they leave, Hux claims that it was a coordinated incursion and that the Resistance team overpowered the guards and forced him to take them to his ship. However, Pryde is not fooled and executes Hux for treason against the First Order. Pryde then orders a First Order officer to inform the Supreme Leader that they have found their spy.

While the ''Falcon'' is traveling through hyperspace, Poe tells Chewbacca and C-3PO that he doesn't know why the First Order is not following them and that he doesn't trust them. Chewbacca reveals that the ''Falcon''{{'s}} landing gear is busted. While making repairs to the ''Falcon'', Rey tells Finn that all that matters is finding the wayfinder and Exegol. Finn reassures her that is what they are doing. Rey vows to destroy Darth Sidious for killing her father and mother. Finn tells Rey that this doesn't sound like her but Rey responds that nobody knows her.

Meanwhile, the Sith Lord learns from Ren that the Jedi [[Padawan|apprentice]] still lives. Questioning Ren's loyalty, he warns the Supreme Leader not to make him turn his fleet against him. Ren replies that he knows where Rey is going and vows that she will never be a Jedi. Sidious demands Ren to kill Rey.

===Mission to Kef Bir===
{{Quote|He said you'd come. He said you were the last hope.|Jannah, of Rey's team|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Orbak.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Finn and Jannah riding orbak.]]
Using the information learned from C-3PO's translation of the dagger's writing, the Resistance team takes the ''Millennium Falcon'' to the ocean moon of [[Kef Bir]] in the [[Endor system]]. As the ''Falcon'' descends into Kef Bir, they are detected by a [[Gender|woman]] named [[Jannah]], who is riding an [[Orbak]]. Due to its damaged struts, the ''Falcon'' has a hard landing, carving up soil.

Rey, Finn, Poe, C-3PO, Chewbacca, BB-8, and D-O approach a cliff overlooking the sea, where the wreckage of the second Death Star lies in the distance. While Poe and Finn think that it will be difficult to find the wayfinder in the Death Star ruins, Rey uses the dagger to locate the wayfinder by aligning a plate hidden in the hilt with a specific part of the Death Star's wreckage, and discovering the two shapes match perfectly.

The Resistance team is soon joined by a group of humans riding orbak led by Jannah, who asks if they are from the Resistance. When Poe confirms they are from the Resistance, she tells them that they picked up a transmission from Babu Frik telling that Rey and her team were the last hope. Jannah offers to take them to the location of the wayfinder the next day. Since they cannot wait till tomorrow, Poe convinces Jannah and her followers to help them repair the ''Falcon''.

While the droids mingle with the orbaks, Poe and the others repair the ''Falcon'' with the help of Jannah. Finn chats with Jannah, who reveals that she was once a stormtrooper known as TZ-1719 and that her whole [[Company 77|tribe]] were former troopers. Finn is glad to learn that he is not the only deserter from the First Order. They mutinied at a battle in which they were ordered to fire on civilians. Jannah likened it to an instinct while Finn says that Force brought him and his friends here. He admits that he was skeptical but has now embraced the Force.

===Light versus darkness===
[[File:Rey_heals_Kylo_Ren.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Rey heals Kylo Ren and confesses that she did want to take his hand.]]
BB-8 soon tells the group that he has not seen Rey. Returning to the cliff, Poe and the others discover that Rey had commandeered a [[skimmer]] and taken it to the Death Star ruins with the intention of retrieving the wayfinder. Rey takes the skimmer through the choppy seas. Poe and Finn argue about going after Rey. Poe wants to fix the ship first but Finn insists on going after their friend. Finn tells Poe that he and Leia know what Rey is fighting against. Finn and Jannah prepare to leave on a second skimmer to find Rey.

Meanwhile, Rey climbs through the wreckage of the second Death Star to reach the [[Emperor's Throne Room]]. Inside the throne room, Rey senses a dark presence calling her into an adjacent chamber where she finds the second wayfinder. Upon contacting the wayfinder, she is confronted by a [[Force vision]] of herself as a Sith Lady, resulting in a brief duel. The Sith vision abruptly growls and bares [[Tooth|fangs]] at her, causing her to stumble outside the chamber and drop the wayfinder on the floor.

Immediately after, Rey is confronted by Kylo Ren, who had tracked the Resistance team to Kef Bir. After retrieving the wayfinder, Ren urges Rey to embrace the dark side. Rey demands that he return the wayfinder but Kylo Ren counters that the only way that she is going to Exegol is with him before destroying the relic. Furious, Rey attacks Kylo Ren with the Skywalker lightsaber. He dodges her blade before igniting his own [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|crossblade lightsaber]] and leads Rey down a chute.

Back at the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss, Leia senses her son's confrontation with Rey and walks out of the command center, aided by [[Lieutenant]] [[Kaydel Ko Connix|Kaydel Connix]]. Maz Kanata tells R2-D2 that Leia knows what must be done, adding that it will take all her strength to reach her son.

Meanwhile, on Kef Bir, Rey and Kylo Ren continue their duel on the watery Death Star ruins as the waves crash around them. Finn and Jannah, who have arrived, witness the lightsaber duel. Finn calls out to Rey, but she uses the Force to hurl him aside, unwilling to see him get hurt. Rey uses the Force to jump to another floating wreck. Finn tries to follow but is stopped by Jannah.

After exchanging blades, Kylo Ren manages to maneuver Rey towards a [[laser cannon]]. He uses the Force to block her moves and gains the upper hand. However, a dying Leia calls to Kylo through the Force by his birth name, Ben, momentarily distracting him long enough for Rey to grab his crossblade lightsaber and stab him through his torso. At the same time, Leia breathes her last with R2-D2 mourning over his fallen master.

===Ben's return===
{{Quote|No. Kylo Ren is dead. My son is alive.|Han's memory|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:BenSoloandHanSolo-TROS.png|thumb|left|250px|Ben Solo reconciling with a memory of his father, Han Solo.]]
Sensing Leia's death, Rey regrets her actions and uses the Force to heal Ren's wound, making it whole again. Rey then confesses to him that she wanted to join him and take his hand as Ben Solo. Rey then flies away on Ren's TIE whisper, still shaken about her own actions and by her [[Palpatine family|Sith lineage]]. While Finn and Jannah watch in shock, several Resistance members including Maz Kanata, R2-D2, Kaydel Connix, Beaumont Kin, and Temmin Wexley gather to pay respects to their fallen leader. Poe and his team return to Ajan Kloss only to learn from Commander [[Larma D'Acy]] that Leia has passed away. Chewbacca grieves for his fallen friend.

Back on Kef Bir, Ren converses with a memory of his late father Han Solo, who tells him that Kylo Ren is dead, though his son - Ben Solo - is alive. Ren says that Solo is a memory, but Solo says that he is his memory. Solo urges Ren to return even though his mother is gone, stating that what she stood and fought for is not gone. Addressing his son as Ben, Solo touches his cheeks and reassures him that he has the strength to do what he needs to do. Reconciling with his late father, Kylo Ren throws his lightsaber far off into the [[water]] near the wreckage of the Death Star, reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo and rejecting the dark side.

===A show of force===
{{Quote|Send a ship to a world they know. Let it burn|Palpatine to Pryde|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:KijimiGoBoom-TROS.png|thumb|right|250px|The Sith Eternal destroys Kijimi as a demonstration of its power.]]
Aboard the ''Steadfast'', Palpatine communes with Pryde via [[hologram]]. The Emperor is displeased that the late [[Prince]]ss of [[Alderaan]] has disrupted his plan but thinks that her "foolish act" was in vain. He orders Allegiant General Pryde to come to him on Exegol. In light of Kylo Ren's failure to kill Rey, Pryde, a loyal Imperial who had served the Emperor during the time of the "old wars," pledges himself to the Sith Lord once again. Palpatine then commands Pryde to send a ship to a world that is familiar to Rey and her friends. Acting under Palpatine's orders, Pryde sends [[Derriphan|a ''Xyston''-class Star Destroyer]] from the Sith fleet to destroy Kijimi with its [[axial superlaser]].

Back at the Resistance base, Poe, D'Acy, and Beaumont receive news of the [[Destruction of Kijimi|destruction]] of Kijimi and realize that Palpatine has a fleet of planet-destroying warships. Rose intercepts a transmission from Palpatine stating that "the Resistance is dead and that the Sith flame will burn." Palpatine demands that all worlds surrender or die as the Final Order begins. Rose informs Poe that Leia also made him acting general and asks what they should do.

===Passing the torch===
{{Quote|Confronting fear is the destiny of a Jedi. Your destiny. If you don't face Palpatine, it will mean the end of the Jedi, and the war will be lost.|Luke's Force spirit encouraging Rey|<ref name="IX" />}}
In private, Poe pays his respects to the late General Organa and confides that he is not ready. He is soon joined by Lando Calrissian who confides that neither were he, Luke, Han or Leia during the days of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]]. When Poe asks Lando how he defeated an Empire with almost nothing, Lando replies that they had each other.

D-O tells Finn that he misses Rey. Later, Poe appoints Finn as his second-in-command. Finn tells Poe that D-O can help them get to Exegol and explains that D-O's former master Ochi had intended to bring Rey to Sidious on Exegol.

[[File:LukeSkywalkerForceGhost-TROS.png|thumb|left|250px|The Force spirit of Luke Skywalker guiding Rey prior to her confrontation with Darth Sidious.]]
Meanwhile, on [[Ahch-To]], Rey burns Kylo Ren's TIE whisper, intending to exile herself to the oceanic world. As she prepares to throw the Skywalker lightsaber into the burning wreckage of Kylo's TIE whisper, Luke's [[Force spirit]] appears and tells Rey that a Jedi's weapon deserves more respect. Rey tells Luke that she was haunted by the dark vision and that she plans to exile herself to prevent that from happening.

Luke tells Rey that he was wrong to let fear keep him here. When Luke asks Rey about her greatest fear, Rey confides that she is a [[Palpatine family|Palpatine]]. Skywalker comforts Rey by telling her that he and his sister Leia knew her true lineage but still trained her because she knew Rey's spirit and heart. Luke tells her that confronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi and encourages Rey to face Darth Sidious or else it will mean the end of the Jedi and the War will be lost.

He also gifts Rey [[Leia's lightsaber]], explaining that during the last night of Leia's Jedi training, she had sensed the death of her son. Leia had surrendered her saber to her so that it would be picked up by someone who would finish her journey. Luke tells Rey that a thousand generations now live in her and tells her to take both blades to Exegol. Rey is still dismayed, as Kylo destroyed the wayfinder on Kef Bir. Luke says that Rey has everything she needs. Then, Rey remembers that two Sith wayfinders were made, and salvages Kylo's wayfinder from the burning TIE whisper. Luke then uses the Force to levitate his old [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|T-65B X-wing]], [[Red Five (T-65B X-wing starfighter)|''Red Five'']], from the depths of the sea.

===Preparing for war===
[[File:Resistance_Episode_IX.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Resistance mustering for the assault on Exegol.]]
Back on Ajan Kloss, a memory&ndash;wiped C-3PO interacts with R2-D2, whom he does not remember. R2-D2 restores C-3PO's memories, and he recalls that he is going to embark on his first mission with Rey. R2-D2 reminds him that the mission has already occurred. R2-D2 then picks up a signal.

Meanwhile, Finn, Poe and Rose plug D-O into a [[navigation computer]] in order to access the coordinates to Exegol to plan their air strike against the Sith fleet. They find that the planet is surrounded by various obstacles including magnetic crossfields, gravity wells, and solar winds. C-3PO then informs them that they are receiving a transmission from ''Red Five'', which is transmitting the coordinates to Exegol.

Guided by Kylo Ren's Sith wayfinder, Rey flies ''Red Five'' through the obstacles around Exegol. Finn and Poe realize that Rey is showing them the way to Exegol. Beaumont tells Chewbacca that they need him. Poe briefs the Resistance pilots about their planned airstrike on Exegol, telling them that they need to take out the navigation tower that the Sith Eternal is using to guide the Sith fleet. Finn and Poe propose taking out the tower in a joint air and ground assault. Their plan is to attack the scattered Sith fleet. Lando supports their plans.

When Beaumont proposes the "[[Holdo maneuver]]," Finn disagrees since that move is one in a million and says that fighters and cannons would destroy their ships. [[Nien Nunb]] and Kaydel Ko Connix point out that the [[Resistance navy|Resistance fleet]] is outnumbered but Finn says that Lando and Chewbacca will go to the [[Core Worlds|Core Systems]] and rally support for the Resistance. Poe tells the Resistance fighters not to fall into the trap of thinking they are alone and that good people will fight with the right leadership. As Poe speaks, the Resistance pilots climb into their starfighters and starships including the [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Finn ends the speech by saying that they are now taking the war back to the First Order.

===Into the thick of battle===
[[File:Battle_of_Exegol.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Resistance takes on the Sith Eternal forces.]]
As Rey approaches Exegol, a [[Sith Eternal officer]] alerts her superiors while Allegiant General Pryde orders the Sith fleet to rise to deployment altitude. Rey lands ''Red Five'' on the dark surface of Exegol and walks into the Sith Citadel. Rey walks past several statues and machines into a tunnel.

Meanwhile, Poe and Finn lead the Resistance fleet through the cloud of red gas and debris and exit hyperspace above Exegol. Alerted to the arrival of the Resistance fleet, Allegiant General Pryde orders the Sith fleet to use [[ion cannon]]s. The Sith Star Destroyers blast the Resistance ships and starfighters with ion cannons and turbolasers. Poe leads the [[Exegol landing team]] towards the navigation tower on Exegol's surface.

The Sith Eternal deploys swarms of [[TIE/dg starfighter|Sith TIE fighters]]. Realizing the Resistance's plan to attack the navigation tower, Pryde orders the First Order officers to switch the navigation source to the ''Steadfast'', saying that they will guide the Sith fleet out themselves. The navigation tower is deactivated, forcing Finn to call off the ground invasion.

Through the Force, Finn senses that the navigation signal is coming from the ''Steadfast''. When Jannah asks how he knows, he replies that he feels it. Finn convinces a female starfighter commander to give the Resistance troop carrier covering fire while they attack the command ship. Finn and Jannah lead the landing party, who are riding obraks, in the assault against the ''Steadfast'''s navigation tower, facing opposition from crimson [[Sith trooper]]s and [[Sith Jetpack Trooper]]s.

===Sith machinations===
{{Quote|She will take her revenge, and with a stroke of her saber, the Sith will be reborn! The Jedi are ''dead''!|Darth Sidious, to Rey and the Sith loyalists|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:ReyMeetsPalpatine-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rey confronts her grandfather, Darth Sidious.]]
Meanwhile, Rey enters a massive auditorium where she discovers the empty throne of the Sith and a large crowd of Sith loyalists. Rey is soon joined by the Dark Lord, who is supported by an [[Ommin harness]]. Darth Sidious tells Rey that he has been waiting for the return of his grandchild. The [[Sith Lord]] claims that he never wanted her dead and that he only wanted her to assume the Sith throne, stating that it is her birthright. Rey says that she has come to end the Sith as a Jedi. Sidious tries to goad Rey into killing him, telling her that by doing so all of the spirits of the Sith will flow into her, and they will become one.

Above Exegol, the Sith Star Destroyers fire up their engines. Poe asks Finn about the landing team's progress. Finn tells them that the hatches are sealed and that they are facing opposition. While BB-8 opens a manhole, Finn and Jannah provide covering fire, with Jannah using a crossbow to shoot down a Sith jet trooper. Jannah throws explosives inside the manhole, causing an explosion that takes out the navigation signal temporarily.

In response, Allegiant General Pryde orders his subordinates, including Admiral Griss, to reset the navigation signal. As the Resistance strike team prepares to leave, Finn tells Jannah that he needs to stay behind to stop them from resetting the signal. Jannah insists that she stay with Finn. Meanwhile, Poe admits to R2-D2 that he doesn't know when Lando and reinforcements are coming. When [[Colonel]] [[Aftab Ackbar]] asks what they should do, Poe orders the starfighter pilots to hit the Sith Star Destroyers until reinforcements arrive.

Back in the Sith Citadel, Sidious calls on Rey to give into her hatred and kill him, though Rey refuses to show her hatred for the Sith Lord. When Sidious calls her parents weak, Rey counters that they were strong and saved her from him. Sidious recalls that her master Luke had his father to help him while the only family that Rey has is him. Just then, the roof of the Sith Citadel opens, showing the battle above.

Sidious claims that Rey can save her friends by killing him and assuming the throne. He invites her to become Empress of the new Sith Empire and command the Sith fleet. As he speaks, the [[Sith Eternal military|Sith Eternal forces]] inflict damage on the Resistance starfighters and landing team.

===A dyad in the Force===
[[File:Ben-and-Rey-on-Exegol.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Rey and Ben Solo stand together to face Sidious.]]
Meanwhile, Ben Solo lands on Exegol in an old [[TIE scout]] and runs to the Sith Citadel. As the Dark Lord tempts Rey, Ben forces his way into the depths of the Sith Citadel, taking down several [[Sovereign Protector]]s.

Back on the ''Steadfast'', Finn convinces Rose to go while he and Jannah prepare to take the command bridge down. At the Sith Citadel, Sidious calls on Rey to embrace the dark side and pledge herself as a Sith while his disciples chant in unison. Ben soon runs into the Knights of Ren and fights them, but he is quickly overwhelmed. As Rey draws the Skywalker lightsaber, Sidious implores her to strike him down, ending the Jedi and rebirthing the Sith.

However, Rey rejects the Sith Lord's demand and, sensing him through their dyad, transfers the lightsaber to Ben, who uses it to fight the Knights of Ren. One by one they are defeated. At the throne room, Rey draws Leia's lightsaber and fights the Sovereign Protectors while Sidious retreats in the Ommin harness. Ben hurls the last Sovereign Protector aside with the Force. Together, he and Rey face the Emperor, who taunts them that they will die together for daring to stand against him.

Sidious uses the Force to throw Rey and Ben to their knees, inadvertently drawing part of their life essences. Realizing that the two are a dyad in the Force, the Sith Lord decides to rejuvenate himself by draining their life essences and become the one true Emperor. Rey and Ben are weakened by the exertion and collapse on the floor. Meanwhile, the Resistance suffers heavy losses, including Wexley, whose X-wing crashes into a Sith Star Destroyer much to the dismay of Poe. As Poe hears the distress of his comrades on the [[comlink]], he apologizes that he thought that they had a chance, but there is just too many of them.

===Allies to the rescue===
[[File:GalaxyFleet.png|thumb|right|250px|Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca brought a citizens' fleet to Exegol to defeat the Sith Eternal forces.]]
Just then, Poe hears Lando's voice on the comlink, reassuring him that "there are more of them." Shortly later, Lando and Chewbacca arrive in the ''Millennium Falcon'', accompanied by a massive [[Citizens' Fleet]], including Rebellion hero Commander [[Wedge Antilles]], who compliments Lando's flying as he guns on the ''Falcon''. The reinforcements reinvigorate the Resistance forces. Poe orders the combined forces to take out the Sith Star Destroyers' world-destroying superlaser cannons. As several Sith Star Destroyers go up in flames, Pryde asks where they got this navy from. Admiral Griss replies that the armada is not a navy, but are just people. Poe is also relieved that his former associate Zorii Bliss has come to their aid.

Back at the Sith Citadel, the rejuvenated Emperor reveals himself to his Sith followers, who chant in unison. Ben rises to his feet but the Dark Lord levitates him in mid-air. Sidious tells Ben that he will be the last Skywalker and uses the Force to throw him into a nearby chasm, seemingly killing him. Determined to let nothing stop the return of the Sith, Sidious unleashes Force lightning on the Resistance fleet and allied armada, destroying several ships, including the ''Tantive IV'', and killing Resistance members like [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Nien Nunb]].

As Rey lies on the ground, she repeatedly says "be with me", continuing contacting the Jedi ghost and connecting to the Pure Cosmic energy of the entire Universe. She then hears the voice of Luke and his father's master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] telling her that these are her final steps and telling her to rise and take them. This is followed by the voices of Luke's father Anakin Skywalker, Anakin's former apprentice [[Ahsoka Tano]], and [[Jedi Knight|Knight]] [[Kanan Jarrus]] calling out her name. Anakin urges Rey to bring back the balance to the Force [[Chosen One|as he did]]. The voice of Master [[Luminara Unduli]] calls on Rey to find the light.

The voices of Master [[Yoda]] reassure Rey that she has never been alone. The voice of Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] tells Rey that every Jedi who has ever lived lives in her. Anakin then reminds Rey that the Force surrounds her while Master [[Aayla Secura]] tells Rey to let the Force guide her as Ahsoka's voice finishes the statement. Master [[Mace Windu]] tells her to feel the Force while Anakin tells her to let it lift her. The voice of Master [[Adi Gallia]] encourage Rey to rise while Qui-Gon tells her that they stand behind her.

Kenobi calls out to Rey while Yoda urges Rey to rise. The voice of Kanan tells Rey that in the heart of a Jedi lies their strength. Kenobi then joins the other Jedi in urging Rey to rise, lending their strength to the weakened woman. As she rises to her feet, Luke tells her that the Force will be with her always. Drawing Leia's lightsaber, Rey confronts Sidious, who halts his attack on the fleet.

Believing that he is at the cusp of victory, the Sith Lord taunts Rey that her death will be the final word in the story of Rebellion. Sidious furiously attempts to destroy Rey with Force lightning, but she deflects it back with Leia's lightsaber. Free of the Force lightning attack, Poe urges the allied fleet to make a final offensive against the Sith Star Destroyers, which have ascended into Exegol's upper atmosphere.

Continuing the Force lightning attack on Rey, the Sith Lord angrily taunts her that she is nothing more than a scavenger girl and no match for the power in him. Darth Sidious boasts that he is all the Sith, but Rey retorts that she is all the Jedi. Using the Force to retrieve the Skywalker lightsaber, she crosses blades and uses them to push back the Dark Lord's Force lightning attack. The Emperor is disintegrated by his own Force lightning, which triggers a massive wave of energy that destroys the throne of the Sith and the auditorium, crushing and killing all of his followers.

===Victory and Sacrifice===
[[File:BenandReyKiss-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Rey and Ben Solo acknowledge their connection and feelings for each other by sharing a kiss after Darth Sidious' defeat.]]
Meanwhile, on the ''Steadfast'', Jannah connects the cables on a hijacked [[laser cannon]], which opens fire on the bridge of the command ship. On the Resurgent Star Destroyer, Allegiant General Pryde watches in horror as the Resistance destroys the Sith fleet. Moments later he is killed when the bridge explodes. An [[Abednedo]] pilot named [[C'ai Threnalli]] tells Poe that the ''Steadfast'' has been destroyed. The Resistance and allied armada take out the remaining Sith forces.

Meanwhile, Finn and Jannah cling on to dear life as the stricken ''Steadfast'' descends into the atmosphere. Poe wants to rescue Finn and Jannah but Lando and Chewbacca use the ''Falcon'' to rescue the two Resistance fighters, who jump to safety before the ''Steadfast'' crashes onto the surface and disintegrates.

Back at the Sith Citadel, an exhausted Rey dies as a result of the duel with the Sith Lord. Her death is sensed through the Force by Finn. Shortly later, a hand appears at the edge of the chasm and an injured Ben pulls himself up, falling to his knees beside Rey and pulling her dead body into his lap. He embraces Rey's body. Pulling away, Ben puts his hand on her stomach and uses the [[Force healing|Force]] to resurrect her. Rey awakens, smiling at Ben and touching his cheek gently. The two embrace before Rey kisses him. After they kiss, Ben smiles at her as he closes his eyes. Moments later, he falls backward and vanishes, having given his remaining life essence to Rey. His body fades away at the same moment that Leia's body becomes one with the Force. Maz Kanata also senses Ben's death from afar.

As the wrecked Sith fleet crashes on the surface of Exegol, Finn and Poe spot ''Red Five''. Finn tells Poe that people are [[Uprising against the First Order|rising up]] against the First Order all over the galaxy and the two say they did it. On [[Bespin]], a damaged Resurgent Star Destroyer descends into the atmosphere below [[Cloud City]]. On [[Endor]], the [[Ewok]] war hero [[Wicket Wystri Warrick|Wicket W. Warrick]] and his son, [[Pommet Warrick|Pommet]], watch as another Resurgent Star Destroyer is destroyed by a [[Unidentified heavy freighter|heavy freighter]] via the "Holdo manuever" in the skies above the moon. On [[Jakku]], a stricken Resurgent Star Destroyer crashes, joining a [[Inflictor|wrecked]] [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] from the [[Battle of Jakku]].

===Triumph of the Resistance===
{{Quote|People are rising up all over the galaxy. Poe, we did it.''"''<br />''"''We did it.|Finn and Poe Dameron|<ref name="IX" />}}
[[File:Uprising_on_Endor.png|thumb|right|250px|Uprisings against the First Order erupted across the galaxy, including on Endor.]]
The Resistance and the galaxy at large celebrate their victory against Sidious and the Sith Eternal. On Ajan Kloss, the victorious pilots and Resistance fighters embrace each other. Finn watches as Rose hugs Chewbacca. [[Maz Kanata]] bestows Chewbacca with a [[Medal of Bravery]], which Han and Luke were awarded following the [[Battle of Yavin]]. Poe and Zorii exchange a look and it seems like Poe is trying to ask Zorii if she would like to celebrate with him privately, to which she shakes her head.

Poe then hugs Finn. Shortly later, Rey returns aboard ''Red Five''. Jannah asks Lando where he is from and he tells her that he is from the [[Gold system]]. Lando in turn asks Jannah where she is from, and she tells him that she doesn't know, and Lando responds by saying "well, let's find out." Rey sees Finn and Poe, and the three of them embrace.

===Heir to the Skywalkers===

[[File:ReySkywalker.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey adopts the Skywalker surname.]]
On [[Tatooine]], Rey flies the ''Millennium Falcon'' past a [[Jawa]] [[sandcrawler]]. Together with BB-8, Rey visits the abandoned [[Lars Homestead|Lars homestead]], where she buries Anakin and Leia's lightsabers in the sand, having now built [[Rey's lightsaber|her own]]&mdash; a black-handled lightsaber with a yellow blade. [[Unidentified Tatooine elder|A local]] asks her name and, seeing spirits of Luke and Leia look on, Rey gives her name as "Rey Skywalker." Rey and BB-8 then watch the [[Binary star|twin suns]] of Tatooine rose.

"Here's the process," he said. "I had the good fortune to go and visit JJ Abrams [the film's director] while he was shooting ''The Rise of Skywalker''. While I was there, he put me in a stormtrooper uniform and we had a really fun day on set. "It's been one of my life-long goals to be a stormtrooper, so I can tick that off now." He also pinpointed the moment in which he is seen (or rather, his stormtrooper costume is) and heard, which is during a scene set on Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver) spaceship. "What is in the cut is my voice saying 'Knights of Ren' as Kylo Ren walks down a hallway past two stormtroopers. I am one of those stormtroopers," he said.|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ajaFH}}</ref>
