'''''Cannibal Capers''''' is a ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' that was released on [[March 13]], [[1930]]. This is one of the [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] cartoons that doesn't air on TV anymore because of its depiction of African natives but still survives on DVD.

==Synopsis==
The opening scene appears to be some palm trees swaying in the wind, only they turn out to be the legs and grass skirts of dancing cannibals. The jungle tribe's riotous musical celebration is interrupted by a fierce lion. The lion chases one of the natives and bites him on the butt. The lion's teeth come out, still attached to the native's butt. The native takes the teeth, puts them in his mouth, and chases the lion, biting him as the cartoon ends. The cartoon has several fun gags, such as one native being mistaken as a turtle and thrown into the stew pot. A [[The Mickey Mouse Club|''Mickey Mouse Club'']] version is incomplete, ending with the lion chasing the native and leaving out the very end.
