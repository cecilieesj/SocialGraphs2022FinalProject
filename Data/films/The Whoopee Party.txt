'''''The Whoopee Party''''' is a black-and-white ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' animated short. It was released in [[1932]].

==Summary==
In the film, Mickey and the gang are throwing a party for all of their friends. [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] and [[Clarabelle Cow|Clarabelle]] perform a song while Mickey, [[Horace Horsecollar|Horace]], and [[Goofy]] (known at this time as Dippy Dawg) are in the kitchen preparing some refreshments. Once the refreshments are finished and distributed, an energetic jam session breaks out that causes the guests and even inanimate objects to dance to the music. As the cartoon ends, police officers arrive to seemingly put an end to the party due to complaints from neighbors, but end up joining it instead.

==Trivia==
*In his first screen appearance since his debut as an audience member in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' earlier that year, Dippy Dawg/Goofy first takes on the role of a predominant member of Mickey's gang. His design had also been changed to look younger and more clean-shaven. This design would more or less be consistent on film until the 1935 ''Mickey Mouse'' cartoon ''[[On Ice]]''.
*Some of the animation of Mickey dancing with a lady pig in this film was originally used in the 1930 Mickey Mouse Cartoon ''[[The Shindig]]''.
**The episode on House of Mouse is identical to the Walt Disney Treasures version, although the blackface matches gag was replaced with repeated footage.
