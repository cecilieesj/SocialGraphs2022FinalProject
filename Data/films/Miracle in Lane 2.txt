'''''Miracle in Lane 2''''' is a [[2000]] [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] starring [[Frankie Muniz]], Rick Rossovich, Molly Hagan, and Patrick Levis.



==Plot==
The film tells the true story of Justin Yoder, a boy that was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, and resumes his life in a wheelchair. He lives with his protective mother, Sheila, and father, Myron, and brother, Seth, who is a sports jock. Due to his disability, he desperately tries to find something he can do that would make him feel special. For guidance, he confronts God (who in the film takes form as a famous race-car driver, Bobby Wade) during his journey.

After discovering a soapbox racer in his neighbor's shed, Justin hopes to participate in soapbox racing and eventually finds a love and talent for the sport. For his handicap, Myron and their neighbor, Vic, build a customized racer with a handbrake (called the "Justin Brake"). Meanwhile, Seth feels that their parents focus too much on Justin rather than treating both boys equally. Seth, however, has a change of heart when Justin has a bad crash during a race.

The Yoders is then confronted with the idea that Justin's involvement within the sport may be hazardous to his health. At the end of the film, he asks God if people are perfect when they go to heaven, and God shows him a heaven where there are people with and without wheelchairs, all together, to which Justin happily replies "perfect".

As a tribute to Justin, live video clips of him are shown before the closing credits.
