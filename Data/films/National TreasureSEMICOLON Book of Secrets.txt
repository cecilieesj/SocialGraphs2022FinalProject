==Plot==
In 1865, John Wilkes Booth and Michael O'Laughlen, both members of the Knights of the Golden Circle, enter a tavern and approach Thomas Gates (Ben Gates' great-great-grandfather), a well-known puzzle solver, to decode a message written in Booth's diary. Thomas begins to translate the message. While he does so, Booth leaves to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. Thomas solves the puzzle, a clue to a map to Cibola, the city of gold, but realizes the men are still loyal to the South and have a sinister motive for finding the treasure. He rips several pages from the diary and throws them in the fireplace. Thomas is shot, and the gunman attempts to retrieve the pages, but only obtains a page fragment.

Over 140 years later, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is telling his great-great-grandfather's story at a Civilian Heroes conference. Black market dealer Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) displays one of the 18 missing pages of John Wilkes Booth's diary, with Thomas Gates' name on it, convincing everyone that Thomas was not only a conspirator, but the grand architect of the Lincoln assassination. Ben sets out to prove the innocence of his great-great-grandfather. He discovers a cipher pointing to Édouard Laboulaye hidden on the back of the diary page. He travels to Paris, where he finds a clue engraved on the torch of the scale model of the Statue of Liberty on the Île aux Cygnes, referring to the two Resolute desks. Ben then heads to London to look at the desk at Buckingham Palace with the help of his friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and estranged girlfriend, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Ben makes a scene by pretending to be drunk and starting a fake argument with Abigail, and they are both arrested. Thanks to Riley who had previously hacked into the security system, they escape the cell and reach the desk via service elevator. From the Queen's desk, Ben obtains an ancient wooden plank with ancient symbols carved into it.

Meanwhile, Wilkinson clones Patrick Gates' (Jon Voight) cell phone in order to track Ben's whereabouts. Wilkinson eventually obtains the plank, but not before Ben manages to photograph it. At Ben's insistence, Patrick reluctantly asks his ex-wife and Ben's mother, Dr. Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) for help in translating the symbols. She does so, but points out that some of the glyphs are partial, leading Ben to conclude another plank must be hidden in the other Resolute desk in the Oval Office. Ben and Abigail coax Abigail's new love interest, Connor (Ty Burrell), who works at the White House, into letting them into the office to see the desk. Ben discovers that the second plank is missing, but he does find a stamp bearing the seal of the [[Book of Secrets]]. Riley tells Ben that the Book of Secrets contains documents collected by presidents for presidents' eyes only, covering such controversial subjects as the eighteen minutes erased from the Watergate tapes, Area 51, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Ben crashes the President's birthday party at Mount Vernon. He convinces the President (Bruce Greenwood) to follow him into a secret tunnel where he confronts him about the book; the President sympathetically warns Ben that his actions will be interpreted as an attempt to kidnap the president, which is a federal offense. The President reveals the location of the book, in the Library of Congress.

In the book, Ben finds a picture of the missing plank from the desk and an entry by President Coolidge, who found the plank in 1924, had it destroyed, and commissioned Gutzon Borglum to carve Mount Rushmore to erase the map's landmarks. Ben, Riley, Abigail, and Patrick head to Mount Rushmore where they meet Wilkinson, who has kidnapped Ben's mother. He helps them find the entrance of a cave containing the legendary Native American city of gold, [[Cíbola]]. While exploring the small room Riley accidentally touches a old rope that immediately breaks causing a large hammer to fall on the counterweight that held the stone door open to fall over. The door rolls shut sealing the group in with the only way out is forward. Riley finds a small golden idol in a room. All but Patrick and Emily follow before the floor below drops them into a large pit where they land on a large platform. They are forced to balance the platform on all 4 corners to prevent it from falling. Abigail finds a ladder which the must walk evenly to the center of the platform while one stays on the end with the ladder. Only until Mitch gets on the ladder the platforms supports break. Using a heavy gold idol to help Ben up, he jumps on the ladder just as the platform gives up and collapses. With Patrick and Emily being separated they find a alternate route throw a pile of stones. They find themselves over a gap in a bridge with the only way being the using of a tightrope. Ben and the others find a large room with the sound of water flowing. Using a torch on oil placed in the stairway rails, they believe this room to be the city but rather another puzzle. Ben noticed the water flows down after finding a gold statue underwater. They turn a large wheel in the middle of the room which closes the stone floodgate on the water falls. they eventually find the city of gold and are reunited with Patrick and Emily.

However, due to extreme pressure from the water, the floodgates begins to leak and slowly break apart from the pressure. The floodgates soon give way as well as other gates burst and rapidly flood the city just as the group were collecting large gold fragments of the city in order to leave the city of gold when it suddenly begins flooding, one person has to stay behind to hold open the stone door to the drainage tunnel beneath the city, an action which would result in certain death. When Ben becomes trapped under the door, Wilkinson has to choose either to stay behind and sacrifice himself or everybody will drown. He chooses to give the others a chance to escape, and Ben promises to give Wilkinson part of the credit for discovering himself.

Ben clears his family's name with the discovery and is cleared of all charges when the President tells everyone that Ben did not kidnap him, but actually saved his life when the secret passage they were looking at was accidentally activated. Everyone including Wilkinson is given credit for the discovery of the Lost City of Gold.

==Accuracy==
The film's portrayal of the Knights of the Golden Circle, which disbanded in 1863, and British-Confederate relations was inaccurate. Efforts which were made by Confederate Secretary of State Judah Benjamin to have Britain simply recognize the Confederate States were unsuccessful.<ref> https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/charlottes-monument-jewish-confederate-was-hated-even-it-was-built-180975887/</ref>

==Novelizations==
Disney Press published an official novelization of the screenplay titled ''National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets The Junior Novel'' on November 6, 2007.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure:_Book_of_Secrets#cite_note-9 &#91;10&#93;]</sup> Parts of the story in the novel version differ slightly from what was actually filmed, owing to changes being made in the screenplay prior to and during production. For example, in the novel, Ben and Abigail photograph the wooden plank found hidden in the Queen's desk and leave it behind, with the car chase following. But in the movie, they take the plank with them on the chase.

Also published on the same day as the official novelization was a companion youth novel ''Changing Tides: A Gates Family Mystery'' by Catherine Hapka. Its story is set in England in the year 1612 and is the first in a series of planned historical novels about the Gates family. The epilogue from ''Changing Tides'' is included at the back of the ''National Treasure'' book.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure:_Book_of_Secrets#cite_note-10 &#91;11&#93;]</sup> The second youth novel by Hapka, ''Midnight Ride: A Gates Family Mystery'', was published on March 8, 2008.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure:_Book_of_Secrets#cite_note-11 &#91;12&#93;]</sup>
