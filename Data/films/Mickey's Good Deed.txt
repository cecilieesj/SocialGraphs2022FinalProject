'''''Mickey's Good Deed''''' is a Christmas-themed ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' animated cartoon released for a limited engagement on [[December 9]], [[1932]] before widespread release on [[December 17]]. Set during Christmas at the height of the Great Depression, the cartoon depicts [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and his dog [[Pluto]] as poor street performers who try to make it a happy Christmas for an even poorer family.

==Synopsis==
On Christmas Eve, a homeless [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], accompanied by [[Pluto]], is playing Christmas carols on a stand-up bass for change, but he ends up getting bolts instead of real change.

He then goes to play music outside a rich family's mansion, where a boy named [[Adelbert]] is inside and refusing all the expensive toys that [[Adelbert's Father|his father]] and the Butler try to give him. Then, upon hearing Pluto's howling, Adelbert walks over to the window and peers outside. Upon seeing Pluto, he says that he wants a dog and his father tells the butler to buy the dog. Mickey refuses to sell his companion at first, but when his bass gets destroyed by a passing sleigh and he sees a house full of poor children with their father (who resembles [[Pete]]) in jail and their mother crying, he changes his mind and sells Pluto to the rich family. He uses the money to buy lots of toys and a Christmas dinner in a basket. Then, dressed as Santa Claus, he delivers it to the poor children and their mother, who is now snoring when he makes it back to their house.

Back at the mansion, Adelbert is throwing expensive items, toys and food in Pluto's direction. His father gets hit a few times, Pluto trips the butler, and the mansion becomes a mess in the process. Adelbert's father finally loses it; he tells the butler to throw Pluto out, drags Adelbert onto his knee, pulls his pants down and spanks him. Pluto laughs as this happens and then leaves to search for Mickey.

On a snowy hill top, Mickey is roasting a hot dog with a snowy replica of Pluto. Pluto notices Mickey and runs up to meet him. Mickey becomes delighted and the two enjoy a roasted turkey tied to Pluto's tail.
