| Plot                    = As [[Wade Wilson (Earth-TRN414)|Wade Wilson]] walks down the street of a ghetto neighbourhood, he witnesses an old man getting mugged at gunpoint. Deciding to intervene, Wade goes to a nearby phone booth to change into his Deadpool costume, to the tune of [[wikipedia:John Williams|John Williams]]' ''[[wikipedia:Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''-theme. He struggles doing so however, taking too long changing into his costume, which results in the old man eventually getting shot and killed, with the mugger having already fled. Deadpool decides to do small talk with the corpse of the old man, and starts to eat the ice-cream that was part of his groceries.
