| Plot                    = One year after [[Steven Rogers (Earth-199999)|Captain America]]'s disappearance, [[Margaret Carter (Earth-199999)|Agent Peggy Carter]] of the [[Strategic Scientific Reserve (Earth-199999)|SSR]] has been assigned to desk duties filing paperwork instead of working in the field. One night while alone in the office, the telephone rings, informing her of the location of the criminal organization known as [[Zodiac (Earth-199999)|Zodiac]]. She goes to the Zodiac base, takes out the Zodiac members single handed and is able to retrieve the serum/virus.

After the mission, Agent Flynn reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures. However the telephone rings, this time with [[Howard Stark (Earth-199999)|Howard Stark]] on the other end. Stark informs Agent Flynn that Agent Carter will co-head the newly created [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-199999)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and that Agent Flynn must personally assist Agent Carter packing her belongings.

After the call [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-199999)|Dum Dum Dugan]] is poolside with Howard Stark, marvelling at two women wearing the newly created bikinis. Dugan asks Stark if he created them, to which Stark replies, "the French".
