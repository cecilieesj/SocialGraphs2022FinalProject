==Changes==
*In the 2000 VHS release, the woman said "TV" instead of "television".
*Also in this version and the original 1996 version, the text below the "GREGORY SILLS" name read "ENTERTAINMENT".
*On the 2000 re-release to VHS, the television was a rainbow for its first appearance.
*In the 2000 VHS release, when the sun comes out at the start of the video, it is embossed to negative.

==Trivia==
*This was the second live action sing along to not take place at Disneyland, the first one being [[Let's Go to the Circus!|Mickey's Fun Songs Let's Go to the Circus!]]
*The "Following the Leader" segment actually used a recording of the version in "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Disneyland Fun|Disneyland Fun]]" which censored any references to the Native Americans, owing to the racial controversy in the lyrics ''"We're off to fight the Injuns, the Injuns, the Injuns..."'' from said musical number.
*The only volume without sing-along words on the screen, though it is Closed Captioned (CC) for hearing impaired (as are most volumes), and sing-along lyrics have been added to the 1997 British VHS release and appear in the 2006 DVD release (though still incomplete).
*On the 1998 laserdisc release, the title card is missing.
*In this song-along video, [[Nanny]] appears as a tall, slender young woman instead of a plump elderly woman as in her other appearances, including the [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|''101 Dalmatians'' live-action remake]] this sing-along video is promoting at the time.
