==Trivia==
*It is a common misconception that Sadie refers to Ortensia, but this has never been proven. 
*This is the only time that the name "Sadie" was actually used in the title of a short.
*When story sketches were discovered, it was found that the simulated pencil test's opening with Oswald and Sadie riding together was actually the short's ending.
*The gag of Oswald stuffing his horse full of hay to allow a loose saddle strap to properly fit would be recycled for [[Steamboat Willie]].
