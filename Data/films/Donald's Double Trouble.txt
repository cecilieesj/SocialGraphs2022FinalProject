==Synopsis==
Donald hires a look-alike with more gentlemanly manners to win back the heart of Daisy after an argument, which eventually backfires when Donald starts getting jealous over the fact that Daisy prefers his look-alike over the real Donald.

==Characters==
*[[Donald Duck]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
*[[Daisy Duck]] (voiced by [[Gloria Blondell]])
*[[Dapper Duck]] (voiced by Leslie Denison)

==Trivia==
*Running gag: Every time Daisy kisses the Donald imposter, it is accompanied by a ringing alarm sound.
*This is the first cartoon where Donald's usual blue sailor shirt appears without four white buttons on it, which would continue to be seen in future appearances.
**However, the buttons are still shown sometimes.
*Dapper Duck went unnamed until 2018, when he briefly returned in an episode of ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''.
