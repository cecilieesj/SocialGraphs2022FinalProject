'''''The Jennie Project''''' is a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] that was released in the summer of [[2001]]. The film was based on the book ''Jennie'' by Douglas Preston. The movie is about a chimpanzee who knows and uses American Sign Language to communicate.

==Plot==
Hugo Archibald (Lance Guest) is a doctor and brings home a wide variety of exotic animal species. The latest animal he brings home is a [[chimpanzee]] named Jennie. Dr. Archibald is not home very much, and Andrew feels he does not care about him. And Lea (Sheila Kelley) his wife does not want Jennie, and says she makes trouble. But the children take an instant liking to her. Jennie is unique in that she is learning to use and understand sign language. Jennie becomes an important part of Archibald family and Dr. Archibald's son, Andrew (Alex D. Linz) develops a close relationship with her. Jennie loves the things Andrew does, such as baseball and comic books. Jennie is also there for Andrew when he and his father disagree. A doctor Pamela Prentiss ([[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]) starts training with Jennie. She does not agree with the way Jennie is being cared for, and is seen as being rude to the Archibald family. She teaches Jennie sign language in a way that Jennie does not understand, but Lea finds a way she understands. Dr. Prentiss tried to convince Hugo to admit Jennie in the science lab where she works, but Hugo declines. But when Jennie starts making trouble, such as taking all the mail from the mailman, and eating the neighbors tulips, she is taken to court and admitted into a science lab. But then they decide to return Jennie to Africa, where she was found. The relationship between Jennie and Andrew eventually brings the whole family closer together.
