'''''Mickey's Safety Club: Halloween Surprises''''' is part of ''[[Mickey's Safety Club]]'', a series of educational films, released in [[1990]]. [[Mickey Mouse]]'s clubhouse members learn about Halloween safety rules.

== Plot ==
Beth Simpson is anxiously waiting for her dad to come home from work so she and her parents can go trick-or-treating.  While she's waiting, she turns on the TV where there's a reminder from [[:en:DuckTales|DuckTales]] to have a safe Halloween.  Beth falls asleep in the middle of it and hears an announcement that Mickey's Safety Club is coming up next, "with special guest, Beth Simpson."  

She wakes up in Mickey's Safety Club where's she's greeted by Mickey.  Beth asks why she's been brought to the clubhouse.  Mickey explains that she's their Halloween Expert.  An antagonizing force, The Ghost of Halloween, intervenes saying, "You? An expert on Halloween?!" insisting he's the Halloween expert, "It's my night to howl."  Mickey replies by saying that Beth is their Halloween Expert, "She's going to show us how to trick-or-treat." The Ghost then transforms the clubhouse into a spooky atmosphere.

They then find a costume trunk where Beth explains the first thing to do: put on costumes.  She and Mickey go through the costumes until Beth points out that the costumes aren't right for them because they're too big.  Beth then explains that, if you wear costumes that are too big, you'd have a hard time walking and risk hurting yourself.  [[:en:Madam_Mim|Madam Mim]] shows her support for the rule, "You tell him, Beth." and advises that, when given the choice between a mask or make-up, it's best to choose make-up since you can't see out of a mask.  When The Ghost points out that masks make everything look dark and scary, Mim tells him, "Silly, silly.  That's why masks are dangerous." 

Beth then provides her and Mickey with costumes that do fit.

The angered ghost gives Beth and Mickey another scenario and the lights go out.  Beth turns on a flashlight and shares the related rule: always take a flashlight with you so you can see in the dark.  The Ghost then shows them a skeleton covered in reflective tape.  Beth then realizes that that was what they forgot on their costumes: reflective tape, so that others and drivers could see them in the dark.  Then she provides their costumes with reflective tape.

The Ghost of Halloween then gives Beth another riddle. A knock is heard at the door.  A frightened Mickey and Beth wonder what it is.  The Ghost mockingly tells Beth, "Why don't you open it and find out?" Beth comes over, but before she can open the door, two people dressed as pirates burst through and duel to Beth and Mickey's horror.  One supposedly kills the other.  Mickey and Beth nervously step over to the attacked pirate. Mickey asks Beth, "Gee Beth, do you think he's okay?"  The supposed dead pirate winks at them.  Beth finds the sword stuck between his armpit and finds it's not a real sword and shares the rule that swords should always be made of stuff that can't hurt you.  The opposing pirate comments, "Sounds like an expert to me."  The Ghost then sends them away and tells Mickey and Beth, "It's clear I'm going to have to take you on all by myself."

He tells them he'll send them outside for the next challenge.  Beth tells him that it's her dream and she decided they were staying.  The Ghost challenges this by causing them to go out leaving them with, "You're standing on a street corner.  There's traffic everywhere.  Let's just see you try and get to the other side."  Beth easily counters it by revealing what to do is to cross the way you would ordinarily cross the street: wait for the signal to turn green, look both ways, hold hands, and cross in the crosswalk.  The Ghost then brings them back to the clubhouse.

As a final test, The Ghost pretends to give up and admit that Beth is the true Halloween Expert and that he was now left with no one to scare.  Mickey suggests they bring back treats for him and Beth asks what kind of treats he likes.  The Ghost replies, "Well, I have this friend over on Magic Mirror Lane who gives out delicious apples." Beth finds it's another test concerning accepting a treat not in its own package.  Beth reminds them that it's not safe to eat a treat that's not in its own package and her mom always checks her treats before Beth eats them, "With all kinds of ghouls and goblins, you can never be too careful."

The Ghost then officially gives up and ends it with a message from The Goblin summarizing Halloween safety rules, "Don't go out alone on Halloween night.  Don't go out to homes without a light.  Play it safe, go in groups, go places known to you, and this will help you have a special time."

Beth then is awoken by her mom, dressed as Minnie Mouse, who tells her it's time to go trick-or-treating.  Her mom tells her she'll meet her in the front hall and asks what's on Beth's costume shirt.  Beth looks and finds a badge dubbing her as an official member of Mickey's Safety Club.  The Ghost then asks, "Mind if I come along?"
