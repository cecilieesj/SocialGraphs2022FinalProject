'''''A Dairy Tale: The Three Little Pigs''''' (or simply '''''A Dairy Tale''''') is an animated short released exclusively for the DVD releases of the [[2004]] Disney animated film, ''[[Home on the Range]]'', serving as the film's spin-off.

==Plot==
[[Mrs. Calloway]] is telling a story about the Three Little Pigs who lived in three houses to which [[Maggie]], [[Jeb]], and [[Grace]] keep interrupting. Asking about where a fourth pig is, Mrs. Calloway rejects [[Ollie]], the pig wanting to star in the story. Continuing the story, she narrates that the Three Pigs are about to face is a Big Bad Wolf living near the woods to which [[Buck]] interrupts, allowing Calloway to add Buck in the story. Continuing the story, [[Audrey (Home on the Range)|Audrey]], Maggie, Grace, and Buck interrupt the story by using imaginary plots, causing Mrs. Calloway to be enraged at the animals for ruining the story with all the nonsense they started thinking of. The [[Piggies]], however, interrupt her conversation, telling her that the story is awesome. She then tells them that classic stories she tells can be mixed with a twist. The short then ends when Mrs. Calloway tells the story of Jack and the Beanstalk to the Piggies.
