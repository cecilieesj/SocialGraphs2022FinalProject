'''''Frozen II''''' is an animated musical comedy-drama/fantasy film produced at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. Released on [[November 22]], [[2019]], it is the sequel to the [[2013]] film ''[[Frozen]]'', and it is the 58th animated feature in the [[Disney Animated Canon]].

Taking place three years after the events of the first film,<ref name="comic" /> ''Frozen II'' follows [[Elsa]], [[Anna]], [[Olaf]], [[Kristoff]], and [[Sven]] as they journey to an [[The Enchanted Forest|enchanted forest]] to save their kingdom from a curse involving the elemental spirits of [[The Nokk|water]], [[Gale|wind]], [[Bruni|fire]], and [[Earth Giants|earth]].

Co-directors [[Jennifer Lee]] and [[Chris Buck]] returned to helm the project, alongside producer [[Peter Del Vecho]]. While still retaining much of the humor of its predecessor, the film is notably darker in tone, with a heavier focus on action, death, and intense imagery. This was a deliberate move by the filmmakers, who likened the tone of ''Frozen II'' to earlier [[Walt Disney]]-era fairytales such as ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8849906/how-scary-is-frozen-2-sequel-plot-interviews|title=Why Adults Might Have A Tougher Time With Frozen II‘s Darker Moments|website=Refinery29|accessdate=November 22, 2019}}</ref>

Upon release, ''Frozen II'' received generally positive reviews from critics for its animation, voice performances, and music by songwriting duo [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] and [[Robert Lopez]].<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes" /> On its opening weekend, the film grossed $127 million domestically, and $350 million worldwide, making it the highest-opening of all time for an animated film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/24/frozen-2-breaks-box-office-records-with-350-million-worldwide-debut/#68c49a3b70d8|title=‘Frozen 2’ Breaks Box Office Records With $350 Million Worldwide Debut|website=Forbes|accessdate=November 25, 2019}}</ref> The film went on to surpass the original ''Frozen'' to become the highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film, and the highest-grossing animated film of all time, according to Disney and industry insiders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/box-office/frozen-2-biggest-animated-movie-ever-disney-box-office-1203456758/|title=‘Frozen 2’ Is Now the Highest-Grossing Animated Movie Ever|website=Variety|accessdate=January 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>This is debatable, as Disney's own 2019 ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'' remake grossed more than ''Frozen II'', but Disney does not consider ''The Lion King'' to be an animated film.</ref>

==Synopsis==
Elsa, the Snow Queen, has an extraordinary gift -- the power to create ice and snow. But no matter how happy she is to be surrounded by the people of Arendelle, Elsa finds herself strangely unsettled. After hearing a mysterious voice call out to her, Elsa travels to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond her kingdom -- an adventure that soon turns into a journey of self-discovery.

==Plot==
Inside one of the rooms of [[Arendelle Castle]] one evening, young [[Anna]] and [[Elsa]] have built a forest out of snow and ice, sourced from Elsa's ice powers. As she conjures small snow people to play with, [[King Agnarr]] and [[Queen Iduna]] enter, telling the girls that it is time for them to go to bed. Seeing that Anna and Elsa are happily playing together, the king and queen smile, then take the girls to their bedroom. There, the sisters beg their father to tell them a bedtime story. King Agnarr agrees and begins the tale of an enchanted forest: [[King Runeard]], the founder and first king of [[Arendelle]], establishes a treaty with the woodland [[Northuldra]] tribe, building a [[Runeard's Dam|dam]] between Arendelle and [[the Enchanted Forest]], home of the Northuldra. However, a fight between the two armies occurs, killing Runeard and many of his men. The four elemental spirits were [[Earth Giants|earth]], [[Bruni|fire]], [[Gale|air]], and [[The Nokk|water]], which inhabit the forest, become enraged due to the fight. The spirits disappear, and a thick wall of mist encases everyone in the forest. No one is able to enter or leave, and the contents of the forest become preserved in time. Runeard's son Prince Agnarr barely escapes with the help of an unknown savior. After the story, Queen Iduna tucks the girls into bed, singing them [[All Is Found|an old lullaby]] taught to her by her mother.

Three years after her coronation, Queen Elsa of Arendelle stands on the castle balcony, returning from her flashback to the present. [[Kai (Frozen)|Kai]] comes to retrieve her, startling her as she didn't see him coming as she was too lost in her thoughts to notice, causing her to make a sudden shoot of frost to stick her hands to the railing before she pulls them loose. After tending to her royal duties, she goes to the town square to celebrate autumn in the kingdom with her younger sister, Princess Anna, [[Olaf]], their talking snowman, [[Kristoff]], Arendelle's resident ice harvester, and [[Sven]], Kristoff's pet reindeer and best friend, and they sing "[[Some Things Never Change]]".

That same evening, Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf play a game of charades. After having some fun with her sister and friends, Elsa decides to go to bed early. Later, Anna enters Elsa's room, concerned. She notices that Elsa is wearing their mother's shawl, which she only wears when nervous or troubled. Anna and Elsa talk for some time, and eventually, huddled together, they fall asleep.

Suddenly, in the middle of the night, Elsa wakes up when she hears the mysterious voice calling to her again. Unable to ignore it this time, Elsa tries to follow the voice "[[Into the Unknown]]", but unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, forcing everyone in the kingdom to evacuate as many of Arendelle's resources are stripped from the kingdom: The waterfall dries up, as do the fountains, the flames providing light in buildings and the street lamps are extinguished, the wind becomes fierce, and the streets are disrupted like something is burrowing beneath them and disturbing the earth underneath. [[Grand Pabbie]], the leader of the [[trolls (Frozen)|trolls]], senses danger and arrives in Arendelle with the rest of the trolls. Pabbie informs Anna and Elsa that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past, or he foresees no future for Arendelle. Deducing she must follow the voice she has been hearing, Elsa tries to tell her sister that she must go alone, but Anna insists upon coming with her. As Elsa tries to reason with her sister, Anna says she went through many odds three years ago such as climbing the North Mountain, surviving a frozen heart, and saving Elsa from the evil Hans, which in Anna's opinion, is the reason why she's going. Elsa had asked to borrow Kristoff's wagon and Sven, which he did not feel comfortable with. After Anna states that she is coming, Kristoff agrees, insisting on driving. Olaf agrees, adding, "''I'll bring the snacks!''" Pabbie promises to look after the people of Arendelle in the meantime until the royal sisters return from pacifying the elemental spirits and restoring Arendelle's resources once the spirits are no longer angry for the previous transgression against them. However, Pabbie speaks to Anna in private, voicing his concern about how they always feared Elsa's powers were too much for the world, but now, they are praying they are enough to help save Arendelle. Understanding the meaning of his words, Anna promises to look after Elsa and keep her safe, swearing "I won't let anything happen to her."

Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark on their journey to the Enchanted Forest, traveling via Kristoff's wagon. They pass landmarks from the first film, such as [[Elsa's Ice Palace|Elsa's ice palace]]. Olaf also talks all through the journey there and believes that this will all make sense "[[When I Am Older]]". Finally arriving at the entrance to the Enchanted Forest, the group encounters the impenetrable wall of mist, but it parts open as Elsa uses her magic, before closing again once they are inside. The group first encounters [[Gale]], the wind spirit, which appears in the form of a tornado and sweeps everyone into its vortex. Elsa stops it by blasting streams of snow, forming a set of ice sculptures. They discover the sculptures are from their father's past and that their mother, Iduna, was the mysterious Northuldra who saved Agnarr's life during the battle between King Runeard and his soldiers and the Northuldra fighters. They encounter the Northuldra, along with a troop of Arendellian soldiers, as the two groups are still in conflict with each other. The fire spirit appears and Elsa attempts to stop its fire from spreading. Elsa discovers that the spirit is in the form of an agitated magical salamander named [[Bruni]]. She calms it down by placing it in her palm and creating a small snow flurry, ceasing its flames. Elsa and Anna form a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra, explaining that their mother was Northuldra and their father was Agnarr, the prince of Arendelle. An Arendellian soldier named [[Lieutenant Mattias]] is impressed, recalling memories of the young prince. Later, at the Northuldra camp, the group encounters two young Northuldra siblings named [[Honeymaren]] and [[Ryder Nattura|Ryder]]. Elsa talks to Honeymaren, learning that Queen Iduna's [[Iduna's Scarf|shawl]] is decorated with a traditional Northuldra pattern. Anna talks with Lieutenant Mattias, Olaf is rearranged by a group of Northuldra children, and Kristoff talks with Ryder, who also loves reindeer. Elsa later learns from Honeymaren of the existence of a fifth spirit, which will unite people and the magic of nature. Everyone is soon forced to take cover and hide from the elemental spirits of earth, the [[Earth Giants]], when they stomp pass the Northuldra encampment without seeing anyone.

Elsa continues to head north with Anna and Olaf, while Kristoff and Sven stay behind with Ryder and the rest of the Northuldra. Kristoff tries to propose to Anna, not realizing that she is gone, but instead finds the leader of the Northuldra tribe, [[Yelana]], who lets him know where Anna and Elsa went before revealing that the Northuldra are packing up camp to move elsewhere, possibly to get away from the Earth Giants so they won't be threatened by them. Meanwhile, the sisters find their parents' shipwreck after being guided to it by Gale, and a map with a route to [[Ahtohallan]], the mythical river said to have answers and explanations about the past. Ahtohallan was the "river full of memory" that was mentioned in Queen Iduna's lullaby, which Elsa learned was a traditional Northuldra song, and reinforcing what Olaf said earlier about water having memory. The sisters find an ice sculpture of their parents huddled together that Elsa makes from the water still embedded in the ship's hull, apparently about to meet their fate at the hands of the Dark Sea. Elsa and Anna begin to cry. Feeling extremely guilty that their parents were lost at sea in search of answers about her magic powers, Elsa decides to travel alone, sending Anna and Olaf away in an ice-boat where they have to avoid the now sleeping Earth Giants, ignoring Anna's warnings since Anna promised Pabbie she would look out for and protect Elsa, and reminder of their mother's song "Go too far and you'll be drowned". Anna and Olaf become stranded in a dark, mysterious cavern.

With Anna and Olaf safe as far as she knows, Elsa encounters [[the Nokk]], the water spirit who guards the ocean in the form of a glistening stallion, on her way to Ahtohallan. After a fierce fight with the Nokk trying to drown her before reaching Ahtohallan, Elsa tames the Nokk and finally reaches Ahtohallan. Elsa discovers that the voice was the call of Iduna from memories of the past, as an image of her singing her mysterious call to an unconscious Agnarr after saving him flashes onto the wall. Elsa discovers that her power was a gift from the magic of nature, due to Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr when the Northuldra and Arendellians starting fighting and the elemental spirits turned against humanity. This makes Elsa the fifth spirit, a bridge between humans and nature, who unites differences. Elsa wields her mother's mantle of the fifth spirit and asks the voice to "[[Show Yourself]]". She also learns through flashbacks and memories that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources, due to Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic, believing it gives them a reason to defy royalty like himself, much to Elsa's chagrin as she realizes Runeard let his fear control his actions, while she learned fear is what can't be trusted. Elsa learns that King Runeard, although depicted as good, was the one who initiated the conflict with the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna. However, as she had ventured into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan and ignored her mother's warnings, Elsa becomes frozen herself, turning to solid ice in a more slow, painful version of what happened to Anna under the frozen heart curse, entombing her in Ahtohallan as her grave as she sends the truth to Anna before taking her last breath. Olaf, being made of Elsa's now-defunct magic, fades away and becomes a pile of snow. Anna is left devastated and alone by the loss of her sister and Olaf. She feels that her life is over and that she must give up, but she convinces herself to do "[[The Next Right Thing]]" and continue.

Anna concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored, even if it means Arendelle's destruction in the process. She escapes from the cavern and awakens the sleeping [[Earth Giants]], who immediately turn hostile on her for being disturbed. Anna lures them towards the dam with help from Kristoff, Sven, and Lieutenant Mattias with his Royal Guard detachment, which is destroyed by boulders hurled by the giants. This causes them to become docile as the bane of their rage had been destroyed. Back in Ahtohallan, with the dam destroyed, Elsa is restored to flesh and blood and returns to Arendelle, stopping a flood from the destroyed dam with Nokk, witnessed by the people, Grand Pabbie, and his rock trolls, who cheer for Elsa and Nokk while Pabbie gives Elsa a respectful nod for her triumph. As the wall of mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, to the delight of everyone. Kristoff finally, properly, proposes to Anna, and she accepts. Elsa points out that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits, just like their mother had two daughters. As the Enchanted Forest and Arendelle are now open and connected to each other, Elsa decides that she is meant to live in the forest with the Northuldra, being the fifth spirit. Anna becomes the new Queen of Arendelle with Elsa's abdication, and Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest. She regularly visits Arendelle as peace is restored in all the lands. Anna and Kristoff enjoy time together after Anna's coronation and first royal event. Olaf and Sven eagerly explore Arendelle. Lieutenant Mattias, now promoted to General under Anna, is seen together with an Arendellian woman he mentioned back at the Northuldra camp, now reunited with her, as she shows him a "new invention" called a photograph. Together with Anna, he unveils a new statue of a younger Agnarr and Iduna to honor their memory and the new unity between Arendelle and the Enchanted Forest. Anna has Gale send a message to Elsa, and shortly after reading it, Elsa takes a ride on the Nokk towards Ahtohallan, while passing by Ryder, Honeymaren, and the other elemental spirits.

In a post-credit scene, Olaf retells the story to [[Marshmallow]] and the [[Snowgies]].

==Development==
Development on a theatrical ''Frozen'' sequel was officially announced at a Disney Shareholder meeting,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://disneyanimation.tumblr.com/post/113439921915/its-of-f-f-f-f-icial-frozen-2-is-in|title=It’s of-f-f-f-f-icial: 'Frozen 2' is in development at Walt Disney Animation Studios|publisher=Tumblr|date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> alongside being confirmed by [[Jennifer Lee]] on her Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/alittlejelee/status/576078755015200769|title=At last, I can say – FROZEN 2!!!!

The filmmakers had not originally considered making a sequel to ''Frozen'' at all and the road to its creation was bumpy. Co-director Chris Buck began by considering that what would be next for Elsa, having been in hiding for so long and finally being accepted by her people. One question the filmmakers were repeatedly asked was the question of why Elsa has her powers, which led them to explore this question for the sequel.<ref name="Gizmodo">{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/deciding-to-make-frozen-ii-was-much-more-complicated-th-1838021422|title=Deciding to Make ''Frozen II'' Was Much More Complicated Than You'd Expect|first=Germain|last=Lussier|date=September 30, 2019|accessdate=November 10, 2019|publisher=Gizmodo}}</ref> As part of the production process, the filmmakers took part in a four-hour psychological personality test, assuming the roles of the characters and answering questions posed by an actual psychologist. In doing so, they discovered that Anna was a "fairy tale" character, optimistic, and human, while Elsa was a "mythic" character, with the weight of the world on her shoulders and special powers. The film's visual developers worked on special finishing touches to the characters' outfits, including lining inside the fabric of every character's clothes.<ref name="D23 Hidden Gems">{{Cite web|url=https://d23.com/frozen-2s-hidden-gems-showcase-filmmakers-attention-to-detail/|title=''Frozen 2''’s Hidden Gems Showcase Filmmakers’ Attention to Detail|first=William|last=Keck|date=November 5, 2019|accessdate=November 7, 2019|publisher=D23}}</ref> Both Elsa and Anna wear pants when traveling into [[the Enchanted Forest]], Jennifer Lee stating that they wear what's right for the situation and she loves that they can wear anything.<ref name="Pants">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/frozen-2-why-elsa-anna-wear-pants/|title=Why Elsa and Anna Get to Wear Pants in ‘Frozen 2’|first=Jennifer|last=Maas|date=November 9, 2019|accessdate=November 10, 2019|publisher=The Wrap}}</ref> The film is said to be "darker" than the original ''Frozen'' and Kristen Bell stated that "''we don’t give kids enough credit because they’re projections of us and we want them to be happy because we want ourselves to be happy all the time. We don’t give them enough credit for their ability to digest complex situations and trauma and struggle.''"<ref name="Darker">{{Cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2019/11/frozen-2-darker-disney-sequel-ba1/|title=“Frozen 2” is a darker Disney sequel – Kristen Bell says it’s a good thing|date=November 9, 2019|accessdate=November 10, 2019|first=Bailee|last=Abell|publisher=Inside the Magic}}</ref>

Following concerns about cultural appropriation regarding the original ''Frozen'', Disney signed a contract with the Sámi people to respectfully portray Sámi culture. As the culture was to feature in an even greater role in ''Frozen II'', the Sámi parliaments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, along with the Saami Council reached out to collaborate with the film's producers. The contract also included an agreement that Disney would produce a dubbed version of ''Frozen II'' in one Sámi language and participate in cross-learning initiatives that contribute to Indigenous communities in Scandinavia.<ref name="Sami">{{Cite web|title=Disney signed a contract with Indigenous people before making Frozen II|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/disney-frozen-2-indigenous-culture-sami/|first=Radheyan|last=Simonpillai|date=November 19, 2019|accessdate=November 21, 2019|publisher=Now Toronto}}</ref> The Sámi people and those working with the filmmakers appear in the film's credits.

On [[April 25]], [[2017]], the official release date for the ''Frozen'' sequel was announced by Disney.<ref name="TheStreet">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/14102696/1/disney-s-frozen-2-coming-november-2019.html|title=Disney's ''Frozen 2'' Coming In November 2019|website=TheStreet|date=April 25, 2017}}</ref> On [[September 28]], Josh Gad and Disney announced on social media that recording for the film had officially begun.<ref name="cast">{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/frozen-2-cast-starts-recording/|title=‘Frozen 2’ Cast Starts Recording with Josh Gad Returning as Olaf|website=Collider|date=September 28, 2017}}</ref>

In [[2018]], Jennifer Lee was the appointed replacement for [[John Lasseter]] following his discharge from [[The Walt Disney Company]]. With her attention now focused on several facets of the studio, writer Allison Schroeder was brought on to co-write the script for ''Frozen 2''. On [[November 1]], it was announced that the ''Frozen'' sequel had been pushed up a few days from [[November 27]], 2019, to November 22, 2019. On [[February 13]], [[2019]], the film was retitled as ''Frozen II''.

==Trivia==
*This is the second [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film to feature 12 minutes of end credits, after ''[[Zootopia]]''.
*This is the first Walt Disney Animation Studios sequel in the Disney Animated Features canon to focus on the secondary character (in this case it being [[Elsa]]) rather than the protagonist of the original film, thus promoting Elsa as the primary female character.
*This is, to date, the only film in the Disney Animated Feature canon where the central antagonist dies before the events of the movie take place, and the closest a film of the canon has come to have a film without a villain.
*This is the sixth sequel in the Disney Animated Features canon, after ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'', ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'',
*This is the last Walt Disney Animation Studios film to use the [[1967]] MPAA logo. It is also the last theatrical Disney film to do so; the next Disney-distributed theatrical films would start using the 2019 MPA logo in the end credits beginning with ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', while further theatrical [[Walt Disney Pictures]] films would start doing so with [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Onward]]''.
**In addition, it is the last theatrical animated feature film in history to include the 1967 MPAA logo in the end credits; as further theatrical animated feature films would start using the 2019 MPA logo beginning with the North American release of ''{{WikipediaLink|Playmobil: The Movie}}''.
**However, further [[Disney+]] original films (with the exception of ''[[Artemis Fowl]]'' and ''[[Hamilton]]'', both of which started using the 2019 MPA logo) would continue to use the 1967 MPAA logo until ''[[Magic Camp]]''. In fact, further Disney+ original films from ''[[The One and Only Ivan]]'' onwards would be using the 2019 MPA logo.
*This is the fifth Disney animated theatrical sequel to be rated PG by the MPAA, after ''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', and ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.
*This is the second Walt Disney Animation Studios film to feature the full [[2011]] logo as a closing logo, after ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]''.
*This is the last Walt Disney Animation Studios film with [[John Lasseter]]'s involvement before he left his position from Disney and Pixar animation at the end of [[2018]] and therefore making it the first to be released under Jennifer Lee's supervision.
*This is the eighth Disney animated film to feature the full [[2011]] logo as a closing logo after ''[[Finding Dory]]'', ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]'', ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''; the next being ''[[Soul]]''.
*This is the eighth Walt Disney Animation Studios film to include a post-credits scene after ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Brother Bear]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'', ''[[Frozen]]'', ''[[Big Hero 6]]'', ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'', and ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.
*This is also the first Walt Disney Animation Studios film since ''[[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' in 2011 not to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.
*The film takes place three years after the events of ''Frozen''.<ref name="comic">{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/frozen-2-time-jump-new-footage-disney/|title=Frozen 2 to Have 3-Year Time Jump, New Scene Details Revealed|date=June 14, 2019|author=Ridgely, Charlie|website=Comicbook.com}}</ref>
**Elsa is 24 years old and Anna is 21 years old.
**The film also takes place 2 years after ''[[Frozen Fever]]'', which shows Anna's 19th birthday.
*''Frozen II'' was originally set to be released sometime after the film ''[[Gigantic]]'', which was later canceled.
*The teaser trailer became the most viewed animation trailer of all time, with a record-breaking 116.4 million views in 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/DisneyFrozen/status/1096138948684918784|title=Disney's Frozen 2 post|website=Twitter|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>
*Anna's voice actress - [[Kristen Bell]] - spoiled the entire plot of the film to her two daughters, only realizing afterward that it placed her in breach of contract and she could potentially be sued by Disney. She then told her girls that if they revealed any information, their teeth would fall out.<ref name="Spoiled">{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephenlaconte/kristen-bell-frozen-2-spoilers-kids-teeth-fall-out|title=Kristen Bell Was Worried Disney Would Sue Her After She Told Her Kids "Frozen 2" Spoilers|first=Stephen|last=LaConte|date=November 14, 2019|accessdate=November 15, 2019|publisher=Buzzfeed}}</ref>
*''People'' magazine released a special ''Frozen II'' issue filled with secrets from the film, including the signing of a contract with real-life Norwegians.<ref name="People">{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/movies/frozen-2-secrets-revealed-in-peoples-special-edition-magazine-all-about-the-issue/|title=''Frozen 2'' Secrets Revealed in PEOPLE's Special Edition Magazine: All About the Issue|first=Saleah|last=Blancaflor|date=November 21, 2019|accessdate=November 22, 2019|publisher=''People''}}</ref>
*When Olaf recounts the events of ''Frozen'', several of [[Christophe Beck]]’s musical cues from the film were reprised.
*The scenery and color schemes in ''Frozen II'' were greatly inspired by the traditional hand-drawn animated classic, ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. There are some parallels between [[the Enchanted Forest]] in this film and the ethereal backgrounds that artist [[Eyvind Earle]] painted for the [[1959]] animated classic. According to animator Justin Sklar, the filmmakers were drawn by the organization and graphics of the imagery in ''Sleeping Beauty''.
*Kristoff's actions of proposing to [[Anna]] are similar to that of [[Bernard (The Rescuers)|Bernard]] from [[The Rescuers Down Under]] when proposing to [[Miss Bianca]]. Both get interrupted constantly throughout the films trying to propose to their girlfriends and finally succeed towards the films' endings.
*During a flashback into Agnarr and Iduna's childhood, Agnarr is reading a book that he states is from a "new Danish author". This is a reference to [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the writer of ''The Snow Queen'', the fairy tale by which ''Frozen'' was inspired.
*Despite Elsa being the main protagonist, she isn't listed on top of the credits. Instead, it's still Anna.
*Some of the scenes from the trailers didn’t end up in the film, such as Elsa protecting Olaf from the flames.
*During the post-credits scene, [[Elsa's Tiara|Elsa's coronation tiara]] is shown on Marshmallow's head.
*''Frozen II'' shares many similarities with the ''Frozen'' arc of ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''. Both act as sequels to the first film, Anna and Kristoff are engaged, both involve venturing into an Enchanted Forest, both reveal that the reason for the King and Queen's voyage was due to Elsa's powers, both explore the Queen of Arendelle, in her youth and both have Anna and Elsa find preserved memories of their mother.
**It is unknown if the directors made the film similar to the show on purpose.
*According to Jennifer Lee in a Q & A session:
**The prologue of the sequel took place on the same night of the accident in the first film.
**Elsa is still human despite becoming the Fifth Spirit, putting to rest the theories on Elsa being immortal in which fans had speculated.
**The sequel served as the end of the franchise as it served the end of the character arcs of Anna and Elsa.
***In addition to this, both Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck mentioned in an interview that with the sequel, they have told the complete story of the franchise.
*There are a few continuity goofs.
**In the library in the first film, Agnarr's portrait is closest to the door and the portraits of Runeard and Mattias are not there.
**Elsa is somehow aware of Olaf's death despite the fact she wasn't there to witness his death.
**Elsa freezes to death despite the facts her line "The cold never bothered me anyway." from Let it Go and that Ahtohallan is the source of her magic.
**During "Into the Unknown", the clock shows midnight when Elsa answers the call of Ahtohallan, despite claims by songwriters Robert and Kristen Anderson Lopez that Elsa sang it at 3 a.m. that night during the interview.
**A map in the ship shows the dam's path has two openings one taking to Arendelle and the other to sea however it still takes the path to Arendelle if there are no two paths during "Into The Unknown" after Elsa said the title 3 times the shot shows there is no canyon big enough for the flood.
*This is the first Disney film to feature a non-cinematic main menu and an unnamed scene index for its home media releases.
*This is the second ''Frozen'' story to be released in 2019 the first being ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'' where the story was based on the first film.
*This is the darkest sequel in the Disney Animated Canon to date as it deals with mature, dark and realistic topics such as homicide, xenophobia, depression, indoctrination, mental abuse, mental health as well as colonization.
*This is the first Disney film to stream on [[Disney+]] about three weeks after its Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD releases (and one month after its digital release), due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
*This film shares many similarities with the first film.
**Elsa endangering Arendelle (in the first film, it's her powers; in the second film, she actually awakens the spirits).
**On the way to the forest, Kristoff and Anna sit next to each other in the front of the sled. The moment is somewhat similar to their first sled ride together.
**Elsa freezes similarly to how Anna froze in the first film.
**When they reunite, Elsa and Anna hold hands in a similar manner in the first film after Anna thawed.
*In contrast to its predecessor, the word "frozen" is only spoken twice in ''Frozen II''. The first time is when Anna argues with Elsa about the former going with the latter to the Enchanted Forest by saying, "Excuse me, I climbed the North Mountain, survived a ''frozen'' heart, and saved you from my ex-boyfriend." The second time is when Elsa and the Nokk come upon Ahtohallan, and she says, "Ahtohallan is ''frozen''."
*This was the last Disney animated feature film to be released theatrically before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
*Despite being the highest-grossing fully-animated film of all time, this film was not given an Academy Awards nomination for Best Animated Feature (unlike the first film). Instead, ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' won that nomination.

===Cameos and other Disney references===
*At the beginning of the movie, [[Snow White]], [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], [[Bolt (character)|Bolt]], and [[Baymax]] cameo as some of Elsa's snow dolls.
*During the charades game, Olaf shapes into [[Mickey Mouse]].
*During a flashback into Agnarr and Iduna's childhood, Agnarr is revealed to be reading ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' in which Ariel's pose from the teaser poster is shown on the book cover if one looks closely.
*During "When I Am Older", Olaf passes by a multitude of unknown hidden creatures staring at him with scary red eyes and sharp teeth before walking away quickly. This was a deliberate gag on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.
