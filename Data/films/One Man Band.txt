'''''One Man Band''''' is a [[2005]] [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] animated short film. The short was written and directed by Andrew Jimenez and [[Mark Andrews]] and produced by Osnat Shurer, head of Pixar's Shorts group. It was shown with the theatrical release of ''[[Cars]]''.

==Plot==
The story begins with a man, named [[Bass]], playing multiple brass and percussion instruments, and tries to get a little girl named [[Tippy]] to tip him a coin, but soon meets another musician, named [[Treble]] with orchestral woodwind and string instruments. They both instantly become rivals and fight over the girl's coin until she accidentally drops the coin, which falls into a drain. Tippy gets upset and is then angered by the two musicians causing her to lose it, and demands the two one-man-bands for a replacement coin, but they reveal that they are poor and broke. She takes one of the violins from the Treble, re-tuned it, and played an unexpected tune. A rich man, pleased by her performance, gives her a big bag of coins, and the girl eagerly picks it up. Before leaving, Tippy takes two coins for Bass and Treble and tosses them into the top of a fountain, where she was originally going to put her coin in for a wish. After the credits roll, the two musicians work together in an attempt at reaching the top, where the two coins remain.

==Trivia==
*The music during the credits is Pablo de Sarasate's ''[[wikipedia:Zigeunerweisen|Zigeunerweisen]]''.
*This is the first [[Pixar]] short film to be produced in a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, unlike the short films were produced in 1.85:1.
*This is the final original short by Pixar before it was bought by Disney in [[2006]].
