'''''Polar Trappers''''' is a 1938 animated short starring [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]].

==Synopsis==
The "Donald and Goofy Trapping Co." Donald tries to catch himself a penguin for supper while Goofy traps a walrus trying to "bring 'em back alive."

== Plot ==
The cartoon opens up with Donald preparing beans to eat. However, having living off beans for a long time causes Donald to become tired of eating the same food. After catching a glimpse of a penguin, Donald decides to have a roast penguin feast. He tries to catch one while disguising as a penguin and luring it with a fish but fails.

Meanwhile, Goofy attempts to capture a live walrus but runs into many mishaps, including getting bombarded with icicles after sneezing loudly.

The cartoon culminates with Donald leading a group of penguins with a musical piece via flute.

==Characters==
*[[Donald Duck]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
*[[Goofy]] (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]])
*Walrus (voiced by Pinto Colvig)
*Penguins
*Penguin Chick (crying sounds provided by [[Jimmy MacDonald]])

==Trivia==
* It was the first cartoon where Donald and Goofy appear without [[Mickey Mouse]].
* The tune that Donald plays on the piccolo to trap the penguins is "[[wikipedia:The Parade of the Tin Soldiers|The Parade of the Tin Soldiers]]".
** Also, the way Donald lures the penguins by playing the flute is a reference to the Pied Piper.

==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*Goofy setting up his walrus trap with a welcome mat.
*The entire first scene with Donald: him getting tired of eating beans and his initial attempt at capturing a female penguin with a penguin disguise and a Spiffany fish, as well as all scenes of him trying to kill her with an ax.
*Much of the scene with the falling icicles, notably Goofy trying to test the sound with a pin, resulting in one giant icicle hitting him on the head so that his rear gets stuck in the ice.
*Donald expressing excitement at the whole penguin colony and how they will sate his hunger.
*The majority of Donald's penguin parade, most notably all scenes involving Donald trying to get rid of the penguin chick that gets in his way.
*The penguin chick, feeling rejected for not being in the parade, shedding a tear that forms into a giant snowball (in this short release, the snowball just happens out of nowhere).
*The penguins seeing the snowball coming and diving into the snow to safety, then popping their heads out of the snow after it passes.
*Donald using Goofy's skis to slide down the hill to outdistance the snowball and the former razzing the snowball.
