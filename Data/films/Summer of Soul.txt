==Synopsis==
The documentary examines the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which was held at Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) in Harlem and lasted for six weeks. Despite having a large attendance and performers, such as Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly and the Family Stone, the festival was seen as obscure in pop culture, something that the documentarians investigate.

==Production==
Footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival was shot and later placed in a basement, where it sat for about 50 years unpublished.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=Questlove's Summer of Soul Documentary Wins Sundance 2021 Grand Jury Prize|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/questloves-summer-of-soul-documentary-wins-sundance-2021-grand-jury-prize/|access-date=2021-02-05|website=Pitchfork|language=en-us}}</ref> Thompson expressed surprise that the footage sat for so long, as music had a large impact on his life and development, stating "What would have happened if this was allowed a seat at the table? How much of a difference would that have made in my life? That was the moment that extinguished any doubt I had that I could do this."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lindahl|first=Chris|date=2021-02-02|title=Questlove on Building 'Summer of Soul' Around Awe-Inspiring Musical Moments|url=https://www.indiewire.com/video/questlove-summer-of-soul-musical-performances-1234613828/|access-date=2021-02-05|website=IndieWire|language=en}}</ref>
