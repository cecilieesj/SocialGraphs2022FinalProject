==Plot==
Since winning the Wings Around the Globe Rally, [[Dusty Crophopper]] has a successful career as a racer. Unfortunately, his engine's gearbox becomes damaged due to too much over-revving. To make things worse, that type of gearbox is out of production, and none can be found anywhere, so he is unable to race again. Frustrated with mechanic [[Dottie (Planes)|Dottie]]'s newly installed warning light to keep his engine performance low to prevent further damage, Dusty goes on a defiant flight testing his limits. Unfortunately in doing so, he has a hard landing with engine trouble at [[Propwash Junction]]'s airport, causing a fire.

The residents put out the fire with some difficulty, but the accident leads to a government inspector named [[Ryker]] closing the airport due to inadequate firefighting personnel. Aggrieved at his carelessness, Dusty offers to undergo training to be certified as a firefighter to meet the necessary regulations to reopen the airport. To that end, Dusty travels to [[Piston Peak National Park]], where he meets a fire and rescue crew under the command of a helicopter named [[Blade Ranger]]. The leader of an efficient unit, Blade is initially unimpressed by the small newcomer, and Dusty's training proves to be a difficult challenge.

Dusty's original undercarriage is replaced by two big scooping water tanks with retractable undercarriage wheels on their undersides. During training, Dusty learns that Blade was formerly an actor who played a police helicopter on the TV series ''CHoPs''. Later, Dusty gets a call from his friends at Propwash Junction, noting that they found a replacement gearbox, which turned out to have a crate that was mislabeled, thus meaning he can no longer race.

Depressed that his racing career is over, Dusty's education falters to Blade's frustration, and things come to a head when Dusty makes a forced landing in a river during a fire dispatch and is swept through the rapids with Blade trying to extract him. Eventually, the pair make it to land as Blade starts to scold Dusty for not following orders. This argument reaches to a point where Dusty finally confesses his physical disability, to which Blade (who quietly understands why Dusty kept pulling power) advises Dusty not to give up. They shelter in an abandoned mine while a fire passes. The situation is complicated in that Blade is also damaged, from protecting Dusty in the fire, and is temporarily grounded for repairs. While Blade is recuperating, Dusty learns from Maru that Blade's [[Nick Loopin' Lopez|co-star]] from ''CHoPs'' was killed during a stunt gone wrong on set, in which he couldn't save him because he didn't know what to do, wherein he quit to save lives in reality.

Lightning in a thunderstorm over a forest near Piston Peak starts several spot fires which unite into a serious forest fire, and the team fight it and seem to have extinguished it. But during the grand reopening of a local lodge, visiting VIPs fly too low and make air eddies, which blow embers about, creating a larger fire. The national park's superintendent [[Cad Spinner]] selfishly diverts all the water supply to his lodge's roof sprinklers to prevent the lodge from burning and so prevents the firefighters from making fire retardant for their own duties. With only their pre-existing tank loads, the firefighters manage to help the evacuees escape the fire while Dusty is alerted that two elderly campers, named [[Harvey and Winnie]], are trapped on a burning bridge deep in the fire zone. He races to the scene and is forced to push his engine to the maximum to climb vertically up a waterfall to refill his water tanks to drop water to save the campers, as the only other surface water near is a river too shallow and twisty and rocky for him to scoop from. Meanwhile, Blade shows up and assists the campers. Dusty successfully drops water and extinguishes the fire, but his overstressed gearbox fails completely, and he crashes.

Unconscious, Dusty is airlifted back to base, where he wakes up five days later to learn that not only has his structure been fully repaired, but the base mechanic has built a superior custom refurbished gearbox for his engine to allow full performance again, which means he can race again. Impressed at Dusty's skill and heroism, Blade certifies him as a firefighter. Propwash Junction is reopened with Dusty assuming his duty as a firefighter, celebrated with an aerial show with his new colleagues from Piston Peak.

During the end credits, it is shown that Cad's misconduct resulted in him being demoted and reassigned as a park ranger in Death Valley.

==Production==
According to director/co-writer Roberts "Bobs" Gannaway, "The first film [directed by Klay Hall] was a race film. I wanted to look at a different genre, in this case, an action-disaster film." Production on ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'' began six months after the start of the previous film. "We’ve been working on this film for nearly four years." The filmmakers researched the world of air-attack teams and smokejumpers by working with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and sent a crew to the US Forest Services' annual training exercises for smokejumpers. Gannaway explained, "We actually hooked cameras onto their helmets and had them drop out of the airplane so we could catch it on film." Nearly a year of research was done before the filmmakers started work on the story. The idea of Dusty becoming a fire and rescue plane was based on reality. Gannaway stated that during their research, they discovered that in [[1955]], crop dusters were among the first planes to be used in aerial fire-fighting, "There was a group of crop dusters who reworked their planes so they could drop water." Gannaway also noted that in the first film "Dusty is doing things to his engine that should not be done to it—he is stressing the engine out and causing severe damage. It’s great that the first movie tied this up without intending to. We just built on it, and the results were remarkable." Producer Ferrell Barron stated "I think we’ve all experienced some kind of loss at some point in our lives—an end of an era, a lost love, a failed career. We’ve all had to recalibrate. In ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', Dusty can’t go back to being a crop duster, he left that behind. He has to move forward."<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/movies/first-clip-from-planes-fire-rescue-combines-89267525207.html?soc_src=mags First Clip from 'Planes: Fire & Rescue' Combines High-Flying Action With High-Energy Rock]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2014/07/15/meet-the-filmmakers-of-planes-fire-rescue/ Soaring to New Heights with the Filmmakers of Planes: Fire & Rescue]</ref>

A pre-release screening of the film was conducted at the 2014 National Native Media Conference, where screenwriter Jeffrey M. Howard and art director Toby Wilson joined actor Wes Studi in Q & A to discuss the Native American themes in the film. They noted that the character of Windlifter, and the folkloric story he tells of how Coyote was renewed by fire, was developed in consultation with Dr. Paul Apodaca, an expert on Native American myths and folklore.<ref>[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/14/winging-it-wes-studi-windlifter-planes-fire-and-rescue-155844 Winging It with Wes Studi]</ref>

===Critical response===
On the critical response aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 44% based on 87 reviews.

I love trains. And I started thinking about trains, and boats and airplanes. And I kept wanting to have more and more of those type of characters. [...] It’s one of the ideas, that there will be an ongoing series. It almost starts getting into this thing where we fall in love with these plane characters, we want to see more and more stories with them. And then you start doing other vehicles and stuff like that. Yeah. So it kind of is a bigger idea that can keep expanding."<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/06/20/with-cars-2-john-lasseter-gives-a-franchise-a-tune-up/ In ‘Cars 2,’ John Lasseter Says Big Oil is the ‘Uber Bad Guy’]</ref>

==Trivia==
*[[Dinoco]] cans are seen in the Honkers bar.
*Aside from the new title, the ''Planes'' logo appears to have a few small changes. For example:
**The silver metal has been changed to bronze.
**The small star below the title "Planes" has been changed to a sort of firehouse symbol, or the number "2" for countries where the film is titled ''Planes 2''.
*''Planes: Fire & Rescue'' is the fourth entry in the ''Cars'' franchise.
*In addition to car-ification and plane-ification, some aspects of Piston Peak National Park appear to be train-ified.
*Due to the cancellation of ''Planes 3'', characters from the films such as Dusty Crophopper, Ned and Zed, Leadbottom, as well as El Chupacabra and other Planes characters are set to make appearances in ''[[Cars: The Series|Cars On The Road.]]''
*Known as a SEAT (Single Engine Air Tanker), crop dusters were among the first wildfire air attack aircraft. The first operational air tanker was a repurposed crop duster, which made the first air drop on the Mendocino National Forest in 1955.<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue">[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-fire-rescue-fun-facts-70822/ ‘Planes: Fire & Rescue’ Fun Facts]</ref>
*Blade Ranger and Windlifter are both helicopters, so filmmakers turned to world-renowned aerobatic helicopter pilot Chuck Aaron to ensure they captured the helicopter flight authentically. Blade Ranger pulls some tricky maneuvers in the film that were reviewed and validated by Aaron.<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue" />
*The film’s setting is inspired by elements from a host of national parks, including Yosemite and Yellowstone.<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue" />
**National Parks Director Jonathan Jarvis was invited to Disneytoon Studios to view the film. He was thrilled with the attention to detail like the inclusion of rocking chairs in front of the fireplace.<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue" />
**Yellowstone’s Old Faithful Inn served as inspiration for the film’s Grand Fusel Lodge.<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue" />
**The railway station attached to the Grand Fusel Lodge was inspired by an actual station that once existed near Yellowstone’s north entrance and was designed by Robert Reamer, the architect of the Old Faithful Inn.<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue" />
*Playing upon the theme of second chances and based on filmmakers’ real-life observations during research trips to aerial firefighting stations, much of the Piston Peak Air Attack Base set is made up of repurposed structures. Filmmakers learned that budgets are traditionally stretched by reusing items, so they incorporated the practice in ''Planes: Fire & Rescue''. Maru is the ringleader when it comes to repurposing, repeating the mantra, ‘It’s better than new.’<ref name="SK Fire & Rescue" />
*A picture of [[Lightning McQueen]] is seen on a racing newspaper that Sparky was reading, while [[Sarge (Cars)|Sarge]] was seen on a photo in Mayday's garage.
*Mayday states that he uses Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment and yells McQueen's signature catchphrase, "''KA-CHOW!"'' when showing off his new bumper. This implies that Mayday is a fan of Lightning McQueen.
*The "red stuff" being dropped from the airplanes is Long Term Fire Retardant called Phos-Chek. It has been used by the US Forest Service for 50 years, and is used to create a containment line around a wildfire. It is dropped as a liquid, and will remain effective until it is washed off by heavy rain. The red color is used so pilots can see where to drop the next load to tie in with the line of previous drops.
*Blade Ranger was in a series called ''CHoPs'' (about the California Helicopter Patrol) with his partner Nick Lopez. Lopez is voiced by Erik Estrada, who played Ponch in the real TV series ''CHiPs'' (about the California Highway Patrol). Additionally, ''CHiPs'' and the fictional ''CHoPs'' both lasted for 139 episodes (in the hangar, Dipper describes the show as "139 episodes of law-breaking love"). Also, animator Piero Piluso watched every episode of ''CHiPs'' to ensure the accuracy of ''CHoPs''.<ref name="D23 Fun Facts" />
*The "Howard the Truck" video is a parody of ''Howard the Duck'', a [[1986]] film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Howard the Duck|character of the same name]].
*Animators created more than 2.5 million trees.<ref name="D23 Fun Facts">[https://www.facebook.com/DisneyPlanes/posts/737638969626026 Disney's Planes - Disney D23 presents 10 fun facts about Planes: Fire & Rescue, Facebook]</ref>
*1,224 shots are featured in the movie, and half had visual effects.<ref name="D23 Fun Facts" />
*The film is dedicated to the courageous firefighters who risk their lives every day.<ref name="D23 Fun Facts" />
*The Honkers bar is a parody of the real-life Hooters.
*“In the movie, there’s a scene where a new character named Blade takes Dusty Crophopper into a mine to protect him from a fire,” explains Planes: Fire & Rescue director Bobs Gannaway. “Well, that sequence is based on a true story. A firefighter named Pulaski saved his crew by taking them into a mine in Idaho during 1910’s Great Idaho Fire. In honor of the famous firefighter, we named our yellow fire truck in the movie Pulaski. It’s an absolute honor to have him represented in the film.”
*The fourth animated sequel to be produced in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, unlike the previous installments which were produced at 1.85:1, after ''[[wikipedia:Rugrats Go Wild|Rugrats Go Wild]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Shrek Forever After|Shrek Forever After]]'' and ''[[w:c:bstudios:Ice Age: Continental Drift|Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''.
*This is Disneytoon Studios' only film to be produced in a 2.39:1 widescreen aspect ratio rather than either of the three different widescreen ratios (1.66:1, 1.78:1, or 1.85:1).
*This is the last [[Disneytoon Studios]] film to be rated PG by the MPAA and to be released in theaters.
*This is the first Disney animated sequel to be rated PG by the MPAA.

==Goofs==
*During the lodge evacuation scene, there is a biplane trying to get its engine started so it can take off. The propeller blades on the biplane are obviously pitched in the wrong direction to pull the airplane forward with the engine running, and would push it backwards instead.
*In the movie, the red and green navigation lights are visible from aircraft in positions where they would not be visible in real life. The red light would be visible only through an arc of 110 degrees from straight ahead to port. The green light would be visible only through an arc of 110 degrees from straight ahead to starboard. This means that you would only see both red and green navigation lights if you were looking head on to the aircraft, and would see neither red nor green if within an arc of 140 degrees centered on straight behind (70 degrees either side).
*In the lodge is a wood carving, asking the question: "What is the hopping motion observed in deer refered to as?" This has "referred" misspelled.
