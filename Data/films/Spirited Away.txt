{{nihongo|'''''Spirited Away'''''|千と千尋の神隠し|Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi|extra = "Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"}} is a [[2001]] Japanese animated fantasy-adventure film written and directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and produced by [[Studio Ghibli]].

==Plot==
Ten-year old Chihiro and her parents are moving when her father takes a wrong turn. Her father thinks they've found an abandoned amusement park and insists on exploring. Chihiro who at first decides to stay at the car, scared to be alone, accompanies her parents.
They cross a dry riverbed. Chihiro's parents gorge themselves at an unattended restaurant stall while Chihiro wanders off. She finds an exquisite [[Bathhouse]]. Suddenly a boy orders her to cross the river before dark. Spirits begin haunting the park, and when Chihiro returns to her parents, they have become pigs.

Chihiro runs to the river, but it has flooded and is impossible to cross. Chihiro becomes frightened when she saw a ghost ship approaching her and immediately runs and hides. However, her body starts to become invisible and disappearing, but before that, the boy, Haku, finds her and says he has known her since she was little. He gives her a pill so her body won't disappear. He tells her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a spider youkai who commands the susuwatari. Kamaji and the worker Lin send Chihiro to the witch Yubaba, who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba gives Chihiro a job but steals her name. She is renamed Sen (千?), the first character of her name.

Haku shows Sen her parents' pigpen. Among her belongings, she finds a goodbye card addressed to Chihiro. Sen realizes that she has already forgotten her name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names. If she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, then she cannot leave the spirit world. At work, Sen invites a silent masked creature inside. A stink spirit arrives and is Sen's first customer. She discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic emetic dumpling. Secretly, the masked creature tempts a worker with gold, then swallows him. Publicly, the creature demands food and begins tipping extravagantly.

The next morning, Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon. She recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, she runs upstairs. As she passes the masked creature, he offers her a heap of gold, but she refuses it.

When Sen reaches Haku, a shikigami stowed away on her back transforms into Zeniba (hologram), Yubaba's identical twin sister. Zeniba turns Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse and creates a decoy baby. Haku has stolen a magic gold seal from her, and she warns that it carries a deadly curse. Before Zeniba took action, Haku cut the shikigami with his tail and make Zeniba's hologram disappeared. Haku then dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back. As they fall, Sen has a memory of being underwater. They fall right to the Kamaji's workroom. As Sen calms down Haku, she feeds Haku part of the dumpling, and he vomits up the seal and a black slug that Sen crushes. She resolves to return the seal and apologize for Haku. After Kamaji gives her the train tickets, she and Boh are ready to go to Zeniba's house.

Before she leaves, she confronts the masked creature, who is a monster named No-Face. No-Face has become disgustingly obese, so Sen feeds him a medicine ball from the River Spirit. He begins vomiting and angrily chases Sen out of the bathhouse. As he vomits, he returns to normal size and a gentle demeanor. Lin, who has been waiting for Sen's arrival, takes her to the rail.

While Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to Zeniba, Yubaba is furious at the damage caused by No-Face. She blames Sen for inviting him in and orders that her parents be slaughtered. Haku prods her into realizing that her baby is missing. He proposes to return Boh in exchange for Yubaba, freeing Sen and her parents.

Sen, No-Face, and Boh arrive at Zeniba's house. Zeniba reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse. The black slug was how Yubaba controlled him. Haku arrives. As he flies her and Boh back to the bathhouse left No-Face as Zeniba's worker. Sen has another memory of being underwater: When she was little, she fell in the Kohaku River but was washed safely ashore. She realizes that Haku is the spirit of the Kohaku River and tells him his real name, "Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi".

Arrived at Yubaba's Bathhouse entrance, she encountered Yubaba. Sen must recognize them from among a group of pigs to break the curse on her parents. She correctly discerns that her parents are not there. Sen then congratulates by Yubaba's worker, and Yubaba grants her permission to Sen to left the bathhouse and return to the human world. Haku takes her to the riverbed, which is dry once more. He says that he can't come with her, and she must not look back, but they will surely meet again.

Chihiro's parents are waiting for her on the other side. They do not remember anything and mildly scold her for wandering off. They walk back to their car, filled with dust and covered with leaves, as though it had been there for a long time. As they drive away, Dad says, "a new home and new school -- it is a bit scary". Chihiro, much matured since her last car ride, replies, "I think I can handle it".

==Production==
Miyazaki wrote the script after he decided the film would be based on his friend's ten-year-old daughter, who came to visit his house each summer. At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. Production of Spirited Away began in 2000. During production, Miyazaki based the film's settings at a museum in Koganei, Tokyo. However, Miyazaki realized the film would be over three hours and decided to cut out several parts of the story for its July 27, 2001 release. 

When released, Spirited Away became the most successful film in Japanese history, grossing over $274 million worldwide. The film overtook Titanic (at the time the top grossing film worldwide) in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Bloody Sunday) and is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.

In February 2002, Wild Bunch, a German-based international sales company, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.<ref>https://www.screendaily.com/wild-bunch-adds-spirited-away-amongst-others/408281.article</ref> The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On April 13, 2002, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.<ref>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2002/04/13/national/copyrights-to-spirited-away-sold-to-disney/</ref>

Pixar director John Lasseter, a fan of Miyazaki, was approached by Walt Disney Pictures to supervise an English-language translation for the film's North American release. Lasseter hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer of the adaptation.

==Trivia==
*In both Japanese and American versions, the end credit song "Always with Me" is retained in Japanese.
*Spirited Away is the first, and so far, the only animated film that was both hand-drawn and originally done in a language other than English to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.
