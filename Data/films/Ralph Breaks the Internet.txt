==Synopsis==
''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' leaves [[Litwak's Arcade]] behind, venturing into the uncharted, expansive, and thrilling world of the internet, which may or may not survive Ralph's wrecking. Video game bad guy [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]] (voice of [[John C. Reilly]]) and fellow misfit [[Vanellope von Schweetz]] (voice of [[Sarah Silverman]]) must risk it all by traveling to the World Wide Web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope's video game, ''[[Sugar Rush]]''. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the Netizens—to help navigate their way, including [[Yesss]] (voice of [[Taraji P. Henson]]), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of the trend-making site "[[BuzzzTube]]", and [[Shank]] (voice of [[Gal Gadot]]), a tough-as-nails driver from a gritty online auto-racing game called ''Slaughter Race''.

==Plot==
At Litwak's Arcade, Wreck-It Ralph enjoys having Vanellope von Schweetz in their adventures within [[Game Central Station]]. One day, [[Stan Litwak|Mr. Litwak]] plugs in a new Wi-Fi router to the [[Internet]], but the [[Surge Protector]] warns the video game characters to stay clear of it.

Vanellope yearns to have something new for a change, having gotten tired of the repetitive races in her game. Overhearing her, Ralph heads into ''Sugar Rush'' to create a new track for her. As soon as Vanellope reaches the finish line, Vanellope decides to choose to take his track, which overrides the players' control over the steering wheel until they accidentally pull it out. [[Swati and Nafisa]] call up Litwak to fix the wheel, but it breaks into two pieces. A new wheel is available on eBay, but due to its costly price, Litwak has no choice but to unplug ''Sugar Rush''. Ralph and Vanellope help the other ''Sugar Rush'' characters get to Game Central Station, and they are taken to [[Fix-It Felix Jr.]] and [[Sergeant Calhoun]]'s penthouse. Vanellope is heartbroken at losing her game unless something can be done in the next day. Ralph then remembers there was a steering wheel on eBay, and decides to go to the Internet.

He finds Vanellope, and they bother Surge Protector about a fake emergency as they head to the Wi-Fi router. While the two are examining the router interior, Litwak's netizen avatar appears, going into a capsule that could take it to the Internet. Ralph and Vanellope follow the avatar, and they are suddenly transported into the Internet's hub. They go to the search engine [[KnowsMore]] to find eBay. Ralph is annoyed when KnowsMore shoots out guesses until Vanellope asks "eBay Sugar Rush steering wheel", and Ralph and Vanellope are transported to eBay. As the two don't understand that the numbers used in the auction represent what they have to pay they raise the price of the steering wheel to $27,001, for which they are unable to pay. Ralph then sees a pop-up netizen, [[Spamley]], who can help them get the money by video game looting.

One of the options is to find Shank's car in a game called ''[[Slaughter Race]]'', in which Ralph hates due to it being too dangerous for Vanellope, and Shank then encounters the two. Vanellope then takes Shank's car as Shank tails them. Although she is impressed by Vanellope, Shank refuses to give them her car, but Shank advises Ralph he can get money by making videos on [[BuzzzTube]].

Ralph and Vanellope end up at BuzzzTube, where [[Yesss]], the head algorithm, has Ralph make many videos, turning him into an internet sensation. In order to help Ralph get more hearts, Yesss sends out pop-up netizens to garner more views. Vanellope decides to go to other websites and be a pop-up, and Ralph chooses [[Oh My Disney]] for her because it had a castle, and Vanellope was a princess. Yesss agrees and redirects her there. Vanellope runs into trouble with [[First Order Stormtroopers]] before she finds a safe haven with the [[Disney Princess]]es. Vanellope befriends the princesses, and they give her advice on finding what she desires the most.

Meanwhile, Ralph and Yesss try to upload a video, but it can't load. The [[Eboy]] (the eBay alert messenger) tells Ralph that the steering wheel would expire in 30 minutes. Yesss tries to fix it while Ralph reads the comments, some with a favorable reception, and some with disparaging words. Ralph is dispirited despite Yesss' warning not to read the comments, though Yesss tells Ralph he made enough money to buy the steering wheel. He thanks her for all her help, and Ralph calls Vanellope on his phone that Yesss has given him, and Vanellope is delighted. Ralph then makes his way to eBay.

At eBay, after getting the steering wheel, Ralph then tries to call Vanellope again, but his voice is muted. He overhears Vanellope, who is at ''Slaughter Race'', Vanellope confiding with Shank that she wanted to stay with Shank at the game. A bitter Ralph asks Spamley for a virus that could slow down ''Slaughter Race'' and convince Vanellope to leave. Spamley takes Ralph to the Dark Net and introduces him to [[Double Dan]], and he gives them "[[Arthur (Wreck-It Ralph)|Arthur]]", an insecurity virus that can slow down ''Slaughter Race''. Ralph releases the virus into ''Slaughter Race'' during a race, where it scans on Vanellope's glitch, which she was 30% insecure of herself, and transmits it throughout the game to create havoc.

Ralph tries to get inside the game and look for Vanellope. Shank then tells him and Vanellope to both get out of the game as it will reboot. Ralph then picks up an unconscious Vanellope, and after they escaped, Vanellope awakens, but is angry at Ralph after he admits that he inserted the virus to slow down the game. Vanellope throws the [[Vanellope's Medal|medal]] she gave Ralph down to the Dark Net, which breaks into two, and storms off, breaking Ralph's heart. Nearby, "Arthur", inside the wreckage, scans Ralph's insecurities, which are at 100%, and unleashes them all over the internet in the form of thousands of [[Ralph Clones|viral Ralphs]].

The Ralph viruses cause chaos all around the net, wrecking anything in their path and causing a global-wide DDoS attack, all while looking for Vanellope, and Vanellope tries to run away, looking for Shank. Vanellope then goes to KnowsMore, and she helps him close down his site. The real Ralph appears, and KnowsMore informs them that the clones will disappear if they can get the Ralphs through the antivirus software. Yesss picks up Ralph and Vanellope to lure the viruses to the antivirus gate. When the clones form a giant Ralph, Yesss saves Vanellope while Ralph fights it, but Vanellope gets captured by the giant Ralph. Ralph continues fighting the giant Ralph but almost gets crushed until Vanellope pleads it to stop. After Ralph fixes his insecurities, the clones dissolve, causing Ralph to fall. Spamley tries to catch him, but Ralph just falls through his car and gets knocked out in the process. Below, the Disney Princesses, who have been watching the battle the whole time, use their magical powers and skills to rescue Ralph. Their efforts result in Ralph safely landing on a bed where he wakes up and meets the Princesses, who tell him that they are friends with Vanellope, which makes Ralph their friend, too.

After the battle, Shank incorporates Vanellope's code into ''Slaughter Race'' to let her stay in the game. Ralph and Vanellope sadly part ways, with each now sharing one half of Ralph's medal, and Ralph returns to Litwak's Arcade alone. Ralph then explains the changes to himself and the arcade - the Sugar Rush racers are friendlier now with Felix and Calhoun's effective parenting, and he has participated in community activities with the other arcade game characters. He still talks to Vanellope through Yesss' phone weekly, though an upcoming update to ''Slaughter Race'' will enable Vanellope to come for a visit within two months. After he ends his call with Vanellope, Ralph watches the sunrise once more as he and Felix head to work.

In a mid-credits scene, a toddler ([[Moana (character)|Moana]], shortened to '''Mo''') plays a game of ''Pancake Milkshake'' after watching the film, which disappoints her because one of the scenes from the trailer wasn't in the final version, but Ralph and Vanellope enter the game and crash it, [https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1348198-wreck-it-ralph spawning a meme.]

In a post-credits scene, a supposed-to-be sneak peek of ''[[Frozen II]]'' shifts to Ralph rickrolling to the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley, with ''Slaughter Race'' characters and Felix. Ralph then breaks the fourth wall telling the audience there are no more surprises to show up, ending the film.

==Development==
When he spoke about a sequel back in [[2013]], director [[Rich Moore]] told the media that he wanted to try and work in mobile/casual gaming, and he also liked the idea of bringing in different Wreck-It Ralphs from mobile versions or ''Super Smash Bros.''-esque iterations of the character.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZBSTUBCpWo#t=4m22s Disney Wreck-It Ralph Director Rich Moore Is a Huge Gamer]</ref><ref>[http://collider.com/wreck-it-ralph-2-john-c-reilly-returning-for-sequel/ John C.

[[File:Wreck it Ralph 2 first look.jpeg|thumb|250px|Visual development depicting Ralph and Vanellope's differing opinions of the Internet.]]
Serious talks about a ''Wreck-It Ralph'' sequel began in [[2014]]. [[Henry Jackman]] was the first to leak information, saying the sequel's story is being written.<ref>[http://collider.com/henry-jackman-captain-america-winter-soldier-interview/ Composer Henry Jackman Talks ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', His Influences, ''Wreck-It Ralph 2'', ''The Interview'', and More]</ref> There was a general consensus that a sequel wouldn't be made unless there was a good story. Part of the inspiration for doing a sequel came from Ralph's final line in ''Wreck-It Ralph''; "Turns out I don't need a medal to tell me I'm a good guy. Because if that little kid likes me, how bad can I be?" According to Rich Moore and Phil Johnston, the more they thought about that particular line, the more dysfunctional it seemed. It gave the impression that Ralph's self-esteem is solely dependent on how Vanellope feels about him, meaning he still has insecurities to overcome and room to grow as a character. This prompted the filmmakers to like the first film, have Ralph and Vanellope's relationship serve as the center of the story.<ref name="story">{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mGoCs5U8DmI|title="Ralph Breaks the Internet" Press Conference with John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman +, Wreck-It Ralph|date=November 4, 2018}}</ref>
That's when Rich Moore came up with the idea of having the characters travel to the Internet. This created numerous opportunities for comedy and conflict between Ralph and Vanellope, which excited the creative team.<ref name="OMD">{{Cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/news/2018/09/20/behind-the-scenes-ralph-breaks-internet-interview-rich-moore-phil-johnston-clark-spencer/|website=Oh My Disney|title=Behind the Scenes of Ralph Breaks the Internet with Rick Moore, Phil Johnston, and Clark Spencer|date=September 20, 2018|author=Uribe, Mariana}}</ref>

The story went through a number of revisions. In the beginning, the Internet was essentially the antagonist of the film. It was regarded as a threat to the arcade's way of life, a threat that Ralph sought to wreck. In another version, Vanellope was sucked into the Internet and became the leader of her own website, Vanellope.com. Another had Ralph becoming an Internet sensation corrupted by fame and fortune.<ref name="OMD" /><ref name="geeks">{{Cite web|url=https://www.geeksofdoom.com/2018/09/20/ralph-breaks-the-internet-story-team-talks|title=Ralph Breaks The Internet' Story Team Talks Saving Knowsmore, Crafting A Scene, Collaboration, and More|date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Disney Princesses Comfy Clothes Group.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Visual development depicting Vanellope alongside the revamped Disney princesses.]]
The idea of a prominent Disney crossover involving the Disney princesses was inspired by the "Which Disney Princess Are You?" quizzes that commonly appear on sites like Buzzfeed. The joke was that upon coming across one of these quizzes, Ralph and Vanellope would encounter the princesses themselves. Co-writer Pamela Ribon questioned whether Vanellope is an official member of the Disney Princess line-up, considering the character ''is'' a princess and comes from the same studio behind ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. Ribon then envisioned a scenario in which Vanellope got to meet the princesses inside the Internet, and the concept continued to expand from there. Ribon wrote out the scene and included a number of jokes that appear in the final film. When it came time to pitch it to Rich Moore, Ribon admittedly feared the scene would be rejected. However, it was approved and showed to the rest of Disney Animation to similar praise. With this, the princesses scene officially became part of the movie.

On [[July 12]], [[2015]], John C. Reilly confirmed the sequel and announced that he is signed on to reprise his role as [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Ralph]].<ref name="Reilly-confirmed">{{cite web|author=Otterson, Joe|title=John C.

On [[March 24]], [[2016]], [[Rich Moore]] stated that a sequel is still being planned. Moore also hopes to specifically include an appearance from Mario, citing a "good relationship with Nintendo".<ref name="ignmoore">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/wreck-it-ralph-2-still-happening-might-feature-mario|title=Wreck-It Ralph 2 Still Happening, Might Feature Mario|author=Tilly, Chris|publisher=IGN|date=Mar 24, 2016|accessdate=Mar 24, 2016}}</ref>

The film was officially announced by Walt Disney Animation Studios on [[June 30]], [[2016]], with a release date set for [[March 9]], [[2018]]. [[John C.

In an interview with Collider, Moore confirms that the film had been in development for about two and a half years by the time of its announcement. Development halted when Moore put the focus on co-directing ''[[Zootopia]]'', though things were set back in motion immediately after production on the film wrapped. [[Phil Johnston]], a writer on the original ''Wreck-It Ralph'', was brought on to co-direct alongside Moore in response to his heavy influence on the first movie.<ref name="Rich" />

At the [[2017]] D23 Expo in [[Anaheim, California]], it was revealed that the [[Disney Princess]]es would feature in speaking roles, marking the first time these characters have all interacted on screen, together. Other appearances from both [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Marvel Comics]] properties were also revealed. [[Jack McBrayer]] and [[Jane Lynch]] were also confirmed to reprise their roles as [[Fix-It Felix Jr.]] and [[Sergeant Calhoun]], respectively.

On [[July 10]], [[2018]], the ''Wreck-It Ralph 2'' subtitle was dropped from the title.<ref name="THR" />

==Music==
{{Main|Ralph Breaks the Internet (soundtrack)}}
Composer [[Henry Jackman]] returns to score the movie. According to Jackman, his goal was to incorporate elements from the original soundtrack, while adding a new layer to fit in with the Internet's modern environment.

Interestingly, unlike ''Wreck-It Ralph'', ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' features a full-fledged musical number in the style of classic Disney performed by [[Sarah Silverman]] as Vanellope and [[Gal Gadot]] as [[Shank]]. [[Alan Menken]], who is renowned for scoring a majority of the [[Disney Renaissance]], penned the song, titled "[[A Place Called Slaughter Race]]". It was inspired by what lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] described as the "I want" song, in which the hero or heroine would burst into song to proclaim their deepest desires. This is a common element in Disney musicals, especially those involving princesses, which connects—narratively—to the idea of Vanellope embracing her inner-Disney Princess. Phil Johnston doubled as a co-lyricist for the song. In classic Disney Renaissance fashion, Grammy nominee Julia Michaels was signed on to perform the credits version of the song.

The single for this film is "[[Zero (song)|Zero]]", written and performed by Imagine Dragons, who made a cameo appearance in the film, watching a video of Ralph's impersonation of [[Wikipedia:Bob Ross|Bob Ross]].

The ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' soundtrack was released on [[November 16]], [[2018]].

**Veteran animator [[Mark Henn]] was brought on as a consultant to ensure that the Disney princesses retained key characteristics despite the broader style.<ref name="prince">{{Cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/news/2018/09/20/oh-my-disney-ralph-breaks-the-internet/?cmp=smc%7C1787172151/|title=HOW OH MY DISNEY BECAME A KEY LOCATION FEATURING THE DISNEY PRINCESSES IN RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET|date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> Henn also animated the hand-drawn cameos of [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Humphrey the Bear]], and [[J. Audubon Woodlore]].
*To ensure that the Disney princess avatars were faithful representations of their classic films, the ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' creative team consulted the original filmmakers, voice actresses, and even the characters at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]. They also rewatched the films.<ref name="prince" />
*Prior to the film's release, Disney received backlash over Tiana's redesign, specifically her lightened skin tone and sharper features. In response, Tiana's scenes were reanimated so that she more closely resembled her original depiction.<ref name="tiana">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/25/anika-noni-rose-princess-tiana-ralph-2/|title=Princess Tiana voice actress Anika Noni Rose addresses Disney reanimating character after backlash|date=September 25, 2018}}</ref>
*There were plans to have a villain in the movie at one point, but this was scrapped in favor of a narrative in which Ralph served as his own antagonist. The villain was named [[B.E.V.]], and was an AntiVirus-inspired cop that lived in the Internet.<ref name="villain">{{Cite web|url=http://www.moviebill.com/stories/story-cache-how-ralph-breaks-the-internet-broke-its-narrative//|title=Story Cache: How 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' broke its narrative|date=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref name="vill">{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/ralph-breaks-the-internet-had-a-few-totally-different-p-1829920568|title=Ralph Breaks the Internet Had a Few Totally Different Plots Before It Was Done|date=October 25, .2018}}</ref>
*One of the jokes that were pitched involved [[Kylo Ren]] from the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy]] being portrayed as a spoiled child. However, [[Lucasfilm]] requested that the filmmakers scrap the joke out of fear that it would undermine Kylo Ren's role as their villain.<ref name="Dan">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/the-kylo-ren-joke-that-had-to-be-changed-for-ralph-breaks-the-internet|title=THE KYLO REN JOKE THAT HAD TO BE CHANGED FOR RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET|date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>
*Nafisa is voiced by Michaela Zee, the daughter of [[Ming-Na Wen]], who reprises her role as [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]].
*In an early version of the script, the movie began with a funeral for Tapper. In during which, Ralph and Vanellope were to give a eulogy, though they instead spent the time talking about themselves. To that, the gathered mourners would rebuke the duo by throwing food and starting a food fight.<ref name="tap">{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/ralph-breaks-the-internet-interview/2/|title=An Early, Behind-The-Scenes Look Into The Making Of ‘Ralph Breaks The Internet’|date=October 30, .2018}}</ref>
*Some versions of the movie had Felix and Calhoun joining Ralph and Vanellope on their journey to the Internet. This was partially altered to keep the arcade relevant, and due to the belief that having too many characters adventuring through the Internet would overwhelm the story.<ref name="tap" />
*As [[Mindy Kaling]] does not reprise the role, Taffyta Muttonfudge is the only returning character not to have her original voice actor. Melissa Villaseñor voices Taffyta instead.
*This is the second time [[Brad Garrett]] voiced [[Eeyore]] in 2018, the first being ''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]'', which came out three and a half months prior.
*With the film's release date set on [[November 21]], [[2018]], roughly two years after ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]''<nowiki/>'s release, this is the longest break between two films from Walt Disney Animation Studios since the 28-month gap between ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' ([[July 2]], [[1986]]) and ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' ([[November 18]], [[1988]]).
*The film marks [[Alan Menken]]'s first contribution to the Disney animated canon since ''[[Tangled]]'' in [[2010]].
**Thus, it is also the second time Menken composes a song but not a music score for a Disney film after [[1992]]'s ''[[Newsies]]'' (whose music underscore was instead composed by J.A.C. Redford).
*When asked about naming the film with "Breaks the Internet" instead of "Wrecks the Internet", the filmmakers explained that the double meaning behind "break the internet" (being a common phrase on the real-life Internet and being literal as Ralph nearly destroys the world inside the Internet) made the title more appealing.<ref name="story" />
**The naming was also inquired by Ralph and Vanellope in the trailer, with Yesss giving an answer similar to the above.
*[[Buzz Lightyear]] from the ''[[Toy Story]]'' franchise appears in the film shouting his iconic catchphrase "To Infinity and Beyond!". Coincidentally both teaser trailers for the then unreleased ''Toy Story 4'' were shown before the movie.
*[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise both appear in the film probably as a substitute for them not appearing in ''[[Solo]]'', which was released the same year.
*Before the princesses change into their casual wear, a Disney-castle transition is shown. This is a reference to the 1960s [[Wikipedia:Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], and {{WikipediaLink|Neal Hefti}}'s music from the series is used.
*This film marks the fourth time [[Henry Jackman]] composes the music score for a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film after ''[[Winnie the Pooh (film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'', the original ''Wreck-It Ralph'', and ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.
*Unlike the first movie, ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' does not have an opening title card. This makes it the third [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film to not have the title card appear until the end of the film after ''Big Hero 6'' and ''Moana''.
**The 8-bit Walt Disney Animation Studios logo was not used for the film, unlike the first movie.
**Also, the Disney logo appears on the top of the logo at the end of the film.
*In the storybook version of the film, it only features the first official 11 Disney Princesses and excludes Anna, Elsa and Moana. It also doesn't mention the scene where the princesses saved Ralph from his demise.
*The first and, for so far, only Walt Disney Animation Studios film to use the short 2011 Disney closing logo since 2016's ''[[Zootopia]]''.
*This movie has the most amount of Easter eggs ever in a Disney Movie, clocking in at about 122.
*This is the second Disney animated film to include real world products after ''[[Oliver & Company]]''.
*With about 14 minutes of end credits (including post-credits scenes), this film has the longest running time of end credits to date for an animated film.
*With the running time of 112 minutes, this is the second longest Disney animated film after ''[[Fantasia]]''.
*''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' was nominated for "Favorite Animated Movie" at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Kids%27_Choice_Awards 2019 Kids' Choice Awards], but lost to [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Incredibles 2]]''.
*This is the final Walt Disney Animation Studios film to feature animated menus and to specifically describe the scene selections for its home media releases.
