'''''Lightyear''''' is an [[United States|American]] computer-animated science-fiction action film co-produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is a spin-off from the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], serving as an origin story for the fictional test pilot/astronaut whom the [[Buzz Lightyear]] toy featured in the main films was based on, presented as a film within a film that the characters in ''Toy Story'' would have watched.

The film was a box-office bomb, grossing $225 million worldwide against a $200 million production budget. It received generally positive reviews from critics, praising its animation, voice acting, score and entertainment value but criticized its plot.

It is Pixar's 26th animated feature, and was theatrically released on [[June 17]], [[2022]], in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, and [[IMAX]]. It is also the first Pixar film filmed in IMAX.

==Synopsis==
The definitive origin story of [[Buzz Lightyear]], the hero who inspired the toy, Lightyear follows the legendary Space Ranger after he is marooned on a hostile planet 4.2 million light-years from Earth alongside his commander and their crew. As Buzz tries to find a way back home through space and time, he is joined by a group of ambitious recruits and his charming robot companion cat, [[Sox]]. Complicating matters and threatening the mission is the arrival of [[Emperor Zurg|Zurg]], an imposing presence with an army of ruthless robots and a mysterious agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/1218926-lightyear-trailer-poster-previews-pixars-toy-story-spin-off|title=''Lightyear'' Trailer & Poster Previews Pixar's ''Toy Story'' Spin-Off|website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=April 21, 2022}}</ref>

==Plot==
In the far future, a massive ship, dubbed the [[Turnip]], carries a colony through hyperspace to an unknown destination. The ship makes a quick pitstop at a planet, named Tikana Prime, and Space Rangers Buzz Lightyear and [[Alisha Hawthorne]] traverse their newfound surroundings for any resources. Buzz is a dutiful ranger with a habit of doing things on his own and makes mission logs to help him focus. Alisha, his best friend, mocks him for this and has been with him since the early training days at the academy. She also brings along a recruit named Featheringhamsten, whom Buzz is indifferent to as he feels that he can do things without the aid of anyone.

Shortly after meeting the rookie, the trio are attacked by living vines and large flying insects and rush back to the Turnip. Buzz takes control of the ship and hastily tries to maneuver it off the planet, despite Featheringhamsten and Alisha trying to offer their help to him and the low altitude that the ship has. He just barely manages to fly the Turnip off the ground but it hits a cliff, causing them to lose air and crashing back down on the planet. With the last of their crystallic fusion energy wasted, Buzz offers to have himself stripped of his rank, but Alisha perks him up and gives him a new mission to get them off the planet by using the planet's resources to make a new crystallic fuel source.

One year later, the colony has developed a civilization with vines and bugs only being a minor problem. A new fuel source is created and set to be tested by Buzz himself. Their plan is for Buzz to use the fuel to fly off the planet, make a swing around the closest sun and try to reach hyperspace before safely landing back on Tikana Prime. Buzz flies off to the sun and manages to loop around, but nearly damages the ship's engine, forcing him to eject the fuel and sling him back through the safety hoops. He successfully does so, but upon landing notices that Airman Diaz now has a beard, when he did not have one before. Diaz reveals that his trip, caused him to miss over four years on Tikana Prime.

Buzz is reunited with Alisha, who is now his superior and brings him up to date on how his trip is affected by time and ask that he abandon the mission. Buzz additionally learns that in the intervening years, Alisha met a scientist named Kiko and is now engaged to her while the colony has chosen to build living quarters. Buzz is given his and is additionally given a small robotic cat named [[Sox]] who was designed to be his close companion, while also displaying useful technological devices within him. Buzz has a nightmare about his crash and decides to give Sox a mission to find a suitable formula for a fuel source. He meets up with Alisha and manages to convince her to let him go again until they find the right fuel to get off the planet.

In the years that Buzz spends traveling into space and back, he witnesses Alisha's life flash before his eyes. Her pregnancy, her family life with Kiko, her son's graduation and marriage and her autumn years. Buzz eventually returns to find that Alisha had passed away, but left behind a message telling him to continue the fight while also revealing her granddaughter, [[Izzy Hawthorne|Izzy]], who aspires to be a Space Ranger. Alisha's office is now occupied by Commander Burnside who informs Buzz that the mission to get off the planet has been cancelled and that they will make do by building a laser shield; shocking Buzz.

Buzz solemnly returns to his living quarters and learns that Sox managed to successfully find a suitable formula for the crystallic engine. However, soldiers, dubbed Zappers, arrive to decommission Sox and Buzz flees with him. Sox uses his ability to use a tranquilizer dart to get passed one Zapper, making Buzz realize that Sox was initially designed to keep him in line. Using the formula, they manage to create the perfect crystallic fusion, but the computer carrying the information gets destroyed and Buzz and Sox flee once again. They manage to get back onto a space ship and escape the Zappers with Buzz flying around the sun and successfully achieving hyperspace.

Buzz returns to the planet, but finds that things have become much more barren. He is rescued by a cadet from a robot who teleports itself and [[XL-15|Buzz's ship]] away. The cadet reveals herself to be a grown up Izzy Hawthorne. Buzz has traveled over twenty-two years into the future. Izzy reveals that the robot came from a giant mother ship floating above the surface of the planet, dubbed the Zurg Ship, after the fact that the robots can only say "[[Emperor Zurg|Zurg]]". She further reveals that the robots are surrounding the colony who have placed up their laser shield and are trapped. In order to defeat the robots, they need to blow up the ship, which they can now due to Buzz being a pilot.

Buzz, Sox, and Izzy reach the fort where the latter introduces the rest of the team; [[Darby Steel]], [[Mo Morrison]], and ERIC, a robot. With the plan set in motion, the group is suddenly attacked by a robot that blows up their ship and tries to carry Buzz away. At this point, it becomes apparent that each member is ill-equipped to handle any action or danger. Nevertheless, Buzz manages to disarm the robot and Mo, unintentionally puts it out of commission by tossing a harpoon at its head. Buzz learns that the group is actually Junior Patrol and are not even considered "Rookies". Mo came aboard thinking that he was attending a workout bootcamp and has always been a quitter, Darby is trying to shorten her sentence after having stolen a ship, while Izzy, who is well knowledgeable in her grandmother's life, lacks patience.

Without a ship, Buzz resolves to get a new one. ERIC informs them that they have an abandoned hangar nearby, but even he suffers from a major flaw as he is unable to provide a proper pathway to it on a map and becomes distracted with trying to correct himself. Despite Buzz's reluctance, the rest of the patrol insist on coming along with him as they too know the way. They arrive at the hangar where Buzz plans to part ways with the team; taking Sox with him. The interior of the hangar is littered with the eggs of the giant insects. Buzz finds his old uniform, but is followed by the Patrol after he accidentally took their keys to the truck. They end up alerting the insects and lock themselves in the changing rooms.

Buzz resolves to have the Patrol wear the other uniforms and use the stealth mode to get out while he and Sox leave via the spaceship. The plan works, but Buzz forgets to tell them that stealth mode is limited energy and the whole group is forced to escape onto the space ship and fly out of the hangar. They avert the insects as well as another space ship that tries to shoot them down; during this time, it is revealed that Izzy suffers from astrophobia, the fear of space, which would technically ban her from being a ranger. Buzz and the crew manage to safely land the ship, but they blow out a fuel cell. Izzy directs the group to a nearby mining facility to get a spare part.

The group manage to find a space part in the a control deck, but Mo accidentally triggers an alarm causing red cones to come down and trap them. Working together, they manage to destroy the controls, just as the control deck breaks off and nearly falls into the mine. The group gathers together and eat sandwiches from a vending machine, that oddly enough have the bread inside and the meat outside. As Mo sulks over nearly costing them the mission, Buzz admits that when he first got to the academy, he was one of the worst rangers, but that Alisha saw something in him and pushed him until he became one of the best rangers in the squad. As the team head back to the ship, they are attacked by Zurg himself who is after Buzz and ignores the others. Zurg speaks to him telling him to come, but the team rescue Buzz and get back onto the ship and escape.

Zurg sends his minions after the team and they hastily fly away with Mo and Darcy using weapons to fend off the robots. As they attempt to fly, Izzy presumptuously releases the crystallic fusion and they lose it to one of the robots. As Buzz walks away defeated, Zurg appears again and captures him before disappearing, leaving the team in shock. Buzz is taken to the mother ship and confronts Zurg, but he stops him. Zurg is revealed to be a giant suit and within it an elderly Buzz who also kept his version of Sox who has slightly deteriorated. Old Buzz reveals that when he returned to Tikana Prime, Burnside immediately arrived to arrest him. He continued to travel into the future with Sox until he arrived at a point where the technology had advanced beyond anything he could imagine. Using it, he has been traveling back in time to prevent the crash that stranded them on the planet, but has nearly used up his crystallic fusion and has been hoping to use Buzz's.

Buzz is happy to learn that they can go back, but realizes that Alisha was always happy with her life and that it could potentially mean that Izzy and her friends cease to exist. He refuses, intending to simply get the colony off the planet, and Old Buzz reveals his true colors by capturing him. However, Old Sox uses a tranquilizer to knock him out and decides to help Buzz with getting off the ship and returning the crystallic fuel. Back on Tikana Prime, Izzy realizes that they can use the teleport discs from the robots and transports herself, Sox, Mo and Darby up to the mother ship. Izzy and Sox go looking for Buzz while Mo and Darby struggle to stop the incoming robot army.

Old Sox takes Buzz to the control room and sets a self-destruct timer for two minutes. However, Old Buzz returns as Zurg and destroys Old Sox, forcing Buzz to face him in combat. Izzy and Sox find Buzz, but the fastest way there is by jumping out the airlock towards the cockpit. Izzy finally conquers her fears and they jump out and reach the other side of the ship. Mo and Darcy unleash their trap on the robots just as Izzy and Sox enter and help Buzz take care of Zurg. They grab the crystallic fusion and teleport back to the main deck to escape, via the ship. The ship explodes, sending Buzz flying and uses the crystal to power his own ship and fly towards his friends.

Zurg is revealed to have survived and grabs the crystal, forcing Buzz to eject (getting his wings in the process) and blows up the crystal along with Zurg. He flies and rescues his friends by steering their ship towards the ground and manage to fall with style. Buzz admits that he blew up the crystal, but has accepted his life on Tikani Prime as his home. With the whole team safe, they are approached by the rescue team along with a very angry Burnside. Burnside reprimands Buzz for the years of going against protocol, only to congratulate him for saving the colony. Wanting to restart the Space Ranger program, he offers any member of the Zappers to be a part of his team, but Buzz has already decided on his own.

Adorned in brand new upgraded armor, Buzz and his team prepare for their next mission. Buzz and Izzy admire a statue of Alisha before continuing to their brand new ship. Buzz, Izzy, Mo, Darcy, and Sox get set for a brand new adventure with their motto, "To Infinity and Beyond!"

In a mid-credits scene, Burnside is sitting in his office looking over papers when a giant insect is zapped by the laser forcefield, something that makes him very proud.

In a post-credits scene, ERIC finally maps out the perfect route to take to the hangar, only to realize that everyone has already left.

In a second post-credits scene, the Zurg armor floats through space after the explosion, and the eyes of the suit light up, indicating he survived.

==Production==
===Development===
After finishing work on ''[[Finding Dory]]'', [[Angus MacLane]] was allowed to pitch the idea of making a [[Buzz Lightyear]] film, based on the idea over what movie [[Andy Davis]] would have seen in the original ''[[Toy Story]]'' to get interested in a Buzz Lightyear action figure. As a science fiction fan himself, MacLane had felt attracted to the Lightyear character since he started working at Pixar, feeling that the film's story was very "personal" for him. An aspect present in the ''Toy Story'' films that ''Lightyear'' explores is Buzz's disagreement over the nature of reality, which, coupled with his heroic ideals, made an amalgam of sci-fi clichés that MacLane intended to make more than just a punchline.

In February [[2019]], [[Tim Allen]] expressed interest in doing another film as he "did not see any reason why they would not do it". On The Ellen DeGeneres Show that May, [[Tom Hanks]] said that ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' would be the final installment in the franchise, but producer Mark Nielsen disclosed a possibility of a fifth film, as Pixar was not ruling out that possibility.

In December [[2020]] at a Disney Investor Day meeting, ''Lightyear'' was announced as a spin-off film depicting the in-universe origin of the human Buzz Lightyear, with Chris Evans providing the character's voice.

It was revealed in March 2022 that a scene featuring a same-sex kiss between [[Alicia Hawthorne]] and another woman was initially cut, because it was random and didn't help the storyline. However, due to then-current Disney CEO [[Bob Chapek]]'s response to the passing of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_House_Bill_1557 Floridian Parental Rights in Education Bill] (also known as the "Don't Say Gay Bill") and the internal uproar it caused within Disney, the scene was reinstated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2022/film/news/pixar-lightyear-same-sex-kiss-1235209179/|title=Same-Sex Kiss Restored in Pixar’s ''Lightyear'' Following Staff Uproar Over ''Don’t Say Gay'' Bill (EXCLUSIVE)|website=Collider|date=March 18, 2022|accessdate=March 22, 2022}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Chris Evans]] was announced to have been cast as the human Buzz Lightyear upon the project's announcement in December 2020. Evans was the first and only choice MacLane had for Buzz. He visited Pixar's offices one day and they pitched him the project during a visit. Evans accepted the offer immediately, given his love for animation. [[Taika Waititi]] was reported to have been cast in an undisclosed role in November 2021.

===Animation===
The animators wanted the film to look "cinematic" and "chunky" in order to evoke the feeling of the sci-fi films MacLane grew up with. In order to achieve this, they asked a former [[Industrial Light & Magic]] employee to build a spaceship model for them, from which the animators drew inspiration; this technique was inspired by designers for early sci-fi films using models as inspiration for their sets and props.

==Music==
{{Main|Lightyear (soundtrack)}}
Recurrent [[Pixar]] composer [[Michael Giacchino]] was announced to compose the score for the film, marking his eighth collaboration with the company and the second time he would score an installment to one of their film franchises that is traditionally scored by [[Randy Newman]], after ''[[Cars 2]]''. He previously scored the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' television specials ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''. The score was recorded over 15 days, requiring a 39-member choir and an 89-piece orchestra. A track titled "Mission Perpetual" was released as a single on [[June 3]], [[2022]]. Giacchino said the track was his favorite to work on the film, describing it as a challenge due to the music needing to convey [[Buzz Lightyear]]'s frustration, sadness, and determination through the sequence. The soundtrack was released on [[June 17]], 2022 through [[Walt Disney Records]].

==Release==
''Lightyear'' premiered on [[June 8]], [[2022]] and was theatrically released in the United States on [[June 17]], [[2022]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, and [[IMAX]] formats. It is the first theatrical release for Pixar in two years, since ''[[Soul]]'', ''[[Luca]]'', and ''[[Turning Red]]'' were assigned direct-to-streaming releases on [[Disney+]] in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Reception==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 75% approval rating with an average rating of 6.70/10, based on 246 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Lightyear'' settles for being a rather conventional origin story instead of reaching for the stars, but this gorgeously animated adventure ably accomplishes its mission of straightforward fun." Metacritic reports a score of 60 out of 100 based on 57 critic reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

The film has received criticism from some who have argued that the film's scene with a same-sex kiss, as well as [[Alisha Hawthorne]]'s relationship with her partner, is inappropriate for children (as the ''Toy Story'' franchise's target audience is primarily families and children).

===Box office===
As of June 19, 2022, ''Lightyear'' has grossed $50.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $34.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $85.2 million.

In the United States and Canada, ''Lightyear'' was originally projected to gross $70–85 million from 4,255 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates reaching as high as $105 million. However, after making just $20.7 million on its first day (including $5.2 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were lowered to $51–55 million. It went on to debut to $50.6 million, finishing second behind holdover ''Jurassic World Dominion''. Additionally, the film earned $34.6 million from 43 international markets, bringing its worldwide three-day debut to $85.2 million. Both ''Deadline Hollywood'' and ''Variety'' attributed the under-performance to competition from ''Minions: The Rise of Gru'', ''Jurassic World'' and ''Top Gun: Maverick'', though ultimately noted it as a disappointment given the brand strength of both Pixar and the ''Toy Story'' series.

***When the movie was announced, many people were thrown into great confusion over it.

Disney later clarified on Twitter that this was not the case, with Evans being the voice of the in-universe character that inspired the toy, and Allen being the voice of the toy.<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/movies/chris-evans-responds-to-buzz-lightyear-confusion-over-e2-80-98replacing-e2-80-99-tim-allen-in-toy-story-spin-off/ar-BB1bQhM4]</ref>

*James Brolin is the father of [[Josh Brolin]], who starred alongside Chris Evans and Taika Waititi in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]: Evans and Waititi played [[Captain America|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] and [[Korg]], whilst Brolin played [[Thanos]]. Waititi also directed ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]''.
*The text at the start confirms that the first ''[[Toy Story]]'' film takes place in [[1995]], the year it was released.
*Angus MacLane used [[LEGO]] pieces and elements to create mock-ups of the various spaceships seen in ''Lightyear''. The models were then used by the movie's artists and animators as a starting point for the designs of the final vehicles.
*This is the third movie that changes its aspect ratio with the first being ''[[Brother Bear]]'' and the second being ''[[Enchanted]]''.

===Easter eggs and references===
*Just like Chris Evans character, [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], the ''Lightyear'' version of Buzz ends up in the future over eighty-nine years later.
*To ''[[Toy Story]],'' ''[[Toy Story 2]],'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'':
**Darby is seen wearing a Space Ranger uniform that belonged to a ranger named Tempus, a nod to one of Buzz's earlier names Tempus from Morph.
**The camera pulling away from Sox and inbetween Buzz's legs, then pulling up to see Buzz in a heroic pose is a nod to his introduction in ''Toy Story''.
**Like in ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', Buzz's reflection is shown on the inside of his helmet.
**Buzz quotes a number of lines that he (and [[Ultra Buzz Lightyear|Utility Belt Buzz]] from ''Toy Story 2'') originally said in the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' franchise (besides his signature catchphrase, "To infinity and beyond").
***'''''Toy Story and Toy Story 2:''''' "Buzz Lightyear mission log."
***'''''Toy Story:''''' "Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. There seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere."
***'''''Toy Story:''''' "You're mocking me, aren't you?"
***'''''Toy Story:''''' "Blast!"
***'''''Toy Story:''''' "My ship!"
***'''''Toy Story:''''' "Buzz Lightyear to [[Star Command]]. Come in, Star Command. Star Command, come in. Why don't they answer?"
***'''''Toy Story 2:''''' "Not today, Zurg!"
***'''''Toy Story 2:''''' "I'm Buzz Lightyear, I'm always sure!"
**Zurg also quotes a few lines from the ''Toy Story'' franchise.
***'''''Toy Story 2:''''' "Prepare to die!"
**Buzz's ship is shown to be powered by a crystal. This is likely an homage to how in ''Toy Story'', where Buzz asks Woody if his people have yet to discover crystallic fusion.
**The red cones that the characters get trapped in are a reference to the traffic cones that the toys use to cross the road in ''Toy Story 2''.
**Buzz telling Featheringhamsten that he will not speak unless spoken to is a callback to one of the rules that Buzz, after being reprogrammed by [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]] and his gang, explains to the rest of Andy's toys after they are imprisoned at [[Sunnyside Daycare]] in ''Toy Story 3''.
**A [[Little Green Men|Little Green Man]] appears on Burnside's shelf during a post-credits scene.
**The ship Buzz and his team take off in at the end of the film resembles the spaceship box that all the Buzz Lightyear toys are packed in, in ''Toy Story'' and ''Toy Story 2''.
**Buzz initially mistakes Zurg for his father, which the emperor claimed he was in ''Toy Story 2''.
*To ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'':
**When Alisha catches Buzz doing a mission log, she tells him nobody ever listens to them. In ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]'', [[Warp Darkmatter]] made the same remark about mission logs.
**One of the crew members listened as Buzz prepares his first flight is named Booster, a nod to [[Booster Munchapper]], one of Buzz' teammates from the series.
**The ending of the film has Buzz and his new team shouting "To Infinity and Beyond!" as they fly to a new adventure, much like the ending of ''The Adventure Begins''.
**Zurg's identity as an alternate future's Buzz trying to meddle in his past self's time period recalls the [[Evil Buzz Lightyear]] that occupied Zurg's Evil Emperor role in his home universe. Additionally, a future version of Buzz appeared in an episode of ''Star Command''. 
**The number on Izzy's suit is 42, the same number as Buzz' ship in ''Star Command''.
*The [[Pizza Planet Truck]] can be seen parked near a garage when Buzz is being driven to the launch site so he can partake in the flight test.
*[[Luxo, Jr. (character)|Luxo, Jr.]] can be spotted as a constellation during one of Buzz's flight tests.
*One of the jetpacks seen at the base resembles the [[Mandalorian]] jetpacks from the ''Star Wars'' franchise.
*A crate resembling [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] in his cube-shaped body can be seen outside of the abandoned hangar where Buzz and Sox go in to find a new ship. Another crate like this is seen in a part of the mining facility as it breaks apart.
*The protective armor in Mo's suit resembles the bunch of grapes that falls on one of the ants at the beginning of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''.
*Some [[Scream Canister|scream canisters]] from ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' can be seen in the abandoned hangar, near where the Space Ranger suits are stored.
*[[M-O]], [[BURN-E (character)|BURN-E]], and a Little Green Man makes a cameo in a post-credits scene on Burnside's shelf.
*A [[Hidden Mickey]] appears in the form of some balloons on Alisha's 40th anniversary celebration party.
*The spaceships' launching area resembles the [[Space Mountain]] attractions at the Disney parks.
*A drink labeled "Wade Water", showing its mascot Wade, is a reference to Pixar's next upcoming film, ''[[Elemental]]''.
