'''''Spies in Disguise''''' is a [[2019]] American computer-animated spy comedy film produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] and distributed by [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]]. Loosely based on the 2009 animated short, ''Pigeon: Impossible'' by Lucas Martell, the film is directed by Troy Quane and Nick Bruno (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Brad Copeland and Lloyd Taylor, and a story by Cindy Davis.

The plot follows a secret agent (Will Smith) who is accidentally transformed into a pigeon by an intelligent young scientist (Tom Holland); the two must then work together to stop a revenge-seeking cybernetic terrorist (Ben Mendelsohn) and return the agent to his human form.

The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on December 4, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2019. It has grossed $171 million worldwide and it received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, music, humor, and vocal performances (particularly Smith and Holland). It was [[Blue Sky Studios]]’ final animated film, before it was shut down by Disney in [[2021]].

==Plot==
Lance Sterling, a cocky secret agent of H.T.U.V. (Honor, Trust, Unity, and Valor), is sent to recover an attack drone from Japanese arms dealer Katsu Kimura in Japan. As soon as the buyer, cybernetically enhanced terrorist Killian, arrives, Sterling breaks in against the orders of H.T.U.V. director Joy Jenkins, defeats Kimura and his gang, and manages to escape with what he believes is the briefcase containing the drone. Sterling returns to H.T.U.V. headquarters to confront Walter Beckett, a socially inept M.I.T. graduate, and outcast young scientist, for equipping nonlethal weapons into his suit. Walter tries to convince Sterling that there is a more peaceful way to save the world, but Sterling fires him.

Sterling discovers the briefcase to be empty and is confronted by Marcy Kappel, a security forces agent, who reveals footage of Sterling (actually Killian in a holographic disguise) leaving with the drone, labeling him as a traitor. Sterling escapes the H.T.U.V. and decides to track down Walter to help him disappear. Meanwhile, Killian breaks into the H.T.U.V. weapons facility.

While searching Walter's home for his invention, Sterling unknowingly ingests the concoction and transforms into a pigeon. Before Walter can try to change him back, Marcy and other H.T.U.V. agents chase the duo through the city, but they escape in Sterling's spy car. The two track down Kimura to a resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. There, they learn of Killian's whereabouts in Venice, Italy, before Marcy and the H.T.U.V. can capture them again. On their way to Venice, Walter attempts to make an antidote but fails.

Arriving in Venice, Walter is confronted by the H.T.U.V., who are unaware of Sterling's condition. Revealing that she knows about Wendy, Walter's mother, a police officer who died on duty, Marcy tries to convince him to help turn Sterling in, but Walter refuses. Suddenly, a drone distracts the H.T.U.V. and allows Walter and Sterling to escape. The two discover the drone carrying the H.T.U.V. agent database, and Walter manages to retrieve it. However, Killian shows up, takes the database, and prepares to kill Walter, but with help from hundreds of hungry pigeons in the surrounding area, they distract Killian and flee. Disguised as Sterling once more, Killian escapes the H.T.U.V., shaking Marcy's suspicions of Sterling upon her seeing him with a robot hand.

While underwater in a submarine, Walter reveals he planted a tracking device on Killian and locates him at the weapons facility. Walter manages to perfect the antidote and successfully turns Sterling human again. Reaching Killian's hideout, Sterling, concerned about Walter's safety, sends him away in the submarine. Once inside, Sterling confronts Killian but is defeated and captured as Killian reveals he has mass-produced hundreds of drones to target everyone at the agency using the database to kill his crew in a past mission led by Sterling. Noticing Walter returning in the submarine, Killian destroys it; unbeknownst to them, Walter survives with one of his inventions.

Once Walter frees Sterling, the two escape and contacts Marcy for support as the drones approach H.T.U.V. headquarters in Washington D.C. Walter attempts to hack into Killian's bionic arm. When Killian realizes this, he tries to flee with a drone, but Walter catches up. Walter risks his life by trapping Killian in one of his protective gadgets and deactivates the villain's arm as he falls, but Sterling, who has turned himself back into a pigeon, flies for the first time and carries him to safety with help from other pigeons, and Killian is found and arrested.

Despite saving the world, Sterling and Walter are nearly fired for disobedience. However, they are later reinstated by the H.T.U.V. as the agency could learn from Walter's more peaceful ways of handling villainy.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 117 reviews, and an average rating of 6.47/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A cheerfully undemanding animated adventure that's elevated by its voice cast, ''Spies in Disguise'' is funny, fast-paced, and family-friendly enough to satisfy."

==Trivia==
*This is the last [[Blue Sky Studios]] film to have the opening credits since ''Rio''.
*This is the first and only Blue Sky Studios film to include the usage of a swear word (However, this was censored), with this happening at some stage when Lance & Walter escape the H.T.U.V agents after questioning Kimura.
*This is the first animated film from [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] to be released after the Disney purchase.
**Additionally, this is the only [[Blue Sky Studios]] film to be released after the Disney purchase, due to the studio's closure in April 2021. However, it was not the last production from that studio, as its final production was its only short series ''[[Ice Age: Scrat Tales]]''.
*This was the last 20th Century animated film to be under the name 20th Century Fox, to which would be renamed "20th Century Studios" a month later.
*The film's release date has been changed several times. It was originally set to come out on January 18th, 2019, but was then pushed back to April 19th, then moved to September 13th, 2019. On May 10, the release got pushed back once more to Christmas Day 2019, to accommodate the release of Fox's ''[[Ad Astra]]'' which was moved to the September date.
*This movie does not feature "Twentieth Century Fox Animation Presents" and "A Blue Sky Studios Production" in neither the opening nor closing.
*This is [[Will Smith]]'s second animated film role after DreamWorks Animation's 2004 feature film ''Shark Tale''.
*This is the sixth time [[Tom Holland]] uses an American accent for his role after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (all of in which he played [[Spider-Man]] (aka Peter Parker).
**This is also his first time using an animated role, not counting the UK English dub of ''[[The Secret World of Arrietty]]'' (under the simple title ''Arrietty'' in that country).
**Another reference is at the M.I.T. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) where [[Walter Beckett]] graduates at a young age, like [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] before him, which is subtle since Tony Stark is [[Spider-Man]]'s mentor and Tom Holland and the MIT appear at ''Captain America: Civil War''. Although, all this may be a coincidence.
*This is [[Olly Murs]]' first animated film role and his second animated role after previously voicing [[Spike (101 Dalmatian Street)|Spike]] in ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]''.
*This was the second film in [[2019]] to have a character played by [[Will Smith]] turn into a form that's colored blue. The first film was ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'' (2019).
**This was also the second film of 2019 to feature a character played by Tom Holland that visits Venice and fights a villain with drones. The first film being ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.
*This is the first 20th Century Fox (and only Blue Sky Studios) film to use the 2019 MPA logo in the end credits.
*The video about a love story that Walter watches near the beginning and the end of a film is in Korean.
*Walter's stuffed unicorn toy, Unitee, parodies [[Winnie the Pooh]], Princess Celestia from ''My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'', and Tenderheart Bear from ''Care Bears''. Unitee can be found on Walter's childhood pajamas at the beginning of the movie and on a security blanket that gets launched towards the end.
*Walter's face in the sun during Lance’s transformation to a pigeon is a reference to the pre-school series ''Teletubbies''.
*''Scooby Doo'' is mentioned three times in the dialogue, twice by Ears, and once by Marcy.
*The car falling from the bridge scene is a reference to ''[[Finding Dory]]''.
*The song [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(They_Long_to_Be)_Close_to_You "(They Long to Be) Close to You]" by the Carpenters can be heard in the car falling down slow-motion scene.
**However, this is the Sally Stevens cover, rather than the original version by the Carpenters.
**This is the second animated Fox film to use the song, after ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie The Simpsons Movie]'' (2007).

==Production==
It was announced on October 9, 2017, that development was underway on a film based on the animated short Pigeon: Impossible, with Will Smith and Tom Holland lending their voices to the lead characters.

In October 2018, new additions to the voice cast included Ben Mendelsohn, Karen Gillan, Rashida Jones, DJ Khaled and Masi Oka. In July 2019, Reba McEntire and Rachel Brosnahan joined the cast. In September 2019, Carla Jimenez joined the cast.
