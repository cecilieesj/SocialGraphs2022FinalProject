==Plot==
In a world where 12 year old Michael Gerber has no friends, he finds that sometimes, the best friendships come from within. Michael is an awkward young boy who is about to start junior high and has no real friends. His only companion is an imaginary friend he calls Fuzzbucket. In the first act of the film, both the viewer and every character except Michael is left to make the assumption that Fuzzbucket is an imaginary friend. When Michael cooks up a strange, green concoction for his friend to drink, Fuzzbucket turns visible again. Astonished to see Fuzzbucket for the first time, young Michael becomes overjoyed. His newly visible friend exuberantly leaps around Michael's treehouse in celebration and thinks of Michael like a blood brother. At Fuzzbucket's urgent request for "Toons! Toons!" Michael switches on his television and the two sit together watching classic cartoons, and they soon drift off to sleep. Hours later, Fuzzbucket awakens and insists on knowing the time. He urgently cries to Michael, "How many clocks? How many clocks!?" Fearing that if he doesn't make it back home in time he will turn invisible again, only this time it will be forever. Fuzzbucket leaps out of the treehouse and escapes into the woods. Michael, afraid of losing his one and only friend, takes off after him. His family soon becomes worried that he's run away from home and spend the day and into the night searching for him. By next morning, Michael has trailed Fuzzbucket into the country fields, still unable to find him. Falling down a hole in the ground, Michael becomes lost in an underground labyrinth and screams for help. Fuzzbucket cheerfully appears and explains that he wasn't abandoning Michael, simply going home and that he would always be Michael's friend. Michael is brought back to the surface where his family soon finds him and takes him home.

==Characters==
