'''''Donald's Snow Fight '''''is an animated short starring [[Donald Duck]].

==Synopsis==
The short begins with Donald wiping the fog off his glass door, excited to see the snow. Wearing a fur overcoat, Donald goes out to play with a sled while singing "Jingle Bells". When Donald reaches the top of the hill, he notices his nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, at the bottom, building a snowman while singing "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow". Tempted, Donald crashes his sled into their snowman and thus his nephews, resulting in each of them "wearing" a part of their snowman. Donald laughs himself silly afterwards, which prompts the angry trio to plot revenge.

The nephews craft another snowman, this one a silly-looking one that vaguely looks like Donald, around a boulder before calling out "Here's Uncle Donald!". Irked by the unflattering caricature, Donald attempts to crash the snowman, only to crash into the boulder underneath it, destroying his sled and the shockwave shaking off all of the furs on his overcoat, save for one, that Donald touches with his finger to stop its shaking and pulls out. The nephews happily laugh themselves silly, prompting an angry Donald to chase after them, blowing snow off a couple making out on a park bench in the process. Eventually, the nephews escape into an ice fortress that they made, with Donald crashing into the bedspring drawbridge, sending him flying backwards and crashing into a tree, causing the ice on it to come down around him like cage as he is covered in snow to make him look like a rhino. At the nephews sing "London Bridge", Donald bursts out of the ice and snow before declaring war on the boys by building himself a snow battleship.

Donald starts off the war with a small barrage of snowballs, which results in the nephews looking like bowling pins. Donald then uses a bowling ball-like snowball to strike them out. Donald then pulls out a bucket of water, dips a snow chunk in it, and creates an ice missile (which he calls "Big Bertha".) He launches it teeter-totter style and it splits his nephews' flagpole into three sections, "spanking" all three of them. Despite the pain they endured, the nephews angrily refuse to surrender to Donald and instead started creating snow missiles of their own while getting three other objects: a picnic basket, some rope, and some mouse traps. They place the mouse traps inside the rocket-shaped projectiles and stick them in the picnic basket now with the string tied to it. Huey, Dewey, and Louie soon launch the basket and release the missiles, with Donald getting hit by several of them, burying him and covering him in mouse traps, which sends him into his usual tantrum. With Huey commanding them with a wooden sword, Louie and Dewey started launching snowballs from a catapult, much to Donald's frustration ("That's unconstitutional," quacks the duck angrily), with one of them even sending him through the wall of the top of his ship, and making a snow-like impression of his head.

The nephews then spear hot coal onto arrows (while singing the "Battle Hymn of the Republic") and launch them into the top of the battleship as well, creating a skull-like structure around Donald. As a final attack, they launch a huge flaming piece of coal into the base of Donald's ship. As Donald declares he'll exterminating the boys, he realizes his ship is starting to melt, with only the mast he's standing on remaining, with it eventually melting away as well, leaving Donald to fall into the hole in the frozen lake below, resulting in him being frozen in a prison of ice from the splash. To celebrate their victory, the triplets perform a (stereotypical) ceremonious Native American dance around the icicle.
