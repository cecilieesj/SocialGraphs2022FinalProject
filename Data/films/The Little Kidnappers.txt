'''The Little Kidnappers''' is a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation-Disney Channel film that tells the story of orphans Harry and Davy MacKenzie (Leo Wheatley and Charles Miller) and their grandfather, James MacKenzie ([[Charlton Heston]]). Based on the [[1953]] film of the same name, it was shot in several locations throughout Nova Scotia with dockside scenes being filmed aboard the ''Acadia'' at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. <ref>[http://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/filmography "CSS Acadia Filmography", ''Maritime Museum of the Atlantic'']</ref>

Coralee Elliott Testar's version of the story revolves around letters written by James' son to his wife and children and what Harry and Davy bring with them in a box carved by James for his son. Through these letters, he finds healing from the grief he feels over the death of his son at the hands of Dutch soldiers in the Second Boer War in South Africa and deliverance from the hatred in his heart for those of Dutch ancestry.

The movie's title refers to the discovery and rescue by Harry and Davy of a baby left on a beach and their decision to hide and care for it themselves rather than risk their grandfather's harsh and unmerciful reaction to it.
