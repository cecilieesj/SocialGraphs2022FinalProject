'''''Oscar''''' is a [[1991]] American comedy film directed by John Landis. Based on the Claude Magnier stage play, it is a remake of the [[1967]] French film of the same name, but the settings has been moved to the Depression era [[New York City]] and centers around a mob boss trying to go straight. The film stars [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Marisa Tomei]], Ornella Muti, [[Tim Curry]], and [[Chazz Palminteri]] and was a rare attempt by Stallone at doing a comedy role.

==Plot==
In the prologue, gangster Angelo "Snaps" Provolone promises his dying father ([[Kirk Douglas]]) that he will give up a life of crime, and instead "go straight".

A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bank’s board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that he’s in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually "Snaps's daughter." Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa.

Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the world’s great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry "Snaps's daughter"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now out of the country.

Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' dialectician.

Meanwhile, local police lieutenant Toomey is keeping an eye on the mansion, believing that Snaps is meeting with [[Chicago]] mobsters soon. Also watching Snaps is mob rival Vendetti, who, too, believes that Snaps is meeting Chicago mobsters. Vendetti plans a hit on Snaps in the early afternoon while Toomey plans a raid at the same time to catch Snaps red-handed.

While Anthony seeks out Theresa, Snaps meets his mansion's new maid, Roxie. As it turns out, Roxie is an old flame of Snaps, and the pair talk memories and the life that never was. Theresa comes to the mansion and is revealed to be Roxie's daughter - who was actually fathered by Snaps long ago - making Snaps her dad after all. The impromptu celebration of both his daughters' engagements is cut short by the arrival of the bankers. During the meeting, Snaps senses the bankers are giving him a raw deal. The meeting is interrupted by police officers and Toomey, who is embarrassed to find no money or gangsters present on site. He leaves the mansion just in time for Vendetti's car full of armed men to crash right outside. Toomey smiles for reporters and arrests the men.

With no hope to actually become a banker, Snaps decides to abandon his short-lived honest ways and return to a life of crime. The final scene of the movie shows a double wedding for both his daughters. Oscar himself finally appears and objects to Lisa's marriage, but he is carried off by Snaps' men and the weddings end happily.

==Production==
The film is directed as if it were a film of that time, with humor and dialogue delivered in a manner reminiscent of old Hollywood comedies, particularly the "screwball" genre. Director John Landis had said
:{{cquote|''Oscar'' is a farce set in 1931, sort of Damon Runyan meets Feydeau. I shot the picture in a deliberately stylized manner, attempting a thirties Hollywood comedy look and feel (Peter Riegart, at one point, actually says, ''Why I oughta...'')}}

===The little black bags===
The multiple subplots of the film are linked together using a plot device: three identical black suitcases that are mistaken for each other. One suitcase contains jewels that Antony Rossano purchased after he stole $50k from Snaps. The second suitcase contains Nora's underwear. The third suitcase contains another $50k, this time in cash, which Rossano stole from Snaps. The bags are misidentified several times before eventually being brought together, much like the four identical plaid overnight cases (containing rock specimens; underwear; jewelry; and cash) in the 1972 screwball comedy, ''What's Up, Doc?''.

Two different scenes have Snaps trying to give either jewels or cash to the doctor but instead opens up the suitcase to find underwear. The bags are switched out a number of different times with the intention of returning Nora's underwear to her and the jewels/cash to Snaps, but by the end Nora has both the suitcase with the jewels and the suitcase with the cash. This leaves only the suitcase with the underwear in the house when the NYPD arrive to start making accusations. Toomey opens up the bag of underwear as reporters snap photos.

==Cast==
*[[Sylvester Stallone]] as Angelo "Snaps" Provolone is a feared gangster who, at the beginning of the film, promises his dying father that he will give up a life of crime, and instead "go straight".
*Ornella Muti as Sofia Provolone: Snaps' wife.
*[[Marisa Tomei]] as Lisa Provolone: the only child of Snaps and Sofia. Lisa is a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the world’s great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant.
*Vincent Spano as Anthony Rossano: the kind yet wily accountant of Snaps. Anthony’s early morning arrival to the mansion sets all events in motion. Anthony tells his boss that he’s in love, asks for a monumental raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually "Snaps's daughter." After Anthony professes his love for the daughter, Snaps agrees to let him and his daughter marry. What Anthony soon learns is this: The woman he fell in love with is not actually Snaps' daughter, but was merely pretending to be.
*Elizabeth Barondes as Theresa: revealed later to be Snaps illegitimate daughter via Roxanne.
*[[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Thornton Poole: a linguistics expert who arrives for an elocution lesson with Snaps. Poole is a world traveler, who giddily traverses the country in his studies of the sub-dialects of the English language.

Snaps recognizes Roxanne (“Roxy”), as the two are actually former lovers who had a fling many years ago, before Snaps became a gangster.

Connie then puts all the facts together and reveals that Theresa is actually Snaps’ real daughter from a relationship 20 years ago.
