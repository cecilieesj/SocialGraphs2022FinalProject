A luminous, ethereal stag bounds effortlessly through a dark expanse of the universe, leaving a galaxy of stars in its wake. When it accidentally creates a black hole that threatens to devour everything in sight, the stag is forced to make a decision that will leave a lasting impression.

A Stag prances throughout the universe creating constellations of scorpions, archers and a lyre to color the ever dark expanse. As he watches his work, he notices small spots on his antlers. As he tries to shake them off, he accidentally creates a black hole that begins to suck up all of his hard work.

The Stag attempts to stop the constellations from being sucked in, but he damages one of his antlers. He finally decides to make a running charge at the black hole, resulting in a large explosion. The constellations are now back in the sky, but at the cost of the Stag who has become a whole new galaxy that encompasses them.
