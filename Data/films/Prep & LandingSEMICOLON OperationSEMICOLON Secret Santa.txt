[[Wayne]] and [[Lanny]], now partners, are called by [[Magee]] to meet with a secret contact – [[Mrs. Claus]], who sends them on a new mission to retrieve a box from [[Santa Claus|Santa]]'s secret workshop. Later they sneak into Santa's office while he is asleep, using their high tech equipment from the previous film. Lanny’s expertise at dressing the tree enables them to enter the hidden workshop where they recover the box and escape just in time. Mrs Claus reveals the contents of the box to be the last part of the first toy that Santa ever made, and gives the complete toy back to him as his Christmas Present.
