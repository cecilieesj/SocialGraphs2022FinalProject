'''''Frozen Fever''''' is an animated short sequel to the [[2013]] film, ''[[Frozen]]''. The short was announced on [[September 2]], [[2014]] as part of ''[[The Story of Frozen: Making a Disney Animated Classic]]''. It featured "[[Making Today a Perfect Day|Making Today A Perfect Day]]", a new and original song written by [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] and [[Robert Lopez]]. 

The short premiered in theatres on [[March 13]], [[2015]] alongside [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s live-action film, ''[[Cinderella (2015 film)|Cinderella]]''.

==Plot==
[[Elsa]] is super excited to celebrate the 19th birthday of her sister [[Anna]], and intends for her sister's birthday to be perfect. Using her ice powers, Elsa attempts to create ice figurines on top of Anna's birthday cake: her final choice are figurines of Anna and Elsa ice-skating cheerfully together. [[Kristoff]] makes a banner, hung up across the castle courtyard, which reads "Happy Birthday Anna". Elsa and Kristoff spend all morning preparing everything. Before dashing off to wake up Anna, Elsa leaves Kristoff in charge of looking after everything until the guest of honor arrives.

Elsa tiptoes into Anna's bedroom and gently nudges her younger sister, who is still sleeping. Anna struggles to wake up but after being told about the day Elsa has planned for them, she immediately jumps out of bed. When Elsa sneezes, neither of the sisters notice that two tiny [[Snowgies|snowmen]] fall to the floor and scampered off. Starting off the day, Elsa uses her magic to create sparkly new dresses for each of them before heading out on a mystery tour which involves following a long string that Elsa had wound through the castle, leading Anna to different gifts. Inside a suit of armour, Anna finds a bracelet. Inside an armoire, she finds an Olaf cuckoo clock, and on a balcony, a bouquet of sunflowers. Elsa sneezes again and more little snowmen tumble to the ground, but still the girls don't notice. The snowmen scurry into the courtyard where [[Olaf]] finds them and is thrilled to see them. Anna and Elsa follow the string all over [[Arendelle]]. Along the way, Anna discovers more presents: a sandwich, family portrait, silk stockings, even a fishing pole. All the while, Elsa continues to sneeze and each time she does, more little snowmen appear and still the girls don't spot any of them. Anna is having a wonderful time but is concerned for Elsa's health. She feels she should go home and rest but Elsa declines. She leads Anna to [[Oaken]]'s shop, where she presents her with one of Oaken's beautiful heavy cloaks. Then noticing her sneezing, Oaken presents them with a bottle of medicine, which Anna accepts gratefully, knowing they may need it. Next, Elsa takes Anna to the center of the village, where a children's choir sings for Anna.

Back at the courtyard, Kristoff, [[Sven]], and Olaf try to keep things under control as more tiny snowmen run in, causing a lot of chaos and trouble for them. When Kristoff spots several little snowmen climbing up to the cake, he grabs Olaf's head like a bowling ball and takes aim. Olaf's head rolls into the snowmen, knocking them away from the cake. Suddenly, the little snowmen knock down the banner. Olaf manages to rehang the letters, but since he cannot read or spell, they spell "Dry Banana Hippy Hat" and then "Happy Hairy Ant Band".

Meanwhile, Elsa leads Anna to their last stop, where at the top of the clock tower was her last gift. Anna's arms are now overloaded with presents and Elsa's cold is getting worse. Anna insists that Elsa needs to rest, but she doesn't listen. Already she is feeling feverish as she climbs the stairs to the top of the tower to a point where she almost falls off the tower. Anna drops her gifts and rushes to catch her. She notices Elsa is burning up with a fever and needs to get into bed, which Elsa finally agrees to. As Anna escorts her [[Arendelle Castle|home]], Elsa apologizes to Anna for "ruining" another perfect birthday, but Anna tells her she hasn't, despite having a cold. Then as they enter the castle gates, Anna is surprised by Kristoff, Sven, Olaf, and the hundreds of little snowmen who present her with her birthday cake and a special birthday song. Caught up in the excitement of the song, Kristoff sings the loudest of all and bursting out "I love you, baby!", and becoming very embarrassed while a touched Anna grins at him happily. Though tired, Elsa insists on blowing the bukkehorn, and sneezes into it, launching a gigantic snowball all the way to [[the Southern Isles]], where it hits [[Hans]] as he is shoveling manure at the royal stables (and the horses laughs at him in amusement).

Afterward, Anna helps Elsa to bed and thanks her for a great birthday and giving her the best present she could ever have: Elsa letting her take care of her. High on [[the North Mountain]] where stands the [[Elsa's Ice Palace|ice palace]], [[Marshmallow]] is visited by Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, who present to him a parade of the little snowmen who would now be living with him. Marshmallow looks on in confusion and then at Kristoff. Sighing heavily, Kristoff tells Marshmallow "Don't ask."

==Trivia==
*Elsa is shown to be able to use her magic in more ways.
*This is the second short sequel to a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] movie. The first was ''[[Tangled Ever After]]''.
*This is the first time Kristoff and Elsa interact with and to speak to one another.
*This is the second time Anna is seen waking up with messy hair.
*Two of the topping decisions that Elsa created were the coronation pose and the "Anna's Frozen Death" pose from the first film.
*The scene where Elsa wakes up Anna to wish her a happy birthday is quite similar to the scene in the first film where Anna wakes up Elsa when they were young kids.
*One of the children in the choir resembles Anna as a little girl. Another girl also resembles a younger version of her mother, Iduna.
*During the opening of the song "[[Making Today a Perfect Day]]", Elsa sings the line "A cold never bothered me anyway", a reference to her hit solo song "[[Let It Go]]".
*The part where Elsa and Anna are riding a bike through the hall is a reference to the lyric "...or ride our bike around the halls?" in "[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]".
*The portrait that was received as a gift for Anna shows that the five characters are now a family.
**Prior to this, she uses the tune of the opening of the deleted Frozen song "[[Life's Too Short]]".
*Unlike the original ''[[Frozen]]'' film, which was rated PG by the MPAA, this short film is rated G instead,<ref>[http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/follows-sisters-slow-west-frozen-fever-todays-mpaa-ratings-bulletin/ 'It Follows', 'Sisters', 'Slow West' and 'Frozen Fever' in Today's MPAA Ratings Bulletin]</ref> as most Disney animated short films have that rating in the United States.
*After Anna's birthday banner falls, Olaf says "I can fix it!" in a similar manner to [[Fix-It Felix Jr.]] from ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''.
*A snowglobe stall features mini versions of some Frozen 'landmarks', such as one of the Arendelle castle towers, also seen in the background, and the North Mountain.
*A Snowgie with the face of [[Baymax]] from ''[[Big Hero 6]]'' can briefly be seen.
*The portrait featuring the main cast was inspired by the site AwkwardFamilyPhotos.com and its content.<ref>[http://entertainthis.usatoday.com/2015/02/03/its-official-frozen-cast-takes-the-most-awkward-family-photo/]</ref>
*According to [[Jennifer Lee]], Elsa wears a green dress for much of this short (using her magic to turn her signature blue dress green) specifically to dispel the perception held by fans that Elsa consciously only ever wears blue.
*This is the only ''Frozen'' production not to be converted for 3-D viewing, due to theatrically preceding a non-3D film.
*Elsa's Snow Queen dress that she's still wearing in the original ''Frozen'' appears for about 2 minutes and 20 seconds until she uses her magic to change the colours to her summer dress on Anna's 19th Birthday.
*Elsa's Summer dress looks similar to Anna's coronation dress in the original Frozen. The Summer dress still has the slit, the ice heels (turned to Dark emerald green from blue) and the crystal sleeves turned into light green/short sleeves.
*The short takes place almost a year after [[Frozen|the original film]] and just over two years before the sequel, [[Frozen II|''Frozen II'']].

==Goofs==
*Sven is holding four buckets of paint on his antlers to help Kristoff make the banner until Elsa is about to scold Olaf, but when the bells chimed and cuts back to Kristoff and Sven, the buckets have disappeared.
*When Olaf is sitting on a table and says to Kristoff and Sven that he cannot read or spell, he still has blue frosting on his mouth, but when he, Kristoff, and Sven fall asleep, his mouth is clean.
*The letters from the banner "Happy Birthday Anna" get rearranged twice and formed "Dry Banana Hippy Hat" and "Happy Hairy Ant Band", but when Anna and Elsa return and everyone shouts "Surprise!", the banner is rearranged once more to its original message.
*When Kristoff slides off Sven and bursts out singing to Anna, he is still standing on a mound of Snowgies, but when the Snowgies bring the cake to him and uses his antlers to cut slices, he is standing on the ground.
