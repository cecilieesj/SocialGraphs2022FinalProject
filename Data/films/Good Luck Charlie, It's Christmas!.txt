'''''Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!''''' is a [[2011]] direct-to-television Christmas film based on the [[Disney Channel Original Series]] ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]''. It was directed by Arlene Sanford and written by Geoff Rodkey, and stars [[Bridgit Mendler]], [[Leigh-Allyn Baker]], [[Bradley Steven Perry]], Mia Talerico, Eric Allan Kramer, and [[Jason Dolley]] as the Duncan family. It follows them on their road trip to [[Amy Duncan|Amy]]'s parents' house for Christmas. It premiered on [[December 2]], 2011 on the [[Disney Channel]], ten years after the last Christmas original movie, ''[['Twas the Night]]'', in [[2001]]. It is known in some countries as '''''Good Luck Charlie: The Road Trip Movie'''''.

The Duncan family heads out on a holiday trip from their home in Denver to visit Amy's parents, [[Hank Blankenhooper|Hank]] and [[Petunia Blankenhooper]], who live in Palm Springs. They end up finding themselves stranded between Denver and Palm Springs. Among their other misadventures they try to hitch a ride from what seems to be a normal older couple who actually believe they are the victims of alien abduction. They resort to purchasing a clunker Yugo to get to [[Utah]], and have their luggage stolen in Las Vegas. Finally, they must survive a Christmas with Hank and Petunia.

==Plot==
The Duncan family plan to go to Hank and Petunia Blankenhopper's house in Palm Springs for Christmas. However, they are separated on route after [[Teddy Duncan|Teddy]] ([[Bridgit Mendler]]) makes a snap decision to give up her airplane seat for a free ticket for her spring break trip to [[Florida]] with her best friend, [[Ivy Wentz]]. Unwilling to let her travel alone, Amy also disembarks, only to discover that the next flight to Palm Springs departs after Christmas. Meanwhile, the rest of the family arrives there, but things arenâ€™t any easier as [[Bob Duncan|Bob]] (Eric Allen Kramer) tries to care for [[Charlie Duncan|Charlie]] (Mia Talerico) under the watchful eye of Petunia (Debra Cloris Monk), who strongly dislikes him; [[PJ Duncan|PJ]] ([[Jason Dolley]]) learns the pros and cons of the pool after getting a sunburn; and [[Gabe Duncan|Gabe]] ([[Bradley Steven Perry]]) quickly realizes the downfalls of teaching Hank (Michael James Kagan) how to play his favorite video game after Hank becomes addicted to it.

Stranded and in desperation, Teddy and Amy find unconventional ways to get to Palm Springs before Christmas, while keeping in contact with Bob via cell phone. On their journey, Teddy finds out that Amy is pregnant again when they hitch hike with two strangers who turn out to be part of an alien abduction survivors network. When they arrive in Las Vegas, they get into an argument, where Amy promptly blames Teddy for getting them lost in the first place, but they later make up. Hungry, they sing and perform Christmas carols to get money for food, as someone has stolen their luggage. Amy then wants to turn their arguments into a [[Broadway]] musical, (The next Jersey Boys). Later, they find Jordan, the girl who had stolen their luggage, and confront her. She apologizes for doing it, breaking down in tears and explaining her situation. Since she is unable to afford a plane ticket, Teddy gives her the free one so she can get home for Christmas. This gesture helps Teddy and Amy bond from their previous arguments.

PJ, Bob, and Gabe travel to Las Vegas to get Amy and Teddy, but are mistakenly kidnapped on the way and participate in a battle based on Gabe's video game so that they can return to their car. Gabe wins it by taking the "Stone of Mitrios", which he was already planning to do. In return, they get a free helicopter ride to save Teddy and Amy. Hank and Petunia then arrive with Charlie by car, and the entire family is finally reunited. Amy admits that not only did they finally get the Christmas vacation they wanted, but also that this was the best Christmas they've ever had. She then reveals that she is pregnant again, much to everyone's joy.

In the epilogue, on the way back to Denver, Gabe attempts to put the "Stone of Mitrios" in an overheard bin, but it is taken away by a flight attendant. Another one then announces the offering of a free plane ticket, which Teddy quickly accepts once again. Amy says to Bob, "Your turn", as it is his turn to go along with her in disembarking. He obediently goes after her, jokingly reminding Amy that they will be back by New Year's. She smiles in response and says that she knows they won't. A short blooper roll follows the epilogue.
