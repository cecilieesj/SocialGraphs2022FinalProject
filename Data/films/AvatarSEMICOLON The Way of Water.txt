==Production==
In 2006, Cameron stated that if ''Avatar'' was successful, he hoped to make two sequels to the film. In 2010, he said the film's widespread success confirmed that he would do so. The sequels were originally scheduled for release in December 2014 and 2015. He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups. Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work "once the novel is nailed down".<ref name="trilogy">{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Rosenberg |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/07/avatar-sequel-update-james-cameron/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Avatar' Sequels Could Shoot Back-To-Back, Story Hints In Upcoming Novel |publisher=MTV |date=August 7, 2010 |access-date=August 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814213608/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/07/avatar-sequel-update-james-cameron/ |archive-date=August 14, 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref> He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus.<ref name="3D">{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=63460 |title=Update: Cameron Talks Avatar Blu-ray/DVD Releases and Sequel |publisher=Comingsoon.net |date=February 19, 2010 |access-date=May 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222082713/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=63460 |archive-date=February 22, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest.<ref name="Day2010">{{cite news |first=Patrick Kevin |last=Day |title=James Cameron: The 'Avatar' sequel will dive into the oceans of Pandora |date=April 20, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/04/james-cameron-talks-the-enironment-the-avatar-sequel-and-more.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423014450/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/04/james-cameron-talks-the-enironment-the-avatar-sequel-and-more.html |archive-date=April 23, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref> He intended to capture footage for this sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible.<ref name="Harlow2010">{{cite news |first=John |last=Harlow |title=James Cameron commissions deep sea sub to film footage for Avatar sequel |date=September 12, 2010 |work=The Australian |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/james-cameron-commissions-deep-sea-sub-to-film-footage-for-avatar-sequel/story-e6frg6so-1225919474515 |access-date=September 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616084945/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/james-cameron-commissions-deep-sea-sub-to-film-footage-for-avatar-sequel/story-e6frg6so-1225919474515 |archive-date=June 16, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story.

The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).<ref name="NZgovt1">{{cite web |first1=Steven |last1=Joyce |author-link1=Steven Joyce |first2=Chris |last2=Finlayson |author-link2=Chris Finlayson |date=December 16, 2013 |title=Three Avatar films to be made in New Zealand |publisher=New Zealand Government |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/three-avatar-films-be-made-new-zealand |access-date=December 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120255/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/three-avatar-films-be-made-new-zealand |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jared Larson |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/16/trilogy-of-avatar-sequels-to-be-made-in-new-zealand |title=Trilogy of Avatar Sequels to Be Made in New Zealand |website=IGN |date=December 16, 2013 |access-date=December 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216112717/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/16/trilogy-of-avatar-sequels-to-be-made-in-new-zealand |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Asked about the delays of the releases of the film and its sequels, Cameron stated: {{Quote|I wouldn't call them delays. It was highly optimistic that we could start quickly until scripts are written. If there's no scripts, there's nothing, right? The scripts took four years. You can call that a delay, but it's not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we're clicking along perfectly. We're doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren't wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work.... Most of the actors, the key principals, have all read all four scripts, so they know exactly what their character arcs are, they know where they're going, they know how to modulate their arc now across the first two films.|James Cameron}} 
He was optimistic that the delays would not harm the films' success, comparing it to his films ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' and ''Aliens'', which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/james-cameron-avatar-movie-sequel-2081078 |title=James Cameron isn't worried about the gap between Avatar movies |date=May 30, 2017 |access-date=February 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701193322/https://www.nme.com/news/film/james-cameron-avatar-movie-sequel-2081078 |archive-date=July 1, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Several creatures introduced in ''Avatar Flight of Passage'' will be featured in the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://movieweb.com/avatar-sequels-pandora-theme-park-crossover/ |title=Avatar Sequels Stay on Pandora, Will Include Theme Park Crossovers |work=MovieWeb |date=August 14, 2018 |access-date=August 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814235755/https://movieweb.com/avatar-sequels-pandora-theme-park-crossover/ |archive-date=August 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>
