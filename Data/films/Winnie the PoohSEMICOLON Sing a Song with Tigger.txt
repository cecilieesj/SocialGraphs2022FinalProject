''Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! It's time to Sing a Song with Tigger. Join Tigger bouncing along memory lane as he pages through his scrapbook of fantabulous fabulous times!

==Trivia==
*Hosted by [[Tigger]], who is showing the viewer(s) his scrapbook, and invites them to play a special word game within the video itself.
*Bonus feature - ''Tiggerrific Tips on How to Make a Scrapbook!'', which is a play on the word "terrific".
**The photograph of Tigger used during said featurette is taken from "[[There's No Camp Like Home]]".
*This video was released a year after ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Sing a Song with Pooh Bear|Sing a Song with Pooh Bear]]''. There are even  similarities between them except for Tigger being the main focus instead of Pooh.
*This video was not released as a ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs|Sing-Along Songs]]'' volume, rather a "Sing a Song with...", but otherwise conforms to SAS volume standards. However, whereas ''[[Sing a Song with Pooh Bear (and Piglet Too)]]'' had a DVD release, this volume was only released on VHS.
*The sequence to "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" is reused from the [[Disney's Sing Along Songs|''Disney's Sing Along Songs'']] volume: ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!|I Love to Laugh]]'', except with updated lyrics, new orchestrations by Andy Belling and re-recorded vocals by Jim Cummings instead of Paul Winchell. Despite these changes, the original montage is still used.
*The opening is largely reused from ''Sing a Song with Pooh Bear'' and ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving|Seasons of Giving]]''; as with the latter, a chorus rendition of "Winnie the Pooh" plays over the footage.
*The end of the video contains clips from films that were soon to be released as part of the ''[[Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection]]'' line.
