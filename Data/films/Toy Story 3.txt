'''''Toy Story 3''''' is a [[2010]] American 3-D computer-animated adventure comedy-drama film, which was produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. As the third film in the ''[[Toy Story]]'' franchise, the sequel to ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the 11th movie made by Pixar, the film was released in theaters on [[June 18]], [[2010]]. [[Lee Unkrich]], who edited the previous films and co-directed the [[Toy Story 2|second]] film, took over as director.

Like the previous films, ''Toy Story 3'' was widely acclaimed and a massive box office success, grossing $1.066 billion worldwide against a $200 million budget. This success made ''Toy Story 3'' eventually become the fourth highest-grossing film of all time worldwide at the time of the film‘s release (behind ''Avatar'', ''Titanic'', and ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King''), the highest-grossing Disney film (surpassing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''), until it was surpassed by ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012, the highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide (surpassing ''Shrek 2''), until it was surpassed by ''[[Frozen]]'' in 2013 and the highest-grossing Pixar film (surpassing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'') until it was surpassed by ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' in 2018. The film earned  five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, and won two for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for ''[[We Belong Together]]''. The film was nominated for "Favorite Animated Movie" at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Kids%27_Choice_Awards#Movies 2011 Kids' Choice Awards], but lost to ''Despicable Me''. After the success of the third film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' was released in theaters on [[June 21]], [[2019]].

==Plot==
''Toy Story 3'' is set in 2007 after ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' in 1997 for ten years. The movie opens shortly after ''Toy Story 2'', with an action sequence in the Wild West, in which [[Mr. Potato Head|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Potato Head]] (acting as [[Mr. Potato Head|One-Eyed Bart]] and [[Mrs. Potato Head|One-Eyed Betty]]) are committing a train robbery until [[Woody]] appears to stop the crime. Woody is knocked off the train by One-Eyed Betty, only to be caught by [[Jessie]] riding [[Bullseye]]. Then, Bart and Betty set off explosives that destroy a bridge and make their escape in their car driven by the Aliens. Woody tries to save the orphans (trolls), but the train falls off the bridge with Woody still inside. Suddenly, the entire train is lifted high into the air and saved by [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], who then disintegrates One-Eyed Bart and Betty's getaway car with his laser. This leads to a standoff between Woody, Buzz, and Jessie against the One-Eyed's and the aliens, made more fierce when One-Eyed Bart releases [[Slinky Dog|Slinky]] (playing the ''[[Slinky Dog#Attack Dog With A Built-In Force Field|Attack Dog With A Built-In Force Field]]''), and Woody responds by releasing [[Rex]]. Suddenly, [[Hamm]] (playing the Evil Dr. Porkchop), flies into view in his airship and he picks up the One-Eyed couple and their associates and presses a button labeled "[[Barrel of Monkeys|Death By Monkeys]]". A huge army of monkeys are released, and they quickly swarm and take down Rex before capturing Woody, Buzz, and Jessie and holding them down. Just as One-Eyed Bart is about to press the "Death" button to kill the heroes, the sequence ends and goes into [[Andy's House#Andy's Room|Andy's room]], revealing that it was all simply the imagination of Andy. A series of home video clips of [[Andy Davis|Andy]] is then screened, showing him growing up and playing with his toys through the years.

The film then arrives in its present setting, roughly about 10 years since the events of the ''Toy Story 2'' back in 1997. Andy is now a 17 and a half-year old, having graduated from high school, and is now just three days away from heading off to college. Many of his old toys were either sold in yard sales, donated or trashed (notably mentioned by Woody are [[Wheezy]] etch and [[Bo Peep]]) and now its just Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, Slinky, the Magic 8-Ball, the three Aliens, [[Sarge (Toy Story)|Sarge]], and two other [[Green Army Men]] remain having spent the majority of their time in a toy chest. After a failed long-shot attempt to make Andy notice them and possibly play with them one last time, the toys worry about their fate... they could be taken to college, given away, stored in the attic or even thrown away. The toys are reluctant but commit to Woody's idea of them being stored in the attic, though the Army men quickly abandon them, believing they will get thrown away into the trash instead. Andy, however, plans to take Woody to college with him and put the others in the attic, but after helping his sister [[Molly Davis|Molly]] (now a pre-teen) with a box of toys to be donated, including her [[Barbie]] doll, he leaves the bag containing his toys in the hallway and his mother accidentally takes them to the curb, thinking it's trash.

Woody goes to save his friends from the garbage and an adult [[Sid Phillips|Sid]], (trying to have [[Buster]] help, but he cannot due to the fact that he is very old and weak), but it turns out that the toys escaped and are hiding in the hatch of the Davis car, thinking Andy doesn't want them anymore. Jessie soon finds the box of Molly's toys to be donated to [[Sunnyside Daycare]] and convinces them to be donated there. Woody finds them and tries to explain to the toys that they were accidentally thrown away, but before he can finish the explanation, Andy's mom closes the rear hatch door and drives to Sunnyside.

The gang arrives at Sunnyside just as the children leave for recess. The Sunnyside toys welcome Andy's toys with open arms, including the leader of the daycare, [[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear]] ''(or "Lotso")'', [[Big Baby]], and a smooth-talking [[Ken]] doll, who instantly falls in love with Barbie who returns his feelings. The toys are keen on starting a new life at the daycare, except for Woody, who thinks that the toys shouldn't turn their back on Andy so quickly.

The toys think Woody should stay with them at Sunnyside, but Woody reluctantly leaves without them to return to Andy. He escapes from Sunnyside using a kite, but ends up losing his hat and getting stuck in a tree. Woody is found by a little girl from the daycare named [[Bonnie Anderson]] and taken home (without his hat). After Woody leaves, the rest of the toys are placed in the Caterpillar Room at the daycare and are looking forward to getting played with. However, while Andy's toys place themselves at points around the room where they'll be easily noticed, Buzz realizes that the toys already in the nursery are hiding. Buzz starts to get worried, and his fears turn out to be well founded as the Caterpillar Room is suddenly filled with young toddlers who have no sense of good behavior and play with the toys very roughly (with Buzz being licked profusely and used as a mallet, Jessie used as a paintbrush and the aliens used by one child to bounce on, etc). Meanwhile at Bonnie's house, Woody meets Bonnie's toys [[Trixie]] the triceratops, [[Mr. Pricklepants]] the hedgehog, [[Dolly]], [[Chuckles the Clown]], [[Buttercup]] the unicorn, and [[Totoro]] and spends the rest of the day being played with by Bonnie, who takes good care of her toys and plays imaginative games.

Meanwhile, after the children have gone home, the toys are left dirty, bent out of shape, and quite gloomy. Buzz talks to Lotso about transferring them to the Butterfly Room with the more sensible, older children. However, Lotso only offers a transfer for Buzz himself, and so Buzz is unable to accept. Lotso and his henchmen, therefore, resort to resetting Buzz into his original, deluded space ranger character from the first film. Meanwhile, Mrs. Potato Head, through one of her eyes at Andy's house, discovers that Andy is actively searching for the toys and did not mean to throw them away and realizes that Woody was right all along. As they prepare to leave and return to Andy, they are captured and imprisoned by Lotso and his gang, including the reset Buzz. To make sure Andy's toys follow his many rules, Lotso tosses them Woody's hat that he had been left behind and makes them think he somehow killed Woody. He and his henchmen then return to their room, leaving Buzz in charge of the prisoners.

Back at Bonnie's house, although Woody enjoys being played with again, he is still desperate to get home to Andy. Bonnie's toys help him find a map that shows Andy's house is right around the corner from Bonnie's. As Woody prepares to go home, he mentions he came from Sunnyside, which is a surprise to Bonnie's toys. Mr. Pricklepants tell Woody that Lotso runs Sunnyside like a prison. Chuckles tells Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby were once owned by a loving girl named [[Daisy (Toy Story 3)|Daisy]]. However, one day, during a family trip at a rest stop, Daisy fell asleep and her parents took her home, accidentally leaving the toys in the countryside. They eventually returned to Daisy's house, only to find that Daisy's parents bought a new Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear toy for her. Lotso became extremely bitter at this and told Chuckles and Big Baby that they'd all been replaced (when in reality only Lotso had) and forced them to leave. The toys set out on their own, and were bumped off over at Sunnyside where Lotso and Big Baby quickly rose to power, transforming the daycare into a toy prison, along with Chuckles before he got broken and escaped and was found by Bonnie. Woody quickly realizes that he must save his friends and get back to Andy before he leaves for college.

The following morning, the toys feel very regretful and badly ashamed for the horrible mistake they made and they only wished now they had never left Andy's home in the first place. They are also shown to be heartbroken over Woody's apparent death at Lotso's hands. At the same time, Woody returns to Sunnyside inside Bonnie's backpack to rescue his friends. Before he meets up with them, he meets [[Chatter Telephone]] who tells the only way out of Sunnyside is down the garbage and in order to get there, he must first defeat a cymbal-banging monkey known as "''[[The Monkey]]''" who monitors the security system throughout the entire daycare to prevent toys from escaping. Woody then reaches his friends and they happily greet him, glad to see him alive and well. After they give him his hat, they reconcile and quickly formulate an escape plan. That night, during the roll call, Mr. Potato Head distracts Lotso's gang while Woody and Slinky sneak through Sunnyside to the main office, where the Monkey works. A brief fight ensues, ending with the Monkey wrapped in adhesive tape and locked in a filing cabinet. Slinky signals to the other toys to escape. Rex and Hamm pretend to fight while Jessie and Bullseye sneak out of their calls and trap Buzz. Woody, Rex, Barbie, Slinky, and Hamm attempt to fix Buzz, but accidentally reset him into a deluded Spanish mode though as Hamm blames Rex for this, it was enough to get Buzz back on their side so Woody just pulls him along.

They make their way out onto the playground, and after several close-calls, manage to reach the garbage chute. However, as the toys prepare to leap to freedom, they are confronted by Lotso and his henchmen, who have "broken" Chatter into informing him of the escape plan. After hearing a garbage truck in the distance, Lotso offers the toys a spot back in his family. However, they refuse to be part of any family that Lotso runs. Ken comes to the side of Woody and the others, telling the other toys that Lotso transformed the toys at Sunnyside into a pyramid and put himself on top. When Lotso reprimands Andy's toys that no kid has ever really loved a toy, Woody brings up the subject of Daisy and reminds Lotso that she didn't throw him out but lost him, and reveals to Big Baby that Lotso was the only one that was replaced. He then throws over a name tag that Big Baby once owned with Daisy's name on it. Big Baby picks up the locket after being reminded of his former owner, and it's clear that he still cares about her. Lotso is infuriated by this and snatches the locket, smashes it with his cane, and starts to get abusive towards Big Baby when he starts to become upset. Built up from all the anger of the toys trying to escape, Lotso tells the stubborn toys that a toy is nothing but trash waiting to be thrown away in hopes of getting it through their heads once and for all. This finally makes Big Baby and the other Sunnyside toys see Lotso for his evil, bitter self, and Big Baby picks up Lotso and throws him in the dumpster. However, when the garbage truck arrives, Lotso drags Woody (after he helps an alien get unstuck) into the dumpster with him, and the rest of Andy's toys refuse to abandon him and jump in, while Barbie and Ken are forced to remain behind. Having been thrown into the rear of the truck, a small TV falls on Buzz, resetting him to his normal self, with no memory of what happened to him.

The toys find themselves at the [[Tri-County Landfill]], where the aliens notice a large crane in the distance, reciting one of their catchphrases, "''The Claw!''", and proceed to venture off toward it. The rest of the toys, meanwhile, are dumped onto a long conveyor belt of garbage heading towards a set of shredders. Thanks to the magnetic ceiling over them, they manage to avoid the shredders, including Lotso, who is helped to safety by Woody and Buzz. The conveyor belt then moves upwards, however, sending them toward the central incinerator. Lotso notices an emergency shutoff switch at the top of a ladder, and with Woody's and Buzz's help, manages to reach it. However, rather than shutting off the belt, Lotso walks away and leaves them to die. The remaining toys are dropped into a large chamber, where the shredded garbage is falling in an enormous bowl toward the central incinerator. The toys seem resigned to their fate, and join hands as they accept their inevitable death. Just then, however, the aliens use the crane's claw to pull them to safety.

Lotso, in the meantime, finds himself strapped to the front of another truck by a garbage man, who claims he once had a Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear toy when he was a kid. Deciding that the attic isn't such a bad place to be sent, the toys manage to return to Andy's room undetected (riding a 21-year old [[Sid Phillips|Sid]]'s garbage truck), where they pack themselves into a box labeled "''Attic''" and say goodbye to Woody wishing him a good time at college with Andy. However, Woody decides he can't allow his friends to be sent to the attic and gets an idea, writing Andy a note suggesting that he gives the toys to Bonnie, who he knows will play with and take good care of them. Andy discovers the box, and finds the note Woody left on the top.

He drives the toys to Bonnie's house, where he pulls them from the box and passes them on to her one by one, explaining their names, personalities, and other traits. Finally, Bonnie looks into the bottom of the box and sees Woody, who had jumped into the box before leaving the note and leaving Andy confused about how he'd gotten in there. Andy picks Woody up before Bonnie can, but then sees the surprised look on her face, as well as all of his other old toys, lined up together with her. In one last symbolic gesture, he gives Woody to Bonnie, telling her that they've been through a lot together, and he means a lot to him, so she's got to take good care of him. Bonnie gladly accepts, and Andy joins her in playing with what are now her toys one last time. Soon, it's time for Andy to leave, and as he sits in his car and prepares to pull away, he looks back to see Bonnie waving Woody's hand at him. He smiles, thanks to his toys for a great life together before. When Bonnie goes inside with her mother, the toys watch Andy drive away as they all wish him a final goodbye before Woody starts introducing his friends to the rest of Bonnie's toys.

The end credits show that life at Sunnyside is now far kinder and happier under the supervision of Ken and Barbie. All of the toys now rotate their time between the Caterpillar and Butterfly Room equally, and no toy is left in the Caterpillar Room too long. [[Emperor Zurg]], a few other toys and the Army men are also seen landing in Sunnyside and receive a warm welcome from the residents. Ken and Barbie also keep in touch with the toys living at Bonnie's through letters hidden in her bag, as it is shown that Woody and the others have fully settled in with Bonnie's other toys and are their new life together. The last scene shows Jessie taking advantage of Buzz's Spanish mode as they perform a pasodoble to "Hay Un Amigo En Mi", the Spanish version of "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]".

==Development==
According to the terms of Pixar's revised deal with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], all characters created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney. Furthermore, Disney retains the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. But in 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Disney Chairman at the time [[Michael Eisner]] put in motion plans to produce ''Toy Story 3'' at a new Disney studio, [[Circle Seven Animation|Circle 7 Animation]]. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return even if Pixar was not on board.

Jim Herzfeld wrote a script for Circle 7's version of the film. It focused on the other toys shipping a malfunctioning Buzz to Taiwan, where he was built, believing that he will be fixed there. While searching on the Internet, they find out that many more Buzz Lightyear toys are malfunctioning around the world and the company has issued a massive recall. Fearing Buzz's destruction, a group of Andy's toys (Woody, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Jessie, and Bullseye) venture to rescue Buzz. At the same time, Buzz meets other toys from around the world that were once loved, but have now been recalled.

In January 2006, [[Pixar#Acquisition by Disney|Disney bought Pixar]] in a deal that put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and [[John Lasseter]] in charge of all Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and its version of ''Toy Story 3'' was canceled. The character designs went into the Disney archives. The following month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney was in the process of transferring the production to Pixar. John Lasseter, [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Pete Docter]], and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched ''Toy Story'' and came up with the story for the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a treatment. On February 8, 2007, Catmull announced ''Toy Story 2''<nowiki/>'s co-director, Lee Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of John Lasseter (who was busy directing ''[[Cars 2]]''), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. The release date was moved to 2010. Unkrich said that he felt pressure to avoid creating "the first dud" for Pixar since as of 2010 all of Pixar's films had been critical and commercial successes.

During the initial development stages of the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original ''Toy Story'' and found that although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3-D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, more than a year and a half was invested in research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.

Instead of sending Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and John Ratzenberger scripts for their consideration in reprising their roles, a complete story reel of the film was shown to the actors in a theater. The reel was made up of moving storyboards with pre-recorded voices, sound effects, and music. At the conclusion of the preview, the actors signed on to the film.

Dolby Laboratories announced that ''Toy Story 3'' would be the first film that will feature theatrical 7.1 surround sound. Thus, even the Blu-ray version will feature original 7.1 audio, unlike other movies which were remixed into 7.1 for Blu-ray.

==Release==
===Home media===
{{Main|Toy Story 3 (video)}}
''Toy Story 3'' was released on a standard DVD edition, two-disc Blu-ray, and in a four-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack November 2, 2010. It was also released with the first two movies in A 10-disc ''Toy Story'' trilogy Blu-ray box set the same day.

On its first week of release (November 2–7, 2010) it sold 3,859,736 units (equal to $73,096,452) ranking No.1 for the week and immediately becoming the best-selling animated film of 2010 in terms of units sold (surpassing ''How to Train Your Dragon'').

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''Toy Story 3'' received widespread acclaim from critics. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 304 reviews, with an average score of 8.87/10. The site's consensus is: "Deftly blending comedy, adventure, and honest emotion, ''Toy Story 3'' is a rare second sequel that really works."

==Music==
{{Main|Toy Story 3 (soundtrack)}}
The film score of ''Toy Story 3'' was composed and conducted by [[Randy Newman]], his sixth for Pixar after ''Toy Story'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''Toy Story 2'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', and ''[[Cars]]''. Disney did not release the soundtrack album for ''Toy Story 3'' on Compact Disc (CD). It was only available, initially, as a music download in lossy formats, such as MP3 and AAC. This was the second instance where Disney did not release the award-winning soundtrack of a Pixar film on CD. The first Pixar film not to have its soundtrack released on CD by Disney was ''Up''. In January 2012, Intrada released the ''Toy Story 3'' soundtrack on Compact Disc. In addition to the tracks included in the soundtrack album, the film also uses "Dream Weaver" by Gary Wright, "Le Freak" by Chic, and Randy Newman's original version of "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]".

Also, tracks "Cowboy!" and "Come to Papa" included material from Newman's rejected score to ''Air Force One''. The song "Losing You" from Newman's own album ''Harps and Angels'' was also used in the first trailer for the film.

The Judas Priest song "Electric Eye" was used in the temp score for the opening scene of ''Toy Story 3''. The aliens are playing the tune in their sports car. But the song was ultimately replaced by another piece of music.

*'''A graph editing mistake''': When the toys are discussing if they're getting thrown away in the garage, look very closely and Mr. Potato Head's shoes slightly sink into the ground (only in the trailer).
*In the scene where they try to reset Buzz Lightyear, Barbie removes two screws that hold Buzz's back compartment. However, at no point did they re-screw the compartment closed and leave the door shut for the rest of the movie.
*In an early version of the movie, the third film was going to be in totally different way Woody and the crew would grow concerned after Buzz begins to malfunction. It’s decided that the space toy should be shipped back to Taiwan, where he was created. But once Buzz is en route, the toys learn that there's a massive factory recall – and there’s a good chance that their friend will be destroyed instead of fixed. The movie become a rescue mission, with Woody, Jessie, Rex, Potato Head, Bullseye and Slinky all traveling to Taiwan to save Buzz.

Awesome! it was also set to release sometime in 2008.
