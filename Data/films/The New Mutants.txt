==Synopsis==
[[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]] escapes the destruction of her reservation and loses her father in the process. She is knocked unconscious and awakens in an abandoned hospital run by Dr. [[Cecilia Reyes]]. Dani is introduced to four other young teenagers; [[Cannonball (Marvel)|Sam Guthrie]], who can propel through the air, [[Magik|Illyana Rasputin]], who can conjure magic and travel between another dimension called "limbo", [[Sunspot|Roberto da Costa]], who can ignite in flame and [[Wolfsbane|Rahne Sinclair]] who has lycanthropy. Reyes has each of them there after they have all suffered a tragedy; Sam brought a whole mine on his father and coworkers, Roberto burned his girlfriend, Rahne escaped her religiously strict village who branded her and Illyana was haunted by her past in child slavery as well as otherworldly beings called the Smile Men. Reyes has them stay at the facility as she herself as the power to create force fields.

Collectively, the New Mutants believe that they are being trained to join the [[X-Men (team)|X-Men]], hence the strict supervision, as well as Reyes reminding them that they are considered dangerous and should not leave until they are under control. Dani immediately befriends Rahne and eventually the two of them form a romantic relationship while Illyana continues to antagonize Dani. When Dani fights back, Illyana seeks comfort in her hand puppet of a purple dragon named Lockheed. Soon, Dani's new friends all begin to have horrifying visions of their past, one of which results in Rahne getting branded in her neck. Illyana deduces that the visions are the result of Dani's powers manifesting; she has the ability to create illusions based on a person's psyche.

Reyes consults her employers who turn out to be Essex Corporation and instruct her to kill Dani. As Reyes takes Dani away, Rahne immediately suspects that something is wrong. Illyana and Sam are attacked by the Smile Men while Roberto tries to break through the barrier which has shrunken down. Dani uses her powers to learn of Reyes' true intent, but Rahne arrives in time and severely injures Reyes, forcing her to flee. The New Mutants regroup and realize that in order to escape, they have to kill Reyes. They find her and she reveals that she was training them to be killers for Essex, but that Dani must die due to her dangerous Mutant abilities. Before she can however, the [[Demon Bear]], who had been following Dani this whole time and was the true reason her reservation was destroyed, arrives and devours Reyes.

Illyana summons her powers to jump between limbo and recruits a real life version of Lockheed to take on Demon Bear. Eventually, Sam and Roberto join the fight, overcoming their insecurities in the process. Rahne tries to reach through to an unconscious Dani until she herself battles the Demon Bear. Dani is visited by her father's spirit who encourages her to face her fear. Dani awakens and confronts Demon Bear; calming it into submission and allowing it to rest. As day breaks, the New Mutants learn that the force field is down and head out together to face the unknown.

==Trivia==
*With this movie being released in limited theaters, this is the first Disney movie overall to be released in theaters since ''[[Onward]]'', and the first live action Disney movie to be released in theaters since ''[[Wendy (film)|Wendy]]''.
*Despite this being the final installment in the X-Men Cinematic Universe, ''[[Deadpool 3]]'' (which will be set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]) will continue [[Deadpool]]'s storyline after his last appearance in the film ''Deadpool 2''.<ref name = "Collider">{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/deadpool-3-mcu-confirmed-r-rating-filming-details-kevin-feige-interview/|title=Feige Confirms ‘Deadpool 3’ Is an MCU Movie; Teases R-Rating and When It’s Filming|website=Collider|date=[[January 11]], [[2021]]}}</ref> In addition, [[Patrick Stewart]] reprises his role as [[Professor X]] in ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.
*This is the last movie that [[Stan Lee]] produced before his death.
*This is the first appearance of [[Sunspot]] in the New Timeline, after being introduced in the Old Timeline in ''X-Men: Days of Future Past''.
*This movie introduces magic to the X-Men Cinematic Universe, as Magik's mutant power is sorcery, and the Demon Bear is a magical being.
*[[Danielle Moonstar]] and [[Wolfsbane]] are the fourth and fifth LGBT characters in the X-Men Cinematic Universe, the first three being [[Deadpool]], Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio.
*Josh Boone revealed that the film was originally supposed to take place in the 80's. However, following the critical and commercial failure of ''X-Men: Apocalypse'', he was told to simply set the film in modern day. Boone did not mind as the setting took place in an isolated area and also because it slightly allowed more freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/the-new-mutants-movie-80s-setting/|title=So Here’s Why ‘The New Mutants’ No Longer Takes Place in the 80s|work=Collider|date=February 4, 2020|accessdate=March 2, 2020}}</ref> This means the movie takes place after the events of ''Deadpool 2'' and before the "good future" scenes of ''X-Men: Days of Future Past''.
*The characters watch clips from ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' that foreshadow later events. A clip from "The Body" featuring Willow and Tara kissing for the first time, sets up Rahne and Dani's first kiss while a clip from "Hush" sets up the appearance of the Smiling Men.
*The film was originally going to feature a post-credits scene that would have revealed [[Jon Hamm]] as Mister Sinister. When reshoots were planned, the studio demanded a new post-credits scene be made that would have featured [[Antonio Banderas]] as Emmanuel da Costa. Boone never got around to filming the new post-credits scene due to the Disney-Fox merger happening at the time. The film doesn't have a post-credits scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/new-mutants-movie-cut-post-credits-scene/|title=New Mutants Cut A Post-Credits Scene Due To Disney-Fox Deal|work=Screen Rant|date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>
*According to Josh Boone, the character of Warlock was supposed to appear, played by [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. He was cut due to budgetary constraints.<ref>[https://nerdist.com/article/new-mutants-sacha-baron-cohen-warlock-mocap/ THE NEW MUTANTS Almost Starred Sacha Baron Cohen as Warlock]</ref>
*New Mutants co-creator, Bob McLeod, was highly critical of the film. He disliked how the characters were portrayed, specifically Sunspot who he felt was a victim of whitewashing and was further angered at how his name was misspelled in the credits as "Bob MacLeod". The spelling was corrected in the home media release.
