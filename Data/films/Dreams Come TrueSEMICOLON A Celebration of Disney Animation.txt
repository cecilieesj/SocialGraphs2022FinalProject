'''''Dreams Come True: A Celebration of Disney Animation''''' is a documentary on the history of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]].

==Plot==
===Summary===
[[Vanessa Williams]] analyzes the magic of Disney animated movies from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', whose promotion is launched.

===Synopsis===
With the end of 2D animation feature films, documentaries on Disney films, shown in preview outputs, deserted television screens. It must be said that the market availability of the video or the Internet with an impressive set of documents of all kinds, to the works themselves, led to complete satiety public can therefore at their own pace and desires, discover or rediscover all the elements he wants to know. The release of a new Grand Classic Disney is no longer as an event which the dedicated television airtime.

''Dreams Come True: A Celebration of Disney Animation'' therefore takes up against the current trend. It is, in fact, the highlight of a marketing campaign that major studio Mickey had not set up for one of its animated films for many years. I must say that the issue is crucial for Disney ''The Princess and the Frog'' supports, it is true, on his shoulders, the ambitious goal of restoring the public taste of 2D animation and classic works of the label: to namely, fairy princess full of magic! If, before operating, critics and fans show their full adherence to the film, the test still has to turn at the box office by bringing in many spectators in theaters. A few days before its release in the United States, the odds are so rife on the business results of ''The Princess and the Frog'', nobody imagined at this stage sulking public. To this, several indices: the previews in New York and Los Angeles were sellouts while merchandising organized around the cartoon in full swing.

To support the release of the film, Dreams Come True: A Celebration of Disney Animation presented by Vanessa Williams arrives therefore timely. This publication document and returns through various themes (music, princesses, magic...) on all the unique characteristics of Disney movies, reaffirming the way the parentage of The Princess and the Frog with his illustrious elders Cult. Many American stars are called in to help support the speech and deliver happy memories and impressions Stars "house" (Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus), sports (Serena Williams, Magic Johnson), singers (Elton John, Ne-Yo), presenters (Ty Pennington, Emeril Lagasse), actors (Jamie Lee Curtis, Whoopi Goldberg, Dick Van Dyke, Sigourney Weaver, Anjelica Huston, Kristin Chenoweth, Betty White) not to mention some members of the team film (John Lasseter, Ron Clements, John Musker), including doublers (Anika Noni Rose, Terrence Howard).

Beyond its undeniable advertising, ''Dreams Come True: A Celebration of Disney Animation'' is a fascinating documentary on the soul of the Disney magic! Simply exhilarating.
