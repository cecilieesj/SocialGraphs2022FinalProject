==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*The opening narration is edited to remove the description of the Olympics as taking place "within the shadow of beautiful Mount Olympus, in the land of ancient Greece".
*The first scene of Goofy as torchbearer.
*All scenes between Goofy foot racing and the decathlon, including the hurdles, the pole vault, and the hammer throw.

==Notes==
*The background of Mount Olympus is reused from the opening shot of the Pastoral Symphony segment of ''[[Fantasia]]''.
*During the pole vaulting sequence, the narrator quotes the poem "Crossing the Bar" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
