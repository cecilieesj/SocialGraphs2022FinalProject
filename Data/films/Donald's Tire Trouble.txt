'''''Donald's Tire Trouble''''' is a [[1943]] cartoon starring [[Donald Duck]]. It was directed by Dick Lundy.

==Plot==
While speeding on the road, Donald Duck runs over a nail on a horseshoe causing it to pop his tire ("Good luck &ndash; BAH!" the duck gripes), necessitating its replacement with the car's heavily-patched spare. He encounters difficulty lifting the car with his jack, removing the damaged tire, and repairing it with another patch. The hilarious difficulty Donald has with changing his tire is caused mostly by his own anger and impatience. Unfortunately for him, after Donald miraculously succeeds in his task, all four tires immediately pop once he resumes driving (he rants out "Retreads!" and blows a fuse), but he continues his trip undaunted on four flats.

The short is a commentary on wartime rationing, and the rubber shortage during World War II. Donald admits as much himself when he examines the well-worn tube and gripes, "Doggone rubber shortage!"

==Trivia==

*The cartoon's promotional poster, as well as the title card, depicts newspaper articles discussing about rubber tire restrictions during World War II. At the time of its release, the message that rubber is hard to obtain references the wartime scarcity of transport commodities. As such, posters asked people to ration their tire usage and save them for soldiers who were currently fighting in World War II in the Pacific and in Europe.
