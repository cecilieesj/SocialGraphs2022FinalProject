'''''Goofy's Glider''''' is a ''[[Goofy]]'' short that was released on [[November 22]], [[1940]]. It is the first of the "How to" series of ''Goofy'' shorts.

==Development==
The ''Goofy'' How-to series was initially developed as a way to produce ''Goofy'' cartoons after Goofy's voice actor, Pinto Colvig, temporarily left the studio during a dispute. It features little dialogue from Goofy, most was pre-recorded or imitated using another actor.

==Summary==
Goofy is seen attempting to fly using a homemade glider, and the assistance of a book. A narrator provides the instructions while he attempts to carry them out. He first attempts to take off by running quickly, but crashes into his gate. Looking for more speed, he attempts to tow the glider. However, it quickly loses altitude when he tries to climb into it.

Taking the book's advice, Goofy resorts to mechanical means of taking off. A bicycle seems promising, but the glider comes off and leaves him behind. He then attempts to skate down a ramp, but ends up flying upside down. A makeshift slingshot appears successful, until he realizes that most of the glider's body was left behind, leaving him with only a chair and a steering column. Luckily, he is wearing a parachute, and bails out. However, he counts so slowly, that he hits the ground (unharmed), before the parachute opens.

Resorting to his own methods, Goofy loads a cannon with numerous forms of explosives. He barely manages to get in the glider before the cannon goes off. Luckily, this attempt is successful; so successful that he is seemingly in orbit around the Earth.

==Voice cast==
*Danny Webb - Goofy<ref name=Canemaker>{{cite book|author=Canemaker, John|year=2006|title=Paper Dreams: The Art And Artists Of Disney Storyboards|publisher=Disney Edition|page=86|isbn=978-0786863075}}</ref>
*[[Pinto Colvig]] - Goofy (some stock lines)
*[[John McLeish]] - Narrator

==Trivia==
*The short is the inspiration for the [[Disney California Adventure]] attraction [[Goofy's Sky School]].
*Goofy would later be seen in his glider in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Donald Wants to Fly]]".
*While this is the first individually released "How To" Goofy cartoon, the first to be made was ''[[How to Ride a Horse]]''. The latter was originally shown as part of the package film ''[[The Reluctant Dragon]]'' and would not be released by itself until a decade later.
*The shot of Goofy reading the "How to Fly" book is shown on [[Weebo]]'s screen in ''[[Flubber]]'', before the flying car starts to take off.
