[[File:Maria&Guardians.jpg|thumb|250px|Maria with Miss Brown and Mr. Hater]]'''''Mistress Masham's Repose''''' was a film based on the [[1946]] novel of the same name by T.H. White that was being developed at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in the 1980s by Joe Hale, a verteran Disney animator who would eventually produceÂ ''[[The Black Cauldron]]''. Animator [[Andreas Deja]] did some preliminary character designs for it.

When the film was pitched to [[Roy Edward Disney|Roy Disney]] and [[Michael Eisner]] shortly after ''[[The Black Cauldron]]'s'' release, [[Roy Edward Disney|Roy]] thought that it was a charming idea, while [[Michael Eisner|Eisner]] outright stated that he hated it.<ref>DisneyWar: The Battle for Magic Kingdom by Stewart, James B., Simon and Schuster, Dec 9, 2008</ref>



==Plot==
As in the source story, Maria, a ten-year-old orphan girl, lives on a large estate known as Malplaquet. Her life is not a happy one because her guardian, a fat, uncaring vicar by the name of Mr. Hater, always leaves her in the hands of her prim, strict governess Miss Brown. The only two caring people that Maria has in her life are Miss Noakes, the household cook, and a retired professor who lives out in the garden.

To help herself feel better, Maria often takes long walks throughout the estate's grounds. One day, to her delight, she discovers an island out in the middle of a small lake that is inhabited by Lilliputians, or little people. Each of them quickly becomes friends with Maria and helps her to have fun in her day-to-day life.
