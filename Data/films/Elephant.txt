==Trivia==
*This is one of the last Disneynature films to use the 1967 MPAA logo in the end credits, alongside ''[[Dolphin Reef]]''. However, they were still not the last [[Disney+]] original films to do so since that logo was still used for ''[[Magic Camp]]'', which debuted exclusively on the streaming service on [[August 14]], [[2020]].
