A donkey and his friends, [[Julius the Cat]], a dog, and a rooster run away from people throwing bricks. After they play music, JuliusÂ goes fishing. The fish he pursues is cleaved in two by a sword fish, who them pursues all four of the musicians until they climb a tree to hide. The sword fish then cuts the tree, causing all four animals to fall into a house inhabited by criminals. The criminals fire cannons at them, but the cat jumps on a cannon ball, detaches his tail, and rides the cannon ball while using his tail to knock all the criminals out. Julius, the dog, the rooster, and the donkey live happily ever after.
