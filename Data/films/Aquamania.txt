'''''Aquamania''''' is a cartoon produced by Walt Disney Productions in [[1961]].

This cartoon was the last from Disney's "Golden Era" which featured [[Goofy]] as a solo star, and the first time the {{WikipediaLink|xerography}} animation production technique was used in a ''Goofy'' cartoon. ''Aquamania'' combined the three familiar areas of Goofy's shorts: sports, fatherhood, and documentary-subject.

==Plot==
The story begins with a narrator explaining a case study of "aquamania" (obsession with boats and boating), with Goofy (called "Mr. X" in this short) as the subject. Then the story switches to Goofy and his son on a boating trip, inadvertently entering a water skiing race. In the process, Goofy meets up with an unfortunate octopus that joins him in the race, and they accidentally take an unwanted spin on a roller coaster at a waterside amusement park. Goofy wins the race.
