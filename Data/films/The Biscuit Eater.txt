'''''The Biscuit Eater''''' is a [[1972]] Disney film released by [[Buena Vista Distribution]] based on a novel by James H. Street. It is the last 'One Boy and his Animal' themed movie made by Disney, as this subgenre would eventually grow out of fashion. The 1972 film is a remake of a [[1940]] film starring Billy Lee as Lonnie.

==Plot==
The story revolves around a German Wirehaired Pointer named Moreover who has a strong relationship with a red-headed boy named Lonnie (Johnny Whitaker) despite his mishaps. Moreover is dealt to Willie Dorsey (Godfrey Cambridge), a gas station clerk, but Lonnie and his best friend Text regain possession of the dog. They train Moreover to be a prize-winning bird pointer, entering him in a field trial.

The dog was considered untrainable by its first owner, Lonnie's veterinarian father, but the two twelve-year old boys take the time to make Moreover an excellent working example of his breed. Much to the chagrin of Lonnie's father, Lonnie and Text decide to enter Moreover in the state championship field trial. Moreover does well, and an incident makes the boys think that Lonnie's father will lose his dog training job if his dog, last year's champion SilverBelle, loses to their dark horse entry.
