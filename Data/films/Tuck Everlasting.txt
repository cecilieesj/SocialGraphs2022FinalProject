}}'''''Tuck Everlasting''''' is a [[2002]] family film based on the children's book of the same title by Natalie Babbitt published in [[1975]]. This version was directed by Jay Russell.

==Plot==
The plot revolves around a 15-year-old girl named [[Winnie Jackson Foster|Winnie Foster]], who is from a restrictive upper-class family. She runs away into the forest one day and meets a boy named [[Jesse Tuck]], drinking from a spring. She is then kidnapped by his elder brother, [[Miles Tuck|Miles]]. She soon falls in love with Jesse and later learns that his family can't age or be injured due to drinking water from a magical spring around a hundred years ago. As the search for her continues, the Tucks decide to leave the area and invite her to join them. She is forced to decide whether to drink from the spring and live forever, or live a mortal existence. She decides that despite the love she and Jesse share, her presence will only endanger the Tucks and she chooses to stay behind. After many years, Jesse returns to the tree where the spring used to be, and it is revealed that Winnie chose not to drink from it and lived a long and charitable life.
