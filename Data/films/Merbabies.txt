'''''Merbabies''''' is a [[1938]] ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Rudolf Ising]] and Vernon Stallings.

==Plot==
Similar to ''[[Water Babies]]'', "merbabies" materialize out of the crashing surf and proceed to the sea floor where they conduct a circus along with a variety of sea creatures.

==Notes==
*Although Disney recruited animators from [[Harman-Ising Productions]] to help production of this short, "Pipe Dreams" and "The Little Bantamweight", Disney didn't accept the latter two. Because of this, MGM bought the copyrights for the latter two shorts and released them as part of their ''Happy Harmonies'' series.
*This short and "[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]" are the only two Disney cartoons to be outsourced to another studio (this one because Disney borrowed animators from MGM to finish ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''). In the case of "Merbabies", it would be made by Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harman over at MGM, who worked with Walt in the early years.
