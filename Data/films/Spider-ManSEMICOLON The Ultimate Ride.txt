| Plot                    = The rider takes the position as one of [[Spider-Man]]'s "[[Spider-Friends]]", helping take down numerous villains loose in the city. First they briefly meet [[Daily Bugle]] Editor-In-Chief, [[J.J. Jameson]], who believes these villains' existence is the fault of Spider-Man, before encountering their first foe.

The [[Scorpion]] is swiftly defeated before he can get to the rider, as they use their [[Web-Shooters]] to collapse some rubble above him.

Next, [[Lizard]] reveals his plan to leak his [[Connors Formula|formula]] into the city's water supply, but the Spider-Friends damage some pipes, spraying him with nitrogen gas.

[[Electro]] appears, shocking citizens aboard the subway before being short-circuited by a spray of water.

[[Green Goblin]] then tries to attack the Spider-Friends directly, but Spider-Man grabs on to the bottom of his glider, ripping out important wires and causing the Goblin to crash.

The Spider-Friends then find the last villain, [[Doctor Octopus]], in his hideout, as his men gather supplies. Thanks to the Spider-Friends' distracting him by knocking down crates, Spider-Man is able to knock out Doctor Octopus with another crate.

As the Spider-Friends come to the end of the ride, they see the cast of villains, webbed up for collection by law enforcement.
