==Trivia==
*The original version is hosted by [[Jiminy Cricket]], while the [[2003]] version has title cards with a male voiceover reading them.
*Professor Owl's introduction to Jiminy Cricket uses the exact same introduction footage from ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: The Bare Necessities|The Bare Necessities]]''.
*Jiminy Cricket's segments use stock footage from ''[[You and Your Sense of Touch]]'', ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]'', ''[[I'm No Fool in Water]]'', ''You and Your Food'', and ''[[You, The Human Animal]]''.
*In the US laserdisc release, Jiminy's introductions to "Part of Your World" and "When You Wish Upon a Star" are different. While the "Part of Your World" introduction has the same line, the "When You Wish Upon a Star" introduction references "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat" and "Part of Your World". In addition, during "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat", the scene with Shun Gon playing piano with his chopsticks is cut out due to the allotted length of the CLV disc.
*This video was released on the same day as the reissue of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!|Disney's Sing Along Songs: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]'', which had the same ink label.
*This video features the remixed opening & closing.
*The 2003 DVD release includes the Vocabulary Game and Guess That Song.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|El Rey Leon: El Ciclo Sin Fin]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain. Also known as ''El Ciclo de la Vida''.
*Known as Le Roi lion: Le Cycle de la vie, released in France, also released in Canada.
*Known as Der König der Löwen: Der Ewige Kreis in German, released in Germany.
*Known as Il Re Leone: Presto Sarò Re in Italian, released in Italy.
*Known as De Leeuwenkoning: Wacht Maar Tot Ik Koning Ben in Dutch, released in Netherlands.
*Known as O Rei Leão: O Ciclo da Vida in Portuguese, released in Brazil, Also known as Siclo Sem Fim in Portugal.
*One of the Spanish versions (not the original one from Spain) can be found as a bonus feature in the 2003 DVD release and is like the 2003 release with the title cards.
*The US and Canadian releases of this tape use the new title card. On the UK release, the "Sing-Along Songs" title card uses the 1990 color and font, while foreign-language releases use the old 1988-1993 logo, but with the remixed opening and closing theme.
*"When You Wish Upon a Star", as well as its introduction, uses footage from the special ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]'', where [[Disney]] characters commence to [[Jiminy Cricket]] singing.
*"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat" is reused from ''The Bare Necessities'', but uses newly updated lyrics.
*[[Following the Leader]] is removed from the 1995 Australlian VHS,the  USA 1994 VHS, the USA 2003 DVD, and all global releases as of infinity, besides, That song has been cut and it's place was replaced by [[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]
*The timing of the lyrics for "Part of Your World" and "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat" are different in the 2003 version; although the text still uses the same font as the original.
*In the late 1990s, Blockbuster Video released a triple-length VHS of the Sing-Alongs Series, available exclusively as a rental in their stores, and featured ''Circle of Life'' on the cover. This videocassette contains the contents of the ''Circle of Life'', ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Colors of the Wind|Colors of the Wind]]'', and ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Topsy Turvy|Topsy Turvy]]'' videos. It is also considered to be the rarest of all the Sing-Alongs releases, not being commercially sold in stores.
*The Italian release does not have a remixed opening theme, but it still has the remixed closing theme, unlike the 1993 print of [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Heigh-Ho|Heigh Ho]], also had that equation as well.
*The title card's letters is used strangely in all capital letters only in the English (UK Only), French and German releases.
