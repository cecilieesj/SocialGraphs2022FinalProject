'''''How to Fish''''' is an animated short produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and first released in [[1942]]. It stars [[Goofy]].

==Plot==
Like all "How To" Disney shorts, this one opens with a narrator explaining how to fish, with Goofy acting as the visual narrator. This short film does not have a plot; all the facts are jumbled together, with several humorous facts and clips.

There are similarities between this cartoon and ''[[How to Ride a Horse]]'', as both are framed as being presented inside a book of the same name, with the punchline of the short being an animal on the front cover coming to life and having the last laugh.

==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*The entire opening with the zodiac sign and Goofy at home; it opens with the shot of the mountain.
*The description of the mountain trout.
*Goofy failing to approach a stream quietly and getting his hat eaten by fish.
*Goofy trying, but failing spectacularly, to cast the lure.

==Notes==
*This being the second "How to" title, this shares some similarities with ''[[How to Ride a Horse]]'', being the short taking place in a book, with the pages turning, and at the end, the animal having the final laugh (in the previous short, the horse, in this short, the fish).
*The animation of Goofy snoring is reused from ''[[The Art of Skiing]]''.
