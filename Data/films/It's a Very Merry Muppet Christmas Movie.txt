'''''It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie''''', [[:Category:The Muppets Characters|the Muppets]]' first full-length TV movie, is loosely based on the classic film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. The film first aired on [[NBC]] in November 2002.

==Synopsis==
[[Rachel Bitterman]] dreams of tearing down [[The Muppet Theatre]] and turning it into [[Club Dot]], a nightclub where she can sell overpriced drinks to rave monkeys. So when [[Mr. Bitterman]] dies and she inherits [[Bitterman Bank and Development|Bitterman Bank]], Ms. Bitterman changes the term of the Muppets' loan so that the final payment is due before their annual [[Christmas]] show, [[Moulin Scrooge]]. When [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] loses the loan money, the gang looks to [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] for guidance. But when a desperate Kermit wishes he had never been born, an angel named [[Daniel]] is sent to show him what [[The World in which Kermit was Never Born|the world would look like without him]]. Kermit must learn how important he really is to his friends to be returned home in time to see if he can save the theater.

==Promotion==
The movie was promoted by a guest appearance of Kermit and Miss Piggy on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn|The Late Late Show]]''.

In addition, Kermit unveiled [[Macy's Windows|seven windows]] at [[Macy's]] on November 22, 2002, for promotional purposes. The windows depicted scenes from the movie, as well as other holiday scenes with the Muppets.

Further, Kermit also unveiled a [[Kermit the Frogtographer|new Kermit plush]], which was based on the new Kermit balloon that premiered at that year's [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. An exclusive [[Muppet Christmas ornaments (Macy's)|Kermit Christmas ornament]] was sold as well.

==Notes==
* References to ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' include:
**Kermit passes by a statue erected in his honor, the caption of which reads "For the lovers, the dreamers, and you," a quote from "[[Rainbow Connection]]".
**Kermit finds out that without him, [[Doc Hopper's French Fried Frog Legs]] would have become a very successful enterprise.
**In [[Miss Piggy|Miss Piggy's]] apartment is a framed photo of her as Miss [[Bogen County]].

* Characters making their comeback appearances include:
**[[Rowlf the Dog|Rowlf]], performed by [[Bill Barretta]], speaks his first full lines ("Hey, Kermit!" and "Yeah! Heh, heh. Oh!") since [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson's]] death. Rowlf had a brief vocal muttering ("Oh Yeah.") in [[Episode 102: Garth Brooks|episode 102]] of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' but did not speak at all in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' or ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (apart from "Eugh!" in the latter).
**[[Scooter]], performed by [[Brian Henson]], also makes his first major appearance since [[Richard Hunt|Richard Hunt's]] death. In 1999, Scooter had one line in ''Muppets From Space''.
**[[Janice]], performed by Brian Henson, also speaks for the first time since Hunt's death. She had made silent appearances in ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' and ''Muppet Treasure Island''.
**[[Beauregard]] appears in the background of many scenes in the film. Beauregard does not have any lines, but Kermit yells "Beauregard!" as he returns to the theater, happy to be alive.

* This film marked the first major performance of [[Eric Jacobson]] in the roles of [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], and [[Animal]]. [[Kevin Clash]] performed [[Sam the Eagle]], but Jacobson would later take over that role as well.

* [[Jerry Nelson]] was [[Jerry_Nelson#2000s|ill during filming]], so his characters were puppeteered by others and later dubbed by Nelson. The exception was [[Lew Zealand]], who was performed by Bill Barretta.

*Within the alternate universe in which Kermit had never been born, a poster for "Farm Fresh Bacon" can be seen on Miss Piggy's fridge.

* An early working title was "He's a Wonderful Frog."<ref>[[Jim Lewis|Lewis, Jim]], [[The MuppetCast]], episode 36</ref>

*In the "Moulin Scrooge" sequence, [[Dr. Bunsen Honeydew|Bunsen]] and [[Beaker]] dress as they did in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''.

==Deleted Scenes==

[[Image:Xmas snoop 01.jpg|thumb|300px]]
Over 30 minutes of footage was cut from the original broadcast of this film. Many of the deleted scenes were included as special features on the DVD release, most appeared as part of the 20-minute documentary ''[[Inside Pepe's Studio]]''. Deleted scenes included the following:
*The [[Santa Claus]] hired for the Christmas show claims to be the real Santa and leaves, so Kermit has Bobo fill in.
*A sequence in "Moulin Scrooge" in which Sam the Eagle portrayed [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Baron Von Scrooge]].
*An extended interview between [[Carson Daly]] and Kermit, where Kermit explains that the Muppets inherited the theater from Scooter's uncle.
*Joe Snow melting in the dystopia which is life without Kermit.
*A scene with [[Snoop Dogg]] (this scene was not included in any home movie releases).
*A suggestive scene with Pepe and Rachel Bitterman was trimmed (this scene was not in the DVD release).<ref name="ew">[http://www.muppetcentral.com/news/2002/111702.shtml Entertainment Weekly, November 17, 2002]</ref>
*A short scene in which Rachel Bitterman was complaining about an expensive Christmas present.
*A dig at Irish rowdiness was also dropped (this scene wasn't included in the DVD release).<ref name="ew" />
*A scene at a prison that is presented as a news report, which announces that the criminal [[Pepe the King Prawn]] has escaped, with [[Bill Barretta]] as a newsman and [[Kirk Thatcher]] as a guard (this scene was an Easter Egg on the MGM DVD release and a non-Easter egg on the Universal release, and may have shown what had happened to Pepe in [[The World in which Kermit was Never Born|the world in which Kermit was never born]]).
*An alternate finale scene which had Glenn starting an angel teaching class, while bragging he had been supportive of Daniel all the way through (this scene was an Easter Egg on the MGM DVD release and a non-Easter egg on the Universal release).
