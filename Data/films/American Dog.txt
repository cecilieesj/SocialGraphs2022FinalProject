'''''American Dog''''' was a cancelled CGI animated film written and directed by [[Chris Sanders]]. A quirky road movie following a talking dog actor's journey across America with a one-eyed cat and a giant rabbit, the project ended up running into friction with [[John Lasseter]] and Disney executives for its unusual story and characters not being "mainstream" enough, despite the film having been put into development as the result of the similarly offbeat ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' finding great success for the studio. Sanders was replaced by Chris Williams and Byron Howard, and the film was rewritten and retitled [[Bolt|''Bolt'']].

==Development==
In June 2006, after becoming Chief Creative Officer at Disney Animation, John Lasseter along with other directors from Pixar and Disney attended two screenings of the film and gave Sanders notes on how to improve the story.[[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/movies/04hols.html] In February 2007, the film was titled ''American Dog'', and was revealed to be written and directed by Chris Sanders. The film's plot told the story of a dog named Henry, a famous TV star, who one day finds himself stranded in the Nevada desert with a testy, one-eyed cat and an oversized, radioactive rabbit who are themselves searching for new homes, all the while believing he is still on television.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215934/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/toy-story-3-and-american-dog-news] In June 2007, Sanders was removed from the project and replaced by Chris Williams and Byron Howard. According to Lasseter, Sanders was replaced because he resisted the changes that Lasseter and the other directors had suggested. Lasseter was quoted as saying "Chris Sanders is extremely talented, but he couldn't take it to the place it had to be." And Disney announced that the film, now titled ''Bolt'', would be released on November 21, 2008 in Disney Digital 3-D.[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/movies/04hols.html] In October 2008, after Sanders left the Disney Studio for Dreamworks and the original title was removed, the animation team was told to complete the filming in 18 months instead of the usual four years that is normally required to produce a computer-animated feature.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122506337211970383]
