'''''Society Dog Show''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' short that was released in [[1939]].

==Synopsis==
[[Mickey Mouse]] enters [[Pluto]] in a ritzy dog show. While Mickey grooms Pluto, Pluto starts swooning over [[Fifi (Mickey Universe)|Fifi the Peke]]. Things don't look good for Mickey and Pluto after the judge who looks over Pluto throws them out when the dog attacks the judge. But when a fire breaks out in the building (caused by a photographer), Pluto bravely goes in to save Fifi and is a hero.

==Notes==
*This cartoon is notable in that it was the last appearance of Mickey's older character design, which had been around for the past ten years since 1929's The Opry House.
*There was later a comic strip based on it by Floyd Gottfredson although the comic strip was portrayed quite differently than the cartoon.
*This is Mickey's 100th appearance in a Disney cartoon.
*The original opening titles to the cartoon appear on the ''Walt Disney Cartoon Classics: Starring Pluto & Fifi'' VHS.
*This is the first appearance of Pluto wearing a green collar instead of red (the poster still shows that Pluto's collar is red.)
*This cartoon may have been the inspiration for "[[Dog Show]]", another short film with a similar title and plot that was released in [[2013]] as a part of the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' television series.

*Direction: Bill Roberts
