'''''Sea Salts''''' is a [[1949]] [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] cartoon.

==Synopsis==
[[Bootle Beetle (character)|Bootle Beetle]] reminisces about old times with Donald aboard ship.

==Plot==
[[Donald Duck]] sets out to leave his outpost as [[Bootle Beetle (character)|Bootle Beetle]] watches him leave just as Bootle narrates of something that happened a long time ago just as he approaches a logbook of the S. S. Quack where it dates back to 1926, just as he reads over the logbook. Bootle then recaps that he made a strange pair with him and Donald while lost as sea, just as he explains that at this time, there was nothing to do but eat and rest. However, on the dawn of the 27th day, Donald and Bootle finally found land, happy to find food in this majestic land just as Bootle helps Donald make the coconut fall down  so he can catch it and drink the juice from it to which Bootle attempts to get a drink from it, but Donald drank all the juice, much to his frustration that Donald did not save any juice for him. As an alternative way of enjoying the coconut, Bootle starts eating parts of the inside of the coconut only to find out that he saved only one tiny bit for Donald.

As time went on, something different has really happened during the life between Bootle and Donald - for instance, Donald's failed attempt to catch a fish to which Donald uses Bootle as a bait to catch a fish only for him not to expect to help him find the hat he dropped. Donald repeatedly catches fish rather than his retrieve his hat. Having gotten his hat back and enjoyed the fish Donald caught using a stick, Donald sees a ship from a distance just as he and Bootle try to catch up, but at first, Donald wanted to leave him behind. As he changes his mind, Donald offers Bootle to join him and reach the ship.

Bootle then recaps that he and Donald have been good friends all year, but to this day, Bootle never seemed to understand him. Donald returns back with a soda pop with him just as he gives Bootle his soda just as the short ends with Bootle saying "See what I mean?".
