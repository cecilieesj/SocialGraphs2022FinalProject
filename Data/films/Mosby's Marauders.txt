'''''Mosby's Marauders''''' is a [[1967]] American film about the raids by John S. Mosby during the US Civil War which was directed by Michael O'Herlihy and released on [[March 17]], 1967 by [[Walt Disney Productions]]. Originally filmed for US television under the title ''[[Willie and the Yank|Willie and the Yank: The Mosby Raiders]]'', the film is about a young Confederate scout for Mosby's Rangers who meets a young Yankee and becomes his friend.

==Summary==
A young Private in the Confederate army, Willie Prentiss ([[Kurt Russell]]), is assigned to guard a remote river outpost during the American Civil War. Lonely Willie becomes pals with his Union army counterpart, Corporal Jenkins ([[James MacArthur]]) and they talk across the river. They hold shooting contests, and trade tobacco for coffee.  One day Willie accidentally shoots his own commander, Lt. Mosby (Jack Ging), and the Corporal helps him escape court martial by disguising him as a injured Yankee. Willy is shot sneaking home, but manages to make it. He lands up joining the marauders in one exciting caper after another and rejoins Mosby in trying to capture a Union General. In another plot twist, Corporal Jenkins is captured, and is soon in love with Willies cousin. An enjoyable story with tons of twists and turns.
