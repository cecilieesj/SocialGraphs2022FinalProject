A seemingly ordinary visit is soon interrupted by Hydra attempting to steal the [[Arc Reactor]] atop [[Hong Kong Stark Tower|Stark Tower]] in Kowloon, [[Hong Kong]], while its artificial intelligence Arnim Zola sends an army of Swarmbots to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Pavilion to steal a Data Core with highly confidential information. As he battles Swarmbots in Kowloon, Iron Man calls in Ant-Man and The Wasp to defend the pavilion, because only they can shrink down to get between the bots’ armor to destroy them from the inside.

With thousands of bots and only two of them, [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]] and the [[Hope Pym|Wasp]] call on guests at the pavilion for help. Aboard one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s newest combat vehicles, D.A.G.R. – the Defense/Assault Ground Rover (aka “the [[Dagger]]”) – guests are issued an EMP Blaster and engage in a heroic battle alongside Ant-Man and The Wasp to defeat Zola and his Swarmbots.<ref name="article">{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/culture-lifestyle/ant-man-and-the-wasp-nano-battle-opens-march-31-at-hong-kong-disneyland|title=Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!
