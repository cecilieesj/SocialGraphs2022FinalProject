===Television===
The 74-minute theatrical cut 3D film had its world television premiere in 3D on Disney Channel Asia on June 21, 2008 at 9pm (Malaysia/Philippines time) and in 3D/2D format on Disney Channel Asia on June 22, 2008 at 10am and later on at 7:30pm. On Disney Channel Asia the movie was sped up by about 2–3 minutes making the movie only about 72 minutes long. Because of this, the voices came out high pitched and mildly distorted.

The movie was not sped up when it aired in America, and the full 74 minute long film was played, with the exception of the scene with Miley and her father in the car being cut out for content due to controversy over them not wearing their seatbelts. The 74 minute 3D film had its basic cable premiere in 3D on July 26, 2008 on [[Disney Channel]] and on Family (Canada) at 8:00pm and again at 9:30pm. An interesting note was prior to the Disney Channel premiere a disclaimer stating that the film was reformatted to fill a 4:3 screen was shown, followed by a letterbox presentation. It also premiered in 2D on July 27, 2008 on [[Disney Channel]] at 6:30pm. The movie also had multiple showings in 2D on Starz starting on July 26, 2008 and continuing throughout the month of August. All these showings occurred before the film's DVD/Blu-ray release on August 19. Beginning July 27, both the 2D and 3D version were available on Starz on Demand in standard definition and HD. Before the Disney Channel premiere, the Asian premiere was uploaded on Youtube.com.

The film was shown on TV in an anaglyphic encode. Unlike Disney Digital 3D, this didn't show the polarized format that the movie was presented in when it opened in theaters. Wal-Mart stores gave out free 3D glasses for the Disney Channel Premiere and 3D glasses were also included in the July 21, 2008 issue of ''TV Guide'' magazine. The film premiered on the Disney Channel in Australia on July 26, and selected K-Mart stores (along with pay TV provider Austar) gave away free pairs of 3D glasses leading up to the premiere. On Disney Channel New Zealand, the Best of Both Worlds Concert premiered on August 2. 3D glasses were sold in The Warehouse stores. In Canada, Wal-Mart sold the 3D glasses for 50 cents with all proceeds going to charity. ''The Magazine'', a Canadian magazine also gave out a free pair of 3D glasses with the June/July 2008 issue.

On August 9, 2008, Disney Channel Italy began to promote the concert that would air on October 25, 2008. The concert aired in a 3D edition while, at the same time, Disney Channel +1 was airing the film in 2D. The glasses could be ordered for free from the Disney Channel Italy site, came included with ''Hannah Montana Magazine'', from Topolino's comics and from the Disney store. On September 28, 2008, Disney Channel India showed the movie in 3D. They showed the movie in 2D on October 4, 2008.

During the ''[[Camp Rock]]'' premiere night on Disney Channel U.K., an advertisement aired showing clips of the movie and stated that it would be 'coming soon'. The movie eventually aired on October 31, 2008 at 6pm. The 3D glasses for the U.K. version were included in the then-newest Sky Kids magazine or you could pick them up at the collection desk at the U.K. retail store Args.
