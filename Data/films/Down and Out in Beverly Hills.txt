'''''Down and Out in Beverly Hills''''' is a [[1986]] American comedy film based on the [[France|French]] play ''[[wikipedia:Boudu Saved from Drowning|Boudu sauvé des eaux]]'', which had previously been adapted on film in [[1932]] by Jean Renoir. ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' was directed by Paul Mazursky, and starred Nick Nolte, [[Bette Midler]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. The film is about a rich but dysfunctional couple who save the life of a suicidal bum. Flamboyant musician [[Little Richard]] also makes an appearance, and contributed the song "Great Gosh a'Mighty" to the soundtrack. The song's success led to a revitalization of his career.

Released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]], ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' has the distinction of being the first R-rated film ever released by Disney. The R rating is due to profanity as well as a brief scene showing a maid in bed having sex on top, another first for Disney. However, countless R-rated films have since received distribution by Disney, under subsidiaries such as Touchstone, [[Miramax Films]] and [[Hollywood Pictures]]. [[Walt Disney Pictures]], the flagship family-oriented brand, has yet to release a film with a rating stronger than PG-13.

==Plot==
David "Dave" Whiteman (Dreyfuss) and his wife, Barbara, played by [[Bette Midler]], portray a couple whose 20-year marriage is unfulfilling. Dave is having an affair with their live-in maid, played by Elizabeth Peña, while Barbara tries to relieve the anxiety she constantly feels by experimenting with various New Age therapies.

A "Down and Out" homeless man named Jerry Baskin (Nick Nolte), wanders into the backyard of the Whitemans Beverly Hills home, and tries to drown himself in the couples pool. Dave helps Jerry get back on his feet. The family is initially disgusted by Jerry, but they end up growing fond of him after getting to know him better.
