'''''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens''''', marketed as '''''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''''', is a [[2015]] film directed by [[J.J. Abrams]]; co-written by Abrams, [[Lawrence Kasdan]], and [[Michael Arndt]]; and produced by [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] president [[Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Bad Robot Productions]]. It is the first part of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[sequel trilogy]]. The film stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[Peter Mayhew]] reprising their original roles. The original actors are joined by a host of new actors including [[Daisy Ridley]], [[John Boyega]], [[Adam Driver]], and [[Oscar Isaac]].

The story begins thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the events of [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. The [[First Order]] has risen from the ashes of the [[Galactic Empire]] and is opposed by [[General]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and the [[Resistance]], both of which seek to find the missing [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. In the midst of this search, new heroes rise in the form of [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], a 19 year-old girl and a [[Force-sensitive]] [[scavenger]] from [[Jakku]]; [[Finn]], a [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] who defected from the First Order; and [[Poe Dameron]], the best [[pilot]] in the Resistance. They are aided by [[Han Solo]] in their search for Skywalker and their mission to destroy the First Order's new [[superweapon]], [[Starkiller Base]], which targets the [[New Republic]] and the Resistance for destruction. They are opposed by villains such as [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], a dark warrior with a mysterious past; and General [[Armitage Hux]], the commander of Starkiller Base.

Despite initially claiming that the ''Star Wars'' story ended with the redemption of [[Anakin Skywalker]] in ''Return of the Jedi'', and after spending years refuting speculation that there would be another film, ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] began work on Episode VII in [[2011]] in order to increase the value of Lucasfilm before he sold it to [[The Walt Disney Company]], although Disney would later elect to not use Lucas' story. The acquisition was finalized on [[October 30]], [[2012]]. Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced Episode VII and the sequel trilogy the same day. Lucasfilm later announced that the film would be an original story not beholden to the continuity of the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe, which was rebranded as the non-canon [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]].

''The Force Awakens'' was released on [[December 17]], 2015 in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Latin America, and Asian countries; [[December 18]], 2015 in North America; and [[January 9]], [[2016]] in China. Some North American theaters offered special limited advance showings on the evening of December 17th rather than the traditional midnight showing. The film received widespread critical praise upon its release and was a massive box office success, becoming the highest grossing film of all time in North America when not adjusted for inflation. Worldwide, the film was the third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release (behind ''Avatar ''and ''Titanic''). It is currently the fourth highest-grossing film of all time (behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', ''Avatar ''and ''Titanic'').

==Synopsis==
===[[Attack on Tuanul]]===
{{Quote|We got company.|Poe Dameron|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Flametroopers_destroy_Tuanul.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Flametrooper]]s open fire on the village of Tuanul.]]
Approximately 30 [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor|destruction of the second Death Star]], [[Luke Skywalker]], the last known surviving [[Jedi Master]] has disappeared. Both the [[First Order]], a successor to the fallen [[Galactic Empire]], and the [[Resistance]], a military force backed by the [[New Republic]] led by Luke's twin sister, [[General]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|scour]] the galaxy in an attempt to find him.

Leia sends Resistance [[Resistance pilot|pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] on a secret mission to the village of [[Tuanul]] on the [[desert]] [[planet]] [[Jakku]], to meet with village elder [[Lor San Tekka]], who has obtained a [[Map to Skywalker|map]] to Luke Skywalker's location. During the meeting, First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] under the command of [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] and [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] attack the village. Poe and his [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]] attempt to flee in their [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]], but a pair of stormtroopers disable the [[engine]]s with their [[blaster]]s. With no alternative, Poe gives the map to BB-8 and orders the [[BB-series astromech droid|BB unit]] to flee. Poe remains behind to cover BB-8's escape.

After stormtrooper [[Finn|FN-2187]] is deployed, [[FN-2003]] is hit with blaster fire by Poe. FN-2187 goes to help his squadmate, but FN-2003's wound proves fatal, and in his final moments, FN-2003 smears his blood on FN-2187's helmet before dying, deeply affecting FN-2187. After securing the area, the remaining villagers are herded into the town square. Tekka is captured and brought before Kylo Ren, who demands to know where the map leading to Luke is. Tekka responds that he knows who Ren used to be, and chides Ren that he cannot escape his real identity. Growing impatient, Ren kills Tekka by striking him down with his [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|lightsaber]].

Poe takes a shot at Ren from cover, but Ren casually stops the blaster bolt in mid-air with [[the Force]]. Poe is captured, and Ren decides to interrogate him further back on their ship. Before leaving, Phasma asks what to do with the crowd of captive villagers, and Ren orders them all slaughtered. Stormtrooper FN-2187 is horrified as the massacre plays out in front of him, remaining motionless and not firing his weapon.

===Return to the ''Finalizer''===
{{Quote|The Resistance will not be intimidated by you!|Poe Dameron to Kylo Ren|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Kylo_tortures_Poe_Dameron.png|thumb|right|250px|Kylo Ren probes Poe Dameron for information about the map.]]
Returning to the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent'']][[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'', FN-2187 is overwhelmed with emotions because of the death of his squadmate and the massacre of the villagers. He ducks inside an empty shuttle to take his helmet off, breathing heavily, but Phasma notices him and tells him to submit his blaster for inspection, having earlier noticed that he did not fire a shot. Knowing he would be punished and re-evaluated for not firing on the villagers, and with his faith in the First Order severely shaken, he decides to desert. Meanwhile, after failed attempts of torturing Poe for vital information about the map of Luke Skywalker's location, Ren uses his [[Mind probe (Force power)|mind probe]] Force power to pry the information from Poe's mind. Ren learns that the map is located within a BB series droid that fled the village, and informs General [[Armitage Hux]] of the new information.

===Encounter with the scavenger===
{{Quote|Classified. Really? Me too. Big secret.|Rey to BB-8|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Rey_encounters_BB-8_Ver2.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey encounters BB-8 in the deserts of Jakku.]]
Elsewhere on Jakku, a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] traverses the corridors of a downed ''[[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|Imperial II]]''[[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|-class Star Destroyer]] at the [[Starship Graveyard|Graveyard of Giants]]. Scavenging through the Imperial Star Destroyer, she finds a valuable piece of salvage and drops it in her satchel. Rey heads to [[Niima Outpost]], and hauls the sack of salvage throughout the town. She then goes to [[Unkar Plutt]] to exchange her scraps for [[foodstuff]], and he offers her a quarter portion for her salvage. After taking the foodstuff, Rey heads to her home, a downed [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]], and prepares a meal for herself. After finishing her meal, she watches a [[starship]] depart from the planet and then notices a distant sound. She immediately runs off with her [[quarterstaff]] to investigate.

There, she encounters BB-8 struggling against being captured by a [[Color|green-skinned]] [[humanoid]] scavenger named [[Teedo (Niima Outpost)|Teedo]]. She frees the [[droid]] and gives it directions to Niima Outpost and sends it on its way, but BB-8 insists on traveling with her. Rey goes to Unkar Plutt to again exchange her salvage for foodstuff, and the [[Crolute]] offers to buy BB-8 for sixty food portions; while tempted, Rey declines the offer. Plutt then sends two thugs to steal BB-8.

===Escape from the ''Finalizer''===
{{Quote|You do exactly as I say and I can get you out of here.|FN-2187 to Poe Dameron|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Finn_and_Poe_Escape_Finalizer.png|thumb|right|250px|FN-2187 and Poe Dameron walk through the halls of the ''Finalizer'' to escape.]]
Needing a pilot to escape, FN-2187 frees the captured Poe Dameron from his cell, and the two steal a [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter |TIE/sf fighter]]. FN-2187 mans the guns, killing several of his former comrades in the hangar, and then disables the ''Finalizer''{{'s}} [[turbolaser]]s on the outside of the vessel. During the escape, Dameron asks the stormtrooper his name, to which he explains that he has been raised from birth to be a stormtrooper, and the serial number "FN-2187" is the only designation he has ever had. Not content with calling a man a number, Dameron names the trooper "Finn", from the FN in his name. Finn likes the name, and goes on to use it. Dameron also tells him that the map vital to the Resistance was located within his astromech droid. Before they can continue their conversation and escape, the TIE is hit by a missile fired from the ''Finalizer'', sending it spiraling towards the planet below.

Phasma reveals to Hux that this was FN-2187's first offense of non-conformity. A technician then informs Hux that the TIE fighter was projected to crash on [[Goazon Badlands]], a canyon zone on Jakku. Realizing that Poe and Finn were going after BB-8, Hux sends out a squadron of search teams to the area.

===[[Escape from Jakku]]===
{{Quote|"What about that ship?"<br />"That one's garbage!"|Finn and Rey about the ''Millennium Falcon''|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Finn_and_Rey_Jakku_Escape.png|thumb|left|250px|Finn and Rey observe nearby Stormtroopers that are looking for BB-8.]]
Finn and Dameron eject from the TIE shortly before it crashes, each landing separately some distance from the wreckage. Making his way to the crash, Finn finds Poe's [[Resistance fighter jacket|jacket]], but no other sign of the man, and the fighter sinks into the sand. Believing Dameron to be dead, Finn begins wandering through the desert, discarding his stormtrooper armor along the way and eventually arriving at the nearest settlement, thirsting for water.

While Finn staggers to an animal trough to desperately slake his thirst, he notices thugs attempting to steal a BB unit droid, which Finn recognizes as BB-8, from a woman, Rey, but she fends them off with her staff. BB-8 notices Finn, wearing his master Dameron's jacket, prompting Rey to chase after him. Rey attacks Finn, believing him to be a thief. Finn explains that he had met and helped Poe escape the Resurgent Star Destroyer, but that Dameron had apparently perished during their crash. The First Order tracks Finn to the settlement, and launches an airstrike in attempt to search for BB-8 and the map. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 attempt to flee towards a [[TUG-b13|Quadjumper]], but [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter |TIE/fo fighters]] destroy it. With only one option left, the trio manages to escape in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Rey flies it through the Graveyard of Giants, while Finn fires on and destroys the pursuing TIE fighters. With the TIE fighters destroyed, they escape into space.

Back aboard the ''Finalizer'', Lieutenant [[Dopheld Mitaka]] informs Kylo Ren that the droid escaped on a stolen freighter and that it was aided by the deserter FN-2187. Ren activates his lightsaber and lashes out in a rage-fueled tantrum, slashing at an instrument panel uncontrollably. Mitaka tells Ren that they also appear to have been helped by a local scavenger girl. Kylo grows even more livid, using the Force to pull the officer by his throat across the room in order to choke him with his bare hands, and asking him what girl it was.

===Reunited with the ''Falcon''===
{{Quote|Chewie, we're home.|Han Solo to Chewbacca|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:HanandChewie-TFA.png|thumb|right|250px|Han and Chewie are reunited with the ''Millennium Falcon'' once again.]]
While Finn and Rey celebrate their escape from Jakku, the ''Millennium Falcon'' breaks down. The ship is in major need of repairs, so Finn, Rey and BB-8 begin working to fix it. While they are working on repairs, the ship is caught in a [[tractor beam]] by a freighter. Although they initially believe themselves to be captured by the First Order, they soon meet their real captors: [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], the former owners of the ship. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Chewie go about inspecting their ship and find the two stowaways, Rey and Finn, who he assumes were the thieves that had stolen the ''Falcon''. When Rey and Finn explain that they were going to take a droid named BB-8 to the Resistance because it has a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Chewie agree to help them.

[[File:Han_and_Chewie_Eravana.png|thumb|left|250px|Han attempts to talk his way out of a confrontation between two gangs.]]
Unfortunately, Han's freighter, the ''[[Eravana]]'', is boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the [[Guavian Death Gang]] and [[Kanjiklub]], both of whom want their money back from Solo. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Han hides both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewie go meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. Han tries but fails to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, [[Bala-Tik]], recognizing the BB-8 astromech droid from a First Order bounty placed on it. They demand that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continues, Rey accidentally releases three [[rathtar]]s. The rathtars provide a distraction for Han and Chewie to escape, but one catches Finn and drags him around the freighter. Rey finds a control panel and shuts a blast door on the rathtar, freeing Finn. The two join Han and Chewie and successfully jump to [[hyperspace]] in the ''Falcon''. Bala-Tik then orders his men to inform the First Order that Han Solo and the BB unit are aboard the ship.

===Meeting with the Supreme Leader===
{{Quote|Our strategy must now change.|Snoke to General Armitage Hux|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Kylo_Ren_and_Snoke.png|thumb|right|250px|Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke discuss the recent turn of events.]]
At [[Starkiller Base]], a planet converted into a [[superweapon]], powered by draining the energy of a star, and capable of destroying star systems, Kylo Ren and General Hux are summoned by [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]], who appears as a large remote [[hologram]] projection. Hux suggests using the Starkiller superweapon to destroy the government of the New Republic and the Resistance, and Snoke grants him the permission to do so. Snoke reveals to Ren that the astromech droid containing the map now resides in the ''Millennium Falcon'' - along with his father, Han Solo. Ren insists that his father means nothing to him, and with Snoke's training, he would not be seduced to the [[light side of the Force]].

===Journey to Takodana===
{{Quote|Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.|Han Solo to Finn and Rey|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Maz_Kanatas_Castle_Takodana.png|thumb|left|250px|Han, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 arrive at Maz Kanata's castle.]]
During the travel in hyperspace, the ''Falcon'' experiences a problem with its hyperdrive, but Rey demonstrates her knowledge of ships by bypassing the compressor and fixing the issue. Meanwhile, Finn attempts to bandage Chewie's arm, which was wounded while fighting on the ''Eravana''. After fixing the ship, Han questions Finn and Rey, wondering why they are fugitives. Rey explains that the First Order is after the map located within BB-8 and that Finn is with the Resistance.

After BB-8 displays a projection of the map, Han explains that after Luke disappeared, there were many parties that went searching for him. Luke had tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but an apprentice of his turned to the dark side, destroying all that Luke had built and killing the other [[padawan]]s that Luke had trained. Feeling responsible and blaming himself for the failure, Luke went into exile. Han also explains that he heard rumors that Luke went searching for the [[first Jedi Temple]].

Solo explains that he was able to find the ''Millennium Falcon'' soon after it entered space because he and Chewbacca were scanning for its signature. This was also why the criminal gangs were able to track it down so quickly, and meant the First Order could track it as well. In order to bring BB-8 to the Resistance, they needed to switch to a clean ship, which Han says he can obtain from an old friend.

Solo takes Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to the planet [[Takodana]] to meet with [[Maz Kanata]] at her [[Takodana Castle|castle]]. Han says that she has maintained her castle for over a thousand years, where she runs a bustling cantina. Unbeknownst to all, spies from different sides take notice of the group. [[GA-97]] alerts the Resistance that the BB unit has been located, while [[Bazine Netal]] informs the First Order of the same.

===The conflict within===
{{Quote|Forgive me. I feel it again... the pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started.|Kylo Ren to Darth Vader's helmet|audio=The_Pull_to_the_Light.ogg|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Kylo_Ren_Vader_Helmet_Chamber.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kylo Ren seeks guidance from his grandfather, Darth Vader.]]
Attempting to seek guidance from his grandfather, [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], Kylo Ren sits quietly in his meditation chamber. In front of him is the burned helmet of Vader, recovered from the funeral pyre on [[Endor]]. With the re-emergence of his father and Snoke's orders to kill him, Kylo feels an internal struggle within himself. He reveals to Vader's burned helmet that the light is pulling him in again and that even Snoke could sense it. He then asks his grandfather to show him the power of the darkness again, to pull him back to the [[dark side of the Force]] and help him overcome his future trials.

===A call from the Force===
{{Quote|Rey... these are your first steps.|The voice of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] during Rey's vision|<ref name="TFA" />}}
Han and Chewie speak with Maz. Finn arranges with [[Sidon Ithano]] and his first mate [[Quiggold]] that he will work as payment if they will fly him to the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. Rey implores Finn not to leave, but instead to help her find the Resistance. Finn, however, insists on leaving, and that there is no way to defeat the First Order. He also admits that he lied about being in the Resistance. He tells his story that he was a stormtrooper in the First Order. He had deserted after his first battle because he didn't want to kill unarmed villagers, for the First Order.

After Finn leaves, Rey hears the screaming of a young girl. She follows the screams. She descends deeper and enters a chamber that contains many relics from the past. The Force calls her to Maz's curio box, an ancient [[Wroshyr wood|''Wroshyr'' wood]] chest. Inside it, she finds the [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] that had previously belonged to Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke.

[[File:Force_Vision_of_Jedi_Massacre_TFA.png|thumb|left|250px|Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 as seen in Rey's Force vision.]]
Upon touching the lightsaber, she receives a series of [[Force vision|visions]]. Rey sees [[Cloud City]] and sees that there [[Duel on Cloud City|Luke duelled Darth Vader]]. She sees Luke placing his metallic hand on top of [[R2-D2]] near a fire, (presumed to be Luke's burning [[Jedi Temple of Luke Skywalker|Jedi temple]]). Next, she is lying on the ground, in the rain at night. Corpses lay around the [[Knights of Ren]] who slaughtered these victims. Kylo Ren notices and comes toward her. Before he reaches her, she sees herself as a child yelling, to her parents to stay on Jakku. When her parents were leaving Jakku, Unkar Plutt told her to quiet herself. Next, she sees Ren is chasing her in a snowy forest, in the future. Rey pulls herself out of the vision in terror. After the vision, she finds Kanata standing outside the room. Kanata explains to her the lightsaber's history and that it was calling to her. Kanata then reveals that she herself is Force-sensitive; although she was never a Jedi, she can simply close her eyes and feel the light of the Force within herself, and recognizes that Rey can do this too. Frightened by her vision, Rey runs into the woods with BB-8.

===[[Hosnian Cataclysm]]===
{{Quote|Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder!|General Armitage Hux|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Hux_and_Starkiller_Base.png|thumb|250px|General Hux commands the firing of the Starkiller superweapon.]]
After gaining Supreme Leader Snoke's permission to fire the Starkiller superweapon, Hux chooses the [[Hosnian system]], which hosts the capital of the New Republic, [[Hosnian Prime]], as well as the [[New Republic Defense Fleet]], in order to demonstrate the power of the First Order in an attempt to wipe out the "illegitimate" government of the New Republic in one fell swoop. The test is a success and Hosnian Prime, the current elected home of the [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]], all other astronomical bodies in the system, and an unknown percentage of the New Republic fleet are annihilated by the First Order's superweapon. The destruction of the Hosnian system is visible from the surface of Takodana. Shaken by the destruction, Finn re-evaluates his choice to leave.

===[[Battle of Takodana]]===
{{Quote|I need a weapon!''"<br />"''You have one!|Finn and Maz Kanata|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Pirate_castle_sacked.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey watches as Maz Kanata's castle is fired upon by the First Order.]]
The First Order, tipped off to BB-8's presence, arrives and attacks Maz Kanata's castle. Flying in with TIE fighters and [[AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport|Atmospheric Assault Landers]], the First Order swiftly assaults the castle and levels it, killing many of its inhabitants. Maz gives Luke's old lightsaber to Finn for safekeeping, telling Han she doesn't have time to tell him how she retrieved it. BB-8 follows Rey into the forests surrounding the castle, and the First Order is unable to locate the droid until a stormtrooper officer reports to Kylo Ren that the astromech had been sighted in the company of a girl.

During the fighting at the castle, Finn wields the lightsaber to kill one stormtrooper before he is overpowered by [[FN-2199]], a former squadmate of Finn's. His life is narrowly saved by Han, who uses Chewbacca's bowcaster to blast FN-2199 at the last second. Han and Chewbacca also kill multiple stormtroopers, but are captured along with Finn by the First Order. However, Resistance T-70 X-wings led by Poe Dameron, who is now revealed to still be alive, arrive to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensues and results in the destruction of many First Order TIE fighters and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs.

Rey encounters Kylo Ren at the woods, and fires at him with her blaster pistol, but Kylo restrains her using the Force. Probing her mind, he discovers that she has seen the map he's been looking for all this time, and orders the First Order to pull out, saying they had what they came for and no longer need BB-8. As the battle rages on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops board their ships and retreat, and Han witnesses his son carrying an unconscious Rey away. The Resistance is victorious, freeing Finn, Han, and Chewbacca. Han and Leia are reunited, and Han reveals to Leia that he saw their son.

===Reunited at the Resistance Base===
{{Quote|If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?''"<br />"''Luke is a Jedi, you're his father.|Han and Leia|<ref name="TFA" />}}
[[File:Resistance_Base_with_Map.png|thumb|right|250px|Leia, Han, C-3PO, and the Resistance leaders observe the recovered map.]]
Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are brought to the Resistance base on [[D'Qar]]. BB-8 encounters the astromech droid R2-D2, who, as [[C-3PO]] explains, has been dormant since Luke's disappearance. With the recovered map from BB-8 displayed on hologram, 3PO reveals that it is only partially complete, and that the map matches no charted system on record. It is revealed that Han and Leia are aware that their son is Kylo Ren, and that their son's fall to the dark side, despite Luke's efforts to guide him, caused them to separate, with Han returning to his smuggling business and Leia spearheading the activities of the Resistance.

Upon finding the location of the Resistance base, the Starkiller begins draining the power of the sun to destroy D'Qar. Meanwhile, the Resistance plans an attack of their own. Finn gives them the Starkiller's blueprints, which reveal that the Starkiller drains the energy of a star in order to charge its primary weapon, and that it requires a [[thermal oscillator]], which sustains the energy on the planet, in order to function. If the thermal oscillator were destroyed, it would de-stabilize the planet's core and implode the base. However, they would need to do it before the First Order charges the Starkiller weapon and destroys D'Qar. Finn, Han, and Chewie volunteer to disable the base's defensive shield from the inside. Before departing to Starkiller Base, Han and Leia embrace, and Leia pleads Han to bring their son home.

===Rey's capture===
{{Quote|You're afraid... that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader!|Rey to Kylo Ren|<ref name="TFA" />}}
Rey is brought to Starkiller Base and interrogated by Kylo Ren, who wants information on the map to Luke Skywalker. Ren takes off his helmet and shows her his face. Initially, Ren is able to see into Rey's mind, mentioning an island surrounded by water. However, the dark warrior has a difficult time probing her mind, and Rey is even able to push back into Ren's mind. After a mental struggle, Rey announces that she can sense fear in him - fear that he will never be as powerful as Darth Vader. Humiliated, Kylo storms out of the room to seek audience with Snoke.

[[File:Rey_and_Stormtrooper.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey uses a mind trick on a stormtrooper to aid her escape.]]
Left alone and aware of what just happened, Rey realizes it is as Kanata told her: she truly is [[Force-sensitive]]. She attempts to use a Jedi [[mind trick]] on her [[FN-1824|stormtrooper guard]], to make him release her and leave the door open. It doesn't work, but Rey tries again: this time he walks over and tells her he will tighten her restraints instead of undoing them. Concentrating, Rey tries one last time, and the stormtrooper listens to her demands. She quickly also remembers to have him drop his blaster as he leaves so she can arm herself. Rey then makes her way through Starkiller Base, honing her Force abilities while using stealth. She also draws on her experience climbing through wrecked Imperial starships to make her way through the bowels of the installation's machinery. Meanwhile, Kylo reveals to Snoke that Rey is strong with the Force but untrained, and Snoke commands Kylo to bring Rey to him. When Kylo discovers that Rey escaped, he throws another fit of rage, slashing at her empty restraint chair.

===[[Battle of Starkiller Base]]===
[[File:Battle_of_Starkiller_Base.png|thumb|right|250px|The battle over the trenches of Starkiller Base.]]
Han Solo pilots the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Starkiller Base accompanied by Chewbacca and Finn. Finn's main objective is to rescue Rey from captivity. Since the Starkiller's shields have a fractional refresh rate, Han pilots through the shields at lightspeed, and the ''Falcon'' makes a rough landing at the edge of a cliff. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn sneak into the main base and capture Captain Phasma, whom they force to disable the shields before disposing of her in a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]]. They reunite with Rey, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, [[Blue Squadron (Resistance)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Red Squadron (Resistance)|Red Squadron]] led by [[Black Leader]] Poe Dameron commence their assault. They fire on the Starkiller's hexagonal oscillator structure, but fail to destroy it as the First Order sends TIE fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Resistance into chaos.

[[File:HanSoloAndSon.png|thumb|left|250px|Han attempts to convince his son to abandon the dark side.]]
Seeing this, Han, Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey try to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Sensing his father's presence, Kylo goes to meet Han. Han then confronts his son, Kylo Ren, calling to him by his birth name, "Ben". They approach each other on a bridge over a large pit, and Han pleads with his son to reject Snoke and return to the light side of the Force. Ben, removing his mask and seeming regretful and scared, holds out his lightsaber to Solo, asking for his father's help. Han replies that he would do anything for him, but when he tries to retract the lightsaber from Ben's hand, he resists. Ben then twists the angle of the hilt and ignites the weapon through Han's torso. Witnessed by Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca, Han strokes his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Enraged, Chewbacca, Rey, and Finn start firing at Ren and the stormtroopers. As the firefight rages, back on D'Qar Leia has to sit down when she feels Han die through the Force, squeezing her eyes shut against the tears. Chewbacca injures Ren with his bowcaster, but Ren chases them out of the base and catches up to Finn and Rey in the forest.

[[File:Kylo_Ren_duels_Finn.png|thumb|right|250px|Kylo Ren locks sabers with the former stormtrooper.]]
Rey calls Ren a monster and then proceeds to shoot him with her blaster, but Ren knocks Rey out by Force pushing her into a tree. A desperate and terrified Finn comes to her aid immediately. Ren angrily accuses Finn of being a traitor, and Finn pulls out Luke's old lightsaber and attacks him in a rage. Ren is already badly injured, bleeding out of his abdomen from the bowcaster wound, but even so is too much for Finn. Finn manages to deal him a glancing wound, but nonetheless Ren quickly overpowers the former stormtrooper and deals him a grievous injury to his back. Ren tries to use [[telekinesis]] to pick up the lightsaber his grandfather built, but it resists his pull and instead flies to Rey, who has awakened from her stupor.

[[File:Poe_blowing_up_Starkiller_Base.png|thumb|left|250px|Poe flies in and destroys the Starkiller's thermal oscillator.]]
During this time, Chewie detonates the thermal detonators in the base, allowing Poe to lead a squadron of X-wings into the trenches of Starkiller Base. Poe finds an opening in the thermal oscillator and enters, while a following TIE crashes, unable to execute the same flight maneuver. Inside, Poe fires volley after volley of [[Proton torpedo|torpedoes]] into the oscillator, destroying the Starkiller's thermal oscillator thirty seconds before it finishes draining the sun to completely charge its primary weapon. This causes a chain reaction to go off, which destroys the base and levels the entire planet's terrain - without the weapon to dissipate it, the stored solar energy begins tearing the planet apart from the inside.

[[File:Kylo_Ren_duels_Rey.png|thumb|right|250px|Rey and Kylo Ren duel on Starkiller Base.]]
Rey and Ren continue fighting: Ren has taken even more wounds, from Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey, but even so initially holds the advantage, drawing on his rage to ignore the pain. Ren becomes so impressed with Rey that he tries to tempt her, complimenting her strength with the Force and offering to complete her training if she joins him. This backfires, however, as it only serves to reassure Rey of her own power, she begins to draw on the Force to hone her attacks, and the tide of the duel shifts. Ultimately, Rey is able to overpower Ren and deal him a severe wound to his face while severing his lightsaber in two. By this point, Kylo has taken too many wounds to continue standing, but he still struggles in vain to rise again. Before Rey can move in to finish him off, a large trench forms between them as the base begins to fall apart.

Rey returns to Finn, despairing that Finn is not waking up and that they are trapped on the rupturing planet. However, Chewbacca arrives with the ''Millennium Falcon'' to rescue them. Inside the main base, chaos reigns as General Hux has already fled, and the other officers rush to abandon the installation as well. Hux, meanwhile, reports to Snoke, who orders him to rescue Ren and flee the base, so Ren can finish his training. The ''Millennium Falcon'' and the remainder of the Resistance fleet manage to escape Starkiller Base as it erupts into a ball of fire. They then enter hyperspace to return to D'Qar.

===Locating Luke Skywalker===
{{Quote|May the Force be with you.|Leia to Rey|<ref name="TFA" />}}
The Resistance celebrates their victory while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 suddenly awakens and reveals that he holds the map to Luke's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one BB-8 was given by Poe. Together they complete the map and reveal the location of [[Ahch-To]], the planet on which Luke Skywalker sought out the first Jedi Temple. As the unconscious Finn recovers in the medical unit, Rey kisses him on the head and thanks him for everything.

[[File:Luke_and_Rey_on_Ahch-To.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey finds Luke Skywalker on the oceanic planet of Ahch-To.]]
With R2-D2 and Chewbacca in tow, Rey leaves on the ''Millennium Falcon'' and follows the map to the distant planet, a water world dotted with islands, which she had previously seen in her visions. Rey pilots the starship to a [[Temple Island|particular island]] with a large, ancient [[Jedi village|stone village]] on it. She climbs the rock-carved steps to the [[Saddle (Ahch-To)|top of the island]], where she finds Luke Skywalker. Without exchanging any words, Rey presents him with his father's lightsaber.

He said, "Had Chewbacca not been where he was, you probably wouldn't have thought of it. But because he was right there, passed by Leia, it felt almost like a slight, which was definitely not the intention."<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/leia-hugging-rey-jj-abrams-force-awakens|title=Exclusive: J.J.
