==Synopsis==
[[The Grim Reaper|Grim]] desperately needs one more soul to win his work competition, but his last scheduled collection at a rigorous bike race turns his world upside-down. At the finish line, he learns that life is not always about the trophy at the end of the race.

==Plot==
[[The Grim Reaper|Grim]] wants to become Death of the Year, but he must first take the soul of a cyclist during a big bike race. However, the cyclist is determined to get to the end and Grim, who is accompanied by his touch pad telling him how many souls he has acquired, grabs a bike (after accidentally offing someone else) and gives chase.

Throughout the entire race, Grim continues to accidentally kill other bystanders due to his large scythe where his soul count continues to, ironically, shrink down. Eventually, the cyclist and Grim make it to the end where the cyclist slows down to let Grim cross the finish line. As the cyclist hugs and kisses his wife, Grim, who was preparing to finish his job, suddenly has an epiphany and nostalgically remembers kissing his loved one throughout his "life", leading to the "birth" of his child whom he kisses.

Almost without warning, Grim takes off on his bike and rides away; swiping a woman's bouquet of flowers as he does so. In a post credit scene, Grim attempts to kiss his wife after she had just given birth, but she is too tired to accept it.
