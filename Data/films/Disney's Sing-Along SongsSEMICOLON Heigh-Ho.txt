==Trivia==
*Hosted by [[Professor Owl]].
*Released in 1987 to promote the theatrical re-release of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' on the film's 50th anniversary.
*Though designated in [[1990]] as Volume One (just as ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' is "Animated Feature #1"), ''Sing-Along Songs: Heigh-Ho'' was the second release, preceded by ''Sing-Along Songs: [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah|Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]]'' (1986).
*There is extensive use of footage from ''[[Melody (Adventures in Music)|Adventures in Music: Melody]]'', and ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]'' throughout the entire program with a new script synced to the old video.
*When Professor Owl introduces "Up, Down, Touch the Ground", clips from ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' are shown.
*The names of the seven dwarfs are in the [[Magic Mirror]] after "The Silly Song".
*The [[1993]] edition features a preview for all eleven numbered volumes to date.
*Footage of Pirates of the Caribbean in the song "Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)" was taken from ''[[Disneyland: From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow]]'', which aired [[January 21]], [[1968]].
*"The Siamese Cat Song" was cut from the [[1994]] print, but returns in ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Honor to Us All|Honor to Us All]]'' and is retained on the Spanish version.
*"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)" was also cut from the 1993 and 1994 prints, but is retained on the Spanish version.
*The 1993 edition includes the remixed closing theme, which was also heard in ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Friend Like Me|Friend Like Me]]'', ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life|Circle of Life]]'', and ''Collection of All Time Favorites''. The 1994 edition does not have the remixed closing theme music at all.
*The 3rd series edition (1994) incorporates the new themes introduced in ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Friend Like Me|Friend Like Me]]'', ''Circle of Life]]'', ''Collection of All Time Favorites'', and ''Honor to Us All''.
*The 1994 reprint is the rarest and hardest to find.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Blanca Nieves: Heigh-Ho]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain and the United States.
*Portions of the audio of "Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee" come from the audio of the Disneyland attraction, [[Pinocchio's Daring Journey]].
*In the end credits, most of the songs are not in the right order, except for the first two songs "Heigh-Ho" and "Up, Down, Touch the Ground" and the last two songs "The Siamese Cat Song" and "Let's Go Fly a Kite".
*This is the first video where Quantel Paintbox artist Mike Bonner is credited, though he wouldn't be credited for his actual job until ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Under the Sea|Under the Sea]]'', instead being listed under "special thanks".
