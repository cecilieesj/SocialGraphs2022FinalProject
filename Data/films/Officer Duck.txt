==Plot==
The episode starts off with Donald Duck portrayed as a police officer sleeping in his patrol car. He is called in by dispatch to head to 817 Gashouse Gardens to arrest Tiny Tom (Pete). He knocks on the door with the signature "Shave and a Haircut" knock. He tells Tom he is under arrest, to which he resists, He throws Donald on a clothesline and Donald lands on a blanket and a mop, which disguises him as a dog, this forces Donald to improvise. When he knocks on Toms door again Tom grabs a nearby machine gun and blasts the door. He looks outside to find a baby (Donald ironically disguised as the baby) at his doorstep. He reads the letter to which believes that his old partner Trigger left him in care. Tom takes him inside and suddenly steps on the blanket to reveal shackles and questions the baby, he realizes they are "toys" left by Trigger. After many attempts to arrest him, Donald finds the opportunity to grab Tom's gun. Tom surrenders but knocked the gun out of Donaldâ€™s hand at the same time. Tom chases after Donald around the city only to find the entire city police force marching down the road and ends up on his way to jail.
