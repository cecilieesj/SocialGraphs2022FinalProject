{{Quote|Whether or not all nine or twelve films actually get made depends on how George feels as time goes along. The series may happen the way he originally planned or may completely change.

The '''sequel trilogy''' is the third installment of films of the [[Star Wars saga|''Star Wars'' saga]] to be produced. It begins thirty [[Standard year|years]] after [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] and focuses on [[Cold War|a]] [[First Order-Resistance War|conflict]] between the [[First Order]], a military state and successor to the [[Galactic Empire]], and the [[Resistance]], a military group opposing the First Order and successor to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].

The films are produced by [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] President [[Kathleen Kennedy]], with [[Bad Robot Productions]] having also helped produce ''The Force Awakens''. The trilogy features the return of classic ''Star Wars'' characters [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[R2-D2]], [[C-3PO]], and [[Darth Sidious]] as well as a host of new characters, primarily focusing on the [[Force-sensitive]] [[scavenger]] [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], the deserter [[First Order]] [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]] and [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], the son of Leia Organa and Han Solo who is the [[master of the Knights of Ren]] and who had fallen into the [[dark side of the Force]].

Rumors of a sequel trilogy had been talked about for decades, ever since [[George Lucas]], the creator of ''Star Wars'', stated that he had plans for films that would take place after the [[Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. As the [[canon]] saga developed, however, Lucas denied that a sequel trilogy would ever be made, stating that ''Star Wars'' was the story of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and that his story ended in ''Return of the Jedi''. The development of the sequel trilogy was made official on [[October 30]], [[2012]], when [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced that it was acquiring Lucasfilm from Lucas and that they would be producing new ''Star Wars'' films beginning in [[2015]].

[[File:LucasPanavision-MOSW.png|thumb|left|250px|In 1978, George Lucas said there were twelve ''Star Wars'' stories.]]
Ideas for a ''[[Star Wars]]'' sequel trilogy were in place as early as [[1976]], during the filming of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|the original film]]. [[Mark Hamill]], who starred as [[Luke Skywalker]] in the film, recounted that [[George Lucas]] asked if he would be interested in appearing in Episode IX "around [[2011]]," when Lucas assumed such a film would be made.

According to [[Gary Kurtz]], the producer of ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Lucas's original ideas for the sequel trilogy (which he described as "very vague") were eventually condensed into [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']].<ref name="TFN-Kurtz">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|title=Gary Kurtz Reveals Original Plans for Episodes 1-9|author="Paul"|date=1999-05-26|work=[[TheForce.net]]|archivedate=20200607114151}}</ref><ref name="IGN-Kurtz">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/an-interview-with-gary-kurtz|title=An Interview with Gary Kurtz|author=P., Ken|date=2002-11-11|work=ign.com|archivedate=20200729152807}}</ref><ref name="FilmThreat">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/8|title=Gary Kurtz Interview: The Original ''Star Wars'' Producer Speaks|author=Gore, Chris|date=2000-03-05|work=filmthreat.com|archivedate=20120912205528}}</ref> As Lucas told [[Starlog (magazine)|''Starlog'']] in [[1981]], "&hellip;what seems like a great idea when it's described in three sentences doesn't hold together when you try to make five or six scenes out of it.

Pollock said these sequel trilogy drafts would "involve Luke Skywalker in his 30s and 40s" and that they would be "The three most exciting stories &hellip; They had propulsive action, really interesting new worlds, new characters.

[[File:HTTE-Legends.png|thumb|right|200px|''Heir to the Empire'' marked the beginning of a successful publishing program that continued the saga past ''Return of the Jedi''.]]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, stories began to appear that were set during the sequel time period, telling original stories of their own. The first attempt at filling this void was the ill-fated 1986 toy line ''[[The Epic Continues]]'', which involved the rise of the genetics master [[Atha Prime]] and the survival of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Tarkin]]. More notably, Timothy Zahn's [[1991]] novel ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' marked the beginning of the successful [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] of stories set after ''Return of the Jedi''. Luke started his own [[Jedi Praxeum|Jedi Academy]] and met and married a woman named [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], who was one of the Emperor's assistants. Together they had one child, [[Ben Skywalker]]. Han and Leia were married, and had three children: the twins [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]], as well as their younger sibling [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]]. Amidst their struggles to rebuild the Republic, they go up against villains such as [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] and the extragalactic aliens known as the [[Yuuzhan Vong]].{{Fact}}

Lucas finally contacted Iger in [[June]] 2012, at which point the two companies entered five months of acquisition negotiations.

Lucas has said that, whereas the prequel trilogy was about the father (Anakin) and the original trilogy was about the son (Luke), the sequels would've centered around the daughter (Leia) and the grandchildren (who were in their 20s<ref name="20s">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2015/05/george-lucas-explains-his-sequel.html|title=George Lucas Explains His Sequel Trilogy Treatment Featured Children "In Their 20s"|author=Jones, Dominic|date=2015-05-10|work=starwarsunderworld.com|archivedate=20200131122540}}</ref>).
