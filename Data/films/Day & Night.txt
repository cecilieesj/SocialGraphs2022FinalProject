==Plot==
When Day, a sunny fellow, encounters Night, a stranger of the dark, sparks fly! Day and Night are frightened and suspicious of each other at first, and quickly get off on the wrong foot. But as they discover each other's unique qualities -- and come to realize that each of them offers a different window onto the same world -- the friendship helps both to gain a new perspective.

==Voice Cast==
*Wayne Dyer as Radio Announcer (archive, uncredited)

==Production==
[[Teddy Newton]], whose previous work includes ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Ratatouille]]'', makes his directorial debut on the film. Unlike previous Pixar shorts, the animation style combines 2D and 3D elements, and ''[[Up]]'' production designer Don Shank says it is "unlike anything Pixar has produced before."

==Awards==
*Nominated: Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film
*Won: Visual Effects Society award for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Short
*Won: Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject

==Trivia==
*[[Teddy Newton]] included in the short a recording of a speech by the motivational speaker Wayne Dyer, which he had heard in his youth. It is heard as the radio broadcast in Day's window.<ref>http://www.pixar.com/short_films/Theatrical-Shorts/Day-and-Night Pixar.com</ref>
*The wolf inside Night's "window" is a modified version of [[Alpha]] from ''[[Up]]''.<ref>http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=4502729&id=35245929077&ref=fbx_album Disney•Pixar's Facebook</ref>
*The lumberjack chopping down a tree is [[Construction Foreman Tom|Tom]] from ''Up'' wearing different clothes.
*Teddy Newton, the director of the short, voiced [[Chatter Telephone]] in ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', the feature film that it was released with.
*The rainbow inside Day's "window" is also on the front door at [[Sunnyside Daycare]], one of the settings in ''Toy Story 3''.
*The sheep sound effects were from [[Billy, Goat, and Gruff]] in the first ''[[Toy Story]]'' movie, while the bicycle sound effect was used for [[Mutant Toys|Roller Bob]] in the ''[[Animated StoryBook: Toy Story]]'' on CD-ROM.
*The movie Day is watching is actually the ''[[The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour|Thunderbolt]]'' show from Walt Disney's animated ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'' film.
*Some of the cars watching the ''Thunderbolt'' show in Night's window are at least the same model as characters from ''[[Cars]]''.
*This is the first [[Pixar]] short to show the title at the end rather than the beginning. The second was ''[[La Luna]]''.
*The planes in Day's "window" seem to be a reference to the {{WikipediaLink|Red Arrows}}.
*The [[Wilhelm scream]] is heard during the movie scene when the cowboy shoots a man off-screen.
