'''''One Hour in Wonderland''''' is a [[1950]] television special made by [[Walt Disney Productions]]. It was first seen on Christmas Day, 1950, over [[NBC]] (4–5 pm in all time zones) for Coca-Cola, and was Walt Disney's first television production. It featured [[Walt Disney|Walt]] as host, with [[Bobby Driscoll]], [[Kathryn Beaumont]], [[Edgar Bergen|Edgar Bergen &amp; Charlie McCarthy]] (who appeared on radio for Coke), and other celebrities who worked with Walt, including the Firehouse Five Plus Two jazz band. This special was actually a promotional film for Disney's then-upcoming theatrical feature, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. Kathryn Beaumont, who was the voice of [[Alice]], was dressed like her character for this special.

This television special was included as a bonus feature on the Exclusive Archive Collection CAV Laserdisc, the Masterpiece and Un-Anniversary DVD editions of ''Alice in Wonderland'', as well as the 2011 Blu-ray release.

==Synopsis==
[[Edgar Bergen]] informs Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd that [[Walt Disney]] has invited them to a tea party. Charlie is hesitant to go, but reluctantly changes his mind when he learns [[Kathryn Beaumont]] will be there. While driving to the studio, Edgar tells the story of [[Alice in Wonderland]], much to Charlie's dismay. When they arrive, Walt Disney tells everyone that he was able to buy the Magic Mirror from [[Snow White]] (who apparently got it from the Wicked Queen). Charlie insults the mirror, calling it a "hopped-up television set." This enrages the mirror but Walt calms him down. The Mirror then shows everybody what they wish to see. He shows Kathryn a scene from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Charlie the [[Mickey Mouse]] short ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'' (although Charlie wanted to see himself), [[Bobby Driscoll]] a [[Br'er Rabbit]] story, Mortimer a [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] short, and Edgar a performance by Firehouse Five Plus Two. At the end of the song, they see Walt, and frantically finish a scene with [[Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum|Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]. The Mirror at first refuses to show the unfinished ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' film, but changes his mind when everyone wants to see it. The Mirror then reluctantly shows a scene from Alice in Wonderland. At the end of the special, Edgar has acquired the Magic Mirror. Charlie tries to make a deal with the mirror, but it turns out Mortimer is the new slave of the magic mirror. Charlie changes his mind and goes to sleep.

==Trivia==
*The opening scene with [[Santa Claus]] was filmed backwards so that he could appear to levitate the gifts out of the bag.
*While this program promotes Disney's upcoming film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', it features four cast members from Disney's next animated film ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'': Bobby Driscoll ([[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]]), Kathryn Beaumont ([[Wendy Darling]]), Hans Conried ([[Captain Hook]]/[[George Darling]]), and Bill Thompson ([[Mr. Smee]]). Before that, three of them also appeared in ''[[Walt Disney Christmas Show]]'' which had Bobby dressed as Peter, Kathryn dressed as Wendy, and Hans as the Magic Mirror once more.
*The Coca-Cola logo flashes while the credits are rolling and the announcer's voice is heard.
*While the credits are rolling, the announcer says "Now to make this Christmas Day complete, may we suggest that you and your family visit your local theater tonight to enjoy on the many fine movies playing in your city. In 1951, look for Walt Disney's Technicolor production, ''Alice in Wonderland''."
*From its original broadcast, the entire film, including the clips from Disney's cartoons and movies were in black and white, due to the original negatives of this film. On the Masterpiece Edition DVD of ''Alice in Wonderland'' (Disc 2), the whole program is still in black and white, except the cartoon and movie clips, which were collected from various color sources just for the DVD release.
*The films ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' and ''The Widow'' were mentioned by Kathryn Beaumont when she explains about Bobby Driscoll's Academy Award.
*"[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]" from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' plays over the opening credits; Walt exclaims the phrase to reveal the Magic Mirror.
*During the opening credits, there are dolls of [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[José Carioca]] and [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]] in Santa's bag.
*As of 2021, the inclusion of this on the Laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-ray releases of ''Alice in Wonderland'' are the only US video releases for any segment of ''Song of the South'' (unless one counts "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" and "[[How Do You Do?]]"'s inclusions on the ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs]]'' videos).
*The sequence where the Hatter and the Hare "fix" the White Rabbit's watch has very different background music than what was used in the final picture, which ended up using barely any music at all. This is especially noticeable during the "Mustard?! Don't let's be silly!" segment, when the wheels turning are still heard.
*The ending animation uses the same house used for Bergen's house in ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''.
