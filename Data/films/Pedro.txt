'''''Pedro''''' is a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated short that was originally the second segment of ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''. It was later released theatrically as an independent short, on [[May 13]], [[1955]] by [[RKO Radio Pictures]].

==Synopsis==
A small plane has to face the perils of delivering the mail over the treacherous Chilean Andes.

==Plot==
Set in an airport in [[Chile]], a [[Papa Plane|father]] and [[Mama Plane|mother plane]] live with their baby [[Pedro (character)|Pedro]] who wishes to be like his father who carries the mail between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. To do so, Pedro goes to school to study aviation, including geography about the mail route between Santiago and Mendoza by going over the Andes and the highest mountain [[Aconcagua]]. As Pedro's parents cannot do the mail route, he must fly to Mendoza to do the job, but his parents tell him to be safe on his flight and stay away from Aconcagua. As Pedro takes off to Mendoza, his first task was to pick up the mail at Mendoza. Pedro arrives at the Uspallata Pass where he flies perfectly until he sees Aconcagua on his path.

Going past Aconcagua, Pedro arrives in Mendoza, Argentina to pick up the mail. After Pedro picks up the mail, he was overjoyed that his parents would be proud of him for completing the task. Pedro then follows a nearby condor leading him back to Aconcagua as he forgot his responsibilities of what his parents told him (avoiding downdrafts and Aconcagua). Seeing Aconcagua, Pedro was afraid of the mountain and storms and is suddenly caught between a heavy rainstorm losing his vision on his way back to the airport, making it more challenging for Pedro to return back to the airport. As the narrator tells Pedro to fly over Aconcagua, he suddenly runs out of gas and is suddenly lost in the heavy storm. After Pedro's parents believe that their son is gone, Pedro arrives back to the airport in Santiago, Chile and actually survived the storm, carrying the mail safely only to find out that the mail is actually a postcard, making his parents proud and completing the task as Pedro feels satisfied of himself for finishing the task.
