'''''Writing Magic with Figment and Alice in Wonderland''''' is a [[1989]] educational [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated/live-action short produced for the [[Language Arts Through Imagination|''Language Arts Through Imagination'']] series starring [[Figment]] from [[Journey into Imagination|''Journey into Imagination'']] and characters from ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

==Summary==
While reading his favorite book, "Alice In Wonderland", Andy discovers that all signs of [[Alice]] are missing from his book. Alice has taken another wrong turn and ended up in Figonia! How will she get back to Wonderland? Through Figment's magic screen, cartoon characters reveal that to return, Alice must write a new story. Andy, Figment, and some of Alice's friends from Wonderland create a new story to "write" Alice back to Wonderland. As you might expect, in Figonia the story becomes real as it's told.

The audience is introduced to the techniques used to bring a story to life; brainstorming, writing, and rewriting are the keys to solving Alice's dilemma.

== Trivia ==
* As with [[Reading Magic with Figment and Peter Pan]], the theme song is not played and Alice's face can be seen alongside Figment's in the credits.
