'''''Gigantic''''' was a planned computer-animated musical comedy film produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. [[Nathan Greno]] (''[[Tangled]]'') and Meg LeFauve (''[[Inside Out]]'', ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'') were set to direct it, and it was initially scheduled to be the 59th animated feature in the [[Disney Animated Canon]], following the release of ''[[Frozen II]]'' in November 2019. On [[October 10]], [[2017]], Disney announced that the project had been cancelled.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-shelves-jack-beanstalk-film-gigantic-1047482 The Hollywood Reporter: Gigantic cancelled]</ref>

==Plot==
Set in [[Spain]] during the Age of Exploration, the film followed Jack as he discovers a world of giants hidden within clouds. Jack befriends the female giant Inma, who's "11 years old, 60 feet tall, fiery, feisty and a lot to control" and treats him like a living doll, Greno said. Meanwhile, the antagonists, Storm Giants, stand at 120 feet.

==Development==
The film was officially announced on [[August 14]], [[2015]], by [[John Lasseter]], at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]]. The film is set to be a musical, with songs written by [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] and [[Robert Lopez]], who previously wrote the music for the Academy Award-winning film, ''[[Frozen]]'', in [[2013]]. The pair won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for "[[Let It Go]]". [[Dorothy McKim]], who produced the acclaimed short ''[[Get a Horse!]]'', was announced as the producer of the film.

After the official announcement of ''Gigantic'', [[Raymond S. Persi]] confirmed on social media that he would be story boarding for the film.<ref>"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/151818-Giants.html Disney Giants To Be Gigantic]". ''Big Cartoon Blog'', August 16, 2014</ref>

On October 3, 2016, writer Meg LeFauve was announced to join the film as a co-director alongside Greno.<ref name="slash" />

On April 25, 2017, Disney announced that the release date had been pushed up to November 25, 2020, from its previous release date of November 21, 2018.

==Trivia==
*Gigantic was pushed back to 2018 in 2015 and was originally set to be entitled ''Giants''.
*Among [[Duke Weaselton]]'s bootleg discs in ''[[Zootopia]]'' is one for an animal version called ''Giraffic'', with Jack, played by a squirrel, climbing a giraffe neck instead of a beanstalk.
*''Gigantic'' was originally scheduled to be released on March 9, 2018. However, on June 30, 2016, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced that ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' would be released on that date, and ''Gigantic'' would launch instead on November 21, 2018. The film would be delayed ''again'' for a 2020 release, after ''Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2'' took the previous November 21, 2018 release, until eventually being pulled from Disney's film slate.
