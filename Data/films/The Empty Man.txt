The criticism was aimed at the script, plot, characters, performances, and runtime.

Barry Hertz of ''The Globe and Mail'' gave the film 2/4, writing: "Producers couldn't have picked a better title, though. After I left my Friday afternoon screening, attended by a whopping two other people, I felt far from satisfied. Empty, you might say." Writing for ''The Only Critic'', Nate Adams gave it a "D−", summarizing that "running an overlong two hours and twenty minutes, ''The Empty Man'' – probably the bastard cousin twice removed from ''The Bye Bye Man'' or ''Slender Man'', not good company – is a total bore".

Michael Gingold of ''Rue Morgue'' gave the film a positive review, saying its "not at all the movie that its trailers are selling, and in this case, that's a good thing".
