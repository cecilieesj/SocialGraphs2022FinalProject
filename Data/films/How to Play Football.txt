'''''How to Play Football''''' is a [[1944]] ''[[Goofy]]'' cartoon directed by [[Jack Kinney]].

==Plot==
The Goofies of Taxidermy Tech take on the Goofies of Anthropology A and M. While they are playing, the narrator tells the viewers how the game of football is played as well as give play-by-play commentary.

==Notes==
*It was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Animated Short Subject category, but lost to the ''Tom and Jerry'' short film "Mouse Trouble".
*The original title cards were done entirely on animated placards in a football stadium.
*When the narrator explains the rules of the game, he is drowned out by the roaring crowd for comedic purposes, but if you listen closely, he actually says, "Now the object of the game is, (drowned out by crowd) to pass the ball over the goal line of the opposing team by hook or crook. There are eleven men on either team, two ends... (crowd stops) and that's how the game is played!"
