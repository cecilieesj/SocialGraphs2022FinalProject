==Trivia==
*The film's copyright was renewed on [[December 16]], [[1957]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3111213li/page/119/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries (1957 renewals)]</ref>
*In ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', the puppies are seen watching this on television when they are in DeVil Manor.
*The music in the latter half of the short was used for the ''[[Dance of the Hours|Dance of the Hour]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia]]''.
*On the ''More Silly Symphonies'' DVD set, the shot of the frogs dancing (right before the bird shows up) was accidentally looped a second longer, resulting in the rest of the short falling out of sync with the audio.
