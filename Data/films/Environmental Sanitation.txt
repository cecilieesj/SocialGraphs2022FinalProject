*Careless Charlie was the main "character" Disney used to present health issues in the CIAA shorts. At the start of each short, Careless Charlie- a poor Latin husband and father- does everything wrong that is causing the health problems. By the end of each short, Careless Charlie understands what needs to be done and becomes Careful Charlie.
