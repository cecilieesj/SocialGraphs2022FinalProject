'''''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest''''' is a [[2006]] American adventure fantasy comedy film and the second film of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series]], following ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. It was directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], written by [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. In the film, the marriage of [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) and [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) is interrupted by [[Cutler_Beckett|Lord Cutler Beckket]] ([[Tom Hollander]]), who wants Turner to acquire Sparrow's [[Jack Sparrow's compass|compass]], and [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) discovers his debt to [[Davy Jones]] ([[Bill Nighy]]) is due.

Two sequels to ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' were conceived in [[2004]], with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. Filming took place from February to September [[2005]] in Palos Verdes, Saint Vincent, the Grenadines, Dominica, and The Bahamas, as well as on sets constructed at Walt Disney Studios. It was shot back-to-back with the third film of the series, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]''.

''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' was released in the [[United States]] on [[July 7]], [[2006]]. The film received positive reviews, with praise for its plot, performances specially that of Depp and special effects but criticism for its running time. Despite this, it set several records in its first three days, with an opening weekend of $136&nbsp;million in the United States, and it was, at the time, the fastest film ever to gross over $1&nbsp;billion in the worldwide box office. As of January 2020, it ranks as the 33rd highest-grossing film of all time worldwide and the 18th highest-grossing Disney film. It was the first Disney film to gross $1 billion and the third film in history (after ''Titanic ''and ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'') to do so and was at the time of its release the third highest-grossing film of all time worldwide (behind'' Titanic'' and ''The Return of the King''), the highest-grossing Disney film until it was surpassed by ''[[Toy Story 3]] ''in 2010 and the highest-grossing live-action Disney film until it was surpassed by ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]] ''in 2012. The film received four Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and won the Academy Award for Visual Effects.

==Synopsis==
Charming rogue pirate [[Captain]] [[Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) is back for a grand, swashbuckling, nonstop joyride filled with devilish pirate humor, monstrous sea creatures, and breathtaking [[Magic|black magic]]. Now Jack's got a blood debt to pay&mdash;he owes his soul to the legendary [[Davy Jones]] ([[Bill Nighy]]), ghostly Ruler of the Ocean Depths&mdash; but the ever so crafty Jack isn't about to go down without a fight. Along the way, dashing [[William Turner Jr.|Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) and the beautiful [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) get up in the thrilling whirlpool of misadventures stirred up in Jack's quest to avoid eternal damnation by seizing the fabled Dead Man's Chest!

==Plot==
It is the wedding day of [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) and [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]). However, the arrival of Lord [[Cutler Beckett]] ([[Tom Hollander]]) in [[Port Royal]] disrupts proceedings, as both Will and Elizabeth are arrested on the charge of setting free an enemy of the crown: [[Captain]] [[Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]), whom Beckett also wishes to track down.

Jack has his own set of troubles to worry about, however. A debt he made with [[Davy Jones]] ([[Bill Nighy]]) to raise the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' from the depths of the ocean thirteen years ago is set to be paid, and Jack does not wish to bind himself to a lifetime of servitude as part of Jones' crew. Instead, he sets out to locate the Dead Man's Chest and the key that opens it, in order to gain control over Jones himself. Jack escapes from a Turkish prison with a drawing of the key, and sets off to track it down. Meanwhile, Cutler Beckett strikes a deal with Will Turner, wishing for him to obtain [[Jack Sparrow's compass]] in exchange for a full pardon. Will remains dubious, but is left with no other choice.

[[File:Bill_marks_Jack.png|thumb|left|250px]]
By this point, Jack has begun his voyage, though is unable to discern any resolute course from his compass. He descends to the lower deck to search for more rum, where he encounters William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]). Turner had chosen to serve Davy Jones after being sent to the bottom of the ocean by [[Hector Barbossa]]&mdash;as a cursed man, unable to die. He warns Jack that his time is up, and that Jones has released the [[Kraken]] to bring Jack in. Before departing, Bootstrap marks Jack with the Black Spot, a sign that the Kraken is coming for him. Terrified, Jack orders [[Joshamee Gibbs]] (Kevin R. McNally) to head for land&mdash;any land&mdash;to avoid this terrible beast. In the confusion, [[Jack (monkey)|Jack the monkey]] knocks Sparrow's hat into the sea, where it is carried far from its owner. It ends up in the hands of two fishermen, whose ship is suddenly dragged under the water by an unseen creature.

In the prisons at Fort Charles, Will informs Elizabeth of his plan to track down Jack, but Governor [[Weatherby Swann]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) does not trust Will to free both himself and Elizabeth. As Will begins his search in [[Tortuga]], Weatherby procures passage back to [[England]] for himself and his daughter. Will's search ends on Isla de Pelegostos, where the ''Black Pearl'' has been beached. As he explores the nearby tropical forest, Will is captured by the native Pelegostos, and taken to a mountaintop village. There, he finds Jack acting as chief of the tribe, and though Sparrow does nothing to help Will in his predicament, he does whisper, "Save me!" before Will is taken away. Back in Port Royal, Governor Swann releases Elizabeth and makes for a rendezvous with Captain [[Hawkins]], only to find Beckett's henchman, Mercer (David Schofield), waiting for him. Elizabeth, however, uses Mercer's appearance as a diversion, escaping back to Fort Charles, where she confronts Lord Beckett at the end of a pistol. Beckett makes a deal with her, giving her the Letters of Marque in exchange for Jack's compass. She leaves, and stows away, disguised as a sailor boy, aboard the ''Edinburgh Trader''.

Meanwhile, another prison break has occurred, and now [[Pintel]] ([[Lee Arenberg]]) and [[Ragetti]] (Mackenzie Crook) are making their way to Pelegosto Island along with the [[Prison Dog]]. They reach land, and set about preparing to take the ''Pearl'' as their own. Elsewhere on the island, Will Turner is being held inside one of two bone cages suspended over a ravine, along with the surviving crew of the ''Pearl''. Gibbs informs him that the Pelegostos believe Jack is a god in human form, and intend to free his divine spirit by roasting and eating his "fleshy prison". The crew attempts to swing their cages across the chasm to climb up the other side. However, Leech spurs his crewers on to compete with Will and the others, and in their haste, tumble from the side of the cliff and plummet into the ravine. This draws the attention of a sentry, who runs to warn the villagers.

[[File:Jack_escaping_Pall.png|thumb|250px|[[Jack Sparrow|Jack]] chased by the Pelegostos.]]
The sentry inadvertently buys Jack some time, as his arrival coincides with the Pelegostos' attempt to roast Jack alive. He escapes while the villagers race to kill their prisoners, but meets further resistance as he makes his way through the village. As Will and the crew roll through the jungle, still trapped inside their cage, Jack falls into a ravine, though his fall is broken by the pole he is tied to, and a series of wooden bridges.

The crew makes it back to the ''Pearl'' just as [[Pintel]] and [[Ragetti]], recently escaped from jail with help from the Prison Dog, are attempting to commandeer the ship. Jack himself arrives, pursued by the entire Pelegostos tribe, though manages to board the ship before they can catch him. Instead, their attention is drawn by the dog, who runs off into the jungle, chased by the natives.

Once back on the water, Will reveals he requires Jack's compass, though Jack brushes him off, instead ordering Gibbs to head upriver. He then proceeds to explain, using Will's naivety concerning Davy Jones, that the key Jack is looking for will enable Will to rescue Elizabeth. Elizabeth herself has departed Port Royal onboard the ''Edinburgh Trader'', and begins to arouse the crew's superstitions when they come to believe her dress belongs to the spirit of a vengeful woman. By now, the ''Pearl's'' crew has taken to the longboats and heads up the Pantano River into Cypress Forest, for a meeting with the voodoo priestess, [[Tia Dalma]]. There, Dalma senses a "touch of destiny" about Will, and tells the tale of Davy Jones to her audience. She reveals that Jones, once in love, tried to spare himself the heartbreak of losing his love by cutting out his own heart, and locking it away in a chest. She also informs Jack that Jones keeps the key about his person at all times, and offers him a jar of dirt, explaining that, as Jones is unable to set foot on land for another decade, Jack should keep land about him for protection. Dalma then divines the location of the ''Flying Dutchman'', for which the ''Pearl'' sets sail.

Will Turner volunteers to head over to what he believes is the ''Dutchman'' and negotiate for Jack's soul. However, he is unaware that the wrecked ship he boards is not Jones' ship, which bursts out of the water in front of him as Will explores the vessel. He is surrounded by Jones' crewmen, who have served for so long on the ''Dutchman'' that various sea creatures have been assimilated into their bodies. Will is knocked out and lined up with the survivors of the wreck. Davy Jones reveals himself, proposing a deal with any who would rather serve aboard his ship than face their final judgment in death. One man refuses, and is killed, while others are forced to agree. Jones realizes Will is neither dead nor dying, and demands to know his purpose. Will reveals that Jack Sparrow sent him to settle his debt, and Jones uses his supernatural power to bring himself, along with his crew, aboard the ''Black Pearl'' to confront Sparrow himself. Jack tries to tell Jones that he (Jack) was only Captain for 2 years until Barbossa's mutiny, but Jones refuses to accept that and reminds him he has introduced himself as ''Captain'' Jack Sparrow for all these years. Jack negotiates with Davy Jones, and is given three days to find one hundred souls to serve Jones&mdash;the first being Will himself, still aboard the ''Dutchman''. Jones removes the Black Spot, and Jack immediately heads for Tortuga to harvest the souls.

[[File:Norrington_introduced.png|thumb|250px|left|[[James Norrington]] joining the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]''.]]
Elizabeth is also on her way to Tortuga, after again using the ''Edinburgh'' crew's superstitions against them. She makes them believe the spirit is asking them to go to Tortuga, and writes the name in oil on the ship's deck, setting it on fire to get their attention. In the ''Faithful Bride'' tavern, Gibbs begins recruiting sailors to sail aboard the ''Pearl''&mdash;and ultimately be handed over to Jones&mdash;though manages only to recruit four. The fifth reveals himself as [[James Norrington]], former Commodore, having been disgraced after piloting his ship into a hurricane while pursuing Jack and the ''Black Pearl''. He starts a bar brawl after attempting to shoot Jack, which is joined by Elizabeth as Jack and his crew sneak out. Elizabeth knocks Norrington unconscious before he can do any more damage, and he is thrown into the pigsty. Mercer watches these proceedings, and later offers Norrington a deal on behalf of Lord Beckett.

[[File:Will_steals_the_key.png|thumb|250px|Will stealing the Key to the Dead Man's Chest.]]
Meanwhile, aboard the ''Flying Dutchman'', Bootstrap Bill is reunited with his long-lost son after Jimmy Legs orders "Mr. Turner" to secure the mast tackle. Both Turners attempt the procedure, and when Bill encounters his son, lets go of the line, causing Will to drop a hoisted cannon into the deck. For his apparent mistake, Jimmy Legs prepares to whip Will, but Bootstrap intervenes, revealing to Davy Jones that he is the boy's father. Cruelly, Jones forces Bootstrap to whip his own son, though Bootstrap insists it was an act of compassion compared to the severe lashing Jimmy Legs would have inflicted.

[[File:2kraken.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Kraken]] destroys the ''Edinburgh Trader''.]]
Back in Port Royal, Beckett meets with a manacled Governor Swann and informs him that Elizabeth has been sighted by Mercer in the company of Sparrow and "other fugitives from justice". He convinces an extremely reluctant Swann to relinquish his authority to him, in order to assure Elizabeth's safety. On the ''Flying Dutchman'', Will meets his father, and they both play Davy Jones at Liar's Dice in an attempt to win the key. They lose, but Will later steals it and rows to a ship (the ''Edinburgh Trader''). Davy Jones realizes this means that Jack is after his heart. He catches the ''Edinburgh Trader'' and summons the Kraken which destroys the ship and kills all aboard (except for Will, who escapes), while Davy Jones sets sail for the island the heart is buried on.

[[File:Jack with the heart.png|thumb|Jack opens the chest.|250px]]
Both crews arrive at the island at much the same time, although Davy Jones sends his sailors to retrieve the chest as he cannot set foot on land for another decade. Jack, Norrington, and Elizabeth use the compass to find the chest. Will appears and is reunited with Elizabeth. They embrace and Will kisses her before digging up the chest. However, a three-way sword fight ensues between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective purposes: Will wants to stab the heart and kill Davy Jones to free his father (which Jack won't allow since there will be nobody to call off the Kraken), Jack wants to use the heart to blackmail Davy Jones into negating his debt, and Norrington wants to give the heart to Beckett and regain his life in the British navy. As they are occupied, Davy Jones's crew arrives and attack Ragetti and Pintel who have taken the chest while Jack, Will, and Norrington fight each other.

Elizabeth chases both Ragetti and Pintel, eventually fleeing and fighting with them as Davy Jones' crew catches up with the chest they were carrying. They manage to fight them as Jack manages to get away from Will and Norrington. He opens the dropped chest, taking Davy Jones' heart and closing it again. He puts it in the jar of dirt he brought with him when he runs and makes it back to the longboat. Eventually, while Jack is distracted, Norrington sees both the chest and the jar of dirt in the longboat. In the confusion, Norrington secretly steals the heart from the jar and runs off, pretending to lure away Davy Jones' crew. Jack, still thinking that he has the heart, flees with the others. Norrington is cornered by Davy Jones' crew, but plays the coward and drops the chest so they will let him go.

Escaping the island, the Pearl is finally caught by the Kraken. After a vicious struggle, the jar holding the dirt is broken and emptied revealing that the heart is no longer in it. Jack frantically searches what is left (frantically exclaiming, "Where's the thump-thump?!") as the crew prepares to defend the ship from the Kraken. During the battle, Elizabeth catches sight of Jack rowing away from the boat, calling him a coward. Later on, as Jack is rowing away from the embattled ship, he is shown looking at his compass before deciding whether or not to go back and help. Will and the rest of the crew have managed to put together a trap to help defend the ship and it is during that final battle against the Kraken that Elizabeth runs into Jack who has returned. He fires a shot into the trap of gunpowder that drives the Kraken away for the moment, but it is enough to buy the crew time to escape. He gives the painful order to abandon ship.

However, Elizabeth realizes the Kraken is specifically after Jack. She kisses him passionately, and as she does, Will (who is climbing down the ship to the wooden "lifeboat") witnesses the kiss but says nothing, although he is clearly hurt. Elizabeth uses the opportunity to chain Jack to the mast as the rest of the crew escape from the ship. Jack has seemingly decided to show his good side by returning to help at the risk of his own life, while Elizabeth for once throws her own sense of honor and decency to the wind, both by kissing Jack, and by chaining him to the mast to save herself. She tells everybody in the lifeboat they escape in that Jack has "elected" to remain aboard and go down with his ship and they sail away from the Black Pearl. Jack manages to slip out of his shackles just as the Kraken appears on all sides of the ship, trapping him. Jack grabs a sword and smiles saying, "Hello, beastie," and attacks the Kraken as it destroys the Black Pearl and drags her underwater to her grave. Davy Jones sees this and proclaims Jack's debt fulfilled. However, he then realizes that something is not right and asks to see the "chest". After realizing his heart has been stolen and believing Jack had it when the Kraken killed him, he looks up into the sky and shouts, "Damn you, Jack Sparrow!"

Norrington is found by ships from the East India Trading Company and is taken to Port Royal. There, he reappears and reports to Beckett with the Letters of Marque. To Beckett's surprise, Norrington does not deliver Sparrow's magical compass as Beckett hoped, but another, more powerful item, the heart of Davy Jones. The ''Pearl's'' survivors revisit Tia Dalma where they drink a toast to Jack, during which time Will is still distrustful of Elizabeth following the kiss he witnessed. Will tries to comfort her, mistaking her guilt for sadness, by promising that if anything could be done to save Jack that he would do it. Tia interrupts Will before he can finish and questions how far he or the rest of the crew would truly be willing to go to save Captain Jack, Will, Elizabeth, and the crew unanimously agree to travel to the World's End to save Jack. A now cheerful Tia explains that they will need a captain who knows those waters. Just as she finishes these words, footsteps are heard coming down the stairs. Everyone gathers around to see discover, to their surprise, that it is none other than the formerly dead Captain [[Hector Barbossa]] who exclaims, "So tell me, what's become of my ship?" before biting into a green apple, free of the curse that had plagued him once before.

==Production==
===Development===
Following the success of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' (2003), the cast and crew signed on for two more sequels to be shot back-to-back, a practical decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writer Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio decided not to make the sequels new adventures featuring the same characters, as with the ''Indiana Jones'' and ''James Bond'' series, but to retroactively turn ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]]'s embrace at the end of the first film, and initially considered the [[Fountain of Youth]] as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the ''Flying Dutchman'' and the Kraken. They also introduced the historical East India Trading Company, who for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.

Planning on the film began in June 2004, and production was much larger than ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'', which was only shot on location in St. Vincent. This time, the sequels would require fully working ships, with a working ''[[Black Pearl]]'' built over the body of an oil tanker in Bayou La Batre, Alabama. By November, the script was still unfinished as the writers did not want director Gore Verbinski and producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] to compromise what they had written, so Verbinski worked with James Byrkit to storyboard major sequences without need of a script, while Elliott and Rossio wrote a "preparatory" script for the crew to use before they finished the script they were happy with. By January 2005, with rising costs and no script, Disney threatened to cancel the film, but changed their minds. The writers would accompany the crew on location, feeling that the lateness of their rewrites would improve the spontaneity of the cast's performances.

===Filming===

Filming for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' began on February 28, 2005, in Palos Verdes, beginning with Elizabeth's ruined wedding day. The crew spent the first shooting days at Walt Disney Studios in Los Angeles, including the interiors of the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Edinburgh Trader'' which Elizabeth stows away on, before moving to St. Vincent to shoot the scenes in [[Port Royal]] and Tortuga. Sets from the previous film were reused, having survived three hurricanes, although the main pier had to be rebuilt as it had collapsed in November. The crew had four tall ships at their disposal to populate the backgrounds, which were painted differently on each side for economy. One of the ships used was the replica of the HMS ''Bounty'' used in the 1962 film adaptation of ''Mutiny on the Bounty''.

On April 18, 2005, the crew began shooting at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected as he felt it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for. That was exactly the problem during production: the Dominican government were completely unprepared for the scale of a Hollywood production, with the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island and having trouble moving around on the underdeveloped roads. The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the Pelegosto and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief. Dominica was also used for [[Tia Dalma]]'s shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.

The crew moved to a small island called White Cay in the Bahamas for the beginning and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the ''Flying Dutchman'' were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working ''Black Pearl'' and ''Flying Dutchman''. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.

===Special effects===
The ''Flying Dutchman's'' crew members were originally conceived by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio as ghosts, but Gore Verbinski disliked this and designed them as physical creatures. Their hierarchy is reflected by how mutated they were: newcomers had low level infections which resemble rosacea, while the most mutated had full-blown undersea creature attributes. Verbinski wanted to keep them realistic, rejecting a character with a turtle shell, and the animators watched various David Attenborough documentaries to study the movement of sea anemones and mussels. All of the crew are computer-generated, with the exception of [[Stellan Skarsgård]], who played [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|"Bootstrap" Bill Turner]]. Initially his prosthetics would be augmented with CGI but that was abandoned. Skarsgård spent four hours in the make-up chair and was dubbed "Bouillabaisse" on set.

Captain Davy Jones had originally been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles; the skin of the character is based on a blurred version of the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup. To portray Jones on set, [[Bill Nighy]] wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at [[Industrial Light & Magic]] did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to splice into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his "beard" as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.

The Kraken was difficult to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'' which had a real octopus crawling over miniatures. On the set, two pipes filled with 30,000 pounds of cement were used to crash and split the ''Edinburgh Trader'': Completing the illusion are miniature masts and falling stuntmen shot on a bluescreen stage. The scene where the Kraken spits at [[Jack Sparrow]] does not use computer-generated spit: it was real gunge thrown at [[Johnny Depp]].

==Release==

''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' premiered at [[Disneyland]] in California on June 24, 2006. It was the first Disney film to use the new computer-generated [[Walt Disney Pictures]] production logo, which took a year for the studio to design. Weta Digital was responsible for the logo's final animated rendering and [[Mark Mancina]] was hired to score a new composition of "[[When You Wish Upon A Star]]".

===Home media===
The film became available on DVD on December 5, 2006 for Region 1 and sold 9,498,304 units in its first week of sales (equivalent to $174,039,324). In total it sold 16,694,937 units, earning $320,871,909. It was the best-selling DVD of 2006 in terms of units sold and second in terms of sales revenue behind ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.

The versions for Regions 2 and 4 had already been released on November 15, 2006 and November 20, 2006, respectively. The DVD, incompatible with some Region 1 hardware DVD Players due to the use of ARccOS Protection, came in single and two-disc versions. Both contained a commentary track with the screenwriters and a gag reel, with the double-disc featuring a video of the film premiere and a number of documentaries, including a full-length documentary entitled "According to the Plan" and eight featurettes. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on May 22, 2007.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
After months of anticipation and industry hype, reviews for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' were positive: the film scored a 53% rating on [[Wikipedia:Rotten Tomatoes|Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of 1000.2000/300. Drew McWeey was highly positive, comparing the film to ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'', and also acclaimed its darkness in its depiction of the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' and its cliffhanger. The completely computer-generated Davy Jones turned out to be so realistic that some reviewers mistakenly identified Nighy as wearing prosthetic makeup. 
Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars saying "Depp is once again an unmitigated joy as Captain Sparrow, delivering another eye-darting, word-slurring turn with some wonderful slapstick flourishes. Indeed, Rossio and Elliot smartly exploit these in some wonderful action set-pieces." "We don’t get the predictable ‘all friends together on the same quest’ structure, and there’s a surfeit of surprises, crosses and double-crosses, and cheeky character beats which stay true to the heroic sense of fun." 
Lord McLovin of MovieWeb said "The second tale of Captain Jack Sparrow is another epic adventure!"

==Trivia==
*The film is the only film from the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)]] to win an Oscar for Best Visual Effects while the other films were nominated.
*This film takes place a year after ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''.
*According to some rumors, the first proposed title for the second movie was ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Treasures of the Lost Abyss''.
*Three famous paintings were used as the basis for the ''Dead Man's Chest'' poster; "''Capture of Kent by Surcouf''" by [[Wikipedia:Ambroise Louis Garneray|Ambroise Louis Garneray]], "''De Windstoot''" by [[Wikipedia:Willem van de Velde the Younger|Willem van de Velde the Younger]], and "''De Hollanders steken Engelse schepen in brand tijdens de tocht naar Chatham, 20 juni 1667''" by Jan van Leyden.
*The scene where Elizabeth kisses Jack and then handcuffs him to the mast may have been inspired by the film ''Hannibal'', in which Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter kiss, and Starling handcuffs Lecter's wrist to hers while he is distracted.
*The DVD cover of ''Dead Man's Chest'' is currently the only cover to have the least amount of characters featured on it: [[Johnny Depp]] (as Jack Sparrow), [[Orlando Bloom]] (as Will Turner), and [[Keira Knightley]] (as Elizabeth Swann). The other movies all have at least four characters included on the DVD cover.
*This is the first Disney film to use the previous [[Walt Disney Pictures logo|on-screen logo]] from 2006 to 2022, which consists of a realistic CGI castle situated on a blue-pink sky. It is also the first movie to contain the original “WALT DISNEY PICTURES” text edition of the logo until 2011. Since ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'', the text shortened to "DISNEY" until 2022.
*The clip where Jack Sparrow exclaims, “We have our heading” appears in the beginning of WDSHE’s “There is only one Disney” promo, which was seen on 2007-09 DVDs and Blu-rays.
