==Synopsis==
An itinerant orphan loses his defensive shell after meeting a warm and understanding family. A hard-shelled, itinerant orphan softens after meeting a warm and understanding family.

Butch Patrick stars as 'Bumper', a rebellious kid with a chip on his shoulder who learns the meaning of life when he's taken in by a shepherd. This movie is an emotional tear-jerker as Bumper tries his best to make it in the world alone. A real 'feel-good' movie. Classic entertainment from Walt Disney.

Filmed in high-resolution technicolor, this movie is stunningly beautiful. The sound is recorded in mono and is exceptionally good quality.

Butch Patrick gives a stellar performance as a 'tough little kid', ready to take on a man twice his size or even a bear three times his size!

Also stars Edward Andrews as Burt, Kim Hunter as Mrs. Williams, and Frank Silvera as Carlos.

You loved Butch Patrick as 'Edward Wolfgang (Eddie) Munster' in the 1964 TV series, "The Munsters", and you'll love him in this movie too!

A must see movie!
