==Plot==
Dr. Jonas Carson (Alan Thicke) creates an android that looks just like a human 17-year-old boy, and he "adopts" him as his son and as an older brother to Becky (Robyn Lively), who names him Chip. After the Carsons move to a new town, Chip (Jay Underwood) is enrolled in high school alongside Becky. Dr. Carson also begins teaching science at the school, so he can keep a close watch over his son's progress.

Dr. Carson's former employer, Gordon Vogel (Joseph Bologna), seeks to apprehend Carson's functional android, believing that he is entitled to this advanced technology since it was developed while Carson was under a contract that he didn't fulfill. Vogel has plans to turn Chip into a war-machine military project.
