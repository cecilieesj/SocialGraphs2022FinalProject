}} When [[Tim Burton]] was still a young animator at the [[Walt Disney Studios]], he had an idea to make a terror film in black and white. '''''Frankenweenie ''''' was to accompany the [[1984]] re-issue of ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', but [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] thought it was too dark and scary, and reserved the short for another use, leaving Burton frustrated and forcing him to leave the studio.
==Plot==
[[Victor Frankenstein]] (played by [[Barret Oliver]]) is an 11-year old boy who creates movies starring his dog, [[Sparky (Frankenweenie)|Sparky]] (a bull terrier, whose name is a joke on the use of electricity in the film). After Sparky is hit by a car, Victor learns at school about electrical impulses in muscles, and gets the idea to bring his pet back to life. He creates elaborate machines which bring down a bolt of lightning that revives the dog. While Victor is pleased, his neighbors are terrified by the animal, and when the Frankensteins decide to introduce the revitalized Sparky to them, they become angry and afraid.

Sparky runs away, with Victor in pursuit, and they find themselves at a local miniature golf course, and hide in its flagship windmill. The Frankensteins' neighbors, now an angry mob, arrive on the scene, and while using a cigarette lighter to try to see in, the windmill is accidentally lit on fire. Victor falls and is knocked out, but Sparky rescues him from the flames, in time to be crushed by the windmill. The mob realizes its error and use their cars, along with jumper cables, to "recharge" Sparky. He is revived, and all celebrate. Sparky later falls in love with a Poodle whose fur bears a strong resemblance to the hairdo of the Bride of Frankenstein.

==Controversy==
Burton was fired by Disney after the film was completed; the studio claimed that he had wasted company resources and felt the film was too scary for young audiences. It had been scheduled to debut theatrically in the U.S. before a re-release of ''Pinocchio'' on December 21, 1984, but was shelved. It did play in the UK in 1985 in front of Touchstone Pictures' ''[[Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend]]''. After the mainstream success of Burton's features ''Beetlejuice'', ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'', and ''Batman'', the film was given a home video release in 1992. It is currently available as an extra, along with ''Vincent'', on ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD for PSP, and is also available on [[Disney+]].

==Remake==
