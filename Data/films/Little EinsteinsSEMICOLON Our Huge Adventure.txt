'''''Little Einsteins: Our Huge Adventure''''' (stylized as '''''Little Einsteins: Our <strike>Big</strike> Huge Adventure''''') is a [[2005]] direct-to-video feature-length musical adventure film from [[Baby Einstein|The Baby Einstein Company]] and Curious Pictures.

The film would later be adapted into the TV series ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

==Plot==
The Little Einsteins go on a quest to get a lost caterpillar back home. Luckily, the caterpillar was safe and healthy enough to transform into a Monarch butterfly. The group hears about a grand family party (based off real Monarch migration) and they were invited, except for their butterfly. However, after searching in four butterfly mailboxes, they were able to find the right invitation. In the ending, the Little Einsteins and the butterfly visit Mexico where thousand of other Monarch butterflies rest.

==Trivia==

*This video would later be subsided into two episodes of the first season as "[[A Brand New Outfit]]" and "[[The Missing Invitation]]". This version has several parts edited out compared to the original DVD release.
**Some of these scenes include:
**#Leo yelling "Reverse paddles!"
**#The introduction to the characters
**#The "Lalala Buggy Wuggy" song
**#The team looking around the Wheatfield with Cypresses.
**#The team visiting New York City while going to the top of the Statue of Liberty so they can see all of Manhattan until they find the United Nations; a place where the next Butterfly Mailbox is in the garden.
**#Meeting the team for the rookies of their very first movie.
**#The team using the Musical Roller Coaster three times (they only use it once in the first episode).
**#The team noticing a sign that says "Crescendo" while traveling down the Niagara River.
**#Leo asking the viewers if they see Niagara Falls.
**#Rocket briefly flying over Niagara Falls.
**#Leo asking the viewers if they see the cave.
**#Other butterflies coming out of the Musical Tree of Many Colors.
**#The team passing by the little green truck before reaching the Musical Tree of Many Colors.
**#The team coming across the black, white, and red path in the cave.
*This was the first [[Playhouse Disney]]/[[Disney Junior]] special to act as the series' pilot as well as air before the official debut. The second being [[Sofia the First|''Sofia the First'']]'s pilot "[[Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess|Once Upon a Princess]]" and the third being ''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]''<nowiki/>'s pilot "[[Mickey the Brave!]]".
*The notes do not pulse or highlight the construction paper's color to the Beethoven song. Instead, after Quincy says "and....", Leo immediately says "Music by Ludwig van Beethoven." without waiting for the music to stop playing and they switch places. Quincy's on the left and Leo's on the right.
*This movie uses a 5.1 track.
