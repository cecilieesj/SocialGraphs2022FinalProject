==Reception==
In the December 4, 1927 edition of ''Film Daily'', the film was praised as an "animated 'opera' of comics that speaks volumes for the imagination, sense of humor, and drawing ability of the artist." They went on to praise it more: "There is hardly a single scene that doesn't have some droll twist. In this case, the theme is plainly an inoffensive poke at ripe melodramas, with bank robbing, kidnapping of the fair damsel, and a bomb explosion figuring eloquently in the story."<ref>{{Cite book | title = Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons | author = David A.
