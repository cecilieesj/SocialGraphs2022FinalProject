==Trivia==
*Hosted by [[Professor Owl]] (only before first song)
*This is the first live-action ''Sing-Along Songs'' video and the first to be located at Disneyland. the second is being ''[[Let's Go to Disneyland Paris]]''.
**This is also the first live-action sing-along since "[[Here Comes Santa Claus]] at Disneyland" from ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Very Merry Christmas Songs|Very Merry Christmas Songs]]''.
*Many of the montage scenes in ''Disneyland Fun'' are made of re-edited clips and recycled footage from the original souvenir video ''[[A Day at Disneyland]]''.
*A sequel was released overseas in [[1993]], subtitled ''[[Let's Go to Disneyland Paris]]''.
*In "When You Wish Upon a Star" number, Mickey shoots the sparks from his fingertips. He previously did this at the end of the [[1986]] Walt Disney World 15th anniversary special and in 1990 was [[Sorcery in the Sky]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney MGM Studios]]. He would do this again in [[Fantasmic!]] a couple of years later.
*[[RX-24]], [[R2-D2]], and [[C-3PO]] make a cameo in this video in the "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" segment.
**Because this video was released before Disney acquired [[Lucasfilm]], a copyright notice appears in the lower-left when [[Star Tours]] is seen, but only in the Disneyland Paris version.
*Numerous sequences shot for television appear in this video:
**For example, in the "[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]" segment, longtime Disney Legend [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] is the lead singer like in the actual [[The Haunted Mansion (attraction)|Haunted Mansion]] ride; as one of [[The Phantom Five]], Uncle Theodore.
**In "[[The Character Parade]]" sequence, some clips are from the Disneyland State Fair Parade and the [[1989]] Disneyland Christmas parade while others near the end are from the [[Party Gras Parade]] music video.
*In the "Grim Grinning Ghosts" segment, scenes from the ride are featured during the third verse. They appear as follows:
**The foyer showing the doors to the Stretching Room
**The Endless Hallway with floating candelabra
**[[Madame Leota]] (pre-2005 stationary form)
**The chandelier ghosts in the Ballroom
**The Phantom Five in the graveyard
**The conservatory [[Coffin Occupant|coffin occupant]]
**Dancing Ghosts and organist in the Ballroom
