'''''The Other Side of Heaven''''' is a [[2001]] film produced by Academy Award winner Gerald R. Molen and directed by Mitch Davis and stars Christopher Gorham (as John Groberg) and [[Anne Hathaway]] (as Jean Sabin).

The Other Side of Heaven is about John H. Groberg's experience as a Mormon missionary in the Tongan islands in the [[1950]]s. It is based on the book that he wrote about his experiences, In the Eye of the Storm.

The movie focuses on Groberg's adventurous experiences and trials while serving as a missionary in the South Pacific. While portraying these events, the film discusses little LDS theology, focusing instead on the Mormon missionary experience.
==Plot==

A young man from [[Idaho]] finds himself in a beautiful but dangerous land in the South Pacific as he follows his faith and tries to spread it to others in this adventure-drama, based on a true story. In [[1953]], John Groberg (Christopher Gorham) is a 19-year-old student at [[Brigham Young University]], whose greatest adventure in life had been to leave home to go to school in [[Utah]]. That all changes when Groberg accepts a missionary assignment in the Tonga Islands near Fiji; Groberg is instructed to "build a kingdom" and educate the natives about the faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, even though he knows little of their customs and nothing of their language. Leaving behind his sweetheart, Jean Sabin (Anne Hathaway), Groberg arrives in Tonga and is quickly immersed in the native culture, and strives to teach the Tongans about the teachings of the Latter-Day Saints while trying to respect their cultural traditions and face the joys and struggles of primitive life in the South Pacific alongside them. Groberg makes a valuable ally in Feki (Joe Folau), a Tongan who becomes an avid Latter Day Saint, but he also finds his loyalty to Jean (with whom he's been maintaining a long-distance relationship through cards and letters) tested when a native girl makes her attraction to him quite clear.
