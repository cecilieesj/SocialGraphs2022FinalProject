'''''Self Control''''' is a [[1938]] short animation film, featuring [[Donald Duck]] trying desperately to control one of his trademark traits: his temper.

==Plot==
The cartoon begins with Donald enjoying a leisurely day in his hammock, sipping lemonade and listening to soothing music on his radio. Then Smiling Uncle Smiley, a musical philosopher, comes on the radio to talk about the importance of self-control, which can be mastered if you just "laugh and count to ten".

Donald decides to take Uncle Smiley's advice and keep his temper under control, but soon he is tested. A rascally woodpecker arrives and begins to slowly but surely irritate Donald in various ways. Though he tries hard to keep his temper, Donald, in the end, blows his lid and destroys his radio when Uncle Smiley is heard again.
