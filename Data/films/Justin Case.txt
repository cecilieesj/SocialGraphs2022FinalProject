'''''Justin Case''''' is a [[1988]] television film by Blake Edwards. [[George Carlin]] stars as a private investigator named Justin Case. Justin is found dead in his office by Jennifer Spalding (Molly Hagan) who is an out of work dancer there for an interview for a secretary/receptionist position. Justin comes back as a ghost that only Jennifer can see, and convinces her to help unravel the mystery of his murder.

From an idea by Edwards' daughter, actress Jennifer Edwards, a pilot was made for a proposed TV series, however only the pilot was made and plans for a series were later abandoned. The tv movie was produced by the Blake Edwards Company in association with [[Walt Disney Television]].
