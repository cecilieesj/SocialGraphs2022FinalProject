'''''Once Upon a Halloween''''' is a [[2005]] direct-to-video film made exclusively for DVD by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It featured [[the Evil Queen]] (from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'') and other various [[Disney Villains]]. The film also features clips from various [[Disney Animated Canon|Disney animated films]], as well as shorts and songs including, "[[Sidekicks and Henchmen]]", the song that was sung by [[Pat Carroll]] who provided the voice of [[Ursula]] with lyrics written by Marty Panzer and Dan Grady.

==Plot==
On the night before Halloween, [[the Evil Queen]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' plans to conquer Halloween, and asks her cauldron (Voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) to show her several villains, to find which one of them gets to help her in her plan. She sees villains such as [[Pete|Peg Leg Pete]] (as Tiny Tom from ''[[Officer Duck]]''), [[Ursula]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', [[Captain Hook]] from ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', [[Yzma]] from ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', [[Professor Ratigan]] from ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', [[Alameda Slim]] from ''[[Home on the Range]]'', and [[Judge Claude Frollo]] from ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. The cauldron also explains its origins and the [[Horned King]], both from ''[[The Black Cauldron]]'', being the Queen's cauldron one of the cauldrons that were owned by the [[Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch|Witches of Morva]].

==Trivia==
*All of the orginal bridge sequences were produced in CGI rather than traditional animation. The rest of the scenes, on the other hand, focus on the traditional animated films of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]].
*Although the [[Magic Mirror|Spirit of the Magic Mirror]] appears on the DVD cover, he does not have any appearance in the film. Also [[Cruella De Vil]], unlike the other villains on the cover, who have scenes centered on them, she only appears in small compilation sequences.
*Although the [[Big Bad Wolf]], [[Anastasia Tremaine|Anastasia]] and [[Drizella Tremaine|Drizella]] do not appear at any point during the film, they do appear in the bonus content sections of the DVD. On the other hand, Alameda Slim does not appear, despite being one of the central villains in the film.
*A game in the DVD allows the player to go into the Evil Queen's Castle searching for 3 villains ([[Big Bad Wolf]], [[Jafar]], and [[Maleficent]]), visiting the Magic Mirror room, a unknown area with a useful carpet, some containers and a door (possibly an area unseen in the film), the queen's lab, dungeons, a garden, and a swamp (which is believed to be the haunted forest).
