'''''The Return of the Rocketeer''''' is an upcoming superhero film based on then the comic book character, the Rocketeer created by Dave Stevens, and a reboot of the 1991 film, ''[[The Rocketeer]]''. Written by Ed Ricourt, the film is set to release on [[Disney+]].

==Production==
While developing ''The Rocketeer'', screenwriters Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo, as well as The Rocketeer's creator Dave Stevens, saw the film as the first entry in a trilogy, while Disney hoped the film to start on a franchise in a similar vein to the [[Indiana Jones]] franchise.  Star [[Billy Campbell]] was set to reprise his role as Cliff Secord in two sequels, while [[Jennifer Connelly]] was set to reprise her role as Jenny Blake in one sequel. However, plans for any sequel were halted after the film became a financial disappointment and, according to Stevens, tense relationships between director Joe Johnston and Disney.

On August 3, 2012, it was reported that a remake of The Rocketeer was in development at Disney.<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2012/08/disneys-the-rocketeer-being-reloaded.html Exclusive: Disney’s The Rocketeer Being Reloaded]</ref>
