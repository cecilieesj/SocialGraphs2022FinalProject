==Summary==
Although Thomas Blackhorse does not fully understand the significance of carrying on the Navajo teachings, he does resent tourists who don't appreciate the local way of life. After accepting Josh Townsend, a transplant from Chicago who just moved to the community with his family, into his circle of friends, Thomas is equally hurt and angry when Josh betrays a confidence and reveals the location of a sacred Navajo landmark to vandals. To save his friendship with Thomas and preserve the local customs, Josh challenges the leader of the vandals to a dangerous mountain bike race. Josh and Thomas must work together to defend the Native American legacy.
