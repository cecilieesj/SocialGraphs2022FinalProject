[[File:1962-angels-1.jpg|thumb|250px]]'''''Almost Angels''''' (also known in the UK as "Born to Sing", in Austria and Germany as "Ein Gruss aus Wien" ("A Greeting From Vienna"), and in Japan as (in English) "The Blue Danube") is a [[1962]] Disney film about a group of boys in the Vienna Boys' Choir.
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The film shows the choristers recruitment process, the rehearsals and the life in the institution as well. The story also conveys the value of friendship, honesty and loyalty.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The child actors were actual members of the Vienna Boys Choir who perform several traditional Austrian songs throughout the motion picture. The filming took place in the Augarten Palais, the surroundings of Vienna and some other places of the beautiful Austrian landscape.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In the United States, the film was released as the second half of a double bill. The first feature on the double bill was the 1962 re-release of ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.</p>
==Plot==
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Tony Fiala (played by Vincent Winter) is a working-class boy whose greatest desire is to become a member of Vienna's most famous choir. His father, however, is reluctant about such idea, since he wants his son to follow in his own footsteps as engine driver. Unlike his loving and supportive mother, Tony's father also sees no future for the boy in music. Despite the objections, Tony manages to join the Vienna Boys' Choir. Once there, he meets Peter (played by [[Sean Scully]]), who is the leading boy in the choir and the first and most experienced solo voice, so when Peter finds out that Tony has a wonderful clear treble voice, he immediately feels threatened by the talented new boy. Peter's jealousy will prompt him to do everything in his power to ruin his rival's public performances and good image as a boarder to the point of endangering Tony's life. The sabotage will eventually end but the break in Peter's voice will change the events drastically.</p>
