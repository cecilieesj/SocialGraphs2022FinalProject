'''''Pluto's Sweater''''' is a [[1949]] animated short starring [[Pluto]], [[Minnie Mouse]], and [[Figaro|Figaro the kitten]].

==Synopsis==
Minnie knits an ugly pink sweater for Pluto, much to his disgust. He is then teased by Figaro at home, and then tries to escape his fate even by hiding under the couch ''with the sweater on''! Minnie notices this, and tells the dog that he isn't going anywhere with the sweater except ''outside'', as she forcefully carries him out the door. He tries to get back ''in'', but with each attempt, she throws him back ''out''.

Even the neighborhood dogs tease him when he is outdoors. No matter how many times he attempts to rid of it, it stays on. He decides to accept his fate and wear it despite being the butt of jokes. When he falls in the water, it shrinks. He returns home, albeit now wearing it like a mask, frightening Minnie who was reading a horror novel called ''The Hooded Monster.'' She is shocked, but then sees that it has been water-shrunk and breaks down crying. Then Pluto notices that it's the right size to fit Figaro and points this out to Minnie. ''He'' is then made to wear it, and he angrily snarls that he is consigned to the same thing he reveled in teasing Pluto about, thus the moral being "he who laughs last laughs best".
