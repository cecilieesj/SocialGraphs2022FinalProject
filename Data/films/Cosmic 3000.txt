{{Quote|It looks like it’s going to be 2014-2015, depending upon how things go. So far, so good. We've got a writer, we're busy doing development artwork, we're excited. John [Lasseter]’s excited. I've been going on research trips, actually been using a lot of Pixar guys, like Jay Ward. . . . It’s great. It’s what you love and you want to be the best at it.|Dean Wellins, 2011}}
