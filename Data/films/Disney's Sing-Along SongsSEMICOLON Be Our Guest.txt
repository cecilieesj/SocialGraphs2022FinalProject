==Trivia==
*"Little Wooden Head" was cut from the [[1993]] and [[1994]] prints and the Laserdisc print, plus all international releases (Pinocchio was featured on the back cover initially, but later prints replaced him with Pooh), but returns in ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Colors of the Wind|Colors of the Wind]]'' and ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Collection of All-Time Favorites: The Early Years|The Early Years]]''.
**However, it made a surprise appearance on the 1994 reprint, but still uses the 1993 tape master, due to the 1994 reprint becoming rare and hard to look.
**The 1994 reprint is known to be very rare and hard to find in stores.
**The 1994 tape master can be impossible and rare to find, since most 1994 reprint copies of this tape didn't use the 1994 tape master.
**Its removal was the result of an injunction against the title obtained by Bourne Co. over the song's lyrics appearing onscreen.
**The insturmental of the last few bars of [[Little Wooden Head]] when [[Jiminy Cricket]] introduces [[Bella Notte]] was muted on foreign releases.
**None of the international or foreign copies have [[Little Wooden Head]], since it was already cutted in Version 2, It's bars can never be heard on other releases.
*One of the unknown YouTube users has uploaded the 1994 master on YouTube, and featured the 1994 new logo on the opening and closing, but their channel was terminated.
*This is the last volume that two-line lyrics are used during some segments, a method that was used in certain songs since ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah|Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]]''.
*In "The World's Greatest Criminal Mind", an entire segment where Bartholomew gets punished for calling Professor Ratigan a rat is removed (likely as much because it was originally a very long segment where there was hardly any singing as because of its darker tone than the rest of the song), as is a portion earlier on mentioning the drowning of widows and orphans and praising Ratigan for it and another portion featuring a harp solo from Ratigan.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|La Bella y el Bestia: Nuestro Huesped]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain and the United States. Known as ''Que Festin'' in Spain.
*Jiminy Cricket's segments use stock footage from ''[[You and the Living Machine]]'', ''[[You, the Human Animal]]'', ''[[I'm No Fool Having Fun]]'' (exclusive to the original banned version), ''[[You and Your Ears]]'', ''[[This is Your Life, Donald Duck (Walt Disney Presents episode)|This is Your Life, Donald Duck]]'', ''[[You and Your Senses of Smell and Taste]]'', ''[[You and Your Sense of Touch]]'', and ''[[You and Your Five Senses]]''.
*A new promo for this series featuring [[Professor Ludwig Von Drake]] premiered at the end of this video. The footage with Von Drake at the piano at the start of the promo uses stock footage from ''[[Inside Outer Space]]''. This promo would be used through 1995 and go through three different variations, including the initial version.
*The Spanish version shows the Mexico title on the opening but the Spain title on the closing.
