==Trivia==
*The first new volume to feature a new opening sequence, with the theme song sung by [[Sebastian]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.
*Hosted by [[Rutt and Tuke]].
*Also features Karaoke Mode and three Vocabulary Activities.
*"Following the Leader" was presented on ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah|Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]]'', the UK release of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life|''Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life'']]'' and [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Collection of All-Time Favorites: The Magic Years|''The Magic Years'']]. However, the first part isn't sung twice as all the lyrics are shown in a new lettering in this volume.
*The "On the Open Road" segment is reused from the non-US release of [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Topsy Turvy|''Topsy Turvy'']] and the US-exclusive ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Honor to Us All|Honor to Us All]]'' and features a [[Wilhelm scream]].
* On the captions of the VHS release, "Koda" is misspelled as "Coda".
*This sing-along is one of few to have an actual storyline (in this case, it's Rutt and Tuke trying to get to the Salmon Run). For the introductions, new animation was used to show Rutt and Tuke following clues to get to the Salmon Run. However, in the new animation, Rutt and Tuke's faces are only shown from behind. Animation from the actual film is used in the very beginning and end of the sing-along volume.
*"On My Way" and "Welcome" are the only songs in Disney's Sing-Along Songs videos to appear in a widescreen format. However, for the dance along of "On My Way", brownish borders appear at the top and bottom of the screen.
*The song [[Digga Tunnah]] from ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' is to promote the movie.
