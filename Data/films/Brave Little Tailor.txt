'''''Brave Little Tailor''''' is a [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] animated short, based loosely on "''[[wikipedia:The Brave Little Tailor|Das tapfere Schneiderlein]]''" (tale 20 in the [[The Brothers Grimm|Grimm Brothers]]' ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen'') released in 1938. It was ranked #26 in ''The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals'', a book by animation historian Jerry Beck.

==Synopsis==
In a far away kingdom, the people fear of a giant who comes and eats all their food and livestock, everyone asks if there is someone who can slay a giant.  Mickey, the tailor, kills "seven [flies] with one blow." Townspeople, thinking that Mickey is talking about giants, not flies, spread rumors and the King asks to see him, Mickey explains exactly what happened but when he realizes he is being sent out to kill a giant.  The King does offers him money and the hand of the Princess Minnie in return, after being kissed Mickey, who is lovestruck agrees to it. After leaving the kingdom Mickey becomes worried as he doesn't know how to kill a giant.  Things get serious when a real giant shows up, and eats the pumpkins, drinks the water and turns some hay into a cigar.  Mickey is almost eaten and smoked but eventually realizes that his sewing skills proved to be useful in outsmarting and capturing the giant.  With the giant vanquished they decide to use the giant as an operating system for a fairground, where Mickey and Princess Minnie share a kiss.

==Trivia==

*A comic adaptation of the cartoon ran in the ''Mickey Mouse'' Sunday newspaper comic strip from August 28 through November 27, 1938. The comic adaptation had a few changes:
**The comic included a framing device between the beginning and end of the cartoon's story. The opening strips had Mickey receiving a phone call from Walt Disney about the film, and then meeting the director to pick up his script. [[Goofy]] also appears in the framing device, telling Mickey that the studio's giving him a different picture to film, figuring they probably didn't want him stealing Mickey's spotlight. After the cartoon is filmed, Mickey meets up with Goofy (who's in his outfit from ''[[The Whalers]]'') again and invites him over to his house to play badminton.
**The knight who informs the king about Mickey's feat doesn't slip on the floor and break his armor apart in the comic version.
**Mickey's battle with Gustav was shortened to remove Mickey briefly landing in Gustav's stomach and Gustav smoking his "cigarette", instead having Mickey grab Gustav's mustache right when Gustav's tossing the pumpkins in his mouth.
**Mickey shouts "Whoopee!" at the end of the story instead of the king.
* Two of the King's guards seen at the beginning of the short (whom are portrayed by anthropomorphic dogs) bear a striking resemblance to [[Goofy]] (the black-furred one) and [[Pluto]] (the yellow-furred one) respectively.
*Some of Mickey's dialogue from this short would later be reused in other materials. The line "Well, so long! I'll be seeing ya!" was reused in ''[[Fantasia]]'' after Mickey shakes hands with Leopold Stokowski. Mickey's big sneeze and nervous response of "Gesundheit. Heh." was reused in the ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' segment of ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' released years later.
*The sound used for Minnie whispering to the King is the same one that was used for the knight whispering to the King. However, it could be implied that she whispered to the king, "Please, daddy, let me marry him if he kills the giant.", as evidenced in the subtitles on the ''Mickey and the Beanstalk'' DVD from the ''Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films'' series.
*In the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short "[[Mickey's April Fools]]", Mickey imitates this role to prove to a lawyer that he is the real star along with some of his other past roles.
*The version of this cartoon released on [[Disney+]] streaming service for some reason uses a 1990s unrestored re-release print with the Buena Vista reissue opening titles.
