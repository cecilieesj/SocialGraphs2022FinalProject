'''''How to Have an Accident at Work''''' is a [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] short that was released on [[September 2]], [[1959]].

==Plot==
J.J. Fate again shows us how accidents are not his fault, but instead are the result of people's own carelessness. Donald is Mr. Careful at home, but at work, he starts right off by falling down the stairs. He has run-ins with a punch press, flammable paint, a conveyor belt, loose clothing, a monkey wrench and other problems.

==Characters==
* [[Donald Duck]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
* [[Daisy Duck]] (voiced by [[June Foray]])
* [[Donald's son]] (voiced by [[Lucille Bliss]])
* J.J. Fate (voiced by [[Bill Thompson]])

==Releases==
===Television===
*''[[Donald's Quack Attack]]'', episode #62.

===Home video===

==Trivia==
* This marks Daisy's last appearance in a theatrical cartoon until 1983.
* Although four ''How to Have an Accident...'' shorts were planned, ''...at Work'' and ''[[How to Have an Accident in the Home|...in the Home]]'' ended up being the only two produced. ''...at Work'' was developed at around the same time as ''...in the Home'', but was delayed for three years.
* The final theatrical short to use the [[Donald Duck (song)|Donald Duck song]].
* This is the last "Donald Duck" short not only to be hand-inked and colored but also the last theatrical animated Disney short to do so.
