==Synopsis==
This is yet another telling of the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn as the two try to clear their friend, Jim of murder charges. This is the continuing story of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. In this story their old friend, Jim Watson, a former slave, came across what appears to be the lifeless body of Lyle Newman. When some of the townsfolk come across him, they assume that Jim killed Lyle, which he didn't. So Jim runs off and goes to Huckleberry Finn who is now a reporter and asks for his help, who in turn seeks out Tom Sawyer, who is now a lawyer to defend Jim. So, they return to their hometown of Hannibal for Jim's trial, and they are not warmly greeted, it seems that Lyle was well respected and their old friend Becky Thatcher's husband.
