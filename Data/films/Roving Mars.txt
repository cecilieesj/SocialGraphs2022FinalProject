The film uses few actual photographs from Mars, opting to use computer generated animation based on the photographs and data from the rovers and other Mars probes. The film has been released on Blu-ray disc by distributor Disney.

==Plot==
For centuries human beings have contemplated Earth's nearest planetary neighbor, Mars, dreaming impossible dreams of exploring its surface and divining its mysteries. Now the impossible has become possible. The Mars mission, which sent two intrepid, death-defying explorers--Spirit and Opportunity, the mars rovers--to the Red Planet was documented. Through the eyes of these remarkable robots, viewers can now see Mars in a way that no one ever has. This important expedition accomplished far more than the simple transmission of thousands of Martian images. The rovers actually discovered traces of ice within the rocks of Mars. The discovery marked clear proof that water once ran on the surface--a giant leap forward in answering that most haunting of questions: Is there life on Mars?
