==Synopsis==
Set in [[Portorosso|a beautiful seaside town]] on the [[Italy|Italian]] Riviera (Liguria), Disney and Pixar's original feature film ''Luca'' is a coming-of-age story about [[Luca Paguro|one young boy]] experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta, and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound [[Alberto Scorfano|best friend]], but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: they are sea monsters from another world just below the water's surface.<ref>https://www.pixar.com/upcoming</ref>

==Plot==
Two fishermen, Giacomo and Tommaso, are out at night trying to catch fish when a strange creature suddenly begins swiping things from their boat. Upon seeing it, they recognize it as a sea monster and try to catch it, but it escapes, much to their dismay.

Luca Paguro is a sea monster who farms goatfish for his family in a hidden area of the ocean. Luca, bored with his simple life, takes notice of a clock and a joker card that he found on the ocean floor. His mother, Daniela, is highly protective of him and warns him of being caught by anyone from the surface, while his father, Lorenzo, is slightly inattentive and distracted. On the other hand, his grandmother openly discusses her adventures on the surface in the past and seems supportive of Luca wanting to get out.

The next day, Luca follows a trail of more human objects until he is cornered by what looks like a deep-sea diver. The diver turns out to be another sea monster named Alberto Scorfano, who had been collecting the items to begin with and taking them back to his hideout on the surface. He forces Luca up to show him what it is like and discovers that he transforms into a human when he hits dry land. Scared but amazed, Luca returns to the ocean. He is confronted by Daniela for being gone for a long time, but Grandma protects Luca by claiming that she sent him out to get sea cucumbers.

Luca soon becomes attracted to going back to the surface, and Alberto eggs him to come up. Luca is mystified at having legs to stand on, and Alberto gives him a quick lesson on walking. Next, Alberto takes him to his hideout, a tall abandoned tower, and shows him all the things he has collected, including a poster for a Vespa, an Italian scooter. Alberto explains that it is a vehicle that can take you anywhere; Luca becomes entranced with the idea of owning one and traveling the world and suggests that they take the junk that he has collected to build one. They spend a couple of hours perfecting it before Luca realizes he needs to return home.

The next day, Luca and Alberto try out their scrap scooter by riding down the island's hill. Luca is forced to hold the ramp while Alberto rides it. Unfortunately, the scooter falls apart, but Alberto is more determined to build a better one, and he and Luca spend the next couple of days collecting and rebuilding Vespas. Meanwhile, Daniela and Lorenzo put together that Luca has been swimming off somewhere and become concerned for him. Eventually, Alberto convinces Luca to ride the hill down with him, but he is too scared. Alberto then informs him that he needs to declare "Silenzio, Bruno!" to encourage himself, and they ride down the hill and off the ramp before crashing into the water. However, the experience livens Luca, and later at night, he witnesses stars for the first time, though Alberto informs him that they are glowing fish that fill the sky. Luca has a wonderful dream of riding his Vespa with Alberto and flying into the sky to see the fish, but it ends with it raining and Luca turning back into a sea monster.

Luca awakens to realize he overstayed his welcome and rushes back home. His parents catch him and reveal that they have found the human objects he has accrued. To teach him a lesson, they plan to send him away to live with Uncle Ugo, Lorenzo's brother, in the deepest depths of the ocean and keep him away from the surface. Ugo, an Angler-like sea monster, is off-putting to Luca, and he escapes his house. He meets back up with Alberto and suggests they get an actual Vespa so that they can run away together. They notice the town of Portorosso nearby towards the shore, and Alberto agrees to take him there to see ''Signore Vespa'' and ask for one, despite the abundance of humans there.

Luca and Alberto sneak into town and take in their new surroundings, though it is quickly apparent that they do not know their way around. When a child beckons that they kick a ball back to them, Luca accidentally kicks it at a shiny red Vespa owned by Ercole Visconti, a self-entitled teenager. Ercole rudely insults the two "out-of-towners" and mocks them before trying to shove Luca into the fountain. Luca and Alberto are rescued by a fish delivery girl named Giulia Marcovaldo, who views Ercole as her arch-nemesis. After Ercole is distracted by news of a reward for catching a sea monster, she rides off with them into town and excitedly tells them that as "underdogs," they need to stick together. She explains that she wants to enter the local Portorosso Cup Triathlon to end Ercole's "reign of terror" (she had lost the previous years due to her vomiting during the competition). While Alberto is uninterested in working with her, Luca is intrigued, especially when she mentions that they can win money to potentially buy a cheap Vespa. Luca manages to coerce Alberto into teaming up with Giulia, and she agrees.

Meanwhile, Daniela and Lorenzo, learning that Luca has run away, head to the surface to find him. They immediately run into an issue when they cannot identify where Luca might be, and begin getting all the children wet in an effort to reveal him. The Triathlon segments are swimming, eating, and bike riding. Giulia agrees to do the swimming segment while Alberto does the eating and Luca rides the bike. Giulia helps Luca ride one when it is apparent that he has never ridden before. Afterward, Luca and Alberto claim that they are runaways and simply want to travel the world. Sympathizing with them, Giulia takes them to her home, where they meet her father, Massimo, a giant, one-armed fisherman. Luca and Alberto are frightened of Massimo due to his claim of hunting fish, though his lost arm actually came from birth. While Luca and Alberto hide their fish appearances, the cat Machiavelli catches their true form. Finally, Giulia convinces Massimo to give her the money to enter the competition and allows Luca and Alberto to stay in her treehouse.

In the morning, the kids enter the competition, where they are once again accosted by Ercole and his peons Ciccio and Guido. When Luca gives Giulia words to insult Ercole with, he buckles and encourages them to enter so that he can beat them. Giulia trains to swim while Luca and Alberto watch her. However, Ercole arrives to mess with them and nearly discovers their secret. Luckily, Giulia distracts them enough for them to hide. Alberto is forced to eat various types of pasta to prepare himself. Massimo takes an interest in Alberto and takes him on various fish outings, forming a father-like bond with him. Luca learns to ride the bike better, but he becomes frightened of riding it down upon reaching the top of a hill in town. During this time, Daniela and Lorenzo find Luca, and he becomes paranoid about them catching and bringing him home.

Soon, Luca begins to enjoy hanging out with Giulia, much to Alberto's consternation. As Massimo takes Alberto out for a job, Giulia tells Luca that she only lives with her father during the summer but that for the rest of the year, she goes to live with her mother in Genova and attend school. Upon hearing Luca believing that the stars are fish, she takes him to a telescope, and he sees the stars up close and Saturn, which is Giulia's favorite. Luca begins to read her books and takes an interest in school and learning new things, and Giulia allows Luca to keep her astronomy book. Alberto returns and hears about what Luca learned, which he is unimpressed by. He shows him the Vespa they spotted earlier to remind them of their goal, and tells him that it is difficult for them to fit in as sea monsters. Ercole and his boys attempt to terrorize them, but they manage to outwit them and head back to Giulia's.

After getting to the top of the hill in Portorosso again, Alberto takes control of Luca's bike, and the two of them ride down the hill and crash into the ocean again. Luca chastises Alberto for disrupting their chance at winning and adds that he is thinking of going to school with Giulia. Alberto tells Luca that no one will accept them because of their sea monster origin. When Giulia finds them, Alberto angrily reveals his true self to her. Giulia's screams alert Ercole and his boys, who attempt to capture him. Luca pretends to also be shocked, saddening Alberto, who flees back into the ocean. Massimo, hearing that Alberto is gone, looks for him while Luca tries to convince Giulia to carry on with the Triathlon without him. Giulia tosses water at Luca and learns that he, too, is a sea monster. Scared about what might happen to him, she tells him that he needs to leave, even though she does not want him to.

Luca swims back to the island to find that Alberto had wrecked the place. Upon seeing etches in the wall, he asks him what they are for, to which Alberto informs him that his father had left him long ago and never returned. Since then, he had convinced himself that he does not need anyone and tells him to leave him alone. Luca instead tells Alberto that he has inspired him to embrace life and that he will enter the Triathlon by himself and win them the money to buy the Vespa.

On the day of the Triathlon, Luca shows up separately, in a diving suit, for the first challenge, with Giulia representing herself. They swim out into the ocean and manage to make it back. They then enter the eating section, where Giulia quickly teaches Luca to eat with a fork. Both manage to finish and get on their bikes as Ercole rushes to his. Lorenzo and Daniela try to stop Luca, but he avoids them to finish the race. Finally, he makes it to the top of the hill, but it begins to rain, and he hides under an awning. At that moment, Alberto suddenly arrives with an umbrella to help Luca, but Ercole trips him up, revealing his sea monster form. As everyone proceeds to net him, with Ercole grabbing his harpoon, Luca surmises the courage to ride into the rain and rescues Alberto as they ride down the hill.

Ercole chases after the two of them while Giulia catches up to them. As they near the end of the finish line, Giulia crashes her bike into Ercole as Luca and Alberto stop and rush over to help her up. The townsfolk and Ercole surround Luca and Alberto to kill them, but Massimo stops them. Seeing that they were trying to help Giulia, he tells everyone that the "monsters" are Luca and Alberto and defends them. He further points out that they won the race (their bikes made it across the finish line) and thus finally defeated Ercole. Everyone gives up hunting the monsters and accepts them, and Ciccio and Guido turn on Ercole and toss him (and his wool sweater) into the fountain.

Daniela and Lorenzo reveal themselves and happily reunite with Luca, while two elderly women, whom Luca and Alberto had a brief interaction with, also reveal themselves as sea monsters. Finally, Luca, Alberto, and Giulia win the cup and prize money to purchase the Vespa. Everyone gathers at the Marcovaldo house to celebrate, where Grandma Paguro also joins them (she admits to coming to the surface on the weekends). As Luca and Giulia run off together, Alberto begins to rethink his dream of the Vespa.

Giulia prepares to go to Genova now that the summer is over and gets on the train. Alberto shows up to reveal that he sold the Vespa to get Luca a ticket to go as well. He tells him that he has decided to stay in Portorosso and live with Massimo, and that Lorenzo and Daniela made plans for Luca to attend school with Giulia. While saddened that this means he will be separated from his friend, he thanks him and gets on the train just as it rains, once again revealing their true forms. Luca looks out at the ocean and sees the clouds clearing up over the island where he met Alberto, knowing that he will always remember their time together no matter where he is.

During the credits, Luca meets Giulia's mother, an artist who accepts his fish origin. He attends school with her and shows off to the class, much to their astonishment. Alberto has accepted Massimo as a father figure and has quickly befriended the other kids in town while working numerous jobs. Lorenzo, Daniela, and Grandma Paguro have accepted Massimo and Alberto into their family, and vice versa, and are accepted as neighbors in Portorosso. Luca and Giulia use a phone to stay connected to the people in Portorosso.

In a post-credits scene, Uncle Ugo is down in the deep talking to a goatfish about how much he will like it down there with him, apparently unaware that he is not talking to Luca.

{{Main|Luca (soundtrack)}}

The soundtrack includes songs by Mina, Edoardo Bennato, Gianni Morandi, Rita Pavone and Quartetto Cetra in addition to operas by Giacomo Puccini and Gioachino Rossini.

Casarosa stated that the movie is a celebration of friendship, and "a love letter to the summers of our youth - those formative years when you're finding yourself",<ref name="News">{{Cite web|url=https://news.disney.com/luca-first-look|author=Camille Jefferson|title=Exploring Friendship, Acceptance, and Overcoming Fear in Pixar's Luca|website=news.disney.com|date=28 April 2021|access-date=May 14, 2021|archive-date=June 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210611145305/https://news.disney.com/luca-first-look|url-status=live}}</ref> inspired by his childhood in Genoa, with Luca based on himself and Alberto on his best friend of the same name, Alberto Surace.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Perri Nemiroff|date=25 February 2021|title=What Do Pixar Sea Monsters Look Like?

Alberto pushed me out of my comfort zone, and pushed me off many cliffs, metaphorically and not. I probably would not be here if I didn't learn to chase my dreams from him. It's these types of deep friendships that I wanted to talk about in ''Luca'', and that is what's at the heart of this film."<ref name="News"/>

The sea monsters, based on old Italian myths and regional folklore, were defined by Casarosa as a "metaphor for feeling different",<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bill Desowitz|date=25 February 2021|title='Luca' First Trailer: Pixar's Italian Coming-of-Age Sea Monster Feature Is Quirky and Inclusionary|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2021/02/luca-trailer-pixar-feature-animation-1234619174/|website=IndieWire|access-date=March 16, 2021|archive-date=February 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226145831/https://www.indiewire.com/2021/02/luca-trailer-pixar-feature-animation-1234619174/|url-status=live}}</ref> explaining: "We were also a bit of 'outsiders', so it felt right to use sea monsters to express the idea that we felt a little different and not cool as kids".<ref name="News"/> Producer Andrea Warren expanded: "We always liked the idea that the metaphor of being a sea monster can apply to so many different things. There is a theme of openness, showing oneself and self-acceptance, as well as community acceptance. Confronting the idea that there's more to sea monsters than they realized. You know that they've only seen it through one perspective, one lens, and so I think that that's a wonderful theme in the film, which is that those ideas weren't right and that there's more to learn."<ref name="News"/> Casarosa agreed: "We hope that 'sea monster' could be a metaphor for all [manners] of feeling different — like being a teen or even pre-teen — any moment where you feel odd. It felt like a wonderful way to talk about that and having to accept ourselves first, whatever way we feel different."<ref name="News"/>

Some have seen Luca and Alberto hiding their true sea monster identities as an allegory for people who are members of the LGBTQ+ community, feeling as though they need to hide their true selves in order to be accepted.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Abi Travis|date=25 February 2021|title=Wait a Sec — Are the Main Characters in Pixar's 'Luca' Gay?|url=https://www.distractify.com/p/is-luca-gay-pixar|website=Distractify|access-date=April 4, 2021|archive-date=June 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620000100/https://www.distractify.com/p/is-luca-gay-pixar|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarities and parallels to director Luca Guadagnino's film ''Call Me by Your Name'', which centers on a romantic relationship between a grown man and teenage boy in Italy, were also pointed out.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Josh Kurp|date=30 July 2020|title=Pixar's New Movie Is Inspiring Peach Jokes And Comparisons To 'Call Me By Your Name'|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/luca-call-me-by-your-name-pixar-disney/|website=Uproxx|access-date=April 4, 2021|archive-date=May 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517112445/https://uproxx.com/movies/luca-call-me-by-your-name-pixar-disney/|url-status=live}}</ref> These prompted the question whether Luca and Alberto are gay;<ref>{{Cite web|last=Abi Travis|date=25 February 2021|title=Wait a Sec — Are the Main Characters in Pixar's 'Luca' Gay?|url=https://www.distractify.com/p/is-luca-gay-pixar|website=Distractify|access-date=April 4, 2021|archive-date=June 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620000100/https://www.distractify.com/p/is-luca-gay-pixar|url-status=live}}</ref> however, Casarosa said that the characters were just friends and that the parallels to Guadagnino's film were only a coincidence, stating: "I love Luca's movies and he's such a talent, but it truly goes without saying that we really willfully went for a pre-pubescent story ...

Casarosa has stated that some people have interpreted the story as being a metaphor for refugees and immigrants as well, however just like those who have made comparisons to the LGBTQ+ community, he admitted that this was unintentional, but that he was welcome to all interpretations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/leisure/article/3138255/luca-pixars-first-gay-movie-how-disney-films-deeper-story|title=Is Luca Pixar’s first gay movie?

He added that he intended for the film's message to be about "being different" and felt that he had achieved doing so by getting such a broad response, "some people seem to get mad that I'm not saying yes or no, but I feel like, well, this is a movie about being open to any difference."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/luca-enrico-casarosa-is-luca-gay/|title=‘Luca’ Director Enrico Casarosa on the Film’s Underlying LGBTQ+ Themes|website=The Wrap|last=Taylor|first=Drew|date=January 5, 2022|access-date=January 28, 2022}}</ref>

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 260 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Slight but suffused with infectious joy, the beguiling ''Luca'' proves Pixar can play it safe while still charming audiences of all ages."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Luca (2021)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/luca_2021|access-date=June 19, 2021}}</ref> According to Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 52 critics, the film received "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/luca|title=Luca Reviews|access-date=June 20, 2021}}</ref>

Alonso Duralde of the ''TheWrap'' wrote: "''Luca'' is sweet and affecting, capturing the bond that strangers can build over a summer, and how that friendship can endure.

The character designs are appealing both in the marine world and on land, and the richness of the settings in both realms is a constant source of pleasure. The play of light on the gloriously blue water's surface is almost photorealistic at times, while a sunset spreading its orange glow over rocks on the shoreline makes you yearn to be there."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/luca-1234967309/|title=Pixar's 'Luca': Film Review|date=June 16, 2021|first=David|last=Rooney|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=June 16, 2021|archive-date=June 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616174755/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/luca-1234967309/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Charlie Ridgely from ComicBook.com praised the film for its uniqueness, feeling that it highly deviated from Pixar's usual narrative formula and clichés, but it didn't make it "lesser" than other of the company's classics like ''Toy Story'' and ''[[Up]]'', highlighting the animation, the design of the Italian Riviera, the score and the story.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ridgely|first=Charlie|date=June 16, 2021|title=Luca Review: This Soulful Summer Spectacle Is an Instant Pixar Classic|work=ComicBook.com|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/luca-pixar-disney-movie-review/|url-status=live|access-date=June 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616160705/https://comicbook.com/movies/news/luca-pixar-disney-movie-review/|archive-date=June 16, 2021}}</ref>

However, Philip Desemlyn, writing for Time Out, branded the film a "letdown", writing "Charming but slight, ''Luca'' definitely isn't Pixar firing on all cylinders. The studio's trademark daring, pin sharp sight gags, and big ideas are missing from a fishy coming-of-age yarn that's a little damp around the edges."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mamma Mia!

*The name of Portorosso is the union of that of the Italian villages Portovenere and Monterosso. It could also be a reference to [[Studio Ghibli]]'s ''[[Porco Rosso (film)|Porco Rosso]]'', also set in Italy.<ref>https://thedisinsider.com/2020/08/10/luca-main-character-reportedly-pays-homage-to-a-studio-ghibli-classic/</ref>
**According to Enrico Casarosa, he describes the film as an "homage to [[Wikipedia:Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and other classic Italian filmmakers, with a dash of Miyazaki in the mix too."<ref>https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/luca-pixar-mythical-coming-of-age-exclusive-image/</ref>
*In the original version of the film, Luca and Alberto had a third friend named Ciccio, and was originally going to be about them using magical tokens in an attempt to permanently become human, with the climax being Alberto transforming into a giant kraken and Luca defending him and keeping him safe. During an interview with Casarosa, he revealed that Ciccio was converted into one of Ercole's goons so that the film could have more focus on the friendship between Luca and Alberto, and the climax of Alberto turning into a giant kraken was abandoned so that the story can be told on a smaller, simpler scale.<ref>https://screenrant.com/luca-original-ending-sea-monsters-kraken-pixar-movie/</ref>
*The film is meant to be a tribute to Casarosa's childhood; more specifically, the movie is about "friendship in that pre-puberty world." When the film's first trailer was released, viewers compared the film to ''Call Me By Your Name'', a film that centered on a romantic relationship between two men in Italy. This had led many to believe that the characters of Luca and Alberto were intended to be a gay couple, but Casarosa denied this; stating that the film is simply about a platonic friendship between three children, Giulia included.<ref>https://www.polygon.com/22407617/luca-gay-characters-pixar-call-me-by-your-name</ref>
*Multiple locations in Luca are inspired by real Italian sights.
*When asked why he chose "Luca" as the film's title, Casarosa said that he based the film on his friendship with his childhood friend, Alberto Surace, but he couldn't just use in his own name (Enrico), and chose "Luca" because it's simple, and "is pronounced well in America too."<ref>https://www.pixarpost.com/2021/02/pixar-luca-title.html</ref>
**Alberto Surace, who inspired the character of Alberto Scorfano, voices a fisherman in the Italian dub version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamworld.it/spettacolo-tv/luca-personaggi-film-2021-disney-pixar/|title=I personaggi principali del film Disney Pixar “Luca” e le voci italiane|date=17 June 2021|website=TeamWorld|language=Italian}}</ref>
*According to Casarosa in a promotional video on Disney's Japanese Twitter, this film is set in the 1950s/1960s.<ref>https://twitter.com/DisneyAPromos/status/1399514047582818304</ref>
**During the montage of Giulia taking Luca to Old Man Bernardi's home to use his telescope, a woman can be seen watching the Italian film ''[[Wikipedia:Big Deal on Madonna Street|Big Deal on Madonna Street]]'', which was released in 1958. This indicates that the film takes place sometime between 1958 and 1969.
**The epilogue features Luca and Giulia watching the Apollo 11 Moon Landing, suggesting that the film takes place during the summer of either 1968 or 1969.
*Pixar's 13th film to have a June release following ''[[Cars]]'', ''[[Ratatouille]]'', ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Cars 2]]'', ''[[Brave]]'', ''[[Monsters University]]'', ''[[Inside Out]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.
*This is Pixar's fourth film to release on the same day as a previous film with this film releasing on June 18th; 11 years apart from ''Toy Story 3'', the first was ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', which released on November 25th; 17 years apart from ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', the second was ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]'' which released on November 22nd; 22 years apart from ''[[Toy Story]]'', and the third was ''Toy Story 4'' which released on June 21st; 6 years apart from ''Monsters University''.
*''Luca'' is the eleventh Pixar film to be rated PG by the MPA, the first being ''[[The Incredibles]]'', the second being ''[[Up]]'', the third being ''Brave'', the fourth being ''Inside Out'', the fifth being ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', the sixth being ''Finding Dory'', the seventh being ''Coco'', the eighth being ''Incredibles 2'', the ninth being ''[[Onward]]'', and the tenth being ''Soul''.
**''Luca'' is rated PG for "rude humor, language, some thematic elements and brief violence".
*The film celebrates Pixar's 35th anniversary.
*This is the first [[Pixar]] film to be produced in 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio since ''Finding Dory''.
*This is the second Pixar movie not to feature [[John Ratzenberger]] in a voice role after ''Soul'', the movie before it, implying that they most likely retired this gimmick. Casarosa suggested having [[Peter Sohn]] replace him as the voice to appear in every Pixar film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sketchcrawl/status/1406100235219214337|title=He’s not. I wanted to start a new tradition: putting Peter Sohn’s voice in every movie! (Have no idea if anyone will keep to it after us)|website=Twitter|date=June 18, 2021}}</ref>
*This is the third Pixar film to have a music score composed by a non-recurring composer after ''Brave'' (which had its music score composed by [[Patrick Doyle]]) and ''Soul'' (which had its music score composed by Trent Raznor, Atticus Ross, and Jon Batiste).
*The headline on the newspaper that Giulia gives to her father Massimo in the film reads "Mostro Avvistato All'isola", which translates to "Monster Spotted on the Island" in English.
*The phrase that Alberto says, "Piacere, Girolamo Trombetta", is an Italian play-on-words, in which the first name Girolamo sounds a bit like "giro la mano" ("I twist my hand") whereas the surname Trombetta means "trumpet", and while pronouncing the name there's a handshake that involves twisting the hands and pulling back like playing a trumpet. It roughly translates to "Nice to meet you. My name is Twisty Trumpet."
*This is the second Pixar film to feature live-action footage, the first being ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]''.
*This is the second Pixar film that was originally going to be released in theaters, but delayed to [[Disney+]] after ''Soul''.
*This is the third Disney+ original movie to get a home video release, being ''[[Mulan (2020 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Soul]]''.

*Most of this movie was made at home during COVID-19.

==Easter eggs==
*When Luca and Alberto build a Vespa from scratch, instead of the mirror, there is a photo of Italian actor {{WikipediaLink|Marcello Mastroianni}}.
*At one point, Luca and Giulia are seen reading Carlo Collodi's ''The Adventures of Pinocchio''. During an imaginary sequence, versions of [[Pinocchio]], [[Honest John|the Fox]] and [[Gideon (Pinocchio)|the Cat]] can be seen.
*One of the toys in Giulia's room resembles [[Donald Duck]].
*A record cover in Giulia's room has the name "Nicolo Pitera", a reference to Pixar animator Nick Pitera.
*In Portorosso there are some posters advertising the movies ''{{WikipediaLink|La Strada}}'' and ''{{WikipediaLink|Roman Holiday}}''; a poster in the Portorosso plaza is also very similar to a poster for [[1954]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.
*A [[Hidden Mickey]] appears as three round clouds when Luca imagines himself and Alberto riding in a Vespa.
*One of the goatfishes, over 24 to represent the films Pixar made so far, reference Mona Lisa and director Enrico.
*The [[Pizza Planet Truck]] can be spotted during the bike chase between Luca, Alberto, Ercole and Giulia. As there are no four-wheeled vehicles in the film, the Pizza Planet Truck instead appears as a three-wheeled pickup truck.
*[[A113]] appears on Luca's train ticket to Genova as his seat number.
**The number at the front of the train is 94608, which is the zip code for Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, California. Pixar's address (1200 Park Ave.) also appears as the number of the train carriage boarded by Luca (1200PA).
*The [[Pixar Ball|Luxo Ball]] can be seen on a rooftop during the race.
*One of the boats has the name "Elena" written on it, a reference to [[Elena Rivera]] from ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]''.
*The boy from ''[[La Luna]]'' appears during the film's credits.
*When it starts raining in Portorosso, everyone brings out black umbrellas, while Alberto's umbrella is blue, most likely a reference to ''[[The Blue Umbrella]]''.
*The diving helmet worn by Alberto and Luca is similar to the helmet in [[Philip Sherman]]'s tank in ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.
*During the scene where Luca and Alberto first meet Massimo, the music playing is "Largo al factotum", a famous aria from the Rossini opera ''Il barbiere di Siviglia, ossia L'inutile precauzione'' (known in English as ''The Barber of Seville''), a piece notable for having been used in many cartoons featuring opera singers; including being sung by [[Willie the Whale]] in the short ''[[Willie the Operatic Whale|The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met]]'' from ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (where it was called merely "Figaro" after the most famous part of the aria where the lead character sings "Figaro" over and over).
*The Grape Soda cap from ''Up'' appears on a poster in Portorosso.

==Possible sequel or spin-off==
Enrico Casarosa joked during production about a spin-off focusing on Uncle Ugo and his life in the deep. In all seriousness, he suggested that the sequel be the equivalent of ''[[The Parent Trap]]'' and focus on Giulia trying to get her parents back together while Luca "will somehow conquer the world" now that he is not afraid to hide who he is. Emma Berman suggested that the sequel feature Luca being accepted closer to Giulia's family and show how he is treated in school. Jack Dylan Grazer wanted to see Alberto suddenly attend school and take a home economics class after somehow getting married in Portorosso. Jim Gaffigan stated that the sequel could see Lorenzo and Daniela trying to adjust to human life in Portorosso, only to end up in the bustling city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/luca-pixar-sequel-interviews-uncle-ugo-sacha-baron-cohen|title=THE 'LUCA' TEAM OFTEN JOKED ABOUT A TV SPIN-OFF FOR ONE OF THE PIXAR FILM'S MOST BIZARRE CHARACTERS|website=Syfy|last=Weiss|first=Josh|date=June 21, 2021|access-date=June 23, 2021}}</ref>

Sometime after the film's release, Disney+ sent a survey to subscribers asking about their opinion of the movie and asked "how likely would each household member [want] to watch another movie involving the characters and world of ''Luca'' if it became available," implying that the studio intends to produce a sequel at some point.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2021/06/29/exclusive-disney-survey-hints-at-a-potential-luca-sequel/|title=Exclusive: Disney+ Survey Hints at a Potential Luca Sequel|website=The Disinsider|last=Simmons|first=Jordan|date=June 29, 2021|access-date=June 29, 2021}}</ref>

A short film titled ''[[Ciao Alberto]]'' was released on [[November 12]], [[2021]] and serves as a loose sequel that follows the relationship between Alberto and Massimo.
