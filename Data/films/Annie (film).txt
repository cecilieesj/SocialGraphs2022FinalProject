Like both the original Broadway production, which it is based on, and the [[1982]] theatrical film, also based on it, it is based on the cartoon ''Little Orphan Annie'' by Harold Gray. The main idea is that the principal character, [[Annie (character)|Annie]], intends to find her parents who had left her with a note at the orphanage 11 years ago when she was a baby. It was the directing debut of [[Rob Marshall]].

==Synopsis==
In [[1933]], during the Great Depression in [[New York City]], 11-year-old orphan Annie Bennett (Alicia Morton) was left on her own at an all girls orphanage when she was a baby. The only two things that she received from her parents was half a silver heart-shaped locket with a keyhole, and a note saying that they would come back for her. The orphanage is run by the tyrannical [[Agatha Hannigan]] ([[Kathy Bates]]), who starves [[The Orphans (Annie)|the orphans]], forces them to do slave labor, and even makes them suffer. In the middle of the night, after getting tired of waiting for her parents, Annie tries to escape to find them, but is caught by Miss Hannigan in the process. When Miss Hannigan gets distracted, Annie hides in the dirty laundry bin and she finally succeeds in running away. While out on her own, she befriends a dog, whom she names [[Sandy (dog)|Sandy]]. But a policeman catches and returns her to the orphanage. When billionaire [[Oliver Warbucks|Oliver "Daddy" Warbucks]] ([[Victor Garber]]) decides to take in an orphan for Christmas, his secretary, [[Grace Farrell]] ([[Audra McDonald]]), chooses Annie. She and Sandy are brought to his wealthy estate and bathe in a grand life.

Although at first uncomfortable with Annie, Daddy Warbucks is soon charmed by her. He desperately wants to adopt her, but she still wants to find her parents, so he announces a $50,000 reward for anybody who can prove they are her parents on the radio. The orphans accidentally tell Miss Hannigan, her younger con artist brother, [[Rooster Hannigan|Rooster]] ([[Alan Cumming]]), and his dimwitted girlfriend, [[Lily St. Regis]] ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]). They cook up a scheme to get the reward by posing as Ralph and Shirley Mudge (Annie's "so called" parents). Before long, many other couples come to the Warbucks house who claim to be her parents. Unfortunately, everybody was only after the money as there were nothing but sob stories on the questionnaires, and not one person mentioned giving Annie a locket. Warbucks tells Annie the sad news, but she is sure they got lost and will come soon. As for the locket her parents gave her, it is untraceable, as many lockets were purchased when Annie was born. Warbucks tells Annie how much she means to him, and after dancing with him, she tells him she would love to be his daughter if they don't find her parents. The house celebrates Christmas together, but the celebrations don't last long as Miss Hannigan and Rooster come as Annie's fake parents, and thanks to the fake birth certificate and I.D., they fool Warbucks into believing they are Annie's parents. The Mudges let Annie stay at the house one more night and will come back in the morning.

The next day, Lily is left with the orphans after Miss Hannigan and Rooster leave, but she accidentally tells them the secret. They make her tell them what is going on, and she realizes that Rooster could leave her hanging as he has done before in the past. She and the orphans come to Daddy Warbucks' mansion where she demands her part in the cut while the orphans reveal the scheme. While fleeing from the orphans, Miss Hannigan and Rooster are intercepted upon the arrival of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], along with his Secret Service. He reads the papers that identifies Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily. This enrages Miss Hannigan, who soon curses Annie for ruining her minions' chance to bring her back to the orphanage so she can punish her for escaping, only to be carted off to a psychiatric hospital for child abuse, followed by Rooster and Lily who are arrested and taken to jail.

President Roosevelt then presents the evidence that Annie's parents are actually David and Margaret Bennett, and that they had died several years earlier which explains why they never returned for her. Although she is saddened by the fact, she is cheered up when Daddy Warbucks officially adopts her. President Roosevelt ensures a happy ending for all as he promises that each of the orphans will be adopted by a stable and happy family. Daddy Warbucks and Grace become engaged, and Annie lives happily with them and Sandy.
