|language = English}}'''''Roger Rabbit II: The Toon Platoon''''' is the un-produced prequel to the critically acclaimed [[1988]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. It follows [[Roger Rabbit]], learning that he is adopted, going out to search for his birth mother. The script takes place from [[1941]] to [[1943]]. [[Steven Spielberg]] refused to sign on to the film due to its cartoonish depiction of Nazis.

==Script==
The first draft of the script was completed on [[May 22]], [[1989]]. It is unknown if there was a later draft.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://maddogmovies.com/almost/scripts/rogerrabbit2thetoonplatoon_mauldin5-89.pdf|title=Roger Rabbit II script|website=maddogmovies.com|date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>

It has been recently discovered that there is a second draft, dated October 30, 1990.  The title has been revised to ''Roger Rabbit II: Who Discovered Roger Rabbit''. Nat Mauldin, Tony Sheehan, and Jeff Stein are all listed as writers.

==Plot==
The film is set during World War II. [[Roger Rabbit]], a Toon rabbit living with a human family, the Randalls, learns that they are not his real family; his mother had left him on their doorstep as a baby. So he decides to head out into the world to find his birth mother. Along the way, he runs into another human, Richie Davenport, who is heading out to Hollywood to make it big as an actor, since he has a fear of heights that keeps him from joining the Air Force like his father before him. Once in Hollywood, Richie and Roger meet two women, a human named Wendy Rowan and a Toon named [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica Krupnick]], who work as radio performers.

They go on their separate quests, Roger to find his mother and Richie to become an actor, but neither find any luck. When Richie finally does land a part in a movie, Roger, in searching for his mother, accidentally stumbles onto the movie set and disrupts shooting. The director and a studio executive think Roger has what it takes to be a star, but Richie is upset at Roger for ruining his big break. At that moment, however, they learn that Pearl Harbor had been bombed, triggering America's entry into World War II. To make matters worse, Jessica and Wendy learn that their boss at the radio station, Otto Green, is in fact in league with the Nazis, who kidnaps them and takes them to Germany, where he enslaves Jessica as a Tokyo Rose-type propagandist, using Wendy as a bargaining chip.

Eighteen months later, the Allies having gotten a foothold on the European continent, the U.S. government decides to use the indestructibility of Toons (they cannot be harmed by enemy attacks) to their advantage in the war. Unfortunately, however, when the Toons actually do arrive on the battlefield, they are more inclined to entertain as actually attack, and so they are reassigned to a supply base. Meanwhile, Richie had enlisted in the Army in Europe, but his fear of heights threatens his platoon, so he is removed to, much his dismay, the same supply base as the Toons. To add insult to his injury, he is to share his barracks with Roger, whom he had been trying for the last eighteen months to avoid.

==Characters==
===Main characters (human)===
*'''Richard "Richie" Davenport''' - ''(Dick Dunne - Stage Name)'' "Twenty Four, good-looking. Human." Aspiring actor, former pilot in the "Air Force Flight School". He is the main protagonist in this film. It is revealed that he is afraid of heights and he "washed out" of flight school, yet wants to follow in his father's footsteps. His father was a fighter pilot in World War I, who shot down nineteen German fighters. Marrying a nurse stationed in England, Richie was born on base. His father died in battle, went down over France. He came out to Hollywood to pursue a career in the movies, since if he couldn't be a real hero, he could at least play one on the screen. He is this film's equivalent of Eddie Valiant, as he takes little interest in Roger and any other Toons at first, but grows to like them eventually. He gets a role in a movie at Paramount, but Roger ruins it. He eventually joins the armed forces. But when his fear of heights threatens his platoon during a particular dangerous mission, he is sent to the Toon Platoon as punishment and is forced to work with the Toons. In trying to protect the Toons from the taunts of human G.I.s, as well as his own cowardice, he is imprisoned in a stockade, but is broken out by Roger when they go to save Jessica from the Nazis.
*'''Otto Green''' - "The station manager. Mid-fifties, rotund, jolly-looking, with a shock of red, curly hair." He is the main antagonist in this film, as he is revealed to be in league with the Nazis; his actual name is Otto Gruenwald, and his hair is actually a hairpiece. His radio program "Life With Gramps" is full of antiwar sentiments, and he has a hobby of building model planes, which comes to the fore when he uses his hobby to build bombs to kill people. When the war breaks out, he forces Jessica into a life of slavery as a Tokyo Rose-type propagandist. In his youth, he had studied radio guidance technology at Cal Tech and now has applied it to his nefarious deeds to launch a V2 rocket and blow up the Allied leaders at their conference in Malta.
*'''Wendy Rowan''' - "Twenty two and pretty. Actress. Human." Jessica's apartment roommate, she bandages Richie's wounds after he is beat up by members of the Air Force. She is an aspiring actress, like Richie. While she waits to land a role in the movies, Jessica decides to let her perform on the radio, since she is good at screaming. She ends being enslaved as a Nazi propagandist like Jessica.

===Main characters (Toon)===
*'''[[Roger Rabbit]]''' - The lovable cartoon rabbit from the first film. He learns that the Randalls are not his real family, and that his real mother, unable to care for him, left him on the Randalls' doorstop as a baby, which his adopted family tells him on his birthday. He vows to set out into the world to find his mother. The Randalls give him his red overalls and blue-and-yellow-spotted bow tie as a present, telling him he should look his best when he heads out. He carries with him a photo of his mother as he goes. On the way, he literally runs into Richie Davenport, who reluctantly takes him with him to Hollywood. He spends the first act trying to find his mother, but finds Jessica Krupnick instead and becomes smitten. He later joins the Army, after he "starred in a few movies".
*'''[[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica Krupnick]]''' - Radio actress, first on various radio shows for Mutual Broadcasting Studios, such as "Mr. Keene, Tracer of Lost Persons" and "Life With Gramps", and then as an unwilling Tokyo Rose-style propagandist for the Nazis, known as Axis Annie.
