'''''The New Spirit''''' is a ''[[Donald Duck]]'' cartoon. It is a propaganda film made during World War II.

==Synopsis==
Donald is taught the importance of paying his income taxes willingly and promptly. Features the song "Yankee Doodle Spirit" sung by [[Cliff Edwards]].

==Voice Cast==
*[[Cliff Edwards]] - Singer
*[[Clarence Nash]] - [[Donald Duck]]
*Fred Shields - Radio Announcer

==Home video releases==
'''DVD'''
* ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]: On the Front Lines''

==Trivia==
*Initially, when this short was being proposed, it was suggested that the main character be a generic taxpayer. But Walt Disney Productions convinced the Treasury to use Donald instead, due to his growing popularity.
*According to his tax form, Donald lives on "1313 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA", yet another reference to the duck's unlucky nature.
