==Plot==
The movie starts out in Coventry with Queen Miranda in King Aron's study, telling his portrait how much she misses him. When she emerges, she is followed by a shadow. She waves her hand and a wall appears, concealing the door. In the Earth dimension, Camryn makes a mess when she tries to magically put dishes into a dishwasher. Alex is living with them because she is going to Waverly University. Karsh and Ileana show up and announce they are getting married and that Miranda wants to see them. Alex doesn't go because she doesn't want to miss class so Camryn goes where she meets a handsome man named Demitri. She believes him to be a prince, but it turns out that he's not; he's a powerless kitchen servant. At school, Alex meets Marcus, who is Camryn's ex boyfriend. He mistakes her for Camryn until Beth informs him otherwise.

Both Alex and Camryn have been receiving signs that their father is alive in the Shadowlands. Miranda believes that Thantos is becoming powerful again and wants the girls to use a vanquishing spell during an eclipse, when their powers will be at their strongest. If they perform the spell, everything in the Shadowlands will be destroyed, Thantos... and Aron. Alex doesn't want to do it and mistakenly brings back Thantos. He goes off to destroy Aron's Shadow. Camryn and Alex follow, and when Thantos takes Aron back to Coventry, everyone is locked out. Demitri helps them get into the castle. When asked how, he reveals that Miranda gave him his powers back. Together as one, Camryn, Alex, and Miranda bring Aron back and Aron defeats Thantos.

The movie ends with Karsh and Ileana's wedding. Everyone is there. David and Emily, their housekeeper, even Beth and Marcus. Camryn and Demitri share a loving look. Then she waves to Beth while Marcus and Alex wink at each other. Marcus whispers to Beth..."I can't believe you're not more freaked out about this." Beth replies, "What's there to be freaked out about?" She looks around Coventry. "I'm just jealous she's got this much room in the back of her closet."

Karsh and Ileana exchange rings and Aron and Miranda pronounce them husband and wife. They kiss and have the reception. The movie ends with the twins, Iliana, Karsh, Miranda, and Aron, all chanting, "Go Twitches, Go Twitches."
===(Deleted) Extended Ending===
The extended ending starts with Miranda and Aron going for a walk in the castle with Camryn and Alex in tow, but the happy moment is spoiled when Minerva, Miranda's long lost fraternal twin sister appears. Miranda comments that Minerva's disappearance was not her fault, but Minerva doesn't care about that anymore, she is there to meet the twins, she then comments how one of the twins take after her (possibly hinting that she's going to take one of them). Before she leaves she says "It's not going to be easy getting rid of me this time" before burning the flowers and disappearing once more.

It is noted while Aron has the moon necklace and Miranda has both the sun and the moon, Minerva has a sun necklace with a black center (an opposite of Camryn's sun necklace which has a blue center), it is implied that she is the one Minerva is after.

==Production==

===Casting===
All of the cast reprises their roles, except for Jennifer Robertson who plays Illeana. She was eventually replaced by Leslie Selier. Jennifer Robertson was pregnant at the time.

===Filming===
Filming for ''Twitches Too'' began in April 2007 on location in Toronto, Casaloma being one of the filming locations. More special effects were used in this movie than the original, so most scenes were filmed using a green screen. Scenes where certain cast members had to fly were also filmed with a green screen and they wore a harness. When filming, the castle set was elevated nine feet high to give the illusion that cast members were up really high. Green bands were attached to the bottom of the castle set to edit in background elements during post-production that blended in with the world of Coventry.
