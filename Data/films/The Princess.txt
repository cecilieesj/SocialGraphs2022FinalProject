'''''The Princess''''' is an epic action-comedy-drama directed by Le-Van Kiet and stars [[Joey King]] as the titular character. It was released on [[Hulu]] in the US and [[Star (brand)|Star Disney+]] internationally on [[July 1]], [[2022]].

==Synopsis==
When a beautiful, strong-willed princess refuses to wed the cruel sociopath to whom she is betrothed, she is kidnapped and locked in a remote tower of her father's castle. With her scorned, vindictive suitor intent on taking her father's throne, the princess must protect her family and save her kingdom.

==Plot==
The Princess awakens in the tallest tower of the castle in a wedding dress and with her hands chained together. Apparently, she had been drugged the night before. Two mercenaries enter with the intent to take her downstairs and, possibly, harm her. However, the Princess displays a high skill set, first by breaking her thumb to slip out of her chains, and then proceeds to fight and kill the two mercenaries in hand-to-hand combat. A third mercenary enters whom she swiftly kills and steals the keys to so that she can unchain herself.

The Princess examines her surroundings and avoids the mercenaries before peering down below to see what has become of her people. In flashback presented throughout the film, the Princess befriended a woman named Linh. She and her uncle Khai began to train her in martial arts and weapon training. While the Queen was amused by it, the King wishes for her to keep a stately appearance. Following the birth of the Princess' sister Violet, the King had no choice, but to force the Princess to marry someone, as the kingdom expects a male ruler.

The Princess becomes betrothed to Julius who, contrary to the King's beliefs, found his decision to invite outsiders from neighboring kingdoms as weak as he feels that conquering them is the right decision. On the day of the wedding, the Princess cannot go through with marrying Julius and runs away. She later learns that Julius came in the middle of the night with his mercenaries and Moira, his right-hand woman who is equipped with a dangerous whip. In the present, the Princess continues her descent to the lower areas of the castle while occasionally encountering other mercenaries to fight.

Julius hears word of dead mercenaries in the castle and believes a vigilante is behind it. His head mercenary Kurr sends a Heavy Merc to go and check on the Princess. After a very long climb up the tower, he believes that she is still in her room (the Princess set it up to look like she was still there). After the Princess kills a rather well armored knight and kicks him out the window, Julius realizes that the Princess is free and has Moira kill Kurr before sending the Heavy Merc back up the castle after he had come back down. The Princess hastily battles through an army of mercenaries sent up the tower to kill her before she escapes by swinging away out the window.

The Princess ends up encountering Linh who informs her about what had happened the night before and the two make their way into the kitchen where they fight more mercenaries and encounter Moira who easily overpowers them. Linh forces the Princess to escape via a wash sewer while she stays behind to fend off Moira. The Princess ends up in the dungeon where she makes short work of the guards and rescues her family. Unfortunately, they are all immediately caught by Julius and his men. Knowing that the Princess would never marry him, he decides to force Violet into marriage. Linh causes a distraction and steals Violet away while the Princess is tossed out the window into the ocean.

Remembering what Linh had taught her, the Princess manages to escape before reuniting with Linh and Violet. Linh takes them to a hidden armory as she and the Princess prepare for the final battle while Violet offers support. The battle takes place in the courtyard as Violet sneaks into the chapel to free the guests, including Khai. While Violet is caught by Julius, Khai and Linh work together to free the guests while the Princess battles Moira, ending with her managing to hang and snap her neck. However, Linh takes on Julius and is fatally stabbed in her side. The Princess and Julius finally have a one on one fight with each other.

The Princess gets badly beaten and Julius proclaims herself the ruler, but as he is gloating, the Princess manages to swipe his sword and decapitates him. The King, grateful for his daughter's courage, announces that she and Violet are allowed to make their own decisions. The Princess is further relieved to see that Khai managed to save Linh who happily reunites with her friend as the kingdom celebrates. The Heavy Merc, who had been going up and down looking for the Princess and missing her, finally arrives and declares that he found her, unaware of the events that took place.
