==Summary==
[[File:AvsA.png|thumb|250px|Alex with the magic crystals]]
The movie starts with Alex in a mysterious place with magic crystals, where a voice speaks, which finds her guilty for "attempting to destroy the mortal world." Alex begs the crystals to watch what had happened before to prove herself innocent. They go back in time to see that Jerry gets a call from his cousin who lives in Italy, and Alex doesn't want to fly on a cheap plane ride. She decides to use magic to take them to Italy. Her parents tell her using magic for selfish pleasure is unacceptable. Alex decides after a talk with Harper to split herself. Harper is unsure about the decision, but Alex goes through with it. Eventually, Bad Alex escapes and travels to Italy. She finds a wizard named Dominic who gave her a magical charm bracelet to trap Alex's family and friends in. After Max, Theresa, and Jerry are trapped, Alex discovers that Dominic is also evil. Once she finds Bad Alex and Dominic atop the Tower of Pisa, Harper is trapped in a charm. Good Alex decides to find Mason, but Mason is mad because he thinks she has feelings for Dominic. Not long after, Bad Alex appears and deceives Mason into thinking Bad Alex is Good Alex. Mason follows Bad Alex, but Good Alex catches up. Alex is too late. Mason has already been trapped in a charm. Dominic's evil plan is revealed there. He plans to trap all of the mortal world in his charms, so he and Bad Alex can rule a new Wizard World.

As Good Alex is about to undo the spell, she is flashed out by magical crystals back to the place in the Wizard World. She is charged to death for her (but really Bad Alex's) plan to take over the world. She is put into a cell. It is shown thereafter that Mason had by then escaped from a charm. He rescues Good Alex and they return to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Bad Alex flashes out when they appear, and Good Alex decides to chase after her. Mason stays and fights Dominic. Good Alex has finally defeated Evil Alex and returns to the Tower of Pisa, but Bad Alex flashes in. Dominic punches Mason to knock him out. Good Alex resumes a spell to release those from the mortal world from the charms. The screen is transferred to Dominic. He tosses the charm bracelet off the Tower. Good Alex sprints to the side and brings her family and Harper to safety. Then, Mason wakes up and throws Dominic off the top of the Tower. Bad Alex reappears, but Good Alex decides to use a spell that takes away her powers forever, erasing Bad Alex from existence. The movie ends with the whole family, Mason, and Harper in front of the magical crystals. They decide that because of Alex's nobility in taking away her powers, her sentence to death will be lifted. After seeing her acceptance in not taking her powers back, the crystal gives her back her powers. In the epilogue, when the Russo Family goes back they find their place destroyed by Bad Alex and Alex. So Harper and Alex decide to stay in Italy for a while.
