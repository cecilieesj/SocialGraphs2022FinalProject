'''''Slam Dunk Ernest''''' is a [[1995]] comedy film, and the eighth full-length feature film starring [[Jim Varney]] as [[Ernest P. Worrell]]. It was released direct-to-video, and was directed by long-time Ernest collaborator John R. Cherry III. In this movie, Ernest joins his employer's basketball team and later becomes a star with the help of an angel (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). It was third and final "Ernest" movie to be filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The magic shoes concept was later used for the film, ''Like Mike''.

Unlike the first four Ernest films, this one was not produced by Disney through Touchstone Pictures, however was still released under the Touchstone brand and through Buena Vista Home Video.

==Plot==
Ernest ([[Jim Varney]]) takes a job with a cleaning service at the local mall, and he soon seeks to join his co-workers' basketball team, "Clean Sweep", as they compete in the city league tournament. He is reluctantly accepted by the team, but given only a minor role as their cheerleader and mascot. In his despair, he is visited by an angel (played by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), and given a pair of magical shoes, but is warned, "Don't misuse the shoes." As a matter of fact, the shoe store's owner, Zamiel Moloch happens to be a demon in disguise. He would eventually prevent Ernest's sportsmanship with the basketball players by luring Ernest to arrogance.

When an injury to a key player leaves the team desperate for a replacement, Ernest is given an opportunity to play. In the process, he discovers that the supernatural shoes have imbued him with super speed and the ability to fly. Armed with these extraordinary abilities, he leads the team to a series of victories leading ultimately to a showdown with the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. As the city league tournament champions, Clean Sweep earns the right to play an exhibition contest against the Hornets, but suffers turmoil as Ernest's teammates soon grow weary of his ball-hogging antics.

While Ernest is in the zone and the team does nothing but sit around, Ernest decides to let the team do the work and get rid of the shoes, but Ernest is needed again and scores (along with causing some mishaps) the game-winning point and the members of the team get drafted into the NBA.
