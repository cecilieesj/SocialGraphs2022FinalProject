'''''A Goofy Movie''''' is a [[1995]] animated musical adventure comedy-drama film, produced by [[Walt Disney Television Animation]] and released to theaters by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It features the characters from [[The Disney Afternoon]] television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and is explicitly part of the show's canon. It can also be considered a road trip movie.

The film's plot revolves around the father-son relationship between [[Goofy]] and [[Max Goof|Max]] heading for disaster as they struggle to find common ground despite Max's persistence in having his own life and winning the girl of his dreams. As a result, they go on a road trip so both can have a bonding relationship. A direct-to-video sequel, titled ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', was released in [[2000]].

In international theaters, the movie premiered alongside the [[Mickey Mouse]] short ''[[Runaway Brain]]''.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was warmly received by the general public and was fairly successful.

==Plot==
It is the last day of school before the summer break for [[Goofy]]'s teenage son [[Max Goof|Max]], who has a plan to shed his "Goof" label and impress his crush, [[Roxanne]], especially after waking up from a dream-turned-nightmare regarding Max mutating into Goofy, terrifying her away right when she was about to kiss him. Max and his two friends, [[P.J.]] and [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]], hijack the auditorium stage in the middle of [[Principal Mazur]]'s speech, creating a small concert where Max performs while costumed as [[Powerline]], a famous pop superstar. The performance succeeds in making Max a school celebrity, but Mazur puts it to a halt and they are sent to his office to be punished.

While waiting outside Mazur's office, Roxanne talks to Max and they both agree to go together to a party that Roxanne's friend and student body president, [[Stacey]], is holding to watch Powerline's latest concert on pay-per-view. Unknown to Max, Mazur calls Goofy while at work (his job is a department store children's photographer with Pete), but in his enraged and over-reactive state regarding Max's actions in the auditorium to rebuild his public image with the student body, he reports Max's actions as "dressed as a gang member, your son caused the entire student body to break into a riotous frenzy!" Believing Mazur's warning that Max's exhibiting behavior that will lead him to a life of criminality ending in the electric chair, Goofy decides it is time to re-establish his relationship with his son, which has drifted apart over the years.

Goofy decides to take Max on a fishing trip to Lake Destiny in [[Idaho]], on the same route he and his father took years before. Max tries to dissuade Goofy, but is shoved into the family car, a yellow AMC Pacer Wagon, and the holiday begins, but not before Max visits Roxanne at her house to tell her the news. When she disappointingly mentions possibly finding someone else to go with to the party, Max quickly creates a lie claiming he and Goofy are going to the Powerline concert in [[Los Angeles]] and will be on stage with Powerline. Roxanne, though initially dubious, falls for it. Goofy and Max head out on their uneasy road trip, but it is not incredibly fun as Goofy hoped.

The trip starts out on a bad foot, to say the least. While Goofy tries to bond with Max, Max is sullen. Goofy later makes a stop at a run-down theme park called [[Lester's Possum Park]], which Goofy had gone to as a boy. While there, they also watch an out-of-date country folk jamboree of animatronic possums (parodying the [[Country Bear Jamboree]]), which malfunction halfway through the show. Afterward, Max is humiliated by having an opossum leap down his pants and then being dragged into a country dance by Goofy. Max attempts to hitchhike back home, which upsets Goofy, as he thought that he and Max were simply having fun, but Max is enraged to be dragged into what he calls "some stupid rat show." The next day, they unexpectedly run into [[Pete]] and P.J. and are chased by [[Bigfoot]] during a fishing practice session involving Goofy's Perfect Cast technique.

Trapped in their car by Bigfoot, who has the car keys, Max and Goofy spend the night in the car. While Goofy is asleep, Max changes the road map destination from Idaho to Los Angeles. The next morning, Goofy pronounces Max as an official navigator of the trip while they stop at a roadside diner, unaware of the change in direction. The two go places where Max or Goofy likes, and the two rebuild their relationship and have fun. However, while staying at a motel where they meet up with Pete and P.J. again, Goofy is told by Pete that he overheard a conversation between Max and P.J. about how Max changed the map, so he and Goofy are not heading straight to Idaho, but to Los Angeles instead. At first, Goofy thought Pete was lying, but after checking the map and realizing Pete was right, Goofy felt stunned and disillusioned.

Goofy and Max later approach a highway junction where the left goes to Los Angeles, right to Idaho. Hoping that Max will prove faithful in choosing to go to Lake Destiny and not L.A., Goofy gives Max the final say on which way to go at the junction. In a panic, Max picks left to Los Angeles. Knowing that Max did not choose the route to Idaho, shattering whatever faith he had left in Max, Goofy becomes angry, stops the car at a mountain viewpoint, and storms off in anger to think things through. However, he forgets to put the brakes on, which causes the car to go onto the road when Max, in some sort of anger at Goofy's refusal to listen, leans against it after kicking a tire in frustration. As they pursue the car down the road, eventually landing in a river on the car, they get into a heated argument. Max is clued into his dad discovering the switched map, while Goofy explains that Mazur called him, and Max stated he's not a kid anymore and wants his own life. The argument concludes with Goofy saying that he just wanted to be part of Max's life as he grew, and Max explaining why he wanted to go to the Powerline concert in the first place. Finally understanding Max's problems, Goofy then tells Max he'll take him to Los Angeles, but they suddenly find that they're approaching a waterfall. The car twists around in the water as Goofy and Max try to swim against the waterfall current, and Goofy falls off the car, and Max goes toward the waterfall on the car. Goofy finds the fishing rod and gets near Max, jumping on some rocks. Max tries to grab the fishing pole but misses. The car crashes into a rock and turns around, and Max gets involved in a tarp. Goofy uses the Perfect Cast to catch the car just before it falls from the waterfall. As Goofy tries to reel it in, the car's weight pushes him into the waterfall, but he grabs hold of a rock. A scared Max sees to the bottom of the waterfall as Goofy is released from the rock. The car falls, but the tarp turns into a parachute and saves Max's life. Max grabs the fishing rod and saves Goofy. But the handle splits from the rod, and Goofy falls; fortunately, Max saves him using the Perfect Cast. Max and Goofy reconcile, and both believe that this was a crazy vacation.

Goofy and Max arrive in Los Angeles on the night of the concert, but are accidentally separated when Max is distracted staring at Powerline's background dancer's bottoms as they walk past him. Goofy is pushed into the device Powerline used to enter the stage and flies out onto it as Powerline is performing his song "[[I2I]]". As convinced by Max, Goofy does the Perfect Cast technique in a freestyle version as a dance style, and everybody is impressed by it, including Powerline, who then also performs it as well, integrating it into his performance. Max is chased by a security guard up onto the stage's lights, but Max crashes down onto the stage between Goofy and Powerline, much to their surprise. The three break into dance with everyone cheering for them. Roxanne, Stacey, P.J., Pete, [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]], and others watch the concert from various televisions, surprised by their performances. Soon enough, Powerline, the Goofs, and Powerline's backup dancers/singers finish "I2I" to a standing ovation from a roaring, cheering audience in the stadium.

A few days later, Goofy and Max pull up outside Roxanne's house in the car, which was recovered and almost repaired, but is still in pretty bad shape. With Goofy's pep talk, Max reveals to Roxanne he lied to her about mostly everything, but she instantly forgives him, revealing herself she has liked him for a long time, ever since he first laughed the classic "Ahyuck", which he was embarrassed about before. They make a deal to not lie anymore, sealing it with a kiss. Goofy's car blows up due to the damage it sustained at the waterfall, and he flies through the air, crashing through the roof of Roxanne's house, where Max introduces him to her.

==Production and follow-ups==
Kevin Lima, the director of the film, said that as opposed to making Goofy "one-dimensional as he's been in the past," the creators intended to "give an emotional side that would add to the emotional arc of the story" and for "the audience to see his feelings instead of just his antics."

The main characters of this film, specifically [[Goofy]], [[Max Goof|Max]], [[Pete]], and [[P.J.]], are based on their incarnations in the television series, albeit slightly older. In the television series, Max was a middle school student, but in this film, he is portrayed as an older teenager. However, other characters that had been established in ''Goof Troop'' do not appear in this film, such as Pete's wife, Peg, his daughter, Pistol, Waffles, and Chainsaw. Goofy and Pete retain their classic looks from the 1940s cartoons as opposed to the looks that they had in the 1950s cartoons and ''Goof Troop''.

Although based upon a Disney TV series, production on the film was handled by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] instead of Walt Disney Television Animation. Pre-production was done at the main WDFA studio in California. The animation work was done at WDFA's then-new satellite shop (formerly the Brizzi studio) in [[Paris]], [[France]] supervised by Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, as well as at the Walt Disney Animation studio in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] (later [[Disneytoon Studios]]). Additional clean-up animation was done by Phoenix Animation Studios in Canada, and digital ink and paint by the Pixibox studio in France.

A sequel was released in 2000, titled ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. It takes place sometime after this film, involving Max's freshman year in college. Characters that returned for the sequel were Goofy, Max, Pete, P.J., and Bobby, but most notable is that Roxanne does not. However, she did appear in the television series, ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (specifically the episode "[[Max's Embarrassing Date]]"), where she was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] instead of [[Kellie Martin]]. This was [[Pat Buttram]]'s (the voice of the Possum Park Emcee) final film. He died on January 8, 1994 of kidney failure in Los Angeles.

On August 14, 2015, a 20th-anniversary reunion for the film occurred at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]] at Anaheim Convention Center in [[Anaheim]], [[California]].<ref name="Surprisinglyawesome">{{cite web|url=http://www.mouseinfo.com/new/2015/08/surprisingly-awesome-a-goofy-movie-panel-brings-nostalgic-rewind-to-d23expo/|title=Surprisingly awesome A GOOFY MOVIE panel brings nostalgic rewind to #D23EXPO|work=Mouse Info|first=Joey|last=Inigo|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref> Those in attendance included Bill Farmer, Jason Marsden, Jim Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Jenna von Oy, and producer Don Hahn.

==Release==
[[File:A Goofy Movie VHS print ad Nick Mag Sept 1995.jpg|thumb|1995 print ad for the VHS release.]]
{{Main|A Goofy Movie (video)}}
The film was originally intended to be released in theaters on November 18, 1994. However, some production problems in France delayed the film's release to Spring of 1995, while ''[[The Lion King]]'' was reissued to fill in for the film's absence.

The film was first released on VHS on September 6, 1995. It was reissued on VHS and DVD as part of the [[Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection]] on June 20, 2000. The Gold Classic Collection release contained the ''Goof Troop'' episode "[[Calling All Goofs]]" (for some reason, the DVD doesn't feature the show's intro) as a bonus feature on both formats, with the DVD also including the ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]]'' episode "[[The Goofy Success Story]]". To date, this film is one of the only animated Disney films produced in widescreen that only has a pan and scan DVD in the United States (the other being ''[[Doug's 1st Movie]]''). However, the PAL counterparts have non-anamorphic widescreen DVDs (the Region 2 DVD is in 1.78:1, while the Region 4 DVD is in the theatrical ratio of 1.85:1), and the film was available in a letterbox presentation on Laserdisc. When the film aired on [[Toon Disney|Toon Disney HD]], [[Disney Channel|Disney Channel HD]], and [[Disney XD|Disney XD HD]], it was in the standard-definition format instead of the high-definition format.

An ad inside a ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' DVD released in May 2009 revealed that a Goofy Movie 2-Pack, which would include both the film and its sequel, would be released soon. However, the set appears to have been delayed. It is unknown at the moment if the DVD would include the film in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Despite the US release being delayed, the Goofy Movie DVD 2-Pack (known as ''Goofy Movie Collection'') was released in the UK on July 27, 2009, with both fullscreen (1.33:1) and widescreen (1.85:1) viewing options. The movie was released on Blu-ray as a Disney Movie Club exclusive alongside ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' in April 2019,<ref>{{cite web |title=A Goofy Movie Blu-ray |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/A-Goofy-Movie-Blu-ray/80154/ |website=blu-ray.com}}</ref> finally making the widescreen version available in the US.

The film is also released in 1:85:1 widescreen format on [[Disney+]] streaming service.<ref>https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/video/fb5b918e-bd45-4311-b613-d4ae2ddb53d5</ref>

==Reception==
The film was fairly successful and was nominated for "[[Wikipedia:Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]]", "Best Production Design", "Best Storyboarding", "Best Music", and "Best Animation" at the 23rd Annie Awards. On Rotten Tomatoes, it currently holds a 61% rating (6.3 out of 10) based on the reviews of 28 critics, while the audience score is at 70% (3.1 out of 5) and is based on 357,300 voters. On Metacritic, it has a 53 based on 17 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>"[https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-goofy-movie A Goofy Movie Reviews - Metacritic]". ''Metacritic''. A Red Ventures Company. Retrieved September 20, 2022.</ref> On IMDb, it currently has an average rating of 6.9 out of 10.

Ever since it was released, it has gained somewhat of a cult following among millennials.

==Trivia==
===Continuity notes===
*Though this movie presents itself as a self-contained piece, its being a spinoff of ''[[Goof Troop]]'' means that it contains numerous callbacks and references to several episodes of that series:
**Most prominently, Max's embarrassment of Goofy and fear of being compared to him by his peers was also a key aspect of such episodes as "[[Queasy Rider]]", "[[Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp]]", and "[[Educating Goofy]]".
**The movie takes place at the end of a school year, with Max, P.J., and their fellow students excited to begin their summer vacation, which was also the case for both "[[You Camp Take It With You]]" and "[[To Heir is Human]]".
**Also in "You Camp Take it With You", Goofy decides to take Max on an impromptu vacation that involves camping by a lake. Pete and P.J. do the same, even arriving in Pete's RV, and meet up with the Goofs during their camping trip, much to the surprise of both father-son pairs (though, in the episode, only the sons were excited to see each other, while the fathers were less than thrilled; in this movie, both the sons and the fathers are pleasantly surprised to see each other). Their camping trip is even interrupted by the unexpected arrival of a humorous, furry wild animal whose presence causes a ruckus: [[Humphrey the Bear]] (and his son) in the episode, [[Bigfoot]] in the movie (both are even voiced by [[Frank Welker]]!).
**Goofy is shown to have a great fondness for fishing, as was the case in such episodes as "[[Slightly Dinghy]]" and "To Heir is Human".
**Pete's super-luxurious, extra-large RV with all of its fancy components is reminiscent of the custom-made RV he built in "[[O, R-V, I N-V U]]". Said RV, the Petemobile, was similarly outlandish in its accessories of comfort, but haphazardly put together and far more unstable in its construction when compared the sleeker, more elegantly-built RV that Pete has in this movie.
**When teaching Max how to fish, Goofy has a surprise encounter with the legendary [[Bigfoot]], a creature that Goofy had previously met in "[[Winter Blunderland]]. Though, the Bigfoot from that episode was female and had a very different design from the male one seen in this movie. But, both Bigfoots do share the same voice actor: [[Frank Welker]]. And, when Pete sees Bigfoot chasing Goofy and Max, he instantly recognizes Bigfoot and flees the scene, calling back to how he too had met the female Bigfoot and had an unfortunate experience with her in that episode.
**One of the stops Goofy and Max visit during the road trip montage is a monster truck rally. Goofy had previously taken Max to one back in "[[Date with Destiny]]".
**Throughout the movie, Pete treats P.J. as mostly like a servant rather than a son, making him do a lot of menial labor tasks and heavy-lifting, similar to how Pete had previously saddled P.J. with lots of chores and cheap labor back in such episodes as "[[Take Me Out of the Ball Game (Goof Troop)|Take Me Out of the Ball Game]]", "[[All the Goof That's Fit to Print]]", "To Heir is Human", "[[And Baby Makes Three]]", and "Winter Blunderland".
**Max and P.J.'s affinity for Powerline and his rock music has its roots in episodes that featured their love for other rock groups, such as The Rolling Stones ("[[Where There's Smoke, There's Goof]]"), Subliminal Messengers ("[[Maximum Insecurity]]" and "[[Shake, Rattle & Goof]]"), The Ruptured Eardrums (also in "Shake, Rattle & Goof"), Brass Knuckleheads ("And Baby Makes Three"), and an unnamed rock group ("[[As Goof Would Have It]]").
*In [[2020]], [[DuckTales (2017 series)|''DuckTales'' (2017)]] creator Frank Angones stated on Twitter that the events of ''A Goofy Movie'' are to be considered canon to that show's continuity.<ref>[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1246492511113056256 Frank Angones on Twitter, April 4, 2020]: AIN’T NOTHING QUIET ABOUT IT. 👏STAND👏OUT👏Y’ALL👏 #DuckTales #AGoofyMovie</ref> This would mean that the movie's events are canon to more than one universe. To elaborate, the movie's events happen in the [[1992]] ''Goof Troop'' universe (which, according to "[[The Legend of the Chaos God]]" and ''[[Darkwing Duck: The Definitively Dangerous Edition]]'', might also be the same shared universe as the [[1987]] ''[[DuckTales]]'' and [[1991]] ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' series) and a duplicate version of the same events also occur in the separate universe of the [[2017]] ''DuckTales'' series.

===Disney references===
*In his bedroom, Max has a Mickey Mouse Phone.
*During "After Today", the [[Aladdin (1992 soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] for ''[[Aladdin]]'' can be briefly seen in the window of a music store that Max stands outside of.
*During the "Car Journey" Scene when Max and Goofy are on their way to fishing, [[Walt Disney]] is the answer to one of Goofy's car game quizzes.
*Goofy's keychain has the "D" from the Disney logo on it.
*The night light seen in one of the hotel rooms at Neptune Inn resembles [[Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. In addition, earlier in the film Ariel previously appeared as a prop in Max's school auditorium.
*Near the end of "On the Open Road", a woman flies out of a van on balloons. One of the balloons (the yellow one) is a [[hidden Mickey]].
*As the musical number progresses, [[Mickey Mouse]] is seen with [[Donald Duck]] hitch-hiking. Mickey sings a line from the song. Later, during the concert scene, Mickey Mouse can be seen in the crowd cheering.
**In addition to this, Donald Duck is mentioned by Max as Goofy's supposed "best buddy" that he was going to spend the vacation with. This could also possibly be a reference to the ''Donald and Goofy'' cartoons of the late-1930s and 1940s depicting Donald Duck and Goofy as a comedy duo.

===Real-world references===
*During the "On the Open Road" musical number, the hand sticking out of the Limo is an homage to Michael Jackson, making sense since Powerline is fairly similar to Michael Jackson.
*During the hot tub scene at the Neptune Inn Motel, Pete [https://youtu.be/nGJyCLRR9rc?t=111 mentions] the "MTV generation" which was a popular phenomenon at the time of the film's release.

===Censorship===
*Several shots of the film were digitally edited for its 2019 Blu-ray release. This edited version of the film was the version released on Disney+:
**During Max's dream at the beginning, when Roxanne falls into his arms, his head/face is altered to be positioned a few inches away from her body.
**When Max dances with Miss Maples outside Principal Mazur's office, his hands are repositioned (or even erased entirely) in several shots throughout the scene.
**When Max first meets Roxanne's father, the latter's butt crack is erased.
**During the concert scene near the end, when Goofy walks in on Treeny in her dressing room, her underwear is altered to cover most of her legs.

===Other notes===
*Goofy's car is a yellow 1975-1979 AMC Pacer, which has an 8-track player despite the movie taking place in the 1990s; The car also has a manual sunroof.
*The nuns appear to follow Max and/or Goofy everywhere. They are first seen at the photo studio department store, then during the "Open Road" song, at the diner, at the monster truck rally, and finally, at the Powerline concert.
*It took Bill Farmer 18 takes to get the "How many cups of sugar" line right.<ref>[https://twitter.com/GoofyBill/status/1248774865454129153 Bill Farmer on Twitter, April 10, 2020]: How many takes of the “cups of sugar” line did it take to get it right? 18.  #D23GoofyMovie</ref>
*This is one of the few times we see Goofy angry, in this case, he's mad at Max for lying to him about changing route on the map. Also, the face he makes after realizing that became a meme used to express frustration and/or disappointment.
*[[Steve Martin]] was considered to play the role of Goofy.
