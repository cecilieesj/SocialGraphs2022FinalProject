'''''Let's Stick Together''''' is a 1952 animated short starring [[Donald Duck]].

==Synopsis==
An elderly Donald and [[Spike the Bee|Spike]] recall some old times in business together.

==Plot==
Spike, who is an aged bee, is sitting on a rocking chair in the knothole of a tree, smoking a pipe. He sees an elderly man picking up litter and feeling painfully tired, and identifies him as Donald Duck. Spike recalls the day they first met. Spike was looking for a job on the newspaper until Donald picks it off on the ground. Spike then realizes than he could do it too. Spike then kindly has Donald take a break and do all the work for him. Donald is pleased at this and began their partnership. Donald lives in a shanty, where Spike shows another skill, reattaching a button to Donald's shirt. Donald gives Spike some honey, but Spike stings Donald. Apologizing for doing this when Donald has been kind to him, Spike places his stinger into a cork. Donald and Spike go to bed, saying they get to work on their partnership tomorrow.

Their business began at an amusement park where Donald sells balloons for 10 cents. After a bunch of kids have bought one, Donald removes his cap, then snickers "Go get them, Spike!" Spike pops all the balloons, causing the crying children to return to Donald, who replaces their balloons for another 10 cents. However, this does not last long as a barker advertises a "balloon dance", and Spike flies inside the tent, popping the showgirl's balloons and ruining the act.

Donald and Spike then have a more successful business at a Navy base, where sailors get "bee tattoos". Spike sticks his stinger into different cups of dye, then stings the man's chest quickly to create a fast and nice tattoo, as evidenced by one of a blonde bombshell.

Years later, Spike uses his sewing talents to produce a tailoring business for Donald. They now have a big business where Spike mends fabric and clothing and portraits. Exhausted from working, Spike begged Donald for a vacation in the country. Donald happily agreed by giving Spike a greenhouse, or as old Spike narrates "that man was a genius, he brought the country to me!" Spike is happy as he flies around the greenhouse and to his surprise finds a bee girl.

Spike blushes and gets kissed which causes him to ruin the business by designing hearts all over the clothing, undo sewn flower petals, and write "I love a bee girl" and "I love you dearly". As Donald sees this to his shock, he sadly protests "I'm ruined!" He then sees Spike playing the Hawaiian classic "Farewell to Be" to his new girlfriend. Angered by this, Donald intends to kill the bee girl. Spike gets locked out from Donald as he tries to find her. Spike believed "the thing that brought us together was about to come between us" by stinging Donald (from outside above the greenhouse where he broke out from being kissed) ending his partnership with Donald and beginning a new relationship with his girlfriend.

Back from the beginning, Spike says he and his girlfriend (now wife) has been happy all those years ago. Donald, once again a derelict, says he has been looking for Spike. Spike laughs and says those days of work are over, as he has a good life with his supportive "little woman". He then has a pan hurled at him, and his wife snarls that she slaves all day long while all he does is nothing but "hang out with his no-good friends". As Donald is walking away, Spike says for him to hurry up, and the two run off to resume their partnership.

== Trivia ==
*The "balloon dance" may have been a tribute to Sally Rand, a showgirl who was known for covering herself in balloons then doing a burlesque dance. In order to keep the cartoon family-friendly, Spike's sabotage of the showgirl act is shown off screen; only to be evidenced by a screaming lady.
