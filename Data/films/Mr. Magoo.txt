'''''Mr. Magoo''''' is a [[1997]] live-action comedy film that is based on the original [[Wikipedia:Mr._Magoo|eponymous cartoon]]. It was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], and originally released to theaters in 1997. It starred [[Leslie Nielsen]] as the title character. It was produced by Ben Myron and was the first English language film made by Hong Kong director Stanley Tong. It was shot in Foz do Iguaçu, [[Brazil]] and Vancouver, [[Canada]]. Critical and audience reactions to the movie were not favorable.

==Plot==
Mr. Quincy Magoo ([[Leslie Nielsen]]), a wealthy canned vegetable factory owner, goes to the museum to attend a party. While there, his nephew, Waldo (Matt Keeslar), spies a woman named Stacey Sampanahoditra ([[Jennifer Garner]]) whom he develops a crush on. Later that night, jewel thieves Luanne LeSeur (Kelly Lynch) and Bob Morgan (Nick Chinlund) steal the museum's beautiful ruby "The Star of Kuristan" and escape on a boat to Bob's boss, Austin Cloquet ([[Malcolm McDowell]]).

Meanwhile, Mr. Magoo and his dog, Angus go fishing in the same area where the boat with Luanne and Bob is. Luanne picks a fight with Bob and they accidentally lose the ruby which lands in Mr. Magoo's boat; naturally, without him noticing. Bob goes after it but fails by falling onto the paddle wheel of a riverboat.

At the museum, the curator and Stacey send two agents: Gustav Anders of the CIA ([[Ernie Hudson]]) and Chuck Stupak of the FBI ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]) to track down the ruby and spy on Mr. Magoo whom they believe stole it. Stacey mentions she was invited to the opera where the Magoos go that night. Anders and Stupak also visit the opera to look for Mr. Magoo who is in the show. At the opera Mr. Magoo meets Luanne who pretends to be a magazine reporter named Prunella Pagliachi. She wishes Mr. Magoo luck at the opera, who immediately takes a liking to her. Stupak sneaks on the stage and fails to find any clue about Mr. Magoo who accidentally hits him with a big tool.

The next morning, Luanne tricks Mr. Magoo into taking her to his house with an injured ankle. Stupak finds a notebook with Luanne's fingerprints on it and realizes who Mr. Magoo is with. He and Anders go to Mr. Magoo's house where Stupak sneaks in looking for the ruby. Mr. Magoo and Luanne arrive at the house and Stupak hides from them. Bob sneaks into Mr. Magoo's house and finds the ruby. Upon being caught in the act, he steals Mr. Magoo's prized Studebaker with the Magoos and Luanne chasing after him in Mr. Magoo's Eggplant-mobile. Bob loses them and brings the ruby to Austin.

Austin plans an auction for his criminal friends from around the world and shows them the ruby. Mr. Magoo disguises himself as Ortega Peru, a thief from [[Brazil]] who never goes anywhere and joins the auction which is taking place in a communal indoor pool. However he is discovered when the fake tattoo on his chest is washed off by the water. Luanne breaks up the auction, steals the ruby, and escapes from the lair on a snowmobile. The government arrests Austin and his friends while Mr. Magoo gives chase on an ironing board and winds up in the middle of a women's skiing competition. Waldo and Angus sneak out of the lair, catch up with him, and track down the ruby.

Angus sees Luanne in disguise as an old woman and spills her purse which gives Mr. Magoo and Waldo a clue about where she is going. The Magoos follow her to Brazil where Waldo spies on the real Ortega ([[Miguel Ferrer]]) and his friends. Mr. Magoo steals a wedding gown from Ortega's girlfriend, Rosita (Monique Rusu) and is lead to the wedding. Mr. Magoo steals the ruby from Ortega and finds himself being chased by his men, the government agents and Luanne. Mr. Magoo then is trapped on a raft just before it goes over a waterfall but manages to invert it like a parachute so he can gently float to safety. He and Waldo return the ruby to the museum with the government arresting Ortega, Luanne, and the people from Brazil.

Mr. Magoo and Angus go home after returning the ruby to the museum. A series of outtakes are shown during the closing credits.
