{{Nihongo|'''''My Neighbors the Yamadas'''''|ホーホケキョとなりの山田くん|Hōhokekyo Tonari no Yamada-kun}} is a [[1999]] Japanese animated comedy film written and directed by Isao Takahata and produced by [[Studio Ghibli]].<ref name=bcdb>"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/20737-Hohokekyo_Tonari_No_Yamadakun.html Hôhokekyo Tonari No Yamadâkun]". ''www.bcdb.com'', 13 May 2012</ref> The film stars Hayato Isobata, Masako Araki, Naomi Uno, Touru Masuoka, Yuikiji Asaoka, Akiko Yano, and Kosanji Yanagiya. Unlike the other films of Studio Ghibli, the film is presented in a stylized comic strip aesthetic, a departure from the traditional anime style of the studio's other works.

==Plot==
The film is a series of vignettes following the daily lives of the Yamada family: Takashi and Matsuko (the father and mother), Shige (Matsuko's mother), Noboru (aged approximately 13, the son), Nonoko (aged approximately 5, the daughter), and Pochi (the family dog).

Each of the vignettes is preceded by a title, such as "Father as Role Model", "A Family Torn Apart", or "Patriarchal Supremacy Restored". These vignettes cover such issues as losing a child in a department store, the relationships between father and son, or husband and wife, the wisdom of age, getting one's first girlfriend and many more. Each is presented with humour, presenting a very believable picture of family life that crosses cultural boundaries. The relationships between Matsuko, Takashi and Shige are particularly well-observed, with Shige giving advice and proverbs to all the family members, and having a great strength of character which far outweighs Matsuko's. Takashi and Matsuko's relationship is often the focus of the episodes, their rivalries, such as arguing about who has control of the television, their frustrations and their difficulties, but the overriding theme is their love for one another despite their flaws, and their desire to be the best parents possible for their children.<ref>For a much more detailed plot synopsis, covering every episode in detail see: [http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/yamada/synopsis/page1.html plot synopsis].</ref>

==Production==
Based on the yonkoma manga ''Nono-chan ''by Hisaichi Ishii, it is the first completely digital Studio Ghibli film. Takahata wanted ''Yamada-Kun'' to have the art style of watercolour pictures rather than cel pictures. To achieve that, the traditional paint-on-cel techniques were replaced with digital technology, making ''Yamada-Kun'' the first Ghibli film to have animation drawings painted entirely on computers.

==Soundtrack==
[[File:Akiko Yano My Neighbors the Yamadas.jpg|thumb|200px|My Neighbors the Yamadas O.S.T.]] The soundtrack was composed by Akiko Yano and it is characterized by very short piano themes. Classical pieces played by Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra conducted by Mario Klemens. Released by Tokuma on 1 July 1999.

==Release==
Despite decent reviews, the film did not fare as well at the box office in Japan as other Ghibli films.

==Home media==
''My Neighbors the Yamadas'' was released on DVD in America on August 2005, alongside another Takahata film, ''[[Pom Poko]]''. Even though the UK and Japan got Blu-Ray releases of the movie in 2011, the US never saw a Blu-Ray release from Disney. The movie will finally get its North American Blu-ray debut and a re-release of the DVD by GKIDS in 2018.

==Accolades==
''My Neighbors the Yamadas'' received an Excellence Award for animation at the 1999 Japan Media Arts Festival.
