==Trivia==
* [[Tanglefoot]], Mickey's horse from the ''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip, appears on the poster for this short, despite that he does not actually appear in the film itself.
* This is one of six cartoons that plays at the [[Main Street Cinema]] at [[Disneyland]], albeit without sound or color (like a silent movie).
* Donald Duck is the only speaking character who only says "polo" all the time.
* [[wikipedia:Will Rogers|Will Rogers]] was originally going to be one of the celebrities on the polo team, but he tragically died in a plane crash, and was replaced by Charlie Chaplin.
* Most of the celebrities' horses are also caricatures of themselves.
* As surviving animation drafts show, there was going to be an extra audience scene with a caricature of Mae West sitting with [[Hop the Grasshopper]] from ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants]]'' (complete with a snippet of "[[The World Owes Me a Living]]" playing in the background).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091012041710/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1936/drafts/mickeyspoloteam/mickeyspoloteam2.html]</ref>
*The golf ball stuck in Donald is probably still stuck inside him to this day, this might be one of the reasons why he is still angry today.

==Goofs==
*Some scenes of Laurel and Hardy playing polo are interspersed with Laurel struggling to get Hardy on his horse.
