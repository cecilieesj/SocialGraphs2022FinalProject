'''''How to Play Golf''''' is a [[1944]] ''[[Goofy]]'' cartoon directed by [[Jack Kinney]].

==Plot==
An analysis of the game of golf, the Goofy way.

==Characters==
*[[Goofy]] (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]])
*Narrator (voiced by Fred Shields)

==Censorship==
A scene where Goofy mimes shooting himself with his finger and somehow ends up actually shooting a bullet out of it after missing a putt is often edited out in TV showings, including on ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]''.

==Notes==
*When this short was released, ''The Film Daily'' called it "highly hilarious", and gave the following review:

"This, another of Walt Disney's Technicolor cartoons featuring the Goof, is a howl. While the narrator explains how properly to play golf, the Goof attempts to demonstrate. Naturally he does everything wrong, with superb results from a comedy point of view. The technique and animation are noteworthy indeed. Mark this down as a topflight booking of its kind."

== ''Have a Laugh!'' changes ==
The following scenes were cut from the short version due to time constraints:
*The entire first third of the cartoon, with Goofy choosing a club, teeing up the ball, and learning to swing; it opens with Goofy hitting the golf ball to the hole in preparation for the putt.
*Part of Goofy sizing up the elements in preparation for the putt with a bomb sight, while the narrator mentions "drift indication, lay of the land, [and] trajectory angle".
*Goofy licking the tip of his pencil as part of his "mental calculation".
*Goofy pretending to shoot himself with his finger over missing the putt.
*Goofy incorrectly hitting the ball so that it lands in the rough, where he learns to "always play the ball where it lies".
*Goofy's encounter with a lawn sprinkler as he tries to hit the golf ball from off of it.
*The chase with the bull is shortened considerably; it cuts from the run-in with the number 7 flag to Goofy, the stick figure and the bull all arriving at "the 19th hole".
