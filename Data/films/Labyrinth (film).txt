'''''Labyrinth''''' is an upcoming film unrelated to [[Jim Henson]]'s [[1986]] project, which starred [[Jennifer Connelly]] and [[David Bowie]], which shares a few of the same narrative elements.<ref>[http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/disney-acquires-labyrinth-pitch/ Walt Disney Acquires 'Labyrinth' Pitch - Deadline.com]</ref>

On [[April 9]], [[2013]], it was announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] has acquired ''Labyrinth'' through the Lucasfilm acquisition, a pitch by Larry Brenner for an action/adventure story about the journey of the mythical princess who must enter the complex and dangerous Labyrinth to save her father. Brenner was discovered after making the finals of the Final Draft Big Break script contest. That led to him setting up Bethlehem at Universal and Roth Films, with Cedric Nicolas-Troyan attached to direct. The script landed him on the 2011 Black List, and he most recently adapted Angelology for Sony Pictures and Overbrook Entertainment. ''Labyrinth'' will be produced by Jim Whitaker, whose Whitaker Entertainment executives Elizabeth Ingold and Adam Borba helped develop the pitch. Brenner is repped by Resolution, Magnet Management and Stone, Meyer, Genow, Smelkinson & Binder.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=102665 Walt Disney Pictures Plans Labyrinth - ComingSoon.net]</ref>
