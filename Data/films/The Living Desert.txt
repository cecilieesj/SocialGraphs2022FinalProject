It was released on video in 1986 and then 1993.

==Production==
The Living Desert was put into production after Walt Disney was presented with footage of the life-cycle of the tarantula hawk, a desert wasp that attacks tarantulas to lay their eggs inside their bodies. The dramatic footage inspired Disney to produce a full desert wildlife film, with much of the production being shot outside Tucson, [[Arizona]], around Saguaro National Park and what is now Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. Many animals that were featured in the film, but not in the Desert Museum's living collections, were donated by Disney to them after production wrapped.<ref>https://tucson.com/news/blogs/morgue-tales/tales-from-the-morgue-desert-museum-s-first-year-a/article_8b1336de-b7d1-11df-a1d2-001cc4c03286.html</ref>
