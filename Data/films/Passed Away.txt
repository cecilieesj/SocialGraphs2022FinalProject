== Plot ==
A large, dysfunctional family is brought together for a surprise birthday party for patriarch Jack Scanlan and for the funeral that follows, Jack dying from a heart attack during the surprise party.

Everybody's assorted issues are brought to light. There is eldest son Johnny, a tree surgeon who wants more adventure in his life. There is his brother Frank, a labor leader who wants to live up to his father's expectations. There is sister Tracy, a dancer, her gay ex-husband Boyd and the embalmer Peter who is in love with her. There is a literal sister, Nora, a nun based in Latin America.

And there are unfamiliar faces, too, like a woman named Cassie who turns up at the funeral and may or may not have been their late father's mistress. It's a chance for everyone to get acquainted or reacquainted and it's all in the family. 

On the day of Jack Scanlan’s funeral, Frank’s daughter, Rachel, almost passes out due to her about to have a baby and before they prepare to bury Mr. Scanlan, the whole family discovers that Rachel is about to have a baby.
