'''''My Father the Hero''''' is a [[1994]] English language remake of the [[1991]] French film, ''[[Wikipedia:Mon père, ce héros|Mon père, ce héros]]''. The remake was directed by Steve Miner and released by [[Touchstone Pictures]].

==Plot==
André (Gérard Depardieu), a Frenchman divorced from his wife, takes his teenage daughter, Nicole (Katherine Heigl), on vacation with him. She is desperate to appear as a woman and not a girl, so in order to impress a local boy Ben (Dalton James), she makes up more and more ridiculous stories, starting with André being her lover and leading to some bizarre assumptions by the rest of the community.

André is desperate to make Nicole happy (especially as she is increasingly upset by his relationship with girlfriend Isobel) and so plays along with her crazy games, and the stories they make up get increasingly bizarre.
