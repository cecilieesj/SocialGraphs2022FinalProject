'''''Donald's Nephews''''' is a [[1938]] ''[[Donald Duck]]'' animated cartoon which, as the title suggests, marks the animated debut of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].

==Plot==
Donald receives a postcard from his sister,Â [[Della Duck|Dumbella]], which says that her three "angelic" boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing problems, being a constant annoyance to their uncle.

Donald consults a book titled ''Modern Child Training'', and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald spots a page which reads "After all, little children are only angels without wings". This so enrages Donald that he rips the book to pieces and enters an explosive rage.

===Nephews' Antics===
Throughout the cartoon, Huey, Dewey, and Louie play tricks on their Uncle Donald in order to annoy him. They cause extensive damage throughout his house, and have fun at Donald's expense. Some of their activities include:
*Playing croquet on tricycles in Donald's living room, breaking vases, lamps, and windows.
*As Donald plays the piano to try to calm his nephews, the boys pick up instruments to play along with him, however Dewey uses his trombone to launch an apple at Donald, and Huey uses his cello to project his bow at Donald.
*While Donald plays the piano, Huey fills a bag with water, and Louie bursts it with his slingshot.
*Giving Donald a pie full of scorching hot mustard, then, to cool him down, they throw water on him and spray him in the face with a fire extinguisher, then throw his book at him and ride away on their tricycles.

==Trivia==
*This episode marks the first time in animation that Donald's sister, [[Della Duck]] (called "Dumbella" here), is referenced.
*In ''[[Chef Donald]]'' and ''[[Donald's Ostrich]]'', Donald seems utterly appalled at the mere thought of someone roasting a duck. However, in this episode, he shows no hesitation in eating roast chicken.
**Although, this could merely suggest that it's only the cooking and consumption of ducks he objects to, and has no reservations about the cooking and consumption of other birds. 
***If this is true, however, it seems rather monstrous, as Donald Duck's family tree includes other types of birds (such as [[Gladstone Gander]] and [[Gus Goose]]).
