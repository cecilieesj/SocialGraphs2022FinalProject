'''''Tummy Trouble''''' is a [[1989]] short, starring [[Roger Rabbit]] and [[Baby Herman]], that was shown before the feature, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''.

This is the first of three animated Roger Rabbit shorts, produced after the [[1988]] [[Touchstone Pictures]] film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. It was made by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]].

==Plot==
The cartoon begins with [[Baby Herman]] about to cry as his mother is about to leave for an hour. [[Baby Herman's Mother|Mrs. Herman]] then leaves her infant son under the care [[Roger Rabbit]], who gives a stern warning to make sure everything is just fine unlike the last time. Once Mrs. Herman leaves the house, Baby Herman starts breaking into a crying fit, so Roger decided to cheer the baby up with a rattle. Unfortunately for Roger, as soon as Baby Herman starts playing with the rattle Roger gave to him, the baby then swallows the rattle immediately on a whim and is rushed to the hospital for surgery. 

Roger is shocked and sad about this. The rattle comes falling down into Roger's mouth after the baby burps it out after his milk break, and Roger swallows it. When the surgeon comes in to get Baby Herman ready for surgery, he thinks Roger is the patient that swallowed the rattle and much zany madness breaks loose, with Roger trying to avoid himself from getting a surgery due to a huge misunderstanding on the part of the doctors and surgeons. Roger and Herman both go to an out-of-order elevator, and fall down, but Baby Herman uses a diaper as a parachute, and it makes it to the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor (after he swallows the rattle again), but Roger gets crushed. As the elevator gets back up, Roger opens the doors and then a bomb enters. Finally, he caught Baby Herman and declares that from now on, they are "smooth sailing", only to fall upward and back down, during which, Baby Herman burps up the rattle and Roger swallows it again and falls from one hospital floor to another. As he lands on the bottom floor, Baby Herman falls upon him, and he spits out the rattle. After Roger is shocked to see such a large bill, Baby Herman swallows the rattle again.

Finally, during the ending part, which is animated-live-action, Baby Herman spits out the rattle, revealing that he didn't like the rattle-swallowing idea and never wants to do that again. Roger then goes home with his wife, [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica]], to play, not tiddlywinks, canasta or parcheesi, but rather patty-cake.

==Trivia==
*The title card at the start of the film states that this film was made in [[1947]], the year ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was set in.
*Although [[Benny the Cab]] does not appear in this short, an anthropomorphic ambulance vehicle resembling him can be seen briefly, taking Baby Herman to the hospital at high speed.
*When Mrs. Herman warns Roger Rabbit to make sure everything is going to be just fine for Baby Herman unlike the last time, her line "NOT LIKE LAST TIME!!" could possibly be a reference to the previous Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman short "Somethin's Cookin'" as seen at the beginning of the original film, even though that short ended abruptly within the film when the director Raoul J. Raoul yells "CUT!" due to Roger failing to follow the script for the 23rd time in the film.
*[[Mickey Mouse]]’s trademark shoes and shorts can be seen adorning the changing screen in Baby Herman's hospital room. Nearby is a diagram of a mouse’s skull, in Mickey’s design, on the weights there is a moneybag. When the scene cuts back the clothes are gone and the diagram has been replaced with a Rabbit’s Brain, which is represented by a peanut.
*When Baby Herman burps after his milk break, it is revealed that the Baby Herman had previously swallowed an empty can of yams, an old fishing boot and an entire kitchen sink prior to swallowing the rattle.
*When Roger climbs back up the elevator shaft, there's a mouse hole with Mickey Mouse's ears.
*The hospital doors that Roger passes as he is moved through the hospital are: Pathology, Urology, Proctology, Gynecology, Biology, Radiology, Geology, Theology, Archaeology, Zoology, Egyptology, Astrology, Musicology, Physiology, Pharmacology, Phraseology and finally Burbank.
*The items in the pile of explosives read: Gas, Flammable, Toxic, P.U., Ammonia, O2, Diaper Pail and Human Waist.
*Before the atomic hare-splitter slams into Roger, there is some text on the device that reads "Made in Glendale."
*Droopy's one line ("Gruesome, isn't it, folks?") was actually an outtake from ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''. The voice is that of [[Richard Williams]], animation director on that film.
**On that note, Roger's exaggerated wild-take reaction to the Hospital Bill at the end is directly lifted from Butch the Irish Dog's freak-out at the ending of the Droopy cartoon "Droopy's Double Trouble" (1951).
*This is one of the two Roger Rabbit short films to be rated G by the MPAA; the other being ''[[Trail Mix-Up]]''.
*This was the only Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman cartoon that ended successfully (even having an ending card after the iris out).
*This short film marks Disney's only animated project scored by [[James Horner]], who has also scored a few live-action films made by Disney, such as ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' (which the short was attached to), ''[[The Rocketeer]]'', and ''[[Mighty Joe Young]]''.
*This short was filmed at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney MGM Studios]] in [[1988]].
*The short has been featured in comic book format at the end of the graphic novel ''[[Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom]].''
*In the unrestored versions of this short film released on VHS and Laserdisc releases and the original Vista Series DVD of ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', the interior walls used in the Herman family house and the hospital were colored blue <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE5ZInfckWo&ab_channel=drseusslover</ref><ref>https://archive.org/details/5259CS</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34m_wZv48mM&ab_channel=MylifeonJupiter.</ref> The restored version seen on the ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit: 25th Anniversary Collection'' 2013 Blu-Ray/DVD release as well as on [[Disney+]] streaming service shows that the walls in both settings were originally greenish-blue. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIU___FgEK8&ab_channel=ArcadeZero.</ref><ref>https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/video/b8d6ed77-ca77-4119-98ca-1e4f807b6d90?distributionPartner=google</ref>
**On that topic, on the widescreen version of this short film seen on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' Vista Series 2003 DVD release, the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo seen at the opening appears to be cropped at the top and bottom from the 4:3 full-screen version of the logo <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vaZ5btg_ds&ab_channel=JordanRios%3AMoreVHS%26DVDopenings</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE5ZInfckWo&ab_channel=drseusslover</ref>, resulting the highest flag of the logo to get cropped off in the process. In addition, this opening logo is also silent and cut-short.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34m_wZv48mM&ab_channel=MylifeonJupiter.</ref>
**When this short film was released on ''[[The Best of Roger Rabbit]]'' 1996 VHS/Laserdisc release, the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo seen at the opening is replaced by the 1990 Walt Disney Pictures logo.<ref>https://archive.org/details/5259CS</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKWHf2y6Wiw&ab_channel=TheJordanRiosVHSArchive%3AOpenings%26more</ref>
