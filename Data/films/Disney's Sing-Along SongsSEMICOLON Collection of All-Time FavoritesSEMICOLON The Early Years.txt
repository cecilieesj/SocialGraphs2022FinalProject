==Trivia==
*The video is hosted by [[Professor Owl]] (voiceover only, before all the songs).
*Features songs from [[1933]]â€“[[1949]].
*The following songs were updated with newer lyrics: "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah", "Give a Little Whistle", "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh Ho", "When I See an Elephant Fly", "The Three Caballeros", and "Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum".
*Instead of Rat and Mole at the end of "The Merrily Song" from the 1994 edition of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: You Can Fly!|You Can Fly]]'', we see Cyril falling off the horse cart, Mr. Toad falling in the dirt, and two people riding in a motor car. 
*The "Casey Junior" segment is reused from the non-US release of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Colors of the Wind|Colors of the Wind]]'' with updated lyrics, except re-recorded dialogue by Professor Owl during the song takes place of the original, which was later dubbed by Ludwig von Drake on said video.
*"Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf?" and "Everybody's Got a Laughing Place" are reused from ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!|I Love to Laugh]]'', "The Merrily Song" is reused from ''You Can Fly'', and "Little Wooden Head" is reused from ''Colors of the Wind''.
*The pages of Disney's Songbook turn during the beginning and end of each song, except for "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]", although the picture of [[Uncle Remus]] disappears and we hear him talking on the circle before the song starts; while he sings, the page fades away and the page turns after the kids sing the song.
*"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" uses footage from the special ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]'', where Disney characters commence to [[Jiminy Cricket|Jiminy]] singing, which was also used in ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life]]''.
*This volume, along with the other ''Collection of All-Time Favorites'' videos, were released in a set instead of separately in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].
