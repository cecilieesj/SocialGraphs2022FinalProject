The project is described as a modern take on the 1987 comedy, with the producer Gordon Gray attached as a producer and Will Reichel penning the script. <ref name="Screenrant"/>

The fact that the reboot is spotlight as a modern from the original. In the 1980s version, which was based on a French film, a fair amount of humor was derived from the fact that three bachelors had to alter their lives and cluelessly work their way through the difficulties of attending to a newborn. The reboot will likely have to address changing societal views on fatherhood, while also maintaining the spirit of its predecessor.<ref name="Screenrant"/>
