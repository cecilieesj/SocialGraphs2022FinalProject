'''''Those Calloways''''' is a [[1965]] American film adaption of a book by Paul Annixter. Annixter and his wife Jane were writers of books for young readers. The film was produced by [[Walt Disney]] and directed by [[Norman Tokar]]. It was the last credit for veteran film composer Max Steiner. Originally trade-previewed as ''Those Crazy Calloways'', Disney's ''Those Calloways'' is a lengthy, anecdotal film about a highly individualistic New England family.

It starred [[Brian Keith]], Vera Miles, Brandon De Wilde, [[Walter Brennan]], and Linda Evans in the principal roles.

Following the patterned formula for [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] family entertainment, the film follows the trials and tribulations of a Vermont family over a period of time as they attempt to establish a sanctuary for the Canadian geese that stopover in their rural community during their annual migrations.

On-location New England filming contributes to the film's appeal.

Brandon De Wilde had previously worked with Walter Brennan in [[1956]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Good-bye, My Lady (film)|Good-bye, My Lady]]'', and with Brian Keith in the 3-part ''[[The Tenderfoot (TV film)|The Tenderfoot]]'' for ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' in [[1964]].

==Plot==
Patriarch Cam Calloway ([[Brian Keith]]) is regarded as a crank by the local villagers because of his dream to build a bird sanctuary that will protect migratory geese from hunters. Cam uses all his savings to buy a lake, where he intends to establish his sanctuary. When a wealthy sportsman offers to turn the town into a booming resort community in exchange for hunting rights, Cam opposes the plan, which briefly puts him on the outs with everyone else. Only when Cam is accidentally shot by the sportsman do the locals rally around the "crazy" Calloways so that Cam's sanctuary can come to fruition.
