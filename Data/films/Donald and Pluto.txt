'''''Donald and Pluto''''' is a [[1936]] cartoon in which [[Donald Duck]] and [[Pluto]] co-star together. Although released officially under the ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' heading, it is considered the pilot cartoon for the ''Donald Duck'' series.

==Characters==
*[[Donald Duck]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
*[[Pluto]] (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]])

==Plot==
Donald is a plumber fixing pipes in the basement of a house, while Pluto happens to also be there trying to enjoy a juicy bone lunch. Before long, Pluto accidentally swallows one of Donald's tools - a magnet which leads to him attracting several metal objects.

==Trivia==
*This cartoon showcases several modifications in Donald's design, which include a slimmer body, shorter neck, rounder feet, and a shorter bill.
*Although no house owner is ever revealed, it can be assumed that perhaps the pair are at Mickey's home.
*This is also the first short where Pluto appears without Mickey Mouse outside of two ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' as well as the first time since his debut in ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]'' that Donald Duck appears in a cartoon without Mickey Mouse.
*The running gig of Pluto licking Donald at the end is reused in [[Beach Picnic]].
