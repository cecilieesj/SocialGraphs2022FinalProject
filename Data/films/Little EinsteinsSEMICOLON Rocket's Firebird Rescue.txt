==Plot==
This episode starts out with the kids in the Rocket Room. [[Leo (Little Einsteins)|Leo]] introduces himself and says that they are reading their favorite stories. Then Rocket shows his favorite story, "The Firebird". Then Leo narrates the story as the firebird lives in Russia and sprinkles her magic from her feathers with magic wherever she goes. They see that her magic makes the flowers sing as it brings out the music when her magic touches. However, there was one person who didn't like the firebird's magic known as Katschai the music-hating ogre! He had magic power and always wanted to catch the firebird! However, the firebird's magic is way too strong for Katschai.

Like when he tried to catch her with a net, but failed. Then he tried to catch her with a giant mousetrap, but also failed. But he's trying his best trickiest trap to catch the firebird: a pretend butterfly and get captured in a birdcage! When the firebird came down to cheer it, but got caught in the cage! Then Katschai puts the cage on top of his secret palace as he locks the cage with a special rainbow key! The world misses Firebird's music and everything is quiet with her music power to make everything sing and dance. But one part of the firebird was a feather from her as it flew off in the wind. But Rocket wants to help the firebird! Then they heard the music from the feather of the firebird! So they are going to save the firebird! The team runs to Rocket as Leo pulls out his baton. They all run to Rocket and... BLAST OFF!!!

The team flies high in the sky as they're in Russia as they past St. Basil's Cathedral and they landed into the forest, which had lots of different kinds of instruments! As Rocket landed, the team got out and came upon a group of instruments: a flute, a trumpet, a xylophone, and a violin. And they need the firebird's music to help them play loud. Then Rocket sprinkled the firebird's feather magic onto the instruments and they can play loud again. However, they saw Katschai creating some scary animals with his magic as he started with three bats! Quincy told the team that he can play the flute as he used it to make the bats explode! But Katschai made five mosquitoes! Then Quincy played the violin as the mosquitoes explode, one by one!

But Katschai made five spiders! Then Quincy played the xylophone as the spiders explode! Then suddenly, Katschai made a huge scary bear! However, Quincy is going to play the trumpet to make the bear explode as he played as loud as he did and the bear explode to dust! However, Katschai is using his magic to make lots and lots of bats, mosquitoes, spiders, and bears! Then Rocket and the others use the feather's magic as he sprinkled onto Quincy as he uses the instruments super fast as all the animals explode together! Then they see the animals chasing Katschai away! Then they continue the rescue until Rocket heard the firebird's music. Then they ran to Rocket as they blast off and see the feather is pointing to the snowy Siberia. So Rocket headed that way until Annie heard singing and sees a baby nerpa seal in Lake Baikal and the only freshwater seal in the world! But the seal's singing quietly because without the firebird's missing music power! But Rocket uses the feather onto the seal, so he can sing loudly again.

However, they saw Katschai using his magic by creating a snowstorm onto Rocket and get stuck in the snow! Then Annie had an idea that she can sing a special song that will help and the nerpa seal is going to help too! So they sang as the sun rises up and made the snow melt! But makes another snowstorm which became bigger! Then Rocket and the others use the feather's magic onto Annie, so she can sing even louder! So she and the seal sang even louder as the sun starts to melt the mountain of snow off Rocket. As for Katschai, he got himself stuck in a pile of snow! Then they continue the rescue until Rocket heard the firebird's music and see the feather is pointing to the village of Dancing Shapes. So Rocket headed that way until Quincy spotted a circle, a triangle, and a square. They just can't seem to dance without the firebird's magic. But Rocket uses the feather onto the shapes, so they can dance again.

However, they saw Katschai using his magic by creating soldiers to stop them! But June had an idea to stop them by doing a sleeping dance to put them to sleep and the shapes are going to help her. To do this, you must rock side to side, then sauté up and down, then do arabesque! After the dance is done, the soldier fell like a stone, asleep. However, the mean ogre made five of them, that turn into ten soldiers, then fifty, then one hundred! Rocket and the others then use the feather's magic on June as she made the dance go faster to put all the soldiers to sleep, as they go through progressively bigger waves, she had to dance faster. After three waves, all one hundred soldiers fell asleep, and as for Katschai, he also fell asleep, too! So the team and Rocket blast off quietly without waking the soldiers and Katschai. However, Rocket found the firebird and her singing keeps getting quieter. But they have to save her or her magic power will be gone forever! Leo then proceeds to fly Rocket super fast, before the last of the Firebird's voice trails off and Katschai will strike, for the last time!

As they made it to the entrance of Katschai's palace, they got out of Rocket as they went to find the key in Katschai's enchanted garden! Then they see it in a nest next to an egg. However, the egg started to move and out popped a small dragon. Then they noticed that Katschai must have put the dragon there to guard the key! But this dragon is using a baton like Leo's by making loud music to make himself large! Then the team ran and ran to escape the dragon and tried to hide from it, too! But Leo had an idea to make the dragon smaller by using his own baton! Then Rocket and the others used the feather's magic onto Leo to make the dragon to get way smaller and get him back into the egg! Then Rocket grabbed the key and they went off to the tower of the palace and Katschai spotted them as for Rocket, he unfortunately used up all the firebird's feather's music power! Then Katschai casts a spell onto Rocket that made him so that he could never fly to save the firebird!

But Rocket is trying to break the spell! So the Firebird gave Rocket some of her power to help! Then Quincy played his violin to help Rocket go even higher and along came the instruments from the forest came to help, too! Then Annie started singing and the nerpa seal came to help, too! Then June started to dance and the shapes came to help, too! Finally, Leo started to conduct the music. The spell is almost broken! Then, finally, with Rocket's might, and the team's encouragement, the spell finally broke, and he finally freed the firebird! Then she spread the magic everywhere and even sprinkled onto Katschai and made him good. Rocket thanked everyone and the firebird! Mission Completion!
