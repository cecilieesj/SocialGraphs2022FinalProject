'''''Mickey's Mellerdrammer''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon that was released on [[March 18]], [[1933]].

==Summary==
Mickey and the gang stage "Uncle Tom's Cabin," but the crowd receives Horace's villainous performance as Simon Legree too seriously, bombing him off the stage with vegetables. Clarabelle's dramatic performance as a fleeing slave is also ruined, when dogs that are supposed to be chasing her are led astray and through the orchestra pit by a cat.

*[[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Walt Disney]])
*[[Minnie Mouse]] (voiced by [[Marcellite Garner]])
*[[Goofy]] (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]])

==Ethnic stereotyping==
Stereotyped characterizations of black people were then common when [[Walt Disney|Walt]] was alive. ''Mickey's Mellerdrammer'' was one of many films and cartoons of its era that referenced ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', and has been cited as 'particularly notable (though it later received more positive reception as years go by).'<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XxteDL0Ep0gC&pg=PA243&dq=Mickey%27s+Mellerdrammer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uSJdUpWOO4Wc9gSCw4DYCw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Mickey%27s%20Mellerdrammer&f=false Reynolds, David S. ''Mightier than the Sword: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Battle for America'', 243. W. W. Norton & Company]</ref> Henry Louis Gates Jr., wondered how the cartoon evaded censorship of mixed-race relationships, given that Mickey and Minnie portray Tom and Eva, and are "as they say, an item, and unmistakably so." (Additionally, Mickey is seen cross-dressing in the role of Topsy.)<ref>Reynolds, 244</ref>

In the beginning of this short, Clarabelle Cow appears in her dressing room applying lantern soot to her face and leaving an exaggerated area around her lips white. Mickey Mouse then takes a more "comical" approach to applying the makeup: He puts a firecracker in his mouth and lights it, which explodes, causing the ashes to paint his face black while leaving a large area around his lips white.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw06K0dG1Zw|title=Mickey Mouse - Mickey's Mellerdrammer - 1933|first=|last=VolterraChannel|date=August 17, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Mickey's bushy side whiskers and white gloves are also a representation of the use of blackface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/11266/Mickey-Mouse-s-trademark-white-gloves-have-racist-origins|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-12-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214195437/http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/11266/Mickey-Mouse-s-trademark-white-gloves-have-racist-origins|archivedate=December 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Although banned by Disney since its original release, the short has been released as part ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' DVD collection as [[Roy E. Disney]] wanted.

==Trivia==
* This was the last short to have "Minnie's Yoo Hoo" in the ending titles. All subsequent shorts will end with an original fanfare.
