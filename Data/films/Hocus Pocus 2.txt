==Synopsis==
After the events of [[Hocus Pocus|the first film]], three young women accidentally bring back the [[Sanderson Sisters]] to modern day Salem and must figure out how to stop the child-hungry witches from wreaking havoc on the world.

== Plot ==

In 1653 Salem, a young Winifred Sanderson is banished from Salem by Reverend Traske after she defied the authority of the church by refusing to marry John Pritchett. Rather than let her sisters, Mary and Sarah, be taken away from her, Winifred escapes with them to a nearby forbidden forest. There, they make the acquaintance of Mother Witch who gifts Winifred her magic book for her sixteenth birthday but explicitly warns the sisters against casting a spell known as the Magicae Maxima, which makes the user all powerful.  Mother Witch also teaches the sisters to kill other children to keep their youthfulness.

In 2022, twenty-nine years after the Sanderson sisters were resurrected by the Black Flame Candle, Salem teenagers Becca and Izzy prepare to celebrate both Halloween and Becca's sixteenth birthday but turn down a party invitation from their estranged friend Cassie Traske. Becca and Izzy visit a magic shop (formerly the Sanderson cottage) run by Gilbert, who gifts Becca a candle for their annual birthday ritual. Becca and Izzy light the candle and discover that it is another Black Flame Candle. As there is a full moon and the girls are both virgins, the candle resurrects the Sanderson sisters once again.

The girls manage to outwit the sisters in a local Walgreens and then escape to the magic shop where they discover that Gilbert tricked them into reviving the sisters, having seen them on Halloween back in 1993 and been taught how to make the candle by Book. The sisters catch up to the girls and see a campaign flyer belonging to Mayor Traske, Cassie's father and Reverend Traske's direct descendant. Winifred decides they will cast the Magicae Maxima spell to eliminate Traske and take revenge on Salem. The sisters trap Izzy and Becca in the basement and leave to hunt down Traske, whose blood is needed to complete the spell. They force Gilbert to collect the other ingredients.

The girls escape and head to the Traske house to warn the mayor while the sisters find their way to the town's Halloween carnival and enchant the citizens to help them find the mayor. Meanwhile, Gilbert digs up Billy Butcherson, who has been awake but entombed since 1993. Gilbert needs Billy's head for the spell but tricks Billy into helping him collect the other ingredients first.

The girls reunite with Cassie and manage to trap the sisters within a salt circle in Cassie's garage before Mayor Traske returns home. The three teenagers make amends with one another but their reunion is interrupted when the sisters escape the circle and kidnap Cassie to use her blood instead. Becca and Izzy follow them to the forbidden forest where Gilbert has assembled the ingredients and soon discover that Becca is also a witch. The sisters partially cast the spell and increase their power, but Becca distracts them while Izzy rescues Cassie. Becca manages to convince Book that it does not have to answer to Winifred, and Becca and Book flee further into the forest. Book shows them a warning about the Magicae Maxima spell, stating that whoever casts it must give up what they cherish most.

The girls agree to warn Winifred of the price of the spell but are too late: Winifred becomes all powerful as Mary and Sarah fade to dust. Winifred grows despondent and begs the teenagers to use their newfound powers to save her sisters. While they cannot save the two, Becca, Cassie and Izzy join together in a coven and cast a reuniting spell and Winifred happily fades away to be reunited with her sisters.

The girls are joined by Gilbert and Billy while Billy starts to fade away, realizing that all of Winifred's spells have been undone and relieved to finally be headed to his eternal rest. The girls decide to give Book a new home and continue practicing their magic as they walk off into the night in a similar manner as the Sanderson sisters. As they leave, a bird identical to the one that Mother Witch had shapeshifted into flies overhead.

In a post credit scene, Cobweb jumps on a box with another black flame candle, meaning the witchs may return again.

==Trivia==
*This is the second long-time sequel to a Disney live-action classic, after ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' in [[2010]].
*This the first Disney movie to explicitly mention Satan.
*This is [[Tony Hale]]'s second Disney film after [[Toy Story 4|''Toy Story 4'']].
*This is [[Sam Richardson]]'s second Disney film after ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.
*The Sanderson Sisters perform a cover of Blondie's hit single "[[wikipedia:One Way or Another|One Way or Another]]" (1978).
*[[Thackery Binx|Thackery]] and [[Emily Binx]] appear during the flashback from the [[Hocus Pocus|previous film]] as Gilbert tells the story about 29 years ago.
*When Mayor Traske waits in line to get a candy apple. there is a man in front of him wearing a costume of a [[Penguin Waiters|penguin waiter]] from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.
*The costume contest announcer's outfit bears a striking resemblance to [[Dr. Facilier]] from ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. 
*After [[Becca]] receives [[Manual of Witchcraft and Alchemy|Book]], the Sanderson Sisters and [[Billy Butcherson|Billy]] vanish with [[magic]], mimicking [[Olaf]]'s death scene from ''[[Frozen II]]''.
*[[Max Dennison|Max]], [[Dani Dennison|Dani]], and [[Allison (Hocus Pocus)|Allison]] from the previous film appear for a brief moment, albeit all played by body doubles and seen at a distance.
*A deleted scene that was leaked during the recordings shows that the sanderson sisters were going to hypnotize the Salem crowd before they started singing One Way or another, in this we see Winnie and her sisters ordering them to jump from one side to the other and then go around. This is briefly seen in the final edited scene where some in the crowd are seen in the background finishing the turn Winnie ordered them to. This would explain why the contestants obeyed Winnie when she ordered them to leave the stage without complaining, as well as why the band played the music when Winnie ordered them to, as well as why the band members showed a face and movements of being in a sort of of trance.
**They may have used the Ah-say-into-pie Oppa-maybe-uppen-die part of the lyrics to hypnotize the crowd, since the song on the movie's official soundtrack does not mention this part in the lyrics and shows that the lyrics cut was longer, this is reinforced, since there are other leaked scenes where they show the sisters doing movements in their dance on stage not seen in the song scene. In addition, when they say this part of the song, the stage is slightly more illuminated and the blue is lighter, since when Winnie shouts ''Sisters'', the stage behind is less illuminated, which reinforces this theory.
**This would show that this part of the song is the main spell to hypnotize people with a song, as this part of the lyrics is part of the song "[[I Put a Spell on You]]", from the [[Hocus Pocus|original movie]].
