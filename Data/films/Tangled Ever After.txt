==Release==
It premiered in theaters before ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast 3D]]'' on [[January 13]], [[2012]]. It aired on [[Disney Channel]] on [[March 23]], 2012. The short was featured as a bonus feature on the [[Walt Disney Diamond Editions|Cinderella: Diamond Edition]] Blu-ray and DVD set on October 2, 2012. On March 8, 2019, it was re-released in Cineworld cinemas in the UK with the reissue of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as part of the Disney Princess Cineworld series.

==Plot==
The short starts with the film narrated by [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]], similar to the first story, proclaiming dramatically that "This is the day my life ended". [[Rapunzel]] corrects him and he then admits that it was the best day of his life. [[Rapunzel]] and [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] (Flynn Rider) are about to be married. The entire kingdom prepares for what Eugene and Rapunzel state is the biggest wedding the kingdom has ever seen and that everything was perfect and went as planned, except for two things: Eugene's nose, once again, not properly drawn and [[Pascal]] and [[Maximus]] losing their wedding rings.

The next scene shifts to a chapel, with the entire kingdom, including Rapunzel's parents, [[Pub Thugs|the thugs]], and [[the Stabbington Brothers]] (in chains) attending; [[Pascal]] as the "flower girl" and [[Maximus]] as the "best man"; and Eugene awaiting Rapunzel's arrival. Rapunzel enters with her father leading her and wearing a beautiful wedding dress with a long veil representing her previously long hair. As the couple's marriage is officiated by a religious official, Maximus inhales one of Pascal's flowers and sneezes, causing them to lose the wedding rings. Images pop into their head of [[Flynn Rider|Eugene]] and Rapunzel's surprised and horrified faces; [[Queen Arianna|the Queen]] angered that they had lost her grandmother's wedding rings; a soldier proclaiming that the kingdom is lost; and the kingdom in the ensuing chaos that leads to an explosion that destroys everything.

The two then sneak out in pursuit of the rings to prevent their vision from happening. The two rings are separated in two parts of the kingdom and Maximus and Pascal decide to separate to find them before the ceremony ends. Pascal finds a ring in a punch bowl but frightens the villagers who attempt to kill him, resulting in mass destruction of the dining preparations and Pascal's tongue stuck on an ice sculpture of the short thug dressed as Cupid, with the wedding ring on his tongue. Meanwhile, Maximus's pursuit leads to the incidental destruction of several commemorative booths selling dresses, shoes, makeup, and hats and resulting in his appearance being altered to that of a female horse, and being hit on by a male horse. He knocks out the male horse and then finds the ring underneath a flower cart.

After he retrieves the ring, Pascal manages to separate himself from the ice sculpture, only to lose the wedding ring he found and cause a man to trip and land on the table with the ice sculpture. The ice sculpture hurdles into the air and lands on a cart Maximus is sitting on, causing him to hurdle into the air and lose the wedding ring he found as well. Using Rapunzel's and Eugene's wedding carriage, he chases after the ring but is hit by an array of frying pans before hitting the Frying Pan Warehouse sign. A group of servants mistakes it for a gong ringing as a signal to release an enormous cage full of doves. Another servant takes this as a sign to release a bunch of floating lanterns that were supposed to be released in honor of Eugene's and Rapunzel's marriage.

Pascal finds the other wedding ring in one of the numerous sky lanterns that Maximus just released, but unfortunately finds himself hundreds of feet above the ground. Pascal slips and falls to the earth and the ring ends up in the talons of a dove. The wayward carriage hits the sidewalk and sends Maximus hurtling in the air where he lands on Rapunzel's and Eugene's banner. Maximus slips off the banner, tearing it down the middle and defacing poor Eugene's nose even further. Maximus lands on an enormous pyramid of wine barrels busting them all open, unleashing a flood throughout the kingdom streets. As Pascal lands in the street in the path of a torrent of wine, Maximus scoops him up and sprints off to escape from the flood.

Up ahead, startled cook fumbles with some utensils as he runs out of the way, and accidentally sets an entire food cart ablaze, creating a fiery roadblock in their path. Thinking fast, Maximus jumps and grabs an overhanging banner rope and flings himself and Pascal into the air once again and they soar over the fire which is put out by the wine. Maximus hurls Pascal after the ring-toting dove, and although he misses, Pascal retrieves the ring with his tongue. The two fall into a building that makes and stores tar.

They arrive just in time to deliver the rings while shocking everyone by their grotesque appearances as the result of their chases for the rings. Eugene nervously takes the rings and exchanges them with Rapunzel, although neither of them can take their eyes off the haggard duo. Eugene and Rapunzel kiss after finally being pronounced as a married couple, and everyone from the first film cheers. As Maximus and Pascal relax after the tiring chase for the rings, they accidentally bump into the cart carrying the wedding cake, causing it to roll away towards the door. Just as the cake disappears down the hall, Eugene proclaims, "So, who wants a piece of cake?"

==Trivia==
*In the original ''[[Tangled]]'' film, [[Maximus]] is depicted with brown eyes, but in the movie poster for ''Tangled Ever After'', he is depicted with blue eyes. This is an error on the animators' part but was fixed in time for the film as seen in the preview shown on the Disney official YouTube account.
*In the short, [[Queen Arianna|Rapunzel's mother]] has her first speaking role, though it's only one line of dialogue, and it wasn't real since it was in Maximus and Pascal's imaginations.
*Fans joke that the Maximus and Pascal's nightmare scenario was directed by Michael Bay, who is known for using over-the-top action and massive explosions in his films.
*Unlike the original ''[[Tangled]]'' film, which was rated PG by the MPAA, this short film is rated G by the MPAA, as most Disney animated short films have that rating in the United States.
*The short takes place approximately two years after the original film, with the events in-between being explored upon in the [[Tangled: The Series|animated series]].
**Rapunzel and Eugene get engaged at the end of the [[Plus Est En Vous|final episode]] of the series, which leads up into the wedding of this short.
**Eugene wears a sash that [[King Edmund|his father]] has made for him at the end of "[[Return of the King]]".
**[[Hook Hand]]'s presence indicates that he returned to Corona following his world tour as described in ''Tangled: The Series''. In the series finale, his younger brother, [[Hook Foot|Hook Hand]] is seen in the final wide-shot, confirming his return as well.
**The [[Captain of the Guards|retired captain]] of the royal guards does not appear, likely due to his said [[Flynn Rider|retirement]] in the series.
**The absence of Rapunzel's former handmaiden [[Cassandra (Tangled)|Cassandra]], as well as the redemption of the [[Stabbington Brothers|Stabbingtons]] is revealed throughout the final season of the series. However, the nonappearances of many characters during the wedding, such as [[Varian]], [[Lance Strongbow|Lance]], [[King Edmund]] and the Brotherhood, [[Angry and Red|Angry, Red]], [[Willow]], and many others in this short goes unexplained,
