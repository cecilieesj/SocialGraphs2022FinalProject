'''''Hawaiian Holiday''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon short that was released in [[1937]]. It is notably one of only four theatrical shorts in which all five members of [[The Sensational Six|the Fabulous Five]] (the collective group name for Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Pluto) appear together, the others being ''[[On Ice]]'', ''[[The Standard Parade]]'', and ''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' (if [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]]'s cameo near the end is counted).

The cartoon stars an ensemble cast of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Donald Duck, and Goofy while vacationing in Hawaii (then an organized incorporated territory of the United States).

==Synopsis==
Mickey and Minnie play the ukulele and dance for a few brief moments - then it's on to the main body of the short as Goofy surfs, Pluto fights with a crab, and Donald sets himself on fire.
