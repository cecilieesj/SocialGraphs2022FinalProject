|language = English}}{{Quote|This story about a singing whale is one of the strangest ever told. Yet, every word of it, and every note of it is vouched for by one of the Whale's closest friends, a [[Whitey|seagull]]. The Whale's name was [[Willie the Whale|Willie]], and his big ambition was to appear at the met. Now, many big things have hit the met from time to time, why not a whale? Not just a whale of a singer, but a singing whale. Willie was three times as interesting as an ordinary singer, because he could sing in three different voices. Not just one at a time, but all at once. How did he do it? Well, there's not much of a secret about it, anybody with three separate voices can do it. It's as easy as saying Jack Robinson [Repeats "Jack Robinson in three voices] See what I mean? Of course, you might not be able to start right off with grand operatic selections, but you can begin with a simple round. And it'll sound like this. [sings "Three Blind Mice" in a round with three voices] Now I've had quite a lot of experience with this sort of thing myself. By studying the Willie the Whale method, I too am able to sing with three voices at once. That's why I was chosen to tell you the story. I not only do all the singing, but I do all the talking, too. And every once in a while, you'll notice that I interrupt my own songs to take different parts and to describe the action.|Nelson Eddy}}

'''''Willie the Operatic Whale''''', also known as '''''The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met''''', is an animated short released in [[1946]]. It was produced by [[Walt Disney]], and Nelson Eddy provided the voice of both the narrator and various characters. It was released theatrically as a segment in ''[[Make Mine Music]]'', then re-issued the following year accompanying a re-issue of ''[[Fantasia]]'' (as a short subject before the film), then separately on home video in the [[1990]]s. The short was also reissued on [[August 17]], [[1954]].

==Plot==
News comes to the music and science world of a whale that can sing opera. The news is met with disbelief and jeers from the musical and science communities. One person who may have a different theory about the whale's reputed musical abilities is opera showman [[Tetti-Tatti]]. He believes that [[Willie the Whale]] has swallowed an opera singer and is holding him prisoner in his belly. Hiring an expedition, the showman heads for the North Pole to kill Willie. But the whale tries to show the impresario that he can really sing opera. Some time after, we, the viewers, see a montage of what would be Willie's performances in the Metropolitan Opera House (montage sequences include {{WikipediaLink|Pagliacci}}, {{WikipediaLink|Tristan and Isolde}}, and {{WikipediaLink|Mephistopheles}}). After the montage, however, despite all of Willie's efforts, Tetti Tatti shoots his spear gun and kills Willie.

However, even though Willie is long gone, his spirit lives on in Heaven, singing in a hundred voices, forever.

==Characters==
