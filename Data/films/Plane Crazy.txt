'''''Plane Crazy''''' is a [[1928]] black and white silent ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' animated short. It was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon ever to be produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] (known at the time as [[Walt Disney Productions|Walt Disney Studio]]), even though ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' was shot and released earlier.

==Plot==
Inspired by Charles Lindbergh's historic flight across the Atlantic Ocean, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and his barnyard friends build their own plane. After a brief and disastrous first flight, Mickey quickly puts together a new plane and invites [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] to fly with him. After a wild ride around the barnyard, Mickey finally regains control of the vehicle and turns his attention to Minnie.

Though she repeatedly refuses his advances, Mickey kisses her anyway. She then slaps him and uses her bloomers to parachute out of the plane. While distracted by Minnie's act, Mickey doesn't realize that the plane has gone into a tailspin until it's too late and he and the plane crash to the ground.

*The film's copyrights were renewed on [[March 14]], [[1956]]<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3101213li/page/54/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries (1956 renewals)]</ref> and [[December 16]], [[1957]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3111213li/page/117/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries (1957 renewals)]</ref>
*[[Ub Iwerks]] allegedly animated this entire film single-handedly.
*In this early film, Mickey and Minnie do not wear their signature shoes or gloves yet.
*At one point in the episode, when Mickey's and Minnie's plane is unchecked, it collides with a car. The character who is driving the car is very similar to [[Julius the Cat]].
*When Mickey tries entering the outhouse to avoid his plane, a young cat runs out with his pant seat down, reminiscent of [[Homer the Cat]] in the ''[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]'' short, ''[[All Wet]]''.
*The short was loosely adapted for the first two weeks of the very first ''Mickey Mouse'' newspaper comic arc, "[[Lost on a Desert Island]]".
*This short's plot was remade for the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short ''[[Mickey's Airplane Kit]]''.
*In the television series ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', Mickey regularly flies a plane that he calls the "Toon Plane", inspired by the one from ''Plane Crazy''.
*This is also the very first Mickey Mouse short to be produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios.
