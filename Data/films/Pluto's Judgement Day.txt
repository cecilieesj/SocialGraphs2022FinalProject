'''''Pluto's Judgement Day''''' [''{{WikipediaLink|sic}}''] is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' short released in [[1935]]. In spite of it being billed as a Mickey Mouse cartoon, though, Mickey himself barely appears in the short.

==Summary==
When Mickey catches [[Pluto]] chasing a cat, he angrily scolds him for chasing cats and will have good answer on his judgement day, then makes him lie down in front of the fireplace as punishment. Pluto then falls asleep by the fire and dreams that he is put on trial in The Underworld by a judge and jury of vindictive cats. ("[[Pluto's Judgement Day (song)|Pluto's Trial]]")

He is found guilty of several crimes against cats, which involve the cats being scared or dying, which is surprisingly dark for a Disney cartoon. As he is about to be burned to death, he awakens with a newfound appreciation for the cat after Mickey tells them to "kiss and make up".

==Trivia==
*An infamous and disturbing scene that was removed from most TV airings, but kept in home video versions, showed a trio of female kittens singing about Pluto drowning their Uncle Tom and bringing in his grave (at which all nine of his lost souls emerge and dance) as evidence.
**The three black kittens resemble blackface girls, and Uncle Tom is an obvious reference to the titular character from the famous anti-slavery novel, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.
*[[Billy Bletcher]], the first voice of [[Pete]], voiced the cat prosecutor (a demonic-looking cat dressed in red robes), while [[Clarence Nash]], the first voice of [[Donald Duck]], voiced the cat judge and the kitten Pluto was harassing at the start of the short. Bletcher would later go on to voice a devilish version of [[w:c:tomandjerry:Spike the Bulldog|Spike]] in the [[1949]] ''{{WikipediaLink|Tom and Jerry}}'' cartoon ''[[w:c:tomandjerry:Heavenly Puss|Heavenly Puss]]''.
**The ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon ''Heavenly Puss'' bears some resemblance to ''Pluto's Judgement Day'' in the end, except a cat is threatened by a demonic dog.
*The short was spoofed in ''{{WikipediaLink|The Simpsons}}'' episode "[[w:c:simpsons:How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?|How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?]]" as the ''{{WikipediaLink|Itchy and Scratchy}}'' short "[[w:c:simpsons:Dogday Hellody of 1933|Dogday Hellody of 1933]]".
*This marks the first appearance of a newly-redesigned [[Mickey Mouse]], who now has a pear-shaped body to appear more flexible.
*One of the picket signs the demon cats hold up reads: "''{{WikipediaLink|Sic semper tyrannus|Sic semper tyrannus}}''", which is usually translated from Latin as: "Thus always to tyrants" (not "Death to tyrants" as often claimed). Ironically, these words are often believed to be what {{WikipediaLink|Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus}} said before stabbing {{WikipediaLink|Julius Caesar|Caesar}} and also what {{WikipediaLink|John Wilkes Booth}} (whose intention was to emulate Brutus) said before shooting [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in the back of the head.
*When shown as part of ''Disney's Halloween Treat''/''A Disney Halloween'', the original opening and ending scenes were replaced with clips from two later Pluto cartoons, ''[[Puss Café]]'' and ''[[Cat Nap Pluto]]'', though Mickey's ghostly appearance at the beginning of Pluto's nightmare was oddly left intact. Also, Pluto's nightmare was shortened to instead end on the jury ganging up on Pluto, segueing into [[Figaro]] jumping on the sleeping Pluto from ''Cat Nap Pluto''.
