'''''The Jungle Book 2''''' is a [[2003]] American animated musical fantasy adventure film produced by the [[Disneytoon Studios]] in Sydney, Australia as well as [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in Paris, France and was released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]]. The theatrical version of the film was released in [[France]] on February 5, 2003, and released in the United States on February 14, 2003. The film is a sequel to [[Walt Disney]]'s [[1967]] film ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', and stars [[Haley Joel Osment]] as the voice of [[Mowgli]] and [[John Goodman]] as the voice of [[Baloo]].

The film was originally produced as a direct-to-video film but was released theatrically first. It is the fourth Disney sequel to have a theatrical release rather than going direct-to-video after ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' in [[1990]], [[Fantasia 2000|''Fantasia 2000'']] in [[1999]], and ''[[Return to Never Land]]'' in [[2002]]. The film is not based on ''The Second Jungle Book'' by Rudyard Kipling, first published in 1895. However, they do have several characters in common. When released, it was criticized mainly for its cut-rate animation and a lazily similar plotline to the original film, but was a commercial success, grossing $135 million on a $20 million budget.

Disney released the VHS and DVD versions on [[June 10]], 2003. On [[June 17]], [[2008]], a Special Edition DVD was released. On [[March 18]], [[2014]], the film was released on Blu-ray.

==Plot==
Taking place some short time after the first film, Mowgli is in the Man Village, living with his adoptive parents and new little brother, [[Ranjan]]. He has become sweethearts with [[Shanti]], the girl who lured Mowgli into the Man Village. One day Mowgli tries to take the Village Children into the Jungle but Shanti realizes this and yells stop. Mowgli and Ranjan's father arrives and orders the kids back into the village and scowls at Mowgli telling him the jungle is a dangerous place and shows Mowgli a scar on his left arm. He also punishes Mowgli by sending him to his room without dinner. After Mowgli gets in trouble, he blames Shanti and won't talk to her, then Mowgli starts to miss the jungle.

Meanwhile, Mowgli's best friend, Baloo, a free-spirited bear, was starting to miss Mowgli, so he decided to pick him up. But Mowgli's old panther guardian, Bagheera, however, forbids him. Passing through Bagheera and a herd of elephants, Baloo sneaks into the Man Village - unnoticed by the villagers - to visit Mowgli and get him back. Also, Mowgli's old arch enemy, Shere Khan, a vicious tiger, returns for his revenge. Meanwhile, Shanti tries to apologize to Mowgli, but she sees Baloo with Mowgli and shrieks for help. Shere Khan sneaks into the village, and everyone thinks he's the wild animal. After Baloo and Mowgli escape into the jungle, Shanti, believing her boyfriend was kidnapped, follows them. Then, Kaa, a python, spots Mowgli and Baloo talking and attempts to eat Mowgli. But, fortunately, he fails.

Later, Kaa spots Shanti alone and tries to eat her. He manages to subdue her with his hypnotic stare, which causes her hands to hang loosely at her sides, and to not be able to look away, until Ranjan comes forward and pulls Shanti away in time, releasing her from Kaa's trance. Ranjan starts beating Kaa with a stick, and Kaa ends up accidentally swallowing a large rock. The weight of the rock makes his coils fall on top of him. While Ranjan keeps hitting Kaa, Shanti grabs him to get away from the snake. Ranjan soon scares Kaa from behind and causes Kaa to fall off a nearby cliff and into a coconut tree, and Shanti and Ranjan soon leave. Mowgli enjoys the jungle as he used to and tells Baloo about his life in the Man Village and Shanti.

Soon, Bagheera figures out that Mowgli had escaped the Man Village with Baloo when the villagers are in the jungle, calling for Mowgli, and he tries to find him. Shanti and Ranjan are still looking for Mowgli, then get lost in the jungle. They soon find Mowgli sadly sitting in a tree, and when he sees Shanti, he falls into some vines and gets tangled. Baloo finds them and scares Shanti but gets caught in the vines and punched in the nose by Shanti's fist. Shanti learns that Mowgli told Baloo to scare her, and she gets angry at him and runs away with Ranjan. Mowgli gets angry at Baloo for scaring Shanti and goes after them. He finds them and wants to explain, but Shanti points to Shere Khan, who is behind him. The children run, and Mowgli tells Shanti and Ranjan to stay put in a bush. Shanti goes to help Mowgli and tells Ranjan to stay; Ranjan (after snagging his loincloth on a branch and getting sling-shotted backward while trying to follow Shanti) encounters Baloo. He tries to run away, but Baloo picks up Ranjan by the loincloth, tells him to calm down, and asks him where Mowgli is. Ranjan shouts, "Shere Khan!" and Baloo takes Ranjan on his shoulders while running after Mowgli. Mowgli finds an ancient temple and hides. Baloo and Ranjan run into Bagheera, whom Baloo leaves Ranjan with when they all arrive at the temple, which Shanti has arrived at as well. She and Baloo encounter each other and soon learn that they are on the same side and split up. Baloo begins banging on a gong, soon being joined by Shanti and Mowgli each in their hiding places and confuse Shere Khan. Shanti's gong falls down, and Shere Khan threatens her. Mowgli comes out of his hiding place, and Shere Khan runs to kill him. Mowgli begins to run, and Baloo pushes Shere Khan away. Mowgli and Shanti run up a staircase, soon being followed by Shere Khan after Baloo tries to stop him again and soon run into a crater and jump across and land on a tiger head statue. Shere Khan jumps onto the tiger head, which starts to fall. Shere Khan falls and lands on a rock, and the tiger head lands down, trapping him inside. Mowgli and Shanti fall too but are saved by Baloo.

Meanwhile, Lucky, a new member of the vultures, comes down and teases Shere Khan. After returning to safety, Mowgli, Shanti, and Ranjan say goodbye to Baloo and Bagheera and reunite with their families where Mowgli's father apologizes to him for not understanding that the jungle is part of who he is, and they return to the village. Not long after returning to the village, Mowgli, Shanti, and Ranjan secretly return to the jungle to spend some time with their new jungle family, unaware that Mowgli and Ranjan's parents know where they're going.

==Trivia==
*Kaa is the second character to originally be played by [[Sterling Holloway]] and then taken over by [[Jim Cummings]], the first being [[Winnie-the-Pooh]].
*Hippopotamuses, Thomson's gazelle, Kookaburra, Sifaka lemurs, and ocelots were seen during the ''W-I-L-D'' song; this is a slight error because these animals are not native to [[India]].
*Like the previous film, the two cats, Bagheera and Shere Khan, never meet during the course of the film.
*It is one of the previews to the 2002 DVD release of [[The Santa Clause|''The Santa Clause'']]. The other previews are ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'', ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', [[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas|''Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas'']], [[The Country Bears|''The Country Bears'']], and [[Inspector Gadget 2|''Inspector Gadget 2'']].
* This was [[Tony Jay]]'s last reprising role before his death in 2006.
*Shere Khan's line, "Don't insult my intelligence. It makes me irritable," is similar to a line said by Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather''.
*This was the first film released under the [[Disneytoon Studios]] label after Disney MovieToons/Disney Video Premieres was split from Walt Disney Television Animation (now [[Disney Television Animation]]) to be owned by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] which was then known as Walt Disney Feature Animation in January 2003 though those names would not be changed till June of that year.
*This was Disney's first animated film outside of Pixar to be broadcast on STARZ.
*It is the fifth Disney sequel to get a theatrical release, following ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', and ''[[Return to Neverland]]'' Other than ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Cars 2]]'',  [[Finding Dory|''Finding Dory'']], ''[[Cars 3]]'', ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' and [[Frozen II|''Frozen II'']]. every other Disney sequel has had a direct to VHS/DVD release.
*[[King Louie]] does not appear in this sequel, probably due to controversy surrounding the character.
*Outside the USA, the DVD releases in the UK & Australia are THX Certified.
