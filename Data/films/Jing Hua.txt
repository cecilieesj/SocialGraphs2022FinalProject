A grieving martial artist pays tribute to her recently departed teacher by creating a painted world using a magical form of kung fu.

== Plot ==
Presented in the style of water color paintings, a martial artist named Jing Hua sits at the gravestone of her former master, grieving. She stands and proceeds to perform kung fu, creating the trees, mountains and world around her while doing so. Due to her grief, she continues to exhibit pain in the form of dripping ink off of her body.

When Jing Hua creates a lake in front of her, she bends over in pain. She has a vision of her master and roars as she dissipates the image and world around her. Jing Hua stands in front of the gravestone, tired, but undefeated.
