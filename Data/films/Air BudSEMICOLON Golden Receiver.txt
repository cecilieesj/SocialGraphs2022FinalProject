Several months after [[Norman Snively]] is sent to prison and becoming Buddy's legal owner, [[Josh Framm]], now a teenager, becomes angry when his mother, [[Jackie Framm|Jackie]], begins dating Dr. Patrick Sullivan, the town's new veterinarian after a couple of failed dates. It all starts when Patrick innocently tosses Josh's basketball-savvy dog, [[Air Bud (dog)|Buddy]], a football one day, and he discovers that Buddy also has an uncanny ability to play that sport. Soon enough, Buddy begins playing on Josh's school football team. At first, the team is failing miserably, and the school intends to fire the coach if the team does not start winning. However, thanks to Buddy's superior football skills and fast running, the team keeps on winning and they make the playoffs, eventually reaching the championship. Meanwhile, two Russian siblings, Natalya and Popov, kidnap him in hopes of having him perform as the special attraction in the Russian circus while Josh runs away when Patrick proposes to Jackie. His coach finds him and convinces him that just because Patrick is in his life now, he doesn't have to stop loving his father and he returns home, but Patrick is gone and Buddy is missing.

The Timberwolves are forced to play the final game without Buddy and are losing big. Buddy and the other animals manage to escape and Natalya and Popov are arrested and placed into the custody of the Russian embassy after their van falls into a lake following a chase sequence. Meanwhile, Patrick finds Buddy and takes him to the game. With his help, they catch up, but he is tackled and taken out of the game. They are forced to finish it without him and thanks to Josh and Tommy, they win. Later, Josh stops Patrick from leaving and convinces him to stay. They later go to a Seattle Seahawks football game and Buddy sneaks onto the field.
