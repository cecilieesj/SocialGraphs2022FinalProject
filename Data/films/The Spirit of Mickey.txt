The framing device of the video was that Mickey and his friends were all presenting Mickey's greatest cartoons, using stock footage from ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' , and various Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck shorts.

None of the shorts are shown with their original title cards. Instead, the titles were shown on the corner of the screen, disappearing after a few seconds.

This video also notably marked the home video debut of the shorts ''[[Orphan's Picnic]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Surprise Party]]''. The latter short is edited on the video; the Nabisco logo is removed from the food packages at the end, and some of the dialogue regarding the food is redubbed.

The tape apparently was going to be re-released in 2000, as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection (as seen on a preview to the collection on various DVDs). However, it was never re-released.

The compilation premiered in [[Marceline, Missouri]], the childhood home of [[Walt Disney]].
