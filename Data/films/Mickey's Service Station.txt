*This short appears as one of the projector transition levels in ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]''.
*This cartoon marks the final appearance of Pete's infamous peg-leg, which would not be seen again until the direct-to-video film [[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers|''Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers'']] ([[2004]]) 69 years later. The disappearance of the peg-leg was because the animators could never remember which leg the peg was supposed to be on, and decided it would be cheaper to give Pete two legs. Pete's peg-leg would permanently return in [[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|the recent Mickey Mouse reboot by Paul Rudish]].
