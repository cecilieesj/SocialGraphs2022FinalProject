'''''Donald's Happy Birthday''''' is a [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] animated short.

==Synopsis==
[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] earn enough money to buy their Uncle Donald a birthday present. Donald, not knowing what the money is for, wants the kids to save their money for a rainy day. The boys manage to get the money back and buy Donald a box of cigars. Donald thinks the boys have taken up smoking and forces them to smoke the cigars. Suddenly, he finds a card in the box wishing him a happy birthday from his nephews, so the cigars were actually a gift for him. Donald is so ashamed of his actions that he shrinks down to a really tiny size and disappears through a hole in the floor of the tree house.
