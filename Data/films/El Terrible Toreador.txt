'''''El Terrible Toreador''''' is a [[Silly Symphony|''Silly Symphony'']] that was released on [[September 26]], [[1929]].

==Synopsis==
The film opens somewhere in Spain. A lady is carrying a mug of beer above her head, walking rhythmically to the music of "Carmen". She walks over to a man in a white suit. The man gives her a coin, and she modestly puts it in her shirt. Then the lady does a quick dance in front of the man in the suit. The man tips her, and the money falls into a container on the floor. The lady just ignores him. Outside the building, a toreador is standing. When he sees the lady, with the man in the suit, he is fuming mad. So, the man in the suit grabs the lady, and soon the two fight over her. This ends with the lady walking away. Then another scene opens with a bullfighting ring and the bull (strangely reminiscent of [[Clarabelle Cow]]) and the toreador walk into there. Followed by a few gags and music performances, the toreador finishes up the scene by pulling out the bull's insides.

==Trivia==
*The film's copyright was renewed on [[December 16]], [[1957]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3111213li/page/119/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries (1957 renewals)]</ref>
*The matador is a caricature of [[Walt Disney]]. This wouldn't be the last time this would happen, as he would be caricatured that way again in ''[[Ferdinand the Bull]]''.
*This cartoon notably had a very dark and graphic scene, even for a ''Silly Symphony'' cartoon produced during the pre-Code era, at the ending where the matador kills the bull by pulling it inside out.
