'''''Modern Inventions''''' is a cartoon directed by [[Jack King]] that was released on [[May 29]], [[1937]]. It was branded as part of the ''Mickey Mouse'' series on its initial release, and later branded as part of the ''Donald Duck'' series when it was re-released.

==Plot==
[[Donald Duck|Donald]] visits "[[Museum of Modern Marvels|The Museum of Modern Marvels]]", which showcases various futuristic electronic appliances and inventions. In the museum, Donald encounters and struggles with many strange and whimsical machines, all of which seem to be against him. A running gag throughout the picture has the [[Robot Butler]] appearing to take away Donald's hat, with the words "Your Hat, Sir." After encountering a robotic hitch-hiker, a wrapping machine and a fully-automated baby carriage, the short ends when Donald attempts to scam a robotic barber chair and winds up getting a haircut on his behind and a shoe-shined bill.

==The Machines==
Donald struggles with various inventions and robots throughout the cartoon, including:
*[[Robot Butler]]
*[[Hitch-Hiker's Aid]]
*[[Bundle Wrapper|Automatic Bundle-Wrapper]]
*[[Robot Nurse Maid]]
*[[Mechanical Barber Chair]]

==The Hats==
Throughout the cartoon, Donald magically pulls hats out of thin air to replace those taken by the Robot Butler (often followed by "So!"). These include:

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_hat Top hat]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicorne Napoleonic officer hat]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_kepi Civil War kepi] (however, the Robot Butler picks up on this one almost immediately after Donald puts it on and starts to give chase)
*Baby bonnet (he puts this one on whilst testing the Robot Nurse Maid)
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat Bowler hat]

==Trivia==
*This is the third and final cartoon to be originally released under [[Mickey Mouse]]'s name, despite Mickey himself not appearing. The first was ''[[Donald and Pluto]]'' and the second was ''[[Don Donald]]''.
*The scene where Donald's tail feather cut by the mechanical barber chair is mentioned in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Everybody Loves Mickey]]", with [[Goofy]] and [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] trying to figure out the name of the cartoon it was in. Donald mistakenly tells them that it was from a short called ''Donald's Haircut'' made in [[1945]], only for Mickey to correct him.
*Matt Groening stated in its corresponding audio commentary that this cartoon was the inspiration for the suicide booths in the pilot of ''Futurama''.
*The climax with the mechanical barber is the first notable story contribution to Donald Duck by future comic writer (and major Donald Duck influence) [[Carl Barks]].
