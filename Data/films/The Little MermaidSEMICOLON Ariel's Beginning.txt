'''''The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning''''' (also known as '''''The Little Mermaid III''''') is a direct-to-video film released in [[2008]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]. It is the prequel to the [[1989]] Disney animated feature ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. The film follows Ariel's past, including the death of her mother Queen Athena.
==Plot==
[[King Triton]] and his wife, [[Queen Athena]], rule over the underwater kingdom of [[Atlantica]], which is filled with music and laughter. They have seven young daughters, the youngest of whom is [[Ariel]]. The [[Merpeople|merfolk]] are shown relaxing in a lagoon above water, and Triton gives Athena a music box. Suddenly, a big pirate ship approaches. Everyone escapes except Athena, who is crushed by the ship when she tries to save the music box, due to the pirates having apparently lost control of their own vessel and unable to divert it away from crushing Athena and running aground. Devastated and heartbroken by Athena's death, Triton throws the music box into the ocean and bans music from the kingdom.

Ten years later, Ariel and her six older sisters are not happy with living under a strict routine maintained by their governess, [[Marina Del Rey]] and her assistant, [[Benjamin]]. Marina hates being the girls' governess and longs to be Triton's attaché, a job currently filled by [[Sebastian|Sebastian the crab]]. Ariel hates their current lifestyle, which brings her into conflict with her father. One day, Ariel encounters [[Flounder]] the tropical fish whom she later follows to an underground music club. She is overjoyed by the presence of music and is shocked when she sees Sebastian performing there. When her presence is revealed, the entire band stops playing and hides, believing Ariel will tell her father about them. Ariel sings a song explaining her love of music and the remembrance of her mother and she joins the club with an oath.

Ariel returns to the palace, and her sisters confront her over her disappearance. She explains where she was, and the following night all seven girls go to the club to have fun. Marina secretly finds them, and she later reports their activities to Triton. Sebastian, Flounder, and the band are sent to jail while Marina gets the job she wants.

Triton confines his daughters to the palace, and Ariel says that her mother would not have wanted music forbidden. She swims to the bedroom, with her sisters following and telling her that no one is happy, except Marina. Marina, who is not the girls' governess anymore, is now Triton's new attaché and is happy with her new job, while everyone is sad and miserable. That night, Ariel, who can't live without music, leaves Atlantica and frees her friends. Sebastian leads them to a deserted place away from the palace, where Ariel finds Athena's music box, as Sebastian hoped.

Marina happily talks to Triton about her new job in the kingdom but is interrupted by Attina, the eldest of Ariel's six older sisters, telling Triton that Ariel is not in Atlantica. Triton orders his guards to bring Ariel back home, ignoring and angering Marina. In her lair, Marina tells Benjamin that she releases her electric eels from the dungeon to kill Sebastian and forbid Ariel to return to Atlantica so she can remain as Triton's attache. Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian decide to return to Atlantica to bring the music box to Triton, hoping that it will change his mind, as he has forgotten how to be happy after Athena's death.

On the way back, Marina and her electric eels confront Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian. Before music is restored back into the kingdom, the final battle begins when Marina bans Ariel from going back to Atlantica. Marina wants to stop them so she will retain her position of "power", and a struggle ensues. The music band friends save Ariel and Flounder from being murdered by Marina's three electric pet eels. It ends when Marina almost kills Sebastian, but Ariel pushes her away, getting hit in the process, and faints. Triton arrives in time to witness this, and he is remorseful for his actions. He sings the lyrics of "Athena's Song", and Ariel wakes up. Triton apologizes to Ariel for not listening to her and for not answering and sends her back to Atlantica before ordering his guards to arrest Marina.

The film ends when Triton allows both love and music back into his kingdom and appoints Sebastian as the new court composer of Atlantica, much to everyone's glee with Ariel and Flounder. Everyone, including Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, and six older sisters, rejoices except Marina, who has been sent to prison and is constantly blowing her nose.

==Production==
A teaser trailer and musical preview of the film (an alternate version of "Jump in the Line") were attached to the Platinum Edition DVD of ''The Little Mermaid'', which was released in October 2006. At the time, the working title ''The Little Mermaid III'' was still being used. At that point, the preview showed Eric's ship blowing up in a storm, Melody's necklace falling under the water, and Ariel's face silhouetted in the water. This was probably based on a previous version of the story since the trailer doesn't really match what actually happens in the released movie. In addition, a storyboarded sequence developed by Tod Carter indicated that the film was initially intended to be a sequel of at least ''The Little Mermaid'', if not ''Return to the Sea'', with part of its plotline involving locating a white whale at the behest of Prince Eric.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070315222827/http://www.todcarter.com/gallery/gallery_images/mermaid_1.jpg</ref>

==Reception==
The DVD became the top-selling DVD for the week ending April 30. Reviews of the film from audiences were mixed, though the film received negative reviews from critics. The new villain, Marina Del Rey, has been criticized as being a poor follow-up to [[Ursula]]. The animation quality of the film has been praised as being "impressive" for a direct-to-video and comparable to that of the original film. A mildly negative review has described that in the film "goofiness often gets buried too often underneath a blah story that's much too run-of-the-mill to allow the emotional oomph of the characters' plights to truly impact". The music has also been criticized as being unmemorable, with one review stating that "to label this a musical would be false advertising". The movie received a 33% Rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

==Trivia==
[[File:Mermaid 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Storyboard for the opening of what would eventually become ''Ariel's Beginning''.]]
*There were some continuity problems between the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]], this movie, as well as the first film.
**One notable issue is how Flounder and Ariel met. The TV series shows that they met when Ariel was still a child, while this film shows Ariel to have been older.
**Marina Del Rey, Triton's governess, was seen surfacing (as well as being almost humiliated by Scuttle) while celebrating her victory, something that would not have been possible had there been a ban on visiting the surface, especially of someone with as high of a position of power as Marina.
**Another major plothole, was in the ending. The original film implied during "[[Daughters of Triton]]" that the concert that Ariel missed was supposed to be her debut appearance in the band, and that her sisters had been veterans in the band.<ref>And then there's the youngest in her musical debut Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you to sing a song that Sebastian wrote.</ref> This is something that would not have been possible seeing how Ariel had saved music in Atlantica, which would have made her band leader instead of waiting a year to join.
***On a related note, the birth-order of Ariel's sisters were changed; from both the TV series and the original film (the latter being strongly implied from the lyrics of the song "Daughters of Triton" had their birth order as Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Attina, Adella, Alana, and Ariel.
*[[Jim Cummings]] voices King Triton in this film due to [[Kenneth Mars]] being unable to show up for the recording due to his illness. Three years later, Mars passed away from pancreatic cancer on February 12, 2011, at the age of 75.
*Before details of the plot were revealed, some fans thought that the premise was going to be about Ariel telling Melody about her origins, which was backed up by Tara Strong being credited as a Voice Actress involved in the film, as well as a [[The Little Mermaid III original opening|leaked storyboard]] where Ariel is conversing with Sebastian and Eric comes in and asks if someone's acting a bit ''crabby'', and also the teaser trailer in The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition.
*It was originally planned to make Ariel more "contemporary" during the development of the prequel. However, Jodi Benson fought to have Ariel retain her characteristic rebelliousness.
*This is the last sequel to a movie from the Disney Animated Canon until ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' in 2018.
*This movie marks the final time [[Samuel E. Wright]] voices Sebastian, as well as his last role before his death 13 years later in 2021.
*It was the last Disneytoon Studios film to use traditional animation.
