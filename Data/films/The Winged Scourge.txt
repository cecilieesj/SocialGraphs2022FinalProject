'''''The Winged Scourge''''' is the first of a series of health-related educational short films produced by the Disney studios and the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs for showing in Latin America. It was also the only one to use established Disney characters (the Seven Dwarfs).

==Synopsis==
In this propaganda short, the viewers are taught about how the mosquito can spread malaria. A young mosquito flies into a house and consumes the blood of an infected human. She then consumes the blood of a healthy human, transmitting the disease into him. It turns out that this is actually a film within a film and the Seven Dwarfs are watching it. The Dwarfs volunteer to get rid of the mosquito by destroying her breeding grounds and encouraging its natural predators.

==Characters==
*[[Doc]]
*[[Bashful]]
*[[Sleepy]]
*[[Sneezy]]
*[[Happy]]
*[[Dopey]]
*[[Grumpy]]

==Trivia==
*A scene from this cartoon where one of the mosquito larvae hatches was used in a [https://shiningtimestation.fandom.com/wiki/Achoo 1991 episode] of the PBS series '''''Shining Time Station''''' during a story about a kid who got sick though here the larvae is portrayed as a germ.
*An instrumental version of "[[Whistle While You Work]]" is used during the dwarfs' scene.
*The short mentions the use of [[wikipedia:Paris green|Paris green]] and motor oil to control the spread of malaria-borne mosquitoes, both of which are no longer recommended; Paris green was once used as a pigment and later an insecticide but has since been discontinued due to it being extremely poisonous.
