It would have been directed by [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], the directors of the [[2009]] film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. Unfortunately, the Discworld rights were sold as a package and Disney was unwilling to option the full franchise, so it was cancelled.



As a result, Musker and Clements ended up producing another animated film titled ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'' released in [[2016]] instead due to the fact that Disney could not afford the rights to purchase the Discworld franchise.
