Depressed by his lack of success, he sits on the sidewalk next to a worker, who asks Donald about his saddened looks. Hearing his troubles, the man confesses he too was helped by charity during previous hard times, and mourns that now he can't give too much, but is still eager to donate Donald a money reminding that, if many gave a little, that little would become much bigger.
