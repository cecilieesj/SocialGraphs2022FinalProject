==Differences from the 1953 film==
*While the original Disney film, as well as the original play and novel and most other adaptations, was simply titled "Peter Pan,” the remake is titled "Peter Pan and Wendy,” in homage to one of the alternate titles of the original play and novel, “Peter and Wendy.”
*The Lost Boys not only include boys, but girls, too. 
** Slightly is now a child with Down Syndrome, Nibs is biracial, the twins are African-American girls, Cubby is renamed Curly, like in the original play and novel and most other adaptations, and is a girl instead of a boy, and Tootles is an African-American.
**There are also two new characters among the Lost Children; Birdie, a Chinese-American girl, and Bellweather, a Latino boy.
*While Tinker Bell was a white Caucasian in the original play, novel, and Disney film and many other adaptations, she is now an African-American in the remake.
*While Captain Hook and George Darling were both performed by the same actor in the original Disney film, as well as the original play and many other adaptations, both characters are now portrayed by two different actors in the remake. The first time this tradition break happened was in NBC’s broadcast of “Peter Pan Live!” in 2014, where [[Christopher Walken]] played Captain Hook and [[Christian Borle]] played both Mr. Smee and George Darling instead.
*Tiger Lily will have a larger role in the remake than she did in the original Disney film. 
** She now has a horse sidekick.
**She is described in the remake as "Both a fierce warrior and a serene and benevolent leader who protects Neverland and the Lost Boys and Girls from the dastardly Captain Hook.”
**She is now bilingual, speaking in both English and her native language.
*In the original Disney film and some adaptation versions, Captain Hook's namesake prosthetic hook is on his left hand, but in this remake, it's on his right hand, like in the original play, novel, and most other adaptations.
*Unlike the original Disney film, this remake will not have smoking due to a ban enacted in 2015 prohibiting all forms of smoking and tobacco use from being featured in all Disney films.
*In the original Disney film, Captain Hook wears a red coat, but in this remake, he wears a blue coat.
*In the original Disney film, Wendy never wields a sword nor does she fight. But in this remake, she does as she is shown dueling Captain Hook in the official teaser poster.
**Wendy also wielded a sword and fought in the 2003 live-action film adaptation of ''Peter Pan''.
*In the original film, Peter Pan wears a hat and wields a dagger. But in the remake, he doesn't wear a hat and wields a sword.
*Wendy's backstory and the history of Peter Pan and Captain Hook's rivalry will be further explored in the remake.
*According to director David Lowery, the remake will remove problematic elements that were present in the original film such as the racist depiction of Neverland's Native American tribe. 

==Trivia==
*Ever Anderson and Jude Law also had roles in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Anderson played young [[Black Widow|Natasha Romanoff]] in ''[[Black Widow (film)|Black Widow]]'' and Law played [[Yon-Rogg]] in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''.
*This is the second remake that doesn't have the exact same title as the original film, after ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'', which was based on ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.
*This is the second remake directed by David Lowery, after ''[[Pete's Dragon (2016 film)|Pete's Dragon]]''.
*The film will be released in 2023, which will coincide with the [[Peter Pan (film)|original film]]'s 70th anniversary.
*This is the third live-action remake to be released exclusively on Disney+, after [[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|Lady and the Tramp]] and [[Pinocchio (2022 film)|Pinocchio]].
