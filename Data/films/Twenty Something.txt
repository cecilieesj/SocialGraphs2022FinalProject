==Synopsis==
Adulting can be hard. Some days you're nailing it, while other days, you're just a stack of kids hiding in a trench coat hoping no one notices. Gia finds herself in this exact scenario the night of her 21st birthday. This is a story about the insecurities of adulting and how we're all just faking it till we make it.

==Plot==
Gia has just turned 21 and is taken to her first club by her older sister Nicole. Nervous about her first time out, Gia is personified as her 10, 16 and 1 year old selves stacked on each other and wearing an overcoat. From the get go, Gia has trouble identifying with her surroundings and runs to the bathroom. All three Gias argue with each other over their failed efforts in "driving", both literally and figuratively, and resolve to simply make the best of their time together and act like a decent 21 year old.

Gia heads back out onto the dance floor with her sister and spots a "Cute Dude". 16 becomes enamored and attempts to take the reigns of the situation, but 1 accidentally steps on his foot and scares him away. 10 gets into an argument with 16 and 1 tries to take control, only to accidentally throw up on another patron. All three Gias fight until they spill out onto the dance floor, causing everyone to stop and stare. The Gias all solemnly walk back into the bathroom and cry together.

Nicole goes into the bathroom to check on her sister and tells her that she is well aware of how hard it is at adulting. She relates a story of how the first time she went to a concert, she peed herself. She tells her that she has already accomplished many things and that she will eventually get better at it. All three Gias hug and, upon leaving the stall, form back into 21 year old Gia. As the sisters head back out, they imagine all the other clubbers at various ages and dance the night away.
