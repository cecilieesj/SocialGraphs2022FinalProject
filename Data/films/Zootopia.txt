==Synopsis==
The modern mammal metropolis of [[Zootopia (location)|Zootopia]] is a city like no other. Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy [[Sahara Square]] and frigid [[Tundratown]], damp [[Rainforest District]], and calm little [[Bunnyburrow]], it's a melting pot where animals from every environment live together — a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when optimistic Officer [[Judy Hopps]] arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn't so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox [[Nick Wilde]] to solve the mystery.<ref>[http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-zootopia-concept-art-synopsis-74505/ ''Stitch Kingdom'': Disney’s ‘Zootopia’ Concept Art, Synopsis]</ref>

==Plot==
Zootopia is a gleaming metropolis populated by anthropomorphic mammals, divided into several districts including [[Sahara Square]], [[Tundratown]], [[Little Rodentia]], and [[Rainforest District]].

This film begins with a jungle which fades into a children's play about the history of Zootopia. One day, Judy Hopps, a bunny rabbit from rural [[Bunnyburrow]], fulfills her dream of joining the Zootopia Police Department as the first rabbit officer, however, she is regularly assigned parking duty by [[Chief Bogo]]. During one of her shifts, she is manipulated by [[Nick Wilde]], a con artist fox. Judy unlawfully arrests [[Duke Weaselton]] at [[Little Rodentia]] and is reprimanded by Bogo until [[Mrs. Otterton]], an otter, arrives pleading help on locating her missing husband, one of the many recently missing predators. To Bogo's dismay, Judy volunteers and the assignment is praised by assistant mayor Dawn Belleweather. However, Bogo gets Judy to agree to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48 hours. With Nick as a key witness of [[Mr. Otterton]]'s disappearance, Judy locates the fox and coerces him to assist her with the investigation lest he be charged with tax evasion, which he openly admitted and Judy recorded with her [[Carrot Pen|carrot pen]], saying "It's called a hustle, sweetheart."

After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number from Mystic Springs Oasis, Judy and Nick track the vehicle from the Department of Mammal Vehicles to [[Mr. Big]], an arctic shrew crime boss in Tundratown. Mr. Big spares their lives after learning that Judy had rescued his daughter earlier, and informs the pair that Mr. Otterton is his florist and had been picked up by his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar, to bring him to Mr. Big to talk about something important. However, en-route, Otterton suddenly "went savage" - meaning he reverted to a feral state - and attacked Manchas before running off. Judy and Nick locate Manchas at his home in the Rainforest District for questioning. Manchas describes the attack on him and mentions that Otterton had been yelling about "[[Night howlers|night howlers]]". However, before he can reveal anything else, Manchas suddenly turns savage himself and chases the pair, but they manage to escape. Judy calls the ZPD for help, but when Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas is nowhere to be found. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more hours to solve the case. As the pair leave the Rainforest District, Nick opens up to Judy, revealing that he was bullied by prey animals as a cub for being the only predator and subsequently became a con artist, resolving to live out the "sly fox" stereotype, as he felt no one will ever see a fox as anything else.

Nick realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured how Manchas disappeared, and the pair consults [[Bellwether|Assistant Mayor Bellwether]]. They then discover that Manchas was captured by wolves, which Judy assumes is what Otterton had meant by "night howlers". Judy and Nick locate Cliffside Asylum, where the wolves have detained the missing predators (including Mr. Otterton), all of which have gone savage, and eavesdrop on [[Mayor Lionheart]] consulting with a doctor about their condition, revealing that he is keeping the savage predators hidden from both the public and the ZPD, and that the cause their strange behavior is unknown. The pair escape, inform Bogo and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart and those involved. Bellwether subsequently becomes the new mayor.

Having developed a friendship with Nick throughout the case, Judy requests that he joins the ZPD and become her partner, which Nick happily considers. However, a pressured Judy describes the savaged predators' condition during a press conference as them reverting to their natural instincts. This seemingly confirms Judy's bigotry against foxes to Nick, who angrily walks out on her offer after he asks her if she sees ''him'' as a savage predator (along with her almost reaching for her fox repellent after he asks if she thought he would ''eat'' her). When fear and discrimination against predators spread across Zootopia, a guilt-ridden Judy resigns, feeling that she made things worse. During this time, Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored.

Two to three months later,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/729031671933075456|author=Rich Moore|work=Twitter|title=From press conference to making up it was about 2.5-3 months.|date=2016-05-07|accessdate=2016-07-25}}</ref> Judy has returned to Bunnyburrow and rejoined the family business as a carrot farmer. However, she later learns from her parents and reformed childhood bully, fox [[Gideon Grey]], that "night howlers" are toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Realizing that the flowers are what Otterton was referring to and that they must be the cause of the outbreaks, Judy returns to Zootopia, where she reconciles with Nick. They then locate Weaselton, who explains that he has been collecting night howlers for a ram named [[Doug (Zootopia)|Doug Ramses]], who owns a lab hidden in the subway tunnels. The pair finds the lab and discovers Doug creating a night howler serum, which he has been exposing to predators via paintball-like pellets fired by an air-powered sniper gun. Judy and Nick hijack the lab (which is on a still functional train) and race to the ZPD with the evidence but are pursued by Doug's henchrams, whom they barely manage to defeat. The train is destroyed in the process, but Nick manages to save a case containing Doug's sniper gun and the serum pellet.

Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who insists she takes the evidence. Realizing she is the mastermind of the conspiracy, Judy and Nick try to flee but are knocked into a pit by her henchrams. Bellwether shoots a serum pellet from the evidence case at Nick and frames a call for help to the ZPD. Nick seemingly becomes savage and corners Judy, but it turns out the pair was acting in order to trick Bellwether into openly admitting her prey-supremacist scheme to take over Zootopia and rid it of all predators, and that they replaced the dart gun ammo with blueberries from the Hopps' farm. With Bellwether's monologue recorded on Judy's carrot pen just as Bellwether made her short-lived threat to frame them as she did with Lionheart, Chief Bogo and the ZPD arrive and arrest her and her henchrams upon hearing everything. Upon being informed and interviewed on the matter, Lionheart denies any knowledge of Bellwether's plot, but admits to having illegally imprisoned the savage predators, claiming it to have been done for "right reasons".

Later, Judy is reinstated into the ZPD. An antidote is discovered for the effects of the night howlers, and all the infected predators, including Mr. Otterton and Mr. Manchas, are cured. Months later (about a year after Judy started her job at the ZPD), Nick joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and Judy's new partner. The final scene (during the credits) has almost all Zootopian citizens attending Gazelle's concert while Bellwether angrily as Doug, Jesse, and the other prisoners patting on their lap views it on a television set in prison.

==Development==
[[File:Byron Howard Savage City.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Early artwork depicting the logo and tone of ''Savage Seas'' and ''Savage City'' by co-director Byron Howard.]]
According to director [[Byron Howard]], ''Zootopia'' will be different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. The concept, where animals live in a modern world designed by animals, was well received by [[John Lasseter]], who lifted Howard "in the air like a baby [[Simba]]," when he proposed the idea for the film. The film's original concept was originally supposed to be a spy film centered on a James Bond-esque secret agent rabbit named Jack Savage. The film was under the titles [[Savage Seas|''Savage City'' and ''Savage Seas'']]. The filmmakers were unimpressed with the story, but were nevertheless interested in the concept of an all-animal city, allowing a project centering the idea to go underway.<ref>[http://kylesanimatedworld.blogspot.com/2016/03/some-zootopia-tidbits-story-origins.html Some 'Zootopia' Tidbits: Story Origins, Rich Moore's Next Project?]</ref>

While the characters are portrayed as anthropomorphic animals, the filmmakers were urged by Lasseter to keep the characteristics that make each animal unique, intact with the animation and movement that would be portrayed on screen.<ref>[http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/annecy-disney-gives-toon-fans-a-taste-of-zootopia-1201521458/ Annecy: Disney Gives Toon Fans a Taste of 'Zootopia']</ref> To do so, the film crew was sent to Kenya, Africa, as well as [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], on a research trip, where they studied various mammal wildlife.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CvT2Zxp3YCM VIDEO: Zootopia - Ginnifer Goodwin and Filmmakers Interview - D23 Expo 2015]</ref><ref name="ITM">[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2015/12/with-next-years-zootopia-walt-disney-animation-studios-promises-a-different-kind-of-talking-animal-movie Inside the Magic: With next year's "Zootopia", Walt Disney Animation Studios promises a different kind of talking animal movie]</ref> Live animals, such as sloths and fennec foxes, were also brought into the studio building for further, intimate study.

[[File:Orsi-Nick and Judy.jpg|thumb|250px|Character designs for the characters Nick Wilde (drawn with a "tame collar") and Judy Hopps by artist Nick Orsi.]]
During research, the filmmakers learned that, in nature, prey mammals outnumber predators, despite the latter group generally being considered the dominant species. In response, the story was tailored to center the relationship between the "predator and prey" group while reflecting modern day society by having the story serve as an allegory for racism and prejudice. In this version, predators, despite having evolved, were generally viewed as dangerous threats and were forced to wear electric shock collars as a means to keep their "aggressive natures" under control at the hands of prey. The "tame collar" concept stuck through most of the film's production, even being approved by John Lasseter, but when screened for the team at [[Pixar]], the response was negative. The city of Zootopia, in this state of being so blatantly unjust, was deemed too unlikable, and the story too dark, whereas the goal was to create a city that the audience could fall in love with while making a film that—despite its serious subject matter—can still be a fun family film.<ref name="Imagining">''Imagining Zootopia''. Documentary, 2016</ref><ref>''The Art of Zootopia''. Hardcover book, 2016</ref>

The character of Nick Wilde was the protagonist of this version, but his role was later swapped with Judy Hopps after much discussion, the reason being that the filmmakers felt a closer connection to her character and the struggles she would have to face in the supposedly idealistic, but ultimately flawed, society.<ref name="Imagining" /><ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/637379-cs-interview-building-zootopia-with-byron-howard-and-rich-moore#/slide/1/Directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore on the ''Zootopia'' universe, shifting focus to a female protagonist and some very punny world building]</ref>

[[File:Zootopia American Japan anchors.png|thumb|Top: The anchors in the Canadian release<br>Middle: The anchors in the Japanese release<br>Bottom: The anchors in the Chinese version]]
The primary issues centering the film, as mentioned, are prejudice and preconceived notions based on stereotypes. To further emphasize this, the creatures that inhabit Zootopia were limited down to mammals, to portray a sense of segregation between animals of predator and prey mentality; animals such as birds and marine life were left out like most, if not all, are consumers of other living organisms, making it difficult to narrow them down within the status quo of the story's conflict. The thought process of stereotypes was also integrated when deciding which familiar species would serve as the film's opposing leads, eventually determined as a rabbit-and-fox partnership.

The city of Zootopia, itself, is comprised of various districts—all of which are tailored to best suit the animals living there, both in terms of atmosphere, climate, and scale. To accomplish this, the filmmakers assembled an "Environments team", who were tasked to create the unique spaces the characters roam and inhabit throughout the film. Each area was created to look as if it has a sense of history, adding chaos and minor details to bring the world to life. Furthermore, the studio revived the use of the Hyperion rendering system, which mimics real-world geometric complexity, and was first utilized in the previous animated feature, ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.<ref name="ITM" /> Each district was also modeled after various real-world areas. For example, [[Tundratown]], the district consisting of low-temperature mammals such as polar bears, was architecturally influenced by Russia.<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/667036008274202624 Byron Howard via Twitter]</ref> [[Sahara Square]], an area for high-temperature mammals such as camels, was modeled after Las Vegas. The renderings of the snow and wintry feel of Tundratown was also influenced by the [[2013]] animated feature ''[[Frozen]]''.<ref name="ITM" />

In March 2015, [[Rich Moore]], who previously directed ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'', was revealed to have been working on the film as a director, with [[Jared Bush]] as a co-director.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/415933-walt-disney-animation-studios-reveals-new-zootopia-concept-art#/slide/1/ ''Comingsoon.net'': "Walt Disney Animation Studios Reveals New Zootopia Concept Art".]</ref>

On [[October 29]], [[2015]], Moore announced that animation on the film was wrapped.<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/659910544413978624 Rich Moore via Twitter]</ref>

{{Main|Zootopia (soundtrack)}}
In addition to her voice role of [[Gazelle]], the biggest pop star in Zootopia, [[Shakira]] also contributed to the film an original song, entitled "[[Try Everything]]", which will be written by Sia and Stargate.

On [[November 1]], 2015, it was revealed that [[Michael Giacchino]], acclaimed composer best known for his work at [[Pixar]], will be composing the score for ''Zootopia'', marking his first feature entry into the Walt Disney Animation Studios library.<ref>[http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/11/01/michael-giacchino-scoring-disneys-zootopia/ Michael Giacchino Scoring Disney's 'Zootopia']</ref> The score was completed on [[November 20]].

==Trivia==
*Bucky and Pronk Orynx-Antlerson are the first LGBT characters in the Disney Animated Canon. Disney now has an LGBT character in all of their major branches ([[Pixar]] has [[Specter]], the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has [[Valkyrie]], and [[Star Wars]] has Moff Mors).
*This is only the thirteenth non-musical film in the [[Disney Animated Canon]], following ''[[The Black Cauldron]]'', ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', ''[[Dinosaur]]'', ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', ''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]'', ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', ''[[Bolt (film)|Bolt]]'', ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]'', and ''[[Big Hero 6]]''. In addition, it's also the highest-grossing non-musical computer animated film made by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]. It is also the highest-grossing original animated film, passing ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.
*The film would currently be the 35th highest-grossing film of all time worldwide if ''Jurassic Park ''and ''Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace ''had never been re-released.
*This is the sixth Disney Animated Canon film to have no humans present at all following ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Dinosaur]]'', and ''[[Chicken Little (film)|Chicken Little]]''.
**Unlike its predecessors, this film features exclusively mammalian characters, although primates were cut from the film as the filmmakers felt that the animals looked too human-like when they walked on two legs, especially great apes. Bats were also cut from the film because they would've been the only flying animals in the world of ''Zootopia'' and because they were too small to wear clothing and look publicly suitable. However, a figurine of a bat eyewitness was released alongside with a figure of Clawhauser, ironically enough (it is unknown why no marine creatures are seen).
*Along with ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'', this is the first time since [[2002]] that Disney releases two animated features in the same year.
*This is Disney's third computer-animated film to be released in [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] theaters; the first being ''[[Tangled]]'' and ''[[Big Hero 6]]'', though the first to be released in domestic IMAX theaters.
**It is also the first time that Disney released an animated film in domestic IMAX theaters since ''Treasure Planet''.
*This is the first Walt Disney Animation Studios film not to be accompanied by a short film since [[2010]]'s ''Tangled''.
*This is the last [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] film to feature the short 2011 Disney closing logo, until 2018's ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.
*With a running time of 108 minutes, ''Zootopia'' is the third longest Disney animated film after ''[[Fantasia]]'' at 124 minutes, and ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' at 112 minutes. Since ''Fantasia'' is a compilation of shorts, ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' and ''Zootopia'' are the longest animated stories told by Disney.
*The filmmakers were inspired by previous Disney films during the making of ''Zootopia'': director Byron Howard wanted to create ''Zootopia'' as an homage to ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]'' (which he has always considered his childhood favorite Disney film) with modern CG technology, and producer Clark Spencer was inspired by ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' to produce ''Zootopia''.
*During story development, there were other districts in the city of Zootopia that were developed but not used in the film. These include '''Outback Island''', '''the Meadowlands''', '''the Nocturnal District''',<ref>[http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Three-Amazing-Zootopia-Locations-Didn-t-Make-It-Movie-107157.html Three Amazing Zootopia Locations That Didn't Make It Into The Movie] by Eric Eisenberg</ref> '''the Burrows''',<ref>[[:File:Zootopia District Brochures.jpg|Zootopia Districts]]</ref> '''the Canals''', and '''Happytown'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matthiaslechner.com/zootopia.html|title=ZOOTOPIA|author=Lechner, Matthias|format=Blog}}</ref> The Burrows may have been a precursor of [[Bunnyburrow]] (an area outside of Zootopia), and Happytown (which was actually a slummy district) seems particularly geared toward the darker, more dystopian, and mean-spirited versions of the story that were later abandoned.
*The word "Zootopia" is spoken 23 times during the film.
*Throughout ''Zootopia'', there are numerous animal parodies of real-life companies and popular culture names from their original copyright owners:
**Lululemmings - [[Wikipedia:Lululemon Athletica|Lululemon]]
**Just Zoo It - {{WikipediaLink|Just Do It}}, [[Wikipedia:Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s famous slogan.
**Preyda - {{WikipediaLink|Prada}}

**Carrot Inc. - {{WikipediaLink|Apple Inc.}}
**Some smartphones feature a logo that looks like the logo, though here, it has the shape of a carrot instead, parodying Apple Inc. smartphones called {{WikipediaLink|iPhone}}s. There are also devices resembling tablets but with a paw print logo and the name "iPaw".
***In the preview clip of the Little Rodentia chase scene, the "Mousy's" name does not appear on the store front, though Targoat does appear on Fru Fru's bag.
**Lucky Chomps - {{WikipediaLink|Lucky Charms}}, a popular cereal.
**MuzzleTime - {{WikipediaLink|FaceTime}}, Apple's video chat service.
**Trader Doe's - {{WikipediaLink|Trader Joe's}}
**Hoof Locker - {{WikipediaLink|Foot Locker}}
**Molex - {{WikipediaLink|Rolex}} (Incidentally, Molex ''is'' the name of an actual company, a major industrial electronics manufacturer.)
**PB&J - {{WikipediaLink|AT&T}}
**Lemming Brothers Bank - {{WikipediaLink|Lehman Brothers}}
**ITREEA - {{WikipediaLink|IKEA}}

*''Zootopia'' is the first Walt Disney Animation Studios film to have its background music score be composed by [[Michael Giacchino]] and also the second film score from that studio to be composed by a recurring [[Pixar]] composer; the first being ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', where its score and songs were composed by [[Randy Newman]].
*The character [[Peter Moosebridge]]'s portrayal differs based on each region's version of the film. While Moosebridge remains in the Canadian, American, and British (where he was renamed Moosos Alexander and voiced by BBC sports reporter, Veesos Alexander, though the UK home release used his US name and voice) versions, he is replaced by a jaguar called Boi Chai in the Brazilian version (voiced by Rede Bandeirantes news anchor Ricardo Boechat), a tanuki in the Japanese version, a koala in the Australian and New Zealand versions and a panda in the Chinese version.
*Because the movie and titular city were renamed "Zootropolis" for its release in the UK and Ireland, an ADR group re-recorded the original cast's lines to accommodate the change, matching the original voices perfectly. Despite this, the characters' lips still mouth "Zootopia" when they say "Zootropolis."
*On Judy's music player (that closely resembles a 6th generation iPod Nano), several famous artist and band names are parodied, including [[The Beatles]] (The Beagles), Fleetwood Mac (Fleetwood Yak), {{WikipediaLink|Foo Fighters}} (Fur Fighters), {{WikipediaLink|Guns N' Roses}} (Guns N' Rodents), [[Selena Gomez]] (Hyena Gomez), {{WikipediaLink|Kanye West}} (Kanine West), and {{WikipediaLink|Mick Jagger}} (Mick Jaguar).
*Many of the events in the movie reflect events that occurred during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s:
**Gazelle's protest to return Zootopia to its ordinary state reflects the various nonviolent protests that occurred throughout this era.
**The prejudice that the ZPD (particularly [[Chief Bogo]]) had against smaller and 'weaker' prey mammals (until [[Judy Hopps]]' triumph for the ZPD) is similar to the racism against African-Americans and all minorities during this era.
**At the beginning of the film, during Nick's Ice Cream parlor scene, [[Jerry Jumbeaux Jr.]] states that his establishment has the right to "...refuse service to anyone." "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone" was commonly found in public areas such as restaurants during this era.
*At one point in the movie, just before she gets on the train for Zootopia, Judy's parents are reminding her of all the animals she has to fear, Judy quotes U.S. President FDR's famous statement "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
*The calendars throughout the movie suggest the film's events took place during the month of May.
*Outside of Jumbeaux's Cafe (where Judy bought the Jumbo Pop for Nick and Finnick), next door, there is a theater that is showing ''Star Trunk'', a reference to ''Star Trek''.
*Finnick's van plate, which reads '''HB051986''' is a reference to actor Herschel Bernardi, who died in May 1986.
*In the original theatrical release, Mayor Lionheart's in-jail interview was slightly longer. After explaining why he imprisoned the animals, he asks the reporter, "You can understand that, can't you?" To which the reporter, a porcupine (prey species), replies flatly, "No." In all subsequent releases of the movie, these two lines are not present.
*This is the first and only movie since [[2005]] to have the old [[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]] logo from 1995-2005.
*The musical ''Rats'' is an homage to ''Cats''.

===Cameos and other Disney references===
*On the theatrical release poster for ''Zootopia'', standing behind Yax is a zebra whose son appears to be holding a stuffed [[Mickey Mouse]] doll. A Mickey Mouse doll can also be spotted in a stroller being pushed by a hippo in the scene where Nick is driving Finnick in a stroller.
*In addition to the previously mentioned songs on Judy's music player, several Disney songs are parodied, including "[[Let It Go]]" ("Let It Goat") from ''[[Frozen]]'', "[[Part of Your World]]" ("Part of Your Wool") from ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', "[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]" ("Can You Feel the Fluff Tonight") from ''[[The Lion King]]'', and "[[Arabian Nights]]" ("Ara-bunny Nights") from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''.
*In Tundratown, two little elephant girls are dressed like [[Elsa]] and [[Anna]] from ''[[Frozen]]''.
*The flower emblem on the two plates in Jumbeaux's Café comes from a decoration on Anna's bed from ''Frozen''.
*On Finnick's van is an antenna ball that resembles [[Baymax]] from ''[[Big Hero 6]]''.
**Also, on the back of the van, the magical [[Maui's Fish Hook|fish hook]] belonging to the character [[Maui]] from ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'' can be seen.
*In Little Rodentia, right next to Mousy's is a building called [[Lucky Cat Café]], a reference to the Hamada residence in ''Big Hero 6''.
**In the same area, there is a building called Hans' Pastry Shop, alluding to [[Hans]] from ''Frozen''.
*At one point, Chief Bogo references "Let It Go" from ''Frozen''. This is not only an obvious reference to the aforementioned film but also a nod to ''Frozen''<nowiki/>'s co-director [[Jennifer Lee]], who served as a co-writer for ''Zootopia''.<ref>[http://www.womenandtheirpretties.net/zootopias-creators-talk-hidden-disney-gems-serious-messages-cut-themes/ Zootopia Creators Talk Hidden Disney Gems]</ref>
*The picture on Chief Bogo's calendar in his office is the skyline of [[San Fransokyo]] from ''Big Hero 6''.
*[[Pascal]] from ''[[Tangled]]'' appears as a silhouette on a medal in Chief Bogo's office.
*[[Genie's Lamp]] is sitting on a shelf in the Mystic Springs Oasis' reception office.
*The bears scratching their backs against the trees in the naturist club resembles what [[Baloo]] was doing during "[[The Bare Necessities]]" from ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.
*In one scene, [[Duke Weaselton]] is seen selling bootlegged films, all of which are animal variants of four of Walt Disney Animation Studios' previous films and one of that in-house studio's upcoming films. Those include:
**''Wrangled'' - ''[[Tangled]]''
**''Wreck-It Rhino'' - ''[[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|Wreck-It Ralph]]''
**''Pig Hero 6'' - ''[[Big Hero 6]]''
**''Meowana'' - ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]''
**''Giraffic'' - ''[[Gigantic]]'' (now cancelled)
**''Floatzen 2'' - ''[[Frozen II]]''
*[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] appears as graffiti on the side of Doug's laboratory/subway car.
*The deer mannequin Nick shreds apart in the film's climax bears a resemblance to [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]].
*In a deleted scene, [[Robert Callaghan]]'s [[Yokai's Mask|kabuki mask]] from ''Big Hero 6'' is visible in Officer Bob's office.
