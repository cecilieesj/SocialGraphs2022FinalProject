'''''Donald's Penguin''''' is a 1939 animated short starring [[Donald Duck]].



==Synopsis==
Donald receives a package from Admiral Bird from the South Pole. Inside is a penguin named Tootsie. Donald wakes the penguin up, only for her to act disgusted at him. She eventually comes to Donald's tropical fish tank, and Donald thinks she ate them, as the tank seems empty. He then angrily spanks Tootsie, only for the fish to come out of their hiding. Donald, humiliated, tries to reconcile with her, but she refuses. Donald then gets the idea of giving her two catfish from the fridge. As he gets them, though, Tootsie actually eats the fish. Before Donald can get his hands on her, though, she splashes water onto him, knocking him onto the ground, giving her the chance to run away. Tootsie goes headfirst under a chest, and Donald tries to pull her out, only to get his fingers caught in a mousetrap presumably put there by Tootsie. As he is searching for her, she sneaks up on him and snatches the catfish from Donald's hand as well. He then chases her into a closet with a rifle, then decides that he's had enough of Tootsie and he's going to shoot her with it. However, his inner conscience tells him he shouldn't do it, but the gun falls and fires. Tootsie, though, is safe thanks to having run back into the closet. Donald finally reconciles with Tootsie.
