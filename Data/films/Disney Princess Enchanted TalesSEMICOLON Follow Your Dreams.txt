'''''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams''''' is a direct-to-video animated feature produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]]. It was planned to be the first film in the ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales'' line of direct-to-video films, featuring new stories about the [[Disney Princess|Disney Princesses]]. It was the only one in the line to be released, due to poor sales of this film. It was released on [[September 4]], [[2007]] by [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]].

The film features two different segments: one with [[Jasmine|Princess Jasmine]] from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[1992]] feature film, ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'' and another with [[Aurora|Princess Aurora]] from [[1959]]'s ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. It is a musical film in the fashion of the classics it is based on, and centers around the theme of perseverance. The film has been rated G by the MPAA.

==Plot==
===''[[Keys to the Kingdom]]''===
The new Princess Aurora story is the first Princess Aurora story since the original ''Sleeping Beauty'', and takes place after the events of the original film.

[[King Stefan]], [[Queen Leah]], [[King Hubert]], and [[Prince Phillip]] have left the kingdom for two days for a Royal Conference, leaving Aurora with control over it in their absence. The [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|good fairies]] offer their help, but she refuses, believing she can do it alone. Merryweather gives Aurora her wand in case she needs any assistance, and warns her to be very specific with the wand. They also deliver the speech that King Hubert forgot for the royal conference. With the assistance of the castle majordomo, [[The Duke|Lord Duke]], her tasks include banquets, dealing with peasants, and organizing servants who look after the Kitchens and the Gardens. Aurora believes she can do her job without the use of the wand, but later at night before bed, Aurora can't help but play with it, and uses magic to make herself a big yellow ballgown. Eventually, after a long day dealing with complaints, Aurora gives in and uses the wand to help a local farmer in need of new chickens and pigs, but her magical inexperience leads to unusual consequences, including massive chickens, green pigs, and transforming the farmer into a duck. When Stefan, Leah, Hubert, and Phillip are coming back from a royal conference, Duke warned them about what he saw; giant chickens, green pigs, and cows. After realizing using the wand was a mistake, Aurora promptly comes up with ideas to solve the problems on her own, just before her parents, Phillip, Hubert, and Duke arrived, only to see that they were no giant chickens, green pigs, and cows. They attend the royal banquet, hosted by Aurora. However, just as they were about to start, a giant chicken leg falls on the table and everyone looks at Aurora in shock as she starts to nervously explain what happened earlier.

===''[[More Than A Peacock Princess]]''===
The new Princess Jasmine story takes place sometime after ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', where [[Iago]] and [[Cassim]] have returned to [[Agrabah]].

Jasmine is tired and bored of her usual princess duties; these include shop openings and helping to sell a camel in the local market place. During having her portrait painted as a "Peacock Princess", Jasmine loses patience and says she wants more responsibility. The Sultan gives her the job of "Royal Assistant Educator" at the Royal Academy. Jasmine is thrilled. However, this is soon changed once she meets her pupils. They run amok, draw on the walls, pillow fight, and throw books. She calls [[Rajah]] to try and scare the children into behaving, but they ignore him and chase Jasmine and Rajah into the mud and up a tree. Jasmine gives up. Her lady-in-waiting tells her later that night that all she needs is patience and perseverance, and she could do anything she wants. The next day. [[Hakeem]], the stable boy, seeks Jasmine's help. The Sultan's prized horse, [[Sahara]], is missing from the Stables. Jasmine takes it upon herself, with [[Carpet]], Abu, and Iago's help, to find Sahara and return him to the Palace.

==Trivia==
*While it is obvious that ''Keys to the Kingdom'' is set after the events of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', it is not quite certain when ''More Than A Peacock Princess'' takes place. Jasmine mentions that she can name all [[Forty Thieves]], implying that it takes place after ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', even though Iago left with [[Cassim]] at the end of the movie. It is possible that he came back after traveling with him to keep Jasmine company as she also mentions that [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]] and [[Genie]] are away. However, that can also easily set the story during the events of the [[Aladdin (TV series)|television series]].
*As of 2022, the film hasn't gotten a release on [[Disney+]] yet, hence marking the only Disney Princess film to date to remain unavailable on Disney+ streaming service.

==Errors ==
*After Iago says "Not quite" to Jasmine when she's singing ''More Than A Peacock Princess'', she takes off her costume. However, if you look at the balcony during the scene where the magic carpet flies down towards Jasmine and Iago, Jasmine's costume isn't there, and when Jasmine is shown flying away from the balcony, her costume is still not there.

==Reception==
[[Mary Costa]], the original voice of [[Aurora]], has been very open about her dissatisfaction of this film.<ref>https://www.dvdizzy.com/sleepingbeauty-interview2.html</ref>

==Voice Cast==
Because nearly five decades had passed since the original ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', a new cast of voice actors was used for the segment "Keys to the Kingdom". [[Mary Costa]], who provided the voice of [[Aurora]] in ''Sleeping Beauty'', was still alive at the time this film came out but was deemed too old to be able to produce the sweetness needed for the character, hence both [[Erin Torpey]] and Cassidy Laden instead were selected to take over as Aurora's speaking and singing voices respectively in that segment. 

Meanwhile for the segment "More than a Peacock Princess", in contrast, had almost all the voice actors from the original ''[[Aladdin]]'' film returning to reprise their roles, including [[Lea Salonga]], who reprises her role as [[Jasmine]]'s singing voice for the first time since the original ''Aladdin'' film, with the only exception being [[Jeff Bennett]] filling in the role of [[The Sultan]] in place of his previous voice actors [[Douglas Seale]] and [[Val Bettin]].
