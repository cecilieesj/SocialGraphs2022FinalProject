The concert toured cities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and Latin America.

''High School Musical: The Concert'' expanded the Disney Channel franchise that had previously produced a triple-platinum selling soundtrack and had planned a movie sequel. ([[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] already scored a success with another concert based on a TV musical, ''The Cheetah Girls'', which had a sold-out tour in 88 cities.)

The concert, which featured songs from the film, also included cast members [[Corbin Bleu]], [[Ashley Tisdale]], [[Lucas Grabeel]], [[Monique Coleman]], and [[Vanessa Hudgens]]. [[Zac Efron]] did not join the rest of the cast because he had to work on ''Hairspray''. Instead, Drew Seeley, who co-wrote "Get'cha Head in the Game" and sang as Troy in ''[[High School Musical]]'' the movie and soundtrack, joined the tour. [[Jordan Pruitt]] performed the show's opening act.

[[File:48356978 1246112792195662 6417631491932553216 n.jpg|thumb|220x220px|[[Vanessa Hudgens]] performing "When There Was Me and You" in Houston]]
* The concert typically ran two and a half hours (150 minutes).
* The concert CD/DVD came from a performance in Houston, Texas on December 18, 2006 at the Toyota Center. On May 1, 2007, it was released on both CD and [[DVD]] together.
* Kenny Ortega, the movie's director and choreographer, became the show's touring producer, creative director and director. On the night of the last concert, as seen on YouTube, the cast introduced him before singing one last chorus of "We're All in This Together".
* The live version of "Start of Something New" recorded at the Houston concert appeared in the ''Radio Disney Jams Vol. 9'' CD.
* In Mexico the release took place on April 30, 2007. In the US the release happened on May 1, 2007.
* The concert DVD features [[Jordan Pruitt]].
* The cast toured four countries in South America: Argentina, Chile, [[Brazil]] and Venezuela.
* The concert in São Paulo in [[Brazil]] aired [[Ashley Tisdale]]'s songs "Headstrong" and "We'll Be Together" ; as well as [[Vanessa Anne Hudgens|Vanessa Hudgens]]'s songs "Say OK" and "Let's Dance". In São Paulo High School Musical led more than 75,000 people on the concert".

* Vanessa Hudgens had a cold on the tour, resulting in her sounding flat and off-key in some sections of the concert album and DVD.
* On May 26, 2007, [[Disney Channel|Disney Channel Latin America]] showed the concert made in Buenos Aires in Argentina. This performance aired none of [[Ashley Tisdale]]'s songs, and [[Vanessa Anne Hudgens|Vanessa Hudgens]] only sang ''"Come Back To Me''".
* On June 9, 2007, Canal 13 showed the concert performed in Santiago, Chile, airing all the solo performances.
* On June 10, 2007 the concert filmed in Mexico City, [[Mexico]] aired on [[Disney Channel|Disney Channel Latin America]].
* Each of the singers had two microphones during the performances: a headset microphone with a flesh-colored pad on the tip, and a hand-held microphone.
* "Dance with Me" (from ''Cheetah Girls 2'', also directed by Kenny Ortega with choreography by Ortega and Charles Klapow) included an extended guitar solo which allowed [[Monique Coleman]] to feature in an extended tango number with both backup dancer Jared Murillo and Seeley. Murillo also choreographed "Dance with Me".
* While the CD and DVD were recorded at the same show, the two different formats feature slightly different edits, for example the when Lucas thanks the cast and crew at the end of "We're All in This Together", he says: "Houston you have been awesome" and thanks the band on the CD version whilst the DVD version skips straight into thanking the cast and dancers. He thanks Jordan Pruitt in real life, but on both the CD/DVD combo and the Extreme All-Access Pass DVD, he never does.
* Erin Lareau designed the costumes for the concert tour.
