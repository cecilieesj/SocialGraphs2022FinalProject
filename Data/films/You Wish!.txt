'''''You Wish!''''' is a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]], based on Jackie French Koller's [[1991]] novel ''If I Had One Wish''. It was directed by Paul Hoen; it stars A. J. Trauth, [[Spencer Breslin]], [[Lalaine]], and Tim Reid. It was released on [[January 10]], [[2003]], on the [[Disney Channel]].

==Plot==
Alex Lansing (A.J. Trauth) is tormented by his younger brother, Stevie ([[Spencer Breslin]]), such as buying a turkey from a pet adoption show and making jocks (Gary and his friends) slam a pizza on Alex's head. Most recently, though, Alex is forced to take Stevie to the mall with him and his friend, James. After Stevie receives a magical coin to wish anything, he runs off in the mall without telling Alex. Alex is grounded for a month because of carelessness with him and they are sent to bed. After Stevie gives Alex the coin, he wishes that he'd never had a little brother. 

The next day, he wakes up, only to find that his wish has come true. Stevie is now a spoiled child actor named Terrence Russell McCormack on a TV show called ''Where's Stevie?''. Although a cheerleader named Fiona is his girlfriend now and he is mostly popular in school, he soon regrets a few things. His new popular jock friends are now tormenting his other friends (Abby and James) and Fiona is revealed to be crude, mean, and have a bossy attitude. After a while, Alex began to miss Stevie because his parents, Dave and Pam, are career-obsessed, which makes him feel lonely at home. After being kicked out of Terrance's dressing room because Terrance thinks he's crazy when he tells him about him being Stevie, he reflects on his life with him and realizes how much he cares about him and misses him. As he walks home, Terrance drives by and decides to walk with Alex who he considers his friend despite thinking he's crazy. They escape from Terrance's driver, Ronald, and after realizing that this happened because of the coin, Terrance (who is convinced of the truth by Alex) set out to find the coin, enlisting the help of Abby who Alex convinces because of his different behavior. They locate Larry, the man who gave Stevie the coin, but he was injured without Stevie being there to save him, had to close his shop, and sell off the coin. After saying goodbye to Abby, Alex and Terrance are caught by the police and are taken to Alex's home where Terrance's caretaker comes to get him with the intention of covering up his running away. Terrance gets a call from his mother and is excited as he had the best night of his life, but quickly loses his excitement when learns that she is remarrying. Alex and Terrance share a brotherly hug, say goodbye, and Alex slips into a depression because he has no chance of returning to his world. 

The next day, while Alex is trying to find something on TV that doesn't remind him of his relationship with Stevie, Dave gives him a bunch of old coins he bought to try to cheer him up, but he throws them across the room, then discovers that one is the magic one. He gets it, but his shout of excitement frightens Dave and Pam due to his emotional state and they decide to break his door down when he won't open it. Before they can, he wishes that he never made the first wish and wakes up back in his own world with none of it having ever happened. He excitedly embraces Stevie, James, and Abby (who he realized he had feelings for while in the other world) while yelling to a passing Fiona that he's not her boyfriend. Later, he, James and Abby go skating, take Stevie with them, and try to teach him to do so. He gives up, but then uses the coin to become a great skater.
