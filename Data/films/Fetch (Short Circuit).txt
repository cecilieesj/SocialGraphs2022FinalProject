==Synopsis==
A child wants to play fetch with her pet. Unfortunately he’s wandered deep into an imposing forest.

== Plot ==
A little girl wanders towards the edge of a forest with a stick calling for Oliver. As she enters the woods, she naively searches far and wide for her missing pet while a giant black cloud creature with glowing blue eyes follows her. The girl continues to call, but receives no answer.

When the girl comes to a clearing, she loses a shoe and stops to place it back on as the creature zeroes in on her. The creature jumps from behind a tree and swoops up and swallows her whole. As the creature pauses to scratch itself in a dog-like manner, the girl calls from inside and comments on the junk he has eaten, revealing that the creature is Oliver.

The girl swims around inside before being ejected from Oliver's body with the stick she had at the beginning. She tosses it again and Oliver chases it with the girl following. Oliver comes back with a giant tree stump with the girl laughing at his mistake.
