==Trivia==
*Retitled ''[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]'' in 1994, featuring new graphics at the start and new end credits.
*The 1994 release features the same ink label for "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life]]", which was released around the same time.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Mary Poppins: Supercalifagilistico]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain.
*In earlier VHS prints, the sing-along for "Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum" is missing the blue G-clef graphic with the title. This is fixed in the laserdisc, DVD, and 1994 VHS prints.
*The "Everybody Has a Laughing Place" sing-along has a montage of various Disney characters laughing.
*The sing-along for "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" utilizes a new recording of the song, featuring the complete lyrics not present in the original featurettes, and with [[Paul Winchell]] reprising the role of [[Tigger]]. [[Jim Cummings]], during this time, had assumed the role beginning in season 3 of ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''.
*The 1994 print featured the gold WDHV logo (with blue background), replacing the 1986 Sorcerer Mickey WDHV logo, which was a video editing error, but was bothered not to be corrected, and it doesn't have the Sing-Along Songs promo at the end.
*In earlier VHS prints, the promo at the end of this program has listed this volume as Vol 8, which would later list this volume as Vol 9.
*This video does not feature a reprise of the title song(s).
*[[Ludwig Von Drake]]'s scenes are reused from ''[[The Hunting Instinct]]'', ''[[Carnival Time]]'', ''[[A Square Peg in a Round Hole]]'', ''[[Inside Donald Duck]]'', ''[[Kids is Kids]]'', ''[[Man is His Own Worst Enemy]]'', and ''[[The Truth About Mother Goose (Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color episode)|The Truth About Mother Goose]]''.
*Ludwig's daydream features reused animation from ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'' before segueing into the "Jolly Holiday" sequence.
