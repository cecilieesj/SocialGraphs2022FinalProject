'''''Santa's Workshop''''' is an animated [[Silly Symphonies]] short from [[1932]].

==Synopsis==
The short starts off with some elves cleaning Santa's Sleigh while singing. As their cleaning the sleigh one of the elves mentions that tomorrows Christmas Day. It then cuts to elves getting the reindeer ready for delivering presents. The camera then cuts to Santa opening and reading letters. The first letter he reads is a girl asking for a doll. Santa asks his elf to check the naughty list to see if the girl is on it. The girl isn't because she eats her spinach everyday. The second letter is a boy asking for several things. The elf checks the naughty list and finds that he is naughty because he hasn't washed behind his ears. Santa says he'll give him a bar of soap. The camera then shows several elves making toys. It also shows a summarized version of making a horse. 

The short then shows the making of dolls. <ref>This is where the infamous "mammy" doll scene occurs in certain versions of the short. In this part of the short an Asian racist stereotype is shown. </ref>It then shows Santa approving toys. After the toy approval is finished a march of toys occurs. All of the toys march into Santa's Sack where he carries them away. As Santa is carrying his sack into his sleigh several elves are cheering him on. Santa and his elves being to sing a goodbye song and the elves wish the audience a Merry Christmas Day. 

==Characters==
*[[Santa Claus]] (voiced by Allan Watson)
*Elves (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] and [[Walt Disney]])

==Censorship==
Mostly edited is Santa approving the dolls for shipping, including the last doll who is a black caricature that says "Mammy!". The uncut version was used in the 1982 print of ''[[A Walt Disney Christmas]]'', and on the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]: More Silly Symphonies'' DVD. The censored version, which does not feature the black doll, was used on the 1993 print of ''A Walt Disney Christmas'', the ''Disney Animation CollectionÂ Volume 7: [[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' DVD, and on [[Disney+]].

The Jewish stereotypes are also removed on occasion.

==Trivia==
*The ''Walt Disney Christmas'' VHS of this cartoon uses the burlap opening and closing titles. The original opening and closing titles were resorted for the cartoon's DVD release of ''Walt Disney Treasures: More Silly Symphonies''.
*The toys include various ethnic stereotypes, as well as one of famed film star Charlie Chaplain being chased by a cop. A Mickey Mouse toy is likewise seen in Santa's bag near the end.
