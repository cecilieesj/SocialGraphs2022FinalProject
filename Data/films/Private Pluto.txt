'''''Private Pluto''''' is a [[Pluto]] cartoon released on [[April 2]], [[1943]]. In this cartoon, Pluto is in the army and he gets antagonized by [[Chip and Dale]]. The cartoon marks the first appearance of Chip and Dale.

==Synopsis==
This short showcases Pluto as a soldier. Pluto is a guard dog on a military base. He's told there are saboteurs and is assigned to guard a pill-box (gun emplacement). First, Pluto tries to follow marching orders, contorting himself into quite a mess. Then, he engages in hijinks with Chip and Dale, who are using a cannon to store and crack their nuts, and a war of wits naturally ensues.
