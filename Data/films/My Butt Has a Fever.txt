'''''Bob's Burgers Presents: My Butt Has a Fever''''', or simply '''''My Butt Has a Fever''''', is a ''Bob's Burgers'' theatrical short film that was released by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. It was released exclusively at Alamo Drafthouse movie theaters playing before other new films on [[May 6]], [[2022]] (including ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''), leading up the release of ''[[The Bob's Burgers Movie]]''. It premiered on [[May 27]] on FXX as part of a Bob's Burgers marathon to coincide with the movie's release. It was also released on the Blu-ray of ''[[The Bob's Burgers Movie]]'' as a bonus feature, but was already released earlier on YouTube via the [[Hulu]] channel.

==Synopsis==
The short features all three Tina, Gene, and Louise singing a song called "My Butt Has a Fever."<ref>https://www.cbr.com/bobs-burgers-covid-19-canceled-short</ref>

==Plot==
Bob and Linda are at the restaurant commenting on a broken stool that was supposed to be fixed by Teddy, who has not shown up yet. They begin to wonder where the kids are when they hear a ringing. Linda realizes that it is her phone reminding her that they need to be at the school talent show for Tina, Gene and Louise and hastily leave. At the school, Mr. Frond prepares for the Belcher siblings' act, which on his chart is simply listed as "My [bleep] Has a [blank]" and reluctantly allows the children to go out and perform just as Bob and Linda arrive. Teddy hides under the stage just as the Belcher siblings begin their act, which Mr. Frond believes is a skit. However, when they burst into song with "My Butt Has a Fever", Mr. Frond becomes agitated and tries to stop the show, but Teddy stops him at every turn. Despite all this, the entire audience enjoys it and the school band and fellow acts join in on the fun. In typical fashion, Linda enjoys it while Bob is distracted at the fact that Teddy is even there. Sometime afterwards, the Belcher children are all in detention. They admit that it was "totally worth it" especially when Jimmy Jr. passes by the room and gives an approving nod towards Tina. Mr. Frond begins to hum their song, which Louise quickly catches him on.
