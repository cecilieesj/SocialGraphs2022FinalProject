'''''Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom''''' is an educational ''Adventures in Music'' animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions, and originally released to theaters by Buena Vista Film Distribution on [[November 10]], [[1953]]. This marks the very first animated short produced in [[wikipedia:CinemaScope|CinemaScope]]; showcasing many of its features very commonly (including stereophonic sound).

It features [[ Professor Owl]] discussing the study of musical instruments - the subject of the day. Mr. Owl tells the class (and the viewer), in rhyme, about all music that originates from four core sounds: toot (brass), whistle (woodwind), plunk (strings), and boom (percussion).

==Summary==
A History of music through the ages, from prehistoric man to the modern symphony orchestra.

==Characters==
*[[Bertie Birdbrain]] (voiced by [[Bill Thompson]])
*Canary Sisters
*[[Penelope Pinfeather]] (voiced by [[Loulie Jean Norman]])
*[[Professor Owl]] (voiced by Bill Thompson)
*Suzy Sparrow (voiced by [[Gloria Wood]])
*[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom (characters)|Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom]] (voiced by [[Jimmy MacDonald]])

==Legacy==
''Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom'' has been listed on Jerry Beck's ''50 Greatest Cartoons'' list, where, in a survey of numerous animation historians and people in the field, the short was voted the 29th best animated short.

Both of the ''Adventures in Music'' shorts found a long lasting legacy when footage was re-used for the interstitials of the ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]'' video series.

==Notes==
*In some television airings, including ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', the banjo scene was deleted due to apparently negative African-American stereotyping.
*One of the students is seen reading a [[Donald Duck]] comic book.
*An Academy ratio version of the short was also produced, with some slight differences, specifically removing some of the shots that took advantage of the wider screen.
*This was the first short to be distributed by Walt Disney's own Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Walt's contract with RKO ended after they refused to distribute the [[True-Life Adventures]] films.
