Chip 'n' Dale have filled a hollow tree with acorn nuts. Pluto sticks a bone into the tree, but this triggers an avalanche of nuts - right into Pluto's doghouse.

==''[[Have a Laugh!]]'' changes==
The following scenes were omitted from the short release due to time constraints:
*The opening scene of Chip and Dale gathering nuts and storing them in the tree and Pluto burying all but one of his bones in the ground; it opens with Pluto arriving to stow his remaining bone in the tree.
*Chip and Dale going into Pluto's doghouse, which is empty while the dog is absent, to retrieve their nuts, only to get on Pluto's collar when he returns.
*Dale playing around in one of the garden gloves before Chip gets his attention on Pluto's return.
*The chipmunks, hiding in the gloves, petting and patting Pluto, resulting in Dale getting trapped by Pluto briefly.
*Chip getting Pluto's attention by bouncing the ball before throwing it.
*The chipmunks inside the gloves discussing a plan to distract a confused Pluto.
*Dale rubbing the ground and grabbing the wooden stick.
*Pluto stopped short by his leash, attached to the doghouse, when he runs after the ball, followed by one of the chipmunks pulling the ball from his mouth to lure him into running after it.
*After throwing most of their nuts into the tree, one of the chipmunks tosses one last nut up to the other chipmunk who then puts it in.

==Trivia==
*In the beginning, Dale does an imitation of [[Donald Duck]]'s "fighting pose" after getting hit by Chip.
*A sped-up version of the [[Goofy]] holler is heard when Dale falls from the tree.
