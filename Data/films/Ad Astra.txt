In April 2017, whilst promoting ''The Lost City of Z'', Gray compared the story of Ad Astra to Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''. Gray also mentioned that he intended for the film to feature "the most realistic depiction of space travel that's been put in a movie and to basically say, 'Space is awfully hostile to us.'" Gray also confirmed that filming for ''Ad Astra'' would commence on July 17, 2017.

On April 10, 2017, James Gray confirmed that [[Brad Pitt]] would star in ''Ad Astra''. In June, Tommy Lee Jones joined the cast to portray Pitt's lost father. In August, Ruth Negga, John Finn, [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Jamie Kennedy]] joined the cast.

Principal photography on the film began in mid-August 2017 in Santa Clarita, California.

==Trivia==
*The name Ad Astra may come from the Latin Ad Astera (even though Astera is accusative singular for Astēr, which means "star" and is masculine). Thus, it means "to the star". The proper title is Ad Asterēs ("to the stars").
