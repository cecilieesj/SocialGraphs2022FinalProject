'''''Let's Go to the Circus!''''' is a Disney home video, originally released as part of the ''[[Mickey's Fun Songs]]'' series on [[April 22]], [[1994]], and then reissued as a ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]'' video in [[1996]].

==Description==
''Now, your kids can join Mickey and the gang in fun-filled musical adventures while learning easy-to-sing favorite kid songs! In Let's Go to the Circus!, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, and the Fun Songs Kids head to the Big Top to become a part of the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus! With elephants, lions, clowns and Mickey, it's really The Greatest Show on Earth!''

==Summary==
Mickey and the gang spend the day at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus exploring the show both on and off the stage.

==Plot==
The circus is coming to town, and everybody is so excited to see it. Mickey and his friends enter the big top lobby and meet David Larible, the clown captain, who invites them to a backstage tour. They see everything going on from zebras to jugglers to elephants. The circus' ringmaster, Eric Michael Gillett, enters and greets them, and Mickey warns the kids not to run off, but they leave to watch the performers rehearse and practice various circus tricks ("Rainbow World"). After that, Mickey leaves the guests and returns to the backstage. The kids enter the main circus ring. Eric welcomes the guests and introduces them to Mickey while Minnie, Goofy, Donald and the kids head into their seats. Mickey is pleased to see the audience, and then he blows his whistle to bring the amazing circus parade ("The Circus on Parade"). Later, acrobats show up and do various tricks and bounce up and down; they are joined by gymnasts ("Upside Down").

After that, a clown appears juggling his balls and then he throws them upward until he catches them again and one of the balls hits Donald Duck on the beak. Then, monkeys appear playing, dancing, climbing and having fun ("Aba Daba Honeymoon"), then they dance to "I Wan'na Be Like You". Another clown is seen balancing on a tightrope. Goofy tells the trapeze flyers that he will not give pixie dust so the flyer prepare themselves for the performance ("The Man on the Flying Trapeze"). A female spectator from the audience runs to the ring but David tells her to return to the seats, but the girl goes back to the ring and becomes a relaxing acrobat and she gets joined by the other acrobats ("Over and Over Again"). Mickey appreciates that act and Eric introduces the audience to "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" featuring the runners. And next the clowns who laugh, play, dance, juggle, and do funny things ("Make 'Em Laugh").

The next sequence is "The Bells" where people ring bells along with Donald and Goofy and they head to the spot where people appear after them dressed as clowns, but David tells them that they don't have to be clowns so Mickey and Eric wish everyone good luck for the next animal act, ("Animal Calypso"). Prior to the next act, the kids try to jump rope with the help of other kids who hold both sides of the rope. Goofy tells him to be careful, because he might fall. Later a bunch of kids get ready for the jump rope game. Then the jumping act starts ("Jump Rope").

Then, David arrives, calls the kids and leads them; and then he asks them if they want to be clowns and the kids agree. So they go to the makeup room and put on makeup, colorful wigs, face paint and costumes and head off. The kids are able to do their clown act ("Be a Clown"). The Disney characters (who are a part of the circus) appear for the conversation and the speech, and then they prepare for the finale ("Join the Circus").

==Trivia==
*This sing-along video marks the fifth live-action sing-along video.
*Christian Buenaventura, Tiffany Burton, [[Toby Ganger]], and Michelle Montoya all make returning appearances from the [[Campout at Walt Disney World|last ''Mickey's Fun Songs'' video]].
*Barry Manilow is reported to have composed the score for this video and wrote two original songs along with Bruce Sussman, but credited as written by Andy Belling and Domenick Allen.
*This sing-along video marks the first Disney live-action sing-along video that does not take place at a Disney theme park, even though the Disney Characters walk-arounds are shown.
*This sing-along video marks a crossover between Disney and the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
*Though not advertised as such, "The Bells" sequence involves a performance of the "[[Wikipedia:Theme from New York, New York|Theme from ''New York, New York'']]" on differently tuned bells by Goofy, Donald, Tiffany, Lucina Casartelli (David Larible's mother), and two other invited members of the crowd, supervised by David Larible (who rings a low-tuned bell once near the end of the sequence).
*The end credits show some behind-the-scenes stills such as Christian dressing up as a clown, Mickey and Minnie outside, Goofy lying on the floor, and a chimpanzee holding a paper plate. The end credits also show some deleted scenes that weren't seen in the actual video.
*In the late 1990s, Blockbuster Video released a triple-length VHS of the Sing-Alongs Series, available exclusively as a rental in their stores, and featured ''Let's Go to the Circus!'' on the cover. This videocassette contains the contents of the ''Let's Go to the Circus!'', ''Campout at Walt Disney World'', and ''Beach Party at Walt Disney World'' videos. It is also considered to be the rarest of all the Sing-Alongs releases, not being commercially sold in stores.
*The previews from this VHS are the same previews as ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs]]'': ''[[Campout at Walt Disney World]]'' and ''[[Beach Party at Walt Disney World]]'' 1996 VHS.
*Production for this video took place in 1993 during the 123rd edition of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
