The following is a list of Training films produced for the [[United States]] Army and Navy by the Walt Disney Studio during World War II. Most of these films were not sole productions of Disney, but were collaborations with other entities such as the First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) or Frank Capra's signal corps.

Disney only produced the animated portions of these films. It should also be noted that many Disney artists and animators (as well as artists from other animation studios) worked at FMPU simultaneously, so not all FMPU films that include animation are Disney products.

In many cases the studio did not receive credit, which has made the task of identification somewhat difficult. Additionally, many of these films were reissued and even retitled, re-numbered and even re-edited, so the original elements may not survive.

This list is the most complete that can be found on the Internet as the information comes from various sources such as the long out of print book ''Donald Duck Joins Up'' by Richard Shale and other film indexes that deal with Army and Navy films.
