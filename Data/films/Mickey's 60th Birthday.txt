'''''Mickey's 60th Birthday''''' is a [[1988]] television special broadcast as an episode of ''[[The Magical World of Disney]]'' on [[November 13]], [[1988]] on [[NBC]]. As the title suggests, it was produced for the 60th anniversary of [[Mickey Mouse]]. Not unlike ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (which had been recently released at the time), much of the footage featured in the film is live-action with newly-made animation (although some of the animation used for some scenes were made from existing footage). It was rebroadcast on [[Disney Channel]] Europe on November 13, [[2008]], to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the special and the 80th Anniversary of Mickey Mouse.

==Synopsis==
Mickey's 60th birthday show is being taped and as it is getting closer to the finale, Mickey finds himself trying to decide what he should do next for his audience. Rummaging through an old trunk, he finds the magic hat from ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' and considers using it. But he is warned by a [[the Sorcerer|sorcerer]] who owns the hat (who is not [[Yen Sid]] this time) that he should not be using other people's magic when he has his own, to which Mickey initially doesn't understand. With that in mind, Mickey goes out on stage along with his birthday cake, provided by [[Roger Rabbit]], who realizes too late that he mistakenly placed a stick of dynamite on the cake instead of a candle. Roger ends up destroying the set in a failed attempt to extinguish the dynamite fuse, which prompts Mickey to use the magic from the hat to repair the damage. The audience screams for more and Mickey agrees to do so, but when he does, he suddenly vanishes.

The Sorcerer, annoyed that Mickey disobeyed his warning, decides to teach the mouse a lesson on how to find his own kind of magic by casting a spell on him in which anyone he runs into fails to recognize him as Mickey Mouse. The Mouse is then returned to the real world, where he's found by Andy Keaton of ''{{WikipediaLink|Family Ties}}'', who mistakenly believes him to be a good impression of the real thing. Andy shows Mickey off to his sisters Mallory and Jennifer, but when they're not convinced, even his brother Andy turns him down. Dejected, Mickey goes to the bar from ''{{WikipediaLink|Cheers}}'', only to realize that he has no money to buy himself a drink. He then sings "Happy Birthday" to {{WikipediaLink|Rebecca Howe}}. When that doesn't make her happy, he then gives her a pep talk that cheers her up so much that she takes him out to dinner and a movie.

Meanwhile, [[The Walt Disney Company]] organizes a search party to find the missing mouse, which was reported on a local news show. In the process, the reporters, Dudley Goode and Mia Loud, begin to suspect [[Donald Duck]] after being told of how upset he was that he wasn't going to appear in Mickey's special. Their suspicions go even further when they find old footage of Donald doing his own version of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' [[Mickey Mouse Club March|theme song]], and Donald is soon arrested after he unsuccessfully tries to testify his innocence (he claimed that the kidnapper was either [[Minnie Mouse]], "[[Judge Doom|the guy who framed Roger Rabbit]]", the [[Theodora the Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]] or {{WikipediaLink|Porky Pig}}). Donald is to be represented by the legal firm of [[wikipedia:L.A. Law|McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney, and Kuzak]]. As they continue with their reports on the search, the reporters show various clip montages of Mickey and various tributes people were putting out to him.

As the special nears its end, Mickey returns to [[Disneyland]], where a custodian ([[Cheech Marin]]) mopes over the fact that he can't see any point in his profession if the guest of honor isn't going to show up for his own birthday party. {{WikipediaLink|Phylicia Rashad}} then sings a song called "Magic, It's All Up to You" with Mickey accompanying the ensuing song-and-dance number. At this point, the sorcerer reappears and congratulates Mickey now that he's finally found his own magic inside him having learned his lesson and thus breaks the spell. Just as the sorcerer exits, Roger rushes up to Mickey and instantly recognizes him. The news of Roger having "found" Mickey is brought to the news and the innocent Donald is released from jail just in time. Out of thanks and humility, Mickey invites Donald to join him in the forthcoming celebration at Disneyland.

==Notes==
*In Donald's version of "[[Mickey Mouse March|The Mickey Mouse March]]", when [[Jiminy Cricket]] tosses the cards spelling Donald's name into the air, the cards actually still have the letters in Mickey's name on them right before they reach the point where they freeze in midair.
*For the sequence where Mickey visits ''Cheers'', [[Michael Eisner]] contacted James Burrow and asked for the ''Cheers'' writers to write the scene, due to the first draft by Disney's own writers not being very good. After the ''Cheers'' writers revised the scene into what appears in the finished special, they later each received tote bags filled with Disney merchandise.<ref>[http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2010/02/night-mickey-mouse-entered-cheers.html "The night Mickey Mouse entered CHEEERS" blog post by ''Cheers'' writer Ken Levine]</ref>
*Mickey arrives at the ''Cheers'' bar on the evening of November 16th, and then shows up back at Disneyland before dawn on November 18th. In reality, driving from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] (where ''Cheers'' takes place) to Disneyland would take at least 44 hours, which is a much longer amount of time than what passes between the two sequences.
