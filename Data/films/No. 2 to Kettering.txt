==Synopsis==
On a dreary, ordinary morning, a girl learns how the power of laughter can lift even the most sullen among her fellow bus riders along their journey to Kettering.

==Plot==
A little girl gets on a bus on a very rainy day. While she is in color, everyone else is grey and drab. She attempts to mingle with the driver and the various passengers, but she gets very curt responses from them. Soon, she begins to lose her color and when she sees a small rattle and attempts to return it to a baby and his mother, she gets yelled at. The baby begins playing with the girl's hat and tears off the fluff on top of it. As she makes a noise with her mouth, the baby emulates this and begins to laugh, causing the mother to laugh. Soon everyone on the bus begins to laugh as color is brought back. Satisfied, the girl gets off and interacts with the driver again who this time gives a warm response.
