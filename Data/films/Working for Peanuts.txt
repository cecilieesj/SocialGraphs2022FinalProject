}}'''''Working for Peanuts''''' is a [[1953]] animated short starring [[Donald Duck]], [[Dolores the Elephant|Dolores]], and [[Chip and Dale|Chip 'n' Dale]] that was originally shown in 3D.

==Synopsis==
Chip and Dale discover a new source of food - peanuts - as long as they can get them away from an elephant named Dolores. Donald Duck, who works as a zookeeper, is responsible for feeding all animals, and constantly thwarts the pair's attempt to steal Dolores' food. Chip and Dale leave Dolores alone. After Chip has an idea and whispers something into Dale's ear, they finally fool Donald into giving them peanuts when they pour white paint on themselves and pretend they are the zoo's newest import, "Genuine Albino Chipmunks".
