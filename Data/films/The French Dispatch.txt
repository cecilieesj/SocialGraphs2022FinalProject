==Plot==
Arthur Howitzer Jr., the editor of the newspaper The French Dispatch, dies suddenly of a heart attack. According to the wishes expressed in his will, publication of the newspaper is immediately suspended following one final farewell issue, in which three articles from past editions of the paper are republished, along with an obituary.

'''The Concrete Masterpiece – by J.K.L. Berensen'''

Moses Rosenthaler, a mentally disturbed artist serving a prison sentence for murder, paints an abstract nude portrait of Simone, a prison officer with whom he develops a burgeoning relationship. Julien Cadazio, an art dealer also serving a sentence for tax evasion, is immediately taken by the painting after seeing it in a prisoner art exhibition, and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release he convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world, with his paintings in high demand. Privately, Rosenthaler struggles with inspiration, and devotes himself to a long-term project.

Three years later, Cadazio and a mob of artists, angry at the lack of any further paintings, bribe their way into the prison to force Rosenthaler to come up with something, and discover that he has painted a series of frescoes in the prison hall. Angered that the paintings are irremovable from the prison, Cadazio gets into a physical altercation with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire room to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum. For his actions in halting a prison riot that breaks out during the reveal of the paintings, Rosenthaler is released on probation.

'''Revisions to a Manifesto – by Lucinda Krementz'''

Lucinda Krementz reports on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the "Chessboard Revolution". Despite her insistence on maintaining "journalistic integrity", she has a brief romance with Zeffirelli, a self-styled leader of the revolt, and secretly helps him write his manifesto. A few weeks later, Zeffirelli is killed attempting repairs on a small radio tower serving as a revolutionary pirate radio station, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes symbolic of the movement.

'''The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner – by Roebuck Wright'''

During a television interview, Roebuck Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer-slash-chef Lt. Nescaffier. The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals. After a series of interrogations, the police discover the kidnapper's hideout and begin a stakeout. Following a shootout, Gigi manages to sneak out a message in Morse code to "send the cook". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout, ostensibly to provide both them and Gigi with food, but secretly the food is laced with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison, along with Lt. Nescaffier after being made to test it first, but one criminal escapes with Gigi, and leads the police on a chase. Gigi manages to escape out of the sunroof and jumps into the police car. At the French Dispatch office, Howitzer tells Wright to re-insert a segment in which a recovering Lt. Nescaffier tells Wright that the taste of the poison was unlike anything he had ever eaten before.

In an epilogue, the French Dispatch staff mourn Howitzer's death, but set to work putting together a final issue to honor his memory.
