==Synopsis==
''The Little Mermaid'' is the beloved story of [[Ariel]], a beautiful and spirited young [[Merpeople|mermaid]] with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of [[King Triton]]’s [[King Triton's Daughters|daughters]] and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing [[Prince Eric]]. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, [[Ursula]], which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.<ref name="PP">{{Cite web|url=https://assets.gettyimages.com/bf-boulder-whitelabelbucket-getty-prod/xjttq368ckqqn7gxbrbfwm/v/1069977247/original/THE%20LITTLE%20MERMAID%20Project%20Profile%2011.10.22.pdf|title=The Little Mermaid Project Profile}}</ref>
