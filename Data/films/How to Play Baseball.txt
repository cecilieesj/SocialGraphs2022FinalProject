'''''How to Play Baseball''''' is a [[1942]] ''[[Goofy]]'' cartoon directed by [[Jack Kinney]].

==Plot==
[[Goofy]] takes the time to demonstrate America's national pastime, then plays a game - one in which he plays all the bases. The short describes the basics of baseball in humorous terms; the equipment, uniforms, positions, and pitches, as well as the mannerisms of the players. It then switches to a game in progress, a deciding game in the World Series between the fictional Blue Sox and Gray Sox (possibly a parody of the real-life Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox). The Blue Sox are up three runs and working a no-hitter when the Grays rally in the bottom of the ninth. In a series of events the Grays load the bases, leading to a base clearing hit.

The game is tied, but the play at the plate is too close to call for the umpire, and it then ends in an argument. The narrator then concludes the short praising the values of what makes baseball America's sport.

==Characters==
*[[Goofy]]

==Notes==
*It was produced at the request of Samuel Goldwyn, and was first shown to accompany the 1942 feature film ''The Pride of the Yankees''.
*This is the first of Disney’s titled “How To” shorts starring [[Goofy]]. There were several earlier shorts with a similar format but this was the first to have "How To" in its title. It was followed by nine “How To” shorts in [[Walt Disney]]’s lifetime: ''[[How to Swim]]'' and ''[[How to Fish]]''; (both also in 1942); ''[[How to Be a Sailor]]'' and ''[[How to Play Golf]]'' (both [[1944]]); ''[[How to Ride a Horse]]'' (1941); ''[[How to Be a Detective]]'' ([[1952]]); and ''[[How to Sleep]]'' and ''[[How to Dance]]'' (both [[1953]]).
:*After Disney’s death, the studio produced ''[[How to Haunt a House]]'' ([[1999]]) and ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' ([[2007]]). Similarly-styled Goofy shorts that do not include the “How to” titling convention are ''[[Hockey Homicide]]'' ([[1945]]) and ''[[Motor Mania]]'' ([[1950]]). Prior to ''How to Play Baseball'', Disney had released two other "instructional" shorts starring Goofy: ''[[The Art of Skiing]]'' and ''[[The Art of Self Defense]]'' in November and December 1941, respectively.
