'''''Donald's Fire Survival Plan''''' is a [[1966]] educational animated short, which stars [[Donald Duck]] and focuses on fire safety. This short featured an introduction by [[Walt Disney]] about the importance of fire safety. An updated version of this short was released on [[August 1]], [[1984]].

==Plot==
===Summary===
Walt introduces the importance of fire prevention, stressing that more often than not, victims of the fire tend to be small children. Then he turns the film over to Donald Duck. His [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|nephews]] try to explain to their uncle the importance of fire prevention, but Donald doesn't pay any attention. He then falls asleep, after which he has a dream where his common sense shows to prevent fire in the home by using a bit of forethought, prevention, and a good escape plan. When Donald wakes up, he learns his mistake and goes to proceed with the fire prevention plan his nephews and his conscience told him about.

===1984 version===
The updated version was made by the Walt Disney Educational Media Company. It is shown mostly in live-action, with some animated scenes. All footage of Walt was removed, as was footage of Donald not in the dream sequence. Most footage of this footage was replaced by live actors assuming the roles of Donald and his nephews. Also, Donald's common sense was now voiced by [[Hal Smith]].
