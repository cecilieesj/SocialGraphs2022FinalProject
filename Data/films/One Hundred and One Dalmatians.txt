'''''One Hundred and One Dalmatians''''', also titled '''''101 Dalmatians''''', is a [[1961]] American animated comedy-adventure film produced by [[Walt Disney]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Dodie Smith]]. The 17th film in the [[Disney Animated Canon]], it was originally released to theaters on [[January 25]], 1961, distributed by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution|Buena Vista Distribution]].

The film stars [[Rod Taylor]] as the voice of [[Pongo]], Cate Bauer as the voice of [[Perdita]], and [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as the voice of the villainous [[Cruella De Vil]]. The plot centers on the fate of Pongo and Perdita's 15 Dalmatian puppies after they are 'dognapped' by the villainous Cruella De Vil who wants to kill them for their fur.

This is the second Disney animated feature film (the first film being ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', which took place in its release year [[1941]]) to take place in the time period it was made (late 1950s and early 1960s), as all other previous feature films (except ''Dumbo'') were either set in period pieces or in some kind of fantasy world with no specifically recognizable time period. Released on [[January 25]], [[1961]], this film was a major success, pulling the studio out of financial trouble, caused by the box office failure of the previous Disney animated feature film, [[Sleeping Beauty|''Sleeping Beauty'']], thanks to the use of {{WikipediaLink|xerography}} for the inexpensive animation. This was the first feature length animated film to use this process, although it was tested in ''Sleeping Beauty''.

==Plot==
[[Pongo]] is a Dalmatian that lives in a [[London]] bachelor flat with his 'pet' (owner), professional songwriter [[Roger Radcliffe]]. Bored with bachelor life, unlike Roger who spends his days writing music, Pongo decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself. While watching various female dog-human pairs out the window, he spots the perfect couple, a woman named [[Anita Radcliffe|Anita]] and her female Dalmatian, [[Perdita]] (or [[Perdita|Perdy]] for short) heading to [[Regents Park|Regent's Park]]. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. After an awkward and unusual meeting that goes awry, including having accidentally caused both Roger and Anita to fall into a pond, Pongo's plan pays off as they fall in love.

Six months after Roger and Anita (and Pongo and Perdita) get married, Perdita gives birth to an unexpectedly large litter of 15 puppies. One appears to be stillborn, but Roger is able to revive it by rubbing it in a towel (because of which, they name it "[[Lucky (101 Dalmatians)|Lucky]]"). That same night, they are visited by [[Cruella De Vil]], a psychotic and wealthy social parasite known to Anita from their school years. Having shown interest since a previous visit, she offers to buy the entire litter for a large sum, but Roger firmly asserts that the puppies are not for sale. Weeks later, refusing to take no for an answer, Cruella secretly hires two thieves named [[Jasper and Horace]] to dognap them all. The humans try every effort to locate the puppies, but to no avail. When Scotland Yard is unable to find them or prove Cruella stole them, Pongo and Perdita use the "Twilight Bark", normally a canine gossip line, to alert and ask for help from the other dogs in London to locate them. The first two to answer the call are the [[Danny (101 Dalmatians)|Great Dane]] and his [[Scottie|terrier friend]] of [[London|Hampstead]]. Soon, the alert is spread all over [[England]].

The message reaches the English countryside at Suffolk, where an old hound named [[Towser]] receives the message, along with [[Lucy]] the goose. Towser then sends the message to the barn, where the [[Colonel]], an old sheepdog, resides, along with his compatriots [[Captain]], a retired gray cavalry horse, and [[Sergeant Tibbs]], a tabby cat. The Colonel and Tibbs find the puppies in a place called [[Hell Hall]] (aka The De Vil Place), along with others that Cruella had legally purchased from various dog stores. After Tibbs narrowly escapes from the Baduns, the word about the stolen puppies is quickly sent back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita immediately leave the British capital to retrieve their puppies. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella's plan to have the puppies be made into dog-skin fur coats and her ordering Jasper and Horace to kill and skin them that very night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them himself while Jasper and Horace are watching the television, but they finish their show and come for them before Tibbs can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita burst through a window just as Jasper and Horace have cornered them and are about to kill them. During a vicious scuffle, Horace is knocked into the lit fireplace and Jasper gets his pants pulled down by the incensed parents before both cause the ceiling to cave in on them, while Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house to their barn.

After a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are 84 others with them in Cruella's possession. Shocked after learning of her plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt them all, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. They begin making their way back to London, aided by other animals along the way; including a [[Collie]] and some cows who give them shelter and food. However, Cruella, Jasper, and Horace are in hot pursuit of them and will stop at nothing to catch them. The Dalmatians arrive in Dinsford where they are assisted by a black [[Labrador]] retriever. However, before the Dalmatians can get sneak into a van that is bound for London, Cruella, Jasper, and Horace arrive searching for them. In order to try and fool them, the Dalmatians cover themselves with soot so they appear to be black Labrador retrievers.

The ruse works and the family successfully get inside the van. However, while Pongo and Perdy are loading the last few puppies in, ice drips down and washes off the soot. Cruella spots the disguise and sets off after the van. Jasper and Horace in [[Jasper and Horace's truck|their truck]] and Cruella in [[Cruella's car|her car]], and in a maniacal rage, follow the van with the dogs inside. Cruella repeatedly attempts to ram it off the road and a cliff (promptly damaging her car in the process), while Jasper and Horace attempt to cut it off from another direction by crashing into it. Jasper almost succeeds in crashing into the van, but just as he is about to do so, a panicked Horace accidentally rips the steering wheel from the truck's dashboard, causing the vehicle to swerve out of control. Because of this, they end up colliding with Cruella and her car, sending both vehicles crashing into a deep ravine. Comically, they are shown to be well among the wreckage of their demolished vehicles. As Cruella screams in anger and frustration and berates Jasper (who finally stands up to her) and Horace for ruining everything, she begins weeping over the loss of both her car and her dream coat, as the van drives away.

Back in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and Roger's first big hit, a rather unflattering song about Cruella, but they miss their canine friends. Suddenly, barking is heard outside and after [[Nanny|their nanny]] opens the door, the house is filled with dogs. After wiping away more of the soot, they are delighted to realize the Dalmatian clan has returned home. They decide to use the money from the song to buy a large house in the country so they can keep all 101 Dalmatians.

==Production==
The film is a landmark in animation history for many reasons. It was the first one created by a single story man ([[Bill Peet]]).<ref name="thomas">Thomas, Bob: "Chapter 7: The Postwar Films", page 106. ''Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules'', 1997</ref>

===Graphic reproduction===
The production of the film also signaled a change in the graphic style of Disney's animation. [[Ub Iwerks]], in charge of special processes at the studio, had been experimenting with Xero photography to aid in animation.<ref name="finch">Finch, Christopher: "Chapter 8: Interruptions and Innovations", pages 245-246. ''The Art of Walt Disney'', 2004</ref> By 1959 he had modified a Xerox camera to transfer drawings by animators directly to cels, eliminating the inking process and preserving the spontaneity of the penciled elements.<ref name="thomas" /><ref name="finch" />

The introduction of {{WikipediaLink|xerography}} eased graphic reproduction requirements, but at the price of being unable to deviate from a scratchy outline style because of the new (and time and money saving) technology's limitations.<ref name="finch" /> Since the line would not have fit the "round" Disney drawing style used until then (with the exception of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''), a more graphic, angular style was chosen for this and subsequent films. Rotoscoping, a technique formerly used for tracing live-action human characters into animated drawings, became less important.

Another reason for its look was that the animators were used to producing sketchy drawings, as the clean-up was done in the process of transferring the drawings to the cells. With the hand inkers gone, the animation remained as the animators drew it. Later it became common to do clean-up on paper before the animation was copied, and with time and experience, the process improved.

According to Chuck Jones, Disney was able to bring the movie in for about half of what it would have cost if they'd had to animate all the dogs and spots.<ref>http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/Jones/interview_chuck_jones.htm An Interview with Chuck Jones</ref>

The studio cut its animation department after the failure of the very expensive ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', resulting in a reduction of staff from over 500 to less than 100. [[Walt Disney]], who for some years had spent his attention more towards television and his Disneyland amusement park and less on his animated features, disliked this development. The "sketchy" graphic style would remain the norm at Disney for years until the technology improved prior to the release of ''[[The Rescuers]]''. In later animated features, the Xeroxed lines could be printed in different colors.

Unlike many Walt Disney animated features, the film features only three songs, with just one, "[[Cruella De Vil (song)|Cruella De Vil]]", playing a big part in it The other two songs are "[[Kanine Krunchies]]" (sung by [[Lucille Bliss]], who voiced [[Anastasia Tremaine]] in Disney's ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), and "[[Dalmatian Plantation]]" in which only two lines are sung by Roger at the end. Songwriter Mel Leven had, in fact, written several additional songs for the film including "Don't Buy a Parrot from a Sailor", a cockney chant, meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at Hell Hall, and "March of the One Hundred and One", which the dogs were meant to sing after escaping Cruella by van.

To achieve the spotted Dalmatians, the animators used to think of the spot pattern as a constellation. Once they had one "anchor spot", the next was placed in relation to that one spot, and so on and so on until the full pattern was achieved.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Disney Animation</ref> All total, the film featured 6,469,952 spots, with Pongo sporting 72 spots, Perdita 68, and each puppy having 32.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021161730/http://americanroyalarts.com/catalog_search.php?p=1&id_nivel3=100&cat=1&id_sub=0&id_nivel_padre=1 http://americanroyalarts.com/catalog_search.php?p=1&id_nivel3=100&cat=1&id_sub=0&id_nivel_padre=1] 101 Dalmatians Original Animation Forensically Examined</ref>

===Live-action reference===
As done with other Disney films, Walt Disney hired an actress to perform live-action scenes as a reference for the animation process. Actress Helene Stanley performed the live-action reference for the character of Anita. She did the same kind of work for the characters of [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]] in [[Cinderella (1950 film)|the title movie]] and [[Aurora]] in ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Cinderella Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030803224356/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html|archivedate = August 3 2003}}</ref>

According to Christopher Finch, author of ''The Art of Walt Disney'': "Disney insisted that all scenes involving human characters should be shot first in live-action to determine that they would work before the expensive business of animation was permitted to start. The animators did not like this way of working, feeling it detracted from their ability to create character. The animators understood the necessity for this approach and in retrospect acknowledged that Disney had handled things with considerable subtlety."

This film did receive some negative criticism. Phillip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette only gave the film 2/5 stars. In 2011 Craig Berman of MSNBC ranked it and its 1996 remake as two of the worst kid films of all-time saying, "The plot itself is a bit nutty. Making a coat out of dogs? Who does that? But worse than Cruella de Vil’s fashion sense is the fact that your children will definitely start asking for a Dalmatian of their own for their next birthday."

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of the critics gave it a positive review based on 37 reviews.

===Sequels and spin-offs===
In the years since the original release of the film, Disney has taken the property in various directions. The earliest of these endeavors was the live-action remake, ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' starring [[Glenn Close]] as Cruella De Vil. None of the animals talked in it. Its success in theaters led to ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'', released on November 22, 2000.

After the first live-action version of the film, a cartoon called ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' was launched. The designs of the characters were stylized further, to allow for economic animation, and appeal to the contemporary trends.

''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]'', the official sequel to the original animated film, was released straight-to-VHS/DVD on January 21, 2003.

More recently, Lucky and Freckles starred in several shorts on [[Disney Junior]].

In [[2019]], a second animated series was produced, ''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'', that serves as a continuation of the original animated film involving the adventures of the modern day descendants of Pongo and Perdita and their step-siblings in modern day London.

''[[Cruella]]'', a live-action prequel starring [[Emma Stone]] as Cruella De Vil, was released on May 28, 2021.
