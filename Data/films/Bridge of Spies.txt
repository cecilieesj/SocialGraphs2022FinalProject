A positive review came from Steve Pulaski of Influx Magazine, who gave the film a B and stated that the more meditative structure of the film "blended with some great, subtle period cinematography and a strong Hanks performance [makes] a fascinating adult drama that, while not as layered as it could be, is an enriching experience." The A.V. Club's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky described it as "one of the most handsome movies of Spielberg’s latter-day phase, and possibly the most eloquent...Bridge Of Spies turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often disarmingly funny cat-and-mouse game," concluding: "An ode to holding fast to moral principles, geopolitics be damned, becomes a hurrah for old-fashioned big-screen storytelling."
