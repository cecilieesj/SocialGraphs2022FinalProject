'''''Onward''''' is a [[2020]] American computer-animated urban fantasy film produced by [[Pixar Animation Studios]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney&nbsp;Pictures]]. The film is directed by [[Dan Scanlon]], produced by [[Kori Rae]] from a screenplay written by Scanlon, Jason Headley, and Keith Bunin, and stars the voices of [[Tom Holland]], [[Chris Pratt]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and [[Octavia Spencer]]. Set in a suburban fantasy world, the film follows two elf brothers who set out on a quest to find an artifact that will temporarily bring back their deceased father.

The film premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival on [[February 21]], 2020 and was released in the [[United States]] on [[March 6]], 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/14/pixar-suburban-fantasy-dan-scanlon/|title=Pixar announces new original ''suburban fantasy'' movie|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=December 12, 2018}}</ref> Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, the film has only grossed $131 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings when compared to other Pixar films were largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread closure of movie theaters, thus making it Pixar's second box-office disappointment after ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''. Like several other films released in the early months of 2020, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical opening.

==Synopsis==
The film takes place in a universe where humans don't exist; therefore, the world is instead populated by mythical creatures, including elves, gnomes, goblins, manticores, and unicorns. In the beginning, they used magic as their most important resource. But since it was very difficult to master, the world found a simpler way to live and abandoned the use of magic. In the present day, brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot are bestowed a wizard staff from their deceased father on Ian's 16th birthday, where a spell can bring their father back to life for a day. But when the brothers lose control over the staff when summoning their father, they only end up bringing the bottom part back of him. With the help of their mother, the fearless manticore restauranteur Corey, and half of their toe-tapping father, the two brothers try to find a little magic left in the world within twenty-four hours.

==Plot==
In a world inhabited by mythical creatures, magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.

In a time equivalent to the modern day, [[Ian Lightfoot]], an elf high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother, [[Barley Lightfoot|Barley]], a history and role-playing game fanatic, live in the city of [[New Mushroomton]]. Their father, [[Wilden Lightfoot|Wilden]] died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother, [[Laurel Lightfoot|Laurel]] has a new boyfriend, centaur police officer [[Colt Bronco]], which both Ian and Barley disapprove of.

On Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a "visitation spell" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley’s beloved van "[[Guinevere (car)|Guinevere]]". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.

In search of a map to the gem, Ian and Barley visit the [[Manticore's Tavern]], a family restaurant managed by the Manticore, [[Corey the Manticore|Corey]]. Arguing with Ian over the map, Corey drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting "Raven's Point", a nearby mountain. Laurel later befriends Corey, who warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse which can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a pawn shop.

Traveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a motorcycle gang of sprites, relying on Ian's new spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game tricks. "Raven's Point" leads them on a trail marked by a series of raven statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures surfacing in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild-goose chase and walks away with Wilden after he goes as far as to calling Barley a screwup and for ruining his chance to have the ''one'' thing he never had.

Rereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, triggering the curse, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. Corey flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.

Ian's confidence and spell-casting improve, and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, "Guinevere the Second". Corey reopens her tavern, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.

==Development==
Onward was first announced at the [[2017]] D23 Expo as "The Untitled Pixar Film That Takes You Into A Suburban Fantasy World" and was described as a story about two brothers seeking to reconnect with their late father set in a human-free world of elves, sprites, trolls, dragons and "anything else that would be painted on the side of a van in the 1970s", with unicorns being depicted as common pests and dragons are pets.

On [[December 12]], [[2018]], it was announced that the film would be called ''Onward'' and would also be based on Dan's relationship with his brother. It was announced that Scanlon would co-wrote the screenplay with ''[[Zootopia]]'' and ''[[Moana (film)|Moana]]'' animator, C.S. Anderson.<ref>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/pixar-moves-forward-with-suburban-fantasy-film-onward-cast-includes-chris-pratt-tom-holland</ref> The film's [[Onward (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was released on [[February 28]], [[2020]], in CD, digital, and vinyl formats.

''Onward'' was released on digital on the night of [[March 20]], [[2020]] and became available for [[Disney+]] subscribers on [[April 3]], 2020 in the [[United States]]. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray & 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on [[May 19]], [[2020]]. The announcement followed Disney's earlier than planned release of ''[[Frozen II]]'' on Disney+ due to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/onward-digital-release-disney-plus-details/ |title=Pixar’s ‘Onward’ Is Getting an Early Digital and Disney+ Release |website=Collider |last=Gemmill |first=Allie|date=March 20, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Lawsuit==
In January 2020, San Francisco tattoo artist Sweet Cecily Daniher filed a copyright lawsuit against Disney, Pixar, and ''Onward'' producer Kori Rae. In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's "Vanicorn", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Visual Artists Rights Act, and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 334 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "It may suffer in comparison to Pixar's classics, but ''Onward'' makes effective use of the studio's formula -- and stands on its own merits as a funny, heartwarming, dazzlingly animated adventure." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale (tied with ''[[Cars 2]]'' for the lowest score received by a Pixar film), and PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Peter Bradshaw of ''The Guardian'' rated the film three out of five stars, and called it "a likable family comedy that finds an easy rhythm without effort," though he felt that the movie's "attitude towards death" is not as radically powerful as in ''[[Coco]]''. In a same star review Peter Travers of ''Rolling Stone'' said "It's no ''Toy Story''—but the animation juggernaut's latest, about two elf brothers on a quest, is still worth your while." Reviewer James Berardinelli praised the film's originality and emotional weight and called it "engaging and enjoyable," adding "there’s something here for everyone," though concluded it is not the next Disney/Pixar classic. Ben Travis of ''Empire Magazine'' gave the film five out of five stars, and wrote, "Pixar returns with a great big power-chord of a movie—heart-pumping, resonant, and positively harmonious."

Richard Roeper of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' called ''Onward'' a step back for Pixar, giving it two out of four stars. He said, "The story fluctuates between the uninspired and the just plain weird and then gets even weirder." While he praised the animation and said that the movie "begins with an intriguing premise," he concluded that it "doesn't come close to fully fleshing out the possibilities."

==Trivia==

===Controversy and censorship===
Specter revealing that she had a girlfriend led to complaints from parents as well as Christian organizations and parent groups. Also, the film experienced some international censorship. It was banned in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar, but still released in other Arab countries like Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, albeit the line was censored in the Arabic dub to "my <u>sister's daughter</u>". In [[Russia]], where [[Wikipedia:Russian gay propaganda law|a law prohibits the dissemination of LGBT content to under-18s]], the Russian dub censored Specter's line to "my <u>partner's daughter</u>" and avoided referring to her with gender-specific pronouns. The line was also censored in the Albanian, Hungarian and Polish dubs, too.
