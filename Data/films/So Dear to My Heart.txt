}}'''''So Dear to My Heart''''' is a feature film produced by [[Walt Disney]], released in [[Chicago]] on [[November 29]], [[1948]] and released generally on [[January 19]], [[1949]] by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. Like [[1946]]'s ''[[Song of the South]]'', it combines animation and live action. It is based on the Sterling North book ''Midnight and Jeremiah''.

Set in early 20th century Indiana (in 1903), the film tells the tale of Jeremiah Kincaid ([[Bobby Driscoll]]) and his quest to raise his "champion" lamb, [[Danny (So Dear to My Heart)|Danny]] (named for the famed race horse, Dan Patch, who is also portrayed in the film). Jeremiah's dream of showing Danny at the Pike County Fair must overcome the obstinate objections of his loving, yet strict, grandmother, Granny Kincaid (Beulah Bondi). Jeremiah's confidant Uncle Hiram (Burl Ives) is his steady ally.

The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song for "[[Lavender Blue (Dilly, Dilly)]]", but lost against "Baby, It's Cold Outside" from 1949's ''Neptune's Daughter'', which came the same year.

==Plot==
Set in Indiana in 1903, the film tells the tale of Jeremiah Kincaid (Bobby Driscoll) and his determination to raise a black-wool lamb that had been rejected by its mother. Jeremiah names the lamb Danny for the famed race horse, Dan Patch (who is also portrayed in the film). Jeremiah's dream of showing Danny at the Pike County Fair must overcome the obstinate objections of his loving—yet tough—grandmother Granny (Beulah Bondi). Jeremiah's confidant, Uncle Hiram (Burl Ives), is the boy's steady ally. Inspired by the animated figures and stories, the boy perseveres.
