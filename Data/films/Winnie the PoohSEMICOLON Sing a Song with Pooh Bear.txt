''Step into the wonderfully whimsical world of the Hundred Acre Wood and Sing a Song with Pooh Bear. It's a typical once-upon-a-time kind of day and Pooh is missing something - his very own song! Accompanied by all his friends, he searches for his song, and, along the way, discovers a bounty of other songs as well. Like a hunny pot brimming over Pooh's favorite treat, his very first sing along musical overflows with charming new songs and collection of all-time favorites from classic Pooh movies.''

==Trivia==
*DVD released in April [[2003]] as ''Sing a Song with Pooh Bear & Piglet Too!'', to coincide with the theatrical release of ''[[Piglet's Big Movie]]''.
*"Winnie the Pooh", "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" and "Heffalumps and Woozles" were used respectively on three ''[[Disney's Sing Along Songs]]'' videos: ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: The Bare Necessities|The Bare Necessities]]'', ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!]]'', and ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Be Our Guest|Be Our Guest]]'', and are updated with new lyrics and additional orchestration by Andy Belling. "Winnie the Pooh" reuses the sequence of Pooh walking on the lyrics, "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" has almost the entire montage replaced with clips from ''The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'', but still keeps Paul Winchell's vocals, and the "Heffalumps and Woozles" sequence is used in its entirety unlike ''Be Our Guest''.
*Originally released as ''Winnie-the-Pooh: Sing a Song with Pooh Bear'', later re-issued in the ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs|Sing-Along Songs]]'' series under a new name with new songs. Also released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] but only the original home video release.
*The beginning of the 1999 release features a computer-animated tour of [[Christopher Robin]]'s [[Christopher Robin's Room|bedroom]] showing his stuffed toys. This opening would appear again in ''[[Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving|Seasons of Giving]]'' and ''[[Sing a Song with Tigger]]''.
*Featured at the end of the 1999 video, [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] hosts "How to Draw" as he shows you how to draw [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]]'s face. It was also featured as the last chapter of the main feature on the DVD release.
*The [[Spain|Spanish]] version (which is of ''Sing a Song with Pooh Bear'') is a bonus feature for the DVD release of ''Sing a Song with Pooh Bear & Piglet Too''. Instead of narration, it is just the songs fading in when the song began and out to black when the song ended. Some of the dialogue is still there. In Spanish, it is known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Canta Con Nosotros: Canta Una Cancion Con Wini Pu]]''.
*This sing-along is one of few to have an actual storyline (in this case, Pooh trying to find his song). Various scenes of Pooh media (such as those of ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' (using episodes such as ''[[Where, Oh Where Has My Piglet Gone?]]'' and ''[[Donkey for a Day]]'') and ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'') were used with the introductions, along with redubbed dialogue.
*In the 2003 release, the intro for "[[My Song]]" was shortened from the original version in which a few of the scenes that were removed were placed for the intros of the added songs with new dialogue. The narrator's dialogue from the 1999 release of "My Song" was completely changed in the 2003 version's release.
*Though the revised version was released in 2003, the credits say 2002, which indicates that it was completed that year. Certain parts of ''Piglet's Big Movie'' were completed in time to be used in that version as well.
*The end credits use the same background as the end of ''The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening theme.
