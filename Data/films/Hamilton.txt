==Synopsis==
<em>Hamilton</em> is the story of the unlikely Founding Father determined to make his mark on the new nation as hungry and ambitious as he is. From bastard orphan to Washington’s right-hand man, rebel to war hero, a loving husband caught in the country’s first sex scandal, to the Treasury head who made an untrusting world believe in the American economy. George Washington, Eliza Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and Hamilton’s lifelong friend/foil Aaron Burr all make their mark in this astonishing new musical exploration of a political mastermind.

==Trivia==
*This is the first Disney+ original film to receive a PG-13 rating by the MPA; unlike all of the previous Disney+ original films, which were either rated G or PG.
**Thus, it is also Disney's first non-theatrical film to be designated that rating; all of the previous Walt Disney Pictures films designated that rating were theatrical.
**Regarding the profanity in the show, Miranda said on Twitter that most instances of f-bombs are censored, with the exception of "Say No to This", which is left intact (even though in the song, the first two letters of the word are said and is left unfinished) with quote "That was my wife you decided to -. Miranda said he was allowed only one f-bomb to qualify for a PG-13 rating and a second use is automatic R rating,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1275146945183580162|title=Miranda statement on F-bombs in the film|work=Twitter|first=Lin-Manuel|last=Miranda|date=June 22, 2020|accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref> adding, jokingly, "I literally gave two f**ks so the kids could see it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1275146947096174595|title=Miranda statement continued|first=Lin-Manuel|last=Miranda|work=Twitter|date=June 22, 2020}}</ref> It was repeated later in "We Know" where Jefferson subs it with "WHAAAAT!"
**The first profanity is in "Yorktown" Which it was uttered by Hercules Mulligan.
**The second profanity of the musical is the song "Washington on your side" at the part where Jefferson and Madison said "Southern motherf*ckin' Democratic Republicans!" but instead it used record scratch.
**The third profanity could be used is seen in "The Adams Administration" since Hamilton said "Sit down John you fat Mother--" then drops the books. Resorting to Burr, Jefferson and Madison to team up against Hamilton.
*[[Jonathan Groff]] had already left the show by the time of filming, but returned especially for the shoot.
*This is the second Disney+ original film not to use the Disney+ Original logo after ''[[Artemis Fowl]], due to being slated for a theatrical release.''
*The opening logo for this movie is very similar to the 2011 logo, however different music plays and not immediately. The fireworks are timed to the music and so is the glowing arc. In the opening and closing logos, the sparkle sounds that play during and after the arc forming are not present.
*This was slated as the "most adult" media on Disney+ before The Beatles Get Back was released.
*The opening logo is the tune to "The Ten Duel Commandments." With reminders from King George III
