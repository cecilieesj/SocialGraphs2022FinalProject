The film follows a group of blue-collar deep-core drillers sent by NASA to stop and deflect a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with Earth. It features an ensemble cast including [[Bruce Willis]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Owen Wilson]], Will Patton, [[Peter Stormare]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Keith David]], and [[Steve Buscemi]].

''Armageddon'' opened in theaters only two-and-a-half months after a similar impact-based movie, ''Deep Impact'', which starred Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman. ''Armageddon'' fared better at the box office; astronomers described ''Deep Impact'' as being more scientifically accurate. Both films were equally received by film critics. ''Armageddon'' was an international box-office success, despite generally mixed reviews from critics. It became the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide surpassing the Steven Spielberg war epic, ''Saving Private Ryan''.

==Plot==
A massive meteor shower destroys the orbiting Space Shuttle Atlantis, enters the atmosphere and bombards New York City, the East Coast, and Finland. NASA discovers that the meteoroids came from a parent body asteroid with a Texas-sized surface, and that another impact on Earth will occur in 18 days, starting another extinction event, and eventually a 6-mile wide asteroid will impact into the Pacific Ocean and wipe out most life on the planet. NASA scientists, led by Dan Truman (Thornton) plan to drill a shaft into the asteroids' surface of at least 800 ft. (243 m) deep, and plant a H-bomb device into it which, when detonated, will split the asteroid in two, driving the halves apart so that they both will fly safely past the Earth. NASA contacts Harry Stamper (Willis), considered the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for assistance and advice. Harry returns to NASA along with his daughter Grace (Tyler) to keep her away from her new boyfriend, one of Harry's young and rambunctious drillers, A.J. Frost (Affleck). Harry and Grace learn about the asteroid and Harry explains he will need his team, including A.J., to carry out the mission. Once they have been rounded up and the situation is explained, they agree to help, but only after their list of unusual rewards and demands are met.

As NASA puts Harry and his crew through a short and rigorous 12-day astronaut training program at Johnson Space Center, Harry and his team re-outfit the mobile drillers, named the "Armadillos", that will be used on the asteroid. When a meteorite from the asteroid wipes out the coastal area of Shanghai, NASA and other space agencies are forced to reveal their plans to the world before Harry and his crew go to Florida for training revisions and last-minute preparations. Afterwards, two of the latest Space Shuttles, named Freedom and Independence, are launched from Cape Canaveral. Once in orbit, the shuttles dock with the new 11-year old modified Russian space station Mir manned by Lev Andropov (Stormare) to refuel. A fire breaks out during the transfer and the station is evacuated just before it explodes, with Lev and A. J. making a narrow escape. After 60 hours, the shuttles slingshot around the Moon at a maximum speed of 22.500 miles per hour in order to land on the backside of the asteroid. Traveling through the asteroid's debris field Independence's hull is punctured and crashes onto the rock. Grace, watching from NASA headquarters, is distraught by A.J.'s apparent death.

Freedom lands safely, but misses the target area, so the team must now drill through a 50 ft. thick crust of compressed iron ferrite rather than the planned softer stone, but still on the fault line parallel with the asteroids' course. When they fall significantly behind schedule and communications are about to fail after one and a half hour, the military initiates "Secondary Protocol"; to remote detonate the weapon on the asteroid's surface, which apparently will not have any effect. While Truman delays the military at Mission Control, Harry persuades the shuttle commander to disarm the bomb so they can complete the drilling.

Distracted by "Rockhound" (Buscemi), who is having a mental breakdown, the Freedom crew loses their Armadillo and another crew member when it strikes a methane gas pocket and is blown into space. Worldwide panic ensues as the mission is assumed lost and martial law is declared to evacuate people to underground shelters, just as another meteorite destroys most of Paris. Suddenly, A.J., Lev, and "Bear" (Duncan), having survived the Independence crash, arrive in the Independence's Armadillo in time to complete the drilling.

As the asteroid approaches the Earth, it heats up, causing a dangerous rock storm that damages the bomb's remote trigger and kills munition specialist Gruber. They realize that someone must stay behind to detonate it manually. After all the non-flight crew volunteers, they draw straws, and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside, telling him that he is the son he never had and he would be proud to have him marry Grace. Harry prepares to detonate the bomb and contacts Grace to say his last goodbyes. After the Freedom moves to a safe distance, Harry pushes the button at the last second (after some difficulty) and his life passes before his eyes as the asteroid is destroyed. It breaks in two and both halves fly past the Earth. Freedom lands, and the surviving crew are treated as heroes. The film ends with A.J. and Grace's wedding, complete with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present in memoriam.

==Production==
In May 1998, Disney chairman Joe Roth expanded the film's budget by $3 million to include additional special effects scenes. This additional footage, incorporated two months prior to the film's release, was specifically added for the television advertising campaign to differentiate the film from Deep Impact which was released a few months before.

==Release==
Prior to ''Armageddon''<nowiki/>'s release, the film was advertised in Super Bowl XXXII at a cost of $2.6 million.

==Theatrical run==
''Armageddon'' was released on July 1, 1998 in 3,127 theaters in the United States and Canada. It ranked first at the box office with an opening weekend gross of $36 million. It grossed $201.6 million in the United States and Canada and $352.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $553.7 million.

==Home media==
Despite the general critical disdain, a DVD edition of ''Armageddon'' was released by The Criterion Collection, a specialist film distributor of primarily arthouse films that markets what it considers to be "important classic and contemporary films" and "cinema at its finest". In an essay supporting the selection of Armageddon, film scholar Jeanine Basinger, who taught Michael Bay at Wesleyan University, states that the film is "a work of art by a cutting-edge artist who is a master of movement, light, color, and shape—and also of chaos, razzle-dazzle, and explosion". She sees it as a celebration of working men: "This film makes these ordinary men noble, lifting their efforts up into an epic event." Further, she states that in the first few moments of the film all the main characters are well established, saying, "If that isn't screenwriting, I don't know what is".

==Critical reception==
''Armageddon'' received generally mixed and negative reviews from film critics, who mainly took issue with "the furious pace of its editing". The film is on the list of Roger Ebert's most hated films. In his original review, Ebert stated, "The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained". Todd McCarthy of Variety also gave the film a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style: "Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 2½ hours." Subsequent to its release, the film has a cumulative 40% "Rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while achieving a 42% aggregate score on Metacritic.

According to Bruce Joel Rubin, writer of ''Deep Impact'', a "president at Disney" took notes on everything the writer said during lunch about his script and initiated ''Armageddon'' as a counter film at Disney.

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for four Oscars at the 1999 Academy Awards: 'Best Sound' (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell, and Keith A. Wester), 'Best Visual Effects', 'Best Sound Effects Editing', and 'Best Original Song (I Don't Want to Miss a Thing performed by Aerosmith)'. The film received the Saturn Awards for Best Direction and Best Science Fiction Film (where it tied with Dark City). It was also nominated for seven Razzie Awards[14] including: Worst Actor (Bruce Willis), Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actress (Liv Tyler), Worst Screen Couple (Tyler and Ben Affleck), and Worst Original Song. Only one Razzie was awarded: Bruce Willis received the Worst Actor award for ''Armageddon'', in addition to his appearances in Mercury Rising and The Siege, both released in the same year as this film.

==Scientific accuracy==
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Michael Bay admitted that the central premise of the film, "that [NASA] could actually do something in a situation like this," was unrealistic. Robert Roy Pool, a contributing screenwriter, stated that his script, in which an anti-gravity device is used to deflect a comet from a collision course with Earth, was "much more in line with top-secret research." Additionally, near the end of the credits there is a disclaimer stating, "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's cooperation and assistance does not reflect an endorsement of the contents of the film or the treatment of the characters depicted therein."

NASA shows the film as part of its management training program. Prospective managers are asked to find as many inaccuracies in the movie as they can. At least 168 impossible things have been found during these screenings of the film.

In 2012, following a mathematical analysis of the situation, an article titled "Could Bruce Willis Save the World?" was published in the Special Physics Topics Journal. It found that for Willis' approach to be effective, he would need to be in possession of an H-bomb a billion times stronger than the Soviet Union's "Big Ivan", the biggest ever detonated on Earth. Using estimates of the asteroid's size, density, speed, and distance from Earth based on information in the film, postgraduate students from the University of Leicester found that to split the asteroid in two with both pieces clearing Earth, would require 800 trillion terajoules of energy. In contrast the total energy output of "Big Ivan", which was tested by the Soviet Union in 1961, was only 418,000 terajoules.

==Novelization==
A novelization was written by C. Bolin, based on the screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams, Tony Gilroy, and Shane Salerno and the story by Jonathan Hensleigh and Robert Pool.

==Theme park attraction==
[[Armageddon - Les Effets Speciaux]] was an attraction based on ''Armageddon'' at Walt Disney Studios Park located at Disneyland Paris. The attraction simulates the scene in the movie in which the Russian Space Station is destroyed. Michael Clarke Duncan ("Bear" in the movie) features in the pre-show. It closed in April 2019 to make way for a Spider-Man attraction as part of The Avengers campus at Walt Disney Studios Park.
