*The Japanese laserdisc version, released in 1985, is radically different from the original program. The opening credits cut off after the "Starring" credit. Then, during the opening wraparound scene, as Ludwig Von Drake starts the film, it goes straight to the first short (''Bootle Beetle''). All of the shorts are unedited, complete with opening and closing title cards, but the rest of the wraparound scenes with Von Drake are gone.
