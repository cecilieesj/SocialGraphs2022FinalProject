'''''Woodland Café''''' is a ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon released in [[1937]].

==Synopsis==
In a nightclub staffed and frequented entirely by insects, the stage show has a good girl fly resisting the advances of a bad-boy spider. Everyone dances, even the snails, as the orchestra plays jazz on their instruments made of flowers.

==Songs==
*"12th Street Rag" (originally written by Euday L. Bowman)
*''Valse des rayons'' (during the French Apache dance, composed by Jacques Offenbach)
*"Truckin'" (music by Ted Koehler, lyrics by Rube Bloom)

==Trivia==
*In one scene, a female fly and a male spider are both shown smoking during a dance routine. Airings of ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'' on the [[Disney Channel]] censored the female fly's smoking, but not the male spider's smoking!
*Similarly, on ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', portions of the "Everybody's Truckin'" number were deleted because the grasshopper band resembled African-American stereotypes.
*Scenes from this cartoon were used during the song [[The Ugly Bug Ball]] on ''[[DTV]]'', in ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs: The Bare Necessities]]'' and also the music video, [[Dr. Looney's Remedy]] in [[Parachute Express]]' ''Come Sing With Us''.
*On the ''Limited Gold Edition Silly Symphonies'' VHS, it uses the 1948 burlap re-issue titles, but on the ''Extreme Music Fun'' DVD, the 1937 Original United Artists titles was restored.
