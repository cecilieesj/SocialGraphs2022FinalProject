'''''Blame It on the Samba''''' is an animated short and a song from the film, ''[[Melody Time]]''. [[Donald Duck]] and [[José Carioca]] have a case of the blues and the only way to cure themselves is by getting into the rhythm of the Samba which they do with a little help from the [[Aracuan Bird]]. It was reissued as a stand-alone short on [[April 1]], [[1955]].

==Synopsis==
Donald and José are down in the dumps until the Aracuan Bird introduces them to the pleasures of the samba!

==Plot==
[[Donald Duck]] and [[José Carioca]] walk sadly where they enter a full-string café to get the rhythm of samba. As the [[Aracuan Bird]] gives the sad couple with the rhythm of samba, Donald and José get used to dancing with the samba just as the Aracuan Bird gives them the beat of samba. Making a glass of magic, Donald and José Carioca swim around in the glass where they encounter Ethel Smith playing an organ just as Donald and José dance to Ethel Smith playing her organ to which the two have fun dancing with her. Back at the tropical forest, the Aracuan Bird and Ethel Smith perform the rhythm of samba around them just as Donald and José dance to the upbeat rhythm of samba. As Donald and José continue dancing with Ethel Smith, the Aracuan Bird closes the café, ending the segment.

==Characters==
*[[Donald Duck]]
*[[José Carioca]]
*[[Aracuan Bird]] (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]])

==Trivia==
Foreign dubs of this segment prior to the late 1990's-early 2000's didn't have the song translated so the Brazilian version was kept for some reason. However, the English lyrics were translated for later dubbings of Melody Time. Ironically, the later Brazilian dubbing translates the English lyrics instead of keeping the original lyrics of what it's based on for the original dub.
