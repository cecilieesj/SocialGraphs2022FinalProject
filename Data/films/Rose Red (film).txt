==Production==
In 2016, Disney announced a new film in development titled ''Rose Red''; a live-action spin-off film of [[Snow White]]'s sister, Rose Red.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/03/31/rose-red-snow-white-sister-disney-movie/|title=Rose Red: Live-action film about Snow White's sister in the works at Disney|author=Oliver Gettell|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 31, 2016|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref>

However, it was announced on May 29, 2021 that the project was scrapped.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2021/05/29/upcoming-disney-live-action-remakes-adaptations/|title=Upcoming Disney Live-Action Remakes/Adaptations|website=The Disney Insider|date=May 29, 2021|accessdate=December 9, 2021}}</ref>

== Trivia==
*The character Rose Red would have been based on the character of the same name from the Brothers Grimm's ''Snow-White and Rose-Red.'' The Snow White in the original story is not the same character as the one in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''
