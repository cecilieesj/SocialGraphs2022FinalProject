==History==
The film marked the first major project after the acquisition of the Muppets property by [[The Walt Disney Company]], although the project had already been in development with ABC. At the time, [[the Jim Henson Company]] was consulting with Disney and developing new Muppet series and movies under a three-year production deal.

Since April 2004, the Muppets had been re-introduced to the public by way of low-key marketing and guest appearances on such shows as ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in hopes for a successful turn in the ratings by the time the new telefilm hit the air.

==Promotion==
The movie was promoted with special [[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz commercials|Wizard of Oz commercials]] that spoofed popular [[ABC]] shows at the time.

Further, print ads in various magazines, as well as guest appearances of various Muppets on [[America's Funniest Home Videos]], [[Jimmy Kimmel Live]], [[The Tony Danza Show]], [[Good Morning America]] and [[Live with Regis and Kelly]] helped to get the word out.

In addition, Ashanti unveiled [[Macy's Windows|six windows]] at [[Macy's]] on March 20, 2005, for promotional purposes. The windows depicted scenes from the movie in conjunction with the Macy's Flower Show. The Macy's flagship store offered [[Muppets' Wizard of Oz plush]] and [[Muppet T-shirts|a T-shirt]] depicting the main cast during the promotional period.

The movie had its world premiere screening on April 27, 2005, at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], introduced by Kermit the Frog and [[Robert De Niro]].

==The Adaptation==
This film departs from the original Oz novel in a number of noticeable ways: Dorothy's family owns a diner instead of a farm; Toto is a prawn; the Tin Woodman is a robot. Many of the characters' personalities and backgrounds are given a show-biz makeover. For instance, this version's Dorothy dreams of being a famous singer, and at first she plans to ask the Wizard to give her fame rather than a way back to Kansas.

However, in several respects the plot follows the novel more closely than does the classic 1939 movie. For example, the Good Witch of the North (who greets Dorothy when she arrives in Oz) and Glinda (who shows her how to get home) are separate characters; the magic shoes are silver instead of ruby; when Dorothy defeats the Wicked Witch of the West, she gains control of the Flying Monkeys; and the Wizard meets with each of Dorothy's friends separately in a different guise.

Another note is that the Flying Monkeys are a biker gang, a trait that is reminiscent of ''[[The Wiz]]''.

''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' is not the only adaptation of the ''Oz'' mythos within a Muppet production, however. ''[[The Muppets Go to the Movies]]'' featured a sketch incorporating a medley of "[[If I Only Had a Brain]]" and "[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]", with Miss Piggy portraying the version of Dorothy played by [[Judy Garland]], alongside the [[Cowardly Lion]], [[the Scarecrow]], and the [[Tin Thing]]. Fozzie and Gonzo would play the Tin Man and Lion again in an episode of ''[[Muppet Babies]]'' and Kermit also starred as the Scarecrow. Additionally, Fozzie Bear portrayed the Tin Man in [[Episode 506: Brooke Shields|an episode]] of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.

==Notes==
* Kermit makes a reference to [[Frank Oz]] in the film, when he asks the Wizard, "Would you, by any chance be related to ''Frank Oz''?"

* Before Dorothy's televised concert toward the end of the movie, Pepe references Disney's acquisition of The Muppets franchise. Speaking on the phone, he says, "Listen, [[Michael Eisner|Eisner]], baby. If you think we're going for that deal, you're out of your Mickey mind, okay?"
