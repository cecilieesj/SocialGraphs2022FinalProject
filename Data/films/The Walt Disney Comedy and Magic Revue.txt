==Trivia==
*Early promotional artwork suggested that ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' would be included, as it showed [[Ned Land]] and [[Captain Nemo]]'s pet seal Esmeralda, but the film is not shown in the actual video.
*Cover art also suggested that ''[[Hawaiian Holiday]]'' would be included, as it shows [[Goofy]] with his surfboard on his back, while the back of the cover mentions ''[[Modern Inventions]]'' in the list of films, but both are missing from the video itself.
