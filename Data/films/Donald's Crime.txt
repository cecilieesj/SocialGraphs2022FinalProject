'''''Donald's Crime''''' is a short from Walt Disney Productions starring [[Donald Duck]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey, Louie]], and [[Daisy Duck]]. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cartoon in [[1945]].

==Synopsis==
One evening while eagerly awaiting a date with Daisy, Donald realizes he doesn't have any money. When he sees Huey, Duey, and Louie's piggy bank, and following a brief battle with his gangster-speaking conscience, he takes it. After sending the nephews to bed, and trying to hide the uneasy feelings, Donald breaks open the piggy bank, takes the money (totaling $1.25), and goes on to have a fun time with Daisy at a local dance club.

Later that evening, Donald drops Daisy off at her house. She kisses him and calls him a "big shot." Donald at first feels prideful as he starts to walk home, but soon he begins to feel guilty. His conscience calls him a gangster and reminds him that bank robbery is a federal crime. Donald starts to imagine that federal agents are chasing him and he starts to run. As the film continues, his visions become more nightmarish and desperate. At last Donald corners himself in a dark alley and believes he is in jail. He frantically grabs the bars of a door window and shakes it. A sign falls off and hits him in the head. It's a 'help wanted' sign, and Donald discovers the door is the service entrance of an all night cafe.

Donald works through the night and earns enough money to pay back his nephews, except when he returns the money to the piggy bank, he accidentally returns $1.30 of the original $1.25. When the nephews wake up, they see Donald trying to take a nickel from the piggy bank and begin to complain. Donald's conscience reminds him, "You see, chum? Crime doesn't pay."

*The inflation conversion of $1.25 back in 1945 translates to $18.25 in the year 2020.
*In airings on ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', the scene that shows Donald's nephews playing with toy guns was deemed too violent and deleted. Another scene that shows Donald smoking was also deleted.
