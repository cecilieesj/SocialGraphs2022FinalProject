==Trivia==
* This is the only ''Disney's Sing-Along Songs'' release to include [[You've Got a Friend in Me|a song]] from a [[Pixar]] [[Toy Story|film]].
* Retitled as ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]] and other countries.
* Segments only (no host)
* (^ ) Songs featured in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' which replaced "Stand by Me", "The Dwarfs' Yodel Song (The Silly Song)",  "Family", and "The Unbirthday Song".
*Known as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame|El Jorobado de Notre Dame]]'' in Spanish, released in [[Spain]].
* The lyrics: "It's the day the devil in us gets released. It's the day we mock the pig and shock the priest." were changed to: "Good is bad and best is worst and west is east. On the day, we think the most of those with least.". This is to prevent the song from influencing mature themes. However, the original lyrics were retained in the releases of other languages. [[Esmeralda]]'s pole dancing scene is also erased, due to mature themes.
* "The Silly Song" and "The Unbirthday Song" were updated with newer lyrics.
* After "The Unbirthday Song" is finished, the Dormouse's line "Twinkle, twinkle little bat" is replaced with fireworks, just before the reprise of "Topsy Turvy".
* The beginning in the song "Out There" is cut, due to being dark for young viewers.
* The only US exclusive featuring "Father and Son" and "On the Open Road" is ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Honor to Us All|Honor to Us All]]''.
*This is the final sing-along video to end with a reprise of the title song without onscreen lyrics.
