==Synopsis==
Parenting is tough, especially when the stakes are high. On an idyllic beach in the Pacific Northwest, curiosity gets the better of a young raccoon whose frustrated parent attempts to keep them both safe. In the all-new Walt Disney Animation Studios animated short, Far From the Tree, this young raccoon will learn that while there is reason to be fearful, as danger lurks around every corner, it is still possible to live with an open heart.<ref>https://www.disneyanimation.com/shorts/far-from-the-tree/</ref>

==Plot==
A small baby raccoon, identified as [[Marie (Far From the Tree)|Marie]] by the crew, and her parent, who has a scar over his left eye, venture outside of the woods and onto a beach. While Marie is quick to venture out, the parent is over protective in an aggressive manner. The parent attempts to dig for oysters for them to eat, but Marie continues to get distracted by tufted puffins, crabs and a seashell where she listens to the ocean in it. The parent angrily takes the seashell and smashes it; leaving the small raccoon sad.

A seagull appears and Marie is enticed to follow it towards its flock. However, as she gets close, she realizes that there is a coyote prowling for food. The coyote chases after the raccoon and manages to leave a scar across her nose. The parent appears and manages to bash the coyote away as they run up a tree to hide. The parent angrily chatters at Marie before revealing that their scar came from a similar predator. Both parent and child raccoon begin to feel distant.

Years later, Marie, now an adult, ventures onto the beach with her own young; following a similar pattern from her parent. Once again, the young is faced with similar eye catching oddities that the parent tries to deter him from. When the young finds a new seashell, Marie proceeds to angrily take it away, but catches herself making the same mistake her parent made and calmly takes her young to the top of the tree to show him the predator and her scar. Mother and child comfort one another. 

The two return to the beach, with Marie teaching and playing with her child before returning to the tree, where the mother gifts her child with a sea shell.
