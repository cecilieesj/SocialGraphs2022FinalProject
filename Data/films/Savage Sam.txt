'''''Savage Sam''''' is the [[1963]] film sequel to ''[[Old Yeller]]'', written by Fred Gipson. It was inspired by the story of former Apache captive Herman Lehmann, whom Gipson had seen give an exhibition when he was a child. [[Norman Tokar]] directed it, which was released by [[Walt Disney]] on [[June 1]], 1963.

==Plot==
[[Savage Sam (character)|Savage Sam]] is [[Old Yeller (character)|Old Yeller]]'s son (although he was called Young Yeller in the first film and also looked different). He is a Bluetick Coonhound, and every bit as courageous and loyal as his father, as well as an incredibly keen tracker. He mostly likes chasing a bobcat, sometimes with [[Arliss Coates|Arliss]].

[[Brian Keith]] plays the boys' Uncle Beck (referred to as Jim's younger brother) who comes by to check on how they are doing and gives advice to [[Travis Coates|Travis]] on how to handle Arliss a little better. ("All little brothers hate bossing. You've got to learn how to outfigger him, Travis.")

In 1870, 18-year-old Travis is left in charge of his precocious 12-year-old brother, Arliss, on the family ranch in [[Texas]], while Jim and [[Katie Coates|Katie]] visit their ailing grandmother in San Antonio. While Arliss and Savage Sam are tracking a wildcat, Travis is warned by [[Bud Searcy]] that renegade [[Apaches]] are in the area. When Travis joins Bud's 17-year-old daughter, [[Lisbeth Searcy|Lisbeth]], in a search for Arliss, they are captured by a band of Apaches led by a Comanche chief. Beck witnesses the scene and manages to wound him, but his horse is shot by one of the braves, allowing him and his followers to escape with the captives. Beck alerts the U.S. Cavalry, but the Apaches split into three groups and ride for the hills; in the confusion, Travis escapes but is knocked unconscious and left to die. Beck and his posse of five find Travis and Savage Sam, set out in pursuit of the other captives, and eventually find the Apaches in a valley fighting over Lisbeth. Although posse member, Pack Underwood, bent on revenge for the massacre of his family, fires a shot that alerts the Apaches to their planned ambush.
