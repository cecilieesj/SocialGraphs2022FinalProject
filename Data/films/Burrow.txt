==Synopsis==
The short follows a young rabbit as she tries to build the burrow of her dreams, becoming embarrassed each time she accidentally digs into a neighbor's home.

==Plot==
A young rabbit digs a burrow for herself in the hopes of building her dream home. While digging into the dirt, she encounters a couple of moles who are exercising and a family of mice who both welcome her. However, the socially awkward rabbit, wanting to live in solitude by herself, instead digs deeper into the ground and encounters more neighbors whom she wants nothing to do with including a hedgehog family, well-read frogs, sauna lizards and a party of ants, all of whom show a friendly, welcoming attitudes, but the rabbit proceeds to evade them. After a brief encounter with a creature that roars at her, she digs further down than any of the other animals.

The rabbit eventually tries to create her hovel, but hits a stream, resulting in her small burrow filling with water, which the other animals feel. The rabbit climbs back up to the previously unknown creature, who turns out to be a badger, and she explains her situation. The badger, who is implied to be the landlord of sorts, calls for the other animals to help the rabbit and they all dig a tunnel to divert the water away and out onto the surface. The rabbit, feeling guilty for trying to avoid her neighbors, shows them her plans. Later, the rabbit is shown having made a comfortable living space for herself with the help of her new neighbors and even has added a small roof over her hole. She fixes her mailbox before rejoining her new friends.

==Trivia==
