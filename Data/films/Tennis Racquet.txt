==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short version due to time constraints:
*The line of cars going to the flower show instead of the tennis game.
*The crowd getting packed in is shortened significantly.
*The contestants coming out onto the field and Big Ben removing his tennis racquet cover.
*The sportscaster accidentally unplugging his microphone and plugging it into a spectator's radio.
*The gardener's smoking pipe causing Big Ben to sneeze.
*The initial play and the spectators watching is shortened.
*Little Joe accidentally getting buried under a newly-planted tree; him burrowing through the ground is retained, however.
*All scenes between Little Joe now serving and Little Joe "jab[bing] with a smash" are cut.
*The spectators watching during the slow motion scene.
*Further plays after the slow motion scene and before the point where the game is won are cut.
*Big Ben receiving the giant trophy and Little Joe angry at losing.

==Trivia==
* The animation of the spectators taking their seats is reused from ''[[Hockey Homicide]]'', which was also narrated by Weaver.
* This is the only short where Goofy is portrayed with brown fur.
* The trophy at the end is labeled "Edwin Parks Trophy", a nod to Ed Parks, an animator for Disney.
