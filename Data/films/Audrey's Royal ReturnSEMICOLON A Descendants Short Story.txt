'''''Audrey's Royal Return: A Descendants Short Story''''' is the second prequel to ''[[Descendants 3]]'' following ''[[Under the Sea: A Descendants Story]]''. It recaps the [[Descendants |first]] and [[Descendants 2|second]] movies in [[Audrey (Descendants)|Audrey]]'s perspective while she is at the spa getting a makeover.

==Plot==
[[Audrey (Descendants)|Audrey]] goes to the spa to get a new makeover. She talks with the spa attendant telling her "traumatic" year, that she was [[Ben (Descendants)|Ben]]'s girlfriend (and in her words, "his future queen and wife") everything her family wanted for her.

Until Ben's royal decree to let the teenage children of [[Isle of the Lost]] ([[Mal]] [[Evie|and]] [[Jay (Descendants)|her]] [[Carlos De Vil|friends]]) come to live in [[Auradon]],Audrey tried to warn him and everybody about bringing VKs over but, to no avail, they even cheered when Ben (is under a love spell) confesses his love for Mal at the tourney game, she told herself "Audrey, if that's what Ben wants, then you don't really want to be him." So she started to date [[Chad Charming]], she and her [[Queen Leah|grandmother]] were right about the VKs, they were gonna bring down the barrier, let all the villains, and destroy Auradon. The worst part for Audrey was seeing Mal on the coronation carriage with Ben instead of her, then [[Maleficent]] shows up and turns into a dragon, Mal did the right thing, she turns her own mother into a lizard, as for Audrey, she behaves and bow to each other out of respect, she did attend the coronation after-party.

After the coronation, her [[Aurora|mother]]'s [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|guardians]] whisked Audrey to their [[Aurora's Cottage|cottage]] for rest & relaxation, she is glad that she stayed away from Auradon, it has gotten really crazy, Mal couldn't handle with her new life and celebrity status, she fell back into magic and lied and again. When Ben got furious, call her out on it, Mal went back to the Isle, so he chased after her along with her friends (and [[Dude]] who can talk now), they all went to the Isle, Ben tries to talk with Mal to come back to Auradon but, she dumps him and got him kidnapped by [[Uma]] and her pirate crew, she demands [[Fairy Godmother]]'s [[Magic Wand]] an exchange for Ben. Audrey told the attendant that she didn't want to attend the Royal Cotillion because she was supposed to be presented as the king's lady, Uma shows up to the cotillion, cast a love spell on him but, it was no match for Mal because she kisses Ben and breaks the spell. Then, Uma and Mal fight, Ben intervenes the battle, Uma gives Ben back the ring he gave her and swims away, Mal and Ben reunite, there relationship is now renewed.

Audrey concludes no matter the trouble Mal causes, she will always save the day and Ben will always love her. Audrey misses her home and believes that Auradon misses her too, she decides to return home to make her royal entrance, she checks out her new makeover in a mirror and tells herself "''Ben's going to be sorry he ever let this go.''" and she is very pleased with her new look.
