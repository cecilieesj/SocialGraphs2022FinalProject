'''''Tommy Tucker's Tooth''''' is a [[1922]] live-action short film produced and directed by [[Walt Disney]] at his short-lived Laugh-O-Grams studio in Kansas City. The format was black and white, without sound.

The film was one of two commissioned by Kansas City Dentist Thomas B. McCrumb. It extols the virtues of regular tooth brushing through the story of two boys: Tommy Tucker and Jimmie Jones. Tommy cares for his teeth, while Jimmie does not. The film ends with advice on proper tooth-brushing technique.
