| Notes                   = '''''Kyōfu Densetsu Kaiki! Frankenstein''''' is a 1981 Japanese animated television film based on Mary Shelley's novel and the Marvel comic book ''[[Frankenstein Vol 1|Monster of Frankenstein]]''. The film was dubbed into English and released in the U.S in 1984. The dubbed version never had an on-screen title but was advertised as both ''Monster of Frankenstein'' and ''Frankenstein: Legend of Terror''.
| Trivia                  = A lot of online versions are 88 minutes long. People think this is because the film has been edited, but it's purely shorter due to the adverts being edited out.
