==Plot==
Frank McKlusky is an insurance claims investigator who has been zealously safety conscious since witnessing a horrible motorcycle stunt gone awry in his childhood, an accident that left his father comatose. Frank still lives at home under the watchful eye of his mother and wears a helmet everywhere he goes. When his partner is killed, Frank is forced to leave his safe and secure life behind, go undercover, and crack the case, which he discovers is a sinister conspiracy. Unfortunately for the villains, Frank turns out to be a first-class bumbler in the Inspector Clouseau mold.
