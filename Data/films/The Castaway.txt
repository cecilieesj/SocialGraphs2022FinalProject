'''''The Castaway''''' is a [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] cartoon that was released on [[April 6]], [[1931]].

==Summary==
Mickey, apparently shipwrecked, is on a raft, using what appears to be a pair of bloomers (similar to Minnie's) as an impromptu sail until a seagull is caught in it and flies away. By poking a swordfish who has rammed into the raft, he is propelled (and then launched from the raft entirely) onto a tropical island, where a banana tree takes care of his hunger, until he accidentally drops a spider onto his face by squirting a banana into the air. He then discovers a box containing a piano that washed ashore, and begins playing it. The animals come around; a small tiger cub (standing upright) attempts to play the piano, as Mickey tries to shoo him away. Then, a gorilla, after playing a 4-hands piece with his feet, destroys the piano. Mickey runs away and accidentally wakes a lion. The lion chases Mickey to a stream, where he jumps onto a rock that turns out to be right next to a crocodile. The lion lunges for Mickey, misses, and ends up in the croc's mouth; Mickey ties the Lion's tail around the crocodile's maw, subduing both carnivores. Mickey then discovers that the rock he's standing on is a giant turtle, who swims away with Mickey aboard.
