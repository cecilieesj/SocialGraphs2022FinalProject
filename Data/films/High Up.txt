==Plot==
The shorts starts with Pete as a barker in a circus, enticing everyone to see Ortensia, in this short being portrayed as a shimmy dancer. From too much talking, Pete’s jaw locks up and he tries many ways to close it, to no avail.

Oswald sees Pete and helps him close his jaw with a hammer. The hammer’s impact sends Pete’s dentures away until they land on a bench next to a fat hippo lady. She then procedes to sit on the bench, and the dentures chomp her tail. Pete notices this and removes the teeth from the hippo’s tail. Upon doing this, he gets yelled at by the hippo.

Nearby, there is a giraffe, making a “sword sandwich”, which he eats in one bite. Next to him there is a jock, lifting 1 ton. Oswald approaches the weight and lifts it, throwing it on top of a pile of other weights nearby. He lifts the pile easily, and the crowd cheers.

The next scene shows a spider on a tightrope, doing various tricks. Pete, Ortensia is amazed by the spider’s stunts, and asks Oswald to try to do the same, but he refuses. Pete mocks Oswald for being scared of doing so, and drops his cigar’s ash on Oswald’s head. Oswald changes his mind and climbs up the ladder and begins his tightrope walk.

Oswald reaches the top, and looks down in fear. Ortensia blows him a heart which floats up and reaches him. He reaches for the heart and gains enough courage to walk through the tightrope.

He gains a running start, only to immediately balance slowly and carefully through the rope. He loses balance and falls in between the rope, splitting into two. While split, he grabs the rope before his fall, gets back up in one peace. Ortensia claps from below, while Pete gets jealous. An ice cream vendor passes near them, and Pete gets an idea.

He grabs the ice cream, and gives it to Ortensia, trying to get her attention away from Oswald. This backfires, as Ortensia throws the ice cream to give to to Oswald, in which he missed to get it. It falls down and splats in Pete’s face. He snaps, and attempts to catch Ortensia. She climbs up the ladder, Pete following behind. Oswald grabs Ortensia, and they both walk to the other side of the rope, while   Ortensia removes the rope, to prevent Pete from crossing.

When they both get to the other side, Oswald laughs at Pete, while he notices a swing going back and forth. He grabs it and reaches the other side, getting Ortensia and perfurating a hole in the circus’ roof. Oswald jumps out and chases Pete. They all get sent rolling down the circus’ roof, until Pete lands on a mechanical horse, which makes a hole in the ground. Ortensia falls down the hole, and Pete jumps out the hold gallops away with her.

Oswald, not too far behind, falls down the hole and comes out with a tall unicycle. Pete and Ortensia get near a lake, when the horse plummets down with them. Oswald catches up and cycles away to catch them. When they get out of the lake, the vehicles have switched. Oswald is now on the horse, and Pete and Ortensia are in the unicycle. They get near a high ledge, Pete easily goes off, thanks to the tall unicycle. Oswald on the other hand, has to do a double jump with some help from the horse to go across the ledge.

Oswald catches up with Pete, who is about to throw Ortensia off a cliff. Oswald gets ready to brawl, showing his (weak) muscles and preparing for a punch. Pete interrupts him, and turns towards the cliff, ready to throw Ortensia down below. The tip of the cliff unexpectedly breaks, and both Pete and Ortensia fall down, but they survive, grabbing on to another cliff below. Ortensia, almost falling down again, pulls Pete’s peg leg, stretching it wide, until it falls off. She falls again, only to grab onto a branch.

Oswald, still on top of the cliff, tries to climb down and reach Ortensia, but is too scared to do so. The branch begins to break, and Oswald sees a well near him. He pushes it next to the cliff and throws the well’s bucket down below. The branch breaks, but luckily Ortensia falls into the bucket, and Oswald begins pulling the bucket back up. Pete sees the bucket’s rope and cuts it so thin that the little piece of rope debris form a coil shape. The bucket begins to break apart, and Ortensia falls once more. The coil jumps down to the ground and Ortensia falls on it, making her go back up, in which Oswald grabs her, only to get sent into the air with her. Her dress turns into a parachute and they glide back down, kissing eachother.
