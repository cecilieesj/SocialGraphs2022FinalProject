'''''Pluto's Quin-puplets''''' was the first [[Pluto]] cartoon not part of the ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' series.

==Synopsis==
Pluto has to stay and watch the kids while Fifi goes out for food. Not an easy job with five rambunctious pups who won't stay still and end up fighting with an airhose and some spilled paint. Even more difficult when Pluto accidentally drinks moonshine.

When Fifi returns home with some sausages, she discovers the mess that happens when she's away: Pluto is drunk on moonshine and stained with paint, while the pups are heavily colored with paint (with patterns). Infuriated by this, Fifi chasing away Pluto and the pups, but in turn left alone in the doghouse during the cold night, meanwhile Pluto and the pups sleeping comfortably in their own extemporary shelter.

==Notes==
*For some odd reason, the 1980's master of the cartoon as seen on the ''Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Cartoon Collections'' and ''Walt Disney Cartoon Classics: Starring Pluto & Fifi'', you can hear an out of sync and lower volume of the soundtrack played underneath the actual soundtrack. This was fixed on later masters of the 90's, and the restored copy since the ''Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Pluto''.
*Outside [[Pluto Junior (character)|Pluto Jr.]], this is the only appearance of the quin-puplets until the 2021 series ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]''.
