'''''Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers''''' (also known as simply ''The Three Musketeers'') is a direct-to-DVD animated adaptation of the novel ''The Three Musketeers'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]]. As the title suggests, it features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] as the three musketeers. This film was directed by [[Donovan Cook]], produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]], and released directly to VHS and DVD in [[2004]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]].

==Plot==
The movie opens with Troubadour, a French-speaking turtle with an affinity for music, reminding a television show narrator that he had promised Troubadour one of his songs would be used in the show that day. The narrator silently breaks his promise and walks away from Troubadour. Not looking where he is going, he falls into a hole in the floor as the show begins. Consequently, Troubadour is ushered in to tell the audience the story at the last minute, and he chooses his comic book of The Three Musketeers.

"Our story begins in the gutter", he says, where Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Mickey's dog Pluto are street urchins, who, while being robbed by masked bandits (played by the Beagle Boys) and are saved by the Royal Musketeers, [[Athos]], [[Aramis]], [[Porthos]], and [[D'Artagnan]]. Afterward, Athos gives his hat to Mickey as a souvenir. The urchins are inspired to be great musketeers someday. Years later, the three are working as janitors in the palace, still dreaming of becoming musketeers, despite their flaws: Donald is a "coward" (who turns into a chicken whenever he is frightened), Goofy is a "doofus", and Mickey is "just too small", according to Captain Pete of the Royal Musketeers. This leaves the three downhearted.

Meanwhile, Minnie Mouse, princess of France, and her lady-in-waiting, Daisy Duck, are in a palace discussing Minnie's obsession with finding her "one true love". Daisy says that she must marry someone of royal blood, and Minnie insists that she cannot marry someone she does not love. Minnie says she will know that he is "the one" when he makes her laugh. Minnie then takes a walk in the palace garden and barely escapes with her life when the Beagle Boys attempt to drop a safe on her.

The Beagles run to tell their boss, Captain Pete, that they were not successful in dropping the safe on Minnie. Pete gets upset because the assignment was to kidnap the princess and keep her "safe" before the opera The Pirates of Penzance, which is when he plans to take over the kingdom. (This is accompanied by a running gag: whenever Pete mentions the opera, an opera poster is shown, and an operatic voice sings.) Just then, Pete's lieutenant, Clarabelle Cow, tells Pete that Princess Minnie requests his presence. Pete goes to the princess, who tells him that she wants musketeer bodyguards. Knowing that skilled musketeers would jeopardize his kidnap plans, Pete appoints Mickey, Donald, and Goofy to protect her. When the three "musketeers" meet Princess Minnie, she instantly falls in love with Mickey. The boys are so caught up wanting to make a good first impression that when Daisy comes in with a cheese tray for Minnie, and they see the accompanying knife, they tackle Daisy, thinking she is a villain.

While Minnie and Daisy, protected by Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, go on a journey, they are ambushed by the Beagle Boys. Donald hides and is eventually thrown off the carriage, and Goofy is easily defeated, leaving Mickey to fight the intruders. Mickey is also defeated, leaving the three heroes stranded. Mickey encourages his friends not to lose hope, and they rush to rescue Minnie and Daisy. At the entrance to a tall tower, Goofy tells his fellow musketeers to stand back so he can break down the door, but Mickey opens it before he can stop, which sends Goofy rolling past the Beagle Boys and out of the tower. Outside, Goofy bounces off a tree, gets kicked by a cow, and is thrown by a windmill back into the tower and goes rolling past the Beagle Boys again. When Mickey and Goofy are trapped with the Beagle Boys, Goofy gets the idea to do the same thing again with Mickey, and they manage to knock the Beagles out of the tower and rescue Minnie and Daisy. After Mickey unties Minnie and makes her laugh, the two fall in love.

Pete is furious that the Beagle Boys failed in their task and realizes that the three protagonists are more of a threat than originally anticipated. While on night duty, Goofy is lured away from the palace by Clarabelle. The Beagle Boys appear before Donald, capture him, and try to execute him via guillotine, but he escapes and tells the whole story to Mickey before running off, leaving Mickey by himself. Mickey is then captured by Pete, who chains him up in a dungeon in Mont Saint-Michel that will flood when the tide comes in.

Meanwhile, Clarabelle is about to throw a chained-up Goofy to his death off a bridge. Goofy flirts with her and wins her heart with his "numbskull charm". She pulls him up, and they kiss. The two plummet towards the river but land on Donald's boat instead. Goofy tries to convince Donald that they have to save Mickey, but he is too scared to try. However, an insulting song by Troubadour makes him change his mind, and they rescue their friend just in time.

Outside the Paris Opéra, the Beagle Boys greeted Minnie and Daisy and walked right into the opera house. As they walked down the hall to the throne, they find themselves captured by Captain Pete in a burlap sack. Minnie squeezed her head out of the bag and screamed, "this situation is outrageous." Pete reveals his nefarious plan to rule. While the smallest beagle poses as her, Pete orders the Beagle Boys to hide the chest with the two princesses in it.

Meanwhile, the heroic trio made it to Paris. The beagle starts announcing to the public that she is handing the crown over to a gleeful Pete. The trio makes their way to the Opera house, and Pluto leads them to the Princess in the chest. When the two boys try to bolt out to the exit, they were stopped by the three musketeers' arrival and battle them onstage. When the musketeers caught the chest, they try to make their getaway upstage and come to a dead end. They get themselves on the cardboard smiling, crescent moon and lowers them back to the ground. Pete jumps on the cardboard smiling sun and pulls them back up a little. After a tug of war with the chest, they dropped it. Mickey runs back to the stage and painfully caught the chest. The final battle commences, and his two teammates survive, defeat him, and save the Princess. Mickey and Minnie finally declare their love for one another, while Donald wins Daisy's heart and Goofy wins Clarabelle's. Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are dubbed royal musketeers.

==Trivia==
*This movie was created around the same time as ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''.
*One big difference from this film and the novel is the villain isn’t the Cardinal but rather the Captain of the Musketeers who wants to get rid of the Princess so he can rule France.
*Artwork from an earlier "Mickey and the Three Musketeers" film project was shown at the "Mickey's Lost Adventures" panel at the 2018 Destination D event. These character sketches feature many other classic Disney characters in different roles: [[José Carioca]] was to be a Musketeer, [[Honest John and Gideon]] were to be featured as Cardinal Richelieu and a henchman, and [[J. Thaddeus Toad]] would have played the role of King Louis XIII.
*On [[Disney Channel]] and [[Disney Junior]] airings, the clip where one of the Beagle Boys puts the jacks in his mouth when Pete is about to release them from the pit and the clip where Donald pokes Pete in his eyes (during the film's climax) were removed as a safety precaution. Both Disney Television networks were concerned that kids might imitate either of those scenes at home.
*The 2004 DVD of the movie was the first Disney DVD to have [[Disney's FastPlay|FastPlay]].
*This movie is set in the 17th century, yet Minnie and Daisy are seen with fast food products, which didn't exist yet in real life.
**It can be speculated that the fast food is from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft_service craft services].
**The same goes for "The Pirates of Penzance" by W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, which premiered in 31st December 1879.
**A similar trait happens in the Silly Symphony cartoon ''[[The Golden Touch]]''.
*When Pete took Mickey to the dungeon, he is heard singing the "[[Mickey Mouse Club March]]".
*The back of Pete's coach horse number plate is written [[A113]], which is an inside joke and Easter egg commonly spotted in [[Pixar]] movies.

===4th Wall Breaks ===
Not counting when the Troubadour constantly talks to the viewer as the narrator he is, neither the musical acts where it is common the character to look at the camera and sing directly to the viewer, the movie follows conventions of [[Breaking the fourth wall|breaking the 4th wall]]:
*The Beagle Boys refer to the viewer a couple of times.
*Every time Pete mentions the Opera Night, the camera turns to the poster while the main part of the song plays in the background. After the 2nd and 3rd time, Pete actually notices it and comments on how the "little ditty is starting to grow on (him)".
*When singing his own song "Petey's King of France", his last note lasts a few beats longer than the instrumental, prompting Pete to ask "Why did the music stop?"
*When ripping off his Musketeer outfit, Donald reveals his original (and mostly out of the story's time) sailor outfit under his musketeer outfit.
*When Mickey is fighting the Beagle Boys on top of Minnie's coach, one of the Beagle Boys slices at Mickey's Musketeer outfit with his sword. And then, Mickey's Musketeer outfit comes off, showing Mickey in his original red shorts and yellow shoes, where he stands in the middle of Minnie's coach and makes his standard pose at the camera.

==Goofs==
*When Mickey and Minnie kiss each other at the end, Minnie's lipstick appears on her lip, but when Minnie's mouth touches Mickey's, it vanishes out of nowhere.
*At the end of the song when we see everyone on stage, Donald only has two lipstick marks on his face.
