'''''South of the Border with Disney''''' is a 30-minute documentary released in 1942. It was shot in the same occasion ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' was, when [[Walt Disney]] and a group of eighteen artists, musicians and writers went to South America looking for inspirations for a movie. While ''Saludos Amigos'' is the result of this voyage, alternating animated shorts to the sequences from the travel that inspired them, ''South of the Border with Disney'' is more of a behind-the-scenes documentary showing only the travel and the genesis of cartoons not only for ''Saludos Amigos'' and ''The Three Caballeros'', but also some others used in later occasions. The most notable example is a female Armadillo used for a [[1943]] [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] cartoon, ''[[Pluto and the Armadillo]]''.

In [[2000]], ''South of the Border with Disney'' was released on the Gold Classic Collection DVD of ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' as an extra, and it was released again as a bonus feature on the [[2008]] ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''/''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' "Classic Caballero Collection".
