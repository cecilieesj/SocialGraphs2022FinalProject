'''''Treasure Buddies''''' is a [[2012]] Disney direct-to-DVD family film, directed by Robert Vince and produced by Anna McRoberts. It is the 6th installment in the [[Air Bud (series)|''Air Buddies'' franchise]]. The Buddies head to the ruins of Ancient Egypt, where, with the help of a monkey named [[Babi]] and a camel named [[Cammy]], explore tombs, escape booby traps, and race against a Sphynx cat named [[Ubasti]] in search of treasure. It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on DVD, Blu-ray, and as a movie download on [[January 31]], 2012.

==Plot==
The film opens with a pickpocketing monkey named [[Babi]] who tells his nephew how he met the Buddies. Their great uncle, Digger was the partner of an archaeologist, Thomas Howard, who retrieved one half of a dial which would lead to Queen Cleocatra's tomb. He never found the other half and retired. The scene then switches to present Fernfield where Thomas is giving his grandson, Pete, a tour of the Egyptian exhibit. The Buddies are also there. Pete stays behind with Thomas who gives his dog, [[MudBud]], Digger's bandanna. A British archaeologist, [[Dr. Phillip Wellington|Phillip Wellington]] along with his cat, [[Ubasti]], meets Thomas in his office and reveals to have the other half of the dial, and insists on bringing him and Pete along for the ride, but refuses to bring along MudBud due to certain allergies. Fortunately, the Buddies stowaway in Phillip's DC-3 Douglas airliner via a box of TNT.

In the climax, Phillip is revealed to be a kleptomaniacal grave robber who challenges Thomas to a fierce duel after Ubasti is turned to stone after wearing Cleocatra's collar, he escapes with it but is captured by the Nomads, tied to a camel and (per request) is placed under the custody of the British embassy. Thomas and Pete are declared national heroes along with the Buddies and the collar is put on permanent display in the museum in Fernfield.
