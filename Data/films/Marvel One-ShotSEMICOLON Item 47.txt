| Plot                    = Benny and Claire embark on a bank robbing spree after discovering a [[Chitauri]] weapon left in the destruction of [[Manhattan]], and Benny gets the object to work. [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-199999)|Agent Sitwell]] of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-199999)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is tasked with retrieving the missing item and neutralising the threat posed by the fugitive pair. He finds them in a hotel where he sets a trap and quickly overpowers them. Intrigued by the fact that all of the other recovered Chitauri weapons were rendered inert after the battle, he presses for more information. Desperate to avoid jail the couple plead with him, although Sitwell merely asks them who said anything about jail, pulling out a switchblade.

Once back at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Agent Sitwell reports to Agent Blake, and meets Blake's challenge about a tardy response time with a challenge of his own. He introduces Benny as the "latest addition to the R&D think-tank" and Claire as Blake's "new protegé". Blake is left wondering what do with Claire when he quickly establishes that she doesn't even know how to make coffee.
