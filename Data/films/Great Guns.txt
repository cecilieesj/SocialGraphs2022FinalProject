}}'''''Great Guns''''' is an [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] cartoon released on [[October 17]], [[1927]].

==Summary==
Oswald goes to war. Upon doing this, he gets quite close to being injured, gets into a dogfight with a mouse, and uses an elephant as a cannon. One cannonball from the enemies hits him and reduces him to dust. Using a cocktail shaker, Oswald's girlfriend shakes him inside of it. When she pours him out, Oswald is in the form of a rabbit again.

==Trivia==
*''Great Guns'' is featured as a transition stage in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', where it is one of three challenges Mickey must face before meeting Oswald in his fortress hideaway. The short, along with [[Trolley Troubles]] and [[Oh What a Knight]], is also mentioned by [[Gremlin Gus]] when he taught Mickey more about Oswald's past.
*During the battle sequence, Oswald is first seen in some type of trench holding a picture of his girlfriend (which he kisses repeatedly). This trench is quite similar to those used in World War One.
*Oswald's sweetheart here is a female rabbit instead of Ortensia, who is a cat.
