'''''Pinocchio''''' is a [[Disney Remakes|live-action adaptation]] of the [[1940]] [[Pinocchio (film)|animated feature film of the same name]]. The film was announced on [[April 8]], [[2015]], and premiered exclusively on [[Disney+]] on [[September 8]], [[2022]].

==Plot==
Late one night in a small Italian village in 1895, Jiminy Cricket enters the home of elderly woodcarver Geppetto, accompanied by his pet cat Figaro and goldfish Cleo. Geppetto has completed work on a marionette puppet which he names Pinocchio. Before retiring to bed, Geppetto makes a wish on a star.

A few hours later, the star magically brings Pinocchio to life and he is soon visited by the Blue Fairy, who tells him that if he acts brave, truthful and selfless, he can be a real boy. The Blue Fairy also appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong.

When Geppetto awakens and finds Pinocchio alive, he is at first shocked, but becomes overjoyed. After a few days, Geppetto decides that Pinocchio should attend school and sends him there. However, Pinocchio is soon approached by con-artist fox and cat duo "Honest" John and Gideon as they convince him that he should live a life of fame in order to truly be a real boy, when they really want to sell him to the puppet master Stromboli in exchange for wealth.

When Jiminy, with the help of a seagull named Sofia, convinces him to continue going to school, Pinocchio is thrown out on account of being a puppet. Pinocchio decides to go to Stromboli's after all with Jiminy unable stop him when John places a glass jar over him.

At Stromboli's theater, Pinocchio befriends one of Stromboli's employees Fabiana and her puppet Sabina. Pinocchio puts on a good show for the crowd but Stromboli locks him in a bird cage to prevent him from ever leaving, wanting to exploit Pinocchio for all he's worth. Soon, Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar and when he enters the coach, he manages to help Pinocchio escape when Pinocchio has him reach the key to the lock on the cage by telling lies since that makes his nose grow. Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner.

Soon, Pinocchio is swiped up by a coach full of children driven by a charismatic Coachman, who is taking the boys and girls to Pleasure Island, an isle where misbehavior is encouraged. When they reach the island, Pinocchio slowly gets disturbed by the amount of cruelty the kids commit, much to the bemusement of an unruly boy named Lampwick. When Jiminy, who got separated from Pinocchio again, makes it to the island, he soon finds out that the boys and girls there get turned into donkeys and the Coachman sells them to the salt-mines with help from his fog-like henchmen. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick get transformed himself at a pool hall and he and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail.

Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's but find that he's not home because Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio is and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. While trying to find Geppetto, Pinocchio reunites with Fabiana and Sabina, who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to the sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster named Monstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach, and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan is successful, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives a chase that ends with him and the group crashing on dry land and rendering Geppetto unconscious.

Pinocchio thinks Geppetto has died, and despairs before Geppetto comes to and soon tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart for all that he's done and they depart for home. Jiminy then breaks the fourth wall before ending the film.

==Differences from the 1940 film==
*The remake features some new characters, including Sofia the Seagull, Fabiana, and her puppet Sabina.
*Like the original film and book, this remake takes place in the 1890s as evidenced by a cuckoo clock that features Woody and Bullseye from the ''Toy Story'' franchise (since the Wild West lasted through this century).
*Most of Geppetto's clock are direct reference to other Disney movies, while the original had mundane subjects and events depicted.
*In the original film, [[Geppetto]] always wears his glasses entirely, but in this remake, he only wears them when he works.
*In the original film, after Pinocchio tells Geppetto that the Blue Fairy brought him to life, he also tells him that he got a conscience, but he does not in the remake.
*In the original film, Geppetto goes out in the rain to find Pinocchio alone, but in the remake, Figaro and Cleo accompany him in the search.
*[[Jiminy Cricket]] is made to resemble an actual cricket more than his animated counterpart; in the remake, he is seen with more obvious antennae completing his resemblance.
*While the "[[The Stupid Little Boys|naughty little boys]]" taken to Pleasure Island were all, in fact, boys, among them in the live-action remake there are also little girls. Additionally, not only the boys turn into donkeys, but the girls as well. The most likely reason that Disney included girls in the 2022 remake was to avoid being sexist, as girls can also be troublesome and disobedient like what boys can.
*The scene where Jiminy was kept awake by Geppetto's clocks was not featured in the remake.
*Unlike the original film, Geppetto does not openly reveal his wish to Figaro as he felt that it is cuckoo, as stated by a clock that went off before finishing his statement.
*The Blue Fairy is depicted as of Caucasian descent in the original movie, just like in the Italian novel said movie is based on, while in the live-action remake, she is of African-American descent.
*In the original movie, [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] is on his way to school when he runs into [[Honest John]], who persuades him to go to the theater instead and skip school. But in this remake, he actually does go to school but gets kicked out by the teacher for "being a puppet", and states that school is for "real children" and that puppets like him belong in a puppet show. Also, similar to what happens in the book, Pinocchio is convinced through the Fox's sweet talk into following them away from the straight path, in the original, Pinocchio always refused his offers, but got taken away almost by force.
*In the remake, Honest John and [[Gideon (Pinocchio)|Gideon]] trap Jiminy under a glass jar, which did not happen in the original film.
*[[Stromboli]] has three caravans, and a music machine both being pulled by two donkeys, while the original movie only has two caravans and being pulled by one horse. Also the stage is in the first caravan while the remake takes place in a kind that was inspired by a caboose.
*In the original film, after Honest John and Gideon stop Pinocchio from going to school, causing him to drop the apple for the teacher and the book Geppetto gave him, Honest John eats the apple and reads the book, and then gives them back to Pinocchio. But in the remake, he throws them away instead.
*In the original movie, Stromboli's puppet show takes place at [[Village (Pinocchio)|the Village]]. But in the remake, it takes place in the countryside outside the Village.
*In the original film, after Stromboli locks Pinocchio in the bird cage, he tells him that they will tour the world (Paris, London, Monte Carlo, Constantinople) and threatens to chop him into firewood when he gets too old to perform. But in the remake, it is never stated, although he does tell Pinocchio that he will make lots of money for himself in both.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio lies to the Blue Fairy about why he didn't go to school, while in the remake, he lies to Jiminy Cricket about not wanting to be a famous actor. In both instances, Pinocchio's nose grows whenever he lies and both characters explain the problem.
*In the original film, Jiminy watches Pinocchio perform. In the remake, he is not present due to being trapped.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio never interacts with The Coachman. But in the remake, he actually does.
*In the original Pinocchio does not question anything and just follows Lampwick's lead. In the remake, Pinocchio is uncomfortable about Pleasure Island.
*Four new songs are introduced in the remake.
**"[[When He Was Here With Me]]" and "[[Pinocchio, Pinocchio]]", both sung by Geppetto.
**"[[I Will Always Dance]]", sung by Fabiana and Sabina, two new characters introduced in the remake.
**"[[The Coachman to Pleasure Island]]", sung by The Coachman.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket search for Geppetto underwater. But in the remake, they search for him on the surface with some help from Sofia the Seagull.
*In the original film, Monstro is a sperm whale, but in the remake, he is a sea monster-hybrid crossed between a whale, a mosasaurus, a great white shark, and a kraken, as well as some features to The Terrible Dogfish from the original book.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio reunites with Geppetto while inside Monstro. But in the remake, they reunite in the open sea before encountering the whale and getting swallowed.
**Additionally, Pinocchio never got a chance to explain to Geppetto what happened to him during his adventures in the original movie. But in the remake, he is able to.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy asks Jiminy Cricket if he would like to be Pinocchio's conscience, in which he accepts. But in the remake, she asks him if he knows the difference between right and wrong, in which he does, before appointing him to be Pinocchio's temporary conscience.
**Also in the original film, he thanks her from beyond the stars for all the Blue Fairy has done, which in response, she gives him an official conscience badge at the end. But this does not happen in the remake.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio tells lies causing his nose to grow. But as it is growing, it grows longer with a bird nest on it. In this remake, his nose does not receive a bird nest as he is lying, it just grows normally longer when Jiminy tells him to stop lying.
*In the 1940 movie, Pinocchio does not wear his black vest until getting ready for school. But in this remake, he has always been wearing his black vest throughout the movie, even as an ordinary puppet and so on.
**Additionally, in the original film, Pinocchio's nose returns to normal by the Blue Fairy's magic wand. But in the remake, it shrinks after he apologizes to Jiminy for lying.
*In the original movie, [[Pinocchio (character)|Pinocchio]] wears a yellow shirt. But in this remake, he wears a white shirt.
*In the original movie, The Coachman does not have facial hair, has white hair and was fat. But in this remake, he has black hair and a mustache and has a slim appareance.
*In the original movie, the clown head seen at the entrance of Pleasure Island is seen talking, moving his lower jaw like an animatronic. However, in the remake, the clown head is stationary and does not have an animatronic jaw and thus has no dialogues unlike in the original film.
**Additionally, the animatronic man outside the Rough House section from the original film is omitted in the remake.
*Unlike the original movie, the remake does not feature smoking due to a ban that [[The Walt Disney Company]] enacted in 2015 prohibiting smoking cigars, cigarettes, marijuana, drugs, and tobacco in their movies. Also, the 6 Native American Chief stereotype statues on Pleasure Island Tobacco Row scene throwing free cigars featured in 1940 has been removed in the 2022 remake.
**Also in the original movie, the boys drink beer while on Pleasure Island. But in the remake, the children drink root beer, presumably to avoid backlash of kids drinking alcohol in modern Disney films.
*In the original movie, Jiminy discovered the naughty boys have turned into donkeys when he attempts to leave Pleasure Island after a fall out with Pinocchio. In the remake, Jiminy attempts to look for Pinocchio in the Pool Hall, but was knocked down the gutter by Lampwick where he discovered the same thing.
*In the original film, Pinocchio and Jiminy were able to escape Pleasure Island without being spotted. But in the remake, they were chased by the Coachman and his minions as they escaped the island.
*In the original film, the Blue Fairy, as a dove, gives Pinocchio and Jiminy a message that says that Geppetto was swallowed by Monstro. But in this film, it was Sofia that told them that Geppetto went to Pleasure Island to look for him, having given him a flyer of it.
*Unlike the original film, the Coachman did not bother to ask the transformed children their names to see if they talk or not.
*In the original movie, the [[Blue Fairy]] had blonde hair. But in this remake, she is bald.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy's brightness was able to light up the room while visiting Geppetto and giving Pinocchio life. But in this remake, her light is not powerful enough as the workshop is still dark while she is currently in the room.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy knows Pinocchio when she comes to grant him life. But in this remake, she does not know him and asks him what his name is.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio grows donkey ears and a tail until the end where he becomes a real boy. But in this remake, he does not have them for long as they lasted temporarily and then disappeared before going out to sea to look for Geppetto.
**In addition, the donkey parts are realistic in the original, while they are made of wood in the remake.
*It should be noted that Pinocchio is generally more distrustful of "real" people and becomes less gullible more quickly than the original version as a result of his bad experiences (as in this version even the school's headmaster treats him very poorly,) at one point even believing he can only trust his father.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio dies at the end after the chase with Monstro and, after being turned into a real boy, he is brought back to life. But in this remake, Geppetto is actually the one that almost dies but wakes up on the beach rather than at home. This was one of the deleted scenes from the original movie.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio gets home from Pleasure Island to see if Geppetto is still home at night. But in this remake, he gets home in the daytime.
*In the original film, Pinocchio has to drag Geppetto the whole time during the chase with Monstro. But in the remake, Pinocchio uses his fast feet to propel the boat
*In the original movie, Geppetto always had his clocks in his workshop all throughout. But in this remake, he had to sell them for a boat so that he can travel to Pleasure Island to look for Pinocchio, as stated by Sofia the Seagull.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio has only cried once after getting locked up in the bird cage. But in this remake, he cries one single tear in the end, after almost losing Geppetto, probably to emphasize him becoming more and more human.
*In the original movie, Jiminy sneaked a burning lump of coal to warm his backside just as he is looking around the workshop. But in this remake, he grabs a lump of coal to warm up his backside, but accidentally lights his jacket on fire.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio runs into Honest John twice. But in this remake, he only meets Honest John once.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio receives a card from Honest John for Pleasure Island and they carry him to the cart. But in the remake, Pinocchio does not get the card from Honest John for Pleasure Island. Instead, he immediately finds himself snatched onto the cart after escaping from Stromboli's carriage.
*The song "[[Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee]]" is only physically sung in one scene during the part where Pinocchio encounters Honest John and Gideon for the first time.
*In the original movie, Honest John and Gideon meet up with the Coachman at the Red Lobster Inn to discuss about Pleasure Island as an alternative plan. But in this remake, the Red Lobster Inn is not featured so they do not meet up. Pinocchio already gets involved into the scene and the Coachman is already driving his cart when he unexpectedly arrives.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy gives Pinocchio life and his strings disappear. But in this remake, she gives him life but still has his strings until she shows up.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy appears in Geppetto's workshop and gives Pinocchio life while she is in the room. But in this remake, she gives him life from the sky when her magic hits against a picture and onto him rather than her arriving to give him life.
*Jiminy did not get attacked by a flock of seagulls when he tries to get Monstro to open his mouth. The only seagull that appeared in the remake was Sofia, a seagull who is shown to be helpful to Jiminy rather than being antagonistic to him.
*Jiminy was able to reach Pinocchio after getting inside Monstro's mouth in this film.
*In the original movie, Monstro sneezed twice from Pinocchio's fire. But in the remake, he only sneezed once, but like in the original gets close into eating them again.
*In the original film, Pinocchio comes up with the idea starting a fire to make Monstro sneeze after Geppetto plans to cook fish. But in the remake, thinks of it after seeing Figaro sneeze and the oil lamp.
*Geppetto actually meets Jiminy Cricket in this version.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy appears twice. But in this remake, she only appears once, as she does not visit Pinocchio locked up in the cage.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio becomes a real boy after he is revived by the Blue Fairy. But in the remake, he becomes a real boy as he and Geppetto head back home.
*In the original movie, the story begins with Jiminy opening a book about his life in the village and about Pinocchio. But in this remake, the opening features Jiminy descending into the village when the Disney logo ends and the camera zooms onto a tarnished Jiminy Cricket before being in his new outfit.
*In the original movie, Jiminy Cricket sings "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]". But in this remake, the Blue Fairy sings it instead, but only part of it, and during the end credits, while Jiminy sings the ending verse as the film begins.
*The songs "[[Little Wooden Head]]" and "[[Give a Little Whistle]]" are not featured in this remake.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio asks the Blue Fairy if he is a real boy and she answers his question saying he is not because the only way he can become a real boy making Geppetto's wish come true would be entirely up to him. But in this remake, he asks her again if he his a real boy and answers his question that he is, even though he is not at the moment.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio is clearly seen as a real boy at end after he wakes up. But in this remake, he is not seen as a real boy because of him and Geppetto walking home with his face not showing just as the movie ends and the book closes.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio turns into a real boy at home. But in this remake, he turns into a real boy on the beach, but not seen just as he is walking home with Geppetto.
*In the original movie, the Blue Fairy turns Pinocchio into a real boy with her magic wand. But in this remake, she does not do anything to turn him into a real boy. The magical blue light located down the tunnel just as he is going home actually transforms him into a real boy.
*In the original movie, Geppetto wears a red nightcap while going to bed. But in this remake, he wears a white nightcap.
*In the original movie, Figaro sleeps on a regular bed with a blanket and pillow. But in this remake, he sleeps in a normal cat bed.
*In the original movie, Figaro opens the window for Geppetto and sits on it while Geppetto is making his wish. But in this remake, Geppetto opens the window himself and makes his wish while Figaro is not sitting on the window.
*In the original movie, Figaro sleeps with Geppetto in his bed after he makes his wish. But in this remake, Geppetto sleeps alone while Figaro is still in his bed.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio sleeps with Geppetto and Figaro in Geppetto's bed. But in this remake, Pinocchio has his very own bed to sleep in rather than them sleeping together.
*In the original movie, Geppetto is too busy finishing up Pinocchio but doesn't expect anyone knocking on the door this late asking for a cuckoo clock. But in this remake, a man stops by Geppetto's workshop in the middle of the night asking for a clock while being too busy working on Pinocchio.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio has always had his red feather attached to his hat even at the start where he is an ordinary puppet. But in this remake, Geppetto puts the red feather on his hat after working on him.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio has mostly kept asking the repeated question "why?" and saying "uh uh" shaking his head meaning "no". But in this remake, he does not ask "why?" or say "uh uh" throughout the movie.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio receives life from the Blue Fairy and wakes up normally and immediately talks regularly. But in the remake, he wakes up repeating everything they say before fixing his speech.
*In the original movie, the village bell rings for all the kids to wake up in the morning for school. But in this remake, a bell is not seen or heard in the village as everyone wakes themselves up for school, including Pinocchio.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio looked excited for Pleasure Island while acting bad like the other kids. But in this remake, he does not look too comfortable about it and mentions that none of the bad stuff everyone is doing is a good idea and does not act bad at all.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio falls on the floor and accidentally wakes up Geppetto from the big crash after the "Give a Little Whistle" number and thinks that there is someone in his workshop when he did not know at first that Pinocchio is alive. But in this remake, Geppetto wakes up to the sound of a window latch closing loudly after the Blue Fairy leaves, and Pinocchio is still sitting on the shelf not doing anything.
*In the original movie, Geppetto uses his gun to look around for whoever is in his house and shoot it, then Pinocchio scares Figaro causing him to jump inside his pajamas, making his gun go off and trigger his cuckoo clocks, and after he finds Pinocchio on the floor, Geppetto picks him up and gets surprised that he is talking, causing him to pour water on himself thinking that he is dreaming. But in this remake, Geppetto wakes up holding a candle while walking around, but does not have his gun, then asks Pinocchio if he heard something which he says so which surprises Geppetto, throwing Figaro into the air and trigger his cuckoo clocks, but does not pour water on himself.
*In the original movie, all of the kids Geppetto calls Pinocchio's classmates are the same size as Pinocchio, especially the kids he goes to Pleasure Island with. But in this remake, all the kids are taller and bigger than Pinocchio leaving him the only kid that is more tiny.
*In the original movie, Gideon accidentally hits Honest John with a hammer and gets his head stuck in his hat, then Gideon tries to help him using a cane, then goes flying against a tree and lands in a pond of water. But in this remake, Honest John is simply knocked out unconscious, later Gideon attempts to squash Jiminy on his head, knocking himself out as well.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio just enjoys his walk to school and does not stop until he gets there except running into Honest John and Gideon. But in this remake, he walks to school until he finds a pile of manure on the ground when that was nothing to see in the original.
*In the original movie, Jiminy first visits Geppetto's workshop and Geppetto is not seen anywhere when he first drops in because he immediately makes himself at home looking around and spots Pinocchio sitting on the shelf just until Geppetto comes downstairs to work on him and finish him up. But in this remake, Geppetto is already seen working on Pinocchio even when Jiminy first drops in.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio didn't have a mouth or any eyebrows when Jiminy finds him on the shelf and until Geppetto comes to finish him up. But in this remake, Jiminy first comes in and Pinocchio already has a mouth and eyebrows as Geppetto is clearly seen already working on him.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio does not listen to Jiminy after explaining to him about what he should tell Honest John about going to school as he suddenly ignores and continues pursuing his adventure to the theater. But in this remake, Pinocchio actually does listen to Jiminy taking his advice about going to school even though he gets kicked out and Honest John brings him with them to the theater.
*In the original movie, Honest John wears green clothes, a green hat, and a blue cape. But in this remake, he wears different clothes such as a red shirt, brown pants, and a black hat, but he still keeps his blue cape, though he never had a chain on him in the original, but for this remake, he has a chain.
*In the original movie, Pleasure Island never even had cuckoo clocks for the kids to break and destroy. But in this remake there are cuckoo clocks at Pleasure Island and Pinocchio claims that they look like Geppetto's clocks.
*In the original movie, Stromboli angrily yells at Pinocchio stomping his hardest with a threat telling him to stop his protests and he gets scared by his furious temper tantrum. But in this remake, Stromboli does not stomp or yell at Pinocchio telling him to not protest, he just locks him up in the cage and leaves.
*In the original movie, Stromboli locks up Pinocchio in the cage then leaves closing the door when the light turns off just as he gets in his cart and starts driving away leaving Pinocchio all alone in the cage and Stromboli does not come back. But in this remake, Stromboli comes back in the cart twice checking in on Pinocchio and explaining that he is going to make him lots of money.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio and Jiminy both cry together in the cage feeling guilty for their previous mistakes. But in this remake, they do not even cry after Jiminy arrives to free Pinocchio from the cage, they just find a way to get themselves out of it.
*In the original movie, Jiminy tries freeing Pinocchio from the cage going inside the lock seeing what he can do, but is unable to unlock it. But in this remake, Jiminy doesn't go inside the lock. They instead grab the key with the help of Pinocchio's lies for his nose to grow out.
*In the original movie, during Pinocchio singing "I've Got No Strings", the Dutch puppet, the French puppet and the Russian puppet all take turns surprisingly showing up scaring Pinocchio with how they drop in, the Dutch puppet shows up until her clones come in as well as the French puppet with her clones that are a bit different from her but the Russian puppet becomes introduced with no clones of her but with the Cossack puppets appearing and just as the song ends, the Cossack puppets crowd hug him saying his final lines "there are no strings on me". But in this remake, the Dutch and Russian puppets are not featured except the French puppet being featured dancing with her clones being the same as her with the part taking over the Dutch puppets where they dance and when Pinocchio ends the song, the Cossack puppets don't hug him when he says "there are no strings on me", besides Fabiana and Sabina are newly introduced so they obviously replaced the Dutch and Russian puppets but appear more in the movie rather than just the theater.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio accidentally falls down the stairs and lands face first getting his nose stuck through a hole on the floor where he is able to lift the piece of wood with the hole his nose is stuck in. Then Stromboli angrily slams it off Pinocchio's nose and yells at him for messing up just before he sees the audience laughing and immediately lets it slide. But in this remake, he does it again but only this time, Sabina helps him get it off his nose instead of Stromboli, but in a nice way since Fabiana and Sabina are really good friends to Pinocchio.
*In the original movie, Geppetto goes out in the storm looking for Pinocchio and calls him but his voice is lost in the noise of booming thunder after seeing Stromboli pass by him. But in this remake, his voice is not lost in the thunder while calling for Pinocchio, he just keeps looking and calling his name nonstop.
*In the original movie, the cart where Pinocchio is locked up in the cage only has one door where Stromboli exits out and Jiminy Cricket enters in. But in this remake, there are actually two doors for it where Jiminy enter from the other way.
*In the original movie, after Pinocchio finishes "I've Got No Strings", the audience begins throwing money at him after the Cossack puppets fly up off him and he wears one of their hats along with the piece of wood stuck on his nose. but in this remake, Pinocchio just wears his own hat and has no wood on his nose while the audience throws money at him on stage.
*While Pinocchio is basically forced to go to Pleasure Island by Honest John, in the original, the remake gives him the choice of whether he wants or does not want to go, only accepting to, like in the book, via peer pressure.
*While it is pretty much explicit that Pinocchio turns into a real boy in the original, the remake leaves it implied such transformation (although showing Pinocchio, from behind, turning into a human), probably to emphasize how it matters more that he learned how to be a human, rather than becoming one himself.
*While in the original Pinocchio has to prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish to become a real boy, the remake does a better job to show him learning these attributes. In the original Pinocchio surely proves himself brave by saving his father from Monstro, but doesn't really prove himself truthful by lying to the Fairy nor he proves unselfish by ignoring Jiminy's advices, leaving his "best friend" behind without looking back to a horrible fate and not being concerned when the pets are lost at sea. The remake shows again his bravery with Monstro, but does show a truthful trait when he uses his lies to his advantage and then reverts his elongated nose all by himself, as well an unselfish side when Pinocchio refuses to become a star since he choses to go looking for his father instead. This last action also makes his donkey ears and tail disappear, while the in the original he kept his semi-donkey appearance for the rest of the movie.
*In the original movie, Lampwick has red short hair and his teeth sticking out from his mouth. But in this remake, he just has his normal teeth directly inside mouth and has black longer hair.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio introduces himself to Lampwick but has not really been referred by any kind of nickname except with Pinocchio calling him Lampy. But in this remake, Lampwick calls Pinocchio, "Slats".
*In the original movie, Pinocchio hangs out with Lampwick at the pool hall and he looks sick and dizzy after smoking a cigarette while playing pool. But in this remake, he does not get dizzy playing pool, he just tries playing normally looking all good as always.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio notices donkey ears and a tail after seeing Lampwick destroying everything in the pool hall and throwing them around because of his donkey look. But in this remake, he does not notice growing donkey ears and a tail until looking in the mirror.
*In the original movie, Geppetto finds Pinocchio with donkey ears and a tail and gets so surprised how that happened. But in this remake, Geppetto does not catch Pinocchio with donkey ears and a tail because they immediately disappear just before Geppetto would almost notice Pinocchio's donkey transformation since he somehow got out of that incident.
*In the original movie, Stromboli does not notice Pinocchio escaping from his caravan as he just keeps on going departing from the village. But in this remake, he goes to jail for what he tried to do to Pinocchio and all the other trouble he has caused but he does not go to jail in the original.
*In the original movie, Stromboli uses an orchestra for Pinocchio to sing "[[I've Got No Strings]]". But in this remake, he has a big music machine for the music Pinocchio sings from.
*In the original movie, besides Pinocchio being the only living puppet that can talk, the Dutch puppet and Russian puppet are able to talk but their eyes and mouths do not move when they are talking, because as of this remake, they are obviously replaced and Sabina is able to talk too. But she is the only puppet alongside Pinocchio at the theater being able to move her eyes and mouth when she is talking.
*In the original movie, during the "I've Got No Strings" sequence, Pinocchio dances and spins his body like a tornado with the cossack puppets. But in this remake, Pinocchio does not spin like a twister and neither do the cossack puppets, he just dances as fast as he can until his feet catch on fire while Stromboli extinguishes the fire caused by Pinocchio himself.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio just dances with the cossack puppets until they crowd him after singing and dancing. But in this remake, Stromboli splashes water on Pinocchio only because his feet were on fire but he never got splashed by any water in the original.
*In the original movie, the cossack puppets yell out "Hey" while they're dancing with Pinocchio and he says "Hey" once too. But in this remake, they do not say "Hey" nor does Pinocchio, they just dance like silent puppets.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio is the major character but has not got nearly much focus since there were a few scenes with Honest John and Gideon experiencing Stromboli's poster on the wall and being met up with the Coachman at the Red Lobster Inn. Also, Jiminy Cricket looking for Pinocchio wherever he is, even Geppetto at home during dinnertime wondering where he is and also looks for him. But in this remake, Pinocchio gets a lot more focus as he almost appears in every scene all throughout this remake.
*In the original movie, Geppetto is visited at his workshop during dinnertime after Pinocchio performing at the theater and then being visited at Stromboli's caravan where Pinocchio is. But in this remake, Geppetto's workshop is visited before Pinocchio performing at the theater and then brought to Stromboli's caravan right after the show at the theater.
*In the original movie, Jiminy Cricket immediately agrees to be Pinocchio's conscience due to the Blue Fairy's attracted love, kindness and respect but he does not state how long he wants to be his conscience but possibly his permanent conscience. But in this remake, he makes it clear saying he just wants to be Pinocchio's temporary conscience and does not seem that interested in the Blue Fairy that much even though she is still beautiful.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio grows donkey ears and a tail and immediately notices them. But in this remake, he does not notice them until looking in the mirror.
*In the original movie, Geppetto says the full "Star Light, Star Bright" poem before making his wish on the wishing star and says the whole thing. But in this remake, he forgets how it goes and does not finish it, he just makes his wish after saying part of it.
*In the original movie, Lampwick is really good at pool shooting every ball in a new unique way getting it in the holes. But in this remake, he is not as good how he used to be in the original because he makes a few shots he fails at where some balls do not aim for the pockets.
*In the original movie, Lampwick whistles Honest John's song "Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee" while playing pool. But in this remake, he does not whistle the song while playing the game as he is just too busy chatting with Pinocchio.
*In the original movie, there is already burning coal sitting out from the fireplace where Jiminy grabs a piece with his umbrella. But in the remake, the fireplace spits out a burning lump of coal for him to warm up his backside where he has no need using his umbrella.
*In the original movie, Lampwick yells "Mama" just as his donkey transformation is starting and both Pinocchio and his shadow are seen on the wall. But in this remake, he does not say "Mama" or anything as he is just too late, and only his shadow is seen on the wall where Pinocchio is.
*In the original movie, even though Geppetto and Jiminy have not met, Geppetto has never once called Jiminy by his name. But in this remake, it is the first time Geppetto actually reveals Jiminy Cricket's name.
*In the original movie, as soon as Pinocchio arrives to Pleasure Island, he carries an ice cream cone and pie and throws them away after Lampwick tells him about poking someone in the nose. But in this remake, he does not carry any ice cream or pie with him after arriving.
*In the original movie, Pinocchio and Lampwick blend in with the other kids acting bad on Pleasure Island. But in this remake, since Pinocchio is way too uncomfortable, all they do is ride in a boat all throughout Pleasure Island as a tour just watching the kids act bad rather than blending in.
*In the original movie, the scene where the ''Pinocchio'' storybook appears was at the opening of the film where Jiminy Cricket opens the storybook after singing "When You Wish Upon a Star". While in the remake, the ''Pinocchio'' storybook is seen at the film's very last shot seen at the end of the film before the credits. On a related note in the original film's ending, it shows the camera zooming out to see the landscape at a quiet night with a starry sky in the background at the film's last shot just before cutting to a title reading "The End" and does not feature the storybook seen at the beginning of the film.

==Trivia==
*This is Disney's second live-action film adaptation of ''Pinocchio'', after ''[[Geppetto (film)|Geppetto]]''.
*This is the fourth time [[Robert Zemeckis]] has worked for Disney, the first was with ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', the second was with ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', and the third one was with ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]''.
*This is the first time since [[2011]]'s ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' that Robert Zemeckis has worked with Disney again.
*This is the fourth time that [[Tom Hanks]] has worked with Robert Zemeckis again, the first was with ''[[Wikipedia:Forrest Gump (1994 film)|Forrest Gump]]'', the second was with ''[[Wikipedia:Cast Away (2000 film)|Cast Away]]'', and the third was with ''[[Wikipedia:The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]''.
*This is the second time that [[Luke Evans]] does a role for a Disney film, after playing [[Gaston]] in the [[2017]] live-action adaptation of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.
**This is also be the second time that Luke Evans plays a classic Disney Villain.
*This is [[Keegan-Michael Key]]'s second role in a Disney remake, after [[Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Kamari]] in the 2019 adaptation of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''.
*This is Tom Hanks and Keegan-Michael Key's second Disney film together after ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.
*Many of the clocks in Geppetto's workshop are based on Disney characters, with clocks featuring [[Donald Duck]], [[Simba]] (as a cub), [[Zazu]], and [[Rafiki]] from ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Aurora]] and [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', [[Snow White]], some of the dwarfs, and the Evil Queen (in hag form) from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], [[Woody]] and [[Bullseye]] from the ''[[Toy Story]]'' franchise, and [[Roger Rabbit|Roger]] and [[Jessica Rabbit]] from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
**One of the cuckoo birds also resembles a [[Porg]] from ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''.
*When Honest John attempts to spell Pinnochio's name but struggles after the first four letters due to his illiteracy, he adds "Maybe a 'K'". This is very similar to [[LeFou]] trying to spell [[Gaston|Gaston's]] name during the latter's [[Gaston (song)|title song]] in the 2017 remake of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', but struggling after the first four letters (due to his own illiteracy), after which he comments on how he "believe[s] there's another 'T'" in Gaston's name.
*One of the stage names Honest John comes up with for Pinocchio is Chris Pine, which is possibly a reference/in-joke to [[Chris Pine|the actor of the same name]].
*One of the backdrops during Pinocchio's performance in Stromboli's show features a castle that resembles the [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]], although it more closely resembles the castle from the [[Walt Disney Pictures logo]] variant seen in earlier [[Pixar]] films.
*During Pinocchio's performance of "[[I've Got No Strings]]" in Stromboli's show, he accidentally rubs his wooden feet against the wooden floor, starting a fire. This does not happen in the original film.
*When Jiminy Cricket sees all of the boys and girls who have turned into donkeys on Pleasure Island get locked up in cages, he remarks that he thinks he is in "H-E-double hockey sticks." This is supposedly a reference to the 2020 Disney/Pixar film, ''[[Soul]]'', where [[Joe Gardner]] believes the same thing after he ends up in the You Seminar.
*Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket's designs for this film resemble those of their original 1940 animated counterparts.
*Many of the scenes featured from the original 1940 film, including smoking tobacco pipes and cigars, drinking alcohol, and Native American stereotypes on Tobacco Row in Pleasure Island are removed. The beer is changed to Root Beer and the kids eat junk food.
*Pinocchio actually goes to school in this movie, but immediately gets kicked out by the school teacher.
*This is the second Pinocchio movie to feature an African-American version of The Blue Fairy. The first was Cyberina voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in the 2004 direct-to-video movie ''Pinocchio 3000'' released by Lionsgate.
**This is also the third adaptation to feature such a version. The first before the aforementioned movie was an episode of the HBO Family series ''Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child'' where she was voiced by Della Reese.
***In that same episode, Pinocchio was voiced by [[Will Smith]], Jiminy Cricket's counterpart was a termite named "Woody" voiced by [[Chris Rock]], Gideon's counterpart was named "Sporty" and was voiced by Franklyn Ajaye, and Stromboli's counterpart was named "Mr. Buzzard" and was voiced by [[Garrett Morris]].
