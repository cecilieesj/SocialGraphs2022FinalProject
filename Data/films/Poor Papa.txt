'''''Poor Papa''''' is the first [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] cartoon created by [[Walt Disney]] for [[Charles Mintz]], created in [[1927]].

==Plot==
Oswald gets a visit from the stork, having some babies delivered to him. He then gets another visit...and another one... and another...and another...and so on. Oswald is forced to rely on various methods to stop the continual flow of babies.

==Response==
The short was met with criticism by Mintz and Universal heads, who complained at how old Oswald looked. The next Oswald cartoon, ''[[Trolley Troubles]]'', featured a much younger version of Oswald and was met with much more positive feedback then its predecessor. ''Poor Papa'' wasn't released until June 11, 1928.

''Poor Papa'' was once thought to be "lost". Recently, Bonhams auctioned off an incomplete 16mm print of the film, going from $15,000 to $20,000, and is one of three copies known to exist.
