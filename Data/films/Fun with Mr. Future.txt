'''''Fun with Mr. Future''''' is a [[1982]] live-action/animated short film from [[Walt Disney Productions]].
==Synposis==
An animatronic talking-head replica of [[Abraham Lincoln]] (voiced by [[Phil Proctor]]) hosts a tour of what the future will look like.

==Production==
''Fun with Mr. Future'' originally began development as an [[Epcot]] television special, whose crew included Darrell Van Citters, Mike Giamo, [[Joe Ranft]], [[Mike Gabriel]], [[Tad Stones]] and [[Brian McEntee]]. At the time, this team was also involved in the development stages of what would become ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' ([[1987]]) and ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' ([[1988]]). After Disney shelved the Epcot special, Tom Wilhite allowed them to use footage from the project and edit it into a new animated short. The resulting work marked the directorial debut of animator Darrell Van Citters, who began his career at the Disney studios.

==Release==
Disney released the film in Los Angeles on [[October 27]], [[1982]]. No other public screenings took place until October [[2010]], when New York's Museum of Modern Art featured it in a program commemorating the publication of John Canemaker's book, ''Two Guys Named Joe''. According to Tad Stones, "[Working on it] was a lot of fun but I couldn't even tell you where you find it now. It's one of those gems even Disney doesn't know it has. I went to a comic convention and was surprised to see its cels for sale." Filmmaker Garrett Gilchrist restored the film from VHS and uploaded it to Youtube's [http://youtu.be/M0qCfuZqqsc The Thief Archive] in September [[2014]].
