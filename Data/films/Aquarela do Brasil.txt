'''''Aquarela do Brasil''''' is the animated short and a [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] cartoon of the segment of ''[[Saludos Amigos]].'' It was reissued as a stand-alone short on [[June 24]], [[1955]].

==Synopsis==
A short impressionistic view of [[Brazil]] turns into [[Donald Duck]] getting dance lessons from [[José Carioca]]. This short helped introduce North Americans to the songs "[[Aquarela do Brasil (song)|Aquarela do Brasil]]" and "[[wikipedia:Tico-Tico no Fubá|Tico-Tico no Fubá]]".

==Plot==
An artist draws a landscape of Brazil and adds color to match the music. After the artist draws a bee and then gets eaten by a flower, it transforms into Donald Duck who ends up in the Brazilian landscape. The artist then draws José Carioca, a green parrot who greets Donald. He constantly asks him in Portuguese but Donald gives him a translation book. José then takes Donald to the town to show him the rhythm of samba. Arriving at a café, Donald then grabs a drink whom he thinks it is soda pop, but José tells him that the drink he is using is cachaça. Donald tastes the cachaça and José tells him that he is now used to doing the samba.

With Donald used to the samba, the artist draws musicians playing samba music as we see silhouettes of Donald dancing with a beautiful woman at Copacabana. The segment then ends as we see the Brazilian landscape at night, ending the film.
