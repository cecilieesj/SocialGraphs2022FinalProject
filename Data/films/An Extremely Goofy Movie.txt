'''''An Extremely Goofy Movie''''' is a [[2000]] American direct-to-video animated comedy film made by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. Directed by Douglas McCarthy, it is the sequel to ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', featuring the return of characters from the television series ''[[Goof Troop]]''. The story follows Max's freshman year at college, which is once again compounded by his father's presence when Goofy arrives at the same college to get a degree.

The film received mixed reviews, but earned a slightly higher score on Rotten Tomatoes.

==Plot==
A few years after the events of the [[A Goofy Movie|first film]], [[Max Goof]] (now a high school graduate) and his best friends [[P.J.]] and [[Bobby Zimuruski|Bobby]] prepare to leave for [[Unnamed college|college]] and to participate in the College [[wikipedia:X Games|X-Games]]. [[Goofy]] and [[Pete]] prepare a goodbye barbecue for the boys the day before they leave. Max says to his friends that he is anxious to get away from his father's overprotective attitude, while P.J. gloomily comments that his father plans to turn his room into a bowling alley as soon as he leaves. Goofy reminds Pete of how fast the children have grown up but Pete says that the raising of children is a nuisance. While they are practicing, Goofy reminds them that they go to college to become important people and uses a horseshoe game to make an example to them. That night, while Max is packing his suitcase, Goofy gives him his father's adding machine as a gift for his maturity before tucking him in. He looks at his sleeping son tearfully.

The next morning, Goofy is preparing a big breakfast for Max, but Max rushes out with a few hasty goodbyes, eager to leave. Bobby arrives in his van with P.J. to pick up Max, who bids farewell to Goofy and begins his trip. Although Max is happy to leave, Goofy doesn't take it so well and starts to develop [[wikipedia:Empty nest syndrome|empty-nest syndrome]]. He goes in Max's empty bedroom, folds a pair of Max's socks, picks up Max's old teddy bear, holds it close to his heart, and sits on Max's bed and starts to sobs.

During their trip to college, Max, P.J. and Bobby crash through a cornfield, but make it safely. As they enter college, they approach the house of the [[The Gammas|Gamma Mu Mu]] fraternity, the one that has won all previous College X-Games editions, and their leader, [[Bradley Uppercrust III]]. The boys get off the van and begin skateboarding around the place. Bradley becomes impressed with Max's skills and he and his gang begin to follow him. Max and his friends then enter into the Bean Scene Cafe, a beatnik cafe. Bradley introduces himself and his right hand Tank to Max. Brad offers Max a place in the Gammas fraternity, but only if he leaves behind P.J. and Bobby. Without hesitation, Max refuses, which earns him the ire of Bradley, who sets his gang on them. However their behavior is not welcomed by the regulars, and they are snapped out of the bar; but not before Max and Bradley make a bet with each other, where the loser of the X-Games will be towel boy to the winner.

Meanwhile, Goofy's empty nest syndrome gets the better of him and while daydreaming, he causes a huge explosion at his dead-end toy factory job. He is fired on the spot by his elderly and furious boss. At an unemployment office, Goofy admits he never completed college (only completing 3 years), and the unemployment lady tells him that he must get a degree to get any kind of job. So Goofy goes to the same college Max is attending, much to his son's horror and embarrassment. Max, PJ and Bobby all panic at the idea of Goofy's overprotective and embarrassing nature getting in the way of college life. And these fears are validated when Goofy begins babying Max once again, as well as disturbing their free time and training practice. Desperate, Max foists him off at the library to get a library card, where Goofy meets the beautiful librarian, [[Sylvia Marpole]], who shares in his love for 1970's stuff.

Sylvia and Goofy decide to go on a date Saturday night. Goofy goes to tell his son about the good news in the middle of his skateboard practice, and unintentionally performs some impressive moves. The Gammas see this and Bradley decides to have Goofy to join their fraternity, so Max convinces his father to join so that he can be distracted. At the nightclub, the boys encounter the [[Beret Girl]], whom P.J. strikes up an surprising romance with, while Goofy and Sylvia dance together on the dance floor. After this, romance blossoms between the two. Goofy begins spending most of his time with Sylvia and the Gammas.

Then the day of the X-Games qualifiers arrive and Team 99 (Max, Bobby and P.J.) choose Max as their first competitor and the Gammas choose Goofy. At Bradley's request, [[Tank]] puts a small rocket on the back of Goofy's skateboard to assure their winning. This works and Goofy gets a near-perfect score from the judges.

During Max's turn, Bradley makes him trip over several times by reflecting light from his mirror into his eyes, and Team 99 barely makes it to the competition with the scores Max gets from the judges. Upstaged by Goofy, Max gets angry with him and practically cuts him out of his life, telling him to "leave him alone and get his own life". Goofy becomes depressed and loses focus on everything, which makes him fail on a midterm and even forgets a date with Sylvia. Goofy goes back home for a barbecue with Pete, and when Goofy considers dropping out of college, Pete tells him to regain his focus.

At the Bean Scene, Max considers transferring to another college but is convinced to stay by Beret Girl, P.J., and Bobby. Goofy goes back to college and makes up with Sylvia, remembering that he really came to college to get his degree, and she helps him study for his exams. Goofy gets straight A's and decides to leave the Gammas since they are just another distraction. Instead, the Gammas "leave" him by literally throwing him out of their fraternity house. When he goes back into the house to return the Gammas' pledge pin, Goofy overhears them talking about cheating at the X-Games.

On the day of the competition, Goofy tries to warn Max, who dismisses him. In the competition, many teams are eliminated due to the Gammas' cheating, and only they and Team 99 make it to the final. Before the final race, Bradley blasts P.J. to the sky with a pair of rockets attached to his roller skates and out of the competition. Max realizes that Brad tricked him into disowning his father and Goofy was telling the truth about Brad's cheating, and he is told by the referee that if he doesn't get a third member for the team in less than a minute, they will be disqualified, making the Gammas winner by default. Max tells his father via Jumbotron that he's sorry and needs him, and Goofy arrives at the start line and prepares to compete.

After a long competition, Slouch (one of the Gammas) has his legs and arms tied together due to Goofy crashing into him, Bobby is taken out of competition due to his bike being sabotaged by the Gammas, and Goofy loses his equipment and crashes into Bradley. Bradley, ignored by Tank, prepares to blast Max on the final straight, but Goofy knocks him out with a horseshoe using a move he learned from Pete. However, Brad accidentally pushes the blast button with his chin when he fell on it. Max crashes into Tank, and the two crash into a gigantic X-Games logo, setting it on fire. While Bradley heads for the finish, uncaring of Tank being in danger, Goofy runs in to save his son. Goofy and Max rescue the trapped Tank, and as Brad is approaching the finish line, Max, Tank, and Goofy emerge from the burning logo, and Max beats Brad with the help of Tank and Goofy boosting his skateboard.

As Bradley coldly but calmly congratulates Max, Max calls off the bet, and he reminds him of Tank, whom he abandoned in the fire. Tank promptly grabs Brad and hurls him into an X-Games blimp in retaliation for his betrayal.

Months later, Goofy gets his degree, and Max gives him the X-Games trophy as an apology gift for being mean to him from before by writing an inscription that says, "I might not be your little boy anymore, but I'll always be your son", with a throwback to the first movie where he reminds Goofy that while he may not be his little boy now, he will always be his son no matter how grownup he is. Sylvia then arrives in her car and leaves with Goofy for a celebratory picnic at the beach while Max continues his college life.

==Trivia==
===Continuity notes===
*Chronologically-speaking, the events of this movie would actually be set earlier than its initial release. According to several pieces of officially-licensed merchandise, ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' is set during the year of its release, [[1995]]. In the TV documentary ''[[The Making of A Goofy Movie]]'', that film's director, [[Kevin Lima]], declared Max to be 14 years old during the events of that movie. Since 14 is the youngest that a person can be upon entering high school in the United States (without skipping any grades), Max's being 14 at the end of a high school year in ''A Goofy Movie'' would mean that he had just finished 9th Grade in that movie. So, if Max finished 9th Grade in 1995, he would logically finish 12th Grade three years later in 1998. Assuming that he started college later than same year (without taking a year off between high school and college), Max's first year of college seen in this movie would be from 1998 to 1999, placing the events of this movie during the 1998–1999 school year.
*The majority of this movie seems to span only a few weeks, going from the beginning of the school year to the week of the first semester's mid-term exams (said week is book-ended by the two days of the College X Games), spanning just the first half of the Fall semester. Meanwhile, the final scene of the movie, which takes place on the day of Goofy's graduation, is instead set many months later at the end of the school year in Spring. This means that a whole semester-and-a-half (including the Winter Holidays and Spring Break) goes by completely unseen between the movie's last and second-to-last scenes.
*Max's bedroom is both a completely different shape and in a different part of the house than in both the previous film and in ''[[Goof Troop]]''. Likewise, while the interior of Goofy's house doesn't look exactly the same as it did in ''Goof Troop'', both the kitchen and living room are at least located in the same places inside the house, while the wall that the house's staircase runs up is now on the opposite side of the stairs from where it was in ''Goof Troop''. These changes in the house's appearance can largely be chalked up to artistic liberty rather than assuming that Goofy and Max moved into a new house, since the house's exterior also looked even more different from ''Goof Troop'' in ''A Goofy Movie'', while the house's exterior in this movie looks less different from how it looked in ''Goof Troop''.
*As a nod to ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'', Max's Old Stuff Bear from the "A Very Goofy Christmas" segment makes a reappearance (albeit colored yellow instead of brown) in the scene where Goofy helps Max pack for college, as the subject of a minor argument between the two of them on whether or not Max should take Old Stuffed Bear with him to college.
*In what might be less of a nod and more of a coincidence, Goofy's lucky horseshoe in this movie originally appeared briefly in the ''Goof Troop'' episode "[[Rally Round the Goof]]".
*When Tank (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]) is introduced to Max, he says "You're class, the high kind!" This line is almost exactly the same as a line spoken by another of Brad Garrett's characters, the Big Boy Bandit, from the ''Goof Troop'' episode "[[To Catch a Goof]]", in which the burglar, upon trying to steal [[Peg Pete|Peg]]'s jewelry, said about the jewelry "You're class, baby, the high kind."
*During the final race of the X Games, Goofy rides his bike over some hills while his body remains in place, with his limbs stretching like an accordion as the bike goes up and down each hill. This animation is recycled from the ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' cartoon "[[How to Ride a Bicycle]]".
*This film marks P.J.’s last animated appearance until making a photo cameo in the ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|DuckTales]]'' episode, "[[Quack Pack!]]", 2 decades later in which, also coincided with it's 20th Anniversary as well.

===Continuity errors===
*Near the beginning of the movie, it is revealed that Pete can't wait for P.J. to leave home for college. First, P.J. laments, "My dad's been counting down the days until he can turn my bedroom into a bowling alley." Then, Pete himself says to Goofy, "Well, Goof, the way I see it it's my last night of babysitting and I'm a free man!" before cheering loudly in excitement over his forthcoming freedom. This attitude of Pete's, however, makes no sense in the larger context of everything that's come before, as it is out-of-character for him in comparison to his attitudes in both ''Goof Troop'' and ''A Goofy Movie''. In the former, several episodes showed that Pete loved having P.J. around as cheap labor for chores and yardwork, while in the latter, Pete spoke of how important it is for he and P.J. to spend time with each other and strengthen their bond as father and son (even if that still meant having P.J. around to act like a servant to Pete). In contrast, Pete's desire for P.J. to move out in this movie is completely at odds with either previous depiction, since Pete would be losing the free help for chores and simple labor tasks that Pete hates doing himself.
*When Max is asked by a girl at Club Rave to save a dance with her for later, P.J. and Bobby laugh at the idea of Max dancing. This is direct contradiction of how, in the ''Goof Troop'' episode "[[Puppy Love (Goof Troop)|Puppy Love]]", Max not only knows how to dance but dances very well, and very much to P.J.'s awareness.

===Real-world references===
*The opening of the film, with Goofy attempting to hit a gong with the picture of his face that used to open his cartoons on it, is a parody of the old [[wikipedia:Rank Organisation|Rank Organisation]] logo.
*The van Bobby owns resembles a first generation Volkswagen Type 2.
*The plot of this film is very similar to the [[1986]] comedy, ''Back to School'', starring [[Rodney Dangerfield]]:
**Both feature fathers attending the same college as their son.
**Both feature the son competing with a rival in a sport.
**Both see the father fall in love with and eventually date one of the college's faculty members.
**Both see the son deciding to leave college due to the father's popularity, then deciding against it.
**Both have the father in an argument with both his girlfriend and his son, and both arguments get patched up at the end.
**Both have the father graduate at the end.
**Both have the fathers partially helping their sons in their college life.
*There are also differences between the films:
**Goofy never attended his senior year, and Dangerfield's character, Thornton Melon, never attended college at all.
**Goofy went to college so he could graduate and earn a degree; Thornton went to make sure his son, Jason, didn't quit.
**Goofy falls in love with the librarian, and Thornton falls in love with his poetry professor.
**Max and Goofy compete in X-Games sports, Thornton and Jason compete in high diving. Also, Max and Goofy are on different teams (at first) and later compete on the same team. Thornton and Jason are always on the same team throughout their time in college.
**Jason started off as a towel boy, while Max was only briefly threatened with the possibility of becoming one.
**Max was horrified and embarrassed to have Goofy attending college with him, while Jason was simply surprised but intrigued by the idea of his father joining him.
**Max disowned Goofy after a heated argument over Max's desire to have his own life but reconciled with him at the end, while Jason only got angry with Thornton over a misunderstanding, but did not disown his father.
**Max quickly left for college at the start of the film, while Jason was already attending college years before.
**Goofy suffers from empty nest syndrome following Max's departure, while Thornton was upset that Jason canceled a planned visit.
**Thornton divorces his wife Vanessa; Goofy does not do this since his wife never makes an appearance.
**Thornton's childhood was explored in the start of the film; this does not happen for Goofy.
**Goofy left college with Sylvia at the end of the film, while Thornton stayed at college to give out a commencement speech.
**Thornton meets with his father at the beginning of the film; Goofy's father never appears at all.
**Jason was unhappy with his college life at first, while Max enjoyed his life there.
**Goofy formerly worked at a factory but got fired for his clumsiness, while Thornton owned lots of businesses.
**Thornton changes his last name, while Goofy does not since he doesn't have a last name.
**Jason had only one friend attending college with him, while Max had two.
**Bradley tried to cheat into order to win the finals, while Chas fakes an injury to allow Jason and Thornton to win.
**The Gammas cheated throughout the games, while Chas's team did not.
**Chas constantly tried to win the heart of a girl; Bradley did not do this at all.

===Other notes===
*When it was shown on the [[Disney Channel]] and [[Toon Disney]] (now [[Disney XD]]), the part with Goofy and Max saving Tank from the flaming X symbol was cut out due to the [[September 11]] attacks in 2001. Tank, Max, and Goofy are merely shown surviving, with Tank's ire at Bradley having no explanation. Another edit is the removal of the ESPN logo from the film (despite the fact the movie was produced and aired by Disney, who owns it during it's broadcasts), although it still appears during the end credits. As of 2011, the ESPN logo has been retained in the movie's broadcasts, but not the flaming X.
**The DVD doesn't contain these aforementioned edits, due to it being released in 2000, a year before the September 11, 2001 attacks themselves occured. The DVD was never re-called to edit these scenes out during its release.
**The version on U.S. [[Netflix]] still retains the flaming X scene initially cut out in 2001.
**The movie was also kept unedited for airings in other countries.
**The movie is also kept with the entire flaming X scene uncut on [[Disney+]] streaming service.<ref>https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/video/404fa6e4-f4c6-4113-b8fe-9b6f470566cf</ref>
*Unlike its predecessor, ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' is not a musical film in which any its characters sing any original numbers. Instead, it's a Sports-based College Comedy film with popular songs comprising its soundtrack.
*In one scene, Bobby breaks the fourth wall when asking why the characters are always wearing gloves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R3cvbLsbAk&t=16s|title=Why cartoon characters wear gloves|date=February 2, 2017|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>
*This movie was released on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_29 Leap Year Day] in 2000.

==Reception==
''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' won the award for "Best Animated Home Video Production" and was nominated for "Best Voice Acting by a Male Performer" at the 28th Annie Awards in 2000. [[Wikipedia:Rotten Tomatoes|Rotten Tomatoes]] currently rates the film at 63%, slightly higher than its predecessor.
