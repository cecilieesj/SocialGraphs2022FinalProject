'''''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''''' (also known as '''''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens''''') is an American science fiction/space opera film that was released on [[December 18]], [[2015]]. It is the seventh installment in the long-running ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise and the first installment in the long-awaited [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]]. It is also the first ''Star Wars'' theatrical film to have Disney's involvement.

[[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] began production on the film after they acquired [[Lucasfilm]] on [[October 30]], [[2012]], Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy]] served as executive producer of the film, and [[George Lucas]] acted as a creative consultant for the films. As of [[January 25]], [[2013]], [[J.J. Abrams]] directed and produced the film, while Michael Arndt wrote the screenplay. ''Episode VII'' is the first theatrical live-action ''Star Wars'' movie, since ''[[Wikipedia:Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', released [[2005|ten years earlier]]. It was released to critical acclaim, making $2.068 billion (only the third film to do such) becoming the highest grossing ''Star Wars'' film not adjusted for inflation (adjusted it is the second highest) and the highest grossing film of 2015 and of all time in North America. It also is the most successful sequel of all time adjusted for inflation. Adjusted for inflation it is the second highest grossing Disney film behind ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. It is also the fourth highest grossing film of all time worldwide (behind ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', ''Avatar'', and ''Titanic'') (third at the time of its release; behind ''Avatar'' and ''Titanic'').

==Synopsis==
As the [[Resistance]] and the [[First Order]] race to find the location of the last Jedi [[Luke Skywalker]], who has mysteriously disappeared, [[Rey]], a desert scavenger, and [[Finn]], a renegade stormtrooper, are unwittingly thrown in the middle of the conflict upon meeting [[BB-8]], a droid with a piece of a map to Luke's location. To defeat the villainous [[First Order]], one of them must discover the dormant Force within, and awaken it.

==Plot==
Three decades after the second Death Star's destruction, [[Luke Skywalker]], the last [[Jedi|Jedi Master]], has mysteriously vanished. Led by the mysterious [[Supreme Leader Snoke]], the infamous [[First Order]], a military junta of the [[Galactic Empire]], and [[Knights of Ren]], successor to the [[Sith Order]], is seizing control of the galaxy and is scouring the galaxy to find Luke, having already destroyed the New Jedi Order. The [[Resistance]], an offshoot of the [[New Republic]] led by General [[Leia Organa]], is doing the same, while attempting to protect the galaxy from the rising tyranny of the First Order.

[[Poe Dameron]], the Resistance's best pilot, is sent by Leia to retrieve a map to Luke's location from a village on the planet Jakku. However, stormtroopers led by [[Captain Phasma]] as well as the First Order's warlord [[Kylo Ren]], arrive at the village, during which time Poe gives the map to his droid, [[BB-8]], and orders him to leave. Just then, Kylo Ren captures Poe and kills [[Lor San Tekka]], and Phasma orders her troops to wipe out the village. BB-8 escapes with the map, eventually finding its way to a junkyard settlement, and befriending a scavenger named [[Rey]], an orphan who has spent all of her life on Jakku, making a living by scavenging several items from old ships around the planet and selling them to junkers for portions of food.

As Ren uses the Force on Poe to learn about BB-8's whereabouts, [[Finn|FN-2187]], a stormtrooper who had become repulsed by the First Order's brutality, decides to escape and frees Poe. Their stolen TIE fighter crashes on Jakku and the stormtrooper, dubbed "Finn", appears to be the only survivor. After failing to find Poe, Finn makes his way to the nearest settlement and encounters Rey and BB-8; he claims to be part of the Resistance. The First Order tracks Finn to the settlement and launches an airstrike, forcing Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to steal a run-down ship - unaware it's the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' - after their escape vessel is destroyed by a TIE fighter. Although they are pursued by TIE fighters, they are able to overcome them and flee the planet.

The ''Falcon'' is found by [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], who have come to reclaim their ship. Rey and Finn soon discover who Han and Chewbacca are, and reveal that BB-8 is carrying a map to Luke Skywalker, stunning Han. Before he can find out any further, they are confronted by several criminal gangs seeking to settle debts with Han, but after a chase involving Rey accidentally setting loose several monsters called [[rathtar]]s on the criminal gangs, the group escape in the ''Falcon''.

At [[Starkiller Base]], a planet converted into a superweapon capable of destroying whole star systems, Kylo Ren and the First Order's leading general, [[General Hux]], have a meeting with the First Order's Supreme Leader Snoke. Snoke grants Hux permission to use the weapon for the first time. Then Snoke informs to Kylo that BB-8 is now in the hands of Kylo's father, Han Solo (which reveals that Kylo is actually Ben Solo, Han and Leia's son and Luke's nephew). Kylo claims that his father means nothing to him, though Snoke questions Kylo's faith in the dark side, and warns him that the limits of his power will be tested when he faces his father. After the meeting, Kylo speaks to the burned helmet of his grandfather, [[Darth Vader]], asking him to give him the strength to overcome the pull to the light side of the Force so he can "finish what Vader started".

On the ''Falcon'', Han looks at the map inside BB-8, but finds that it's just a piece of the map, not completed. Han reveals to Rey and Finn that years ago, Luke was training a new generation of Jedi, but one apprentice (Ben Solo) turned against Luke and destroyed everything the Jedi Master was trying to built. Luke felt responsible for these events, and disappeared, and since then, people around the galaxy have been looking for him. Han also reveals his newfound belief in the Force and the Jedi, and agrees to help Rey and Finn get BB-8 to the Resistance.

The group arrives on the planet [[Takodana]], where they meet catina owner [[Maz Kanata]], who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Finn, however, believes that there's no fight against the First Order that they can win, and decides to leave, revealing to Rey his former heritage as a First Order stormtrooper and his choice to leave, before telling Rey to take care of herself. Rey is drawn by the Force to a storeroom where she finds the lightsaber that once belonged to Luke and [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Upon touching it, she sees haunting visions involving her being left behind on Jakku as a child, the Knights of Ren slaughtering a group of people, Luke and his droid [[R2-D2]] overlooking the [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] burning, and then she sees Kylo Ren in a forest covered with snow. Seeing how Rey is disturbed by the vision, Maz explains that the lightsaber is calling to her and that she has potential in the Force. Maz tells Rey that whoever she's waiting for on Jakku is never coming back, but someone still could. Upon hearing this Rey thinks that Luke might come back to help the galaxy in the fight. Maz urges her to take the weapon, but Rey chooses to flee, refusing to be part of the war.

On Starkiller Base, General Hux addresses legions of First Order stormtroopers and angrily declares the death of the Republic, before using Starkiller Base to destroy the Republic capital, a catastrophe witnessed by everyone on Takodana. Finn chooses to stay upon also seeing the event, and Maz gives him Luke's lightsaber for safekeeping. The First Order descends on Takodana, tipped off to BB-8's presence. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn battle the First Order with the eventual help from a squadron of Resistance X-wings led by Poe, who survived the crash on Jakku. However, Rey is captured by Kylo and taken to Starkiller Base. After the battle, General Leia Organa arrives on Takodana along with [[C-3PO]] and reunites with Han, and they journey back to the Resistance base on D'Qar. There, Finn reunites with Poe, while Leia and Han talk about their son Ben's turn to the dark side, with Leia insisting that Snoke is to blame for seducing Ben and that there is still light in him, and that Han, as his father, can reach him. Also, C-3PO reveals to BB-8 that the droid R2-D2 has been dormant since Luke's disappearance.

Meanwhile, Kylo holds Rey captive in Starkiller Base. He removes his mask to her, revealing his face to be young and handsome. Kylo attempts to probe Rey, seeing various images in her mind involving her life on Jakku and a dream of a far away island, also sensing her loneliness and how close she feels to Han. Kylo then attempts to extract the map from her mind, but surprisingly, she is able to resist him and instead pushes back into Kylo's mind, revealing his inner fear of never being as strong as Darth Vader. A stunned Kylo leaves and reports his discovery to Snoke, who orders Hux to activate Starkiller Base to destroy D'Qar before the Resistance can find Luke, and then tells Kylo to bring Rey to him. However, Rey uses her newly-discovered Force powers to play a mind trick on a stormtrooper and escape her cell, with effort, much to Kylo's anger.

As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to sneak onto the surface and lower the planetary shields so their fighters can attack the superweapon's weak point. Using the ''Falcon'', Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base; despite Finn admitting that he's only here to rescue Rey, he quickly devises a plan. They take Captain Phasma hostage and force her to lower the shields, before dropping her in the trash compactor; shortly after, they reunite with Rey. The Resistance's X-wing squadron, led by Poe, attempts to attack Starkiller Base, but they are unable to penetrate the weapon. Thinking quickly, Han and Chewbacca instead use explosives to create an opening.

Seeing their progress, Kylo attempts to stop them and is then confronted by Han, who tries to convince his son to abandon the dark side, addressing him as "Ben", and warning him that Snoke is only using him for his power and will kill him once he accomplishes his goal of ruling the galaxy. Despite his composure, Kylo breaks down with his internal struggle, telling Han that he wants to be free of the painful conflict inside him, and asks his father for help in giving him the strength to make the choice to free his pain, which Han promises to give. After a few quiet and tense moments, Kylo ultimately makes his decision, and activates his lightsaber, impaling Han and killing him. Enraged, Chewbacca shoots Kylo in the side, leaving him severely weakened, and detonates the explosives, allowing Poe and his squadron to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator, triggering a chain reaction that will destroy Starkiller Base.

Meanwhile, the injured Kylo chases Finn and Rey onto the surface, and the three engage in a lightsaber duel. Finn tries to fight him using Anakin's old lightsaber, but Kylo uses the Force to enhance his attack and grievously wound his opponent, but not before getting a shoulder wound. Kylo then attempts to call his grandfather's saber, but Rey manages to call it upon the Force, surprising him. Rey takes up the lightsaber and duels Kylo. Although Kylo initially has the upper hand, when he corners her on a rift, he asks her to be his apprentice. Rey takes advantage of this moment to gather her power in the Force. Rey eventually manages to overpower and disarm him, leaving him with a gruesome facial scar, they are then separated by a fissure as the planet begins to crumble. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate the base and bring Kylo to him, saying it's time to complete his training. Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca evacuate on the ''Falcon'' as Starkiller Base is destroyed.

On D'Qar, while the Resistance celebrates their victory, Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn the loss of Han. R2-D2 suddenly awakens and reveals he has the rest of the map. Using BB-8's piece, they complete the map and reveal Luke's location. Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 follow the map to a planet called [[Ahch-To]] that Rey recognizes from her dreams. When they arrive, Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island and presents him with his father's lightsaber.

===Disney purchases Lucasfilm===
[[File:DisneyLucasFilm_489x295_0.jpg|thumb|250px|The Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm from George Lucas paved the way for the creation of ''Star Wars Episode VII''.]]
On [[October 30]], [[2012]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced that it had purchased [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Ltd.]], the production company behind the creation of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, from its owner, ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]], for $4.05 billion. The acquisition came in the wake of Lucas's announced retirement on [[May 31]], and the subsequent [[June 1]] announcement that veteran film producer [[Kathleen Kennedy]] was succeeding Lucas as Lucasfilm's Co-Chair.

As part of the merger, Disney revealed that it planned to release a new sequel trilogy of films, beginning in [[2015]], that would include the long-awaited ''Star Wars Episodes VII'', ''VIII'', and ''IX''. Lucas will remain involved as a creative consultant, with Kennedy serving as executive producer.

''Star Wars Episode VII'' has already been in development for several months as of the Disney–Lucasfilm merger. Lucas has written the story treatments for each of the three upcoming films. According to Kennedy, the development team is currently in the process of sitting down with writers to discuss story ideas. According to a Lucasfilm source, the basis for ''Star Wars Episode VII'' will be an original story, rather than taking inspiration from previous Expanded Universe content, such as author Timothy Zahn's ''Thrawn Trilogy'' of novels, which chronologically follows the events of ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' in the ''Star Wars'' canon.

===Assembling the team===
{{Quote|I've consistently been impressed with J.J. as a filmmaker and storyteller. He's an ideal choice to direct the new ''Star Wars'' film and the legacy couldn't be in better hands.|George Lucas, on J.J. Abrams|url=http://starwars.com/news/star-wars-is-being-kick-started-with-dynamite-jj-abrams-to-direct-star-wars-episode-vii.html}}[[File:EPVII_BR_Workshop.png|thumb|250px|J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy at [[Bad Robot Productions]] during the film production.]]

Lucasfilm confirmed on [[November 9]] that pre-production has begun on ''Star Wars Episode VII'', and that screenwriter Michael Arndt will write the script for the film. News outlets first reported Arndt's involvement on [[November 8]], announcing that, according to insiders, Arndt has already turned in a forty-to-fifty-page story treatment that will reportedly bring the Skywalker family saga to a close in a new trilogy.

Reports first announced on January 24, [[2013]] that [[J.J. Abrams]], known for his work on the television series ''[[Wikipedia:Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and the most recent entries in the [[Wikipedia:Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]], will direct ''Star Wars Episode VII''. StarWars.com confirmed the reports the following day.

According to reports, [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and Simon Kinberg will co-produce all three films of the upcoming sequel trilogy. Kasdan and Kinberg will also reportedly share writing responsibilities for both ''Star Wars Episodes VIII'' and ''IX'', although the exact division of roles has yet to be determined. Kasdan originally wrote the screenplays for both ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi''. StarWars.com confirmed Kasdan's and Kinberg's involvement as project consultants for ''Star Wars Episode VII'' on January 25.

''Star Wars'' actors [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] have all been reported to be interested in returning for the new films, though most actors have yet to be confirmed by Lucasfilm sources.

During a concert with the Young Musician's Foundation Debut Orchestra on [[February 9]], composer [[John Williams]] stated that he was hoping to get the chance to write the musical scores for the entire new trilogy. Abrams made further statements on this at a ''[[Wikipedia:Star Trek Into Darkness|Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' conference on April 29, stating, "Again, for ''Star Wars'', it’s very early days, but I believe that, going forward, John Williams will be doing that film because he was there long before I was."

Mark Hamill commented about the sequels in late February 2013 stating that "they are talking to us" and he is scheduled to meet with writer Michael Arndt and Kathleen Kennedy. Hamill stated that so far nobody has signed a contract though there appears to be interest in the entire cast. Hamill went on to say that George Lucas would like to get Peter Mayhew and Anthony Daniels back for the new films as well. Mark Hamill feels that he will return to be "an Obi-Wan type role."

In March 2013, Fisher confirmed she will return as [[Princess Leia Organa|Princess Leia]]. A day later Lucas confirmed that Hamill, Ford, and Fisher were in the final stages of negotiations and that all three were in discussions to return prior to the Disney sale. Lucas stated "Maybe I'm not supposed to say that. I think they want to announce that with some big whoop-de-do, but we were negotiating with them. I won't say whether the negotiations were successful or not".

In May 2013, it was revealed that production of ''Episode VII'' would take place in the [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. All of the six other movies of the ''Star Wars'' franchise had been partly produced in the U.K., notably in the Elstree, Shepperton, Leavesden, Ealing, and [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] studios.

Michael Kaplan, who designed the costumes for Abrams' ''Star Trek'' films has also signed on to costume ''Episode VII''. Daniel Mindel, Abrams's director of photography, will also return to collaborate with the director, meaning the series will return to shooting on 35mm film.

On [[October 24]], 2013, Arndt was replaced as screenwriter by the team of Kasdan and Abrams. On [[November 7]], 2013, Lucasfilm announced that the film would be released on December 18, 2015. On [[November 9]], 2013, it was announced that the Fox fanfare will not be in the opening of ''Star Wars Episode VII''.

On [[November 19]], 2013, StarWars.com confirmed that [[R2-D2]] will appear in the film. The droid model has been provided and will be overseen by members of the R2 Builders Club.

[[Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman Alan Horn revealed on [[December 13]], 2013, that the estimated budget for ''Star Wars Episode VII'' will be at least $200 million.

At a Television Critics Association press tour on [[January 19]], [[2014]], [[J.J. Abrams|Abrams]] announced that the script for ''Episode VII'' had been finished and that the movie was going "full steam ahead" and in "deep pre-production." He also confirmed rumors of him talking with Breaking Bad actor Jesse Plemons.

The following day, on [[January 20]], 2014, Carrie Fisher gave an interview to TV Guide and mentioned that she, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would all be reporting to work in March or April. As with previous information by Fisher, this has yet to be verified by [[Lucasfilm]].

During an interview promoting the 2014 remake of ''RoboCop'', Gary Oldman confirmed with ''Sky Movies'' when asked if ''Star Wars'' was "perhaps next" and if he "had any discussions [with J.J. Abrams' team] along those lines" that he was indeed approached for a role in the upcoming film. His response was, "They’ve called," and affirmed that it was as far as he could say on the matter. Oldman responded carefully, stumbling over his words as he avoided any disclosure beyond stating an interest in him for a role:

When musing on what such involvement would mean for his career, Oldman commented, "I mean, ''Planet of the Apes'', ''Harry Potter'', and ''Batman'', and ''Star Wars''? Bloody Hell, you know?" AMC Theaters ''Movie News'' Senior Editor, John Campea, has discussed along with correspondents Dennis Tzeng and Lisa Darling on the movie company's YouTube channel, the gravitas that Oldman could potentially bring to the ''Star Wars'' franchise. They remarked that the reservation with which he admitted to the approach by Lucasfilm for his involvement made the news more "serious" in tone with Oldman as a contender for a role in the film, rather than receiving a mere "stereotypical casting call."

Director J.J. Abrams says, "We are so excited to finally share the cast of ''Star Wars Episode VII''. It is both thrilling and surreal to watch the beloved original cast and these brilliant new performers come together to bring this world to life, once again. We start shooting in a couple of weeks, and everyone is doing their best to make the fans proud."

On [[November 6]], 2014, it was announced the film's subtitle would be ''The Force Awakens''. Though the official title for the film is strictly ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'', ''Episode VII'' will still be featured in the opening crawl.

*Although ''Star Wars Episode VII'' is a brand-new chapter for audiences and moviegoers, the film - as well as the entire upcoming sequel trilogy (''Episodes VII, VIII, and IX'') - has been talked about amongst fans for over 30 years.
*[[J.J. Abrams]] is notable among sci-fi fans for producing, both, a ''Star Wars'' and ''Star Trek'' production (having helmed the 2009 ''Star Trek'' reboot as well as its sequels) considering the infamous long-standing rivalry between the franchises' respective fanbases.
*This is the second ''Star Wars'' film to get a PG-13 rating, the first was ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith''. All future films in the series would also receive this rating.
*''The Force Awakens'' marks the first time [[Michael Giacchino]] didn't score a film directed by J.J. Abrams. Giacchino composed ''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' the following year.
*The typeface used for the ''The Force Awakens'' subtitle in the title card is highly akin to ITC Serif Gothic; a popular graphic font of the 1960s through the 1980s which was also used for the credits listing on the original 1977 poster of ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope''.
*While being the seventh episode of the ''Star Wars'' saga in terms of both theatrical release and internal chronology, ''The Force Awakens'' is actually the eighth theatrically released ''Star Wars'' film after 2008's ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars''.
*When Kylo Ren learns of Finn's betrayal and escape, he complains about the First Order lacking a clone army, which would be absolutely loyal. This is a reference to the Clone Army used by the Old Republic and later the Galactic Empire in ''Star Wars Episodes II'' and ''III'' and possibly '''IV'''. This is the only reference to the prequel trilogy in the film. 
*This is the first film in which [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] do not appear. However, Obi-Wan appeared in voice during Rey's vision, telling her that these were her first steps. Obi-Wan was voiced by Ewan McGregor, and vocal recordings of Alec Guinness. [[Darth Vader]]'s destroyed helmet appeared in the film, in the possession of his grandson. Also, in original concept art, Anakin Skywalker was planned to return as a Force Ghost, but plans ultimately fell through.
*This is Erik Bauersfeld's final film, as he died in 2016.
*This is the first and only ''Star Wars'' film to be broadcast on STARZ and also the last film owned by Disney to be broadcast on that channel, due to new Disney films from ''[[The Finest Hours]]'' onwards streaming on Netflix and later Disney+.
*This is the first [[Lucasfilm]] film to be released since Disney acquired the studio in 2012. However, the Walt Disney Company is not credited nor is it in ''[[Rogue One]]''.
*This is the first ''Star Wars'' film in The Skywalker Saga where the protagonist is not a Skywalker.
