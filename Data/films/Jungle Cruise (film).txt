==Synopsis==
Set in the early 1900s, a tramp steamer captain named [[Frank Wolff]]<ref>https://movies.disney.com/jungle-cruise</ref> takes a pair of scientist siblings down the Amazon River in search of the [[Tears of the Moon]], a flower with miraculous healing properties, while evading Germans.<ref>[https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2405191/what-dwayne-johnsons-jungle-cruise-movie-is-going-to-be-about What Dwayne Johnson's Jungle Cruise movie is Going to be About - Cinema Blend]</ref>

==Plot==
In the 16th century, Don Aguirre leads Spanish conquistadors to South America in search of the Tears of the Moon, a mythical tree whose petals can cure any illness, heal any injury, and lift any curse. After most men die in the jungle, the survivors are nursed back to health by a local tribe using the tree petals. When they refuse to reveal the location of the tree, the Spanish destroy the village. As punishment, the conquistadors became cursed by the village chief to never die and never be able to leave sight of the river or the jungle would take them back to it for all eternity.

In 1916 London, [[Lily Houghton|Dr. Lily Houghton]] and her brother, [[McGregor Houghton|MacGregor]], present Lily’s Tears of the Moon research to an association of Royal Society explorers, explaining that the petals could revitalize medicine and aid in the British war effort. The Houghtons request access to an arrowhead recovered by Dr. Albert Falls that Lily believes is key to locating the tree. When the association denies their request, believing the tree is a myth and a female scientist is unqualified to join their ranks, Lily steals the arrowhead. She narrowly avoids Prince Joachim, a German aristocrat who also wants the arrowhead to find the tree.

In South America, Frank Wolff takes tourists on jungle river cruises, which are embellished with fake dangers and corny jokes. When his boat engine is repossessed by businessman Nilo, Frank attempts to steal it back. Caught in the act by Lily, Frank pretends to be Nilo and claims the Tears of the Moon is a myth and that she could not withstand the dangerous jungle; he then backtracks after noticing Lily possesses the arrowhead. Frank’s deception is revealed when the real Nilo shows up, but Lily hires Frank anyway after he underbids Nilo and bravely fights a jaguar.

Frank, Lily, and MacGregor depart on Frank’s boat, but they are nearly intercepted by Nilo attempting to confiscate his engine, by mercenaries hired by Joachim to retrieve the arrowhead from Lily, and by Joachim himself attacking in a German submarine. After making their escape, it is revealed that the attacking jaguar was actually Frank’s pet, Proxima. Lily wonders if Frank can be trusted.

Joachim locates the cursed conquistadors, whose bodies turned to stone due to them traveling too far from the river, and have been infested over time by tree roots, deadly snakes, poisonous frogs, and stinging insects. Joachim frees them by diverting the river, and offers to help them break the curse if they help him retrieve the arrowhead.

As Frank, Lily and MacGregor continue down the river, they grow closer. MacGregor tells Frank he was nearly disowned by his family due to being gay, but Lily stood by him. Breaking into Frank’s cabin, Lily finds photos and drawings of inventions such as the automobile, but also discovers drawings of the arrowhead and research on the Tears of the Moon. Lily accuses Frank of wanting the tree for himself, but he explains he gave up searching for it a long time ago and believed it can never be found. A tribe of “cannibals” attack them and demand the arrowhead, but this is exposed as another of Frank's faked dangers; they are a friendly tribe he has an arrangement with. Frank apologizes and claims he was unable to call off the plan, but Lily rebuffs him.

Trader Sam, the tribe’s female leader, translates the writing on the arrowhead, revealing the tree's location and that it only blooms under a blood moon. The conquistadors attack and take the arrowhead; Frank recovers it and gives it to Lily, but is fatally stabbed through the chest with a sword. Lily runs away from the river so the Spaniards are unable to follow due to the curse's limits.

The next morning, Lily discovers that Frank has miraculously survived. He reveals that his real name is Francisco, and he is one of the cursed conquistadors, unable to die or leave the river. The expedition to find the tree was originally a noble one to save Aguirre's sick daughter, Anna, but when the natives were attacked by the Spaniards, Frank switched his allegiance to help the villagers. After years of fighting, Frank trapped Aguirre and the others in a cave where the river could not reclaim them and where they became petrified. He then spent centuries searching for the tree to lift his own curse. But unable to find it without the arrowhead, he had finally given up.  He decided to build a town next to the river, he made and lost friends and eventually decides to build a boat and give jungle cruises as well as taking in stray kitties all of which were named Proxima.

An injured MacGregor stays behind with Trader Sam while Lily and Frank make the final journey to the tree. MacGregor is captured by Joachim and forced to reveal the tree's location. Joachim breaks his arrangement with the cursed brigands, in order to keep the petals for himself, but Frank, Lily, the Germans, and the Spaniards all converge on the tree. While solving the puzzle, the arrowhead is discovered to be a heart piece having a gem, which after placing blooms the tree under the blood moon. The moon passes as they fight, and Lily is only able to recover one petal. MacGregor fights Joachim, who gets flattened under a fallen piece of ruin, while Frank crashes his boat to block the river, which turns himself, Aguirre and the other Spaniards into stone. Lily expends the petal to revive Frank and break his curse. The moon breaks out one last ray of light and one final petal blooms - Lily’s research can proceed.

Returning to the United Kingdom, the society has offered full membership to Lily, which she rejects via MacGregor, who uses the opportunity to insult the society, saying that they are unworthy of the research, or the tale of the trip, or anything learned by it, primarily stories due to their chauvinism and insular nature. Lily fulfills her promise to show Frank all of London and the movie ends as she gives him his first driving lesson in her automobile, where she herself delivers a corny joke, worthy of Frank's admiration.

A Jungle Cruise movie has been in the works at Disney since at least [[2006]]. A previous attempt that was originally intended for a [[2007]] release would have featured [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]] in starring roles as a Skipper and a frustrated passenger going down river to search for a miraculous cure in a story described as a more comical take on ''Heart of Darkness''. This version was still being tossed around as late as [[2011]], but ended up never materializing.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Tim-Allen-Tom-Hanks-Star-Disney-Jungle-Cruise-23447.html</ref>

On August 19, [[2015]], it was confirmed a new version of the project was moving forward with [[Dwayne Johnson]] set to star. <ref name="The Hollywood Reporter">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dwayne-johnson-star-jungle-cruise-movie-disney-816359|title=Dwayne Johnson to Star in 'Jungle Cruise' Movie for Disney (Exclusive)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> On April 7, 2017, Johnson announced he would also be producing.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dwayne-johnsons-jungle-cruise-is-a-go-at-disney-991947/Dwayne Johnson's 'Jungle Cruise' Is a Go at Disney (Exclusive)]</ref> On [[July 31]], [[2017]] it was confirmed that Jaume Collet-Serra will direct the film.<ref>[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2017/07/disney-announces-jaume-collet-serra-direct-upcoming-jungle-cruise-movie/ Disney announes Jaume Collet-Serra to direct upcoming "Jungle Cruise" movie]</ref> They have also been confirmed to be working off on a script written by J.D.

{{Main|Jungle Cruise (soundtrack)}}
In January [[2019]], it was announced that [[James Newton Howard]] had joined the production as the film score composer. Additionally, he would later collaborate with Metallica on an instrumental version of the song "Nothing Else Matters" for the film. According to the band's drummer Lars Ulrich, Metallica worked on the film after [[Walt Disney Pictures]] president [[Sean Bailey]], felt like ''Jungle Cruise'' was "the right fit" for a collaboration between Disney and Metallica. Bailey had been "always looking for the right match where there was a way that Metallica could contribute to some Disney project". The band members recorded their parts from their individual studios, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The score was recorded in February 2020 by a 99-person orchestra, with vocals provided by 40 members from the Los Angeles Master Chorale. In order to add a "regional flavor", Howard incorporated panpipes and Brazilian percussion instruments. Frequent Metallica collaborator Greg Fidelman served as associate producer and engineer. The soundtrack album was released on [[July 30]], [[2021]].
