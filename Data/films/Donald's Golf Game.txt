==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short version due to time constraints:
* The opening scene of Donald and the nephews, the former spinning his club over his head like a baton and the latter carrying the bag of clubs over their heads, is shortened.
* Donald shushing his nephews and ordering a bird in the tree above to keep silent.
* The nephews distracting Donald with a cold in their noses and Donald retaliating by shutting their beaks with clothespins, only for them to sneeze and blow away the clothespins.
* The scene of the first trick club turning into a net.
* When given a second trick club, Donald calling out, "Fore!", then looking toward his innocent-looking nephews with suspicion.
* The club-turned-umbrella squirting water out of the top like rain and Donald examining it and getting startled as a fake bee pops out of it.
* Donald telling his fleeing nephews, "If you ever come back here, I'll skin you alive!"
* Donald preparing the path from the ball to the golf hole and eyeballing the distance before hitting it.
* Donald going after the bouncing golf ball is shortened; it only shows the ball about to land in the water as Donald furiously tries in vain to hit it.
* Donald saying about the bouncing golf ball, "There's something screwy about this..."
* The grasshopper in the ball having spat Donald in the eye, Donald exclaiming, "That's a dirty trick!"
* The entire scene of the nephews hitting their balls over and under the entangled Donald, at his expense.

==Trivia==
* A clip is shown on ''[[Donald Duck's 50th Birthday]]'', dubbed in French to show Donald's international appeal.
