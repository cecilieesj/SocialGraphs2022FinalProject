'''''The Three Caballeros''''' is a [[1944]] American animated musical film produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]]. It premiered in [[Mexico|Mexico City]] on [[December 21]], [[1944]], and was released in the [[United States]] on [[February 3]], [[1945]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] that May. The seventh animated feature in the [[Disney Animated Canon]], as well as the first animated Disney film to be a sequel (to ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''), it plots an adventure through parts of Latin America, combining live-action and animation. It is the second of the Disney package films of the [[1940]]s.

The film is plotted as a series of self-contained segments, strung together by the device of [[Donald Duck]] opening birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Several Latin American stars of the period appear, including singers {{WikipediaLink|Aurora Miranda}} (sister of {{WikipediaLink|Carmen Miranda}}) and {{WikipediaLink|Dora Luz}}, and dancer {{WikipediaLink|Carmen Molina}}.

The film was produced as part of the studio's good will message for South America, but is less obviously propagandistic than many of its wartime productions. The film again stars Donald Duck, who in the course of the film is joined by old friend, [[José Carioca]], the cigar-smoking parrot from ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'', representing [[Brazil]], and later makes a new friend in the persona of a pistol-packing rooster [[Panchito Pistoles]], representing Mexico.

It was severely edited and re-released in featurette form on [[April 15]], [[1977]] to accompany a re-issue of ''[[Never a Dull Moment]]''.

==Plot==
The film consists of several segments, connected by a common theme. In it, it is Donald Duck's birthday, and he receives three presents from friends in Latin America. The first one is a film projector, which shows him a few animated scenes. He learns about a penguin that wants to live on a tropical island, a winged donkey, and a documentary on tropical birds. During the documentary, he learns about the [[Aracuan Bird]].

The second present is a book given to Donald by José Carioca himself. It tells of Salvador (called "Baía" in the film), the capital city of Bahia which is one of [[Brazil]]'s 26 states. José shrinks them both down so that they can enter the book. They meet up with several of the locals, who start dancing. Donald ends up pining for one girl. After the journey, Donald and José leave the book.

Upon returning, Donald realizes that he is too small to open his third present. José shows him how to use magic to return himself to the proper size. After opening it, he meets Panchito Pistoles, a native of Mexico. They take the name "The Three Caballeros" and have a short celebration. Panchito then gives Donald's present, a piñata. He tells him of the tradition behind the piñata. José and Panchito then blindfold him and have him attempt to break open the piñata, which eventually reveals many surprises. The celebration ends with him being fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a bull.

Throughout the film, the Aracuan Bird appears at random moments. He usually pesters everyone, sometimes stealing José's cigar. His most famous gag is when he re-routes the train by drawing new tracks. He later returns in ''[[Melody Time]]''.

===Film segments===
The film's segments include:
*'''[[The Cold-Blooded Penguin]]''' involved a penguin named [[Pablo]], reproducing images of the penguins of Punta Tombo in Argentina along the coast of Patagonia, "Pablo the penguin" is so fed up with the freezing conditions of the South Pole that he decides to leave for warmer climates.
*'''[[The Flying Gauchito]]:''' Tells the adventures of a [[Flying Gauchito|little boy]] from [[Uruguay]] and his winged donkey, [[Burrito]]. It is believed the donkey is modeled after hefty Latin lover Don Juan De Gama.
*'''Baía:''' involves a pop-up book trip through Salvador, the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia, as Donald Duck and [[José Carioca]] meet up with some of the locals who dance a lively samba and Donald starts pining for one of the females, played by singer Aurora Miranda.
*'''[[Las Posadas]]:''' The story of a group of Mexican children who celebrated Christmas by re-enacting the journey of Mary and Joseph, searching for room at an inn. "Posada" means "inn", and they are told "no posada" at each house until they come to one where they are offered shelter in a stable. This leads to festivities including the breaking of the piñata, which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break it as well.
*'''Mexico:''' Pátzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco: Panchito gives Donald and José a tour of Mexico on a flying sarape. Several Mexican dances and songs are learned here. Donald seems to be a "wolf" to the ladies again, and tries to gain their affections, but fails.
*'''You Belong to My Heart:''' The skies of Mexico result in Donald falling in love with a singing woman. The lyrics in the song itself play parts in the scenarios as to what is happening as well.
*'''Donald's Surreal Reverie:''' A kiss, or several to be exact, lead to Donald going into the phrase "Love is a drug." This scene is similar to "[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]", for being a major "trippy" scene. Donald constantly envisions sugar rush colors, flowers, and Panchito and José popping in at the worst of moments. The scene changes after Donald manages to dance with a girl from the state of Oaxaca, from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. They dance to the song "La Sandunga." The girl begins by singing the song, with Donald "quacking" out the rest of the chorus. The "drunkness" slows down for a moment, but speeds up again when a Mexican girl uses a conductor's stick to make cacti do just about anything while dancing "Jesusita en Chihuahua", a Mexican Revolution trademark song. The scene is interrupted when Panchito and José spice things up, and Donald ends up battling a [[Toy bull|toy bull]] with wheels on its legs. The catch is that it's loaded with firecrackers and other explosives.

===Influence===
The {{WikipediaLink|Agustín Lara}}'s song "{{WikipediaLink|You Belong to My Heart}}" was featured in a Disney short called ''[[Pluto's Blue Note]]'' ([[1947]]). It was later recorded by Bing Crosby. The {{WikipediaLink|Ary Barroso}}'s song "Baia" and the title song became popular hit tunes in the [[1940]]s. The complete "Baia" sequence was cut from the [[1977]] theatrical reissue of the film.

Some clips from this film were used in the "Welcome to Rio" portion of the ''[[Mickey Mouse Disco]]'' music video.

[[Don Rosa]] wrote two sequels in [[2000]] and [[2006]]. As of September 2006, Panchito and José Carioca, have returned at Walt Disney World where they used to appear for meet and greets. They can only be found outside the Mexico pavilion in [[World Showcase]] at Epcot. Donald also appears with them.

==Release==
===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews when it was released. In his book, ''The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life'', Steven Watts explains that most critics were relatively perplexed by "the technological razzle-dazzle" of the film, thinking that, in contrast to the previous feature films up to that time, it "displayed more flash than substance, more technique than artistry." Bosley Crowther for one wrote in ''The New York Times'', "Dizzy Disney and his playmates have let their technical talents run wild." Other reviewers were taken aback by the sexual dynamics of it, particularly the idea of Donald Duck lusting towards live-action women. As ''The New Yorker'' put it in a negative review of it, such a concept "is one of those things that might disconcert less squeamish authorities than the Hays office. It might even be said that a sequence involving the duck, the young lady, and a long alley of animated cactus plants would probably be considered suggestive in a less innocent medium." Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of the critics gave it a positive review based on 15 reviews.

===Television===
For the film's television premiere, ''The Three Caballeros'' aired as the ninth episode of the first season of [[ABC]]'s ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]]'' television series. Edited, shortened, and retitled ''[[A Present for Donald|A Present For Donald]]'' for this December 22, 1954, broadcast and subsequent re-runs, Donald receives gifts from his friends for Christmas, instead of for his birthday as in the original.

===Theatrical re-release===
The film was severely edited and re-released in featurette form on April 15, 1977, to accompany a re-issue of ''[[Never a Dull Moment]]''. Specifically, the entire "Baía" sequence was cut.

The title characters also appear in some of Disney's themed resorts, such as [[Disney's Coronado Springs Resort]] where one can find topiary of them, and [[Disney's All-Star Music Resort]] where a fountain depicting the trio is the centerpiece of the Guitar-shaped Calypso Pool.

In February 2001, José and Panchito appeared in several episodes of ''[[House of Mouse]]''.

In April 2007, the film became the basis for a ride at the Mexican pavilion at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] named [[Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wdwhistory.com/wiki/Gran_Fiesta_Tour|title=Gran Fiesta Tour at Walt Disney World|publisher=WDWHistory.com}}</ref>

In June 2018, a TV series ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'' was released on the DisneyLife app in the Philippines, and is now currently available for streaming on [[Disney+]] as of 2019. The series serves as a reboot of ''The Three Caballeros'' franchise, centering on Panchito, José and Donald finding themselves inheritors of a heroic legacy and resuming their ancestors' quest with the aid of a valiant Greek goddess.

All three of the Caballeros reunite in ''[[DuckTales (2017 series)|Ducktales 2017]]'s'' "''[[The Town Where Everyone Was Nice!]]"'' (season 2, episode 4) and continue to reappear throughout the show's run, including featuring José and Panchito singing a version of the happy birthday song in the show's finale, ''[[The Last Adventure!|"The Last Adventure!"]].'' Donald Duck is portrayed by [[Tony Anselmo]], Arturo Del Puerto as Panchito Pistoles, and [[Bernardo De Paula]] as José Carioca.

==Trivia==
*The film's copyright was renewed on [[November 10]], [[1971]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofc19713251213libr/page/154/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries]</ref>
*During the titular song, when the line "we have the stars to guide us" is sung, both José and Panchito's mouths are synched to the words, but only Panchito is singing the line. It is unknown if this was an error. However, they are both heard singing in the Spanish dub.
*Although he is identified in the opening credits, Panchito never introduces himself to Donald and José by name, which is never spoken throughout the film. Additionally, he is only identified as Panchito in the opening credits, omitting his last name, while José and Donald's last names are listed.
*The Acapulco beach sequence was not shot on location. It was filmed in the parking lot of the Disney studio. B-roll footage of the sequence can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidlmjNIs4A here].
*The 1974 reissue of the ''Feliz Navidad'' cartoon was featured on the 1985 VHS of ''[[The Small One]]''.
