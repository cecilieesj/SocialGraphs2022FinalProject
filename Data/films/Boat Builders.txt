==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
* Goofy describing the boat to be built as a "humdinger" and Mickey deciding to call it the Queen Minnie.
* Mickey setting up the mast.
* Goofy's third attempt at nailing the obstinate board to the ship, which, when failed, ultimately results in him falling in a barrel of nails.
* Donald getting entangled in the boat's rudder, although it does show Mickey struggling with the steering wheel, resulting in Donald getting smacked against the rudder.
* The entire scene with Goofy and the mermaid figurehead.
* Minnie's first failed attempt at breaking the champagne bottle against the boat.
* The boat falling apart is halved.
