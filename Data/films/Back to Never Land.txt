'''Back to Never Land''' was a [[1989]] live-action/animated hybrid film that was originally shown inside the former attraction, [[The Magic of Disney Animation|Magic of Disney Animation]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]. It was also shown inside the [[Disney Animation Building]] at [[Disney California Adventure]]. Directed by [[Jerry Rees]] and produced by Bob Rogers, the attraction ran from May 1, 1989, to September 30, 2003.

==Summary==
Hosted by both the late [[Robin Williams]] and [[Walter Cronkite]], the film takes the audience through the animation process in the form of an adventure to [[Neverland]], where Robin takes on the role of one of the [[Lost Boys]] and has a bad run in with [[Captain Hook]].

Fortunately, he meets [[Tinker Bell]] before being sent to walk the plank and they plan to use [[Tick-Tock the Crocodile]] against Hook by hitting him with some [[Pixie Dust]]. However, after defeating Hook and being brought back into the real world, he immediately goes back into the animated world when [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] invites him to join him for another adventure.

==Cast==
*[[Robin Williams]] - Himself/Lost Boy
*[[Walter Cronkite]] - Himself
*[[Corey Burton]] - [[Captain Hook]], [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]]

==Trivia==
*The outfit worn by Williams in the beginning was later used for the [[Genie]] at the end of ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]''.
*In the original version of the film, Robin is inked and painted for color. When the CAPS system replaced ink and paint, this scene was replaced with a version where Robin is taken into the computer, but does not agree with his color scheme, so he is given random colors, so then he says, "Fine. Do whatever you want."
*Robin Williams would battle Captain Hook again two years later in the non-Disney film ''[[wikipedia:Hook (1991 film)|Hook]]'', in which Williams played a grown-up Peter Pan.
