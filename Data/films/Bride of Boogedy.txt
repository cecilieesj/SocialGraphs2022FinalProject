'''''Bride of Boogedy''''' is a 1987 family film, directed by Oz Scott<ref name=N/> and written by Michael Janover, which originally aired as an episode of "[[Walt Disney anthology series|The Disney Sunday Movie]]."<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|title=Bride of Boogedy|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/tv/show/42384/Bride-of-Boogedy/overview}}</ref>

It tells the continuing story of the Davis family and their encounters with an evil 300-year-old [[ghost]] in the fictional New England town of Lucifer Falls. The film is a sequel to ''[[Mr. Boogedy]]'',<ref name=NYT/> which aired in 1986.

==Plot==
The movie begins about a year after the events of the first story. The Davis family has fit in very well with the townspeople of Lucifer Falls. *Almost* all of them, except for a grumpy general store owner, Tom Lynch (played by [[Eugene Levy]]) who has a great disdain for Carlton and the growing popularity he's gained among the townspeople. But that is the least of their worries, as their daughter Jennifer, and two younger sons, Corwin and Aurie, begin to sense that Mr. Boogedy may return for revenge. Though both parents shrug off the idea, even after getting a warning from a fortune teller Madeleinska (played by Karen Kondazain). To put an end to their children's beliefs, Carlton and Eloise use their faux seance both to prove that Boogedy is gone. However, the two unwittingly awake his spirit while Carlton impersonates him; which may have been helped when Lynch tried to take out their store's power.
