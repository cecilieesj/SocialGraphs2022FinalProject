'''''Mickey's Nightmare''''' is a [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] cartoon that debuted on [[August 8]], [[1932]].

==Summary==
Pluto licks a sleeping Mickey, causing him to dream that Minnie's kissing him - and proposing marriage. The imagined union turns to catastrophe as tons of little mice—their litter of mice pups apparently—demolish the house.

==Plot==
It is nighttime and Mickey Mouse is doing his night prayers before bedtime. As he gets into bed, Pluto joins Mickey, but then gets sent to his basket as he's a dog. As soon as Mickey falls asleep, Pluto creeps back into Mickey's bed and licks his face. Mickey dreams a mysterious dream about when he proposed to Minnie Mouse and got married at the church after the proposal.

After the wedding, Mickey and Pluto are in the garden watering the flowers. A stork comes by and drops the first batch of baby mice into the chimney of Mickey and Minnie's home. But then, more baby mice start to arrive by the same stork and a bucketful of them are poured down the chimney. Mickey rushes inside to find Minnie Mouse in bed with lots of baby mice. They all start to chase and play rough with their father along with their pet dog. Soon, the baby mice start to use paintbrushes to paint the wall and ceiling in black paint. They also throw pillows at Mickey landing on his face. But the last one smacks Mickey so hard that his jug is now in pieces.

He is then in a tight tangle whilst the paint is licking across his face, the telephone is ringing and the cuckoo clock is crowing. But in Mickey's bedroom, he finds himself wrapped up in his bedclothes with Pluto licking across his face and the rooster is crowing whilst his alarm clock is ringing. Mickey wakes up and realizes it's a dream and his determination is to never marry Minnie. The cartoon ends with Pluto licking his master's face.

==Trivia==
*This is the first Mickey Mouse short to be released by [[United Artists]].
*This short is essentially a remake of the [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'']] short, ''[[Poor Papa]]'', and is also quite similar to the 1937 ''Looney Tunes'' cartoon, ''Porky's Romance''.
*In this short, Mickey and Minnie have 21 children. Storks are used to bring the babies to the couple. According to European folklore, the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was made popular by a 19th-century [[Hans Christian Andersen]] story called ''The Storks''. Nowadays, it is used as a metaphor in cartoons for the mature topic of pregnancy and childbirth to make the cartoon more innocent to children whilst getting the scene's point across.
