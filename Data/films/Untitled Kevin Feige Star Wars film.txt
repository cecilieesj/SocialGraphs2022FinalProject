'''''Untitled Kevin Feige Star Wars film''''' is an upcoming ''[[Star Wars]]'' film. 

==Production==
On September 25, 2019, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported that [[Kevin Feige]] and [[Kathleen Kennedy]] teamed up to develop a brand new Star Wars film for [[Lucasfilm]]. Alan Horn said that following the conclusion of the "Skywalker saga", Kennedy was pursuing a "new era in Star Wars storytelling" and it made sense for her to develop a film with Feige since he was a big fan of the franchise. Feige was said to have discussed having a major actor play a specific role in the film by that point.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-s-kevin-feige-developing-star-wars-movie-disney-1243481/ ‘Star Wars’ Shocker: Marvel’s Kevin Feige Developing New Movie for Disney (Exclusive)]</ref>
