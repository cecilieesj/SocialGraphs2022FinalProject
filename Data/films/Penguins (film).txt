'''''Penguins''''' is the 10th [[Disneynature]] documentary film, centered around penguin wildlife in Antarctica, narrated by [[Ed Helms]]. It was released on April 17, 2019.

A feature length documentary on the film's production, ''Penguins: Life on the Edge'', was released on [[Disney+]] in conjunction with the film's 2020 debut on the platform.

== Summary ==
Penguins follows the story of Steve, an Adélie penguin, on a quest to find a life partner and start a family. When Steve meets with Wuzzo the emperor penguin they become friends. But nothing comes easy in the icy Antarctic.

==Trivia==
*Due to being released on the same day as [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Breakthrough]]'', this marks the first time Disney theatrically releases two films on the same day since the 3-D double feature theatrical reissues of [[Toy Story|''Toy Story'']] and [[Toy Story 2|''Toy Story 2'']] back in [[2009]].
**In addition to Disney's completed acquisition of [[21st Century Fox]] (including 20th Century Fox) and further release date changes, it also marks the last time both a Disney film and a 20th Century Fox film have been theatrically released on the same day.
