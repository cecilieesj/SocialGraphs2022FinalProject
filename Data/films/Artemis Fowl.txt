{{Quote|Your family has taken something of great value from us. Return it to me or I will destroy everything you love.|[[Opal Koboi]]|Artemis Fowl}}
Disney's ''Artemis Fowl'', based on the beloved book series by Eoin Colfer, is a fantastical, spellbinding adventure that follows the journey of 12-year-old genius Artemis Fowl as he seeks to find his father who has mysteriously disappeared. With the help of his loyal protector Butler, Artemis sets out to find him, and in doing so uncovers an ancient, underground civilization—the amazingly advanced world of fairies. Deducing that his father’s disappearance is somehow connected to the secretive, reclusive fairy world, cunning Artemis concocts a dangerous plan—so dangerous that he ultimately finds himself in a perilous war of wits with the all-powerful fairies.<ref name="Imagenet">{{Cite web|url=https://www.image.net/artemisfowl|title=Imagenet - Disney ''Artemis Fowl'' press|accessdate=April 17, 2020|publisher=Disney/Imagenet}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*This film is the first Disney+ Original that was filmed as a theatrical release. That is why the Disney+ Original logo does not appear, unlike all of the previous Disney+ original films (making it the first Disney+ original film without the logo).
*As it was originally slated for a theatrical release, this is the first [[Disney+]] original film to use the 2019 MPA logo in the end credits.
