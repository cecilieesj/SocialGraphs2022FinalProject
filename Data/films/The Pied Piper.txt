'''''The Pied Piper''''' is a ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' that was released on [[September 16]], [[1933]].

==Synopsis==
In the city of [[Hamelin]], there is a large population of rats that keeps growing and eating all the food in sight. [[The Mayor of Hamelin|The mayor]] offers to pay a bag of gold to whoever can get rid of the rats. At that moment, [[The Pied Piper (character)|the Pied Piper]] shows up and offers his services. By playing a tune on his pipe, he hypnotizes the rodents to follow him out of Hamelin. Then he creates a wheel of cheese with his pipe, tempting the mice to go in and eat it, and once all of the mice were in the holes of the cheese, he makes it vanish.

When he returns to the town, the mayor refuses to pay him the bag of gold because he just played a pipe, and gives him one coin, while the other adults laugh at him. Furious, the Pied Piper decides to get revenge and save the children from growing up to be as bad as the adults by taking them away.

The mayor and adults dismiss him, since they locked the town gate after the rats left and no one can get out. However, the Piper not only charms the children into following him but enchants the town gate into ripping itself open and allowing the children to leave, and the Mayor is left to face the wrath of the adults for the loss of their children, much to his horror. The Piper leads the children to the mountains and an enchanted land with fun and games, where they all live happily ever after.
