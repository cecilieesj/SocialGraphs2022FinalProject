==Characters==
===Main===
*'''Cristobal''' (Cristobal Orellana) is the male protagonist of the movie. He is the most popular male student at High School Mexico, and the captain of the soccer team, the Lambs. He faces a new challenge this year in the school: forming a band for the Battle of the Bands, where he will show, despite of the difficulties, his true leadership. (The equivalent of [[Troy Bolton]].)
*'''Mariana''' (Mariana Magaña) is the female protagonist of the movie. She is the shy and studious student who, under the astonished eyes of all her peers, suddenly becomes an attractive young girl with a talent for singing. (The equivalent of [[Gabriella Montez]].)
*'''Luli''' (Mar Contreras) is the antagonist of the film. She is the typical "rich girl", vain, selfish, who does not spare a second for the others, even for her brother Fer, except to get what she wants: to be the absolute and undisputed star of the school. But at the end, she learns a valuable lesson and redeems herself. (The equivalent of [[Sharpay Evans]].)
*'''Fer''' (Fernando Soberanes) is Luli's brother, who must use all his ingenuity to evade the surveillance of his sister to be the coach of Cristobal's band, ''Fair Play''. With Mariana's help, and with his perseverance and recklessness, Fer manages to become independent and show his true artistic abilities. (The equivalent of [[Ryan Evans]].)

*'''Jorge''' (Jorge Blanco) He does what he can with his guitar ... literally because the instrument has the unfortunate habit of falling down! (The equivalent of [[Jason Cross]].)
