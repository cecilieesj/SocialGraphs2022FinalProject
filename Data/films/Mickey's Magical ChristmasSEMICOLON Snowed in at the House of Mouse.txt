'''''Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse''''' is a direct-to-video movie spin-off from the animated television series, ''[[House of Mouse]]''. The events of the film take place partway through the second season of ''House of Mouse''.

==Plot==
[[Mickey Mouse]] has just finished up another successful night at the House of Mouse on Christmas Eve and is wishing the guests a safe journey home. However, [[Goofy]] points out that a huge snowstorm has trapped them in the House. Mickey decides to have a free-of-charge Christmas party for the guests. [[Donald Duck]], on the other hand, is being awfully miserly for a reason (not unlike his Uncle [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge]]) that is never given and would prefer not to take part in the festivities. However, [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]], Mickey, [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], and Goofy get him to enjoy a cup of hot cocoa on stage next a fireplace set and comfy armchair. Minnie then finds some Christmas cartoons they haven't shown today and they decide to play them.

After the first cartoon, "[[Donald on Ice]]", [[Ludwig Von Drake]] presents "the science of Santa" to explain some of the impossibilities of his traveling over the world in one night (using the speed to have a future version of himself steal a cookie jar from his mother, who is surprisingly at the club as well). Donald is still not in the Christmas mood, so Mickey shows clips of him asking the audience members what they wished to have for Christmas. Seeing that Donald is still not willing to change his mood, Mickey shows two more cartoons, ''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' and "The Nutcracker", plus excerpts of Mickey decorating his house from "[[Mickey's Christmas Chaos]]". Unfortunately, even after seeing that, Donald still refuses to change his mood (likely sour at the idea of being a mouse king and losing in the "Nutcracker" story), earning frowns and glares from everyone in the audience (except for Grumpy, who actually smiles at this).

Mickey then reluctantly gives up. He and his friends have done everything that he can think of. He then thinks that Donald will never get in to the Christmas spirit. Mickey heads to the roof of the building, where he talks to [[Jiminy Cricket]] about how he tried so hard to make Donald feel the Christmas spirit. Jiminy then tells him that the spirit of Christmas doesn't come from a party, it's about being together with the people you love and care about. Mickey agrees on his advice that Donald is his best friend and he's part of his family. Jiminy reminds him to make a wish upon a star. Doing so, Mickey wishes that home or away with family and friends whenever they have the best yet decorations even a humblest little tree that everyone would have the Christmas spirit. He then receives a star from the sky and returns to the stage, offering Donald the opportunity to put it on the tree as it lacks one. This simple act fills Donald with joy as he places the star on the tree. The star then starts working its magic on the House, turning all the wreaths they have around the club gold and adding more golden wreaths throughout (even giving the Magic Mirror Spirit in the lobby a hat). They show their last cartoon for the night, ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', and afterward, everyone, even the villains, gathers on the stage to sing the closing song, "[[The Best Christmas of All]]". Mickey then tells the viewers "Merry Christmas" and [[Tinker Bell]] ends the film.

==Trivia==
*When ''Pluto's Christmas Tree'' and ''Mickey's Christmas Carol'' are shown, the House's TV screen is in 4:3 format rather than its usual widescreen appearance.
*Certain scenes in the House segments are recycled from episodes of the show (although these episodes were not aired until about a year after the video's release):
**Parts of Mickey's "Mouse on the Street" interviews were taken from "[[Clarabelle's Christmas List]]" and "[[Pete's Christmas Caper]]".
**Von Drake's "The Science of Santa" speech was reused from "[[Pete's Christmas Caper]]".
**Cinderella, [[Eeyore]], and Mushu saying what they're thankful for is taken from "[[House of Turkey]]".
**The Mad Hatter's "Ode to a Hat" was recycled from the beginning of "[[Mickey vs. Shelby]]".
**Two of the crowd shots were used in subsequent episodes beginning with "Where's Minnie?"
*Excluding the cartoons, the movie's framing animation is only about 23 minutes long, which is about the length of a regular episode.
*Donald is the only staff member not to wear a Santa hat like his friends do, due to his grouchiness of being snowed in.
*[[Max Goof]], [[Pete]], [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Microphone Mike]] do not appear in the film itself (although Pete and Clarabelle appear in ''Mickey's Christmas Carol'').
**This is the only time in the series which Microphone Mike does not appear at the start or ending.
*This is the only time in the series where a cartoon with a longer running time than the standard 6-12 minute runtime is shown (in this case, ''Mickey's Christmas Carol'').
*This is the only time in the series where [[Belle]] is voiced by her original voice actress [[Paige O'Hara]], as in the series finale episode "[[Mickey and the Culture Clash]]" (the only episode in the series aside from this movie where Belle has a speaking role), she was voiced by [[Jodi Benson]], who also voices [[Ariel]].
*This was also the only time [[Lumiere]] was not voiced by his original voice actor [[Jerry Orbach]] prior to his death in 2004. Furthermore, it was the only time [[Maurice LaMarche]] voiced Lumiere, as [[Jeff Bennett]] would become his regular replacement voice actor following Orbach's death.
*This is the only time [[Jasmine]] is not voiced by her original voice actress [[Linda Larkin]], nor her singing voice actresses [[Lea Salonga]] (who provided her singing voice in the original ''[[Aladdin]]'') or [[Liz Callaway]] (who provided her singing voice in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''). Instead, vocal contractor Bobbi Page voices Jasmine for the first and only time in this film, providing her singing vocals in the musical number "[[The Best Christmas of All]]". Although, Larkin did reprise her role as Jasmine in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Ladies' Night]]".

===Goofs===
*During the scene where the gang sings "[[The Best Christmas of All]]", when the group sings the second, "and family" part, Lady's paws are the medium brown that's for coloring her fur (not to mention the void between her two front legs is colored in the same creamy-brown as they usually are, and her front as well), but when they get up-close to the ''Beauty and the Beast'' objects singing, Lady's paws are the creamy-brown they usually are.
*The [[2009]] DVD said it had [[Disney's FastPlay|FastPlay]] on the cover but it didn't have FastPlay, since it was a reissue of the [[2001]] DVD, and FastPlay was not added to [[Disney DVD]]s until [[2004]].
*The [https://www.amazon.com/Mickeys-Magical-Christmas-Snowed-Region/dp/B00005R5HV PAL DVD release] of the film, unlike the NTSC DVD release, strangely features numerous oddities in the DVD box art on the front and back cover, such as Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Goofy depicted in their signature trademark outfits instead of their House of Mouse uniforms, [[Ariel]] in her mermaid form and Belle in her blue peasant dress, and the film's setting being at a regular suburban house instead of the House of Mouse night club, all which aren't even present in the actual film.
