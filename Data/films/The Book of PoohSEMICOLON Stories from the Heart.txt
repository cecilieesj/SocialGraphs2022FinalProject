Tigger decides to search for Christopher's journal, in hopes of finding out where he's gone, but ends up making a real mess. While they're trying to clean up the room, Piglet notices that [[Christopher Robin]] had marked some chapters of the Book of Pooh with special bookmarks featuring each of his friends. As the story continues, [[Kessie]], [[Rabbit]], and [[Eeyore]] each show up too. One by one, the characters ask Mr. Narrator to read the book's stories for them, leading to the following episodes:
* "[[Over the Hill]]"

* "[[Kessie Wises Up]]"
* "[[Greenhorn with a Green Thumb]]"
* "[[Night of the Waking Tigger]]"

At the end, Pooh and his friends clean up the mess they've made. Christopher Robin gets in and says that a journal is something you write about things that happen in, but only after they've happened.  He also reveals that he had his journal the whole time but tells everyone what happened today.
