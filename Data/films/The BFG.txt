'''''The BFG''''' ('''Big Friendly Giant''') is a [[2016]] fantasy adventure film directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and written by Melissa Mathison, based on [[wikipedia:The BFG|the 1982 children's book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. The film stars Mark Rylance, [[Ruby Barnhill]], and [[Bill Hader]]. Principal photography on the film began on [[March 23]], [[2015]]. The film was co-produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Amblin Entertainment]], and [[Walden Media]], and was released by on [[July 1]], [[2016]].

==Plot==
[[Sophie (The BFG)|Sophie]] ([[Ruby Barnhill]]), an orphaned young girl, lives in a [[London]] orphanage. One late evening, she is awake and looks out the window, where she sees an [[The Big Friendly Giant|elderly-looking&nbsp;giant]] (Mark Rylance). The giant captures her and takes her into Giant Country. There, he explains that Sophie must stay with him for the rest of her life because she saw him and must not be allowed to reveal the existence of giants. The giant introduces himself as the "Big Friendly Giant" (or BFG for short). That night, the BFG gives her a nightmare about her trying to escape, only to be eaten by an even bigger giant.

When Sophie awakens and realizes the BFG gave her the nightmare, the BFG says that it would not be safe for her if she tries to escape, as the other giants (who are much larger than even the BFG) eat humans. Just then, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants called the [[Fleshlumpeater]] ([[Jemaine Clement]]), enters the BFG's home. Sophie hides in a gruesome vegetable called a snozzcumber. She is almost eaten, but the Fleshlumpeater leaves upon the BFG stating that his group does not like vegetables.

The BFG then explains that he catches dreams. The BFG puts Sophie inside a treehouse and starts working on his dreams. Sophie eventually convinces the BFG to take her to Dream Country. But first, they must pass [[Fleshlumpeater]] and his fellow man-eating giants [[Bloodbottler]] ([[Bill Hader]]), [[Bonecruncher]] (Michael David Adamthwaite), Gizzardgulper (Chris Gibbs), [[Manhugger]] ([[Adam Godley]]), Childchewer (Jonathan Holmes), Meatdripper (Paul Moniz de Sa), Maidmasher ([[Ólafur Darri Ólafsson|Ólafur Ólafsson]]), and Butcher Boy (Daniel Bacon), who are asleep. They accidentally wake up the man-eating giants, who decide to bully the BFG and play a game with him. Sophie narrowly evades their detection, but accidentally drops her blanket. Eventually, the pair escapes. Sophie tells the BFG that he should not allow the other giants to bully him. Meanwhile, the other giants find Sophie's blanket and set out to look for her.

The pair arrive in Dream Country and manage to catch two dreams: a good dream about Sophie and a nightmare about committing unforgivable crimes. The two then head to London to spread the good dreams to sleeping children. As they do so, Sophie realizes that she has lost her blanket. The BFG realizes that the other man-eating giants know about her. He explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by the other giants. Not wanting any harm to come to Sophie, the BFG drops her off at the orphanage. Sophie instead convinces him to allow her to stay. When they return to the BFG's home, the other giants barge in and upend the place looking for Sophie. Sophie again evades detection and the enraged BFG finally stands up to them and drives them off with a hot fire iron.

Sophie devises a plan to forge a nightmare and give it to Elizabeth II, the Queen of the [[United Kingdom]]. The nightmare consists of giants eating the children of [[England]], the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing on her windowsill. They head to Buckingham Palace where they meet the Queen, her maid [[Mary (The BFG)|Mary]] ([[Rebecca Hall]]), and her butler Mr. Tibbs (Rafe Spall). Upon waking from her nightmare, the BFG and Sophie inform the Queen that the child-eating beasts in her dream are indeed real and must be stopped at all costs before they cause any more harm to her subjects. After a large breakfast they all enjoy, the Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country.

Before they could capture the man-eating giants, the BFG plans on giving them the nightmare Sophie had caught before. The BFG's trumpet was forgotten at the Palace, so Sophie smashes the jar. Almost all of the man-eating giants are immediately consumed by guilt, but the [[Fleshlumpeater]] awakens and intercepts the dream before it can affect him. As the Fleshlumpeater is about to kill Sophie, he is stopped by the BFG. The soldiers then capture the nine giants and drop them off by helicopter on a remote island far away from civilization where they will have nothing to eat but snozzcumbers.

In the aftermath, Sophie begins living in the Queen's palace which means she's a princess now. The BFG returns to Giant Country where he begins growing a wide variety of vegetables and still delivers dreams to which he was introduced during his visit with the Queen. He also receives proper education and begins to write a book about his experiences. The film ends with Sophie whispering "Good Morning" to BFG, which he happily hears from his friend.

==Trivia==
*This is actually the second adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''The BFG'', as [[Wikipedia:The BFG (1989 film)|an animated feature film]] had been released in 1989 by the British animation studio Cosgrove Hall Films.
**It is also the second time one of Roald Dahl's books has been adapted into a movie twice, the first happening with ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' in 1971 and 2005, the first one being renamed ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory''.
*''The BFG'' is the first Disney film to be co-financed and co-produced with [[Walden Media]] in 8 years, since ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]''.
*This is the second Disney film adaptation to be based on a [[Roald Dahl]] book in 20 years, the first being ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' released in [[1996]].

*This is Disney's first live-action remake of a non-Disney animated film.
*This is the third Disney/Marvel film that The Disney Company can't get any box office from China because the China film's law. First film is ''[[Bridge to Terabithia]]'' and second film is ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.
