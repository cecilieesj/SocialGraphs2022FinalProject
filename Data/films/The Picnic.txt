'''''The Picnic''''' is a ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon, originally released on [[October 23]], [[1930]].

==Summary==
Mickey and Minnie go picnicking but make the mistake of bringing Pluto (here referred to as "Rover") along. The hound chases rabbits and damages Mickey's car. Meanwhile, animals ransack the picnic lunch and Mickey dances with Minnie to "In the Good Old Summertime." Finally, a sudden thunderstorm appears and the picnic is abandoned altogether, but Mickey and Minnie laugh it off as they start to drive home, with Pluto serving as an impromptu windshield wiper.
