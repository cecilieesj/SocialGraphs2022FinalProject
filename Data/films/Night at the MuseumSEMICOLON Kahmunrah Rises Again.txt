==Trivia==
*This is the first film in the ''Night at the Museum'' series to use the new 2022 Disney logo.
*This is the fifth 20th Century Studios film to be distributed by Walt Disney Pictures and marketed under the Disney brand after ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid|Diary of a Wimpy Kid,]] [[The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild]],'' ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen|Cheaper of the Dozen]]'' and ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]].''
**Thus, it is the first ''Night at the Museum'' film to be released after the Disney purchase.

**It is also the second Disney+ Original feature film to be traditionally-animated after ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe]]''.
*Due to Alibaba Pictures co-financing this film, this is the fifth American-produced Disney-distributed film to be a co-production with a Chinese film company after ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (with DMG Entertainment), ''[[Born in China]]'' (with SMG Group), ''[[Ad Astra]]'' (with Bona Films Corp.) and ''{{WikipediaLink|Terminator: Dark Fate}}'' (with Tencent Pictures).
