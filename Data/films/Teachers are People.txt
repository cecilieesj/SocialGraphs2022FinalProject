'''''Teachers are People''''' is a [[1952]] [[Goofy|''Goofy'']] short cartoon.

==Synopsis==
As the narrator explains, educating children is one of the most important things today and the heroic man who takes on this role is "the school teacher" (Goofy, naturally).

After taking roll call, Goofy tries to teach the class but keeps having to deal with a mischievous trouble-maker named George who enjoys sneaking out of class to go fishing, eating the teacher's apple, squeaking chalk, making faces while the teacher gives a geography lesson and terrorizing the other students with his water pistol.

In the end, George's mischief goes too far when he blows up the school with an exploding bomb and is forced to repeatedly write "I will not bomb the school again".
