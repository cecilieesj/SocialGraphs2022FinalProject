'''''The Joy Luck Club''''' (Chinese: (Traditional) 喜福會 (Simplified) 喜福会 (pinyin 拼音: Xǐ Fú Huì) is a [[1993]] American film about the relationships between Chinese-American women and their Chinese mothers. It is based on the [[1989]] novel of the same name by Amy Tan, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass. The film was produced by Ronald Bass, Amy Tan, Patrick Markey, and Wayne Wang, who directed it. The cast is notable for consisting primarily of Asian American women. The film was selected for preservation in 2020 as part of the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Four older women, all Chinese immigrants living in [[San Francisco]], meet regularly to play mahjong, eat, and tell stories. Each of these women has an adult Chinese-American daughter. The film reveals the hidden pasts of the older women and their daughter's lives shaped by the clash of Chinese and American cultures as they strive to understand their family bonds and one another.

==Reception==
''The Joy Luck Club'' has been widely praised by critics and was well received by audiences. Critic Gene Siskel, who singled out the script and performances, praised the film for presenting images of Asian-Americans outside the narrow range of childhood violinists and spelling bee winners, opining that its main accomplishments were its depiction of how the brutal lives of women in China could continue to influence the lives of their American daughters, and its ability to allow audiences to relate to a large group of Chinese-Americans as individuals.

==Criticism==
Some critics, such as Asian American author Frank Chin, however, have criticized the film for perpetuating stereotypes, particularly regarding Asian males.
