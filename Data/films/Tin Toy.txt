==Plot==
The film takes place in one room and stars the toy of the title, a mechanical one-man band player named [[Tinny]], and a huge baby named [[Billy]]. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the latter can be. When Tinny tries to walk in order to get away from the baby while he's distracted with his other toys and startled by a cough, the musical instruments on his back play notes which causes Billy to look directly at him. He then begins to run, but is chased by Billy, who pursues him, first crawling behind the toy before noticing how quick Tinny can move. Tinny then hits a dead end and turns around to see Billy close behind, he skirts away from him but Billy then proceeds to walk behind the toy, becoming excited. Tinny then makes a run from the room but lands inside of his original packaging box, the toy then rotates the box for speed and darts out between the baby's legs. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch, and when he looks up, he sees that there are several [[Billy's Toys|other toys]] hiding, also afraid of Billy after learning the same experience. While walking and trying to find Tinny, Billy falls down on the hardwood floor face first and begins to cry. Tinny is shocked that the baby fell and at first muses what to do as no parents have come for the baby and the other toys want nothing to do with the baby. Feeling sorry for himself and the baby, he tries to go and cheer him up. When he does, Billy manages to cheer up, but then grabs Tinny and begins to rattle him violently and throws him to the side. Once Tinny recovers he sees Billy playing with the cardboard box and paper bag he came in. He tries to get Billy's attention by tickling the infant's foot but the infant is in the middle of looking inside of the paper bag, ultimately sitting up which causes the bag to go over the top half of his body. He wiggles around trying to free himself to no avail. Billy then gets up and waddles around the room aimlessly yelling before he walks out of the room with Tinny giving chase, still feeling ignored chasing the baby who is walking away. As the credits roll after the pair walk out the room you can hear Billy cooing. As that occurs the other toys come out from under the couch. TV and cartoon sounds play in the background.

==Awards==
Tin Toy won the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first time a computer animated film had won in that category.

==Merchandise==

In [[2010]], Disney licensee [[MINDstyle]] produced a limited edition vinyl maquette of the character Tinny as an Art Toy Collectible. Created in a limited edition of only 500 pieces, the exterior box packaging was a faithful reproduction of the box seen in the toy short. In addition to containing the model of Tinny, it included a certificate of authenticity printed on a card with a pencil storyboard of a scene from the short.<ref>http://www.mwctoys.com/REVIEW_081110a.htm</ref>

==Planned sequel==
[[File:Tinny_Ventriloquist_Dummy.jpg|thumb|250px|Tinny with the ventriloquist dummy in one of the original sketches for ''Toy Story''.]]
A follow-up entitled ''[[A Tin Toy Christmas]]'' was planned as a holiday TV special. The plot involved Tinny being put into storage at a mall after he failed to sell, where he would have met with other toys who had had the same thing done to them. However, due to lack of funding for the project, it was dropped. Later, when Pixar and Disney collaborated on ''[[Toy Story]]'', Tinny was to be the main character of the film. The [[Toy Story (Original Treatment)|original draft]] of ''Toy Story''<nowiki/>'s script told the story of how Tinny got left behind at a rest stop and teamed up with a ventrloquist dummy in search of a new home. Later it was decided that both toys were too old-fashioned and they were replaced with Lunar Larry (later renamed [[Buzz Lightyear]]) and [[Woody]] respectively.

==Trivia==
*When the short premiered at SIGGRAPH, the short stopped abruptly at the point where Tinny saw Billy approach him from inside his box. This was fixed in all subsequent releases.
*One of the boxes that Billy is playing with near the end of the short wields the old [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] logo on the bottom-left.
*At the beginning of the short, when the camera shows the entire room, there is a picture of a [[Luxo, Sr.|Luxo lamp]] at the top-right.
*A ''Tin Toy'' book can be seen stacked on [[Andy Davis|Andy]]'s bookshelf during the first ''[[Toy Story]]''. The book is located on the second to the bottom shelf, and can be seen when [[Woody]] passes by Etch A Sketch before their duel, or when Woody talks at the toy meeting.
**The book's author is shown as "Lasseter." A reference to the director and writer of the short, [[John Lasseter]].
**A [[Wikipedia:Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]] version appears in [[Toy Story Midway Mania!]].
*In ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', when [[Hamm]] is flipping through the channels to find the [[Al's Toy Barn]] commercial, you can see brief clips of ''Tin Toy'' [[Pixar animated shorts compilation videos|and other early Pixar shorts]].
*Some of the toys from the short can be seen cowering under a table at [[Sunnyside Daycare|Sunnyside]] when the kids come into the [[Caterpillar Room]] in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.
*[[Tinny]] can be seen under the bed in ''[[Lifted]]''.
*In a bag the camera passes over toward the beginning, you can see the old Pixar logo in the top left corner.
*The picture on the table is an actual photograph of director John Lasseter.<ref name="pixarTouch">Price, David A. (2008). ''[http://www.amazon.com/Pixar-Touch-Making-Company/dp/0307265757/ The Pixar Touch]''. P. 105. New York, Alfred A. Knopf</ref>
*When Billy continues his search for Tinny and the other toys, Billy doesn't look where he is going, then falls flat on the floor, and bangs his head, looks up, but starts to cry.
*There is a message written in the credits for this short. It reads: "''Any resemblance to actual toys or children is unintentional. To open, press down while turning cap. Pixar and RenderMan are registered trademarks of Pixar. Seatbelts save lives. No portion of this movie, including its soundtrack, may be reproduced in any manner or we won't be your friends anymore. This bag is not a toy. Keep out of reach of children.''"
*The game show ”The Price is Right” can be heard on TV near the beginning and end.
*Billy's diaper slowly shifts in color throughout the short. When he crawls into the room, it is white with blue hues, but at the end it is predominantly yellow with leftover white hues.
