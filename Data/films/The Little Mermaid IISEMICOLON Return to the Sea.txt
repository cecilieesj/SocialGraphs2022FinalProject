'''''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea''''' is a [[2000]] [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Disney]] animated film and direct-to-video sequel to the [[1989]] animated feature film, ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. Directed by Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith, the story takes place over a decade after the original film, and focuses on Ariel's and Eric's daughter Melody, a human princess who longs to swim in the ocean despite her parents' rule that the sea is forbidden to her. This sequel stars the voices of [[Jodi Benson]] as Ariel, [[Tara Strong]] as Melody and [[Pat Carroll]] (who had previously voiced Ursula, the villain in the first film) as Morgana, the film's new villain.

==Plot==
In the film's prologue, about two years have passed since [[King Triton]] gave [[Ariel]], his youngest daughter, a human body so she could marry the love of her life, [[Prince Eric]]. Since then, Ariel has officially become the princess consort of Eric's kingdom and has given birth to a beautiful baby girl, [[Melody]], the first human-mermaid hybrid in history. On the day of Melody's christening, Ariel and Eric take their newborn daughter out on a ship to meet her grandfather and six aunts, [[King Triton's Daughters|Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina]]. Triton presents Melody with a locket that bears her name, meant to remind his granddaughter that no matter who she is or where she goes, a part of her will always belong to the ocean. Unfortunately, the celebration is interrupted by [[Morgana]], who has come to avenge her sister [[Ursula]]. Morgana kidnaps Melody and threatens to feed her to her shark [[Undertow]] if Triton does not hand over his trident. Morgana says that she will make whoever killed and murdered her sister Ursula bow down to her.

As Triton is about to surrender the trident, Ariel grabs Eric's sword and cuts the rope ladder Morgana is sitting on, making her lose her grip and fall back into the sea. In retaliation, Undertow attacks and is just about to devour Melody before Triton saves her life by turning Undertow into a harmless anchovy with his trident while Eric grabs his daughter and carries her to safety. Finally, Triton orders his royal guards to arrest the witch, who vanishes right before declaring that Melody will never be safe from her and that she will get her one day.

At the beach, Triton tells Ariel and Eric that Morgana is nowhere to be found and the three agree that so long as Morgana is free, Melody is in terrible danger. Fearing that Melody's mermaid heritage will draw her to the sea, where she will be vulnerable to Morgana, Ariel reluctantly decides that it will be best if Melody lives an ordinary human life and with no knowledge of merpeople or Atlantica. The locket is tossed into the ocean, and a massive wall is built to separate the royal castle from the sea. In the meantime, [[Sebastian]] is tasked by Triton to watch over Melody, much to his dismay. [[Flounder]] and King Triton return to Atlantica as Triton tosses the locket all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

Twelve years later, Ariel and Eric are celebrating Melody's 12th birthday and are throwing her a party. However, Ariel is having trouble as Melody is missing and begins searching for her. Meanwhile, in the ocean, Melody, now a young pre-teen, is revealed to be regularly sneaking out into the ocean to swim without her parents realizing. Melody has inherited a lot from her maternal heritage, including a few mermaid abilities and has developed a deep love of the sea. However, Melody still remains unaware of her mermaid heritage and is banned from ever going into the sea, without an explanation. Due to the ban, she and Ariel have a rather rocky relationship as Ariel appears to strongly disapprove of anything related to the sea. As she continues to explore the ocean, she soon finds the locket and shows it to [[Sebastian]] and [[Scuttle]].

Meanwhile, in the cold Arctic Ocean, Morgana and Undertow have been hiding ever since Melody was introduced to the undersea world. Over the years, Morgana has been trying to turn Undertow back into his original form but always fails. She again tries to turn him back and is almost successful, but the trident's power is too strong for Morgana to overcome. When Undertow openly expresses his opinion that Ursula would have been able to break the spell, it is revealed that Morgana has always been jealous of her and is tired of living in her sister's shadow. Undertow and Morgana start to argue more until Morgana's magical crystal ball reveals that Melody has found her locket, revealing that Morgana has been keeping an eye on Melody ever since her birth celebration. With Melody having found and recovered her lost locket, Morgana sees this as a perfect opportunity, as when Melody uncovers the secret of the locket, she will want answers, which will lead Morgana to finally succeed at something her sister never could; Total control over all of the oceans.

Sebastian urges Melody to return to shore, warning her of the consequences if Ariel finds out she has been sneaking off and swimming in the ocean. Melody, however, does not understand her mother's "hatred" of the sea and longingly wishes she could tell her how she feels but believes that Ariel would never understand. Melody then remembers about her birthday party her parents are planning and gets back to the castle without Ariel noticing. As Melody sneaks into the castle, she comes across some of the guests but quickly leaves them. However, shortly after she leaves, she overhears the guests talking about her behind her back and belittle her for her odd behavior.

Later, Ariel and Max are in the front garden of the castle, close to the wall. Ariel is upset that her father could not be here to celebrate Melody's birthday with them. Ariel then gains an idea, and after checking to see that no one is around, she puts her feet into the ocean to remind her of home, much to her happiness. However, Melody sees her mother from her balcony and asks what she is doing. Ariel makes an excuse and assures Melody she is coming. Melody then quickly prepares for her mother's arrival while hiding the shells she collected while unknowingly tying Sebastian to her body as he helps her dress. Ariel then soon arrives.

In her dressing room, Ariel helps Melody prepare for the party. Melody confides in her mother that she does not really want to attend because of her inability to fit in with her peers, who perceive her as "weird." However, Ariel senses that Melody is troubled by more than just the party and tries to boost her confidence and assures her she can always tell her anything. Melody, now believing her mother will understand her true feelings, is about to tell her her deep love of the sea but is interrupted by Eric, who takes Melody and Ariel into the ballroom for the party.

Arriving at the ballroom, Melody is introduced and soon meets a young prince who asks for her first dance. It starts off beautifully; however, it soon turns into a nightmare when Sebastian accidentally ruins the dance and destroys Melody's birthday cake. Melody checks to see if Sebastian is alright, but soon everyone at the party starts to laugh at her for talking to a crab. Louie then notices Sebastian and, remembering him from their last encounter, a chase ensues. Humiliated, Melody runs out of the ballroom. In her bedroom, Melody is in tears over what happened while Ariel comes in to comfort her daughter; Melody picks up the necklace and sees her name on the locket. Furious, Ariel confronts Melody and learns that she has been sneaking out into the ocean without her permission. Melody tries to learn why she is not allowed into the sea and asks about the locket that has her name on it. Ariel, however, does not answer Melody's questions, forbids her from going into the sea, and warns her that the sea is dangerous. Angry at her mother's refusal to answer her questions, Melody runs out of her bedroom, but not before she takes back her necklace.

Eric then soon arrives and sees Melody run off. Although Ariel feels awful as she has now made things worse, Eric comforts Ariel and tells her that it is time that Melody finally learned the truth. Realizing that she is making the same mistake her own father once did with her, Ariel agrees and looks for her daughter. However, upset with her mother and seeing that she will not get answers by staying home, Melody takes a boat and sails away, despite Sebastian's protests. Sebastian then soon returns to the castle and informs Ariel and Eric that Melody is gone.

Melody is lured to Morgana's lair by her [[Cloak and Dagger|manta rays]]; Morgana acts courteously to Melody and explains that the locket shows her heritage and she can help her become part of it. Undertow believes that Morgana is lying again, but finds that she has a bottle of Ursula's magic. A drop from the bottle lands on Melody's foot and she is lifted into the air in a green vortex that transforms her into a mermaid, filling her with joy. Melody jumps into the water and begins swimming around to her heart's delight. Undertow gets angry with Morgana for not using the potion to change him back, but Morgana tells him she's still reeling Melody into her plot.

Later in the ocean, Ariel and Eric talk with Triton about the situation. He assures them that he has sent search parties all over the ocean to find Melody and informs them that he will soon be joining them. Eric thinks that Ariel should go with them that he needs to stay to lead the search on land as she knows both Melody and the sea better than anyone and Ariel agrees with Eric and having finally realized that she shouldn't have kept Melody from the sea because it's a part of her and part of herself. Triton uses his Trident and transforms Ariel back into a mermaid to search for Melody.

Once Melody has calmed down and thanks Morgana for fulfilling her dream, Morgana fake cries and explains that the spell will only last a few days. However, the transformation can be made permanent if Melody can get hold of the Trident, which she claims was stolen by Triton. However, unbeknownst to Melody, Morgana only wants the Trident to make up for her own lack of magical talent and that the Trident can only be removed from its resting place by Triton or a member of his family.

She gets a stone map from Morgana and leaves, singing about her situation. Soon, she accidentally crashes into ice and breaks the map, losing any clue about getting to Atlantica. However, she soon meets Titanic Tip the penguin and Daring Dash the walrus, who seek to become heroes. Unfortunately after a failed yet successful rescue attempt the two are called out for their cowardice and for almost getting everyone killed.  She tells them that she needs to get to Atlantica and retrieve the Trident, or she'll change back into a human. Tip is untrusting of her, but Dash convinces him to help out Melody as she is depressed by becoming human again. They begin singing and swimming away, bonding with each other.

They eventually get to Atlantica, where Melody temporarily loses sight of Tip and Dash. She then meets three mer-teens, who want to befriend her. Melody accidentally introduces herself as "Mel-mel" due to stuttering from being attracted to the blonde mer-boy. Dash and Tip find Melody and pull her away, putting her back on track. They sneak into the throne room, where she sees Triton, unaware he is looking at Melody's baby photo. Triton then leaves, ordering his men to double their efforts to find her. Melody quickly takes the Trident and leaves with Tip and Dash, accidentally losing her locket. Unbeknownst to Melody, her mother has just arrived and enters the throne room with Triton, where they see the Trident is gone and her locket is on the ground. Ariel is confused about how Melody could have gotten there, but they focus on finding her as she may cause trouble with the Trident.

Melody successfully returns to Morgana with the Trident, but as she is about to hand it over to her, she is stopped by Ariel, and they are both shocked to find each other in their mermaid forms. After greeting Ariel and Flounder, Morgana tries asking Melody for the Trident again, but Melody is still in shock over learning Ariel's secret and is deeply upset that she never told her. Trying to keep Melody's favor, Morgana agrees with her and "scolds" Ariel for keeping her origins hidden from her daughter. Ariel tries asking Melody to give her the Trident, but Morgana convinces Melody to give it to her instead, reminding Melody that she gave her everything she desired, while Ariel has only lied to her for her entire life. Ariel tries defending herself for her actions, stating she was only trying to protect her, but Melody sees that all Ariel has ever done was only keeping her from the sea and again asks why she never told her the truth.

Ariel tries to apologize, even admitting that if she could change one thing in her life, it would be her decision of keeping the truth hidden from Melody. However, Melody deeply hurt and feeling betrayed, refuses to forgive her mother and gives the trident to Morgana. With the trident in her grip, Morgana reveals her true intentions. She grabs Melody and put her behind a wall of ice. She calmly mentions that the spell will wear off by sundown. Morgana uses the trident's magic to lord over the ocean, rising to the surface to gloat. [[Scuttle]], Triton, Sebastian, and Eric arrive, and a battle ensues against Morgana and her minions. Ariel rescues Eric from almost drowning while Sebastian clamps his claws down on the tails of Cloak and Dagger, mirroring what happened with [[Flotsam and Jetsam]].

Soon after the sunset, Morgana's spell wears off, and Melody returns to human form. Because she is no longer a mermaid, she begins to drown. Melody is freed with the help of Tip and Dash and an unlucky Undertow. Morgana uses the trident and puts every sea creature under her spell, forcing Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, King Triton, Tip, and Dash to bow, but before Morgana is about to revive Ursula and [[Flotsam and Jetsam]] with the trident, Melody looks down and sees her feet, and realizes that, as she has reverted back to a human, she is able to escape the spell. While Melody furiously confronts Morgana, she manages to grab the trident from her and throw it back to Triton by climbing up the cliff on which Morgana is standing and sneaking up on her. When Melody does so, Morgana tries to get the trident back, and throws her off the cliff. Just as Melody fears she is facing death, Dash takes action and goes to Melody's falling point; Melody lands on him safely, surviving the fall. Now having had his trident returned to him, Triton confronts Morgana and, saying that Morgana and her spells will not threaten Triton's family ever again, uses it to encase her in a block of ice, which sinks underwater with a picture of Ursula from her kingdom and the icicles began to collapse, trapping Morgana inside.

Having regained consciousness, Melody finds herself in her father's arms and reunites with her family. She then begins to apologize to Ariel, but Ariel says that she and Eric are the ones who are truly sorry, as they realized they should've told her the truth instead of keeping it from her. Melody explains she never meant to hurt anyone but believed she would be better as a mermaid than a girl. However, Ariel assures her daughter that it doesn't matter whether she has fins or feet, as she and Eric love Melody for who she is on the inside; their "brave little girl".

King Triton then appears where he and Melody officially meet each other; he offers his granddaughter the option of becoming a mermaid permanently and living with him in Atlantica or living with her parents on land. However, after looking at her parents (with Ariel giving her a knowing smile), Melody says she has a better idea.

The next day, she uses the trident to disintegrate the wall separating her home from the sea, and everyone from Atlantica comes to the surface to swim with the locals from the village. Melody bumps into the mer-boy she met before and shyly says "hi" to him. The humans, merfolk, and sea creatures unite in a circle around King Triton, Sebastian, Flounder, Scuttle, Tip, Dash, Ariel, Eric, and Melody. Then King Triton uses his trident's magic to form a rainbow in the sky. As the scene comes to a close at the end of the song, Melody giggles.

*Tip and Dash are inspired by [[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] from ''[[The Lion King]]''.
**Tip is even voiced by the actor that originated Timon in the Broadway cast.
*"Down to the Sea" is similar to "[[Part of Your World]]".
*This is the very first Disney film that was released during the 21st century.
*The late Kay E. Kuter who voiced [[Grimsby]] in the TV series was chosen to take on the role in the sequel film as well replacing the late [[Ben Wright]] who passed away before the first film made it to theaters.
*Jason Marin who voiced [[Flounder]] was not in the sequel, instead [[Cam Clarke]] took over the role as an older voice of older Flounder.

*The unpopularity of this sequel and ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'', were cited by John Lasseter as examples of why they should discontinue the Disney Sequel brand.
**Ironically, ''Return to the Sea'' had recently been voted the best Disney Sequel in an official poll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/07/08/our-favorite-disney-movie-sequels/|title=Our Favorite Disney Movie Sequels|last=Berman|format=Blog|website=Oh My Disney|first=Rachel|date=2015}}</ref>
*Ariel should've explained everything to Melody before or moved somewhere away from the ocean, which she points out a few times.
*During the prologue, Ariel's ponytail appears at different lengths at different times.
*On the special edition release, the following edits were made:
**During the song, "Down to the Sea", an edit was made for future releases of ''The Little Mermaid II''. In the first release Adella and Aquata are both designed similarly to their TV series counterparts, yet in a future release they were both altered to slightly resemble their prequel movie versions.
**Similarly, Ariel's transformation had a slight edit in future releases. In the first release, she was slightly pudgy, similar to some animations of Adella. In the re-releases, she looked exactly as she did in the first film.
**In the original, the top of Melody's birthday dress was baby pink, but in the re-release, is is near pink-white.
**During Melody's party as she gets humiliated, the ballroom gains shadow textures when the lighting turns red.
**When Morgana adds the drop of Ursula's magic to turn Melody into a mermaid, in the original version, the drop creates a ripple in her foot, whereas in the re-release, the ripple turns from purple to green.
**During Ariel and Melody's part in "[[Here on the Land and Sea]]", the shot of Sebastian and the sea creatures swimming to the palace steps is replaced with an extended shot of Ariel and Melody on the rock.
