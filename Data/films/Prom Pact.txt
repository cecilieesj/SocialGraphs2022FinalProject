'''''Prom Pact''''' is an upcoming American romantic comedy [[Disney+]] original film. It's scheduled to be released in Spring [[2023]].

==Synopsis==
In the teen romantic comedy, it’s the height of prom season, and high school senior Mandy Yang (Lee) and her best friend and fellow outsider Ben (Manheim) are surrounded by over-the-top ’80s-themed Promposals. However, Mandy keeps her eyes focused on a different goal: her lifelong dream of attending Harvard. When she finds out that she has been put on the waitlist, she is determined to do whatever she can do to get herself accepted, even if that means asking for help from the one person she abhors – popular all-star jock Graham Lansing (Draper), whose father is a powerful senator and Harvard alum. Once Mandy becomes Graham’s tutor, she begins to realize there’s more to him than she thought and perhaps something more to life than Harvard.<ref name="PromPact">[https://deadline.com/2022/03/prom-pact-margaret-cho-boards-teen-rom-com-for-disney-1234984538/ ‘Prom Pact’: Margaret Cho & More Board Teen Rom-Com For Disney+]</ref>

==Production==
On February 6, 2022, ''Deadline'' reported that [[Disney Branded Television]] was developing a new romantic comedy film. Anya Adams will helm the film, with Anthony Lombardo writing the screenplay, and Melvin Mar and [[Julie Bowen]] producing. Bowen has talked about the project while it was in development. “The main character is a feminist, and she doesn’t believe in this idea of falling in love,” Bowen said in an interview. “It goes back to Shakespeare: she’s a little bit strident, very type A, and she doesn’t want to believe especially in heteronormative love, because she’s so liberal. But then she falls and there’s that undeniable chemistry.” [[Peyton Elizabeth Lee]] was cast in the lead role, along with Milo Manheim.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2022/02/peyton-elizabeth-lee-milo-manheim-star-prom-pact-disney-plus-movie-julie-bowen-melvin-mar-1234927395/ Peyton Elizabeth Lee & Milo Manheim To Headline Disney+ Movie ‘Prom Pact’ From Julie Bowen & Melvin Mar]</ref>
