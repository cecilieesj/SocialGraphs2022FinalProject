'''''Perfect Game''''' is a [[2000]] American made-for-television comedy film about an eleven-year-old boy who loves baseball and finds a way of overcoming life's obstacles with the help of a grumpy coach in order to play on his local Little League team. The film was produced for the [[Disney Channel]], where it first aired.

==Plot==
Eleven-year-old Kanin has one dream -- to be the world's best baseball player, or at least not to be the one always picked last. Things look up when coach Bobby Geiser surprisingly picks him to be on his Little League team. The team soon find out, however, that Geiser was obliged to take the less-than-stellar players on in order to win a bet, provoking anger in Kanin, his friends and his mother Diane.

With Diane's help, the team overthrow Geiser and he is replaced by Billy, a retired school baseball coach. The team soon find out, however, that their new coach requires just as much self-assurance as they do. Through this they discover the value of teamwork.
