==Plot==
The story is based on the early life of the Pandava brothers, loosely taken from the ancient Indian epic ''Mahabharata''. The storyline begins with Arjun as a nine-year-old boy and follows him until his adulthood. It explores his life with his brothers in Hastinapur (his native city), his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.

The movie begins with the young prince of Viratnagar asking a maid to tell him a story. The maid narrates to him the story of Arjun.

She tells him that Arjun was a student of the warrior-sage Drona and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of Drona. None of his own brothers nor his cousins - the hundred Kaurvas - could equal him in the art. Duryodhana and the other Kaurvas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne. When King Dhritrashtra grew older, the rivalry between his sons, the Kaurvas and the Pandavas, intensified. Twice, Duryodhana attempted to kill all the Pandavas but failed. To avoid further conflict, Dhritrashtra proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of Hastinapur and asked Yudhisthira to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire.

In the meantime, Arjun won a swayamvar (trial) and married Princess Draupadi. Duryodhana, who loathed the Pandavas, hatched a conspiracy with his uncle Shakuni and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called chaupar (similar to ludo). After losing everything, Yudhisthira and the other Pandavas, according to the game's rules, had to go into exile for twelve years and an agyatavasa (disguise) for one year. While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do Tapasya (penance). Before leaving, Draupadi makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves and does Tapasya, during which he earns a bow from Lord Shiva, one of his patron gods.

The story then shifts back to the present-day Viratnagar, where the Pandavas are spending their year of disguise and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the game's outcome, if any one of the Pandavas is found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve-year exile. The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits, but Duryodhana's army attacks the unprotected capital, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight. He is then inspired by Arjun.

==Critical reception==
'''''Arjun: The Warrior Prince''''' received positive reviews. Review aggregator, Bollymoviereviewz, gave the movie 3.35 stars out of 5. Priyanka Ketkar of Koimoi gave the movie 4 stars out of 5, saying that '''''Arjun: The Warrior Prince''''' is an extremely engaging movie with fabulous animation and a story of our very own Indian hero.” Martin D’Souza of Glamsham gave the movie 4 stars out of 5, commenting that “If your Sunday mornings were spent in front of the television set two decades ago, this one is definitely for you.” Madhureeta Mukherjee of Times Of India gave the movie 3.5 stars out of 5, concluding that “Of all the amateurish animation films we’ve seen, this one’s a ‘God-send.” Shakti Shetty of Midday gave the movie 3.5 stars out of 5, saying that “Though '''''Arjun: The Warrior Prince''''' is not at par with groundbreaking flicks like ''WALL·E'' (that came from the same production house), thanks to moments of technical amateurishness, it’s definitely a forward step for animation. Moreover, it’s not another children’s film and can be relished by grown-ups as well. Indian children who are neck-deep in Japanese anime might experience something fresh, and adults will be compelled to test their memory.”

Worth a watch.” Preeti Arora of Rediff gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, saying that “Being an animated film, Arjun is sure to find a connection with children.”

It is also a great outing for someone who wishes to walk down nostalgia lane with their favorite tales of the good old days.” Ananya Bhattacharya of Zee News gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, concluding that “No form of popular culture can ever encompass the greatness of the man called Arjun. Watch ‘Arjun’ for yet another perspective on him. Watch ‘Arjun’ if you are craving that much-needed break from the current films of the day, which have pushed you to the brink of insanity. Watch ‘Arjun’ to see the man who is synonymous with the Mahabharata!” Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, saying, “On the whole, '''''Arjun: The Warrior Prince''''' needs to be watched for its animation, for its storytelling and most importantly, it makes an earnest effort to relive the mythology.” Aakanksha Naval-Shetye and Chaya Unnikrishnan of DNA India gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, saying that “Director Arnab Chaudhari has kept the narrative fast-paced. A nice way of introducing kids to the epic tale.”
