'''''The Dream Called EPCOT''''' is a [[1981]] film created to promote [[Epcot]] (then EPCOT Center) ahead of its 1982 opening. It ran on a loop at the EPCOT Preview Center in [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]].

The film, narrated by {{WikipediaLink|Dick Tufeld}}, describes the history of EPCOT's development, shows how Walt Disney World established the foundation for EPCOT, and goes behind the scenes at [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] (then known as WED Enterprises) to show the work in progress on EPCOT. Detailed models and illustrations are used to show what EPCOT would look like once completed.

Versions of familiar early EPCOT songs are heard, including "[[Listen to the Land]]," "[[Universe of Energy (song)|Universe of Energy]]," "[[One Little Spark]]," "[[It's Fun to Be Free]]," and "[[Golden Dream]]." Also included is the [[Sherman Brothers]]' "Reach for New Horizons," created for Horizons, but ultimately not used in favor of "[[New Horizons]]."

As part of Epcot's 35th anniversary in [[2017]], Disney released the film on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2017/09/view-the-dream-called-epcot-rare-1980-promo-video/ |publisher= [[Disney Parks Blog]] |title= View ‘The Dream Called EPCOT’ Rare 1980 Promo Video |date= September 28, 2017}}</ref>
