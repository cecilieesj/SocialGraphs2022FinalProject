==Plot==
Sydney Miller is a 13 year old girl who revisits her homeland of Hawaii and discovers her own inner strength through surfing and other island riches. During her time in Hawaii she finds out why her father made her come back: she has inherited a large portion of the land in the Island that was thought to be "Public Domain." A hotel chain wants to buy the land and close off the beaches to surfers. Because the terms of the testament require Sydney to stay in the island for two weeks in a row before being allowed to do anything with her inheritance, she uses the time to learn about her family. As Sydney learns more about her mother, her past and sees the beauty of the island, she cannot sell the land.
