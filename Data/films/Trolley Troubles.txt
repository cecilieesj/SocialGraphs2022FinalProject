'''''Trolley Troubles''''' is the first released (though the second produced) animated short film in the ''[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]'' series, released in [[1927]]. The first produced short, ''[[Poor Papa]]'', was not well received by the Universal staff, and it was held from release until 1928. They choose to make Oswald younger, thinner, and sometimes troublesome. The short was re-released by Universal with music and sound in [[1931]].

==Plot==
[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]]Â is in charge of running a trolley. Today's ride, however, will result in messed-up tracks, a shut-down train, and a nasty crash into a pool.

==Production==
During production, [[Friz Freleng]] was to animate a scene where Oswald pulls off his foot to rub it. Freleng walked over to Walt to give out some suggestions. Walt was very dismissive and told Freleng to think of the idea himself. Freleng realized Walt didn't know what to do either and was pushing him to come up with something that would work.<ref>[https://www.mouseplanet.com/8155/The_Friz_and_the_Diz "The Friz and the Diz"]</ref>

==Epic Mickey==
''Trolley Troubles'' is one of the transition levels in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', set as one of the three trials Mickey must go through before meeting Oswald himself. A major difference in the level is that, while the cow refused to move and Oswald ended up squeezing underneath her in the cartoon, Mickey can hit a switch that spooks the cow into running off, allowing the trolley to continue.
