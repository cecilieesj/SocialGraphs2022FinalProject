==Synopsis==
An adventurous young boy discovers that puddles can be portals to a fantastical world, but struggles to get his sister’s attention away from her phone to see the magic in the world around her.

== Plot ==
After a particularly rainy day, Noah and his older sister Skylar step outside their apartment to spend time together. However, Skylar would rather look at her phone while Noah hops over the puddles. He trips and falls into one, only to pop out another one. He excitedly tells Skylar about his new discovery of a world that exists, but she pays no mind to him.

Noah continues to call for Skylar; hopping through several puddles and coming out of others. He even tosses their dog through one just to get her attention. Finally fed up, Noah grabs Skylar's phone and tosses it into the puddle where she is shocked to see it disappear. Noah hops in, followed by Skylar where the puddle world is finally revealed: a large land full of puddle topped mountains and floating fish and whales of various kinds. Skylar attempts to take a photo on her phone, but a fish swims by and swallows it whole.

The credits depict Noah and Skylar playing in the new puddle world before revealing that the two of them are just happily hopping in puddles back home.
