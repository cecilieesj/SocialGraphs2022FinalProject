*Even though the video is called "Colors of the Wind", that song actually came last; the first song on the video was "Just Around the River Bend".
*"The Work Song" and "Little Wooden Head" return with updated lyrics.
*Features the return of "Little Wooden Head", cut from the 1993 and 1994 edition of ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Be Our Guest|Be Our Guest]]''.
*The "Why Should I Worry" segment is reused from ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Fun with Music|Fun with Music]]''.
*Known as ''Colours of the Wind'' in Australia and the UK because of spelling differences in UK English and US English.
*VHS edition features updated preview for the 3rd series, plus a preview for ''[[Mickey's Fun Songs]]'' three tape series.
* This is the last ''Sing Along Songs'' video to feature a host. A year later starting with ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Topsy Turvy|Topsy Turvy]]'', the following videos would have no host.
* This is also the last ''Sing Along Songs'' video to use the blue G-clef graphic with the song title on the staff used since ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah|Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah]]''.
*"Casey Junior" and "Oo-De-Lally" both return from ''Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah'' and ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: I Love to Laugh!|I Love to Laugh]]'' respectively. These songs only appear in foreign versions and replace "The Work Song" and "Why Should I Worry". In addition, while "Casey Junior" gets updated lyrics, the "Oo-De-Lally" segment and its introduction segment are reused from ''I Love to Laugh''.
*"Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing" returns from ''Fun with Music'', and only appears in foreign English versions (e.g. UK, Australia, etc.) and is replaced by "[[Hakuna Matata]]" in other countries.
*The "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" segment has the song performed by an uncredited duo (Arnold McCuller and Andrea Robinson), and is set to clips of couples from ''The Lion King'', ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]'', ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'', ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', and ''[[Melody Time]]''. The same montage without on-screen lyrics appeared on the 1997 non-US compilation video ''Disney's Greatest Love Songs''.
*The UK version of ''Colours of the Wind'' has new lettering and a Mickey bouncing ball with a feathered headband around its head (applies to releases in some other countries).
*The US version of the video contains new lettering for "The Work Song" and "Little Wooden Head".
*The "Colors of the Wind" laserdisc also included ''[[Let's Go to the Circus!]]'' on side 2.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|Pocahontas: Colores en el Viento]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain.
*On foreign releases of the video, this uses the same opening as [[Let's Go to Disneyland Paris]], though that video uses the classic 1986-1993 logo, and this is the first volume to have the new Sing Along Songs logo on the title card, instead of [[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life|Circle of Life]] being the first one to have that, Though some foreign releases show the new graphics, that in German, French and other languages use old graphics from the late 80s-mid 90s, This volume is the first one to feature the new logo instead of being the 2nd one, There is no blue G-clef graphic on the title card's closing and uses the same title card as the opening before entering the blue G-clef graphic.
*Unlike Little Wooden Head it is lucky to stay in the Sing Along series for having a lucky appearence in Colors of the Wind but sadly not in the foreign versions of Be Our Guest, compared with the Stand By Me, having to leave and not being presented to any foreign version, there is a chance of luck for Little Wooden Head to be in Colors of the Wind.
