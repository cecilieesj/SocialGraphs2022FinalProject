It is centered around the goodwill trips to Latin America that [[Walt Disney]] and his artists took that resulted in the films ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]''.

== Summary ==
For ten weeks in [[1941]], [[Walt Disney]], his wife [[Lillian Disney|Lilly]], and sixteen colleagues from his studio visited nations in Latin America to gather story material for a series of films with South American themes. The feature documentary film uses this framing device to explore inter-American relations, provide a rare glimpse into the artists who were part of the magic of Disney’s “golden age” and give an unprecedented look at the 39 year-old Walt Disney during one of the most challenging times of his entire life.
