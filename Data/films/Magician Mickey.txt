==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*Goofy, after raising the curtain, setting up the lighting for the stage and saying, "On with the show."
*Donald blowing bubbles in his soda as a razz at Mickey.
*Mickey creating pink bubbles, one of which is turned into a lobster that attacks Donald.
*The entire scene with Goofy and the burnt-out spotlight bulb, which lights while he holds it in his hand and sticks his other finger in the empty socket.
*The entire second act of the short is cut: after Donald first spews cards from his beak, it cuts to Donald jumping through Mickey's magic hoop, thus excising the following:
**Donald getting squirted by his own bottle of soda when Mickey uses it against him.
**Donald falling in his box seat, which splashes with water.
**Donald grabbing Mickey's wand and inadvertently creates an ice cream cone which blasts him in the face.
**Mickey shrinking Donald down and forming multiples of him before shooting him into an egg, which he then breaks open in his hat, returning Donald to full size again.
**Donald grabbing the wand again and breaking it, causing it to turn into a boxing cactus plant that punches him offstage.
*Donald threatening Mickey with the latter's pistol and Mickey warning him that it's loaded.
