'''''Lend a Paw''''' is an Academy Award-winning [[Mickey Mouse|''Mickey Mouse'']] cartoon short that was released on [[October 3]], [[1941]].

==Plot==
Pluto is sniffing around outside when he hears a noise. It's coming from a bag floating on an ice flow in a creek. Pluto rescues it, then loses interest when it turns out to be a kitten. The kitten follows him home and Mickey takes a liking to it, much to Pluto's disgust.

[[Pluto's Devil|Pluto's devil]] [[Pluto's Angel|and angel]] sides give him conflicting advice; Pluto puts the cat up to mischief, but [[Bianca (goldfish)|Bianca the goldfish]] fingers Pluto as the real culprit, getting him thrown outside; this causes Pluto to feel bad about what he did.

When the kitten plays with a ball, it rolls and bounces right outside and into a well. The kitten follows and falls in, so it's now up to Pluto to either save it or leave it, but after a push and demand from the angel (and beating the devil), Pluto does his part and saves it.

Mickey, meanwhile, had fallen asleep and is awakened by the sound of Pluto calling him. After getting the kitten out of harm's way, he lifts up the pulley to rescue a now-frozen Pluto, Mickey then forgives Pluto and brings him back inside to warm him up in a tub of hot water.

After warming up, the Kitten gives Pluto a sweet little lick to thank him; this time, Pluto smiles, not minding a bit. His angel side reminds him that kindness to animals is a reward that will be cherished in the end.

==Other Information==

*This short won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short of 1941. To date, it is the only cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse to have won that award.
*Although [[Figaro]] from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' is seen on the short's theatrical release poster (pictured above), Figaro does not appear in this short at all, instead he is replaced by [[Kitten|an unnamed orange kitten]].
