"'''The Liberators'''" is an episode of ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|The Disney Sunday Movie]]''. It originally aired on [[ABC]] on [[February 8]], [[1987]].

==Synopsis==
''The Liberators'', an ambitious 1987 entry in ABC's ''Disney Sunday Movie'' anthology series, was founded on fact. The film begins on a Kentucky plantation in the years before the Civil War. John Fairfield, nephew of the plantation owner, has grown up with slave Bill Jackson. Forced by the social structure of the era into a master/slave relationship, Fairfield and Jackson choose instead to head northward.

Befriending a Quaker abolitionist, Levi Coffin, the two friends become involved with the Underground Railroad, helping thousands of slaves escape to freedom. A romantic entanglement involving Jackson and a lovely slave girl nearly costs the boys their own freedom as ''The Liberators'' races towards its climax.
