*This is the only Sing Along Songs volume to use a song from an original [[Playhouse Disney]] series.
*This sing-along is one of few to have an actual storyline (in this case, it's Maggie trying to deal with Grace's terrible singing). For the introductions, scenes from the actual film are used, unlike ''[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: On My Way|On My Way]]'', in which new animation was used for the introductions.
*No title cards are used for this volume, except "Stanley Rides Again".
*This came with a free ticket to see ''[[Home on the Range]]'' in theaters.
