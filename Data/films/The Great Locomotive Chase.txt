'''''The Great Locomotive Chase''''' is a [[1956]] [[Walt Disney Productions]] CinemaScope adventure film based on the real Great Locomotive Chase that occurred in 1862 during the American Civil War. The film stars [[Fess Parker]] as James J. Andrews, the leader of a group of Union soldiers from various Ohio regiments who volunteered to go behind Confederate lines in civilian clothes, steal a Confederate train north of Atlanta, and drive it back to Union lines in Tennessee, tearing up railroad tracks and destroying bridges and telegraph lines along the way.

Written and produced by Lawrence Edward Watkin and directed by Francis D. Lyon, the 85-minute full-color film also features Jeffrey Hunter, John Lupton, Kenneth Tobey, Don Megowan, and [[Slim Pickens]]. [[Paul Smith]] composed the score. Filmed in [[Georgia]] and [[North Carolina]], along the now abandoned Tallulah Falls Railway, it was released in U.S. theaters by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] on [[June 8]], [[1956]], and capitalized on Parker's growing fame as an actor from his portrayal of [[Davy Crockett]]. The film re teamed him with [[Jeff York]] (Mike Fink).

The steam engine upon which the film is based ("The General") is preserved at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in Kennesaw, Georgia. Representing the locomotive in the film is American-type steam engine #25 ("William Mason"), built in 1856 and preserved in operating condition at the B&O Railroad Museum.

The final locomotive used by Conductor Fuller and the pursuers, "The Texas," has been restored and is on display at Grant Park in Atlanta, also home to the Cyclorama mural painting of the Battle of Atlanta.
