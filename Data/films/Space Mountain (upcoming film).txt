'''''Space Mountain''''' is an upcoming American family adventure film based on the theme park of the [[Space Mountain|same name]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in Bay Lake, Florida.

==Production==
Screenwriter Max Landis wrote a feature film based on the Space Mountain attraction, which was developed for a short time at [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]. The film was based in a 1950s retro-future. This idea of the future wouldn't contain the internet or cell phones but would be powered by many large contraptions and robots. One key plot point of the film involved the idea of people getting sent into hyperspace and, upon their return, realizing their souls had gone missing from them and they would eventually transform into terrifying monsters. The film was ultimately scrapped.<ref> [https://www.slashfilm.com/553540/max-landis-space-mountain-script/ Max Landis Reveals Details About His Shelved 'Space Mountain' Movie Script]</ref>

On October 9, 2020, a new film adaptation of the ride was announced to be in development at Disney, with Joby Harold producing and writing the film alongside Tory Tunnell producing under their Safehouse Pictures banner. Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich of Rideback will also produce. Unlike the original idea, the film is described as a family adventure.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/space-mountain-movie-in-the-works-with-obi-wan-kenobi-writer-exclusive ‘Space Mountain’ Movie in the Works With ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ Writer (Exclusive)]</ref>
