==Plot ==
Inventor of the Bubble Bot and CEO of Bubble, Marc Weidell (Justice Smith) and the COO, Andrew Morris (Rob Delaney), showcase a new invention called the Bubble Bot (becoming commonly known as the B-bot) at a Bubble company presentation.

Meanwhile, [[Barney Pudowski]] ([[Jack Dylan Grazer]]) has a hard time fitting in to middle school, always being put on the "Buddy Bench" at recess. He celebrates his birthday with his dad, [[Graham Pudowski|Graham]] ([[Ed Helms]]), and grandmother, [[Donka Pudowski|Donka]] ([[Olivia Colman]]), and really wants a B-bot considering that everyone else has one. However, his dad gets him a rock hammer instead, leaving him heartbroken.

Later that night, [[Graham Pudowski|Graham]] and [[Donka Pudowski|Donka]] try to buy a B-bot, but the store closes before they can make it inside. They end up stealing a B-bot instead, which Barney discovers when he wakes up the next day. He thanks them as he sets up his B-bot ([[Zach Galifianakis]]), only for the B-bot to not work properly, confusing Barney. He tells the B-bot to stay home while he goes to school. When Barney returns, he discovers that the B-bot knows everything about him, in the wrong way. He heads to the Bubble store to return him. However, on his path, he comes across Rich Belcher (Ricardo Hurtado) and his cronies, who continuously mock him for his love of rocks. Suddenly, Barney's B-bot attacks Rich's gang before they call the police. Shortly after, Barney's B-bot tries to pull off Rich's head before Barney tells him that he can't do that.

This catches the attention of Marc and Andrew, who each have differing perspectives on the matter. Marc sees them having fun, while Andrew sees it as a glitch. Barney rescues his B-bot, whom he now calls Ron, as they head back home. Barney decides to teach Ron how to be his best friend, while Andrew starts to frantically search for Ron, planning on destroying him. One night, while running away from the Bubble company, Barney comes across his classmate, Savannah ([[Kylie Cantrall]]), who tells him that if Ron can't make friends, he's pointless. She then explains to Ron the concept of a B-bot.

The next day, Ron gets out of his shed, and clearly misunderstanding what Savannah told him, goes around harassing strangers, offering a piece of toast, putting up Barney's picture all around town, and slapping "friend request" sticky notes everywhere. He ends up bringing several adults to school, including stealing a baby. Barney is sent to the principal's office, leaving Ron behind. Rich ends up copying Ron's code and does some damage to the school. Rich ruins Savannah's reputation, causing her to become known as "Poop Girl" while Barney is expelled from his middle school, blaming Ron for the mistake. Meanwhile, Andrew uses every bought B-bot to spy on Barney. From this point on, scenes with only Savannah involve her B-bot informing her about the "It pooped me" trend, making Savannah either cry or kick her B-bot.

When Barney heads back to his house, he sees Bubble employees waiting there for him, and manages to find Ron before the Bubble employees can get to him. He takes Ron to run off into the woods, asking Savannah to keep their location a secret.

While in the woods, Barney opens up to Ron about his mother's death, while Ron is running out of battery. Seeing that Barney is having an asthma attack, Ron decides to take them back to the town, where Barney's friends find him and Ron, who quickly becomes known as a hero.

In the hospital, Barney meets Marc, who gives Ron to him. However, Barney recognizes that Ron isn't acting like himself, and demands that Marc change Ron's code back. Marc decides to help, after he was kicked out of Bubble by Andrew.

At the Bubble HQ, Marc manages to hack his way into the cloud, where Barney manages to find his friend's code and upload it to Ron. When Barney realizes that everyone is feeling lonely, he decides to upload Ron to the Bubble Network, sacrificing his only friend in a long time. Meanwhile, Andrew gives his position back to Marc, after he exposed that Andrew spies on people and hates kids.

One month later, Barney is allowed back in the middle school and has new friends, including Savannah and Rich, while the B-bots now have minds of their own. Some kids start calling Barney the "king of the bots" as the B-bots all love him.
