'''''Make Mine Music''''' is an animated feature produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] that had been distributed by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] in [[New York City]], [[New York]] on [[April 20]], [[1946]] and released to theaters nationwide on [[August 15]] of the same year. It is the eighth animated feature in the [[Disney Animated Canon]].

During World War II, much of [[Walt Disney]]'s staff was drafted into the army, and those that remained were called upon by the U.S. government to make training and propaganda films. As a result, the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the feature film division alive during this difficult time, the studio released six package films including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music. It is the third package film, following ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]''. It received mixed to positive reviews, though its first segment, ''The Martins and the Coys'', was panned by critics due to its overuse of violence. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 67% of the critics gave the film a positive review based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The musical director was Al Sack. The film was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.

==Film segments==
This particular is presented as ''A Musical Fantasy in Ten Parts'':
*'''''[[The Martins and the Coys]]''''' (''A Rustic Ballad'') feature the popular radio vocal group, The King's Men singing the story of a Hatfields and McCoys-style feud in the mountains broken up when two young people from each side fall in love. This segment was later cut from the film's [[United States|U.S.]] video release due to comic gunplay, although the film's U.K. video release has the segment intact and uncensored. As of 2020, the movie's full uncut presentation with this segment hasn't been released in the U.S. on home media yet or on [[Disney+]] yet.
*'''''[[Blue Bayou]]''''' (''A Tone Poem'') features animation originally intended for ''[[Fantasia]]'' using the Debussy musical composition [[Clair de Lune]].
*'''''[[All the Cats Join In]]''''' (''A Jazz Interlude'') is one of two segments to which Benny Goodman contributed. An innovative shot in which a pencil draws the action as it is happening, and in which [[1946|1940]]s teens are swept away by popular music. The U.S. video release has a scene from the segment digitally altered to shrink the lead girl's bare bust size for censorship purposes.
*'''''[[Without You]]''''' (''A Ballad in Blue'') is a ballad of lost love, sung by Andy Russell.
*'''''[[Casey at the Bat]]''''' (''A Musical Recitation'') features [[Jerry Colonna]], reciting the famous poem by Ernest Thayer, about the arrogant [[Casey|ballplayer]] whose cockiness was his undoing.
*'''''[[Two Silhouettes]]''''' (''Ballade Ballet'') features two live-action ballet dancers, David Lichine and Tania Riabouchinskaya, moving in silhouette with animated backgrounds and characters. Dinah Shore sings the title song.
*'''''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''''' (''A Fairy Tale With Music'') is an animated dramatization of the [[1936]] musical composition by Sergei Prokofiev, with narration by actor [[Sterling Holloway]]. A [[Russia]]n boy named [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]] sets off into the forest to hunt the [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]] with his animal friends: a bird named [[Sasha]], a duck named [[Sonia]], and a cat named [[Ivan the Cat|Ivan]].
*'''''[[After You've Gone]]''''' (''And Now the Goodman Quartet'') again features Benny Goodman and his quartet (Teddy Wilson - piano, Sid Weiss - bass, Cozy Cole - drums) as four anthropomorphized instruments parade through a musical playground.
*'''''[[Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet|Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet]]''''' (''A Love Story'') tells the romantic story of two hats who fall in love in a department store window. When Alice is sold, [[Johnny Fedora|Johnny]] devotes himself to finding her again. The Andrews Sisters provide the vocals.
*'''''[[Willie the Operatic Whale|The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met]]''''' (''Opera Pathetique'') is the bittersweet finale about a sperm whale named [[Willie (whale)|Willie]] with incredible musical talent and his dreams of singing Grand Opera. But short-sighted impressario [[Tetti-Tatti]] believes that the whale has simply swallowed an opera singer, and chases him with a harpoon. Nelson Eddy narrates and performs all the voices in this segment. As Willie the Whale, Eddy sings all three male voices in the first part of the Sextet from Donizetti's opera, Lucia di Lammermoor. In the end, Willie is harpooned and killed, but the narrator softens the blow by telling the viewers that he sings on in heaven.

==Home video and copyright==
{{Main|Make Mine Music (video)}}

''Make Mine Music'' was originally released on laserdisc in [[Japan]] on [[October 21]], [[1985]]. The Japanese laserdisc is completely uncut and often sells for over $100 as a result. No unedited release has been scheduled in [[United States|America]] yet.

''Make Mine Music'''s sole home video release in the United States was on VHS and DVD on [[June 6]], [[2000]], under the [[Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection]] title. Before, two of its segments were released on home video individually with addition cartoons added to them in the '[[1980|80s]] and '[[1990|90s]]. This release is edited to remove ''The Martins and the Coys'' in it because it has "graphic gunplay not suitable for children", and ''All The Cats Join In'' had an edit to shrink the lead girl's bare bust size to make it less vulgar. No other release has been scheduled yet.

European Region 2 DVDs also include the unedited feature but was not released in the United Kingdom, making it the only classic unavailable at the time. It was finally released in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] for the first time on DVD on [[July 15]], [[2013]], with ''The Martins and the Coys'' intact, but still takes the US approach by editing out the sexualized imagery in ''All The Cats Join In''.

It is one of only two films in the Disney Animated Classics canon never to see a legitimate release on Region 4 DVD in [[Australia]], the other is [[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad|''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad'']]. It should also be of note that ''Make Mine Music'' was never released on VHS in Australia.

The film's limited appearance on home media format makes it the rarest in home video availability of all the animated films in the [[Disney Animated Canon]], though [[Song of the South|''Song of the South'']] and [[Victory Through Air Power|''Victory Through Air Power'']] which are animation/live-action hybrid films not part of the Disney Animated Canon, do have very limited home video availability like this film (''[[Music Land (film)|Music Land]]'') in contrast, is the rarest of all, as it was never released on home video yet.

As of November 2021, ''Make Mine Music'' is the only film in the [[Disney Animated Canon]] that has not been available on the service at this time on [[Disney+]]. However, there is a [https://www.change.org/MakeMineMusic-DisneyPlus petition] on Change.org demanding the streaming platform to add the film. The film was released as an exclusive Disney Movie Club Blu-ray release on November 2, 2021 in the US. Despite explicit reports by Disney's customer service confirming this release would be uncut and explicitly mentioning that the release would include all ten musical segments, the actual discs contained the 2000 censored version of the film, editing opening titles inconsistently along with the removal of the ''Martins and Coys'' sequence and the edits in the ''All the Cats Join In'' sequence (possibly due to a last minute change). Packaging also inconsistently includes content warnings while mentioning nine sequences to be included. Movie Club Members have started a petition to request an explanation regarding the conflicting information given before release and the inconsistent packaging and editing in this edition, in hopes of Disney offering a disc replacement program to include the full version of the film as announced and confirmed by Disney Movie Club leading up to the release.

The film's copyright was renewed on [[April 9]], [[1973]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/catalogofc19733271213libr/page/48/mode/1up Catalog of Copyright Entries]</ref>
