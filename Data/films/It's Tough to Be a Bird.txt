It won the {{WikipediaLink|Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject, Cartoons}} in [[1970]] and was nominated for a {{WikipediaLink|BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film}} in [[1971]]. It was animated by [[Eric Larson]] and [[Art Stevens]].

In the short, M.C., a red bird, explains how birds have contributed to human culture, even as people often try to kill them. He claims this may be because humans were jealous that birds could fly, but people cannot, mentioning the legend of Icarus and films of early unsuccessful flying machines.

In [[DTV]] Disney in the [[1980]]s, this short was set to {{WikipediaLink|Bobby Day}}'s original version of "{{WikipediaLink|Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin}}".
