}}'''''Ghosts of the Abyss''''' is a [[2003]] documentary film released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Walden Media]]. It was Disney's first film produced in 3D and was directed by Academy Award winning filmmaker [[James Cameron]], after his Oscar winning film ''Titanic''. During August and September, 2001, Cameron and a group of scientists stage an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic, and dive in Russian deep-submersibles to obtain more detailed images than anyone has before. With the help of two small, purpose-built remotely-operated vehicles, nicknamed "Jake" and "Elwood", the audience too can see inside the Titanic and with the help of CGI, audiences can view the ship's original appearance superimposed on the deep-dive images.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Also along for the ride Cameron invites friend and actor Bill Paxton who played Brock Lovett in the 1997 film. He narrates the event through his eyes. The film itself was premiered for [[IMAX]] 3D and was also nominated for a BFCA award for Best Documentary. The submersibles Mir 1 and Mir 2 carried the Ghosts of the Abyss team on twelve dives.</p>

This documentary was made for IMAX 3D Theatres and specially outfitted 35mm 3D theaters.
