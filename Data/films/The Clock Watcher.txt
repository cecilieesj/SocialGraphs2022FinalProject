'''''The Clock Watcher''''' is an animated [[Donald Duck|''Donald Duck'']] short that was released on [[January 26]], [[1945]].

==Synopsis==
Donald takes a job as a gift wrapper in a department store.

== Plot ==
Donald Duck arrives late to work at Royal Bros Gift Wrapping department. He clocks in by using a magnet to move the minutes to make it seem like he arrived early. He walks by the Mannequin woman statue and his head turns into that of a wolf as he howls at it. The work begins with the song "Royal Loyal" work song which annoys Donald, who throws a tantrum at the end of the song. Then the work begins as the toys come down the line zooming very fast, creating a whirlwind which strips Donald's shirt and hat leaving him undressed; he quickly retrieves his shirt and hat and puts them back on.

Donald then plays with the toys while pretending to work. He first grabs the fishbowl and rolls it down the table in gift wrapping like a bowling ball, bowling the perfume bottles off the table, and stamps the fishbowl with the word “fragile” — only to shatter it to pieces. He plays the trombone and tries to fit it into a box, but then decides to use the clamp and shapes it into a French horn and puts it in the box. He puts a ring into a football box, but as he tries to fit the football into the ring box, he deflates it with a screwdriver. Then Donald plays with the pendulum clock on the wall.

As Donald pulls out his lunch, he pours coffee into his cup, but gets attacked by the boss's speaker horn, which spills the coffee all over Donald's face, causing Donald to throw a temper tantrum, and the boss demands that Donald say he’s sorry, which Donald does, but he also makes faces at the speaker pipe. He then wraps the next gift very quickly and sloppy and he plays with the perfume. Then the boss makes an announcement which makes Donald excited for a money raise, saying that “Production has increased in every single department” except the Gift Wrapping Department, which makes Donald mad; as a result, he plays with the speaker pipe. Donald then tries to wrap the rocking chair, but ends up wrapping himself with it. Then a rush order box comes, and Donald quickly gets out of the chair and gets the wrapping paper out.

When Donald opens the box, a Jack-in-the-box comes springing out, so he plays with him. When his boss tells him not to play with the toys, he gets angry and quickly wraps the Jack-in-the-box and sits down on the box to eat his lunch, unaware that the box in the gift wrapping bulges up and breaks open sending Donald sliding down the assembly line through the gift boxes until his beak hits the grain hopper toy and causes sand to dump on his face.

He then tries to use a vice clamp to hold the box down and becomes exhausted. The speaker pipe talks to Donald, who gets annoyed and shoves the rubber ball into the speaker pipe. The speaker shoots out the ball while Donald is trying to eat his pie and quickly dodges the ball but hits the vice clamp causing the Jack-in-the-box to spring out and hits his head into the pie causing him to wear a pie hat before Donald throws a temper tantrum.

Donald decides to tie down the Jack-in-the-box and hold it down by hammering stakes into the floor, but hears the Jack-in-the-box breaking free through the floor. So Donald looks down out the window and is surprised that he went through. He then runs down the stairs, and pulls on Jack's head until the box comes out of the floor and ends up pulling poor Donald into the box and gets him trapped inside where he wrestles inside the box until he finally gets free; he now sees that Jack steals Donald's blue shirt and blue hat while Donald is wearing Jack's accordion clown costume and cap.

Donald complains until his boss announces it's quitting time. Donald is happy and excited and runs up the stairs, only to hear the boss tell him to stay and wrap a few more packages. Donald has finally had enough, and furiously runs upstairs to beat up his boss, breaking the speaker pipe in the process before he quits the job.

==Characters==
*[[Donald Duck]] (voiced by [[Clarence Nash]])
*Speaker Pipe (voiced by Frank Graham)

==Censorship==
*The scene in which Donald makes the speaker talk like a stereotypical black man saying "Yessir - and there's gonna do somethin' about it!" is often edited out in TV airings, including the Christmas special [[A Disney Christmas Gift]] on both TV airings and VHS releases <ref>https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPkxV3l6XzAT8YzvOS66vjhgUmsEGydhxYnrklTfebYTHitGXtsf5_fkTdmJukpXA/photo/AF1QipPC6fYS8kEzvCfSeWgtZsHAxHQyH28-hbZYkOpX?key=eTRqVmxueEp6bDRCbjUxNkczMy1YNlRQaWdhM2l3</ref>, although the scene is kept intact on the standalone cartoon short itself on home video releases such as ''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Five|The Chronological Donald: Volume 2]]'' DVD <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZiMgxtD4IM&ab_channel=TheLong2</ref>. The edit goes from  Donald making the speaker pipe speak in a singsong manner "Royal Bros. aren't happy!" to Donald attempting to gift-wrap the rocking chair.<ref>https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPkxV3l6XzAT8YzvOS66vjhgUmsEGydhxYnrklTfebYTHitGXtsf5_fkTdmJukpXA/photo/AF1QipPC6fYS8kEzvCfSeWgtZsHAxHQyH28-hbZYkOpX?key=eTRqVmxueEp6bDRCbjUxNkczMy1YNlRQaWdhM2l3</ref>
