==Summary==
[[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] and her new fiancé, General [[Li Shang]], are on a special mission: escorting the Emperor's three daughters across the country to meet their soon-to-be fiancés. The film deals with arranged marriages, loyalty, relationships, making choices, trust, and finding true love.

==Plot==
The sequel takes place approximately one month after the events of the first film. There is much to celebrate in China. The evil Huns are gone, and the Middle Kingdom is at peace. Fa Mulan is shown to be idolized by many of the local children, especially the young girls, as a result of her heroics, though Chi-Fu (the emperor's misogynistic consul) still thinks she is worthless until the end of the film where he learns to at least ''marginally'' respect girls and is fired and probably been arrested or banished for trying to murder Mulan and accusing her of treason. One day, Shang, who has been promoted to General in between the films, proposes to Mulan, who happily accepts. When [[Mushu]] learns of the wedding, he is pleased at first. However, the First Ancestor informs Mushu that if Mulan marries, Mushu will no longer be a Fa family guardian. This is because Mulan would become a part of Shang's family, thus his family's ancestors and guardians would take over. Mushu becomes worried, especially when the ancestors show their happiness at the thought of Mushu returning to his gong-ringer duties. (Apparently, Mushu had been aggravating the ancestors with his demands for special treatment).

Mushu decides to try to break the couple apart. Meanwhile, Mulan and Shang are summoned by the Emperor. He reveals that the Mongols are threatening China this time. The Emperor plans to form an alliance with the neighboring kingdom of Qui Gong to help fend off the Mongols. To solidify the alliance, he asks Mulan and Shang to escort three princesses: Mei, Ting-Ting, and Su, to Qui Gong, where they will be married to Lord Chin's three sons. If Mulan and Shang do not complete the mission in three days, the alliance will crumble, and the Mongols will destroy China.

Mulan and Shang set off, bringing along [[Yao, Ling, and Chien Po]]. It is revealed that despite the trio's involvement in the rescue of China, the three have not been able to find wives as the Matchmaker had thrown them out. During the trip, the princesses each fall in love with one of the trio, and the feelings are mutual among Yao, Ling, and Chien Po. One night, the three soldiers take the princesses to a nearby village where they impress the princesses. Mulan decides to disobey orders and try to prevent the arranged marriage. Meanwhile, Mushu works to try to break apart Mulan and Shang. He is successful in tricking Shang into thinking that Mulan is manipulating him. This leads to utter friction between Shang and Mulan.

As the trip goes on, they pass through land that is inhabited by bandits. Under pressure from [[Cri-Kee]], Mushu is forced to reveal his plan to break up Mulan and Shang. Realizing the misunderstanding and furious at Mushu for what he tried to do, Mulan goes to clear up the matter with Shang. Before she can do so, the group is attacked by bandits. Mulan and Shang are able to save the princesses, but end up hanging from a broken bridge. The rope can only support one person, so Shang lets go to save Mulan, and falls into the river.

Mulan continues on the journey to Qui Gong. However, since the princesses don't wish to go through with the marriage, and Shang is believed dead, Mulan offers herself as a bride to one of the princes. However, Shang is revealed to have survived the fall and goes to Qui Gong to stop her from marrying Lord Chin's son. Mulan almost goes through with the marriage but is stopped by the Golden Dragon of Unity, actually Mushu imitating the dragon by speaking from inside the statue. The ruler of Qui Gong is forced to stop the wedding. Mulan and Shang are married, and the princesses are released from their vows. Back home, the ancestors prepare a list of chores to do for Mushu. Shang arrives at the shrine and combines his family's temple with Mulan's. This allows Mushu to keep his title as a family guardian. In his joy, he accidentally reveals himself to Shang. However, Mulan has already told Shang of Mushu, so the matter is null. Mulan and Shang live happily ever after.

==Reception==
The film was panned by film critics. It holds 0% on review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes. According to Scott Gwin of CinemaBlend, "''Mulan II'' is a direct-to-DVD disgrace that takes everything excellent about its predecessor film, rips it to shreds, and uses it for rat cage lining." Other critics called it trivial or falling short of realistically representing China.

==Original concept==
[[Barry Cook]], the director of the first film, was asked to write a treatment for the sequel. He turned in a one-page draft that featured Mulan and Shang about to be married when the emperor sends them on a mission up North. The finale would have featured Mulan and her allies, which included her ghost ancestors, taking on Shan-Yu and his ghost army.<ref>[http://animatedviews.com/2012/director-barry-cook-remembers-the-peoples-of-walt-disney-feature-animation-florida/ Director Barry Cook remembers the Peoples of Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida] at [http://animatedviews.com Animated Views]</ref>
