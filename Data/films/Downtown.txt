==Synopsis==
A commuter’s disappointment in missing the bus turns into a colorful and unexpected joyride when the surrounding street art bursts to life, revealing the heart of the city from an entirely new perspective.

== Plot ==
Featuring humans depicted entirely in silhouette, a man misses his bus and solemnly rests against a building. Suddenly, a colorful graffiti being, who resembles a manta ray, pops up and ecstatically proceeds to color the wall and all the buildings around him. The graffiti drags the man through the city at a high speed dodging cars along the way.

Eventually, the man begins to find the trip exciting and begins to run through the streets, coloring everything he sees. He runs up the side of a building and leaps off to examine the now bright and beautiful city. In a post credits scene, everything is back to normal as the man turns around to see that the graffiti was nothing more than a mural and steps back to appreciate it.
