==Trivia==
*On release, this short was paired with the [[True-Life Adventures]] film, ''[[Secrets of Life]]''.
*A recycled version of Casey Jones's train from ''[[The Brave Engineer]]'' is featured. The animation of the advancing Indians is also reused from ''[[Californy 'er Bust]]''.
*The engine on the train is an old 4-4-0 engine or an American type steam locomotive. These types of engines were used most common on American railroads, during the 1800s and 1830s until 1928.
*The horse licks the cowboy's face three times each in the cartoon.
*This song was released on the 1986 VHS of Disney's Greatest Lullabies Volume Two, 1987 VHS of [[Disney Sing Along Songs: Heigh-Ho]]Â and the 2004 VHS and DVD of [[Disney Sing Along Songs: Little Patch of Heaven]].
*The title card is similar to that of ''[[Jack and Old Mac]]'', which was released earlier that year and also directed by Justice.
