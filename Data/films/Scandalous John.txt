'''''Scandalous John''''' is a [[1971]] wonderful, gentle, and old-fashioned Western film directed by Robert Butler.

==Plot==
The Old West is just not the same, what with so few cattle being run, and law-abiding folk running around like they own everything. In this family comedy drama, it's too much for John McCanless ([[Brian Keith]]). He is a modern rancher who has been so deeply affected by the death of his wife that he has retreated into a world of Wild West imagination. He is also a cranky former gunslinger who has no intention of selling his beloved acres to some fool who wants to build a dam and flood them all. Going "gently into that good night" is not in the cards at all, and this latter-day Quixote prepares to wage a lonely battle against the namby-pamby modern world. His ranch hand, Paco ([[Alfonso Arau]]), an illegal immigrant, and his bemused daughter, Amanda (Michele Carey) do what they can to help.
