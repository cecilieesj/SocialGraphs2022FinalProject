'''''Once Upon a Mouse''''' is a theatrical featurette highlighting Disney's animated legacy starting with ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' in [[1928]]. It was released to theaters on [[July 10]], [[1981]] on the same bill as ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''.

The featurette is notable for combining scenes from Disney's animated features and shorts with then new and state-of-the-art computer graphics.

The finale montage was used as part of the intro to Disney's ''Limited Gold Edition'' series of videocassettes.

The featurette was never released on home video in the United States and was only released on home video internationally. It was aired on [[Disney Channel]] since the mid 1980s, up until [[2002]] when the nighttime block [[Vault Disney]] was removed. The short has been rumored to return as part of the [[Treasures from the Disney Vault]] on [[Turner Classic Movies]] and Digitally on [[Disney+]].

==Trivia==
*The song "[[Minnie's Yoo Hoo (song)|Minnie's Yoo Hoo]]" used on the ending credits, is the sped up version used for the ending to the 1970s TV series "Mouse Factory."
*The Overture from The [[Mickey Mouse Revue]] is briefly heard in some montage parts.
