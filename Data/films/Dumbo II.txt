'''''Dumbo II''''' was the planned sequel to ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'' that was directed by Robert C. Ramirez, director of the Dreamworks' film ''Joseph: King of Dreams''. It was scheduled to be released in [[2001]] but was delayed for many years until production was cancelled by [[John Lasseter]] after he was named CEO of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in early [[2006]]. The trailer to the film can be found on the 2001 VHS and DVD release of the 60th Anniversary Edition of ''Dumbo''.

==Plot==
Taking place specifically one day after the events of the first film, the story would have involved [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], [[Timothy Q. Mouse]] and a host of other baby animals, each of whom represented a different stage of childhood, getting separated in New York City. While trying to find their way back, each character learned how to fix his or her own problems. ''Dumbo II'' also sought to explain what happened to Dumbo's father, Mr. Jumbo.

==Characters==
In addition to [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]], [[Casey Junior]], [[Timothy Q. Mouse|Timothy]] and [[Mrs. Jumbo]] reappearing, ''Dumbo II'' was to have featured the following characters:

*'''Penny:''' An ostrich who was jealous of Dumbo because he could fly and she couldn't.
*'''Godfry:''' A hippo who was older than all his companions and insisted on doing everything independently as a result.
*'''Dot:''' A zebra who was constantly curious and had a habit of exclaming "why" repeatedly.
*'''Claude and Lolly (Alternatively Sophia and Ivan):''' Two bear cubs who always wanted to do things in a hurry, often ending up with a mess as a result.
*'''Animal Control Officer:''' An unnamed, evil Animal Control Officer who pursued [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] and his friends while they tried to get back to the circus.
