'''''Lambert the Sheepish Lion''''' is a Disney animated short film that was released in [[1952]]. ''Lambert the Sheepish Lion'' was directed by Jack Hannah, and the voice of the narrator and the stork was provided by actor and Disney legend, [[Sterling Holloway]].

==Plot==
A stork is making a delivery to a flock of sheep. All the ewes get lambs except for one, but a lion cub makes his way out of the stork's sack and bonds with the childless ewe. The stork sees the lion is destined for South Africa, but decides to let him remain with the flock when the ewe has taken in the cub and named him [[Lambert Lion|Lambert]]. Because Lambert is different, he is ostracized by the rest of the lambs, which continues after he matures into a full-grown lion. However, when a wolf attacks the flock, Lambert is only one powerful enough to confront him. After scaring off the wolf, Lambert is now carried around as the flock's hero. And as for the wolf, he's last seen clinging onto a bush on a cliff. The narrator assures us not to worry about him. He has a place to cling; he won't starve because that bush has berries, every spring.

==Trivia==
*The original print of the film was given as a gift to {{WikipediaLink|Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito}} of [[Japan]] because it was his favorite Disney cartoon.
*In [[1952]], the film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category "Best Short Subject, Cartoons," but lost to ''[[w:c:tomandjerry:The Two Mouseketeers|The Two Mouseketeers]]'', a ''{{WikipediaLink|Tom and Jerry}}'' cartoon.
*[[Sterling Holloway]] was also the voice of [[Mr. Stork]] in ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', in which he plays a similar role in the plot.
*This short is also included in the film ''[[Other Disney Lions]]''.
*The [[Goofy]] holler is heard when the wolf gets bumped off the cliff.
*The [[Netflix]] version of this cartoon as part of ''[[Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films]], Vol. 2: Three Little Pigs'' used the [[Silly Symphonies]] opening and closing titles instead of the "A Walt Disney Production" opening and closing titles, even though the cartoon was released 13 years after the Silly Symphonies ended in [[1939]]. This is also the version formerly seen on [[Disney+]], before it had its original Walt Disney Production titles restored back to the cartoon. However the first few seconds of the cartoon's opening music cue heard in the Buena Vista reissue logo (originally the RKO logo) is cut.
