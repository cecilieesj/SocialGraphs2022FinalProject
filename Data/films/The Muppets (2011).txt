'''''The Muppets''''' is [[:Category:The Muppets Characters|the Muppets]]' seventh feature film, released in 2011. The script was written by [[Jason Segel]] and [[Nick Stoller|Nicholas Stoller]], the writer-director team behind the 2008 film ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''; and was directed by [[James Bobin]], co-creator of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Flight of the Conchords]]''.

The film started production in September 2010. Principal photography for ''The Muppets'' began on October 30, 2010 and concluded on February 11, 2011.

Theatrically, the film was accompanied by a new short film featuring [[Pixar]]'s ''Toy Story'' characters.

''The Muppets'' is also the Muppets' first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning film, bringing home the trophy for Bret McKenzie's "[[Man or Muppet]]." It is the highest [[Box office grosses|grossing Muppet film]], not accounting for inflation (in today's dollars, ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' holds this prize).

The film was [[The Muppets (video)|released]] on DVD and Blu-ray in the [[The United States of America|U.S.]] on March 20, 2012.

==Official Synopsis==
''On vacation in [[Los Angeles]], [[Walter]], the world's biggest Muppet fan, and his friends [[Gary (The Muppets)|Gary]] (Jason Segel) and [[Mary (The Muppets)|Mary]] ([[Amy Adams]]) from [[Smalltown, USA]] discover the nefarious plan of oilman [[Tex Richman]] ([[Chris Cooper]]) to raze [[The Muppet Theatre]] and drill for the oil recently discovered beneath the Muppets' former stomping grounds. To stage The Greatest Muppet Telethon Ever and raise the $10-million needed to save the theater, Walter, Mary and Gary help [[Kermit the Frog]] reunite the Muppets, who have all gone their separate ways: [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] now performs with a Reno casino tribute band called [[The Moopets]], [[Miss Piggy]] is a plus-size fashion editor at Vogue Paris, [[Animal]] is in a Santa Barbara clinic for anger management, and [[Gonzo]] is a high-powered plumbing magnate. With secret, signature, celebrity cameos, "The Muppets" hits the big screen November 23, 2011.''

===Development===
It was working on ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'' with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] that initially inspired [[Jason Segel]] and [[Nick Stoller|Nicholas Stoller]] to pitch the movie to Disney.

In 2008, Jason Segel and Nick Stoller pitched a concept for a Muppet movie to Disney Vice President Kristin Burr. The pitch was well received and the pair was offered a deal to develop their script. In March 2008, [[Variety]] first reported that Disney signed a deal with Segel and Stoller to create the next Muppet movie; with Segel and Stoller penning the script and Stoller attached to direct.<ref name="variety">[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117982291.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 Variety - Segel and Stoller Take on Muppets] March 12, 2008</ref> Segel has been very outspoken on his involvement, mentioning his role writing for the Muppets in many interviews and appearances. Drafts of Segel and Stoller's script, originally entitled ''The Greatest Muppet Movie of All Time!!!'' circulated. According to early drafts of the screenplay, the film would include celebrity cameos by Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau, [[Batman Begins|Christian Bale]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Steve Carell]], [[George Clooney]], Jack Black, [[Mel Brooks]], Matt Damon, [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[Rachel Ray]], [[Bob Saget]], Lisa Lampenelli, [[Jeff Ross]], and [[Charles Grodin]].<ref name="aicn">[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/40492 Ain't It Cool News - Script Review]</ref> A cameo was also written for [[Elmo]], but it was said it would've been too expensive.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2076566,00.html#ixzz1PSk8o55v Exclusive: On the Set of the New Muppets Movie], Stein, Joel, ''Time''</ref>

In June 2008, Segel said: "I just turned in my first draft of the Muppets and I'm really excited about it. I think we're bringing them back. Hopefully it will fall right in the pantheon of ''The Great Muppet Caper'', ''Muppets Take Manhattan'', ''Muppet Movie'', you know, we're trying to make one of those."<ref>"[http://www.movieweb.com/news/15/29115.php Jason Segel Spills More About His ''Muppet Movie'']", Movieweb.com. June 8, 2008.</ref>

Stoller commented on the film in a 2008 interview: 
{{quote|Basically, we're gonna do an old school Muppet movie, where the Muppets have to put on a show to save the studio. It's very simple. A big part of the movie is rounding up all the Muppets from around the world, because they've all been separated. So it's collecting them and bringing them together to put on this big show. It should hearken back to ''Great Muppet Caper'' and ''Muppets Take Manhattan'' and those kinds of Muppet movies. Jason and I are having a lot of fun writing it. We want to get as many cameos and guest stars as possible. Jason will play a human ventriloquist, and his puppet is alive and wants to be a Muppet.<ref>Walsh, Patrick.

April 14, 2008.</ref>}}

In his March 20, 2009 appearance on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', Jason Segel talked about his love for the Muppets, and his then-current work on the script for the next Muppet movie. Statler and Waldorf appeared in the audience to heckle Fallon and Segel.

Early versions of the script described Gary and Walter as "a ventriloquist and his puppet who's alive and wants to be a Muppet." Later versions described Walter as a nondescript, brown puppet.

Said Jason Segel: "We also did have a great trick where at the end I wrote that Kermit is like, 'And I’m so happy that you guys liked our telethon. As a matter of fact, we’re going to relaunch The Muppet Show starting this fall on [[ABC]].' ABC was like, 'What are you talking about? Take it easy, kid.'"<ref name="Crave">Bibbiani, William. [http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/178561-jason-segel-talks-the-muppets Jason Segel Talks 'The Muppets'], CraveOnline. November 22, 2011.</ref> According to the Blu-ray commentary, the note they got back from Disney said "Nice try."

While early reports said Stoller would also direct the film,<ref name="variety" /><ref>[http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/10188/tcid/1 Nick Stoller interview]</ref> in January 2010 James Bobin was hired to direct the film.<ref>"[http://www.heatvisionblog.com/2010/01/muppet-movie-james-bobin-flight-of-the-conchords-.html 'Flight of the Conchords' co-creator will direct Disney's Muppet movie]". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'s'' Heat Vision blog, Heatvisionblog.com. January 29, 2010</ref> David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman became producers for the film.

The first table read of the script took place in May 2010.<ref>[http://chud.com/articles/articles/23735/1/THE-MUPPETS-JUST-DID-A-TABLE-READ-FOR-THE-NEW-MUPPET-MOVIE/Page1.html Chud.com] May 18, 2010</ref> In July 2010, the team involved with producing the movie met with creative heads at Pixar to fine-tune the script.<ref>''Reuters'' via ''Hollywood Reporter'' [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney/disney-picks-pixars-brains-for-muppets-movie-idUSTRE66L0M120100722 "Disney picks Pixar's brains for Muppets movie"] by Borys Kit, July 22, 2010</ref> Walt Disney Pictures originally announced a Christmas 2011 release for the film, but in December 2010 the release was announced for Thanksgiving 2011.

On October 15, 2010, it was announced that Amy Adams, Rashida Jones and Chris Cooper were nearing deals to join the movie. According to a report on Hollywood.com, "Segel will star in the lead role, with Adams as his girlfriend. Jones takes the role of an ABC executive. Cooper plays the villain, a greedy man who wants to drill for oil underneath the studio. And he also has a personal vendetta against the Muppets: he never thought they were funny."

Segel discussed composer Bret McKenzie's involvement in a January 2011 interview. Segel said that he had considered writing the music himself but thought he might not be able to do it right. Segel said: "I'm good at writing songs that are allowed to just be funny; They don't need to have a tremendous amount of musical merit, but these Muppet songs have to be great. The lineage of the Muppet songs, things like ''Rainbow Connection'' and all that, it's not a job for an amateur. McKenzie really knows what he's doing, and his songs have just been beautiful."<ref name="chronicle">Truitt, Brian. "[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/154119185 Hi-ho! Jason Segel the 'Muppet' movie star here]", ''California Chronicle''. January 4, 2011.</ref>

In a 2011 interview, James Bobin revealed that early scripts included a different ending, where it's revealed that Tex Richman was really Kermit in a human suit, having made up Tex's plans so that the Muppets would get back together.<ref>[http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2011/11/21/the-muppets-nick-stoller-reveals-films-origins-his-beaker-obsession/ Spinoff interview with James Bobin]</ref>

Many Muppet characters that had not been seen in years were rebuilt for the film. According to Muppet designer [[Stephen Rotondaro]]; "A lot of stuff was recreated, some puppets had gone missing—like Marvin Suggs [the ''Muppet Show'' musician known for playing an instrument made of living balls of fluff]. At this point, there are bibles, so everything’s patterned and labeled."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120422224719/http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2012/03/inside-the-muppets-workshop/ D23′s Inside the Muppets’ Workshop] (archive link)</ref>

Although the film used traditional puppets instead of computer-generated characters, there were several visual effects shots in the film, allowing the traditional characters to do things that they had not been able to do before. Visual effects producer Janet Muswell Hamilton spoke of finding the right balance; 
{{Quote|About three months before shooting began, I realized that I needed an education on all things Muppets, because we really didn't want to cheat and use computer-generated puppets. We wanted the original puppets to do more than they've ever been able to do before ... and it was very interesting.

I spent lots of time with the puppeteers (and the director, of course) discussing ways to achieve our ideas. We needed cool concepts that no one's seen before -- all while maintaining the integrity of the Muppets, the Muppet franchise, the Muppet name, the Muppet feeling. The puppeteers were very intent on keeping everything, as they said, very "Muppet-y." It's a lot harder working with the fluffy characters than it is working with their computer-generated counterparts. You must always keep in mind where the puppeteers will stand (because they're there even though the audience doesn't see them), how they hold the puppets, and if they're able to move in certain positions. How can we help them achieve something new and exciting without undermining the creative presence of the Muppets?<ref>Disney Insider, "[http://disney.go.com/disneyinsider/going-places-no-muppet-has-gone-before Going Places No Muppet Has Gone Before]", ''Disney.go.com''.

[[File:Muppets 01-sm.jpg|thumb|300px]]

Production started in September 2010 and filming began on October 30, 2010. 
The November 12, 2010 issue of [[Entertainment Weekly]] featured a 2-page spread about the new Muppet movie. The article featured a summary of the film's concept along with quotes from Segel and Bobin. It also included the first photo of Walter, who up until then had never been seen, along with new photos of the Muppets and the movie's co-writer/co-star Jason Segel posing at a mock table read for the film. A second version of this publicity photo was released including James Bobin, Nick Stoller, and Bret McKenzie.

The exteriors of [[Charlie Chaplin Studios|the Jim Henson Company Studio Lot]] (the former Charlie Chaplin Studios) were redressed as [[Muppet Studios]] in November 2010 for the filming of ''The Muppets''.

Mickey Rooney filmed a cameo for the film in November 2010.<ref>[http://www.toughpigs.com/mickey-rooney/ Mickey Rooney and Muppets]</ref> Ricky Gervais, Kathy Griffin and Billy Crystal filmed cameos in January 2011.

Hollywood Boulevard was closed for two nights on January 18th and 19th to film the final musical number. The shoot involved Amy Adams, Jason Segel and multiple Muppets singing and dancing in front of the [[El Capitan Theatre]], with several rows of backup dancers and dozens of extras and Muppets filling the busy street.<ref>Lussier, Germain. "[http://www.slashfilm.com/set-photos-the-muppets-hollywood-boulevard/ Set Photos: ''The Muppets'' Take Over Hollywood Boulevard]", Slashfilm. com. January 18, 2011.</ref>

''The Los Angeles Times'' reported that Kermit will once again sing one of his signature songs, ''The Rainbow Connection'' to resurrect classic material, but also to show his range as an actor, as he says he's very dramatic in the film. In an interview Kermit said Segel's "a big kid," and added that "the only problem is he's very tall, so I have to do most of my scenes standing on boxes. He's 6-foot-3, 6-foot-4, and I'm only about 18 inches high." Kermit also said he's excited to be back in the movies: "Not only is it a big project but we get to be big on the screen. It's good for all of us except Piggy. She's not crazy about being any bigger."<ref>McIntyre, Gina.

On April 26, 2011, a second unit film crew traveled to Reno, [[Nevada]] to film some exterior shots. Including a scene in the Bonanza Casino parking lot with some Muppet characters, and a small shot looking into the casino.<ref>[http://www.rgj.com/article/20110426/NEWS/104270338/Bonanza-Casino-Reno-readies-role-Muppets-movie?odyssey=nav|head rgj.com]</ref>
