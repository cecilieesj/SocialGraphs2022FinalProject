'''''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers''''' is a live-action/computer-animated film based on the [[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers|animated television series of the same name]].

==Synopsis==
It's been over 30 years since the end of ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'', and [[Chip and Dale]] are currently living a life of mediocrity in a world where humans and cartoon characters live together. Meanwhile, traditionally animated characters are doing their best to live in a world of remakes and reboots with realistic computer graphics. Now, the duo must renew their partnership and bring the gang back together to try and save their friend and teammate, [[Monterey Jack]], from a fate worse than death: video piracy.

==Plot==
In a world co-populated by both humans and cartoon characters, Chip and Dale had met in grade school, being outcasts from the other students, and soon became fast friends. Their friendship led to creating their own show, ''Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers'', which had been a big success. However, during filming, Dale revealed to Chip that he had also gotten a solo role in a spy show called ''Double-O-Dale'', which Chip took as an insult to their friendship. In the thirty+ years since the show, the two had drifted apart, and the Rescue Rangers broke up. Chip became a successful insurance salesman, while Dale continued his acting career, having special CGI surgery to improve his looks, but now spends his time on the fan convention circuit.

In the present, Chip and Dale are contacted by Monterey Jack, who has fallen in debt to a figurehead named Sweet Pete due to his cheese addiction. He tells the pair of a criminal operation where they kidnap toons, alter their appearance, and ship them overseas to produce bootleg works. Chip wants no part of the investigation, still holding a grudge with Dale. Later, Monterey is found missing and both arrive to help the police, led by Captain Putty and Detective Ellie Steckler. Ellie reveals herself as a big fan of Chip and Dale, and tells the pair that while their hands are tied as police, the two can try to find out where Sweet Pete is operating from.

Chip and Dale go to Bjornson the Cheesemonger, where Monterey had been buying his cheese, and ask to see Sweet Pete. They are taken to the uncanny valley part of town to Sweet Pete's factory that produces porta-potties from unsold toy stock. They meet Sweet Pete - who in reality is an adult Peter Pan - and his henchmen Bob the Viking and Jimmy the Polar Bear. Sweet Pete realizes the two are trying to find info on his bootlegging business and try to capture the pair, but the chipmunks escape. The two discuss what they discovered with Ellie, learning that she is not in good standing with Captain Putty due to acting on a bad tip and raiding Nickelodeon Studios with disastrous results. Dale recalls that Sweet Pete is wearing a fitness tracker, and so with Ellie's help, the pair sneak into a bathhouse to steal Pete's tracker. They trace his movements to a dock warehouse, and find evidence of prior toon kidnappings, allowing the police to fully investigate. The investigation leads to the discovery of a large operating machine designed to take parts of toons and replace them with others, and while the chipmunks end up stuck in it, they manage to avoid the laser cutters. At the far end, the two discover a trove of toon parts, including Monterey's mustache.

At the police station the next day, the pair argue over their recent spats, and Chip angrily gives Dale a golden pog that he kept to remind him of their better past. The two smell the scent of Monterey's cologne, and trace it to either Captain Putty or Ellie, and flee the station, fearing one of them is working with Sweet Pete. They go to the ongoing Fan Con and try to convince Ugly Sonic to get his contacts with the FBI to help. Just then, Sweet Pete, Bob, and Jimmy arrive, having followed Dale by his social media posts. In the ongoing chase, Bob is caught with the help of Tigra and Lumière, but Chip is caught by Pete and Jimmy. Sweet Pete takes Chip back to the warehouse, and Ellie is lured by Captain Putty there as well, revealing Putty has been working with Pete as part of the bootleg ring, as well as having set up Ellie for the mistaken raid.

Pete has Ellie call Dale to convince him to come to the warehouse alone as to save Chip from being erased, but Ellie speaks in code from past ''Rescue Ranger'' episodes. Though Dale misinterprets the clues, he realizes that Ellie is in trouble, and reaches out to Gadget and Zipper, who have married and raised a large family, to help get him to the warehouse. With Gadget and Zipper flying the Ranger Plane, Dale makes his way inside the warehouse using a firework, which gets lodged into the operating machines' innards, stopping it before Chip is operated on. The firework then causes the machine to overload and explode. The machine goes haywire, turning Jimmy into a fairy and transforms Pete into an amalgamation of various toons and more powerful than before. While Ellie fights Putty, Pete chases down Chip and Dale through the warehouse, revealing that this is also where the bootlegs were being filmed. The chipmunks eventually lure Pete to the docks, and using a ploy from one of the show's episodes, are able to trap Pete. The FBI, led by Ugly Sonic, arrive to help as Chip and Dale apologize for their behavior over the years. Just as the FBI try to secure Pete, he fires a cannonball at Chip, but Dale leaps up to block it, falling unconscious. Chip fears for his friend's life, but Dale wakes up, revealing that he kept the golden pog which took the brunt of the shot. The chipmunks find where all the kidnapped toons have been kept, including Monterey who had been operated on to be in a bootleg version of ''Dumbo''. The full Rescue Ranger team unites, and Dale introduces them to Ellie. Ellie admits she has decided to open her own detective agency, following in the footsteps of her heroes. As the team depart, Dale offers the idea of a reboot, but the others agree only if they see the script first, much to Dale’s delight.

During the credits, the Rescue Rangers fame is restored as they create a new version of their television series and even appear in video games, while the villains all get their comeuppance in jail. As the Rescue Rangers return to Fan Con to greet their adoring crowd, a lonely Darkwing Duck boos them; hoping to get [[Darkwing Duck (reboot)|his big break]] soon.

==Trivia==
*This film was thought to be released on the same day as this special, ''[[The Wonderful Summer of Mickey Mouse]]'', before the date was changed.
*This movie appears to be ignoring the fact that Chip and Dale originated in the classic Disney shorts and have starred in multiple shows after ''Rescue Rangers'' ended (including ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', ''[[House of Mouse]]'', ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', [[Paul Rudish]]'s ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' [[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse|series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]'', and ''[[Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life]]''). This is especially strange because non-''Rescue Rangers'' Chip and Dale merchandise is shown in Dale's collection.
*Chip and Dale speak in normal-pitched male voices when they are respectively voiced by John Mulaney and Andy Samberg, while their high-pitched chipmunk voices by Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton are treated in the film as their in-series voices.
**This is despite the fact that other cartoon characters, such as Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Porky Pig, and Woody Woodpecker still had high-pitched voices in their respective [[List of cameos in Who Framed Roger Rabbit|cameos]] in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
*Chip is computer-animated, but in a cel-shaded style to emulate the look of traditional hand drawn animation. The same is true of Dale in the prologue.
*A [[1990]] issue of ''Comics Scene magazine'' reported that a theatrical feature film based on the series was planned for a [[1990]] release. However, the film never saw the light of day, possibly due to the lackluster performance of ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]''.
*This film is the second Disney live-action movie based on an animated series, after ''[[Kim Possible (film)|Kim Possible]]''. 
**This film also marks the first one that will be released on [[Disney+]].
**This film also marks the first live-action film based on an animated series to be produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], as ''Kim Possible'' was a Disney Channel Original Film and, thus, it was produced by Disney Channel Original Productions.
**This film also marks the first live-action Disney film to center on classic Disney characters, as films, such as ''[[Fantasia]]'' only had classic Disney characters appearing in a specific segment, while others, such as ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' only included them in minor roles or cameos.
*Chip and Dale (briefly), Gadget, and Zipper (in fly buzzes) are the only members of the Rescue Rangers to have their original voice actors reprise their respective roles. Conversely, Monterey Jack is the only member of the Rescue Rangers to not have his original voice actor reprise his role at all, although his original voice was used for different characters.
*The poster for the movie additionally sneaks-in a [[Darkwing Duck (reboot)|''Darkwing Duck'' reboot]] in the background (behind RR script and on top-right side on yellow note).
*This film marks the first animated appearance of [[Roger Rabbit]] since the 1993 short, ''[[Trail Mix-Up]]''.
*This film marks the fourth Disney film to feature cameos by non-Disney characters; in this case, B.O.B., Mantis, Banzai Bills, Randy Marsh, two of the cats from the [[wikipedia:Cats (2019 film)|2019 film adaptation]] of ''Cats'', Tigra, Mr. Natural, Blaster, He-Man and Skeletor, MC Skat Kat, and the cast of ''My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic''. Some characters are also name dropped, such as Squidward from ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', Yogi Bear, and Chun Li from the ''Street Fighter'' series.
**Tigra is one of the few cameos from a Disney company that isn't directly Walt Disney Animation, being associated with Marvel.
*This film marks the second Disney movie to use the enhanced version of the logo, after ''[[Jungle Cruise (film)|Jungle Cruise]]''.
*This film marks [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Seth Rogen]]'s second film together, their first being the [[The Lion King (2019 video)|remake of ''The Lion King'']]. They will reunite in the [[w:c:mario:Super Mario Movie|upcoming animated ''Super Mario Bros.'' film]] in [[2023]].
**Ironically, Seth Rogen reprises his role of the same Pumbaa from the former in this film.
**Additionally, the scene where Pumbaa interacts with Bob the Dwarf appears to be an in-joke of how they are both voiced by Seth Rogen. However, the joke extends with two of his other characters: Mantis from ''Kung Fu Panda'' and B.O.B. from ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', both made from DreamWorks Animation, currently owned by one of Disney’s rival studios, NBCUniversal.
*The film marks Seth Rogen, [[Will Arnett]], and Paul Rudd's only live-action/animated film together, their first animated film being ''Monsters vs. Aliens''.
**The film also reunites Seth Rogen with Paul Rudd, who both co-starred in ''Sausage Party'', the first (and only) 3D computer-animated film to be rated R.
*Both Paul Rudd and J.K. Simmons have roles in ''{{WikipediaLink|Ghostbusters: Afterlife}}'' and [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]: Rudd played the role of [[Scott Lang]] and Gary Grooberson and Simmons performed [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and Ivo Shandor.
*Alan Oppenheimer (who voices He-Man and Skeletor) has also voiced [[Donald Drake and Plato|Plato]], [[Aldrin Klordane]], and [[Captain Colonel]] in the original show.
*The film reunites Seth Rogen and J.K. Simmons, who also voiced Mantis and Kai the Collector respectively from ''{{WikipediaLink|Kung Fu Panda 3}}''.
*This film marks the first Disney live-action/animated hybrid film since ''[[Mary Poppins Returns]]''.
*This film marks the first Disney film to be co-produced by [[Mandeville Films]] since the 2017 remake of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. It is also the eighth Disney film overall to be co-produced by the company.
*In the teaser trailer, [[Fat Cat]] was seen pictured on a lunchbox and on a video game cartridge, both of which are located in the room filled with various [[Rescue Rangers]] merchandise. However, [[Fat Cat]] was not shown to be confirmed to make a physical appearance in the movie until the "Waiting" TV spot. 
**Professor Nimnul is also confirmed to appear in the movie, as shown in the aforementioned TV spot.
**Wart and Mepps also make brief cameos in the movie; they are shown behind Chip and Dale as they walk through Main Street.
*Given that the film's world is pretty identical in concept to the world of ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' (as in, animated [[Toon]]s of all kinds existing alongside real humans in a live-action world), along with Roger's aforementioned cameo, it could be that this movie is actually in-continuity with that movie, taking place in the same world many decades later, making this movie a sort of spiritual "sequel" or "spinoff" to that movie, in a "shared universe" sense.
*This film marks the first time MC Skat Kat appears in some form of media since the ''American Dad'' episode "Kiss Kiss Cam Cam". This film also marks the first time that he appears in a film, particularly a Disney film.
*[[Scrooge McDuck]] makes a cameo in the bathhouse while the chipmunks search. [[David Tennant]] also reprise his role of Scrooge when laughing.
*The Chimera monster (a mixed form of Sweet Pete) in this film is made up of several characters.
**the head of [[Fat Cat]], but with different eyes and a bow from [[Marie]] from ''[[The Aristocats]]''
**the torso of [[Peter Pan (character)|Peter Pan]] from the [[Peter Pan (film)|film franchise of the same name]], since Sweet Pete is Peter Pan
**the jacket of [[John Silver]] from ''[[Treasure Planet]]''
**the left arm of [[Wreck-It Ralph (character)|Wreck-It Ralph]] from the [[Wreck-It Ralph (film)|film franchise of the same name]]
**the right arm and shoulder pad of Shredder from the 2003 incarnation of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'', with it's right hand being a cannon filled with Banzai Bills from ''Super Mario Bros.''
**the right leg of [[Woody]] from ''[[Toy Story]]''
**the left leg of ''Transformers'' character Optimus Prime from the ''Bumblebee'' film
**the shorts of [[Mickey Mouse]] (despite the bottoms are squared instead of being rounded)
**and the laugh of [[Cruella De Vil]]
*[[Pete]] briefly appears in [[Aladdin (character)|Aladdin]]'s Prince Ali attire while riding on the [[Magic Carpet]], in a bootleg version of ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''.
*This film marks the third live-action/animated hybrid film of the 2020s, following ''[[W:c:warnerbros:Tom and Jerry (film)|Tom & Jerry]]'' and ''[[W:c:warnerbros:Space Jam: A New Legacy|Space Jam: A New Legacy]]'', both of which are owned by {{WikipediaLink|Warner Animation Group}}.
*This is the not first time [[Peter Pan]] grows up. He previously grew up in the 1991 TriStar Pictures/Steven Spielberg film, ''Hook''.
**It is also not the first time Peter Pan becomes a villain. He was previously one of the villains on the ABC drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time]]''.
**Peter's backstory in this movie contradicts the fact that he appeared in several more productions well after the original ''Peter Pan'' movie (such as ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', ''[[House of Mouse]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', and ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'').
*The teaser trailer was released on February 15th, the same day the original series was released on Blu-Ray.
*The second trailer features Chip and Dale discovering various props and body parts belonging to other cartoon characters. Among them include, the [[Keyblade]], Samurai Jack's sword, Bartok's ears, a stereotypical Mickey Mouse-esque glove, [[Jiminy Cricket]]'s hat and umbrella, the Pink Panther's muzzle, Rocky the Flying Squirrel's cap, Jimmy Neutron's hair, [[Pete]]'s peg leg, [[Mr. Potato Head]]'s body, [[Robin Hood (character)|Robin Hood]]'s hat, a Smurf hat, Ickis' left ear and mouth from ''Aaahh!!! Real Monsters'', and what appears to be the tail of Shenron from ''Dragon Ball''.
**In Fan Con, there are a lot of references to some cartoon characters owned by Disney or owned by other companies. Some include: Sailor Moon, Charlie Brown from ''Peanuts'', [[Moana (character)|Moana]], [[Thor Odinson]] from ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', two mice that are dressed up like [[Leia Organa]] and [[Kylo Ren]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', and Dorothy Gale from ''[[wikipedia:The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', [[w:c:mario:Mario|Super Mario]], [[w:c:pokemon:Ash Ketchum|Ash Ketchum]] from ''[[w:c:pokemon:Pokémon the Series|Pokémon the Series]]'', and [[Jack Sparrow]] from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' franchise.
*Dale tries to break out with his own series called ''Double-O-Dale''. This is a nod to the original series episode, "[[Double 'O Chipmunk]]", in which Dale went by that name.
*Given the film's PG rating from the MPA, this is the first time a classic Disney cartoon character swears in any film; Chip takes God's name in vain once and says "hell" once in a later scene.
*Near the film’s ending, Chip and Dale do a special trick from Episode 325 to defeat Sweet Pete. In reality, the original TV show only had 3 seasons with 65 episodes.
**Additionally, episode 325 as season ''3'' episode ''25'' is also false, as the third season only had five episodes.
*Among the bootlegged toons, Chip and Dale found in the freight container that also held Monty is a bootlegged version of John Blacksad wearing Samurai Jack's kimono.
*Captain Putty reforming from the injuries dished out by Ellie is similar to T-1000 from ''Terminator 2'' and even recreates his famous moments such as melting under the door (where a musical riff on the ''Terminator'' theme can be heard) and being frozen and shattered.
*Originally, the character that was to help out Chip and Dale was [[Jar Jar Binks]] from the ''Star Wars'' franchise. At some point this was changed to Ugly Sonic (the rejected early CGI design of Sonic from ''Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)'') instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/chip-n-dale-rescue-rangers-reveals-ugly-sonic-replaced-another-controversial-character/|title=Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers Reveals Ugly Sonic Replaced Another Controversial Character|website=Comic Book|last=Barnhardt|first=Adam|date=June 4, 2022|access-date=June 5, 2022}}</ref>
**Along with Jar Jar Binks being changed, [[Chris Evans]] was also originally going to appear but was changed to Paul Rudd as well.
**[[Mike Wazowski]] and [[James P. Sullivan]] from ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' were also going to appear instead of He-Man and Skeletor.
**[[Elliott]] from ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'' was also going to appear instead of [[Dottie McStuffins]].
**[[Mushu]] from ''[[Mulan]]'' was also going to show up to fight Bob before they opted for Lumiere.
*This film marks the first feature film released under the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] banner to receive an Emmy nomination.
*The 2019 song “Best Friend” by Saweetie is heard in the teaser trailers.
