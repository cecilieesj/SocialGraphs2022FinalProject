== Trivia ==

* Kaitlyn Maher is the only actress from the first Santa Paws movie to return in this one.
*Since this movie takes place in Pineville instead of New York, actress Kaitlyn gets a new character for her role as Sarah instead of Quinn.
**This would explain why all the other girls from the first Santa Paws movie didn't return.
*The names of the four pups in this movie are Noble, Hope, Charity, and Jingle. Oddly enough, [[Puppy Paws]] is not one of the pups in this film. There are a few reasons why this might be:
**Puppy Paws could have grown up and taken his dad's place as Santa Paws (not likely).
**He could still be a puppy, but the writers chose to not include him.
**He could be still in this film, but under the name of Noble instead (not likely).
**He might have been born way before Noble, Hope, Charity, and Jingle, and is probably growing up.
