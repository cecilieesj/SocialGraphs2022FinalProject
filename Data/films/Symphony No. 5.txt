'''Symphony No. 5 in C minor-I. Allegro con brio''' by Ludwig van Beethoven is the first segment of Disney's [[1999]] animated feature film, ''[[Fantasia 2000]]''. The segment has also been used in the closing credits, but omitted the first 45 seconds as well as the last 13 seconds from the music.
==Synopsis==
This segment starts without introduction immediately after the opening. Abstract patterns and shapes that resemble [[Colorful Triangles|butterflies]] in reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, purples, and pinks in shades, tints, hues and [[Black Triangles|bats in black]] explore a world of light and darkness which is ultimately conquered by light.
