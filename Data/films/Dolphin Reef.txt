==Summary==
Created with Disneynature's signature storytelling style, the film introduces Echo, a young Pacific bottlenose dolphin who can't quite decide if it's time to grow up and take on new responsibilities. Dolphin society is tricky, and the coral reef that Echo and his family call home depends on all of its inhabitants to keep it healthy. But Echo has a tough time resisting the many adventures the ocean has to offer.

==Trivia==
*"Echo", the dolphin who is the main focus of the film, is named after "echolocation", the ability that dolphins use to see things around them.
*The film was originally going to have [[Owen Wilson]] as the narrator of the documentary, but this was scrapped since the film was pulled from theatrical release in April 2018. However, with the film being decided to be released exclusively on Disney+, [[Natalie Portman]] replaces Wilson as the narrator for the Disney+ release.
*This is one of the last Disney+ original films to use the 1967 MPAA logo in the end credits, alongside [[Elephant Graveyard|''Elephant'']].
