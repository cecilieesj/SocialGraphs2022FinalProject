==Trivia==
* This segment featured animation originally intended for the deleted segment, ''[[Clair de Lune]]'' in Disney's [[1940]] animated feature film, ''[[Fantasia]]''.
* However, by the time ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' was released, Clair de Lune was replaced by the new song, Blue Bayou, performed by the Ken Darby Singers, but the original version of the segment still survives.
