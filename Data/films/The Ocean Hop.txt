==Home video releases==
'''DVD'''
* ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]: The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit''

==1932 Reissue Version==
Due to budget restraints, ''The Ocean Hop'' became the sixth and final Disney Oswald short Walter Lantz reissued.<ref>http://lantz.goldenagecartoons.com/disneyoswald/</ref> In addition to adding sound and a musical score by James Dietrich, Lantz shuffled a sequence's order and removed one. In the original version Oswald "The Dark Horse" is introduced before Pete oils his plane. Missing from the reissue is a scene where the dachshund Oswald uses as a plane falls into a taxi engine and turns into sausage links.<ref>http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/disneys-oswald-rabbit-the-ocean-hop-1927/</ref> Due to the original negatives being lost the Lantz reissue was used as the master for the Treasures DVD release and does not restore the reshuffled sequence.
