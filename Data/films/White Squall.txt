'''''White Squall''''' is a [[1996]] [[United States|American]] [[Hollywood Pictures]] drama feature film, directed by [[Ridley Scott]].

==Plot==
The film is based on the fate of the brigantine ''Albatross'', which sank on 2 May 1961, allegedly because of a white squall. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon ([[Jeff Bridges]]), whom the boys call "Skipper". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Gieg ([[Scott Wolf]]), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont ([[Jeremy Sisto]]), shy Gil Martin (Ryan Phillippe), and bad-boy Dean Preston (Eric Michael Cole). When a white squall threatens their ship, the boys must use what Skipper has taught them to survive the horrific ordeal.

==Production==
Part of the film was shot using a horizon tank in Malta, with a full-sized ship, the ''Eye of the Wind'' used to depict the ''Albatross''. Maurice Jarre was originally slated to compose the original score, but was replaced by [[Hans Zimmer]]'s protégé Jeff Rona. Zimmer was set to replace Jarre, but due to time difficulties failed to commit.

==Reception==
The film holds a 62% based on 34 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus stating: "Though it gets occasionally bogged down by touchy-feely sentiment, ''White Squall'' benefits greatly from Jeff Bridges' assured lead performance and Ridley Scott's visceral, exciting direction". ''White Squall'', like Scott's previous film, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, was a box office disappointment.

Roger Ebert gave it three stars. In his review he said "I enjoyed the movie for the sheer physical exuberance of its adventure."
