'''''Ye Olden Days''''' is a black and white ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon that was released on [[April 8]], [[1933]]. It is loosely based on the historical novel ''Ivanhoe'' by Sir Walter Scott.

==Summary==
The short features [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and his friends putting on a musical set in Medieval times. The film takes place in the fictional kingdom of Kalapazoo, where lives a wandering minstrel, portrayed by Mickey himself, playing his lute while riding atop his pet mule across the land. 

Meanwhile, the king of Kalapazoo announces to his court his intention to marry his daughter, the princess ([[Minnie Mouse]]) to the visiting prince of Poopoopadoo ([[Goofy|Dippy Dawg]]). Upon meeting the prince, however, the princess rejects him. Angered by this, the king orders her to be imprisoned in a tower alongside her handmaiden ([[Clarabelle Cow]]) until she changes her mind, making her very depressed. Having witnessed all this from a window, the minstrel climbs a nearby tree and sings his intention to save the princess from her fate, making her fall in love with him.

As the king and his friends enjoy the wedding feast, the minstrel uses the handmaiden's clothes as rope to climb down the tower with the princess, but is caught by the king and captured. He is then sentenced to the guillotine, but the princess pleads for her father to spare him. Seeing how the princess loves him, as well as an opportunity for some entertainment, the king allows the minstrel a chance to fight for his life and the princess' hand in a duel with the Poopoopadoo's prince, exciting everyone present. The prince dresses up in actual battle armor and rides a horse while the minstrel uses a bucket and a furnace as makeshift armor and rides his mule.

They then charge at each other, but their steeds end up headbutting into eachother, causing the riders to fly off. The prince attempts to lance at his opponent, but the minstrel uses a guillotine to chop his weapon and use the sharp end to chase the prince as the crowd cheers on. The mule and the horse duke it out too, and mule overcomes the horse's superior size by bucking his face and then chomping its rear end, causing the horse to run into a wall and knock itself out. The mule then joins his master in chasing the prince until the young monarch leaps out a window, thus making the minstrel the winner of the duel.

The princess kisses her father for giving true love a chance and then joins the minstrel's side as he and his mule are paraded by several others. She pulls up a fan and there share a kiss behind it.
