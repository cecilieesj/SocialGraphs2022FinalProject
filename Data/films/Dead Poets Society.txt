==Plot==
Neil Perry (Leonard), Todd Anderson (Hawke), Knox Overstreet (Charles), Charlie Dalton (Hansen), Richard Cameron (Kussman), Steven Meeks (Ruggiero), and Gerard Pitts (Waterston) are senior students of the Welton Academy, an elite prep school, whose ethos is defined by the headmaster Gale Nolan (Lloyd) as "tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence". Both Neil and Todd are under harsh parental pressure to become a doctor and a lawyer respectively, but Todd wants to be a writer, and Neil discovers a passion for acting.

The teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating (Williams), are unorthodox by Welton standards, whistling the 1812 Overture and taking them out of the classroom to focus on the idea of carpe diem. He tells the students that they may call him "O Captain! My Captain!," in reference to a Walt Whitman poem, if they feel daring. In another class, Keating has Neil read the introduction to their poetry textbook, prescribing a mathematical formula to rate the quality of poetry which Keating finds ridiculous, and he instructs his pupils to rip the introduction out of their books, to the amazement of one of his colleagues. Later he has the students stand on his desk in order to look at the world in a different way. The boys discover that Keating was a former student at Welton and decide to secretly revive the school literary club, the "Dead Poets Society," to which Keating had belonged, meeting in a cave off the school grounds.

When the school administration and his student parents (Especially Neil Perry's father) gets winds of the secret club – something that is against regulations – the dean promises to suspend any student who is a member.

Due to self-consciousness, Todd fails to complete a writing assignment and Keating takes him through an exercise in self-expression, realizing the potential he possesses. Charlie publishes an unauthorized article in the school newspaper, asserting that girls should be admitted to Welton. At the resulting school inquiry, he offers a phone call from God in support, Mr. Keating classes caught a lot of attention from the administration and the students' parents. Nolan warned Keating about using his unorthodox teaching methods is dangerous to the boys, Keating tells the boys to "be wise, not stupid" about protesting against the system.

Knox meets and falls in love with a girl named Chris, using his new-found love of poetry to woo her. He presents one of these poems in class, and is applauded by Keating for writing a heartfelt poem on love. Knox travels to Chris's public school and recites his poem to her, later convincing her to go to a play with him. Neil wants to be an actor through Keating's teaching methods but knows his father (Kurtwood Smith) will disapprove. Without his father's knowledge, he auditions for the role of Puck in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. His father finds out (after also caught the attention Mr. John Keating’s unconventional teaching methods) and orders Neil to withdraw. Neil asks Keating for advice and is advised to talk to his father and make him understand how he feels, but Neil cannot muster the courage to do so. Instead he goes against his father's wishes. His father shows up at the end of the play criticizing John Keating's teaching methods, he takes Neil home and tells him that he intends to enroll him in a military school to prepare him for Harvard University and a career in medicine. Unable to cope with the future that awaits him or to make his father understand his feeling and be reasonable, Neil commits suicide.

Nolan investigates both Neil's death at the request of the Perry family and search out Mr. Keating's Dead Poets Society's activities. confronted by Charlie, Richard admits that he squealed on them and made Keating look scapegoat, and convincing the rest of them to let Keating take the fall. Charlie knows he punches Richard and is later expelled. Each of the boys are called to Nolan's office where their own equality stern parents are waiting for them to be questioning about the DPS and Keating's unorthodox teaching methods. Nolan forces Todd Anderson, Knox Overstreet, Gerard Pitts, and Steven Meeks that they (alongside Neil Perry, Charlie Dalton and Richard Cameron) admit being members of the Dead Poets Society and makes them sign a document blaming Mr. Keating for dangerously using his unconventional teaching methods on the boys, inciting them to restart the dead poets society, and encouraging Neil to defying his father Thomas Perry. Todd sees that other boy's signatures already on the document, and is threatened by his father Mr. Anderson  (who is on the same page as Neil's father Mr. Perry) to sign it. Keating is fired after Nolan found out about the DPS.

The boys return to English class, now being taught by Nolan until a permanent English teacher come to replace Keating during the winter break, who has the boys read the introductory essay only to find that they had all ripped it out. Keating enters the room to retrieve a few belongings. Todd explains to Keating that the boys were forced to confirm and signing the confession that Keating is blamed for both Neil Perry's suicide and DPS. Nolan orders Todd to be quiet and demands that Keating leave the campus immediately. As Keating is about to exit, Todd for the first time breaks his reserve, calls out "O Captain! My Captain!" and stands on his desk. Nolan warns Todd to sit down or face expulsion. Much of the class, including Knox, Meeks, and Pitts, climb onto their desks and look to Keating, ignoring Nolan's orders and until he gives up. Keating leaves visibly touched.

==Reception==
The critical reaction to this film has been favorable; it received positive reviews from 86% of critics cited by Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 from 14 mainstream critics registered on Metacritic.

The Washington Post reviewer called it "solid, smart entertainment", and praised Robin Williams for giving a "nicely restrained acting performance". Vincent Canby of The New York Times also praised Williams' "exceptionally fine performance", while noting that "Dead Poets Society... is far less about Keating than about a handful of impressionable boys".

Roger Ebert's review was mixed, two out of four stars, criticizing Williams for spoiling a creditable dramatic performance by occasionally veering into his onstage comedian's persona, and additionally describing the movie as an often poorly constructed “collection of pious platitudes.” The movie pays lip service to qualities and values that, on the evidence of the screenplay itself, it is cheerfully willing to abandon."
